        "text": "All Old collaboration/partnerships no matter how strong their relationship will end if disagreements and “FITNAH” {allegations) are not checked. It has taken a good (6) months when the Ides of March took effect and on 17th of September 2015 in “Soal Jawab Programme on TV3” CM Adenan became our saviour. Mr. U U afterall is now my best friend forever. Thank you for putting it right and saying its TRADITION.\n\naudie61 was under attack from all angles and even have to say goodbye to a TEAM we built from ashes to a respectable “SEMUT SARAWAK SAYA SUKA” Team . Adolf Hitler had the SS group,mosts cyberwarriors have the SSS that is “saya shok sendiri” but we had nearly 20 of the elite snipers who went about their work without fanfare but did their work accordingly and reached the masses on the ground.\n\nIts no point writing and postings if it doesn’t even scratch the surface of the intended netcitizens if one spams and reposts and retweets says a Minister close to Najib.\n\nWhere are all the bloggers plus troopers hiding? All are playing it safe to say the least as Mahathir is also their former boss and Najib is the present PM but who have criticized them openly.\n\nTruth be told cyber troopers/bloggers are a special breed says a former group editor of a leading newspaper. Seasoned Bloggers can smell a rat from a distant while todays new journalists/reporters just try to pick on the carcasses left behind. A chain command it could be but a press aide to a senior Minister fails to see the significance of the TEAM of Bloggers/Graphic designers.\n\nWhat did the late Lee Kuan Yew said, “No Man is an island” and if the people in power fails to see this and still live in their comforts of their cushy chair and airconditioned rooms they soon will be ousted too. It only takes a spark to start a fire and if mosts bloggers are being sidelined the “PERCEPTION WILL TURN FOR THE WORST”\n\nEven an Assistant Minister in CM Adenan’s cabinet agrees. He says,”in politics perception is the No.1 KILLER to any politicians”. we have been keeping very silent of late as we have been “FITNAH” and saddened that our team was decimated by outside forces.\n\nSome people do take advantage of Sarawakians generosity and naivety. audie61 was lured into the trap and chopped off conveniently with an ulterior motive. The big picture is starting to surface now and from what we have gathered it is no wonder, that Najib’s Prime Ministers Office is being taken for a ride with millions of dollars used not for churning “positive perceptions and press releases” but it did not filter through and paid accordingly on the work done.\n\nA political strategist, degree holder, diploma holder and a high school graduate will be paid accordingly but did the PMO expected this backlash until PM Najib had to come out openly and criticise the bloggers. Who are facebookers, twitterers without the right strategists?;They just click without a care in the world.\n\nWE DONT BLAME PM NAJIB FOR THIS. HIS THINK -TANK AND STRATEGISTS GOT IT ALL WRONG AND GAVE IT TO THE CRONIES WHO KNOW VERY LITTLE OF BLOGGING TO HEAD A TEAM.\n\n“PERCEPTION IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF WRITING AND POSTERS ARE VALUE ADDED TO THE WRITE UPS AS ONE KNOWS PICTURES PAINTS A THOUSAND WORDS’\n\nWhen PM Najib was being attacked and pushed to the corner he was left gasping for air. The cyber team had to find newer methods to come out to safeguard the Prime Minister. The MCMC cyber division had to come out with even a forum”Nothing to Hide” which obviously backfired.\n\nThe BN supreme council was called in and we went to the extend of starting a poster where most were implicated. But where did the cyber team hide said a source? That we did not know until a movement #kekalnajib came about. But they were hard press into submission as Tun Mahathirs bloggers were light years ahead of them and knows their modus operandi. (They ate the #kekalnajib team for breakfast in a whatsapp message to audie61)\n\nSO “ORANG MALAYA TAG “you know we meant no harm and CM Sarawak is indeed our saviour. Please Sarawakians are not backwards and naïve as you all think. We are light years ahead as we know nation building we have to sacrifice for the better good.\n\nNajib looks at Sarawak/Sabah and he knows that infrastructure development is way behind and now he is turning to us not for survival but to ensure that Sarawak will be on par soon.\n\nThank you CM Adenan.\n\n22nd July 2015..a day many Sarawakians who was at the Peaceful Rally march or at the Waterfront Pantomime will remember for as long as they breathe the air in this earthly kingdom. Today 23rd July 2015 is also the birthday of Malaysia’s 6th Prime Minister Najib Razak who turned 62. Many congratulations to him and he needs to be blessed with good health to turn around the blind corners which he is facing unless the detractors are silenced in a manner the government of the day knows best.\n\nNajib has made his choice and those around him will fight on with him to avoid being taken down like Ten pins in the bowling alley. Sarawak is significant to him as a political battleground to shut the traps of those who have been overzealous in dethroning him and tearing to shreds the many programmes that he has embarked on.\n\nWe know that http://www.sarawakreport.org/ was used by the opposition front as a political tool in the last elections and many articles written scored “enough points” to win and ended dreams of many in the BN camp.\n\nNow the incessant attack is no more focus on Sarawak as CM Adenan is winning the popularity polls. Will his army win the war for him against the opposition and give a big boost to Najib?\n\nAugust 17th will be a very important date if its the call of a dissolution in Sarawak. The encampment of both sides of the propaganda machines including surely sarawakreport.org, will give Najib and his men a battlefield back to Sarawak.\n\nWill Adenan and Sarawak be very much in the script? Its coming soon .Be prepared to face the HEAT\n\nThe truth of the matter is Political Popularity does not lasts forever and Adenan knows the game well enough as he has survived many decades in this field.\n\nNajib will need Adenan and it will be in the political history books that Sarawak was the turning point.\n\nFebruary 28th 2015 is a Year since CM Adenan assume Office as the 5th Chief Minister of Sarawak..Many Congratulations to him.\n\n“No Mandate“…Very True..”Borrowed Power“..Undisputed ..”It’s Reality“..Of Course it is and to put in a few more mouth watering words It should read as “the Three Kingdoms ” are working well together. According to the Chief Ministers Men they are gelling well and working together and in concensus with each other in the cabinet and in official matters. (The Three Kingdoms-Adenans men,Awang Tengahs men and Abang Joharis men)\n\nOne would have thought it must be the “Leaders of the MERGED MINDS” as they are very much in the BN coalition and should ultimately be strong enough to even push either of them out of the Kingdom. Unfortunately none of the component leaders are seen to be able to match either the two Generals says a spokesman in the Chief Ministers Men Circle.\n\nThere are a lot of threats and it is the “ENEMY WITHIN” which we must be able to tackle and not so much the Pakatan Force in Sarawak. Overzealousness, Overenthusiastic and Overdoing it have thrown a spanner in the works of one of the Generals who was tipped without bother to ascend the CM’s Chair. In the end the 3 {O’s} did one of the damage plus the DAP Sarawak claims of UMNO on another.However it does seem that there is a different threat which is creeping under the carpet.\n\nAs much as the Chief Ministers Men try to deny that it is happening one knows PBB culture too well in Sarawak. The days of “surat layang layang ,tree-shaking method and ways practised in the past cannot be executed now. Its a wide open space in the social media now and in PBB there is no such thing as infighting the Hierarchy straight on.\n\nTry you may and the whole machinery will sweep you and your “merry men” all the way and have you sunk in the South China Sea.”\n\nNow, where did we pluck all the courage to write this Series 2.? As we told one of the CM’s Men”I might not have the monetary resources but what I have stored up in my Upper body above my neck is enough to send shivers down the spine of many walking the corridors of power“\n\nObviously, a lot of the Generals Men were not too happy around this time last year. Seriously,if your boss baton was snatched from him at the eleventh hour under your noses it will leave a bitter taste in the mouth. One of the General Men even didn’t think that our writing was credible and he too have to swallow his words together with his soldiers.\n\nA year have lapse and they tried many things which even included the famous Sarawak way”bisik bisik of a Coup d’etat,even trying to derail the Chief Minister in his New Policies(illegal loggers,integrity pledge,NCR issues,,bringing in racist bigots) and even to the extend of defaming and alleged that Adenan is controlled from the back very much like the “INFAMOUS 4th Floor Boys” .They really tried to but so far have been checked.\n\nWas this all planned by the former Chief Minister one might ask? Word has it that CM and Governor don’t see eye to eye. Really .do you believe in all this nonsense?\n\nChief Ministers Men have manouvere with caution and CM himself have implemented well and his ideas have ensured political stability till now plus the economy is vibrant which has assited him fully plus the Full Federal Support. Still though it lingers on and that is its not won FAIRLY.\n\nThe No Mandate have come back to haunt Adenan as much as it did to his counterpart the PM Najib himself. Adenan can say,” I will reprimand you,put you in cold freezer etc etc but the fact is he is using his predecessors Mandate and have not even done much to put his men in place. The fact of the matter is that Adenan is also using Borrowed Power which in REALITY does not mean a thing to the other Generals men”.\n\nHere lies the hard cold facts” They can say what they like but the sadness is that they still listen very much to the tune of the former CM.\n\nThis phrase will not go down well but its REALITY,”100 % the Rakyat are warming up to Adenan as the Chief Minister and are popular but 70% of the YB’s and their men are watching at Adenan to fall sooner rather than cross the finishing line.\n\nCM’s Men knows that they will be a “bitter fight ” as the election dates looms. We mentioned earlier “enemy within” and it is BN Coalition itself which will give Adenan some concerns. He not only have to deal with the warring godfather factions of UPP-SUPP/TERAS-SPDP but also those veteran and underperformed YBS in his PBB stable.\n\nOf course, the Generals men wants to be appointed as candidates as they too are winnable and would not want to be dropped. The lists will be drawn out and it will be very ugly within and there will not be too many compromises as the CM will need to vet through carefully and do a thorough scanning as not only they are winnable but also whether when they received the new mandate they will at least listen and respect the Chair of the Chief Minister.\n\nMany are clinging on to the Generals coat tails hoping that their Chief will not abandon them when it matters most.\n\nWhere are the areas where they will be changes will be our next Series. Slowly we will be revealing the names and places and what the Chief Ministers Men have to engage to bring sanity to the office of the Chief Minister even though the Mandate is a Borrowed One which in itself is a Reality.\n\nOne would love to give more quotes out but his would be enough to spice up some eager cyber troopers who will want to defend their Generals turf. No point as the bullets that will rained own will not even penetrate the force field that is in place.\n\nIt is indeed miraculous to say the least that we have come so far,survived and yet we are still not rewarded in the manner that many before us have found fame and fortune and are seen enjoying their rich pickings. Remember those Infamous words hurled at us,”YOU STILL ALIVE…NO! WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN”\n\nLike we said earlier,what we have above our neck will be enough to DERAIL AND EVEN FORCE A MAJOR STORM to Sarawaks Administration before the Chief Ministers Men took control of the CM Chair. Did we not see hurrying and scurrying of the Generals Men when they crisscross the entire state of Sarawak?\n\nOur love is for our beloved Sarawak State to be in harmony and peacefull state with very little outside interference. Next Series will be tastier and mind blowing as we get into the groove.\n\nLet’s wish CM Adenan a Good start after much turbulences and he has achieved so much in 1 year in office. The Generals Men the Series will be till Number 13th and if you need reminding please go back to Series One and how it will all unfold.\n\nBE PATIENT COMING..GST & SEATS\n\n1.https://audie61.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/chief-ministers-men-series-1/\n\n2 https://audie61.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/loyalty-betrayal-2/.\n\n3. https://audie61.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/awang-tengahs-men-making-their-moves/\n\nPlease go through, read and recall the significance of these two dates written in audie61\n\nSeptember 2nd 2010 “Loyalty Betrayal” https://audie61.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/loyalty-betrayal-2/\n\nDecember 14th 2012 https://audie61.wordpress.com/2012/12/14/awang-tengahs-men-making-their-moves/\n\nFebruary 13th 2015 Chief Minister’s Men.\n\nWill this spark Nightmare at “PetraJaya”..??My “Alter Ego” is willing me to unleash the next super nuclear bomb on Petrajaya. (1984 was the release of supernatural slasher horror movie in which the star was Freddy Krueger. 2010 was the remake of Friday the 13th.It does seem that across the South China Sea a much Anticipated Bitter War is also catching fire in PUTRAJAYA.\n\nNo thanks to the writing of Veteran Kadir Jasin. Of course, we are not in the same mould as him as he has served in the New Straits times as Group Editor in Chief.(yours truly was only a political columnist for a local English daily only)\n\nKadir holds nothing back and his thoughts reflects what the elder statesmen Mahathir, has says a blogger Pecah Palak Mikir in a conversation with us as he too hails from Kedah.\n\nWhy rock the stability of the state as very soon its time for the 11th State Elections one may ask? A very Prominent Elder Politician who has served his tenure in SUPP says its time to tell the story of Friday the 13th 2015. There will be a number of Series not Chronicles like Raja Petra Kamarrudiin on Khairy Jamaluddin. (lols…hahaha)\n\nSurely this kickstarts the road to the 11th Sarawak State Elections where there will be ” serious lobbying” to be a candidate.\n\nWe are all watching a “MOVIE MADE”(translate from Hockien) which is UNREAL as mosts of us are hidden from the truth. Look into the eyes of Adenan Satem and tell me the truth? Is he a worried man or is just continuing his term as Chief Minister as he is destined. We have called him a ROBOT before and under all that façade (he sits on 22nd Floor) is a ship that will erupt anytime when the buttons are pushed.\n\nThe Opposition leaders are all waiting for the eruption but knowing Adenan he will prove them all wrong. He was the ONLY ROBOTIC GENERAL under orders and able to see what was coming towards his predecessor Taib Mahmud. He now sits in the very seat which was occupied for 32 years and very soon February 28th 2015 will be his official one year in office. He has an exemplary report card says the Deputy Prime Minister echoing the Prime Minister’s words. (real buddies they are…. hehehe)\n\nAdenan will prevail with returning the seats for BN if he does not rock the status quo of all the candidates who were his predecessors men. Will he do that is a million dollar question? Of course, many of the Chief Ministers Men will be willing to be fielded and the “lobbying” surely will be very intensified. (on the flip side Pakatan will be ready to offer some of them a second chance we hear from the ground)\n\nHowever will Adenan be able to muster a clean FULL SWEEP for PBB again and win back some losts seats? As it seems now there are too many holes for Adenan to fill it up and presently the Pakatan boys will have a field day with PUTRAJAYA catching fire and the sympathy of Anwar round 2.\n\nAdenan can say PKR is and but a party born out of Anwar jailing and now there are more issues to solve than just going after the illegal timber boys, stopping the racists bigots plus overzealous Napoleons left from the former regime.\n\nMost of them are waiting for someone to ignite the FIRE but none dares to step over the line. PUTRAJAYA Kadir Jasin dares . In Petrajaya they know what Adenan is like and he has survived over 30 years with CM Taib which is not an easy feat.( Ya. dahulu dia bujang dan hensem tetapi sekarang juga tua dan kelihatan sakit)\n\nWhat makes audie61 even dare to write about the Chief Ministers Men ? Surely,the party boys will come out and defend him. Oh! we are doomed this time round.Let’s see who is in denial or are they really Chief Ministers men?\n\nAiyoyo, we have written too much for Series one. Time to schedule the next posting.\n\nA STRONG REMINDER ITS ALREADY A YEAR AND WE ARE STILL WAITING……DONT OVERUSE THAT PRIVELEGE SAYS THE ELDERLY PROMINENT POLITICIAN AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS SAYING….\n\nTan Sri Dr James Masing doesn’t want to hear of another Bible-seizing incident.\n\n“I don’t want to see or even hear of another incident involving the seizure of our Bibles. Don’t let it happen again,” the outspoken Land Development Minister from Sarawak told theantdaily.\n\nHe was commenting on the return of the seized Bibles today to the Association of Churches in Sarawak which signalled an end to the religious saga that hogged the nation since January this year.\n\nThe release of 321 copies of the holy book, however, came with two conditions; one, that they are not to be distributed in Selangor, especially among Muslims, and two, they are only for Christians in Sarawak.\n\nNevertheless, for Christians throughout the country, news of the release of the Malay and Iban-language Bibles was a welcome relief.\n\nArguing that the seizure was illegal in the first place as it went against the Federal Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of worship, Masing felt that some overzealous officials had gone overboard.\n\n“It’s illegal in the first place…even the AG has ordered the Bibles to be returned. They should not have detained the holy book until now,” he said.\n\nThe minister appeared upset with the conditions that the Iban-language Bibles should not be distributed in Selangor and could only be used in Sarawak.\n\nHis concern is understandable as there is a sizable Sarawak population in Selangor who are Christians. And this group has been using the Malay and Iban-language Bibles.\n\nSo what happens to the thousands of Sarawak Christians residing in Selangor who have all along been using the Iban-language Bibles?\n\nSays Masing: “There should be no restriction for Sarawak Christians in Selangor as long as these Bibles are only for them. Of course it would be wrong if they are given to non-Christians.”\n\nThe controversy began in January this year when Selangor Islamic Religious Department (Jais) officials seized the Bibles from the Bible of Society of Malaysia (BSM) on grounds that the Bibles violated a 1988 Selangor enactment which prohibited non-Muslims from using the word “Allah”.\n\nThe Bibles were handed to the chairman of the Association of Churches in Sarawak, Rev Archbishop Datuk Bolly Lapok, in a simple ceremony at the Istana Alam Shah in Klang witnessed by Selangor Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah and Menteri Besar Azmin Ali.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Azmin had twitted that an “amicable solution” had been reached.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Tan Sri Abdul Khalid Ibrahim, Azmin had taken a tougher stand and stood up for the Christian community, arguing that the Bibles did not belong to the Muslims and therefore should be returned to the Christians.\n\n“Islam has never asked its followers to disrupt the harmony of other faiths. It is our duty to respect the practice of the other religions in the country. This is a multi-religious society. This is not Saudi Arabia or Sudan. This is Malaysia. This is Selangor.”\n\nHis remarks were welcomed by the Christian community.\n\nThe MCA, meanwhile, in urging Azmin to ensure there is no repeat of the fiasco, regrets the condition which prohibits the distribution of the Iban-language Bibles in Selangor.\n\nThe party’s Syariah Law and Policy Implementation Special Task Force chairman Gan Ping Siew questioned how Sarawak and Sabah Bumiputeras working in the armed forces, police force, civil service or studying on the peninsular alongside with Orang Asli Christians whose first language is Bahasa Malaysia would refer to their scriptures.\n\nHe called on state governments to look into the relevant provisions in the state enactments to enable Malay-speaking Christian Bumiputeras and Orang Aslis to have access to Bahasa Malaysia or native-language versions of the Bible in their homes and places of worship in the peninsula.\n\n– See more at: http://www.theantdaily.com/Main/Bible-seizure-Don-t-let-it-happen-again#sthash.FfQjaJ8T.dpuf\n\nExtracted from Malaysiakini…\n\nBN may lose Sarawak as its ‘fixed deposit’ in the coming state election if internal problems within Sarawak BN are not settled within the next 12 months, warned Parti Rakyat Sarawak president James Masing.\n\n“The problems within SUPP and SPDP still persist and unless leaders within BN are willing to take the bull by the horns, the instability within Sarawak BN will create unnecessary headaches for the chief minister,” he said during the PRS 10th anniversary dinner in Kuching last night.\n\n“It was most unfortunate and rather unnecessary that a new political party called Teras (Parti Tenaga Rakyat Sarawak) was used by some disgruntled State Assemblymen just as Adenan Satem (Chief Minister of Sarawak) assumed the mantle of leadership.\n\n“In fact, it was done as if orchestrated, on the very day Adenan (left) delivered his first winding up speech as the chief minister of Sarawak,” he added.\n\nMasing, who is a senior minister and minister of land development, made it clear that PRS did not agree in the manner and the timing by which Teras was formed.\n\n“And I assume that SUPP, SPDP and maybe some elements within PBB, also do not agree because it destabilises the newly appointed chief minister.\n\n“Solutions to solve problems within SPDP and SUPP could have been handled in a manner which would have allowed the new chief minister time to adjust to his new position.\n\n“It would have given him time to read the political landscape of Sarawak and then suggest the correct solutions,” he said.\n\n“In trying to think of possible solutions, I recalled what Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak said in his speech at the SUPP 23rd Delegates Conference in Kuching.\n\nThis is what he said: ‘You have gone through hell; I want you to come back stronger and ready to fight for BN. I believe in politics of principles’.\n\n“The prime minister believed in politics of principles, and so does PRS. I also believe that the other BN component parties namely PBB, SUPP and SPDP also believe in this,” he said, pointing out that there are rules in BN which had over the years, bound the spirit of comradeship among BN component parties.\n\nHe added one of the rules, is that ‘admission to BN must be 100 percent consensus’.\n\n“What this means is that if one party in BN objects, admission into BN family is impossible. This is the principle which Najib was talking about.\n\n“I cannot see how UPP (United People’s Party) and Teras can get admitted to BN if we follow these principles.\n\n“If admission of these two parties to BN is not possible, then another set of principles must apply in order to solve the current problem in Sarawak – that is principle of personal integrity.\n\n“Among other things, All YBs concerned must look back to where they started and how did they got to where they are now,” he said.\n\n‘Unity is strength’\n\nAlso saying unity is strength, Masing asserted that the four parties (PBB, PRS, SPDP and SUPP) must stand together.\n\n“In order to win the 2016 state election, we must abide by BN rules. Thus this code of conduct among BN followers: ‘you touch one you touch all’ must be practised with dedication and sincerity,” he added.\n\nMasing said UPP which was formed by expelled SUPP leaders and Teras by expelled SPDP leaders, had been telling their supporters and members of the public that they are ‘already in BN’ by virtue of the fact that some of their leaders are in the state cabinet.\n\nUPP is claiming 19 seats that SUPP is going to contest, while Teras is claiming eight seats which are allocated to SPDP.\n\n“I believe all heads of BN component parties in Malaysia and in Sarawak think alike, sharing the same objectives, speaking from same page, sleep on the same bed and dream the same dreams,” he added.\n\n“Unless we are humble enough to trim our egos, lean on and learn from each other, the 2016 state election and 2018 federal election will be worse – urban seats will go.\n\n“The egos which have kept us apart will be dumped in the urban rubbish bins; we will be left with nothing but bruised pride. We will not be the administrators of this state,” he warned.\n\nSarawak is tightening its immigration rules and stepping up scrutiny of visitors particularly from the peninsula to keep out “extremists, religious bigots and racists”, Chief Minister Tan Sri Adenan Satem said.\n\nAt a press conference to mark his 100 days as chief minister, Adenan (pic) said racism and religious intolerance were “not in character with the people of Sarawak”.\n\n“We have lived harmoniously all these many years and it is my responsibility to see that we, people of all races and culture, continue to live harmoniously together.\n\n“May 13 never happened here. As far as Sarawak is concerned, May 13 (race riots in 1969) was a distant thunder on the other side of the hill,” said Adenan, who succeeded Tun Abdul Taib Mahmud in February.\n\nOne way to safeguard the harmony in the state, he said, was to keep religious fanatics and racists “of all colours” out.\n\nNo officials would say how many names are the “black list” of people banned from the state, but one name that Adenan himself had said months earlier was on the list is that of Perkasa chief Datuk Ibrahim Ali.\n\nPerkasa is a Malay right-wing group that had been fanning racial and religious tensions in the peninsula.\n\nAdenan was responding to questions on how he planned to achieve his vision of making Sarawak a “progressive, vibrant and harmonious” state when the rumblings of religious and racial intolerance were getting louder in the peninsula and could spread to Sarawak.\n\nEven though immigration is a matter under federal purview, Sarawak and Sabah have autonomy over immigration in their respective states under the terms of the Malaysia Agreement and, therefore, can bar anyone they deemed undesirable and a threat to the state.\n\nSarawak PKR vice-chairman See Chee How, meanwhile, reminded Adenan that his 100-day “honeymoon” was not without bitterness.\n\nHe said Adenan that he and his new administration are perceived as interim and “a continuation of the old administration that is under intense scrutiny and criticism locally and internationally”.\n\nHe added that Adenan was seen as playing second fiddle to Taib, who is now the Yang DiPertua Negeri.\n\n“Adenan was given a lot of slack in his first 100 days. He has enjoyed a high level of public support.\n\n“The high hopes for what he will be able to accomplish, the benefit of doubt given to him that his administration will govern in ways that they like becomes a trust in the new chief minister and in the promises that he made in his inauguration speech,” See said in a statement.\n\n“The new chief minister vows to be a chief minister for all Sarawakians, to protect the popular aspirations for state autonomy, special rights and privileges under the Malaysia Agreement, and higher oil and gas royalty.\n\n“He further promised to bar the entry of racists and religious bigots and declared that there will be no implementation of hudud in Sarawak and no seizure of Holy Scriptures (Bibles).\n\n“All these bode well with the general Sarawakians,” See said.\n\nHowever, Adenan’s mantle as the Barisan Nasional state chief was also being tested, See said, referring to two senior ministers and about half a dozen assistant ministers who stirred political unrest in the state BN in a mass exodus with their supporters from their former parties to join a newly formed party.\n\nThe move provoked strong opposition from three state BN coalition parties Sarawak United Peoples Party (SUPP), Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) and the Sarawak Progressive Democratic Party (SPDP).\n\nSee summed up Adenan’s 100 days by saying: “While there are no major accomplishments yet, there are also no failures, disappointments or liabilities.\n\n“The new chief minister must deliver his promises and be the chief administration to fulfil the hopes of Sarawakians that things can change and their lives will be improved under the new administration.”\n\nJune 6, 2014."
