        "text": "KUCHING: Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) President, Tan Sri Dr James Jemut Masing, expressed the optimism that the party will win all the six seats contested in the 13th general election (GE13).\n\nRevealing this to the New Sarawak Tribune recently, Masing said, “All the six PRS nominated candidates are winnable. We are confident”.\n\nThe PRS candidates for GE13 are Masir Kujat (Sri Arnan), William Nyalau Badak (Lubok Antu), Datuk Joseph Salang Gandum (Julau), Datuk Aaron Ago Dagang (Kanowit), Datuk Joseph Entulu Belaun (Selangau) and the new face Ugak Kumbong (Hulu Rajang), who replaces five-term incumbent Datuk Billy Abit 100.\n\nin the GEI2 in 2008, we won all six seats with two uncontested namely, Kanowit and Selangau. Certainly the GE13 will be tougher compared to GE12, but we will win all the six seats.” he stressed confidently.\n\nWhen asked whether the Sarawak Workers’ Party (SWP) is a threat to PRS, he replied, “All opposition parties including SWP are a threat to PRS. We do not take electoral fight lightly. We will fight till voting is completed.”\n\nAsked whether he thinks SWP is capable of winning any seat, he answered, “I do not think SWP will win any seat.”\n\nOn the party (PRS) readiness for the GE13, Masing said all their six nominated candidates had been asked to get their respective machinery ready.\n\nI have checked and made enquiry whether they have adhered to party’s guideline and I received a positive reply, he said.\n\nHe added that all party members assigned to the various districts’ polling centres in each of the six constituencies had undergone training and were now actively on the ground.\n\nWe have also distributed the necessary resources and materials for them to do their tasks,” said Masing.\n\nWhen asked what are the common issues the opposition would use as ‘weapons Masing said the common issues in Dayak majority areas were yet to be fulfilled promises such as infrastructure and the Minor Rural Project (MRP) grants, complaints of few visits by the people’s representatives and government agencies, Native Customary Rights (NCR) land issue, delayed projects and birth certificate and Identity card issues.\n\n“However, these are the old issues but the oppositions are likely to raise,” he said.\n\nOn development brought by the party to each of the constituencies, he said that besides enhancing the spirit and dignity of the Dayak community, PRS had Implemented various development projects in the six constituencies.\n\n“Miles of roads had been built and public utilities and other infrastructure facilities have doubled in the last few years.\n\n“Many Dayak smallholders are in the cultivation of cash crops like oil palm and rubber. As the consequence of these developments, the Dayaks now have higher purchasing power.” he said, adding that the perimeter survey of NCR land had assured the landowners of the ownership.\n\n(Source: Sarawak Tribune,18 April 2013)"
