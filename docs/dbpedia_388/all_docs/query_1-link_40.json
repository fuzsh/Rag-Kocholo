Growth was almost exclusively driven by exports - particularly of electronics. As a result, Malaysia was hard hit by the global economic downturn and the slump in the information technology (IT) sector in 2001 and 2002. GDP in 2001 grew only 0.5% due to an estimated 11% contraction in exports, but a substantial fiscal stimulus package equal to US $1.9 billion mitigated the worst of the recession and the economy rebounded in 2002 with a 4.1% increase.\n\nThe economy grew 4.9% in 2003, notwithstanding a difficult first half, when external pressures from SARS and the Iraq War led to caution in the business community. Growth topped 7% in 2004. Healthy foreign exchange reserves, low inflation, and a small external debt are all strengths that make it unlikely that Malaysia will experience a financial crisis similar to the one in 1997. The economy remains dependent on continued growth in the US, China, and Japan, top export destinations and key sources of foreign investment.\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $229.3 billion (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-real growth rate: 7.1% (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-per capita: purchasing power parity - $9,700 (2004 est.)\n\nGDP-composition by sector:\n\nAgriculture: 7.2%\n\nIndustry: 33.6%\n\nServices: 59.1% (2004 est.)\n\nLabor force: 10.49 million (2004 est.)\n\nLabor force-by occupation: agriculture 14.5%, industry 36%, services 49.5% (2000 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 3% (2004 est.)\n\nPopulation below poverty line: 8% (1998 est.)\n\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n\nLowest 10%: 1.4%\n\nHighest 10%: 39.2% (2003 est.)\n\nDistribution of family income-Gini index: 49.2 (1997)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 1.3% (2004 est.)\n\nInvestment (gross fixed): 21.7% of GDP (2004 est.)\n\nBudget:\n\nRevenues: $25.33 billion\n\nExpenditures: $29.33 billion, including capital expenditures of $9.4 billion (2004 est.)\n\nPublic debt: 45.4% of GDP (2004 est.)\n\nAgriculture-products: Peninsular Malaysia - rubber, palm oil, cocoa, rice; Sabah - subsistence crops, rubber, timber, coconuts, rice; Sarawak - rubber, pepper, timber\n\nIndustries: Peninsular Malaysia - rubber and oil palm processing and manufacturing, light manufacturing industry, electronics, tin mining and smelting, logging and processing timber; Sabah - logging, petroleum production; Sarawak - agriculture processing, petroleum production and refining, logging\n\nIndustrial production growth rate: 10.2% (2004 est.)\n\nElectricity-production: 75.33 billion kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-consumption: 68.4 billion kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-exports: 70 million kWh (2002)\n\nElectricity-imports: 0 kWh (2002)\n\nOil-production: 785,000 bbl/day (2004 est.)\n\nOil-consumption: 460,000 bbl/day (2003 est.)\n\nOil-exports: 230,200 bbl/day (2003)\n\nOil-imports: NA\n\nOil-proved reserves: 3.2 billion bbl (2004 est.)\n\nNatural gas-production: 53.66 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-consumption: 31.25 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-exports: 22.41 billion cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-imports: 0 cu m (2001 est.)\n\nNatural gas-proved reserves: 2.23 trillion cu m (2004)\n\nCurrent account balance: $11.81 billion (2004 est.)\n\nExports: $123.5 billion f.o.b.
