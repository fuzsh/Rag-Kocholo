        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nDuring the late 18th and 19th centuries, Great Britain established colonies and protectorates in the area of current Malaysia; these were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. In 1948, the British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula except Singapore formed the Federation of Malaya, which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore, as well as Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of Borneo, joined the Federation. The first several years of the country's independence were marred by a communist insurgency, Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia, Philippine claims to Sabah, and Singapore's withdrawal in 1965. During the 22-year term of Prime Minister MAHATHIR Mohamad (1981-2003), Malaysia was successful in diversifying its economy from dependence on exports of raw materials to the development of manufacturing, services, and tourism. Prime Minister MAHATHIR and a newly-formed coalition of opposition parties defeated Prime Minister Mohamed NAJIB bin Abdul Razak's United Malays National Organization (UMNO) in May 2018, ending over 60 years of uninterrupted rule by UMNO.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSoutheastern Asia, peninsula bordering Thailand and northern one-third of the island of Borneo, bordering Indonesia, Brunei, and the South China Sea, south of Vietnam\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n2 30 N, 112 30 E\n\nMap references\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 329,847 sq km\n\nland: 328,657 sq km\n\nwater: 1,190 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 68\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly larger than New Mexico\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 2,742 km\n\nborder countries (3): Brunei 266 km, Indonesia 1881 km, Thailand 595 km\n\nCoastline\n\n4,675 km(Peninsular Malaysia 2,068 km, East Malaysia 2,607 km)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation;

Under current Prime Minister NAJIB, Malaysia is attempting to achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move further up the value-added production chain by attracting investments in high technology, knowledge-based industries and services. NAJIB's Economic Transformation Program is a series of projects and policy measures intended to accelerate the country's economic growth. The government has also taken steps to liberalize some services sub-sectors. Malaysia is vulnerable to a fall in world commodity prices or a general slowdown in global economic activity.The NAJIB administration is continuing efforts to boost domestic demand and reduce the economy's dependence on exports. Domestic demand continues to anchor economic growth, supported mainly by private consumption, which accounts for 53% of GDP. Nevertheless, exports - particularly of electronics, oil and gas, and palm oil - remain a significant driver of the economy. In 2015, gross exports of goods and services were equivalent to 73% of GDP. The oil and gas sector supplied about 22% of government revenue in 2015, down significantly from prior years amid a decline in commodity prices and diversification of government revenues. Malaysia has embarked on a fiscal reform program aimed at achieving a balanced budget by 2020, including rationalization of subsidies and the 2015 introduction of a 6% value added tax. Sustained low commodity prices throughout the period not only strained government finances, but also shrunk Malaysia’s current account surplus and weighed heavily on the Malaysian ringgit, which was among the region’s worst performing currencies during 2013-17. The ringgit hit new lows following the US presidential election amid a broader selloff of emerging market assets.Bank Negara Malaysia (the central bank) maintains adequate foreign exchange reserves; a well-developed regulatory regime has limited Malaysia's exposure to riskier financial instruments, although it remains vulnerable to volatile global capital flows. In order to increase Malaysia’s competitiveness, Prime Minister NAJIB raised possible revisions to the special economic and social preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under the New Economic Policy of 1970, but retreated in 2013 after he encountered significant opposition from Malay nationalists and other vested interests. In September 2013 NAJIB launched the new Bumiputra Economic Empowerment Program, policies that favor and advance the economic condition of ethnic Malays.Malaysia signed the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement in February 2016, although the future of the TPP remains unclear following the US withdrawal from the agreement. Along with nine other ASEAN members, Malaysia established the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015, which aims to advance regional economic integration.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$933.3 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$881.3 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$845.6 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 26\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$312.4 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n5.9% (2017 est.)\n\n4.2% (2016 est.)\n\n5.1% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 37\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$29,100 (2017 est.)\n\n$27,900 (2016 est.)\n\n$27,100 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 71\n\nGross national saving\n\n28.5% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n28.3% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n28.2% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 38\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 55.3% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 12.2% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 25.3% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0.3% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 71.4% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -64.4% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 8.8% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 37.6% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 53.6% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\nPeninsular Malaysia - palm oil, rubber, cocoa, rice;Sabah - palm oil, subsistence crops;

Malaysia was not party to the March 2005 joint accord among the national oil companies of China, the Philippines, and Vietnam on conducting marine seismic activities in the Spratly Islands; disputes continue over deliveries of fresh water to Singapore, Singapore's land reclamation, bridge construction, and maritime boundaries in the Johor and Singapore Straits; in 2008, ICJ awarded sovereignty of Pedra Branca (Pulau Batu Puteh/Horsburgh Island) to Singapore, and Middle Rocks to Malaysia, but did not rule on maritime regimes, boundaries, or disposition of South Ledge; land and maritime negotiations with Indonesia are ongoing, and disputed areas include the controversial Tanjung Datu and Camar Wulan border area in Borneo and the maritime boundary in the Ambalat oil block in the Celebes Sea; separatist violence in Thailand's predominantly Muslim southern provinces prompts measures to close and monitor border with Malaysia to stem terrorist activities; Philippines retains a dormant claim to Malaysia's Sabah State in northern Borneo; per Letters of Exchange signed in 2009, Malaysia in 2010 ceded two hydrocarbon concession blocks to Brunei in exchange for Brunei's sultan dropping claims to the Limbang corridor, which divides Brunei; piracy remains a problem in the Malacca Strait\n\nRefugees and internally displaced persons\n\nrefugees (country of origin): 114,227 (Burma) (2018)\n\nstateless persons: 9,631 (2018); note - Malaysia's stateless population consists of Rohingya refugees from Burma, ethnic Indians, and the children of Filipino and Indonesian illegal migrants; Burma stripped the Rohingya of their nationality in 1982; Filipino and Indonesian children who have not been registered for birth certificates by their parents or who received birth certificates stamped \"foreigner\" are not eligible to attend government schools; these children are vulnerable to statelessness should they not be able to apply to their parents' country of origin for passports\n\nTrafficking in persons\n\ncurrent situation: Malaysia is a destination and, to a lesser extent, a source and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and women and children subjected to sex trafficking; Malaysia is mainly a destination country for foreign workers who migrate willingly from countries, including Indonesia, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Nepal, Burma, and other Southeast Asian countries, but subsequently encounter forced labor or debt bondage in agriculture, construction, factories, and domestic service at the hands of employers, employment agents, and labor recruiters; women from Southeast Asia and, to a much lesser extent, Africa, are recruited for legal work in restaurants, hotels, and salons but are forced into prostitution; refugees, including Rohingya adults and children, are not legally permitted to work and are vulnerable to trafficking; a small number of Malaysians are trafficked internally and subjected to sex trafficking abroad\n\ntier rating: Tier 2 Watch list - Malaysia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in 2014, amendments to strengthen existing anti-trafficking laws, including enabling victims to move freely and to work and for NGOs to run protective facilities, were drafted by the government and are pending approval from Parliament; authorities more than doubled investigations and prosecutions but convicted only three traffickers for forced labor and none for sex trafficking, a decline from 2013 and a disproportionately small number compared to the scale of the country’s trafficking problem; NGOs provided the majority of victim rehabilitation and counseling services with no financial support from the government (2015)\n\nIllicit drugs\n\ndrug trafficking prosecuted vigorously, including enforcement of the death penalty; heroin still primary drug of abuse, but synthetic drug demand remains strong; continued ecstasy and methamphetamine producer for domestic users and, to a lesser extent, the regional drug market\n\nFlag of Malaysia\n\nFlag of Malaysia\n\nFlag of Malaysia"
