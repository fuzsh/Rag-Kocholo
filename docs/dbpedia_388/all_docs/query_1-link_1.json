        "text": "This is a list of political parties in Malaysia, including existing and historical ones.\n\nUnder the current legislation, all political parties (termed \"Political Associations\") must be registered under the Societies Act.\n\nIn Malaysian politics, a frog (Malay: katak politik) (Sabahan: Buhangkut politik) refers to an act where a politician crosses the bench from one party to another (changing support).[1][2] This term was first coined in during the 1994 Sabah state elections after United Sabah Party losing its majority even the party won the state elections. Despite its usage nationwide, it is more familiar within the state of Sabah.[3] Since May 25, 2023, nine states of Malaysia has approved the \"Anti-Switching Parties Law\" or \"Anti-Hopping Parties Law\" for both states legislative assembly and parliament including Sabah and Sarawak.[4]\n\nThe Election Offences Act (1954) regulates the maximum expenses allowed for candidates vying for parliamentary seats and for state seats during the campaign period (excluding before the nomination day and after election day). The permissible campaign expenditure set by the Election Offences Act (1954) is RM 100,000 per candidate for state seats and RM 200,000 per candidate for federal seats. According to this guideline, with 505 state seats and 222 parliamentary seats in the 2013 general election, the maximum amount that Barisan Nasional was allowed to spend was only about RM 95 million. Due to the lack of records and regulations, Malaysian politicians may not even know how much they spent on their campaigns or overspending the expenditure than permitted by law. Another related problem was the secrecy surrounding political funds and their use. Although many politicians, including members of newly appointed cabinets, voluntarily disclosed their personal finances, such disclosure is not compulsory and many sources of revenue remain obscure.\n\nThe deposit was RM 10,000 to contest a parliamentary seat, or RM 5,000 to contest a state assembly seat. The deposit is used to pay for infringements of election laws and is returned after polling day unless the candidate loses and fails to garner more than 12.5 per cent or one-eighth of the votes cast. Additionally it is required that each candidate provide a RM 5,000 deposit for cleaning up banners and posters after the election.\n\nPolitical donations are legal in Malaysia. There is no limit, and parties are not obliged to disclose the source of the funding, which makes political donations a vague subject but still entirely legal in the country. All political donations are allowed to be given into accounts of individuals and accounts of the political party. Anonymous donors and foreigners may request to not to reveal their identities.\n\nPolitical parties are funded by contributions from:\n\nparty members and individual supporters (via membership fees/dues/subscriptions and/or local/foreign small donations),\n\norganisations, which share their political views (e.g. by trade union affiliation fees) or which stand to benefit from their activities (e.g. by local/foreign corporate donations) or\n\ntaxpayers respectively the general revenue fund (by grants that are called state aid, government or public funding).\n\nMain article: 2022 Malaysian general election\n\nThis is the list of coalitions and parties that have representation in the Parliament of Malaysia (Dewan Rakyat & Dewan Negara) and/or the state legislative assemblies, sorted by seats held in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of the Parliament of Malaysia.

In 2003 the party officially merged with Parti Keadilan Nasional to form Parti Keadilan Rakyat. Some members of the original PRM re-organised PRM as a functional political party in 2005 after some disagreement on the ideology and direction of the newly merged party, PKR.\n\nC KIMMA was accepted to become the associate member of UMNO with the obserser status on 27 August 2010.[11]\n\nD The Punjabi Party of Malaysia was established in 1986[12] but only registered with the Elections Commission in 2003.[13]\n\nE Originally registered as the Parti Demokratik Setiahati Kuasa Rakyat Bersatu Sabah, it was later renamed on 23 March 2011 when it extended its wings to Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nG Formed by former members of the original United Sabah National Organisation which was dissolved in 1991.\n\nH The party applied to change its name to Minority Rights Action Party and announced its support for the Pakatan Harapan coalition prior to the GE14.\n\nI The supposed plan to dissolve TERAS in 2016 was abandoned and never materialised.[14]\n\nPolitical parties registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS) but not with the Election Commission (EC).

Parties that were registered in British Malaya but operated solely in the territory of Singapore are also excluded from this list.
