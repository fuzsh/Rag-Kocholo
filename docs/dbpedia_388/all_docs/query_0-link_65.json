        "text": "KUCHING: Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) has proposed its president Datuk Joseph Salang Gandum as the next candidate for the Dewan Negara top post.\n\nThe party’s deputy information chief Andy Lawrence sought the support of Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, and the King of Malaysia, His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim to appoint Salang as the Senate President.\n\n“I believe it is much awaited by the Dayak community in Sarawak for continuing the legacy of first Dayak Senate President Datuk Mutang Tagal.\n\n“Due to the exceptional leadership and strong character of the late Datuk Mutang Tagal, who was notably the first member of the Dayak community to be appointed Senate President, finding a suitable replacement will undoubtedly be challenging for our top leaders,” he said in a statement.\n\nAndy said PRS would assist in this important decision by proposing Salang a candidate from the Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS) coalition.\n\n“Salang has a long history of public service and dedication to the people of Sarawak and Malaysia, having served multiple terms as Member of Parliament, and also as a deputy minister in various federal ministries.\n\n“His leadership in PRS has been marked by a commitment to development, education, and welfare,” he added.\n\nAndy said PRS is saddened by the passing of Mutang, describing him as a leader of immense integrity and dedication.\n\n“His loss is deeply felt by all who had the privilege of knowing him and working with him,” he said.\n\nIn January, Mutang became the first Senate President from the Lun Bawang ethnic group, hailing from Lawas.\n\nHe was the 20th President of the Senate and was appointed in February 2024.\n\nMutang, 69, passed away on May 10 at the National Heart Institute (IJN) in Kuala Lumpur, after receiving treatment upon returning from Azerbaijan on May 6.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Datin Ho May Leng and three children."
