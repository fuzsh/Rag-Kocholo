        "text": "And for many first-time voters, you may have a lot of questions about the processes of an election.\n\nAccording to a survey by the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS), 35% of Malaysians don't know the differences between an assemblyperson and a member of parliament (MP) , reported Free Malaysia Today in October last year.\n\nTherefore, in this article, we are going to explore the differences between a ' Dewan Undang Negeri' (DUN) and the 'Parliamen' , or the state legislative assembly and parliament in English, respectively, and the representatives of each house.\n\nWe will also explain whether there are two types of elections, and more!\n\nBefore we begin, it is important to understand how the country's governing systems work.\n\nMalaysia is a parliamentary democracy with a federal constitutional monarchy. On top of that, the country also practises a federation system. Knowing the functions of these different systems work is fundamental to understanding why and how we vote, as well as how the country is governed.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the functions of each system:\n\nMalaysia has a Paramount Ruler referred to as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. He is the Supreme Head of the Federation as well as the leader of the Islamic faith in Malaysia.\n\nThe King is also the highest commander of the armed forces. His Majesty carries out his duties under the Constitution under the advice of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.\n\nThe country has nine hereditary rulers (Sultans), who take turns to become the Yang di-Pertuan Agong every five years.\n\nMalaysia's parliamentary democracy is the separation of powers into three parts, namely the Legislative, the Judiciary, and the Executive.\n\nParliament is the country's highest legislative body. Its main function is to pass, amend, and repeal acts of law. It consists of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Senate (Dewan Negara), and the House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat).\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives are called members of the parliament (MPs), whom the rakyat elect in the General Election (GE) every five years. Yes, one of the ballots we cast during the GE is to choose our MPs.\n\nMeanwhile, members of the Senate are called senators. There are 70 of them in total, where 26 are chosen by the state legislative assemblies and 44 are chosen by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong under the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe term of office is three years for a maximum of two terms. The tenure of the Senate is not affected by the dissolution of parliament.\n\nThe Judiciary is the court system, which is independent of other fractures of powers, while the Executive is made up of the Conference of Rulers, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and the public services. The Executive governs the country according to the laws made by parliament.\n\nCabinet ministers are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong under the advice of the Prime Minister. Cabinet members must be selected from members of either houses of parliament, meaning they must be either an MP or a Senator.\n\nMalaysia is a federation of 13 states and three Federal Territories.\n\nEach state has its own constitution and an executive council, which deals with non-federal matters under a Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), answerable to elected state assemblies. Meanwhile, the governance of the Federal Territories lies in the hands of the Ministry of Federal Territories.\n\nMembers of the state legislative assembly are called assemblypersons or 'Ahli Dewan Undangan Negeri' (ADUN). Another yes, the second of the ballots we cast during the GE is to choose our assemblypersons.\n\nFederal Territories do not have assemblypersons.\n\nThe functions of a state legislative assembly, the house where assemblypersons convene, is to discuss and enact laws related to matters such as land and natural resources (except oil and gas), public facilities, social welfare, youth and sports, culture, and the administration of the state and local governments (your Majilis Daerah, Majlis Perbandaran, and Majilis Bandaraya).\n\nThe laws enacted at the state legislative assembly level only affect the jurisdiction within the state. One prime example is the Syariah or Islamic law; the states normally determine the religious law.\n\nAs for parliament, the effects of its functions impact the whole nation. Other than passing, amending, and repealing federal laws, the duties of MPs, especially those who are not aligned with the federal government, are also to facilitate check and balance of the federal government's decisions, policies, and executions.\n\nThe same can be said for assemblypersons, as their role is also to facilitate check and balance of the state government's decisions, policies, and executions.\n\nThe federal government holds various portfolios including external affairs, defence, internal security, civil and criminal law, citizenship, finance, industry, health, and education. The federal government may also make laws to promote the uniformity of the laws of two or more states and it may legislate on any subject at the request of a state legislative assembly.\n\nIn short, an assemblyperson is someone who represents you to raise local concerns at the state legislative assembly, while an MP is someone who represents you to raise nationwide concerns at parliament. One represents you at the state level, another represents you at the federal level.\n\nDuring a state election. Just like parliament, the state legislative assembly has a five-year term.\n\nSometimes, the state governments will dissolve their state legislative assemblies along with parliament to make way for both state and national polls to be held together; sometimes not.\n\nIt is the Head of State's prerogative under the advice of the Menteri Besar to dissolve the state legislative assembly. In a case like this, a state election must be called 60 days after the state legislative assembly is dissolved.\n\nFor the upcoming GE15 on 19 November, Sabah, Melaka, Sarawak, and Johor will not be holding state elections alongside the national poll because these states had held their respective elections within the past three years.\n\nPakatan Harapan-controlled states (Penang, Selangor, and Negeri Sembilan) and PAS-led states (Kelantan, Terengganu, and Kedah) will also not hold their state elections.\n\nOnly electorates in Perlis, Perak, and Pahang (Barisan Nasional-controlled states) will receive two ballot papers to vote in GE15.\n\nDuring a GE, also referred to as the national poll or national election. Just like the state legislative assembly, parliament has a five-year term.\n\nIt is the Supreme Head of the Federation's prerogative under the advice of the Prime Minister to dissolve parliament. In a case like this, a national election must be called 60 days after parliament is dissolved.\n\nThe GE15 is slated for 19 November after parliament was dissolved on 10 October.\n\nUnder the federation system, Malaysia currently has 518 assemblypersons with each state having a different number of state legislative assembly seats.\n\nWhichever political party or coalition acquires more than half of the state seats will form the state government.\n\nBelow is the breakdown of the total number of respective state seats and the number of seats required to form the state government:\n\n– Perlis: 15 (7 and above)\n\n– Kedah: 36 (19 and above)\n\n– Penang: 40 (21 and above)\n\n– Kelantan: 45 (23 and above)\n\n– Perak: 59 (30 and above)\n\n– Terengganu: 32 (17 and above)\n\n– Pahang: 42 (22 and above)\n\n– Selangor: 56 (29 and above)\n\n– Negeri Sembilan: 36 (19 and above)\n\n– Melaka: 28 (15 and above)\n\n– Johor: 56 (29 and above)\n\n– Sabah: 73 (37 and above)\n\n– Sarawak: 82 (42 and above)\n\nSinar Harian reported that only 117 state legislative assembly seats will be contested in GE15.\n\nThe political party or coalition that forms the federal government will collectively elect a candidate to become the Prime Minister.\n\nIn other words, the rakyat technically do not choose the Prime Minister.\n\nNormally, the political party or coalition will let its supporters know who is the Prime Minister candidate before the election. Through that, electorates can decide which party to vote for in the hope that the party and its coalition can grasp at least 112 seats to form the federal government.\n\nAs of the writing of this story today, 20 October, only Barisan Nasional has confirmed that Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob is its coalition's prime minister candidate."
