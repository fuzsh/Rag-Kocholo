        "text": "This work is in the public domain in Malaysia because either its term of copyright has expired, or the work is legally exempted from copyright.\n\nThe Malaysian Copyright Act 1987 applies to works first published in Malaysia (details). The periods of copyright are as follows:\n\nFor literary, musical or artistic works, copyright subsists for 50 years after the death of the author. Copyright for unpublished works subsists for 50 years after the publication. For anonymous or pseudonymous works copyright subsists for 50 years after publication unless the author is made known.\n\nFor films and sound recordings, copyright subsists for 50 years after publication. For unpublished sound recordings, copyright subsists for 50 years after the fixation. For broadcasts, copyright subsists for 50 years after the broadcast is first made.\n\nWorks by the government, governmental organisations and international organisations are subject to copyright for 50 years after publication: sections 11 and 23.\n\nRegardless of the above, the texts of laws, judicial opinions, and government reports are always free from copyright: section 3 (definition of literary work).\n\n(All 50-year durations are computed from the beginning of the calendar year next following the year in which the work was first published or made. In other words, as of 2024, works published prior to 1 January 1974 are now in the public domain.)\n\nYou must also include a United States public domain tag to indicate why this work is in the public domain in the United States. Note that this work might not be in the public domain in countries that do not apply the rule of the shorter term and have copyright terms longer than life of the author plus 50 years. In particular, Mexico is 100 years, Jamaica is 95 years, Colombia is 80 years, Guatemala and Samoa are 75 years, Switzerland and the United States are 70 years, and Venezuela is 60 years."
