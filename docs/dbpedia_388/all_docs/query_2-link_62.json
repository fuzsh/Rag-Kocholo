        "text": "GEORGE TOWN: Reforms are underway in Parliament to improve transparency and empower the youth, says Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Johari Abdul.\n\nAmong them is to reinforce the Parliamentary Special Select Committee (PSSC) to improve checks and balances in the government.\n\n\"I've raised the standard and bar whereby the committee would complement the Parliament so that matters overseen by the Parliament can be advised by the committee.\n\n\"We have allowed the committee to summon anybody for further questioning and investigation,\" he said during a press conference at the Penang State Assembly building here on Tuesday (Aug 6).\n\nJohari added that other measures taken included presentations and debates on reports by the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam) and by the Auditor-General in Parliament.\n\nHe said the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) would also present its findings in the assembly for all to take part.\n\n\"There would be no more sweeping matters under the carpet, and anything can be asked or written,\" he said.\n\nJohari said the government was also looking into increasing the functions of the Youth Parliament.\n\nHe said it is not just a concept but a physically able platform to link to the existing Parliament.\n\n\"It is participated by those aged between 18 to 35, and there are 100 members of them now.\n\n\"Once their term is over, I will increase their numbers to 220 and have proposed that they be selected and represented by each constituency in the country.\n\n\"They will convene three times a year and I hope they will be our future parliamentarians,\" he said.\n\nOther reforms to be taken include making the Parliament more accessible to the people, which Johari said it would be such as allowing the people better access to foster interest in it.\n\nJohari, who was on a working visit, was accompanied by Penang speaker Datuk Seri Law Choo Kiang.\n\nThe visit was part of his tour to state assemblies across the country before the Parliament and State Legislative Assembly Speakersâ€™ Conference in Sarawak to be held from Sept 11 to 14."
