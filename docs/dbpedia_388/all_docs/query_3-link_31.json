        "text": "JOHOR BARU: PSM is in ongoing talks with Parti Rakyat Malaysia (PRM) as part of its GE16 preparations, says PSM deputy chairman S. Arutchelvan.\n\nHe said the party would need to form coalitions with other political parties to become a ‘third force’ in the coming election.\n\n“We need to contest in one of the 222 parliamentary seats; if not, no one would take us seriously,\" said Arutchelvan when met at the officiating ceremony of the PSM 26th Congress at Dewan Taman Anggerik, Kempas, here on Friday (July 26).\n\nPSM is currently in a coalition with Muda.\n\nAt the same event, PSM chairman Dr Michael Jeyakumar Devaraj said people-centred development will be the main agenda that the Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM) will offer in the 16th General Election.\n\nThe PSM chairman added that the current government and opposition are too focused on bringing in foreign direct investment (FDI) that is more beneficial to corporations and is not trickling down to the people.\n\n“Be it Barisan Nasional, Pakatan Harapan, or Perikatan Nasional, they are too focused on the development of corporations rather than the development of the people.\n\n\"Yes, our gross domestic product (GDP) might be growing, but Malaysians are struggling to fight with the high cost of living every day; some even live in debt.\n\n“Which is why we are offering to become an alternative power that Malaysians can rely on,” he said.\n\nDr Jeyakumar added that the party also needs to work hard to build up its membership for the next 10 years so that they can become a progressive coalition with an alternate set of policies that are more focused on helping Malaysians.\n\n“We need more members in the parliament so that we can be part of the government and make changes.\n\n“We are also calling for the people not to vote for political parties that are intentionally playing with sensitive issues, just to divert the people’s attention from the main problem, which is the high cost of living,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Arutchelvan said that the congress will also see the election for the party's top six positions; chairman, deputy chairman, secretary general, deputy secretary general, treasurer, and deputy treasurer.\n\n“We are holding our election every two years, and this year’s election will focus on who will lead the party in the next two years.\n\n“The main focus is on the secretary general post, as the incumbent Sivarajan Arumugam has decided to step down.\n\n“The post will be contested by PSM workers' bureau head M. Sivaranjani and PSM Orang Asli coordinator B. Suresh Kumar,” he said, adding that PSM currently has over 3,000 members."
