        "text": "More and more each day, the Perikatan Nasional pact looks to be a more stable coalition (of sorts) than the so-called Pakatan Harapan Plus, which seems to be a “plus” in name only.\n\nWe learned on Wednesday that the parties making up Perikatan supported Bersatu president Muhyiddin Yassin. Yesterday, GPS chairman and Sarawak CM Abang Johari Openg confirmed that he had told PM Moo that the coalition of four main Sarawak parties were firmly behind his administration.\n\nThis is a rather significant statement. GPS controls 68 of the 82 state seats in Sarawak and, more importantly, 18 parliamentary seats, making it the third largest bloc in the Dewan Rakyat after Pakatan and the rest of the Perikatan pact.\n\n(NOTE: Abang Johari has said several times that GPS supports Perikatan but will not join the coalition formally.)\n\nGPS support crucial to anyone who wants to control the majority in the Dewan Rakyat and form the government of the day. As Abang Johari previously put it when revealing an attempt by Pakatan to woo the Sarawakian coalition, “when you’re good looking, everyone wants you”. Funny fellow, Abang Jo.\n\nBut there was even more proof of the stability of the coalition, even if it’s still not a formalised one. The Muafakat Nasional pact of Umno and PAS (and by extension, we guess, Barisan Nasional) announced that it endorses our PM8 as Perikatan’s PM candidate for the 15th general election, or GE15. In fact, the entire chorus of Perikatan leaders had agreed to this, according to Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) president James Masing. PRS is a member of GPS.\n\nBut that’s not the end of it. In return for GPS support (we figure), Bersatu and PAS have decided not to contest any seat in the Sarawak state election, which is due next year. This will leave the way wide open for GPS to retain control of the state and perhaps even increase their stranglehold on seats. By the way, in case you’re wondering, Umno doesn’t have a presence in Sarawak.\n\nIt’s not all a bed of roses for Perikatan, however. As we all know, there are some within Bersatu itself who are not in favour of Muhyiddin and instead support Mahathir. And politics is such that coalitions break down as quickly as they form.\n\nIn the midst of all the huzzah moments yesterday, there was also one person who wasn’t too thrilled. Umno supreme council member and one-time holder of the record for the biggest majority win in any election, Shahrir Samad, questioned his party’s decision to back MooMoo as PM candidate for GE15. The veteran politician says it’s too early to resolve the question of who should lead Perikatan into the next general election when there were other things to decide on first, such as whether all the parties would contest under one banner or their own, respective logos.\n\nWe see what he means, really we do. But, there is also an upside to deciding now, at least in our humble opinion. At a time when Pakatan Plus is still hemming and hawing over its own PM candidate, the support for Muhyiddin is a message (whether true or not) that Malaysians should choose Perikatan for the stability and unity it offers.\n\nThe Federal Court has rejected an application to set aside a ruling granting leave for the Attorney-General to initiate contempt proceedings against Malaysiakini and its editor-in-chief, and has set July 13 for the case to be heard.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling, the seven-member panel said A-G Idris Harun had established a prima facie case and had also taken into account arguments that the case should not have originated at the highest level of the Malaysian courts, ruling that since the comments published by the defendants had involved all levels of the judiciary, including the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, the apex court was the right forum for the matter.\n\nThe ruling was made after both sides submitted arguments before the panel, with defence counsels raising, among others, the point that the law does not require news organisations to pre-moderate and censor comments made by their readers on their websites.\n\nIdris had filed an ex-parte application to cite the news portal and its editor-in-chief Steven Gan for contempt on June 15 over comments left by readers on the portal’s website in this article. The comments, he claimed, had threatened public confidence in the judiciary and was clearly aimed at tarnishing the administration of justice of the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s odd about this case is that while Kini has been hauled up, there’s so far not been any action taken against those who actually made the comments. Strange, isn’t it?\n\nThis whole issue can be said to be a blow for freedom of expression and a free press, and this was pointed out yesterday by none other than Anwar Ibrahim. Saudara Anu urged the A-G to review the decision, saying that this would affect Malaysia’s global image.\n\nWe don’t always agree with Anwar, but in this case, we support him 100%. As it is, we have already come into a lot of criticism over a series of cases which have been seen as a crackdown on dissent.\n\nThese cases include investigations into journalists, opposition MPs and activists. Among these are DAP’s Hannah Yeoh, PKR’s A. Xavier Jayakumar, outspoken lawyer Siti Kasim, activist Cynthia Gabriel and South China Morning Post correspondent Tashny Sukumaran.\n\nBut as we’ve said before, part of the blame for all these investigations fall on the shoulders of Pakatan. And it’s a large part, mind you, as the coalition failed to keep its promise to either repeal or amend certain laws like the Sedition Act when it was still in power. So, yeah. Thanks Anu and Maddey.\n\nAfter the good news that there had been no local transmission of Covid-19 on Wednesday, there was even more to warm the cockles of our hearts yesterday.\n\nFor the first time in a very, very long time, the number of active cases fell below 100. With only three new cases and 62 recoveries, the total number of Covid-19 cases is now at 8,643 and total recoveries at 8,437, leaving only 85 people still considered active cases. Coupled with the fact that there is also no new fatality, leaving the death toll at 121, the recovery rate has now risen to 97.6%.\n\nBut while PM Muhyiddin has paid tribute to the nation’s medical frontliners, we are still left with that niggling fear that the numbers could be a little off, considering that many who were under home quarantine have yet to take their second Covid-19 test, a requirement on the 13th day. That number has dropped from over 1,000 to just 620, but that is still 620 too many.\n\nAs such, Kapten Batik senior minister (security cluster) Ismail Sabri Yaakob warned those who’ve yet to get their second test done to do so immediately, or police will find them and take action against them. And what sort of action is in the offing? Just the possibility jail time of up to two years in jail, paying a fine, or both.\n\nAnyway, here are some other Covid-19 news which appeared yesterday:\n\nFollowing the announcement that all students will be back in national schools from July 22 onwards, the government has now stated that religious schools will be allowed to resume operations on July 15.\n\nThe National Union of the Teaching Profession, meanwhile, has urged the Education Ministry to retrain teachers so that they can better understand and work under the “new normal”.\n\nWith preschools and kindergartens having already restarted, there are complaints about the requirement for the kids to wear face masks at all times from some parents, as these are uncomfortable and sometimes made breathing difficult. OK then. Let’s put our kids at risk, shall we?\n\nIt looks like the government has finally heard the woes of the people where electricity bills are concerned. The discount period for our power bills has been extended till Dec 31 for all domestic users.\n\nThere’s more good news. The government expects the economy, ravaged this year by the pandemic, to fully recover in 2021."
