        "text": "Paloma is the youngest daughter of Pilar and Martin. Martin had moved to Mexico soon after her birth and Pilar made the decision to send Paloma to Mexico to live with a relative because she could not provide enough for all her children and Antonio was already providing for his own younger siblings. Paloma had felt much resentment for her family after they had sent her away and did not even show much concern when Miguel called to tell her that Pilar was very ill and on her deathbed. When she returned to Harmony with Luis and Sheridan, she also learned the true identities of Bob (Martin) and Ellen (Katherine) Wheeler. She was not upset and still felt the same love for them both because they were the ones who shared her entire life together.\n\nSimone and Jessica soon became close friends to Paloma and she also started building a relationship with her mother, Pilar. She never had a problem with Simone's sexuality and was there to support her at all times. She and Tabitha also helped Jessica out when it seemed that Jessica had been killing Johns. All three of them took a journey to Rome hunting for priceless paintings. While there, they found information to connect the pieces of the puzzle together regarding an ancient chalice that Alistair had been looking for.\n\nPaloma has also started developing feelings for Noah, Jessica's older brother. The two slowly developed a relationship full of romance. All the while, she trained as a police officer, graduating to the force with kudos from her brother. Almost immediately after going on duty, however, she was placed in an awkward position when Jessica's role in the serial killing of johns, and her involvement in it, started to come to the fore."
