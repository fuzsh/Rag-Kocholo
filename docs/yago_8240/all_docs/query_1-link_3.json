        "text": "Noah hasn't spent much time in Harmony the past few years. He attended college and then went on to pursue his graduate degree...unsuccessfully. He ended up in Vegas gambling his college funds under the alias of Ned. He decided to come back to Harmony when he met Fancy Crane and barely dodged a jail sentence. When he finally made it back home he focused his attention on trying to help his sister Jessica get her life straightened out and continued to be on and off with Fancy.\n\nHis ex-girlfriend Maya came to town and that�s when the real trouble started. The pair witnessed a shooting and were ordered by the FBI to pose as a couple. He was ordered not to tell anyone the truth�even Fancy. Fancy, not knowing the truth, decided that she had been tortured enough and washed her hands of the situation. When Maya died, Noah was extremely upset, but he felt that he needed to put all of his energy into getting Fancy back!"
