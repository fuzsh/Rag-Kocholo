        "text": "A Night at The Theatre\n\nYour tickets are bought your seats are taken, the lights go down and you are ready to be entertained. The well-rehearsed talented actors, singers and dancers await backstage for their moment in the spotlight, last call is given, the audience settles and there is quiet. The lights go up, the scene is set, the orchestra starts to play the overture, it is show time!\n\nFirst Act\n\nSong 1. “Aquarius”, ‘Hair’: Special Anniversary Edition (Remastered Original Cast Recording) first recorded in 1979 Composed by Galt MacDermot.\n\n‘Hair’ debuted off-Broadway in 1967 and would open in other theatre’s across New York and then open on Broadway in 1968. There were productions that would be performed in the UK and across Europe to mix reviews. The Broadway cast album has sold 3 million to date and that does not include cast albums from other productions of the show around the world. Some of the songs off the album became top ten hits. ‘Hair’ is the story about the long haired hippy culture in the 1960’s.\n\nSong 2. “Everything’s Alright” ‘Jesus Christ Superstar’ (Remastered) 2012 performed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Yvonne Elliman & Ian Gillan.\n\nThe Original Studio Cast (1970). Composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber & Tim Rice.\n\nIn the production, Mary Magdalene sings this song to Jesus as she soothes and calms him with her singing which helps him sleep after a day of intense events… ’The story is loosely based on the Gospel’ accounts of the last week of Jesus’s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible.’ The story is taken from the oldest books, depicted on stage and film and in 1980 had grossed $237 million worldwide, an old story but a good one.\n\nSong 3.“Maybe This Time” ‘Cabaret’ (Original Soundtrack) performed by Liza Minnelli.\n\nThis song was originally written for American actress Kaye Ballard by the famous writing duo Kander and Ebb. Minnelli had auditions for the stage musical but failed to get the part. She had already recorded the song for her debut album in 1964. Minnelli won the role for the film version and “Maybe This Time” would be included in the 1972 film Cabaret with Liza Minnelli’s character Sally Bowles singing the song. It has become an anthem over the years, sung by many singers but this version seems to have held up the test of time with Minnelli’s desperate vocals, hoping this time its true love.\n\nSong 4.“All That Jazz” ‘Chita Rivera & Chicago Ensemble’, ‘Chicago’:\n\nA Musical Vaudeville (Original Broadway Cast Recording) 1996.\n\nComposed by John Kander and Lyrics by Fred Ebb. “Set in Chicago in the jazz age, the musical is based on a 1926 play of the same name by reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins, about actual criminals and the crimes on which she reported. The story is a satire on corruption in the administration of criminal justice and the concept of the “celebrity criminal”.\n\nIn the 1975 production, Bob Fosse, the brilliant choreographer chose the best dancers, actresses and singers for the roles. His work was strong and sassy which became its brand for the show. Chita Rivera had all those qualities and was chosen for the role. She has had an extraordinary career on stage, working with some of the greats such as Judy Garland and Dike Van Dyke. She has performed in films – her most memorable role in West Side Story singing one of the highlight songs in the movie ‘America’ and in Sweet Charity, she performs in the ‘Big Spender’ song and dance routine. She is a true venture, especially in Musical Theatre. She had been nominated 10 times for featured Actress in a Musical or Best Actress and received four Tony Awards. In 2009 Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 2017 the Astaire Awards was re-named the Chita Rivera Award for Dance and Choreography.\n\nSong 5. “Memory” Highlights from ‘Cats’ (1981 Original London Cast) Performed by Elaine Paige, Composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Lyrics by Trevor Nunn.\n\nThe show is based upon the poems by T.S. Eliot, ‘Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats’ Written in 1939. The character ‘Grizabella’ is the one-time glamorous cat and a shadow of her former self who has hit hard times, performed here by Elaine Paige from the original West End production. “Memory” is the climax of the musical and by far its best-known song, having achieved mainstream success outside of the musical. According to musicologist Jessica Sternfeld, it is “by some estimations the most successful song ever from a musical.” In 1982 the song achieved an Ivor Novello award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. Cats has become one of the longest running shows in the West End with 8,949 performances and in total of a 21-year run and on Broadway for 18 years. A film adaptation of Cats released in 2019 will bring more fans to its long running success.\n\nSong 6. “Circle of Life” Disney Characters, Faca Kulu, Lebo M & Tsidii Le Loka. ‘The Lion King’ (Original Broadway Cast Recording) Composed by Elton John & Tim Rice released in 1997.\n\nThe musical is based upon the Walt Disney animation released in 1994.\n\nOver 100 million people worldwide have seen the musical and it has earned numerous awards and honors, including six Tony Awards, one for Best Musical and Best Direction of a Musical, making director Julie Taymor the first woman to earn such an honor.\n\nI would hate to give too much away about the stage production but the moment you first see the animals emerge is a moment of absolute wonder and magic.\n\nSong 7. “The Music of the Night” performed by Michael Crawford, ‘The Phantom of the Opera’ (Original London Cast) Composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Charles Hart released in 1997.\n\nThe 1986 West End musical is based upon a book by the same name written in 1910 by novelist Gaston Leoux. “Its central plot revolves around a beautiful soprano, Christine Daaé, who becomes the obsession of a mysterious, disfigured musical genius living in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the Paris Opéra House”.\n\nMichael Crawford is well known in the UK as a comedian and is famous for creating the character ‘Frank Spencer’ from the sitcom ‘Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ‘Em’. With his performance on this song and his role in the musical proves that he is more than a funny man but a serious vocalist and actor who has received many accolades for his performance in Phantom, a Tony Award for the Best Actor in a Musical and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a musical. A stunning performance here by Crawford.\n\nSong 8 “Seasons of Love” taken from the musical ‘Rent’ (Original Broadway Cast Recording) performed by Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Jesse L. Martin, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Idina Menzel, Fredi Walker, Taye Diggs, Gwen Stewart & Byron Utley. Written and composed by Jonathan Larson.\n\n“The song is performed by the entire cast in the musical and in the 2005 film of the same name. The lyrics ask what the proper way is to quantify the value of a year in human life, concluding in the chorus that the most effective means is to “measure in love”. Since four of the lead characters either have HIV or AIDS, the song is often associated with World AIDS Day and AIDS awareness month.”\n\nThe musical is written by Jonathan Larson and loosely based upon Giacomo Puccini’s 1896 opera La Bohéme. It tells the story of out of work struggling artists living in the East Village in Lower Manhattan, New York, being faced with losing friends to the HIV and AIDS. Despite the topic the musical is an uplifting celebration of life and love. Rent was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony award for Best Musical and has become the longest running show on Broadway.\n\nInterval “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” ‘The Lion King’ (Original Broadway Cast Recording) Composed by Elton John & Tim Rice, performed by Lebo M.\n\nSecond Act.\n\nSong 9.“And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” ‘Dreamgirls’ (Original Broadway Cast Album – 1982) performed here by the phenomenal Jennifer Holliday. This torch song is written by Tom Even and Henry Kriegar.\n\n“In the context of the musical, “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” is sung by the character Effie White, a singer with the girl group The Dreams, to her manager, Curtis Taylor Jr., whose romantic and professional relationship with Effie is ending. She refuses to let Curtis leave her behind, and boldly proclaims to him, “I’m staying and you … you’re gonna love me.” Without a doubt you really understand Effie’s defiance for not leaving – it’s a powerful performance. Jennifer Holliday received a Grammy Award for her performance in the original Dreamgirls Broadway production in 1982 as well as a Tony Award in the same year.\n\nThe singer actress Jennifer Hudson would take on the role in the 2006 film adaptation of Dreamgirls and win an Oscar for her performance and would later perform the song at the BET Awards show with Jennifer Holliday and received a standing ovation. The YouTube video of the performance has been viewed 900,000 time as of 2011, which means by now it must have been viewed many more times over.\n\nSong 10. “Tell Me It’s Not True” ‘Blood Brothers’ performed here by Michael Ball written and composed by Willy Russell\n\n“The story is a contemporary nature versus nurture plot, revolving around fraternal twins Mickey and Eddie, who were separated at birth, one subsequently being raised in a wealthy family, the other in a poor family. The different environments take the twins to opposite ends of the social spectrum, one becoming a councillor, and the other unemployed and in prison. They both fall in love with the same girl, causing a rift in their friendship and leading to the tragic death of both brothers. Russell says that his work was based on a one-act play that he read as a child “about two babies switched at birth – it became the seed for Blood Brothers.”\n\nWriter Willy Russell is responsible for some successful and enjoyable work for example, educating Rita, Shirley Valentine and The Beatles’ musical ‘John, Paul, George, Ringo … and Bert’. It premiered in Liverpool at the Everyman Theatre and transferred to the Lyric Theatre in the West End in 1974. Russell gained much success for his Blood Brothers Musical and received many awards including a Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical.\n\nSong 11. “The Last Night of the World” performed by Lea Salonga & Simon Bowman. ‘Miss Saigon’ (Original London Cast Recording) written by Alain Boublil, Richard Maltby Jr. & Claude-Michel Schöneberg.\n\nThe musical is based upon the classic opera, Madame Butterfly created in 1904 by Giacome Puccini. It tells the story of an Asian woman who is abandoned by her American lover, set in 1970’s Saigon during the Vietnam War. The writers of this musical are also responsible for the hit musical ‘Les Misérables’. “As of July 2019, Miss Saigon remains Broadway’s thirteenth longest running show”. The set for the show is extraordinary, with lots of moving parts and sound effects that keep you excited in your seat. In the original production in 1989, actor Jonathan Pryce won a Laurence Olivier award for Best Actor in a Musical and in 1991 Lea Salonga won a Tony Award for Best Leading Actress. The show closed at the Theatre Royal, London after 4,092 performances in 1999. If it every comes to a theatre near you it’s worth an evening out to the theatre.\n\nSong 12. “Bring Him Home” This heartfelt song is taken from the musical ‘Les Misérables’ – Original 1985 London Cast Recording. Sung here by Colm Wilkinson.\n\nThis stunning musical I adapted from the French Poet and Novelist Victor Hugo’s 1862 novel by the same name. With music by Claude-Michel Schönberg and English Lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer, direction by Robert Hossein and the English adaptation by the producer Cameron Mackintosh was a recipe for an extraordinary hit musical.\n\n“Set in early 19th century France, Les Misérables is the story of Jean Valijean, a French peasant, and his desire for redemption after serving nineteen years in jail for having stolen a loaf of bread for his sister’s starving child. Valjean decides to break his parole and start his life anew after a bishop inspires him by a tremendous act of mercy, but he is relentlessly tracked down by a police inspector named Javert. Along the way, Valjean and a slew of characters are swept into a revolutionary period in France, where a group of young idealists attempt to overthrow the government at a street barricade in Paris”\n\nThis song is sung by the character Jean Valjean, it is a tender moment in this vibrant passionate musical. The reviews for the show were not always complimentary. At the opening of the London production, The Sunday Telegraph’s Francis King described the musical as “a lurid Victorian melodrama produced with Victorian lavishness”. The three-month engagement sold out, and reviews improved. The original London production ran from October 1985 to July 2019, playing over 13,000 performances and making it the second longest-running musical in the world” It’s fantastic that the show proved the critics wrong!\n\nSong 13.“Wait for It” taken from the musical ‘Hamilton’ performed by Leslie Odom, Jr. & Original Broadway Cast recording written by the talented Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nThe cast album spent 10 weeks top of the Billboard rap album charts in 2015.\n\n“Miranda said he was inspired to write the musical after reading the 2004 biography of Alexander Hamilton by Ron Cheron. The show draws heavily from hip-hop, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and traditional style show tunes, and casts non-white actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures. Miranda described Hamilton as about “America then, as told by America now”.\n\nAlexander Hamilton was instrumental in promoting the U.S. Constitution and responsible for the financial system, Hamilton became the first Secretary of the Treasury. Lin-Manuels Miranda’s musical highlights Hamilton’s life and career, from an orphaned immigrant from Nevis in the Caribbean to rising up the ladder in the United States.\n\nThe stage show has received numerous awards across the board with 11 Tony Awards.\n\nSong 14. “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life” performed here by Michael McGrath, Todd Ellison, Tim Curry & Ensemble. ‘Spamalot’ (Original Broadway Cast) 2005. Composed by Eric Idle.\n\nThe song was originally featured in the 1979 film Monty Python’s Life of Brian and Idle performed the song at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony which I am sure the whole stadium sang along to it. The musical has received three Tony Awards with many nominations. In the initial run of the show in 2005 with a total of 1,575 performances which equated to an audience of two million people, that’s a lot of happy theatre goers.\n\nBefore the show begins you hear Eric Idle giving warning from the auditorium speakers to turn off your mobile phones but if it should ring “be aware there are heavily armed knights on stage that may drag you on stage and impale you.” Be warned.\n\nFinale\n\nTrack list created by Pepsi Demacque-Crockett. Details compiled from various online references including Wikipedia.\n\nPepsi was part of the UK 80’s pop scene, a member of “Wham!” and half of the duo “Pepsi and Shirlie”. She later graced the stage in several Musical theatre productions in the UK and performed across Europe with Mike Oldfield on his Millennial Bell European Tour. She now lives in St Lucia with her husband James & dog Shabby where she is a marriage officer and writer.\n\nBob Marley, the Wailers and the Marley Family\n\nBob Marley & the Wailers started their music career as a Ska band 1963. Their first big Jamaican chart hit was with the track ‘Simmer Down’ accompanied by a backing band – The Skatalites. Bob Marley was on vocals and original band members Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer eventually learned to play their own instruments and by the beginning of the 1970’s the band was ready to take on the world.\n\nIn 1973 Bob Marley & The Wailers toured the UK and the USA as their popularity grew exponentially. While in England they performed on The Old Grey Whistle Test, the popular BBC music show. This was the first Reggae band to be featured on the Rock focused show. Their performance has been named by the influential and well-respected music magazine NME (New Musical Express) as one of the most ‘unforgettable’ moments of the shows 17-year run (1971-1988). Songs performed where Stir it Up and Concrete Jungle. Catch a Fire is referred by critics “as one of the biggest selling reggae albums of all time”.\n\n‘The song’s lyrics deal with political injustice towards blacks and poverty, as is the case in many of their albums. Catch a Fire is about “the current state of urban poverty,” and “Slave Driver – connects the present to past injustices.” But politics are not the main theme; “Stir it Up”, for example, is a love song.’ And the songs and lyrics still resonate today and carry the torch of the one love philosophy.\n\nTRACK 1.\n\n“Don’t Rock My Boat” composed by Bob Marley taken from the ‘Small Axe: The UK Upsetter Recordings 1970 to 1972’ album released in 2010.\n\nPerformed by Bob Marley and Wailers and produced by Lee “Scratch” Perry the brilliant and eccentric Jamaican producer. The Upsetters was the in-House band he used for his studio sessions. The alliance between Perry, Marley and the Wailers only lasted a year creating some great tracks and are said to be their finest work.\n\nTRACK 2.\n\n“Stir It Up” (Jamaican Version) released in 1973 and a track on the ‘Catch a Fire’ Album.\n\n“Stir It Up was composed by Marley in 1967 but it was the African-American singer Johnny Nash that made it a hit. It was a track on number one selling album ‘I Can See Clearly Now’. The single by the same name reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on November 4, 1972. Marley had four original tracks on the album “Guava Jelly”, “Comma Comma”, “You Poured Sugar on Me”, and the follow-up hit “Stir It Up”. This was one of the tracks performed on the Old Gray Whistle Test show in London that was the start of their popularity around the world.\n\nTRACK 3.\n\n“Concrete Jungle” (Jamaican Version) another track taken from the hit album ‘Catch a Fire’.\n\nThis track was the first single taken off the album released in 1973. It took reggae music out of the Jamaican dancehalls to the international stage, embarking on a tour. ‘The song’s lyrics deal with political injustice towards blacks and poverty, as is the case in many of their albums. Catch a Fire is about “the current state of urban poverty,” and “Slave Driver” – “connects the present to past injustices.”\n\nTRACK 4.\n\n“Legalize It” written and sung here by original Wailers’ band member Peter Tosh released in 1976 and taken from the album of the same name.\n\nThere was an attempt to release the track a year earlier in Jamaica, but it was banned however it got the attention of the worldwide media and who Tosh’s song International fame.\n\nIn 1974 Peter Tosh and other band member, Bunny Wailer refused to play certain venues which they referred to as ‘Freak shows’ as they felt they would be defying their Rastafarian faith if they continued to play in such venues. This did not discourage Marley, however, who continued to perform as Bob Marley and the Wailers fronting the band as lead guitarist and vocalist. There was a new line of musicians as well as the female backing group ‘The I Threes’ which comprised of Bob Marley’s wife Rita Marley, Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths.\n\nTRACK 5.\n\n“All You Got” by Ziggy Marley and the Melodie Makers taken from their 1989 album ‘One Bright Day’. This is the fourth album from the group of Bob Marleys children and it receive a Grammy award for Best Reggae Album in 1990.\n\nBand members Sharon, Cedella, Stephen and Ziggy Marley formed the band in 1979 following the footsteps of their father Bob, who encouraged the grouping, but it was only after his death they accomplished their father’s desire. Their aim was to write conscious lyrics that bought people together, keeping the one love philosophy alive. “Jo-Ann Greene of All Music Guide stated, “The Melody Makers had a breezy pop style, and while it was impossible not to hear Bob in Ziggy’s vocals, this only emphasized the incredible emotional qualities of his own voice.\n\nTRACK 6.\n\n“Small Axe” by the ‘The Wailers’ released in 1973 taken form the ‘Burnin’ album.\n\nThis was the bands sixth studio album and produced by Chris Blackwell. Blackwell was the founder of Island Records which the band was signed too.\n\nBlackwell was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 and is referred to as the ‘man who bought reggae music to the world’. Chris Blackwell was born in Westminster, London in 1937 and his father Joseph is a family member of the Crosse and Blackwell brand. His mother was a Jamaican heiress born in Costa Rica. They moved to Jamaica after his birth, but they would divorce when he 12 years. He spent his early years in Jamaica but returned to the UK for schooling at Harrow. He left school to pursue different careers, but it was managing jukeboxes which would take him up and down the country meeting the Jamaican music community that inspired him. He would pursue other work, but it would lead to nothing meaningful. He then began to license music master tapes from Jamaica and on one of the tapes was the fifteen-year-old Millie Small. He brought her over to England and produced and release her 1956 hit “My Boy Lollypop” it sold six million records worldwide and it launched island Records.\n\nTRACK 7.\n\n“Turn Your Lights Down Low” written by Minnie Riperton & Richard James Rudolph taken from the ‘Chant Down Babylon’ album released in 1999 featuring original vocals from Bob Marley, remixed and featuring an array of artists from the rock, pop and hip-hop world.\n\nThe song’s original version is on the Bob Marley and the Wailers Exodus album released in 1977.\n\nOn this track we have singer and song writer Lauryn Hill duetting with Bob. She was in a relationship at the time with Bob Marley’s son Rohan Marley – they have 5 children. Rohan was a professional footballer for a while, playing in the Canadian Football League with the Ottawa Rough Riders but would later take on the role of entrepreneur and in 2009 he became co-founder of the Marley Coffee company producing sustainable organic coffee from a farm in Jamaica’s Blue Mountain. He would also develop the ‘House of Marley’ range of ecofriendly headphones. He helps to run family charitable organisation called 1Love ,as well as the Tuff Gong Clothing company. Rohan is making waves out of the recording studio and bringing success to the Marley family in corporate world.\n\nTRACK 8.\n\n“Bend Down Low” taken from the ‘Natty Dread’ album released in 1974.\n\nThis would be the first recording without Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. ‘Natty Dread is a spiritually charged political and social statement.’ Without the original members of the band this did not hold Bob Marley back. In fact, he found strength to start producing records that would gain him many more fans around the world. This track is regarded as a ‘smooth seductive track’ with an upbeat feel and with the I Threes backing vocalists consisting of his wife Rita Marley, Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths singing sweetly.\n\nThis was not the girls first gig on the music scene. Rita had already started making music in 1964 recording tracks for the Studio One record company that the Wailers were associated with. She recorded duets with Bunny Wailer and with Peter Tosh as well as singing lead in the group called The Soulettes in the 60’s. Marcia Griffith recorded on the same label and had a hit in Jamaica with the ‘Feel Like Jumping’ and Judy Mowatt found fame in Jamaica as lead vocalist for the group The Gaylettes and later did a successful cover of the Dusty Springfield track ‘Son of a Preacher man. ‘The I-Threes released their first album as a group, Beginning, in 1986, and cut the fine Songs of Bob Marley nine years later, by which time they had removed the plural from their name as an expression of unity: they were I Three, one and all.’\n\nTRACK 9.\n\n“I Shot the Sheriff” another track taken from the 1974 ‘Burnin’ album.\n\nBob Marley wanted to use other lyrics for the song, “I want to say ‘I shot the police’ but the government would have made a fuss so I said ‘I shot the sheriff’ instead… but it’s the same idea: justice” It was Eric Clapton’s version recorded in 1974 for his album ‘461 Ocean Boulevard’ with its soft rock feel and reggae overtones that got it into the Billboard Hot 100 charts and reached number one and in 2003. It is Clapton’s cover that was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame but we all know which version is the best.\n\nTRACK 10\n\n“Waiting In Vain” is one of the most popular songs by Bob Marley and the Wailers, taken from the ‘Exodus’ album released in 1977.\n\nThe album was regarded as Marley’s cry for political change in Jamaica. Before the album was conceived there was an attempted assassination on Marley. He took exile in the UK and that’s where Exodus was recorded. ‘The album is split into two halves: the first half revolves around religious politics, while the second half is focused on themes of sex and keeping faith.’ The album became a number one hit in Jamaica as well as England, Germany and in 1999 Time Magazine named it the best album of the 20th century. You may know the featured song but it’s worth getting to know the album it came from – its Marley at his best.\n\nTRACK 11.\n\n“Who We Are” taken from the ‘Many More Roads’ album, written and performed by\n\nKy-Mani Marley.\n\nHis name is from the East African word meaning “Adventurous Traveller”. In addition to being a performer like his father, he has also competed as an American Footballer and a table tennis champion representing Jamaica. Sports was his first love, but he was encouraged to go into the studio by his brothers. He soon signed a record deal in 1996 called “Like Father, Like Son”. He is performing and standing on his own stage making waves in the charts, he is a Marley brother to look out for.\n\nTRACK 12.\n\nBunny Wailer sings “Mellow Mood” written by Bob Marley.\n\nThe reason Bunny Wailer left the group in 1973 was because he felt that the band was being asked to perform at ‘Freak shows’ in the United States. He would continue to pursue his own career in the music business reworking some of the Wailers’ songs. The album this song is taken from is called ‘Bunny Wailer Sings the Wailers’ released in 1980. He would also experiment with all forms of music from disco, pop, and dancehall. He is the only living original member of the band and still resided in his country of birth Jamaica, on a farm in St Thomas. In 2012 Bunny Wailer received Jamaica’s highest honour, The Order of Jamaica and in 2019 he was awarded the Pinnacle award in New York from the coalition to Preserve Reggae. From two boys growing up in a village in Jamaica, Marley and Wailer created one of the best-known reggae band in the world and will go down in history. One Love.\n\nTRACK 13.\n\n“Satisfy My Soul” taken from the ‘Kaya’ Album released in 1978.\n\nThis album had mixed reviews and it consisted of tracks on the Exodus album released in 1977.’ The album has a very relaxed, laid back sound, lacking much of the militant quality of the Wailers lyrically and musically. They received criticism for ‘going soft’ because of the general sound of the album, as well as the theme: songs primarily revolving around love, as well as marijuana.’ The album was also released to celebrate his welcome back to Jamaica after his exodus to the UK. His return also coincides with the One Love Peace Concert which he would be performing at. Marley was returning at a time of political civil war; he brought both parties together on stage and got both leaders of opposite sides to join hands in peace. The concert attracted 32,000 spectators who roared with joy at this historical moment. Marley became the reggae star of peace.\n\nTRACK 14.\n\nThis uplifting track is by Julian Marley taken from his album ‘As I Am’, “Family & Friends”.\n\nJulian was born and raised in England surrounded by music. He taught himself to play bass, drums, guitar, and keyboard and at 5 years old he recorded his first demo at the Marley Family home in Jamaica. He honours his family dynasty, “I feel privileged to be part of the musical roots that my father, Bob Marley, laid in England. I look forward to relate the cultural gifts and musical creations that he has bestowed on me.” Julian performed at the 2008 Olympic Games and celebrated with Usain Bolt when he won his gold medal for Jamaica. Julian Marley now lives in Jamaica creating his own path in music close to his friend and Marley Family.\n\nTrack list created by Pepsi Demacque-Crockett. Details compiled from various online references including Wikipedia.\n\nPepsi was part of the UK 80’s pop scene, a member of “Wham!” and half of the duo “Pepsi and Shirlie”. She later graced the stage in several Musical theatre productions in the UK and performed across Europe with Mike Oldfield on his Millennial Bell European Tour. She now lives in St Lucia with her husband James & dog Shabby where she is a marriage officer and writer.\n\nDIVA’S AND THEIR SONGS\n\nWhat is a Diva, some would say a temperamental entertainer, usually a female singer, who holds a high opinion of themselves? I know, this is putting it lightly. The correct terminology for a Diva is an outstanding artist, someone who can hold the audience in the palm of their hands, a phenomenal talent and an exquisite voice.\n\nSelected on this playlist are ladies you may recognise and some you will hear for the first time. Each female artist has perfected their art and are dedicated to taking to the stage and giving her audience a remarkable performance. I hope you find your personal favourite Diva on this playlist and one you may discover, either way allow these divas a moment to serenade you with a little Prima Donna thrown in.\n\nTRACK 1.\n\nOne of the finest Divas to take to the classical stage is the goddess herself Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos better known as Maria Callas, born in New York to Greek parents in 1923. She passed away in Paris at the age of 53 in 1977. She was a dramatic performer and was in demand across the globe. For years, she struggled with weight issues which may have affected her voice in later years when she decided to keep slenderer. The director of the New York Met would later say that Callas was the most difficult artist he ever worked with. “Because she was so much more intelligent. Other artists, you could get around, but Callas, you could not get around. She knew exactly what she wanted, and why she wanted it.”\n\nShe was hailed a style icon and one of the most famous and named ‘La Divina’ to this day. Here she is singing Carmen, Act I: “L’amour est un oiseau rebelle” This opera was written by Georges Bizet and was first performed in Paris in 1875. At the time shocked the audience but now entertains and delights.\n\nTRACK 2.\n\nThere is so much to choose from in the Ella Fitzgerald album catalogue. Her vocals are pure perfection on all her recordings. Here she is singing from the album, ‘Cole Porter Song Book’. This studio album was recorded in 1956 and still sounds fresh today. Her smooth delivery, her understanding of the sentiment of the song and her voice is untainted. It is a pleasure to listen to.\n\nThis song was first performed in the Broadway musical ‘Anything Goes’ and goes on to be performed by many artists. This was Ella’s first Album with Verve Records, founded by Norman Granz in 1956. Granz went on to say, “I was interested in how I could enhance Ella’s position, to make her a singer with more than just a cult following amongst jazz fans. So, I proposed to Ella that the first Verve album would not be a jazz project, but rather a song book of the works of Cole Porter”. I think Ella takes this Cole Porter song ‘I Get A Kick Out of You’ and makes it her own. The album is honoured by the Grammys and was rightly inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nTRACK 3.\n\nBillie Holiday’s ‘That Ole Devil called Love’ is a song written in 1944 by Allan Roberts and Doris Fisher. Holiday recorded this song in 1945 and it was the ‘B’ side to “Lover Man”. History shows us that Billie Holiday was a tortured soul and with every song she sang, she was able to penetrate her life experience into every vocal note. With drugs, alcohol abuse and being mistreated by some of the men in her life, her health deteriorated and she passed away on July 17, 1959. She was 44. Her career spans over 26 years and she was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1973, leaving behind an enormous catalogue of work. ‘Lady Day’ is gone but not forgotten.\n\nTRACK 4.\n\nThe album ‘Nina Simone Sings the Blues’ was released in 1967’ and ‘I Want Some Sugar in My Bowl’ was the 7th track on the album.\n\nThe song is based on a track by one of Simone’s great inspirations the mighty Bessie Smith. She did however change the lyrics to make it her own. The album was repackaged in 1991 and reissued in 2006. Nina was an extraordinary artist, classically trained from an early age and went on to create a wonderful collection of songs. She was known to be a temperamental artist; however, she gave her all when performing. Off the stage she was an activist for Civil Rights and would risks fighting the cause. You may not take sugar, but this track is one of Nina’s nice and sweet tracks… Enjoy!\n\nTRACK 5.\n\n’Your Love Is As Black as The Night’ from the album ‘My One And Only Thrill’ released in 2009.\n\nMelody Gardot had a car accident in 2003 and her way back to recovery was through music therapy. At first, she started to hum and then started writing lyrics. She healed and rediscovered her life through music.\n\nShe was discovered playing in clubs and bars in Philadelphia and was encouraged to send her demo tapes to Universal Music who released her first album ‘Worrisome Heart.’ Her vocal style is slick and intimate and this track gives you a sense of hazy late nights.\n\nTRACK 6.\n\nAnita Baker’s classic ‘Sweet Love’ from her second album ‘Rapture’ released in 1986.\n\nThis was Anita’s first big hit and would go onto win her a Grammy Award for Best R&B song in 1987. She started her musical career singing in a funk band. She walked away from the music industry and worked as a waitress but was rediscovered and encouraged to go solo. Her album ‘The Songstress’ was released in 1983 but unfortunately, there were record company squabbles regarding royalties, It took two years to settle the dispute. She went into the studio again in 1985 and created this gem of a song.\n\nI was fortunate to have seen her perform at Wembley Stadium and it was a performance I will never forget. She commanded the stage with such grace and ease that I felt I was in the presence of one of the great Diva’s.\n\nTRACK 7.\n\nNo Diva playlist is complete without the ‘Queen of Soul’ herself Aretha Franklin. Aretha Louise Franklin started singing gospel in church. Her father was a minister and at 18 he gave her his blessing to become a recording artist. Aretha’s voice became a symbol of black pride in the sixties and helped to bring black music to a new audience. The co-founder of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, says of Aretha, “I don’t think there’s anybody I have known who possesses an instrument like hers and who has such a thorough background in gospel, the blues and the essential black-music idiom…the result is maybe the greatest singer of our time.” This track ‘Spanish Harlem’ has been covered by many artists, but I am confident to say this is the best version.\n\nTRACK 8.\n\nIt’s the Academy awards in 1997 and Celine Dion performs 3 songs and one of them is ‘I Finally Found Someone’ from the movie ‘The Mirror Has Two faces’ originally sang by Barbra Streisand and Brian Adams. Barbra Striesand also stars in the movie. A few days later after Celine’s performance she receives this note from Streisand “I watched the tape afterwards, you sang my song beautifully and I regret I wasn’t in the room to hear you, next time let’s make one together. I really wish your song would have won, you are a wonderful singer”. The opportunity was taken and ‘Tell Him’ was born. Two Diva’s on one record is a double treat.\n\nTRACK 9.\n\n‘If I Was A Boy’ was written by BC Jean and Toby Gad. Inspiration for a song comes in many ways, even by eating pizza. “One day Jean and Gad visited a pizzeria in Times Square in New York City. Although tempted, Jean refrained from eating pizza because she was dieting. She then thought that if she were a boy, she would have eaten without regret. After reflecting on the idea, she concluded that she would have been a better man than her past lover. Gad captured Jean’s ideas on a pocket recorder, and they went to the studio the same day. Once there, she wrote the lyrics and melody in about 15 minutes. She then recorded the song in less than half an hour, with Gad on the guitar.” And with the diva Beyonce giving an emotive vocal touch to the track, it gets played on every radio station around the world and becomes a hit. I’m sure the writers have no regrets eating pizza.\n\nTRACK 10.\n\nSweetly sung by Witney Houston ‘Exhale’ (Shoop Shoop) released in 1985 and is featured on the soundtrack for the movie ‘Waiting to Exhale’ staring Witney Houston and Angela Basset.\n\nThe movie is based on a novel by Terry McMillian and there is talk about a sequel based on another one of McMillian’s books ‘Getting to Be Happy.’\n\nWitney Houston was mentored by Clive Davis, chairman of Arista Records from the age of 19 and later becomes recognised by the Guinness Book Of Records as one of the “most awarded artists of all time”. Witney Houston died in 2012 leaving behind a legacy of music any soul Diva would be proud of.\n\nTRACK 11.\n\nLianne La Haves was born in London and raised by her Greek father and Jamaican mother. It was her parents’ diverse tastes in music that inspired her to pick up the guitar and learn to play. She wrote her first song at 11 and continues to do so. She was a backing singer for English singer and song writer Paloma Faith. Prince became a big fan of hers and in the press, she was named his ‘Protégée’. She also supported Cold Play on their 2016 tour. ‘Bittersweet’ is taken from the self-titled album ‘Lianne La Haves’ released in 2020 after a five year hiatus. Lianne is an artist to look out for if you haven’t heard of her already, a Diva in the making in the best possible way.\n\nTRACK 12.\n\nEva Cassidy’s ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ taken from her ‘Songbird’ album released in 1998, two years after her death in 1996. ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ was made famous by Judy Garland and taken from the 1939 movie ‘The Wizard of Oz’.\n\nAfter Eva’s death Folk singer Grace Griffith sent a copy of a 5-track album to Bill Shaw, head of Blix Street Records in the US. Music was released but it took two years before it was discovered. “The song becomes a big hit in the UK after being played on Terry Wogan radio morning show, ‘Wake Up to Wogan’, which made it an overnight success and heard around the world.”\n\nEva does a beautiful rendition of this song. Her voice just shines through over the rainbow and beyond.\n\nTRACK 13.\n\n‘Cry Me A River’ was made famous by Julie London 1955 and this cover version sung by the fabulous Dame Shirley Bassey.\n\nThe song was written by Arthur Hamilton for Ella Fitzgerald to sing in the musical crime movie ‘Pete Kelly’s Blues’. Julie London and Hamilton were school mates and London’s husband, Jack Webb, the director of the movie was looking for songs for the soundtrack, but it didn’t make the cut. Ella did do a version of it for another movie called ‘Clap Hands, Here Comes Charlie’ but it was Julie London who took the song into the chart success. This is Bassey’s take on the song, giving it her Diva signature powerful vocals.\n\nTRACK 14\n\n‘Vision of Love’ written by Mariah Carey and Ben Margulies was the debut song for Mariah Carey and the introduction to the world stage in 1990, taken from the album ‘Mariah Carey’. The song stayed in the Billboard charts at number one for 4 weeks and was climbing and staying at the top of the charts globally. The song was nominated for three Grammy awards in 1991 with numerous awards to follow. This song marks the beginning of an incredible career for Carey.\n\nShe is “high-maintenance” diva – and she’s not ashamed to admit it. One of her requests “Do not speak to Mariah the day before a performance. She cannot under any circumstances speak ahead of performing. If anyone wants to communicate with her, they have to do so through writing or sign language so that she can preserve her voice.”\n\nYou must agree that hitting those high notes takes practice and has earned her the reputation as the ultimate Diva.\n\nTRACK 15.\n\nLady Gaga sings ‘La Vie En Rose’ which was made famous by the French Diva, cabaret singer Édith Piaf, she was the lyricist of the song and sung it in her formidable style.\n\nHere is Ms. Gaga singing the song on the ‘A Star Is Born’ soundtrack released in 2018. There are many Divas who have given their rendition of the song, for example Grace Jones, Donna Summer, Celine Dion and even some of guys have given their own version for example Bill Crosby, Louis Armstrong, Dean Martin and even Iggy Pop to name a few.\n\nLady Gaga takes the song and makes it her own in the movie, she sings the song in a bar scene, everyone watches mesmerised by her performance, as well as Bradly Cooper who is her love interest. In the movie she starts to sing, and he can see she is a star in the making. He takes on stage with him and his audience loves her. It’s a wonderful performance by Lady Gaga, it shows her versatility as a true pop Diva.\n\nTRACK 16\n\nChristina Aguilera sings ‘Keep On Singing My Song’ released on the ‘Stripped’ album in 2002.\n\nAguilera has a voice that holds no bounds her vocal range is unlimited. Celine Dion gave homage to her when she said, “Without a doubt Christina Aguilera is one of the most talented artist the world has ever seen and heard, and I think she’s going to continue to amaze us for many, many years to come”. On this track she truly proves that and when she sings the lyric “But I I’m gonna carry on, I’ll keep on singing my song” You truly believe it, her vocals are the embodiment of Divadom.\n\nTrack list created by Pepsi Demacque-Crockett. Details compiled from various online references including Wikipedia.\n\nPepsi was part of the UK 80’s pop scene, a member of “Wham!” and half of the duo “Pepsi and Shirlie”. She later graced the stage in several Musical theatre productions in the UK and performed across Europe with Mike Oldfield on his Millennial Bell European Tour. She now lives in St Lucia with her husband James & dog Shabby where she is a marriage officer and writer.\n\nInfluenced by the Blues\n\nThe Blues originates from the Deep South of America, rooted in the soil worked by African-American slaves. The rhythm and repetitive beat would summon forth the spiritual song; the work-song in the cotton fields and would later become the freedom song but still steeped in the pain of racial discrimination and categorised as Mississippi or Delta Blues.\n\nWith the migration of the field workers to the industrial heartlands of the northern states around Chicago, Michigan and Detroit, a more robust amplified sound evolved. These electrified blues became known as the Chicago Blues.\n\nThe rhythm of the blues resonates in all forms of music and undoubtedly without it, there would not have been rock & roll and all that followed it. The Blues has inspired artist across the globe from the likes of Elvis Presley, The Rolling Stones, Chuck Berry, The Beatles, Jimi Hendricks and Led Zeppelin and the list goes on.\n\nTrack 1.\n\nGertrude Pridgett professionally known as Ma Rainey born April 1886 in Columbus, Georgia, bought her southern blues style to the American vaudeville scene and would entertain the crowd with her ballsy risky lyrics and her sassy tone with the Rabbit Foot Minstrels Show. She was suitably titled ‘The Mother of the Blues’. Along with her husband Will Rainey she later formed the band Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues.\n\nHer first recording in 1923 was the song “Bo-Weevil Blues”. This was one of over 100 recordings she made across her career. She would return to Georgia to run her own theatres and would later be honoured in the Blues Foundations Hall of Fame. Her story has been depicted on Broadway by Whoopi Goldberg and more recently dramatised in an upcoming Netflix production with Viola Davis in the starring role. Ma Rainey is one of the most influential female blues singers of all time, inspiring many of the artists on this playlist. ‘Call Me Anything but Call Me’ is one of her classics.\n\nTrack 2.\n\nWhen talking the blues, respect and recognition must be given to Willie Dixon for writing some of the most popular Blues songs that we know and love. You will know one or more of them even if you are not a blues fan. For instance, how about ‘Little Red Rooster’ made famous by Howlin Wolf, The Rolling Stones and Big Mama Thornton (who is next up on your ‘Influenced by The Blues’, BodyHoliday Teatime playlist). This track was also covered by The Doors and Sam Cooke to name a few. ‘Bring It on Home’ released in 1963 by Sonny Boy Williamson II. Later, it was covered by Led Zeppelin, who did borrow extensively from the Blues genre. They were sued by Willie Dixon for the unrecognised use of his tracks on their albums. Eventually, “In 1987, Dixon reached an out-of-court settlement with Led Zeppelin after suing for plagiarism of his music in ‘Bring it On Home”, and the lyrics from his composition “You Need Love” (1962) in the band’s recording of “Whole Lotta Love”.\n\n“Groanin’ the Blues” released in 1957 by the mighty Otis Reading, ‘I Just Want to Make Love to You’ recorded by Muddy Waters in 1954 are just a few of the blues hits penned by Willie Dixon.\n\nHere, he is sings ‘You Shook Me’ on the 1970 album ‘I am The Blues’, and he sure is!\n\nTrack 3.\n\n‘Little Red Rooster’ Written by Howlin’ Wolf and Willie Dixon performed by the Rolling Stones and released in 1964.\n\nThe 1961 original recording by Howlin’ Wolf was in the Mississippi Delta Blues style, with its sliding guitar and harmonica, in the tradition of a one-man blues band.\n\nThe Rolling Stones famously insisted on Howlin’ Wolf being given a slot on the US show ‘Shindig!’ before they would agree to appear themselves. Wolf’s appearance on the show in 1965 has been described as “one of the greatest cultural moments of the 20th Century” that “built a bridge over a cultural abyss and connected America with its own black culture.” The show constituted “a life-changing moment, both for the American teenagers clustered round the TV in their living rooms, and for a generation of blues performers who had been stuck in a cultural ghetto’. The Rolling Stones, therefore, played an important part in introducing America to their own blues.\n\nTrack 4.\n\nOne of the ladies of the Blues and Big Mama Thornton’s Hound Dog, first recorded in 1952, written and produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller.\n\nStoller insisted that Big Mama growl on the track and she sure does. Leiber and Stoller also worked with Elvis Presley and were the writers of ‘Jail House Rock’. Elvis goes on to have a hit record with the same song that went on to sell 10 million copies – Thornton earned only $500 from the sales of the song. Big Mama Thornton was not only a vocalist, but she also played the drums and the harmonica and was the songwriter of ‘Ball and Chain’ which Janice Joplin had hit with. Joplin claimed that Thornton had a big influence on her – another hugely popular artist inspired by the Blues.\n\nTrack 5.\n\n‘Mystery Train’ written by Junior Parker in 1953 performed here by Elvis Presley and released in 1955 as a B side of the rockabilly country song ‘I forgot to remember to forget’ which was number one on the Billboard country charts in 1956.\n\nElvis was a versatile singer and could sing many genres of music with the blues being right on top of his list. The rhythm of the record gives you a sense of a train moving on the track, encouraging you to move along with it. Junior Parker worked with the legendary blues artists, Howlin’ Wolf and B.B. King, and in 1951 he formed his own band The Blue Flames, and was discovered by the likes of Turner ( of Ike and Tina Turner fame). In 1953 he signed to the independent record label Sun Records which Elvis Presley was also signed to, as well as Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Jerry Lewis. Herman “Junior” Parker in 2001 was inducted into the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame, a well-deserved accolade.\n\nTrack 6.\n\nThe Beatles’ Yer Blues’ (Esta Demo) is taken from the ‘White Album’ a double album originally released in 1968.\n\nWritten by John Lennon while in India on a retreat, “Lennon said that, while “trying to reach God and feeling suicidal” in India, he wanted to write a blues song”.\n\nYou can hear the melancholy on the track. Paul McCartney claimed that later, the song was recorded in a cupboard at EMI Studio Two’s “annexe”. Another recording on the ‘Dirty Mac’ album features a live version with John Lennon (Vocals), Eric Clapton (lead guitar), Keith Richards (Bass) and Mitch Mitchel (Drums) from The Jimi Hendrix Experience. I personally like the Tamborine that occasionally comes in on this version, listen out for it. Another supergroup influenced by the Blues.\n\nTrack 7.\n\n‘Howlin’ for my Darlin’ sung by the extraordinary Howlin’ Wolf. Born in the Mississippi Delta and eventually making his way to Chicago just as many had gone before him.\n\nWolf and Muddy Waters became rivals carving out their spot in the limelight. Both artists became revered by the likes of the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. The bands were heavily influenced by Muddy Waters voice and guitar playing and Howlin’ Wolf with his menacing stage presence, his deep vibrating vocal, harmonica wailing and guitar playing that demanded to be heard. Howlin’ Wolf died in 1976 and his name still lives on as one of the great bluesmen. The Howlin’ Wolf Foundation, based in Illinois, offers Summer scholarships for students interested in perfecting their musicianship and building a strong appreciation for the Blues in honour of this great Bluesman.\n\n“I couldn’t do no yodelin’, so I turned to howlin’. And it’s done me just fine.” Howlin’ Wolf.\n\nTrack 8.\n\nNo blues playlist is complete until you include Muddy Waters. He is referred to as “The Father of modern Chicago Blues”. His influence resonates through the rock music genre in the songs of many rock and roll greats. Eric Clapton and his band, Cream, covered one of Water’s songs, “Rollin and Tumbling”, whilst Led Zeppelin’s “Whole lotta love” is based on the Waters hit “You Need Love” written by Willie Dixon.\n\nMuddy Waters has left a legacy of 9 live albums, 25 plus compilation albums, 13 Studio albums and 17 collaboration albums.\n\nTrack 9.\n\n‘You Need Love’ released in 1963 was penned by Willie Dixon writer of so many blues hits. This is another Muddy Waters song, it is raw, wild and will get your foot tapping for sure. ‘According to Keith Richards, when asked by a journalist for the band’s name, Jones saw a Muddy Waters LP lying on the floor; one of the tracks was “Rollin’ Stone’\n\nTrack 10.\n\nJamesetta Hawkins, professionally known as Etta James, was born in Los Angeles in 1939. Etta started singing at the age of five and her vocal training came from singing in church. Her father was not present in her life whilst her mother paid more attention to her lover of the moment. However, it was her mother who encouraged her to sing. “My mother always told me, even if a song has been done a thousand times, you can still bring something of your own to it. I’d like to think I did that.” Etta James.\n\nWhen Etta sings, you can hear the hard life she has led, her full-bodied, rich voice pulls at your heartstrings. ‘I’d Rather Go Blind’ is a blues song written by Ellington Jordan and co-credit goes to Billy Foster and Etta James. In 2008 Beyonce depicted Etta James story in the movie Cadillac Records. Unfortunately, Etta slammed Beyonce’s performance from which there was no comment from Beyonce.\n\nEtta would go on to work in many genres like Blues, R&B, Jazz and Gospel leaving behind some memorable music.\n\nTrack 11.\n\nWith his bending of the guitar strings and the emotion in his voice this song is from the unmistakable B.B. King. Born on a plantation in Itta Bena, Mississippi in 1925. He would purchase his first guitar at the age of 15. As a youngster, he would play his guitar on the streets to make ends meet, with the aspiration to make his way to Memphis. He eventually moved to live with his cousin Bukku White who was a well-known blues musician at the time, with whom BB would gain tutorage, honing and perfecting his craft.\n\nThis track, ‘3 O’Clock Blues’, was BB’s 1st hit which sent him on the road with no looking back. Recorded in the ‘coloured YMCA’ in Memphis for RPM records in 1950. It paved the way for his immensely influential career that spanned over six decades. His guitar style would go onto influence Jeff Beck, George Harrison, Stevie Ray Vaughan, U2’s The Edge, and Van Morrison to name but a few.\n\nTrack 12.\n\nThe American blues-rock band Canned Heat released ‘On The Road Again’ in 1967. The song was based on a track by the Delta Blues musician Tommy Johnson. Johnson has recordings that go way back to the 1920s, he sang with a falsetto voice, which was referred to as eerie and was very unusual for singing the blues. He also inspired the band’s name which was taken from the Johnson song ‘Canned Heat Blues’ released in 1928.\n\nThe start of the track has a 60’s psychedelic feel to it, but soon kicks in with a bluesy harmonica and vocals performed by band member Alan Wilson. Canned Heat performed On the Road Again at Woodstock in 1969 and is considered one of the highlights of this famous festival. Check it out!\n\nTrack 13.\n\n‘I’m In The Mood for Love’ written by the main Bluesman himself, John Lee Hooker and featuring Bonnie Raitt. This track is taken from the 1989 album ‘The Healer’. This is an excellent recording of two artists appreciating each other in the true ‘call and response’ blues style. Hooker would go onto say “Bonnie had been doin’ it herself on her shows, which I didn’t know until she told me, and she had it down pat. She said ‘I’m gonna do that’n with you, ‘I’m in the Mood’. If I ain’t gonna do ‘I’m in the Mood’ I ain’t gonna do nothin”, I said, ‘Okay, Bonnie, you do it!” Raitt described the recording, in a dimly lit studio, as “one of the highest erotic experiences of my life.” And with that experience the song received one of the highest accolades, winning a Grammy in 1989 for the Best Traditional Blues Recording.\n\nTrack 14.\n\nAlbert King was named the ‘The Velvet Bulldozer’ due to his 6ft 4in 250lb frame. One of his first jobs involved driving a bulldozer, so his nickname suited him down to the ground. King was one of thirteen children and was born and raised on a cotton plantation in Indianola, Mississippi, where he grew up picking cotton. He made his first guitar out of a cigar box, bush and broom wire. He knew what it was like being “Born Under a Bad Sign” the title of his album released in 1967 on the Stax record label. For a time, he claimed to be BB Kings half-brother but with further investigation, his name was actually found to be Albert Nelson.\n\nKing’s success came later in life than most artists being in his mid-40s when releasing Born Under A Bad Sign. The electric blues album failed to make waves on release but over the years respect for the album grew and is now widely considered one of the greatest blues albums of all time. In recognition of this fact Albert King was inducted into the Blues Hall in 1983. He was then posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. Whilst in 2011, he was ranked number 13 on Rolling Stone Magazines 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\n\nTrack 15.\n\nGary Clark Jr. is one of the new and exciting blues artists out there right now. Born in 1984 makes him a youngster on this playlist. His style is a fusion of blues, rock, soul, and hip hop. He has graced the stage with some of the greats such as B.B. King, Jeff Beck, Steve Winwood, Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers & ZZ Top to name a few. In the recording studio he has performed on the Foo Fighters 2014 album “Sonic Highways”. Clark also co-wrote several songs with Alicia Keys and performed on Sheryl Crow’s album ‘100 Miles from Memphis’. Gary Clark Jr. is certainly a musician to look out for. On this song ‘Next Door Neighbour Blues’ taken from his album Black & Blue released in 2012 he takes us back to some old-style, stripped back blues: vocals, guitar and his stomping left foot. This pared-back rhythm keeps the track moving along and you tapping your feet.\n\nTrack 16.\n\nJohn Lee Hooker’s “Things Gonna Change” track, featuring Carlos Santana, appeared on his Chill Out album released in 1995. The album also features collaborations with Van Morrison, blues singer & pianist Charles Brown & singer-songwriter Booker T Jones. The album reached number 3 in the US Blues charts and in 1996 was awarded the Traditional Blues Album of the Year. Hooker and Santana complement each other well on this track. The Latin rock guitar fits the call and response traditional blues style, whilst a cool Latin salsa feel keeps you in the holiday mood!\n\nTracks 17.\n\nJoe Cocker’s Black Eye Blues track was taken off his 1972 album. Released as Something to Say in Europe but eponymously titled Joe Cocker in the US. This track showcases Cocker’s distinctive vocals adding a gritty vibrato to anchor the track. Cocker was, in the early part of his career, when playing pubs in his hometown of Sheffield as Vance Arnold and the Avengers, heavily influenced by Ray Charles and Chuck Berry. He later, however, became increasingly enamoured with the blues, especially artists featured on this playlist, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Howlin’ Wolf. Black Eye Blues is undoubtedly a nod of respect to these blues legends. By 1972 when this song was released Cocker had undertaken a self-imposed, almost two-year, hiatus from the music industry. This followed an eight-year rollercoaster of highs and lows that included supporting the Rolling Stones on tour, performances at iconic Woodstock and Isle of Wight Festivals and gruelling tour schedules of the US. The result of which was complete exhaustion, depression and a battle with alcoholism. Some say his personal battles gave his voice the necessary emotional resonance to really convey the blues, which when accompanied by his idiosyncratic physicality, flailing arms and playing air guitar gave his live performances a mesmeric intensity.\n\nCocker enjoyed his greatest musical successes when recording covers. The Beatles’ “I get by with a little help from my friends”, “She came in through the bathroom window” and The Box Tops classic “The Letter” which he recorded as part of the short-lived Mad Dogs and Englishmen, a touring band comprised of over twenty musicians, that legend has it caused havoc in every city they visited and hotel they stayed in. His voice remains one of the most distinctive within the popular music pantheon.\n\nTrack 18.\n\nWalking Blues, featuring Keb’ Mo’ was recorded to honour blues legend Robert Johnson’s birthday as part of the Playing for Change/ Song Around the World project. The song was made famous by Johnson although it was written and originally recorded by Son House in 1930.\n\nKeb’ Mo’ (Kevin Roosevelt Moore) is an American blues musician and five-time Grammy Award winner. He has been described as “a living link to the seminal Delta Blues that travelled up the Mississippi River and across the expanse of America”.\n\nThis rendition, of a 90-year-old blues standard classic, is given new resonance by the eclectic mix of musicians from six countries across the globe including the slide guitars played in Patagonia by Roberto Luti and Nico Bereciartua.\n\nPlaying for Change is a movement created to inspire and connect the world through music, born from the shared belief that music has the power to break down boundaries and overcome distances between people. Their primary focus is to record, and film musicians performing in their natural environments and combine their talents and cultural power in innovative videos they call Songs Around the World.\n\nTrack list created by Pepsi Demacque-Crockett. Details compiled from various online references including Wikipedia.\n\nPepsi was part of the UK 80’s pop scene, a member of “Wham!” and half of the duo “Pepsi and Shirlie”. She later graced the stage in several Musical theatre productions in the UK and performed across Europe with Mike Oldfield on his Millennial Bell European Tour. She now lives in St Lucia with her husband James & dog Shabby where she is a marriage officer and writer.\n\nIt’s Motown!\n\n“Hitsville U.S.A” still stands in Detroit as a museum and holds memories of the most successful soul music label of its time. The building was originally purchased by the founder of Motown records Berry Gordy in 1956, where hits where made and wannabes became stars. The building was opened 22 hours a day. It was a music machine, making records that we know, love and have held the test of time.\n\nGordy launched the careers of Marvin Gaye, The Supremes, Four, Tops, Gladys Knight & the Pips, The Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, and this is just naming a few of the acts. Gordy wanted to create music that everyone could enjoy. It was popular music for all.\n\nOn this playlist is a selection of songs I love, and I hope you love to! There are songs that are familiar or unfamiliar but at the end of the day It’s Motown!\n\n“Motown was about music for all people, white and black, blue and green, cops and the robber. I was reluctant to have music alienate anyone.”\n\nFounder of Motown Records\n\nBerry Gordy\n\nTrack 1.\n\n“Every Little Bit Hurts” beautifully sung by Brenda Holloway composed by Ed Cobb and released in 1964.\n\nHolloway was an accomplish musician and from an early age, she could play the piano, flute and violin. She was very keen on classical music. At 14, she began singing as a backup singer. She released her first single in 1962 and in 1963 she met Berry Gordy at a party in her hometown of Los Angeles. Gordy was looking for acts to sign and watched Holloway lip sync to the Mary Wells hit “You Beat Me to The Punch”. Gordy was impressed by her and soon discovered that Holloway was a talented musician, and he was keen to sign her to Motown Tamla division as she wanted to stay in LA and not move to Detroit. Holloway had already recorded Every Little Bit Hurts as a session vocalist and was not keen on the song, but with much persuasion from the producer she would go into the studio and record the song again, which would become a hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Her relaxed vocal has a maturity to it that floats through the song. Brenda Holloway was 17 years old when she recorded this track.\n\nTrack 2.\n\n“The Tracks of My Tears” performed by ‘Smokey Robinson & The Miracles’ taken from the 1964 album Going to a Go-Go.\n\nThis original version of the song has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, deemed a “Song of the Century” and listed by the Rolling Stone Magazine’s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at number 50. The song was written by Smokey Robinson, Pete Moore, and Marv Tarplin. Robinson shares how the track was written by saying, “Tracks of My Tears’ was actually started by Marc Tarplin, who is a young cat who plays guitar for our act. So, he had this musical thing [sings melody], you know, and we worked around with it, and worked around, and it became ‘Tracks of My Tears’.”\n\nThe Miracles was the first act that Gordy signed to Tamla Records (he later reincorporated it as Motown) and they would record the first million selling record on the label. The track was called “Shop Around”. As lead singer, chief songwriter and producer, Robinson would create 26 top forty hits with the Miracles. Robinson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and was awarded the Library of Congress Gershwin prize for his lifetime contributions to music.\n\n“Once you’re a Motown artist, you’re always a Motown artist” Smokey Robinson\n\nTrack 3.\n\n“No Time for Tears” was released in 1965 and performed by the ‘The Marvelettes’.\n\nThis all-American girl group signed their first deal with Motown and became as successful as Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, especially with their single “Please Mr. Postman”, which became a number one hit for the group. The Marvelettes would lose their position as the number one female group once The Supremes started to release their hits. This caused much rivalry with the two groups, but we know which female group that would take the number one position.\n\nSongs were created in-house at Motown and Marvin Gaye is known to have played drums on most of the early records, while Smokey Robinson would become songwriter for some of the up-and-coming acts. There were session musicians who would work the backing tracks and helped create the distinctive Motown sound. In 1959 these musicians gave themselves the name ‘The Funk Brothers’ and they became the most successful studio group, creating hits like ‘My Girl, ‘I heard it through the Grapevine’, Ain’t No Mountain High Enough’ and the list goes on. There is the 2002 documentary film Standing in the Shadow of Motown which is worth a watch as you get to discover the secret behind the Motown sound. The Funk Brothers, in 2007 got inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and museum – a well-deserved accolade.\n\nTrack 4.\n\n“He Was Really Sayin’ Something” performed by the Motown girl group ‘The Velvelettes’. Their original version of the song was released in 1964. The British girl group Bananarama had a big hit with this track in 1982.\n\nThe Velveletes where a girl group of friends and family and it was a classmate at university which happened to be Berry Gordy’s nephew, who encourage the group to auction for Motown. They signed to the label in 1962 and began recording in 1963. On some of their recordings, they had the youngster, Stevie Wonder, play harmonica. It was their track “Needle In A Haystack” that got them noticed and onto the Billboard Hot 100 charts.\n\nTrack 5.\n\n“A Place In The Sun” performed by the talented Stevie Wonder was released in 1966 and composed by Paul/Wells/Miller. Ronald Miller was also responsible for writing Wonder’s classic hit “For Once in My Life”.\n\nStevland Hardaway Morris professionally known as “Stevie Wonder” signed to the Motown label at the age of 11 years old and despite being blind this did not take away his love for music. He became a great musician and grew from “Little Stevie Wonder” to the Wonder we know today. In 1963 he had his first big win with the single “Fingertips”. At the time, he was 13 years old, which made him the youngest artist ever to top the charts.\n\nThe 1970’s was an extraordinary time for Soul music as new sound were being experimented with. Stevie Wonder was ahead of the game and in 1972, he released Music of My Mind, Talking Book, his 1973 album Innervisions and Songs In the Key of Life released in 1976. He was awarded a Grammy for his last three albums and became the only artist to do so.\n\nWonder’s music has evolved over the years. He really comes into his own with his conscious lyrics and his distinctive synthesizer sound which has inspired many musicians and performers over the years and will continue to do so for many years to come.\n\nTrack 6.\n\nThe dulcet tones of the wonderful ‘Marvin Gaye’ singing “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” taken from his ‘In the Groove’ album released in 1968.\n\nThe song was written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong. It was recorded by The Miracles in 1966 and recorded by Gladys Knight & the Pips, their version was number two in the charts in 1967 and became one of Motown’s biggest selling singles at that time. Marvin Gaye’s version was spotted by the radio D. J’s and with much persuasion Berry Gordy released it. This track would remain in the Pop singles charts for seven weeks and would become another mega hit for Motown and has become a soul classic. Rolling Stone Magazine lists it at 81 in their ‘500 Greatest Songs All Time’.\n\nMarvin Gaye tragically died in 1984 on his 45th Birthday, he was shot by his father at his home in Los Angeles while in an argument. His music still lives on. He would receive many accolades during and after his passing, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, he was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIt’s hard to choose from Marvin Gaye’s catalogue of work because every track is a gem, and I am sure if you take a listen to his music you will find your favorite.\n\nTrack 7.\n\n‘The Jackson Five’ perform “Who’s Lovin’ You” release in 1969 and composed by Smokey Robinson in 1966.\n\nThis track has been covered by many artists over the years including The Supremes, Terence Trent D’arby, and Michael Bublé to name a few, but it’s the Jackson Five’s version which made this track a hit, and no Motown list is complete without the Jackson Five. With the young Michael Jackson’s powerful lead vocals and with brothers Marlon, Tito, Jermaine, Jackie on backing vocals, accompanied by the Funk Brothers band makes it a classic Motown hit. When the Jackson Five performed the song at live concerts the audience would go wild “Michael usually gave an intro about being really young but knowing about the blues, also stating how he met the girl in a sandbox while sharing cookies and ended in “I stepped up to her and I said…” the song started from there. The fans must have loved it!\n\nTrack 8.\n\n‘The Supremes’ perform “Come See About Me” composed in 1964 by the famous writing team Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier & Edward Holland Jr.\n\nThis trio composed some of Motown’s defining hits such as Stop in The Names of Love, Baby Love, You Keep Me Hanging On’. “Come See About Me” by The Supremes would replace the Beatles at the top of the American Billboard Hot 100 pop charts. Holland, Dozier, and Holland Jr. would later get inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1988 and the Rock and Roll of Fame in 1990.\n\nThe Supremes became Motown’s most successful female singing group during the 1960s with 12 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 charts under their belt. The band was originally called the ‘Primettes’ then became The Supremes and renamed by Berry Gordy, Diana Ross and The Supremes, with group members Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard. There were issues starting to form in the group about Ross receiving lavish attention from Berry Gordy. Florence Ballard started not turning up for shows and began to show signs of depression and alcoholism. There were replacements for Ballard but they came and went. Ballard would return for a short while making efforts to stay off the booze and look after herself, but this was short lived. Singer Cindy Birdsong who had previously been part of the girl group Patti LaBelle and the Bluebells was being groomed to take her place. Diana Ross eventually left the group and gain hits of her own as a solo artist. Florence Ballard sued Motown for royalty payments, but unfortunately did not win her case. She would shy away from the spotlight despite being enticed back on stage by her Supremes’ band member Mary Wilson. Ballard died in 1976. A sad end to so much promise but regardless of the sad loss of Ballard, the arguments, and disappointments, The Supremes have received many accolades in the form of Grammy Awards, nominations and a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and have inspire many girls to start a group.\n\n“The Beatles were there,” said Madonna of her childhood, “but I was more eager about The Supremes. I was really into girl groups.”\n\nTrack 9.\n\n“My Guy” was a Motown’s hit single in 1964 and another chart-topping song written by ‘Smokey Robinson’ and performed by Mary Wells.\n\nAt the age of 17 years old, Well’s approached Motown founder Berry Gordy in a club in Detroit and sang a song which she had written for the soul singer Jackie Wilson. Wells knew Gordy had worked with Wilson. Gordy asked her to sing at a surprise audition. He was impressed by her singing and the song she had written, called “Bye Bye Baby”. Wells would record the song herself and sign to Motown. “Bye Bye Baby” was released in September 1960 and it reached number eight in the Billboard R&B charts the following year. Unfortunately, Motown released a succession of records that did not hit the charts as “Bye Bye Baby” did for Wells, so Gordy asked Smokey Robinson to work with Wells, creating one of her biggest hits called “My Guy”. Mary Wells soon earned the title as the “First Lady” of Motown Records as she helped to define the sound and became one of the main acts to bridge the colour gap at the record stations and record stores for Motown Records.\n\nTrack 10.\n\n“(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave” performed by ‘Martha Reeves and the Vandellas’ released in 1963.\n\nWritten by the hit making team Holland-Dozier-Holland. This classic Motown track has all the elements of a Hitsville song… Handclaps, Tambourine, Girlie backing vocals, a great sing along melody, with a strong lead vocal and a beat that gets you toe tapping – Classic Motown. There are many versions of this track, but I think this is the best original version by the girl group, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. The song reached number 4 in the Billboard Hot R&B charts and would stay in the charts for 8 weeks and reached number 8 in the Billboard Hot 100, also selling a million copies. American singer Linda Ronstadt released the track which was taken from her 1975 ‘Prisoner in Disguise’ album and it arrived at number 5 in the Billboard Charts. In 1969 Martha Reeves and the Vandellas released the single “Dancing in the Streets” and it reached number 2 in the Billboard Hot 100 charts and would reach number 4 in the U.K. charts – Another million-seller!\n\nWith the success of the group also came disagreements and the group disbanded. Reeves would also take Motown to court for outstanding royalties. She won the case and the other members of the group (Rosalind Ashford and Annette Beard) would do the same. During this time, the original trio were inspired to reunite both as a recording act and in performances. They were offered a recording contract with Ian Levine at Motorcity Records who issued the group’s first single since the Vandellas disbanded seventeen years earlier called “Step into My Shoes.” They continue to perform for their fans and never disappoint.\n\nTrack 11.\n\n“Your Precious Love” performed by Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell.\n\nThis track was released in 1967 and composed by the husband-and-wife team Valerie Simpson & Nickolas Ashford.\n\nThis top 10 track was taken off the ‘United Album’ and would release a series of hits such as “If I could Build My Whole World Around You”, “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” and “If This World Was Mine”. Writing duo Ashford and Simpson started their career in the 1960’s and began writing songs for Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and in 1966 Berry Gordy called upon their writing skills to work with Gaye and Terrell. Ashford and Simpson would also write songs for Diana Ross, Gladys Knight and the Pips, and they would also have their own recording careers under the name ‘Ashford & Simpson’.\n\nIt was 1967 when Motown Records hired Tammi Terrell to duet with Marvin Gaye. Terrell was not a newbie to the music industry and already had a recording contract with the Scepter/Ward label, had performed as a member of James Brown’s Revue and signed to his Try Me label. She would gain much success performing with Marvin Gaye but when performing at a concert in 1967 she collapsed in Marvin Gaye hands. She was diagnosed with a brain tumor. She had eight surgeries that proved unsuccessful and she died in March 1970 at the age of 24. Marvin Gaye never got over her death. According to several biographers, Terrell’s death led Gaye to depression and drug abuse. In addition, Gaye’s classic album What’s Going On, an introspective, low-key work which dealt with mature themes released in 1971, was in part a reaction to Terrell’s death.\n\nTrack 12.\n\n“I Can’t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)” released in 1965 performed by the mighty ‘Four Tops’ composed by Holland–Dozier–Holland.\n\nIn the early days of Motown, the Four Tops recorded Jazz standards for the Workshop Jazz Records (a subsidiary of the Motown label) covering jazz standard songs. They would also do backup vocals for the up-and-coming acts like The Supremes and Marta and the Vandellas. The Motown writing team Holland-Dozier-Holland created instrumental tracks awaiting lyrics and melody ideas. One of the backing tracks inspired the Four Tops, and they produced one of their hit songs from the instrumental, “Baby I Need Your Loving” and in 1964 it would reach number 11 in the Billboard pop charts. No longer doing jazz standards, the band became the radios stations favourite around the world.\n\nThe founding members of the ‘Four Tops’ are lead singer Levis Stubbs, Abdul “Duke” Fakir, Renaldo “Obie” Benson and Lawrence Payton, who performed together from 1953 until 1977. The ‘Four Tops’ are one of the groups that helped to establish the distinctive Motown sound. This track became a number 1 hit as well as “Reach Out I’ll Be There” (1966). The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked them 79 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Group member Lawrence Payton died in 1997 after performing with his group for 44 years. They continued performing under the new name ‘The Tops’ but in 1988 they recruited Theo Peoples who was a former member of the Temptations and renamed themselves again as the ‘The Four Tops’ with new members replacing original members of the band over the years ‘The Four Tops’ still continue to perform for their and sounds good as ever.\n\nTrack 13.\n\n“Shotgun” performed here by ‘Junior Walker & The All Stars’ and was released in 1965, composed by Autry DeWalt (Junior Walker) and produced by Berry Gordy and Lawrence Horn.\n\nThis track was the band’s first hit on the Motown label, reached number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts and became number 1 on the R&B charts. They would also play back up for The Supremes on their hit “Come See About Me” and for Marvin Gaye on his track “How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)”. The band had another hit in the year of 1969 with “What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)” which was first rejected by Motown but the radio DJ’s loved it and it reached number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the R&B charts – Junior Walker & The All Stars were on a roll. The last hit was in 1972 but Junior Walker was a multi-instrumentalist and was called upon to tour and do back up for bands playing his saxophone and occasional backing vocals. He went on tour with Wilson Pickett to the U.K. and in the later years (1980) toured and recorded with the band Foreigner.\n\n“Shotgun” was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002, a well-deserved entry.\n\nTrack 14.\n\n“Money (That’s What I Want)” performed by ‘Barrett Strong’ composed by Janie Bradford & Berry Gordy Jr.\n\nThis was the first hit record for the Motown enterprise, recorded in 1959. There were artists that recorded the song such as The Beatles in 1963 and The Flying Lizards in 1979. The song was inspired when Gordy and Strong started improvising on the piano and coming up with vocal ideas, a drum pattern was added, and that Motown tambourine sound was introduced by songwriter Brian Holland.\n\nThis single became Motown’s first hit in June 1960, making it to number two on the Hot R&B charts and number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was listed as number 288 on Rolling Stone’s “The 500 Greatest Songs of Al Time”. Greil Marcus American author, music journalist and cultural critic pointed out that “Money” was the only song that brought Strong’s name near the top of the national music charts, “but that one time has kept him on the radio all his life.”\n\nTrack 15.\n\n“Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)” performed by Marvin Gaye and composed by Marvin Gaye/James Nyx. Released in 1971.\n\nIt’s the 1970’s and America is going through an economical downfall, the streets of New York are bleak, dirty and folks in the ghettoes are poor and creating the inner-city blues. This track depicts the feeling on the New York streets so well and it is a track on the classic Marvin Gaye album ‘What’s Going On’. Co-writer James Nyx in 1988 recalls the inception of the song, “Marvin had a good tune, sort of blues-like, but didn’t have any words for it. We started putting some stuff in there about how rough things were around town. We laughed about putting lyrics in about high taxes, ’cause both of us owed a lot. And we talked about how the government would send guys to the moon, but not help folks in the ghetto. But we still did not have a name, or really a good idea of the song. Then, I was home reading the paper one morning, and saw a headline that said something about the ‘inner city’ of Detroit. And I said, ‘Damn, that’s it. ‘Inner City Blue’.” The song helped Gaye make history by being one of the few artists to have three or more Top 10 songs off Billboard’s Pop Singles chart peaking at number 9 and one of the first to have three consecutive number 1 hits on Billboard’s R&B Singles chart where it stayed for two weeks. Although not certified by the RIAA at that time, all three releases from the What’s Going On album gained Gold status by selling over 1,000,000 copies in the United States. It’s a must have album.\n\nTrack 16.\n\n“It’s a Shame” performed by the ‘Spinners’ and first-time producer Stevie Wonder and co- written with Syreeta Wright Lee Garrett.\n\nThe group was signed to Motown in 1964 with not much success. Motown signed them to jobs as managers, chaperones and chauffeurs, but things changed for the group in 1970 when “It’s a Shame” was recorded and released. It reached number 14 in the Billboard Hot 100 and number 3 on the R&B charts and this became their biggest hit.\n\nThe ‘Spinners’ hail from Ferndale, Michigan and formed in 1954. The original line up of the band are Pervis Jackson, Henry Fambrough, Billy Henderson and Bobby Smith and on lead vocals G.C. Cameron.\n\nThe group left Motown after a 2-year contract and signed to Atlantic Records. It was Aretha Franklin that encouraged them to leave the Hitsville family. Franklin was also signed to Atlantic label. Lead singer G.C. Cameron who was having an affair with Berry Gordy’s sister (Gwen) decided to stay with Motown and would relocate with the label to Los Angeles. Cameron did rejoin the band as lead vocalist again between 2000 to 2002 but left in 2003 and joined The Temptations. In 2003, Elton John had the ‘Spinners’ do backup vocals for him on his re-issued track “Are You Ready for Love”. This release it put the ‘Spinners’ back in the limelight and have never looked back since and are still performing today.\n\nTrack 17.\n\n“Back To Black” performed by Amy Winehouse and co-written with producer Mark Ronson, released in 2007.\n\nThis track has all the elements of the Motown sound and reminiscent of the Phil Spector girl groups which was also inspired by Motown.\n\nThe inspiration for the song was the Winehouse’s breakup of her relationship with partner Blake Feilder-Civil. She would go to a dark place of relying on drink and drugs which unfortunately lead to her demise. Tim Chester from the NME (the popular British music magazine) wrote that “Back to Black” was a song by which the singer should be remembered following her death, with Motown influence in her trademark vocal performance along with its powerful lyrics”. Mark Ronson received a Grammy Award for his production on the ‘Back to Black’ album. Ronson has received many accolades over the years but he does take time to give back to those aspiring musicians and producers for example, he is the patron of the Amy Winehouse Foundation which help disadvantage youth through music.\n\nAmy Winehouse was a guest at BodyHoliday and she enjoyed other parts of our beautiful island of St Lucia. With her passing she has left behind some great music that still encourages you to listen. She was a light that dimmed too quickly – Her music lives on.\n\nTrack 18.\n\n“Papa Was a Rolling Stone” is the epic Motown track performed by ‘The Temptations’ released in 1972.\n\nThe original version was performed by ‘The Undisputed Truth’ another Motown act and was released in 1971 which did not do too well in the charts. The song was written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong. Whitfield decided to create a 12-minute track of the song with the Temptations. This version would go to number 1 and received three Grammy Awards in 1973. Creating the track, it did not go without disputes. the group did not like the fact the instrumentation was getting more emphasis than their vocals and Whitfield demanded that vocal parts to be sung over and over again causing upset in the group, but to make up for Whitfields treatment he agreed to write a ballad for the group. After the treatment of the group in the studio he was dismissed as their producer. Sometimes you must suffer for your art and with this track it was worth it. It’s a classic 1970’s soul anthem, its Motown at its best with its powerful vocals and fabulous backing track. This is the single version, it is with checking out the 12-minute version too …Enjoy.\n\nTracklist created by Pepsi Demacque-Crockett.

There would be a rare moment when you would get to see a Reggae artist on the U.K. show, Top of The Pops. His or her single would be played repeatedly by the West Indian community in north west London. There was a growing British fan base, slowly bubbling up and showing an appreciation for this sweet Reggae sound.

This playlist calls for a rum punch … Enjoy!\n\nTrack 1.\n\n“My Boy Lollipop” performed by ‘Millie’ Millie Small was discovered by the founder of Island Records Chris Blackwell. In an interview in 2010 he shared how he came about this fun hit song. “I would go to New York now and again and buy records and sell them to the sound system guys in Jamaica. One of these records was the original version of ‘My Boy Lollipop’, but I’d make a copy of each one on a reel-to-reel tape. It was before cassettes, and when I brought Millie over to England I sat down trying to work out if we can find a song for her and I found this one which had the original version of ‘My Boy Lollipop’ and I said, ‘that’s the song we should do,’ so it was really lucky that I found the tape”!\n\nIn 1964 this song became a big hit in the UK and America and would make Millie a household name.\n\nTrack 2.\n\n“007 (Shanty Town)” written and performed by ‘Desmond Dekker and the Aces’ -released in 1967 which is referred to as ‘Rock Steady’ which is a successor of Ska and precursor to reggae.\n\nDekker was Inspired to write the song after seeing a student’s demonstration against plans to build an industrial complex on the beach. “And it just gets out of control…Is just a typical riot ‘cause I say – Them a loot, them a shoot, them a wail.”\n\nDesmond Dekker was born in Jamaica in 1941. He became an apprentice tailor in his teens but soon put that profession aside and became a welder. While at work, he would sing his way through the day and his co-workers encouraged him to pursue a career in music. In 1961, he secured an audition with Coxone Dodd of Studio One, which was referred to as the Motown of Jamaica. However, it was Leslie Kong, the Chinese-Jamaican producer that offered Dekker a record deal. He would go onto have other international hits with “Israelites” (1968). “It Mek” (1969) and “You Can Get It If You Really Want”(1970). His other claim to fame is that he introduced one of his fellow workers to Kong who happen to be Bob Marley and now the rest his history.\n\nTrack 3.\n\n“The Harder They Come” written and performed by Jimmy Cliff. This song was recorded for the soundtrack for the movie of the same name. Rolling Stone magazine has included this song in its “500 Greatest Songs of All Time”.\n\nJimmy Cliff would star in the 1972 movie, “The Harder They Come”, and it was during filming he came up with the title. Director, Perry Henzell, said it was a great name and Cliff was inspired to write and record the theme tune.\n\nFrom an early age Cliff just wanted to make music and he used all his confidence to get him there. Life changed when he approached the now influential Chinese-Jamaican producer. “One night I was walking past a record store and restaurant. As they were closing, I pushed myself in and convinced one of them, Leslie Kong, to go into the recording business, starting with me.” After two singles that failed to make much impression, his career took off when his record “Hurricane Hattie” becoming a hit, while he was aged 14. It was produced by Kong, with whom Cliff remained close until Kong’s death from a heart attack in 1971.\n\nKong makes a cameo appearance in the film, The Harder They Come, playing a recording engineer in a scene in which Jimmy Cliff’s character watches a studio recording session, by Toots and the Maytals, of the song, “Sweet and Dandy” which Kong produced.\n\nTrack 4.\n\n“I Can See Clearly Now” written and performed by Johnny Nash.\n\nNash was born in Houston, Texas and grew up singing in the choir and in 1953 he got the opportunity to sing cover songs on the local variety show Matinee.

The title was a phrase I used to say. If someone done me wrong, rather than fight them like a warrior, I’d say, ‘The pressure’s going to drop on you.”\n\n— Frederick ‘Toots’ Hibbert, The Guardian\n\nFront man Toots Hibbert is considered a Reggae pioneer, with his soulful vocals he has been compared to Otis Redding. Rolling Stone Magazine named Toots as one of the 100 best singers. In 1968 Toots sings “Do the Reggae”. This was the first song to use the term “Reggae” which introduced it to the world and in the Oxford English Dictionary, Toots and The Maytals get the credit for doing so. Founder of Island Records Chris Blackwell says “The Maytals were unlike anything else … sensational, raw and dynamic.” Toots Hibbert passed away in 2020 leaving behind some great music which will get played by old and new fans for years to come.\n\nTrack 6.\n\n“Put It On” performed by ‘Bob Marley and Wailers’ was a track on the ‘Soul Revolution’ album released in 1988.

He was renowned for remixing albums and creating a new instrumental version. There is a ‘Soul Revolution II’ where he has done just that. Perry has worked with many of his fans such as the British band, Clash, The Beastie Boys and The Orb.\n\nJamaican born, Earl “Paul’ Douglas, Grammy award winning drummer and percussionist of the band, Toots and The Maytals, would say of Perry “Scratch had a particular sound and everybody was fascinated by his sound. He had this way of putting things together; it was just his sound and it influenced a lot of people”.\n\n“Put it on” has a sedate feel to it, with sweet harmonies very reminiscent of harmony groups from America which were very popular across the Carribean but as now we know Bob Marley and Wailers soon found their unique sound.\n\nTrack 7.\n\n“Good Thing Going” performed by ‘Sugar Minott’ taken from the 2011 album ‘Reggae Anthology: Sugar Minott – Hard Time Pressure’.

It was written by The Cooperation who were a group of songwriters and producers who created music for the Motown label.\n\nMinnott started his musical career in 1969 with the group the African Brothers. They would release records in Jamaica which gained local popularity but Minott left the group to work with Jamaican producer Clement “Coxone” Dodd as a studio apprentice at the Dodd’s Studio One. This is where he discovered his talent for song writing. Using backing tracks from existing songs he would write new lyrics. His new lyrical compositions became more popular than the original songs. It was the cover of “Good Thing Going” that got Minott in the top ten charts in the U.K and would later secure him with an album deal. Minnott could cover all styles of reggae music including “Lover Rock” which is more of a romantic sound and became popular on the reggae scene in London in the 1970’s.

This would have been his 27th arrest due to being involved in drug dealing. With his release in 1983 he would release his second album on the Island Records label called “Out Deh!”. Despite his bad boy troubles, he released tracks that would become hits and in 2008 Isaacs released the studio album ‘Brand New Me’.

Levy performed in the Jamaican dancehalls from an early age and his claim to fame came by working with the sound systems, but he would not get the credit where it was due for his performances, which were recorded and released without his consent. He described it as a “joke business”. By the 1980’s Levy was becoming a big reggae star across the globe especially in the U.K. He would make his debut as a producer of his album ‘Run Come Ya’ which became an underground hit. In 1993 Levy tried to break into the U.S. with the ‘Barrington Album’ produced by the duo Sly & Robbie but it did not give him the breakthrough he wanted,"
