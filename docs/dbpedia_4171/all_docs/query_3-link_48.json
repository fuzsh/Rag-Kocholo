His \"Who's Next\" is still is to this day the go to disc for this album.\n\nRick A.\n\nWasn't Barry Gibb's 'Now Voyager' one of the first MCA CDs in 1984?\n\nI didn't read the article, but I would be very surprised if the chronology actually was that the CD was released, and THEN sometime down the line the vinyl and cassette were released. If anything, it would be the other way around.\n\nBack then it was either simultaneously or the vinyl and cassette preceded the CD. I'm not sure I've seen it before where the CD was released first, followed by vinyl and cassette. Just my two cents.\n\nSome of (maybe all) of the earliest MCA CD's (for release in the U.S.) were pressed by CBS/Sony Japan and have DIDX numbers on the inserts and CD's.\n\nSteely Dan's Aja is DIDX 55, for example. I think Steely Dan's Gaucho is DIDX 56. That would be a pretty easy way to find out which were the first releases, if you could find a list of those numbers."
