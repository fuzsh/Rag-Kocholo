The company operated as the United States branch of Decca Records before rebranding to MCA Records in 1972.\n\nRiders In The Sky released four albums on MCA between 1987 and 1990, as well as three singles, and one compilation album. As a result of MCA falling under Universal's ownership, all of the Riders' master recordings from their time on the label were stored inside Building 6197, which was destroyed in a fire that broke out on the Universal Studios backlot in 2008.\n\nRiders In The Sky Album Releases On MCA[]\n\nAlbum Cover Album Name Release Date The Cowboy Way 1987 Riders Radio Theater June 27th, 1988 Riders Go Commercial 1989 Horse Opera 1990 Saturday Morning With Riders In The Sky 1992\n\nRiders In The Sky Single Releases On MCA[]"
