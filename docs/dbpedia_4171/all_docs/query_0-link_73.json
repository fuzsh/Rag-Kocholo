        "text": "Tag Archive for: featured-2\n\nWeekly Register: Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line\n\n/\n\nThe top Country album title in this week’s Top 200 rankings remains Luke Bryan, whose Crash My Party title sold 68k this week, for a five-week total of 847k. Bryan also holds the top Country digital track with “That’s My Kind of Night” selling 107k units this week (508 RTD).\n\nNew album releases this week include Frank Foster‘s Southern Soul at No. 11 (5.8k), Craig Morgan’s The Journey (Livin’ Hits) at No. 12 (5.1k), Reckless Kelly‘s Long Night Moon at No. 22 (4.1k), and Chris Janson‘s self-titled EP at No. 47 (1k). Sara Evans holds the top Country digital tracks debut with “Slow Me Down” selling 15k this week, coming in at No. 28 (Country) and No. 101 (overall).\n\nOverall album sales YTD are down 5.6 percent compared to 2012, while total Country album sales are down .4 percent. In one bright spot, Country track sales YTD are up 6 percent, compared to overall album sales, which are down 3.1 percent. Country digital album sales stand at 8.064 million YTD, a climb of 13.3 percent over last year.\n\nSince their massive hit single “Cruise” was released, Florida Georgia Line‘s digital track sales have skyrocketed. The duo recently tallied more than 10 million tracks sold worldwide from their debut album Here’s To The Good Times (Republic Nashville), which has been certified Platinum in the United States and Gold in Canada by the RIAA.\n\nNext week’s weekly sales register will get a bump from the releases of new projects by Keith Urban, Sheryl Crow, Steve Wariner and a gospel project from the late George Jones.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/10184645/weekly-register-fglfeatured.jpg 260 390 Jessica Nicholson https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Jessica Nicholson2013-09-11 15:34:352013-09-11 15:34:35Weekly Register: Luke Bryan, Florida Georgia Line\n\nDISClaimer: A Song That Shakes You\n\n/\n\nDespite the plethora of big names in today’s column, there isn’t a great deal of undeniable music. Almost everything is well done, but nothing really shook me down to my boots. Some of my favorite moments came from collaborations, such as John Fogerty & Miranda Lambert and Hank Williams Jr. & Merle Haggard. The best new message lyrics of the week are being sung by Ty Herndon and Ash Bowers.\n\nThe Disc of the Day prize goes to the always reliable Dierks Bentley. The DisCovery Award belongs to the Maryland-reared Brothers Osborne. Although I’m not all that enthused by their debut single, I sense that they are harboring much more compelling sounds. Plus, the reaction they are getting at their live shows is super encouraging.\n\nASH BOWERS/Shake It Off\n\nWriters: Ash Bowers/Adam Craig/Shane Minor; Producer: none listed; Publisher: none listed; Wide Open/New\n\n-Be strong and carry on when the weight of the world is bearing down on you. This song’s lyric has a message for us all, delivered by an encouraging tenor with roll-on, steady-groove instrumental support. Play this every Friday after work, and you’re bound to feel better.\n\nRECKLESS KELLY/The Last Goodbye\n\nWriters: none listed; Producer: none listed; Publisher: none listed; No Big Deal\n\n-As usual, these guys are models of professionalism. The understated vocal harmonies, easy-going instrumental work and deft song craftsmanship simply sparkle on this mid-tempo outing. Stay tuned for the dream-like, extended instrumental coda. All country bands should sound this cool.\n\nTY HERNDON/Lies I Told Myself\n\nWriters: Neal Coty/Neal Carpenter; Producer: Paul Compton; Publisher: Bug/BMG Chrysalis, BMI; Funl/Flying Lizard\n\n-This superbly well written ballad lists familiar phrases to hold you back that we all might have heard. The singer has heard them, and is “glad I didn’t believe.” Ty’s heart-in-throat vocal conviction conveys the message movingly. The restrained production is also just right.\n\nHANK WILLIAMS JR. & MERLE HAGGARD/I Think I’ll Just Stay Here and Drink\n\nWriter: Merle Haggard; Producer: Chris Farren; Publisher: Sony-ATV, no performance rights listed; Blaster/Bocephus\n\n-Merle’s boozy 1980 hit gets an update with a drawled duet assist from Bocephus. Brotherly love.\n\nSARA EVANS/Slow Me Down\n\nWriters: Marv Green/Heather Morgan/Jimmy Robbins; Producer: Mark Bright; Publishers: Warner Tamerlane/The Good The Bad The Ugly/Made For This/Sony ATV; RCA (CDX)\n\n-The plucked violin strings are nifty and catchy, as are the range-y vocal melody and the stacked chorus harmonies. In the lyric, she’s thinking of leaving, but wants to be stopped.\n\nBROTHERS OSBORNE/Let’s Go There\n\nWriters: Jon Mabe/John Osborne/T.J. Osborne; Producers: Brothers Osborne/Brad Hill; Publishers: Music of Stage Three/Mabe It Big/BMG Chrysalis/WB/All The Kings Pens; BMI/ASCAP; EMI (CDX)\n\n-Bopping and jaunty, if not particularly memorable. A production that emphasized acoustic textures rather than electric guitars might have helped it sound more distinctive.\n\nDIERKS BENTLEY/I Hold On\n\nWriters: Brett James/Dierks Bentley; Producer: Ross Copperman; Publishers: WB/Songs of Brett/External Combustion/Big White Tracks; ASCAP; Capitol Nashville\n\n-The deep bass rumble grabs you first. As usual, Dierks delivers with conviction as the rocker unleashes its message of cherishing the tried and true, the good, the old and the winning things. The production is like a crashing, foaming surf wave.\n\nTOMMY ROE/Memphis Me\n\nWriter: Tommy Roe; Producer: Tommy Roe; Publisher: Sony-ATV, BMI\n\n-Pop vet Tommy Roe (”Sheila,” “Dizzy,” “Sweet Pea,” “Jam Up Jelly Tight,” etc.) has a mellow comeback ditty with a rolling groove that goes down easy. His vocal is a little thin sounding, but nevertheless glides smoothly over the simple, downhome melody.\n\nJOHN FOGERTY & MIRANDA LAMBERT/Wrote A Song For Everyone\n\nWriter: John Fogerty; Producer: John Fogerty; Publisher: Jondora, BMI; Vanguard (track)\n\n-Miranda lands the duet slot on the title tune of the acclaimed new John Fogerty CD. The two take turns singing leads and harmonies, sounding thrilling together throughout. Other country stars collaborating on the set include Brad Paisley (”Hot Rod Heart”), Alan Jackson (”Have You Ever Seen the Rain”), Zac Brown Band (”Bad Moon Rising”) and Keith Urban (”Almost Saturday Night”). The album includes many of the legend’s most famous songs as well as a handful of new compositions. Because of the cool arrangements, even the familiar tunes seem entirely fresh. Heartily recommended.\n\nKRYSTAL KEITH/Get Your Redneck On\n\nWriters: Krystal Keith/Nathan Chapman; Producer: Nathan Chapman; Publishers: Bumperdoo/Songs of Universal/Art in the Pain/BMI; Show Dog\n\n-The lyric contains every cliche in the modern country playbook–beer, skinny dipping, listening to country songs, backwoods party–you know the drill. But there is absolutely nothing routine about her ringing vocal delivery, the lovely melody or the ear-opening production. A winner.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/10185201/dierks-bentley-featured11.jpg 260 390 Robert K Oermann https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Robert K Oermann2013-09-11 09:52:072013-09-11 09:52:07DISClaimer: A Song That Shakes You\n\nSwift, Musgraves Top 47th Annual CMA Awards Nominations\n\n/\n\nKacey Musgraves and Taylor Swift top this year’s nominees for the 47th Annual CMA Awards with six nominations apiece (full list below).

O’Neill’s appointment was a unanimous decision by BMI’s board of directors. O’Neill will begin his new role as CEO on Sept. 16, and as president of the company in June 2014.\n\n“I am honored that the BMI Board of Directors chose me to follow in the footsteps of two truly iconic CEOs who have led BMI for the past 28 years – Frances Preston and Del Bryant,” said O’Neill in a statement. “I am also thrilled that I will have the ability to rely on Del’s counsel over the coming year as he is an exceptional executive, leader, role model and friend.”\n\nBryant announced his plans to exit BMI in May of this year, saying that he was “privileged to lead this company I love, one of the world’s greatest music companies. I began my career with BMI in 1972 and after four decades with the company and 10 years as CEO, I’m excited to be moving back to my hometown of Nashville where my family and I will build a farm on beautiful land purchased by my folks with money earned from their BMI catalog. I look forward to working with the board during the transition period, and to supporting the company as a consultant after retiring as CEO.”\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/10184657/bmi-logo1111featured.jpg 260 390 Jessica Nicholson https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Jessica Nicholson2013-09-06 11:29:422013-09-06 11:29:42BMI Names O'Neill As President, CEO\n\nWeekly Chart Report (9/6/13)\n\n/\n\nSPIN ZONE\n\nJason Aldean’s “Night Train” stops at the top of MusicRow’s chart, taking the No. 1 spot with 3141 spins.

The company includes his artist management business (with clients including the Eagles, Steely Dan, Van Halen and Christina Aguilera), a television/live event division, a 50 percent stake in Digital Brand Architects, and a 90 percent interest in a publishing venture headed by former ASCAP executive Randy Grimmett. The company is backed by the Madison Square Garden Company, which supplied $175 million to the company. Azoff counts Madison Square Garden Company’s executive chairman James L. Dolan as a longtime supporter.\n\nThe Madison Square Garden Company will pay $125 million for a 50 percent stake in Azoff MSG Entertainment, and will provide up to $50 million of credit to the company. Azoff will also serve as a consultant to the Madison Square Garden Company.\n\nIn a joint interview, Azoff and Mr. Dolan described the mission of the new company as being somewhat loose, saying they see it as a lean, digitally focused company that will address the needs of the evolving music business. Azoff’s career began in artist management in the 1970s.\n\nDolan joined Live Nation’s board in 2011, after the company merged with Ticketmaster and Azoff was named Executive Chairman. After Azoff exited his post as Chairman of Live Nation Entertainment and CEO of Front Line Management Group in January of this year, Dolan resigned from the board; Dolan’s company did away with its 3.9 million shares in Live Nation for $44 million.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/10184702/irving-azoff111.jpg 260 390 Jessica Nicholson https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Jessica Nicholson2013-09-04 17:38:052013-09-04 17:38:05Irving Azoff Announces New Venture\n\nWeekly Register: Alabama & Friends\n\n/\n\nAlabama & Friends is the top Country album debuting this week, landing at No. 2 on the Country albums chart, (No. 8 overall) and selling 32k units. The release from Show Dog-Universal Music features Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Kenny Chesney, Eli Young Band, Florida Georgia Line, Jamey Johnson, Toby Keith, Rascal Flatts and Trisha Yearwood covering Alabama‘s most memorable and biggest hits of their career. The project also includes two new tunes from the Hall of Famers, including “All American,” which is at Country radio now and debuted last week on the MusicRow CountryBreakout Chart at No. 77.\n\nIn its third week, Luke Bryan‘s latest release Crash My Party sells another 92k albums (779 RTD) and sits at No. 1 on the Country sales chart and No. 2 on the Top Albums charts, right behind Avenged Sevenfold‘s Hail To The King (debuting with 159k units sold).\n\nOther album debuts this week include Sundy Best Door Without A Screen (2k) and Due West Move Like That – EP (1k). Overall, album sales are down 5.9 percent over prior year while Country albums have a shortfall of 1.8 percent. Taking into account TEA (track equivalent albums; 10 tracks=1 album), Country albums are up .5 percent over last year while overall, all-genre albums are down 4.9 percent.\n\nBryan’s “That’s My Kind Of Night” sits in the top position of the Country tracks again this week with 112k sold this week (402k RTD). The top Country track debut this week is Cassadee Pope‘s “11” selling 21k units sitting at No. 19 (No. 72 overall). The top song on the overall tracks chart is Katy Perry’s single, “Roar,” selling 448k units in its third week (1.4 million RTD). Country tracks are up 6.6 percent over last year while overall, tracks are down 3.1 percent.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/10184703/alabama-and-friends1featured.jpg 260 390 Sherod Robertson https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Sherod Robertson2013-09-04 14:59:302013-09-04 14:59:30Weekly Register: Alabama & Friends\n\nDISClaimer: Rock 'n' Soul In Music City\n\n/\n\nI think the day is nearing when national media outlets will finally stop voicing surprise when a major pop, r&b or rock record emerges from Nashville. We have been reminding them with The Black Keys, Kings of Leon, Ke$ha, Paramore, Jack White, Hot Chelle Rae, durable Delbert McClinton and John Hiatt, Ben Folds, Los Straightjackets, Lambchop, The Evinrudes, JEFF the Brotherhood, Bela Fleck, Larry Carlton, Take 6, Keb Mo, Will Hoge, Ruby Amanfu and many more for years now.\n\nSeveral of our established stars have discs in this week’s column. Even more exciting is the presence on our non-country scene of such new faces as Wild Cub, Cooper and Ed Sheeran. The soul-singing Cooper wins the DisCovery Award. The Disc of the Day belongs to Matthew Perryman Jones.\n\nBELA FLECK & THE NASHVILLE SYMPHONY/The Impostor Concerto\n\nWriters: Bela Fleck; Producers: Bela Fleck, Blanton Alspaugh and Jesse Lewis; Publishers: Juno Jasper, no performance rights listed; Mercury/Decca\n\n-After somewhat ominous woodwind and string sections’ opening remarks, Fleck’s banjo enters with a surprising soft and gentle tone. While the strings continue to underscore him, the instrumentalist’s playing becomes a bit more intense. As the concerto unfolds, Fleck alternates lilting solo passages with full-bodied orchestral ones. He often introduces a melodic line, and then has the orchestra play and build on it. He uses the ensemble well, employing its emotional dynamics and volume to contrast with his solo playing. I like this piece. It is the jazzman’s first significant work in this idiom, and perhaps this is why it is so beautifully restrained and conservative. Don’t expect any atonality or radically shifting tempi. Melody rules here.\n\nTIM EASTON/Troubled Times\n\nWriters: T. Easton; Producers: Brad Jones and Robin Eaton; Publisher: Campfire, ASCAP; Campfire\n\n-This Nashville singer-songwriter-guitarist adopts a delightful neo-rockabilly mode on this track from his new Not Cool CD. The whole thumpy collection has a Sun Records ‘50s vibe, albeit with an up-to-date, super audio gloss of echo, twang and urgency. It is impossible not to like this record.\n\nTRAIN & ASHLEY MONROE/Bruises\n\nWriters: Pat Monahan, Espin Lind, Amund Bjorklund; Producers: Butch Walker and Espionage; Publishers: EMI April/Ptimon/Stellar, ASCAP; Columbia (track)\n\n-Our own Appalachian Ashley has been out on the road with Train this summer, playing for crowds of 15,000 to 20,000 fans a night. “Bruises,” her duet with the band and its lead singer Pat Monahan, became a decent-sized A/C hit during that time. Its crunchy, story-telling charms are so numerous I don’t know where to start. His pleading tenor and her mountain soprano sound great together, and the lyric of lost loves is just terrific. You’ll find it on Train’s dandy, pop-pop-pop CD California 37: Mermaids of Alcatraz Tour Edition.\n\nMATTHEW PERRYMAN JONES/Waking Up The Dead\n\nWriters: Matthew Perryman Jones; Producer: Cason Cooley; Publisher: Smoldering Wick, ASCAP; Cante Jondo\n\n-Notable recently for his participation on the marvelous Ten Out of Tenn tours and recordings, Jones now has his fifth solo CD on the market. Titled Land of the Living, it contains this stirring, celestial, driving, propulsive rock track. He sings above a furiously frothing track like a man possessed. Get up and DANCE, people.\n\nED SHEERAN/Lego House\n\nWriters: Ed Sheeran, Jake Gosling, Chris Leonard; Producer: Jake Gosling; Publishers: Sony-ATV/The Movement/BDi, no performance rights listed; Elektra (track)\n\n-This 2012 Grammy nominee (for “The A Team”) and Taylor Swift tour opener is residing in Music City these days. The British singer-songwriter has had an outstanding year with his international-sales-phenomenon debut CD titled +. This latest single from it continues to mine his breathy, youthful singing style and sweetly melodic songwriting. His performances on the Grammys (with Elton John) and recently on the MTV Music Awards don’t begin to reflect how well crafted his album is.\n\nBEN FOLDS FIVE/Sky High\n\nWriters: Darren Jessee; Producer: Leo Overtoom; Publisher: Hair Sucker; BMI; Ima Vee Pee/Sony\n\n-Folds remains one of Nashville’s most intelligent and witty pop craftsmen, as well as one of its major studio owners. His reassembled trio Ben Folds Five collects 15 concert performances from 2012-2013 for its just-released debut live album. This airy, lilting bit of nostalgia is the current video from the set. As always, his compelling piano work and resigned vocal tone completely capture your ears. Unlike many live albums, this one sounds extremely, extremely good.\n\nWILD CUB/Wild Light\n\nWriters: none listed; Producers: Dabney Morris and Wild Cub; Publishers: none listed; Big Light (track)\n\n-Nashville’s Wild Cub played at Bonaroo and is widely regarded as an indie band to watch. Its 2012 Youth CD has yielded several highly danceable tracks, including this quirky bopper. Overall, the sound has an ‘80s, synthy “new wave” quality crossed with dense, rave-ish contemporary electro-pop. The group’s Keegan DeWitt is the singer-songwriter. But I became aware of Wild Cub because of “band mom” Kay West. Her son, Harry, is the group’s bass player. The group recently released “Blacktide” as a teaser track from its forthcoming sophomore set, so look for that online as well.\n\nDELBERT & GLEN/Been Around a Long Time\n\n-Writers: none listed; Producers: Gary Nicholson, Glen Clark and Delbert McClinton; Publishers: none listed; New West (track)\n\n-Delbert McClinton and Glen Clark were musical partners way back in the early 1970s. Their reunion CD, Blind Crippled & Crazy, has an old-buddies feeling. Considering Delbert’s subsequent reign as one of our greatest blues rockers, it comes as no surprise that this lead-off track is soaked in backwoods soul.\n\nCOOPER/Tell Me To Stay\n\n-Writers: Cooper/Norris; Producer: David Norris; Publisher: Cooperjam Works; BMI\n\n-This new diva could be Nashville’s answer to Adele. Except she’s even more neo-soul, right down to the horns, organ and backup singers. Think classic Muscle Shoals replanted on Music Row. Think female Percy Sledge (”When a Man Loves a Woman”). Cooper has been playing occasionally at the Bourbon Street Blues & Boogie Bar in Printers Alley. Let a word to the wise be sufficient: If you see her name in the club listings, go and become a believer. Also: You gotta love a gal who introduces herself with a vinyl, 45 r.p.m. single.\n\nDIARRHEA PLANET/Kids\n\nWriters: Diarrhea Planet; Producer: Kevin S. McMahon; Publisher: none listed; SESAC; Infinity Cat (track)\n\n-These durable Music City thrashers recently took a big leap forward with a write-up in Rolling Stone. Mind you, this isn’t exactly my cup of tea, but there’s something endearing about their punky, snotty, good-humored attitude. This track isn’t as frantic as most of the rest of the LP I’m Rich Beyond Your Wildest Dreams. But due to the multiple-guitar attack, it’s still plenty messy and loud enough.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/10184701/MPJ-featured.jpg 260 390 Robert K Oermann https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Robert K Oermann2013-09-04 10:15:142013-09-04 10:15:14DISClaimer: Rock 'n' Soul In Music City\n\nWeekly Chart Report (8/30/13)\n\n/\n\nSPIN ZONE\n\nAfter spending 18 weeks on MusicRow’s chart, Thomas Rhett’s “It Goes Like This” takes the No. 1 spot with 3151 spins.
