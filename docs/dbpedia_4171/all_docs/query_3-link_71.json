        "text": "David Geffen, the pop culture impresario behind musicians ranging from the folk singer Joni Mitchell in the 1960's to the heavy metal group Guns 'n' Roses, agreed today to sell his record company to the entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc. for more than $550 million in stock.\n\nThe deal will make Mr. Geffen, who is 47 years old, one of the nation's richest individuals.\n\nThe purchase of Geffen Records, the largest independently owned company left in the business, caps a long period of consolidation in the record industry and it dramatically shows the immense values being put on record companies. The $23 billion-a-year industry has been pushed into fewer hands in recent years as the leading companies have sought to acquire greater efficiencies in manufacturing, more power in distribution, and the financial resources to be more aggressive in signing big-name stars and marketing their recordings.\n\nThe appeal of Mr. Geffen's record company has long been apparent in the industry. The announcement today ended weeks of offers and counteroffers for Geffen Records by three big entertainment companies. Indeed, just a week ago Mr. Geffen had been on the verge of signing a deal with Thorn-EMI P.L.C. of Britain. He had also been negotiating with Time Warner Inc., which has long distributed Geffen's recordings.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Mr. Geffen will continue to run the record company as part of a long-term employment contract with MCA.\n\nMr. Geffen has been one the most successful entrepreneurs in the en-tertainment industry, not only in pop music but also in movies and on Broadway. Casual in manner and dress, Mr. Geffen is one of a handful of people in the business who move as easily among rock stars wearing leather as among executives in pin stripes. More important, he has consistently demonstrated his ability to spot up-and-coming artists and nurture their careers.\n\nAlthough Mr. Geffen will receive a huge sum for his company, MCA executives insisted that his skills justified the investment.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
