        "text": "THIS time, it's personal.\n\nWilliam J. Bennett, the conservative author and former Education Secretary, has unleashed yet another public relations fusillade against an entertainment conglomerate for distributing gangsta rap music with lyrics that he says are violent and sexually degrading.\n\nBut Mr. Bennett's latest campaign -- against MCA Inc. and its corporate overlord, Edgar Bronfman Jr. -- is radically different from his protracted battle against Time Warner Inc. last year. Then, Mr. Bennett's beef was that the world's largest media company refused to set standards for the gangsta rap music that it distributed.\n\nThis time around, Mr. Bennett contends that Mr. Bronfman, the chief executive of MCA's corporate parent, the Seagram Company, promised not to distribute gangsta rap with offensive lyrics -- and then went ahead and did it anyway. In essence, he is calling Mr. Bronfman a liar.\n\nAt the heart of both of Mr. Bennett's attacks is Interscope Records, a Los Angeles label that MCA acquired from Time Warner this year and which distributes several of the hardest-edged gangsta rap artists.\n\nTwo of Interscope's current top-selling rap albums, ''Tha Doggfather'' by Snoop Doggy Dogg and ''The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory'' by Tupac Shakur, recording under the name Makaveli, include lyrics that, Mr. Bennett asserts, glorify violence and degrade women. Mr. Shakur was shot to death in September and his album came out posthumously.\n\n''Mr. Bronfman told me, 'We are not going to do what Time Warner did; we are not going to put out that kind of music,' '' Mr. Bennett said, recalling a meeting he held with Mr. Bronfman in Washington in February. ''When I saw this new stuff, I thought, 'He did not keep his word.' ''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
