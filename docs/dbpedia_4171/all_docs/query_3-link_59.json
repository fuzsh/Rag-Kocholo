        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nAdam Yauch, a.k.a. MCA of the Beastie Boys, would have turned 51 today. He died of cancer in 2012. The gravelly-voiced member of the Beasties, Yauch became a practicing Buddhist and peace activist, as well as an outspoken proponent of feminism and LGBT rights, subsequently apologizing for early lyrics he retroactively deemed offensive. In 1999, the Beastie Boys sent a letter to Time Out New York apologizing for homophobic lyrics, and in their song \"Sure Shot\" Yauch sings \"I want to say a little something that's long overdue/ The disrespect to women has got to be through/ To all the mothers and sisters and wives and friends/ I want to offer my love and respect to the end.\"\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1957 - American Bandstand went national when it aired for the first time on ABC. Hosted by Dick Clark throughout its national run, the show remained on network TV until 1987. The first song the kids danced to was \"That'll Be The Day\" by Buddy Holly.\n\n1966 - The Beatles' seventh album, Revolver, was released in the U.K.\n\n1972 - Aerosmith signed to CBS Records for $125,000 after record company boss Clive Davis saw them play at Max's Kansas City Club New York.\n\n1975 - Drummer Sandy West and guitarist Joan Jett formed the first-ever all-female heavy-rock band, The Runaways. The band released four studio albums, and among their best-known songs are \"Cherry Bomb,\" \"Queens of Noise\" and a cover of The Velvet Underground's \"Rock n Roll.\"\n\n1978 - The Rolling Stones went to No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Miss You,\" the group's eighth U.S. No. 1.\n\n1979 - Def Leppard signed to Phonogram records with an advance of Â£120,000 ($180,000), giving them a 10 percent royalty on 100 percent of sales for the first two years.\n\n1996 - Long a mainstay of U.K. television, the music show \"Top Of The Pops\" reported its lowest audience ever, only 2.5 million viewers. In its heyday, the show attracted more than 17 million viewers each week.\n\n2007 - DNA testing on about a dozen people who claimed late soul star James Brown was their father revealed that at least two of them were telling the truth.\n\nBirthdays:\n\nStuart Croxford of Kajagoogoo is 55.\n\nBassist Jennifer Finch of L7 is 49."
