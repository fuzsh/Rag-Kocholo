Some of his hit songs include “Long Black Train,” “Why Don’t We Just Dance,” “Your Man” and “Would You Go With Me.” Along with seven studio albums, Turner has also released three passion projects on the label, including Country State of Mine, I Serve A Savior and King Size Manger.\n\n“Josh Turner has one of the most identifiable voices in country music,” says Cindy Mabe, UMG Nashville Chair and CEO. “His music has touched generations of fans with his rich, deep voice paired with his deep connection to country music, family, faith and his fans. From his journey of ‘Long Black Train’ to his newest album, Josh has built an iconic career with some of the biggest hits in country music history. We are so proud to continue to represent Josh Turner as a member of MCA Nashville roster.”\n\nTo celebrate the news, Turner will be releasing his new single “Heatin’ Things Up” this Friday (April 26).
