        "text": "Nik Kershaw / The MCA Years\n\nComprehensive 10CD+DVD box set\n\nRatings Ratings\n\nThe MCA Years / Nik Kershaw 10CD+DVD box set\n\nSDE Reader Rating\n\n2.6 Path Path Path Path Path Path Path Path\n\nThe Nik Kershaw box set that SDE exclusively revealed in our 2024 SDE Reissue Preview will be released in July. Called The MCA Years, the 10CD+DVD box set brings together Nik’s first four albums with a further seven discs of bonus content.\n\nThe four albums are of course Human Racing (1984), The Riddle (1984), Radio Musicola (1986) and The Works (1989). While the first two albums got decent – but not perfect – 2CD reissues around a decade ago, the last two have never been expanded so for that reason alone, The MCA Years is rather exciting.\n\nThe albums all stand alone on their respective CDs, newly remastered by Tony Dixon and overseen by Nik Kershaw. After that is six CDs of bonus content, made up of one disc of B-sides, three CDs of extended remixes, seven-inch mixes and the odd dub mix, and two CDs featuring Kershaw’s 1984 Hammersmith Odeon show released in its entirety for the first time!\n\nThe bonus DVD includes 13 promo videos and the filmed version of the Hammersmith show (which is edited and therefore doesn’t include all the audio tracks on those two CDs.\n\nI interviewed Nik for this release last year and in the accompanying booklet he tells his ‘MCA story’ with anecdotes and recollections from this era.\n\nThe MCA Years will be released on 27 September 2024 (was 30 August 2024 and prior to that 26 July), via Cherry Red.\n\nTracklisting\n\nThe MCA Years Nik Kershaw / 10CD+DVD box set\n\nCD 1: Human Racing\n\nDancing Girls\n\nWouldn’t It Be Good\n\nDrum Talk\n\nBogart\n\nGone To Pieces\n\nShame On You\n\nCloak And Dagger\n\nFaces\n\nI Won’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me\n\nHuman Racing\n\nCD 2: The Riddle\n\nDon Quixote\n\nKnow How\n\nYou Might\n\nWild Horses\n\nEasy\n\nThe Riddle\n\nCity Of Angels\n\nRoses\n\nWide Boy\n\nSave The Whale\n\nCD 3: Radio Musicola\n\nRadio Musicola\n\nNobody Knows\n\nL.A.B.A.T.Y.D.\n\nWhat The Papers Say\n\nLife Goes On\n\nRunning Scared\n\nJames Cagney\n\nDon’t Let Me Out of My Cage\n\nWhen A Heart Beats\n\nViolet To Blue\n\nCD 4: The Works\n\nOne Step Ahead\n\nElisabeth’s Eyes\n\nTake My Place\n\nWounded Knee\n\nCowboys And Indians\n\nOne World\n\nDon’t Ask Me\n\nBurning At Both Ends\n\nLady On The Phone\n\nWalkabout\n\nCD 5: B-sides\n\nDark Glasses\n\nShe Cries\n\nMonkey Business\n\nSo Quiet\n\nDon’t Lie (featuring Sheri Kershaw)\n\nOne Of Our Fruit Machines Is Missing (Instrumental)\n\nWhen I Grow Up\n\nMy Friend John\n\nCD 6: Extended Mixes\n\nWouldn’t It Be Good – Special Extended Mix\n\nDancing Girls – Special Extended Version\n\nI Won’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me – Extended Remix by Simon Boswell\n\nHuman Racing – Re-mix By Simon Boswell\n\nDrum Talk – Special Extended Version\n\nFaces – Re-mix By Simon Boswell\n\nBogart – Extended 12″ Remix\n\nI Won’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me – Extended Dance Mix\n\nThe Riddle – Extended 12” Remix\n\nCD 7: Extended Mixes\n\nWide Boy – Special Extended Mix\n\nDon Quixote – Extra Special Long Mix\n\nWild Horses – Extended Mix\n\nWhen A Heart Beats – Extended Mix\n\nRadio Musicola – Extended Version\n\nNobody Knows – Extended Mix\n\nJames Cagney – Extended Mix\n\nOne Step Ahead – Industrial Mix\n\nElisabeth’s Eyes – Extended Version\n\nCD 8: Mixes\n\nI Won’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me – 7” Remix by Simon Boswell\n\nWide Boy – 7” Remix by Gary Langan\n\nJames Cagney – Edited Version\n\nDancing Girls – Remixed Version\n\nDancing Girls – Special Hi- Energy Remix\n\nDrum Talk – Special Hi- energy Remix\n\nWouldn’t It Be Good – Remix\n\nElisabeth’s Eyes – Club Dub\n\nShame On You – Additional Brass Mix\n\nCD 9: Live at Hammersmith Odeon Dec ’84\n\nRoses\n\nKnow How\n\nDancing Girls\n\nBogart\n\nCity Of Angels\n\nCloak And Dagger\n\nWild Horses\n\nGone To Pieces\n\nSave The Whale\n\nThe Riddle\n\nCD 10: Live at Hammersmith Odeon Dec ’84\n\nShame On You\n\nWide Boy\n\nHuman Racing\n\nDrum Tal\n\nWouldn’t It Be Good\n\nFaces\n\nI Won’t Let The Sun Go Down\n\nDon Quixote\n\nYou Might\n\nProgress\n\nDVD\n\nVideos\n\nWouldn’t It Be Good\n\nI Won’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me – Original\n\nI Won’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me\n\nDancing Girls\n\nWide Boy\n\nNobody Knows\n\nHuman Racing\n\nThe Riddle\n\nDon Quixote\n\nWhen A Heart Beats\n\nRadio Musicola\n\nElizabeth’s Eyes\n\nOne Step Ahead\n\nLive at Hammersmith Odeon 1984\n\nRoses\n\nKnow How\n\nBogart\n\nCloak & Dagger\n\nWild Horses\n\nGone To Pieces\n\nSave The Whale\n\nThe Riddle\n\nWide Boy\n\nWouldn’t It Be Good\n\nDrum Talk\n\nI Won’t Let The Sun Go Down\n\nSign Up For the SDE newsletter\n\nSuperDeluxeEdition.com helps fans around the world discover physical music and discuss releases.
