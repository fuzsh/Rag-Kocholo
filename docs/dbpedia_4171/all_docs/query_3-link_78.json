        "text": "Cherry Red are to release a new boxed-set covering Nik's years with the MCA label entitled, not unsurprisingly, Nik Kershaw - The MCA Years.\n\nIt has been indicated that the set will include 9 CDs and 2 DVDs.\n\nBefore anyone gets too carried away at the treasure trove of potential goodies, it should be pointed out that if Cherry Red follow the same format as that of their Level 42 boxes, the CDs are likely to feature a LOT of dead space, with each album given its own disc and any bonus tracks house on the bonus discs.\n\nLike this:-\n\nCD1 Human Racing\n\nCD2 The Riddle\n\nCD3 Radio Musicola\n\nCD4 The Works\n\nCD5 Singles\n\nCD6 B-sides\n\nCD7 Extended versions 1\n\nCD8 Extended versions 2\n\nCD9 Other tracks\n\nDVD1 The videos\n\nDVD2 Live at Hammersmith\n\nThe frustrating thing is that if my guess is right as to what tracks they'll be including, the music could fit comfortably onto six packed CDs, and if they included a blu-ray (rather than the 2 DVDs) they would have room for all the video content suggested about PLUS hi-res rips of all the albums (and perhaps many of the bonus cuts).\n\nThere has not been any official announcement yet as to running order or release date, but I am expecting this to ship in Q3, to tie in with Nik's UK tour performing his first two albums in full.\n\nSadly I’m not expecting the mastering to be any great shakes, not least because it’s Cherry Red we are talking about. But here’s hoping.\n\nBtw, my favourite Nik is still Human Racing. Later albums might have better individual songs, but for consistency to my mind the debut album remains unbeaten\n\nI think the main thing most of us Nik fans want is more unreleased music/versions from that era - I'm hoping that the Human Racing era recording of \"Wide Boy\" is on there and it would be good to hear the alternate version of \"One World\" - that was on the Japanese \"The Collection\" CD in mono - in stereo.\n\nOne thing that certainly won't be on there is Rupert Hine's production of \"I Won't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\" which was the first version done for MCA. Nik loved it, but it can't be found\n\nWorth noting that plenty of Cherry Red boxes have extra tracks on the same disc as the album, including ones I own by The Primitives, The House Of Love, Chapterhouse, Mudhoney and McCarthy. The album being on a disc on its own with no bonus tracks seems to depend on the artist and their feelings on the matter.\n\nI hear you. I was just speculating as to how Cherry Red might spin the set out to 9 discs.\n\nSome genuine rarities such as those you mention certainly would make the inevitable hefty price tag easier to swallow.\n\nMy guesstimate was £69, so we’re in the same ballpark - which I would happily pay if they were going to include hi-res stereo on the DVDs.\n\nHell, include Atmos on a blu-ray and I’d go higher again - though I’m guessing that’s not part of the licensing deal at this point.\n\nCan you tell us more about the Rupert Hine produced version of \"I Won't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\"? I assume it's an unreleased version that Nik has mentioned?"
