MCA Records was an record label owned and operated by the American media conglomerate MCA Inc., though it would be dissolved in 2003 by the Universal Music Group, who purchased the label in 1996. The company operated as the United States branch of Decca Records before rebranding to MCA Records in 1972.

Riders In The Sky released four albums on MCA between 1987 and 1990, as well as three singles, and one compilation album. As a result of MCA falling under Universal's ownership, all of the Riders' master recordings from their time on the label were stored inside Building 6197, which was destroyed in a fire that broke out on the Universal Studios backlot in 2008.
