        "text": "The selection of the wheat\n\nSelecting excellent primary materials is the first step, the most important one in fact, in creating unique pasta.\n\nThe milling\n\nWe have been millers for almost two centuries: way back in 1831, Don Nicola De Cecco was already producing “the best flour in the county” in his mill. To this day, we grind all the wheat in our own mill next to the pasta factory, floating with intense and delicious aromas.\n\nThe dough\n\nCold water and dough at a temperature of less than 15 degrees: two details allowing us to produce pasta that fully respects the primary material.\n\nThe drawing process\n\nWhile it is the drawing process that gives the pasta its shape, it is the rough die that make our pasta uniquely porous, so it captures all the sauce. Hence, this is one of the special procedures we have chosen to preserve and protect. With great pride."
