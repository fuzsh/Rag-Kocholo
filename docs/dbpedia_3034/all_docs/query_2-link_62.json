        "text": "I've known Dave Alexander for over a decade. He was one of the most talented students with a camera at Columbia Journalism School and just a well-rounded, hilarious guy who has pretty much seen the entire globe at this point. We both share a love for the Aegean Sea and grilled sardines. Since graduating, his work has been featured in publications like The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, ESPN, The Economist and delivered projects for organizations like The Starkey Hearing Foundation, the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Tony Hawk Foundation, and Clinton Foundation. He's now a video producer at UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency in Geneva.\n\nHe's done a lot of things and been a lot of places. Here's his takes on everything from the perfect Airbnb to remote work:\n\nMy mother taught me how to be frugal.\n\nMy father taught me sometimes you gotta throw money at a problem.\n\nThese days LA is home, albeit a distant one. Los Angeles feels so far from everywhere, which I guess is the appeal.\n\nMichigan is bonfires and kayaks and bare feet. One day I’m going to learn how to fish.\n\nLiving in London was the beginning of the end. Day to day life was really nice. Pubs and bicycle rides and infrared saunas - but my actual freelance workload was slowly diminishing. I was ready to move on.\n\nLesotho is a landlocked nation in the mountains of Southern Africa where I once did a conga line with Prince Harry. Beautiful place.\n\nCambodia was interesting because it was my introduction to the world of ‘advocacy filmmaking’ or in drier terms, the world of communications for NGO’s and foundations. I learned how to protect myself from mosquitos, sleep in a hammock, and do all my postproduction from the actual jungle where power and internet would come and go. It was a beautiful time of my life.\n\nAmericans have to get on Whatsapp.\n\nThe Swiss need to think about keeping stores open on Sunday. Although this place seems to be working quite well…maybe they don’t need my input.\n\nMy perfect day is waking up to a viral LinkedIn post and going back to sleep.\n\nThe perfect Airbnb needs a concierge, clean towels, room service…. to be a hotel.\n\nButter is a shortcut to making things taste good. In the great ‘Butter vs Olive Oil divide’ I side strongly with olive oil.\n\nI have no clue about the endless abyss of acronyms in the United Nations systems. I’m trying. But it’s hard.\n\nMy camera is old.\n\nThe Ken Burns effect is classic for a reason. They should make it easy to do on Instagram stories.\n\nDrone shots are still gorgeous. A miracle of modern technology. But when I hear that buzzing sound of the propellers, I don’t like it.\n\nThe pivot to video is your ally. But you merely adopted the pivot to video, I was born in it, molded by it.\n\nColumbia University - Graduate School of Journalism is expensive. Worth it I think…but I’m still not out of debt.\n\nVisiting Turkey after the recent earthquake was the most challenging thing I’ve ever had to do in my career. Absolutely heartbreaking and unimaginable destruction.\n\nThe trouble with humanity is our inability to stay present/grateful.\n\nMy workspace is something that I cherish. Having a desk to come to everyday as a new father is a luxury.\n\nRemote work is a nice little scam everyone has going on. Just kidding - of course it depends what your job is and your personality, but for me I love coming into an office and talking to people. I think it is good for the organization also.\n\nI really can’t finish all the tasks I need to finish.\n\nMy job at UNHCR is a wonderful chapter in the book of David Alexander.\n\nHear Me Out. When someone asks me what I do for a living, I always feel tempted to describe myself as a filmmaker, or even better, a documentary filmmaker, a visual storyteller, or a former journalist, a digital raconteur, a fishmonger - but for stories…. the possibilities are endless!\n\nUltimately I say I make little videos for the UN.\n\nI am in the business of advocacy - not filmmaking. Half of my time is spent navigating the internal and external communication needs of my organization. The other half is dedicated to actually creating those videos.\n\nBeing able to do both—craft visually stunning, emotionally charged, and captivating narratives that also influence people's thoughts, emotions, and actions on important issues—is incredibly satisfying and rewarding when it's done well.\n\nI sort of stumbled into this line of work, but I believe that if you work hard and listen to your inner compass, you eventually end up where you're meant to be in life...give or take a few mistakes along the way .\n\nOnly a handful of people, blessed with amazing foresight, talent, and motivation, knew exactly where they wanted to be and got there. The rest of us, who have jobs we enjoy, probably stumbled into them too through a combination of hard work, self-awareness, and a bit of luck.\n\nMy grandfather Alex Eisenstein Alexander used to say, \"The harder you work, the luckier you get.\" I’m a firm believer in that."
