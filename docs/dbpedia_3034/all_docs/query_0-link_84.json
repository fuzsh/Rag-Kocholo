        "text": "Visible Mending, directed by Samantha Moore, ¬© BFI / MediaActive Projects 2023\n\nI first met Lorna Hamilton Brown during Knit Stars Season 6.\n\nOften when we film our Knit Stars Masterclasses, we‚Äôll arrange for another expert to be present on set with the Star, to provide an extra set of eyes and to act as additional moral support for the Star during filming.\n\nLorna was Jeanette Sloan‚Äôs choice for this important role ‚Äì made even more important because, right in the middle of planning her Season 6 workshop, Jeanette had suffered the sudden loss of her beloved husband, Sam.\n\nCredit for above two photos from Jeanette‚Äôs workshop filming: Sam Sloan.\n\nLorna and her important work had been on my radar for awhile. She has been called ‚ÄúThe Banksy of knitting‚Äù for her use of the medium in social commentary.\n\nThis past week, one of Lorna‚Äôs latest projects came across my feed and I knew right away it was something that our readers needed to see‚Ä¶It‚Äôs called #TensionBirds.\n\nVisible Mending, directed by Samantha Moore, ¬© BFI / MediaActive Projects 2023\n\nThe Birds are thus named as they relieve stress as well as being based on the creation of a knitted/crocheted tension square. They‚Äôre easy to make and offer a quick portable project. They help people explore materiality, aid community engagement, provide comfort and relieve stress.\n\n‚ÄúThey will change the world one bird at a time,‚Äù Lorna says.\n\nI asked Lorna about the origin of the project, and her answer was a multi-faceted ‚Äúyarnstory‚Äù worth sharing here‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúIn February 2016, Jane Grimshaw and Anna Winston teamed up with Hastings Supports Refugees to respond to the refugee crisis that was happening on the beaches of Greece and spread throughout Europe,‚Äù Lorna said.\n\n‚ÄúThey set up the ‚ÄòBird in the hand‚Äô project. Birds were chosen as they are often seen as symbols of peace and hope. A cloth kit was created containing everything needed to make a bird. These cloth birds were just big enough to fit in the palms and pockets of refugee children, providing them with comfort.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI was keen to support the project by making a knitted or crocheted bird that could be used in a kit, so I explored different ways to make my birds. I know people don‚Äôt always want to knit a tension square, and there‚Äôs the issue of what to do with them once they are made. To encourage people to create a tension square I decided to base my bird design on a 10 cm x 10 cm square. I made a few birds for the project but didn‚Äôt develop the idea at that time.‚Äù\n\nVisible Mending, directed by Samantha Moore, ¬© BFI / MediaActive Projects 2023\n\n‚ÄúFast forward to 2017. For my final project on my Masters degree in ‚ÄòKnitted Textiles‚Äô at the Royal College of Art, I researched the therapeutic benefits of knitting for a person‚Äôs mental health by creating what I call ‚ÄòTension Birds‚Äô and made the related film ‚ÄòKnitting the Blues.‚Äô I was inspired by reading Betsan Corkhill‚Äôs book Knit for Health & Wellness. Betsan is known as a world expert on the use of therapeutic knitting for improving well-being and managing illness. She has carried out extensive research on the subject and has a website ‚Äì stitchlinks.com dedicated to the subject.‚Äù\n\nLorna‚Äôs TensionBirds were recently featured in ‚ÄúVisible Mending,‚Äù an animated short film by Samantha Moore that was recently featured in the New York Times Ops-Docs series. The short documentary explores how knitting helps us embrace life‚Äôs messy imperfections. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nVisible Mending, directed by Samantha Moore, ¬© BFI / MediaActive Projects 2023\n\n‚ÄúWhen Sam contacted me to see if I would be interested in being involved in the film, she said ‚ÄòTextile arts have a set of assumptions (often gender, class, or race related) that have built up around them, but I would like this film to break down those stereotypes and make a real direct human connection between the challenges we face, and a deeply felt need to create that does not fade with age.‚Äô I say no to a lot of projects but this was one really resonated with me,‚Äù Lorna shared.\n\nLorna is planning to offer in person and virtual workshops, where you can learn to make your tension / gauge swatches into Tension Birds, and also explore larger themes around knitting, community and emotion. To be kept up to date, follow Lorna on Instagram @lhamiltonbrown or contact her via her website lornahamiltonbrown.com.\n\nTo watch Samantha Moore‚Äôs charming and thought-provoking animated film, Visible Mending, click here.\n\nThis week inside our Yarniverse Membership, we‚Äôll be releasing Beata Jezek‚Äôs workshop from Season 2, as well as the first segment of fresh ‚Äúwhere are they now‚Äù content I filmed with Beata last week.\n\nWe‚Äôll be talking about how her life has changed dramatically since she filmed her Knit Stars workshop‚Ä¶what she‚Äôs frogged and what she‚Äôs created‚Ä¶and teasing the next Yarniverse quarterly kit that includes (surprise!) a custom Hedgehog color on their newest luxury base.\n\n(If you‚Äôre already a Yarniverse member, watch your email for updates! And you‚Äôre not a member yet, it‚Äôs about to get even more fun and exciting in there‚Ä¶so you can join in at the monthly rate, here).\n\nAnd since I know you‚Äôll ask about the adorable baby sweater in the photo above‚Ä¶\n\nThat‚Äôs sweet baby Freddie in ‚ÄúThursday Sweater,‚Äù a pattern by Beata that‚Äôs free on Ravelry and the Hedgehog Fibres site, too.\n\nThe pattern calls for 150g for the smallest size, but I dug into the projects on Ravelry and you can probably make it from a single skein of Hedgehog Sock ‚Äì or add in some fingering weight scraps or minis from your stash to make your own fade.\n\nTo get you started, we‚Äôve put some special Hedgehog kits on sale this week ‚Äì along with everything else on our site üôÇ\n\nThis exclusive kit has a full skein of Hedgehog Sock plus a cute mini for contrast. It comes with a free PDF download of ‚ÄúLady Whistledown,‚Äù a knit design by Louis Boria, and a crochet cowl option too.\n\nGet the kit 20% off here, while they last.\n\nMore than a decade ago, I dubbed January ‚ÄúSelfish Knitting Month,‚Äù and it‚Äôs since been re-dubbed Self Care Stitching Month.\n\nHowever you look at it‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a great time to treat yourself to a simple, meditative cast-on with a really nice yarn.\n\nWe‚Äôve put our whole site on sale 20% off this week. And that includes everything from needles and bags, to basic yarns, all the way up to 100% cashmere.\n\nAnd when it comes to cashmere, it doesn‚Äôt get much better than Clinton Hill ‚ÄúBespoke.‚Äù It‚Äôs a quick-knitting worsted weight that‚Äôs been treated to make it pill-resistant. Plus, Clinton Hill makes all their patterns free with yarn purchase!\n\nTo shop our Bespoke inventory at 20% off and get some great project ideas, click here.\n\nCrustless Pizza\n\nThis crustless pizza from TheBigMan‚ÄôsWorld.com is yummy comfort food for those who are sensitive to gluten, like me! Cheesy, meaty, and easy to customize, it‚Äôs made in just ONE skillet and takes 15 minutes to make.\n\nIngredients\n\n1/2 lb lean ground turkey ground beef works\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n1 clove garlic minced\n\n1 tablespoon Italian seasonings\n\n1 cup cheddar cheese grated\n\n1/2 cup pizza sauce\n\n4 small mushrooms chopped\n\n1/4 cup olives slices\n\n8 slices pepperoni\n\n1/2 cup mozzarella cheese grated\n\nInstructions"
