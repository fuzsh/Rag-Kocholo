        "text": "Luciano DelSignore, one of metro Detroit’s most celebrated chefs, traces his love of food back to Italy’s Abruzzo region.\n\nThere, he spent summers on his grandparents’ farm, learning and helping them tend to livestock, harvest fruits and vegetables. Food in Abruzzo, he says, is rarely mucked up with too many ingredients, remembering how he gathered eggs for his grandmother and how those eggs ended up an breakfast dish.\n\n“She would take those three warm farm eggs every morning, put three yolks in a glass and three tablespoons of sugar. She would whip those yolks with a spoon. And I could hear the spoon clinking in the glass. ... I could hear the spoon while I was sleeping, and that’s what would wake me up as she’s making my breakfast. And then I get up and go eat this custard that was fluffy, a light-yellow egg custard that was to die for.”\n\nRead more:\n\nDelSignore’s food foundation — which influences his menus at Bacco Ristorante in Southfield and six metro area Bigalora Wood Fired Cucinas — is the subject of “Dinner in Abruzzo: A Journey Home with my Culinary Godfather,” a documentary by Free Press restaurant critic Mark Kurlyandchik, which will be shown today at the Freep Film Festival.\n\nThe film follows DelSignore and Maybel Gray chef James Rigato, who refers to DelSignore as the godfather of metro Detroit chefs, to Abruzzo.\n\nIn honor of the film, we are celebrating the flavor of Abruzzo with recipes provided by DelSignore.\n\nThe food and culture\n\nAbruzzo is east of Rome at about the midpoint of Italy, stretching from mountains to the Pescara coastal region, along the Adriatic Sea.\n\nBoth sets of DelSignore’s grandparents, Nazzarena and Costantino and Maria and Giuseppe, lived in the town of Fonte d’Amore. All DelSignore’s aunts, uncles and every first cousin, he says, live in Italy. His parents, John and Lina, were the only ones from their families to move to the U.S., though they still have a home in the village of Fonte d’Amore.\n\nDelSignore spent his summers in Abruzzo. His parents took turns sending him and his late brother, Tino, there. “They wanted us to learn to speak Italian, learn the food and learn the culture,” DelSignore says.\n\nDo a quick Internet search of the cuisine of Abruzzo, and you might see it described as bread, pasta, meat, cheese and wine. “That shows up at every dinner, every meal,” DelSignore says.\n\nBut dig deeper, as DelSignore does in the film talking about his uncle Tony’s truffle hunting and how his relatives put up (preserve) what they farm, and you will find the food is earthy, hearty and indigenous to the region.\n\nDelSignore’s family hails from central Abruzzo, more in the mountainous area, which yields more of a “meat-centric” fare.\n\n“It’s meat forward because we are not on the coast,” DelSignore says.\n\nPork, he says, also is a big part of the Abruzzese diet.\n\n“There’s lots of house-made charcuteries and porchetta for celebrations,” DelSignore says.\n\nLamb has a huge influence there, as do rabbit and chicken.\n\n“It’s one of the reasons I love rabbit so much and it always finds it way on my menu is because of Abruzzo,” he says. Arrosticini is one Abruzzo’s famous food. It’s cubes or lamb threaded on wooden skewers and grilled. There’s no marinade, no sauce. Just a sprinkling of sea salt — simple.\n\nAnd oh, the pasta...\n\nAnd the the pasta in Abruzzo? The most famous is chitarra (ke-tarra). It’s like spaghetti, but thicker. Chitarra gets its name from a tool used to make it that resembles a guitar.\n\n“It’s a wooden frame that has a lot of little strings going across it, and you roll the pasta through those strings. And when it’s forced through the strings, it puts a textured ridge on the square pasta, so it’s good on holding the sauce,” DelSignore says.\n\nYou’ll find the pasta readily available about most local Italian stores like Cantoro’s Italian Market and Trattoria in Plymouth. If you can’t find it, DelSignore says to substitute a good egg noodle, like a dried fettucine, opposed to a spaghetti or linguine because the packaged spaghetti and linguine you see in the store doesn’t have egg in it.\n\nChitarra is used in today’s recipe for Stewed Lamb Ragu. The ragu features lamb, tomato sauce, onion and garlic and as the main ingredients. It’s the long simmering process that makes the lamb tender and deepens the flavor.\n\n“I love stewed meat in tomato sauce because it’s my comfort food, it’s my go to,” DelSignore says.\n\nBeautiful, simple and good\n\nAt today’s screening, “Dinner in Abruzzo” will take viewers back to DelSignore’s family farms and home. “We still own those farms, DelSignore says. “They’ve been passed down to families.”\n\nAnd they still own olive trees. “We harvest the olives from those olives trees we own and have it sent to me,” he says.\n\nIt’s these little regions that DelSignore says are phenomenal, and undisturbed.\n\n“Everytime I go there, I am amazed at how beautiful and how simple and how good it is in Abruzzo,” he says.\n\nContact Susan Selasky at 313-222-6872 or sselasky@freepress.com.

Once the garlic is golden, add the lamb. Cook lamb until all the water is evaporated out of the meat, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the onions and cook for another 15 minutes, then add the wine.\n\nCook for 10 minutes, then add the tomatoes, cover and simmer for an hour.\n\nAdd the bay leaves and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2-2 hours more.\n\nTo serve, toss the hot cooked pasta with the stewed lamb ragu. Top with Parmigiano-Reggiano and fresh chopped parsley.\n\nFrom Luciano DelSignore, owner of Bacco Ristorante in Southfield.\n\nTested by Susan Selasky for the Free Press Test Kitchen.\n\nArrosticini (Lamb Skewers)\n\nServes: 6 / Preparation time: 30 minutes / Total time: 45 minutes\n\nThese lamb skewers are an essential dish in the Abruzzo region. The key to these is not cooking them over a super-high flame. You want the lamb fat to melt. Some recipes even call for adding pieces of lamb fat between the cubed meat.\n\n12 thick wooden skewers (8 inches long) soaked in water for 24 hours\n\n1 1/2 pounds domestic leg of lamb cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n\nSea salt to taste\n\nThread the lamb cubes onto the skewers, making 12 evenly sized skewers. Prepare a charcoal grill, getting a medium-size flame going. Oil the grates to prevent the meat from sticking. Place the skewers on the grill. You want to cook the lamb skewers not too hot, not too cold, but enough to melt the fat of the lamb and cook the meat at the same time. Sprinkle with sea salt on all sides while grilling the skewers. Continue grilling until the lamb is cooked all the way through. Do not overcook or the meat will be chewy. Sprinkle again with sea salt just before serving.\n\nFrom Luciano DelSignore, owner of Bacco Ristorante in Southfield.\n\nTested by Susan Selasky for the Free Press Test Kitchen.\n\nSpaghetti ai Frutti di Mare Bianco\n\nServes: 6 / Preparation time: 30 minutes / Total time: 45 minutes\n\n4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\n3 garlic cloves, peeled, minced\n\n1 teaspoon chile flakes\n\n6 white shrimp, peeled and de-veined\n\n6 sea scallops\n\n6 large calamari tubes cut in large strips\n\n6 calamari tentacles\n\n2 pounds PEI mussels\n\n2 pounds Manilla clams\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\n2 cups of white wine\n\n2 cups fish fume or clam juice\n\n1 pound spaghetti\n\n2 tablespoons fresh chopped Italian parsley\n\nIn a large stock pot, heat the oil, garlic and chile flakes on low heat until golden. Add the calamari and begin to cook for 3-4 minutes. Add all the shrimp, scallops, mussels and clams. Season with salt and pepper. Add the white wine and fume and simmer until reduced by half. Set the seafood sauce aside.\n\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt. Cook the spaghetti until very al dente, one minute less then the package calls for, add to the seafood sauce.\n\nContinue to cook the pasta in the seafood sauce so that starches from the pasta go into the sauce; this will will make it creamy.\n\nAdd chopped parsley and a little more olive oil and serve.\n\nFrom Luciano DelSignore, owner of Bacco Ristorante in Southfield.\n\nTested by Susan Selasky for the Free Press Test Kitchen."
