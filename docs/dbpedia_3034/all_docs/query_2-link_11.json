        "text": "At least this man was honest about faking it.. Yesterday's Keuringsdienst van Waarde documentary on Dutch television showed how big brands fool the ignorant consumer when it comes to olive oil. The man on the right was very transparant about refining and bleaching lampante olive oil, into something they blend with a tiny % of (extra) virgin olive oil to sell it in the supermarket. Absolutely insane. Lampante olive oil is the worst quality olive oil, without any health benefits and without refining, it smells and tastes like sh*t. And after refining, it just smells and taste like nothing (paint maybe?) I guess you all can do the math; the blending helps big brands to have a cheap product with good margins on the shelf - way easier than educating people on the real deal. Consumers in the Netherlands but literally in any country around the globe still have that feeling that those nicely labeled, Mediterranean-style \"classico\" olive oils are good for you. Think twice when you are at your grocery store (or better, visit a specialty store!) Unfortunately, these kind of practices are (partly) allowed so those refining companies and the big brands can keep doing what they do. We as small brands and with a group of amazing quality enthusiasts in the specialty industry can only continue to educate people. It was therefore great to hear Wilma van Grinsven-Padberg giving a nice piece of education during the documentary, we need that! For Dutchies, have a look here to watch the 25 minute episode: https://lnkd.in/ehTvViYE #oliveoil #extravirginoliveoil"
