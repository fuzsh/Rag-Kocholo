        "text": "Olive oil has been used throughout history as a versatile and healthy ingredient. It comes from the liquid fats that are extracted from the olive fruit.\n\nThe health benefits of olive oil are well-known, and it is a key ingredient in many popular diets. This specific type of oil is high in healthy monounsaturated fats and contains vitamins and minerals that are essential for our overall health.\n\nSo unlike conventional cooking oils like vegetable oils (how long does vegetable oil last?), you can expect there are a few health benefits to this age-old classic.\n\nThe History of Olive Oil\n\nOlive oil has been used for centuries as cooking oil, medicine, and even as a fuel for lamps. The history of olive oil is a long and interesting one.\n\nThe olive tree is thought to have originated in the Mediterranean region. The first evidence of a type of olive oil production dates back to around 4000 BC. Olive oil was an important commodity in the ancient world and was used by the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians.\n\nOlive oil continued to be an important cooking oil throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It wasn’t until the early 20th century that olive oil began to be used as a fuel for lamps.\n\nThe Olive Arrives in America\n\nDuring the mid-16th century, Spanish missionaries were recorded to have introduced olives (What wine goes well with olives?) to the Americas. Eventually, the missionaries began to establish their missions in the California Area. This is where their olive cultivation thrived and saw the first fruiting olive trees within the United States. At present, there are olive groves out there that can be dated back to up to 150 years old and this is also the region where 95% of olives are sourced from in the United States.\n\nFor example, there are specific types of olive oil that don’t do well with pan-frying because it burns up quite easily. So take note, and check out the different types of olive oil.\n\nHigh Phenolic Olive Oil\n\nOlive oil with high phenolic content is considered to be the most premium out of all the different kinds of olive oils available.\n\nTo be considered under this class of olive oil, it should contain the right combination of polyphenols or healthy fats that help in promoting good cardiovascular and cognitive health.\n\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil\n\nExtra virgin olive oil, or E-V-O-O to some, is a type of olive oil that is regarded for its higher quality.\n\nIt is ideal for salad dressings, dipping bread, or drizzling over cooked vegetables (how long do cooked vegetables last?). This is because its taste profile has hints of a fruity and peppery flavor that goes well when drizzled over a wide range of dishes.\n\nVirgin Olive Oil\n\nVirgin olive oil is also high quality but has a milder flavor compared to its extra-virgin cousin.\n\nThis slightly neutral flavor makes it ideal for cooking or baking and has that bit of flavor that you get from your typical EVOO.\n\nRefined Olive Oil\n\nThe extraction process for refined olive oil calls for both ripe and black olives. Because of this, it has the least amount of extra virgin olive oil among all the types listed here.\n\nThis oil does well in culinary applications especially if you're cooking at high temperatures like frying up bacon. It also has the same amount of caloric content as the other olive oils.\n\nPure Olive Oil\n\nPure olive oil is a mix of EVOO, virgin olive oil, and refined olive oil. This is what you should get when you’re looking to fry or sauté vegetables.\n\nIt’s because of its neutral taste profile coupled with a little bit of a hint of olive fragrance that makes this the perfect oil to drizzle on your pan before cooking breakfast. Pure olive oil can also be used as a massage oil because of its fragrance.\n\nOlive Pomace Oil\n\nIf you're looking for olive oil but don't have the EVOO budget on you, don't fret. Olive pomace oil is still olive oil by it made from the residues that are left after pressing olives for extraction.\n\nSometimes you'll find that they mix this with EVOO to improve its overall quality. Although it can be used for cooking purposes, olive pomace oil can be used to polish furniture.\n\nOrganic Olive Oil\n\nOrganic olive oil uses the same extraction process. The difference with organic olive oils is that the olives that they use have not been exposed to any chemicals that may harm the human body.\n\nWith these six different types of olive oils, it's a fact that this oil has a wide range of uses. From culinary, and topical, to maintaining your furniture, olive oil has you covered. Also, by knowing these five types of olive oil, you'll now be familiar with their specific uses and how to properly use them.\n\nCheck out your local artisan olive oil producers if you ever live in and around the Texas Hill Country. There are even organic olive oil producers that have that right bump in healthy fats that will improve your overall health.\n\nThe Health Benefits of Olive Oil\n\nOlive oil is a healthy fat that can help you lose weight, lower cholesterol, and reduce inflammation. The health benefits of olive oil are well-known, and it is a key ingredient in many popular diets.\n\nOne example of a diet regimen where olive oil plays a big part is the Mediterranean diet. This nutritional plan proves to be beneficial for overall health, including reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nToday, we all know that olive oil is packed with nutrients that can help boost our overall health. It contains vitamins A, D, E, and K which are essential for our body's health. It also helps reduce bad cholesterol in the blood because olive oil is a rich source of monounsaturated fats.\n\nTexan Takes on Olive Oil\n\nAs we all in Texas go about doing things, we have this certain approach to making things bigger and better. And, of course, this is the same with olive oil. With the wealth of knowledge that we have in olive cultivation and oil extraction in the state of Texas, there is a healthy number of homegrown artisanal olive oil brands that you can find at your local markets.\n\nFrom infused oils, and extra virgin olive oils, to virgin oil dips that may just complement well with your daily snack routine, here are some good examples of the best olive oil that Texas has to offer.\n\nGrapevine Olive Oil Co.\n\nThe Grapevine Olive Oil Co. opened back in the Spring of 2010 in Grapevine, Texas. Their location was specifically selected by the owners because it's in the middle of all the vineyards, wineries, and the overall atmosphere of Grapevine's deep connection with the culinary arts."
