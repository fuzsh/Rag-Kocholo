        "text": "I always picture\n\nthe Merlot\n\nas the jelly inside\n\nof the donut\n\nI talked to my cousin Rachel, also a sommelier, who had grown up with me in Johnson County. She said, “Just think about it. Imagine if we started a campaign for adults to drink wine instead of soft drinks in the U.S.” She listed the benefits of drinking wine in moderation, like lowering bad cholesterol and increasing antioxidant levels. She mentioned obesity levels, tooth decay, and diabetes in relation to sugary-drinks consumption.\n\nIt has a beautiful brightness,\n\nlots of sea salt\n\nand oyster\n\nIn my early adulthood, Rachel had taught me to see drinking as a wild and creative territory. Traveling with Rachel, I began to keep a notebook that I titled the sommelier’s mother tongue. I took notes of how Rachel and her sommelier friends described wine and spirits, arranging their words into poetry. In the notebook, I wrote down her description of a Sauvignon Blanc we drank together: “It tastes a little bit like elderflower to me which is like licking a sweaty girl.” In high school, I had been a part of a group that preached to teens about the evils of alcohol. At the time, I wanted to fit in with my churchgoing peers. Sadly, those messages about alcohol and its evils stayed with me well into adulthood. When I began to drink in college, after my abstinent high school years, I drank like the rest of the students in our dry county — to get drunk. We drank Natty Light, Everclear mixed with fruit, or wine. For us, there were only two kinds of wine — white and red, and I knew nothing about either, nor did I seek such information.\n\nAfter college, when Rachel began studying to become a sommelier, I observed her curiosity, her way of drinking, and her seemingly miraculous ability to do a blind tasting and identify the origin, region, climate, and age of a wine. Spending time with her, I became curious to try different wines and spirits, to map their regions, to trace their history.\n\nBeer is\n\na sommelier's\n\nwater\n\nArkansas’ war on alcohol can be traced back to the 1800s, the Temperance Movement, and Bible-thumping preachers. When I started researching the origins of dry counties, I couldn’t get past this one fact: In Prohibition-era Arkansas, the KKK had over 50,000 members. They worked with local law enforcement to enforce Prohibition laws. For example, in the 1920s, when the U.S. created the Prohibition Bureau, agents in the bureau deputized volunteers from the KKK to enforce Prohibition laws. During that period, membership increased, driven by their ideas of cleaning up and purifying communities. Enforcement of Prohibition law disproportionately targeted immigrants, Catholics, and African Americans.\n\nAfter reading about the involvement of the KKK during Prohibition, I drove to Harrison, Arkansas. I knew I probably couldn’t figure out how the KKK is involved in the politics of dry counties, but sometimes just driving and listening to the people I meet along the way helps me sort out ideas. Harrison has served as the national headquarters for the Knights of the KKK since the ’80s, when Thom Robb took over as national director.\n\nOn my way into Harrison, I drove past a billboard featuring a white family sandwiched between words about “White Pride.” Businesses on the central square had signs in the window that read Back the Blue and Blue Lives Matter. I walked around town talking to locals. One white man who I met on the main square near a Confederate statue said, “I’ll say this about Harrison and racism — it has been known as a racist place; in fact, the most racist place in the country for a long time, mainly because of the Klan. But this is what people don’t realize — here’s the thing about it — there’s racism all over the place.”\n\nArkansans tell me it isn’t fair to write about Harrison and the KKK — that it reinforces negative stereotypes about the state. But the White Pride billboard still graces the highway. The Harrison Community Task Force on Race Relations did launch a petition to take down the billboard, but I am waiting to write about the successful movement that finally removes it.\n\nIt was heavy\n\nripe\n\nlike raw meat\n\nhad the quality of blood\n\nArriving in Royal in Garland County, about 15 minutes from Mount Ida, we drove past a Baptist church with a sign out front that read: “ETERNITY SMOKING OR NON-SMOKING.” On Yelp, a customer who visited a liquor store on the county line in the area wrote that it was “the only beacon of alcoholic availability in a sea of dry counties.” When we reached Crystal Springs, we stopped at the first of its two competing county line liquor stores.\n\nI asked a guy arranging bottles of bourbon outside the store why dry counties existed. He said, “I think because of the Bible.” And then he walked over to his car and pulled out two half-empty bourbon bottles. He explained that Arkansas was a “good old boy state” that issued a limited number of distribution licenses, which benefited him as the only licensed bourbon distributor in the area. “Even Walmart isn’t allowed to sell liquor,” he said. In 2012, Walmart had thrown its weight behind a campaign to turn dry counties in its home state wet — and even with more money than God, it lost.\n\nIt tasted like a bonbon,\n\ncandy-ish, sweet\n\nand then shifted to savory\n\nAt the second liquor store we visited, the woman behind the counter was engaged in a deep conversation with a customer about how COVID was just like the flu and had always existed. We looked at moonshine flavors: apple pie, hunch punch, lemon drop, sour razzin’ berry. Liz told me, “My grandfather Lyman went blind drinking moonshine.”\n\nI wanted to know more about her grandfather Lyman and how his drinking had affected her family. Liz recounted, “My dad was a social drinker. He would go to The Vapors and other popular clubs in Hot Springs. His favorite drink was a dirty martini with vermouth and two olives, and he had a glass of red wine with dinner every night. As soon as I reached the age of 2, he stopped drinking. He became a teetotaler.” Liz thought that he didn’t want her growing up seeing him drink. “He maybe had bad memories seeing his father drink and not be a good father. I never asked him,” Liz said. Her father died in 2020.\n\nLiz wanted to photograph individuals with their crystal collections. The lady behind the counter at the liquor store told us she had a large crystal collection, but she said she was worried her dogs would bite us if we went to her house to see it. She recommended that we visit the place across the road. Outside the store across the road, I saw an outhouse, wagon wheels, and all kinds of knickknacks. Inside, I found a room covered in bear rugs and stuffed snakes, another of pickled vegetables for sale, and one filled with display cases of Native American artifacts, crystals, and the head of a Black child — the type of object some people in the South used as a lawn decoration. The woman working behind the counter said that the founder of the store, now deceased, had collected the objects over 40 years from all over Arkansas.\n\nEntering Mount Ida, we passed by Geode Place, Holistic Hollow, and Broken Rock Road. We stopped at every house or business that had a crystal collection outside. I talked to the owner of a crystal shop who had once been a truck driver, and he said, “What got me into this business was desperation.” He didn’t want me to interview him because, he said, it would be better for me to read two volumes of the history of Mount Ida.\n\nHe then pulled the books off a shelf and handed them to me, saying, “I could get it all wrong, so don’t talk to me.” Instead of reading the books, I followed him around the store as he showed me blush-colored rocks from Oklahoma shaped like tiny roses and phantom crystals where it looks like there is a ghost inside the crystal but it is where the crystal stopped growing. I thought I would talk him into an interview; instead, he talked me into buying some rock roses.\n\nOutside his store, I met several crystal collectors who were traveling around the country in an RV to buy crystals. They talked about how COVID-19 was invented by scientists and drug companies so that they could get rich. I told them that in July 2021, only 35% of the Arkansas population was fully vaccinated, and the Delta variant was killing people in record numbers. I wanted to talk about dry counties, and, as someone who had survived COVID-19, it was hard for me to listen to conspiracy theories.\n\nWhen I asked people about dry counties, they seemed to accept them as a fact and talked about making beer runs or driving to the county line. Although some people mentioned the Bible, nobody said they didn’t drink, just that they had to drive farther to do it. We all agreed that we had been drinking more during the pandemic, and the liquor store owners and workers who I spoke to said that sales had never been stronger. According to a 2021 study, Arkansas liquor stores in select counties saw their sales tax revenue grow 35.9% between September and November 2020 on a year-over-year basis.\n\nAperol Spritz\n\nis the sommelier's Gatorade.\n\nYou can drink them all night\n\nand get up and go running.\n\nWhen we stopped to get a Dr Pepper at a corner store, an older woman who was demonstrating a country line dance move and had manicured peach fingernails told us, “You look like the kind of girls who drive around and sleep in a tent.” Liz and I looked at each other and laughed. A woman who came in the store told me that she had sold even more crystals during the pandemic, explaining, “If you ever have to sell your crystal collection, it’s kinda like guns — they don’t depreciate.”"
