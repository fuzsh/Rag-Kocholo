        "text": "Olive oil has been used in many other ways over the millennium... greasing wheels, cleaning the body, lighting ancient homes in lamps, polishing furniture, but the most important use for the golden elixir throughout the ages is in la Cucina.\n\nBut we don't always give our olive oil the respect and care it deserves. After all, we should respect an oil that I've witnessed with my own eyes still coming from trees hundreds and even thousands of years old. Olives are a gift from the gods... a gift of Mother Nature herself. They are a link to our past and a healthy path to our future. Trees that bear this wonderful little fruit can be thousands of years old.\n\nHere are some ways you can give respect to your olive oil...\n\nFirst of all, not all olive oil deserves your respect. Many oils sold in supermarkets are a mix of oils. Some sold as \"olive oil\" may be a blend of olive and other oils, like canola, soybean or sunflower. The worst of this type might even contain\n\nExtra virgin olive oil contains monounsaturated fats, but are also rich in polyphenols--organic antioxidant compounds that are found in plants with many health benefits.\n\nDon't even bother buying \"light\", \"pure\" or even those labeled simply \"virgin\". These are always blends or highly processed and lack the benefits of Extra Virgin in terms of flavor and health benefits. Buy only Extra Virgin Olive Oil... and even then, check the label to make sure the bottle actually contains 100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil.\n\nDon't be cheated! Many large corporations are misleading consumers by their labeling and others (the Italian Mafia) are perpetuating outright fraud. Read more about olive oils, what to look for, how it is made and how to avoid the fake stuff in my article, HERE.\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil is higher in polyphenols, low in saturated fat and contains antioxidants, all helping to reduce the risk of heart disease. Phony olive oil blends aren't just a deception, they are a crime against public health.\n\nIf you want to fry using olive oil, you might be doing what I used to do--frying in \"light olive oil\" and saving the Extra Virgin Olive Oil for use directly in recipes. Extra Virgin has a lower smoke point, meaning it's not the best for frying, but here's a trick: Use half Extra Virgin for that olive oil flavor and then add half canola oil to raise the smoke point, which will make your fried foods crispier. Canola has no taste of its own so won't ruin your recipes.\n\nStill, referring to my last point, there are famous chefs who fry only in EVO. If you want to try this, just remember that low smoke point and cook with a lower heat to ensure your food is properly cooked through. If you don't, you might pull the food out when it looks nicely browned, but the interior will be underdone.\n\nWith quality oils, whether domestic or imported, look for a “pressing date” on the label. Sometimes it’s called the “harvest date.” This tells you how fresh the olive oil is. If it’s beyond six months, pass it by. Nutrients (and flavor) in olive oil start to deteriorate six months after pressing.\n\nThe \"pressing date\" or \"harvest date\" is not the same as the \"best used by” date that you will see on supermarket brands of olive oil. Mass producers of supermarket varieties of olive oil will put \"best used dates\" as long as two years past the date of the actual pressing of the oil. This is simply to prevent people from allowing their oil to go rancid if they store it for too long at home.\n\nIf you invest in expensive, high quality Extra Virgin Olive Oils, don't buy more than you can use within six months. An olive oil producer I spoke to in Tuscany told me that one year is the absolute limit olive oil will remain \"fresh\" (and that's only if it's stored properly... more on that in a second).\n\nWhen buying olive oil in Italy, beware of the aged \"tourist oil\" that many bed & breakfasts or agriturismo (farm resort) sell. They might save the fresh stuff for their own use and sell canned or bottled out-of-date oil to tourists. We got stuck with a can of this once. Tasted like motor oil!\n\nConsider buying Unfiltered, Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil. This is the type of oil that really impressed me in Italy. It tends to look cloudy because the particulates produced in the first, cold pressing are left in. I shake it before using. This offers tremendous, complex flavors, along with added health components. Use unfiltered oils directly on foods, salads, drizzled on bruschetta, cheese, etc. Some argue that removing the small particles (by either filtering or centrifuge) extend the life of the oil in storage. If you buy only what you need for short periods of time, this isn't an issue. I tend to buy an imported private label unfiltered EVO from a local Italian specialty shop which lasts a month or two for salads, bruschetta and pizza.\n\nNever buy olive oil in clear bottles! Light causes olive oil to lose flavor and freshness. Buy only in very dark green or brown bottles, or better yet... buy your Extra Virgin olive oil in cans, or better yet, do what Italians do and store your oil in a \"Fusti\", a stainless steel storage dispenser made for this purpose. I keep my best EVO in a 1 gallon Fusti.\n\nI also want to suggest that you try oils produced in other countries other than Italy. I love Italian EVO but there are also some excellent oils produced in Greece, Morocco, Portugal and even California! Just make certain they are 100% EVO and not a blend.\n\nIf you find a place where you can taste the oil before you by, please do so. In recent years there have been many \"olive oil and vinegar taprooms\" opening up all across the country. We have several in eastern Pennsylvania. You can taste and then buy the amount you need. As when selecting a wine, your palate might tell you that one oil is more bitter and another a bit fruitier or sweeter. For instance, I'm not a fan of bitter oils... I tend to buy fruitier types. Look for olive oils in local open air markets where they will allow you to taste first, or from specialty olive oil shops that will sell olive oil dispensed from the spigots of their shiny, stainless steel tanks (fusti). These oils can be expensive, but at least you know you are getting the taste that you want.\n\nTry shopping for high quality Extra Virgin Olive Oils online. Even Amazon has many artisan oils on their site. Or Google for them and see what pops up. I'll put some links at the end of this article.\n\nBottom line: Store your oil properly and buy the best you can afford. If you use a lot of olive oil, buy it in tins only (we go through about a gallon every 3-4 months or so). Store your oil in a dark place, especially if you buy it in bottles (never buy clear bottles!). Don't keep small, expensive bottles of Extra Virgin on your counter--keep them in your cupboards, away from light. Oxygen is also an enemy of olive oil, so as your larger container gets less full, you might consider transferring the remaining oil into smaller containers. For daily use, keep some oil into small olive oil carafes, such as my favorite from Emile Henry (photo left, on Amazon).\n\nMangia bene... ama molto!\n\n--Jerry Finzi\n\nFocaccia is one of the world's oldest flatbreads with roots in ancient Greece and with the Etruscans, even before the Roman Empire reared its head. The Romans called it panis focacius (bread of the hearth) in Latin. In its basic form, it is a leavened bread, very similar to pizza but without all that cheese. There have been versions of focaccia all through the Mediterranean coastline in Europe and northern Africa. In ancient Roman days, it looked like a very simple, flat round of pull-apart bread. It was a meal to be carried by shepherds and fishermen and meant to be eaten later. In regions of neighboring France it's called fougasse. In Argentina and Brazil--both with large Italian immigrant populations--its name is fugazza and they can be either topped with stringy cheese or even double-crusted and stuffed.\n\nThe common modern form of focaccia is dimpled with fingertips to make little wells that can hold savory items like olives, cherry tomatoes, peppers, red onion, sliced potatoes, garlic or even sweet things like figs, pear slices, blueberries, walnuts, dates, honey, anise seeds, bulbing fennel (finnocchio), orange zest or grapes. The top is usually brushed or drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and sprinkled with rosemary, sea salt, pepper or other spices. Of course, you can sprinkle a bit of cheese (usually grated), but go to far and you've crossed the line between focaccia and pizza. The variations are endless.\n\nIn Italy, most pasticceria (pastry shops), panetteria (bread bakery) and even bars will have slices of focaccia often sliced and priced by weight. (Note: A \"bar\" in Italy is a family friendly place to get cappuccino and pastry in the morning and panini for lunch.)\n\nTypical Italian offerings of focaccia\n\nFocaccia is usually baked in 1\" deep, dark steel pans. The texture is usually bready and for that reason a high protein \"strong\" flour (bread flour here in the U.S.) is used. The thickness also has the benefit of being used to make panini, slicing through the middle and stuffing with provolone, mozzarella, prosciutto or thing slices of salami.\n\nSlices of focaccia ready for snacks, lunch or along with dinner\n\nIngredients\n\nYeast mixture:\n\n1-3/4 cups warm water (110-115F)\n\n1-1/5 tablespoons fast acting yeast\n\n1 tablespoon honey\n\nFor the dough:\n\n1 cup King Arthur all-purpose flour\n\n2-3 cups King Arthur bread flour (plus extra bench flour)\n\n1 tablespoon sugar\n\n1 tablespoon sea salt\n\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n\nExtra virgin olive oil for the pan\n\nToppings:\n\nExtra virgin olive oil (for brushing)\n\nCherry tomatoes\n\n1/4 cup grated cheese (using 1/4 holes/box grater), provolone, asiago, or caciocavallo\n\n(cheese is optional)\n\nDried thyme, rosemary, oregano, fresh ground pepper, sea salt\n\nDirections\n\nPreheat oven to 435F with a pizza stone or steel on the center shelf.\n\nLiberally oil a dark half sheet pan with the olive oil and set aside.\n\nPlace the water in a small bowl and whisk in the yeast and honey until dissolved. Let sit until foamy, about 15 minutes.\n\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attached, place 1 cup of all-purpose flour, sugar and salt, then mix until blended for a few seconds.\n\nOnce the yeast is foamy, pour it into the mixing bowl and turn the speed to a low setting.\n\nUse a silicone spatula to scrape down the sides as you are adding flour.\n\nLittle by little, add 1/3 cup of bread flour, each time waiting until it blends into the dough mass. Keep adding flour, a bit at a time until it begins to come together in a wet, loose mass.\n\nTurn up the mixer speed to medium high and let the dough mass slap against the sides of the bowl until you see strands of gluten sticking to the sides. You might need to occasionally dust a little bit (tablespoon) of flour into the mass, as you work, but don't add too much. You do NOT want a dry dough ball.\n\nOnce you see strands have developed and your mass is no longer wet but still sticky, slow the mixer's speed down, then dust with a small amount of flour just to help turning it out onto the work surface. Use the spatula to help release it from the dough hook and bowl.\n\nPrepare a medium sized bowl by liberally coating it with olive oil. Flour the work surface.\n\nTurn out the dough mass onto your floured surface. Flour your hands.\n\nDust the top of the dough with a little bit of flour, then start kneading, folding the close end over the rear edge, while pushing it with your palm in a downwards, rolling motion. Turn the dough--1/4 turn, then repeat for 2-3 minutes.\n\nWith your cupped hands, form the dough into a round ball.\n\nPlace the ball into the oiled bowl and turn over to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap and put in a warm place to rise for 45 minutes.\n\nOnce the dough has risen, without punching it down, roll it out onto the center of your baking pan. The dough should feel very fluffy with a coating of oil.\n\nUsing the fingertips of both hands, starting in the center, gently press and slide the dough out to fill to the edges of the pan. The dough might be stretchy and slide on your oiled pan, so you will need to let it rest for 5 minutes before you can nudge it to fill the corners of your pan.\n\nAfter five minutes, adjust your dough so it fills the pan to both the edges and corners. Set aside in a warm place to rise in the pan for about 30 minutes before topping.\n\nPrepare any toppings: cutting cherry tomatoes in half, grating cheese, mixing spices together, etc.\n\nNext, press cherry tomato halves into the dough about 1-1/2\" to 2\" apart. Placing the tomatoes before the dough rises in the dough will help embed them as the dough rises.\n\nOnce the dough has puffed up to about 1\" thick, first drizzle and then brush very lightly the whole surface with extra virgin olive oil. Be delicate. If you brush too firmly, you might deflate the risen dough. If any large bubbles show up, you can pop them gently with a pointy skewer.\n\nSprinkle your spices and salt evenly across the top of the focaccia. Pay attention to the tomatoes--they will taste better with a sprinkle or salt and dried oregano.\n\nBake in the 435F oven for about 15 minutes, or until both bottom and top are lightly browned (check underneath with a metal spatula). The sides should separate from the pan.\n\nSlice into 3\"x5\" strips or 5\" rectangular pieces and serve hot, or let cool and serve at room temperature.\n\nKeep in a Tupperware in the fridge or wrap in foil (stored at room temp) for eating within 3 days.\n\nYou can reheat in a microwave by wrapping with a damp paper towel, then heating for 30 seconds (time depends on the power of your unit). To kick it up a notch, try a fresh drizzle of extra virgin olive oil (we really recommend unfiltered) or an aged balsamic. For a quick lunch, top with a draping of prosciutto. You can also slice focaccia in half and use to make a panino (sandwich) filled with thin sliced colt cuts and cheese or even cooked ingredients like grilled eggplant, tomatoes and mozzarella or roasted vegetables.\n\nGetting Creative\n\nNow that you know the basics of making focaccia, consider getting creative, as these examples illustrate. Look for color contrasts, textures and interesting shapes with your choice of toppings. Consider unusual things like asparagus, cauliflower, beets, basil, cilantro, kale, mushrooms, berries, capers, chives, colored course sea salt, and various seeds. Depending on your ingredients, you might have to partially bake your focaccia first with ingredients that can cook during the entire bake time and need to be pressed into the dough. For other things that might burn, like seeds or tender leaves like basil, position on top during later stages of baking.\n\nBe creative and make a masterpiece for a special occasion, or simply make simple focaccia for every day snacks and meals...\n\nBuon appetito!\n\n--Jerry Finzi\n\nThis is the time of year when tomatoes are ripening on the vine in both the U.S. and Italy. Even if you don't grow your own tomatoes, this can be also the time to make your own Italian style passata di pomodoro--a basic tomato sauce that has all the skins and seeds removed, with all the flavor left behind.\n\nHere in the states, the closest canned product is called \"tomato puree\". Many families in Italy make the processing and canning of passata a yearly event--a family event--making enough jars of passata to last the entire year, often enough for extended famiglia. If you're not growing enough of your own paste style tomatoes, you can always buy a bushel or two or three from your local farm stand. Some Italian families will process up to 500 pounds of passata each year!\n\nThink of passata as a basic tomato sauce which you can use in all sorts of recipes, or even as a base to make other tomato-based sauces, such as Puttanesca, Amatriciana, Bolognese (ragu), Vodka sauce, sugo (\"Sunday Gravy\") or for pizza sauce. The word \"passata\" (passed, screened, smashed) refers to the processing with a special food mill that removes the seeds, pulp and skins, leaving only the tomato sauce behind. Other family recipes might just use a common food processor or blender, but this can't really give you a genuine passata.\n\nThe cleaned, ripe tomatoes are cut up, boiled and processed to remove the skins and pulp, and finally canned in a traditional manner using a hot water bath and canning jars. Some family recipes might also add other spices or flavorings such as garlic as they boil the tomatoes, but since passata is a base to make a wide variety of sauces, you might want to add them at the time of cooking the final sauce. It is traditional, however, to add one large basil leave into each jar canned.\n\nThe Method of Making Passata\n\nAlthough you can make a passata in very small quantities, we will look at how to make a large volume for the purposes of canning and storage. We would love to promote this time honored, annual ritual here in the United States. Wouldn't it be better to have a yearly stock of your own tomato passata rather than buy supermarket sauces filled with chemical preservatives and other additives?\n\nWhat Type of Tomato is Best?\n\nIn Italy, the best for this is San Marzano tomatoes (used in the best imported canned tomatoes), which have DOP protection and are only grown in the area of Naples surrounding Mount Vesuvius. Of course, many varieties are grown in the U.S. calling themselves \"San Marzano\", but they are only a similar variety. (You can't match San Marzano tomatoes because of their uniqueness of being grown in volcanic soils.)\n\nIn reality, any good-tasting, full-bodied paste type tomato will work well. The tomato you select should have sweetness, depth of flavor, but also a touch of acidity--which benefits long preservation. Most paste tomatoes are thick fleshed and have a similar shape to San Marzano--that is, an elongated plum shape. You can also use larger cherry tomatoes or horn-pepper shaped varieties. Again, if it has a great taste, it will make a great passata. Leave the larger, beefsteak varieties for slicing and eating fresh.\n\nIf you want to grow your own heirloom canning tomatoes from seed, we can highly recommend Striped Roma (horn shaped, sweet), Jersey Devil (horn shaped, very meaty), Debarao (plum shaped, juicy) and Martino's Roma (classic plum tomato). If you want to plant enough for lots of passata, plan on planting a minimum of 10 plants of one single variety that you earmark for canning.\n\nHow Many Tomatoes?\n\nThis really depends on how ambitious you are. if you use lots of tomato sauce in your recipes each year, then start with more tomatoes. You will also need more canning jars, lids and other varied supplies and tools. Having a very large pot or cauldron to boil the tomatoes helps prevent tedious, repeated boiling/canning sessions. I highly recommend doing it the way most Italians do it--using a tomato processing mill. I also love the way Italians use a very large pot to boil their jars and to do the final canning process--they use kitchen towels to layer in the glass jars to protect them from rattling around against each other.\n\nHere are some guidelines:\n\n3 pounds of tomatoes to make 1 quart of passata.\n\n21 pounds of tomatoes will make 7 quarts of passata.\n\nOne bushel of tomatoes (about 53 lbs per bushel) will give you 15-18 quarts of passata.\n\nYou will also be using sea salt and placing basil leaves into each jar.\n\nTo sterilize the jars, boil them for 20 minutes in as large a pot as you have, layering them with cotton kitchen towels to prevent breakage.\n\nYou don't need to sterilize the jar lids since you will buy new lids each year. Simply wash them in hot soapy water before use.\n\nNever reuse jar lids!\n\nYou can reuse jars as long as they aren't chipped, but always buy new lids!\n\nNEVER re-use recycled jars from the supermarket--their glass might not be thick enough to withstand the pressures of the canning process. Large buckets – for washing and storing the tomatoes\n\nThings You will Need\n\nSharp paring knives\n\nLarge aluminium stock pot or cauldron\n\nLarge triple ring gas burner\n\nLP gas bottle(s)\n\nLarge size strainer/colander\n\nClean cotton tea towels\n\nElectric tomato mill\n\n2 ounce canning jars and new lids\n\nLarge stock pot or cauldron for boiling bottles\n\nLarge stidding spoon/paddle\n\nLarge pouring ladle\n\nLarge jar funnel\n\n(For a large volume...)\n\nOnce you have your supply of tomatoes, sort them as to their ripeness. Any tomatoes that are fully ripe (or cracked) should be cooked and processed right away. Tomatoes that need more ripening need to be laid out (not touching each other if possible) several days before processing on a large folding, catering table or even a sheet of plywood under a covered porch, or on a large table in your house. This will ensure they attain full ripeness. A ripe tomato will have reached its full color, won't feel too hard when squeezed gently, and will have an obvious fresh tomato scent when the skin is held close to the nose.\n\nBefore processing, remove any tomatoes that might be overripe, with a slightly rotten odor. A good sniff will tell you if they are OK or not. A ripe tomato will smell sweet with a strong tomato scent. An over-ripe tomato will smell nearly rotten--a bit sour. Your nose will tell you, so if it's unpleasant, toss it.\n\nRemoved any remaining stems by grasping the stem firmly between your fingers and giving a sharp twist.\n\nNext, run fresh water over your tomatoes to clean them, placing them in any type of large plastic tub or even a new 5 gallon bucket.\n\nNow cut only enough tomatoes in half or quarters to fill 1/2 of your large pot or cauldron. Cut off any obvious defects or blemishes. Toss them into your cauldron or large pot as you work. -- The reason for not filling the pot with water is that the cut tomatoes first boiled in the pot will produce their own liquid, which becomes the boiling liquid to cook more uncut tomatoes. You might see some passata recipes that either remove the juicy centers before processing, or which boil cut tomatoes in water. Doing either will only lessen the intensity of pure tomato flavor.\n\nSet up the cauldron over a portable gas cooker outside and bring your cut tomatoes to a boil and stir until they produce a boiling liquid.\n\nAfter your cut tomatoes come to a boil, you can add more un-cut tomatoes until you fill your pot, then bring back to a boil and cook for another 10-15 minutes.You want to stir the tomatoes from time to time, so you'll need a fairly large wooden spoon or paddle.\n\nThe next step is to strain as much water out of your tomatoes as possible: for smaller amounts, use either a large colander (in Italian, scolapasta): for large volumes, you can use a clean, plastic milk crate lined with a clean pillowcase.\n\nYou can use a standard hand-cranked food mill or a manual tomato milling machine to process the tomatoes, but if you're doing a large volume, you should consider investing in a powered tomato mill. The more power the unit has, the faster your processing will go. You might need to set up your milling machine on a low table, with bowl on the table to capture the pulp and a large container on the floor to capture the passata.\n\nTo start processing your tomatoes, allow the sauce to pour into a large bowl, pot or plastic container, and a bowl or pan to catch the pulp. (Carefully read directions from your manufacturer). Repeat as needed. (If you are processing huge amounts of tomatoes, you might plan processing over the course of several daily sessions.)\n\nWhen finished, run the pulp through the mill one or two more times to get even more of the juices. (Or if you have chickens, do as Italians do and feed the pulp to them). When finished, add 2-3 handfuls of sea salt to each large container of passata and stir well. Salt will aid in long preservation.\n\nLadle your finished passata into your canning jars, adding one large, fresh basil leaf into the bottom of each jar before filling. Fill each jar to within 3/4\" - 1\" from the top of the rim and screw on the lids tightly. (Every few jars, be sure to occasionally stir up the large container of passata to keep the solids from settling to the bottom.)\n\nAfter all of your jars are filled, it's time to pasteurize them. First, clean your large pot or cauldron that you will use to boil your bottles. Place clean cotton towels on the bottom and start layering in your jars, lying on their sides. Continue layering jars and towels until your cauldron is full. Fill the cauldron with fresh water.\n\nBring your pot/cauldron to a boil and then allow to boil gently for 45 minutes.\n\nNext, turn off the burner and wait until the water has cooled enough for you to remove jars while wearing a pair of kitchen gloves. (Be careful! Handle the jars gently and don't allow them to hit into each other. At this point, they are under pressure!)\n\nDry and place all of your jars in a cool, dry place, away from sun (perhaps a cellar) to cool down overnight (minimum 12 hours). Lay them out on a plastic tablecloth or poly painter's tarp in case any jars break open as cooling down. After 5-10 hours, each jar will start making a \"pinging\" sound as their lids pop downwards.\n\nTo make certain they are sealed properly, inspect each lid to make sure their dimples are depressed. Any jars with dimples popped upwards should be stored in the refrigerator and used within 2 weeks or frozen in plastic containers.\n\nUsing this Italian method of processing and canning passata should give you safe jars that can be kept as long as three years! Share them with family and friends!\n\nWhat About Canning Whole Tomatoes?\n\nIn Italy, whole canned tomatoes are called pelati, referring to the process of peeling the skins off before canning. In the area of Naples, many families invest in crates of locally grown San Marzano tomatoes, but any pear/plum shaped past tomato will do fine.\n\nBefore caning whole tomatoes, the best way to prevent spoilage is to remove the skins. Canning peeled tomatoes also affords more options for use in recipes that might call for crushed tomatoes. Skinned, whole tomatoes are easy to crush by squeeze by hand or pulsing in a food processor.\n\nAs in the passata process described above, clean your tomatoes and remove any that are blemished or over-ripe. You only want blemish free, ripe tomatoes for canning whole.\n\nAlso as when making passata, you should have your sterilized jars and new lids ready for filling.\n\nTo remove the skins, boil a large pot/cauldron of water, then plunge your tomato (working in managable batches) into the boiling water for 60-90 seconds.\n\nRemove the tomatoes, plunge briefly into cold water, then lay out on kitchen towels to cool a bit more for handling.\n\nTo remove the skins (or rather, to remove the tomato from ts skin), hold the tomato with the stem end toward you. With a pinch, break and tear open the skin a bit on the bottom of each tomato (opposite the stem end). Next, grip the plum tomato in your hand and with the thumb of your other hand, push the tomato out of its skin and into a waiting bowl.\n\nAs one person pops the tomatoes out of their skins, another can start filling the jars. First, place a good pinch of sea salt at the bottom of each jar.\n\nNext, place the skinned tomatoes in the jars leaving no air-spaces between them. Press them gently together and pack the jar within 1/2\" from the top. Sprinkle another pinch of sea salt on top of the tomatoes. if there are any air bubbles on the sides of the glass, give each jar a gentle tap or use a clean fork to release and bring them to the top.\n\nOnce you have finished and all of your pelati jars are filled, do the same as before with your large pot/caldron, laying in kitchen towels and jars until filled nearly to the top. Light your burner and bring to a gentle boil.\n\nOnce the water is boiling, let the jars boil for another 30 minutes, then turn off the burner and allow the water to cool down enough until you can start removing jars with using kitchen gloves. set all of your pelati jars to cool in a dry place as before, allowing them to cool until the lids have \"pinged\" to seal. (If you have several batches to boil, watch the third video below for a great tip on how to remove the hot water so you can remove jars and then re-use the hot water for the next batch to be boiled.)\n\nNOTE: You can also use a combination of the two techniques above to can whole cherry tomatoes. In this process, after cleaning the tomatoes and filling jars as above, ladle some passata to fill the voids in between all of the cherry tomatoes, again, leaving 3/4\" - 1\" from the top, then boil to sterilize the jars as with the pelati method above. .\n\nDon't forget to label your Passata and Pelati with the month and year. (Order oval Avery labels HERE on Amazon). Store them in a cool, dark place. They will last for as long as three years.\n\nRead this article carefully, watch the videos below and by all means, work safely! Make this a yearly event for your extended famiglia. I've read about families who take gather large teams together to process as much as 500 pounds of tomatoes! I would suggest starting small until you get used to the process. You can also make small volumes of passata or pelati right in your kitchen with a large stock pot, colander and tools you have lying around. And whether you use a manual tomato mill or powered, I'm sure you'll be successful and enjoy a fully packed cantina (pantry) all season long.\n\n--Jerry Finzi, GVI\n\nIf you are new to canning, you can study the principles of safe canning HERE.\n\nUseful Processing Tools on AMAZON...\n\nThe video below is one of the best I have found covering many aspects of making Passata and Pelati.

This was written 16 years before Marco Polo returned from China.\n\nThere is archaeological evidence suggesting the Etruscans made pasta as early as 400 B.C.\n\nThe Roman poet Horace wrote in 35 B.C., “I come back home to my pot of leek, peas and laganum”. Laganum was a flat dough, cooked first in water, then fried in oil, and in later years the frying was omitted.\n\nHistorians think laganum was the first sheet pasta and was used like lasagna is used today. Written in the 1st century A.D., the Roman cookbook Apicius, contains a recipe that describes layering laganum with meat and other ingredients like modern day lasagna.\n\nThe first Western mention of boiled noodles (called itriyah) is in the Jerusalem Talmud of the fifth century A.D., written in Aramaic, where the authors debate whether the boiled dough satisfied the laws about the use of unleavened bread.\n\nIn the 9th century, there are at least two written descriptions of itriyah (used as an Arab word) being used to describe the long, flat pasta called vermicelli (little worms).\n\nIn the 12th century, an Arab geographer, commissioned by the Norman king of Sicily, reported seeing pasta called itriyah being made.\n\nFrom itriyah is derived the current day Sicilian dialect word for spaghetti, tria.\n\nBy 1400, pasta was being produced commercially in Italy. The pasta dough was kneaded by foot, a process that could take all day long. The dough was then extruded through bronze dies under great pressure, via a large screw press powered by two men or one horse. This pasta was dried for long storage.\n\nIn the 14th century, Sardinian merchants used the expression obra de pasta to refer to the dry pastas that they exported abroad.\n\nPasta came first... tomatoes were introduced in Italy in the 16th century but were not paired with pasta until the 18th century.\n\nThomas Jefferson was credited for bringing the first macaroni machine to America in 1789 after falling in love with macaroni in Naples.\n\nThe industrial era began at the end of the 19th century with the development of hydraulic presses, when all pastas were made from hard wheat.\n\nThe spread of pasta around the world was due in part to the immigration of Italians at the end of the 19th century, who brought their recipes and techniques to the USA and Latin America.\n\nDrying spaghetti, Naples 1900.\n\nPasta press, 1950s, Naples\n\nModern pasta extruding\n\nInteresting Pasta Facts\n\nContrary to the Great Spaghetti Tree Harvest April Fool’s Day Hoax of 1957, pasta never has grown on trees.\n\nThe average person in Italy eats more than 51 pounds of pasta every year.\n\nThe average person in America eats only 15 pounds of pasta every year.\n\nTop-quality pasta in Italy is made from durum wheat flour, which curiously is grown in North Dakota and shipped to Italy.\n\nThe United States with a population of over 320 million people produces 1.9 million tons of pasta annually.\n\nItaly has about 60 million people and produces 2.75 million tons of pasta annually.\n\nEach year, over 13 million tons of pasta are produced worldwide.\n\nTo cook one billion pounds of pasta, you would need over two billion gallons of water--enough to fill 75,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.\n\nIn Italy, pasta is the first, or Primo course and stands on its own.\n\nIn Italy, meat is not served in pasta recipes, but is served as the Secundo (second) course.\n\nIn Italy, pasta may be served with certain fruits of the sea, such as mussels or octopus.\n\nSpaghetti and meatballs doesn’t exist in Italy, aside from in tourist restaurants.\n\nThe regional Abruzzo dish, Chitarra con Pallottini, is the closest thing to spaghetti and meatballs in Italy, pairing tiny meatballs with square sided spaghetti made on a wired pasta tool called a chitarra.\n\nSpaghetti Bolognese doesn’t exist in Italy. In the area of Bologna the dish is called Ragù con tagliatelle.\n\nPasta isn't always cream colored: spinach makes it green, red pasta uses tomato, dark gray or black pasta uses squid ink, orange pasta contains carrots or pumpkin, green pasta can contain spinach or basil.\n\nThere are approximately 1500 different pasta shapes in Italy, with perhaps 5 times the number of names for each pasta shape, depending on region.\n\nThe most popular shapes of pasta in the U.S. are spaghetti, penne and rotini.\n\nHistorically in France, pasta were called nouilles, macaroni and lasagnas. In Provence, they were called menudez, macarons, vermisseaux or fidiaux.\n\nThere are two types of pasta: Fresh and dried. The fresh type is typically made with eggs, but can also be made with just water or olive oil and is used immediately or can be frozen for later use.\n\nDry pasta is made using water, and since it contains no eggs can be stored for very long periods of time--often years. Historically, before refrigeration, dry pasta was considered a long storage food.\n\nA little known fact is that even pasta made with eggs, if dried completely, and kept in low humidity environment, can be stored for long periods of time.\n\n100% whole wheat pasta contains more fiber which causes it to be digested slower than regular pasta, causing a measurably higher calorie intake.\n\nIn the 1300s, Pope Benedict XII set strict quality standards for pasta.\n\nThe word pasta means \"paste\" in Italian, referring to the paste of water and flour created when making pasta.\n\nThe longest single strand of pasta measured 12,388’ 5” and was achieved by Lawson Inc. in Tokyo , Japan, on 20 October 2010.\n\nThe world’s record for the most pasta consumed was broken by Matt Stonie, of hot-dog eating fame. He consumed 10 pounds in 8 minutes.\n\nThe first American pasta factory was opened in Brooklyn, New York, in 1848, by Antoine Zerega. He used a horse to power his machinery and dried the pasta on the roof.\n\nOne cup of cooked spaghetti contains 200 calories, 40 grams of carbs, and less than one gram of total fat.\n\nThere is no cholesterol in pasta made with water.\n\nLinguini means \"little tongue\" and Vermicelli means \"little worms\". Many pasta names have meanings to describe their shape.\n\nCouscous is a type of pasta.\n\nCooking and Making Pasta\n\nTo cook 1 pound of pasta, you should boil at least 1 gallon of water. Most Americans don't use enough water when cooking pasta.\n\nWhen cooking pasta in water, use the largest pot you have or your pasta might become a slimy, starchy mess.\n\nYou need to add sea salt to pasta water when cooking—enough to give the water the taste of the sea. A good handful will add lots of flavor to your pasta.\n\nAdding salt also makes water boil faster.\n\nPasta should be added only after the water has come to a rapid boil.\n\nPasta can actually be “cooked” by soaking in warm water: Salt the water and stir. Add pasta let sit for 30 minutes, until the pasta rehydrates. This method is best to hydrate small pasta shapes intended to be added to soups.\n\nYou can use regular lasagna noodles in the same way as “no boil” noodles. Just be sure there is enough moisture covering the pasta when assembling your lasagna casserole.\n\nNever add oil to pasta water, no matter what your mother told you. The oil would prevent sauces from sticking to pasta.\n\nTo prevent any pasta from sticking together, after adding the pasta to the boiling water, give the pasta and water a couple of swirls with a wooden spoon.\n\nTo cook spaghetti, do not break in half, but add to the large pot of boiling water in a fan like motion. Within seconds, use a wooden spoon or tongs to gently push the spaghetti strands down into the water. Give a couple of stirs to the water.\n\nIf you have average sized hands and grip spaghetti between your thumb and forefinger (making a circle about 1-1/4” across), that should give you enough for two servings.\n\nCover your pasta pot with a lid left 1-2” open along one side to prevent it boiling over.\n\nTo prevent spill-overs, place a large wooden spoon across one side of the pot, then rest the lid on top.\n\nPasta should be cooked al dente (to the tooth). You can test a piece of pasta by biting into it. If you still see a little white center and there still a resistance in the pasta when bitten, it is done.\n\nUndercook pasta slightly when making a recipe that requires adding pasta to a sauté pan to finish cooking in the sauce. The liquids of the sauce will finish cooking the pasta and add flavor to it.\n\nStore bought, dried pasta cooks in 8-12 minutes. Wheat or spinach pasta takes longer. Fresh pasta cooks quickly within 3-4 minutes.\n\nWhen finishing your pasta along with a sauce in a sauté pan, add 2-3 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water to the pan. The starchy water will help the sauce thicken.\n\nYou can drain pasta with a spider or scolapasta (colander), but don’t rinse it. Rinsing would remove starch which helps sauces stick to your pasta.\n\nSauces should be tossed with the pasta (allowing the sauce to be soaked up by the pasta) instead of serving naked pasta with sauce sitting on top.\n\nAnyone can make fresh pasta without a machine: Place the flour on a work surface in a volcano shaped mound. You can then make a basin in the middle of the volcano to contain eggs or water. You then use hands or a fork to mix the flour into the wet ingredients until a rough dough is formed. Knead the dough until smooth for 5-10 minutes, then roll or shape your pasta.\n\nFresh pasta can be made with a variety, or even a mix of flours: durum semolina, finely-milled 00 flour, all-purpose flour, buckwheat flour, wheat flour, etc. Never use bread flour to make pasta as it contains too much protein and creates too much gluten.\n\nFresh pasta can be laid out on sheet pans lined with cotton kitchen towels, lightly dusted with flour or corn meal, then dried for later use.\n\nFresh pasta, after dried, can be frozen, spread apart on sheet pans, then when rock hard, bagged for future use.\n\nThe secret to making ravioli that don’t explode when boiled is making sure that there are no air pockets in with the filling when you seal them.\n\nFrozen, “fresh” pasta can be stored in a freezer for 3 months.\n\nMaking fresh pasta is easy to do, even by hand. You can learn to make many traditional shapes with nothing more than your hands, fingers, a rolling pin, a bench scraper and a long knife.\n\nIf a pasta dough is well worked, smooth then rested, it should not give any problems or stick when run through a pasta machine.\n\nFresh pasta dough should be covered and rested for one hour before running through a pasta machine.\n\nA batch of pasta dough can be divided into 4 equal pieces, then roughly shaped and rolled into ¼” thick rectangles, ready for rolling through a pasta machine.\n\nPasta machines typically have numbered settings, from thickest to thinnest. You start rolling, twice on each number, from thickest to the thinnest setting that matches the type of pasta you are making. Not all pasta types should be paper thin, as a slightly thicker pasta holds heavier sauces better.\n\nWhen using a pasta machine (the roller type), never clean it with water. Just lightly brush off any residue. If your pasta dough is made correctly, it will not be sticky or floury. If it feels sticky, then your pasta dough needs a little more flour, not your pasta machine.\n\nYou don’t need a machine or roller to make pasta. You can use a rolling pin to flatten your pasta and then cut your shapes with a pasta cutting roller or a knife. You can cut strips of fettuccine, squares for making ravioli or tortellini, or snakes cut into 2” long pieces for making dumpling shapes, like cavatelli.\n\nBefore cooking fresh pasta, you should dry it for at least 30 minutes.\n\nDust freshly made pasta with a bit of flour, then lay out in one layer on sheet pans to dry.\n\nFor long pasta, like fettuccini or spaghetti, flour the pasta and drop into loose “nests” on a sheet pan to dry.\n\nFresh pasta can be totally dried in 24 hours for longer storage.\n\nFresh pasta, after an initial drying, can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\n\nAfter totally drying fresh pasta on sheet pans, they can be placed into a freezer until rock hard, then stored in plastic bags for use within 2-3 months.\n\nDon't place sauces on top of naked pasta, instead, either finish the pasta in the saucepan or mix the sauce with the pasta in a large pasta bowl.\n\nWhich pasta to use for a recipe depends on the type of sauce:\n\nTubular shapes like penne and ziti are perfect with hearty, thick sauces like ragu.\n\nPasta with ridges, called rigate, grip sauce even better.\n\nWide, flat pastas like pappardelle are ideal for holding creamy sauces.\n\nLong, round pastas like spaghetti are best with oil or tomato sauces, which coat each strand evenly.\n\nChunky vegetable or meaty sauces are best paired with larger shapes that have cups or large cavities to grip the large particles.\n\n--Jerry Finzi\n\nUseful Pasta Tools on Amazon\n\nI'm not a gullible man. Even as a boy, I wasn't one to believe everything I was told. I always asked questions... \"Why? Where? When? How?\" I read lots of books, including my entire encyclopedia set and my Atlas. I loved science and the arts. I used both sides of my brain. But as a 12-year-old watching the old Jack Parr show in 1963, I tended to to go by the old adage, \"Seeing is believing\"--especially if you see it on TV!\n\nBig mistake!\n\nWhat I saw was a very legitimate sounding short documentary film with a very scholarly, British voice talking about the spaghetti harvest in Switzerland, and mentioning the \"tremendous scale of the Italian's... (harvest)\" and the \"vast spaghetti plantations in the Po valley\". From that point on, until I was in my early twenties, I actually believed there was some sort of special tree or bush in Italy that produced some sort of spaghetti... fruit, pod or otherwise. It wasn't until I saw Jack Parr himself talking about the hoax on the Tonight Show in the early 1970s that I learned the embarrassing truth--a \"truth\" that I would argue about with my non-Italian friends growing up... \"Real Italian spaghetti grows on trees!\", I would insist.\n\nParr claimed they didn't get a single call about the segment and most people bought it hook, line and sinker. OK, so maybe I was a bit gullible. But it was a very convincing documentary film, produced originally as a serious film for, of all things, a British news show... and besides, I was only 12!\n\nOn April 1, 1957, on April Fool's Day (Pesce d'Aprile in Italian), the BBC television show Panorama aired the short \"documentary\" about the \"spaghetti harvest\" in Ticino, Switzerland, on the border of the Italian Alps. The film shows spaghetti trees ripe with long strands of spaghetti and a farming family harvesting by hand, putting the spaghetti into baskets and then carefully laying them out to dry in the \"warm Alpine sun.\"\n\nSome viewers bought it entirely and called BBC to find out where they could buy some of the \"real spaghetti\". Many British gardeners wanted to know how to buy a spaghetti bush for their own garden. Others were very angry that a joke was portrayed as a serious subject on a real news program.\n\nStill others--like me--just tucked this into their knowledge banks, unquestioningly and carried it as a \"truth\" through at least part of their lives, being even more convinced every time they heard the expression \"fresh pasta\"... of course, that must be referring to the real stuff fresh picked from the trees! What did I know. After all, neither my Mother or Grandmother made fresh spaghetti, because spaghetti trees probably didn't grow in our climate. All I ever saw growing up was dried, boxed spaghetti--you know, the fake stuff.\n\nThe following video is the original broadcast in 1957 in England...\n\nThe following video gives a behind the scenes take on\n\nthe Spaghetti Hoax story from a member of the Panorama\n\nproduction team who came up with the idea...\n\nThe next video shows a further chapter of this hoax broadcast\n\nin 1967 in Britain explaining how the spaghetti crop was being ruined by a terrible pest--the spag-worm, or \"troglodyte pasta\".\n\n(\"Troglodyte\" refers to a person so stupid because he lives in a cave).\n\nIn 1978, San Giorgio Pasta produced a remake of the\n\nSpaghetti Hoax for one of their TV ads.\n\nFinally, cooking know-it-all, Martha Stewart (I'm not a fan) got into the act\n\nin 2009 with her own little spoof about her Spaghetti Bush,\n\n\"spago officinalis\" (\"official string\") trees.\n\nWell, I've had a lot more culinary education since being misled by that little April Fool's prank when I was young and impressionable: my Mom and Dad taught with every loving dish they put in front of me; Grandma taught me her authenticity; having home and studio in Manhattan for so many years where varied cuisines are around every corner also taught me; In my 30s, I finally learned how to cook from Julia Child, Craig Clairborne, Marcella Hazan, Mary Ann Esposito and Pierre Franey. I now make fresh pasta with my son, Lucas from time to time. And during our Voyage throughout Italy, I never saw a single strand of spaghetti on a bush, tree or vine. Ever. (OK, so I did look, just to be sure.)\n\nHowever, I have since learned that there are actually spaghetti alternatives that grow from Madre Terra. I even grew 2 foot long \"snake\" beans a few years ago that came pretty close. Here are a few veggie spaghetti alternatives...\n\nSpaghetti Squash\n\nYellow squash, zucchini, sweet pepper \"spaghetti\"\n\nSpaghetti String Beans as pasta\n\nLong string bean \"spaghetti\"\n\nCucumber \"spaghetti\"\n\nVegetable \"Spaghetti\" can be made by a julienne of carrots, leek, zucchini and yellow squash\n\nSpaghetti Squash seeds on Amazon\n\nPremium V Slicer spiralizer on Amazon\n\nKitchenaid's Spiralizer Attachment on Amazon\n\nIf you want to make your own, fresh \"veggie spaghetti\" at home, pick up a Premium Vegetable Spiralizer from Amazon or the attachment we use for our stand mixer, the Kitchenaid Spiralizer Attachment. It's a lot easier than picking the spaghetti from the trees, collecting in baskets and spreading them out in the sun to dry...\n\n(Damn you, Jack Parr and your dry sense of humor!)\n\n--Jerry Finzi\n\nMost Italian-Americans have heard of basket cheese, that light, soft, fresh cheese (similar to ricotta) sold in Italian specialty stores every Easter which is used to make the traditional pizzagaina or pastiera di grano (wheat grain pie) recipes. In the U.S. it is rarely seen year-round and is mostly used as an ingredient. In Italy, basket cheese is is called formaggio fresca (fresh cheese) and is readily available all year long for use as both recipe ingredient and as a table cheese, just as ricotta is eaten, but with a less salty and milder flavor.\n\nBasket Cheese Ingredients\n\n1 gallon whole milk (or, if you can find some, use goat's milk)\n\n1/4 teaspoon rennet\n\n1/4 teaspoon salt (basket cheese is less salty than ricotta)\n\nYou will need:\n\nCake Decorator's spatula\n\nRennet\n\nLarge Whisk\n\nCheese basket\n\nDirections\n\nPour the milk into a large pot on medium heat, stir constantly to bring it 95 F, then turn off the heat.\n\nAdd the rennet and mix well, turning only in one direction for 30 seconds, then use a large spatula as a brake, placing it vertically into one side of the milk to stop its movement.\n\nLet stand for 30 minutes without any movement. The milk will start to solidify due to the curdling effect of the rennet.\n\nWith a long chef's knife or large metal cake decorating spatula (long enough to reach the bottom of the pot), gently cut the curd in a vertical grid pattern 2\" apart. Then slice at a low angle to cut the vertical columns of curd into rough cubes.\n\nAllow to rest for 30 minutes, then using a large whisk, gently break the curd, into small bean-sized pieces. Let rest for 1 hour.\n\nAfter resting, the cheese curds will have separated from the whey. Separate the cheese from the whey, press it lightly with your hands so that the bulk of the liquid comes out and put the cheese in a plastic cheese basket (in Italian, fuscelle). If you would like to make ricotta after this recipe, save the whey in the pot!\n\nPlace the basket onto a shallow plate, then cover the basket with a weight (small pot, soup can, etc.) allowing to dry for 24 hours in the refrigerator.\n\nYou can now use your basket cheese fresh as an ingredient in recipes, such as the traditional Easter pizzagaina. If you want to eat it fresh (the same day is best) you can turn the baskets upside down onto a serving plate and remove the basket. This is a mild cheese, but if you like you can sprinkle with a little sea salt or fresh ground pepper. You can also spread it on bread or crostata and drizzle with honey or balsamic and serve with with figs or fresh berries. Although it should be eaten the day it's made, you can keep it for several days by keeping the basket in a plastic container along with with an inch of milk.\n\nMaking Ricotta from the Leftover, Fresh Whey\n\nAlthough my wife Lisa's ricotta recipe is great, technically, it's not a true ricotta made from whey. Making true ricotta (re-cooked, or cooked twice) is incredibly simple once you have whey leftover from cheese-making using rennet. The whey has to be fresh from the cheese-making process above.\n\nBring your pot of whey nearly to a boil (it needs to be around 195F). The ricotta will begin to surface.\n\nUsing a slotted spoon, collect the ricotta and place it into a cheese basket (or a cheesecloth). Don't press it if you want it to be fluffy and light. Drain over a grid for 3 hours, then refrigerate. If you want it a bit firmer and drier, refrigerate overnight with a weight on top.\n\nMaking Ricotta Salata\n\nRicotta salata is basically a firm, saltier version of ricotta cheese that is very similar to feta. While feta is made with rennet, ricotta salata is made from the whey leftover from cheese-making, just as normal ricotta is made. Ricotta salata needs more salt than normal ricotta and is pressed it to release any extra moisture. You need a fine mesh cheesecloth or butter muslin.\n\nMake the ricotta as above from your whey, but add 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt to the whey before heating.\n\nOnce you gather your ricotta, lightly salt again with another 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt.\n\nLine your cheese basket with the cheese cloth/muslin, add your ricotta into the mold, then fold over the top neatly.\n\nPlace a heavy, flat weight on top of the ricotta to press out the moisture. A soup can will work well. Make sure the bottom is elevated to drain.\n\nPress overnight in the refrigerator, halfway through, flipping it over.\n\nThe next day, remove from the refrigerator and place on a counter to continue draining/drying in a cool, dry place, then press this time with a heavier weight for at least 5-8 hours, flipping it over every couple of hours. You want to dry out the ricotta until it is firm.\n\nLightly salt all sides of the cheese, then place the cheese round onto an upturned cheese basket (the bottom needs to breathe). Place your cheese and upturned basket into a larger storage container and refrigerate. If any more whey collects at the bottom, drain and dry each day.\n\nFor the next 5 days, continue lightly salting on all sides and flipping every other day.\n\nWhen very firm, pat your finished ricotta salata dry and wrap in parchment paper or cheese paper and store in your refrigerator.\n\nRicotta salata is beautifully paired with sliced apples, pears, fresh figs or crumbled on pizza, pasta or salads.\n\nBuon apetitto!\n\n--Jerry Finzi\n\nContinued from Part 2...\n\nFinzi: The first time our family visited Molfetta (where my father was born) we didn’t have time to meet the relatives that still live there (although we've gotten to know each other since on Facebook). What advice would you give to someone with a desire to approach long-lost relatives in Italy, especially if there is a desire to collect the heritage of recipes from their famiglia?\n\nMary Ann: Call or email them; send photos; plan a meeting with them; bring old family photos if you have them.\n\nFinzi: When you first met your Italian relatives, what impressed you most?\n\nMary Ann: Their genuine hospitality and love of connection with you. My cousins were especially welcoming.\n\nFinzi: I lived in France for a while and tried my best to be a decent French cook, but after experiencing the simplicity of regional Italian cooking on our voyage throughout Italy, I immediately was drawn back my Italian roots. It’s amazing to think that in centuries past, the food eaten by the Italian upper classes was in the French style. Why do you think the Cucina Povera rose to the top of Italian cuisine, with its fairly simple ingredients and basic techniques?\n\nMary Ann: Because that is the true Italian cooking. It was only the upper class Italians who employed chefs called monzu. These were Italians trained in France and what they cooked was truly French and not Italian.\n\nFinzi: When my parents got married, according to my mother, she “wanted an American household”, so she didn’t teach her five children Italian. I’ve read that you took lessons on how to speak Italian. Did your mother have this same attitude to “Americanize” your family in this or any other ways?\n\nMary Ann: No, my mother spoke Neapolitan dialect because my Nonna Galasso--her mother--lived with us. My mother would never serve an American style TV dinner and neither would I.\n\nFinzi: I’ve never heard you talk about having a second home in Italy. If you do, can you tell us a little about it? And if not, of all the beautiful regions and towns in Italy, where would you love to live, and can you describe your Casa dei Sogni, or Dream Home for us?\n\nMary Ann: I go to Italy every year but do not have a home there; if I did, it would be in Siracusa because I love this baroque town; my second choice would be Torino.\n\nMary Ann Esposito Foundation culinary students\n\nFinzi: Your culinary life was influenced by two Nonne, but not everyone has an Italian grandmother to help educate them on how to prepare Italian dishes. In a way, you have become that Nonna for the millions of us who have watched you cook for nearly 30 years. Can you tell us something about your Mary Ann Esposito Foundation and your desire to pass along your passion and techniques to future Italian chefs?\n\nMary Ann: Thanks for asking! The foundation provides scholarships for students in culinary degree programs in universities offering the study of Italian regional foods and is also establishing a legacy library online to record for posterity, regional recipes that otherwise would be lost to time for future generations. All donations in any amount are most appreciated. Your Grand Voyage Italy readers can go to www.ciaoitalia.com and click on “foundation” to learn more and to make a donation.\n\nFinzi: I want to really thank you for taking the time for this wonderful chat, Mary Ann. We'll be looking forward to seeing your new episodes on PBS... my TIVO is fired up to record every episode!\n\nOne last thought... For us to envision il pranzo perfetto per Maestra Esposito, what are your all-time favorite dinner courses in La Cucina Esposito?\n\nMary Ann:\n\nAperitivo: Prosecco\n\nAntipasto: Grilled Vegetables, crostini\n\nPrimo: Cacio e Pepe\n\nSecondo: Branzino al Limone\n\nContorno: Broccoli Rape\n\nInsalata: Fennel and Orange\n\nFormaggi e frutta: Parmigiano Reggiano, Figs, Melon\n\nDolce: Gelato\n\nDigestivo con caffè, Non lo bevo\n\nGuy Esposito on Gardening\n\nFinzi: When I was a boy, my Dad taught me all about saving seeds and the benefits of Home Grown Tomatoes, and now my 15 year old son grows them with me. Our favorites are Eva Purple Ball, Jersey Devil and Giant Belgium. Which are your top three favorite heirloom tomato varieties, and why you like each.\n\nGuy: Costoluto Genovese for fresh eating and preserving, intensely flavorful, deep red flesh); San Marzano are the only ones that match to those in Campania for sauce; Redorta for eating fresh, making sauces, canning or drying. It's better than San Marzano for growing in colder climates.\n\nFinzi: For some reason, I’ve always had less than good results with Costoluto in our garden and Redorta is one we haven’t grown. I’ll try some next season.\n\nI’m in Zone 6a in Bucks County, Pennsylvania (April 15, last frost) and still I wish the growing season was a bit longer than it is. What are the problems growing vegetables in your short, Zone 5b growing season in New Hampshire?\n\nGuy: We get a late start after May 31 because of such a short growing season.\n\nFinzi: What do you consider the essential vegetables for an Italian gardener to grow, and for beginners, which do you think are the easiest?\n\nGuy: Lettuce, zucchini and radishes are easiest and the hardest are melons and artichokes.\n\nFinzi: Were you always a gardener or did your garden develop as Ciao Italia became a more prominent part of your lives as a couple, and what compels you to grow your own vegetables?\n\nGuy: I have been gardening since Medical School. We are believers in farm to table food without pesticides. For good health we maintain a Mediterranean diet.\n\nFinzi: We are also pretty much organic in our garden, but can always do better with a heathier diet. At least we make pretty much everything from scratch. I just wish we had a good fish monger near us.\n\nMy wife Lisa would love to grow huge bushes of rosemary like we saw in Italy. For me, pomegranates and olives. But of course, we can’t in our Pennsylvania climate. What don’t (or can’t) you grow in the garden that you wish you could, or would like to grow, and why?\n\nGuy: Radicchio di Treviso and Bulbing Fennel (finocchi). Both are delicious for salads or cooking.\n\nRadicchio di Treviso\n\nBulbing fennel\n\nFinzi: I’ve watched videos on how complicated it is to grow Radicchio di Treviso. Definitely not for the home gardener!\n\nWhat single vegetable or other crop has May Ann wanted you to grow that you haven’t yet, and why haven’t you grown it?\n\nPiennolo del Vesuvio tomatoes can be stored all winter in Italy\n\nGuy: Piennolo del Vesuvio tomatoes. It's just not hot enough here in New England and we have the wrong type of soil. .\n\nFinzi: I love the idea of growing these but even if I could, I doubt if they would last through the winter, hanging in large bunches, the way they do in Campania.\n\nIf you could only grow one, solitary crop, which would you grow?\n\nGuy: Lettuce! Virtually every day we eat large salads every day.\n\nFinzi: That’s one crop I wish was possible to grow all season long. I’ve grown a variety of types, but some years, the rabbits and chipmunks get the best of them.\n\nWhat are the most difficult things to grow in your garden?\n\nGuy: Melons and sometimes tomatoes. Melons need a lot of heat and a long growing season. Some types of tomatoes we love can be prone to disease.\n\nFinzi: I’ve also had some experience with melons, but they require a lot of attention and even watering--difficult to keep up with in drier seasons.\n\nIs it difficult to be the husband of such a famous chef, or do you consider yourself a partner in Mary Ann’s efforts—and how involved are you in the production of the show?\n\nGuy: Mary Ann is first and foremost my wife. I am involved with Ciao Italia as the head gardener and wine consultant. The Mary Ann you see on TV is the exact same person in real life. I am a lucky man!\n\nFinzi: You certainly are.\n\nMary Ann and Guy, I want to thank you both for being so generous with your time. I’m certain our readers are going to gain a lot of wisdom from the depth and span of your knowledge, experience and passion about Italian cuisine.\n\nAlla prossima e mille grazie!\n\n--Jerry Finzi\n\nCopyright, 2020 - Jerry Finzi/GrandVoyageItaly.com - All Rights Reserved\n\nNot to be reproduced in any form without expressed, written permission.\n\nMary Ann (3rd from top left) and her family\n\nIn a Carnevale mood\n\nFlirting with tomatoes in Campania\n\nJust two gals hanging out\n\nA vineyard stroll\n\nWith her Premio Artusi award"
