        "text": "Dipping a piece of baguette in it imparts a delightful taste to the bread. I am, of course, referring to olive oil.\n\nI discovered I like to dip crusty bread in the stuff at a fine restaurant a few years ago and now I prefer it to butter — except on cinnamon rolls.\n\nI’ve been curious about the various grades of the product so I decided to do a little research.\n\nFirst, let’s dispel that myth regarding “Extra Virgin” and “Virgin Olive Oil.” The name has nothing to do with the individual doing the processing.\n\nThe olives used for pressing into olive oil are much smaller than those used for pickling (people or martinis). One hundred pounds of these olives are required to produce about 15 pounds of olive oil.\n\nThe first pressing of the little rascals yields what is known as “virgin oil.” However, the first pressing of the highest quality hand-picked olives yields that “Extra Virgin Oil” (an interesting choice of words).\n\nThese olives were washed, blended, mashed and squeezed in a hydraulic press at room temperature.\n\nThis liquid is then put through a centrifuge to draw out the water.\n\nThe oil must pass tests for flavor, color and aroma and must contain less than 1 percent of oleic acid, which affects its flavor.\n\nThis oil is typically green and redolent of olives. Most of the extra virgin olive oils are imported from Italy or France.\n\n“Fine virgin oil” comes from the second pressing of the same olives. It’s good but doesn’t make the cut to be extra virgin.\n\n“Pure oil” is extracted from whatever is left in the press after the second pressing. This stuff is basically colorless and flavorless and usually has a little extra virgin thrown in to give it an olive flavor.\n\n“Light oil” is similar to pure oil without the addition of the extra virgin oil. It’s produced especially for the U.S. market.\n\nChoose your olive oil carefully and store it in a cool, dark place. The good stuff, properly stored, will last about two years.\n\nGood olive oil is more expensive than other vegetable oils so use the good stuff in salad dressings and use the cheaper stuff for cooking purposes.\n\nOh, by the way, good bread is best for the dipping.\n\n• There’s something really wrong here. There are more bagpipe bands in the United States than there are in Scotland.\n\n• Mom always said fish was “brain food.” She was right, up to a point (mom’s usually are). Our brains require decosahexaenoic acid to develop and this is found in oily fish. Mom may not have given me enough early on.\n\n• Here’s another fact you can check at work or social gatherings without much consequence. On the average, we Americans stand about 14 inches apart when we talk with each other.\n\n• Henny Youngman made a very good point, “You know what I did before I got married? Anything I wanted to.”\n\n• With today’s made-up names and numbers his record is probably safe. Ransom Eli Olds is the only American to have two different car models named after him. Naturally, the Oldsmobile but also the REO that was manufactured from 1904 to 1936 and drew its name from his initials.\n\n• “I can’t remember the name of the dwarf with the bad temper,” said Tom grumpily."
