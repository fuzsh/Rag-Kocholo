Inclusion in the Philadelphia Monthly Arts Round-Up does not signify cinéSPEAK’s endorsement of an event or organization’s mission or political affiliations.\n\nMarch 2024 should be an exciting month for film in Philadelphia and around the world. If you’re a fan of the Oscars, make sure to check out Bryn Mawr Film Institute’s “Let’s Talk Oscars!” panel event and Lightbox Film Center’s screening of Pictures of Ghosts, Brazil’s entry for this year’s Academy Awards. March is also Women’s History Month, making it the perfect time to check out Diamond Screen: Women’s Film Festival, a Temple University student film festival.\n\nAt cinéSPEAK, we love community collaborations–we’re excited to see so many cool events in March featuring artists and organizations that we’ve worked with or spotlighted in our Philadelphia Artist Spotlight and Philadelphia Organization Spotlight columns. Be Reel Black Cinema Club and The Micheaux Mission are partnering up to present a special screening of Pariah, and SIFTMedia 215 is screening our previously spotlighted artist Bettina Escauriza’s short film Tonight, We Eat Flowers, created in conjunction with the BlackStar Philadelphia Filmmaker Lab. While Valentine’s Day has passed, we’re still feeling the Philly independent film community love!\n\nRead on for a fuller list of film events happening throughout the month.\n\nFriday, March 1, 2024 at 7 PM\n\nBushman\n\nThis special double feature includes two films by director David Schickele, Bushman and Give me a Riddle. To film Bushman–a 1971 black and white film–David Schickele enlisted his friend Paul Eyam Nzie Okpokam to star in a light-hearted comedy about the adventures of a well-educated Nigerian immigrant in San Francisco. Partway through, the film morphs into a documentary when the director’s voice abruptly intrudes to narrate its star’s enraging fate: Okpokam was accused of a crime he did not commit and was thrown in prison before being expelled from the country.\n\nCost: $10 General Admission, $8 Students/Seniors, Free for Members/UArts Students/UArts Faculty and Staff\n\nLightbox Film Center — 401 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19147\n\nRSVP\n\nSaturday, March 2, 2024 at 6 PM\n\nThe United States of Hoodoo with Danny Simmons\n\nThe United States of Hoodoo is a 2012 documentary that tracks the spiritual roots that have shaped the American Black experience, offering perspective on the interconnectedness of culture and identity.

Foragers, a 2022 documentary, spotlights the Palestinian tradition of foraging wild za’atar and ‘akoub amidst prohibitive law.

This film is an intimate reflection on the societal influences that shape perception and self-worth. Guided by the central mantra “the body is not an apology,” found in Sonya Renee Taylor’s book The Body is Not an Apology, The Power of Radical Self-Love, the film unfolds as a multifaceted exploration, weaving together elements of satire, realism, drag, and dance.

The film follows Luis, a recent immigrant who sells “hold music,” and Jamilah, a gourmet chef stuck working in a cubicle, as they fall in love under unlikely circumstances that involve absolutely terrible music, a lot of blood, and edible flowers. Escauriza developed this film as part of the BlackStar Philadelphia Filmmaker Lab.\n\nCost: Free with Donations Suggested\n\nBok Building — 1901 South 9th Street, Room 415, Philadelphia, PA 19148\n\nRSVP\n\nSaturday, March 23, 2024 at 7 PM\n\nPictures of Ghosts\n\nCheck out this unique opportunity to watch Brazil’s official selection for the 2024 Academy Awards, Pictures of Ghosts, from acclaimed director Kleber Mendonca Filho (Bacarau, Aquarius, and Neighboring Sounds).

Combining archive documentary, mystery, film clips, and personal memories, Pictures of Ghosts is a map of a city through the lens of cinema.
