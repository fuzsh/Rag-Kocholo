It will also screen films on the COVID-19 pandemic that examine the psychological and physical impact on the world. April Ranck, Executive Director of the AIFF states, “Films screened at the festival reflect a respect for humanity regardless of color, gender or religion and are brought to light through various genres of film.”\n\nFinally, this year has been an exciting one for our viewers, judges, volunteers, partners, and sponsors.

Lebanon’s Darkest Hour\n\nCongratulations to filmmaker Daizy Gedeon\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nArlington Int’l Film Festival 2021 Program Highlights\n\nSome of the most exciting aspects of a film festival is the experience of watching a film in the theater with others and having the filmmaker present for a Q&A. And let’s not omit the engaging conversations elicited by films that often take on a life outside of the theater. Last year we missed this lively experience to gather with you as well as all the good times that happen around the festival.\n\nIn early 2021, many festivals were either canceled, postponed, or screening virtually and as the year progressed, we had to make a difficult decision about AIFF. “We can’t be sure what 2021 will bring and even if it is safer to congregate in November, will it be safe enough to risk inviting our audience members into the theater? With that question unanswered, we will remain a virtual festival again this year,” said April Ranck, the Executive Director. “We are asking you to enjoy AIFF ONLINE November 4 -14 and we look forward to welcoming you back in the theater in 2022”.\n\nOur program is currently being uploaded to the website, AIFFest.org where you can watch trailers, read the synopsis, and plan what you must see! Also be sure to watch the 6 min short on our homepage, NUOVO CINEMA PARA-VIRUS by Italian filmmaker Daniele Pignatelli that is so fitting for the times… During the lockdown, the Cinema sends a video letter to humankind: the theatres are closed, sets are locked, and the Cinema can no longer create new dreams.\n\nWe are excited to announce the line-up of films in the 11th edition of the AIFF screening in November. Many films have premiered at the Berlin, Cannes, Toronto, Venice, Tribeca, Sundance, and Telluride film festivals and we have several that will be premiering with AIFF.\n\nAIFF 2021 BEST OF FESTIVAL winner is I’M AN ELECTRIC LAMPSHADE by writer and director John Clayton Doyle. John is a multidisciplinary artist known for his experimental use of movement, unconventional casting, and meta storytelling. John is the co-founder and Artistic Director of Harlem Dance Club, an arts organization that builds community by breaking down perceived boundaries and barriers using music, dance, and visual arts. John’s movement work has been presented at The Brooklyn Museum, MassMoca, Alvin Ailey Citibank Theater, Joe’s Pub at The Public Theater, Clemente Soto Velez, Parque Lage (Brazil), and informally at many nightclubs around the world.\n\nI’m Electric Lampshade is a docu-fiction based on the true story of Doug McCorkle. John and his crew follow Doug as he retires from a successful career in corporate accounting and incredibly goes on to become one of the most daring and unlikely performers of the 21st Century.\n\nThe creation of this film was highly unique, with Doug serving as patron and muse. John viewed his role as a painter hired to capture the portrait of a man at a particular moment in his life. When asked about his intentions, Doug said, “People live their lives like they’re going to get to go around again. That’s so sad. That’s why I'm doing this.”\n\nDoug’s journey and final transformation leave us with proof that it is never too late to pursue your dreams! Spanning four years and three countries, the making of I'm An Electric Lampshade is a story, that boldly demands a genre of its own!\n\nNo less anticipated, is the 2021 BEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE, THE BROTHERS/LOS HERMANOS directed by Ken Schneider and Marcia Jarmel of Patchworks Films.\n\nThe movie follows two musician siblings from Havana whose personal closeness is at odds with the geopolitics that keep them apart. Ilmar Gavilán, a violinist, left Cuba at 14 to study in Moscow and later immigrated to the United States. López Gavilán, his younger brother, a pianist, and composer, mostly stayed in Cuba, apart from conservatory training in London.\n\nKen Schneider’s story with Cuba goes back to when his dad was given shelter as a refugee child from Nazi Germany, two years before the U.S. opened its doors to him. Diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US have vacillated over the years. It remains difficult for Cubans and Americans to cross borders. Americans still know little of their closest neighbors, seeing Cuba as either an island paradise or socialist prison. We rarely hear the perspectives of Cubans themselves. The Cubans we know are deeply proud of their values, their artistic achievements, their way of life. They want change—and self-determination. They have generously shared their stories with us. We are committed to bringing them to you.\n\nJACK LONDON’S MARTIN EDEN by director Jay Craven was awarded the 2021 BEST NARRATIVE FEATURE. Based on the celebrated writer’s autobiographical novel, the film is set in 1909 and tells the story of a poor unschooled sailor who unexpectedly meets Ruth Morse, a magnetic young woman of means and education. Their unconventional attraction upends both lives and propels timely themes of impossible love, the pursuit of the “American Dream” and the quest for a comfortable place in an inconstant world.\n\nJack London was America’s most popular writer at the turn of the 20th C. Director Jay Craven, a seasoned narrative film director said of the making of this film, “I chose to make MARTIN EDEN because Jack London has always interested me, for his vivid writing, social engagement, complex humanism and the textured emotions of his characters. I was also drawn to London’s own volatile life and his legendary status as America’s first ‘celebrity writer’ whose work inspired Ernest Hemingway, Upton Sinclair, John Steinbeck, Jack Kerouac, Sinclair Lewis, Norman Mailer, and Susan Sontag, among others.”\n\nMARTIN EDEN’s cast includes Andrew Richardson in the title role and Hayley Griffith and Annet Mahendru as Ruth Morse and Lizzie Connolly, respectively. Richardson trained at Carnegie Mellon and London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and Royal Academy of Dance. His credits include eight film and television productions along with stage productions.\n\nJACK LONDON’S MARTIN EDEN is a superbly directed and acted film…a must-see!\n\nHUNGER WARD, winner of the 2021 BEST SHORT DOCUMENTARY by Skye Fitzgerald is nominated for the 2021 Oscar Academy Awards. His first two films of this Humanitarian Cinema trilogy were 50 FEET FROM SYRIA and LIFEBOAT. HUNGER WARD is the third and is borne out of a sense of urgency at the sustained civilian suffering caused by the human-caused famine in Yemen.\n\nFilmed in Yemen in early 2020, the film follows two female health care workers, Dr. Aida Alsadeeq and Nurse Mekkia Mahdi who are fighting the widespread starvation, a crisis in the country that has affected children due to the ongoing civil war in Yemen.\n\n“Though the war in Yemen has recently fallen off the front page, violence, hunger, and heartbreak continue to be the norm throughout the country. The fact that children are dying from malnutrition and outright starvation in 2020 is an outrage and an indictment of the entire global community,” said Fitzgerald in a statement. “The COVID crisis is only exacerbating the situation and making it even more dangerous for local doctors and aid workers to function effectively.”\n\nAccording to Skye Fitzgerald, “I believe that the most compelling films often emerge from a deep and abiding belief that - simply put - they must be done. But is a passion to tell a compelling story and the craftsmanship to execute it enough? Five years ago, I decided it wasn’t. Despite a career of producing and directing documentary films that I felt were compelling statements on contemporary issues of our time, I came to believe they were not reaching a great enough audience nor activating sufficient change. So, I changed my approach to center on a single, core principle: empathy. I believe that if we can generate empathy for others, it becomes exceedingly difficult to create barriers. I call this approach Humanitarian Cinema. The trilogy focuses on studying the global refugee and displaced person crisis with a cinematic eye and rendering films capable of eliciting empathy for the burgeoning refugee and IDP (internally displaced person) community.”\n\n2021 winner of the BEST SHORT NARRATIVE, THE LAST JAM JAR by Arpan Bahl is inspired by a true story, a story of eternal love. On their special day, Govind spends it with Leela in a trance-like state. When the day ends, and he returns home will the trance be broken?\n\nBahl says of himself, “I have always been an emotional person. Emotions mean a lot to me. While growing up I would read stories and emotions would register first. Even today when I watch or read a story the emotional takeaway is the strongest. As a filmmaker, it was always my desire to tell an emotional story. A love story. But then love is vast and endless. There are stories of love and then there are stories of love. I decided to tell a story of love, death & longing. A new take on everlasting love that has not been seen before.\n\nIt all started when a friend told me the story of his grandfather’s love for his wife. It moved me a lot. After his wife passed away his grandfather would just not accept that she was gone. The day she died, he sat next to her and would not let anyone touch her body. He talked to her, caressed her, throughout the day. That night the family somehow took him away from her and cremated her body. He still sat on their bed and would not move. Days went by, he would eat on the bed and then sleep there. Slowly the family took him away from her. Now, he lives in the same house but keeps an empty chair and a plate for her when he eats. He signs letters he writes with her name next to his. He hasn’t given away any of her possessions.\n\nAs a storyteller on my directorial debut, I feel I have been able to tell a unique emotional story of love. It is dedicated to all those romantics and ardent lovers of any era that belief in “love is forever”. I present my labor of love “The Last Jam Jar” - a story of eternal love caught in a moment.\n\nWinner of the 2021 BEST SHORT ANIMATION, TIMES OF PLENTY by Claudio Costa is set in the Italy of the 1980s, the time of the Socialist Party and young, upwardly mobile “Yuppies”.\n\nThe life of Cesare, a young boy living in Rome with his parents, is told through comic-dramatic situations through which the Italy of that time is revealed. Cesare and his family are all overweight, with the exception of his cousin Roberta (with whom Cesare is secretly in love).\n\nThe title refers to the socio-cultural climate of the 80s and 90s which saw, among other things, the introduction of Silvio Berlusconi’s privately-owned TV channels and the new agreement with the Holy See; a period in which Italy came to be the fifth leading industrial country in the world, but also a time of spiraling growth in public spending, growth that many already knew could not last long.\n\nClaudio Costa writer, director, producer, and illustrator, since 2007, directed and produced more than 55 documentaries and shorts, that are now being recognized on the Italian film festival circuit.\n\nWOMAN by Lillian Carter is the winner of the 2021 BEST EXPERIMENTAL SHORT film. A revelation of the three archetypes that all women utilize throughout their lives, the innate strengths women draw upon for understanding life, making decisions, arriving at resolutions, and deriving perspective. The Mother represents Unconditional Love; The Hunter, search for the Truth; The Witch is Wisdom and Intuition.\n\nLillian Carter received her BFA from The Boston Conservatory in 1990. She is Assistant Professor at Boston Conservatory at Berklee since 2001. Lillian teaches Musical Theater Dance Courses and has choreographed the musicals Tommy and The Apple Tree at Boston Conservatory. Carter is the founder, artistic director, and choreographer for Greenglass Dance Theater. Her choreography was featured in the opening segment of Monster Jam at the TD Garden with 50 Cent, Young Buck and Lil Wayne as well as St. Mark's Church in NYC with The Choreographer's Group. The Boston Herald has called her work \"hilarious\" and The Boston Globe \"clever\". Lillian developed and presented choreographic workshops for Border's Books in Boston, New York City at The World Trade Center, and New Jersey. She developed movement classes for MA. General Hospital in Revere to promote physical fitness within the elder community and for veterans and people with wheelchairs at the Soldiers Home in Chelsea Ma.\n\nAIFF considers THE ART OF MAKING IT by Kelcey Edwards a revealing expose of the art world. It follows a diverse cast of young artists at defining moments in their careers to explore whether the art world ecosystem meant to nurture them is failing them. Are we at risk of losing the creative voices of a new generation as universities, galleries, and museums face cataclysmic changes? Or, are we on the verge of recreating outdated modes of experiencing art to make it accessible to all? Embracing the conundrum of how artists must be in the market yet not of it, THE ART OF MAKING IT is both a cautionary tale about what America stands to lose if we don’t rethink what we value and why and a love letter to those who persevere in their artistic practice despite the extraordinary odds against ever achieving success.\n\nKelcey Edwards, is an award-winning filmmaker, author, and curator. She received an MFA in Documentary Film from Stanford University. Her production and her feature documentary credits include Wonder Women! The Untold Story of American Superheroines (SXSW premiere, Independent Lens broadcast) and Words of Witness (Berlinale premiere, Al Jazeera America broadcast). Kelcey’s fiction has appeared in the story South and Border Crossing; her art writing has been published by Hamptons Art Hub, Portray Magazine, and Salomon Contemporary, and her nonfiction has been published in New Voices from Stanford (Stanford University Press) and Persistence of Vision (Austin Film Society). Kelcey has lectured at Pratt, Barnard, The New School, and NYU Tisch. She also runs Iron Gate East, an exhibition series based in the Hamptons, inspired by her pioneering gallery, Iron Gate Studios, which she co-founded in Austin in 2003.\n\nTHE WITCHES OF THE ORIENT by Julien Faraut is a documentary that chronicles the reunion of the former players of the Japanese women’s volleyball team. Now in their 70s, they used to be known as the «Witches of the Orient» because of their seemingly supernatural powers on the courts.\n\nFrom the formation of the squad in the late 1950s as a worker’s team at a textile factory, right up until their triumph at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, their memories and true magic from long ago bubble up into a heady brew where fact and fable fly hand in hand.\n\nThe Witches of the Orient also delivers a fascinating image of a post-WW2 world, in which Japan was trying to overcome its image of a vanquished nation, previously presided over by cruel rulers. The country could not have wished for a better, nor a more sympathy-inducing, way to bounce back.\n\nMR. EMANCIPATION: The Walter Perry Story by Preston Chase documents the story of Walter L. Perry’s determination to put on a celebration that would transcend divisions of race and class. He staged an Emancipation Day festival that was where everyone wanted to be. Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King Jr, Jesse Owens all headed there because, as civil rights activist Dick Gregory said, \"The largest Juneteenth celebration was not in America, it was in Windsor, Canada. “From 1936 until 1967, that's how Walter Perry celebrated freedom.\n\nPerry and his celebration got caught up in the overheated racial politics of the day, sabotage, and race riots of 1967 in Detroit. His event never recovered that year and shortly after Walter Perry died…. but the spirit of Mister Emancipation still lives on.\n\nPreston William Chase is a seventh-generation African Canadian and a descendant of William Parker. Parker escaped slavery in Maryland and went on to play a key role in the Christiana Riots in Pennsylvania. It was his friend, the great Fredrick Douglass who convinced Parker to take refuge in Canada. Born to a single mother in the Black community of downtown Windsor, Ontario, Canada, Chase went on to become a high school teacher. He is also a family historian and a passionate advocate for justice.\n\nMARRY ME HOWEVER by Mordechai Vardi explores the lives of Orthodox-Jewish LGBT members who willingly choose to marry heterosexuals and raise a heteronormative family, obeying the rules of their societies while denying their own identities.\n\nThe film tells the stories of LGBT men and women who, for religious reasons, decided to marry against their own sexual orientation, to comply with Torah laws and be accepted into their families and religious communities. Some shared their secret with their partners, some kept it hidden, and some lied even to themselves. After their divorces, they confront the conflicts they repressed: their faith and religious laws; children, family, and community; exposure to society and search for a partner. The characters experience a journey of self-acceptance and social activism, as they try to affect a change in their religious environments. The film also follows the women who married and divorced homosexual partners, as well as rabbis and psychologists who seek a solution to an unsolvable conflict.\n\nMordechai Vardi (62) graduated master’s degree, in Film and Television at Tel Aviv University. Was the head of the screenwriting department at the \"MAALE\" Film School for 20 years. He has produced and directed documentaries for various channels.\n\nTHERE WILL BE NO MORE NIGHT by filmmaker Éléonore Weber is a fascinating yet terrifying documentary that looks to decipher and reflect upon images filmed by helicopters on operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. Filmmaker Éléonore Weber shares video recordings of French and American missions and what begins as a monotone video essay gradually develops with powerful tension; as viewers, we find ourselves in the pilot’s seat. We catch fragments of conversations between crew members; we look, zoom in, interpret, hesitate—and then comes the explosion. A documentary that captures the tremendous tension between observation and interpretation in nighttime war zone missions, decisions being made with far-reaching consequences, a captivating journey that opens a door into the world of war that is generally closed to us.\n\nÉléonore Weber is an author, and a theatre and film director. Her approach until now explores both the theatre and cinema languages. Regarding cinema, she directed a short and a medium-length fiction film, Temps Mort and Les Hommes sans Gravité. She has also directed a documentary, Night Replay (Arte - La Lucarne), shot in Mexico… reenactments from a role-play invented by migrants. Regarding theatre, she has created some plays and performances with Patricia Allio, centered on a manifest entitled Symptôme et Proposition. Together or separately, the two artists presented their creations at the Festival d’Avignon, the Bastille Theatre, the Grande Halle de la Villette, or the Centre Georges Pompidou for the Festival d’Automne.\n\nDaizy Gedeon director of ENOUGH! Lebanon's Darkest Hour is the first feature documentary to be released since the Beirut Port explosion and is the first film to capture exclusive and controversial interviews with many of the key political leaders (Prime Minister Saad Hariri, former Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, Dr. Samir Geagea, Hezbollah Minister Mohammad Fneich, Former Justice Minister Salim Jreissati, Governor of the Central Bank, Riad Salame, among others) prior to the explosion. These are the very men responsible for much of Lebanon's desecration.\n\nThe eyes of the world were forced to turn their gaze upon Lebanon, not only because of the Beirut Port explosion that devastated this ancient city on 4th August 2020, but also because, sadly, Lebanon stands as an allegory for kleptocratic regimes that have seen a resurgence across the globe, and their catastrophic impact. Before the explosion, the country was already cowering under the weight of decades of civil conflict, unrelenting regional turmoil but mostly from endemic, systemic corruption, and pure greed. This film puts the spotlight on this ruling class and the manifold issues facing the country. Through incisive interviews with the whistle-blower, former Director-General of the Ministry of Finance, Alain Bifani, and academic and Middle East expert Thanassis Cambanis, the film blows the lid on the under-the-table, pie-sharing deals that have permitted many of these leaders, their families, and cronies to remain in power for decades.\n\nThe film addresses the revolution and the global social justice movement that was triggered in 2019 among the diaspora who rallied to support their families and friends back home. It provides a powerful insight into the complex traditional and emotional loyalties within human beings that still, to this day, threaten any chance for change and evolution.\n\nTHE PIANIST FROM RAMALLAH by Avida Livny documents four years in the life of Muhammad \"Misha\" Alsheikh, a talented teenage pianist from Ramallah, who is the son of a Palestinian father and a mother who came from Russia. It takes Muhammad 3 hours to get from his house to a piano lesson with Emma, his Jewish-Israeli teacher who also came from Russia and now lives in Jerusalem, but his dream is bigger than borders. Between checkpoints, auditions, and his father's will that he will become a doctor, he tries to fulfill his dream of becoming a professional pianist - and stay happy.\n\nAvida Livny is a graduate of the Tel Aviv University film school. He is the director of many documentary films and TV series such as \"On the Move\" (2008), \"Looking for Moshe Guez\" (2011), \"A Standard Love Song\" (2017, winner of the Israeli academy awards for best documentary TV series) and \"Murder on Cinema North\" (2020, mentioned as best documentary film of the year by \"Israel's Film Critics Forum\").\n\nRESTORATION: A Concert Film by Native Son, Benny Starr, Rodrick Cliche\n\nIn the Spring of 2020, the Acres of Ancestry Initiative/Black Agrarian Fund collaborated with the South Carolina Lowcountry hip hop group, Native Son, to create the anthem for a campaign, “The Land.” “The Land” is a generation’s love offering to the beautiful struggle to protect 1.5 million acres of Black farmlands from USDA dispossession. Our work continues to grow with Native Son with Restoration: A Concert Film\n\nThe film explores southern Black agrarian stories of self-determination, land ownership, and folk wit; amplifies ongoing struggles for restorative land justice in this country including the Black Farmers’ Appeal: Cancel Pigford Debt Campaign; and weaves together live musical performances from Native Son and the personal narratives of Black legacy farmers and land stewards throughout the film.\n\nThe Black Farmers’ Appeal: Cancel Pigford Debt Campaign is a grassroots organizing, popular education, and legal advocacy campaign to rectify the injustices of the Pigford v. Glick class-action discrimination lawsuit. Inspired by David Walker’s impassioned entreaty against the chattel enslavement of Africans in the United States, the Black Farmers’ Appeal is a polemic against yet another form of racialized capitalism–unconscionable debt. The coalition is comprised of a multigenerational tribe of farmers, attorneys, writers, artists, and musicians using their diverse magic to bring restorative land justice to Black legacy farmers. Linages have formed uniting music, culture, ecocultural traditions, and cooperative economy to protect Black land ownership and stewardship while raising community awareness, collectivism, and action. There is an aim to merge with the cooperative economy working with fiber artists, heritage quilters, and keepers of material culture.\n\nHACKING FOR THE COMMONS, a Boston Premiere by French/Swiss filmmaker Philippe Borrel introduces us to those who, from India to the United States via Europe, are experimenting with the emancipation tools of \"free software\" to bring concrete solutions in a multitude of fields in which collective practices are known as ‘open’ - thus ‘non-proprietary - are spreading in agriculture, medicines and in education. You will hear from Richard Stallman, founder of The Free Software Foundation, a non-profit org founded in 1985 to support the free software movement which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify computer software with a preference for software being distributed under copyleft or share-alike terms. The FSF was incorporated in Boston, MA where it is based and continues its work on legal and structural issues on behalf of the international movement and community.\n\nLuke Jarvis won the OUTSTANDING LOCAL FILMMAKER award for his narrative feature film SALESMEN.

I love the playful and self-assured look of the bird, and how he is looking directly at the viewer. Overall, it is humorous and wonderful in its simplicity: bird, cameras, viewers. The color palette is unusual and eye-catching. As a poster design, it is spot-on: the image directs focus right to the center, to the already-integrated title text.”\n\nWith the founding of AIFF in 2010, the Poster Contest Competition was the first project to spin-off connecting film with the arts. This year’s competition is offered exclusively to Professor Robert Maloney’s illustration class at Mass College of Art & Design.

Chinese traditional paper cutting has Taoist philosophy behind its form, a disappearing art form in China amidst the rapid urbanization.

Although it seemed far from taxation and brokerage, there were commonalities, constant hand movements, passion for the work, the desire to help others, and creativity. Matthis’s intent for the viewer of her art is that one may “see within“, something that will compel them to become self-reflective and that self-reflection will result in an energized and peaceful spirit.

These improvisational works capture the energy and spontaneity of graffiti, and retain the rich texture of the mixed-media paintings sacrificed to make them.”\n\nBetty Stone\n\nStone, a noted photographer, is a native of Boston and currently lives and works in Arlington. She was a member of the 2012 Photography Atelier16 with Karen Davis and Meg Birnbaum at the Griffin Museum of Photography in Winchester, MA.
