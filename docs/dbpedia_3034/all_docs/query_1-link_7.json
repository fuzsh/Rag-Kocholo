        "text": "♪♪ [Ciriaco Chavez] So, we're in the heart of Yolo County, uh, in the Sacramento Valley.\n\nBeautiful area, one of the premier locations to plant olives.\n\nWe're actually in the Dunnigan Hills in Yolo County.\n\nUm, so, it's characterized by these nice rolling hills.\n\nFantastic location for growing olives.\n\nOlives are one of the oldest cultivated tree crops known to humankind.\n\nResearchers believe the origins of these beautiful trees could date back as far as 8,000 years, beginning in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nTo this day, the olive branch is a symbol of peace.\n\nThis day is action packed with a high-tech harvest running 24 hours a day for two months.\n\n[Rob Stewart] They're so lush and packed.\n\n[Ciriaco] Yeah, they're beautiful.\n\nYeah, yeah, It's... it's... it's a really fantastic year so far... Ciriaco Chavez oversees the harvest and is the VP of Agriculture at Cobram Estate based in Woodland, California.\n\nHe says California olives rival the best in the world.\n\n[Ciriaco] At Cobram Estate, we're pioneering in California, the high density planting system which is sort of the spacing that you see here.\n\nTrees further spaced out.\n\nIt allows us to plant any variety we want to plant.\n\nThese varieties, Picual, Coratina, Mission olives, which is another unique variety, um, that's unique to California.\n\nWe're bringing it back to life really.\n\nIt's a variety that was originally planted in California hundreds of years ago, the mission variety, which is the only uniquely Californian variety.\n\nWe won the world's healthiest olive oil with Mission variety olives.\n\nCobram Estate has a quarter million trees on thousands of acres of land in the Sacramento Valley.\n\nEvery single olive tree will pass through the giant mouth of the Colossus XL, a million-dollar machine and the only one of its kind in North America.\n\nThe machine has 750 picking rods that rotate and spin, which causes the olives to fall on conveyors and into a harvest trailer.\n\nThe speed of each row is calculated based on the number of olives per tree, stripping the branches of more than 90% of the ripe green fruit.\n\nAfter the field harvest, it's a race against the clock.\n\nThe dangers for extra virgin olive oil are time and heat.\n\nThe faster these olives are off to the processing plant and into the mill just minutes from the field, the higher the quality of extra virgin olive oil.\n\nThe transformation from fruit to oil must happen within four to six hours.\n\nLeandro Rivetti is co-CEO and Chief Oil Maker.\n\n[Leandro] The... the olives that are picked directly from the tree with our harvesters get delivered to this mill.\n\nThe fruit arrives.\n\nWe just remove the leaves.\n\nWe blow the leaves away, clean the fruit, and then the fruit is crushed and turned into tapenade, like an olive paste, within a stainless-steel hammer crusher.\n\nThat olive paste is then mixed very gently and slowly for about an hour.\n\nAnd that process that we call the malaxation process, um, allows the little droplets of oil that were present in the flesh of a fruit to merge and to form a larger oil phase that then will make the separation through a centrifuge much, much easier.\n\nSo that's it.\n\nYou know, that's the entire process.\n\nThere's no chemicals, there's no heat that- nothing added to it.\n\nThe extra virgin olive oil is stored inside these stainless-steel temperature-controlled tanks, locking in the freshness and the flavor until it's bottled, shipped and sold.\n\nEach of these tanks holds one million dollars' worth of extra virgin olive oil, among the healthiest cooking oils available.\n\n[Leandro] Probably, when it comes down to the prevention and... and the- let's call it treatment or management of chronic disease like, um, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, or even cognitive disease like Alzheimer's, there's no other food that comes even close to extra virgin olive oil in terms of the amount of medical evidence to support its use and... and its relevance within the context of the Mediterranean diet.\n\nNormally, a doctor will refer to olive oil from the health perspective, they are really talking about extra virgin olive oil.\n\nAnd when chefs talk about the fantastic flavors of olive oil, they actually are really talking about extra virgin olive oil.\n\nJust in time to tempt your taste buds, pizza is coming out of this wood fire oven.\n\nThe recipe calls for a heavy drizzle of fresh extra virgin olive oil.\n\nIt's a savory delight and another version of California gold.\n\n[Ciriaco] It's an important industry to be a part of.\n\nIt's an important industry because it's feeding America.\n\nI'm really proud to say that I am working in an area, in a farm, especially in California, where we produce such a breadth of crops, from nuts to melons, to artichokes to extra virgin olive oil.\n\nWe're producing these extremely high-quality products and feeding America.\n\n♪♪ Let's give you some olive knowledge.\n\nAll olives start out green and then turn black or dark purple as they ripen.\n\nAnd olive trees have long lives.\n\nOlive trees have been known to live hundreds of years.\n\nIf you're thinking of making your own olive oil, you'll need to press around 11 pounds of olives to make just one quart of olive oil."
