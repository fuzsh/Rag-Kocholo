        "text": "(January 13, 2024)\n\nCheryl Hess has been doing the film festival circuit with her hilarious short documentary about a vegan recipe at a Meatball Contest.\n\nAnd we have that recipe for you below.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nWe asked Cheryl some questions about making the film.\n\nHow did you first hear about the vegan meatball controversy?\n\nI first heard about it when I read an article online in Philadelphia Magazine right after it happened. My initial reaction was “this is the most South Philly” thing I’ve ever heard and I’ve been living in South Philly for over 20 years. As I thought about it more I realized it would make a great subject for a documentary so I kind of filed the idea away until the following year when I approached Jen Zavala to see if she was going to enter the meatball contest again and if she would be willing to be filmed.\n\nWas it hard to convince people to participate?\n\nIt really wasn’t. People in South Philly have strong opinions and they love to share them! I first approached local restauranteurs Michael Strauss and Pete Frye who were the founders and organizers of the meatball contest. They put me in touch with Jen and also with Biagio who was one of the contest judges. I met each of them for a coffee and they came on board. Everything fell into place really quickly.\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge?\n\nThe production part was actually quite easy. As I mentioned I live in South Philly so most of the shooting locations were a really close to my house. I started my career as a one-person band video journalist and I have my own gear so when I needed to film I was able to just pick up my camera and go out and shoot. I was a crew of one 95% of the time. Obviously that style of production has its challenges but it also allows a level of intimacy that it is really hard to achieve when you are working with a larger crew. So I would say the biggest challenge was definitely finding the story in the edit. It seems like a no brainer given the subject matter but since the meatball controversy happened the year before I started filming I had to simultaneously tell a story that took place in the past while following it in the present. My editor Melissa Thompson did an amazing job of balancing those two things.\n\nHow has the reaction been?\n\nThe reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. It is definitely a crowd-pleaser and I think that’s because I was able to explore serious issues through a humorous lens. In the case of She Got Balls! I was able to use a very quirky, very local story to talk about gentrification and the culture wars and that really resonated with audiences.\n\nWhat’s next for you?\n\nI’m currently in post-production on my first feature-length documentary. It’s called Marriage Cops and its about a marriage counseling center in India that is run by the local police and staffed by police women who try to solve marital problems using a combination of carrot and stick.\n\n“Past/Presence: Saving the Spring Garden School” is a short created in 2018 by Cheryl Hess and architecture firm, Kramer + Marks about Spring Garden School, a school in North Philadelphia that was vacant and abandoned for nearly 30 years before the Philadelphia Housing Authority teamed with the non-profit Help USA to convert the property into affordable housing for low-income senior citizens and homeless veterans.\n\nVEGAN MEATBALLS RECIPE BELOW\n\nCheryl Hess is a filmmaker and cinematographer from Philadelphia whose work has screened nationally and internationally. She is a recipient of the prestigious Pew Fellowship in the Arts and her work has been supported by the Tribeca Film Institute, the Knight Foundation, the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, the Wyncote Foundation and others. In 2018 Cheryl won the grand prize in the AIA Film Challenge for a short documentary she directed, shot, and edited in just 16 days. That same year she was a finalist in the Tribeca If/Then Shorts Northeast competition with her latest short She Got Balls! which was recently awarded the Best Director (Short) prize at the Atlanta Docufest. She is currently in post-production on her first feature documentary, Marriage Cops, which was one of the projects selected for the 2023 Hot Docs Pitch Forum in Toronto. Cheryl also has a YouTube channel called “Analog Girl” where she talks about working with film and motion picture cameras. She received her MFA in Film and Media Arts from Temple University.\n\nWebsite\n\nFollow Cheryl on Instagram,\n\nJennifer Zavala’s Vegan Meatball Recipe\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n1 14-oz. can of chickpeas, drained. Save the liquid.\n\n1 1/2 onion, diced\n\n3 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped\n\n1 large carrot, peeled and diced\n\n1 squash or zucchini, chopped\n\n1 cup of kale\n\n1 lemon, zested and juiced\n\n1 tbsp. fennel seed\n\n1 tbsp. red pepper flakes\n\n1 tsp. oregano\n\n1 tsp. fresh thyme\n\n1/4 cup chickpea water (saved from can)\n\n2 cups chickpea flour (can substitute all-purpose flour)\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nDrain a can of chickpeas, saving the liquid and setting aside.\n\nCombine diced onion, chopped garlic, diced carrot, chopped squash and kale in a food processor. Blend until minced.\n\nAdd a half cup of olive oil into a pan. Pour the veggie mixture in the pan and cook, stirring often.\n\nAdd the drained chickpeas to the food processor. Blend until smooth.\n\nAdd the fennel seed, red pepper flakes, oregano, and fresh thyme to the cooking vegetables. When the spices are aromatic, remove the vegetables from heat.\n\nPlace the blended chickpeas into a bowl. After the veggies have cooled, add them to the chickpeas. Mix with a spoon to combine. Stir in the lemon zest and juice, and add salt to taste.\n\nAdd the flour and the chickpea water. Mix again. Add more flour as needed until balls can be formed.\n\nHeat oil in pan for frying. Place balls in oil, turning over to fry all sides. Remove when browned, and place on a paper towel to allow the excess oil to drain. Serve warm.\n\nAnd if you need a visualization of the recipe, Zavala recommends this YouTube video — while the ingredients are not exactly the same (eggs aren’t vegan, after all), the process of making them is similar.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nCourtesy of Jennifer Zavala, Caroline Cunningham, and Philadelphia Magazine.\n\nFrom the Culinary Connection Recipe Book 2024 courtesy of Pa Preferred\n\nJennifer Zavala’s family is a Mexican and Italian blend though she mostly grew up learning to cook Latino dishes which are her focus today with special twists.
