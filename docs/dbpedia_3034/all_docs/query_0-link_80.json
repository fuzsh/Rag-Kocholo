        "text": "Good Bad Things – Director Shane D. Stanger & Lead Actor Danny Kurtzman\n\nDirector Shane D. Stanger’s impassioned film, GOOD BAD THINGS, tells the story of Danny, young man with muscular dystrophy, has been disillusioned by too many failed relationships. He decides he wants to shake things up, step out of his comfort zone and into the world of online dating. An unexpected match with Madi (Jessica Parker Kennedy), an enigmatic photographer, challenges him to be vulnerable and sparks a profound journey of self-acceptance and discovering the extraordinary beauty of his unique body. Director and co-writer Shane D. Stanger and co-writer and lead actor Danny Kurtzman join us for a conversation on how their life-long friendship sparked the decision to write the script for Good Bad Things, pulling together family and friends to work on the film, Danny’s own growth as a writer and now as an accomplished actor, winning the Audience Award at the 2024 Slamdance Film Festival and now seeing the film get a well-deserved theatrical distribution.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-8-15-24%20Kurtzman%20%26%20Stanger%20-%20Good%20Bad%20Things.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to goodbadthings.com\n\nDirector’s Statement – When I set out to make GOOD BAD THINGS, I had quite a simple goal: direct my first feature film with my childhood best friend Danny Kurtzman as the lead actor. Our relationship is unique enough that we knew we had a story to tell in a way only we could. Through Danny’s perspective, we explore love, friendship finding the courage to take risks, and the impact of perception on our realities.

In 2021, evidence of unmarked graves was discovered on the grounds of an Indian residential school run by the Catholic Church in Canada. After years of silence, the forced separation, assimilation and abuse many children experienced at these segregated boarding schools was brought to light, sparking a national outcry against a system designed to destroy Indigenous communities. Set amidst a groundbreaking investigation, SUGARCANE illuminates the beauty of a community breaking cycles of intergenerational trauma and finding the strength to persevere. Co-directors Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie join us for a conversation on how their focus changed during the filming of SUGARCANE, getting to know the dedicated people like Whitney Spearing and Charlene Belleau who devoted themselves to uncovering the repugnant history of St. Joseph’s Residential School and the “Indian Problem”, capturing the unfolding relationship between Julian and his father, Ed Archie NoiseCat and filming the disturbing conversation between Former First Nation Chief Rick Gilbert and the Vatican’s Superior General Louis Lougen concerning san acknowledgment or apology from the Catholic Church regarding their administration of Residential Schools in North America.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-8-16-24%20Kassie%20%26%20NoiseCat.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: nationalgeographic.com/sugarcane\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Julian Brave NoiseCat is a writer, filmmaker and student of Salish art and history.

Shadowed by the murder of his entire family, the young, wary Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) eliminates his devious adoptive grandfather (Peter O’Toole) and seizes control of the declining Roman Empire, descending into a spiral of depravity, destruction, and madness. A treatise on the corrupting influence of power, this extensive reconstruction of the notorious 1980 spectacle, CALIGULA: THE ULTIMATE CUT restores the complete performances of Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren, as the promiscuous ‘Caesonia’, from an unprecedented amount of never before seen footage. Sumptuous set designs by two-time Oscar winner Danilo Donati. CALIGULA: THE ULTIMATE CUT aligns closely to Vidal’s original script, especially with the addition of a prologue that illustrates one of Vidal’s missing scenes, created by noted graphic artist Dave McKean (Grant Morrison’s Arkham Asylum, Neil Gaiman’s Sandman). Nearly 100 hours of original footage was discovered by the film’s re-constructionist, film historian Thomas Negovan, in the Penthouse archive, which showcases astounding performances from the film’s cast, fully realizing McDowell’s complex, charismatic ‘Caligula’ and resurrecting Mirren’s layered character arc, which now cements the film’s final hour. Producer & Re-constructionist Thomas Negovan joins us to talk about his own daunting journey of reviewing the hundreds of hours of footage, his decision to use an enormous amount of never before seen footage in this final cut, seeking out many the surviving cast and crew, provide an artistic context to McDowell’s performance and to give the film a chance to be seen as flawed, but wildly ambitious cinematic journey into the heart of a darkness at the rotting core of the Roman Empire.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-8-16-24%20Negovan%20-%20Caligula%20Ultimate%20Cut.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: drafthousefilms.com/caligula\n\nThe notorious history of CALIGULA: Initially Released in 1980, CALIGULA was the most expensive independent film in cinema history but had a tumultuous journey to the screen. Written by the esteemed Gore Vidal and headed by the stellar cast of Malcolm McDowell, Dame Helen Mirren, Peter O’Toole and Sir John Gielgud, CALIGULA was meant to be an epic showcase of the generation’s finest talent, addressing the corrupting influence of power amid the rampant sexuality of the Roman court.However, Penthouse founder (and the film’s financier) Bob Guccione seized control of the negative, randomly inserting graphic scenes of unsimulated sex and gratuitous violence. The cast and film team disavowed what had become a blatant desecration of Vidal’s themes, who sued to have his name removed from the project. The extensive coverage of behind-the-scenes notoriety also had an unexpected effect: the film was a box office success.\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Thomas Negovan was born in Chicago and is the author of numerous art history books documenting rare work from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He has curated exhibitions and collections of rare and important Art Nouveau, Symbolist, and Expressionist artworks, lectured on the Vienna Secession and German cabaret during the Weimar Republic, and written the definitive monographs on artists Gail Potocki, Clive Barker, David Mack, and Michael Hussar. As a photographer, his work has been published in Condé Nast travel publications, and in the field of music worked as orchestra director for R. Kelly and recorded an entirely analog album on wax cylinder in 2011. In that year, Negovan gave a TEDx talk “By Popular Demand” on his experience in creating the first music recorded and released without the use of electricity in over a century. Aurora (2018) was his first film.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nfacebook.com/drafthousefilms\n\nfacebook.com/thomasnegovan\n\nx.com/drafthousefilms\n\nx.com/ThomasNegovan\n\ninstagram.com/drafthousefilms\n\ninstagram.com/nuarttheatre\n\ninstagram.com/thomasnegovan\n\ninstagram.com/caligulaultimatecut\n\n86% on RottenTomatoes\n\n“A surprisingly spellbinding reimagining of one of cinema’s most infamous disasters, “Caligula – The Ultimate Cut” is a stunning achievement.” – Stephanie Malone, Morbidly Beautiful\n\n“It belongs on the big screen, to a world of cinematic sensation beyond lightweight blockbusters and under-financed independents.” – Jennie Kermode, Eye for Film\n\n“…this restored version of Caligula is the only one that counts, popping the rating from a one star to a five overnight, and The Ultimate Cut is a remarkable vindication for Malcolm McDowell that finally reveals arguably his best performance…” – Eddie Harrison, film-authority.com\n\n“This is three hours I’ll never get back and nor would I wish to.

In a waterfront campground off the coast of Virginia, residents spend their summers living spitting distance apart in rust-bitten RVs. They chuckle about the modest rent they pay for a million-dollar location, but what makes them the luckiest people in the world is more than just stunning sunsets, it’s the community they’ve created. Beneath cliched trailer park stereotypes lies an unlikely utopia where all are welcome. Neighbors help each other out, and share everything from power tools to simple pleasures. Loneliness and isolation are inconceivable. When their affordable paradise is sold to developers, the residents brace for eviction and the loss of friendships that span generations. They hold tight to their final days in the sun. The well-heeled crowd that takes their place will never be as wealthy. Director Amy Nicholson (Zipper: Coney Island’s Last Wild Ride) stops by to talk about how she discovered this magical community, gaining the confidence of the denizens, her own history vacationing there and why the loss of places like Inlet Park is undermining our connection with one another.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-98-9-24%20Nicholson%20-%20Happy%20Campers.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: happycampers.film\n\nOpening theatrically in Los Angeles on August 21 at the Laemmle Monica and on August 22 at the Laemmle NoHo with a VOD Release to follow\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Amy Nicholson is a New York-based filmmaker and commercial director whose projects often explore the essence of Americana with a humorous eye and a warm respect for her subjects.

But it’s nevertheless an emotional exploration of a group on the fringes and how anyone can find a welcoming community.” – Christian Gallichio, The Playlist\n\n“Rather than have the audience relive the summers of the Inlet, we experience it right now in its last gasp. Yet the footage collection feels so timeless, Happy Campers becomes a portrait of a place of hope, love, and melancholy.” – Alan French, Sunshine State Cineplex\n\nWater Brother – Co-directors Charles Kinnane & Daniel Kinnane\n\nWATER BROTHER: THE SID ABBRUZZI STORY follows the life of surf and skate core legend and cultural icon Sid Abbruzzi, and his commitment to protecting the sports’ history and culture. Through a mix of never-before-seen archival film, large format cinematic footage, and personal interviews from culture giants like Tony Hawk, Shepard Fairey, Selema Masekela and more; we are taken on a journey through surfing and skating history – from 1960s Newport to Santa Cruz, Cocoa Beach, South Africa’s Jeffrey’s Bay, and beyond. As Sid approaches the age of 72, the film captures the final days of his famous Water Brothers Surf & Skate shop as it is set to be demolished and the impact it had on the surf and skate community. WATER BROTHER emphasizes the importance of memory, personal history, and living in the moment, reminding us to cherish our past and preserve cultural heritage. The film is a poignant reflection on a life well-lived and a heartfelt tribute to the enduring spirit of surf culture.

Titled after Beckett’s famous ethos “Dance first, think later,” The film is a sweeping account of the life of this 20th-century icon. It focuses on his relationships with the people he loved and who loved him back, but who he felt that he had wronged. Director David Marsh (The Theory of Everything) joins us for a conversation on why he chose to dive into the life of a notoriously private man, working with screenwriter Neil Forsyth, their decision to frame the various chapters of Beckett’s life from the perspective of his”mistakes”, using a black and white format in filming the story and finally assembling a terrific cast includes; Fionn O’Shea, Sandrine Bonnaire, Leonie Lojkine, Bronagh Gallagher, Grainne Good, Robert Aramayo, Maxine Peake, and Aidan Gillen as James Joyce.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-8-9-24%20Marsh%20-%20Dance%20First.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: magpictures.com/dancefirst\n\nTo watch go to: magpictures.com/dancefirst/watch-at-home\n\nAugust 9th theatrical opening in NYC at the Angelika Film Center and in Los Angeles at the Laemmle Monica Film Center\n\nAbout the filmmaker – James Marsh is a celebrated writer and director of narrative feature films and documentaries.

Rising from the rubble of a bankrupt Manhattan nightclub to becoming a state-of-the-art recording facility inspired by Hendrix’s desire for a permanent studio, Electric Lady Studios was the first ever artist-owned commercial recording studio. Hendrix had first envisioned creating an experiential nightclub, inspired by the short-lived Greenwich Village nightspot Cerebrum, whose patrons donned flowing robes and were inundated by flashing lights, spectral images, and swirling sound. Hendrix enjoyed the Cerebrum experience so much that he asked its architect, John Storyk, to work with him and his manager, Michael Jeffery, to transform what had once been the Generation Club into “an electric studio of participation.” Shortly after acquiring the Generation Club lease however, Hendrix was steered from building a nightclub to creating a commercial recording studio. Electric Lady Studios: A Jimi Hendrix Vision includes never-before-seen footage and photos as well as track breakdowns of Hendrix classics such as “Freedom,” “Angel” and “Dolly Dagger” by recording engineer Eddie Kramer. In addition to Kramer the film also includes appearances by John Storyk (Architect, Electric Lady Studios), Billy Cox (Band of Gypsy bassist), Mitch Mitchell (Experience drummer), Steve Winwood (Spencer Davis, Blind Faith), and Blues legend Buddy Guy. Director John McDermott joins us to talk about Jimi Hendrix’s burning desire to create music and provide a welcoming space for musicians to thrive. Electric Lady Studios has become the creative home to artists such as Stevie Wonder, The Rolling Stones, John Lennon, David Bowie, Beyoncé and some of the most celebrated music of all time.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-8-9-24%20McDermott%20-%20Electric%20Lady.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: ajimihendrixvision.com\n\nOr go to: abramorama.com/electric-lady-studios\n\nTo watch, go to: ajimihendrixvision.com/showtimes\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nfacebook.com/JimiHendrix\n\nfacebook.com/Abramorama\n\nx.com/JimiHendrix\n\nx.com/abramorama\n\ninstagram.com/abramorama\n\ninstagram.com/jimihendrix\n\nWar Game – Co-directors Jesse Moss and Tony Gerber\n\nWAR GAME sweeps audiences into an elaborate future-set simulation that dramatically escalates the threat posed by the January 6, 2021 insurrection.

Core to our mission is protecting democracy and the Constitutional rule of law. When we put on the uniform, we swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution – not a person, not a political party. That oath lives on, even when we take the uniform off. The exercise we undertook on January 6, 2023, which is the subject of War Game, was our most ambitious effort yet to help ensure that our government and military are well-prepared to defend our Republic when it may be at its most vulnerable. While the lessons learned were privately delivered to top government officials, the documentary is a crucially important vehicle to inform the public about the very real threat of domestic extremism and hyper-polarization, and how it will take all of us to defend our democracy from those who would seek to destroy it. Vet Voice Foundation is a non-profit, non-partisan organization, organized under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for charitable and educational purposes.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nfacebook.com/wargamefilm\n\nfacebook.com/jesse.moss1\n\nfacebook.com/tony.gerber1\n\nfacebook.com/VetVoiceFoundation\n\nx.com/wargamefilm\n\nx.com/FilmForumNYC\n\nx.com/MarketRoadFilms\n\nx.com/djessemoss\n\ninstagram.com/wargamefilm\n\ninstagram.com/tonygerber_\n\ninstagram.com/vetvoicefoundation\n\nReviews:\n\n“A briskly paced, compelling docu-thriller perfectly timed for another hotly contentious election year in the United States… As engaging as it is thought-provoking, War Game should attract US media and international outlets with an appetite for America’s instability, as well as news junkies who do not already get enough drama from the real world.” – Anthony Kaufman, Screen International\n\n“The movie takes viewers inside the three branches of the simulation, showcasing the intense decision-making techniques of people who’ve actually been read-in on some of the gravest moments in our country’s recent history.” – Jada Yuan, Washington Post\n\n“Chilling.

Warren, once a master Shakespearian actor, is now a gambling drunk. Puck-like Samuel enchants crowds on the 3rd Street Promenade, reciting Shakespeare. And brother Beckett, a master pickpocket, makes his way through the unsuspecting crowd. When Warren gets in deep with a loan shark, his sons need to find a way to escape and like Samuel’s beloved comic book hero, Phantom Halo, they must break free of the mud that traps them. There is counterfeit money, a Bentley, a beautiful woman, knives, guns and an ending that is more like a Shakespearean tragedy than a film about growing up in the urban decay of Hollywood. Featuring a cast that includes; Sebastian Roché, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Luke Kleintank, Rebecca Romijn (Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, The Librarians, X-Men), Tobin Bell (The Saw series, The Flash), Ashley Hamilton (Gothic Harvest, Rules Don’t Apply) and Jordan Dunn (Read the Room). Director and co-screenwriter Antonia Bogdanovich joins us for a revealing conversation about the traumatic origin story for Sleep No More, working with her dad on the project, her decision to re-cut and re-release the film after nearly 10 years, and growing up in a household steeped in arts, literature and film.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-7-26-24%20Bogdanovich%20-%20Sleep%20No%20More%20-%207%3A31%3A24%2C%204.28%20PM.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: thegmfilms.com/releases/sleep-no-more\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Director/ Producer/ Screenwriter Antonia Bogdanovich rose to prominence in 2015 with the release of her directorial debut, “Phantom Halo.” As a Hollywood native, Bogdanovich was surrounded by the movie industry. Of course, it also helped that her father was Oscar-nominated director Peter Bogdanovich. Growing up immersed in all things movies, Bogdanovich was practically groomed to have a career in the film industry. She started acting at age 4, having appeared in an uncredited role in her father’s Oscar-winning drama, “The Last Picture Show” (1971), and eventually went on to appear in “They All Laughed” (1981), “Illegally Yours” (1988), and “The Whole Wide World” (1996). However, Bogdanovich eventually found that her true passion was for writing. She wrote her first screenplay while attending UCLA, and found that she had a knack for the script format. After college she worked as a freelance journalist for local papers throughout the Los Angeles region, while spending her free time crafting screenplays. She eventually decided to focus her efforts entirely on screenplay writing, and in 2011, wrote and directed her debut short film, “My Left Hand.” The task of directing actors – something her father knew all too well – came effortlessly to Bogdanovich, and it wasn’t long before she realized she had found her calling. She then set out to write and direct a feature film. That film, 2015’s “Phantom Halo,” starring Rebecca Romijn and Tobin Bell, was well-received by critics upon its release.\n\nThe story behind the re-release of Sleep No More: As a child of Hollywood (Antonia Bogdanovich’s mother was renowned producer Polly Platt and her father was legendary film director Peter Bogdanovich), Antonia was smack dab in the middle of it all, and though she began her career as a freelance journalist, she eventually followed in her parent’s acclaimed footsteps behind the camera. Following the death of her father, Peter Bogdanovich in January 2022, Antonia thought about how she could carry on the legacy of her family, and her father – a storyteller of the first order – and it finally came to her: her first feature, SLEEP NO MORE (Originally titled Phantom Halo) had been largely misunderstood. After nearly 10 years she decided it was time to revisit the film with the goal of releasing a more clear and concise version; a film which, at the end of the day, is really about her intense relationship with her father and her very complicated home life. Unfortunately, upon the film’s initial release in 2014, the distributor quickly went under, leaving SLEEP NO MORE in theatrical limbo. Though it was a New York Times Critic’s Pick and a launch pad for many actors who’d go on to much larger things, including the two leads, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Luke Kleintank, it languished in relative obscurity… until now.

The pacing is mostly excellent as things move so fast audiences barely have time to breathe.” – Bobby LePire, Film Threat\n\nDevil Put the Coal in the Ground – Co-directors Lucas Sabean & Peter Hutchison\n\nDEVIL PUT THE COAL IN THE GROUND is a moving portrayal of resilience by the people of West Virginia that reveals –despite years of corporate greed and exploitation – how a deep love of family, community and tradition has carried them through it all. From the realities of a crumbling economy, to the ravages of the opioid epidemic, to the irreparable environmental damage and its tragic impact on human health – the film is a cautionary tale of unfettered corporate power, and an elegy to a vanishing Appalachia. Uniquely structured upon personal storytelling of West Virginians, the film draws upon their rich experiences and diverse perspectives in order to create an informal, oral “People’s History of West Virginia”. These individuals run the gamut – from recovering opioid addict, to environmental activist, to U.S. Congressional candidate, to town judge, to recovery center nurse, to corporate environmental lawyer, to struggling local business owner – all of whom, despite their differences, remain linked by the love of their home state and the challenges that threaten their survival, and way of life. DEVIL PUT THE COAL IN THE GROUND features the iconic music of Steve Earle and Iris Dement, while blending intimate first-person storytelling with rare archival photography from DOCUMERICA luminary Jack Corn. Stunning aerial footage, bespoke animation, and an original score complete this heartfelt elegy to a vanishing Appalachia. Co-directors Lucas Sabean and Peter Hutchison stop by to talk about how this film started as an entirely different project and why the humanity and emotional rawness of the film’s subjects made it clear that they deserved to have a film built around their stories.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-8-2-24%20Sabean%20%26%20Hutchison%20-%20Devil%20Put%20Coal%20in%20the%20Ground.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: devilputthecoalintheground.com\n\nDevil Put the Coal in the Ground is currently streaming on VOD platforms including iTunes/Apple TV, and Grasshopper Films.\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Director/ Producer Peter Hutchison is an award-winning filmmaker, NY Times Bestselling author, educator & activist.

Everest a record ten times by the age of 48. Mountain Queenis must see so women everywhere can learn the only boundary or limitations one has are the ones placed on yourself.” – Carla Renata, The Curvy Film Critic\n\nHollywoodgate – Director Ibrahim Nash’at\n\nHOLLYWOODGATE chronicles a sliver of the larger picture around the take over by the Taliban when the United States withdrew from its twenty-year old “forever war” in Afghanistan. In the time since the Taliban have re-established their control over the ravaged country, they located and pillaged an American military base loaded with weaponry – a portion of the over $7 billion in U.S. armaments still in the country. Unprecedented and audacious, Hollywoodgate is the riveting result of the year director Ibrahim Nash’at spent with the Taliban in the wake of the United States withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Risking his life in the war-torn nation, Nash’at is on the ground with the Taliban when they enter an American base loaded with a portion of the billions dollars worth of U.S. armaments left behind. Driving towards an astonishing and chilling end, Nash’at tracks Taliban leaders as they attempt to transform from a fundamentalist militia into a modern military regime, employing Hollywood-style propaganda to achieve their goals. Director Ibrahim Nash’at (Under the Sky of Damascus) joins us for a conversation on how he gained the access to the Taliban leader, Mawlawi Mansour, why he decided to embark on this very dangerous project and what he hopes people will take away from his remarkable documentary, HOLLYWOODGATE.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-7-19-24%20Nash%27at%20-%20Hollywoodgate.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: curzon.com/hollywoodgate\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Ibrahim Nash’at is a multi-award-winning Egyptian documentary filmmaker based in Berlin, Germany.

Leah works for the publisher who will be releasing Shane’s debut novel, a lightly autobiographical examination of family trauma, alcoholism, and the immigrant experience. Tensions over family trauma would be enough kindling for a blowup, but Leah and Shane’s marriage is truly tested by the appearance of two weirdos with entrepreneurial zeal and a half-baked blackmail plot: John (John Speredakos) and Rose (Lorraine Farris). They’re looking for investors for John’s latest invention, a culinary breakthrough called the Crumb Catcher — and they won’t take no for an answer. A gonzo home invasion thriller from Larry Fessenden’s Glass Eye Pix that pummels the American Dream into just desserts, Crumb Catcher director, co-writer, co-producer and editor Chris Skotchdopole stops by to talk about how constructs and de-constructs his films, working with his collaborators, including cinematographer Adam Carboni and co-writers Rigo Garay and Larry Fessenden, and what’s next for him as a filmmaker.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-7-19-24%20Skotchdopole%20-%20Crumb%20Catcher.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: musicboxfilms.com/film/crumb-catcher\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Chris Skotchdopole is a writer, director and producer living in New York City.

Following the story’s publication, Louis C.K. admitted “these stories are true” and faced initial repercussions, only to return to the stage nine months later. While the story of C.K.’s rise and fall largely played out in public, this film reveals the stories of three women who spoke out over the years about C.K.’s behavior. Through candor and surprising humor, the documentary gives voice to the nuanced and complicated experiences of Jen Kirkman, Abby Schachner, and Megan Koester. It presents new details about their encounters with Louis C.K. and unveils the extent of the personal and professional consequences they faced for speaking out about it. SORRY / NOT SORRY directors Caroline Suh and Cara Mones shed new light on questions about sex and power in the workplace, who gets to take the stage, and the role the public plays in these stories at large. Featuring interviews with the reporters who broke the original story – Melena Ryzik, Cara Buckley, and Jodi Kantor – along with comedians, gatekeepers and critics including Michael Ian Black, Michael Schur, Aida Rodriguez, Andy Kindler, Noam Dworman, and Wesley Morris, the film leaves viewers contemplating: who is afforded a second chance, and who is overlooked in the process?\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-7-12-24%20Suh%20%26%20Mones%20-%20Sorry%20-%20Not%20Sorry.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: greenwichentertainment.com/sorry-not-sorry\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Director/Producer Caroline Suh is an independent documentary filmmaker, who has worked in film, television, and commercials.

But in the U.K., they faced a music business beset by prejudice against homegrown Black talent and were largely ignored. They originally split in 1975, but their music lived on, as successive generations of artists and fans found and embraced their songs. Hip Hop, House, Drum and Bass, R&B, Rare Groove, and crate-digging communities all saw something in the songs of Cymande that inspired them. Through insightful interviews with band members and influential figures including Mark Ronson, Laura Lee and Mark Speer (Khruangbin), DJ Maseo (De La Soul), Jazzie B (Soul II Soul), Cut Chemist, Jim James (My Morning Jacket), Louie Vega, and Kool DJ Red Alert, this stranger than fiction documentary explores the band’s profound impact and enduring legacy. Director Tim MacKenzie-Smith stops by to talk about his own introduction to the music of Cymande, designing the look and feel of the film to seen as a big screen communal experience, how the band members kept each others hope, music and spirit alive over the years, and the joy of seeing the band and their music get the recognition it deserves.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-7-26-24%20Mackenzie-Smith%20-%20Cymande.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: cymandeofficial.com/film\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Director / Producer Tim Mackenzie-Smith is an award-winning British filmmaker known primarily for sports documentaries, such as Keane & Vieira: Best Of Enemies, The Mavericks, Rooney: The Man Behind The Goals and The Trilogy: Fury v Wilder. A passionate Cymande fan, he has spent the last five years working on this film and is proud to bring their story to the world.\n\nCymande – In the racially turbulent UK of the early 70s, a group of black musicians came together in South London with a common love of rhythms and a message of peace. Cymande – with the dove as their symbol – combined jazz, funk, soul and Caribbean grooves to form a unique sound. Despite success in the USA they faced indifference in their native Britain, becoming disillusioned and disbanding. But the music lived on, as new generations of artists imbibed and reworked their pioneering sounds in fresh ways. From Soul II Soul to De La Soul, MC Solaar to The Fugees, the Dove had spread Cymande’s message far and wide, prompting their return after forty years. This is the story of guitarist Patrick Patterson, bass player Steve Scipio, drummer Sam Kelly, percussionist Pablo Gonsales, saxophonist Derrick Gibbs and flutist Mike ‘Bammi” Rose.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nfacebook.com/CymandeOnline\n\nfacebook.com/tim.mackenziesmith\n\nx.com/CymandeOfficial\n\nx.com/kennaTV\n\ninstagram.com/cymandeofficial\n\ninstagram.com/deadpankenna\n\n#cymande\n\n#gettingitbackthestoryofcymande\n\n#gettingitback\n\nReviews:\n\n“Above all else it shows how timeless their music is and it is hard to believe some of their music is over 50 years old, if nothing else the film will likely introduce them to a host of new fans across the generations.” – Christopher Connor, Flickering Myth\n\n“This documentary is an education and a good-news story about the remarkable 70s British funk band Cymande (the word is a calypso term for “dove”) who should be as big as Earth Wind & Fire, but aren’t.” – Peter Bradshaw, Guardian\n\n“The most striking moments of the film, however, remain the testimonies of the band members themselves: it is hard not to be moved seeing them interviewed now about their work, and celebrated by legions of fans of all ages.” – Elena Lazic, Cineuropa\n\n“Director Tim MacKenzie-Smith clearly has a lot of affection for the band. And so do we after watching his film.” – Rich Cline, Shadows on the Wall\n\nChampions of the Golden Valley – Director Ben Sturgulewski\n\nIn his riveting feature documentary CHAMPIONS OF THE GOLDEN VALLEY director Ben Sturgulewski peels back the social, religious and community layers in the remote mountain villages of Bamyan, Afghanistan, to find what has created the newfound passion for skiing. This passion has attracted young athletes from rival ethnic groups who showcase their resourcefulness and skill on the slopes. Equipped with minimal gear, makeshift skis, and no chairlift, the determined ski coach Alishah Farhang organizes a ski race that unities the community in a moment of joy and camaraderie. However, when their country falls to the Taliban, many of the skiers are displaced across the globe as refugees, confronted with an uncertain future. In CHAMPIONS OF THE GOLDEN VALLEY filmmaker Ben Sturgulewski masterfully captures the thrill of a sports rivalry intertwined with the poignant narrative of a community grappling with profound change – revealing what it means to be a champion, in all its forms. Director, editor and cinematographer Ben Sturgulewski joins us to talk about his own long journey, figuratively and literally, to tell this amazing story of community, loss, rivalry, friendship, and how striving to be better can not only lift up an individual, like Alishah Farhang, Alishah Farhang, Mujtaba Hussaini, Raees Hussaini, Haji Hussaini, Mortiza Motahari and Hussain Ali Nazari, but those around them.\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-6-17-24%20Sturgulewski%20-%20Champions.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: championsofthegoldenvalley.com\n\nAbout the filmmaker – Ben ‘Sturge’ Sturgulewski grew up on a rugged and remote island in Alaska’s Aleutian Chain, inspiring a life dedicated to the exploration of the world’s wild side, and the people who call it home.

Using a highly disputed technique Anna says she unlocked Derrick’s mind from his body by teaching him to communicate using a keyboard. In addition to Anna Stubblefield, we hear from Derrick’s brother John Johnson, their mother Daisy Johnson and a variety of academics and doctors who lend their perspective on the relationship and what follows from it. The relationship eventually leads to Anna’s arrest and a high profile criminal trial that would challenge our perceptions of disability and the nature of consent. Through exclusive footage and interviews with those on both sides of the case, the film weaves a riveting and endlessly nuanced story about communications, race and sex.

When five Howard University students sat on a Maryland carousel in 1960, the arrests made headlines. When the white community near Glen Echo Amusement Park joined the Black students in picketing, an extraordinary history-making partnership was born. The pickets attracted Nazis, Congressman, and a press avalanche. Picketing together over the sweltering summer led to partying together, and union organizers mentored student activists. Ten 1961 Freedom Riders, including Stokely Carmichael, were incubated on the Glen Echo picket line, and the carousel arrests were challenged in the Supreme Court case. With never-before seen footage, and immersive storytelling by Emmy-award winning director Ilana Trachtman (Praying with Lior, Black in Latin America, The Pursuit), four living protesters rescue this forgotten history, revealing the price, and the power, of heeding the impulse to activism.

It was once a bustling Palestinian town until it was conquered when the State of Israel was established in 1948. As the film unfolds, a chorus of characters creates a tapestry of the Palestinian experience of this city and the trauma left by the massacre and expulsion, while vivid animations envision an alternate reality where the same characters live free from the trauma of the past and the violence of the present. Using never-before-seen archival footage of the Israeli soldiers who carried out the massacre and expulsion, the personified city explains that these events were so devastating that they fractured reality, and now there are two Lyds — one occupied and one free. As the film cuts between fantastical and documentary realities, it ultimately leaves the viewer questioning which future should prevail. Lyd dares to ask the question: what would the city be like had the Israeli occupation of Lyd never happened? Co-directors Rami Younis and Sarah Ema Friedland join us for a wide ranging conversation on the utterly fascinating and pivotal role that the city of Lyd has played in the multiple empires, ancient and modern, the establishment of the state of Israel, the forced expulsion of Palestinians during Nakba and the provocative question at the heart of the film… What if?\n\nhttp://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/FS-6-21-24%20Younis%20%26%20Friedland%20-%20LYD.mp3\n\nDownload MP3 Podcast | Open Player in New Window\n\nFor more go to: icarusfilms.com/if-lyd\n\nFor more about the filmmakers go to: lydinexile.com\n\nFor Los Angeles area screenings go to: laemmle.com/lyd\n\nAll other screenings: Go to: icarusfilms.com/playdate#lyd\n\nLYD premiered at the 2023 Amman International Film Festival where it won the Jury Prize for Best Documentary and the FIPRESCI prize from the International Critics Association.\n\nAbout the Filmmaker – Director and Cinematographer Sarah Ema Friedland is an NYC-based media artist and educator.
