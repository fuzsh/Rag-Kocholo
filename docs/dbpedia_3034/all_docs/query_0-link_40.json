        "text": "Projects with partial financing in place are welcome and encouraged to apply. Selected films must be able to offer equity terms pari passu with any committed funding to date in order to align with the Catalyst program and investor community.\n\nNote that we don’t invite projects with budget gaps under $250,000 USD to apply to Catalyst. Participating films frequently accept funding from multiple partners, which is an intentional structure and promise to the investors.\n\nProjects that have had substantial exposure within or beyond the Catalyst investor community are less compelling prospects for us, even if they still have a large gap. Widely exposed films have difficulty unlocking funding from our group.\n\nThe Catalyst preparations process is rigorous and highly collaborative. We assign each team an advisor who joins all weekly calls, and we offer extensive notes on project presentations, decks, budgets, business plans, and other written and visual materials. We additionally invite a pro bono lawyer to review each film’s financial materials and also offer guidance and resources on building successful investor relationships.\n\nThe Forum itself is a busy three days of film presentations, individually scheduled meetings, and informal social moments where funders and filmmakers connect to build partnerships and materially advance the projects.\n\nWe remain engaged with filmmakers who participate in Catalyst well beyond the Forum dates. We work closely with our active fellows as they turn Catalyst investor interest into commitment on the heels of the program but also support our alumni throughout their progress to editing and distribution.\n\nWe require the full team in place in order to apply because producers and directors are both integral to the financing process. We are looking for teams with solid creative and strategic partnership who have a clear understanding of their collaboration.\n\nThe aim of the producer feature requirement is to make sure that someone on the project has strong financing and production experience so that the film is set up for success at Catalyst. During our prep period prior to Forum, we expect producers to engage in detailed conversations around budgeting, physical production plans, deal structuring, and financing expectations.\n\nAs you can imagine, complex financing scenarios arise at the Forum given the variety of funders we engage: Catalyst investors range in experience, capacities, and preferred types of investment. The producers’ expertise, sense of business and strategic sensibility is crucial to the negotiating process and to set the project up for success at Catalyst.\n\nIndependent film financing in a program like Catalyst is as much about the people behind the film or the funding as the work itself, so the team and its dynamics are a crucial part of succeeding in this program.\n\nWe require a visual sample from your current project as part of the Catalyst nonfiction application. We want to see footage that will give us a sense of what the film might feel like. It’s important to us that the sample conveys a sense of the film’s style and artistic vision as well as the level of access you have to your subjects and that the story/subject can sustain a compelling feature-length film.\n\nFor the above reasons, we prefer scenes over teasers and trailers. We also ask that the total sample runtime not exceed approximately 5 minutes, though this is not a hard cap.\n\nWe are looking for projects with strong artistic visions that have solid teams behind them. Producing experience levels may vary but an interest in independent financing and a plan to get the film through production and to distribution are key. Alignment of vision and a strong partnership between director and producer is a must. We’re evaluating the teams as much as we are the films since independent financing decisions are as much about the filmmaking teams as the work itself and the focus of Catalyst is the partnership between funder and filmmaker. We frequently invite first-time directors, but it’s important to us that the producers on Catalyst projects are capable of working with independent funding models, especially since the financing scenarios that result from the Forum may be composed of multiple minority funders seeking to participate in the same project. To this end, it’s also key that the film team wants to work with individual financiers and that an independent financing model serves the project. So the ‘why Catalyst’ components of each application need to be clear.\n\nCatalyst has a unique opportunity to lift up artists and stories that come from outside of the mainstream that might not easily get funding from typical Hollywood sources. So while each team’s credentials will be key in assessing their applications, we also consider what kinds of films and filmmakers need an independent venue like Catalyst to materially advance. The Catalyst program invests in the careers of the filmmakers—introducing teams into the world of independent film financing—as much as it invests in the films themselves.\n\nUltimately, we want our slate to range in subject, style, and perspective—both so that the films represent a sample of the year in independent film and also so that the projects we invite aren’t competing with each other at the Forum. We’re not looking for any specific genre or topic—we want a diversity of projects that each have unique sensibilities and points of view. We also want to preserve both a sense of discovery and exceptionalism at Catalyst, mixing emerging talent with the most compelling new projects from established independent filmmakers."
