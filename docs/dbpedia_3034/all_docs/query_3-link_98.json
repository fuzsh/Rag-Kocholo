        "text": "It stands to reason that, in The Godfather (which, put plainly, is a film about Italians), there features some truly wonderful depictions of great Italian food cooking.\n\nIt’s Clemenza, the caporegime of the Carleone family, who gets the best of these scenes, his most iconic line being “leave the gun, take the cannoli” after successfully completing a hit. After all, a hit man can still be a family man, and if the wife wants cannoli, the wife gets cannoli.\n\nIn my favourite scene, we find Clemenza working away in the kitchen, cooking up a rich, hearty sausage meatball and tomato sauce. He pulls Michael — the youngest son of the Carleone patriarch — in, and says to him: “Come over ‘ere, kid. Learn something. You never know, you might have to cook for 20 guys some day.”\n\nIt’s by no means a complicated recipe — tomato, sausage, garlic, oil and a splash of red wine — but I think this is what makes it so fundamentally faultless; it offers that sense of comforting fullness that only a dish like spaghetti and meatballs has.\n\nI love cooking Italian food at home anyway, so could hardly pass on the opportunity to whip up Clemenza’s famous recipe. I found a brilliant one on The Little Library Cafe, but substituted half the mince for sausage meat, to keep it semi-authentic to the movie.\n\nTo make 4 servings of Clemenza’s Meatballs, you’ll need the following:\n\n4 good-quality pork sausages\n\n250g beef mince\n\n3 tbsp soft breadcrumbs\n\n4 stalks of flat-leaf parsley, chopped\n\n1 tbsp of olive oil\n\n3 tbsp plain flour\n\nSalt and pepper (for seasoning the meatballs and sauce)\n\n1 garlic cloves, finely chopped\n\n1 egg\n\n400g tin of chopped tomatoes\n\n2 tbsp tomato purée\n\n125ml dry red wine\n\n1tsp sugar\n\n300g spaghetti\n\nParmesan cheese (to sprinkle on top)\n\nFresh basil, chopped (to sprinkle on top)\n\nRecipe\n\nSqueeze the sausage meat out of their skins, and add to a large bowl. Add the mince and combine the meat together into one solid lump with your hands.\n\nAdd the chopped parsley, garlic, egg, breadcrumbs, salt, pepper and wine to the bowl, and combine. The mixture should be sticky, but not wet. Add more breadcrumbs if it’s too wet, and a splash of wine if it’s too dry. Cover and refrigerate for an hour.\n\nOnce the meat mixture has been chilled, prepare a plate or roasting tray and sprinkle on the flour. Shape the meatballs with a dessert spoon, and coat in the flour.\n\nHeat the oil in a pan, and fry the meatballs for 1 minute on each side. Set the meatballs aside.\n\nTo make the sauce, add a splash of oil to a clean pan and throw in the tin of chopped tomatoes. Stir until bubbling, then add the tomato purée and a pinch of salt.\n\nTurn down the heat and simmer until the sauce is thick. Add the meatballs, stir to coat them in the sauce and leave on a low heat while you cook the pasta.\n\nFill a large saucepan with water and a dash of salt, and bring to the boil. Cook the pasta until al dente (check the cooking instructions on the packet). Reserve a mug of pasta water and drain.\n\nAdd the spaghetti to the tomato sauce and stir through; use some of the pasta water to lubricate the pasta if needed.\n\nServe immediately, and sprinkle the fresh basil and Parmesan on the top."
