        "text": "58 percent of forests in Afrin (Efrîn) have been lost since Turkey took control of the northwest Syrian region in 2018, according to a report released last week by a Netherlands-based peace organisation, PAX.\n\nThe in-depth scientific study by the Dutch peace initiative, based on satellite analysis and open-source research, highlights conflict-linked tree loss in Syria between 2018 and 2020. Unregulated logging affected over 36 percent of western forested areas, as well as nearly 60 percent in the north where armed groups were a main driver for the heavy logging of natural forests, said PAX.\n\nAfter Turkey launched Operation Olive Branch in 2018, the Kurdish region of Afrin had one of the highest rates of forest loss in Syria, the research shows. During the cross- border military operation, the Turkish Armed Forces and factions known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) took control of the Afrin region and drove out the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG).\n\nThe intense forest loss in Afrin was caused by Turkish-backed militants engaging in the lumber trade, the Turkish Armed Forces logging for the construction of outposts, and an influx of internally displaced persons from other areas who needed a supply of wood, according to PAX.\n\nThe Turkish military cut down hundreds of trees in the process of outpost construction amidst orchards, for fire-line clearance and as a building material for the bases.\n\nIncoming internally displaced persons were resettled in woodlands, and they cut down the trees for firewood and housing. As a result, a small park overlooking the city of Afrin largely disappeared. The settlers were Kurdish civilians, displaced by the incursion of Turkish-backed rebels into the region.\n\nThe findings clearly show that in Afrin, deforestation had intensified by 2020. Between 2018 and 2021, 43 percent of the Afrin region was deforested.\n\nVarious militias have been involved in the logging, sales and export of lumber from Afrin and the surrounding countryside since the area came under the control of Turkish-backed Syrian factions, said the report, entitled ‘Axed and Burned’. By October 2021, 58 percent of forest cover had been affected by cutting and land clearing.\n\nOver the last seven years, two areas in particular have seen dramatic deforestation levels: Jabal al Kurd, a mountain range on the border with Turkey, and Barsaya, a mountain range northwest of the city, the research identified.\n\nPAX stressed that international institutions must make a coordinated plan to tackle forest loss in war-stricken Syria and highlighted that living conditions and socio-economic prospects in the country are worsened by the conflict-linked environmental degradation.\n\nSource: Medya News\n\nFeatured image caption: Not indicated.\n\nCaption image 1: The Turkish military cut down hundreds of trees in the process of outpost construction amidst orchards.\n\nCaption image 2: Incoming internally displaced persons were resettled in woodlands, and they cut down the trees for firewood and housing\n\nby Robert Postings March 28, 2023 in Politics & Foreign Affairs\n\nSyria’s forests have been another casualty in the 12 years of war that has gripped the country according to a new report. The destruction of natural resources and damage to ecosystems has potentially severe consequences for the lives, livelihoods and future of Syrian citizens — as well as for the country’s climate resilience.\n\nThe “Axed and Burned” report is produced by Pax for Peace, a Netherlands-based organisation dedicated to protecting civilians against acts of war, to ending armed violence and to building inclusive peace. The report was based on satellite analysis and open-source research.\n\nSpeaking to Impakter, one of the report’s authors Wim Zwijnenburg expressed how devastating the loss of forests has been:\n\n“The 12-year war had grave consequences for the last remaining forests in Syria and communities depending on them.”\n\nSince peaceful protests against Syria’s dictator President Bashar Hafez al-Assad in 2011 were met with violence and the country spiralled into civil war, an estimated 306,000 civilians have been killed and 13 million are displaced.\n\nAs well as the terrible human suffering, Syria has faced awful ecological and environmental consequences. One particularly alarming is the loss of forest cover caused by the war.\n\nSyria’s coastal western provinces contained much of the country’s natural forests, while in the north-western Idlib and Aleppo provinces there were large olive and fruit orchids. Over the course of the war all these areas have lost massive amounts of tree cover due to increasing energy prices, bombing, wildfires, and the war economy.\n\nAccording to the report, from 2011 to 2021 the governorates of Latakia, Hama, Homs and Idlib lost 45,320 hectares of tree cover — more than 36%. There was a rapid increase in deforestation in 2020 and 2021. Some of these areas are controlled by the Syrian government, others by various rebel groups.\n\nIn Idlib, which is primarily rebel-controlled, some of the destruction was due to clearing forests to make room for internally displaced people to live.\n\nThe Afrin region of Northern Aleppo, a Kurdish area that for much of the war was controlled by the Kurdish YPG independent from the government or rebels, also saw massive deforestation. Afrin was famous for its olive trees, but since being captured by the rebel Syrian National Army backed by Turkey in Operation Olive Branch in 2018, huge swathes have been cut down.\n\nAnalysis for the report shows that in the Kurd mountains area of Afrin, 56% of the 4,750 hectares of forest cover was lost between December 2015 and 2021.\n\nIn the mount Basra area, over 59% was cut down. In some areas entire forests were felled in their entirety.\n\nLocal reporting suggests that some of the various rebel groups that are part of the Turkish-backed SNA are involved in the logging and sale of trees, with a rapid increase in deforestation after rebel factions took control of the area.\n\nPoverty has also been a major factor. With 90% of people living below the poverty line and the Syrian pound losing approximately 98% of its value, charcoal and firewood have become an essential lifeline for those who cannot afford alternative fuels or as a way to make a living.\n\n“In the west and northwest of Syria, massive amounts of trees were logged for firewood or charcoals, leaving complete mountains barren,” Zwijnenburg tells us.\n\nThe cost of firewood has risen from 6,000 Syrian Pounds per ton pre-war to reportedly around one million by 2022, making it lucrative for individuals, criminals, or militias.\n\nForest fires — caused by arson, natural reasons, or conflict — as well as military operations and the widespread breakdown in governance after years of war have all also contributed to the loss.\n\nIn Idlib and Aleppo forests have been cleared to allow room for settlements of internally displaced people.\n\nRural areas were not alone in forest loss. The fighting and sieges in cities across Syria that caused so much death and destruction also affected urban forests, with trees destroyed by fighting or cut down by residents who needed fuel that was unavailable to them.\n\nAs Zwijnenburg explains, “[t]he environmental impacts of conflict have direct and long-term consequences for civilians and ecosystems they depend on.”\n\nForest ecosystems play a critical role for local communities and society. While wood itself and agricultural products are essential for livelihoods, beyond this, forests have essential ecological benefits. They provide watershed protection, such as moderating flooding and preventing erosion, as well as helping to mitigate climate change and preserve Syria’s biodiversity.\n\nThe effect on agriculture is certain to worsen Syria’s current food insecurity and the livelihoods of orchard farmers. In urban areas in particular the loss of trees will also worsen air quality.\n\nWim Zwijnenburg, Pax for Peace researcher and one of the report’s authors, finds that better research on the environmental effects of war can have a positive impact. He hopes that “through better analysis with remote sensing and open-source investigations of specific impacts, the international community and relevant authorities can prepare faster and more efficient responses that will help prevent, minimize and mitigate these environmental consequences.”\n\n“This can help communities to work on rebuilding their lives in a healthy environment,” Zwijnenburg asserts.\n\nSource: Impakter\n\nCaption: © OCHA/Halldorsson\n\nBy Elizabeth Zach\n\nIn the region just an hour’s drive southeast of Beirut, Karem Monzer grew up amid a virgin forest of oak, olive and cedar trees stretching across hills to the horizon. Here in the village of Gharifeh, on the slopes of Mount Lebanon, there are fewer than 10,000 residents, just two schools – one private, one public – and the region is known for its olive oil, which the Romans originally cultivated.\n\nYet this pastoral existence is threatened by Lebanon’s changing climate. Fires have ripped through both countryside and nearby urban areas and water supplies for both residents and farmers are in constant peril, as is appropriate disposal of waste and wastewater.\n\nAs a university student, Karem quickly realized that in a country like Lebanon – which in 2019 was in the throes of revolution and is today sinking under the weight of economic and political dysfunction – there would never be a shortage of stories to find and tell. Upon completing studies in film, media, communication arts and journalism, he produced videos, including on Syrian refugees and, last year, he reported on world hunger from COP27 in Egypt. He works for Beirut Today, an independent news outlet.\n\nSeeing the underlying problem: climate change\n\n“I think it was at COP27 that I saw there was even more I could report on,” he said. “I was interviewing World Health Organization managers, and people with the International Red Cross, and I could see that hunger related to bigger problems, namely climate change.”\n\nShortly later, Karem, now 27, heard about a series of journalism courses that would help him decipher and report on those bigger problems. This month, he joined other young journalists in Beirut for lectures and hands-on instruction by climate scientists in Lebanon’s new – and so far only – environmental journalism training in Arabic.\n\nThe class, funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) under its GKI crisis initiative and organized by DW Akademie, allows young journalists to learn both science coverage basics and how best to reach readers and viewers across multimedia platforms. Participants spend time on key local issues, such as air pollution, waste, sewage and land use. They practice with targeted online searches, fact-checking and understanding data. Their work is ultimately destined for Lebanese media.\n\n“When we started training in science journalism in Lebanon in 2021,” said Audrey Parmentier, DW Akademie project manager in the Middle East and North Africa for media development, “it became very clear that journalists needed more specific knowledge on reporting about climate change.”\n\nUnderstanding – and explaining – climate change\n\nShe and her colleagues therefore called on journalists and students, as well as scientists, academics, editors-in-chief and Lebanese citizens to brainstorm. Not only, she added, was an effective curriculum a goal but rather to broaden the reporting and job skills of younger journalists and teach them how to both understand and explain the many environmental threats out there.\n\n“Environmental topics are still underrepresented in the Lebanese media and in public discourse,” she said, noting that qualified young media professionals can have better access to jobs when they are skilled in explaining complex topics such as climate change.\n\n“With the skills and fundamentals we offer,” she said, “we want to improve the circumstances of starting a career. Both journalism and scientific skills are greatly in demand in newsrooms.”\n\nReporting on how climate change affects life\n\nFeryal Dakkak, age 22, said she knew that by enrolling in the courses, she would learn skills she didn’t, or couldn’t, while at university, where she majored in broadcast journalism on a research track. She is a freelance journalist, video editor and marketing manager in Dubai.\n\n“From sourcing to fact-checking and now mobile journalism,” she listed from among the courses topics. “As you know, college courses are always more theoretical than practical.”\n\nShe added that she is less compelled to report on Lebanese politics and is more drawn toward drawing the connection between climate change and life in Lebanon itself. In the courses, her focus is on unregulated tree felling for economic benefit in Lebanon.\n\n“It is crucial to be able to explain how human activity contributes to problems like deforestation and biodiversity loss,” Feryal said.\n\nMeanwhile, Karem’s project looks at solar panel waste after the battery dies.\n\n“Lebanon’s solar revolution came out of severe power cuts,” he explained. “People were eager for decentralized, private and independent solar solutions. This included Chinese, Indian and Turkish acid-based batteries, with a five-year life, alongside lithium batteries that last up to 10 years. What happens when they die, though? How can Lebanon address this?”\n\nIt makes him think about his childhood home near Mount Lebanon changing, perhaps irreversibly.\n\n“It’s one of the most beautiful areas in Lebanon,” he said. “But the forest fires and deforestation and loss of water […] these are problems that I can see. It’s not just something I’m learning [about], and it’s not fake. And if I think concretely about alternative energy, like solar panels, so that people don’t have to cut trees for wood, and about recycling wastewater rather than the general idea of carbon emissions – constructive ideas – then I’m motivated to report that.”\n\nSource: Akademie\n\nCaption1: Karem Monzer, a Lebanese journalist, has reported on world hunger and politics. He’s now participating in climate journalism courses where he is reporting on clean disposal of solar batteries.\n\nCaption2: In the climate journalism courses, the first of their kind in Lebanon, Feryal Dakkak is learning practical tools for science reporting that she says she could not learn in a standard journalism curriculum.\n\nBy Daniel Dawson Dec. 12, 2022 14:56 UTC\n\nThe 2022 olive harvest is in full swing in the northern hemisphere and has been full of surprises.\n\nWestern European and North African countries that suffered from record-breaking droughts and sweltering heatwaves all have reported substantial production declines.\n\nMeanwhile, producers in the Middle East are reporting record-high or near-record harvests, partially attributed to plentiful rainfall at timely moments during olive tree development and mild spring and autumn temperatures.\n\nEasily the biggest surprises of the harvest come from Turkey and Spain. Officials anticipate a record-smashing 400,000-ton harvest in the former, while the latter is set for its lowest harvest in nearly a decade.\n\nAlong with eclipsing previous records, this harvest temporarily places Turkey as the second-largest olive oil-producing country behind Spain.\n\nHowever, Turkey is far from the only country in the Eastern Mediterranean anticipating a bumper crop. Producers in Greece, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria expect bountiful harvests.\n\nConversely, on the western end of the basin, producers in Algeria, France, Italy, Morocco, Portugal and Tunisia are similarly bracing for poor harvests.\n\nHarvest estimates for the 2022/23 crop year analyzed by Olive Oil Times indicate that production in the Western Mediterranean will be significantly lower than last year and well below the rolling five-year average.\n\nOlive Oil Times estimates that these six countries in the Western Mediterranean might combine to produce 1.46 million tons of olive oil this year, well below the 2.32 million tons produced by the same bloc in 2021/22 and the 2.27-million-ton rolling five-year average.\n\nOn the other hand, five countries in the Eastern Mediterranean – Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria (the latest figures for Israel and Palestine were unavailable at the time of writing) – might combine to produce 881,000 tons in the current crop year.\n\nConversely, this figure significantly exceeds the 602,000 tons produced in the last crop year and the rolling five-year average of 648,300 tons.\n\nWhile it may be tempting to conclude that the center of gravity in the olive-growing world is moving east, the reality is a bit more complex.\n\nExperts who monitor global olive oil production believe that this year’s bumper crops across the Eastern Mediterranean and the substantial drop in the west is partially coincidental and partly the result of this year’s unusual climate.\n\nThe mild and wet weather in the Eastern Mediterranean that many growers credit with helping olive trees produce abundant fruit is widely considered an anomaly. Overall, the average annual temperature in the Middle East is rising twice as fast as the global average.\n\nAccording to research from the Italian Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Development (ENEA), a 1.8 ºC increase in average global temperatures above the pre-industrial average would result in substantial decreases in Middle Eastern and North African olive production from 2041 to 2050 relative to the 1961 to 1970 average.\n\nOn the other hand, production in Turkey and Europe would be far less affected, with some countries projected to experience steady production or even slight increases based on a 1.8 ºC temperature rise scenario.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWater stress is also expected to become worse across the Middle East. According to the World Resources Institute, Israel, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan are among the six most water-stressed countries and states on Earth.\n\nMany other major Mediterranean olive oil-producing countries are also expected to experience high, though less extreme, levels of water stress.\n\nWhile olive oil production in Israel, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria is likely to regress to the mean next year when a number of the olive groves in these countries enter an ‘off-year’ in the alternate bearing cycle of the olive tree, Turkey will likely sustain its upward production trend.\n\nExperts partially attributed the country’s record-breaking harvest to sustained efforts to plant 68 to 96 million trees since 2007. This year was the first in which many of these trees entered maturity.\n\nIn the Western Mediterranean, temperatures also are expected to rise faster than the global average.\n\nExorbitantly high temperatures across Western Mediterranean olive groves in May and June damaged some trees during the blossoming phase, resulting in lower fruition levels.\n\nThe hot spring was followed by sustained drought. Europe experienced its most severe drought of the past 500 years. Growers in North Africa experienced a similar situation.\n\nFurthermore, water shortages compounded the impacts of the drought and forced many trees to drop or desiccate their olives to save water.\n\nHowever, meteorologists at AccuWeather, a weather data and technology company, predicted that Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and the Balkan Peninsula would all receive plenty of rain and snow this winter.\n\nWhile the precipitation is unlikely to eliminate the water deficits created by the drought, olive trees and growers may be in a better position to cope with another hot and dry summer than they were after the abnormally dry winter and spring experienced this year.\n\nAway from the climate, the type of olive groves predominant in each country is also expected to impact production figures.\n\nWestern Mediterranean countries, including Portugal and Algeria, are expected to see production rise steadily in the long run due to efforts to plant more trees at higher densities.\n\nHigh-density (intensive) and super-high-density (super-intensive) olive groves lower production costs and, when managed well, mitigate the impacts of the natural alternate bearing cycle of the olive tree due to consistent pruning and a steady stream of fertigation at the most critical points in tree and drupe development.\n\nAs a result, countries with higher percentages of these groves are likely to see steady production increases with fewer climate-related dips and limited effects from ‘off-years.’\n\nThe aforementioned ENEA research also indicated that countries with high-density and super-high-density olive groves would see limited production decreases or even modest increases with 1.8 ºC of warming.\n\nProduction will likely continue to rise steadily in many Western Mediterranean countries where these types of olive groves are more common.\n\nIn the Eastern Mediterranean, Turkey and Egypt (where harvest data was also unavailable for 2022) are the main countries growing olive trees intensively on a large scale.\n\nWhile Turkey is the exception to long-term olive oil production trends in the Eastern Mediterranean, Italy is similarly an anomaly to Westen Mediterranean production trends.\n\nThe unabated spread of Xylella fastidiosa, a deadly olive tree bacteria, and a growing emphasis on quality over quantity have changed the country’s fundamental production paradigm.\n\nProduction is likely to recover from this year’s meager yield but is unlikely to reach the heights of the early 2000s when 600,000 tons of olive oil production was the norm.\n\nBased on the prevailing climatic and agricultural trends, the outsized role of Eastern Mediterranean olive oil production compared to the Western Mediterranean appears to be an anomaly in 2022/23.\n\nIndeed, some experts anticipate that organic and traditional olive groves will steadily move north as North Africa and Southern Europe become hotter and drier.\n\nWith the heads of France’s leading champagne houses buying land in the south of England, it may not be long before leading olive oil producers begin to follow suit.\n\nSource: Olive Oil Times\n\nCaption: Not indicated.\n\nThe first event on Grazed Woodlands (LL2) took place at Hotel Le Royal Dbayeh on the 5th of October, 2022. This event was organized by the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute (LARI) with the support of the Regional Forest Agency for Land and Environment of Sardinia (Forestas).\n\nThe objectives of the B2B (https://www.livingagrolab.eu/event/innovations-for-grazed-woodlands/) event were:\n\n– Connecting innovators with stakeholders in the grazed woodland sector to work on solutions for their problems;\n\n– Matching demands/requests for innovations;\n\n– Releasing and disseminating of a catalogue of available innovations;\n\n– Introducing innovations in the grazed woodlands and agroforestry sectors to producers, cooperatives, agricultural enterprises, company representatives, and other interested stakeholders;\n\n– Laying the foundations for future innovation projects by providing an opportunity for businesses, associations, research institutions, policy makers and other professionals in agriculture and food production to meet;\n\n– Allowing the establishment of new contacts and the sharing of information on innovative ideas, machinery, techniques and services.\n\nDuring this event, on-site and online innovations were presented by a professional panel of local and foreign speakers, revolving around the latest scientific research and innovations related to grazed woodlands that contribute to the development of the sector.\n\nThe main topics of the event included adaptive grazing management; reconciling grazing with trees; seed mixtures for quality pasture; shade tolerant species that could be used in grazed woodlands; remote sensing techniques to monitor oak forests; thinning and pruning trees in silvopastoral systems; land imprinter for rangelands rehabilitation coupled with rangeland species seeder; and, hydroponic system to produce fodder.\n\nIn the afternoon, two round tables were organized. The first one related to grazed woodlands where there was space of conversation and discussion between speakers and participants who had the chance to share, with their perspectives, experiences and point of views, to enrich an open debate on several issues ranging from the problems on land ownership to the serious environmental issues concerning climate change. The second round table was related to forest management; where, the active participation of the attendees also continued and other concerns and issues came up from the participants among which the Lebanese laws governing the forest sector in general and those related to grazing in the Lebanese forests.\n\nThe audience conducted the discussion on several problems that affect nowadays all the actors involved in Lebanon, from the farmers to the policy makers.\n\nThere have been 61 registrations through the online form; 16 of which for online participation and the other 45 for onsite participation. The English live streaming reached 85 viewers and the Arabic one reached 69 viewers including farmers, entrepreneurs, local administrators, researchers, private companies, policy makers and multiple stakeholders interested in agroforestry in the field of grazed woodlands.\n\nJoin the ICT platform at the following link www.livingagrolab.eu to register to the living labs on agroforestry.\n\nWith the aim of supporting farmers, entrepreneurs, local administrators, researchers, private companies, policy makers and stakeholders in Lebanon interested in agroforestry issues, especially in the field of grazed woodlands, the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute (LARI) held the B2B event “Innovations for grazed woodlands”, at the Hotel Le Royal Dbayeh in Beirut, Lebanon. This event was organized in collaboration with the Forest Agency for Land and Environment of Sardinia (FoReSTAS) and planned in the framework of the project “Cross Border Living Laboratories for Agroforestry – LIVINGAGRO”, co-funded by the European Union through the ENI CBC Med Programme.\n\nThis one-day business-to-business event aimed at supporting education, research and development, innovation, technology transfer as well as publishing and marketing of research results, offering a major opportunity for farmers, entrepreneurs, local administrators, researchers, private companies and policy makers interested in agroforestry issues, especially in the field of grazed woodlands in Lebanon, to set the framework for a long-term constructive cooperation among stakeholders.\n\nIn a meeting on the sidelines of the workshop, the manager of the LIVINGAGRO project on behalf of LARI, agricultural engineer Dr. Peter Moubarak, stated that work on this project has been underway for three years, with one more year left to complete the phase related to the Middle East region and Southern Europe. Dr. Moubarak pointed out to the existing cooperation between stakeholders aiming to design and implement state-of-the-art innovations as well as technology transfer, and publishing and marketing of research results, which includes agroforestry issues especially in the field of grazed woodlands alongside matters related to the olive cultivation as an essential part of the project.\n\nRegarding cooperation prospects with interested stakeholders, Dr. Moubarak confirmed the collaboration with related ministries and research centers, highlighting several agreements signed with private universities, including the Saint Joseph University, LIU University and the Lebanese University as part of the project, in addition to cooperation with the municipalities. Dr. Moubarak concluded by stressing on the fact that the main goal of the project is to create a network of stakeholders interested in agroforestry sector which would strengthen cooperation frameworks with foreign parties as well as improve production, inviting farmers and stakeholders to visit the site of the project, where they can benefit from shared insights and experiences on different topics and innovations related to agroforestry that contribute to the development of the sector. Dr. Moubarak confirmed that preparations are in progress for a third workshop that will be organized soon.\n\nAgricultural engineer Georges Hassoun, a specialist in food processing, also praised the importance of this project especially in terms of classification and production quality, hoping to achieve positive outcomes.\n\nAgricultural engineer Imad Hamza, a former professor at the American University, emphasized the importance of the workshop in tackling the topic of grazed woodlands and agroforestry, which is rarely raised despite its great significance, and aspired for the implementation of practical research.\n\nMr. Rony Francis, President of the Bchaaleh Agricultural Cooperative, expressed his appreciation of the workshop’s organization in general, underscoring the importance of the topics raised, especially regarding the ways Lebanese farmers can benefit from the expertise of their European counterparts. Mr. Francis also stated that the anticipated results depend on the personal diligence of each farmer.\n\nStressing on the importance of collective work to develop agriculture and protect forests and grazed woodlands in Lebanon, agricultural engineer Sophie Mansour, a specialist in agroforestry, regarded the exchange of knowledge and research between the participating countries as an advantage for their mutual sustainable development.\n\nAlso commenting on the conference, Italian agricultural engineer Dr. Antonello Franca highlighted the importance of exchanging experiences and sharing insights among the participants to benefit from their mutual experiences in order to develop their agricultural work, especially since they come from different countries and environments. “It’s an opportunity for us to study how climate change is affecting grazed woodlands, and we also need to further develop our work to face the decrease of the agroforestry fields”, he added. Dr. Franca emphasized that the advantage of the conference is to organize and benefit from mutual experiences, in addition to identify new innovations that can be implemented to improve agriculture in grazed woodlands. Dr. Franca is a researcher at the National Research Council in Italy and a member at the Institute for Institute for Animal Production System in Mediterranean Environment ISPAAM in Sardinia, he works as well for the LIVINGAGRO project studying the impact of grazing on the grazed woodlands in the Mediterranean region.\n\nBy AFP – Sep 18,2022 – Last updated at Sep 18,2022\n\nDJEBBA, Tunisia — High in the hills of north-western Tunisia, farmers are tending thousands of fig trees with a unique system of terracing they hope will protect them from ever-harsher droughts.\n\nBut the “hanging gardens” of Djebba El Olia have been put to the test this year as the North African country sweltered through its hottest July since the 1950s.\n\nThat has exacerbated a long drought that has left Tunisia’s reservoirs at just a third of their capacity.\n\nThe gardens are supplied with water from two springs high in the mountains.\n\nThe water is fed into the orchards by a network of canals that are opened and shut at set times, according to the size of the orchard.\n\nCrucially, a wide variety of crops provides resilience and in-built pest control, unlike the monocultures that dominate modern agriculture and require huge inputs of pesticides to survive.\n\n“We grow figs but also other trees like quinces, olives and pomegranates, and beneath them we plant a wide range of greens and legumes,” said activist Farida Djebbi as insects buzzed between thyme, mint and rosemary flowers.\n\nDjebbi pointed out some of the channels, which irrigate the area’s 300 hectares of steeply sloping orchards.\n\nIn 2020, the Food and Agriculture Organisation recognised the system as an example of “innovative and resilient agroforestry”, adding it to an elite list of just 67 “Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems”.\n\nThe system “has been able to adapt and take advantage of an inhospitable topography”, the UN agency said.\n\n“Through the use of natural geological formations and the use of stones, local communities have been able to transform the landscape into fertile and productive lands.”\n\nThe FAO praised the diversity of local crop varieties grown by the area’s farmers, as well as their use of wild plants to repel potential pests and of livestock to “plough” and fertilise the soil.\n\nGrowing up with figs\n\nWhile nobody knows exactly how old the system is, human habitation in the area predates the Carthaginian civilisation founded in the ninth century BC.\n\nBut while it may have endured for generations, the system is under threat as climate change kicks in.\n\nActivist Tawfiq El Rajehi, 60, says the flow of water from springs irrigating the area has dropped off noticeably, particularly in the past two years.\n\nUnlike in previous years, the surrounding peaks no longer get covered in snow each winter, and the leaves of many of the trees in the lower part of Djebba are yellowing and sick.\n\nRajehi, a teacher at the local school, said climate change and low rainfall were compounded by another factor: farmers favouring cash crops.\n\n“Some farmers have moved to growing more figs instead of less water-intensive crops because figs have become more profitable in recent years,” he said.\n\n“We need to keep a good balance and variety of plants.”\n\nNevertheless, residents say they are proud of their heritage.\n\nFarmer Lotfi El Zarmani, 52, said there was also growing demand for Djebba figs, which were given a protected designation of origin by the agriculture ministry in 2012 — still the only Tunisian fruit to enjoy the certification.\n\n“They’re getting a reputation, plus exporting them has become easier, plus they bring higher prices,” Zarmani said, adding that most exports go to the Gulf or neighbouring Libya.\n\nRajehi’s daughter, university student Chaima, put on protective gloves as she set out to harvest the fruit from her family’s small lot.\n\n“Figs are more than a fruit for us. We’re born here among the fig trees and we grow up with them, we learn from a young age how to look after them,” the 20-year-old said.\n\nDjebbi is working to persuade farmers to preserve traditional ways of processing the products harvested in the area.\n\nShe is working with 10 other women on a cooperative that distils essence from wildflowers, dries figs, and produces fig and mulberry jam.\n\n“Products we learnt how to make from our mothers and grandmothers are becoming popular because they’re of such high quality,” she said.\n\nSource: Jordan Times\n\nPhoto caption: The son of a farm owner sorts figs for export in the Tunisian town of Djebba, southwest of the capital Tunis, on August 19, 2022 (AFP photo)\n\nThe first B2B event related to Multifunctional Olive Systems (LL1) was organized by the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute (LARI) with the support of the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Chania (MAICh) at the SmallVille Hotel in Beirut, Lebanon on 21th July, 2022.\n\nThe objectives of the B2B event included:\n\n– Connecting innovators with stakeholders in the olive sector to work on solutions for their problems;\n\n– Matching demands/requests for innovations;\n\n– Releasing and disseminating of a catalogue of available innovations;\n\n– Introducing innovations in the olive, olive oil and agroforestry sectors to producers, cooperatives, agricultural enterprises, company representatives, millers, and other interested stakeholders;\n\n– Laying the foundations for future innovation projects by providing an opportunity to meet for businesses, associations, research institutions, policy makers and other professionals in agriculture and food production;\n\nAllowing the establishment of new contacts and the sharing of information on innovative ideas, machinery, techniques and services.\n\nDuring this event, on-site presentations, round tables and one-on-one meetings took place. A list of eight innovations was selected from a master catalogue of innovations prepared by the LIVINGAGRO consortium. These innovations were presented by the corresponding researchers/innovators from Greece, Italy and Lebanon. They focused on intercropping of olive with other crops such as grasses and legumes and its impact on soil characteristics, olive fruit production and olive oil quality; the Zen Irriware precision technique for irrigation management; the technique of digital analysis of the size, shape and structure of the fruit to determine the identity of olive cultivars; the method of a DNA-based diagnostic test to document the origin of the cultivar for olive oil; the use of the FT-NIR technique to assess the quality of olive oil; and, the use of Syrian sumac in the preparation of table olives.\n\nIn the afternoon, one-on-one meetings were organized and round tables’ sessions took place to discuss the challenges of the sector and search for appropriate solutions. These discussions were very interactive and included the following main topics: reducing production cost, soil management practices, harvesting time and methods, olive pests and diseases control, and improving olive oil quality. Moreover, some of the participants were interested in getting more knowledge about the innovations discussed during the morning session and others wanted to discern the possibility of future collaboration with some experts.\n\nThe total number of participants attending the event on-site was 71; and, 20 other participants followed the event through the Live Stream over YouTube. The participants included farmers, mill owners, members of cooperatives; research stakeholders working on olive and olive oil such as employees in agricultural universities, employees in NGOs; and policy makers such as employees in the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Economy, employees in municipalities, etc.\n\nThe participants appreciated the value of exchanging experiences among the countries participating in the project and stressed on the importance of becoming familiar with new and advanced technologies to improve their production and the quality of the final products.\n\nFind out more about Multifunctional Olive Systems here\n\nExecutive summary | EN | AR\n\nStakeholders in the Lebanese olive and livestock sectors who are facing challenges are invited to a free B2B event where they can connect with innovators who offer solutions to common problems.

This will allow participants to ask specific questions relevant to their own situations, and to learn more about the innovations of greatest interest to them.\n\nPart of LIVINGAGRO’s Living Laboratories, such connections between audience members and presenters will enable the establishment of new contacts and the sharing of information on innovative ideas, machinery, techniques, and services. The aim is to bring together innovators and those who may use their innovations, encouraging mutually beneficial discussions that could inspire collaborations. Two similar LIVINGAGRO B2B events that occurred online in July and December 2021 in Crete, Greece, did lead to new collaborations between presenters and audience members.\n\nFor more information about the event’s agenda please consult the event dedicated page at the following link on the project ICT platform.\n\nFor attending the event online use the following link.\n\nAn overview of each innovation will be available in English and Arabic Catalogues during the event. The Catalogues can be viewed here (in Arabic and English).\n\nThis event is being organized in the framework of the “LIVINGAGRO – Cross Border Living laboratories for Agroforestry” project which is co-financed by the European Union (90%) through the ENI CBC Med Programme 2014 – 2020 and National Resources (10%). Rather than simply doing research in isolated labs, LIVINGAGRO partners in Italy, Lebanon, Jordan, and Greece have asked farmers, company representatives, policy makers and other stakeholders who work with olive oil and grazed woodlands for input about the types of problems they need to solve, as well as the most workable solutions.\n\nMany survey respondents indicated a desire to increase their product’s quality, improve plant health and/or soil fertility, reduce their production costs, increase the quantity produced, and reduce their use of chemical products. Innovations have been identified that can meet those needs as well as others.\n\nThe LIVINGAGRO team invites all who are interested to learn more, whether online or in person, at the B2B event in Beirut.\n\nFor more information concerning the event please contact Dr. Milad El Raichy at phone nr. +961 70 218 438 or email address mraichy@lari.gov.lb.\n\nOn June 28, 2022 the Italian National Research Council (CNR) organized a project capitalization webinar that concentrated on innovation and transfer of knowledge regarding Mediterranean multifunctional olive systems (the focus of LIVINGAGRO’s Living Lab 1). Stakeholders of the involved project countries (Greece, Italy, Jordan and Lebanon) participated in the webinar. This event followed a first capitalization webinar focused on grazed woodlands (the project’s second Living Lab), which was organized by CNR on January 28, 2021 to investigate innovations and best practices for this agroforestry sector.\n\nMultifunctional olive systems in the Mediterranean Basin include agroforestry systems that highly contribute to sustaining local economies, providing both plant and animal products. Today, there is a strong demand from farmers for an integrated system of good practices that guarantee the sustainability of production, the transfer of innovation and the increase in profitability for the territories and individuals involved. The LIVINGAGRO project addresses these issues using an Open Innovation approach, based on the establishment of a Living Laboratory on multi-functional olive systems that will allow the co-creation of useful innovations based on interactions between suppliers of innovations and those who will use them, eliminating geographical and cultural barriers.\n\nThe capitalization event started with a welcome and brief introduction to the topic by the event moderator, Federica ROMANO, LIVINGAGRO Communication Manager, which was followed by an intervention by Sara MALTONI of the Regional Forest Agency for Land and Environment of Sardinia (Fo.Re.S.T.A.S. – LIVINGAGRO Leading Partner), who presented the LIVINGAGRO project to participants, focusing on the main activities implemented, results achieved to date, and upcoming initiatives. The floor went then to Claudio PORQUEDDU from the Italian National Research Council, Institute for the Animal Production System in the Mediterranean Environment (CNR ISPAAM) of Sassari, who introduced the topic of multifunctional olive systems in the Mediterranean area, reporting on the general situation and the main threats and challenges the sector is facing.\n\nIn the second session of the event, four panelists representing LIVINGAGRO partners introduced the context of olive tree growing in the project countries. The session started with Luciana BALDONI of the Italian National Research Council, Institute of Biosciences and BioResources (CNR IBBR) of Perugia, continuing with Panagiotis KALAITZIS of the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Chania (MAICh) in Greece, Milad EL RIACHI from the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute (LARI) and Salam AYOUB of the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC) in Jordan. Each presentation highlighted the role and current trend of multi-functional olive systems in Italy, Greece, Lebanon and Jordan, focusing on the relevant innovations for the sector identified within the LIVINGAGRO project. The main innovations presented included solutions related to\n\nAgronomic practices for agroforestry systems’ sustainability (nature-based solutions)\n\nPrecision irrigation and resistant olive tree species for adaptation to climate change\n\nEnhancement of cultural traditions and plant genetic heritage\n\nDNA-based authentication of olive trees and olive oil\n\nInnovative disease and pest management in agroforestry systems (e.g. re the olive fly)\n\nSelf-reseeding species to be used as fodder and forage\n\nPractices for increasing yield while protecting biodiversity and avoiding land abandonment\n\nThe final session was dedicated to the capitalization of findings and results of two projects which dealt with topics related to multifunctional olive systems. These were the “Arimnet REFORMA” project, presented by Luciano PECETTI from the Italian Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (CREA) and the “MOLTI” project by Enrico LODOLINI from the same institution (CREA), which focus on the improvement of production in traditional, dense and high-density olive orchards. An open discussion with webinar participants followed, allowing the public to submit contributions and questions for the panelists.\n\nClosing remarks were made by Adolfo ROSATI from the Italian Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (CREA). He focused on integrated agricultural systems, offering the example of an olive orchard where wild asparagus and poultry are grown together, establishing an integrated farming system. Dr. Rosati highlighted the benefits of this practice in terms of soil consumption, energy use, farmers’ income, and circular economy good practices.\n\nHaving identified potentially useful innovations, the partners of the LIVINGAGRO project developed a Catalogue intended to provide an overview of some of the innovations that may be useful to stakeholders involved with multifunctional olive systems and grazed woodlands. This can help bring together economic stakeholders and innovators who may be able to collaborate to solve common problems. This activity included assessing the stage of readiness of a potential innovation, as well as which type of challenges it addresses. Taking into consideration the needs expressed by stakeholders, the research team of the Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Chania (MAICh) and the technical team reviewed the information provided. Following this review, the working group went back to the innovators to address questions and fill in gaps, then incorporated the responses into the innovation descriptions.\n\nIntroduction to section 1 of the Catalogue concerning the re-use of traditional practices in agroforestry\n\nIn agroforestry, trees or shrubs are grown in or around pastureland and/or agricultural crops. Silvopastoralism, a type of agroforestry that combines livestock grazing and trees, was and still is a traditional land use system in many areas. For example, in Xeromero, Aetoloakarnania in western Greece, livestock breeders have used the valonia oak forest for grazing as well as collecting acorn cups from the oaks for use in the tanning industry. Agrosilvopastoralism is another kind of agroforestry where livestock is introduced in the field after the completion of the annual crop. On the island of Kea in the Aegean Sea, farmers used to grow cereals and legumes between trees for both human consumption and as feed for the animals. Greek olive farmers have also traditionally grown annual crops for the market or for grazing animals among their trees – or simply allowed livestock to graze on wild plants in the groves. Lately, there has been a gradual abandonment of this kind of combined land use, with a preference for monoculture, such as olive trees grown alone.\n\nHowever, using forests and olive groves for multiple purposes has many benefits. For example, it ensures a steady and enhanced economic return every year, with a reduced risk of losses due to weather conditions or other types of hazards. Agroforestry can also increase biodiversity, reduce the impact of pests, enrich soil nutrient content, reduce erosion, improve carbon sequestration, and help reduce the risk and severity of forest fires. For these reasons, a return to productive old ways can become a useful innovation that allows farmers and livestock breeders to both increase their incomes from the production of high quality products, and help preserve valuable forest lands and olive groves using sustainable practices.\n\nPresentation of Innovation 4: Livestock grazing in olive agroforestry systems\n\nBackground\n\nIt has been estimated that olive groves cover an area of 700,000 hectares (ha) in Greece, with 124,311 of those hectares forming agroforestry systems in which crops or pasture is established in the lush understory of the olive trees. In these agroforestry systems, the understory usually consists of herbaceous vegetation for animal grazing, vegetables, or crops such as cereals and legumes. With a density of 50-100 mature trees per hectare, olive agroforestry constitutes a traditional land use practice in all the parts of the country that have a mild Mediterranean climate. Almost all the olive trees in the traditional systems were derived from wild plants that were grafted onto the tree trunk at a height of 2 meters in order to avoid animal browsing. These olive trees can be combined with grazing animals (sheep, cattle, goats, even honey bees, pigs or chickens) that may graze on the spontaneous vegetation (wild plants) or on planted crops (such as wheat or barley) in the grove.\n\nKeywords\n\nolive agroforestry, grazing animals, grazing, livestock, traditional practice, herbaceous vegetation, low tree density, high tree age, understory productivity, animal feeding, grain production, hay, profit for farmers, agroforestry, olive growing, olive groves\n\nMethodology\n\nTraditional olive agroforestry systems are found at lower elevations, with trees scattered in the plot or planted in rows. In the first case (trees scattered in the plot), herbaceous vegetation grows, producing animal feed from early fall to late spring. In addition, when shrubs exist in the understory, animals (especially goats) may graze during the summer. The only time grazing is interrupted is during the olive harvest, usually from mid-October to the end of November. Regarding the second case (trees planted in rows), the tree spacing is usually 10X10m. Between the tree rows, farmers can cultivate cereals (oats, barley, wheat, etc.) for grain production and/or legumes (common vetch, chickpeas, etc.) for hay and soil amelioration. Sowing time is usually between mid-October and mid-November, after the first autumn rains and the olive harvest. Sometimes farmers cultivate mixtures of cereals and legumes for hay production. Animals may graze on the stubble after the cereals or mixtures are harvested.\n\nSpecifications\n\nIn the case of spontaneous vegetation in the understory of olive trees, the key factor is grazing management, including the grazing capacity, stocking rate, time of grazing, and grazing system. In the second case, the key factor is tree management (pruning, management of cut branches, harvest time). All of this will be discussed in more detail in the LIVINGAGRO B2B presentation, and a local agronomist can provide additional advice related to each specific case.\n\nImpact\n\n1. Improves the olive agroforestry system’s microclimate\n\n2. Enables low-input cultivation\n\n3. Lowers fertilizer expenses due to “green” manure from grazing animals\n\n4. Provides effective use of understory vegetation\n\n5. Increases the farmer’s income with livestock husbandry products\n\n6. Increases plant and animal diversity, which reduces problems with pests\n\n7. Intercropping with cereals and legumes improves tree productivity\n\n8. The olive tree root system helps filter deeper soil layers and avoid groundwater pollution from fertilizers\n\nFilled gaps\n\nOlive agroforestry systems are more economically sustainable than monocultures since they can reduce farmers’ expenses, improve orchard health, and increase farmers’ income. They can provide income from more than one source: olive products (olive oil and edible olives), animal husbandry products (dairy and meat), grain from cereals, and hay from legumes for feeding livestock.\n\nLimitation\n\nTraditional and modern olive agroforestry systems are usually not irrigated, so their productivity depends mainly on annual precipitation. Dry years may reduce the total productivity.\n\nNext steps/potential extension\n\nOlive agroforestry products could increase farmers’ income and help the local economy even more if they were labelled and promoted as local specialty products and/or environmentally friendly products.\n\nFind out more\n\nKonstantinos Mantzanas, PhD\n\nResearch and Teaching Staff\n\nLaboratory of Rangeland Ecology\n\nFaculty of Forestry and Natural Environment\n\nAristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nEmail: konman@for.auth.gr\n\nLINK TO THE COMPLETE GREEK INNOVATIONS CATALOGUE (EN)\n\nIn the next Episode: Innovation 5, Olive tree, wild asparagus and free-range chicken polyculture!"
