        "text": "I came to know Massimo Forsoni through his aunt, Dora Forsoni, a 68-year-old winegrower/huntress and proprietor of a small winery in Montepulciano (SI) called Az. Agr. Sanguineto. Before I moved to Italy to set up Giannoni Selections in 2014, I tried to attend Vinitaly — Italy’s annual wine trade show held in Verona — as often as I could, which meant tasting with Dora and her life partner Patrizia almost every spring. Not only was I introduced to Sanguineto’s sangiovese-based wines in Verona, but I inevitably got to know other extensions of Dora as well, namely her wild boar salumetto and the extra virgin olive oil made by her nephew, Massimo. Dora Forsoni may be minute in size but she is by no means small in character. As the commander-in-chief of her local, all-male hunting chapter just northeast of Montepulciano, she is a ball of conviction. When hunting, she evidently spends most of her time perched in trees, waiting for her prey. (This way the beast is unable to sense her odor and presence as she attempts to seal their fate.) She essentially takes a sledgehammer to many of Italy’s conventions, especially those regarding viticulture, family, gender, and sexual orientation. Upon meeting her, it becomes obvious enough to just embrace all aspects surrounding Dora, including the olive oil.\n\nWe managed to develop a rapport against the backdrop of a dizzying trade show, unignorably distant from her Tuscany. Even though we connected infrequently, Dora remembered that I worked in a specialty foods/wine store and was sure to have me taste Massimo’s recent harvest, preparing a small plate of bites to accompany her wines. It always included a salame that she had hunted and cured herself – wild boar – and Tuscan bread, you know, the kind without salt, drizzled with Massimo’s peppery, extra virgin olive oil. However, she never bothered to explain what distinguished his extra virgin from others. Maybe it was my Italian back then? I don’t know. For Dora, a product is either good or not good and beyond that there isn’t much discussion. In her sort of tough, butch, Central Italian way she had decided that if I recognized that Massimo’s oil was good, I could sell it.\n\nThis past April I revisited Sanguineto’s Vinitaly stand, this time as an importer and proprietor of my own company. It was as if I was trying Massimo’s extra virgin for the first time, considering it for Giannoni Selections’ portfolio rather than that specialty foods shop in Cambridge. Sensing this, Dora called Massimo on the spot and handed me her cell phone. I was a little taken aback; it was impossible not to feel pressured with the producer on the phone. But it was Dora! And Massimo was lovely! We chatted for a few minutes and I made tentative plans to visit him in Umbria few weeks later.\n\nShortly thereafter I headed to Umbria and met Massimo in Roselli at his Frantoio Forsoni, located in Umbria’s picturesque Colli Martani, just outside of Spoleto. It became quickly apparent that like Dora, but in his own quiet and focused manner, Massimo only believes in top quality. He showed me the workroom where the olives are delivered and processed. It’s not enormous but it is pristine. Here he pointed out the latest technology, explaining each of the machines (many with temperature control) that carry out the cleaning, slitting, pit removal, malaxing, centrifugal extraction, and vertical decanting. Producing olive oil short of the extra virgin category isn’t for him; he opts to send away the pomace (which still has quite a bit of juice remaining in it) to steer clear of any further refining activities. Massimo’s oil, once extracted, is stored in stainless steel drums in the naturally cool cellar below the workroom.\n\nTo give you an idea of the other end of the spectrum of production, in Spain’s Jaén (Andalucía), the crop can be systematically harvested using large, crab-like machines that shake the young trees, causing the olives to fall to the ground to be later vacuumed up. Massimo’s reality is quite different. Everything must be done by hand in his groves because of the steepness and promiscuity of the terrain. Interspersed on some of his slopes are other fruit trees that share the arid, rocky soils. Further, harvest is carried out exclusively during morning hours so that the olives arrive still cool at the mill, which is essential for fragrance and overall freshness. The way Massimo sees it, extreme cleanliness and attention at to detail are crucial at every step, not just during the harvesting/pressing stage. Otherwise all the work during the year in the groves would be futile.\n\nAs I was saying goodbye, it occurred to me that even if I wasn’t necessarily looking to import olive oil before April, it would be difficult to say no to a producer like Massimo Forsoni who takes estate extra virgin olive oil to another level. It’s extremely rare to find an extra virgin that is cultivated, pressed, and bottled by the same person and produced on such a small scale. Perhaps more importantly, the quality of Massimo’s oil speaks for itself – just as Dora instructed it should.\n\nI Clivi Galea Rosso is made from 70-year-old, endangered merlot vines. Yes, endangered. For nearly a decade, winegrower Ferdinando Zanusso has jokingly threatened to uproot his four acres of merlot. And he is neither kidding nor laughing about their low yields.\n\nI Clivi only made 100 cases of Galea Rosso in 2012. Yet Ferdinando can’t help but share his frustration over the merlot – with hidden pride. Then again, he doesn’t bother to conceal his preference for the varietal white wines that he makes from local friulano, malvasia, ribolla gialla, and verduzzo grapes.\n\nColli Orientali del Friuli is reputed for its white wines; its soils have been likened to Burgundy’s Côte D’Or which is high praise for any growing region. Based on this fact, it makes sense that i Clivi should give most of their attention to their white wines. And while most producers rush their reds to market when their wines’ astringency makes one wince, no such urgency has ever occurred to Ferdinando. He only releases Galea Rosso once he deems that it has hit its stride, when it can give pleasure to its imbiber.\n\nPerhaps there’s something to be said for seeking out the lone red of a great white wine producer such as i Clivi. Given their trained apathy towards red wine, it means they only bother to produce Galea Rosso in good vintages and they still inevitably age each bottle in their winery rather than in your cellar (or closet).\n\nFerdinando admits, “It would be difficult to find a wine of this quality (at this price) from Bordeaux’s Right Bank, merlot’s native territory.” He nods, “È un signor vino.” Drink a bottle or two and you’ll find his words difficult to dispute. Look for an intricate, balanced palate that is redolent of black cherries, tobacco, leather, and spice. Pair with roasted or braised meats, salumi, Robiola Roccaverano – always my favorite – and pecorino, preferably Sardinian, aged 4-8 months.\n\n*Note: I Clivi Galea Rosso starts to sing about an hour or two after uncorking and holds up a day, or two, or three after opening.\n\nSimply named after the word for beans in Veneto dialect, Fasioi is a dish that I make almost every week when temperatures begin to drop because it is just that good. Rich, warming, nuanced and delicious, this is a soup that is at once hearty, healthy, and so easy to prepare. The way that these ingredients unite in symphonic flavor in the final dish is evidence of its refinement—even when the few constituents make up little more than a peasant’s fare. Pay attention to the subtleties of the instructions and you’ll master this dish without any difficulty! See the recipe and instructions below. Buon appetito!\n\nIngredients\n\n2.2 lbs Fresh Borlotti Beans or 500 g dried (soaked overnight)\n\n1 Sprig Rosemary\n\n8 Sprigs Thyme\n\n1 White Onion\n\n4-5 Tbs Olive Oil + a little extra to drizzle when plating\n\nFreshly Cracked Pepper to taste\n\nCoarse Salt to taste\n\nWater\n\n1. Remove your beans from the sheaths and give them a good rinse, discarding any that are discolored or sticky. If using dried beans rinse them as well.\n\n2. Cover them with 1 ½ – 2 inches of water and bring them to a boil.\n\n3. Add your finely diced onion to the pot.\n\n4. Let the beans boil for five minutes and then reduce to a simmer (low-medium heat) with the lid partially open. Depending on the beans that you’re using, the overall cooking time could range from 1 ½ hours (if fresh Borlotti) or 2 1/2 hours (if dried). The freshness of the dried beans also factors in as well; fresher beans cook more quickly. Stir about every fifteen to twenty minutes.\n\n5. Prep your herbs for their infusion in the olive oil—the finer the better. (I don’t recommend using dried herbs.)\n\n6. The infusion of rosemary and thyme is to be added just before serving. Heat the oil over low heat for about two minutes in order to extract the flavors and aromas of the fresh herbs.\n\n7. Coarsely crack or grind your black pepper. (Usually I use basic Tellicherry peppercorns that are available almost everywhere.) These are to be stirred in at the very end of cooking.\n\n8. After the beans have reached your preferred consistency—I like them with a bit of density so I let them cook longer, although more liquid is fine too—add the salt in small doses until it is to your liking. Keep in mind that beans need to be well-seasoned in order to show off their earthy flavors.\n\n9. Serve with a drizzle of fresh olive oil—one with a peppery backbone works well in this dish. Pair with a dry, white such as Tocai Friulano, Ribolla Gialla, or Pinot Bianco.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nNote: The finished textures of the versions using fresh beans and dried beans are very different. Because of the naturally higher moisture content of the fresh beans, I would recommend covering them with only an inch and a half of water at the beginning of cooking process. The final result is usually brothier and highlights whole, tender beans. About an hour and twenty minutes of cooking should be sufficient for fresh bean version. An alternative is to puree about half of the beans and reenter them into the soup in order to achieve a richer, silkier mouthfeel. The soup from dried Borlotti, instead, requires about two and a half hours of slow cooking. Towards the end the beans begin to break down and sort of create a puree on their own that yields a denser result. Because of the extended cooking, be sure to cover the beans with two inches of water (or slightly more) before initiating the process. Don’t be afraid to add some water midway if necessary. Adjust the cooking time in accordance with the final texture that you’re looking for.\n\nIt’s not by chance that pasta al pomodoro is Italy’s most beloved dish, offered on most menus throughout the country. When executed properly it is subtle and refined and yet so simple and satisfying. Sweet, savory, herbaceous, and spicy – it covers an impressive range of flavors. There are a million variations of this tomato-based pasta, but the one I make is at its best in August when tomatoes are hitting their stride. I’m not going to lie, I actually shudder when I hear New Yorkers referring to tomato sauce as gravy. This recipe is the complete opposite of “gravy” or a cooked sauce; it is more of an aglio-olio-peperoncino recipe with fresh plum tomatoes that have been de-seeded and cored. In this top ingredients are key because they can’t hide behind a heavy garlic/cooked tomato flavor. This method is all about showing off the quality of the tomatoes. So hit the farmer’s market!!\n\nIngredients (serves four)\n\n600 g plum tomatoes\n\n20 leaves fresh basil\n\n2 fresh peperoncini (or chili peppers)\n\nsale grosso (large grain salt)\n\nolive oil\n\n500 g pasta\n\nNote: Here in Italy I usually use plum tomatoes from Sicily because they have thin skins, less liquid and seeds, and a concentrated, not overly sweet flavor. Use what you like best or tomatoes that have similar qualities.\n\nProcedure:\n\nRinse your tomatoes.\n\n2.\n\nSlit each tomato so that this incision will become more pronounced with its brief boiling.\n\n3.\n\nBoil your tomatoes for about two minutes or until you notice the slits becoming more apparent. (*It is essential to expose the tomatoes to as little cooking as possible so to maintain the utmost freshness of the finished dish.)\n\n4.\n\nFrom the boiling pot place your tomatoes in an ice water bath (my ice has melted in this photo!) so to avoid further cooking.\n\n5.\n\nCarefully remove the skins of the tomatoes, using your original incision to initiate the process.\n\n6.\n\nRemove all seeds, excess water, and the gelatinous part of the tomato as well as any small stem. (It doesn’t have to look pretty.)\n\n7.\n\nAdd salt to the tomatoes and then torn basil. If you have time, refrigerate the tomatoes at this point for about an hour or two to macerate the tomatoes, basil, and salt and then take them out about a half an hour before you use them to let them come to room temperature.\n\n8.\n\nSlice your garlic thinly and chop your peperoncino, adding both to about four to five tablespoons of oil. Make sure that your oil covers the contents. Infuse the ingredients over low heat for about three minutes or until you can smell the garlic. (*A finer dice of the peperoncino will make the finished dish more piccante – also depending on the length of the heating during this step. I try to keep the heating to a minimum so to maintain the freshness of the oil at this stage to keep the flavors light and fresh with just enough garlic and spiciness.)\n\n9.\n\nMy preferred pasta for this dish: Martelli spaghetti from Pisa. Other favorite pastas: Setaro, Benedetto Cavallieri, and Rustichella. (Also De Cecco. NEVER Barilla.) Martelli has a ton of flavor on its own – you can taste the sweetness and nuttiness of the grain. It is toothsome and inviting.\n\n10.\n\nThere is no need to finish the dish over heat in a saucepan – simply combine well the infused oil with the tomatoes and pasta and proceed to plating! If you can coat the pasta and tomatoes without using ALL of the infused oil, feel free to leave out the remainder if you want to achieve the freshest flavor profile of the finished dish. At the table be sure to add a few extra leaves of freshly torn basil and a drizzle of olive oil to further enliven the dish. *Adding a touch of uncooked (uninfused) oil is essential because it gives even more lightness and balance to the dish, perfectly melding cooked and fresh flavors and ingredients. With one forkful you’ll see that this dish is very much the sum of the quality of its ingredients – fresh, light, and symphonic – so be selective at the farmer’s market!\n\nEccoci! Pasta al Pomodoro! Enjoy it until summer tomatoes disappear!"
