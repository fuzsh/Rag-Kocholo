        "text": "Texas is better known for its crude oil than for its olive oil, but a small olive industry is growing in South Texas. Recently on the local PBS station, KEDT-TV, a documentary was aired as part of its annual fund-raiser. It was called “Texas Olive Trails.” Check out this website to view a trailer.\n\nHere is a quote from the site:\n\n“Sun, stone, drought, silence and solitude: these are the five ingredients that, according to Italian folk traditions, create the ideal habitat for the Olive Tree.”\n\nThe area is also on the same geographical parallel as the Mediterranean. A large aquifer is found beneath the area stretching for many miles. OK…maybe it doesn’t look quite like Tuscany.\n\nThe olives will be harvested in September. I have not tried any before, but I intend to check out the 2011 Texas Olive Ranch products when they are available in my local grocery store – perhaps the Rattlesnake Pepper & Chipotle, Mesquite or Sweet Basil. For now check them out on their website . http://texasoliveranch.com/index.html They all appear to be extra virgin – always better.\n\nIn January I bought oil from a friend who has an olive farm in Tuscany and will post something about that later. Hint: it was excellent!\n\nWhat is Success?\n\nTo laugh often and much:\n\nTo win the respect of intelligent people\n\nand the affection of children;\n\nTo earn the appreciation of honest critics\n\nand endure the betrayal of false friends;\n\nTo appreciate beauty:\n\nTo find the best in others;\n\nTo leave the world a bit better, whether by\n\na healthy child, a garden\n\npatch or a redeemd social condition;\n\nTo know even one life has breathed\n\neasier because you have lived.\n\nThis is to have succeeded.\n\n–Ralph Waldo Emerson"
