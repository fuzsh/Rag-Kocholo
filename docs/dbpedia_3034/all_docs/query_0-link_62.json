        "text": "Professor David Foster, of the Biological Sciences Department, recently appeared on Channel 4's NBC News New York to explain his research into the cancer-fighting potential of extra virgin olive oil. According to Foster, oleocanthal, an ingredient in extra-virgin olive oil, \"could be used in cancer therapies\" because it can kill a variety of human cancer cells, but \"it doesn't seem to harm...non-cancerous cells.\" Working with Paul Breslin, professor of nutritional sciences in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University, and Onica LeGendre, also of Hunter College, Professor Foster published the findings in the journal Molecular and Cellular Oncology."
