        "text": "I decided to try The Criterion Channel service, and I thought it would be fun to document some of what we watch, and share some of what I learn. I own a few outstanding Criterion discs, including the Godzilla set, and some John Waters films.\n\nThe Criterion Collection, Inc. (or simply Criterion) is an American home-video distribution company that focuses on licensing, restoring and distributing “important classic and contemporary films”. A de facto subsidiary of arthouse film distributor Janus Films, Criterion serves film and media scholars, cinephiles and public and academic libraries. Criterion has helped to standardize certain aspects of home-video releases such as film restoration, the letterboxing format for widescreen films and the inclusion of bonus features such as scholarly essays and documentary content about the films and filmmakers. Criterion most notably pioneered the use of commentary tracks. Criterion has produced and distributed more than 1,000 special editions of its films in VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray formats and box sets. These films and their special features are also available via The Criterion Channel, an online streaming service that the company operates.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Criterion_Collection\n\nI’ve been debating signing up for some time, and the thing that finally persuaded me was Viggo Mortensen recommendations of his favorite westerns in the Criterion Closet. I like Viggo’s westerns, and he knows his stuff.\n\nI started with Stagecoach. Directed in 1939 by John Ford, this was John Wayne’s breakthrough role. The screenplay is based on a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox called The Stage to Lordsburg. The film follows a group of strangers riding on a stagecoach through dangerous Apache territory.\n\nStagecoach is one of the most influential films ever made, and not just for westerns, although it was highly influential for many subsequent western films. Orson Welles argued that it was a perfect textbook of filmmaking. He watched it more than 40 times in preparation for the making of Citizen Kane. In 1995, the film was deemed “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry.\n\nStagecoach was filmed in Monument Valley, on the Arizona–Utah border in the American Southwest and on several movie ranches (Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, California and the RKO Encino Ranch). As such, there are some geographic incongruities. Yet, the scenery is remarkable, even in black and white.\n\nThere is a scene where the stagecoach has to cross a river, and the camera seems to be mounted to the coach, looking down. The viewer feels as though they are bring pulled along into the water by the horses with the characters on the coach, and it’s quite exciting. It’s a very clever shot. The chase across the plain where the Apaches are battling to stop the stagecoach is exciting to watch, even today.\n\nSomething I notice about a lot of older films and TV is the general pacing is so much slower. I’ve rewatched all the episodes of The Six Million Dollar Man several times (it’s a favorite to have on the background when I am working in my studio). Of course, this show was made for network television between 1973-1978. I chuckle to myself as a shot will frame a car coming toward the viewer from the top of a hill some distance away, and there is not cut – we just watch them drive down a road, in real time. And, I’m not saying that slowness is a bad thing (sometimes it is), but the pacing of current film/shows is likely indicative of our attention/distraction culture.\n\nI will write more about 6MDM later. I have thoughts.\n\nLeading up to subscribing to Criterion, we watched Anatomy of a Murder over several evenings before falling asleep. I’ve enjoyed the soundtrack for years, but had never seen the film. Duke Ellington himself makes a charming appearance, too. This is the first American film to feature an African-American composer/soundtrack. Saul Bass did the introduction graphics and tiles, to wonderful effect.\n\nThis is a 1959 American courtroom drama film produced and directed by Otto Preminger. The screenplay by Wendell Mayes was based on the 1958 novel of the same name written by Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker under the pen name of Robert Traver. Voelker based the novel on a 1952 murder case in which he was the defense attorney. On July 31, 1952, Lt. Coleman A. Peterson shot and killed Maurice Chenoweth at a tavern in Big Bay, Michigan. Peterson’s wife Charlotte had claimed Chenowyth raped and beat her. This film has been cited by various organizations as one of the finest trial films ever made, and in 2012, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.”\n\nJames Stewart’s character, a bachelor, is an improviser, and spend most of his time fishing and listening to jazz. He has a quickness that helps him in the courtroom.\n\nAlso not watched on Criterion, but watched nonetheless, was Chinatown: a 1974 American neo-noir mystery film directed by Roman Polanski (screenplay by Robert Towne). Set in 1937, it was inspired by the California water wars, a series of disputes over southern California water at the beginning of the 20th century, by which Los Angeles interests secured water rights in the Owens Valley. This was Polanski’s last film in the United States and features many elements of film noir, particularly a multi-layered story that is part mystery and part psychological drama. It’s a great story, and while we never hear what actually happened to J.J. “Jake” Gittes (Jack Nicholson) in Chinatown, it seems to play out in the primary narrative, and is hinted at as a story within a story. It’s as though the past is determined to repeat itself. I want to watch the sequel, The Two Jakes. More on that soon.\n\nNext, we watched Variety Lights (Luci del varietà), 1950, directed by Federico Fellini and Alberto Lattuada. From the Criterion site:\n\nMade in collaboration with Alberto Lattuada, Federico Fellini’s directorial debut unfolds amid the colorful backdrop of a traveling vaudeville troupe whose quixotic impresario (Peppino De Filippo) is tempted away from his faithful mistress (Giulietta Masina) by the charms of an ambitious young dancer (Carla Del Poggio). Though the details of what the division of duties was between the two directors are unclear, this lively backstage capriccio is unmistakably Felliniesque in its whimsical fascination with the heightened reality, carnivalesque characters, and exotic allure of the world of show business. In the first of her celebrated collaborations with her director husband, Giulietta Masina displays the spirited vulnerability that would soon become an archetype of cinematic emotiveness.\n\nMy favorite scene is when Checco Dal Monte takes Lily to dinner. The stage is revealed as the image of a woman is stretched horizontally, and it is striking. There’s a ventriloquist gag, and the dancing involves the women riding men around the dance floor. Every seems to enjoy this.\n\nThe Man Who Wasn’t There\n\nThis 2001 neo-noir crime film was written, directed, produced and co-edited by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is in black-and-white and employs voiceover narration, honoring classic film noir. It differs by including classical music, setting the plot in a small town, and featuring a protagonist from outside the criminal underworld. The plot was influenced by James M. Cain’s crime novels, primarily Double Indemnity, The Postman Always Rings Twice, and Mildred Pierce. Aesthetically, The Man Who Wasn’t There was inspired by films from the 1940s and 1950s—including Shadow of a Doubt—along with science fiction films and documentaries of the period. It was filmed in California.\n\nThe protagonist (Ed Crane) is a quiet, brooding, yet even kind of fellow that makes a living in his brother-in-law’s barbershop. He mentions that he and his wife married after a very short courtship, and he asked “Don’t you want to get to know me better?” to which her reply was similar to “Why? What’s the point?” There is an underlying discontent in his manner, and for all his silent calm, he seems shallow.\n\nI particularly enjoyed James Gandolfini and Jon Polito in this.\n\nMulholland Drive\n\nWe made it through Mulholland Drive. I’ve ventured into a few sites that examine the narrative of this. I think if I had watched this when it came out, I would have been more interested in developing my own theories. I want to spend that time watching other things, however.\n\nAs an aside, speaking of John Ford, Lynch played him in The Fablemans.\n\nIt was a lovely 4 day weekend. The New York Times had an interesting article called The Century-Long Saga of the Caesar Salad and there is an accompanying recipe.\n\nWe had it twice. The first time was with shrimp, and I think we preferred it without shrimp.\n\nYield: 2 to 4 servings\n\n1 large head romaine lettuce (about 1 pound)\n\n1 large egg\n\n4 to 6anchovy fillets, minced\n\n1 large garlic clove, minced\n\n¾ teaspoon Dijon mustard\n\n2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice\n\n1½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\n\n¼ teaspoon kosher salt\n\n½ teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper\n\n½ cup extra-virgin olive oil\n\n¼ cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish\n\n¼ cup olive oil\n\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n\n20 thin baguette slices (each about ¼-inch thick)\n\nStep 1 Crisp the romaine lettuce: Trim and discard the base, then separate the leaves, rinse them in cold water and drain. Spread them out on two clean kitchen towels (or paper towels), gently roll them up and refrigerate them for at least an hour.\n\nStep 2 Make the croutons: In a small bowl, mix the olive oil and the garlic until well combined. Heat the oven to 375 degrees and set a rack in the middle.\n\nStep 3 Place the baguette slices on a large baking sheet in a single layer. Generously brush the tops with the garlic oil, then swipe the slices around the pan to make sure their sides underneath soak up the olive oil mixture that soaks through to the bottom. Toast in the oven for 13 to 15 minutes, turning halfway through, until browned and crunchy. Set aside.\n\nStep 4 While the bread toasts, in a small saucepan, bring water to a boil over medium-high heat. Using a slotted spoon, gently lower the egg into the water, release it and let it cook for 1 minute. Remove with the slotted spoon and set aside to cool.\n\nStep 5 In a large wooden bowl, using the back of a soup spoon, mash the anchovies with the garlic, mustard, lime juice and Worcestershire sauce, pressing the mixture against the bowl in circular motions, mixing it well until it thickens and turns into a creamy paste. Cracked the cooled egg into a separate bowl, and add the yolk to the wooden bowl, discarding the egg white. Using a fork or a whisk, mix thoroughly to combine. Add the salt and pepper and mix well. Slowly, pour in the ½ cup olive oil, whisking vigorously to emulsify the dressing as you do. Add the grated Parmesan and continue mixing until very thickened.\n\nStep 6 Add the cold lettuce leaves and, using tongs or your hands, toss to coat with the dressing. Serve on a couple of plates. Smear the croutons into the remaining dressing in the bowl and tuck them into the lettuce, including a few on top. Add more Parmesan to taste and serve immediately.\n\nAwesome! I also made my pop’s Ceviche recipe. It works every time. Here’s some pics from the weekend."
