This is a wonderful short film ( 43 mins) made with love by my friend and fellow “ Assagiatore” Fil Bucchino . If you want to understand what makes olive oil so special, it is so worth watching. It is filled with my friends/ assagiatori , my Professor, and the wonderful producers that I buy from year after year. If you want a glimpse into why I feel the magic Fil describes about the olive tree and her golden oil …..PLEASE watch this film!!
