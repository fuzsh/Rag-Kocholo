        "text": "It isn’t much to look at, for the album artwork for Dan Hill’s 1978 release Frozen In The Night is atrocious, but dismissing this album, based on the cover alone, would be a grave mistake for any music lover.\n\nOf course, you can be forgiven for having never heard this album as 1978 was abuzz with numerous classic recordings and while many of the popular titles have remained in the social consciousness, it is the lesser-known and celebrated albums that I find to be the most compelling. Perhaps that is due to the music not being overplayed and therefore I haven’t become fatigued by it. Regardless, a core reason why Frozen In The Night doesn’t feel dated to the era, from a musical perspective, is that the musicians and the entire production team didn’t fall into the trap of linking it to a 70s sound signature. By doing so, they’ve created a timeless recording that will outlive us all.\n\nFrozen In The Night is your classic singer/songwriter pop album with a touch of soft rock. Firmly planted in the then Easy Listening category, it’s an album I can listen to on repeat for hours on end. There really isn’t a bad song to be heard and in many respects, it could be presented as a textbook example of a record that is all killer and no filler.\n\nBeing born in the September of 1979 meant that I was unaware of this release and while it didn’t come across my radar during my formative years, streaming has allowed me to explore the recordings that weren’t mainstream enough to be played on the radio in Australia during the 80s and 90s. Interestingly, however, I’m certain that I’ve heard many of these songs before, yet I can not pinpoint when or by what medium that occurred. Dan Hill may not have been as mainstream as other Easy Listening artists from the same era, but it is undeniable that he was a well-respected and regarded musician and it stands to reason that I may well have heard his music but never connected the artist to the songs.\n\nDisappointingly, Frozen In The Night has been out of print, on physical media, for decades. This is one example of where streaming, and digital purchasing on platforms such as the iTunes Store, is imperative to music lovers. If it had not been for streaming, I most likely would have never come across this masterpiece; an album that has quickly become one of my all-time favourites.\n\nFrozen In The Night was, however, re-issued on CD by MCA Records, only once, in 1996 for the Canadian market; Hill’s home country. As an Australian, I can understand this release structure, for artists that are well known, and highly regarded, in this country remain lesser known in other regions of the world. I’m talking about an artist such as John Farnham; a brilliant vocalist, one of the world’s greatest, yet one that has known little recognition outside of the Australian Music scene. While Frozen In The Night was released to the Australian marketplace, upon its release in 1978, it simply isn’t well-known.\n\nThe Apple Music stream is most likely derived from the aforementioned CD release. It’s a lovely facsimile, even if a little clinical in places, but a small EQ adjustment to the bass region results in a thoroughly engrossing sound that is free-flowing and spacious with regard to sonic separation between musical elements. While the soundstage could be wider, at no time does the stream sound congested. Hill and the band aren’t necessarily in the room with you, on this particular release, but it’s a solid performer and if it never sees a remaster, I will forever be grateful for the available edition.\n\nFrozen In The Night is a stunning opener that sets the tone for the entire album. Every aspect is utterly perfect and that continuous slow build to the chorus is done so well that I could listen to this song alone, on repeat indefinitely. Brilliant!\n\nAll I See Is Your Face slows the tempo a little, but doesn’t feel out of place in the album’s sequencing. I wish more modern albums had a similar flow for Frozen In The Night is first and foremost an album experience. All I See Is Your Face is, subsequently, a magnificent tune.\n\nNo One Taught Me How To Lie has a gorgeous acoustic guitar opening and Hill’s vocal pace and pitch throughout are nothing short of exceptional.\n\n(Why Did You Have To Go And) Pick On Me has a familiar sound and while perfectly suited to the Easy Listening category, it’s another magnificent tune from Frozen In The Night.\n\nFriends to some may constitute album filler, but filler tunes never sounded this good. Granted, Friends is a slow burn and I feel it could have been a stronger song had the introduction been shortened by a third, but the guitar work, mid-song, ensures it’s unforgettable.\n\nLet The Song Last Forever is one of my favourite tunes from the album; it’s simply lovely.\n\nWhen The Hurt Comes is pure bliss. The piano and orchestral arrangement, combined with the acoustic guitar and Hill’s smooth vocals are exactly what musical dreams are made of.\n\nDark Side Of Atlanta is, as is the case with many of the songs from Frozen In The Night, an excellent story-telling tune. While it is true that I appreciate music more from a musical than interpretational perspective, there are songs such as Dark Side Of Atlanta that make me sit up and pay attention. As a singer/songwriter, this would most likely be Hill’s intent but the greatest aspect of Dark Side Of Atlanta is that it can be thoroughly appreciated from both perspectives.\n\nIndian Woman is so good that I question how Hill wasn’t more successful than he was. Yes, he has achieved more than many musicians have throughout his career, but Indian Woman is a spectacular tune, with an addictive chorus, that deserved more attention than it received. In a way, Indian Woman reminds me of the Eagles' music and would have been a perfect song for them to record. If they had, I dare say that it would have been a hit.\n\nTill The Day I Die is the greatest song on Frozen In The Night and in part that is due to Leah Kunkel’s incredible backing vocals. While Celine Dion would record Hill’s song, Seduces Me (co-written with John Sheard), on Falling Into You, I can’t help but wonder how Dion would have performed Till The Day I Die as I feel it would have been perfectly suited to her. Perhaps even with Barbra Streisand; based on how complementary they were on Tell Him. Nevertheless, that cover never happened, but we are incredibly fortunate to have this masterpiece. It’s just a shame that it was never released as a single for I believe it would have been a chart-topper; worldwide!\n\nYour Only Friend (Sometimes Pain Can Be Your Only Friend) is a little sombre to close the album on, but it’s such a beautiful tune that I can’t help but enjoy it. If nothing else, it encourages me to play the album again so in that context it is a perfect closer.\n\nFrom start to finish, Frozen In The Night is an astonishing release and is not only one of my favourite albums from 1978, but it’s one of the best records released in the 70s. It is truly underrated and I hope you find just as much enjoyment from this album as I do; a timeless classic!"
