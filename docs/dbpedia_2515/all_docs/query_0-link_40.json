        "text": "I’d like to begin this review with a caveat. I’ve been a huge Pearl Jam fan since I first saw the “Alive” video on MTV back in 1991. I was at their first-ever European show in a tiny room in Southend-on-Sea and have seen them live 19 more times since. Three of those shows I also photographed. Having said that, though, like a lot of fans, their more recent releases have failed to ignite that same intense passion for the music in quite the same way they used to. I enjoy all of their albums, and there are always incredible songs on each release, but records like “Lightning Bolt” and “Gigaton” always left me hoping for something more.\n\nSo, when rumours of “a return to form” began circulating earlier this year, anticipation could not have been much higher for Pearl Jam’s twelfth studio album, “Dark Matter.” “No hyperbole,” Eddie Vedder said, “I think this is our best work.” So, is this album a return to past glories? Well, not quite. It is, however, a bold and adventurous record that feels like a very deliberate statement. It’s their way of declaring they’re still relevant over thirty years into their career.\n\nProducer Andrew Watt, known for revitalizing legends like The Rolling Stones, Iggy Pop and Ozzy Osbourne and for working on Eddie Vedder’s last solo album, injects that same energy into Pearl Jam. Watt is a self-confessed Pearl Jam superfan, so he clearly wants to do his best work for the record. The production occasionally suffers a little from the infamous “loudness wars” treatment that seems to make every instrument feel pushed way up in the mix. That sometimes means Vedder’s lyrics struggle to peek through the sonic onslaught, and that’s one of the only real issues I have with this new record.\n\nMusically, though, each member of Pearl Jam brings their A-game to this project. McCready’s guitar solos are more visceral and dynamic than they have been in decades, ripping through the fabric of each song with a ferocity that is genuinely thrilling. His skillful playing brings a sense of urgency and passion to each track, reminding us of his immense talent. Stone Gossard’s infectious riffs manage to set the stage for an album brimming with raw energy and conviction. Never forget, this is the guy who wrote almost all the music on their legendary debut album, “Ten.” I still miss that real groove that Gossard used to bring to the band’s earlier music, though.\n\nBassist Jeff Ament is in fine form, too, with his bass lines bouncing around like pinballs in an arcade machine. His playing adds a layer of complexity to the music, creating a rhythmic backbone that propels each track forward. Drummer Matt Cameron leaves his mark all over this record, delivering a percussive force that is both powerful and precise.\n\nAnd, of course, there’s Eddie Vedder. His voice is as potent and powerful as ever, easily transitioning from a roar to a croon. His lyrics are reliably introspective and profound, often touching on themes of love, loss, and the human condition. Sometimes, his songwriting can drift towards rather ordinary on this album, but that rarely detracts from the music.\n\n“Dark Matter” is an album that combines the experimental tones of “No Code,” the raw aggression of “Vs.,” the skilled guitar work of “Yield,” and the mature sensibilities of “Gigaton.” It’s an amalgamation of everything that has made Pearl Jam such a dominant force in the music industry for over three decades. Longtime fans of the band will be relieved to find plenty to love here, and those who may have drifted away over the years would do well to give them another listen.\n\nThe record kicks off with a one-two punch of “Scared of Fear” and one of my personal highlights, “React, Respond.” These tracks are pure, unadulterated Pearl Jam: Eddie Vedder’s trademark growl weaving through a maelstrom of McCready’s electrifying riffs and Cameron’s pulverizing drums. It’s a glorious racket, the kind that makes you want to crank the volume and air guitar like a teenager possessed.\n\nAnother highlight is “Wreckage,” which is sure to become a fan favourite. It is a stunning Tom Petty-esque entry that is so instantly anthemic, floating through eight verses before the chorus even begins. Eddie projects the refrain “holding on” so forcefully that it really does sound like a Pearl Jam classic in the making that will have arenas singing along.\n\n“Dark Matter,” the album’s title track, is a surprising but intriguing choice for the lead single. While not the album’s catchiest song, it has intensity yet maintains a sense of controlled chaos thanks to Cameron and the relentless guitars that drive the explosive finale. “Got To Give” recalls The Who’s mod-rock swagger, while “Running” is a little more Ramones-y punk-by-numbers, harking back to Backspacer’s more urgent moments.\n\nThe album isn’t without its surprises, either. “Waiting for Stevie,” a celestial ode to the power of live music, is a song birthed from a session for Vedder’s solo album while waiting for Stevie Wonder. It’s a track that creeps up on you, giving off a “Given To Fly” vibe before McCready explodes with a nearly 90-second guitar solo, his most potent since “Alive.” Here, Matt Cameron channels the intensity of his Soundgarden days, adding a celestial heartbeat to the track.\n\nSure, the album isn’t without its flaws. “Something Special” might leave you wincing a bit, and some of the lyrics veer into the territory of the overly familiar. The song, written for Eddie’s daughters, slips into more sentimental territory, with Vedder wearing his heart on his sleeve as he reflects on fatherhood. It’s the only track on the record I suspect will find me reaching for the skip button.\n\nOverall, though, the record is a potent reminder of Pearl Jam’s enduring power. They may be elder statesmen of grunge now, but they can still pack a punch that would make their younger selves proud. This is a record that rewards repeated listens, revealing hidden depths and unexpected twists with each spin. ‘Let us not fade,’ repeats Eddie at the end of melancholic closing track, “Setting Sun.” On the strength of these songs, there seems little risk of that.\n\nApparently, it only took three weeks to record “Dark Matter.” In truth, it’s the kind of record that takes a lifetime to make. It’s a robust and vibrant album and a testament to Pearl Jam’s enduring creative power, to their ability to evolve while staying true to their roots, and, most importantly, to their ability to still create great music.\n\nIt’s not a return to form; it’s simply Pearl Jam being Pearl Jam, and that’s something truly special.\n\nDark Matter Tracklist\n\nScared of Fear\n\nReact, Respond\n\nWreckage\n\nDark Matter\n\nWon’t Tell\n\nUpper Hand\n\nWaiting for Stevie\n\nRunning\n\nSomething Special\n\nGot to Give\n\nSetting Sun\n\nSteve Gerrard\n\n“Dark Matter” is set to be released on April 19, 2024, through Monkeywrench Records and Republic Records.\n\nShare this :"
