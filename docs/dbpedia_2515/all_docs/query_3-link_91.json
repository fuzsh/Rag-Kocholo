        "text": "by Melanie Walker, Music Director\n\nI'll admit that, while Kanye West may be obnoxious at times, I can't deny that he's sonically one of the more interesting hip hop producers on the scene right now. He dares to be odd and challenging in a world where pop music can easily repeat itself. But as one of the most polarizing artists in recent pop culture, people seem to go to extremes and either love him or hate him. So, when I heard his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was slated to release, I was anxious to put my ears on what one of the most notorious MC's out there was concocting next.\n\nUpon first listen, I have to give the guy some credit for at least being glaringly honest. Kanye doesn't hide behind his supernova persona, but openly admits most of his faults whether it's being jerk or having repeated public emotional breakdowns. He is probably the most openly self-aware MC out there right now. This album itself is a deeper look inside the dark corners of his twisted psyche. Tracks like \"Blame Game\" and \"Runaway\" end up becoming public confessions of his own overbearing bravado. Kanye knows he takes it too far sometimes, but that's part of his rock star guise, to be over the top with everything and we can take it or leave it.\n\nWhile West went minimal on his last release, 808's and Heartbreak, he takes it to extremes on this recent release. Musically, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, delivers with lengthy instrumentals layered with hip hop epics, R&B ballads, other-worldly electronics, prog-rock samples, and surprise guests from Bon Iver to Fergie to Chris Rock ... even Elton John shows up on it with a piano solo. This is Kanye's hip hop manifesto and it delivers with music that is often-times exhilarating, often abrasive, never predictable, and simply said just stunningly gorgeous.\n\nMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ultimately ends up being a surreal look at an artist embracing his pop-star/super-villain persona, while he struggles to connect with the creative potential as a producer that made him garner attention in the first place. The album is completely different from everything he's done thus far, but it's still irrevocably Kanye. Am I fan of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy? Absolutely. Am I a fan of Kanye West the man? To be determined. Yet, I'm not one to judge someone's art based purely on their personality alone. Hopefully, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy will push hip-hop in a bold new direction and survive the entire backlash that all potential classics must eventually meet head on."
