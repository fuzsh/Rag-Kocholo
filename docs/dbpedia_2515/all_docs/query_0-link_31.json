Listen to the album’s lead single/title track throughout the day on SiriusXM’s Pearl Jam Radio (Ch. 22).\n\nDue out on April 19, Dark Matter will be Pearl Jam’s 12th studio album and their first since 2020’s Gigaton. The album was produced by Andrew Watt and recorded over three weeks at Shangri-La Studios in Malibu, California. Dark Matter features Pearl Jam “playing together with a burst of inspiration,” according to their press release. Preorder the album on the band’s website here now.\n\nPearl Jam will embark on a North American run of shows beginning in Vancouver, Canada, on May 4. The band will then deliver a series of concerts on west coast of the U.S., including in Portland, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles, as well as headline the BottleRock Napa festival.\n\nIn June, Pearl Jam will head to the U.K. and Europe, before returning to the U.S. in August for concerts in the Midwest and along the East Coast. The band will also play shows in Australia and New Zealand in November.\n\nAlso, the tour will feature Deep Sea Diver on the first North American leg, Glen Hansard on the second North American leg, The Murder Capital in UK/Europe, Richard Ashcroft in Dublin and London, and the Pixies in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDark Matter Tracklist\n\n1.
