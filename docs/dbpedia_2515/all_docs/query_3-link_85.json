        "text": "I find it is good policy to give credit where it is due. I saw some of my Facebook friends naming their favorite albums for every year they've been alive. Cool, right? You can get neat ideas from social media.\n\nThen I saw some other folks start joining in. And before long, I was seeing Facebook groups getting into it. In a very short time, it seemed to become a minor viral event.\n\nAnd it got me thinking about my favorite albums, from 1980 to 2015. Boy, it is difficult. Some years had so many fantastic albums. Other years, well ... Yeah, they were easier.\n\nIt took me a while. I had to look at charts, I looked for lists of album releases. You wouldn't believe how incomplete and patchy they can be. You have to be a detective to start piecing things together just to make a list that doesn't completely overlook genres like country, hip-hop and some alternative albums.\n\nAfter I'd made my list, I was kind of surprised at how relatively predictable it was. But you know what, we like what we like. I make no apologies for the music I love.\n\nI started thinking about how this would make a great column. That I could talk about each album, discuss why it made the cut, do a miniature review for each one.\n\nThen I started to face some realities. There are 36 albums on this list. If I did two paragraphs for each one, I'd have this massive story that would eat up too much real estate in the print world. And for online, I'd feel like I'd only brushed on things and would want desperately to build on it.\n\nThus, inspiration led to a special project. I allowed myself to really stretch out and tackle this idea in a special online presentation. It is too large for print, so the Times won't be reproducing it in the newspaper.\n\nWith this special package, you'll get my album reviews, with some album art and a video for each. Yup, I just might eat up your afternoon. Or maybe you'll want to space it out over the weekend.\n\nAnd I want to stress that this is about favorite albums, not best albums. In some cases, you'll often find that there's a superior artistic expression, or a more controversial or critically acclaimed work in the mix ... but it doesn't trump an album that you just like better, for whatever reason. To thine own self, be true.\n\nIn any event, I enjoyed seeing so many people get into this idea on Facebook. And I want to give special props to a musician, music fan and music columnist who I feel fortunate to consider a friend. Thanks, Jon Hunt, for being one of the sparks that got me launched on this project. Music you love is always best shared with people you enjoy.\n\nAfter reading my picks, maybe you would enjoy making your own list. Maybe this will give you some ideas. Or heck, maybe this is a good conversation starter as you get together with your families for the holidays. Maybe it'll make some fun office talk. \"Say, what was your favorite birth-year album?\" For you, my fellow music fans, I hope you have a ball. You may agree with some of the picks, you may disagree, you'll no doubt have your own thoughts. Share them! Let's jaw a bit about our favorite music.\n\nAnd with that, let's get to the fun. I hope you enjoy it, and that it inspires you to think about your favorite music over the years.\n\nThis is the opinion of music enthusiast and audio addict Chris Shields. Contact him at clshields@stcloudtimes.com and follow him on Twitter @clshields1980. Read more of his columns at www.sctimes.com/cshields.\n\nWhen I listen to music, I hear details that make a difference, that leave a mark. If a song isn't particularly amazing in terms of songwriting or construction, genuine feeling and zeal can still elevate it. Take \"Tutti Frutti\" for instance. There's a great hook to it, but what sells it? Little Richard's vocal investment. \"A wop bop a loo bop,\" indeed.\n\nBob Dylan's \"Saved,\" if nothing else, is a triumph of conviction. And by nothing else, I only mean that some will dismiss it for the direction of the content. As the middle of the \"Born Again\" albums (sandwiched between \"Slow Train Coming\" and \"Shot of Love\"), \"Saved\" often gets ignored. \"Slow Train Coming\" has great songs, sounds great and was something new as Dylan \"reinvented\" himself yet again. And \"Shot of Love\" features \"Every Grain of Sand,\" one of Dylan's finest songs.\n\nConviction, I say, and conviction I mean. Listen to Dylan's voice. His earnestness. He is invested in these songs. His passion was righteous, the words and beliefs sincerely conveyed. The gospel stylings he encourages and invests into album opener \"A Satisfied Mind\" gets things going. Hums and affirmations abound, and show that Dylan really is identifying with this sound, with these feelings.\n\nAt the time of release, Dylan often spoke of his belief that Jesus' return was nigh, that the end times were upon us and that any moment we'd face Armageddon. There's fear, there's guidance, strong declarations of faith and stirring warnings in this music. And you'd better believe that Dylan puts everything he has into this album. He sounds so committed, you can't help but believe the dedication. It's potent stuff, no matter your religious outlook.\n\nYou don't have to share the beliefs to appreciate the sincerity, or even to be moved by the outpouring of faith. You'll get portions of devotion and grace with condemnation and hellfire. And Dylan tends to work some magic when he is properly motivated. Considering the uneven quality of Dylan's 1980s albums, it is worth noting the high quality with which he started the decade.\n\nI think one reason \"Saved\" gets little love is that it tends to go unrepresented in compilations, and the period hasn't really gotten any love in the \"Bootleg Series\" collection so far. But some artists don't work well in a \"greatest hits\" or \"best of\" situation. In Dylan's case, there are precious few actual \"hits\" but so many high-quality compositions and performances. So maybe \"Saved\" also gets lost in the shuffle because of so many wonderful records. But with such great songs as \"Pressing On\" and \"In the Garden\" among the tracks, this is an album that really deserves reappraisal. This material is inspired, his performances top notch.\n\nI know, I know, reading about and listening to \"Christian music\" isn't always the cool thing to do. But I encourage you to listen to Dylan's take on the gospel/faith genre. When he tackled this material, it wasn't to tap into a solid commercial base. If anything, it put him on dangerous financial grounds. The guy refused to do his best-known songs in concert and would only perform his new, Christian-aligned material. Hard to entice old and new audiences with that. But artists follow their inspirations and instincts. Even if it was a path Dylan would soon abandon (at least in a direct musical fashion), it took great courage to pursue higher truths and find spiritual, personal fulfillment.\n\nAnd it led to a great album.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1980\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBilly Joel's \"Glass Houses.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Game.\"\n\nAC/DC's \"Back in Black.\"\n\nABBA's \"Super Trouper.\"\n\nJohn Lennon & Yoko Ono's \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nSome concept albums can feel overblown. Pretentious. Bloated.\n\nAnd taken at face value, a concept album that charts the successful opening and the eventual dilapidated closing of Chicago's Paradise Theatre, and also incorporates elements to mirror the evolving social and economic realities in contemporary times, certainly sounds like it could be, er, well ... overreaching.\n\nBut it is one of those rare marvels, a single-record concept album that works AND carries the concept throughout with enjoyable music, memorable melodies and some bombastic choruses.\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had three Styx albums in the house: \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces of Eight\" on vinyl, and \"Paradise Theatre\" on cassette. And while I spent most of my time with Beatles records, hearing the bombastic and catchy-as-heck music by Styx definitely grabbed my attention.\n\nWhen my father loaned me some of his cassettes, I was curious about the \"Paradise Theatre\" tape. I recognized a couple of songs (like \"Too Much Time on My Hands,\" \"The Best of Times\" and \"Snowblind\"), but the others? Brand new. And I remember my first listen. I was sitting next to my bed, with my dad's headphones on. When \"A.D. 1928\" started up, I had to check the cassette lineup. Isn't this \"The Best of Times?\" Nope! But it established the narrative musical thread. And it segues directly into \"Rockin' the Paradise,\" a very cool li'l rock track.\n\nI'm an unabashed Styx fan. I love the pure pop confection of \"Lorelei.\" I really dig the almost Beach Boys-esque arrangement of \"Mademoiselle\" (if you think about the \"20/20\" and \"Sunflower\" era of the Beach Boys, maybe you'll dig where I'm coming from). I think that all members of the band, but most especially Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and James Young, were able to tap into a spirit that is so American — bold, brash, occasionally dramatic but with an embrace for the good things in life. And \"Paradise Theatre,\" a No. 1 album for the group, should have helped establish the group's legacy in American music. And maybe it did, for those listeners who don't get too hung up on what's \"hip.\"\n\nBut maybe the album is better known for its controversy. If you Google backward messages and Styx, I'm sure you'll find everything you'd want to know about the Parents Music Resource Center and the allegations of satanic messages in the music, particularly \"Snowblind.\" It's a fun story, popular, but it just isn't true — Styx wasn't trying to warp minds with unholy images and messages. But I'm betting the headlines didn't hurt the band get some sales from curious younger (and older) listeners.\n\nStill, Styx is Styx. Bad headlines, bad reviews, bad impressions, polarization of fans in a \"Dennis camp\" or a \"Tommy Camp,\" Styx seems to regularly find itself on the receiving end of misfortune. It's a shame. But that's where I can let the music speak for itself.\n\nUnfortunately, good music or not, some bands seem easier to dismiss. As I've written before, Styx is one of those bands people say they just don't like. But if you give them a chance, and \"Paradise Theatre\" in particular, you might just hear a few songs (or a whole album) that you'll find refreshing. Set aside popularity contests, unburden yourself of the need to diss \"uncool\" music and give yourself permission to embrace the pop-rock goodness of Styx.\n\nOr just groove to \"Rockin' the Paradise\" in the safety of your car, bedroom or office.\n\nSo, whatcha doin' tonight?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1981\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Hard Promises.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Shot of Love.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Tattoo You.\"\n\nJoan Jett & The Blackhearts' \"I Love Rock 'n Roll.\"\n\nI read about it before I ever heard the record.\n\nI'm sure I was reading a John Lennon biography and I'd gotten to the post-murder material, when reactions and tributes were discussed. No doubt there was a mention of the track \"Here Today\" on \"Tug of War,\" Paul McCartney's first album to follow Lennon's death.\n\nThe curiosity was planted. Obviously, I knew some of McCartney's solo stuff. You couldn't be a big Beatles fan like I was and not have been exposed to \"Band on the Run\" and other material. But the only connections I had to most of the \"Tug of War\" material came from some of the songs being featured in McCartney's feature film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" (though in re-recorded form).\n\nHearing the album the first time, I was struck by the variety of styles and how McCartney's gift as a tunesmith hadn't been hurt by the loss of his friend and former songwriting partner. Even the oft-mocked \"Ebony and Ivory\" holds its own (yes, the white keys and black keys on a piano might actually lead to more dissonance than harmony, but Paul and Stevie Wonder still get the noble point across).\n\nTwo of my favorites on the album, \"Wanderlust\" and \"Ballroom Dancing,\" are pure McCartney — I can't imagine anyone else writing them. \"Wanderlust\" is a cousin to \"Mull of Kintyre,\" this irresistible melody that feels somehow timeless. \"Ballroom Dancing\" more fits the mold of \"When I'm 64,\" \"Your Mother Should Know\" and \"You Gave Me the Answer.\" It's the kind of song that would appeal to moms and grandmas, but with a bouncier track. Fun for the sake of fun.\n\nAnd what can be said about \"Here Today\" that hasn't been said over the years? Paul sings to John, and he is holding back the tears no more. If you've seen Paul perform the song in concert the last several years, he often does tear up, choke up, the emotions are palpable. Paul lost a brother, a partner, a rival, an important figure in his life. The song conveys that in every possible way.\n\nReally, when it comes right down to it, there aren't any songs I dislike on \"Tug of War.\" The title track and \"Take It Away\" are pure Paul at his best. And the album's other duet with Stevie Wonder, \"What's That You're Doing,\" basically lays the groundwork for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller.\" Stevie's scatting at the end is ... odd, but fun.\n\nThere are link tracks, brief interludes. Maybe some folks would call them scraps, or would find them jarring. Me, I find them to be emotional and creative transitions.\n\n\"Tug of War\" is an album that justifies every view of McCartney as a musician, for good or bad. It stands as a synthesis of McCartney's skills as a Beatle, as a solo artist and as the leader of Wings. And \"Tug of War\" climbed to No. 1. It established itself as a classic, one that sets a standard that all following McCartney albums have had to measure against.\n\nPaul weathered the storm after Lennon's untimely death, and emerged from the darkness with an album that still stands the test of time today. He endured his own internal and external tugs of war, and came out on top. You gotta respect that.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1982\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson's \"Shoot Out the Lights.\"\n\nQueen's \"Hot Space.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"The Nylon Curtain.\"\n\nPrince's \"1999.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Thriller.\"\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person when you talk about favorites. And you can learn a lot about Pink Floyd fans from their favorite albums.\n\nI honestly have different favorites based on my moods. Sometimes I want \"Wish You Were Here,\" sometimes I want \"Meddle,\" sometimes I want \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" etc.\n\nBut one album that I always find myself putting on the list, at No. 1 or No. 2, is \"The Final Cut.\"\n\nThe last studio album to feature Roger Waters, \"The Final Cut\" also is the first Pink Floyd album not to credit Richard Wright as a member. Tensions were high, creative differences had forced some unpleasant ultimatums, and group members David Gilmour and Nick Mason were shunted to the side and used basically as session players. Gilmour, who'd been one of the primary vocalists of the group from 1968-1977, had seen his vocal presence (and artistic input) diminish in the group as Waters took on more of the vocals and asserted himself as the creative force of the band. On \"The Final Cut,\" Gilmour contributes some tasty guitar lines, but he only features as the lead vocal on one track: \"Not Now John.\"\n\nThe drama aside, the narrative of the album is one of the group's strongest. It builds upon themes expressed in \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Animals\" and \"The Wall.\" The struggle to live life in a world controlled by corporate and military forces, humans treated as pawns in a global chess game, the loss of family, isolation, etc. You get it — not the cheeriest content. And how does the album end? \"Two Suns in the Sunset\" might give you all the clues you need. (No? Nuclear annihilation.)\n\nWaters' vocals are strong and expressive. The lyrics are personal, and illustrative. The album unfolds in such a cinematic fashion. And the production? Wow.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" polarizes fans. Some see it as Waters seizing ultimate control for his own glory, and attempting to tank the band. Some see it as the most powerful and focused album in the group's catalog. But with songs like \"Your Possible Pasts,\" \"The Hero's Return,\" \"The Gunner's Dream,\" \"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\" \"Southampton Dock\" and \"The Final Cut,\" it's impossible to dismiss it as artistically bankrupt.\n\nMy younger brother and I got into the album after we'd devoured \"The Wall.\" We were in our mid teens and that kind of power, that kind of imagery, that kind of angst was impossible to ignore. It was passionate. It was fearful. It was angry. And sadly, the themes of the album were still relevant. And they still are.\n\nArt endures, right? And while some of the references may have dated, the sense of betrayal to those who make the ultimate sacrifice, to the families who lose loved ones, to the people who work hard to live their lives only to have \"the powers that be\" control (and end) them, well ... I imagine many of us can understand that anger and identify with the emotional outpouring.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" may have been Waters' final work with Pink Floyd, but what a way to go. You can't ask for a better exit than this.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1983\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Police's \"Synchronicity.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"An Innocent Man.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Swordfishtrombones.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Infidels.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"Hearts and Bones.\"\n\nJohn Lennon was brutally killed on Dec. 8, 1980. He was shot outside of his home. And with his death, many of the dreams and hopes that had taken shape in the 1960s and had endured the 1970s came to an abrupt end. No possibility of a full Beatles reunion. No more collaborations with Paul McCartney. No more concerts. No more songs that were so personal and somehow universal at the same time. No more lyrical gobbledygook that captured the imagination.\n\nNo more Lennon songs.\n\nA couple weeks before his murder, Lennon had released \"Double Fantasy,\" a collaborative album with wife Yoko Ono. The album seemed to celebrate a mature outlook on life, a more domestically inclined point of view. Songs like \"(Just Like) Starting Over,\" \"Woman\" and \"Watching the Wheels\" were welcome additions to Lennon's output, and his song for son Sean — \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\" — is touching beyond words. But not everything was flowers and rainbows. \"I'm Losing You\" taps into a bit of anger and desperation, and \"Cleanup Time\" is pretty forward looking in how it was time to clear the slate and get moving again.\n\nThe album certainly set the stage for a follow up, one that could build on the positives established in \"Double Fantasy.\" And the material existed, as another album was being worked on simultaneously with \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nComing in early 1984, a full three years after Lennon's death, \"Milk and Honey\" gave fans some of the final fruits of Lennon's studio labors. And the songs on this new album were fun. Vital. Maybe even a little more scattered or casual. Obviously, the final polishing and mixing with Lennon's cooperation had never been done before his death. But the energy and off-the-cuff looseness of some of the performances make his songs on \"Milk and Honey\" easily the equals of those on \"Double Fantasy,\" and possibly even superior.\n\n\"Nobody Told Me\" may have been meant for Ringo Starr's \"Stop and Smell the Roses\" album, but Lennon's engaged vocal and the snappy arrangement make it one of my favorite late Lennon tracks. \"I'm Stepping Out\" has such a groove, and gives a few clues that Lennon's \"househusband\" role wasn't one he always embraced (just check out his vocal ad-libs near the end at the fade). \"I Don't Wanna Face It\" and \"Borrowed Time\" seem somehow ... foreboding, but without darkness or depression. It's like Lennon had a premonition that the end was near. Listen to the songs, tell me I'm wrong.\n\nAnd then there's \"Grow Old With Me.\" Oh, beautiful. Simple, and showing its home recording demo roots, the song was envisioned to become the kind of standard that people would play at weddings. It is beautiful, touching, sweet without being saccharine, and devastating considering Lennon's death.\n\nOno's contributions to \"Double Fantasy\" and \"Milk and Honey\" are pretty progressive, and show some skill. Ono will always have her detractors, but her songs work to both enhance Lennon's and also to provide artistic contrasts that may have been more commercially viable in the early 1980s than Lennon's own songs. Her talent should not be denied, nor should the loss she faced.\n\nThese albums stand as monuments to Lennon's life, his hopes for the future and for the love he had in his heart. There would be more posthumous releases, but \"Milk and Honey\" and its Lennon songs send the man off on a high note. The rock-and-roller, the guy with the mischievous twinkle in his eye, he was still there. And then he was gone.\n\nThe parting after \"Milk and Honey\" certainly was some sweet sorrow.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1984\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1984 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nVan Halen's \"1984.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Works.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"The Pros and cons of Hitch Hiking.\"\n\nSpinal Tap's \"This is Spinal Tap.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\"\n\nPrince's \"Purple Rain.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Let It Be.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Valotte.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nThe Meat Puppets' \"Meat Puppets II.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think life is just a rodeo / The trick is to ride and make it to the bell.\"\n\nKnow my first memory of John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\" album? It isn't the use of the title song at baseball games. It's of mowing.\n\nI'd been a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival's music for, well, pretty much my whole life. I can remember hearing the songs on the radio as a very young boy. One of the first cassettes I owned (a gift from my grandmother) was of CCR's \"Chronicle\" album, a great selection of the group's hits. Fogerty's voice is one of the greats in rock and roll.\n\nSo what does mowing have to do with \"Centerfield?\"\n\nI'd done some reading about Fogerty and CCR that mentioned the acrimony of the group's split. And I remember reading about the comeback that was Fogerty's 1985 album. So I got curious. I picked up a bargain bin copy of the album on cassette. I popped it into my Walkman and got on the riding lawnmower and started to mow.\n\nAnd wow! What an album. What a good, solid, punchy record.\n\nThe album starts off with a sound that is pure Creedence. \"The Old Man Down the Road\" has that classic Fogerty sneering drawl, a ridiculous guitar hook and a jumping rhythm. Apparently others thought it sounded like pure Creedence, too ... almost too pure. Fogerty was sued by the owner of Fantasy Records, the label CCR recorded for. It was alleged that Fogerty had plagiarized his own earlier work, ripping off \"Run Through the Jungle.\" Eventually the case closed in favor of Fogerty. But forget that. Just listen to the song, It cooks!\n\nAnd then there's \"Rock and Roll Girls,\" the song that opens with the lyrics I quoted at the start of this chapter. Fogerty's voice comes across so high and clear, a blast of summer sunshine and hope. \"Hey, let's go all over the world.\" It puts a rainbow in my mind, for sure.\n\nAnd of course, there's the title track. \"Centerfield\" and baseball, the song and the sport belong together. And when Fogerty performs the song in concert, he even uses a guitar shaped like a Louisville Slugger baseball bat. It's a history lesson and a vibe that all fans and participants of the sport can appreciate, can feel.\n\nThere are sounds that put this album clearly in the 1980s, but if you listen to the songs, if you listen to Fogerty as he sings and whoops, you could be forgiven for thinking this album slots in at the end of the 1960s, maybe between \"Willy and the Poor Boys\" and \"Cosmo's Factory.\" That's no faint praise, \"Centerfield\" is that solid, it's that classic sounding.\n\nSome voices in music just have the right feel. A little sandpaper here, a little smoke, the right amount of power and an absolute sense of purpose. Fogerty has one of those voices. His vocals reach you all the way out in center field, and his songwriting just tends to feel comfortable. Lived in. Real. Like an old ball glove, perfectly worn, battle tested and trustworthy.\n\nIt'll be several months until green grass pokes through and we're enjoying another season of baseball.\n\nBut that's OK. We have \"Centerfield.\" And say, do you smell something? I swear, it smells just like freshly cut grass ...\n\nHonorable mentions, 1985\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Southern Accents.\"\n\nDire Straits' \"Brothers in Arms.\"\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Dare to Be Stupid.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Rain Dogs.\"\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Psychocandy.\"\n\nWhen you hear \"Graceland,\" what's the first thought that comes to your mind?\n\nElvis Presley, maybe?\n\nI'd understand that. And hey, Elvis, the King of rock and roll. The man who inspired so many major artists of the 1960s. The swiveling hips, the curling lip. You ain't nothing but a hound dog!\n\nSo if an artist names an album \"Graceland,\" maybe you'd expect ... what? A tribute album? An album in the style of Elvis? Or at the very least, maybe a record recorded at the site?\n\nBut if you're giving Paul Simon's \"Graceland\" a spin, you aren't gonna get that. Any of that. Sure, the title track mentions Elvis' estate. The narrator (Simon) is traveling with his son. For reasons he can't explain, some part of him wants to see Graceland (in Memphis, Tennessee). But after that? Not much Big E.\n\nBut that's OK. In fact, it's more than OK. Paul Simon may have wanted to find something new. He may have wanted inspiration. He may have wanted to visit the site of Elvis' home, to try to plug into the spirit that may have once moved him, but this new album and the songs on it are a big departure. His muse took him to South Africa. Rhythms, complex vocal arrangements, energy ... \"Graceland\" has all the promise and mystery and soul one might expect from Presley's manor, but it all comes in an unexpected direction. Elvis grew up with gospel and soul music, American \"black\" music. Simon comes back with mbaqanga and isicathamiya, South African \"black\" music.\n\nYou get the parallels?\n\nOK, OK, so let's get to the music. It's fresh. It's fantastic. The record came out in 1986 and it still feels so different than what we hear so regularly on TV, radio, the Internet, etc. While the genre of \"world music\" has grown, I still don't expect that I could just spin a dial on the Minnesota AM/FM spectrum and come across Ladysmith Black Mambazo unless it is one of the \"Graceland\" songs the group sings on.\n\nDepending on who you are, that isn't necessarily a good thing. But for me? It opened my ears to different music. Not just genres, like rap or country or rockabilly. Hearing music made in different styles, with different instruments, in arrangements we wouldn't consider conventional because of our Western mindset, it was (and still is) kinda exciting.\n\nOh, \"The Boy in the Bubble.\" THE SOUND. You can be completely consumed in that track. \"These are the days of miracle and wonder,\" indeed. Then there's the title track (I just love the lyric \"the Mississippi Delta was shining like a national guitar\" ... not only because it refers to resonator guitars, but because you can also consider the Mississippi River and the music that has grown out of the blues traditions around it to be a national treasure, a national emblem).\n\nI figure just about everyone knows \"You Can Call Me Al,\" even if you haven't heard any of the other songs. And the video with Simon with Chevy Chase is pretty fun. But what about the other gems on the album? \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"Under African Skies,\" \"Homeless\" and \"That Was Your Mother\" are so vital. And ... can you hear country music in the background? Is that a hint of rockabilly? Sweet lord, that guitar is cooking. Rock and roll!\n\nI guess it doesn't matter if you are visiting Elvis' Graceland or if you're just drawing inspiration from it, maybe there's something transcendent in the experience. Something motivational in the place, in the man, in his music. Maybe it takes you on a search, until you find just the right something, the right sound, the right instrument, the right collaborators. Something that encourages a kind of musical alchemy, a combination of cultures and sounds that leads to vibrant, beautiful sound.\n\nThe music hits us in different ways, takes us down different paths. The journey is what's important, and what you take from it. An appreciation of other cultures? A love for new sounds? What you find on the path is all that matters. And I've reason to believe we all will be received in \"Graceland.\"\n\nHonorable mentions, 1986\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nPeter Gabriel's \"So.\"\n\nQueen's \"A Kind of Magic.\"\n\nMadonna's \"True Blue.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys' \"Licensed to Ill.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"Deep in the Heart of Nowhere.\"\n\nYou know, I really had no idea that \"Got My Mind Set on You\" was George Harrison.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong. I know he didn't write it. But that sound, that song, that voice ... I'd heard it all over the radio. I remember hearing older kids singing bits of it when I was 9 or 10. That hook. \"I got my mind / SET ON YOU.\" Sure, now that I'm older and pay attention to things like voices, of course it's George Harrison.\n\nBut when I picked up my first copy of \"Cloud Nine,\" I really had no idea.\n\nI picked up a used copy of a CD after The Beatles' Anthology project wrapped up. I'd loved a lot of George's Beatles music, and I owned a couple of the solo albums (\"All Things Must Pass\" is an essential album, gotta have it), but I had never really made an effort to pick up his solo works.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nHere's the thing: John Lennon and Paul McCartney get all the credit for The Beatles. I get it, they were two of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, one of the most powerful songwriting partnerships. But the sound? That took the whole group. And after The Beatles broke up, Lennon went one way with his sound and McCartney went another. But Harrison? Listen to his music. I often think that George may have been the musical glue of the group. When I listen to \"Cloud Nine,\" I hear what The Beatles could have sounded like had they gotten together in 1986 to start putting a record together. The Rolling Stones had \"Dirty Work,\" and I think this sound could have easily skunked that.\n\nBut this isn't about The Beatles, It's about Harrison's last album released while he was still alive. And it is song after song of great quality. Yes, the album \"suffers\" from the 1980s production and Jeff Lynne's bright touches (as you can probably tell, I don't think the album \"suffers\" at all ... I like the lively sound).\n\nThe opening track is also the song from which the album takes its name, and I love that bass sound, the funkier feel. Starting off the album with this kind of track is brave, in that it isn't a sure-fire hook-driven ear grabber, but it is a wonderful song. Then you launch into other terrific songs. \"That's What It Takes,\" \"Fish on the Sand,\" both songs I really got into.\n\nBut the big songs? \"This Is Love\" is catchy and strident; you feel the breeze behind you. \"When We Was Fab\" recalls \"I Am the Walrus\" and certainly comes across as a tribute to the fallen Lennon. And if you don't love \"Devil's Radio,\" well ... maybe you just like your gossip too much.\n\nAnd there's the last song on the album ... \"Got My Mind Set on You.\" It has that 1980s sound, but with a real feel. The singing is true, and you buy into the music. Go on, listen. If you're not tapping your toe, bobbing your head, snapping your fingers or singing along, maybe your ears aren't working.\n\nThere would be some music released posthumously, and there was the Traveling Wilburys music as well, but \"Cloud Nine\" was the last album of original material to bear George's name while he still walked the earth. And what a joy it is, what a revelation. It feels so good, it makes you feel good. In a way, it puts you on your own cloud nine. Nice when the music lives up to its name, isn't it?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1987\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nU2's \"The Joshua Tree.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Radio K.A.O.S.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Pleased to Meet Me.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Bad.\"\n\nR.E.M.'s \"Document.\"\n\nAll things considered, I'm a relatively recent convert to Beach Boys / Brian Wilson fandom. But as happens with so many converts, I have a tremendous zeal and loyalty now that I'm in the tent.\n\nAnd when I was first digging into Brian Wilson's solo catalog, there wasn't a lot to track down. At the time, the only legitimate releases were Brian's self-titled solo debut, the \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" soundtrack, the \"Imagination\" album and his \"Live at the Roxy\" release. (The Van Dyke Parks collaboration \"Orange Crate Art\" is quite good, but Wilson contributes only vocals to it). And the only one of the bunch I could actually buy in stores at the time was \"Imagination.\"\n\nI think \"Imagination\" gets a bad rap. For me, it is one of those perfect summer albums. And I listened to it a lot in the summer of 1998.\n\nBut the summer of 1999? I spent it with Wilson's 1988 effort.\n\nIf you've seen this year's \"Love & Mercy\" film starring Paul Dano and John Cusack, it is this album that Brian is working on with Eugene Landy when Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) tries to help Wilson break free.\n\nStrip away the history and the drama (and some of that late 1980s production), and you get some pretty great songs. \"Pet Sounds '88\" might be a bit of a stretch, but it was still the finest collection at the time of Brian Wilson tunes since 1977's \"Love You\" (or 1968's \"Friends\" album).\n\nFrom 1997-99, I was hitting eBay regularly. I bought a lot of Beach Boys / Brian Wilson material (legit and bootleg). And my first copy of Wilson's debut album was an eBay purchase. I remember the excitement I had as I ripped open the mailing packaging to find the CD looking up at me. (I still dig the cover art ... I feel oceans and darkness and light in it).\n\nAs for the music: Want a timeless ballad, with a lot of spirituality and heart? You get \"Love and Mercy.\" Want a cool rock tune? \"Walkin' the Line\" (and its footstep percussion) might get you where you want to go. Want some lovely vocals and that traditional Beach Boys harmony? You have got to try \"Melt Away.\" That's three-for-three in great tunes, and all at the front of the album.\n\nIf you like something a bit more challenging, a bit more progressive, something more \"pocket symphony\" like the \"SMiLE\" music, give \"Rio Grande\" a shot.\n\nMy favorite track on the album is \"Meet Me In My Dreams Tonight.\" The arrangement, the sounds, the sleigh bells! It's Brian freaking Wilson, man! Here he is! He's still got it. And is that a little bit of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in there? Shhhhh ... (And before I forget, I've gotta give a lot of praise to producer, musician, singer and songwriter Andy Paley for meeting the challenges, collaborating with Brian, getting the best out of him, giving Brian the immediacy and versatility he demands in the studio).\n\nWhen the album came out, it received a lot of praise from critics. And the Brian Wilson faithful rallied around it. But it was a different Beach Boys-related project that got the success. \"Kokomo\" came out and it became the sound of The Beach Boys, the song of the summer and the major hit.\n\nYou can say what you want about \"Kokomo\" (and EVERYBODY has an opinion), but none of it changes the fact that Wilson's solo debut is a work of tremendous talent and skill. It feels like an old friend. And that's because the music is from an old friend. An old friend who saw a world full of sex and violence and upheaval, and offered up a little hymn that gives everyone a little bit of what they need — a comforting helping of love and mercy.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1988\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nLeonard Cohen's \"I'm Your Man.\"\n\nKeith Richards' \"Talk Is Cheap.\"\n\nFreddie Mercury's and Montserrat Caballe's \"Barcelona.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Daydream Nation.\"\n\nMy first introduction to The Beastie Boys has nothing to do with \"Paul's Boutique.\" But we'll get to the album soon, I promise.\n\nMy introduction didn't even come from the ubiquitous \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\" No, even that came later.\n\nI got introduced to The Beasties from the unlikely source of \"Beavis and Butt-head.\" At least, that's my memory. I remember my brother and I enjoying some parentless cable TV time and watching a \"moron-a-thon.\" And in one of the episodes, I seem to recall one of the music videos showing this really cheesy, 1970s-influenced cop schtick scene. But that music was so insistent. There was nothing schtick about it.\n\nThe song was \"Sabotage,\" and it is still one of my favorite Beastie Boys songs. But we always tend to have special feelings for our firsts, right?\n\nIt was in the later 1990s, after high school graduation, maybe even during my freshman year of college, when I heard bits of Beatles songs being worked into this, well, audio collage. What the heck is this?\n\nAnd that, my friends, was how I found \"Paul's Boutique.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys made heavy use of samplings in their music. What makes \"Paul's Boutique\" so special over many other artists and albums that feature the same technique is that The Beasties were very, very, very unfettered in their use of other people's music. And The Beatles' material had never really seen that kind of use in anything before. It maybe even led to some artists and companies to re-examine their policies and restrictions, because of lawsuits (and threats of lawsuits) from the blatant sampling.\n\n(As a brief aside: A lot of the music sampled actually did have permission given for use. But The Beastie Boys paid a lot less for the samples than would become the standard. It is unlikely you'd see people being able to sample Beatles music in such a way again, because it would be so cost prohibitive.)\n\nI don't think it'd be unfair to suggest that \"Paul's Boutique\" changed the industry and shook up hip-hop. It wasn't just in the sampling, either. There are references, musically and lyrically, that work together to create these huge messages and homages. And the variety! This isn't \"thrown in a blender and see what happens\" material. Nor is it noise, for the sake of sound. This is an elaborate aural tapestry, where everything has its place.\n\nThe lyrics are still pretty great today. Consider this material, from \"Shadrach\":\n\n\"It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it / I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic.\n\n\"For those about to rock, we salute you / The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to.\n\n\"I once was lost but now I'm found / The music washes over and you're one with the sound.\"\n\nThese guys knew what they were doing, from the sampling and to the allegations of how they were contributing to the delinquency of younger listeners, but it also revels in this music. Not just their music, but the music that came before them, the music that they use to contribute to their own sound. Ya know, if it wasn't for the rapping and sampling and the arrangements, this follows a lot of the folk tradition of appropriation.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute ...\n\nOne of the issues I see in classifying music under any kind of genre is that it is package-to-sell labeling. And if you are packaging to sell, you also are packaging to avoid. \"I don't like rap, and that is in the rap section, so I won't like it.\" Ditto country, rock, metal, etc.\n\nBut if you listen to \"Paul's Boutique,\" you get a lot of styles. It's not just hip-hop. It's not just using The Beatles or following usual hip-hop tropes of being \"bad\" or substance abuse or violence. There's complexity, sophistication. Would it go too far to say this material is literate, skilled? No. It'd be totally fair. What's even cooler is that it isn't pretentious, it isn't beating you over the head with a \"look how clever we are\" vibe. It's just, simply, great.\n\nGive The Beastie Boys their due, they were true MCs. They'd do more albums, including the \"Ill Communication\" album that features the song \"Sabotage,\" but my favorite remains \"Paul's Boutique.\" I get something new every time I listen to it.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1989\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1989 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nLou Reed's \"New York.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Prayer.\"\n\nTom Petty's \"Full Moon Fever.\"\n\nThe Cure's \"Disintegration.\"\n\nThe Stone Roses' \"The Stone Roses.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Flowers in the Dirt.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Bleach.\"\n\nDon Henley's \"The End of the Innocence.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Steel Wheels.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Oh Mercy.\"\n\nBefore I get to the actual assessment of the They Might Be Giants' album \"Flood,\" I really have to apologize.\n\nIn high school, a good friend of mine tried to get me to give the album a chance. But I was really heavily into The Beatles at the time, and I considered everything else inferior music. And not just inferior, but irrelevant.\n\nTo my friend: I am sorry.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't listen to the music with open ears. There's some fun stuff here! (\"Dead\" is one heck of a trip.) There's some serious stuff cloaked as fun stuff, too. (\"Your Racist Friend\" is some great social commentary.) There's some classic singalong goofiness. (\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" is just so oddly compelling.) There's a great cover song. (\"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" is catchy and fun, the kind to crank loudly in the car.)\n\nI'm sorry I didn't appreciate the variety. There's brevity (\"Minimum Wage\" and its whip, ha!), there's comic book hijinx (\"Particle Man\") and great grooves (\"Whistling in the Dark\").\n\nAnd I'm sorry that I was so caught up in the greatness that IS The Beatles that I couldn't appreciate that other music was also great, on its own terms. It took a while, but I got there. I learned that fun music, and pop music, and all kinds of music, are all as important and vital as anything \"serious\" or \"classic.\"\n\nSo ... about the album \"Flood.\"\n\nIt's pretty darn good. It is the kind of album you can love as a 9-year-old or as a 19-year-old or as a 29-year-old. Different jokes hit you as funnier when you have your own experiences. And some remain oddly touching. I first heard \"Particle Man\" as a boy, in an episode of \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" the spinoff of \"Looney Tunes.\" The lyric seemed so easy, and the animation of the cartoon suited it so well. So when I hear the song today, I remember watching the cartoons with my younger brother, and I remember that video. Funny how we can be sentimental about such light fare.\n\nHow often do you laugh out loud at music that isn't parody, or that isn't strictly comedy music? Because this is real music. And it isn't all laughs and grins. It just doesn't take itself too seriously. The group, the songs, the album all have this open-door communication that is almost childlike without being childish. Sounds and textures and words that come out as these very colorful expressions.\n\nAhhhh, \"Dead.\" Coming back as a bag of groceries? How'd TMBG get there? No idea. But bless the quirkiness. Sometimes off-the-wall is just what you need. Let the world wash away for a bit with \"Flood,\" you'll come out of the album feeling refreshed.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1990\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nWilson Phillips' \"Wilson Phillips.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Vegetarians of Love.\"\n\nDread Zeppelin's \"Un-Led-Ed.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"The Rhythm of the Saints.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.\"\n\nConsidering that Freddie Mercury was dying, and that he knew he was dying, and that his bandmates knew he was dying, \"Innuendo\" could have been a very dark, very sad, very downbeat album.\n\nAnd while the album certainly has its reflective and introspective moments, songs that touch on mortality, \"Innuendo\" is one of the best Queen albums released in several years. It was the last Queen album released before Mercury's death in late 1991, and it sounds like a return to the progressive hey-days of the 1970s albums like \"Queen II,\" \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races.\" Whereas the 1980s seemed to latch on to R&B, dance music and middle-of-the-road chart pleasers (and I'm not knocking any of that), the edge and energy and charisma in the music was lacking.\n\nSongs like \"The Show Must Go On\" and \"These are the Days of Our Lives\" cannot be seen in any other context than through Mercury's impending death. But the former is active, raging at the dying of the light. \"I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with the show!\" I get chills. And the latter is touching, a love song, a song that finds peace in the immutable truth that we all go someday, to enjoy the days we have. \"I still love you.\" Freddie's last four words of the song drive it home.\n\nThe title track recalls the days when the band would construct elaborate multi-section songs, like \"March of the Black Queen,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Prophet's Song.\" And the song, written and intended as a sort of homage to Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir,\" succeeds as a modern Queen epic. It is masterful, powerful and fabulous.\n\n\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\" seems an exercise in bizarre one-liners, and \"Delilah\" is really just a charming ode to one of Freddie's favorite cats (you won't find another song with the lyric \"And then you make me slightly mad / when you pee all over my Chippendale suite\").\n\nWant something a little more rock and roll? \"Headlong\" is more of a traditional rocker, and certainly would have made a concert staple had Mercury been healthy and the band had toured.\n\nAnd the beauty of \"Bijou\" ... rather than being a Queen track that's mostly vocal with a guitar solo, the guitar is the main presence and Freddie's vocal is the solo. And the singing and lyrics are so touching, so wonderful, that I ache every time I listen to the song:\n\n\"You and me, we are destined / you'll agree ...\n\n\"To spend the rest of our lives with each other / the rest of our days like two lovers ...\n\n\"Forever, yeah forever ...\"\n\nFreddie knew he was dying, and he puts his heart into that short lyric. It is electrifying, crushing and breathtaking all at once.\n\nThat's the album in a nutshell: Electrifying, crushing and breathtaking. Every element that had made Queen so great, so alluring, so fun and fabulous, is right here on this album. It was a grand, eclectic, satisfying work with which to bow out.\n\nThere'd be more music after Freddie passed, including the \"Made in Heaven\" album that featured Freddie's last works before he succumbed to AIDS. There'd be live albums issued, and so many compilations of the band's work. Queen's legacy will never fade, the music retains its power and catches new generations by storm with regularity.\n\nFreddie went out on a high note, and who could ask for anything more?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1991\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Gish.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Into the Great Wide Open.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Help Yourself.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Nevermind.\"\n\nMy Bloody Valentine's \"Loveless.\"\n\nEven if it was only \"Drive\" on this record, \"Automatic for the People\" would top my list for the year.\n\nWith \"Drive,\" I was unexpectedly pulled out of contemporary sounds and was rocketed back to ... when? I don't know. Some 1850s Western setting? A 1950s Western TV show? The song has this guitar progression and effect that brings to mind cowboys. It kind of reminds me of Bon Jovi's \"Wanted Dead or Alive,\" but I prefer R.E.M.'s take.\n\nBut the song has transitions and a build in strings, it has processing, it's kind of a throwback sound with a futuristic process. Make sense? No? Just listen.\n\nAnd \"Automatic for the People\" isn't limited just to the glory of \"Drive.\" As far as the well-known songs are concerned, it also boasts \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,\" \"Everybody Hurts,\" \"Man on the Moon\" and \"Nightswimming.\" That's a veritable greatest hits collection right off the bat (even if some, like \"Everybody Hurts,\" got overplayed and overexposed to the point where it's hard to listen to the music without an automatic groan).\n\nThe first copy of \"Automatic for the People\" that I owned came in used condition from a store I worked at, and it came into my possession years after the album was recorded. And though it kind of embarrasses me to admit it, I bought it because of the \"Man on the Moon\" song, which had been used as the title song to an Andy Kaufman movie starring Jim Carrey. I liked the song, I got curious, I looked for the original album (avoiding the film's soundtrack). When I found which album the song was on, and saw some familiar song titles rounding out the album, I pulled out my wallet.\n\nYou ever have that one album that is just bliss on a first listen? Where every song seems to hang together, weaving some kind of beyond-words perfection? \"Automatic for the People\" was that kind of record for me. Even when \"Everybody Hurts\" had its turn in the sequence, I was amazed at how much I actually enjoyed hearing it in the album context. It hung as part of the record's fabric. Whereas radio listens never did much for me, hearing it as a part of the greater whole made a kind of sense to me.\n\nAnd of course, I was transfixed by opening track \"Drive.\" I grabbed my brother and played it for him, and we both saw it as an incredibly picturesque, vivid soundscape with a vocal that struck something inside us. I STILL don't know whythat song resonates with me, but it does. \"Drive\" remains one of my all-time favorite R.E.M. songs, and it feels like a major piece just waiting for the right exposure to become a mammoth anthem. The album only came out in 1992, there's still time ...\n\n\"Automatic for the People\" has its big majestic moments, but largely feels more intimate, more pared down. It is music that demands to be taken seriously, with lyrics that insist upon being heard. Everyone has their favorite R.E.M. records, but I don't think the group has ever topped the glory or the beauty of this record.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1992\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1992 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nGreen Day's \"Kerplunk.\"\n\nThey Might Be Giants' \"Apollo 18.\"\n\nRingo Starr's \"Time Takes Time.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Dirty.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Gordon.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Amused to Death.\"\n\nSugar's \"Copper Blue.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Bone Machine.\"\n\nBlind Melon's \"Blind Melon.\"\n\nDr. Dre's \"The Chronic.\"\n\nEvery time I listen to \"In Utero,\" I get a tingle of electricity down my spine.\n\nEvery time.\n\nThere's something in the music, something in the sound, something in Kurt Cobain's voice and in the band's collective presence. Something primal and pure, it strikes right at the nervous system.\n\nThere's no doubt that \"Nevermind\" is the group's commercial masterpiece, but \"In Utero\" is my favorite. It's a more organic record, it's got such a punk discipline in sound. The songs feel immediate, even now, more than 20 years after the album's release. Every note, every jagged shot of feedback, every howl feels so precisely perfect on a record that was to be the antithesis to precise perfection.\n\nI've written about Cobain and Nirvana before, and touched on my love for the \"In Utero\" album. But sometimes words fail to convey the power that music holds on you, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nIsolate that bassline to \"Heart Shaped Box\" and tell me that isn't the most supremely wicked, fascinatingly dark sound you can conjure. (You can tell me otherwise, but I'll disagree with you.) I think you could release just that bassline for Halloween CDs and it'd be massively popular in its own right.\n\nListen to that overblown surf guitar sound on \"Serve the Servants.\" Surf guitar sound? How so? Man, imagine Dick Dale in plaid, with emotional baggage, more than a little anger and the commercial clout to do whatever he wants. Then get back to me. The guitar skips and dives, runs up and down, it jitters and it conjures frantic power. 'Nuff said.\n\nListen to the words of \"Dumb.\" \"I think I'm just happy.\" I mean, doesn't that say something to you? Have you ever been able to relate to a mindset where something negative might actually be positive, or vice versa? Sniffing glue? Floating on clouds? The lyrics maybe sound like teenage foolishness, but dig the sound with it. The song is like a burned-out daydream.\n\nOh, \"Pennyroyal Tea.\" How many people did I know when I was growing up who tried to make this concoction? And how many songs do you know that manage to work \"cherry-flavored antacids\" into the lyric? And that sound ... Desperation? I don't know, but it has a soothing quality to it.\n\nWhen I think of all the great work Nirvana did, all the excellent material recorded in the various incarnations of the group, and I reflect on what was lost when Cobain died, the first thing that comes to mind isn't the immortal \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" or the baby in the swimming pool cover of \"Nevermind.\" It is the power and depth of \"In Utero.\"\n\n\"In Utero\" was everything that was scary and unfettered and powerful in Nirvana. It was everything honest and dishonest and playful. \"In Utero\" is power and introversion, combined, a sonic and emotional powerhouse that darn few can claim to approach in quality. John Lennon's \"Plastic Ono Band\" is the only album that I'd put above \"In Utero\" for the complete catharsis and pain and psyche examination found in the music.\n\nNot bad for a record recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Minnesota's own Cannon Falls.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1993\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Happy Club.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Off the Ground.\"\n\nAerosmith's \"Get a Grip.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Siamese Dream.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"River of Dreams.\"\n\nI was driving back from a Boy Scouts camping trip when my friend asked, \"Do you listen to much Johnny Cash?\"\n\nI didn't. As I've written elsewhere, my parents weren't big on country music. But I knew some of the big Cash songs, like \"Ring of Fire,\" Walk the Line\" and those early hits. So I told my friend, \"I know a couple songs, but not enough to call myself a fan or anything.\"\n\nHe said, \"Oh, you have to try out this album. It is track after track of good stuff.\" And he handed me a copy of Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings.\"\n\nI admit, I didn't get to it right away. I imagine you've been in the situation where people loan you music, encourage you to try it, piling adjective upon adjective so that you'll listen to it ... but you're just really not that interested. It is no reflection on that music itself, it's more of your state of mind.\n\nAfter a couple weeks, I had nothing going on and was starting to feel bad that I was still borrowing the album and hadn't even tried it. So I popped it in.\n\nWhat can I say? I liked it. But I didn't love it. It sounded good, I liked the variety. \"The Beast in Me\" and \"Drive On\" were pretty cool, and \"Thirteen\" was a dark classic. I enjoyed pretty much all of the songs, but none of them made me want to drop what I was doing and devote my full attention to the record. So I returned the CD to my friend, thanked him, offered a few bland compliments (\"Boy, he sure sounds good on this album\") and moved on.\n\nFast forward five or more years, to when I was living in St. Cloud. Mick Hatten and I were having one of our many music talks, and the discussion turned to Johnny Cash in general and the American albums, in particular. Beyond having heard the first album and then enjoying some of the songs on \"IV,\" I had nothing much to contribute. So Mick loaded me up and my education began.\n\nWhile the \"American Recordings\" album in its own right isn't my favorite of the series, it is nonetheless a landmark album and a treat from start to finish. It is a record that tends to feel like an old friend, a record you enjoy spending time with whenever you put it on. Listening to Cash's voice soar on \"Down There by the Train\" is a treat, and his recitation of \"Delia's Gone\" is by turns sorrowful and regretful, then plainspoken and matter-of-fact.\n\nWithout the \"American Recordings\" album and the series of records under the American label, Cash's legacy would still have been strong and defined by a number of hits and stylistic evolutions. However, the American albums created a foundation for a new image, perhaps even a new myth, of the man in black. The quality was supremely high, the content varied, the myriad styles somehow all brought under the sound of Cash's guitar and voice. He proved himself the master of song, of any song.\n\nAnd that is made abundantly clear on the first record of the American series. For that reason alone, \"American Recordings\" should be feted.\n\nWhat about Tom Petty?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1994 is Tom Petty's \"Wildflowers.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1994\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1994 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nGreen Day's \"Dookie.\"\n\nBeck's \"Mellow Gold.\"\n\nNine Inch Nails' \"The Downward Spiral.\"\n\nSoundgarden's \"Superunknown.\"\n\nPink Floyd's \"The Division Bell.\"\n\nHole's \"Live Through This.\"\n\nWeezer's \"Weezer (Blue Album).\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys' \"Ill Communication.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Voodoo Lounge.\"\n\nJeff Buckley's \"Grace.\"\n\nOasis' \"Definitely Maybe.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Bedtime Stories.\"\n\nNirvana's \"MTV Unplugged in New York.\"\n\nThe Eagles' \"Hell Freezes Over.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Live at the BBC.\"\n\nThe new Beatles, man! The biggest thing to hit music since Elvis! The best songs since (insert artist here) gave us (insert song here)!\n\nGet the point?\n\nOK, all those qualities may be exaggerations, but in 1995 all the hyperbole was in the air, on TV and in the trades. It sure felt true, at the time.\n\nAnd \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" was the album that sealed it. Whether or not you liked Oasis, you couldn't have gone through the 1990s without hearing \"Wonderwall\" or \"Champagne Supernova.\" It sounded enough like 1960s pop that oldies stations would play it, and it was a bright pop sound, so it did well on contemporary stations.\n\nI was 15 at the time, and my devotion to The Beatles was nearing its peak. What was this blasphemy? A new Beatles? Hadn't this label been used before? (The Knack come to mind.) Was music so creatively bankrupt that soundalikes were the only way to make it big?\n\nAh, but then, I hadn't heard any of the music. And judging any artist or album without hearing the music for yourself is always bad policy (beware of tastemakers who encourage you to skip something on their say-so ... you have your own ears).\n\nSo I gave the album a listen, and I loved it. The next Beatles? Yes, that was an exaggeration. But darned if the album didn't sound really good. My favorites were \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" (which truly does sound Beatles-esque) and \"She's Electric,\" which to this day is one of my favorite Britpop songs. \"There's lots and lots for us to do / she is electric, can I be electric too?\" Gets me every time.\n\nIn the 1990s, if you were into the Britpop sound, you tended to either be in the Oasis camp or the Blur camp. I didn't listen to Blur much, and I still haven't. I'm sure Damon Albarn and company are great, but ... I had Oasis. I was pretty comfortable with that selection.\n\nOf course, the band's lineup changed over the years. And then brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher had yet another huge falling out (shades of The Kinks and their brothers, Ray and Dave Davies) and Oasis split.\n\nConsidering the \"next Beatles\" label that Oasis itself was pinned with, I won't go so far as to say that we'll never see the like of Oasis again. But records like \"Definitely Maybe\" and \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" reflect just how good it was to have the band while it was here. And if you haven't already, check out \"Don't Believe the Truth\" and \"Dig Out Your Soul,\" the band's last two albums. The band went out the way it came in, with two excellent albums and a high bar set for its contemporaries.\n\nSo if you enjoy some good British pop music, with a solid back beat and catchy guitar solos and plenty of \"that sounds like ...\" hooks, you can do far worse than revisiting this Oasis classic. As their song \"Roll With It\" suggests, \"don't let anybody get in your way.\" The album was big for a reason, no shame in enjoying it now. Who cares what some might say?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1995\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1995 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nRadiohead's \"The Bends.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"I Should Coco.\"\n\nAlanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nThe Presidents of the United States of America's \"The Presidents of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Clouds Taste Metallic.\"\n\nShane MacGowan and the Popes' \"The Snake.\"\n\nGreen Day's \"Insomniac.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Return of the Rentals.\"\n\nQueen's \"Made in Heaven.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 1.\"\n\nWhen I first heard Weezer's \"Pinkerton,\" I hated it. Like, HATED it.\n\nMy best friend got me into Weezer, with their debut album, and it took me a while to get into it. But once I got there, I really enjoyed it. Songs like \"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\" left a big mark on me, and I had a set belief in how the band should sound and the kinds of songs it should perform.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" took those notions and tossed them into the trash.\n\nThe sound was raw, dark. Where were the peppy, geeky kind of songs? I sure didn't hear them in the mix of songs about sex, lesbians and Japanese girls.\n\nAfter the success of Weezer's debut album (known affectionately as the \"Blue Album\"), group leader and main songwriter Rivers Cuomo went to Harvard. He wrote about some confusion, some anger, some physical ailments (walking with an old man's cane), and it all took this kind of anguished, introverted atmosphere.\n\nIf you wanted more \"Buddy Holly,\" you didn't get it. Instead, you got the grandfather of emo records. \"Getchoo\" maybe puts things in the proper perspective: \"This is beginning to hurt, this is beginning to be serious.\" The sound is live, the bass thrums and guitar lines are jagged. Cuomo gives some of his best tuneful howls, and \"Pinkerton\" becomes this great flood of passion and pain.\n\nBut on the first few listens, it just seemed like noise. Melodic noise, anthemic noise, but noise nonetheless.\n\nI think my younger brother caught on to it before I did, really. He listened to it with more regularity, and stuff started to sink in. I started to get into songs like \"The Good Life\" (a song I'll always associate with my brother), and I enjoyed the intricate lyrics of \"Across the Sea.\" And album closer \"Butterfly\" has such a wistful tune and ends with the words \"I'm sorry,\" in a straight-from-the-heart voice.\n\nAnd I think that kind of emotional and stylistic purity is what keeps \"Pinkerton\" so fresh and important to me. Strip away the Ric Ocasek production from the first album, get back to a sound more like a live experience, then dig deep into affairs of the heart and mind and then let loose as microphones pick up the crashing drums, the angry guitars and the exasperated vocals.\n\nThis, my friends, is all your growing-up angst and all those late-at-night-and-in-the-dark thoughts, thrown onto an audio canvas.\n\nAfter I'd finally given in and gave up my prejudices on how Weezer music should sound, I got heavily emotionally invested in the record. Bitter disappointment on the love front? Sure, I can relate. A general feeling of isolation and loneliness? Heck, who doesn't feel that from time to time? Feeling like you're a million miles away from someone who could make everything feel better? Oh, sure, if you've got a romantic stripe in you, you've had to have felt that sometime in your life.\n\n\"This is beginning to hurt,\" indeed. But thanks for hanging in there, Weezer. The pain led to a masterpiece.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1996\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1996 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Bad Hair Day.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 2.\"\n\nSuperdrag's \"Regretfully Yours.\"\n\nThe Wallflowers' \"Bringing Down the Horse.\"\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers' \"Hot.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Songs and Music from 'She's the One.'\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"That Thing You Do!\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 3.\"\n\nWilco's \"Being There.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"Unchained.\"\n\nI came to Radiohead's \"OK Computer\" in an unusual way.\n\nI was a sophomore in college and I was playing an online game, and one of my friends on the game was a fella from Australia. We were talking about music, and I was undoubtedly gushing about Pink Floyd (my musical obsession at the time). He asked me about what I liked about Pink Floyd's music. I undoubtedly went into long rhapsodies about the song constructions, how some of the music has an organic buildup, that I could get washed away in blankets of sound, that the lyrics had an odd way of peering into neglected nooks and crannies that other music never penetrated.\n\n\"I think I know what you mean,\" he said. \"You've got to give Radiohead's 'OK Computer' a try.\"\n\nI'd heard, and even liked, other Radiohead material before this recommendation. But \"OK Computer\" was virgin territory for me.\n\nCurious, I eventually wandered out to a store and picked up a copy.\n\nAnd I really wasn't sure how I felt about it, even after a handful of listens. How did my love of Pink Floyd music lead me here?\n\n\"OK Computer\" and its lyrics weren't necessarily personal, they were more abstract. But there was this probing quality to them.\n\nThe music was, well, layered and atmospheric, collages of sounds that would flow together and then there'd be a tension that'd give way to something in a lyric or a vocal.\n\nI wasn't really quite sure how much of \"OK Computer\" was deliberately produced, or how much of it was a product of chance, of pure serendipity.\n\nAnd maybe that was the real hook for me. The music kept me guessing, it kept me involved. The song titles were a mix of standard fare and peculiar (the former including \"Let Down,\" \"No Surprises,\" \"Lucky\" and the latter featuring \"Paranoid Android,\" \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"Exit Music (For a Film).\"\n\nThe lyrics, the sounds, the song titles, they all appealed to different parts of my head.\n\nI tend to think that music is a very personal experience in life. Sure, you have massive hits that everyone buys and become global anthems. But what we hear in the music, what we feel from the music, what we respond to in the music are very personal. And when you move away from the big hits, the chart toppers, and you're listening to music that is more soundscape than guitar-hero hijinx, it's all about what you find and what you feel and what you take away from it.\n\nI guess I can see the Pink Floyd connection, after all. The material gets into all those nooks and crannies, organic buildups and all.\n\nI may need to track down my Aussie friend and thank him. It's long overdue.\n\nWhat about Paul McCartney?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1997 is Paul McCartney's \"Flaming Pie.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1997\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nElliott Smith's \"Either/Or.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"In It for the Money.\"\n\nJohn Fogerty's \"Blue Moon Swamp.\"\n\nOasis' \"Be Here Now.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Time Out of Mind.\"\n\nThe more things change, the more things stay the same.\n\nAn online pal got me into \"OK Computer,\" and another online pal got me into \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nI think it was around 2013 that a Facebook friend (hi Becknar!) asked me what I thought about Superdrag.\n\nOddly enough, the Superdrag albums I had been exposed to were not their biggest records. Go figure.\n\nA guy I roomed with in college had gotten me into the band a little, and I had copies of \"In the Valley of Dying Stars\" (which I really liked), \"Greetings from Tennessee\" (which was OK) and \"Last Call for Vitriol\" (another excellent record).\n\nBut I had never heard \"Regretfully Yours\" or \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nBecknar, the passionate gent that he is about music, found copies of both albums at basement prices on eBay and sent me the links. Days later, I had these albums in my hands. Headphones ready, I dug in.\n\nBefore I start talking \"Head Trip,\" let me just say this: If you love 1990s power pop and alt rock, you owe it to yourself to get these two records. Part of me wants to say that Superdrag is almost the Cheap Trick of the 1990s (and in case you have mixed feelings on what that could mean, take it as a compliment).\n\nAs for the music? Oh, man. Think about the 1967 era of The Beatles, like \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" with sitars and orchestrated hooks and lush backing tracks. The vocals are crisp, there are tasty hooks and everything sounds so punchy and vibrant. Getting the Cheap Trick angle, yet?\n\nBut Superdrag's members aren't just copying a sound or replicating a style. The best music can pay homage to a sound while also creating something distinctive and refreshing.\n\nLooking for hits or key cuts? You won't find any. The album is a triumph of studio use, but it isn't a collection of radio hits or chart toppers. If you've heard any of the songs on the record, it's likely it was \"Do the Vampire.\" But don't be dismissing the album because you don't recognize the song titles or haven't heard the tracks. \"I'm Expanding My Mind\" has to be one of the great leadoff tracks on a 1990s album, and the group's purpose for the album is right there in the title. Imagine you're outside on a hot day, and you step into an air-conditioned sanctuary. That woosh of refreshment, that sudden relief, an immediate comfort. That's the opening track. Comfortable, engaging, getting you ready for more.\n\nHats off to you, Becknar. How'd I miss this back in the day? It only took me 15 years, but now I'm in love with one of the late 1990s great lost albums. No drag in that.\n\nWhat about Madonna?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1998 is Madonna's \"Ray of Light.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1998\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Photograph Smile.\"\n\nLucinda Williams' \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Stunt.\"\n\nThe Beach Boys' \"Endless Harmony Soundtrack.\"\n\nElliott Smith's \"XO.\"\n\nWhen I first moved to St. Cloud in late 2004, I made a number of new friends. With new friendships came exposure to music I hadn't tried. I knew some Nine Inch Nails material, but it took a copy editor friend to get me into \"The Fragile.\"\n\nIt goes something like this. The copy desk was talking about key albums and artists that meant a lot to them for whatever reason. I talked about Brian Wilson and his recently released \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE,\" and others were contributing their favorites. The copy editor, a good dude named Ryan, spoke of \"The Fragile.\" Excited discussions were had, and this led to people burning CDs of albums to introduce everyone else to the music.\n\nAnd folks, the proper etiquette when sharing favorites with each other always is to at least try the favorites given by others in the conversation. That give-and-take is part of the fun.\n\nSo I popped in \"The Fragile,\" sat in a comfy chair and started to listen.\n\nSome music, you're just going to dislike for whatever reason. If you hate rap, you hate rap. If you hate country, you hate country. If you hate industrial music, you hate industrial music. And Nine Inch Nails is heavily rooted in industrial music, but it has a heavy rock vibe to it. If you like pop or lighter fare, this is probably not for you.\n\nBut oh, seriously, just listen. This isn't the usual NIN (if NIN can ever be described to be \"usual\"). It's avant garde, artsy, multifaceted, complex, almost symphonic, a truly layered work. Is this prog rock? Maybe?\n\nWhat I know for sure is that it is experimental and pushes the envelope of what Trent Reznor had done on previous albums. It can alternate from airy to suffocating, chillingly isolated and then overheated and claustrophobic. I mean, how do you zigzag like that, sometimes just one moment to the next on the same track? It's like capturing wind and trying to shape something from it, powerful and frightening and then gone. And it's angry. It is so angry.\n\nBut let you think this is some atmosphere album, no, it has songs. It has lyrics. While all the pieces fit together as a disjointed and compelling whole, you can pull out individual tunes. But it almost feels a disservice to talk about individual songs when the impact of the album is from its totality. You can thrash and wail, or you can hug yourself and chant. You feel eerily alienated and disturbingly understood.\n\nSound frightening? It is. But the best art grabs you and doesn't let you go. And \"The Fragile\" refuses to let you go, it lingers, and it draws strength over the years. It isn't that it is lyrically inventive or sonically original, but there's this cumulative effect that blows you away. It isn't for the faint of heart, but it is an album worth experiencing.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1999\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1999 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nEminem's \"The Slim Shady LP.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Echo.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Californication.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"The Soft Bulletin.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Seven More Minutes.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Fly.\"\n\nThe Magnetic Fields' \"69 Love Songs.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Run Devil Run.\"\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \"Looking Forward.\"\n\nBeck's \"Midnite Vultures.\"\n\nMy first impressions of Eminem's \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" came from selling it.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, I was working at a store that sold music, movies and books. I really enjoyed that job and the people I worked with, and we had our regulars as customers — the folks who'd come in every day and would chat about their favorite music, concerts they'd gone to, celebrities they'd met, that kind of thing.\n\nOne day, one of our regulars (a guy in his early 40s) came in wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and he headed right over to the music section. I figured there'd be some classic rock or maybe some metal coming up to the register with him. Nope.\n\nHe had a copy of Eminem's latest release, \"The Marshall Mathers LP.\"\n\nI asked him about it. Was he a fan? What got him interested in buying the album? Had he heard much Eminem before?\n\nIt turns out that he'd never heard an Eminem song before, but he was buying it for his son and had heard and read that it was a very strong album, with adult themes and language, but that it also was very artistic and intriguing. Fair enough. He bought it, and that was that.\n\nI hadn't actually heard the record. In fact, it would take another year before I'd hear more than a few tracks (you couldn't really get away from \"Stan\" or \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as they were on TV and everyone was listening to them). I had friends who listened to hip-hop regularly, and they talked about how revolutionary the record was, and they played me select tracks.\n\nAs a narrative piece, the album hangs together really well. Eminem's conflicts with authority, with fame and with his wife and mother, as well as his anger, his drug use and his violent outlook, didn't come across as gimmicks or stereotypes. Sincerity is a quality that can add quite a bit to art, and you'll find quite a bit of sincerity throughout this record — some of it quite scary.\n\nBut there's a lot of humor (sometimes dark, but humor nonetheless) on this album. The themes jump from the kind of material that could make horror movie fodder or content for a \"CSI\" episode, then jump to songs that deflate the situation and basically ask the listener, \"Are you actually taking this seriously?\" I find him refreshing, provocative, intelligent, surreal.\n\nIf you have a preconceived notion of Eminem as a violent, foul-mouthed thug, \"Stan\" still stands as one of the best challenges to that image. It gives you a glimpse behind the public face, demonstrating the fan expectations, the pressures of fame and the downsides of adulation brilliantly. Eminem knows who he is, and what he is.\n\nHe's the real Slim Shady, sometimes. He's Marshall Mathers, sometimes. He's who he needs to be, what he has to be, and this album is just an early part of an important musical and cultural legacy.\n\nHe's released some great albums since, too. And if you've never seen his film \"8 Mile,\" give it a shot. Give all his records a shot. Maybe you'll glean some understanding from all the material. Or maybe you'll be entertained. Or maybe you'll find it disturbing, or vulgar, or obscene.\n\nI'm sure Eminem would welcome any of those views. He's heard it all, been called it all. That's just the way he is.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2000\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"De Stijl.\"\n\nColdplay's \"Parachutes.\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\nRadiohead's \"Kid A.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"You're the One.\"\n\nAfter being introduced to Weezer's \"Blue Album\" and taking a while to really embrace sophomore effort \"Pinkerton,\" I was finally primed for a new Weezer release when it was announced that a third album was on the way.\n\n\"Would it be as dark and personal as 'Pinkerton?' \" I asked myself. \"Oooh, or maybe it'll be some new rock opera, some artful new expression of frustration!\"\n\nWhat we got was quite the opposite of that.\n\nPower pop, huge bursts of guitar riffs and catchy hooks, an album seemingly created to be a summer masterpiece. This was what Weezer gave us for album No. 3.\n\nAnother self-titled effort, like the group's debut, this one has taken to being called the \"Green Album\" because of the vivid green background on it. Also like the debut, the group members are lined up on the cover (though the band's personnel had changed, with a new bassist in the group).\n\nBut that's about where the similarities end. Whereas \"Blue\" had an alt-rock feel with some pop sensibilities, \"Green\" is pure pop sweetness with a tendency to rock.\n\nAnd \"Green\" is short; it runs less than 30 minutes. \"Blue\" has \"Only in Dreams,\" which is more than eight minutes by itself.\n\nIn the end, though, the length didn't matter, nor did the style. I didn't find myself disappointed by \"Green.\" In fact, I was pretty happy with it. It came out in the middle of May 2001, and I bought my first copy after finishing a couple of my more-challenging college finals of the school year. The relief I felt at being done with those classes was nicely boosted by the mostly happy feeling to the majority of the songs. Even the sadder sounds felt upbeat.\n\n\"Photograph\" was so much fun ... \"If you want it, you can have it / but you're gonna have to reach out there and grab it.\" So simple, but so true. Nothing wrong with simplicity, folks. And then there's the Sumo wrestlers in \"Hash Pipe\" (and that song has a wicked groove, I still get grabbed by it). \"Island in the Sun\" definitely grabbed a lot of ears (hip hip), and \"Crab\" is some singalong fun.\n\nMy favorite from the album then, as now, is \"Smile.\" A little different production or a little different approach and the track could have easily slipped on to \"Blue\" or \"Pinkerton.\" An off-kilter love song, I'll grant you, but I love it. \"The way you wanna wrap me up inside your smile,\" a wonderful idea.\n\n\"Green\" is probably the easiest of Weezer albums to play for new listeners, as it is fun, catchy and not terribly challenging. Beyond the drug references in \"Hash Pipe\" or the word \"knickers\" in the song \"Crab,\" it is the kind of music that 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds would find pleasing to the ear.\n\nSound awful? Sound like a sellout? Sound like commercial fluff? Bah. Get over it. Pop it in a player, crank it up and have some fun. You might just find that you like it. Maybe you'll find that it makes you feel better. Heck, maybe it will even make you feel happy. Who knows? Maybe it'll make you feel so fine, you can't control your brain. (Hip hip.)\n\nWhat about Bob Dylan?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2001 is Bob Dylan's \"Love and Theft.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2001\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"White Blood Cells.\"\n\nSuper Furry Animals' \"Rings Around the World.\"\n\nSlipknot's \"Iowa.\"\n\nElton John's \"Songs from the West Coast.\"\n\nThe Strokes' \"Is This It.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks get a lot of crap thrown at them. Too pop to be country. Too country to be pop. The George Bush and \"Shut Up and Sing\" stuff. Their brashness, their fierce \"we don't care what you think or what you want, we'll be us and you can take it or leave it\" stance on things (which would likely be celebrated if they were men instead of women ... but that's a topic for another time).\n\nBut damn, do they have a sound. Whether it is Natalie Maines' vocals or the combined instrumental and harmony sounds with bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, there's a powerful combination of sweetness, determination, mischief and joie de vivre that is as compelling as the guitar strums and fiddle flourishes.\n\nI was walking between two dorms on the University of Missouri campus in autumn 2002 when I first heard them. It was this bouncy (and laid back, at the same time) track, it almost reminded me of Civil War music but was way, way too modern. What the heck was it?\n\nI was talking to a friend about songs we liked, and out of the blue she played \"Travelin' Soldier.\"\n\nThat was IT. That was THE SONG.\n\nWell, forget the Civil War. A bus, Army greens, this was definitely a more modern setting (Vietnam). But the sound and sentiment leaps generations, and the words ring true no matter the age. \"Our love will never end, waitin' for the soldier to come back again / never more to be alone when the letter said, 'A soldier's coming home.' \"\n\nOK, so I knew the song. I knew the artist. Now to add the album to my collection. I hit a music store, and there it was: \"Home.\" That was the album. Picked up, purchased, mine. Mission accomplished (I trust you'll forgive the situational humor). And it was love from first listen.\n\nIt sounded so natural. It had more of a folk and bluegrass leaning, heavy on acoustic instrumentation and sounding fantastic. Honestly, it sounded like a classic album that had been around for decades but was freshly discovered somehow. It was warm and comfortable and exciting, something I hadn't really thought possible for a country music album at that time.\n\nCollege is a good time for getting over biases. With \"Home\" and my exposure to Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings,\" I started to set aside biases of songs about pickup trucks, drinking and \"she done me wrong\" stereotypes and started to acknowledge the depth and artistry within the genre. And \"Home\" by itself was quite an education.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks even took on Fleetwood Mac's \"Landslide\" and covered it admirably, standing tall right up there against Stevie Nicks' own definitive performance.\n\nAnd the instrumental \"Lil' Jack Slade,\" wow, really, that's a headphones track. I enjoy every listen.\n\nSure, on \"Home\" you still get some traditional country music references (song titles like \"White Trash Wedding\" and \"Tortured, Tangled Hearts\" sound tailor-made for jukeboxes at honky tonks), but I like that. It's history, it's part of the genre, it's part of the tradition. It's fun, it pulls on nostalgic heartstrings that you may not even know you had until the sounds pluck them.\n\n\"Home\" is damn good music. Setting aside the politics and the situation, this is a great American album, an important entry in country music and is my favorite Dixie Chicks album by a wide margin (and I've since picked up and enjoyed all the Maines-era Chicks records).\n\nTurn it on, let it play. See if you'll shed a tear with the pretty little girl with a bow in her hair.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2002\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2002 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe Streets' \"Original Pirate Material.\"\n\nWilco's \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\"\n\nEminem's \"The Eminem Show.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.\"\n\nMy Chemical Romance's \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"The Rising.\"\n\nInterpol's \"Turn on the Bright Lights.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"The Last DJ.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"American IV: The Man Comes Around.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison's \"Brainwashed.\"\n\nGosh, is there anyone older than 18 who hasn't heard \"Seven Nation Army?\" I'd be inclined to guess not.\n\nFor quite a stretch there, it seemed to be everywhere. It's one of The White Stripes' signature songs, and it kicks off their 2003 album \"Elephant\" with insistent, undeniable, unavoidable energy. And it is one of those earworms that you just cannot get out of your head. I know. I've tried.\n\nIt isn't a bad song. In fact, it's a pretty cool song. But like all cool songs that have been overplayed, one may find oneself skipping the track to get to other goodies. The blessing of \"Elephant\" is that there are many goodies worth skipping to.\n\nMy personal favorite is their cover of \"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,\" the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song that has been recorded by such greats as Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick. And with all respect to those versions, The Stripes' rendition is my favorite. It has a snarling, carnal quality that is both seductive and bombastic. And the video, well, it didn't hurt things either.\n\nOne of the cool touches on \"Elephant\" is the use of antiquated equipment during the recording and production of the album. No computers, no modern processes. What does this mean to the casual listener? Maybe not a whole lot (though I suspect you'll sense some undefinable something that you can't articulate). For dedicated students of sound and those who spend some time with headphones, the old equipment adds a dimension and sonic quality that conjures the live energy and excitement of earlier recordings. There's a spark, a crackle, a fuzz, not an imperfection but an enhancement, a \"you are here\" buzz that can suck you right into the music.\n\nAt least, that's how it feels to me.\n\nEarlier White Stripes albums had several good songs, and the garage rock sound was well established. But \"Elephant\" was where Jack and Meg White really kicked things up a notch, cranked the volume to 11 and blew the doors off garages near and far. And it set the stage for \"Get Behind Me Satan,\" my favorite Stripes album.\n\nIf you like you rock a bit loud and bluesy, if you like some slashing guitars and your drums to feel like thunder, \"Elephant\" has those qualities in spades. You want things a bit more toned down, intimate, you want to be coaxes through songs? \"Elephant\" has that too. There's such a variety of styles, I never get bored with \"Elephant.\" No one-trick pony, The White Stripes.\n\nAnd if all else fails, there's always \"Seven Nation Army.\" It's one of the 14 great songs on the album, and every single one's got a story to tell.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2003\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRingo Starr's \"Ringo Rama.\"\n\nAvenged Sevenfold's \"Waking the Fallen.\"\n\nWarren Zevon's \"The Wind.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Let It Be ... Naked.\"\n\nAlicia Keys' \"The Diary of Alicia Keys.\"\n\nIn 2004, My Chemical Romance was nowhere near my radar. I had college graduation, my first newspaper job in North Carolina, my first car that was all mine and then the move to St. Cloud. And Brian Wilson released two albums that year, so I was pretty preoccupied.\n\nAnd to be honest, I don't know if I'd have paid any attention to My Chem even if the rest of the variables weren't in play. The band looked like the goth guys you maybe avoided in class. And songs about vampires and zombies and ghosts and ... well, there you go.\n\nBut then I discovered \"The Black Parade,\" and everything changed. I learned the ever-popular (and generally true) creed of not judging books by their covers.\n\nAfter I got hooked on \"The Black Parade,\" I started filling in the past releases. The excellent 2002 debut \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\" is a much rawer effort than \"The Black Parade,\" and makes one wonder if the 2004 sophomore effort \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" would bridge the harder punk sounds and the smoother rock opera touches.\n\nNope. \"Three Cheers\" is a polished effort, too. And that's OK, because it's a great polished effort at that.\n\nWhen I started listening to \"Three Cheers,\" I got swept away by the variety of textures and by the operatic sweep of the sound. My first thought was, \"This band has to have been inspired by Queen.\" My second thought was, \"This is really freaking good.\"\n\nAnd it is. It is really freaking good. \"Helena,\" \"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison,\" \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise),\" \"The Ghost of You,\" \"Thank You for the Venom,\" \"Cemetery Drive\" and \"I Never Told You What I Do for a Living\" ... all great! Yes, this is a band influenced by horror movies, by comic books, by classic rock albums and punk rock albums and by old movies ... and dang it, that's great! If you enjoy that kind of stuff, if you have similar tastes and influences, isn't it great to see (or hear) a band that combines it all so well and makes music you can relate to?\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is.\n\nCall me a sucker for liking soaring vocals and catchy guitar riffs, but there is some dimension to this music. Chiming guitars, propulsive drum fills, bass notes that bubble up, all combining into a layered sound and complexity that tickles the ears.\n\nOh, and all the videos released to promote the singles are pretty sweet too. \"I'm Not Okay\" is like a trailer to a film, \"Helena\" is a funeral (with some epic dancing), but my favorite is the retro \"The Ghost of You,\" with its World War II era vibe. Good stuff.\n\nSet aside the goth clothing, ignore the hairstyles, pay attention to the situations, the stories, the performances. Once you've jettisoned your prejudices (just as I had to do), there's something altogether human, quirky and enjoyable to this music. Allow yourself to bask in the outsider mentality a bit (it may be no stranger to you, anyway). An open mind can take you places, from the Old West to Omaha Beach.\n\nIf you like your music dramatic, My Chemical Romance and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" may be right up your alley.\n\nWhat about Brian Wilson?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2004 is Brian Wilson's \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2004\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Killers' \"Hot Fuss.\"\n\nMatt Sharp's \"Matt Sharp.\"\n\nArcade Fire's \"Funeral.\"\n\nIf \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" doesn't come up in a conversation about Paul McCartney's best solo work, then the people in that conversation need to give it another try (and use their ears this time). Simply put, it isn't just one of McCartney's finest solo albums, it is one of his finest albums. Period.\n\nThe guy who really flowered on The Beatles' \"Revolver\" and gave us \"Eleanor Rigby,\" \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"For No One\" is right here. That's no hyperbole, my friends. Emotional music, introverted, personal. For folks who think Sir Paul is only good for catchy melodies and grandma music (and shame on you if you're one of them), \"Chaos and Creation\" will put you in your place.\n\nThat isn't to say the music isn't tuneful. Of course it is. But it tends to be more intimate, with Paul singing of topics in a first-person narrative that transcends the \"silly love songs\" for which he tends to be known. A more reflective, from-the-heart bend is found in these songs.\n\nWhen I bought the album, I didn't have a lot of high expectations. Obviously, I'd dearly loved \"Flaming Pie\" when it came out, and I enjoyed \"Run Devil Run\" quite a bit when it was released. But I find the bulk of 2001's \"Driving Rain\" lackluster, abysmal, tedious. The album was littered with good song ideas, but mostly the performances lacked any kind of spark or energy that would lift the songs from middle-of-the-road compositions to lively or engaging favorites.\n\n\"Chaos and Creation\" was the first release after \"Driving Rain,\" so I was curious (and more than a little worried) to hear what Paul would give us next. Would there be a new direction, or would he be settling into a \"well, this is good enough\" mindset and give us a \"Driving Rain II?\"\n\nRelief, friends. Sheer relief. From the strident piano of opening track \"Fine Line\" to the looped sounds on \"How Kind of You\" to the playful whimsy of \"English Tea\" and the aching beauty of \"Too Much Rain,\" there were many standout tracks. Many? Try all. ALL. No lie. Sure, some songs bear stylistic similarities to past glories (you'll no doubt note that \"Blackbird\" and \"Jenny Wren\" sound like the cousins they are), but there's a maturity and emotional fullness to the new pieces that lifts them from being recreations or homages. Some songs start out in one style and then deftly transition to a different style entirely, in completely unexpected ways (\"Promise to You Girl,\" for example).\n\nThe album is one reward after another, an artistic achievement followed by another artistic achievement, and all while staying accessible, melodious, friendly to the ear.\n\nAnd some credit must be given to producer Nigel Godrich, who has coaxed sounds and feelings out of Radiohead's best works as almost an auxiliary band member, using the studio to bring out textures in the music beyond those created with instruments and computers. Godrich would challenge McCartney, he'd set goals, he'd discuss the emotional qualities and anthemic possibilities, he'd slow down songs, he'd add sounds, all while keeping Paul very much Paul. In fact, most of the instrumentation on the album is played by McCartney himself (shades of \"McCartney\" and \"McCartney II\" in the mix).\n\nIn the final assessment of the album, it is one of the most well-rounded, sincere and inclusive McCartney records released, to date. You'll still get pieces of good-time Paul, and balladeer Paul, and romantic Paul ... and you SHOULD. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I think the best music is music with sincerity, and Paul is sincerely that kind of musician. But he's also a human, a man who has had losses, has suffered setbacks, has fought for what he has, and knows that not everything is wine and roses. And nowhere is Paul more reflective (while also being colorful and stirring and inventive) than he is on \"Chaos and Creation.\"\n\nPost Beatles, post Wings, McCartney has some great albums. And with \"Tug of War,\" \"Flaming Pie\" and 2013's \"New,\" \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" is at the top of the heap. It is a genuine classic, and I hope it grows in stature as more and more people give it a try. It took emotional and creative courage to put this material out there, to buck some of the expectations McCartney has just for being Paul McCartney, and it is a rewarding listen time after time. If you don't feel a tug within you, a recognition of yourself in the music of \"Too Much Rain,\" well, do some living.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2005\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces' \"EP.\"\n\nWeezer's \"Make Believe.\"\n\nOasis' \"Don't Believe the Truth.\"\n\nThe White Stripes' \"Get Behind Me Satan.\"\n\nNeil Diamond's \"12 Songs.\"\n\nOver the course of my time as a music columnist, one of the genuine delights I've encountered has been email conversations with folks out in the real world about music. One of the most regular and insightful has been area columnist Dennis Dalman. His love for Bob Dylan, his deep interest in Dylan trivia and his pool of anecdotes have been interesting and enjoyable over the last year.\n\nWe've talked about Dylan's evolution, his different styles and personas, and we've discussed the merits of many of the albums about which I've written. From \"Love and Theft\" to \"Blood on the Tracks\" and discussions about Dylan's speed-induced electric years, it's been fun to trade notes.\n\nOne album we haven't talked much about has been \"Modern Times,\" the 2006 album that picks up where \"Love and Theft\" left off.\n\nIf you enjoyed the bluesy tones and rockabilly charms of \"Love and Theft,\" then \"Modern Times\" will be right up your alley. You can look up the controversy about lyrical and musical influences and uncredited contributions, but Dylan has long been a man who has made use of old folk songs, old blues songs and standards in his music. To me, what matters is the performance, the personal investment in the material.\n\nAnd with \"Modern Times,\" Dylan is in fine performance form. There are some excellent later-period vocals, jauntiness on more upbeat songs and a reservedness to the ballads (of which there are a few). When an album features such fine pieces as \"Thunder on the Mountain,\" \"Rollin' and Tumblin',\" \"Someday Baby,\" \"Workingman's Blues #2,\" \"Nettie Moore\" and \"Ain't Talkin',\" it is going to be worth your while. (Truth be told, I prefer the version of \"Someday Baby\" on \"The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006,\" but that's a conversation for another time.)\n\n\"Modern Times\" was the first Dylan album released after I'd moved to St. Cloud, and my first impression was that it is a very long record. Though only 10 songs, the album lasts more than an hour. Brevity apparently wasn't on Dylan's mind. But rather than feeling bored or distracted by the longer songs, I enjoyed that you had time to absorb and digest the songs. Like with blues and jazz albums, the journey is at least half of the experience; it isn't about the instant payoff or the standard verse-chorus-verse construction.\n\nTake \"Ain't Talkin',\" for instance. That's a journey song if ever there is one. We're with the narrator as he wanders, as he tries to do good, and we see when the narrator falters and how he is distracted into darkness. That's not the kind of song you sum up in three minutes with the chorus repeated four times.\n\nOver the years, I've grown to enjoy \"Modern Times\" as a worthy successor to \"Love and Theft.\" \"Love and Theft\" may be my favorite of the two, but in a world where you can have both, why not indulge in the greatness of the pair of albums?\n\nConsidering the streak that started with at least \"Time Out of Mind\" and led to \"Love and Theft\" and then \"Modern Times,\" it is hard to deny that Dylan was on one heck of a hot streak. If only we could all be so lucky at age 65. Here's hoping ...\n\nWhat about My Chemical Romance?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2006 is My Chemical Romance's \"The Black Parade.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2006\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2006 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Show Your Bones.\"\n\nEagles of Death Metal's \"Death by Sexy.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Stadium Arcadium.\"\n\nDavid Gilmour's \"On an Island.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Taking the Long Way.\"\n\nThe Decemberists' \"The Crane Wife.\"\n\nThe Killers' \"Sam's Town.\"\n\nFoo Fighters' \"Skin and Bones.\"\n\nTom Wait"
