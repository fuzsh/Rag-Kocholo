        "text": "Some albums are timeless, others are products of the era in which they were released, and others are simply remarkable. Kenny Rogers’ 1983 studio album, Eyes That See In The Dark, is all of the above and then some.\n\nShowcasing a perfect blend of country and pop influences, Rogers worked with the legendary Barry Gibb, Albhy Galuten, and Karl Richardson to produce an album that is as close to Kenny Rogers meets the Bee Gees as one can get. Rogers may not have had a falsetto vocal range, but when you merge the songwriting trio of Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb, writing the majority of songs, magic was bound to happen. The result is that Eyes That See In The Dark is one of the greatest, and one of the most underrated, albums of the 80s.\n\nOne core disappointment for the modern-day music lover, however, is that Dolly Parton’s duet with Rogers, on the song Islands In The Stream, has been omitted from every streaming and digital storefront. As the album is largely unavailable, outside of the secondhand marketplace, it’s a frustration that is largely unavoidable. From what I can ascertain, this classic tune has been excluded due to a licensing issue. The legalities of the music industry once again disrupt the ability for fans to simply enjoy the music. However, if there is a will there is a way and thankfully the song remains available via some of Dolly Parton’s career retrospective releases. As such, just for you dear reader (and myself, of course), I’ve put together a playlist to accompany this review that includes this landmark tune. Yes, it’s not the same and the purist in me will need to seek out an original unaltered copy, but if we look at the perspective of the glass being half full, then we’re incredibly fortunate to still have access to these songs.\n\nAs it pertains to the sonic quality of the available version, the lossless Apple Music stream is more than adequate. It is most likely derived from the long out-of-print CD release, but there aren’t any glaring issues to mention. It sounds like the 80s and is most certainly a Kenny Rogers album in tonality, but it’s also got the Bee Gees’ signature tunes all over it. What I’m getting at is that this album was recorded, mixed, and mastered well in the first place and the sonic presentation is perfectly suited to the music. With that in mind, join me as I take a look at the individual songs that make up this incredible release.\n\nThis Woman kicks the album off in an energetic and catchy manner. The lively tone and upbeat tempo are perfectly suited to Rogers’ smooth vocal delivery, but it’s the chorus that will captivate your music-loving soul. A simply fantastic song and a great opener!\n\nYou And I is a beautiful song and, interestingly, Barry Gibb’s vocal harmony opens the tune. It works incredibly well, but it does make you wonder if you’re listening to a Bee Gees tune or a Kenny Rogers one. That said, once Rogers gets going on the verse, his gentle melodic and emotional vocal presentation is masterful and the backing vocals throughout the chorus give listeners access to the very best of both worlds.\n\nBuried Treasure has a country twang to it and is a perfect toe-tapper. Not only is Rogers incredible on vocals, but those backing vocals, again, are what musical dreams are made of for they don’t detract, but enhance the song; one that’s a hidden gem, or dare I say a buried treasure within Rogers’ extensive back catalogue.\n\nIslands In The Stream (Duet With Dolly Parton) is, without doubt, the most well-known tune from the album and there’s little doubt that it’s incredible. The combination of Rogers and Parton was always pure gold and along with a touch of the Bee Gees, you’ve got not only a hit but one of the greatest songs ever recorded in all of music history. Yes, the Bee Gees’ performance from their One Night Only live album is pure perfection, but this original is perfectly suited to the album, the era, and the artistic intent, thereby making it a standout.\n\nLiving With You is a magnificent mid-tempo number and another hidden gem that not only would have been a hit had it been released as a single but is one of the best songs the Bee Gees ever wrote. A true masterpiece!\n\nEvening Star has a gentler country-styled musical arrangement and while the opening elements may make you wonder if it isn’t just filler, this album-only tune becomes a beloved song as every time I listen to the album, I find myself thoroughly engrossed in this song without even realising it; it’s that good!\n\nHold Me is a lovely ballad that slowly builds and, again, it’s the combination of backing vocals, with Rogers’ incredibly delicate vocal, that enhances the song.\n\nMidsummer Nights picks up the tempo, but as much as you’d think it would be a jolt to the senses, it isn’t as the sequencing of the entire record was masterfully done. The mix of country and soft rock elements are superb, but it’s also fair to say that Midsummer Nights is the most Bee Gees-like song on the album and if it wasn’t for the catchy melody, I’d question if this song choice was right for Rogers.\n\nI Will Always Love You is a poignant ballad and Rogers’ tender vocal delivery ensures that while this is most certainly an album-only tune, it flows well and is perfectly suited to the record.\n\nEyes That See In The Dark is an incredible song to close the album on as it will encourage reflection whilst simultaneously encouraging you to play the record again. Yes, the verses may be a little pedestrian, but that chorus, as has been the case throughout much of the album, makes the song the powerhouse that it is.\n\nIn some ways, Eyes That See In The Dark could be considered a pinnacle release in Rogers’ career as it marked a very successful genre crossover into country-pop territory. Yes, Rogers had an incredible breadth of music, and sales success, pre-dating this release but it’s also fair to say that this album cemented his relevance beyond the country music scene he was most commonly associated with. That aside, Eyes That See In The Dark has a timeless quality, stellar production, and an incredible selection of songs meaning that there isn’t a bad song to be heard and it’s subsequently a release that not only highlights Rogers’ incredible vocal prowess, but is a must listen for all music lovers."
