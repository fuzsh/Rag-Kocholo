        "text": "Ashley Cooke will release her debut album, Shot in the Dark, on July 21 via Big Loud Records.\n\nCooke revealed the album plans in a surprise moment at the Grand Ole Opry last night (June 20), and treated fans to the first live performance of the closing track “state i’m in.” This Friday (June 23), Cooke will share three tracks from the new project: “Tastes Like,” “Shot in the Dark” and “Mean Girl (feat. Colbie Caillat).”\n\nThe project features collaborations with not only Caillat, but also Nate Smith, Jackson Dean and Brett Young. With 24 tracks unfolding as if they were ripped from the pages of her journal, Cooke shares her sun-kissed blend of pop country in tales of love, heartbreak and all the moments in between. Capturing the spirit of a twenty-something unafraid to chase her dreams, the album invites listeners to join her as she jumps into the whirlwind of life’s roller coaster. Writers contributing to the collection include Emily Weisband, Corey Crowder, Lainey Wilson, Jordan Minton and more.\n\n“The last year of my life has been crazy and wonderful in so many ways, but I think the next year might be even better…” shared Cooke from the coveted Opry Circle. “It’s been full of bucket list moments for me… I made my Opry debut, signed my first deals, went on tours with my heroes, and lived a lot of life in the moments in between. This album is about all of that—and it’s about the magic that can come if you really take risks in life and love. It’s a huge honor to announce my debut album at a place that means so much to me. So, without further ado on July 21, I’ll release my first album Shot in the Dark, and I can’t wait for each of you to hear it. Thank you to everyone who helped get me here, and thank you for making me feel so safe to take a shot in the dark.”\n\n1. “Tastes Like” (Ashley Cooke, Jordan Minton, Emily Weisband, Corey Crowder)\n\n2. “It’s Been a Year” (Ashley Cooke, Will Weatherly, Brett Tyler)\n\n3. “See You Around (feat.
