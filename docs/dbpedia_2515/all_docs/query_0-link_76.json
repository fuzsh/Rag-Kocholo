        "text": "Story Behind the Song: 'Fishin' in the Dark'\n\nJim Photoglo knew he was onto something good when he played a bouncy melody for fellow songwriter Wendy Waldman. And he really, really didn't want to turn it into a song about fishing.\n\nBut that's what Waldman was thinking about when the two got together to write a song in Nashville â€” and it's a good thing she was. \"Fishin' in the Dark\" went to the top of the charts when it was cut by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in 1987, and it's since been covered by country giants such as Garth Brooks and Kenny Chesney.\n\nPhotoglo told the story behind \"Fishin' In The Dark\" to Bart Herbison, Executive Director of Nashville Songwriters Association International.\n\nI always find myself tapping (my foot to this song). It's what my wife would call a \"good-mooder.\" Do you find that after all of these years?\n\nWell, for me, just the fact that people are still listening to it after all these years. The stories I hear from the (Nitty Gritty) Dirt Band are how their audience react, and it's like that. It's a lot of foot-stomping.\n\nBut it's an unlikely song from a California boy. You and Wendy Waldman write this giant country hit that still keeps on breathing. So you're making one of your first visits to Nashville, and this is almost one of those dream kind of songs. How did this song evolve?\n\nIt was incredible. I made three trips to Nashville in 1984 at Wendy's suggestion. Wendy's also a California girl. She's an extraordinary, talented woman, and second generation (songwriter). Her father wrote the theme to \"Perry Mason\" and \"Bullwinkle.\" We had met in L.A. and got to talking. She suggested that I come out to Nashville. She sort of sponsored me here, and introduced me to a lot of people. I had some pop records out in L.A., and they had gotten played here. With a name like Photoglo, you don't hear it all the time, so people remembered it. That opened a lot of doors for me. But I was writing primarily with her.\n\nOn this one particular visit, I was staying at Shoney's (Inn) over on Demonbreun. I was experimenting with this one particular chording on the guitar that only played the first and fifth tones of the chord, so you could sing either a major or a minor over it. One morning I woke up and I turned on my tape recorder, sat up and played these two pieces of music. Both of them had that same chordal thing, but one of them had the minor mode and one had the major mode. I took both of them to Wendy, and we wrote the minor, bluesy one first, and it got cut by Terri Gibbs, Kathy Mattea, Patty Loveless and Lacy J. Dalton had the hit on it. It was a song called \"You Can't Run Away From Your Heart.\" Then we got back together again, and she had just finished listening to \"A Prairie Home Companion.\" She said, \"Let's write a song about fishing.\"\n\nAnd again, you two, writing a fishing song. Who would have thunk it?\n\nAnd the first thing I thought was, \"I want to run away screaming, because I love my song.\" But she said, \"No, fishing in the dark.\" We started messing around with it, and it just happened, you know? We did it for fun. We weren't trying to be like any other song.\n\nDid you know the Dirt Band in L.A.? How did they get the song?\n\nThey had actually cut a song of mine that Norbert Putnam produced on them, previously. But Josh Leo came from Los Angeles to Nashville at the same time Wendy and I did, and he had just gotten the job to produce the Dirt Band. He heard the song at a party one night. Back in the early days, we'd all get together, and Wendy and I would cook. We all had these tiny apartments. Actually Josh and Wendy and I all lived in the same place over on 10th Avenue ... he went, \"Man, the Dirt Band, this is perfect for them.\" I was standing in the right place when they captured lightning in a bottle. People talk about the song, but that record that the Dirt Band made, it so impressed so many people, including Garth Brooks, who has recorded and released it three times. It's influenced all of these up and coming country acts or even people like Kenny Chesney. He used to play it in the clubs, and his live act after he became famous. There was just an article that came out in Billboard Magazine, about how 27 years later, this song is still getting so much radio play, that if it was considered a current single, it would be No. 57 on the charts. She listed all of these different country songs that reference \"Fishing in the Dark\" in the lyrics. So it's been an enormous blessing."
