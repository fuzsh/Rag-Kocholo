        "text": "1ST FULL-LENGHTH ALBUM\n\nDARK & WILD\n\nIn their first studio album in a year and two months, BTS sings about love gone awry in DARK & WILD. They warn the girl who acts like she doesn't love them not to test their love anymore.\n\nThe boys are no longer in their school uniforms. They have become tougher, singing that their love is not to be treated lightly. A year and two months into their debut, BTS made sure that the visuals, performance and all the elements of their first studio album are flawless. Tracks that highlight the different genres of hip hopâSouth, West, Boom Bap and Trapâprovide a clear direction of BTS' music. The title track âDangerâ is a tightly-composed hybrid hip hop song with a piercing punk-rock guitar sound that features stark rap, a powerful hook and exhilarating shouting.\n\n1 Intro : What am I to you 2â45â\n\n2 Danger 2â45â\n\n3 War of Hormone 4â26â\n\n4 Hip Hop Phile 4â17â\n\n5 Let Me Know 4â15â\n\n6 Rain 4â25â\n\n7 BTS Cypher PT.3 : KILLER (Feat. Supreme Boi) 4â28â\n\n8 Interlude : What are you doing now 0â42â\n\n9 Could you turn off your cell phone 3â54â\n\n10 Embarrassed 4â02â\n\n11 24/7=heaven 3â36â\n\n12 Look here 3â39â\n\n13 So 4 more 3â55â\n\n14 Outro : Do you think it makes sense? 2â53â"
