        "text": "I love Pink Floyd Live Recordings and thought it be great to share each others favorites.\n\nFor myself I love the fall 1971 tour with the San Diego being one my favorites just wish more of that concert was circulating cause echoes would be amazing.\n\nMost people will say Oakland 1977 because of the sound source and the fact they play careful with that axe, eugene. But I like the Madison Square Garden concerts with all the fireworks and stuff going off in the crowd pretty cool.\n\nI love most of the Floyd's live material. Ummagumma is a classic, so is p.u.l.s.e.\n\nIs There Anybody Out There?: The Wall Live is, in my opinion, better than the studio album. The songs and story is more complete on the live album.\n\nBesides, wish we get the complete Wembley '74 on vinyl some day.\n\nOakland '77 sounds great too, of course. Just sad that there's no soundboard source from any concert of the Animals tour.\n\nAnother fun live bootleg for me is Interstellar Encore (Fillmore West 1970). Both the band and the audience were in very good spirits.\n\nYeah that would be amazing. But it’s weird that question is often avoided by Nick Mason. It kinda makes me think what live material do they actually have? Do they even have any from the 70’s?\n\nThey have released it all—just not all in one place. And the minimum cost to own legal physical copies of the whole thing is pretty nuts.\n\nLive at the Empire Pool - Wikipedia\n\nYeah early 1970 is good stuff with them working on The Amazing Pudding.\n\nSorry, DSOT is the 1987 live album for me\n\nThe concert actually was completely released. The WYWH and Animals songs were released in the WYWH Immersion set and „Echoes“ as a bonus of the Early Years box. I actually still need that live version of „Echoes“ because the big box is too expensive for me\n\nThe full Wembley ‘74 has all been officially released ….. just not as a single, complete package. I like most other official live releases, particularly the wall, and I do have Oakland but find the sound quality generally poor. Still hard to believe there was no professional multi-track from the ‘77 tour. The band have been pretty consistent over the years that it does not exist. Quite the blunder.\n\nI remember people talking about the two Brighton Dome concerts 1972/73. One of the two (or both, I don't know) were captured on tape.\n\nBoth containing early performances of Dark Side Of The Moon. However, the band had technical problems on the 1972 gig and they didn't play the full Dark Side.\n\n3 tracks from the 1973 gig were released on the Dark Side Immersion box set. Don't know if there is more of that (i.e. the full concert recorded or just a few parts)...\n\nRecently I read somewhere here in the forum about a Radio City concert in 1973 that was also professionally recorded.\n\nAlso, the before mentioned Fillmore West gig in 1970. The sound quality on the bootleg is good but could sound better, if someone can locate the actual tapes.\n\nYeah that is a nice set for sure. Wish they would release the Royal Albert Hall performance from earlier in the tour.\n\nHeck yeah. That’s the beauty of music rediscovering stuff you haven’t listened to in a long time. Enjoy!!\n\nSecond (or third) this. Would fit nicely for a co-release with the (still unreleased) Earl's Court 1981 concert film."
