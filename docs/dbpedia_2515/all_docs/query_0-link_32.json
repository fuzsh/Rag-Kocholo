        "text": "A total of six songs are included in \"MEMORABILIA\". The title song is \"Fatal Trouble\". The song contains the confused and shaken heart of the person you believed you loved in the lyrics. It contains the stories of the main characters of the \"DARK MOON\" series.\n\nThe first unit songs since Enhyphen's debut, \"Teeth\" and \"Lucifer,\" are also expected. \"Teeth,\" sung by Jung Won, Hee-seung, Sunwoo, and Nikki, is a song that unravels the boys' sense of power and the emptiness behind it. \"Lucifer,\" a combination of Jay, Jake and Sung Hoon, sings the hearts of the wounded vampire boys.\n\nThe \"DARK MOON: The Altar of the Moon\" OST \"One In A Billion\" and \"CRIMINAL LOVE,\" which were released in 2022 and 2023, will also be on the album. The group song \"Scream,\" which contains aspirations to continue to move forward even if injured, will mark the final track.\n\n\"MEMORABILIA,\" released on May 13, is an album that expresses \"fate love\" and \"existential concerns as a vampire,\" which are themes that penetrate both Enhyphen and the \"DARK MOON\" series.\n\nFollowing the tracklist, Enhyphen will give additional hints about the tracks through the album preview on May 2. After that, concept photos will be presented from the 5th to the 11th of the same month, and music video teasers for the title song will be presented in order on the 12th.\n\nMeanwhile, Enhyphen is cruising the world tour 'ENHYPEN WORLD TOUR 'FATE PLUS' IN U.S. They will perform at the Rosemont Allstate Arena in the United States on the 1st of next month and meet local fans.\n\n[Geumbitna, reporter of MK Sports]"
