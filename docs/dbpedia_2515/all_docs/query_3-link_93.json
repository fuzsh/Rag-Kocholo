        "text": "JUNGWON: “Fate” serves as the narrative backbone of DARK BLOOD. Through our narration and vocals, this track takes you through the story of the cursed boy and how he comes to understand his fate. It captures the essence of DARK BLOOD in a nutshell.\n\nJAY: [Recording this song] was memorable for me because it was my first time narrating in Korean.\n\nJUNGWON: When it came to narrating, I found myself needing to get in the zone even more so than recording a song. So, I remember turning off all the lights and even closing my eyes when recording my part—it helped me fully immerse myself to deliver the emotions I wanted.\n\nJAKE: As the opening track of this album, it sets the tone and mood for the songs to come. When you listen to the complete album, you’ll notice how each song is intricately connected, particularly when “Bite Me” seamlessly follows “Fate.”\n\nSUNOO: Starting with this fourth mini album, ENHYPEN will reach new heights and achieve greater feats. Let’s make this “fate” of ours come to life together!\n\nJAKE: “Bite Me” is a little different from our previous lead singles, but it does the perfect job of capturing the essence of DARK BLOOD. It reveals a fresh side of us, and lyrics like “Just come kiss me and bite me” deliver the message of a fateful blood-bond in a straightforward way.\n\nHEESEUNG: I aimed to make the highlight of the song stand out so that ENGENEs would be completely captivated and focused on the members during that moment.\n\nNI-KI: If that is the case, I would say he nailed it. HEESEUNG knows the strengths of each member very well, so his vocal directions brought a fresh and unique perspective.\n\nSUNGHOON: He really paid attention to the details that we had not noticed before, and it made a significant difference in upgrading the song’s quality.\n\nJUNGWON: HEESEUNG displayed his professionalism during that moment, going beyond being just a member of ENHYPEN and taking on the role of “Director HEESEUNG.” His professionalism made it easy for us to fully concentrate during the recording process and give our best.\n\nSUNOO: It was so exciting to see this new side of him for the first time! I can only imagine how challenging it must have been, but he handled it like a pro.\n\nJAKE: And I always knew that NI-KI is a natural-born dancer, but this was the first time I saw him taking on the role of a choreographer. I knew he had a strong desire to explore these areas, so I gave him my full support.\n\nJUNGWON: I completely agree. NI-KI is undoubtedly one of the strongest dancers in our team, and I’m very grateful that he used his skills to enhance the quality of our performance. As always, his dance skills left me in awe.\n\nHEESEUNG: It was yet another testimony to his incredible talent, not only as a dancer but also as a choreographer.\n\nNI-KI: As soon as I heard the song, ideas started flowing through my mind, and I knew I wanted to create something unique and unlike anything we’d shown before. I wanted to better deliver the lyrics and capture the vibe of the song even more through my choreography.\n\nJAY: It really shows! NI-KI’s choreography perfectly complements the overall mood of “Bite Me” and makes our performance more captivating to watch.\n\nJUNGWON: And working alongside such renowned musicians and producers [like Cirkut, David Stewart, Jason Evigan and more] was a one-of-a-kind experience for us. It was an honor to collaborate with them, and we all worked even harder to deliver exceptional results. I really like “Unholy” by Sam Smith [produced by Cirkut]!\n\nSUNOO: We were truly honored to work with highly acclaimed individuals in the industry, and their involvement has led to a beautiful outcome. We would be thrilled to have an opportunity to work with them again in the future. There are many songs that come to mind, but I must say that my absolute favorite is “Dynamite” by BTS [written by David Stewart].\n\nSUNGHOON: Me, too!\n\nNI-KI: It definitely was a great honor and I’m grateful for the opportunity. [I pick] “Dynamite” by BTS.\n\nHEESEUNG: “Get Ugly” by Jason Derulo [written by Jason Evigan] is such a bop. It’s an exciting opportunity to collaborate with someone whose work I admire.\n\nJAY: For me, “Sugar” by Maroon 5 [produced by Cirkut] has been on repeat for a while, so I’m very honored to work with the same producer for our own song as well.\n\nJAKE: Their producing and songs have brought this album to a greater level of perfection. This opportunity has also been a valuable learning experience for all of us. I really like “Die For You” by The Weeknd, a song produced by Cirkut.\n\nSUNOO: As expressed through the title, it’s a track that promises the ultimate sacrifice and dedication for one’s destiny. It does a good job of showing the identity of the overall album and what we wanted to portray. I really hope everyone likes it as much as we all do.\n\nJUNGWON: I tried to imagine myself as the main character in the track to fully express it while singing.\n\nNI-KI: I absolutely loved the low notes in the bridge. It’s a little TMI, and not necessarily about the recording, but I found the choreography for this song to be quite challenging.\n\nSUNOO: Being the one to open the song, I definitely felt a bit of pressure to set the right mood. However, I’m really happy and satisfied with the result.\n\nJAKE: Personally, this song reminds me of “FEVER.” I think both songs have that kind of alluring R&B vibe that draws you in.\n\nSUNGHOON: I think the dark and alluring characteristics of the vampire goes very well with ENHYPEN’s unique color as a group. Many aspects of DARK BLOOD draw inspiration from it and “Sacrifice (Eat Me Up)” sings of sacrifice for one’s destiny, so I think our listeners will be able to feel a similar vibe to “Bite Me.”\n\nSUNGHOON: “Chaconne” is my favorite track because of its melody. I understand that “Chaconne” originates from the 17th-18th century and has been referred to as “music to resurrect the dead.” As per its meaning, our track has a dark feel and tells a story of a boy who becomes completely consumed by his own self and dancing, eventually facing his downfall.\n\nSUNOO: This track has a lot of low notes so I went into recording with a lot of practice beforehand.\n\nHEESEUNG: And I tried to incorporate more of my vocal color into this track to make it more dynamic.\n\nSUNGHOON: This is a track I tried writing lyrics for, and although they weren’t included in the final version, I remember immediately falling in love with the melody and going into recording with a lot of excitement.\n\nNI-KI: And It’s well known in the group that hip-hop is HEESEUNG and JAKE’s favorite genre, but I also enjoy listening to hip-hop music and the [soulful hip-hop feel of “Chaconne.”]\n\nHEESEUNG: “Hitman” Bang [Si-hyuk] takes the creative lead for our albums, which is essentially a collaborative process between the members as well as a number of producers and studio directors. He helps guide us in the respective direction for each of our albums and definitely plays a role in our growth as artists.\n\nJUNGWON: “Karma” and “Bills” are two of my favorite tracks from the album, but if I had to choose one, I would go with “Karma” since it has more of a fun performance aspect to it.\n\nJAY: My favorite track is “Karma” because of its cool and refreshing sound. It’s a track that tells the listener to never forget the one you are connected to by a destiny predetermined from your past life. To us, ENGENEs are our destiny and this energetic track is meant for us to sing along together and feel connected.\n\nJUNGWON: The thought of performing this track in concert made me put even more effort into the recording process. I couldn’t stop smiling in the studio imagining singing it together with our ENGENEs.\n\nHEESEUNG: It’s an uplifting song, so the recording process was also fun and lighthearted.\n\nJAY: I was pretty hyper throughout the recording process to match the energy of the track.\n\nJAKE: I remember having the most fun recording this track.\n\nSUNGHOON: I tried to reflect the rock sound and mood through my voice while recording.\n\nJUNGWON: And I’m a believer in karma—I believe good things come to those who do good.\n\nJAKE: I think I believe in it somewhat?\n\nNI-KI: I think I believe in it. Similar to JUNGWON, I think you can achieve good with good intentions."
