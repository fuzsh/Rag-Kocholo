I hope some folks end up digging something special, my response to it was so visceral and surprising to me that it made the track seem objectively bad. Hopefully I'll be proved wrong if others enjoy it. I absolutely loved Buckle Up, yet many still hate that track with a passion!!\n\n0\n\nBrainofBGA said:\n\nOverall that sounds pretty positive. In line with most other reviews. Something Special seems to be a divisive type of track. This one sounds like it‚Äôs going to be the Buckle Up, Sleeping by Myself track of Dark Matter.\n\nYou're right that those tracks are divisive, but it sounds to me more like \"Something Special\" is thematically in line with \"Just Breathe,\" \"Future Days,\" \"The End\" and \"Sirens\"-- emotional Ed songs about his wife and/or daughters that feel out of place on Pearl Jam albums (less so for \"Sirens,\" in my opinion). (It's not clear to me whether \"Sleeping By Myself\" is autobiographical in the same way as those songs.)\n\nI gather speed from you fucking with me.\n\n0\n\nI think my problem with the album although only heard it once was it has no flow. First 4 or 5 can't recall but those first ones fit together then it becomes all over the place and I know I've said it before so apologies like the last few records it has some that left me thinking how did that make the cut.\n\nbrixton 93\n\nastoria 06\n\nalbany 06\n\nhartford 06\n\nreading 06\n\nbarcelona 06\n\nparis 06\n\nwembley 07\n\ndusseldorf 07\n\nnijmegen 07\n\nthis song is meant to be called i got shit,itshould be called i got shit tickets-hartford 06 -\n\n0\n\nBF25394 said:\n\nBrainofBGA said:\n\nOverall that sounds pretty positive.

I don‚Äôt mind Just Breathe and The End. But Future Days‚Ä¶üòè\n\nI was thinking Sleeping was quite divisive, not so much for its theme, but more so it place on a PJ album. Considering it was already an Ed solo track that got re-recorded into a PJ tune.\n\nMelbourne #1 '98\n\nMelbourne #2 '03\n\nMelbourne #3 '03\n\nMelbourne #1 '06\n\nMelbourne #3 '06\n\nMelbourne '09\n\nMelbourne '14\n\n0\n\ndwjmu84 said:\n\nSBM had no business on LB; its inclusion, along with a closer the likes of future days, took the album to a low point in the band‚Äôs career in terms of quality.\n\nI agree re:SBM. It's a cheesier version of an already released song. Weird choice. Can't wait to hear the album myself, but I suspect there will be a few skipped songs for me after time, usually is. And that bit of Something Special we heard on that tweet....I bet it gets to skip status faster than most.\n\nhippiemom = goodness\n\n0\n\nif its justt 1 or 2 that arent up to par, thats pretty good...always find it funny thats what constantly gets focused on here\n\nalways\n\nSome of the greatest albums of all time have 1 or 2 or more whatever songs\n\n0\n\nIf upon releasing their 12th album, only 1 or 2 songs on it are going to be questionable to some fans, it sounds to me like they did a good job. There aren't a lot of artists that can match that. Looking forward to hearing them in a few weeks.\n\n0\n\nlastexitlondon said:\n\nI say 4\n\nWhich four in your opinion?\n\nAlso, if I recall, you had one listen to this record, which was highly affected by the atmosphere.

I liked instantly.\n\nDark matter I love. Waiting for stevie was ok. But I didn't like something special and the last song. Inbetween were not for me is all I thought. They maybe for you or others but I was led to believe it's a heavy album and apart from 5 songs. It's not. Only in my opinion.

The writer must not be a parent.\n\nYou are the only one cutting people down for their opinions on a subjective matter on a subject that hasn't even happened yet, that's for sure.\n\nI am a parent, will wait to listen to the whole song but that bit on twitter/X wasn't doing it for me at all. That said, I love Buckle up, Just Breathe, and even the End. So who the hells knows.\n\nhippiemom = goodness\n\n0"
