        "text": "So remember how I lost my mind over The Light when it came out last year? Because Delta Rae is, I’m unequivocally sure about this now, my favorite band and I love their music and what they do and what they stand for? Take all of that, then multiply it by an impossibly large number, and you get my feelings about The Dark.\n\nI’ve said before and I’ll say again, while I love the whole of the Delta Rae catalogue, it’s often the twangy moody murder songs that really get me going the most. There’s so much emotion threaded through them, these killer harmonies and riffs and string instruments and cutting beautiful lyrics. They’re a beautiful contradiction: they sound like nothing else I’ve ever heard, but their songs also feel like they came from the most familiar place of my soul. Immersing myself in their music – albums, concerts, whatever – leaves me with the most euphoric hangover imaginable, but I also feel like how some people talk about having religious experiences.\n\nI just looked up the sensation I get listening to them (sometimes other music, too), and it’s called “frisson,” apparently; that’s French for “aesthetic chills,” and it’s not uncommon or anything (it’s similar to ASMR, but triggered by music or sometimes art or even just physical contact), but for me, personally, Delta Rae’s music is one of the best ways to experience it. I usually get it on and off during albums and concerts and also musicals (I tried to count when we watched the recording of Hamilton on Disney+, for example, and I think I lost track around eighteen instances) and it feels like electricity and shivering and also a rush of endorphins at the same time. Listening to The Dark for the first time, just sitting with drift partner and experiencing it, was basically nonstop frisson.\n\nSometimes listening to Delta Rae feels like watching True Blood, which I mean as the highest compliment; the two things evoke the same emotional reaction in me. It’s funny, because I’ve never lived in the South; both my parents grew up there, and I’ve visited their families there many times, but I don’t actually feel any serious emotional connection to the actual region. I’m absolutely wild for the Southern Gothic aesthetic, though. That urban-but-not-urban fantasy vibe, full of string instruments and beautiful sad-eyed people and magic of both the metaphorical and literal variety, all moonlight and overgrown vines and foreboding fables. I originally got into Delta Rae back when 8tracks was a place we hung out and I’d just hang around in the “Southern Gothic” tag, which I in turn found from the True Blood tag; I’d say it’s a fair bet at least 60% of the mixes in that tag used “Bottom of the River,” at least back in those days, but I didn’t mind. I’d turn it up every time.\n\nAnyway, though. The Dark in specific. I was pretty excited, knowing it was going to be full of twangy moody murder songs. My literal only complaint is that I was kind of expecting “Hitch a Ride” to be on there (I uh, really groove to that one, in part because I just like songs I can sing in my car and feel like I’m acting them out like the ex-musical theatre kid I am) but like, none of the tracks that were in that batch of singles they did have wound up on full albums and that’s fine, I get it, there’s already a good recording. I kind of just wanted it all in the same place, but I guess that’s why you can play things sorted by artist, not just by album.\n\nThis album starts off strong, with two Brittany Holljes witch songs back to back. (We watched their livestream concert tonight, too, which is why I’m only just now writing this, and I’ll admit that I’m just one basic bisexual; when, at the end of her performing “The Beast” Brittany looked right at the camera and sang “let him know that we’re coming” I instinctively just nodded and said “alright, yes, I’ll do that, thank you.” She has an Effect on me, which luckily drift partner thinks is cute.) One of my favorite things about the dark-type songs these guys sing is how absolutely feral the vocals can get, and these two tracks definitely count toward that. I lose it for the little flips their voices do on high notes and how raw and haunting and gorgeous the harmonies are, how they absolutely howl the “no safe place, child” in “Come Back Alive,” how absolutely primal and true it all feels.\n\nThen there’s “Take Off Your Shoes,” and like – okay, I’m very partial to some of the guys’ songs in the rest of the Delta Rae catalogue. My blog title comes from the Ian-led track “Outlaws,” which destroys me in the best of ways (although I admit that the harmonies on “baby we can be magic” are my favorite part – harmonies are a thing for me) and which I was absolutely thrilled to hear in the Ian medley tonight (also, I don’t think I’ve heard “Is There Anyone Out There?” live since maybe the first time I saw them in concert and when those harmonies kicked in I sat up straighter like my parents’ dog does when she hears certain noises and grinned wildly). But for whatever reason, the guys’ songs on The Dark really kick it up a notch for me. Also, this track mentions werewolves in passing, which tickles my fancy for obvious reasons.\n\n“All Good People” is an experience unto itself. I’m pretty sure I ascended to a higher plane the first time I heard it live, and “if we lose our better angels, we won’t get them back again” has been my tumblr-blog title for over a year because that line stabs me in the heart every time, and also a live performance of the song is my pinned tweet on Twitter because it’s so important, and the music video destroyed me, and I just… I feel a lot about this song. It’s stuff I’ve had to reckon with myself, as a white person who wants to better the world that many of her fellow white people have destroyed, and it’s so powerful and intelligent without making itself too much about them the band (white people) and not the work they need to do for others.\n\nThe next few tracks sort of go together, spiritually. I’ve heard “Out of the Badlands” plenty of times, at concerts and in live recordings, but it’s no less chilling. “Shadows of Vegas,” of the three of them, is probably the least sexy, which is saying something because these are very sexy tracks. (Sorry. I mean that as respectfully as I possibly can! But also, I refer back to the linked article about frisson and what it is akin to.) “Shadows of Vegas” is about more than just intimacy, though. And “Somewhere in the Desert” is just… well, we were listening to it yesterday and when Liz came in on “hold me” I made a very untoward sighing noise. She also has an Effect on me, and drift partner also thinks that’s cute.\n\n“I Go to Work” is cool because Brittany doesn’t usually get to duet with the guys since, presumably, it would be weird if she did a love song with her brothers. This one isn’t a love song, though, so she and Ian really just get to tear into it together. It’s also cool because drift partner pointed out that it’s sort of a sequel to “Only in America” in a way. I like that a lot of their songs sort of go together.\n\nThen we get a rash of breakup songs, and I’m going to say that in general, I really like that Delta Rae’s breakup songs are so emotionally mature. Like, “Goddamn Shame” is angry, but anger is valid! But none of their songs are just like “ugh I h8 that bitch.” If they have problems with their exes, they’re very reasonable and well-explained, and sometimes it’s not even about that. Sometimes it’s just about how you don’t have those feelings for someone anymore, or you just have to end it for whatever reason. Drift partner and I have been having fun assigning “Last Words” to valid fictional m/f couples to upset each other (Eric and Sookie came up, of course; also Matt and Elektra and then Alma and Seth from Deadwood). “Never Coming Back” is just plaintive and beautiful and tragic, and I honestly want to hear them meld it into “If I Loved You” because Liz kills both songs.\n\n“Pay No Rent,” finally, is a surprisingly chipper end to the album, but it counts because it’s technically about death. Here is my confession: thinking too much about what happens when I, personally, am dead kind of makes me anxious. It’s not something I like to sit in, for the most part. But this song (and its twin, “Dance in the Graveyards” – also expecting that medley) are pleasantly optimistic and reassuring about the notion, and that’s just… that’s really appreciated."
