Be Quick Or Be Dead\n\n[Dickinson/Gers]\n\nCovered in sinners and dripping with gilt\n\nMaking you money from slime and from filth\n\nParading your bellies in ivory towers\n\nInvesting our lives in your schemes and your powers\n\nYou got to watch them - Be quick or be dead\n\nSnake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head\n\nYou've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead\n\nSnake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head....\n\nBe quick !\n\nOr be dead !\n\nBe quick !\n\nOr be dead\n\nSee... what's ruling all our lives\n\nSee... who pulling the strings...\n\nSee... what's ruling all our lives\n\nSee... who pulls the strings...\n\nI bet you won't fall on your face\n\nYour belly will hold you in place\n\nThe serpent is crawling inside of your ear\n\nHe says must vote for what you want to hear\n\nDon't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright\n\nPull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind.\n\nYou got to watch them - Be quick or be dead\n\nSnake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head\n\nYou've got to watch them - Be quick or be dead\n\nSnake eyes in heaven - The thief's in your head....\n\nBe quick!\n\nOr be dead!\n\nBe quick!\n\nOr be dead!\n\n2. From Here To Eternity\n\n[Harris]\n\nShe fell in love with his greasy machine\n\nShe leaned over wiped his kickstart clean\n\nShe'd never seen the beast before\n\nBut she left there wanting more more more\n\nBut when she was walking on down the road\n\nShe heard a sound that made her heart explode\n\nHe whispered to her to get on the back\n\n\"I'll take you on ride from here to eternity\"\n\n[Chorus: (2 times)]\n\nHell ain't a bad place\n\nHell is from here to eternity\n\nShe must be having one of her crazy dreams\n\nShe'd never sat on a piece so mean\n\nI've made her feel like she's on cloud nine\n\nShe even thought she heard the engine sigh.\n\nBut like all dreams that come to an end\n\nThey took a tumble at the devil's bend\n\nThe beast and Charlotte they were two of a kind\n\nThey'd always take the line... from here to eternity\n\n[Chorus 2 times]\n\n3. Afraid To Shoot Strangers\n\n[Harris]\n\nLying awake at night I wipe the sweat from my brow\n\nBut it's not fear 'cos I'd rather go now\n\nTrying to visualise the horrors that will lay ahead\n\nThe desert sand mound a burial ground\n\nWhen it comes to the time\n\nAre we partners in crime ?\n\nWhen it comes to the time\n\nWe'll be ready to die\n\nGod let us go now and finish what's to be done\n\nThy Kingdom come\n\nThy shall be done... on earth\n\nTrying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go\n\nShould we live and let live\n\nForget or forgive\n\nBut how can we let them go on this way ?\n\nThe reign of terror corruption must end\n\nAnd we know deep down there's no other way\n\nNo trust, no reasoning, no more to say\n\nAfraid to shoot strangers\n\nAfraid to shoot strangers.\n\n4. Fear Is The Key\n\n[Dickinson/Gers]\n\nWe live our lives in fever\n\nIn choking sweat of fear\n\nIn the heat of the night you can feel so much\n\nIn the heat of the night I scream \"Don't touch\"\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nI remember a time when we used and abused\n\nAnd we fought all our battles in vain\n\nI remember a time we thought that passion was free\n\nIn the heat of the night... bodies aflame\n\nWe live in fever...\n\nI hear your secret heartbeat\n\nI can hear your silent cries\n\nThe kids have lost their freedom\n\nAnd nobody cares till somebody famous dies...\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nNow we live, in a world of uncertainty\n\nFear is the key - to what you want to be\n\nYou don't get a say the majority gets it's way\n\nYou're outnumbered by the bastards till the day you die...\n\n5. Childhood's End\n\n[Harris]\n\nI'd sail across the ocean\n\nI'd walk a hundred miles\n\nIf I could make it to the end\n\nOh just to see a smile\n\nYou see it in their faces\n\nThe sadness in their tears\n\nThe desperation and the anger\n\nMadness and the fear\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nNo hope, no life, just pain and fear\n\nNo food, no love, just greed is here\n\nStarvation and the hunger\n\nThe suffering and the pain\n\nThe agonies of all-out war\n\nWhen will it come again ?\n\nThe struggle for the power\n\nA tyrant tries again\n\nJust what the hell is going on ?\n\nWhen will it ever end ?\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nYou see the full moon float\n\nYou watch the red sun rise\n\nWe take these things for granted\n\nBut somewhere someone's dying\n\nContaminated waters\n\nPollution and decay\n\nJust waiting for disease to strike\n\nOh will we learn someday ?\n\nNo hope, no life, just pain and fear\n\nNo food, no love, no seed, childhood's end.\n\n6. Wasting Love\n\n[Dickinson/Gers]\n\nMaybe one day I'll be an honest man\n\nUp 'til now I'm doing the best I can\n\nLong roads. Long days of sunrise to sunset\n\nOf sunrise to sunset\n\nDream on brothers while you can\n\nDream on sisters I hope you will find the one\n\nAll of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time\n\nSpend your days full of emptiness\n\nSpend your years full of loneliness\n\nWasting love, in a desperate caress\n\nRolling shadows of night\n\nDream on brothers while you can\n\nDream on sisters I hope you will find the one\n\nAll of our lives, covered up quickly by the tides of time\n\nSands are flowing and the lines are in your hand\n\nIn your eyes I see the hunger, and the desperate cry that tears the night\n\nSpend your days full of emptiness\n\nSpend your years full of loneliness\n\nWasting love, in a desperate caress\n\nRolling shadows of night\n\n7. The Fugitive\n\n[Harris]\n\nOn a cold October morning\n\nAs frost lay on the ground\n\nWaiting to make my move\n\nI made no sound\n\nWaiting for the mist to cover all around\n\nI carefully picked my time then took the wall\n\nI'm sick and tired of running\n\nThe hunger and the pain\n\nA stop to look about then off again\n\nBeing at the wrong place\n\nAnd at the wrong time\n\nSuspected of a hit that was my crime\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nI am a fugitive being hunted down like game\n\nI am a fugitive but I've got to clear my name\n\nAlways looking 'round me\n\nForever looking back\n\nI'll always be a target for attack\n\nEvery morning onwards\n\nAlways on the run\n\nWaiting for a sight of a loaded gun\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nEven if I find them\n\nAnd get to clear my name\n\nI know that things can never be the same\n\nBut if I ever prove\n\nMy innocence some day\n\nI've got to get them all to make them pay\n\n[Chorus:]\n\n8. Chains Of Misery\n\n[Dickinson/Murray]\n\nThere's a madman in the corner of your eye\n\nHe likes to pry into your sunlight\n\nHe wants to burst into the street with you and I\n\nA world of shadows and of rain\n\nHe's seen what love is...\n\nHe wants to pay you back with guilt...\n\nHe lies to you he won't let you be\n\nHe's got your chains of misery\n\nHe won't be still 'til he's turned your key\n\nHe holds your chains of misery\n\nThere's a prophet in the gutter in the street\n\nHe says, \"You're damned!\" and you believe him...\n\nHe's got a vision but it shines out through your eyes\n\nA world of hatred and fear...\n\nHe's felt what love means...\n\nHe wants to pay you back with pain\n\nHe lies to you he won't let you be\n\nHe's got your chains of misery\n\nHe won't be still 'til he's turned your key\n\nHe holds your chains of misery\n\nHe lies to you he won't let you be\n\nHe's got your chains of misery\n\nHe won't be still 'til he's turned your key\n\nHe holds your chains of misery\n\nIt's only love that holds the key to your hearts... only love...\n\nIt's only love\n\nHe lies to you he won't let you be\n\nHe's got your chains of misery\n\nHe won't be still 'til he's turned your key\n\nHe holds your chains of misery\n\nHe lies to you he won't let you be\n\nHe's got your chains of misery\n\nHe won't be still 'til he's turned your key\n\nHe holds your chains of misery\n\n9.

Judas Be My Guide\n\n[Dickinson/Murray]\n\nLights out\n\nWe live in a world of darkness\n\nNo doubt\n\nEverything's up for sale\n\nWe sleep\n\nAll of the world is burning\n\nWe pray to god for a better deal\n\nNothing is sacred back then or now\n\nEverything's wasted\n\nIs that all there is?\n\nCan I go now?\n\nJudas, my guide\n\nWhispers in the night\n\nJudas, my guide\n\nFight wars, die in a blaze of glory\n\nCome home, meat in a plastic sack\n\nFall down\n\nBetter pray to your god for mercy\n\nSo kneel and help the blade cut clean\n\nNothing is sacred back then or now\n\nEveryone's wasted\n\nIs that all there is?\n\nIs that it now?\n\nJudas, my guide\n\nWhispers in the night\n\nJudas, my guide\n\nJudas, my guide\n\nWhispers in the night\n\nJudas, my guide\n\n[Solo]\n\nI live in the black\n\nI have no guiding light\n\nI'm whispering in your dreams\n\nJudas, my guide\n\nWhispers in the night\n\nJudas, my guide\n\nJudas, my guide\n\nWhispers in the night\n\nJudas, my guide\n\n11.

Fear Of The Dark\n\n[Harris]\n\nI am a man who walks alone\n\nAnd when I'm walking a dark road\n\nAt night or strolling through the park\n\nWhen the light begins to change\n\nI sometimes feel a little strange\n\nA little anxious when it's dark\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a constant fear that something's always near\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a phobia that someone's always there\n\nHave you run your fingers down the wall\n\nAnd have you felt your neck skin crawl\n\nWhen you're searching for the light?\n\nSometimes when you're scared to take a look\n\nAt the corner of the room\n\nYou've sensed that something's watching you\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a constant fear that something's always near\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a phobia that someone's always there\n\nHave you ever been alone at night\n\nThought you heard footsteps behind\n\nAnd turned around and no-one's there?\n\nAnd as you quicken up your pace\n\nYou find it hard to look again\n\nBecause you're sure there's someone there\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a constant fear that something's always near\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a phobia that someone's always there\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nWatching horror films the night before\n\nDebating witches and folklore\n\nThe unknown troubles on your mind\n\nMaybe your mind is playing tricks\n\nYou sense, and suddenly eyes fix\n\nOn dancing shadows from behind\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a constant fear that something's always near\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a phobia that someone's always there\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a constant fear that something's always near\n\nFear of the dark, fear of the dark\n\nI have a phobia that someone's always there\n\nWhen I'm walking a dark road\n\nI am a man who walks alone\n\nBruce Dickinson: vocals;\n\nDave Murray: guitar;\n\nJanick Gers: guitar;\n\nSteve Harris: bass guitar;\n\nNicko McBrain: drums.\n\nOthers:\n\nMichael Kenney: keyboards.\n\nLyrics reproduced by kind permission.\n\n(p) 1992 The copyright of this recording is owned by Iron Maiden Holdings Ltd.\n\nUnder exclusive licence to EMI Records Ltd.\n\n(c) 1992 Iron Maiden Holdings Ltd.\n\nProduced by Martin (The Lugger) Birch and Steve Harris.\n\nEngineered by Martin Birch.\n\nMixed by Martin Birch and Steve Harris.\n\nRecorded and Mixed at Barnyard Studios, ESSEX, England.\n\nAssistant Engineer: Mick (Doctor) McKenna.\n\nIllustration: Melvin Grant.\n\nPhotography: George Chin, Phil Anstice.\n\nPackaging: The Complete Works.\n\nIron Maiden F.C. and Merchandising Information.
