        "text": "Intense music, brilliant lyrics, impactful visuals, outstanding live performances, when you put together a whole identity that you carry on for decades, it ends up almost natural for your brand, Iron Maiden, to gain an almost religious status inside your community.\n\nSatanists for some, an outlet from the everyday life and its struggles for others, the heavy metal legends leave no one indifferent. As time passes, the latter perception becomes more and more common. Wearing one of their iconic t-shirts will most likely get people look at you with a smile than anything else.\n\nUp to 17 studio album since the release of Senjutsu, the discography of Iron Maiden keeps growing while retaining its mythical status. If something is poorly covered on media yet, it is their commercial success. We remediate it.\n\nIt may seem easier to sell well through the years when you are an older rock band. In truth, most groups enjoying a significant following, critical acclaim and reccurent sales belong to the golden age of classic rock, from mid-60s to early 70s.\n\nIn the other side, many 80s bands were old news a few years later. Iron Maiden are one of the rare exceptions, which highlights the credit they gained among rock fans through the years.\n\nIn fact, if we check the near 100 bands part of the new wave of British heavy metal listed by Wikipedia, among which Iron Maiden, all the others add for roughtly the same number of cumulative streams on Spotify than Iron Maiden alone, even though it includes popular names like Motörhead and Def Leppard.\n\nThe consistency of their discography and how they managed to build a brand, with the famous example of their fictional character Eddie, certainly helped to conclude on these results.\n\nReaching a store and buying a CD that could be seen as controversial by the general public is a bigger step than simply streaming a song though. So, without ever crossing over to the masses, how many albums have the band been able to sell?\n\nAs usual, I’ll be using the Commensurate Sales to Popularity Concept in order to relevantly gauge their results. This concept will not only bring you sales information for all Iron Maiden albums, physical and download singles, as well as audio and video streaming. In fact, it will also determine their true popularity.\n\nIf you are not yet familiar with the CSPC method, below is a nice and short video of explanations. I fully recommend watching it before getting into the sales figures. Of course, if you are a regular visitor feel free to skip the video and get into the numbers directly.\n\nThe Commensurate Sales to Popularity Concept (CSPC)\n\nThere are two ways to understand this revolutionary concept. In the first place, there is this Scribe video posted below. If you are unaware of the CSPC method, you will get the full idea within just a pair of minutes.\n\nIf you are a mathematical person, and want to know the full method as well as formulas, you can read the full introduction article.\n\nNow let’s get into the artist’s sales figures in detail in order to apply this concept and define the act’s true popularity!\n\nIron Maiden Album Sales\n\nOriginal Album Sales – Comments\n\nObviously, Iron Maiden have no Back In Black, IV, or Metallica‘s black album. Their covers alone used to be seen as too shocking, nowhere near consensual enough to break over the main audience.\n\nThis being said, every new album of the band have been a major event inside the metal community, and catalog sales of their classics have been healthy and steady through many years.\n\nTheir figures, with each of their first 7 albums posting from 4.2 million to 8.3 million sales, reveal the massive loyalty of their fans, who tend to be completists with the group, picking up all their albums.\n\nVarious sets of reissues came out in recent times, showing that even the most recent releases become great catalog sellers on their own unlike most artists who continue to sell only products from their hey-days.\n\nThanks to this, 90s albums No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark are past 3 million too, while even the Bruce Dickinson-less (the band’s singer from 1981 to 1993 and since 1999 to date) albums X Factor and Virtual XI sold upwards of a million.\n\nThey maintained sales of over a million per release until 2015’s The Book of Souls. So far, Senjutsu is half way to this mark, but all numbers should be valued keeping in mind how many years of catalog sales they had, while this later release has been on sale for two months only.\n\nIn total, their 17 studio albums add for 56.8 million sales, an average of 3.3 million per disc. No need to say that securing this average throughout over 40 years and 17 releases while never appealing to the masses is stunning.\n\nIron Maiden Songs Sales\n\nPhysical Singles\n\nAs a reminder, the weighting is done with a 10 to 3 ratio between one album and one physical single.\n\nMetal acts tend to sell few physical singles, and Iron Maiden are no exception.\n\nOn paper, one can easily claim they were super successful since they scored an impressive 17 UK Top 10 hits.\n\nThis statistic shows chart facts can be misleading to reveal the popularity of an artist.\n\nIn fact, when we take a deeper look, during their golden period from 1980 to 1986, they only got one top 10 single – the 200k+ seller Run to the Hills, a #7 hit which lasted 5 weeks inside the top 20.\n\nFrom 1988 to 2007, when they weren’t as strong and faced their worst period in 1994-98, they dropped 21 singles, never charting lower than #21 with 16 of them hitting the top 10.\n\nBring Your Daughter… to the Slaughter even managed a couple of weeks at #1.\n\nThe thing is, all these singles debuted high thanks to the already existing fanbase, often benefiting from weak weeks to chart high on not-that-strong sales as with their only chart topper released for New Year’s eve.\n\nTheir last top 10, 2007’s Different World, illustrates the situation very well as after debuting as high as #3, it was down to #73 a fortnight later.\n\nAnother misleading conclusion from their UK top 10 tally is that one tends to see it as an universal truth. In truth, they sold 2.4 million in the UK outside of their 4.6 million global total. It’s just that UK music fans had this culture of collecting singles for very long.\n\nIn Germany for example, where the band is just as strong as in the UK, they have never got a top 20 hit. In spite of this, it remains their second largest market for physical singles sales.\n\nThese comments also mean that it isn’t that relevant to detail single by single sales, as they are barely reflective of their organic popularity.\n\nThe only numbers that can be regarded as somewhat telling are the ones from their 80s singles.\n\nOn them, we can see that Run to the Hills is the strongest seller at 585,000. This feels very natural as it was the lead single of their biggest era, supporting the album on its way to become the first ever new wave heavy metal #1 LP in the UK.\n\nRunning Free, The Number of the Beast, Flight of Icarus, The Trooper, 2 Minutes to Midnight and Can I Play with Madness are the remaining 200,000 plus sellers.\n\nIf several of them are definitive metal classics, we will see that not all of them belong to the most remembered tracks of the band.\n\nIt’s worth noting that in these days of physical singles’ collectors resurgence, the band has yet to exploit the field as they haven’t issue a new title nor a reissue since 2016’s Empire of the Clouds.\n\nDigital songs\n\nAs a reminder, the weighting is done with a 10 to 1,5 ratio between one album and one digital single.\n\nNo, Iron Maiden have no Jump, Nothing Else Matters, Sweet Child O Mine or Livin’ On A Prayer.\n\nThey do have an entire discography of relevant tracks. Even with no well remembered hit, Iron Maiden songs add for 250,000 downloads sold, while Killers‘ songs are at 180,000.\n\nFigures grow with the next albums. The Number of the Beast title track stands at 640,000, Run to the Hills is over half a million while the epic Hallowed Be Thy Name is strong too at 370,000.\n\nIn total, songs from this album sold 1.67 million, which is almost as much as some of the largest crossover hits from the 80s.\n\nThe Trooper tops them all still at nearly 800,000. Flight of Icarus has a good residual popularity as well, same as Aces High, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Can I Play with Madness all well over 100,000 sales.\n\nWasted Years at 390,000 and the later Fear of the Dark at 690,000 show that the band’s greatest years lasted for over a decade.\n\nTracks from 1994 onwards aren’t as strong, but they continued to show some consistency, with Dance of Death climbing the highest at 130,000.\n\nObviously, the lower popularity of the band in markets with strong downloads like the US and South Korea doesn’t help their sales in this format.\n\nIn total, while individual numbers reveal a good lasting appeal, the combined sales of 7.1 million downloads and ringtones is somewhat disappointing.\n\nStreaming\n\nStreaming is made up of audio and video streams. Our CSPC methodology now includes both to better reflect the real popularity of each track. The main source of data for each avenue is respectively Spotify and YouTube.\n\nTo factor in the growing impact of multiple Asian countries where these platforms aren’t always the go-to site for music streaming, more sources have been added.\n\nIn order to account for their real popularity in each relevant country, the below sources have been used along with the mentioned ratios that reflect the market share of each area.\n\nAudio Streams\n\n– South Korea : Genie streams * 3.05 (consistent with Gaon streaming numbers)\n\n– Japan : AWA streams * 100/5.5 (AWA has 5.5% of the Japanese streaming market)– Elsewhere : Spotify streams * (370 – 8.5 – 9.5 – 33 – 9) / 207 (370 million global subscribers minus 8.5 million from South Korea minus 9.5 million from Japan minus 33 million from China divided by the number of Spotify only users minus 9 million more Asian users) + Genie streams * 3.05 (uses Genie rather than Spotify to extrapolate markets like Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam)\n\nVideo Streams– China* : QQ video streams * 50 if the song is available for audio stream, QQ video streams * 5 elseway (scale built based on known figures for several major artists)– Elsewhere : Youtube views\n\n*since 96.4% of Chinese streaming platforms are free users, that paid-for users pay less than $2 a month and that they are also used as video streaming platforms, their streams are weighted on par with YouTube streams.\n\nAudio Stream value – 1500 plays equal 1 album unit\n\nVideo Stream value – 11,750 views equal 1 album unit\n\nEquivalent Albums Sales (EAS) = ( Spotify * 310/207 + Genie * 3.05*2 + AWA * 100/5.5 ) / 1500 + ( QQ views* 50(or 5) + YouTube ) / 11750\n\nTop Hits\n\nAlthough it leads 4 out of the 5 platforms listed, the total equivalent album sales from streams of The Trooper barely edges out totals of the next two.\n\nAlong with Fear of the Dark and Run to the Hills, these trio of songs register roughly 250,000 sales a piece, massive numbers for songs never aired on radio outside of specialists’ stations.\n\nThe Number of the Beast and Hallowed Be Thy Name land at 4 and 5, both over 100,000 units too, same as 2 Minutes to Midnight. Wasted Years will get there before the end of 2021.\n\nJust like with their albums, it’s nearly impossible to define a clear winner, with obviously no signature song outshadowing the rest of their discography.\n\nOnce again the consistency of the band is amazing. They score 48 songs with more than 10 million streams on Spotify, 143 which top 2 million, that is almost their entire career output.\n\nThe biggest album is The Number of the Beast at 626,000 units, followed by Fear of the Dark at 395,000 and Piece of Mind at 381,000.\n\nFull catalog breakdown\n\nIf you are familiar with the artist’s catalog and want to check details of each and every song, you can access to all of them right here.\n\nKeep yourself up to date\n\nOur website provides you a fantastic tool which fetches updated Spotify streams as you request them, use it to watch these results grow day after day!\n\nIron Maiden compilations sales\n\nIt sounds fairly logical to add together weighted sales of one era – studio album, physical singles, downloads, streams – to get the full picture of an album’s popularity. For older releases though, they also generate sales of various live, music videos and compilation albums.\n\nAll those packaging-only records do not create value, they exploit the value originating from the parent studio album of each of its tracks instead. Inevitably, when such compilations are issued, this downgrades catalog sales of the original LP.\n\nThus, to perfectly gauge the worth of these releases, we need to re-assign sales proportionally to its contribution of all the compilations which feature its songs. The following table explains this method.\n\nThe distribution process\n\nHow to understand this table? In the example of Live After Death, these figures mean it sold 5,955,000 units worldwide. The second statistics column means all versions of all the songs included on this package add for 1,288,235 equivalent album sales from streams of all types.\n\nThe second part on the right of the table shows how many equivalent streams are coming from each original album, plus the share it represents on the overall package.\n\nThus, streaming figures tell us songs from the The Number of the Beast album are responsible for 46% of the Live After Death appeal. This means it generated 2,753,000 of its 5,955,000 album sales and so forth for the other records. We then apply this process to all compilations present on below table.\n\nCompilations sales figures listing\n\nThe profile of the group, with a discography axed around their studio albums, concludes on a lack of compilations. the first real one came out in 1996, after no less than 10 albums. Best of the Beast sold 2.36 million units.\n\nIt was replaced by Edward the Great in 2002, itself replaced by a duo of compilations covering different periods, Somewhere Back in Time for the 80s and From Fear to Eternity for the next two decades.\n\nIn total, these compilations sold 5 million units, an average of 200,000 per year since the first release.\n\nWhere the band really excels is in selling live products. It all started with Live After Death, an album which gained a legendary status, being often rated among the very best live sets of all-time.\n\nCommercially speaking it did wonders as well at nearly 6 million sales so far. The VHS from 1985, reissued as a DVD in 2008, moved an additional 1.15 million.\n\nIt was only the beginning, as live albums and videos have accumulated 16.9 million units sold up to date.\n\nAs a bonus, below is the breakdown of the top selling records.\n\nFull Length related records Sales – Summary\n\nHere is the most underestimated indicator of an album’s success – the amount of compilation sales of all kinds it generated. Due to the dependency of sales of the original studio albums on these releases, they are a key piece of the jigsaw.\n\nThese numbers are obtained by applying the method from the section The distribution process to all packages listed under Compilation sales figures listing category.\n\nExpectedly, The Number of the Beast, home for 3 of their most popular songs, leads this category. Tracks of this era powered over 9 million sales of related products, with nearly 7 million coming from live albums and videos.\n\nPiece of Mind is a strong runner up at nearly 5 million, while both Fear of the Dark and Powerslave are around 3 million.\n\nTotal Album (all types) Sales per Country\n\nPlease note country-specific numbers may miss sales of a few minor releases, although totals are complete.\n\nIron Maiden Career CSPC Results\n\nSo, after checking all the figures, how many overall equivalent album sales has each album by Iron Maiden achieved? Well, at this point we hardly need to add up all of the figures defined in this article!\n\nAlbums CSPC results\n\nIn the following results table, all categories display figures in equivalent album sales. If different, pure sales are listed between parentheses.\n\n'Av.' stands for Average, 'LD' for Last Day.\n\nAs a reminder:\n\nStudio Album: sales of the original album\n\nOther Releases: sales of compilations generated thanks to the album\n\nPhysical Singles: sales of physical singles from the album (ratio 3/10)\n\nDownload Singles: sales of digital singles from the album (ratio 1,5/10)\n\nStreaming: equivalent album sales of all the album tracks (ratio 1/1500 for Audio stream and 1/6750 for Video stream)\n\nArtist career totals\n\nSee where the artist ranks among remaining singers\n\nEven if numbers are close on many metrics, The Number of the Beast still manages to lead all 5 sales avenues. With over 8 million pure sales, 9 million sales of compilations generated and over 1 million units from singles formats, it closes counts on 18.76 million. It’s big enough to join Michael Jackson and Queen inside 1982’s top 3.\n\nPiece of Mind hits 8 digits as well with a total of 12.25 million. Powerslave will reach this milestone at some point too as it stands at 8.9 million.\n\nFear of the Dark ranks at 4 on their personal list with almost 7.5 million sales.\n\nAll their remaining 1980-1988 stand around 6 million. The band records 8 albums over the 5 million mark.\n\nSales of The Final Frontier and The Book of Souls by the time of this article are perfect to reflect the band’s consistency for the latter part of their career as they are tied at 1,299,000 units.\n\nWhen everything is said and done and once we consider their absence of general public crossover, Iron Maiden achieve a near miraculous score of 87.87 million equivalent album sales to date, a tally that keeps growing day after day.\n\nSingles CSPC results\n\nThe list is compiled in album equivalent sales generated by each song. Therefore, these figures are not merged units of singles formats. Instead, it includes weighted sales of the song’s physical single, download, ringtone and streaming as well as its share among sales of all albums on which it is featured.\n\n1. 1983 – Iron Maiden – The Trooper [Piece of Mind] – 9,660,000\n\n2. 1982 – Iron Maiden – Run to the Hills [The Number of the Beast] – 7,690,000\n\n3. 1982 – Iron Maiden – The Number of the Beast [The Number of the Beast] – 5,790,000\n\n4. 1992 – Iron Maiden – Fear of the Dark [Fear of the Dark] – 5,360,000\n\n5. 1986 – Iron Maiden – Wasted Years [Somewhere in Time] – 4,130,000\n\n6. 1982 – Iron Maiden – Hallowed Be Thy Name [The Number of the Beast] – 3,960,000\n\n7. 1984 – Iron Maiden – 2 Minutes to Midnight [Powerslave] – 3,950,000\n\n8. 1984 – Iron Maiden – Aces High [Powerslave] – 2,940,000\n\n9. 1981 – Iron Maiden – Wrathchild [Killers] – 1,970,000\n\n10. 1988 – Iron Maiden – The Evil That Men Do [Seventh Son of a Seventh Son] – 1,780,000\n\n11. 1988 – Iron Maiden – Can I Play with Madness [Seventh Son of a Seventh Son] – 1,750,000\n\n12. 1980 – Iron Maiden – Phantom of the Opera [Iron Maiden] – 1,590,000\n\n13. 1979 – Iron Maiden – Iron Maiden [Iron Maiden] – 1,420,000\n\n14. 1980 – Iron Maiden – Running Free [Iron Maiden] – 1,320,000\n\n15. 1981 – Iron Maiden – Killers [Killers] – 1,130,000\n\n16. 1990 – Iron Maiden – Bring Your Daughter… to the Slaughter [No Prayer for the Dying] – 1,010,000\n\nIf you feel inspired by this list, we just created this CSPC Iron Maiden playlist on Spotify!\n\nDiscography results\n\nThanks to our new ASR (Artist Success Rating) concept, we know that their sales represent 18.77 million times the purchase of their entire discography.
