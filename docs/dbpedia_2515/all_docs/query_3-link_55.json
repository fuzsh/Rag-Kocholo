        "text": "Pearl Jam\n\nDark Matter\n\n3.5\n\ngreat\n\nReview\n\nby doofy USER (29 Reviews)\n\nApril 25th, 2024 | 21 replies\n\nRelease Date: 04/19/2024 | Tracklist\n\nReview Summary: Serious Matter\n\nThere’s nothing more suspicious than a claimed ‘late career return to form album’ and we’ve witnessed more than a few of these recently, most notably from the Rolling Stones and Foo Fighters. While both those releases were perfectly fine and justified their existences beyond that I really wasn’t convinced; getting to know those albums still took a lot of good will and frequently felt like homework.\n\nSo what of Pearl Jam, a band now twelve albums deep and who’ve probably been operating in the semi wilderness ever since they released a self titled album where they admitted to identifying as an avocado. Well, album numero eleven, ‘Gigaton’, was cruelly dubbed a ‘gigaflop’, like one of those summer blockbusters that actually loses the film studio money and leaves the cinema in the blink of an eye. A jumbo Mars bar for anyone who can hum a song from that one from memory {places Mars bar safely back into coat pocket and pats it}.\n\nMy first impressions of ‘Dark Matter’ were that it was more immediate than its predecessor but could fall into the same trap as ‘Backspacer’ where a certain disposable feel would eventually torpedo any depth or longevity. This remained the state of play for the next few return visits, and then something most unexpected happened…I started anticipating my next listen. The impossible had come to pass; I’d found myself choosing to return to a new Pearl Jam for reasons of unbridled enjoyment.\n\nAs with most great rock albums ‘Dark Matter’ knows to start strong and the first five songs are a well sequenced run, like an upgrade on the similarly bold opening stretch of the aforementioned ‘Backspacer’. The opener boasts strong Vedder vocals and an upbeat throwback feel without overcooking it; ‘React, Respond’ is hands down one of the band’s most fun uptempo numbers with a genuine feel of mania to it; ‘Wreckage’ is an effortless sounding ballad that works as a showcase for the trademark Vedder bleat we all love; ‘Dark Matter’ is the track that most aims for a more ‘modern’ take on rock which equates to them beating Royal Blood at a similar game; and ‘Won’t Tell’ is a radio play courting singalong with a soaring quality to the chorus and bridge.\n\nThe second half of the album is patchier but the quality doesn’t fall off a cliff, and more than that, two of the very best songs are saved for later in the form of the ‘emotional heart’ of the record that’s ’Waiting for Stevie’, and the expected well judged atmospheric closer ‘Setting Sun’. ‘Running’ was selected as a single and while not one of PJ’s most memorable punk numbers it does add some thrust to ‘Side B’. ‘Got to Give’ is a more than pleasant ‘by the numbers’ would-be anthem of the sort the band have specialised in from the very start, and if the sing-song’y and somewhat fluffy ‘Something Special’ is the low point of this set then really that’s not so low a basement to contend with.\n\nA resounding triumph from whatever angle you look at it, ‘Dark Matter’ is the comeback special that shows why fans of ‘long past their best’ acts will always cling to that flicker of hope in their hearts; after at least four false dawns this is the real deal.\n\nTweet\n\nRecent reviews by this authorJohn Grant The Art of the LiePerry Blake Death Of A Society GirlBonny Light Horseman Keep Me on Your Mind/See You FreeRichard Thompson Ship to ShoreArab Strap I'm Totally Fine With It Don't Give a Fuck AnymoreStill House Plants If I don’t make it, I love u"
