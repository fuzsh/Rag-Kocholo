        "text": "Dead & Company's tour starts next month and includes a Tampa date. Since forming in 2015, the band has performed numerous songs from \"In the Dark.\"\n\nIt should be another fun summer for Grateful Dead fans thanks to offshoot band Dead & Company embarking on its latest nationwide tour next month (the band plays in Tampa Oct. 7). Featuring founding guitarist and vocalist Bob Weir and original drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann – with guitarist/singer John Mayer, bassist Oteil Burbridge and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti – Dead & Company have delivered crowd-pleasing, three-hour performances of beloved Grateful Dead material since 2015. Ahead of the band coming to your town, be sure to immerse yourself in classic Dead albums such as “Live/Dead,” “Workingman's Dead,” “American Beauty,“ “Europe ’72” and the holy grail of concert performances, “Cornell 5/8/77,” which was finally given an official release in 2017. Oh, and also be sure to listen to “In the Dark,” which is the best album the Dead ever released – even if Deadheads won't dare admit it.\n\nDeadheads: 10 most annoying things Grateful Dead fans say\n\nLive Dead: 5 essential Grateful Dead live albums\n\nIssued this week in 1987, “In the Dark” forever altered the Grateful Dead's fanbase and concert scene, with the band transitioning from playing relatively intimate amphitheaters and the kind of 10,000-capacity arenas used by minor league hockey teams to a steady stream of 50,000-seat football stadium dates – while more and more people showed up for the party (often just remaining in the parking lot) rather than the music. Yes, Deadheads blame “In the Dark” and its hit single “Touch of Grey” for destroying the hippie utopia of a Dead show. In fact, the worst insult to hurl at a Dead fan is to call him a “Touchhead.” And that's why no self-respecting Deadhead will ever cite 1987's \"In the Dark\" as the band’s best album, which is silly.\n\nMore summer shows: 15 biggest concerts coming to Florida in summer 2021\n\nTicket Newsletter: Sign up to receive the latest news on things to do, restaurants and more every Friday\n\nFrom ‘Touch of Grey’ to ‘Black Muddy River,’ the brilliance of ‘In the Dark’\n\nPerhaps the greatest reason “In the Dark” ranks as the Dead’s strongest album is that the band spent years writing and perfecting the material. The lead track and single “Touch of Grey,” for instance, debuted as the encore performance of a concert at the old Capital Centre in Maryland in 1982, just two years after the Dead released its last studio album “Go to Heaven” and nearly five years before the band issued the song as a single. That single, by the way, is a slice of pop-rock (OK, Dad rock) perfection. Written by longtime Dead lyricist Robert Hunter reportedly in 1980, with Garcia giving the song the bouncy melody that propelled it up the pop charts, it's incredibly catchy with one memorable, bittersweet and often humorous line after another building to the exuberant chorus of “I will get by, I will survive.” In fact, after Garcia survived a diabetic coma in 1986, the first song he performed when he stepped on stage with the Grateful Dead was, you guessed it, “Touch of Grey,” one of the most life-affirming anthems in the rock 'n' roll canon.\n\nYes, Hunter and Garcia are responsible for many of the band's best songs, from the psychedelic “Dark Star” and the funky “Scarlet Begonias” in the 1960s and '70s to the peppy “Touch of Grey” and poignant “So Many Roads”\" in the 1980s and '90s. In fact, when the Dead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in '94, Hunter was the lone non-performer included along with the musicians. However, what makes “In the Dark” so uniformly entertaining is the songwriting contributions of Weir and lyricist John Perry Barlow, who had collaborated since 1971. The two co-wrote several songs for the album including “Hell in a Bucket,” the second track on the album, which they composed along with keyboardist Brent Mydland. It’s a propulsive, cowbell-laced kiss-off from the perspective of a biker whose woman done him wrong. Again, like “Touch of Grey,” with an irresistible sing-along chorus: “I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe, but at least I'm enjoying the ride.”\n\nAs with most great albums, “In the Dark” is smartly sequenced, with the third track, the Garcia/Hunter original “When Push Comes to Shove,” adding levity to the mix with playfully engaging lyrics and an upbeat melody featuring honky-tonk piano by Mydland. Hunter later collaborated with Bob Dylan and this song definitely owes a debt to him, recalling the deceptively simple, country songs Dylan released in the late 1960s and early '70s. “When Push Comes to Shove” is a fine standalone – and it also serves as an ideal setup for the delightfully mysterious “My Brother Esau.”\n\n“My Brother Esau,” by the way, does not appear on the original vinyl version of “In the Dark” nor the CD. It does, however, appear as the final song on the first side of the cassette of “In the Dark,” which is what I grew up listening to in the 1980s. (“My Brother Esau” was also issued as the B-side to the “Touch of Grey” single.) Written by Barlowe and Weir, it’s perhaps my favorite tune on the album, or at least the one I find myself revisiting most frequently. Riding a mid-tempo melody goosed by great guitar work including some tasty slide, the song features the ingenious lyric about “shadowboxing the apocalypse” with Weir selling each line with the conviction of a true believer. But what’s the song about? Sibling rivalry (“my father favored Esau, who was eager to obey”), I believe, or maybe sibling estrangement (“more my brother looks like me, the less I understand”). Perhaps not as perilous as Cain and Abel, but serious all the same, with definite consequences (“we shadow dance the silent war within, the shadow dance, it never ends”).\n\nAnother Garcia/Hunter original, “West L.A. Fadeaway” is a dark blues perfectly echoing the lyrics about life on the seedier side of Los Angeles. Garcia does a fine job getting into character for the first-person narrative about a guy who gets sideways with the mob. “Looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do,” Garcia sings like a man up to absolutely no good. “I don’t want to rent it, I just want to use it for a minute or two.” The song also features some of Garcia’s most striking guitar solos of the era.\n\nA member of the Grateful Dead from ’79 to ’90, Brent Mydland was a gifted keyboardist, but just a mediocre songwriter with a singing voice best described as an acquired taste, which is the reason the Dead’s next album, 1989’s “Built to Last” – containing four Mydland originals, all of which he sang – bombed. The Mydland original “Tons of Steel,” though, which kicks off the second side of “In the Dark,” has always been a hidden gem in the Dead’s vast library. A breezy melody and bright synths carry an impassioned vocal with a train metaphor describing a failing relationship, a topic Mydland explored again and again but never with the same deft touch.\n\nDespite originating in San Francisco in the mid-1960s, the Grateful Dead rarely released topical or political songs with the best exception being the Weir/Barlow masterstroke “Throwing Stones.” Borrowing a bit of its melody from “Ring Around the Rosie” and then the refrain, the song is a witty indictment of a “world full of petty wars” with the killer chorus of “So the kids, they dance, they shake their bones, and the politicians throwing stones, singing ashes, ashes, all fall down, ashes, ashes, all fall down.” The Dead’s urgent, expertly recorded studio version of the song is the second to last track on the “In the Dark” and was also issued as a single, with “When Push Comes to Shove” as the B-side, making for a judicious pairing.\n\n“In the Dark” closes with the Garcia/Hunter ballad “Black Muddy River” featuring one of Garcia’s most emotive vocals. Hunter is quoted as saying the song is “about the perspective of age and making a decision about the necessity of living in spite of a rough time, and the ravages of anything else that’s going to come at you. When I wrote it, I was writing about how I felt about being 45 years old and what I’ve been through. And then when I was done with it, obviously it was for the Dead.” When the Dead recorded the song, Garcia was also in his mid-40s and had recently survived the diabetic coma that left him having to relearn how to play guitar. It’s a beautiful song and the perfect closer for an album that touches on so many emotions without ever sounding forced or fake.\n\nSuperstardom and stadiums, with MTV and Dylan, in the summer of '87\n\nThe Grateful Dead recorded “In the Dark” over a week in January ’87 with MTV debuting the video of the Dead’s new single “Touch of Grey,” featuring the skeleton marionettes, June 19. A couple of weeks later, the Dead embarked on the tour with Dylan that found the band playing six packed stadium shows on both coasts with attendance reportedly totaling nearly 350,000. When the Dylan and Dead tour launched on July Fourth, the Dead opened by playing four consecutive songs from \"In the Dark\" starting with a spirited “Touch of Grey” followed by equally energetic renditions of “Hell in a Bucket,” “West L.A. Fadeaway” and “Tons of Steel.” The band closed the set with a top-shelf “Throwing Stones.” “In the Dark” came out two days later. (The 2004 reissue of the album features five bonus tracks including the “Throwing Stones” from July 4, 1987.)\n\nOn the popular website Grateful Dead of the Day, for instance, the author chooses the July 8, 1987, date at the Roanoke Civic Center (now Berglund Center) in Virginia – one that opens with a powerhouse \"Hell in a Bucket\" and encores with a touching \"Black Muddy River\" – as the end of an era.\n\n\"The Dead would never be the same after this day in 1987. 'In the Dark' hit the store shelves two days prior, and 'Touch of Grey' was already moving up the Billboard charts. Moreover, the high-profile Dylan and the Dead tour had just kicked off on Independence Day. This show at the 10,000-seat Roanoke Civic Center would be the last before the crowds descended on Dead tour, forever reshaping the experience and the band itself.\"\n\n“In the Dark” peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 on Aug. 22, 1987. It’s the Dead's lone album to crack the Top 10 and the band’s highest position on the chart since “From the Mars Hotel” reached No. 16 in 1974. Following five shows at Madison Square Garden, including the legendary Sept. 18th show eventually included on the “30 Trips Around the Sun” boxed set, “Touch of Grey” peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 on Sept. 26, 1987. No other previous Dead single had ever reached higher than No. 64, which is where “Truckin’” landed in 1971. The Dead never again charted a single on the Hot 100 with the band's only other album to reach the Billboard 200 being last year's multi-disc, 50th-anniversary reissue of “American Beauty,” which peaked at No. 19.\n\n‘In the Dark’ still sounds fresh today\n\nSure, “Workingman’s Dead” and “American Beauty,” both issued in 1970, are the Dead’s most acclaimed and historically important studio albums. But, to my ears at least, there’s a folky, country-rock sameness to those releases that just doesn’t hold up as well to repeat listening. Plus, as a guy in my mid-40s, I simply just relate more to the songs on “In the Dark” than, say “Workingman's Dead” and “American Beauty” classics like “Casey Jones” and “Truckin.’” And while the songs on “In the Dark” don’t lend themselves to the Dead's signature jamming, they continued to be highlights, at least for some of us, at Grateful Dead concerts through 1995.\n\nIn recent years, Dead & Company have included “Touch of Grey,” “West L.A. Fadeaway,” “Throwing Stones” and “Black Muddy River” in their constantly changing setlists, with a nicely paced “Hell in a Bucket” stretched out to about 15 minutes on at least one occasion. And when Dead & Company plays Tampa’s Midflorida Credit Union Amphitheatre on Oct. 7, I’ll be thrilled to hear any of those while quietly wishing and hoping for the opportunity to witness 20,000 people sing “I will get by, I will survive.” It’s impossible to deny the charms of “Touch of Grey.” As witty as it is heartwarming with a ridiculously hummable melody, I find it as appealing today as when it inundated the airwaves 34 years ago. And to hate on it – or any of the other timelessly endearing songs on “In the Dark” – is just silly."
