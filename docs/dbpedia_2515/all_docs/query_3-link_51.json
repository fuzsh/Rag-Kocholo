        "text": "Pink Floyd's album Dark Side of the Moon turns 50 this week. As essential as those songs are to rock and roll history, the album cover is equally iconic.\n\nThe image of the white prism, with the rainbow refracting from it, might even be more well-known than the music itself.\n\nAubrey Powell is one half of the legendary graphic design duo Hipgnosis. He and his late design partner Storm Thorgerson were responsible for that album art.\n\nThey were the go-to studio for album design in the 70s and 80s, making art for Led Zeppelin, Peter Gabriel, Black Sabbath, Wings and countless other bands.\n\nAubrey stopped by Commotion to tell the story of his brotherhood with Storm, and the inception of Dark Side of the Moon."
