        "text": "The perfect album cover doesn’t happen overnight.\n\nBlood, sweat, tears, cash, and sleepless nights went into making every album cover on this list.\n\nWe’re here to help you understand what makes a great album cover and give you tips on how to make one using Linearity Curve.\n\nWhat should be on an album cover?\n\nIt’s all about the artwork for album cover designs. Alluring cover art can be one of the most significant factors determining how well an album is received.\n\nWhether you go with pure graphic design, photography, illustration, or a mix of these disciplines, you must ensure it fits the band and the album’s content.\n\nAnother vital consideration is whether or not to feature and photograph the band for the cover or to use artwork and graphic design instead.\n\nSome bands even decide to feature just one or two members of their entire band on the cover. And hey, if you want to start a fight that could break up the band you’re designing for, by all means, go right ahead.\n\nA good marketing and creative team will work together to find solutions that fit the band’s image and the creative meaning behind the album.\n\nNow, let’s talk about why cover art matters.\n\nWhy are album covers important?\n\nIconic album covers can propel an album to the top of the charts, but it’s not an exact science. Cultural relevancy and shock factor can significantly affect how an album cover is received.\n\nSometimes, these covers are created before the band knows how much they will matter. Bands like Nirvana (among many others) created their album art without knowing the impending fame they would experience once it was released.\n\nSome bands, models, and designers of these albums later said they regretted their creation choices. Nonetheless, these covers have gone down in history as iconic designs.\n\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean they were perfect or without flaws. Some were controversial enough to pique people’s interest and garner attention for the album.\n\nNow, this list isn’t necessarily in order of importance (please don’t send us hate mail). It’s meant to demonstrate how album covers can make history and leave a lasting impact on pop culture.\n\nSo, here’s our list of the best album covers of all time.\n\n1. The Beatles, Abbey Road (1969)\n\nThe number one album cover on our list shouldn’t surprise you. It’s a classic for a reason. Not only is it one of the most classic albums musically, but the artwork itself is also a classic.\n\nPhotographer Iain Macmillan captured this image of the Beatles casually walking across London’s Abbey Road, which has since gone down in history.\n\nThe Beatles are widely regarded as the biggest band in history; they truly started the craze around boy bands. Bands like One Direction and the Backstreet Boys have them to thank for the notoriety that boy bands have today.\n\n2. The Velvet Underground and Nico, The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967)\n\nThis classic design by Andy Warhol is one of the most unforgettable covers on this list. Warhol, a famous artist and film director, designed the album cover artwork and was the band’s manager.\n\nSome might say this album cover has become more famous than the album itself. When released, the album didn’t exactly fly up the charts. It largely flopped, leading to the band breaking up and firing Warhol as their manager.\n\nToday, it’s one of the most well-known albums (and covers) of all time.\n\nWhen the banana was peeled back, a flesh-colored banana was pictured underneath—phallic, unique, quite Velvet Underground.\n\n3. Pink Floyd, Dark Side Of The Moon (1973)\n\nThis is another iconic album with an iconic title. This cover features a stark contrast between the dark-as-night background and the white light passing through a prism, which creates the bright colors reflected on the other side.\n\nThe creative team behind the cover, Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell—who also created Led Zeppelin’s House of the Holy (1973) artwork—came up with the concept, and George Hardie carried out their vision.\n\nThis cover was the brainchild of one of their many brainstorming sessions that often stretched into the early mornings.\n\nThe prism visual has become an icon of Pink Floyd and is often seen on T-shirts and posters. Despite the mysterious band’s purposeful lack of promotional work, the album was an overwhelming success.\n\n4. Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin (1969)\n\nLed Zeppelin's debut album cover was nothing short of shocking when it came out.\n\nThe ink drawing created by George Hardie of the Hindenburg airship (adapted from a photo taken by Sam Shere in 1937) with Led Zeppelin in bold red letters launched this now-famous band into popularity.\n\nThe fact that the airship was a zeppelin certainly wasn’t an accident.\n\nFeaturing an image from the Hindenburg disaster was a bold move. But we have to wonder, would something this controversial be received well today? It’s hard to say for sure.\n\nGeorge Hardie (who was paid $76 to create this now-famous drawing) has since said he wished he’d put more thought into using an image of this tragic event.\n\n5. The Beatles, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)\n\nAnother famous The Beatles album cover, Lonely Hearts Club Band features bright, psychedelic colors and prominent figures—58 celebrities, to be exact. How many do you recognize?\n\nThis chaotic collage image includes figures like Marilyn Monroe, Shirley Temple, and Albert Einstein.\n\nPop artists Peter Black and Jan Haworth (who were married then) staged this image, which is said to have been thought of by Paul McCartney himself.\n\nThe album cover cost around $3,000 to make. That amount might not sound like much, but that would be about $50,000 today. At that time, no album artwork had ever cost that much.\n\n6. The Notorious B.I.G., Ready To Die (1994)\n\nThis album cover for Christopher Wallace (best known as The Notorious B.I.G.) started a remarkable career for the then-22-year-old.\n\nHis lyrical prowess is evident in this album, which has had a strong cultural impact. With this album, Biggie is said to have revitalized the East Coast hip-hop scene.\n\nThe stark blank canvas with a small child wearing only a diaper on the cover made a statement about innocence, new life, and vulnerability.\n\nIt all leads back to the concept behind the album: the life cycle of an artist.\n\n7. Nirvana, Nevermind (1991)\n\nNevermind is one of Nirvana’s most popular titles, and the cover is unforgettable.\n\nThe fact that he is reaching for money represents the superficial values we pass on to children in our society, just the kind of statement Nirvana makes with their music.\n\nKurt Cobain, the band’s frontman, came up with the concept, which he allegedly thought of while watching a program about water births.\n\nThe child in question, Spencer Elden, has mixed feelings about having appeared naked on such a momentous album cover.\n\nNevermind wasn’t expected to be the major hit that it was. But in the end, this album cover fit Nirvana's energy perfectly.\n\n8. Fleetwood Mac, Rumors (1977)\n\nFleetwood Mac’s best-selling album has a cover with only 2 band members. It seems strange, we know.\n\nFleetwood Mac is infamous for its group dynamic. The band dated, fought and broke up, and Rumors is known to be based on much of that drama.\n\nThis cover prominently features Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood, while the rest of the band is left out. Nicks is dancing and holding a crystal ball, while Fleetwood stands stoic with a pair of balls hanging between his legs.\n\nAlmost every band member was going through a tumultuous breakup or divorce at the time (some with each other), and that drama and intrigue play out throughout the album and cover art.\n\n9. Blink 182, Enema Of The State (1999)\n\nEvocative and instantly iconic, this image personifies the 90s pop-punk scene. The provocative cover photo of a nurse snapping her rubber gloves into place is hard to forget.\n\nEnema of the State (a play on \"enemy of the state\") was a major success for the band and helped change the future of their genre.\n\nDavid Goldman took this image, and the scantily clad nurse in the picture is adult film actress Janine Lindermulde. Lindermulde was also featured in the “Man Overboard” music video and “What’s My Age Again.”\n\n10. Elvis Presley, Elvis Presley (1956)\n\nThis album introduced Elvis to the world. As the oldest album on this list, this one has some serious prestige. Elvis has been a household name for generations.\n\nThis image was snapped in 1955 while Elvis performed at the Fort Homer Hesterly Armory in Florida. The black-and-white action shot mixed with the colorful pop of large text is eye-catching and original.\n\nThe pink and green letters and unusual font were interesting choices by this album cover's creative team, and they seem to have paid off.\n\nThe Clash later copied this style for their album London Calling, further cementing the memorable style.\n\nThis is one of those classic albums that will go down in history because of its content and cover.\n\n11. The Clash, London Calling (1979)\n\nThe Clash created this album as a direct imitation of Elvis Presley’s debut album cover art, with a similar black and white action shot of them playing, coupled with identical font color and style.\n\nThe band’s bassist, Paul Simonon, is featured on the front smashing his guitar. This image is now displayed in the Cleveland Rock and Rock Hall of Fame.\n\n12. David Bowie, Aladdin Sane (1973)\n\nBowie’s 6th studio album was the first he released after gaining major notoriety in the mainstream media.\n\nBowie falls under the glam rock niche category and is known for his outlandish fashion style and stage presence. With red hair and a lightning bolt drawn on his face, this look leaves a distinctive impression.\n\nThis photo was the most expensive cover album shot by Brian Duffy at the time. To gain notoriety, a genuine effort was made to make the cost of the album record-breaking.\n\n13. Prince, Purple Rain (1984)\n\nAnother outstanding cover cemented in pop culture. Who could forget this image of Prince in a purple suit, posed on a motorcycle?\n\nIn the summer of 1984, Prince flew to the top of the charts with his album Purple Rain. The album, cover art cover, and music video were an instant hit.\n\nThe title track, Purple Rain, is 8 minutes long (this was cut down from a whopping 11 minutes).\n\nThis cover image was photographed at the Warner Bros studio in California, and the background was purposefully made to look like a New York City tenement.\n\nIt’s a perfect sneak peek into what the now-famous music video would look like.\n\n14. Joy Division, Unknown Pleasures (1979)\n\nJoy Division and the designer Peter Seville made an incredible choice in using iconic pulsar radio waves in this cover image.\n\nThis is an excellent example of how a minimalistic yet meaningful design can create an enormous impact.\n\nDisney even created a parody of this album artwork featuring none other than Mickey Mouse.\n\n15. Bruce Springsteen, Born In The U.S.A. (1984)\n\nThis all-American cover image was the perfect aesthetic choice for Springsteen. The image perfectly represented him and his music and made him a cultural icon.\n\nA ballcap tucked into his jeans, a giant American flag in the background, and the simplicity of blue jeans and a white shirt were the perfect representations of country music at the time.\n\nThe album title says it all: Springsteen is the quintessential American boy.\n\nSpringsteen had been well-known for almost a decade when this album was released. Still, this provocative and simple image created an awareness of his music that far exceeded his popularity.\n\n16. The Smiths, Meat Is Murder (1985)\n\nThis iconic cover art is another meant to provoke and create controversy, something the Smiths were familiar with.\n\nThis being only their second studio album, The Smiths made a big splash when it was released.\n\nThe band's lead singer, Morrissey, said the album cover’s design was intended to encourage activists to take a militant approach to their protests. Specifically, the animal rights movement.\n\nA few band members were vegetarians, and Morrissey has always advocated reducing meat consumption.\n\nSurprisingly, this was The Smiths’s only album to reach the elusive number-one spot on the UK’s top billboard charts.\n\n17. Neutral Milk Hotel, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea (1998)\n\nNeutral Milk Hotel might be one of the less well-known bands on this list of mega-stars, but they’re an indie favorite.\n\nChris Bilheimer created the cover for this album, which features an illustration of two people wading in the water, one with a drum over their face.\n\nJeff Mangum, the bandleader, wanted the album artwork to resemble 20th-century penny arcade artwork, so he asked Bilheimer to create something unique.\n\nThe Aeroplane Over the Sea was their second and most well-known album, and it gained them a cult following that eventually led to lead singer Jeff Mangum purposefully fading out of the public eye.\n\n18. The Rolling Stones, Sticky Fingers (1971)\n\nThis brilliant cover perfectly expressed the Rolling Stones' music and persona. It was the first album released on their record label, Rolling Stones Records.\n\nAndy Warhol (who also created the Velvet Underground album cover that captured the #2 spot on this list) considered the artwork for this album.\n\nBilly Name photographed it, and Craig Braun created the design.\n\nThe original cover design for this album included a working zipper that opened to reveal a pair of white boxer briefs. This feature is reminiscent of the Velvet Underground album that Warhol designed.\n\nNotably, this was the first album to feature the iconic tongue-and-lips logo, which later became the band's central icon.\n\n19. Pink Floyd, Wish You Were Here (1975)\n\nPink Floyd is known for its album art. It worked with the design studio Hipgnosis to create both album covers that made our top 20 list.\n\nAubrey “Po” Powell photographed the image, and the handshake featured on the cover was meant to symbolize empty gestures.\n\nIn the photograph, one man is on fire, while the other, dressed in a business suit, casually shakes his hand.\n\nThere are many interpretations, but many think it symbolizes that this gesture is typically made half-hearted and empty and that people tend to hide their real emotions from others.\n\n20. Rage Against The Machine, Rage Against The Machine (1992)\n\nThis debut album by the soon-to-be controversial Rage Against the Machine evokes an emotional response immediately, even if you don’t recognize the famous image it features.\n\nThe 1963 image of the Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức, who set himself on fire in protest of the oppression of Buddhists in Vietnam, is a historically famous image that holds significant meaning. Associated Press correspondent Malcolm Browne took the image.\n\nThe photo taken of this activist gained considerable attention and persuaded then-president John F. Kennedy to withdraw support from Vietnam.\n\nUse Linearity Curve for your album cover designs\n\nIf you’re feeling inspired by all these great covers and want to make your own, we’re here to help.
