        "text": "By: Fr Francis Rodrigues, Raknno\n\nJan. 29, Karkala : The three day festival of the renowned Shrine of St Lawrence in Attur- Karkal began with devotion and solemnity. On Tuesday January 29th, the first day of the three day festival, the first Mass was celebrated at 9.30 a.m. by Fr John Barboza, the Vicar Forane of Karkal deanery. Parish. Rev. Fr Arthur Pereira the Shrine director welcomed the devotees to the annual festival 2013 and honoured the ‘pirjent’.\n\n‘Lord, increase our faith’ is the theme of the annual shrine festival this year according to Fr Arthur Pereira the shrine director. As members of the church or as believers we need to pray to the Lord to increase our faith especially in this year of faith as declared by Pope Benedict XVI. The historical shrine of St Lawrence at Attur-Karkal fills the devotees who come to the shrine with great faith and they pray for in-depth gift of faith in the shrine. The theme is chosen in the context of declaration of the year of faith from October 2012 to November 2013 across the globe by Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nNumber of devotees from different corners of Karnataka and neighbouring states of south India have come into the Shrine. With great devotion they are partaking in the Holy Masses. The visitors are seen devoutly visiting the relic of St Lawrence, confessing their sins, visiting the pool at the shrine and receiving flowers and holy water in the shrine. After every Mass there is a special prayer for the sick in Konkanni as well as Kannada languages. Number of priests are laying hands on the devotees and are praying for health and happiness of the devotees.\n\nAll together there are 30 Masses during the festival this year in Kannada and Konkanni languages including two masses on Monday 28th. There will be 9 masses on the first day, 12 masses on the second day and 7 masses on the last day which is celebrated as the ‘Guiding Mother Festival’ (Giadh Mayechi Porob). The last mass would be at 5.30 p.m. on Thursday.\n\nMost Rev. Dr Aloysius Paul D’Souza the Bishop of Mangalore would be celebrating the special Mass in Kannada at 6.00 p.m. on Tuesday 29th.\n\nThe main festival Mass on Wednesday, January 30th will be celebrated by Most Rev. Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo the Bishop of Udupi at 10.00 a.m. On Thursday, January 31st the festival Mass of ‘Giyadh Mai’ would be celebrated by Very Rev. Msgr Baptist Menezes, the Vicar General of the Diocese of Udupi.\n\nOn Monday, January 28th, there was a special Mass and special prayers for the sick by Fr Alban D’Souza, the director of Stella Mary’s Shrine, Kalmady. As more devotees are expected on Tuesday 29th night special adoration will be held in Kannada from 11.15 p.m. to 12.15 a.m.\n\nAccording to Fr Arthur Pereira the Shrine director the devotees come in lacks to this Shrine with different reasons. To be cured of the mental-physical sicknesses, to experience the quietness of prayer, to experience the peace amidst the number of tensions of life, to thank the Lord for the favours received, to receive the blessings from God etc and etc. Many come in groups by walking devoutly hundreds of KMs to the shrine transcending the barriers of religions."
