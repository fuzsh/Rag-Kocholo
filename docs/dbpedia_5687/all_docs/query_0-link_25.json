        "text": "St. Vincent De Paul Church, Katapadi is situated at a distance of 59 kms to the north of Mangalore on the coast and 7 kms south of Udupi, and is surrounded by Udyavar, Pangala, Pamboor and Kuntalnagar parishes.\n\nKatapadi was once a part of the Udyavar Parish. However, the Catholics living in and around Katapadi found it very difficult to attend their Sunday obligations and avail\n\nreligious and spiritual services as Udyavar Church was quite far away for them. Those were the days of hardships as there was no vehicular facility. Rough roads and swelling Papanashini River made their journey to Udyavar Church much more difficult.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Mathias D’Silva and his sons, J.M. D’Silva and F. X. D’Silva led the people to meet the Bishop of Mangalore, Most Rev. Dr. Victor R. Fernandes in 1945 and convinced him of the need of a separate parish and a church at Katapadi. There were around 130 families belonging to the Udyavar Parish but having their houses far from the church, mainly in the places south of River Papanashini, east up to the frontiers of Belle and Pangla Parishes and to the west up to the Arabian Sea comprising of the villages of Kote, Mattu, Kallappu, Yenagudde, Manipura West and parts of Kurkal. They urged the Bishop to issue a decree for a new parish and church at Katapadi.\n\nBishop Victor R. Fernandes was convinced of the need of the people of Katapadi to have their own parish and church and he instructed them to get the required land and buildings so that he could process the decree for a new parish. He asked the people to buy a large enough piece of land and start building the church as well as a presbytery.\n\nMother Church Udyavar herself being in financial difficulties could not be of any help to the people of Katapadi. Thus, the burden of finding a suitable plot of land and construction of church and presbytery fully fell on the shoulders of the poor and hardworking people of Katapadi. An attempt to purchase sufficient land for the church ended in failure. Finally, sons of Mathias D’Silva bought and donated a plot of 3 Acres and 19 Cents of land valued at Rs.700 in 1948 from a Hindu landlord.\n\nBishop Victor R. Fernandes was kind and generous to the people of Katapadi. He guided the construction of the presbytery, donated the full set of mass vestments, encouraged the youth to get into collecting funds and to work in the construction of the presbytery. The Young Men’s Association joined their hands in this task.\n\nIt was on 16 May 1948, Bishop Victor R Fernandes issued a decree setting up the independent Parish of Katapadi and dedicated it to St Vincent De Paul. The Papanashini River was fixed as the boundary between it and Udyavar. Belle and Pangala Parish boundaries were its limits in the east and the south and Karkala Katapadi Road and Udupi Mangalore Road as far as Kallapu Bridge were its boundaries in the west. The said decree was published at Udyavar Church and the date of its inauguration was fixed on 23 May 1948. Fr. Rosario Fernandes was appointed as the first chaplain at Katapadi who offered Holy Eucharist on the day of the inauguration.\n\nFr. Rosario Fernandes was at Katapadi from 23 May 1948 to 7 November 1948, not even for six months. In these six months he could inspire people and fill them with great spiritual strength and faith. There were certain problems arising out of the purchase of land for the cemetery. The failure to get the necessary sanctions from the civic authorities created a lot of problems. The neighbors objected to the setting up of the cemetery leading to misunderstanding. As a result of these developments the cemetery had to be closed and Bishop Victor R. Fernandes had to reconsider the sanctioning of the parish. On 6 October 948 the Bishop issued a decree of temporarily closing down the presbytery and the church. The parish priest of Shirva served the needs of the people until reopening of the presbytery and appointment of a new chaplain. F X D’Silva, serving as the first administrator of the station rendered great service during this turbulent period.\n\nThe Bishop was willing to reopen the station on fulfillment of the condition of acquiring a plot of land for the cemetery to be set up with the approval of the village panchayat. Albert Pereira came forward to donate 40 cents of his land for the purpose of the parish cemetery. The required licenses were soon acquired and the cemetery was registered in the name of the parish.\n\nAs the conditions laid down by Bishop Victor R. Fernandes were fulfilled, he agreed to appoint Fr. A. J. Tellis as the new chaplain of the Katapadi Church on 12 February1949 who served the people till 24 September 1949. Though his tenure was short, he started three sodalities each for altar boys, girls and women. He also started the Apostleship of Prayer.\n\nIn the absence of a proper chapel or church, the presbytery was used for Eucharistic Celebration and other religious activities. The space in the presbytery was insufficient for the congregation of 130 families. Realizing the need for a spacious chapel, Fr. Tellis laid the foundation stone for building the chapel. However, before he could start the construction work of the chapel, Fr. Tellis was transferred and Fr. A.J. D’Souza took charge of the station on 25 September 1949.\n\nUnder the able leadership of Fr. A.J. D’Souza parishioners worked hard to fulfill their dream of having a chapel. The people had to collect money required for this work and used various ways such as playing band, dancing and singing and also meeting potential donors and philanthropists and collected whatever they could. Many community leaders worked tirelessly and the chapel was completed a record period of 6 months.\n\nDuring the tenure of Fr. D’Souza much needed developmental work was taken up. He beautified the chapel with many statues which he obtained through donations including the statue of the patron saint-St. Vincent De Paul. Fr. D’Souza also involved himself in the activities of economic development of the parish. Moving around, he guided people to take up profitable agricultural activities. He began the work of building the church compound wall. He planted coconut and other useful plants like mango, jackfruit, teakwood and cashew nuts. Fr. D’Souza also got a well dug and inlaid it with laterite stones; leveled the cemetery ground and built the mud enclosure to it and leveled the way leading to it and walled it up on both sides; provided the church with cement floor; and repaired the byroad leading to the church. During this period Bishop Victor R. Fernandes paid the first pastoral visit to the parish on 20 August 1954.\n\nIt was on 12 April 1955, after six years of restless work at Katapadi, Fr. D’Souza was transferred and Fr. J.A.P. Miranda took charge as the next parish priest of Katapadi. Fr. Miranda inspired the people to dream of a fully furnished parish church building. He organized the presbytery, repaired the outhouse and provided cement flooring to both the buildings and organized the filing system of the church documents. He amicably settled the issue of 6 families claiming their allegiance to Udyavar parish and thus brought about the much needed understanding and cooperation.\n\nWhen Fr. J.A.P Miranda took charge of the parish, the finances of the parish were poor and therefore he had to find ways and means to increase the revenue of the church. He installed nine pews and got the altar, sanctuary, doors and windows of the church painted. He installed a huge Crucifix in the middle of the cemetery. He procured for the church the relics of St Vincent De Paul, St Francis Xavier, St Francis Assisi and St Thomas Aquinas. He also propagated the devotion of St Vincent De Paul, conducting Novenas every Thursday. He got the prayer book ‘Sant Vishent Pavlak Noven ani Magnim’ published. Some beautiful hymns were composed during this period, one such being ‘Mogalh patron amchya sant vishent pavla’ by Msgr. Paul Buthello.\n\nFr. A. F D’Souza had planned the construction of a new and spacious church building and had started the new Church Building Fund with only Rs 58.50 in the beginning. The task of fulfilling the plans fell on the shoulders of Fr. J.A.P Miranda. He started organizing various activities to collect much needed funds for the construction work. Unfortunately, construction work was postponed for a full year as the land for the new church could not be finalized. Lawrence Suares of Jeppu, Msgr. D.J. D’Silva and Msgr.W.A Lewis finally inspected and suggested the building of the new church at the western side of the presbytery.\n\nOn 18 February 1960, Most Rev. Dr. Raymond D’Mello, Bishop of Mangalore approved the construction plan and in his absence Msgr. W.A Lewis, the Vicar General laid the foundation stone of the new church building on 25 August 1960.\n\nAs the work of the construction of the new church building was in progress, Fr. Miranda sought the intervention of St Joseph and made a vow to St. Joseph that should he succeed in completing the work without debt and loss of health he would propagate his devotion and devote a side altar in his honor. Within two years the church building was ready and on 19 July 1962, Feast of St Vincent De Paul was celebrated in the new church.\n\nTo keep his word, Fr. Miranda celebrated the votive thanksgiving mass to St Joseph on 5 August 1962 and devotion to St Joseph was started in the parish, Wednesday being earmarked for the novena of the saint. Fr Miranda also built the chapel in the cemetery as the cemetery was a little away from the church and people faced difficulties while attending the funeral services. The Vicar General Msgr. W. A. Lewis, during his pastoral visit blessed the same.\n\nBishop Raymond D’Mello, after his return from the foreign tour blessed and inaugurated the new church on12 May1964. The Bishop also concelebrated the Pontifical High Mass on the next day for the parish feast of St. Vincent De Paul.\n\nAfter 12 years of selfless and dedicated service to the Katapadi Parish, Fr. Miranda was transferred to Valencia and on 28 May 1967, Fr. F.T.M. Lobo took charge as the parish priest of Katapadi Church.\n\nFr. Lobo was a middle-aged man by the time he started his ministry at Katapadi. All necessary buildings being completed at the church he was free to concentrate most of his time for the spiritual good of his people. Looking sick and quiet Fr Lobo spent more time in the confessional, hearing confessions and counseling the parishioners. During his tenure collections for the construction of the belfry were started. On 22 May 1969 Fr Lobo was transferred and Fr. Golbert Noronha took charge as the parish priest.\n\nFr. Noronha, though senior by age was very jovial and spirited. He got the belfry constructed and the bell brought from West Germany by the support of Bishop Raymond D’Mello was installed on 18 July 1970. During this time electrification of the church was done by the support of an anonymous donor and the presbytery was electrified. The Catholic Youth Organization, an association of the parish youth was started, new portico to the church was built, mike set donated by Simon Soares was used during the masses and other church services and a fund for supporting the poor students was raised. On 25 November 1973 the Silver Jubilee of the parish was celebrated.\n\nOn 1 October 1976, Fr.Charles D’Souza took charge as the parish priest of St. Vincent De Paul Church, Katapadi. After having served the nation as a military officer he joined the priestly vocation. Being a simple man with a clear vision, he supported students to acquire higher education. His attempts in this regard went a long way in making the parishioners well educated. On 07 April 1978, Fr. Arthur C.A D’Souza took charge as the next parish priest.\n\nUnder Fr. Arthur D’Souza developmental work was given new impetus and at the same time socio-spiritual organizations were given a new direction. The youth organization became stronger. Fredrick Rodrigues donated three chandeliers and other necessary lightings to the church. The electric fans were installed in the sanctuary and church donated by Peter Rodrigues, Catholic Youth Organization members and other parishioners. Martin. R Pinto presented a frame of Our Lady of Assumption. Mr. George Lewis and his children Cynthia and Joyce donated three small chandeliers to the church. Ever active Catholic Youth Organization repaired and rebuilt the cemetery wall.\n\nThe new Grotto to the church was constructed from the donations of Vincent Monteiro. People were so moved by the enthusiasm of Fr. Arthur D’Souza that many people generously donated in kind and cash for the development of the church.\n\nFollowing the passing away of Fr. Arthur D’Souzawhile serving as the parish priest of Katapadi on 5 July 1984, Fr. John Fernandes was appointed as the parish priest on 1 August 1984. Though his stay at Katapadi was short he won the hearts of the parishioners by his spirituality and good nature.\n\nOn 17 May 1986 Fr. Henry Fernandes took charge as the parish priest and served the parishfrom 1986 to 1994 for a period of eight long years. It was during his tenure that many of the unfinished tasks were completed including parochial residence and compound wall. A fund for the support of needy parishioners was organized and interest free loans were given to the parishioners in financial need.\n\nOn 7 May 1994 Fr. Wilfred Gonsalves took charge as the parish priest of Katapadi. Having great love for flora and fauna, he went around inspiring people to get in to agricultural activities. During his term, in 1999 the Golden Jubilee of Vincent De Paul Church, Katapadi was celebrated. To mark the occasion he along with the parishioners planted 50 coconut saplings and drilled the new bore well.\n\nIn the mean time attempts were made to get the Katapadi Parish under the care of the Congregation of the Fathers of the Holy Cross (CSC). The Congregation under the leadership of Fr. Maurice D’Souza CSC started a Holy Cross Students Home at Katapadi in 1982. A request for transfer of the Katapadi Parish was pending with the Bishop of Mangalore. On 14 May 2001, after the transfer of Fr. Wilfred Gonsalves, the charge of the Katapadi Parish was given to the CSC Congregation and Fr. Norbert D’Mello CSC was appointed as its parish priest.\n\nMan of few words but with great capacity for work, Fr. Norbert D’Mello brought about many changes in the life of the parishioners. He got the sanctuary renovated and put up the teak wood ceiling. By the support of Smt. Sophia Soares and her children, he installed a generator and thereby solved the electricity problem. He got the retention walls erected in some parts of the front ground where it was very steep and sloppy. The church roof, portico and the adoration room were re-organized, repaired and rebuilt.

Norbert D’Mello handed over the charge of the parish to Fr. Ronald Fernandes CSC as he had to go for higher studies. During his term as the parish priest, Diamond Jubilee of St. Vincent De Paul Parish, Katapadi was celebrated on 18 May 2008 attended by Bishop Aloysius P. D’Souza.
