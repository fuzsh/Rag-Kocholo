It was announced by Pope Benedict XVI on 16 July 2012.[1] It comprises the six civil talukas Udupi, Bramavara, Karkala, Kapu, Kundapura and Byndoor and is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Bangalore. The diocese now contains 47 parishes, the newly elevated Cathedral which was previously a parish church as \"Church of Our Lady of Miracles\" or the Milagres Church, the parish was partitioned from the Mangalore Diocese, while the parish church was elevated to the Cathedral of Our Lady of Miracles.[2]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Udupi district had been a part of the Diocese of Mangalore since 1887. The diocese was inaugurated on 15 October 2012 by Apostolic Nuncio of India, Salvatore Pennacchio at Milagres Cathedral, Kallianpur.

The Udupi diocese is the 9th in the province, 14th diocese in the state and 166th diocese in the country and is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Bangalore.[4] The Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore (Latin: Diocesis Mangalorensis) is a diocese located in the city of Mangalore in the Ecclesiastical province of Bangalore in India. The diocese falls on the southwestern coast of India. At present, it comprises the whole civil districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in Karnataka state. This region was collectively referred to as South Canara during the British Raj and the early post-independence era, prior to the States Reorganisation Act in 1956.
