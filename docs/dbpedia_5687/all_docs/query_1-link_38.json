        "text": "Don Bosioâ€™s Convent was started at the request of Fr. Nicholas Pereira in 1966 with the aim of strengthening the faith of the Christian Community through education and socio-pastoral service.\n\nBelman is in the District of Udupi with a Catholic population of 2,300. Most of the beneficiaries belong to the lower middle class and to economically poor families. They are often afflicted with moral problems such as alcoholism, superstitious beliefs, broken families etc. which lead to emotional imbalance and moral degradation resulting in increase in the number of HIV/AIDS patients. Being aware of the problems of the people, the sisters take care of the integral formation of the students, foster dignity of labour and eco-awareness. Create awareness of the existing social evils and work towards the eradication of the same."
