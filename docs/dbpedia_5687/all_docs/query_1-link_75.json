Being a member and president of my respective club , we have organised some of the largest blood donation, eye check up camps and plantation drive. we also conducted various events which were very well organised and considering all the achievements of my club, I was offered a role of Leo district president of 317c by our District governor. I took this opportunity with great sense of pride and we worked towards promoting the community services and I also focused on expanding our clubs so that we can get more people to work towards this noble cause. I am proud to say that with the help of our team we were able to set a record of creating the highest number of clubs in the world during my tenure and I received a lot of felicitations and recognition for this achievement from the international directors and president.\n\nI am honoured to be served as a Icym Udupi Diocese president. It was a challenging yet interesting experience, since I took this opportunity during covid and all the activities this organisation was conducting were stopped, it was all numb. But the effort we as a team put towards reviving it is something I would definitely be proud of. There were a total of 48 units from different parishes which we had to look after .

It was a challenging yet interesting experience, since I took this opportunity during covid and all the activities this organisation was conducting were stopped, it was all numb. But the effort we as a team put towards reviving it is something I would definitely be proud of. There were a total of 48 units from different parishes which we had to look after . We started our journey by visiting each unit and discussing the activities, challenges and the new ideas from each unit. We had regular meetings and unit visits conducted every Sunday. We focused on personality development, awareness about the government jobs, raising funds for the needful, we also started a new community of people looking for jobs and we were successful in connecting many of the applicants directly to the industries and this community is still working with the same efficiency .The two successful events we conducted were the Diocese level sports meet YUVAKHEL and the Diocese level youth Convention EMERGE 2022 where more than 1000 youths were gathered and made this event a successful and memorable one.\n\nThis journey taught me so many life lessons as well as Learnings that would be useful for my career. It might be networking, marketing, conducting and hosting large events, collecting funds, being a team leader and many more. It gave me a lot of recognition across my community for which I would be ever grateful."
