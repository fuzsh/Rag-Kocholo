        "text": "Welcome to Our Lady of Miracles Cathedral, Kallianpur! Established on 20.01.1678, Milagres Church became the Cathedral of the Bishop of Udupi Diocese on 15 October 2012. The original church was built in 1700. Tipu Sultan destroyed this church in 1784. It was rebuilt in 1806. The present church was built in 1940 by Msgr D. J. D’Souza. Milagres has been a parent to many of the neighbouring parishes.\n\nOur Bishop, Most Rev. Gerald Isaac Lobo, leads the diocese enthusiastically. With Fr Valerian Mendonca as the Rector and Parish Priest, and Correspondent of the parish educational institutions, and Fr Joy Jolsan Andrade as the Assistant, the parish is spiritually vibrant with 480 Catholic families, Parish Finance and Pastoral Councils, and various Associations. The 15 Wards of the Parish are ably led by the Gurkars assisted by the Representatives, and BECs.\n\nAs the previous website has become non-functional, Mr Ashwin Mario D’Silva of Uppoor-A ward, guided by Fr Joy, has designed this beautiful website. Thanks to all who have contributed to the formation of the new website. We fondly hope that it will provide the information and inspiration sought by the viewers and readers. May Our Lady of Miracles, in whom and through whom God transmitted His love, work miracles of love in you and your families.\n\nPraying God’s blessings on you,"
