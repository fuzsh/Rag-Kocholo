        "text": "Under the guidance of the successive Correspondents, Late V. Rev. Fr Peter Theodore D'Souza,Late V. Rev. Fr Peter S. Noronha and V. Rev. Fr Antony Shera, the school grew into an icon for excellence and competence in the field of education. In the year 2009 the school celebrated its Silver Jubilee with a lot more committed objectives ahead. The school shifted from the Udupi Church Campus to the new spacious campus of about 10 acres at Kannarpady during the academic year 2010-11. This mighty dream was envisioned and actualized by the dynamic leadership of the then Correspondent V. Rev. Fr Mathew Vas. Later V. Rev. Fr Frederick Mascarenhas embellished the campus with the best possible infrastructure with an aesthetic touch. In August 2013 the school secured affiliation from the CBSE Board with Affiliation No: 830490. In the academic year 2016, the school was upgraded into a Senior Secondary School and Grade 11 with the Science and Commerce streams.\n\nV. Rev. Fr Valerian Mendonca, a visionary educationist and a renowned musician, with his rich experience in teaching and administration, took over the reins of the school from 2017 to October 2020 and accomplished several academic and infrastructural developments. Rev. Fr Charles Menezes has taken the charge as Correspondent in October 2020.\n\nAt present, St Mary's English Medium School is a full-fledged CBSE English Medium School having students from LKG to Grade 12 with a sound student-strength of 1550.\n\nThe school is marching ahead under the leadership of the Principal Rev. Fr Johnson L. Sequeira and Vice Principal Ms Rita Quadros, who are ably supported by Staff Coordinators and 69 experienced teachers with special skills in the field of education and 39 non-teaching members of the Staff.\n\nThe philosophy of the school ensures that its students realize the highest academic and personal potential by incorporating the best human values and essential life skills in all stages of schooling.\n\nOne can surely feel the most peaceful, creative, inspiring and intellectually-motivating atmosphere in St Mary's campus, thus transforming the learning into a joyful experience in St Mary's."
