It was renovated during Fr. Sunil Veigas's service into a star-shaped temple and was inaugurated in May 2016. The church has jurisdiction over Tallur, Uppinakudru, Hemmady, Devalkunda, and Hattiangadi villages. The church is located in central part of Tallur of Kundapur Taluk.\n\nHistory\n\nBefore 1929 there were no prayer centers for Christians and so the devotees from and around Tallur throng into Holy Rosary Catholic Church in the town to offer prayers. Later Rev Fr. Peter Remegias D’Souza in 1928 purchased land in Tallur and simultaneously constructed a small hut. There was a plea from the devotees to set up a separate church at Tallur. After this demand was approved in the parish level meeting, the church was established in 1934 and got its first ever priest in the form of Fr Edward Lobo. The Christian community then constructed a new church in 1959.\n\nNew star-shaped church building\n\nThe foundation stone for the proposed new building was laid on 20 October 2012 by Udupi Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo during the tenure of 19th parish priest Fr Sunil Veigas. ‘Shilpi’ architects based in Kerala designed this church building. From outside this building looks like a star. The church has an entrance from three sides through similar doors. The three-side doors to the building provide the experience of entering a star.\n\nInauguration\n\nThe church was inaugurated by Most Rev Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi Diocese on 12 May 2016. He also offered the first Eucharistic service in the new church in the presence of Fr Anil D’Souza, Dean of Kundapur Deanery; Fr Valerian Mendonca, Chancellor of Udupi Diocese and parish priest of Barkur church; Fr Sunil Veigas, parish Priest , other priests, nuns and a large number of faithful.\n\nAn honoring function was held after the holy mass. Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo presided over the function. Vinay Kumar Sorake, Minister for Urban Development and District minister in-charge; Fr Anil D’Souza, Dean of Kundapur Deanery and others attended as chief guests for the function. The stage programme was followed by a fellowship meal.\n\nThis church building including presbytery has been built at a cost of over Rs 3.5 crore and has enough space to accommodate 600 devotees.\n\nParish Priests who have served in the parish :\n\nFr Edward Lobo (1934 - first parish priest)\n\nFr Valerian Mendonca (1986 - 1987 : Eccl. Administrator)\n\nFr Francis Cornelio (1987 - 1994)\n\nFr Benjamin D’Souza (2001 - 2009)\n\nFr Sunil Joseph Veigas (2009 - 2016)\n\nFr John Mendonca (2016 - 2022 )\n\nFr Edwin Dsouza (from 2022 onwards)\n\n(Complete list will be updated soon)\n\nCompiled by Catholic Time Staff\n\nLast updated in Dec 2022.\n\nRelated links :"
