        "text": "A statue of Christ, the Redeemer, 12 ft high, 15 ft wide, weighing 400 kg was installed atop a 105 ft high dome of St. Francis Xavier Church under construction at Udyavara near Udupi on Friday.\n\nAccording to a press release issued by the Udupi Catholic Diocese here on Saturday, the structural work of the new church began on May 24, 2014.\n\nUnique layout\n\nThe church was being built in a unique layout with a dome on top.\n\nThe height of the dome is 42 feet high with a diameter of 36 feet, unique to the church in Udyavara.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe statue was built at Simon & Co. in Mangaluru. It has been built with all season fibre material. First, it was built with the clay and iron rods.\n\nFibre material\n\nThen the fibre material was added and the required shape was moulded to provide it a longer life span.\n\nRev. Dr. Fr. Roque D’Souza, parish priest, in coordination with Lawrence D’Sa, Vice President of Parish Pastoral Council, Secretary Michael D’Souza and Convener Melvin Noronha have put in their efforts for the successful completion of the project along with the members of Building Core Committee and the parishioners and workers.\n\nThe Church will be inaugurated on April 28."
