        "text": "Tallur, Udupi, June 25, 2024 (CCBI): \"Those who fail to plan, plan to fail,\" declared Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo of Udupi, addressing twenty young lay missionaries at St. Francis Assisi Church in Tallur on June 25, 2024. The Bishop's address, part of a missionary training programme organized by Communio in collaboration with the CCBI Youth Commission, aimed to inspire and guide future church leaders.\n\nBishop Lobo, the first to lead the Udupi Diocese since its 2012 establishment, emphasized the critical importance of strategic planning in navigating complex global issues. \"Planning isn't merely about creating to-do lists; it's about foresight and strategic thinking. Without it, we're navigating life blindfolded,\" he asserted.\n\nIn his inspiring session, the Bishop shared his journey to becoming Udupi's inaugural Bishop and stressed the vital role of the laity in the Church. He advocated for increased lay participation and leadership, stating that the involvement of priests and nuns should complement, not overshadow, lay contributions.\n\nThe second batch of this national missionary training programme, drawing young leaders from across India, is set to conclude on June 27, 2024. Bishop Lobo's address underscored the programme's focus on empowering youth for effective mission work in an ever-changing world.\n\nBy Dr. Roma Sah"
