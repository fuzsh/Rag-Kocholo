        "text": "A scarcity of burial space in cemeteries and churches in a southern Indian diocese is influencing Christians to opt for cremation instead of burial.\n\nSo far, five cremations instead of burial have been decided on in the Mangaluru Diocese, Karnataka State, and the number is increasing, The Times of India reported on November 2.\n\nCremation has been allowed by the Holy See since 1963, which Pope Francis stressed in the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued last year.\n\nAccording to the new guidelines, burial is still preferred, but cremation is an option. However, cremation comes with conditions, including the ashes being kept intact and placed in a vessel in an appropriate place, such as a cemetery or a church.\n\nFr William Menezes, a spokesman for Mangaluru Diocese, said the majority of Christians still opted for burial, but cremation was being chosen due to a lack of space in cemeteries.\n\nBurials in church tombs are also dwindling. In the past, prominent, rich and powerful people, as well as priests and nuns were buried in the church instead of the cemetery, the Times reported. Such tombs can be seen even today in older churches in Dakshina Kannad, Karnataka.\n\nUdupi Diocese, which was formed a few years ago, has already said no to tombs.\n\nâ€œThis was one of the biggest challenges I faced after I took over the diocese,\" said Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo, of Udupi Diocese.\n\n\"With continued efforts and awareness, 80 percent of people in all churches have agreed voluntarily for a normal burial. This will help others and solve the land issue.\"\n\nHe said people have been donating money required to construct permanent tombs towards charity or educational causes. Of late, Catholics in Udupi are going in for cadaver donation to medical colleges."
