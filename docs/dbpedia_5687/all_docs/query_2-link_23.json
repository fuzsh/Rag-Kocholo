        "text": "The St. Mary’s Konkan Community, Dubai, in association with the Catholic Sabha, Udupi Pradesh, will organise a musical event, Grand Konkan Showers 2017 – the Wilfy Nite, to raise funds for four diocesan projects on the St. Francis Xavier English Medium School Grounds at Udyavar near here on Sunday.\n\nAddressing presspersons here recently, Valerian Mendonca, convener, said that the community was a premier philanthropic association in the United Arab Emirates. So far, it had contributed ₹1.75 crore towards community welfare projects in the last 16 years.\n\nIts contribution had helped in the development of Konkani language, culture, education, social service, and others. The community had not only supported the needy but also assisted professional students in pursuing their studies.\n\nThe Udupi Catholic Diocese was established on July 16, 2012, and wanted to set up basic infrastructure to implement its vision spelt out in the pastoral plan titled “Mission 2025”. The diocese required a pastoral centre, a minor seminary, a home for retired priests and the Bishop’s house. The amount collected through donations, sponsorships and offerings would go directly towards the implementation of these four projects.\n\nAt the Konkan Showers – Wilfy Nite, the choicest songs of the late Wilfy Rebimbus will be sung by his wife Meena Rebimbus, their daughter Veena, son Vishwas, and grandson Roger, along with other singers — Prem, Ivan, Babitha D’Sa, Claude, Babitha Pinto, Munita, Ashwin, Nihal and Fr. Denis D’Sa.\n\nOther programmes\n\nThe music troupe of Pappan and Joswin will support the singing with its orchestra of 14 instrumentalists. Dance performances will be presented by the Ocean Kids. Comedian Dolla and group will present skits. Nearly 5,000 persons are expected to participate in the event, Fr. Mendonca said.\n\nJoe Fernandes, president of the community, Valerian Fernandes, president of Catholic Sabha, and others were present."
