        "text": "About Our Cathedral\n\nOur Lady of Miracles Cathedral, formerly known as the Our Lady of Miracles Church, is a Roman Catholic Cathedral situated at Kallianpur in the Udupi district of Karnataka, India.\n\nThe Milagres Church was established in 1680 as a result of a treaty between Raja Shivappa Nayaka (the Ikkeris) of Bednore and the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay-Bassein. The structure was rebuilt in its present form in 1881 AD, after the persecution of Mangalorean Christians at Seringapatam ended. The Milagres parish was elevated to the status of a cathedral church in 2012, giving a desirable service to the people of Kallianpur.\n\nWelcome to Our Lady of Miracles Cathedral, Kallianpur! Established on 20.01.1678, Milagres Church became the Cathedral of the Bishop of Udupi Diocese on 15 October 2012. The original church was built in 1700. Tipu Sultan destroyed this church in 1784. It was rebuilt in 1806. The present church was built in 1940 by Msgr D. J. Dâ€™Souza. Milagres has been a parent to many of the neighbouring parishes."
