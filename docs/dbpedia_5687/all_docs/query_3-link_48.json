        "text": "History\n\nWell this noble thought of education had a deep-rooted meaning and not a long time ago in 1983, the simple peaceful hamlet of Shirva, woke up to the call for imparting education to the children of the locality through the medium of English. The older folks yearned to see and hear their young ones learn the language, which they had missed and hence found it an obstacle, which many faced in their career when they went to the cities looking for greener pastures. They didn’t lose any opportunity of moulding their dreams into a reality. Their dreams, contribution and determination enabled the then Founder Correspondent, Late Rev. Fr. Aloysious Rosario, who also had secretly cherished a vision of establishing an English Medium School in Shirva. Fr. Rosario in his spiritual career in the vineyard of the Lord had founded many Schools, but since Don Bosco being founded in his old age, he always referred to as his “last babe”. He had to undergo many pains and troubles to see the existence of the School, but he had a mission and at no cost he had to accomplish it. Further sections of the school was founded in the year 1992 by the then Parish Priest Very. Rev. Fr. Sylvester D’souza. The school runs under the patronage of Our Lady of Health Church, Shirva. It is a religious minority institution managed by the Catholic Education Society of Udupi Diocese.\n\nNow with the recent development as a part of update and upgrade the far visionary present Correspondent Very. Rev. Fr. Stany Tauro along with his management team dreamt the dream of CBSE School which is in its reality of threshold. The motto of the School is “Growing in truth and Purity”. The aim of the institution is to impart sound moral, intellectual, physical education to the students. Curricular, co-curricular activities are provided to the students to grow their personalities. It is co-education institution where both boys and girls grow up together in a healthy atmosphere of equality and mutual respect.\n\nThis Institute, which had started as a bud among the trials and thorns, today it has bloomed into full-fledged colourful rose spreading its beauty and fragrance in and around Shirva and also at the District Level. Our only desire is that may this institute soar high up and reach the sky. May our Lord, Mother Mary and Patron Don Bosco are with us to guide, and protect our steps at all times. Education never ends, it will never end."
