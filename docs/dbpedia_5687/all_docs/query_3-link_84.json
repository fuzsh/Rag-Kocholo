        "text": "(Udupi, India) The 14th May 2019 marked a special day in the V Province of Majella. Two new Redemptorists Priests were ordained by Rt. Rev. Gerald Issac Lobo, The Bishop of Udupi in Karnataka at St. Theresaâ€™s Church Mukamar in the Diocese of Udupi. Rev. Noel Mascarenhas C.Ss.R. and Rev. Juvance Serrao, C.Ss.R.\n\nNoel is from the the Mukamar parish and Juvance from a neighbouring parish. Both of them are fluent in a few Indian Languages and are versatile preachers with a strong connection to the simple and poor among whom they have been working in different areas of the V. Province.\n\nThe Bishop called both of these young Redemptorist priests to be Men of God, Men of Prayer, Men close to the people especially the poor, Men who are prophetic in their proclamation of the Word not just by preaching but by practicing what they preach in the life witness.\n\nThe V. Provincial called on the young Redemptorist priests to manifest the Redeemer whose witnesses they are through their lives of simplicity, putting aside glamour and embracing a true spirit of simple service to the wounded characteristic of a true Redemptorist Priest.\n\nMore than half of the Vice Province was present for this day of rejoicing with all the Redemptorist Students as well as a few Redemptorists from the Province of Bangalore and Liguori.\n\nIvel Mendanha, C.Ss.R."
