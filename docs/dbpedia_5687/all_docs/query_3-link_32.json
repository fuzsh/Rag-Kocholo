        "text": "Preface:\n\nBelman parish was established in 1894. At present, the catholic population is around 2,600 and catholic families account for around 540. The parish is divided into 15 wards. 'San Zuzechi Betkati' is the parish newsletter. Late Bishop Baptist Mudartha, retired Bishop of Allahabad hails from this parish. Till 2009, 13 parish priests have worked hard for the development of the parish and social & spiritual growth of the parishioners as well.\n\nLocation :\n\nThis church is situated at a distance of 48 kms north of Mangalore, on Padubidri-Kudremukh State Highway and is surrounded by Mukamar, Parapady, Pernal, Mundkur, Kelmbet, Mudarangady and Palimar parishes.\n\nThe Background:\n\nThe word Belmannu came from 'bili mannu' in Kannada meaning white soil. Belman was once a part of Shirva parish. Bishop Nicholas M. Pagani, S.J. erected Belman parish by a decree dated September 10, 1894.\n\nBelman is a village in coastal Karnataka in Udupi District, between Padubidri and Karkala. It has its natural scenic beauty with paddy fields, coconut gardens, hills and valleys. Agriculture is the main occupation of its people. Since many years, Belmanites have been moving out of the village to many parts of India, specially to Mumbai and now to gulf countries.\n\nChristianity set its foot in our District in the 16th century and grew to considerable strength in the 17th and 18th centuries, until they were taken into captivity by Tippu Sultan. Those who survived this crisis, began to settle down again and established themselves as parishes.\n\nOne such parish was Shirva. Following the situation of those days, there were two churches at Shirva - one belonging to Padroado regime having its Bishop in Goa, and the other belonging to Propaganda congregation of Rome. The former was called N.S. De Saude and the latter, St. Francis Xaviers'. The families residing in the area in and around Belman mostly belonged to the latter church.\n\nFormation of Belman Parish:\n\nConsidering the welfare and spiritual needs of Christians in this area, Episcopal sanction was granted for the erection of chapel in Belman by a decree dated 29th November 1886 of the Bishop of Mangalore, Rt. Rev. N.M. Pagani, S.J.\n\nOnce the decree was issued, all attention was focused on the construction of St. Joseph's chapel. After considering many other locations, a place belonging to a Brahmin family, \"Madkamane\", was selected and the construction of the chapel began in 1887. This place is adjacent to the present church. Construction work was financed by the Mathias family. After seven years, the work of the chapel was completed.\n\nPermission to bless the chapel was granted by the same Bishop, Rt.Rev. N.M. Pagani, S.J. by a decree dated 10th September 1894. The same decree also effected the erection of Belman into a separate parish, marked boundaries of it, and appointed Rev.Fr. N. Carneiro, the then parish priest of St. Francis Xaviers' Church, Shirva, to be the parish priest of Belman parish/church, also. This chapel was blessed by Rev.Fr. N. Carneiro on 10th September 1894. He was ministering to the needs of Belman parishioners from Shirva parish for some years.\n\nThe chapel was built of mud walls and had a hay thatched roof. There was no house for the priest nor a belfry.\n\nSunday mass was at 7:00 a.m. The church dues and grave fees were to be paid to the chapel treasury. The parish priest was paid Rs.2/- as traveling expenses. The chapel was administered from Shirva.\n\nSeeing the convenience and utility of having the church close by, some families of N.S. De Saude, Shirva and also N.S. Remedies, Kirem asked to be transferred to the new parish of Belman. Accordingly, a good number of families were added to the Belman parish at various times by Episcopal decree, and on 12th December 1900, the territorial boundary between Kirem and Belman was settled.\n\nThe Christian community consisted of people from all walks of life. A prominent family at that time, was the Mathias family. They had their houses in Kudpal, Kopla, Arkal, Indar and Dosahitlu. The other important families were the D'Mellos at Bibinal, Mudartha's at Balegundi, Aranha's at Bola and Cardoza's in and around Indar. The Mathias family traces back its origin before the captivity in 1784. They were taken captives by Tippu's soldiers. After their release in1789, they returned to Belman and settled around Naniltar. In the course of time, the Mathias family became the largest and richest in Belman and was also instrumental in starting the Belman parish. For better understanding, the history of the parish is divided into some phases.\n\nFirst Phase - The beginning:\n\nThe blessing the chapel signaled the beginning of a new era in Belman.\n\n1. Rev.Fr. Nicholas Carneiro (1894 - 1903)\n\nHe was the first parish priest of Belman and also the founder of the parish and the one who blessed the chapel at Belman. He administered the parish from Shirva till 1903.\n\nDevelopmental Activities:\n\nHe started an elementary school in 1896 which has developed into St. Joseph's H.P. School. As he has to travel frequently between Shirva and Belman, he had a road constructed between these two places, which has developed into the present Shirva-Belman road.\n\n2. Rev.Fr. Rosario P.B. Lewis (1903 - 1906)\n\nFor three years, Fr. Lewis administered the chapel from Shirva parish.\n\nDevelopmental Activities:\n\nHe held a junta on 15th March 1904, at which, besides the parishioners, the Vicars of Kallianpur, Karkala, N.S. De Saude, Shirva and St. Francis Xaviers', Shirva were present. This junta prayed for a resident parish priest for Belman.\n\nThe prayer of the junta headed by Fr. Lewis was heard and a resident parish priest was appointed in the person of Fr. Emmanuel Vas.\n\nAnother important work undertaken by him was that of construction of a small house for the priests near the chapel.\n\nSecond Phase - Independent Steps:\n\nThe beginning of this phase was marked by the independent status of the parish with its own chapel, own resident parish priest and also a small cemetery besides the chapel.\n\n3. Rev.Fr. Emmanuel Vas (1906 - 1910)\n\nHe was the first resident parish priest of Belman. He had to live in a small thatched house without any facilities.\n\nDevelopmental Activities:\n\nHe began building the present parish house which he could not complete. He started a post office in the parish house, and got constructed the present Belman-Mundkur road.\n\n4. Rev.Fr. Peter R. D'Souza (1910 - 1913)\n\nHe was an active priest who worked very hard in order to stabilize the economic condition of the parishioners.\n\nDevelopmental Activities:\n\nHe got completed the work of the parish house, and added a kitchen to the parish house. He founded a reserve fund with paddy and rice collected from the parishioners. The money thus obtained was given on interest on mortgage of jewels.\n\n5. Rev.Fr. Antony A.E. Colaco (1913 - 1914)\n\nThe schools, which were run by the parish priests, were transferred to the Catholic Board of Education on 30th July 1934 for better educational facilities. He got constructed a bridge between the parish house and the church sacristy. The front steps of the church were built by him. The boundary wall with two gates were also built by him. The interior of the church was plastered and colour windows were provided. The belfry was constructed which was kindly donated by Mr. M. Mendonca and a new bell was installed.\n\nIt was during this era that the Belman parish was assigned an Assistant Parish Priest. Thus, priests were in the beginning, Head Masters of the school and / or looking after the day functioning of the school.\n\nAssistant Parish Priests:\n\n1. Fr. Jerome D'Souza, Head Master (10-08-1942 - 10-04-1943)\n\n2. Fr. Ambrose C. Aranha (23-03-1944 - 08-09-1944)\n\n3. Fr. Raymond D'Cunha, Head Master (09-09-1944 - 05-05-1949)\n\n4. Fr.

Norbert D'Souza (16-05-1954 - 20-04-1957)\n\nFourth Phase - Further Development:\n\nThis is the phase in 2which the Belman parish flourished. In this era, Belmanites became Bishop, priests, doctors, religious, engineers, nurses, etc. and earned a name for the church and the parish as well.\n\nAnother development of the phase is the erection of \"St. Antony's Chapel\" at Pakala, Manjarapalke with monthly novena and celebration of yearly feast on June 13.\n\nThe most important development of this era is the creation of a new parish, Kelmbet (Bola) from Belman parish. A new chapel was erected there, by a decree dated 11th April 1964. The then Asst. Parish Priest of Belman, Fr. Gregory D'Souza was appointed as the first parish priest of Kelmbet - St. John Bosco's parish.\n\nOn 21st November 1982, Mukamar was separated from the Belman parish and was created as a separate parish by a decree dated on 21st November 1982. Fr. Victor Pinto was the first parish priest.\n\n8. Rev.Fr. Nicholas J. Pereira (1957 - 1973)\n\nThe parish council was revitalized.
