        "text": "Our Lady of Fatima Church is about 3 Miles away from Shirva-Manchakal and it is placed in the Hills of Pernal – Sooda Cross Road surrounded by beautiful scenery’s such as forest, paddy fields, coconut trees, areca-nut trees, Banana Plants and Sooda River. It is a parish of around 302 Catholic Families with almost 1200 Parishioners. It is a part of Shirva Varado and serving under the Diocese of Udupi.\n\nVery Rev.Fr. H. Gonsalves Parish Priest of Shirva conceived the idea of opening an elementary school and church at Pernal, about three miles away from Shriva and eventually establishing an official parish church in that same locality. On 20th June 1949 Rt. Rev. Dr. V. R. Fernandes Bishop of Mangalore purchased a plot of land about 2.20 acres in extent, from Venkataraja Udpa, for the purchase of constructing a church. On the 27th June 1950, Messer’s Salvador Mendonca and six others generously donated a plot measuring about 2.65 acres quite adjacent to the one purchased previously. Very Rev. Fr. H. Gonsalves with his, indomitable courage left no stone unturned till the sanction for the opening of an elementary was obtained on 1st September 1951 and immediately the school was opened with 60 children on the rolls distributed in standard 1 to 4 and two members of the teaching staff. The school at its very inception was deeply indebted to Mr. Salvador Babi Mendonca of Pernal.\n\nOn 8th September 1951, the feast of Nativity of our Lady the foundation stone for the new church was laid by very Rev. Fr. H. Gonsalves. With the kind and generous help of Parishioners, friends and well-wishers abroad, the new church was roofed by the end of May 1952. The school so far conducted in the pandal was now shifted to the new building on 1stJune 1952, on which memorable day it become a full pledged elementary school with the introduction of Standard 5th. 15th September 1952 was marked by the laying of the foundation stone for the presbytery which was roofed by the end of May 1953.\n\nWhile granting permanent recognition for the elementary School with effect from 1stJune 1953, the Educational authorities granted permission to raise the school to the status of higher elementary school and accordingly standard 6th was opened on 4th June 1953 with 33 pupils.\n\nA small plot measuring 0.53 acres quite adjustment to ours was purchased from Mr. Baptist Mendonca of Pangala on 22nd November 1954. With the down of the Marian year permission was granted to celebrate Holy mass on Sundays from 1st June 1954. The new parish of our lady of Fatima was officially erected on 20th March 1955 when very Rev.Fr. H. Gonsalves installed Rev.Fr. G.B. D’Souza as the first parish priest of this newly erected Filial Parish church of Fatima.\n\nOn 21st October 1955 the foundation stone was laid for the new school building along the road side. By the end of May 1956 the magnificent building was completed. On 15th September 1956 the foundation stone laid for an additional block to the school and it was completed by the end of May 1957 thus enabling the management to house all the eight standards of the higher elementary school in a separate and spacious school building. On 15th September 1958 the foundation stone was laid for an additional of three rooms for the school. On 24-07-1957 a plot measuring 0.39 acres and again on 17-1-1958 another plot 1.37 acres quite adjacent to ours was given to us on Kumuki rights by the government. The D.C. of South Kanara in his proceedings handed over 2.19 acres land for playground and once again Asst. Commissioner of Kundapur allotted 2.79 land as playground for the school.\n\nConstructing the Alter in white and colored mosaic and flooring the sanctuary with mosaic etc. and other part of the work was completed by Simon & Company Mangalore. The Church was blessed on 10-11-1959 and the first Parish Feast was celebrated on the following day by Rt. Rev. Dr. R.D’Mello Bishop of Mangalore.\n\nNow the school building was sufficient to accommodate all the classes. In the 1950 when Education Department was unwilling to give permission to open the Elementary school on the Pernal Hill where the school now stands as it was too near to the Sooda Board school, but willing to open two more furlongs away, a plot donating S.No.104/1 of the Pilar Village was brought in the name of very Rev. Fr. H. Gonsalves vicar of Shirva from Sri Lawrence Andrade of Sooda who surrendered it willingly in favour of the church to be started for a nominal price of Rs.25/=.\n\nThe Asst. Commissioner of Kundapur in his N.D is 5173/60 dated 7-6-1963 has transferred to pernal burial ground S.No. 110/2C measuring One Acre in extent in response to as application made by the secretary Parish Union of Mangalore Diocese for granting the land for the burial ground for Our Lady of Fatima Church.\n\nFoundation stone for a hospital on S.No.104/1 of Pilar Village by the roadside was laid by the Vicar on 31-10-1961. It has cost as about Rs.55000/= including the will Diocese has donated Rs.5627/= at the Franciscan missionary of Mary sisters contribute Rs.5780/= for constructing etc. It was blessed by the Rev. W, Lewis on 11-2-1965 and named as “Pilar Hospital”. Dispensary was opened by the sisters immediately in one of the rooms. The sisters occupied the rest of the building as their temporary residence.

A plot measuring 1.51 acres denoting S.No.112 of Pilar Village was brought from Vasudeva Nayak for Rs.650 and was given to Ignatius Mendonca son of Balthazar Mendonca for a yearly rent of Rs.50 with effect from 1-9-1966.
