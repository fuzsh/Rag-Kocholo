        "text": "Modern Education in Dakshina Kannada/Udupi districts as in many other parts of the world owes its beginning to Christian Missionaries. The history of the past twenty centuries shows that monasteries/Churches and convents have been the centres of education by service of humanity, chiefly through the forming of young minds and the promotion of justice and development and promotion of Historic and scientific research in a rural area. In the 1950s, the immediate Post-independence era of India, education was a luxury and reserved only for the elite. The situation was similar to coastal Karnataka. Fewer schools were run by the government, which too catered to a higher section of the people. At this critical time juncture quite a few visionaries, philanthropists, missionaries sacrificed their lives with the prime motive of enlightening and forming the young brains through quality education so that education is affordable by every marginalized, weak and needy student who dreamt but couldn’t step into school.\n\nTo add to this, Bishop V.R. Fernandes of Mangalore Diocese founded the Catholic Board of Education (CBE) in the year 1932. The schools of Church Management of Mangalore and Udupi are of Mangalore Diocese came under the management of the Catholic Board of Education. The Board was registered in 1956, under the Societies Registration Act. Marching ahead in the same direction, in June 1967 at Kallianpur Milagres College was established to provide collegiate education to deserving and needy students of the vicinity. Today, Milagres College stands tall in the area for imparting quality education to all. To add to its feather, the College has completed 54 years and marching ahead with innovations but keeping alive the vision of founders. Bifurcating from the Mangalore Diocese, a New Udupi Diocese was established on 16th July 2012. By the virtue of new diocese a Catholic Educational Society, Udupi (CESU) came into effect and Milagres College, Kallianpura became part of it.\n\nMilagres College, Kallianpura was started mainly for the Catholic community but has opened its doors to all without discrimination of caste or creed, at the same time maintained their Christian identity, minority character, their aims and objectives."
