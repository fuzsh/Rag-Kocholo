        "text": "Udupi, 02 Feb 2023: The dream of Women Empowerment that had been in progress since the last ten years since the inception of the Diocese of Udupi was materialized when the All-women Bank “Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha(R)” was inaugurated on Thursday, 2 February 2023 at a function organized at 3.30 pm in the Mother of Sorrows Church Hall, Udupi. The Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha was formally inaugurated by Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo by lighting the lamp along with other dignitaries on the dais including Rev. Fr. Charles Menezes-Parish Priest of the Mother of Sorrows Church and Dean of Udupi Deanery, Mr. Vijay B.S.-District Coordinator of Karnataka State Federation of Cooperatives, Mrs. Pramila D’Sa-President of Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha, Mrs. Leena Roche- Founder President of Catholic Stree Sanghattan, Udupi Diocese, Mrs. Jannet Barboza- Founder President of Sugamya Mahila Zilla Okkuta, Udupi District, Mrs. Anita Dias-President President of Sugamya Mahila Zilla Okkuta, Mrs. Cynthia D’Silva-Secretarty and Mrs. Veera Wilma D’Souza-Treasurer. Besides the members of the Board of Directors of Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha were present on the dais.\n\nIn his message following the formal inauguration of the Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha, Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo said that the dream of the last ten years since the establishment of the Diocese of Udupi became a reality with the formal inauguration of the bank that is by the women, of the women and for the women. With this one of the major aims in the direction of the empowerment of women in the district of Udupi has been realized. He further said that the empowerment of women in the social, economic, political and cultural fields were the initial goals of the women’s organizations beginning from the ward level self-help groups rising to the parish level, deanery level and eventually diocesan or district level organizations. Women were encouraged to participate in ward and grama sabhas and also to participate in the electoral process and become members of the grama panchayats. One of the chief objectives of the women empowerment was the establishment of a bank entirely managed by women for the economic empowerment of women. Though the work had started in right earnest and the bank should have started by 2020, due to Covid 19 pandemic the process slowed down. However, it fructified on this day. Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo greatly appreciated the hard work that was put in by the Director of Sampada, Rev. Fr. Reginald Pinto who gathered all the information required for starting a cooperative bank. He even met the government officials and made a deep study of the entire process and guided the women in all matters related to the cooperative banking system. Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo also appreciated the contribution of Mrs. Leena Roche and Mrs. Jannet Barboza in promoting the women’s organizations.\n\nRev. Fr. Charles Menezes in his address complimented the women for starting the cooperative bank and said that it is easy to start an organization but difficult to sustain unless supported whole heartedly by all members. He hoped that all the women members of the Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha would work hard for the success of the bank and avail the benefits that the bank would provide to them and their families.\n\nThe guest of honour Mr. Vijay B.S. in his speech quoting Mahatma Gandhi said that the village that has empowered women would be progressive. He complemented the women for starting their own Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha. He said that out of three such women’s sahakari banks two have been inactive especially working in the rural areas. He hoped that Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha would achieve success due to the overwhelming participation of women. He advised the Board of Directors of Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha to open as many branches as possible through the Udupi District and become example to others.\n\nMrs. Leena Roche and Mrs. Jannet Barboza jointly inaugurated the logo of the Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha.\n\nMrs. Leena Roche started her address by singing ‘vovyo’ appropriate for the occasion as the audience responded. Later, Mrs. Leena Roche narrated the origin of the Catholic Stree Sanghattan in the Udupi Diocese and its progress under the patronage of Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo. She said that the first Catholic Stree Sanghattan in Udupi was established on 11 May 2012. With the establishment of the new Diocese of Udupi on 15 October 2012, the Catholic Stree Sanghattan was strengthened by the new Bishop of Udupi Most Rev. Dr. Gerald Isaac Lobo.\n\nMrs. Jannet Barboza explained the meaning of the logo of the Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha and greatly appreciated its significance. She narrated the efforts takne by her and other women leaders in building the women’s organization from the grass root level right from the ward level self-help groups up to the Zilla Okkuta of which she became the founder president. She recalled how Rev. Fr. Reginald Pinto pursued the dream of organizing the women and stood by them, guided them and encouraged them to get organized constantly keeping in touch with them and monitoring their progress.\n\nMrs. Pramila D’Sa-Presdient of the Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha in her presidential address made an appeal to the members of the Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha to be active and avail the benefits that they will be getting from the cooperative bank. She expressed gratitude to Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo for encouraging the women to start their own bank, Rev. Fr. Reginald Pinto for all his background work for starting the Sugamya Mahila Souharda Sahakari Sangha, Mr. Stanley Fernandes-Coordinator in Sampada for his assistance and all the women members for their trust and support.\n\nWomen of Shirva Deanery presented the prayer song. Mrs. Anita Dais welcomed the guests. Mrs. Cynthia D’Silva propsed the vote of thanks and Mrs. Rita Misquith compered the programme."
