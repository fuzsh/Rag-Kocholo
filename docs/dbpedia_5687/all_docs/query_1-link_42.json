        "text": "Christians observed Good Friday marking the crucifixion of Jesus Christ with fasting and day-long prayer services in churches in Udupi district on Friday.\n\nDevotees congregated in large numbers in churches of various denominations across the district. Among the key religious ceremonies listed for the day in churches is the “Way of the Cross”.\n\nThe 14 stations on Christ’s Journey to Mount Calvary from Roman governor Pilate’s palace are re-enacted with the worshippers moving to each station singing hymns as the story of the betrayal, arrest, trial and crucifixion of the Christ is narrated by the priest.\n\nGood Friday in the district started with the “Way of the Cross” in all the churches. Some of the churches organised solemn processions, where they carried a life-size statue of Jesus in prayerful worship.\n\nMost Rev. Dr. Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi Catholic Diocese, took part in the religious ceremony organised at the Milagres Cathedral in Kallianpur near here.\n\nThe solemn church liturgy on Good Friday included the dramatised reading of the “Passion of the Cross” from the Gospel of St. John, followed by the veneration of the Cross and finally, the distribution of communion.\n\nWith the completion of Good Friday, Christians prepare to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday."
