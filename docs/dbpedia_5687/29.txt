THE GENESIS

By virtue of an official proclamation dated 01 September, 1886, His Holiness Pope Leo XIII established the Catholic Hierarchy in India. In pursuance of this proclamation, several dioceses came to be created in India from time to time. The Diocese of Udupi (Latin Rite) was erected on 16.07.2012 by virtue of the Apostolic Constitution of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI, ‘Cunctae Catholicae Ecclasiae’. On the same day the Most Rev. Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo, thus far Bishop of Shimoga, was appointed as the Bishop of Udupi by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI. The official inauguration of the Diocese of Udupi and Installation of Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo as its first Bishop took place on 15 October, 2012 at the Milagres Cathedral Grounds at Kallianpur. The Udupi District had been a part of the Diocese of Mangalore since 1887. The Civil District of Udupi, which hitherto belonged to the Diocese of Mangalore, was separated to form the new Diocese of Udupi comprising of the Taluks of Karkal, Kundapur and Udupi. The Udupi Diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Bangalore. The Church dedicated to Our Lady of Miracles (Milagres) at Kallianpur is the Cathedral of the Bishop of Udupi.
