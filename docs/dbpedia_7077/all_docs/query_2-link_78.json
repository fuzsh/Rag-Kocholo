        "text": "PARK ADVISORY\n\nThe Hunting Island State Park campground will officially reopen on Thursday, August 15, 2024, at 2 PM. Guests wanting to make new reservations for this weekend are encouraged to book online or by calling 1.866.345.7275 Monday through Friday 9 am to 5 pm EST/EDT.\n\nThe Day-use area and Russ Point Landing are open for public use.\n\nThe campground store is open Sunday - Thursday 9:00 am-4:30 pm, and Friday and Saturday 9:00 am - 6:00 pm.\n\nWe now have a track chair available for visitors with mobility impairments, thanks to the Ford Bronco Wild Fund. Visitors are encouraged to call the park to reserve the track chair at least 48 hours in advance to ensure availability. There is no additional charge to use the track chair, but a Park Passport or park admission is required for entry for all visitors. Read more about this new track chair, here.\n\nDue to safety concerns, the Hunting Island lighthouse is currently closed to tours, until repairs can be made. The lighthouse can still be viewed from the grounds and docents will be on hand to interpret and give more information about the lighthouse. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nJoin us on a tour of St. Phillips Island! Click here for details!\n\n**Our Ultimate Outsider stamps are located at the Nature Center, Park Store or Lighthouse Gift Shop.\n\nHunting Island is South Carolina’s single most popular state park, attracting more than a million visitors a year, as well as a vast array of land and marine wildlife. Five miles of pristine South Carolina beaches, thousands of acres of marsh and maritime forest, a saltwater lagoon and ocean inlet are all part of the park’s natural allure.\n\nHunting Island is home to the historic Hunting Island lighthouse, built in 1859 and rebuilt in 1875 after it was destroyed during the Civil War. A unique feature of the lighthouse is that it was constructed of interchangeable cast-iron sections so it could be dismantled should it ever need to be moved. Severe beach erosion made it necessary to relocate the lighthouse 1.3 miles inland in 1889.\n\nHunting Island State Park camping is available at 100 campsites with water and electrical hookups, shower and restroom facilities, beach walkways and a playground. Hunting Island State Park camping reservations must be made for a minimum of two nights.\n\nFind more great state parks on the beaches of South Carolina!"
