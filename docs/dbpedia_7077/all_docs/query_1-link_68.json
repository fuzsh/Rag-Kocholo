        "text": "The “frightseeing” begins the moment you climb onto our ghoulish trolley where our gravediggers are waiting to take you on the 90-minute ride of your life. Be prepared to be scared as the Ghosts & Gravestones trolley winds its way through Boston’s most sordid past—through 400-year-old burial grounds where you’ll hear tales of grave-robbing, tortures, punishments, executions and even some folks being buried alive!\n\nWhen it was purchased and restored in the 1980’s, every theater major at the university was required to do some sort of work there. Many of those students reported ghostly experiences, including seeing the ghost of a former Boston Mayor still sitting in the seat he died in during a performance. Others, including theater patrons, told accounts of seeing the spirits of a couple and their young daughter floating about in the upper balcony.\n\nOne of the most chilling tales about Boston’s Most Haunted Hotel is the fact that the elevator has been known to stop at the 3rd floor without anyone pushing the button. When the doors open, no one is there. The Omni Parker House Hotel exudes poltergeist-like personality. It’s here that the owner of the hotel, Harvey Parker, has been seen roaming the halls of the 10th floor. Reports from guests throughout the years describe Mr. Parker perfectly, and include sightings of him inside rooms, in the hallways and even sounds of someone rocking back and forth in a rocking chair—especially eerie since there are no rocking chairs in the hotel. The Hotel’s history dates back to the middle 1800’s and since then many who have stayed there have told of lights flickering on and off, hearing voices when no one else was in the room and apparitions of lost souls, dressed in attire that dates back to the 19th century.\n\nAnd is the final resting place of Samuel Adams, John Hancock and Robert Treat Paine, three of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Paul Revere is also here—and his spirit is said to be lingering as well, sometimes upon the horse that he made his famous midnight ride on. Spooky and somber, the graveyard is a sight to see with its winding narrow pathways, picturesque trees and imposing iron gates that mark the entrance. And for those hoping for a paranormal encounter, there have been many reported."
