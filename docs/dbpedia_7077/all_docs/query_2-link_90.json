        "text": "THE RACE\n\nLooking for a scary good time? Join us on Governors Island for what is arguably one of our spookiest and most fun races of the year! Once you've won your race and entered our costume contest, explore all the fall festivities the island has to offer.\n\nEntry to the NYCRUNS Haunted Island 10K includes a ferry ride, your race-entry, a tech shirt, post-race eats and Halloween vibes.\n\nCan't make it? Join us the day after for the NYCRUNS Haunted Island 5K on Sunday, October 27.\n\nTHE COURSE\n\nEnjoy a whirlwind tour of Governors Island with amazing views! The 10K is two loops of the island. All NYCRUNS courses are USATF certified.\n\n10K Course Map | Certification\n\nHANDCYCLE/WHEELCHAIR ATHLETES\n\nDue to the high number of turns in this course, we do not advise handcycle or wheelchair athlete participants register for this event. Weâ€™d suggest registering for the NYCRUNS Brooklyn Half Marathon or any of our 5K races in Prospect Park or Central Park.\n\nAMENITIES\n\nBag Check (opens at 8:00 AM) - If you plan on checking your gear, you must use one single clear bag. If your bag isn't clear, NYCRUNS will provide you with a clear bag (18\" x 24\") when you check your gear. You may not put another full bag/backpack/briefcase filled with gear inside the clear bag that NYCRUNS provides. All items must fit inside one clear bag. NYCRUNS reserves the right to search the contents in your bag at any time.\n\nRestrooms (open at 8:00AM) - Portable restrooms will be available throughout the event.\n\nHydration - Water and electrolyte fluids will be available on the course and at the finish.\n\nPost Race Refreshments - Further hydration, bagels (with a schmear, of course), and fresh fruit will be available after you finish.\n\nSwag (distribution begins at 8:00 AM) - The giveaway for this race will be a tech shirt. Shirts may be picked up on race day only. In order to cut down on waste, we try not to over order and sizes are not guaranteed. If you have your heart set on a size, we recommend picking up your shirt before the race.\n\nPhotos - You will receive an email from MarathonFoto several days after the race with information about your complimentary finish line photo and details on how to purchase photos of your entire run along the course. You can also sign up for the photo package at checkout and get them at the best price.\n\nBIB DISTRIBUTION\n\nYou can pick up your bib in the Festival Area on race day beginning at 8:00 AM. Bibs are only available for pick up on race morning.\n\nIf you are an NYCRUNS Member, your bib will be mailed to you at no additional cost. You can become an NYCRUNS member at checkout and receive this free bib mailing benefit.\n\nIf you are not an NYCRUNS Member, you can still have your bib mailed to you by adding this service at checkout for an additional $20.\n\nBibs can only be mailed to runners who register 30 days or more before the date of the event and can only be sent to a domestic mailing address (we cannot mail to an international address).\n\nIf you are having your bib mailed to you, will not receive your race shirt in the mail with your bib. You will need to pick up your shirt on race day.\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nTake the Governors Island Ferry from Manhattan. There is no charge to ride the ferry (for runners and guests) on race morning.\n\nFerries run on the half hour. Please take either the 7:30 AM or 8:00 AM ferry to ensure a timely arrival at the start. Runners should be on line at least 15 minutes prior to ferry departure time.\n\nThe Governors Island Ferry is located at the Battery Maritime Building at 10 South Street in Manhattan. Mass transit is your best option for arriving at the ferry. Via subway, take the 4/5 to Bowling Green, the R to Whitehall Street, the J to Broad Street, or the 1 to South Ferry. Via bus, take the M15 to South Street/Whitehall Street. There is also a Citi Bike station at South Street/Whitehall Street.\n\nPlease check MTA Trip Planner for up-to-date and detailed mass transit directions and Google Maps for driving directions. Driving is not recommended due to the lack of parking near the ferry.\n\nTaking the Governors Island ferry from Manhattan is your best option for arriving on time. Other ferry services are not recommended.\n\nCOST\n\nSee chart below. NYCRUNS members receive a 10% discount on this race, race withdrawal rights, and other perks.
