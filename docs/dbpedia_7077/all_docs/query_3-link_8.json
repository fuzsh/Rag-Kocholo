        "text": "Burg Eltz dates back to 1157, and the list of myths surrounding the castle is nearly as long. Of the few rooms in the castle open to tourists, and supposedly one of the most haunted, is the bedroom of the Countess Agnes. Her bed, breastplate, and battle axe remain in the room, and legend has it that she died defending the castle from an “undesirable” suitor. No wonder she still haunts the German castle, found between the towns of Koblenz and Trier, today.\n\nPsychics and witnesses say three ghosts reside in Dragsholm Castle, found in Hørve, Denmark, fifty miles from Copenhagen. The three supernatural specters are a gray lady, a white lady, and most famously, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, a Scottish nobleman who was the third and final husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. After Dragholm’s initial construction in 1215 as a palace, and its subsequent modification into a fortified castle in the Middle Ages, Dragsholm served as a prison for the nobility and ecclesiastical prisoners during the Reformation (the transition from Catholicism to Lutheranism) from 1536 to 1664. At one point, Lord Bothwell was locked up in one of its cells and chained to a pillar—it still stands today. Now, his spirit is said to ride through the courtyard with a full horse and carriage. For tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of the late lord, Dragsholm Castle welcomes visitors and has both a restaurant and hotel on site.\n\nHimeji Castle dates to 1333 and is regarded as one of the greatest remaining examples of Japanese castle architecture. It also has some rather eerie folklore associated with it. The most popular tale tells the story of Okiku, a mythical character from ancient legends who was falsely accused of losing valuable dishes. She was killed and thrown into the well in the castle. Her ghost now haunts the castle at night, counting dishes in a mournful tone; she reaches nine before shrieking and returning to the well.\n\nIn 1910, a Scottsman and civil engineer named William Kellie-Smith commissioned a gift for his wife to be built in Malaysia, in the town of Batu Gajah: Kellie’s Castle—also aptly known as Kellie’s Folly. ’Twas his folly, for the endeavor seemed fated to fail from the start. Not long after construction on the castle began, in 1918 a strain of the Spanish flu plagued the site’s workmen. Then, in 1926, Kellie-Smith died of pneumonia while abroad on a trip to Lisbon, Portugal; his wife, in her grief, fled Malaysia and Kellie’s Castle was never completed, left for the jungle to reclaim. Today, despite its status as a local tourist attraction, the manor and its secret tunnels and passageways have a ghostly reputation. Some say that Kellie-Smith’s ghost wanders the upper floors, and that his long-dead daughter can be seen in her room with a white blouse on and a head of big, curly hair.\n\nIn the northeastern Danish town of Dronninglund, Voergaard Castle displays works by Raphael, Goya, and El Greco to the public. But the stately building is as renowned for its dark past. The most famous myth tells the story of Ingeborg Skeel, who acquired the castle in 1578 and drowned its architect in the moat so that he could never design another building as beautiful as Voergaard. People today report seeing Skeel's tormented ghost wandering through the castle at night, dressed in white. Even if you don't believe ghost stories, you might still get goosebumps passing by Rosedonten, Voergaard's most infamous dungeon: The room was designed so that an adult man could neither stand up straight nor lie stretched out, and there are no holes for light or air to enter.\n\nBuilt between 1575 and 1636 in east Scotland, Castle Fraser is famous for its elaborate architecture, beautiful farmland, and gardens—and a somewhat horrifying myth. According to legend, a young princess once staying at the castle was brutally murdered in her sleep. Her body was dragged down the stone stairs, leaving a trail of blood behind. As hard as they tried, the occupants could not scrub the blood stains from the stairs, so they decided to cover the staircase in wood paneling, which remains to this day. Some say the ghost of the princess still roams the halls of the castle at night.\n\nIt doesn’t get much more Halloweeny than this: Dracula’s Castle. Bran Castle is loosely linked to the historical character who inspired author Bram Stoker—Vlad III Dracula, otherwise known as Vlad the Impaler—and yes, you inferred correctly that instead of sucking blood he impaled his victims. Some believe Bran Castle was one of the sites in which Vlad III reigned terror on Transylvania. (Most historians would beg for proof, however.) Now a museum, other scary sights within its walls include a golden casket that holds the heart of Romania’s Queen Marie.\n\nLarnach was built between 1871 and 1887 to serve as the residence of William Larnach, a prominent local politician in New Zealand. Most notable is a 3,000-square-foot ballroom, which Larnach had built as a 21st birthday present for his favorite daughter Kate, who later died of typhoid at age 26, and is said to still haunt the ballroom. Don’t chalk those taps on your shoulder and whispers in your ear as all up to imagination, though: The building has been visited by paranormal investigators and featured on Ghost Hunters International.\n\nOne of the oldest and largest of South Africa’s remaining colonial buildings, Cape Town's Castle of Good Hope once sported a windowless dungeon where convicts drowned while chained to its walls—they are said to haunt the place today. Other spooky stuff? A large black dog that leaps at visitors before disappearing, a bell that rings by itself (thought to be rung by a guard who once hung himself with the bell rope), and lights in the Buren bastion, switched on—and off—without any human assistance.\n\nIn North America, where castles are scarce, we typically see haunted houses instead—unless you’re in Geneva, New York, where on the shores of Seneca Lake lies Belhurst Castle, built in 1888. It has changed hands often over the past century, the way that most cursed places and objects do, and many whispers about it have floated through town. Like, how the staff have seen glasses and bottles flying in the bar, and how guests have heard lullabies sung in their rooms late at night—with no singer in sight. Belhurst’s most famous tale, however, is that of the ghost named Isabella. She is said to have been a beautiful opera singer who fled Spain for the United States with her lover, where they built a house with a secret underground tunnel. It collapsed on them when they were trying to flee from the authorities. Since then, she has been sighted flying through the castle windows and walking the shores of Seneca Lake at night. If you dare, you can actually stay at Belhurst Castle. Today, it operates as a hotel, winery, and wedding venue—perfect for a fall getaway to the Finger Lakes from New York City. (As far as appearances go, it admittedly looks more sunny and lovely than it does scary.)\n\nDeep in the state of Rajasthan at the foot of the Aravali mountain range, lies an abandoned 17th-century ruined fort city. One piece of local lore says a sadhu who lived atop the nearest hill permitted the fort to be built under the condition that it not cast a shadow on his own home. Once his mandate was disobeyed, he cursed the city. Considered the most haunted place in India, entry to the popular tourist destination is strictly forbidden after sunset. Nearby villagers whisper of paranormal activity, but skeptics say the after-dark ban’s true intent is to protect people from the dwellers of an adjacent tiger reserve. The gloomy aura and negative vibrations of Bhangarh Fort, however, are agreed on by believers and nonbelievers alike.\n\nThis medieval castle, built in the 14th and 15th centuries in the Brittany region of France, is tied up with one of French mythology’s most legendary groups of women: the Dames Blanches. These white ladies are spirits or supernatural beings that are rumored to float through the regions of Lorraine, Normandy, and the Pyrenees mountains. In the case of Château de Trécesson, they’re said to drift through the corridors at night and glide on surrounding bodies of water, clothed in muddy, ruined white dresses and flower crowns. One particularly cursed dame was said to be buried alive by her own brothers on her wedding day in 1750 because she accepted what they considered a dishonorable marriage. Though Château de Trécesson is currently under private ownership and inaccessible to the public, there have been alleged sightings of groups of ghosts playing cards, as well as a headless monk roaming the surrounding lands.\n\nBuilt somewhere between the 13th and late 15th century, this Irish castle has seen more gruesome deaths than a Game of Thrones wedding. It's said that during a struggle for power within the O'Carroll clan (which had a fondness for poisoning dinner guests), one brother plunged a sword into another, a priest, as he was holding mass in the castle's chapel. The room is now called “The Bloody Chapel,” and the priest is said to haunt the church at night. The horror doesn't end there. During castle renovations in the early 1900s, workmen found a secret dungeon in the Bloody Chapel with so many human skeletons that they filled three cartloads before being hauled away. The dungeon was designed so that prisoners would fall through a trap door, have their lungs punctured by wooded spikes on the ground, and die a slow, horrific death within earshot of the sinister clan members above.\n\nThere is a Gothic Revival style castle in midtown Toronto that, whether you realize it or not, you almost certainly have seen. On screen, that is. Casa Loma has made appearances in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, X-Men, Disney’s live action Beauty and the Beast, and as Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. This is partly because of the mansion’s distinct architectural qualities, but also because of its legend. There are decades worth of reported ghost sightings, including the spirit of Sir Henry Pallat, its original inhabitant, and his wife Lady Mary, for whom the castle was built. Even more frequently seen is the apparition of a maid from the early 1900s when 60,000 people in Toronto died of the flu.\n\nLocated about an hour north of Prague, Houska Castle has no fortifications, no kitchen, and had no occupants when it was built. It does, however, have something within its walls that no other castle in the world does—a large hole in the ground that many consider to be the gateway to hell. Houska was strategically built over the hole (which is fabled to be bottomless) to seal up the portal and keep demonic creatures from entering our world. The demons are said to be trapped in the walls of the lower level.\n\nHere's where the story gets really creepy: Before sealing it off, nearby prisoners were granted pardons if they would agree to be lowered into the hole by a rope and report back what they saw. When the first prisoner was lowered, he started screaming after a few seconds. When he was raised back up, he appeared to have aged 30 years. Or so they say."
