        "text": "Any country with a history as rich and exciting as France is bound to have some haunting remnants of its dramatic past, serving as a reminder of lives and times long gone. And in this instance, we really do mean haunting! There’s plenty of reports suggesting that supernatural activity in the country is alive and well to this very day (or undead and unwell, if you want to get technical).\n\nIf you fancy seeing if you can snag a supernatural sighting yourself during your villa holiday in France, head to one of these spooky settings that make up our list of the top ten most haunted places in France!\n\n1. Mont Saint-Michel\n\nThe ancient monastery on Mont Saint-Michel may be one of France’s most recognisable landmarks today, but according to the stories, the Archangel Michael had to burn a hole in Saint Aubert’s skull before he was persuaded to start building it. Today, the ghost of Captain Louis d’Estouteville stands guard on the mount, overlooking the site of his victory against the dastardly English in 1434.\n\nWhere to stay: Chateau Quatre Saisons – Within easy reach of this spooky area of France, Chateau Quatre Saisons is a rural retreat that even has some mysteries of its own… An old Cèdre du Liban on the property is reputed to have magical powers, while in the surrounding woodland you’ll find 14 Stations of the Cross – massive stone cross that note the site of an ancient pilgrimage.\n\n2. Versailles\n\nFrom stumbling through time into an 18th-century garden party to spotting Marie Antoinette in the garden, paranormal sightings at the Chateau de Versailles are a fairly regular occurrence.

Chateau de Commarque\n\nThis gorgeous chateau has a brutal past, being one of the strategic locations for the Hundred Years’ War. During the fight, the young love of the Earl of Commarque’s daughter was beheaded, and legend has it that the ghost of his horse haunts the grounds, searching for his master.
