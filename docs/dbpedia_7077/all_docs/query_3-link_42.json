In our last post, in honor of the Halloween season, we discussed spiders and what makes them fascinating. Today, we’ll be continuing this spooky series by talking about some of the most haunted places in Charleston and the surrounding areas! Did you know that Charleston is known as one of the most haunted cities in America? The city has a rich history that dates back to its founding in 1670. We’re here to discuss all of the spooky and haunted places in the area– Maybe you can visit one before or after a tour with us! If you are interested in learning more, you’re in the right place. Let’s get started.\n\nFounded in 1670, Charleston is a port city that is well known for its cobblestone streets and historic antebellum houses. The city has seen fires, hurricanes, flooding, and two wars, so it is no surprise that there may be ghosts lurking around. If you’re looking for something fun to do this Halloween season, there are a variety of haunted tours that you can participate in one evening after a guided eco-tour with Coastal Expeditions.\n\nOld City Jail\n\nLocated at 21 Magazine Street in Charleston, the Old Charleston Jail is a significant historical building that operated between 1802 and 1939. This jail housed some of Charleston’s most infamous criminals of the time, as well as Federal prisoners of war during the Civil War. Some notable inmates included John and Lavinia Fisher, who were members of a large gang and were convicted of highway robbery, and Denmark Vesey, an enslaved African American man who was accused of planning a slave revolt. Men, women, and children died in this building, some of whom were wrongfully jailed. It is said that more than 13,000 prisoners were executed on site, and that their ghosts haunt the jail today. Additionally, the jail was later used as a hospital and a home for those escaping slavery. Those who have toured the jail claim to have heard voices and the slamming of doors, while others claim to have seen objects move. The Old City Jail is considered to be the most haunted building in Charleston and has been featured on many paranormal and ghost programs on television.\n\nDock Street Theater\n\nThis theater is located in the historic French Quarter neighborhood of downtown Charleston at 135 Church Street. The structure standing today was built in 1809 as a hotel but was converted into a theater in 1935. It was the first building in the U.S. built exclusively for theatrical performances! However, the original building was most likely destroyed in the Great Fire of 1740. The theater is steeped in nearly 350 years of history and is said to be haunted by former theater-goers. Some guests have claimed to have seen spirits and shadows roaming the building, in the rafters, and even on the stage. A few of the same ghosts are said to be seen more than others. One of these ghosts is said to be Junius Booth, an English actor who used to perform with his theater group when the theater was renovated into a hotel for a short time. If the name sounds familiar, it might be because he was the father of John Wilkes Booth– The man who assassinated former President Abraham Lincoln. Although not confirmed, there is an urban legend that Junius Booth once became enraged and attacked the hotel’s manager, almost killing him. Were the Booths hot-headed, or did something in the theater provoke him to do so? Whether Junius Booth haunts the Dock Street Theater or not, there are still allegedly the ghosts of actors who just don’t want to leave the spotlight yet.\n\nCircular Graveyard\n\nThe graveyard next to Circular Congregational Church on 150 Meeting Street in Charleston was built in 1681. It is likely the oldest English burial ground still in existence in Charleston, with its earliest unmarked grave dating back to 1695, and about 150 burials taking place before 1776. This graveyard is the home of many Revolutionary War soldiers, and some people claim to have seen their ghosts wandering the grounds! Some notable people buried in this graveyard include John C. Calhoun, a U.S. Senator and Vice President, and Edward Rutledge, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Even if you don’t spot any spirits, the graveyard is worth combing through for the history alone.\n\nBattery Carriage House Inn\n\nLocated at 20 South Battery Street in Charleston, the structure was built in 1843 as a private mansion. It has recently undergone restoration and is now an 11-room luxury boutique hotel. Today, it is known as South Carolina’s most haunted inn, with both guests and staff reporting paranormal activity. Some of the alleged ghosts here tend to stay in certain areas of the building, for reasons unknown. For example, rooms 3, 8, and 10 are rumored to be the most haunted. One of these spirits, known as The Gentleman Ghost, is said to have a peaceful demeanor and doesn’t mind sharing room 10 with living guests. Another spirit, rumored to haunt room 8, doesn’t appear as kind– It has allegedly had guests run to their cars, appearing as a floating, headless torso. Yikes! Some speculate that this apparition is the ghost of a Civil War soldier.\n\nMorris Island\n\nMorris Island, located in Charleston Harbor, has a rich history filled with tales from the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and pirates. Due to this history, it is no surprise that there are stories and legends of ghosts haunting the island as well as nearby Folly Beach. Some say that Morris Island is the most haunted island in all of the South, with residents and tourists claiming to see strange and unexplained activity. Legend has it that Blackbeard, one of the most infamous pirates that ever lived, haunts Folly Island. Long ago, Blackbeard blockaded Charleston and threatened to burn it down, all while using Folly Island as a hideout. Additionally, many people have claimed to see the ghosts of Civil War soldiers near the Morris Island lighthouse."
