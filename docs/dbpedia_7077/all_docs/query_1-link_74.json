        "text": "Alcatraz Island\n\nParanormal Activity on\n\nAlcatraz Island\n\nA woman’s cries have been heard from strange areas of the island\n\nThe apparition of a man in gray has been seen around the grounds\n\nCold winds have been felt following the appearance of Alcatraz ghosts\n\nThe vision of the long gone island lighthouse is still seen at times\n\nMysterious banjo music has been heard\n\nSignificant cold spots are encountered in Cell 14D\n\nGhostly figures have reportedly been captured by tourist photos in the past\n\nDisembodied cries, voices, and sounds of slammed cell doors are common throughout the prison\n\nHistory of the Infamous Alcatraz\n\nOn a rocky island in San Francisco Bay sits perhaps the most famous prison in the United States. Alcatraz Prison has been immortalized by films, television, and stories told and retold for generations.\n\nOnce notorious for its inescapable position, Alcatraz was home to many infamous criminals in its short life as a federal prison.\n\nWhile its best known mystery is of missing escapees, Alcatraz has its share of ghost stories.\n\nFrom strange cold spots to ghostly voices in the cell blocks, it seems some souls remain entombed in the rocks of Alcatraz.\n\nGhosts in the Warden’s House?\n\nGhostly activity has been reported around Alcatraz since it opened. During the tenure of the first warden, James Johnston, guards and even Johnston himself reported strange activity. In one instance, Johnston was leading a tour through the prison grounds and the group heard a woman wailing.\n\nThey could not locate the source of the cries and they disappeared shortly after, leaving with a gust of ice cold wind.\n\nIn another instance with Warden Johnston, a man in gray appeared during a Christmas party at his home.\n\nWhen the man faded moments later, another cold wind blew through the house. It was powerful enough to extinguish the fire in the fireplace, or so the story goes.\n\nPhantom Lighthouse of Alcatraz\n\nIn addition to Johnston’s haunts, some have reportedly seen the old Alcatraz lighthouse on foggy nights.\n\nThough the original lighthouse has been gone for decades, some swear it appears in the night, its bright light swirling around, but only for a few moments. But the light, just like the vision of the lighthouse, disappears not long after it shows up.\n\nChilling Haunts in Cell 14D\n\nIn the prison itself, Cell 14D is a well known haunted hotspot. Popular lore states that a prisoner in the 1940s was locked away in Cell 14D and immediately began screaming that there was someone with glowing eyes there with him. By the time anyone checked on him, the prisoner was dead, apparently strangled.\n\nThis tale is likely embellished, but the experiences of modern tourists in Cell 14D aren’t. Many report the cell to be colder than all the others, sometimes by as much as 20 degrees.\n\nWhistling and Wailing Specters in Cell Blocks\n\nAcross Cell Blocks A, B, and C, many strange sounds have been reported. Most often, people report sounds of ghostly sobbing echoing through the cells at certain times.\n\nAt other points, visitors have claimed to hear moaning from these cell blocks, while others have heard disembodied voices. In some areas, tourists have heard sounds of people whistling and cell doors slamming as well.\n\nAl Capone’s Ghostly Banjo Tunes\n\nAs with many places associated with Al Capone, his spirit is said to haunt Alcatraz. In the later years of his stay on the island, Capone played banjo to help pass the time. Today, you can reportedly still hear the old gangster strumming on his banjo around the prison.\n\nStrangely, the twangy sounds of the ghost banjo are frequently heard around the old shower area of the prison. Some say that is where Capone played his music, not wanting to risk going out in the prison yard to do it.\n\nPhantom Photos From Alcatraz\n\nOver the years of tourists to the island, many of them have come away with their own paranormal experiences just from day tours.\n\nWhile countless photos have been taken around the prison, a select few have reportedly captured spectral images from the prison’s ghosts. In at least one instance, vivid apparitions have apparently been photographed looking directly into tourists’ cameras.\n\nAlcatraz: Island of Mystery\n\nAlcatraz Island remains one of the most popular tourist spots in San Francisco today. While the history and surviving prison structures are the main draws, plenty flock to Alcatraz hoping to spot a ghost. With the hauntings featured in recent years on SyFy’s Ghost Hunters and Travel Channel’s Ghost Adventures, the haunting lore of Alcatraz has never been more popular.\n\nWhile you can’t book a ghost hunt or paranormal tour at the prison, there are still plenty of tour options to choose from. There are even some nighttime tours, for the dedicated spooky explorer.\n\nAnd if you happen to hear Al Capone’s banjo tunes on your tour, try to whistle along. The ghostly whistlers in the cell blocks just might join in.\n\nWritten By\n\nMitch Goth\n\nMitch Goth has been a paranormal researcher since 2009.
