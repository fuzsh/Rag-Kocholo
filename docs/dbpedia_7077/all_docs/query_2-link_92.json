        "text": "Queen Mary Tours & Exhibits\n\nGet an up close and personal look at the Queen Mary with one of our exciting and informative guided tours. From the ship's groundbreaking construction and royal launch as the most luxurious and technologically advanced ocean liner at the time, to her duty as a troopship during WWII, to her golden days of the 1950s, to her earning the nickname, the \"haunted ship,\" the Queen Mary's history is full of action, adventure, romance and paranormal activity. Explore the ship bow to stern, inside and out, and hear unique stories, facts and insights about the Queen Mary with our tour expert guides.\n\nB-Deck FWD Portside | Daily 10am – 6pm\n\nA mysteriously vague entry in the ship’s log, dated September 1949, states that a passenger was found dead in his cabin; which is now the hotel room referred to as B340. While no name was given, legends have claimed the victim as “Walter.” There is much lore surrounding Walter and the events that occurred in B340; and many believe that Walter is a vengeful spirit who loves to make his presence known. Reports of strange activity in B340 span from the ship’s days as an ocean liner, to the present day. Perhaps all of the activity is just Walter trying to get someone to listen to his side of the story. If you’re feeling brave enough, ask him yourself. He might just tell you.\n\nVisitor’s Center D-Deck Stern | Daily 10am – 6pm\n\nThe Queen Mary had 4 massive propellers (or screws) to propel her through the waters at incredible speed. Each propeller was driven independently by its own turbine engine and was made of manganese bronze. The first set of propellers each measured 20 feet across and weighed 35 tons; however, these proved to produce too much vibration. The second set, and every set thereafter would consist of propellers that each measured 18.5 feet across, coming in at 32 tons each. The slightly smaller propellers proved much more effective to combat the vibration issue. In all, the Queen Mary would have 22 sets of propellers throughout her 31 years of sailing. Each time a new set would be installed, each of the propellers were so perfectly balanced that you could spin the massive propeller by hand! Visitors of the Propeller Box will be able to see the last remaining propeller on the ship.\n\nTourist Class Membership\n\nAnnual Cost | $150\n\nMembership Benefits:\n\n- Unlimited admission for cardholder\n\n- Two (2) Day Passes (General admission tickets) per year\n\n- Hotel guest pricing for Tour/Exhibit/Attractions tickets\n\n- 24-hour presale on Queen Mary Signature Events\n\n- Discounted ticket pricing during presale for Signature Events\n\nMembership Holders:\n\n- All member benefits for one cardholder\n\n- All member card holders are to be designated upon membership purchase.\n\n- If cardholders are to lose their card, they will have to pay a fee to replace the lost card, with the account being associated with phone or email.\n\n- Blackout dates apply\n\nOpportunities to donate as a non-member are also available.\n\nMake A Donation\n\nFor Existing Members\n\nStarting July 31, 2023 funds and existing memberships will transition to the Queen Mary Heritage Foundation (QMHF).
