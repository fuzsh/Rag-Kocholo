        "text": "Antelope Island State Park\n\nAnother case of abandoned property-turned-haunted are the buildings of Fielding Garr Ranch on the Great Salt Lake’s Antelope Island. The ranch, now part of Antelope Island State Park, was settled by rancher Fielding Garr and its oldest structure dates back to 1848. While the buildings have certainly provided a strong dose of the creepies, it is the woods between the ranch house and the lake that seem to provide more intense paranormal experiences. In 2021, a crew from local news outlet KSL documented some of the strange activity alongside a team from the Western Association for the Science of the Paranormal.\n\nAntelope Island is connected to another unique “ghost” story. In 1862 Salt Lake City police arrested local grave digger Jean Baptiste for robbing clothing and jewelry from coffins. He had a tattoo placed on his forehead and was banished to Antelope Island. During a low water year, which would have allowed Baptiste to walk to the mainland, he was moved to the more remote Fremont Island. People later checking up on him found his wooden shelter dismantled and a slaughtered cow, but no sign of Baptiste. Some say he never made it off the island and he still haunts it. Others say he drowned trying to escape and haunts the waters of the Great Salt Lake.\n\nIn addition to trying to creep yourself out, there are plenty of other things to do during a visit to Antelope Island. Bring binoculars and a camera on your trip. Visitors will likely see bison, pronghorn, mule deer, shorebirds, waterfowl, coyotes and even have a chance to spot a porcupine, burrowing owl or a bighorn sheep. There are also several hiking, mountain biking and horseback options on the island.\n\nTwo important tips. If you take your children, make sure to bring a change of clothes for the ride home. There is no way to keep them from wading into the Great Salt Lake. Prepare to have salty sand in your car for months after the visit. In addition, keep your distance from all wildlife, particularly the bison. People who don’t give the huge beasts plenty of space have experienced close up encounters they would rather have avoided."
