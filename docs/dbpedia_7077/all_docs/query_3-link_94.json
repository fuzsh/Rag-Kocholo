        "text": "Christchurch Priory, UK\n\nIt’s said that the tortured souls of long-dead monks wander the grounds of Christchurch Priory, a grand parish church on the south coast of England. Nearby streets are stalked by the ghosts of ‘grey ladies’. On paranormal tours of this old Saxon town, tourists can visit a shop that locals abandoned — spooked by the frequent ghostly happenings.\n\nThe priory was founded in the 12th century by the Bishop of Winchester. Over the centuries it has been the site of many tragic events, including the Black Death and the English Civil War. Many people lost their lives during these events. It is believed that the spirits of those who died to continue to haunt the priory to this day.\n\nChâteau de Brissac, France\n\nSet amid serene Loire Valley scenery, Château de Brissac is one of the world's most haunted places. The turreted façade of these castle walls hides the gruesome tales of this ghostly location.\n\nFor example, the story of the fifteenth-century nobleman Jacques de Brézé. Brézé found his wife entangled with another man — and in retaliation — murdered them both. Since then, this castle is said to be haunted by the \"Green Lady\".\n\nVisitors have reported seeing her ghostly figure, donning her infamous green dress, on the castle's staircase. Others claim to have heard frightful cries echoing through the castle. Many report an oppressive evil feeling when entering the grounds.\n\nKloster Unterzell, Germany\n\nThis abandoned monastery in the small town of Unterzell, Germany is said to be one of the most haunted places in the country. The sanctuary has a dark history, including allegations of abuse and murder.\n\nThe Bavarian nun Maria Renata von Mossau was one of the last people in Germany to be tried for witchcraft. After admitting to a string of crimes including Satanism and sorcery, she was decapitated and her body was cremated. More than 260 years later, people still report seeing her spirit traipsing through corridors at Kloster Unterzell, the convent she attended.\n\nLawang Sewu, Indonesia\n\nThis historic building was once used as a prison and execution site during World War II. Dutch colonialists built Lawang Sewu and the Japanese turned it into a brutal detention camp, where prisoners were interrogated and tortured. Some were even killed.\n\nIt is said to be haunted by the spirits of those who were killed there, including prisoners of war and political prisoners. These days, tourists and ghost hunters alike visit to try to witness the paranormal beings roaming among its decaying towers and arches.\n\nMount Everest, Nepal\n\nThe highest peak in the world is not only challenging for climbers but is also considered one of the most haunted places in the world. Many climbers have reported encountering ghosts, particularly on the treacherous North Face. Some believe that the spirits of climbers who have died on the mountain still linger there, unable to complete their journey.\n\nThe well-meaning ghost of Andrew Irvine has apparently egged on climbers tackling Everest. He and fellow mountaineer George Mallory were less than a thousand feet from becoming the first men to reach the top. Irvine’s body has still never been found.\n\nAkershus Festning, Norway\n\nOslo’s fortress, known to locals as Akershus Festning, has been in use since the thirteenth century. This medieval castle has a dark history, including executions, and is said to be haunted by the spirits of past residents.\n\nOver time it has served time as a castle, a prison, and even a base for the Nazis during their occupation of Norway. Resident ghouls include the ghost of a dog, which was buried alive in the Middle Ages to scare away intruders.\n\nThe Myrtles Plantation, USA\n\nThis plantation, located in St. Francisville, Louisiana, is said to be one of the most haunted places in the United States. The plantation has a dark history, including murder and slavery, and is said to be haunted by the spirits of past residents.\n\nLocal legend says that in the 1800s, an enslaved woman poisoned the plantation owner’s family and was hanged for her crime. Since then, she and the dead children have been spotted wandering through the grounds.\n\nHighgate Cemetery, London\n\nWith paths lined by mossy Victorian stonework, Highgate Cemetery is the final resting place of around 170,000 people, including the philosopher Karl Marx. It is also one of the most haunted locations in the UK.\n\nThe usually sleepy burial ground hit headlines in the 1970s, when reports of a blood-sucking, ghost-like figure started doing the rounds. Occultists desecrated old tombs, apparently in a bid to track down the mysterious ‘vampire’.\n\nTao Dan Park, Vietnam\n\nWith 10 hectares of gardens shaded by tall trees, Tao Dan Park gives residents of Ho Chi Minh City a chance to escape from the frenetic traffic. But when the sun goes down, some locals have a hard time relaxing. It’s said the ghost of a young man who was killed in a vicious attack still prowls the park, looking for his lost lover.\n\nConvent of St Agnes, Prague\n\nFew places are better suited to ghost stories than Prague, is a city with strong ties to alchemy, mysticism and the occult. The Convent of St Agnes, the city’s first gothic building, is one of the creepier spots.\n\nPeople say a murdered nun still haunts the place, and can appear in front of visitors. Sometimes she smiles softly but often she’s crying and covered in blood.\n\nCorvin Castle, Transylvania\n\nCorvin Castle, located in Transylvania, Romania, is a historic site with a reputation for being haunted. The castle, also known as Hunyadi Castle, was built in the 15th century and is considered one of the largest and most impressive castles in Europe.\n\nVlad the Impaler – the bloodthirsty ruler named after his favourite method of execution – was kept prisoner at Corvin Castle, in the hills of Transylvania. Many think this explains the strange sightings at the castle, which include vampire-like figures appearing in the candlelit corridors.\n\nSt Augustine Lighthouse, USA\n\nStriped like a barber’s pole, the St Augustine Lighthouse in Florida acts like a beacon for ghost hunters, who come to explore the tower and the keeper’s house after dark, using glow sticks to light the way.\n\nThey also get the chance to hear spooky stories about the lighthouse, and the family that died during its construction. Supposedly a man and his daughters all drowned when the lighthouse slipped loose and tumbled into the bay. Locals insist the girls can be heard laughing in the tower, and one has occasionally been sighted wearing the same velvet blue dress and hair bow she died in.\n\nRMS Queen Mary, USA\n\nThe RMS Queen Mary, a former luxury ocean liner that was converted into a hotel, is said to be haunted by the spirits of former passengers and crew members who lost their lives on the ship.\n\nBefore docking permanently in California, the ocean liner Queen Mary carried some famous passengers, including Winston Churchill and Greta Garbo. These days it’s better known for its uninvited guests, like the ghost of a young child who is said to have drowned in the luxury liner’s swimming pool.\n\nLondon Underground, UK\n\nThe world’s oldest underground railway has had more than 150 years to accumulate its juicy collection of ghost stories. Among the stations with a reputation for paranormal activity is Bethnal Green.\n\nDuring the Second World War, 173 civilians were crushed to death when rumours of an air raid triggered panic. Years on, people working at the station report hearing their screams.\n\nReady to travel to London?

The story is she hid originally in one of the rooms of this inn, and her ghost still haunts the room to this day.\n\nCarl Beck House, Canada\n\nThis 19th-century mansion is one of the most haunted houses in Canada. The Beck House was built in the early 20th century by a wealthy businessman, Carl Beck, who lived there with his family.\n\nTragedy struck the family when Beck's wife died in the house, and his daughter committed suicide in the house soon after. It is said that the spirits of Beck's wife and daughter still haunt the house to this day.\n\nVisitors and locals have reported strange occurrences and ghostly sightings within the Beck House. Many report hearing strange sounds at this haunted site. Some even report that the ghost of the daughter has been seen crying in the room where the tragic events took place.\n\nGreyfriars Kirkyard, UK\n\nGreyfriars Kirkland is the place of one of Scottland's most famous ghost stories.\n\nIn 1999, a homeless person broke into a coffin at this Edinburgh graveyard, hoping for a good night’s sleep. Soon after, people wandering through the graveyard began emerging with strange injuries, like scratched skin and broken fingers.\n\nOver the next few years, 140 people collapsed on tours of the cemetery, and the city council decided to seal the grave up again for good.\n\nNidaros Cathedral, Norway\n\nLLurking inside Trondheim’s majestic soapstone cathedral is the grisly ghost of a monk. Described as a tall figure with a dark habit, he reveals himself to churchgoers with blood dripping from a wound on his neck. He is apparently able to walk right through members of the congregation without them feeling a thing.\n\nThere are also reports of ghostly apparitions appearing in the cathedral's stained glass windows, as well as strange occurrences in the crypt.\n\nForbidden City, China\n\nThe Forbidden City, also known as the Imperial Palace, is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most popular tourist destinations in China. However, it is also known for its ghostly sightings and dark history.\n\nThanks to its location in the centre of modern Beijing, the Forbidden City lacks some of the cobwebby spookiness usually associated with haunted places. But today’s well-scrubbed, tourist-friendly exterior hides a bloody past. This area is known for its reported ghost sightings.\n\nMany believe the ghosts of murdered concubines wander the city after dark. Their ghostly figures roam the halls in traditional imperial attire.\n\nPort Arthur, Australia\n\nPort Arthur, Australia is a former penal colony that is considered one of the most haunted sites in Australia. The site was used as a prison and was known for its harsh and inhumane conditions.\n\nLantern-lit ghost tours give visitors the chance to hear ghost stories about this Tasmanian town’s troubled past as a convict settlement in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Those who want to maximise their chances of meeting a ghost can join a special paranormal investigation, armed to the teeth with ghoul-tracking gizmos.\n\nAchill Island, Ireland\n\nAchill Island is located off the west coast of Ireland and is known for its stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage. However, it is also known for being one of the most haunted places in the world.\n\nThe 100 abandoned stone cottages here are at least 800 years old. More than one party has reported paranormal activity around the stones. Many visitors report being visited by shadowy figures deep into the night. This is a popular camping spot for paranormal enthusiasts.\n\nLooking for inspiration for your next big adventure?

Built on a diamond rush, it became extremely wealthy but began declining during the 1950s when the precious stones ran dry. Now it’s been given over to the desert and, if you believe the rumours, ghosts are beginning to reclaim the abandoned buildings.\n\nVisitors have reported feeling uneasy and some have even claimed to have seen ghostly figures wandering the streets or peering out of windows. The ghost of a young woman, said to be the daughter of a former mine manager, is also said to haunt the town.\n\nReady to see Namibia for yourself?

It is well known for its well-preserved buildings and eerie atmosphere. The town was once a bustling mining community but was abandoned in the early 20th century. Today, the town is maintained in a state of \"arrested decay,\" giving visitors a glimpse into what life was like during the town's heyday.\n\nMany visitors and park rangers have reported strange occurrences and ghostly sightings within the town. Park rangers have also reported strange noises, such as the sound of a child laughing, coming from abandoned buildings.\n\nThe Island of the Dolls, Mexico\n\nThe Island of the Dolls, located just south of Mexico City, is one of the most haunted places in the world. The island is home to hundreds of creepy, mutilated dolls hanging from the trees. These have been placed there by the island's former owner, Julian Santana.\n\nSantana claimed that the dolls were placed on the island as offerings to appease the spirit of a young girl. She had drowned in a nearby canal and her spirit had haunted him ever since. In an attempt to appease her spirit, he began collecting dolls and hanging them from the trees on the island.\n\nThe dolls, some missing limbs and eyes, give the island a truly unsettling atmosphere. Some say that the dolls seem to move on their own or change position, adding to the eerie atmosphere of the island.\n\nTake a trip to see the most haunted places in the world\n\nReady to go on a ghost hunting mission of your own?
