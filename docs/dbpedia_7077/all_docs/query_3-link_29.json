We host respectful Honolulu Ghost Tours to share the ancient history and legends of Hawai‘i.\n\nClick the links below to check out our Honolulu Ghost Tours and Events.\n\nAll of our Honolulu ghost tours and events are led, personally, by Master Storyteller, Lopaka Kapanui. You may have come across his work in several national television spots, dozens of news, newspaper, and magazine articles, blogs, podcasts, and vlogs. You may have even seen some of his YouTube videos. Having hosted ghost tours for nearly 25 years, Lopaka is Hawaii’s leading researcher of the Islands’ most haunting legends, events, and ghost stories and his storytelling skills will create an atmosphere for an experience that you won’t soon forget.\n\nIs Hawai‘i Really Haunted?\n\nBefore becoming a world-class destination, before ghost tours, before outside visitors... the islands of Hawai‘i were steeped in oral traditions of a pantheon of gods and goddesses, of creatures that only came out at night, of shapeshifting beings in the upland forests and waterfalls which were inhabited by a translucent force that dragged young men into their dark depths in order to suck the spiritual life out of them. Even King Kamehameha found it necessary to appease the very gods themselves in order to secure victory in his campaign to bring the Hawaiian archipelago under one rule.\n\nLearn about Hawaii’s scariest places on our Honolulu Ghost Tours!\n\nHawaiian deities and spirits aren’t the only things residing in this island paradise. Here is also where the Japanese dog demons, the inugami, are sent to ruin the lives of unsuspecting families. Here is where the Filipino vampire-like creature, the aswang, roams in search of her next victim. And here is where the Portuguese witch, the feiteceira, spins her spells and curses at her whim. Rich in culture and traditions, modern-day murders and crimes of passion, the emotional state of unexpected deaths, and the history of plague and epidemics in Hawai‘i, these islands are overflowing with stories of ghosts and hauntings, creatures and curses. Master storyteller, Lopaka Kapanui, is a repository of these stories.\n\nHawaii’s Night Marchers: A History of the Huaka‘i Pō\n\nThe oral traditions of Hawaii’s Night Marchers were first passed down from mouth to ear by those who had witnessed the haunted procession. After Western contact and the influx of so many different cultures, hundreds of people have observed the ghostly army, Hawaiians and non-Hawaiians alike, all from different walks of life, and the most common question is, who are they?\n\nLopaka Kapanui has been researching and collecting ghost stories, legends, and the history of Hawai‘i for over twenty-five years and has published several of them into four separate books. Together with his wife, Tanya, the Kapanuis have compiled more than four dozen eyewitness narratives along with the history of the night marchers and put them into one book. For the first time, an authoritative compendium of accounts has been published, providing a definitive history and answering the question, “Who are the night marchers?”"
