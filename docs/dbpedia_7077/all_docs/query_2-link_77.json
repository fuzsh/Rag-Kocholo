        "text": "From India’s Ross Island to Poveglia Island in Italy, the stories of how these islands became abandoned are both spooky and sinister\n\nWhat are the events that lead to an island being abandoned? Everything from battles with nature, economic hardship, human conflict, and, simply, poor planning has led people to leave an island at any given time.\n\nIn most cases, the backstories are understandable, but for some, the history is more sinister. Actual facts mixed with dark embellishments by nearby local residents make for some spooky settings, with one island in particular referred to as one of the most haunted in the world. No matter the story behind each abandoned island, one through line remains: the ethereal beauty of a lost world.\n\nBelow, 11 of the most fascinating abandoned islands and the stories behind their desertion."
