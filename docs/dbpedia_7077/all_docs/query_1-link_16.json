Aligned to Common Core Standards and correlated to state standards. Core Library is an imprint of Abdo Publishing, a division of ABDO.\n\nA well-written, informative series providing detailed historical background about notable American sites alleged to be very haunted. Each volume opens with an anecdote about a personal encounter and outlines a variety reasons people believe in ghosts. Rational, natural, psychological, and/or scientific explanations are given for phenomena individuals have experienced that may seem like evidence. Some volumes discuss ghost-hunting tools used by investigators. The series is visually appealing, with atmospheric photos and illustrations that lend a good sense of place. Fact boxes and sidebars provide additional information. Student activities for comprehension and critical thinking, and resources for learning more drive readers to the publisher’s website.
