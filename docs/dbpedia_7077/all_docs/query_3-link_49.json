        "text": "13 OF THE MOST HAUNTED PLACES IN JAPAN\n\nJapan is one of the oldest nations on the planet and a country that has deeply rooted spiritual ties, with that history comes many centuries worth of folklore and mythology. These legends and stories have gone on to become the inspiration behind countless internationally famous horror films such as “Ringu” (The Ring) and Ju-on (The Grudge,). Still, one has to wonder if any truth lies behind these tales. Even now in the 21st century, where not many are devout believers in religion, weariness of the spiritual still exists and measures in defence against these situations have been normalized to a certain degree. This is evident in cleansings performed by shrines, cleansings performed on the sites of businesses before they open, the refusal by most to live in a home where a person has died, salt in the entrance of homes and businesses to keep out bad energy, and many more.\n\nYouth across Japan, believers and non-believers alike, take upon themselves a “test of courage” wherein they track down one of the many known haunted spots across the country and visit them to see if they can stomach the will to enter the unknown, holding their breath as they wait for something or nothing to happen. If you've ever wanted to partake in your own \"test of courage\" or are simply looking for an internet induced chilling-thrill from the safety of your home, then look no further! Below, we've curated a list of 13 of Japan's most haunted locations. Many of these spots were the unfortunate scenes of appalling events, as such, we urge readers and potential visitors to remain respectful of the tragedies that took place so as to avoid unfavourable events of your own.\n\n[Please be aware that this article contains sensitive and potentially disturbing content about mental health, suicide, and death. If this subject is a difficult or upsetting one for you, we ask you to please proceed with caution or to simply stop reading. If you or a loved one is struggling and you need someone to talk to, you can find a list of international support lines here.]\n\n1.YUUBETSU COAL MINE (湧別炭鉱) Hokkaido Prefecture\n\nIn 1923 the Yuubetsu coal mining town and its railway opened, and by 1967 it became one of the largest coal-producing towns in the nation; helping to thrust forward Japanese industry. The town once housed about 15,000 inhabitants and was packed with all the necessities for its citizens to enjoy a comfortable life such as its own hospital, a school and even a theatre. Despite these successes, there were countless calamities that plagued the miners and the inhabitants of the town, ranging from gas explosions, cave-ins, collapses of the mines and eventually an outbreak of the parasitic intestinal disease: dysentery. Throughout its period of prosperity, the mines alone caused around 187 lives to be lost in its 47 years of operation, Thus, the village closed its doors in 1970 and all of its inhabitants left. The once flourishing village became a ghost town.... literally.\n\nDue to the horrific events that took place in the town, it is said to have become haunted, with a number of rumours stipulating the various types of hauntings experienced from structure to structure. Supposedly, the most haunted place in Yuubetsu coal mine is said to be the town's hospital. The hospital is said to hold the strongest and most debilitating spiritual energy of the area, with claims that the sound of a screaming woman or footsteps can be heard all around.\n\nMany report instant onset emotions of dizziness and migraines until they leave Yuubetsu coal mine. Some claim that upon their attempt to escape, their phones begin to ring repeatedly until answered and that if you take the chance of answering this call you will be met with the sound of the wind and the same wailing that is heard from inside the hospital.\n\n2.THE ROUND SCHOOLHOUSE: NUMAHIGASHI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (円形校舎廃墟:沼東小学校）\n\nThe round-shaped schoolhouse was originally built in 1906 and was named Bannosawa Simple Education centre. It was built as a school for the children of the nearby Mitsubishi Bibai coal mine. For unknown reasons the school went through many name changes but eventually settled on the name it's now known as, Numahigashi Elementary school. Initially, numbers were low, but from the periods between 1940 to 70, as the mine prospered so did the number of students, eventually housing around 1500 children. In 1974 the school closed due to unspecified causes, the general public would believe that it was due to a drop in attendance from the local mining village closure, yet rumours claim something more sinister was at play.\n\nRecords state that during a class break, one of the young female students suddenly disappeared from school. Upon this realization, the student's teacher ended class and called the girl's home to check if she had gone home sick, but the family knew nothing of the girl's whereabouts. The entire school spent time looking for her but she could not be found anywhere and so the police were called. It's notable to mention that during this time, kidnappings were prelevant in Hokkaido, but no one could understand how the young student could've gone missing during their short break period. It was then rumoured that the girl had been \"spirited away.\"\n\nToday visitors to the ruins of the schools, and locals of the area claim that the spirit of the girl can be found around the school with her red backpack and countless others have made claims of giggles being heard from the nearby forest. It was rumoured that a psychic visited the school in an effort to free the girl's spirit but there was so much negative energy emanating from it, that the psychic had to run away. Some people claim that other darker entities reside on the school grounds and that a simple visit has been enough to drive some insane.\n\n3. MOUNT OSORE: FEAR MOUNTAIN (恐山) AOMORI PREFECTURE\n\nOsorezan is known as one of Japan's three most sacred sites. Originally called Mt.Usori, then later changed to Osore meaning fear or dread, Osorezan is known today as the site of Bodai-ji temple, where female mediums, called itako are said to be able to communicate with the deceased. Osorezan is a place that delivers visions of both the Buddhist descriptions of paradise and hell and is said to be one of the many gates to the underworld.\n\nAlthough its most recent eruption took place 10,000 years ago, the air around Osorezan is pungent with the smell of sulphur and the steam emanating from its peaks indicates that it is still an active volcano. Its lake, Usori, is filled with highly acidic water that is so poisonous that only one species of fish, the Japanese dace, has ever been able to survive there. Another species that inhabits this almost uninhabitable land is the mamushi, the venomous Japanese pit viper. If this isn't enough to illustrate for you a vision of hell, there, past the lake sits the mountain's own River of Styx: \"Sanzu no Kawa.\" In Osorezan, all departed souls must cross this river to reach the afterlife.\n\nDespite its reputation and informal name as Fear Mountain, Osorezan holds a surreal beauty that can only be described as otherworldly. Its rich history and its rumoured spiritual energy draws travellers from across the world.\n\n4. MEMORIAL FOREST: MORI NO SHIZUKU (旧慰霊の森) Iwate Prefecture\n\nMemorial Forest is one of the most tragic locations on this list. While the validity of spiritual occurrences is debatable, the devastating impact on the lives of those related to the victims of this disaster are very much real.\n\nIn 1971, an All Nippon Airways plane on route from Sapporo to Tokyo abruptly collided with in-training Self-Defence Force aircraft, causing the immediate combustion of the airliner, resulting in one of the most horrible aircraft disasters in the history of Japan. Each person aboard the flight lost their lives, and it was said that the bomb-like sound from the crash could be heard as far as 20 kilometres away.\n\nTo honour the lost souls of the 162 people aboard All Nippon Airways Flight 58, the prefecture erected a memorial in their name. Due to the nature of the harrowing event that took place there, the area is often regarded as one of the most haunted and spirtualistically dangerous places in Japan. It is not recommended to visit past sunset.\n\n5. YAGIYAMA BRIDGE (八木山橋) Miyagi Prefecture\n\nDuring the day, Yagiyama bridge is your run-of-the-mill transportation structure. It's one of the main ways to access the many popular tourism spots that Miyagi prefecture has to offer, and beneath the Yagiyama bridge is a valley of very geologically valuable strata. However, as is the case with every other location on this list, when the sun sets, the atmosphere of this simple structure is drastically changed.\n\nSince its erection in 1937, Yagiyama bridge has unfortunately been a location that attracts many suicides, despite the prefectural government's significant efforts to prevent these actions, such as countless attempts to redesign the bridge, and the implementation of bars and nets, there are still numerous tragic incidents that occur to this day. It's said that not only does this energy emanate from the bridge at night, but another darker energy is at play-willing passer-byers and motorists to blackout or to be involved in accidents.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Yagiyama bridge is a necessary structure of transportation in the area, and many locals rely on its existence to accomplish their everyday life necessities. Due to this, for those who don't drive, there is a public transport bus that runs over the bridge from the morning until well into the night. However, not many people use this bus due to the bridge's reputation. The night bus is especially barren as it's rumoured to act as a bringer of souls to other side. It's said that should the living attempt to ride the bus even unknowingly, they'll be unable to get off and taken to the underworld.\n\n6. SUNSHINE 60 (サンシャイン60) Tokyo Prefecture\n\nIkebukuro's Sunshine 60 is a place that almost everyone who lives in Tokyo or nearby has visited at least once. The skyscraper was once the tallest in Japan and was a pinnacle of Japanese innovation using a city-in-city design to incorporate offices, convention centres, shopping, entertainment, hotels and health centres all in one building. Today it remains a popular tourist attraction for all that visit Tokyo. What many don't know, is the dark history the land it's built on holds. Sunshine 60 is built on land that formerly housed one of Japan's most infamous detention centres, Sugamo Prison.\n\nFrom the 1920s until 1945 Sugamo was used to house political prisoners, then after WW2 the United States used it to hold as many as 2000 suspected Class A war criminals, including former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. These war criminals were often executed following trial. The prison closed in 1962 and was torn down in 1971 with Sunshine 60 being built to completion just seven years later. It's said that the name Sunshine 60 was chosen in an attempt to distract visitors from its morbid reputation as a former execution ground. However, some rumours claim that the \"60\" in the name is said to represent the sixty executions that took place there, many locals also state that the building looks too much like a gravestone for their liking.\n\n7. OIRAN BUCHI (花魁淵) Yamanashi Prefecture\n\nOff of an old road that was once part of National Highway 411 is a beautifully scenic spot called \"Saiko Waterfall.\" To the oblivious, this would be an enticing tourism rest-stop to enjoy the Japanese countryside, full of lush greenery, a gorge, and a waterfall but the chilling history behind the beauty may make you think twice about stopping over. This beautiful scenery happens to be where fifty-five women forcibly fell to their death.\n\nDuring the 16th century of the Sengoku period, one of the richest clans in Japan were the Takeda. This was due to the lands in which they were based, a landlocked area of which the only way to build their wealth and fund their armies was to mine, and as luck would have it they struck gold. As a result of the proliferation of the Takeda clan's gold mining, their operation required many guards, miners and women to entertain the men in their off hours. The Takeda clan was very protective of their gold, not all of it being used to fund their armies they often hid the gold around their lands, burying it in the hills for safekeeping or as an offering to the Gods.\n\nThroughout their rule, the Takeda Clan experienced a leadership change, unfortunately, this was during a brutal warring period. During the Battle of Nagashino in 1575 the Takeda clan was devastatingly defeated, as such, they scrambled to keep hidden their family secrets, namely their gold mines. Though the mines began to run dry, the family still worried that their mines and stockpile would be discovered and soon paranoia spread through the dying clan. To keep information from spreading they targeted the women, concerned that the prostitutes would have learned the location of the gold from the men they entertained.\n\nOver the Yanagisawa river, a platform was constructed. Upon it's completion, the prostitutes were invited to dance and celebrate at a farewell party. In the midst of their dance, soldiers began chopping away at the vines that held up the platform, causing it to collapse and all fifty-five women fell into the ravine below. Due to the sudden and immediate death that happened there, it is said that the land has been imprinted by the spirits of those who have died.\n\nMost of the hauntings that are said to occur at Oiran Buchi take place predominantly during nightfall. Those who have visited claim that they can hear the cries and screams of women falling to their deaths. It is also cautioned that men do not visit Oiran Buchi, as it's said that the vengeful spirits might attempt to take their revenge on any man who comes near the site.\n\nNear the bridge today stands a monument and a sign. The sign tells the story of what happened at Oiran Buchi, according to legend, it's said that if you read the entire sign a curse will also be placed upon the reader.\n\n8. Aokigahara Forest (青木ヶ原樹海) Yamanashi Prefecture\n\nThe Aokigahara Forest, or as it's referred to in Japanese, the \"Sea of Trees\" is undoubtedly the most famous location on this list. Known by most as the \"Suicide Forest,\" this location has been the topic of many horror novels, films and unwarranted Youtube videos. Aokigahara is unfortunately known as not only the most famous suicide location in Japan but second in the world after California's Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe forest is filled with beautiful lush greenery and a consumingly dense landscape that blocks out even the brightest sun rays, creating a consistently eerie atmosphere of quiet and darkness thus its name \"Sea of Trees.\" Due to the last eruption of Mount Fuji, the ground is rough and the soil is made of igneous rock; several caves lie deep under the ground, penetrated by widespread roots. Aokigahara, despite its reputation, is truly a beautiful place to behold.\n\nSo how did such a wonderous place become steeped in mystery and misery? Historically it's said that in periods of famine during the feudal era, people would bring their family members to the forest who they could no longer afford to feed-- usually older women, and leave them to starve to death, a practice called \"ubaste\". From then on it was said that the souls of those who starved were unable to move on and populated the forest, taking anyone with them they felt matched their miserable status in a family. Consequently, many locals began to stay far away.\n\nLater in 1960, the macabre reputation of the forest was revitalized upon the release of \"Kuro Jukai,\" or \"The Black Sea of Trees,\" a mystery novel written by Seicho Matsumoto that ends in the dramatic suicide of two lovers in the forest. Subsequently, in 1993 another book titled \"The Complete Suicide Manual,\" written by Wataru Tsurumi controversially explains various modes of suicide and even recommends Aokigahara as the perfect place to die. This book bizarrely went on to become a bestseller and is often found around the left-behind belongings of suicide victims.\n\nIn Japanese mythology, it is said that Aokigahara is haunted by demons and that those who enter the forest will never return. Due to the density of the trees, many hikers do in fact lose their way. Moreover, due to the magnetic iron in the volcanic soil, compasses and mobile phones have often been rendered useless. The Japanese believe that any person who dies with a deep sense of hatred, sorrow, anger, or desire for revenge cannot pass over into the afterlife and will thus become a \"yurei,\" or ghost.\n\nThis belief is continued today and is evident even in the body retrieval practices made by the forest's volunteers. When a body is found in Aokigahara, forest volunteers place it in a room next to the forest before being sent to the authorities. Legend has it that if the body is left alone in the room, the yurei will move around screaming.\n\n9. KAIZUKA TUBERCULOSIS HOSPITAL (貝塚結核病院) Osaka Prefecture\n\nRegularly functioning hospitals have the power to induce fear in the best of us. Being a place only visited if something is wrong, it is inarguable that hospitals are a place that people try to avoid under any circumstance. This emotion is only naturally deepened in the case of hospitals that are abandoned.\n\nKaizuka Tuberculosis Hospital is one such abandoned place that is able to strike a deep fear in the hearts of curious visitors. Dubbed one of the top three most haunted locations in Japan, Kaizuka originally opened its doors in 1948 at the peak of the Tuberculosis epidemic in Japan. The hospital was functional for over 40 years and considered a leading institution for care in Osaka due to their above-and-beyond initiative in their care of patients. A notable example of the hospitals initiatives was their addition of a school for child tuberculosis patients that later became a general school for disabled children.\n\nIn 1992 the hospital closed its doors and everything was strangely left behind. Visitors to the abandoned building claim that all surgical instruments in the surgery rooms are still present, as well as other hospital equipment and patient charts. As the building deteriorated, its eerieness grew. It's said that those looking to test their courage are immediately notified of their unwelcome, by the voice of a man who's said to yell at visitors to get out and go home.\n\n10. OKIKU'S WELL (お菊井戸) Hyogo Prefecture.\n\nHimeji Castle is the largest and most popularly visited castle in Japan, dubbed a UNESCO world heritage site in 1993, many from around the world gather here to take in its beauty. What many don't know, however, is that right in the front gates of the castle lies a well that was the inspiration behind Suzuki Koji's \"Ringu,\" one of the most renowned horror stories of our time.\n\nThe well is called Okiku's well and the legend behind it is a centuries-old tale of love and tragedy. There are many variations of the tale, however, the most popular tells the story of a servant girl named Okiku, who served under the samurai, Aoyama Tessan. Aoyama begins a plot to overthrow their lord but his plan is foiled once Okiku makes her lover, a loyal warrior aware of Aoyama's intentions.\n\nAoyama was known to be quite fond of Okiku and gave her an ultimatum that he wouldn't harm her should she agree to be his lover, but since her heart was already spoken for she refused his request. He then tried to blackmail her through his theft of one of ten precious heirloom plates owned by their court, but when that doesn't work he then brutally tortures her and then throws her into the well under the guise of stealing the plates. Before long he then hears Okiku's voice counting down the number of plates from one to nine, then breaking into a howling scream and sob. Eventually, Aoyama goes insane from the daily apparitions. It's said that Okiku's screams can still be heard every night at Himeji Castle.\n\n11. INUNAKI VILLAGE AND INUNAKI PASS TUNNEL (犬鳴村と旧犬鳴トンネル）Fukuoka Prefecture\n\nThere is a legend of a couple who at some time in the 70s were travelling within Fukuoka, just as they were about to approach the Inunaki tunnel, they heard a rattling sound, their car coming to a stop. Upon exiting their car, they find that their engine has died, leaving them stranded in the middle of nowhere. In their desperation, they notice a passage heading into the forest and decide to leave their car behind in pursuit of help. Along their walk through the ridged and overgrown trail, they discover a sign that reads \"The Japanese constitution is not in effect past this point.\" Confused, but feeling reassured at the prospect of help they continue until they come across a village, only to find it abandoned and deteriorating. They descend deeper into the village, looking around for any sign of inhabitants but are disappointed to find no one. A strange chill begins to build up in their chests before they decide to return to their car. As they begin to turn away from the village they hear a noise from the dwelling closest to them. Suddenly a man appears on the porch. The man cheerily welcomes them to the village and in the next motion suddenly slits their throats with a sickle--the inhabitants of Innuaki village do not like visitors. It is said that anyone who has the misfortune of coming across the village threshold will be greeted by the couple's abandoned vehicle, their decomposed bodies and soon after.. their own death. Such is the legend of Inunaki Village, a thankfully undiscoverable village supposedly located near Mt.Inunaki.\n\nAlthough the village has never been specifically found, the tunnel mentioned in the story and the tragedies that have occurred there are very much real. Inunaki Tunnel is considered one of the top three most haunted locations in all of Japan. The tunnel has been the host of multiple murder scenes both taking place inside, and outside--used as a disposal site. The most notable of these crimes is the brutal 1988 murder of Umeyama Kouichi. Umeyama who was just 20 years old at the time was a victim of robbery and kidnapping at the hands of a group of local teens. In their attempt to hijack his vehicle, the teens abducted, tortured and later burned Umeyama to death inside the Inunaki Tunnel, leaving him there to die. Luckily the teens were arrested and sentenced to life in prison soon after.\n\nThe tunnel has since been sealed on both ends, but this hasn't ceased its popularity as a horror tourism spot, its popularity reaching its peak in 2020 despite the pandemic.\n\n12. SSS CURVE (SSS) Okinawa Prefecture\n\nOkinawa is known across Japan as one of the biggest hot spots for spiritual activity, this is said to be because of the battles that took place there during WW2. SSS curve is known as one of the most haunted places in the prefecture and is said to be one of the main locations used as a training area for \"Yuta,\" the Okinawa shamans. The area is said to be home to an obscene amount of negative energy that causes visitors to experience hallucinations, nausea and dizziness. Even trained shamans are said to have met their demise against the forces present there, thus it's heavily cautioned for people not to visit. The area is not only home to these spirits but the lethal Okinawan habu snake making the area even more deadly.\n\n13. NAKAGUSUKU HOTEL RUINS (中城高原ホテル) Okinawa Prefecture\n\nNakagusuku hotel is said to have been ambitiously built in order to house guests visiting for the 1975 Okinawa Ocea Exposition. Due to its idealistic location portraying lustrous views of the Pacific Ocean, the East Chinese Sea and Nakagusuku Castle it was believed that the hotel would become a staple for tourism in the area. It was to be built with extensive amenities such as an observatory, a swimming pool, a zoo and an amusement park so as to attract as many guests as possible and ensure a unique experience.\n\nIt's said that prior to the hotel's construction, the developers were warned by monks from a nearby Buddhist temple that the site was home to numerous sacred sites and graves however these warnings were ignored. After many construction incidents, the workers refused to continue building as they said the site was cursed. In an effort to save face and avoid bankruptcy, the developer of the Nakagusuku went to the hotel with the intention of staying the night on the unfinished property to prove that the area was not haunted. However, it's said that the next day he was found insane, and disappeared soon after.\n\nOther rumours state that the hotel was actually in operation for two months, and during that time a child drowned in the pool. Following this incident, it is said that people were plagued by the hauntings of a crying child whenever they visited thus affecting business and forcing the hotel into bankruptcy. It's said that even today upon visiting Nakagusuku hotel you can still hear the cries of a small child.\n\nFor a look at all the haunted locations Japan has to offer, have a look at this interactive haunted site-seeing map\n\nWords by Jasmina Mitrovic"
