        "text": "The Sagamore Resort in Bolton Landing, built in the 1880s, is listed as one of the top 10 haunted hotels in the U.S. Numerous ghost sightings over the years have included a little boy who haunts the golf course, and a mysterious lady who enters guest rooms unbidden, hovering above sleepers and blowing a chill air onto their eyelids. Many guests since have given corresponding accounts of strange occurrences at the hotel. Some say they've seen the ghost of a middle-aged woman wearing a blue polka-dot dress moving through the hallways and hotel's restaurant. Others mention seeing children giggling in the hallways or on the golf course. There are even reports of one room being closed off to visitors because of strange noises during the night. One previous employee claimed that the hotel is built on a Native American burial grounds, which is the source of the paranormal activity.\n\nOhana's 1950's Diner\n\nTurkey Melts and French Fries aren't the only thing on the menu at this Tupper Lake landmark in the Adirondacks. Ohana's Diner began as a repair business, then reopened as a restaurant before it finally opened as the diner it is today. Oddly enough, as each new iteration of the business opened, incorporeal spirits reportedly became more and more active. Workers have reported hearing someone whisper their names, witnessed objects move across the restaurant, and felt the icy touch of something or someone that wasn't there. By all accounts, the most haunted part of the restaurant is the hallway between the kitchen and the bathroom! If you go, look out for the jukebox changing volume suddenly, or the popcorn popper turning itself on.\n\nSpanky's Diner\n\nSpanky's Diner in Massena has a reputation as one of the most haunted places in the Adirondacks. The current owner and operator of the diner reported that she's felt a presence pass by her when she's been alone in the basement, and seen the radio, lights, and knobs of the stove turn on and off of their own accord. Yet, the paranormal experiences don't belong to the owner alone. Guests have reported feeling uneasy at times, and have seen orbs with faces on them. One customer even had her shoelaces tied together while she was eating. Local ghost hunters have reported seeing a girl who drowned in the Grasse River walking around the diner, as well as man with an injured hip. Where do all these hauntings come from? Some point to the fact that Spanky's Diner is located next to the Pine Grove Cemetery! Speaking of which...\n\nThis final resting place is actually the second location of Pine Grove Cemetery. In the mid-1950s, graves from nineteen cemeteries on Barnhart Island were moved to accommodate the St. Lawrence Power Project and the Seaway. It is thought that many of the old caskets and remains were not handled with the greatest of care, and that they were buried in a heap in a mass grave at the new cemetery. Stories about hauntings and strange happenings surround the cemetery, but our favorite is that snowmobilers have shared accounts of seeing children running and playing in the graveyard in winter. Visitors are welcome at Pine Grove from dawn until dusk. Visit the Barnhart portion of the cemetery at the rear where the remains of the Barnhart family reside behind iron fencing that does little to keep their spirits inside."
