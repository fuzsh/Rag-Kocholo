Now, the asylum has re-opened and is accepting new patients! Brighton Asylum is a massive walk-through dark attraction filled with terrifying live actors, horror movie style scares, and Hollywood quality special effects. Check in here. You have nothing to lose but your mind!\n\nLocation\n\nBrighton Asylum is located at the BACK of:\n\n2 Brighton Ave Passaic, NJ 07055 (border of Clifton)\n\nDO NOT USE SADE STREET TO ENTER\n\nLimited onsite parking is available. If you cannot find us, it is because you are at the FRONT of 2 Brighton Ave, and need to drive around to the back of the building.\n\nOff site parking lot with shuttle bus available Halloween season at Clifton High School (333 Colfax Ave) in Clifton, NJ 07013. Park there and ride the bus 4 minutes to Brighton Asylum. Multiple buses provide service to and from the Asylum free of charge. This service is available from when we open until the last guest is dropped back to their vehicle."
