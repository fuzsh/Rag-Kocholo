        "text": "Though New Orleans is reportedly home to many haunted spots—from Faulkner Books and the Old Absinthe House to Muriel's and Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop—the \"most haunted\" award would likely go to the LaLaurie Mansion on Royal Street. Reports of paranormal activity coming from this house have been reported for over two centuries, and many of its hauntings are attributed to the LaLaurie's gross mistreatment of enslaved people. The house has a dark history that includes torture, murders, a fire, and ongoing paranormal activity (warning: The stories are heavy). Though you can't go inside of the house, you can walk right up to it by taking a ghost tour.\n\nVISIT NOW\n\nImposing and brick-clad, Eastern State Penitentiary once was the most expensive prison in the world and even held the likes of Al Capone. Nowadays, the 142-year-old building, which closed in 1971, is more so known for its haunts, complete with spooky voices, audible crying, and footsteps throughout. The penitentiary has since embraced its reputation by hosting Halloween Nights at Eastern State Penitentiary, featuring five chilling haunted houses and themed bars to boot.\n\nThe hotel that inspired Stephen King’s The Shining also has spooks of its very own. It originally opened in 1909, and many areas of the hotel are said to be haunted, like Room 217 (yes, the room from the movie appears to be haunted in real life, too) and the Concert Hall, with a ghostly piano that plays late at night. To hear all the ghost stories of the hotel, be sure to take The Stanley Hotel Night Tour, led by a storyteller in the know.\n\nOnce a gleaming ocean liner that launched in 1934, the Queen Mary now serves as a docked hotel—but many consider it one of the most haunted places to visit in the United States. It’s reported that 49 deaths have taken place on the Queen Mary since it was built, with guests attesting to spirited happenings like lights turning on and off, unexplained knocking on doors, and ghost sightings. To learn more about these spooky surroundings, take a day tour or, if you dare, sign up for a night tour.\n\nWhile the title of this compound isn’t exactly respectful or socially acceptable these days, the name lives on as a place that’s filled with uneasy spirits. Built in the mid-1800s, it wasn’t exactly a happy place, and many of these forlorn, tortured souls are said to still roam its halls, where ghosts like Jim James ask for a cigarette, and a little girl named Lilly plays with toys. It now serves as a haunted house where you can get a first-person view of these specters.\n\nCalled “One of America’s Most Haunted Homes,” The Myrtles Plantation, constructed in the 1700s, is certainly beautiful—but inside, it hides dark secrets. Several unfortunate events have occurred at this historic home that potentially led to its paranormal status, with apparitions appearing throughout the property. If you have the courage, take a tour, stay at the hotel, or dine at the restaurant.\n\nWhile drenched in daylight, the St. Augustine Lighthouse looks like your average historic beacon, acting as a backdrop for visiting tourists taking photos. But this 19th-century lighthouse is said to be incredibly haunted. Its most famous supernatural residents? “The Pittee Girls, who passed away tragically on the property. People say they’ve spotted the girls, who particularly enjoy playing tricks on visitors. Get the full experience by going on the Lighthouse Ghost Tour.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the Gettysburg Battlefield is heavy with ghosts. The field, known for the bloody 1863 Civil War battle, holds myriad reports of supernatural events (with soldiers making frequent appearances), with the field’s Devil’s Den rock formation acting as a hub for many of the sightings. Visit these eerie locales by taking a ghost tour, on foot or by bus.\n\nThe only thing that’s as numerous as Victorian mansions throughout the Old Louisville historic district is its paranormal events. As the largest Victorian neighborhood in the United States, seem to call these homes their own, and there are ghost tours that will fill you in on all the haunting tales.\n\nCompleted in 1934 and sitting within eyeshot of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island was once one of America’s most famous prisons and known for its eerie events. In fact, the Miwok Indians long considered this island to be populated by evil spirits, and the past presence of the melancholic inmates on the island hasn’t helped either. Be on the lookout for haunted cell 14-D during a tour.\n\nConstructed in the mid-19th century and showcasing stunning columns, The Bellamy Mansion certainly looks beautiful on the outside, but inside, it’s holding a gaggle of ghouls. It’s been the subject of intense paranormal investigation, including recordings of haunting voices. To feel the spirits all around you, take a regular tour or, if you’re feeling brave, a ghost hunt tour.\n\nIt’s worth it to take in a show at this 1920s theater for the visuals alone, with its ornate, gilded details and showing off plenty of bygone glamor. But if you’re a ghost enthusiast, you’ll also love that it’s a stop on the Haunted History Trail of New York State. It’s said that the spirits of past actors continue to haunt this venue, with footsteps and laughter filling the spaces.\n\nBranding itself as “America’s Most Haunted Hotel,\" The Crescent Hotel & Spa, built in 1886, is known for its supernatural goings-on. Images of ghosts, including ones with names like Michael and Theodora, appear in photographs taken around the hotel, and a variety of ghost tours are offered to get up close and personal with the specters. You can even book a ghost-themed overnight package.\n\nIt makes sense that prisons, with their pasts filled with unhappy prisoners, seem to become haunted in their later years, and it’s certainly the case at the 1866-built West Virginia Penitentiary. It’s even been explored by the Travel Channel’s Ghost Adventures. Many paranormal tours are offered, and things really come alive during the Halloween season.\n\nA lighthouse seems quaint and charming when compared to, say, a prison, but these structures can be haunted too. For instance, there’s the Sheffield Island Lighthouse. It’s been around since 1868, accessible only by boat and known for its spirits as explored through a paranormal investigation. But this one apparently only has “friendly spirits,” who can be visited after taking a lighthouse ferry cruise.\n\nWith a gorgeous exterior and beachside locale, it only looks like sun and fun at the Hotel del Coronado. However, it’s home to a famous ghost. Kate Morgan checked into the hotel in 1892 but proceeded to take her own life. The melancholic ghost continues to reside in her original guest room, complete with doors that open and shut on their own and spooky voices. Book an overnight stay if you have the gumption.\n\nA brewery is usually a place where you can sit back with friends and enjoy a beer, right? Well, at Moon River Brewing Company, that’s certainly true, but it comes with a side of the supernatural. It happens to be one of the oldest buildings in Savannah (all the way back to 1821), and it’s said that ghostly activity takes place in every area of the building. There are many local ghost tours that include the brewing company as a stop.\n\nThe Congress Plaza Hotel is considered to be one of the most haunted hotels in Chicago. Guests have reported spotting the ghost of Al Capone, who was a past resident of the hotel, along with the roguish ghost Peg Leg Johnny. Plan to stay overnight or attend the hotel’s famed Haunted Halloween Ball.\n\nAnother hotel that’s frequented by apparitions is The Bowery Hotel in New York City. It’s reported that a not-so-nice poltergeist lives at the hotel and enjoys stopping the elevators, and fellow hotel guests seem to disappear in mid-air right in the middle of conversations. Take it all in with a ghost tour or stay overnight if you have the nerve."
