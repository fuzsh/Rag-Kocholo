        "text": "Below you’ll find a list of 22 of the scariest places on earth, some of which you will most likely of heard of and some of which you may have not. What is for sure, though, is that you’ll probably want to read some of these creepy stories with the lights on!\n\nAlthough our speciality here at Haunted Rooms is the UK’s most haunted hotels, we’re fascinated by any haunted place, and there are lots of them about. So, we have decided to put together what we think are the most haunted places in the world. See our sister site for the most haunted places in America.\n\nHere are the most haunted places in the world!\n\n1. Eastern State Penitentiary, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nBuilt in 1829, Eastern State Penitentiary is a former prison in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It’s known for being the very first prison of its kind to introduce solitary confinement, or what they used to call the Pennsylvania System.\n\nPrisoners were sent to solitary during this time as a form of rehabilitation. They would be completely isolated, living alone, eating alone, and even exercising alone in their yards. Whenever an inmate left his cell, a black hood would be placed over his head to assure he remained in confinement.\n\nDue to the Eastern States’ harsh approach, many prisoners were driven to insanity, and as a result, the Pennsylvania System was scrapped in 1913. From then until 1970, it was used as a regular prison and held the likes of Al Capone and the bank robber Willie Sutton.\n\nReports of the paranormal have been going on since the 1940s, but ever since the stone prison was abandoned in 1971, paranormal experiences have seemingly increased.\n\nReports include:\n\nShadowy figures that seem to quickly turn away when approached\n\na dark figure that is occasionally seen in the guard tower\n\nan evil cackling is heard coming from cell block 12\n\nshadowy figures have been seen sliding down walls in cellblock 6\n\nghostly faces have been witnessed in cellblock 4\n\nand strange sounds such as disembodied footsteps, distant talking, and banging of cell doors have also been heard.\n\nVisit Eastern State for more info\n\n2. Waverly Hills Sanatorium, Kentucky, United States\n\nWaverly Hills was originally a two-story wooden building that was opened in 1910. However, the building you see today was constructed in 1926. It served as a tuberculosis hospital throughout the early to mid 20th century, when the disease was at its worst. It is believed that as many as 63,000 patients died there.\n\nThe death toll and the supposed mistreatment and questionable experimental procedures on patients are all recipes that may be behind one of the most haunted buildings in the whole of the US.\n\nThe Waverly Hills Sanatorium has built quite a reputation over the years as more and more people are allowed to investigate the premises. This has thrown up some incredible evidence over the years.\n\nIt has featured on shows such as Ghost Adventures, Ghost Hunters (TAPS), and our very own Most Haunted. TAPS captured a figure on their thermal imaging camera that seemed to be walking across the hall. The figure was about 3ft tall, and they later found out that the ghost of a young boy named Tim had been spotted there before.\n\nThere are vast amounts of varying reports, including full-bodied apparitions, fleeting shadows, screams from empty rooms, footsteps, sudden cold spots, and disembodied voices, among many others.\n\nLearn more about Waverly Hills Sanatorium\n\n3. Monte Cristo Homestead, New South Wales, Australia\n\nThe historic Monte Cristo Homestead in Junee, New South Wales, is regarded as the most haunted location in Australia. Its reputation stems from several tragic events that have occurred there since it was built in 1885.\n\nFrom its construction up to 1948, the Crawley family owned and resided in the property. During this time, the family witnessed many deaths, including the tragic death of a young child who was dropped down the stairs. A maid to the family is believed to have fallen from the balcony, and a stable boy burned to death on the property.\n\nA mentally ill man named Harold (the son of a caretaker) was chained up in the caretaker’s cottage for 40 years. He was found curled up next to the body of his dead mother and sent to a mental institute, where he died shortly after.\n\nThe tragedy doesn’t end with the Crawley’s. After the house was left in 1948, it was taken over by a group of caretakers, one of whom was murdered in the caretaker’s cottage.\n\nLearn more about the Monte Cristo Homestead\n\n4. Castle of Good Hope, Cape Town, South Africa\n\nThe Castle of Good Hope in Cape Town, South Africa, was built in the 17th century by the Dutch East India Company. It’s the country’s oldest colonial building, originally serving as a replenishment station for ships passing the treacherous waters of the Cape.\n\nThe first reported paranormal occurrence was when the apparition of a tall gentleman was seen in 1915 on one of the castles’ ramparts.\n\nThe man wasn’t seen again until 1947, when he was seen regularly over two weeks. He would be seen jumping off the side of one of the castle walls and walking between the bastions Leerdam and Oranje.\n\nOne of the most popular stories associated with the Castle involves the former governor Pieter Gysbert van Noodt. He died on 23 April 1728, the same day he had sentenced seven soldiers to death after they were caught attempting to desert the military.\n\nIt’s believed one of the soldiers placed a curse on him and demanded he come to watch the execution, which he didn’t. Later that day, Van Noodt was found dead, slumped over his desk with a look of terror on his face.\n\nAnother famous haunting is the Lady in Grey. She has been witnessed running through the castle, holding her face and crying hysterically. However, since a woman’s body was found during recent excavations, her ghost hasn’t been reported.\n\nSometime in the 1700s, a soldier was found hanging from the bell rope in the bell tower, which overlooks the entrance to the castle. After his death, the bell tower was sealed off. However, the bell has been known to strike off its own accord to this day.\n\nThere’s also the ghost of a black dog who has been known to pounce on unsuspecting visitors, then vanish into thin air.\n\nLearn more about the Castle of Good Hope\n\n5. The Tower of London, London, England\n\nWith a history of torture and execution going back over 900 years, the Tower of London is regarded by many as one of the most haunted places in the UK. It was originally built in 1078 by William the Conqueror and has served a significant role in the history of England ever since.\n\nThere have been many reports of the paranormal at the Tower of London over the years. The most famous of all the ghosts that live within its walls is Anne Boleyn’s ghost, the wife of King Henry VIII. She was beheaded in 1536, and her headless body has been seen walking the Tower’s corridors and often near the spot of her demise.\n\nOther full-bodied apparitions have also been seen, including Lady Jane Grey, spotted by a guardsman in 1957. In the White Tower, the White Lady has been seen, often standing at the window, where she once stood waving to her children on the other side of the building.\n\nPerhaps the most spine chilling of all reports includes the mysterious appearance of two children. They have been witnessed throughout the rooms of the castle. They’re often seen in their nightgowns, holding hands and with a look of terror on their faces.\n\nIt is believed these are two former Princes who were sent to the Tower after they were deemed illegitimate by Parliament. They vanished one day, and it was assumed that they were murdered by order of their uncle, the Duke of Gloucester. Two small skeletons were exhumed beneath a staircase in the White Tower.\n\nLearn more about the ghosts of the Tower of London\n\n6. Ancient Ram Inn, Gloucestershire, England\n\nBuilt in 1145, the Ancient Ram Inn is believed to be the most haunted house in the entire British Isles and perhaps the most haunted house in the world. The tales of child sacrifices, devil worship, and evil spirits are behind the terrifying happenings in this building.\n\nThe Inn was built on the intersection of 2 ley lines, which many people believe is a conductor for spiritual activity. In addition, an ancient Pagan burial ground is said to have resided in the property over 5,000 years ago.\n\nDuring its time as bed and breakfast, people would often flee in the middle of the night, often seeing full-bodied apparitions in their rooms, the feeling of being touched/pulled, disembodied voices, and the just the general sense of evil.\n\nJohn, the previous owner (now deceased) of the Ram Inn, reported that on his first night in the house in 1968, he felt a presence grab his arm before being dragged out of bed and across the room!\n\nJohn had since found evidence of devil worship and ritual sacrifice. He found two child skeletons underneath the staircase, as well as broken daggers. Owners and visitors continue to experience hauntings and attacks to this day.\n\n> Join a Ghost Hunt at the Ancient Ram Inn <\n\n7. Fort George Citadel, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nLabelled as Canada’s most haunted historic site, the Halifax Citadel has received hundreds of reports of ghost sightings over the years. Situated at the summit of Citadel Hill in Halifax, Nova Scotia, this star-shaped fort is almost 300 years old, with the original foundations being built in 1749 and reconstructed in 1856.\n\nStaff and visitors have reported several apparitions walking the grounds here. One particular visitor witnessed a soldier in uniform walk into one of the rooms in the old prison area and vanish.

Banff Springs Hotel, Alberta, Canada\n\nThe Banff Springs hotel in Alberta, Canada, was built over 125 years ago by the Canadian Pacific Railway as a luxury stop-off point for train travellers. Don’t let its picturesque surroundings fool you though, as it’s rumoured to be one of the most haunted in the country.\n\nTerrifying reports include sighting a bride who fell down the staircase, breaking her neck after panicking when her dress caught fire. Her apparition has been seen on the stairs and in the ballroom dancing, with many reporting the flames from the back of her dress.\n\nThe main story that locals tell is that of the family that was murdered in room 873. The door to this room has since been bricked up, but the family that lost their lives in this room are still seen to this day, often in the hallway outside the room.\n\nPerhaps the most popular of all the reports is the former bellman, Sam Macauley. He served at the hotel during the ’60s and ’70s and is still seen today. He likes to help guests up to their rooms, dressed in his 60’s uniform, often turning on lights and opening locked doors. If you try and make conversation or tip Sam, he vanishes.\n\nCheck Availability\n\nLearn more about the haunted Banff Springs Hotel\n\n9. Château de Brissac, Maine-et-Loire, France\n\nOriginally built in the 11th century as a castle by the Counts of Anjou, Château de Brissac was rebuilt in 1502 by Charles II, Duke of Brissac, who gave it its name. This noble castle is the tallest in France, and it exudes old-world charm, but one of its past residents has shocked more than one visitor.\n\nA double murder in the 15th century within the castle walls has resulted in one of the more famous ghosts of the Château de Brissac, that of the la Dame Verte, or “Green Lady”.\n\nThe current residents (the current Duke of Brissac and his family) have become accustomed to her roaming the rooms, but she has scared many guests.\n\nShe is often seen in the tower room of the chapel, wearing her green dress. What’s terrifying, however, is her face. If she looks at you, you’ll see that her face has gaping holes where her eyes and nose should be, resembling what a corpse would look like.\n\nAs well as her sighting, her moans are also often heard throughout the castle in the early hours.\n\nLearn more about Château de Brissac\n\nCheck Availability\n\n10. Borgvattnet Prästgård, Sweden\n\nBorgvattnet is a small village in Jämtland County, Northern Sweden. It’s renowned for having one of the most haunted houses in Sweden, The Old Vicarage, built in 1876.\n\nThe first ghost ever documented at the vicarage came in 1927, when the chaplain Nils Hedlund resided. He reported many strange happenings, including one particular encounter with something paranormal. He was on his way up to the attic to gather his laundry when he witnessed his laundry being torn down from the line by an unseen force.\n\nRudolf Tangden, a priest who lived at the vicarage during the 1930s, saw an older woman dressed in grey appear in a room. He followed her as she walked away, but she vanished in front of his eyes. In the 1940’s Tangden’s successor, Otto Lindgren, and his wife said they had several paranormal experiences, including unexplained sounds and moving objects.\n\nOn one occasion, a woman staying in the guestroom was awoken in the middle of the night to see three older women sitting staring at her. She quickly turned on the light, and they were still there. However, they now appeared blurry.\n\nIn 1945 the chaplain, Erick Lindgren, moved into the vicarage, and he began a journal recounting many of his own experiences in the house. He reported being thrown out of his chair regularly by an unseen force.\n\nThe current building is serving as a restaurant/cafe, as well as a guest house.

Many Venetians were sent here to die, their dead infected bodies being burned on giant pyres. This was also the case in 1630 when the Black Death swept through Venice.\n\nThe site was used as a mental asylum during the 1800s. However, many sources state that this simply is not the case.\n\nStories persist of the ill-treatment and experimental procedures carried out in the building. In 1930 a doctor was believed to have committed suicide, jumping to his death from the bell tower. From the mid-20th century up until 1975, when it was closed, Poveglia hospital was used as a senior centre.\n\nToday the whole island is abandoned, and it’s believed that many locals dare not step foot on the island for fear of being cursed.

In the 1950s, Julian Santan Barrera moved to the island (despite being married to a young family).\n\nJulian was unaware of the area’s dark history when he moved there to become a hermit. Legend says three young girls were playing near the water in the 1920s when one of the girls fell in and drowned in the murky waters.\n\nLocals believed that the young girls’ spirit had been unable to leave the island ever since her death. It soon grew quite a reputation as a haunted place, and locals wouldn’t go near it at night for fear of what they may see.\n\nJulian claimed that a little girl began speaking to him as soon as he moved on the island. The girl told Julian how she had died and was trapped on the island. He began to get the dolls for this little girl, often selling off fruit and vegetables that he had grown on the island to buy old dolls for her to play with.\n\nJulian later told his nephew that it was becoming more difficult to appease the young girl’s thirst for these dolls, with him seemingly worried that she wanted him to join her in her watery grave. The same day he had this discussion, his nephew returned to the island when he found his uncle face down in the canal. His body was in the same spot where the little girl had drowned seventy years before.\n\nToday, tourists to the island often speak of the doll’s eyes following them. Others have also reported that the mutilated dolls whisper to them, especially at night. Julian’s ghost is also said to remain on the island, as well as the young girls’.\n\nLearn more about the Island of the Dolls\n\n15.

The location is now a popular tourist destination, running daily tours to people interested in learning about the history and the legends associated with the close.\n\nSince the 17th century, there have been reports of paranormal goings-on in the close, and it’s now regarded as one of the most haunted places in Scotland. The Coltheart family who lived there in 1685 were the first ones to report something paranormal. Soon after they moved in after the plague outbreak, they began to see ghostly figures and were left terrified after seeing phantom disembodied limbs and experiencing very vivid nightmares.\n\nToday, staff and visitors have reported seeing the ghost of a ‘worried woman’, a woman in black, and a little girl named Annie. The spirit of Annie has been known to interact with people who leave her gifts in one of the rooms.\n\nOther reports include sounds, such as scratching, the sounds of a party or tavern, and footsteps that seem to follow you around. Stones have also been thrown, and intense EVP’s are often captured throughout the area, particularly in Mr Chesney’s house.\n\nLearn more about the ghosts of Mary King’s Close.\n\n21. The White House, Washington D.C., USA\n\nPerhaps the world’s most famous residence, the home, and office of the President of the United States. It has been the official residence of every President since 1800 when John Adams first moved into the house.\n\nWith the vast amount of history and historical figures that have graced its rooms, it’s no wonder that the White House has a tale or two of hauntings. It’s considered to be the most haunted house in America.\n\nPast presidents, their families, and foreign dignitaries have all attested to the paranormal goings-on at the White House.\n\nOn one particular visit, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom. He had just finished bathing and walked back into the suite, where he saw Lincoln standing by the fireplace. He refused to sleep in that room again after that.\n\nOther people that have said they have seen the ghost of Abraham Lincoln include President’s Teddy Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Dwight Eisenhower; First Ladies Jacquie Kennedy and Ladybird Johnson; and presidential children Susan Ford and Maureen Reagan. Maureen and her husband witnessed Lincoln standing by the same fireplace where Churchill had once seen him.\n\nReportedly Queen Wilhemina of the Netherlands was staying in the Rose Room when she heard a knock on the door in the middle of the night. When she answered, she was confronted by the ghost of Abraham Lincoln, standing in the hallway.\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson is believed to haunt the Rose Room, with numerous White House employees reportedly hearing his hearty laughter or him in a fit of rage, swearing violently.\n\nThe ghost of Abigail Adams (wife of John Adams) has been seen floating through the East Room. This is the room where she used to hang her laundry. Several eyewitnesses, including staff and visitors, have seen her seemingly floating across the room with her arms outstretched as if carrying a laundry basket.\n\nVarious other spectres have also been seen, including past employees, Presidents Thomas Jefferson and John Tyler; First Lady Dolley Madison; a British soldier; and Anne Surratt. Sudden cold spots, disembodied footsteps, voices, knocks, and screams have also been reported at the seemingly very haunted 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n22. Aradale Lunatic Asylum, Australia\n\nHaving been built in 1876 due to Victoria’s growing population of so-called “lunatics”, the Arradale Asylum had been a place of torment, with over 13,000 patients believed to have tragically died there.\n\nMuch like other asylum’s of the time period, gruesome method were applied to “treat”, those suffering. Particularly barbaric treatments such as electroshock therapy, and labotomies were carried out in the building, with often deathly consequences.\n\nGiven that such horrific acts were conducted here, it’s little wonder that the spirits of those lost souls are condemned to haunt this eerie complex to this day. Harrowing calls for help can be heard coming from empty cells, and the terrifying apparitions of past patients are often seen throughout. People visiting the location have been forced to leave due to the overwhelming sensation of sadness, and extreme nausea.\n\nIf you’re in South western Victoria, then a trip to the Arradale Lunatic Asylum should be on your bucket list. Tours start at $22 for adults, and are offered daily.\n\nView more info on Arradale Lunatic Asylum"
