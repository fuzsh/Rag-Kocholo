Here, we have some interesting stories about some of the places we bring our guests and a few places you may not want to venture to alone.\n\nWe'll let you decide but be forewarned: Should you choose to strike out on your own, you are your own keeper. Meaning, what we note here are facts, legends, and observations, it is not a tourist’s guidebook or study manual of where to find “supernatural” occurrences. The places mentioned here, like many places in Hawai‘i, are very much like people; some will welcome you, some will not. To venture out alone is purely at your own risk.\n\nThe Most Haunted Places in Hawai‘i (and a few haunted beings as well).\n\nClick on the icons to learn about a few interesting places in our island home. We are constantly adding more so be sure to check back often!"
