        "text": "Experience Haunted Season in Alton, Illinois\n\nA sordid past of murder, war, death and destruction has led to Altonâ€™s haunted present. Through the years, many travelers have investigated and inquired about the unexplained happenings and psychic phenomena found throughout Alton. Several locations that are noted to be extremely haunted, including the infamous McPike Mansion, The First Unitarian Church, and Milton School, have been featured on television shows on the Travel Channel and Syfy Channel. Mark Twain once referred to Alton, IL as a \"dismal little river town,\" but little did he know what more Alton was.\n\nThis small river town has now been named one of the most haunted small towns in America. Could this be because of the history of death, disease, violence, the Civil War, the Underground Railroad? Or has Alton simply been deemed one of the most haunted towns because of the ghosts and hauntings that occur regularly?\n\nThat's for you to decide on one of our Haunted Tours.\n\nReverand Phillip Mercer became a well-respected preacher at the Unitarian Church at the young age of 18. Moving here from England, he had a way of speaking in his sermons that made people from all over come to hear him preach.\n\nOne night in November of 1934, he found himself ill. Shaking and unable to speak properly, he went to visit a friend, James McKinney. After a few days of not seeing Mercer, McKinney went to the church to check on him. Mercer was found hanging in the doorway of the minister's study.\n\nSince the reverends death, there have been reports of voices and shadowy figures coming from the basement of the church. The piano seems to play itself sometimes and doors open and close with no explanation.\n\nMilton School\n\nThe Milton School House was built in 1904 and was up and running successfully until it's official close in 1986. This school served as the main school in Alton until its close. After the school shut down, it became a factory for Intaglio Design. Since then, other businesses that have taken up residence in this building.\n\nThe story of its haunting came about when the story of a little girl, Mary, started circulating the area. One day after school, Mary was finishing up a seasonal bulletin in her classroom while everyone else in the building had left for the day. As the sun started to go down she realized that she ought to get home before her mother worried about her. As she was skipping down the stairs towards the gymnasium doors, she heard a noise behind her.\n\nThe next morning, Mary was found in the girl's locker room battered with blood all over her and her torn up clothes.\n\nWhen Intaglio Design took over the building years ago, they noticed that there were weird happenings in the building. They heard footsteps, things started missing and then reappearing from the office, and one man even believes he saw the figure of a young girl. Was it Mary?\n\nFind out for yourself on a tour of Alton's most haunted school."
