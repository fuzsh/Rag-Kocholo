        "text": "Ghosts of Suicidal Fisherman and His Victim\n\nHaunt Wood Island Lighthouse in Maine\n\nOne of the best-known Maine lighthouse legends involves a true story about a murder-suicide at Wood Island Lighthouse from an altercation between a lobster fisherman, who was also a local sheriff living peacefully on the island, and a drunken resident who shot him, then shot himself.\n\nKeeper Thomas Orcutt was stationed at Wood Island lighthouse when Frederick Milliken, a lobster fisherman and part-time sheriff at Biddeford Pool near Biddeford in Maine, lived on Wood Island with his wife and three children. He was a rather sizeable, peaceful man in his thirties, known as the town’s “gentle giant.”\n\nTwo men who were drifters and part-time fishermen, Howard Hobbs and William Moses, persuaded Milliken to rent his chicken coop shack nearby for them to stay for a brief period. Both men had quite a drinking problem and, over the next few months, had not paid their rent to Milliken.\n\nOne summer day in June 1896, Hobbs and Moses returned to the island from a heavy drinking session on the mainland. Milliken found his neighbors wandering drunk on the island and told them to meet him at his house to discuss the issue of the overdue rent. Both men came to his house with Hobbs carrying a rifle in his arms and started arguing with Milliken, presumably about the overdue rent. Milliken tried to persuade Hobbs to hand over the weapon, but Hobbs claimed that his gun was not loaded as he waved it around. As Milliken reached to take it away, the gun fired and shot Milliken in the abdomen. Milliken’s wife, who was nearby, witnessed the event in horror, along with Hobbs’ friend Moses. As the two carried Milliken to his house, Hobbs followed, apologizing, still holding the gun in his arms.\n\nStill in a drunken daze, Hobbs ran off to the nearby keeper’s dwelling at Wood Island Lighthouse to get help from Keeper Orcutt, carrying the rifle. The wound proved fatal, and Milliken died less than an hour later. Keeper Thomas Orcutt then advised Hobbs to give himself up to the authorities. Hobbs instead announced that he had one bullet left, which he intended to use on himself, ran off to his shack, and shot himself in the head.\n\nHauntings at Wood Island Afterwards…\n\nSince the incident, many strange events have been reported over the years at Wood Island. Many believe both the ghosts of Hobbs and Milliken haunt Wood Island Lighthouse. Moans are still heard from the chicken coop shack, and locked doors have been mysteriously opened at the lighthouse. Dark shadows have been observed near the lighthouse walkway, at the top of the tower, and strange voices have also been heard. There have also been sightings of a woman believed to be Milliken’s wife.\n\nIn 1905, Keeper Charles Burke, stationed after Orcutt, was so distraught, believing he was seeing and hearing ghosts, that he left his post at Wood Island lighthouse unattended and stayed overnight in a boarding house on the mainland. The next day, he jumped from a window on the third floor to his death.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, the New England Ghost Project, a paranormal research team, was invited to investigate the island and lighthouse area. Shadowy figures were observed and recorded near the lighthouse and walkway. A medium was brought in, and the spirit, believed to be Hobbs, was apologizing through the medium’s trance. Another spirit, believed to be Milliken, made her feel as if he were severely injured and trying to escape something.\n\nRecently the Wood Island Lighthouse Foundation has held special events related to the hauntings to benefit the lighthouse restoration efforts.\n\nExploring Wood Island Light and Grounds\n\nThe lighthouse is located on Wood Island, and the beacon and surrounding grounds are maintained and operated by the Friends of Wood Island Light (FOWIL). For those who would like a narrated tour of the lighthouse and grounds, the “Friends” provide daily water shuttles to Wood Island during the summer months and will guide you to the other side of the island where the lighthouse is located. The lighthouse tower and keeper’s house have been nearly totally renovated to their original state in the early 20th century, thanks to the extensive efforts made by many volunteers and members of FOWIL over the years. Other special tours, like local ghost hunting tours, are also being offered to continue in raising funds for the restoration.\n\nVisitors can also take a narrated 2-hour tour by New England Eco Adventures along the coastline, providing a great water view of the beacon in a Navy S.E.A.L. Rigid Inflatable boat.\n\nHere are some of my favorite photos of Wood Island Light and area.\n\nThe Rise and Demise of the Largest Sailing Ships: Stories of the Six and Seven-Masted Coal Schooners of New England. In the early 1900s, New England shipbuilders constructed the world’s largest sailing ships amid social and political reforms. These giants were the ten original six-masted coal schooners and one colossal seven-masted vessel, built to carry massive quantities of coal and building supplies and measured longer than a football field! This book, balanced with plenty of color and vintage images, showcases the historical accounts that followed these mighty ships.\n\nAvailable in paperback, hardcover, and as an eBook for all devices.\n\nMy 300-page book, Lighthouses and Coastal Attractions of Southern New England: Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, provides memorable human interest stories from each of the 92 lighthouses, along with plenty of indoor and outdoor coastal attractions you can explore. These include whale-watching excursions, lighthouse tours, windjammer sailing tours and adventures, special parks and museums, and even lighthouses where you can stay overnight. You’ll also find plenty of stories of shipwrecks and rescues. Lighthouses and their nearby attractions are divided into regions for weekly and weekend explorers. You’ll also find plenty of stories of hauntings around lighthouses.\n\nMy 300-page book, Lighthouses and Coastal Attractions of Southern New England: Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, provides memorable human interest stories from each of the 76 lighthouses, along with plenty of indoor and outdoor coastal attractions you can explore and tours. Lighthouses and their nearby attractions are divided into regions for weekly and weekend explorers. Attractions and tours include whale watching, lighthouse tours, boat tours, windjammer sailing tours and adventures, unique parks and museums, and lighthouses you can stay overnight. There are also stories of haunted lighthouses in these regions, like the one mentioned around Wood Island Lighthouse.\n\nIncluded is the story of the murder/suicide at Wood Island Light and the hauntings heard afterwards, along with over 50 other stories in my book New England Lighthouses: Famous Shipwrecks, Rescues & Other Tales. This image-rich book also contains vintage images provided by the Coast Guard and various organizations and paintings by six famous artists of the Coast Guard.\n\nYou’ll find this book and the lighthouse tourism books from the publisher Schiffer Books or in many fine bookstores like Barnes and Noble.\n\nJoin, Learn, and Support The American Lighthouse Foundation\n\nFor more detailed info on any of my books, visit my Lighthouse Books page.\n\nCopyright © Allan Wood Photography, do not reproduce without permission.
