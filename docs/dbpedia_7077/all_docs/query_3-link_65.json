        "text": "But the UK is far from alone when it comes to spooky places to visit. So, where should you go to see some of the most haunted places in the world? These spooktacular destinations should definitely be on your bucket list.\n\nThe Tower of London\n\nBeyond its impressive architecture and buildings, the Tower of London is also one of London’s bloodiest execution sites and is said to be haunted by the ghosts of dozens of prisoners who were held in the Tower. The most famous of its ghostly residents is Anne Boleyn, former Queen of England and wife of King Henry VIII. Beheaded by order of the King in 1536, she has often been seen – sometimes without her head – on Tower Green and inside the chapel located within the White Tower.\n\nAradale Lunatic Asylum, Australia\n\nOpened in 1867 to accommodate the increasing number of so-called “lunatics” in Victoria, the asylum has been the site of an estimated 13,000 deaths. Particularly barbaric treatments, such as electroshock therapy and lobotomy, were frequently performed on-site. Given its brutal past, it should come as no surprise that visitors report hearing voices, seeing ethereal beings throughout the asylum and being overcome with nausea and dizziness. If you ever plan a trip to Victoria, add an adventure to the Aradale Lunatic Asylum to your bucket list.\n\nStirling Castle, Scotland\n\nOnce home to Scotland’s Kings and Queens, Stirling Castle is said to be haunted by several ghosts. Legend has it that a spectral Highlander more solid can be seen wearing full traditional attire wandering the castle grounds. Then there’s the Green Lady – the castle’s most feared ghost – who is considered a harbinger of bad events and an omen of misfortune.\n\nMoundsville Penitentiary, West Virginia\n\nThe Moundsville Penitentiary served as a correctional facility for over a century. It was usually the final stop for some of America’s most violent criminals, many of whom met their end here – usually hanging or the electric chair. It’s considered to be one of the most haunted prisons in the United States, with ghost stories originating as early as the 1930s.\n\nHoia-Baciu Forest, Romania\n\nForget Count Dracula and Bran Castle – Hoia-Baciu Forest is Transylvania’s most eerie site. A thin layer of mist blankets the forest floor and obscures the warped skeletal figures of ancient trees, while a deathly silence fills the air. Local legend says that spirits and ghosts lurk among the crooked trees, while a local shepherd, along with his flock of sheep, is said to have vanished within the woods.\n\nTangarakau, New Zealand\n\nThe widespread reports of hauntings in this town have earned it the nickname ‘Ghost Town’. You’ll find this secluded and more-or-less abandoned settlement in a section of the Forgotten World Highway on the North Island.\n\nBack in the railway and tunnelling days, 1,200 people resided in Tangarakau. Of course, with hazardous jobs come many unfortunate accidents, hence why this NZ town is considered the most haunted place in the nation.\n\nAnd for even more thrills this Halloween, we'd recommend immersion in the most haunted and creepiest streets of London, following the steps of the most infamous serial killer, Jack the Ripper. Join our Jack the Ripper Tour - if you dare!"
