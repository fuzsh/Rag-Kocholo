Believed to be a mistaken sighting of a nearby island.[7] Antillia c. 714/15th century The island, like the more popular Atlantis, is a fictional island in the Atlantic originating from an Iberian legend. Antonio d'Ulloa Island Unknown Discovered by the Spanish captain Antonio de Ulloa at 37° 02′ S, 78° 20′ W. Noted as doubtful in 1875.[7] Arthur Island Unknown Location given by Arrowsmith as 3° 30′ S, 176° W. Noted to be needing confirmation of existence and position in 1851; not seen on modern maps.[8] Atlantis c. 360 BC Ancient Greek legend described by Plato, later hypothesized to be real, and depicted on a 1664 map by Athanasius Kircher. Aurora Islands 1762 Discovered by Spanish merchant ship Aurora, currently thought to be just Shag Rocks. Bacalao 1472 Gaspar Frutuoso noted its discovery by João Vaz Corte-Real in 1472 in Saudades da Terra. Bale of Cotton 1767 A rock in the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, located at 5° 22′ N \"100 leagues east from Pointe de Galle.\" A passenger on the boat that saw the rock claimed to have physically gone onto it. Doubtful by 1817 and not seen on modern maps.[7] Bermeja 1539 Discovered in the early 16th century by Spain, but mysteriously vanished sometime during the 17th century. While no dominant theory holds, it is possible that the island submerged due to tectonic movements, supported by the existence of a seamount at and the nearby Scorpion Reef. Bonetta Rocks Unknown Location given as 16° 32′ N, 20° 57′ W, between Cape Verde and Mauritania. Could not be found in 1838.[7] Bradley Land 1909 A mass of land named by Frederick Cook which he claimed to have seen between ( ) and ( ) during a 1909 expedition. Brasil (or Hy-Brasil) 1325 Said to lie in the Atlantic Ocean west of Ireland. Irish myths described it as cloaked in mist except for one day every seven years, when it became visible but still could not be reached. Several 16th century maps showing the island of Brasil also showed an island labelled Demar further south-west. Saint Brendan's Island 512 Claimed to have been first visited in 512 by the monk St. Brendan and 14 others, along with later reports up to 1772. Britomart Island 1822 Discoverer unknown; location given as 19° 52' S, 145° 50' W. Noted to be doubtful in 1851; not seen on modern maps.[8] Buss Island 1578 Found in the waters near Greenland, in which Martin Frobisher, the leader of the island-finding expedition, probably made a mistake in dead reckoning and mistook optical effects near Greenland for a new island. Island of California 1510 A misconception about the Baja California Peninsula being an island due to an assumption that the Gulf of California was instead a strait separating California from the rest of the Americas. Cassiterides 430 BC Ancient source of Phoenician tin. Exact location unknown but thought to have possibly referred to now silt-connected islands within the marshes of Brière. Clark's Reef Unknown Discoverer unknown, location given as 8° 18′ S, 139° 50′ (or 52′) W. Admiral Du Petit Thouars could not find the reef, sounding 200 fathoms.[8] Cloate's Island Unknown Location given as 21° 30′ S, 92° 42′ E, west of Australia. Removed from charts by 1856 or earlier.[7] Crockerland 1906 A hoax invented by Arctic explorer Robert E. Peary to gain more financial aid from George Crocker, one of his financial backers. Davis Land 1687 Supposedly sighted by the pirate Edward Davis in the Pacific along the southern latitude of 27 to 28 degrees, which was on the same latitude as the Spanish-controlled gold mines of Copiago. At the time, it was believed that gold could be found elsewhere along the latitude so several navigators were instructed to seek it out on their voyages. Never found, it was also believed by William Dampier to be the coast of Terra Australis Incognita.[9] Isle of Demons 1508 Probably a relocated version of the island of Satanazes (see island below). Denia/Davia Unknown Location given as 41° or 42° S, 20° E, in close vicinity of Marzeveen/Maarseveen. Not seen on modern maps.[7] Diego Alvarez Unknown Location given as 39° 10′ S, 11° 15′ W, between Tristan da Cunha and Gough. Not seen on modern maps.[7] Dougherty Island 1841 Because it is near Antarctica, it is likely that the discoverer, Captain Dougherty, and future explorers who confirmed it, saw fog banks and icebergs conveniently situated in the right place and time. Dragon Island 1869 Reported by Capt. Andrew of the bark Dragon at 24° 30′ N, 136° 36′ W. Found nonexistent in 1875.[7] Dunkin's Reef 1824 Discovered by Dunkin; location given as 9° 50′ N, 154° 10′ E. Described as an extensive shoal. Noted as doubtful and possibly a mistaken sighting in 1851; not seen on modern maps.[8] Elizabeth Island 1578 Described by Francis Drake, who reported harbouring there during his circumnavigation. Not found by subsequent explorers; in 1939 Felix Riesenberg suggested Pactolus Bank as a possible remnant, though recent surveys suggest the Bank may itself be a phantom feature. Emerald Island 1821 Probably fog banks and icebergs (see Dougherty Island above); the abyssal plain below it was named Emerald Plain, however, in recognition of the nonexistent island. Emily Rock 1869 Sighted at 25° 38' S, 87° 25' W by the bark Emily. Reportedly measured to be 15' tall and 120' long. 2 other sightings were reported in 1873, now described as being 3/4th mile long and 20 feet at its tallest point, made of sandy volcanic stone. Several vessels passed through the area but did not see it.[10] Ernest Legouve Reef 1902 A reef supposedly found by the captain of the French ship, Ernest Legouvé, which is near the exact location of the fictional Lincoln Island, the main setting for Jules Verne's book The Mysterious Island, also appearing in In Search of the Castaways. Estotiland 1558 An island appearing on the Zeno map at the current location of Labrador. Faith Island Unknown Location given as 21° 10′ S, 138° 52′ W, in the Tuamotus. Believed to be a mistaken sighting of a nearby island.[7] Fata Morgana Land 1907 J.P. Koch, together with Aage Bertelsen, was reported to have first seen Fata Morgana Land (Danish: Fata Morgana Landet) lying in the Arctic Ocean around 80°00´N 10°00´W between NE Greenland and Svalbard. This elusive land was allegedly seen as well by Lauge Koch from the air in 1933.[11] Filippo Reef 1886 This reef, part of the Line Islands, was first seen by the ship Filippo and was seen again in 1926 when both ships saw breakers in the same area, suggesting a depth of 0.6 to 0.9 metres (2 to 3 feet). Current observations show the reported location to have a depth of 5.3 kilometres (3.3 miles; 2.9 nautical miles), and the nearest shallow seamount is about 4.7 kilometres (2.9 miles; 2.5 nautical miles) deep, disproving the existence of the island. Fonseca Island 1544 An island sighted east of Barbados. Frisland 1558 Another island on the Zeno map, possibly a renamed Iceland. Ganges Island 20th century A nonexistent island off the coast of Japan to the southwest of the Shatsky Rise. Isle Grande 1675 Discovered by Antonio de la Roche. Roche only passed the island on its eastern side. Various locations given, all at 45° 15′ S, but otherwise differing at 38° 15′ W (per la Roche), 45° 30′ W, and 35° 30′ W; considered uncertain by 1808. Possibly a mistaken sighting of a projecting headland from South America, as la Roche never saw the other side.[7] Groclant 1569 An island to the west of Greenland, perhaps a misreading of the island's name, or Baffin Island. Humphrey Island 1822 Discoverer unknown; location given as 16° 52' S, 140° 30' W. Krusenstern doubted its existence and was noted as doubtful in 1851; not seen on modern maps.[8] Hyperborea Antiquity to 17th century Hypothetic land of a mythical people living in the far north of the known world, depicted as the mirror continent of Antarctica on the Mercator map Ilha de Vera Cruz 1500 A supposed 'island' found by Portuguese explorers, which turned out not to be an island but rather what is currently known as Brazil. Jacquet Island Middle Ages An island just to the east of the Flemish Cap; it was believed to exist into the 19th century, during which cartographers discussed it as a possible midway point for the Transatlantic telegraph cable. Juan de Lisboa 17th century Reported on maps as being southeast of Madagascar. Jupiter Reef 1878 Nonexistent reef in the Line Islands (in fact Line Islands are more than 3,200 kilometres (2,000 miles; 1,700 nautical miles) away), to the south of the also nonexistent Ernest Legouve Reef (see above). Kantia 1884 Found in 1884 by Johan Otto Polter, who, in four later expeditions through 1909, disproved the island's existence. Keenan Land 1870s Large landmass reportedly discovered in the Arctic north of Alaska; numerous searches failed to relocate it. Kentzell's Island 1856 Reported by Capt. Kentzell of San Francisco at approx. 40° N, 150° 30′ W. The island, 20 miles long and \"very low,\" was said to have a large seal and sea elephant population, and therefore was kept secret by seal hunters. Searches failed to find it while sightings still came in through the 1860s, including one by the Kanrin Maru in 1859. Finally disproven by a survey in 1867.[7] Kettendyk's Droogte Unknown Location given as 33° S, 4° 25′ E, northeast of Tristan da Cunha and west of South Africa. Unsuccessfully searched for, and not seen on modern maps.[7] Kianida Island\n\nor Cianeis Insula 1467 Supposedly known in Antiquity, a large island the size of Thassos but situated off the Black Sea coast of Thrace in the present Bulgaria-Turkey border area. Depicted on the 1467 map Nona Europae Tabula by Nicolaus Germanus based on Claudius Ptolemy's Geography.[12] According to Bulgarian geomorphologist Dinyo Kanev, probably destroyed by sea in the Middle Ages.[13] Krusenstern Rock 1804 Reported as a breaker at 22° 15' N, 175° 37' W. Capt. R. Suffern of the Craigerne reported that he was at these exact coordinated in 1897 but there was no sign of the rock.[14] L'Enfants Perdu Islands 1768 Discovered by Bougainville, variously placed at 14° 16′ S, 177° 23′ W or 14° 20′ S, 176° 40′ W. Found doubtful in 1875 after searches found no land in the area. Possibly a mistaken sighting of the Horne Islands.[7] Los Jardines 1528 A pair of phantom islands to the east of the Marshall Islands. Isle of Mam 1367 A crescent-shaped island in the North Atlantic that does not appear to exist; however, there is a crescent-shaped group of seamounts 37 metres (120 feet) deep near its described location. Jane Island Unknown Location given as 16° 10′ N, 173° 15′ W. Could not be found in 1841, and the island being a mistaken sighting of Johnston Atoll was ruled out due to latitude. Not seen on modern maps.[7] Jesus Island 1567 Reported by Mendaña at 6° 45′ S, 171° 30′ E. Krusenstern doubted its existence and it was noted as doubtful in 1851; not seen on modern maps.[8] Marzeveen/Maarseveen Unknown Location given as 41° or 42° S, 20° E, in close vicinity of Denia/Davia. Not seen on modern maps.[7] María de Lajara or Maria Laxar 17th century Usually located northeast from Hawaii, but perhaps originally one of the Bonin Islands. Maria Theresa Reef (aka Tabor Island or Tabor Reef) 1843 Another nonexistent reef in the Line Islands (in fact Line Islands are more than 3,200 kilometres (2,000 miles; 1,700 nautical miles) away), slightly to the southwest-west of the phantom island, Jupiter Reef. It is a setting for Jules Verne's book In Search of the Castaways. Maria Rock Unknown Location given as 19° 45′ N, 20° 50′ W, off of Mauritania. Could not be found in 1838.[7] Maury Island Unknown Location given as 27° S, 95° 06′ W. Not seen on modern maps, but could not be located on any historical maps either.[7] Merrill Island 1832 Reported by Captain Harding Merrill of the Comboy at 16′ 38° S, 141′ W. Reportedly inhabited by people resembling Hawaiians. Noted doubtful in 1851; not seen on modern maps.[8] Minnehaha Rock 1879 Sighted by Capt. Beckwith of the Victoria at 25° 50' S, 106° 20' W. No subsequent sightings have been made.[10] Nameless Island Unknown Discoverer unknown; location given as 2° 50′ S, 170° 18′ E. Noted as doubtful in 1851; not seen on modern maps.[8] New York and Nexsen Islands 1798 Reported by a Mr. Fanning on the Betsy at 8° 9′ S, 141° 30.5′ W based on location seven hours after sighting. Smoke noted, suggesting inhabitants. Observed from four to six leagues away and not approached. Suspected in 1851 to be a mistaken sighting of two nearby islands; not seen on modern maps.[8] St. Elmo 1606 Reported by Quiros, location 21° 20' S, 143° 50' W. Said to be low, surrounded by coral reefs, with a 30 Spanish leagues circumference. Noted as doubtful in 1851; not seen on modern maps.[8] St. Matthew Island 1516 An island near the coast of Africa, roughly 1,000 kilometres (620 miles; 540 nautical miles) east-northeast of Ascension Island and possibly confused with the same latitude Annobón Island. Mount Penglai Antiquity An island thirty-thousand leagues to the east off the coast of Shandong. Associated with numerous East Asian myths and legends. Nachtegal Rock 1861 Seen by HMS Sphinx at 40° 20′ S, 52° 55′ E. Last seen in charts in 1878.[7] New Badalgo Unknown Location given as 18° 15′ N, 143° 40′ W. Not seen on modern maps.[7] New South Greenland 1823 Unknown odd island near Antarctica, which captain Benjamin Morrell of the ship Wasp saw while traveling north from Antarctica. He thought it to be the Antarctic Peninsula (then called New South Greenland), but his reported location during the voyage, while perfectly copying the expected path for traveling up the peninsula, was over 500 kilometres (310 miles; 270 nautical miles) to the east and 97 kilometres (60 miles; 52 nautical miles) to the north of the actual position of the Antarctic Peninsula, suggesting either a huge miscalculation in location or sightings of icebergs and fog, typical of phantom islands in the Antarctic Circle. Nimrod Islands 1828 A group of islands between Emerald Island and Dougherty Island, both of which are nonexistent. Probably a group of icebergs together. Pactolus Bank 1885 An oceanic bank 120 metres (400 feet) deep off the west coast of Cape Horn, suggested as the remains of Elizabeth Island. A 1956 search of the area turned up no shallow areas in the reported location. Passion/Paxarus Island Unknown Location given as 25° 48′ N, 136° 36′ W or 26° 12′ N, 136° W. No sign of the island could be find in 1873.[7] Pepys Island 1683 In 1683, Ambrose Cowley reported an unknown island where he thought the Falklands were, but his location was 4 degrees to the north of the Falkland Islands. While it is possible that he made a mistake in seeing a nonexistent island, it is more likely he saw one of the Falkland Islands and made a 4-degree error in his location. Petermannland Between 1860 and 1874 North of Franz Josef Land, named after August Heinrich Petermann. Isle Phelipeaux 1744 A nonexistent island in Lake Superior referenced in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. Podesta 1879 An island 1,390 kilometres (860 miles; 750 nautical miles) to the west of El Quisco, Chile, that was discovered to be fake in 1935 and promptly removed. Other phantom islands were also found in the vicinity in 1912 and 1858 (see Sarah Ann Island). Polvaro Island 1505 Usually placed at or near 9° 20′ S, 89° E. Reportedly discovered after a Portuguese ship withdrawing from Malacca to Cape Comorin was lost nearby. Sometimes called Apaluria; sighted into the 18th century. Said to be low, woody, eight to 10 miles long. Absence noted in 1866; allegedly \"exploded.\"[7] Recreation Island Unknown Location given as 15° 35′ S, 150° W, north of Tahiti. Position passed over with no sign of land, removed in 1864.[7] Reed/Redfield Rocks 1850 First sighting reported by Capt. Reed of the brig Emma at 37° 24′ N, 137° 22′ W in the Shipping Gazette. Mores sightings were made in varying locations in 1851, 1856, and 1866. They were said to be two rocks, 600–900 feet long and 50–40 feet across, under 3–5 fathoms of water and breakers in rough weather. Four surveys from 1871 to 1875 could not find them, but another sighting in 1889 said they were now four feet above the water. Another survey in 1902 disproved their existence, but were still marked on maps as doubtful.[7] Rivadeneyra Shoal 1842 A shoal in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Ilha dos Romeiros Unknown Location given as 28° 40′ S, 74° E, between Madagascar and Australia. Removed from charts by 1856 or earlier.[7] Roque Piz 1649 First seen in a chart by João Teixeora, located at 6° S, 60° E. Seen on maps as late as 1865, described as being three flat islands. Likely a mistaken sighting of the Seychelles or Chagos.[7] Royal Company's Islands Before 1840 A fictional island widely believed during the 19th century to be to the southwest of Tasmania. While not found by numerous expeditions in 1840, 1889, 1902, 1909, and 1912, the island was not officially removed from nautical charts until 1904. Royllo 1424 A small island to the west of the mythical Antillia (see Antillia above). Rupes Nigra 14th century A magnetic, black island at the exact Magnetic North Pole, invented as an explanation for why all compasses point north. Sandy Island 1774 Another phantom, small island to the west of New Caledonia that was recorded on many maps until 2012, when a surveying ship passed by and disproved its existence. The current leading explanation is that the island was a raft of buoyant pumice from a recent nearby seamount eruption. Sannikov Land 1809 An island near the De Long Islands, north of Russia, that probably did exist but was destroyed due to coastal erosion. Sarah Ann Island 1858 A phantom island near Easter Island, similar to Podesta island. See Operational Navigation Chart of the United States Department of Defense. Satanazes 1424 This island was originally noted on maps in 1424, originating from popular legend of devils and demons attacking ships that went into the area, but the island was subsequently removed because it obviously did not exist. The island, often drawn to the north of the mythical Antillia, was purportedly full of evil demons but was sometimes called Salvaga to avoid using the profanity \"devil\". Saxemberg Island 1670 An odd island midway between South America and Africa that numerous captains reported seeing in 1804, 1809, and 1816. While most had conflicting reports, all of them found the island in the same location; however, none of them actually made landfall. It is possible the island was volcanic and later erupted and destroyed itself. It is also possible that they were looking at Tristan de Cunha island. Sefton Reef 1808 Approx. 83°W, 37°S (southwest of Robinson Crusoe Island), noted as \"position doubtful\" in Operational Navigation Chart[15] of the United States Department of Defense. Terra Nova Islands 1961 Thought to lie off Oates Coast, East Antarctica. Thompson Island 1825 An island in the south Atlantic Ocean discovered by the whaling ship captain George Norris; it has not been seen since 1893. Thule 325 BC A mythical island in the far north, possibly at or above the Arctic Circle, mentioned in many works from the Roman and Medieval period. Sources in antiquity placed Thule several days travel north of Great Britain[16] visible from Orkney;[17] or north of Scythia.[18] More modern scholars have suggested Thule may have been Ireland;[19] the Estonian island of Saaremaa;[20] or the Norwegian island of Smøla.[21] Tiburones Unknown Captain D'Urville asked the residents of Uapoa about this island in August 1838. They claimed it existed, reporting it had high land, one sandy beach which could be approached in good weather, and a single male inhabitant (the others having fled). Location given as 11° S, 143° W; noted doubtful in 1851 and not seen on modern maps.[8] Torca Island 1693 A mythical island near Ambon in the Indonesia purportedly destroyed by a volcanic eruption. Transit Reef 18th century A possible reef in Southern Palau. While this reef probably exists, some maps do not list it as an actual location, and, although the reef doesn't have any land, the native name of the island, Pieraurou, means 'Sandy Navigation Point', implying a sandy island or sand bar. Truls Island 1962 Reported by the tanker Truls at 56° S, 23° 15′ E. Marked on USHO Chart 5188B in October 1969 as \"ED\" (existence doubtful).[7] Tuanaki 1842 A vanished group of islets in the Cook Islands at which a sailor allegedly spent 6 days, but a ship traveling in the waters two years later found no island.
