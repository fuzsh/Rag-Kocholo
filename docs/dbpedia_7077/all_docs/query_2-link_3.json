Here are the scariest, spookiest and irrefutably creepiest spots on 10 haunted islands.\n\nDunvegan Castle, located on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, is rumored to be haunted by ghosts. | Shutterstock\n\nIt's that time of year when everything creepy is cool, scary tales go viral and the more haunted a hotel or house is the better. But think about this: If that spooky place overrun by the spirits of the not-so-dearly departed is on an island — and you're surrounded by miles and miles of water — where you gonna go, who you gonna call? So if you love a good fright, consider a visit to these 10 haunted islands, where it doesn't have to be Halloween for ghosts to taunt you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated: 3 Ghost Tours in the Caribbean"
