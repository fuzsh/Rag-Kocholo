        "text": "The ghost of a woman scorned, a slave cook and a servant boy are said to hang around 17 Hundred 90 Inn and Restaurant, haunting guests and diners alike. While dining at the restaurant, you may hear the cook banging on pots in the kitchen or see a glimpse of a little servant boy. If you stay at the inn, you might spot Anna, one of the most famous ghost-girls in the city who haunts the upstairs guest rooms waiting for the return of her lost love. Learn more about hauntings at 17 Hundred 90 in this video.\n\nOnce a saloon and rest stop for seafarers from abroad, The Pirates’ House still stands today as one of Savannah’s most well-known restaurants. However, The Pirates’ House can’t escape its dark past. Many were brutishly shanghaied down in the boarding house basement and forced to serve on the sea. There are many secrets to be discovered at this world famous site – some you’re sure to learn about over dinner. Learn more about hauntings at The Pirates’ House in this video.\n\nThe Kehoe family consisted of 10 children, and rumor has it that two of them died in the house. Although the rumor is completely unsubstantiated, many guests say they encountered ghost children during their overnight stays. Also, before becoming a beautiful bed and breakfast, the Kehoe House was a funeral home. So, is the Kehoe House haunted? We dare you to stay a night and see for yourself!"
