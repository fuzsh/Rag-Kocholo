        "text": "Bored with Top 100 Classic Rock Songs lists that are dominated by the same handful of artists? We put a twist on that: You'll still find all of the expected legends on the below list, from Aerosmith to ZZ Top, but each artist gets only one song each.\n\nThink of it as a high-stakes game, as everybody puts his best hand on the table.\n\nWe've already anticipated the questions: \"Was the right song chosen to represent each artist or band?\" \"Was that song slotted in its proper place?\"\n\nOf course, this means that all but one song from even the most legendary artists won't be represented here. Even after allowing 100 different artists onto the list, there were still dozens of \"How can so-and-so not be included?\" arguments that surfaced as we pulled this all together.\n\nSo, yeah, this wasn't easy.\n\nThe below list of the Top 100 Classic Rock Songs may start a lot of fights (it did around here at the UCR office), but it's also the start of one hell of a playlist.\n\n100: Sammy Hagar, \"I Can't Drive 55\"\n\nWho better to get our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list off to a fast start than Sammy Hagar and his anti-speed limit anthem, \"I Can't Drive 55?\"\n\nNearly a decade of constant touring and increasing record sales – remember \"Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy?\" – had already established Hagar as a rock star prior to the release of his 1984 VOA album.\n\nBut the Red Rocker really hit a nerve with the message of the record's first single, which – aided by a truly entertaining video – quickly made him a household name and bona-fide arena headliner.\n\nWe're not saying Hagar was directly responsible for the late-'80s national law changes that allowed states to once again set speed limits higher than 55, but it certainly couldn't have hurt. This new level of fame also paved the way for him to join Van Halen in 1985.\n\n\"I Can't Drive 55,\" as Hagar has explained many times, was inspired by a real-life incident that found him pulled over for doing 62 late at night on an empty highway in upstate New York. We're guessing record sales from this song have paid for that ticket many times over by now.\n\n99: Kansas, \"Carry On Wayward Son\"\n\nThe now-familiar a capella intro for \"Carry On Wayward Son\" was the sonic hook that would help Kansas score their first major hit, a feat that was a long time coming for the band.\n\nLike many groups in the time period, Kansas toured and recorded relentlessly, supporting three albums that sold modestly despite their growing live following. Taking a short breather to record what would become their fourth album, 1976's Leftoverture, frontman Steve Walsh ran into writer’s block.\n\nLuckily, guitarist Kerry Livgren was overflowing creatively with ideas and he still had one song that he hadn’t shared with the band. Once the members heard the initial idea for \"Carry On Wayward Son,\" they knew the songwriting gold that they had on hand and went straight into the recording studio without even pausing to rehearse the track.\n\nNext to some of the proggier moments on Leftoverture, \"Carry On Wayward Son\" feels comparatively restrained and compact, even though it stretches out across nearly five and a half minutes.\n\nLivgren’s engaging storyline of a man embattled with the voices and visions in his head is driven forward by guitar riffing, organ swells and solos from nearly every member in the band. The story might be slightly turbulent, but the music certainly jams.\n\n98: Scorpions, \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\"\n\nSince its release in 1984, the Scorpions’ \"‘Rock You Like a Hurricane\" has become ubiquitous. It's been championed by The Simpsons, college football teams and a Dave Eggers novel.\n\n\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" propelled the German metal band’s Love at First Sting album into the Billboard Top 10, although the song itself only hit No. 25 on the singles chart.\n\nIn terms of ’80s metal classics, however, the tune is the Platonic ideal: a headbanging-worthy repeating riff, gigantic drums, a ripping solo and an indelible refrain — sing it now — \"Here I am, rock you like a hurricane.\"\n\nAlthough the official video is full of ’80s clichés (women dressed as animals, actual zoo animals, absurd sci-fi flourishes), the campy edge of the music never overshadows the ferocious nature of the song. Heck, \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" even sounds badass when interpreted by an orchestra: Just try to stop yourself from fist-pumping while watching this video of the band performing with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n97: Electric Light Orchestra, \"Don't Bring Me Down\"\n\nElectric Light Orchestra's 1979 smash \"Don't Bring Me Down\" may just be Jeff Lynne's most concise and representative musical statement.\n\nYou can hear a Jeff Lynne song from a couple miles down the road: It's all in the bass drum. That magnificent, booming sound that's graced records by Tom Petty (\"Running Down a Dream\"), Roy Orbison (\"You Got It\"), even the Beatles (\"Free as a Bird\").\n\n\"Don't Bring Me Down\" has got those drums, and oddly enough, that's about all it has. The song represents the first time the band released a track without strings, and by the Electric Light Orchestra's ornate arrangement standards, it's positively rudimentary.\n\nRecorded in Munich during sessions for ELO's 1979 Discovery LP, \"Don't Bring Me Down\" emerged almost whole cloth from Lynne, who wrote the tune on piano and immediately moved to complete the backing track on his own, using a slowed-down drum tape from a previous song to create the tune's trademark beat. It's unknown if any other members of ELO even played on the track.\n\nThat makes it pure, vintage Lynne in a way that maybe no other ELO hit can claim. And while the Electric Light Orchestra counted plenty among its membership over the years, from its second album onward, the band acted largely as a musical-auteur vehicle for Lynne's gifted songwriting and arranging skills.\n\n\"Don't Bring Me Down\" was by far the band's biggest smash, peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 in the UK; it also charted highly in Canada and Australia. As of November 2007, the track had logged a whopping two million radio airplays according to BMI. After \"Evil Woman,\" \"Mr. Blue Sky\" and \"Livin' Thing\" have faded into history, \"Don't Bring Me Down\" may stand as Lynne's greatest recorded legacy.\n\n96: Molly Hatchet, \"Flirtin' With Disaster\"\n\nThe triple-guitar attack of Jacksonville’s Molly Hatchet takes our list on the ultimate search and destroy mission, challenging the eardrum health of rock music fans everywhere via \"Flirtin’ With Disaster.\"\n\nLike a flash flood of boulders tumbling down a mountain, \"Flirtin’\" storms the castle with big, burly badass Danny Joe Brown at the helm, manipulating the musical landscape with his distinctively boisterous lead vocals, which to this day are instantly identifiable.\n\n\"Flirtin’ With Disaster\" is a road song in the tradition of similar great songs of its ilk, telling the tale of living fast, living hard and flying way too close to the edge. Out of money? Check. Corruption? Check. Feeling like perhaps a change of course might be a good idea? Check.\n\nBrown and Molly Hatchet cover it all at a blistering pace and sadly, the story seems to foreshadow Brown’s own health problems, which would force him to depart the group in 1980.\n\nAlthough he would return to the Molly Hatchet lineup, further health issues caused him to leave again prior to his sad passing in 2005. A revised version of Molly Hatchet continues to make music today proving that they’re still a force to be reckoned with.\n\n95. Styx, \"Renegade\"\n\nThe jig is up, the news is out, you've finally found Styx on our big countdown. If you guessed \"Renegade,\" you've got it made, you've earned a big bounty!\n\nThe third single from the band's 1978 smash album Pieces of Eight tells the tale of a captured law-breaker who realizes that his crimes and karma are about to catch up with him.\n\nIt was written by guitarist Tommy Shaw, who told us in 2011 that he's delighted with the long life the song has enjoyed thanks to constant radio play, as well as placement on movie and TV soundtracks including Billy Madison and Freaks and Geeks.\n\nIf this list was strictly about those classic rock songs performed at football games, it would undoubtedly rank much higher. As Shaw explained back then, the Pittsburgh Steelers \"have been using ‘Renegade’ as their defensive rally song for 12 years now.\"\n\nAlthough he's quick to admit he's not the biggest sports fan, Shaw marvels at the impact the song has on the massive crowds: \"I have stood there in one of the boxes and looked out and seen 80,000 people waving the Terrible Towels while ‘Renegade’ is playing on the big screen. ... It’s a very welcoming environment for me.\"\n\n94: Blind Faith, \"Can't Find My Way Home\"\n\nAn unprecedented and arguably unmatched collection of talent and rock stardom, Blind Faith land at the No. 94 spot on our list with the haunting \"Can't Find My Way Home.\"\n\nWith both Traffic and Cream disbanded, Steve Winwood and Eric Clapton joined forces, bringing along another ex-Cream member Ginger Baker as well as Ric Grech from the incredible, though relatively obscure group Family.\n\nTheir legacy amounted to only one studio album, but the strength of its songs and performances have made it a lasting favorite for rock fans. Recorded during the first half of 1969, Clapton, Winwood and Baker all contributed songs to the project, but this classic from the Traffic frontman stands out as the definitive statement.\n\nThe beautiful and plaintive ballad finds Winwood's sweet vocal floating atop the intricate acoustic guitar work, while bassist Grech and drummer Baker provide subtle but effective rhythms to drive it along. Jimmy Miller's warm and inviting production helps make the song all the more essential.\n\nThe album topped both the U.K. and U.S. charts upon its release in August 1969. The controversial cover art, featuring a very young topless girl holding the hood ornament from a 1956 Chevrolet didn't hurt sales either, as sad as that might sound.\n\nClapton went on to his successful solo career, Traffic eventually reformed, and both Baker and Grech continued on, but this one-off collaboration still shines brightly.\n\n93: George Thorogood, \"Bad to the Bone\"\n\nGeorge Thorogood and the Destroyers have a penchant for rockin' covers of all kinds of blues songs, but the band is probably best known for a song George wrote himself: \"Bad to the Bone.\"\n\nIt didn't get much attention when it was released on the 1982 album of the same name, but MTV liked it and put the video for the track into heavy rotation.\n\nThe clip features a live performance by the Destroyers along with scenes of a cigar-chomping Thorogood shooting pool with Bo Diddley, and that may not have been happenstance: George is known for covering Diddley's \"Who Do You Love?,\" and music lovers have pointed out the guitar riff and vocal rhythms in \"Bad to the Bone\" sound like they were inspired by the iconic bluesman's classic song, \"I'm a Man.\"\n\nMTV helped \"Bad to the Bone\" catch fire, and it's since been licensed out to scores of movies, TV shows and commercials. It's also played at sporting events all over the country, and several professional wrestlers have adopted it as their theme song. While this isn't exactly as bad-ass, the song was also introduced to a much younger generation when Alvin and the Chipmunks covered it for an episode of their television series.\n\nBut even though 'Bad to the Bone' was his greatest commercial success, the Thorogood isn't terribly interested in writing another song about hard-drinking tough guys. \"I've covered that subject,\" he once said in a 2008 interview. \"It was never a dominating idea in my repertoire to begin with. It just happened that way. People will say, 'I got this great song about a real bad guy in a bar,' and I go, 'I think the world has enough songs like that.'\"\n\n92. Grand Funk Railroad, \"We're an American Band\"\n\nEasy to forget nowadays but, in their heyday, Grand Funk Railroad ruled the roost, selling tons of albums and concert tickets. \"We're an American Band\" remains their most iconic song in a long list of classics, and our clear choice for inclusion in this list.\n\nWritten by drummer/vocalist Don Brewer, this tale of the life of a rock group on the road connected with fans and gave them their first huge hit single. Prior to \"American Band,\" Grand Funk were primarily an album-oriented band. This single would change that.\n\nSome credit must go to producer Todd Rundgren, who gave Grand Funk a push in the right direction, with just the proper amount of gloss to make the power trio (now actually a foursome with the addition of keyboardist Craig Frost) a bit more radio-friendly. It worked, earning the band their first No. 1 single and helping the album of the same name sail to No. 2 on the Billboard chart.\n\nThis would be the first of a string of hit singles for Brewer, Mark Farner, Mel Schacher and Frost, and to this day is the song most associated with the mighty Grand Funk Railroad.\n\n91: .38 Special, \"Hold On Loosely\"\n\nWith \"Hold On Loosely,\" .38 Special and Survivor's Jim Peterik, who co-wrote the song, captured an emotional tug of war that was instantly identifiable to every single walking, raging pack of hormones who was alive in the ‘80s, both male and female. They also earned a spot on our list.\n\nThe situation: You meet that amazing person and fall hard, really hard, for them. So of course from that point forward, you have to make sure that they are aware of your undying love for them, each and every day. The next steps that follow: They either advise you that they’ve taken out a restraining order, or if they’re mellower about things, they just let you know that it would probably be a good idea to back off for a while.\n\nSo, rather than get too serious right off the bat, vocalist Don Barnes shares the sage advice given to him by a “girl I left some years ago,” who told him, “Just hold on loosely / But don’t let her go / If you cling too tightly / You’re gonna lose control.”\n\nDon’t get nuts. Just give her that “space to breathe in” and everything will work out just fine.\n\n\"Hold On Loosely,\" the lead track on the band's fourth album, 1981's Wild Eyed Southern Boys, helped create the mold for a string of easy-going hits that the .38 members and Peterik would craft together with similar chart success. Peterik continued to write with the band, working closely on their 2004 studio album Drivetrain.\n\n90: Ram Jam, \"Black Betty\"\n\nTheir lead singer and guitarist played with the Lemon Pipers, of \"Green Tambourine\" fame. The rest of the band members never even played on this highly offbeat entry on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list. Welcome to the wild and crazy story that is \"Black Betty\" by Ram Jam.\n\nOnce the Lemon Pipers dissolved, guitarist Bill Bartlett formed a new band called Starstruck with two fellow Pipers. A later incarnation of that band (Bartlett was the lone remaining Lemon Piper by this time) recorded a rock version of Leadbelly's interpretation of the traditional work song \"Black Betty,\" and released it on their own label.\n\nThe song was a regional hit, and caught the attention of a couple of New York producers, who re-packaged Bartlett with a new group of musicians and christened them Ram Jam. The song was a huge hit out of the box, reaching No. 18 in the U.S. while climbing into the Top 10 in Australia and Bartlett's native England.\n\nListening to the song today, it's hard not to look back fondly at what was a much simpler time in the music industry, because this kind of song will never, ever happen again. It begins with a thunderous kick drum, some rafter-shaking riffs by Bartlett, and that unforgettable \"Whoa, black Betty, bam-ba-lam\" vocal. At this point, the song sounds like a slightly glammier \"Mississippi Queen\" (check those synth washes), the kind of track that would rock a concert hall and pack a dancefloor.\n\nNo one could have suspected, then, that the band would veer hard right at the 1:30 mark and launch into an Allman Brothers-fueled freakout. A two-minute freakout, in a song a little less than four minutes long, no less. There are also no less than three moments where an audible splice of the master tape can be heard. As we said, simpler times.\n\nAt the same time, one cannot overlook Ram Jam's raw enthusiasm, which rose above the seemingly disparate influences to create the kind of song that challenges at least one artist every decade or so to improve upon it, though to date, no one has come close.\n\n89: John Cougar, \"Jack & Diane\"\n\nWhen summertime hits, or when you'd like to pretend it's here, there’s no better song to revisit (and blast in the car at top volume) than 'Jack & Diane.\"\n\nReleased when John Mellencamp was still recording under the name John Cougar, it remains his biggest hit single after spending four weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. In fact, the song was a major reason why 1982’s American Fool finally made Cougar a household name.\n\n\"Jack & Diane\" endures because of its longing for a simpler time. The titular lovestruck teenagers live in a small town where “sucking on chili dogs / outside the Tastee Freeze” is an ideal date – and enough to make the big city seem unappealing. These lyrics are tempered by the perspective of an outside observer — ostensibly someone looking back many years later – who gently notes: “Hold on to 16 as long as you can / Changes come around real soon / Make us women and men.”\n\nThe song’s instrumentation and arrangement perpetuate this nostalgic vibe. Mellencamp’s long-time backing band — guitarists Mike Wanchic and Larry Crane, drummer Kenny Aronoff, bassist Robert Frank and keyboardist Eric Rosser — exhibit deft restraint. Handclaps, splattering percussion, sparse acoustic strumming and faded piano dominate, save for a bridge with soul-infused gang vocals. (According to Mellencamp, guitarist/backing vocalist Mick Ronson gets credit for helping this interlude gel.)\n\nAmerican Fool also helped cement another fruitful collaboration: It was the second album Cougar worked on with producer Don Gehman, and its success lead to a musical relationship which spanned from 1983's Uh-Huh and 1985's Scarecrow to 1987's The Lonesome Jubilee. Because of his work with Mellencamp, Gehman earned a reputation for having a masterful touch with folk-tinged pop music, which led to collaborations with such stars as R.E.M.\n\nAbove all, the universal themes of \"Jack & Diane\" – the exuberance of puppy love and the sense that being young lasts forever — still resonate today.\n\n88: Yes, \"Roundabout\"\n\nFrom the dramatic fade in, classical-style guitar riff and thundering bass on through that earth-shaking climax, Yes' \"Roundabout\" is a masterpiece, and one of the prime slabs of progressive rock ever recorded.\n\nThe lead track from Yes's fourth album, 1971's Fragile, its power and glory haven't diminished since its release. Though the band had made great strides in reaching a wider audience with their third release, The Yes Album, Fragile took them to the upper regions of the rock world.\n\nThe album was the first to feature new keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who joined the already-incredible musical ensemble of Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Bill Bruford and Jon Anderson. Released at the height of the progressive-rock movement, Fragile as a whole, and \"Roundabout\" specifically, helped define the genre.\n\nThe intricate playing, full-on dynamic rock and roll, strong melodies and great harmonies made it irresistible to underground FM radio as well as the Top 40, where a three-minute edit of the eight-minute song made it to No. 13 in the U.S. Top 100 singles chart.\n\nYes would travel through even more adventurous terrain, sometimes traveling too far into no man's land (Relayer, anyone?), but this was their high water mark of the era. It still sends chills up the spine of our very prog beings.\n\n87: War, \"Low Rider\"\n\nFrom the opening percussion and boss bass riff all the way to that wailing saxophone outro, War unleashed an irresistible funky groove with their hit \"Low Rider.\" The song hit the airwaves in the summer of 1975 and all the way to No. 7.\n\nWar were a unique band, mixing funk with Latin, jazz, rock, soul and pop to make a sound that was truly their own. \"Low Rider\" delivered a groove that was somehow both slinky and chunky, even funkier vocals, and a catchy-as-hell harmonica riff, courtesy of Lee Oskar – one of the true masters of the instrument.\n\nThis song was ubiquitous that summer and has taken on a life of its own in the years that followed. It has been used in countless movies, commercials and television shows and still gets airplay on oldies and classic rock radio.\n\nFor a band that basically started off as Eric Burdon's backing group, War certainly made a large mark on music history all by themselves with tracks like \"Low Rider.\"\n\n86: Steppenwolf, \"Born to Be Wild\"\n\nWith \"Born to Be Wild,\" Steppenwolf delivered not only a timeless rock anthem and open-road biker soundtrack, but also one of the most iconic tracks of an era.\n\nThe song was written by Mars Bonfire who, though not a member of Steppenwolf, had previously been in the Sparrows with Steppenwolf leader John Kay.\n\n\"Born to Be Wild\" appeared on the band's debut album and was released as a single, making it just shy of the No. 1 spot in the summer of 1968. Its greatest success, however, would come a year later when it was featured prominently in the classic film Easy Rider. From then on, it was forever attached to the idea of the open road, rebellion, freedom and rock and roll. The song has been covered countless times and used in dozens of movies and tv shows.\n\nThe other thing \"Born to Be Wild\" is known for are the words \"heavy metal,\" as featured in the lyrics: \"I like smoke and lightning / Heavy metal thunder.\" There is debate as whether or not this is the first time that term was used, well before it became a musical genre unto itself, but even if it's not, it's certainly the most identifiable. Now go on, get your motor runnin'!\n\n85: Marshall Tucker Band, \"Can't You See\"\n\nNo doubt they drew inspiration from their Capricorn Records label mates the Allman Brothers, but the Marshall Tucker Band were more than simply a band in the right place at the right time.\n\nThey joined Southern rock bands like the Allmans and Lynyrd Skynyrd who were riding an undisputed high in the late '60s and early '70s, but the Marshall Tucker Band shied away from the rebel image they embraced, choosing instead to forge a path that was more about making unforgettable music than anything else.\n\nWith \"Can't You See,\" they capably brought together Southern rock and country-rock in a very laid-back kind of way, but the lyrics paint a much darker picture: \"I'm gonna find me a hole in the wall / I'm gonna crawl inside and die / 'Cause my lady now ... never told me goodbye.\"\n\nThis isn't a love song in the traditional sense of the word. This is the story of a man running as far away as he can to begin the process of healing himself. Listening to the track, the heartache of the lyrics is reflected as optimistically as possible by guitarist Toy Caldwell, yet there is an overarching feeling of heartbreak and sadness understandably permeating the song.\n\nThe Marshall Tucker Band saw \"Can't You See\" stall at No. 75 on the Billboard chart in September 1977, but its curious failure there did not deter artists including Kid Rock, Poison, Black Stone Cherry, and, appropriately enough, the Allman Brothers from covering this song.\n\n84: The James Gang, \"Funk #49\"\n\nThe James Gang were huge in their hometown of Cleveland, but in some circles still might be best known as being the first major band of future Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh. (Other notable James Gang members at various points included Deep Purple guitarist Tommy Bolin and Mark Avsec of Donnie Iris & the Cruisers, and Wild Cherry.)\n\nBut \"Funk #49\" — the opening track on 1970’s James Gang Rides Again, the band's second album – cements their place in classic rock circles. The song’s enduring popularity has everything to do with Walsh’s snaky riffs, which weld country-influenced boogie and bluesy slide guitar to more traditional rock signifiers — and, yes, an effortlessly funky groove.\n\nThe tone of \"Funk #49\" not only presaged Walsh’s work with (and impact on) the Eagles; it helped form the musical template for the decade ahead. The song’s success also helped cement the relationship Walsh had with producer Bill Szymczyk. The pair went on to work together for decades.\n\nBut while \"Funk #49\" is a guitarist’s dream, it’s also much more inventive than it gets credit for. The bridge of the song — with wild-animal noises and percussion reminiscent of the Rolling Stones’ loose-hipped shimmies — especially bolsters the slinky, celebratory vibe.\n\n\"Funk #49\" has become a staple tune for musicians and cultures of all stripes; the song’s popped up everywhere from skateboarding documentaries (2001’s Dogtown and Z-Boys) to indie rock concerts (Pavement’s Stephen Malkmus covered \"Funk #49\" with his band the Jicks).\n\n83: The Pretenders, \"Brass in Pocket\"\n\nBy the time Chrissie Hynde and her Pretenders released their seminal hit \"Brass in Pocket,\" the band was already on its third lineup – and that's before they had any chart success. Their third single, \"Brass in Pocket\" was their first U.K. No. 1 and reached No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe brass in the song's titular pocket is meant to mean \"money,\" picked up from a bit of Yorkshire slang Hynde heard from a member of another band. Hynde's vocal imbues that brass with a far greater meaning: It's an emblem of confidence, a symbol of the certainty the singer feels when she considers what she wants and how she will achieve it.\n\nThink about the role of women as band leaders and songwriters in rock up to the arrival of the Pretenders. There were many great female singers, and many great female songwriters, but precious few women who could lead a band. Chrissie Hynde almost single-handedly changed all of that.\n\nWhile her contemporary Debbie Harry was putting her own spin on the idea of a female lead singer with Blondie, Hynde instead proved that a central role in rock's power and impact – the bandleader, the frontperson, the boss – could just as easily be filled by a woman as a man.\n\n\"Brass in Pocket\" also stands as one of many great singles to emerge from a musical era awkwardly known as \"new wave.\" It's awkward because the term inevitably conjures images of synth-drenched pop and Flock of Seagulls haircuts. More than anything else, this new wave was about a level of artistic integrity that vanished in the rock indulgences of the '70s and was made possible by the deck-clearing ferocity of punk. New wave wasn't about a sound. It was about a philosophy, and for the Pretenders – just as for XTC, Elvis Costello, Blondie and countless others – that philosophy meant strong songwriting anchored by pure musicianship.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's what \"Brass in Pocket\" is really about: It's a damn great song.\n\n82: The Animals, \"House of the Rising Sun\"\n\nThough it dates back to at least the early '30s, the Animals first heard the song which lands them on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list on the debut album by Bob Dylan.\n\nThis folk song was passed down through the years, ultimately making its way into the hands of Greenwich Village folk mainstay Dave Van Ronk, who put his own twist on \"House of the Rising Sun.\" His version is the one that Dylan took from for his 1962 debut and in turn, the one the Animals would use as a blueprint for their own rendition.\n\nIn the heat of the British Invasion in the summer of 1964, the Animals' \"House of the Rising Sun\" hit the top of both the U.K. and U.S. charts. Alan Price's haunting Hammond organ and Eric Burdon's impassioned vocals were a perfect fit for the track.\n\nIt would become not only the Animals' signature song, but also planted the first seeds of what would eventually become folk-rock. Out of step with most of the rest of the British invasion sounds, this record stood alone and utterly unique.\n\n81: T. Rex, \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\"\n\nT. Rex has probably the only song on our list with two different titles.\n\n\"Get It On\" was the single’s original U.K. title and Marc Bolan and his group took the track, originating from Electric Warrior, to No. 1 in 1971.\n\nLater, when the single was released in the U.S. it was re-titled \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" to distinguish it from another song with the same name by a band called Chase. The single went to No. 10 on the Billboard chart and turned out to be T. Rex’s shining moment and their biggest selling hit.\n\nThe hypnotic groove of this Tony Visconti-produced song begs you to play it repeatedly. The boogie-like piano, backup vocals from Flo and Eddie of the Turtles, and Bolan’s sassy guitar give way to the simple but suggestive lyrics that radiate like the \"hub-cap-diamond-star-halo\" that the author sings about.\n\nBolan found rhythm in his language and will long be remembered as a poet turned superstar. \"Bang a Gong (Get It On)\" still plays a crucial part in pop culture. Rewind through the decades and you’ll recall that the Power Station had a smash hit with it, Blondie have covered and recorded it live and last but not least, Joan Jett told Sirius radio that this single was one of the songs she used to learned to play guitar.\n\n80: Jefferson Airplane, \"Somebody to Love\"\n\n\"Somebody to Love\" was first recorded by an obscure Bay Area band called the Great Society, which featured Grace Slick on vocals and her brother Darby on guitar. (The latter also wrote the song, which was then titled \"Someone to Love.\")\n\nBut \"Somebody to Love\" didn’t resonate with a wider audience until Slick recorded it with her next group, Jefferson Airplane. The second version of the song boasts a faster tempo, beefed-up guitars and drums and, most important, a forceful performance from the frontwoman.\n\nThe hesitance Slick exhibited in the Great Society version vanishes. Instead, she belts out the indelible chorus – \"Don’t you want somebody to love? / Don’t you need somebody to love? / Wouldn’t you love somebody to love? / You better find somebody to love\" – with sharp, sassy confidence. A mixture of scorn and longing drips from her smoky voice; the delivery announces her arrival as one of the great female rock vocalists of all time.\n\nAlthough Jefferson Airplane were already leaders of the nascent San Francisco psych-rock scene, \"Somebody to Love\" signaled the band’s arrival in the mainstream: The song reached No. 5 on the Billboard chart and its accompanying album, 1967’s Surrealistic Pillow, hit No. 3.\n\nMore important, the song had a seismic impact on music's traditionally male-centric culture. \"Somebody to Love\" finally normalized women taking center stage in their musical projects — a ground-breaking moment which paved the way for female vocalists ranging from Janis Joplin all the way through to Adele.\n\n79: Pete Townshend, \"Let My Love Open the Door\"\n\nReleased in 1980, \"Let My Love Open the Door\" was the single pulled from what's often called Pete Townshend’s first \"official\" solo album – though it followed Who Came First and Rough Mix.\n\nThe mesmerizing keyboard that pulls you in may be considered the blueprint for many ‘80s hits that would follow; it's simple but extremely catchy. During a 1985 radio special called My Generation, it was said that Townshend’s manager hated this song and felt it should have been left off the album. He later called Townshend and apologized when \"Let My Love Open the Door\" became a big hit, eventually cracking the Top 10.\n\nA few different renditions of this song exist, like the far slower 1997 E. Cola Mix included on the Grosse Pointe Blank film soundtrack. If you were a fan of the television show Burn Notice, you probably also recognized a remake of the song used as its ending theme.\n\nTaking on a spirit of its own, \"Let My Love Open the Door\" is occasionally interpreted as a religious song, with lines like “There’s only one thing that’s going to set you free and that’s my love.\" Townshend has commenting obliquely on the matter by saying “Jesus sings,” but the song's intended meaning, if it has just one, has yet to be fully explained.\n\n78: America, \"A Horse With No Name\"\n\nConsidering their band name is America and was comprised of Americans, it's a bit odd to learn that the group in the No. 78 slot on our list was actually formed in England.\n\n\"A Horse With No Name\" became America's most popular single, helping their 1972 debut effort achieve platinum sales status in the United States. Funny enough though, the song was not included on the album when it was initially released. Given a lukewarm response by audiences in the U.K., America's label asked the group to head back into the studio and demo four additional songs. One of those additional songs was called \"Desert Song,\" a track that was eventually re-christened with its now-famous moniker.\n\nAmerica co-founder Dewey Bunnell was never shy about admitting the influence that Neil Young had upon his music, and you definitely sense that here. His lead vocals bear a striking resemblance to Young, and the vocal harmonies owed plenty to Young's occasional band mates in Crosby, Stills & Nash. \"A Horse With No Name\"eventually climbed to the No. 1 position on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, ironically overtaking Young's \"Heart of Gold\" for that spot.\n\nAmerica later scored a respectable number of hits after this, but they will be forever remembered as the band who observed \"plants and birds and rocks and things\" on their trip through the desert.\n\n77: Mountain, \"Mississippi Queen\"\n\nMountain stomps onto our list with one of the mightiest riffs of all time, as featured on \"Mississippi Queen.\"\n\nThis 1970 classic packs a whole lot of jolt into just two and a half minutes.The cowbell counts things off like an alarm, and then guitarist Leslie West delivers that famous and fantastic introduction. Fresh from a legendary appearance at Woodstock the year before, Mountain were on the rise in 1970 and the very catchy, yet very heavy, \"Mississippi Queen\" pushed the band up the ranks of rock royalty.\n\nThe song was the lead track from their first album, Climbing, and the single reached No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 early in that year. West's savage guitar, along with the rhythm section of Corky Laing on drums and bassist Felix Pappalardi added up to one mighty fine power trio.\n\n\"Mississippi Queen\" became an iconic slice of hard rock, influencing many an aspiring guitar hero over the following years and decades.\n\n76: Nazareth, \"Hair of the Dog\"\n\nIf the band had their way, the title of Nazareth's entry on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list might not be quite as subtle as it is now.\n\nIf you've ever wondered why the group just didn't name their smash hit 1975 album and its cowbell-and-talk box happy title track \"Son of a Bitch,\" after that famously threatening \"Now you're messing with a ...\" chorus, well, so is lead singer Dan McCafferty: \"We wanted to call the album Son of a Bitch but the record company went ape s---.\" he once told Classic Rock Revisited. \"They said, 'You can’t say that.' We said, 'F--- off, John Wayne says that in his movies and he is the neatest thing that you’ve got going.'\" (By \"you've\" we assume the Scottish singer was referring to America.)\n\nBut the label won, and an effort by the band to be more clear with the title \"Heir of the Dog\" was also rejected, leaving us with the vague innuendo we have today. Guns N' Roses loved the song enough to record it for their 1993 covers album The Spaghetti Incident?, and Britney Fox and Warrant also turned in their own versions. Still, with the rare (and highly contested) exception of Motley Crue perfecting \"Helter Skelter, as always the original remains the king.\n\n75: Buffalo Springfield, \"For What It's Worth\"\n\nDespite the fact that they were only originally active for an approximate two-year span (1966 to 1968), the impact of Buffalo Springfield's song \"For What It's Worth\" continues to resonate today, decades later.\n\nReleased approximately 12 years into the Vietnam War, the song has often been interpreted to be an anti-war anthem, when in fact \"For What It's Worth\" was originally written by Stephen Stills as a reaction to escalating unrest between Los Angeles law enforcement and club-goers on the Sunset Strip.\n\nThe unrest started when officers, bowing to pressure from both business and home owners in the area, chose to begin enforcing a strict 10 PM curfew that dated back to 1939 in an effort to curb the number of people hanging out there. The Los Angeles County board of supervisors decided that getting tough was the best tactic, and rescinded the \"youth permits\" of 12 of the clubs frequented by youth on the Sunset Strip, deeming them off-limits to anybody under 21 years of age.\n\nThe Sunset Strip riots were born when arrests for curfew violations began escalating. There were six consecutive weekends where young people protested the enforcement of the bylaw. Most of the damage was done, however, on Nov. 12, 1966, the first night demonstrations were held. Before the evening was through, store windows had been smashed, a city bus disabled and more than 200 arrests were made.\n\n\"For What It's Worth\" peaked at the No. 7 position on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in 1967, and has since been covered by the likes of Keb Mo, Rush and Ozzy Osbourne. It has also been sampled by hip-hop group Public Enemy for their track \"He Got Game.\"\n\n74: Manfred Mann's Earth Band, “Blinded By the Light”\n\nWhat does a British jazz-blues band know about life on the Jersey shore? Probably not much, but that didn't stop Manfred Mann's Earth Band from taking Bruce Springsteen's \"Blinded By the Light\" to No. 1 in 1976 and onto our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list.\n\nThe Earth Band was formed in 1971 out of the ashes of the original Manfred Mann band, replacing the original's garage rock with a more progressive sound that incorporated classical themes. But, like their first band, they weren't very prolific songwriters, and often had to rely on other composers.\n\nMann frequently covered Bob Dylan, and had a Top 10 hit with \"The Mighty Quinn\" in 1968. Meanwhile, Springsteen was one of the many \"New Dylans\" around, and had just broken through with Born To Run. So, it made sense that they record one of his songs. By coincidence, Springsteen had played Mann's \"Pretty Flamingo\" and \"Sha La La\" in concert previously.\n\nOn VH-1's Storytellers in 2005, Springsteen broke down the mystery of the lyrics. The song was a \"young musician's tale, kind of a litany of adventures. It was rather on the autobiographical side,\" shot through a rhyming dictionary. The \"madman drummer\" and the \"teenage diplomat\" in the opening line, for example, were him and original E Street Band member Vini \"Mad Dog\" Lopez. Along the way, we hit church dances, meet campus radicals, FBI agents and several loose women, including \"little Early-Pearly\" who \"came by in her curly wurly and asked me if I needed a ride.\" \"Don't overthink the whole thing,\" Springsteen warns.\n\nManfred Mann's Earth Band took the loose, folksy vibe of the original and gave it a harder edge, adding a lengthy guitar solo, Moog synthesizer and, for some reason, a snippet of the children's piano lesson, \"Chopsticks.\" Singer Chris Thompson skipped some verses entirely and, in the chorus, slurred the word \"deuce\" so that it sounded like \"douche.\" Springsteen claims this minor difference was the reason for the song's success after his own recording stiffed as a single in 1973.\n\nMann's version of \"Blinded By the Light\" marked the only time a Springsteen song hit No. 1. \"Dancing in the Dark\" reached No. 2 in the summer of 1984, but was kept out by Prince's \"When Doves Cry.\"\n\n73: Lou Reed, \"Walk on the Wild Side\"\n\nLou Reed’s \"Walk on the Wild Side\" may have been the first transvestite rock song that middle America heard.\n\nIt was late 1972 when Reed, who never ceased to offend somebody, managed to land a No. 29 hit with a single that strung themes of oral sex, Valium and “colored girls” into a four-minute masterpiece.\n\n\"Walk on the Wild Side\" has immortalized some of artist Andy Warhol’s friends, with Reed the narrator brilliantly delivering his cool rap-like observations about an explicit group of drag queens and hustlers that surrounded Warhol. Reed, having been plugged into that scene, can easily take credit for helping America find their wild side.\n\nThe single comes from the album Transformer which was co-produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, who were creatively peaking in their own right. The union of these three artists was nothing short of monumental. Bowie was ecstatic to work next to one of his heroes, while Reed benefited from the skills that Bowie and Ronson brought to the studio.\n\n72: Foreigner, \"Juke Box Hero\"\n\nForeigner’s \"Juke Box Hero,\" from their blockbuster 1981 4 album, draws you immediately into an unfolding rock and roll fantasy and lets one relive the experience of being a music fan in the ‘80s.\n\nThe song pays a well-deserved tribute to the rock and roll dreamer, inspired by a real life fan who Jones encountered outside of a sold out Foreigner concert: “Standing in the rain / With his head hung low / couldn’t get a ticket / It was a sold out show.”\n\nThe legendary tale behind the inspiration for \"Juke Box Hero\" reveals that Jones did indeed invite a fan to come in out of the rain to watch the band’s performance from the side of the stage, providing the lucky ticket holder with the ultimate golden ticket.\n\nThe song's pulsing bass line ebbs underneath a shadowy vocal from Lou Gramm, who lays out the story of how the sounds of that sold-out show and that “one guitar” in particular, blew the young future “juke box hero” away.\n\nGramm’s vocals soar to stratospheric heights as he recounts the adventures of the newly inspired future superstar as he scales the star-studded path to fame with his own guitar in hand. By the time the song ends, you can almost feel the sweat streaming down as the lights and sounds of the crowd begin to fade away.\n\nFor years, \"Juke Box Hero\" has been a concert staple, often coming late in the set. In fact, Foreigner concerts in the ‘80s and early ‘90s featured a giant inflatable jukebox that arose in epic fashion as the band performed the song.\n\n71: Janis Joplin, \"Piece of My Heart\"\n\nJanis Joplin is one of only a few female artists featured on our list of the Top 100 Classic Rock Songs. As Jim Morrison can tell you, however, she wasn't intimidated by any man, woman or child.\n\n\"Piece of My Heart\" was originally written and recorded in 1967, but it wasn’t a mainstream hit until Big Brother And The Holding Company (featuring Joplin) covered it in 1968. Taken from the band’s album Cheap Thrills, their version peaked at No. 12 on the U.S. pop chart.\n\nAretha Franklin's older sister Erma recorded it first, but reportedly didn’t recognize Joplin’s rendition of the song when she originally heard it on the radio. Joplin’s vocal arrangement was very different than the original, with Joplin leaning on blues conventions to belt out her sorrows.\n\nThis little 20-something white girl from Texas was daring her listeners to “take it, break it and have another piece” of her heart while her San Francisco band electrified a sound that would later be called \"acid rock.\" Joplin proved she meant serious business when she followed up the “you know you got it” lyric with one of the most historic “waaaaaahhhh” howls ever recorded.\n\n70: Talking Heads, \"Burning Down the House\"\n\nThe next artist on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs had the first show of their career opening for the Ramones at famed NYC club CBGB’s in 1975. Not a shabby way to kick-start your career.\n\n\"Burning Down the House\" from the Talking Heads' 1983 album Speaking In Tongues was the group’s biggest hit, no doubt thanks to the endless rotation of the song's innovative video on MTV. The single peaked at the No. 8 position on the Billboard Hot 100 singles.\n\nCharacterized by the very new-wave sound with which the band was associated, the song is perhaps most notable for the nonsensical phrases sung by vocalist David Byrne. If there was a hidden meaning or agenda behind lines such as “Cool babies, strange but not a stranger,\" he wasn’t letting the audience in on the gag.\n\nWhen discussing the song’s lyrics in an NPR interview conducted in 1984, Byrne said he had been simply trying to sing phrases that fit with the rhythm of the song, a technique that was influenced by their producer friend Brian Eno. Stating that he had “loads of phrases” that he thought “thematically had something to do with one another,\" Byrne merely cherry-picked from those phrases to compile the lyrics heard in the song.\n\nInterestingly, after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, \"Burning Down the House\" was put onto the list of media-giant Clear Channel’s list of possibly inappropriate songs for airplay.\n\n69: Rod Stewart, \"Maggie May\"\n\nIt's one of the relatively few songs he had a hand in writing during his solo career, but neither Rod Stewart nor his label thought all that much of \"Maggie May\" at first, relegating it to B-side status on the \"Reason to Believe\" single.\n\nFortunately for Rod, the general public had bigger plans for \"Maggie,\" sending it to No. 1 on the Billboard charts for a whopping five weeks in October 1971, and making it an easy choice to represent Stewart on our countdown.\n\nStewart wrote the song with Steamhammer guitarist Martin Quittenton, reaching back to a particularly saucy episode in his past for inspiration. He fessed up during a 2007 interview with Q, saying it \"was more or less a true story about the first woman I had sex with, at the Beaulieu Jazz Festival.\"\n\nIt almost didn't make the cut on Every Picture Tells a Story, he added, \"because the label said it didn't have a melody. I said, 'Well, we've run out of time now; these are all the tracks we've recorded.' They said, 'Alright, then, bring it on.'\"\n\n\"Maggie May\" cemented Stewart's marketability as a solo performer, which complicated relations with his bandmates in the Faces. He remained in the group until its split in 1975, but they were occasionally marketed as the \"Faces with Rod Stewart,\" driving a wedge into what was already a volatile mix. For Stewart, however, it kicked off a torrid string of hit singles and albums. He wouldn't place a solo LP outside the Billboard Top 40 for another 27 years, with 1998's When We Were the New Boys.\n\nAs for Maggie herself, her identity remains a mystery. The song title was taken not from the woman in the story, but from a traditional British folk song about a prostitute who robs a sailor. Something to think about the next time you're singing along.\n\n68: Don Henley, \"The Boys of Summer\"\n\nApparently undaunted by the legacy of the Eagles hanging over him, Don Henley found respectable success with his post-Eagles solo debut, 1982's I Can't Stand Still. His sophomore effort, 1984's Building the Perfect Beast, helped Henley prove once and for all that he could in fact fly without the Eagles. It also gave us the No. 68 track on our list.\n\n\"The Boys of Summer,\" a track whose theme centered on coming of age, could arguably be considered one of the finest moments of Henley's musical career. Co-written with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell, the song vaulted up to the No. 5 position on the Billboard Top 100 in 1984 and also brought home the Grammy award for best male rock vocal performance.\n\nIn stark contrast to his often critically dismissed work with the Eagles, \"The Boys of Summer\" finally provided Henley with commercial and critical acclaim.\n\n67: Motley Crue, \"Home Sweet Home\"\n\nMotley Crue's logo and imagery were already etched onto the notebooks of every hard rock- and metal-loving teenage fan prior to the 1985 release of their third album Theatre of Pain. However, the massive success of the album's soaring ballad \"Home Sweet Home\" catapulted the band to a whole new level of stardom and, years later, onto our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list.\n\nThe track quickly became a cultural touchstone, kick-starting (for better or worse) the power ballad trend and reportedly forcing MTV to change their rules in order to keep the song's similarly imitated video from dominating their call-in shows for the rest of time.\n\n\"Home Sweet Home\" has been covered by artists as diverse as Carrie Underwood and Limp Bizkit, and was featured in the 2010 movie Hot Tub Time Machine. More importantly, by our unscientific estimates, a quarter of a million gallons of cigarette-lighter fuel and 13 gigawatts of cell phone power have been consumed during Motley Crue's live performances of the song over the years.\n\nAlthough \"Home Sweet Home\" is most notable on first listen for the inclusion of a tender piano intro and outro from drummer Tommy Lee, Motley Crue wasn't abandoning their hard-rocking roots: Check out the majestic and anthemic soloing from guitarist Mick Mars which dominates the song's climactic second half.\n\n66: Phil Collins, \"In the Air Tonight\"\n\nWhen you think of Phil Collins, the climactic, dam-bursting drum beat of his 1981 hit \"In the Air Tonight\" is very likely one of the first things that comes to mind. As famous and familiar as this Top 100 Classic Rock Song is today, it came out of one of the darkest periods of Collins’ life.\n\nA divorce from his first wife Andrea provided the framework for his solo debut Face Value, a dark portrait of the emotional despair and anger that the Genesis frontman was feeling over the loss. \"In the Air Tonight\" brings Collins’ anger fully to the surface, in a menacing tone delivered over the backing of a simplistically programmed drum machine.\n\nHis vocal seethes with a new-found confidence, knowing that there is indeed a light at the end of the tunnel. The feeling which Collins sings is “coming in the air tonight,” is one of redemption, having gained a greater understanding and clarity. Later, he calls out the elephant in the room directly, saying: “So you can wipe off that grin / I know where you’ve been / it’s all been a pack of lies.\"\n\nStill, the centerpiece of the song, without a doubt, is the unforgettable mid-song drum breakdown from Collins which brings the energy levels of \"Air\" to full throttle. The sight of Collins thrashing around his drum kit is a now-famous visual which was later replicated in one of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" games where the bad guys were out to kill Collins while he's on stage performing \"In the Air Tonight.\" Collins, an avid gamer in the ‘80s and ‘90s, was happy to participate in the GTA series, working with the video game makers directly on the \"Kill Phil\" portions of the game, playing himself.\n\nA much less dramatic version with no bad guys can be found on the Live at Montreux DVD, recorded in 2004. He was later forced to temporarily retire from drumming due to back problems that made it too painful for him to play the drums.\n\nIn 2015, Collins returned to recording and touring. If he needed an extra hand on stage, Mike Tyson seems prepared to take over. Either way, \"In the Air Tonight\" will survive in recorded form as one of his greatest accomplishments.\n\n65: Bachman-Turner Overdrive, \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\"\n\nRecord-label folk usually take a lot of flack for interfering in the creative process, but Bachman-Turner Overdrive's entry on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list may not have been heard by anyone outside the band's inner circle if it weren't for their A&R guy.\n\nRandy Bachman later told Billboard Book of Number One Hits that he never intended for \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\" to be included on 1974's Not Fragile. Instead, he recorded it on a lark, complete with stammering \"Bu-bu-bu-baby\" vocals, as a joke and loving tribute to his brother Gary, who actually did have a stutter: \"It was basically just an instrumental and I was fooling around,\" he said. \"I wrote the lyrics, out of the blue, and stuttered them through.\"\n\nWhen Mercury Records A&R executive Charlie Fach listened to the supposedly finished eight-song version of the album, however, he declared that he \"didn't hear that magic thing.\" (We can't understand why the storming brontosaurus of a title track didn't ring his bell, though.)\n\nBachman dug out the previously private demo for \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet,\" Fach flipped for it, and after an aborted attempt to re-record it without the stutter, agreed to let this track appear on Not Fragile as originally created. When it started getting more attention from radio than the officially released single \"Roll on Down the Highway,\" Fach was forced to give up all resistance.\n\nBTO officially released \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\" as a single, it soared to No. 1 on the pop chart and became one of their most beloved tunes ever. Since, the track has hovered around the top of recurrent FM playlists, and appeared in a never-ending series of movies and TV shows to this day.\n\n64: Stevie Nicks, \"Edge of Seventeen\"\n\n\"Edge of Seventeen (Just Like the White Winged Dove)\" was the third single from Stevie Nicks' debut solo album, 1981's Bella Donna. The story behind this entry in our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs is one of musical lore.\n\nIts name came from a conversation Stevie had with her good friend Tom Petty's first wife Jane about the couple's first meeting. Jane said they met at the \"age of seventeen,\" but her thick Southern accent made it sound like she said \"edge of seventeen\" — and Nicks was so taken with the phrase that she asked Jane if she could use it as a song title.\n\nStevie intended \"Edge of Seventeen\" to be about the Pettys, but when her beloved uncle Jonathan and music legend John Lennon both died during the same week in December of 1980, she shifted focus. She's since said that the \"white-winged dove\" in the lyrics represented the spirit leaving the body upon death, and some of the verses recount Stevie's experiences in the days leading up to her uncle's passing.\n\n\"Edge of Seventeen\" peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1982, and to this day it remains one of Nicks' most recognizable tracks. In fact, the guitar riff — played by Stevie's longtime guitarist, session musician Waddy Wachtel — is so distinctive that it was sampled in the Destiny's Child song \"Bootylicious,\" and Stevie herself even made an appearance in the accompanying video.\n\n63: Billy Joel, \"Piano Man\"\n\nSomewhere right now, Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" is playing.\n\nIt's on a jukebox, and it's on in the produce section at your local grocery store. It's on your radio; it's in your head. It's a key component in the aural wallpaper that surrounds us every day, and it's on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list.\n\nAnd it's part of that wallpaper because it's easy, and it's kinda soft, and pleasant enough in its own way, at least if you don't think too hard about the sad-sack loser characters that inhabit its lyrics. But it's also part of the soundtrack to our lives because it's a damn great song.\n\nDrawing inspiration from his time spent as a piano player in an L.A. bar between recording contracts, Joel creates an indelible mental portrait of the characters who inhabit a watering hole on a Saturday night, looking to \"forget about life for a while.\" You can almost see the haze of cigarette smoke and hear the clinking of glasses.\n\nOddly enough, the song was both butchered, then somewhat ignored when first released as a single in 1973. Deemed too long for Top 40 radio, it was edited down into shorter versions and then promptly disappeared into oblivion, topping out at No. 25 on the Billboard charts. After Joel's breakout album The Stranger found success in 1977, the song gained far more traction until the point where it ultimately became synonymous with Joel himself.\n\nAfter a couple of decades riding the charts with radio-friendly, expertly-crafted piano pop, and a couple decades after that as the punchline to every other bloated drunkard joke on late-night talk shows, it might be easy to dismiss Billy Joel. It's been decades since his last studio record, 1993's River of Dreams, dominated the airwaves, and that was by no means his greatest work.\n\nNext time \"Piano Man\" pops up in the aural wallpaper of your life, however, give it a real listen. Let it paint a picture for you, and understand the real brilliance of Billy Joel. Great songs tell a story, and whether you've spent time in a piano lounge or never set foot in one, \"Piano Man\" paints a vivid portrait of a specific place and time, every time you hear it. That's true whether you're waiting in the dentist's office or wrapped in the sonic embrace of your headphones.\n\n62: Golden Earring, \"Radar Love\"\n\nWith 1973's \"Radar Love,\" Golden Earring drove into full view of the U.S. record-buying public and parked themselves in our list.\n\nFormed in 1965 in the Netherlands, Golden Earring had been releasing a string of fantastic records for nearly a decade, but nothing that took hold in the U.S. market. Their (highly recommended) 1973 album Moontan changed that, as FM radio began spinning cuts like \"Vanilla Queen\" and \"Candy's Going Bad,\" while at the same time the driving rocker \"Radar Love\" made its way to top 40 radio, reaching No. 13 on the Billboard charts.\n\nBuilt around an insistent rhythm and riff, the song rides alongside its protagonist, who has been \"driving all night, hands wet on the wheel\" while listening to Brenda Lee's \"Comin' On Strong\" — a pretty driving little number itself, we might add!\n\n\"Radar Love\" opened the door for Golden Earring in the states, but would remain their only big hit here until the '80s, when they hit with \"Twilight Zone.\"\n\nLike so many of the artists featured on this list, Golden Earring are so much more than the one or two songs they are best known for. Check out albums like Switch, Seven Tears, Winter Harvest and Wall of Dolls. You will not be sorry.\n\n61: Stevie Ray Vaughan, \"Pride and Joy\"\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan's \"Pride and Joy\" took a long and legend-assisted path to our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs countdown.\n\nAfter a blistering performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1982, the then-unknown guitarist left the gig discouraged, thinking the audience reception was less than favorable. Little did he know that David Bowie and Jackson Browne were in the audience.\n\nShortly thereafter, two generous offers from those stars followed that help launch Vaughan’s career. Bowie asked Vaughan to play on his 1983 album Let’s Dance, and Browne offered Vaughan studio space to record his own debut Texas Flood, which ultimately led to a recording contract.\n\nBy the time that year was over, Vaughan could be heard on six different hit singles, four from Bowie's album and two from his own, including \"Pride and Joy.\" Once this “sweet little thing” was heard across the airwaves, everyone took notice. Vaughan and his band Double Trouble were delivering the blues and better still; pop-rock radio put it in rotation, which was very uncommon at the time.\n\nSome believe that Vaughan single-handedly revitalized the blues genre, introducing it to an eager new audience. \"Pride And Joy\" became a Top 20 hit in the U.S. and helped kick off an amazingly successful career that was tragically cut short by his 1990 death in a helicopter crash.\n\n60: Foghat, \"Slow Ride\"\n\nWell, of course Foghat’s \"Slow Ride\" nabbed a spot on our list of the Top 100 Classic Rock Songs?\n\nAn eight-minute-plus slab from the 1975 Foghat album Fool For the City, this song works its way into your subconscious slowly but quite deliberately. When that steady drum beat starts, you'll no doubt find your hand starting to smack your kneecap in time as the initial guitar riff kicks in.\n\nBarely past the 10-second mark, shape-shifting cymbals surround a woozy slide guitar riff from Rod Price. This provides the appropriate backing for vocalist \"Lonesome\" Dave Peverett to deliver the soul-shaking chorus: “Slow ride / take it easy / Slow ride / take it easy.”\n\nSimple enough, right? After a couple more rounds of that, Peverett shifts into the verse: “I’m in the mood / the rhythm is right / We can roll all night / Move to the music.” The soundtrack to more than a few “lost weekends” had been found, even as \"Slow Ride\" gave Foghat a Top 20 hit on the Billboard charts.\n\nA whole new generation of music fans discovered \"Slow Ride\" for the first time in the early ‘90s, thanks to its high-profile placement in the closing credits of the stoner comedy Dazed and Confused. But movies and the eventual video game licensing possibilities were probably the furthest thing from the mind of Foghat members during their heyday. The band was focused on building an audience at a time when they couldn’t get arrested, chasing their dreams as they perfected their own special blend of “boogie rock,” the ingredients of which called for lots and lots of generously applied slide guitar.\n\nThat recipe was eventually good enough for five gold-selling albums and several charting hits in the '70s. The decade that followed brought about a quiet period for the band, and members drifted apart for a few years, before Foghat finally returned. Drummer Roger Earl is the only remaining original member, following the deaths of both Peverett and Price. Former Ted Nugent vocalist Charlie Huhn helped lead the group through their well-received 2010 release Last Train Home.\n\n59: The Kinks, \"You Really Got Me\"\n\nIf you are searching for the definitive riff in all of rock and roll, we may have just the thing for you: The Kinks' 1964 gate crasher \"You Really Got Me,\" the next entry in our list of Top 100 Classic Rock Songs.\n\nThis amazingly primal track, released in the summer of 1964 during the height of the British Invasion, inspired countless bands over many genres. It has been said that the roots of punk, heavy metal and garage rock can be traced to this two-and-a-half-minute blast of energy.\n\nRay Davies' simple, almost neanderthal riff — played by brother Dave Davies, and aided by perfectly a raw production from Shel Talmy — was unique to the beat groups invading our shores that year. The Beatles were more refined, the Animals more bluesy and Gerry & The Pacemakers more pop, but the Kinks were savagely loud rock and roll.\n\nThis riff really did launch a thousand songs in its wake, just ask the Who, AC/DC, the Clash, Van Halen (who had their own hit with a cover of the song), Blur and Jack White, to name a few. That surge of teen urgency channeled through that distorted guitar was a match made in heaven. Crank it up and you will see that decades later, it still knocks down walls.\n\nOne of the greatest songwriters of the rock and roll era, Ray Davies went on to compose a string of amazing singles and albums. The Kinks' catalog from 1964 through 1970 stands up to that of any of their more popular peers.\n\n58: Steve Miller Band, \"The Joker\"\n\nAfter a string of blues-influenced albums, 1973's \"The Joker\" took the Steve Miller Band music and songwriting in a more pop and rock direction, resulting in the biggest hits of his career. That rise to superstardom began here and it's not hard to see why. With a guitar riff that's as catchy as it is simple and the kind of lyrics that are instantly quotable, \"The Joker\" is almost so stupid it's brilliant, or maybe so brilliant it's dumb.\n\nThat said, no in-depth discussion of the \"The Joker\" can avoid the tune's central question: What, exactly, is \"the pompatus of love\"? Well, nothing, at first – though it has grown into something of a neologism, or \"a newly coined term, word, or phrase, that may be in the process of entering common use, but has not yet been accepted into mainstream language.\"\n\nWhether pompatus will ever gain that acceptance remains to be seen, but it does exist in the Oxford English Dictionary, where it's defined as \"to act with pomp and splendor.\" Miller might have invented the word — one story has him misinterpreting the lyrics from a 1954 song by the Medallions — or popatus could've simply derived from some long-lost snippet of conversation by someone with the world's weirdest vocabulary.\n\nIf this seems like a lot of research trying to understand a song that's really about weed and chicks, hey, that's rock 'n' roll. Plus, \"the splendor of love\" sounds downright boring.\n\nToday, \"The Joker\" stands as a cornerstone of classic rock radio and part of the pop culture landscape. Topping Billboard's Hot 100 in early 1974, the song hit the top of the U.K. singles chart 16 years later after being featured in an ad campaign for Levi's. It even partially inspired a 1996 feature film starring Jon Cryer – titled The Pompatus of Love, of course.\n\nMaybe what's most compelling about \"The Joker\" is the fact that even though the lyrics seem to make absolutely no sense, there is always this feeling that if you just listen a few more times, you'll somehow unlock the secrets of Maurice, the space cowboy, and the pompatus of love.\n\n57: Joe Walsh, \"Rocky Mountain Way\"\n\nWe've already seen Joe Walsh on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list as a member of the James Gang, and it's a pretty safe bet we'll be checking in on him later as part of the Eagles, but right now, how about we take a trip down \"Rocky Mountain Way?\"\n\nTechnically, we could have snuck Walsh onto our countdown four times. Even though only his name is on the cover, this song actually comes from the second album by his post-James Gang project, Barnstorm.\n\nReportedly inspired by the longtime Ohio native's move to Colorado, the chunky slide guitar, lurching rhythm and rolling piano line on \"Rocky Mountain Way\" does indeed capture the rugged natural beauty of that state. Although they're not exactly clear or literal, the lyrics seem to indicate Walsh moved in order to get away from some personal troubles, which apparently worked just as he imagined it: \"And we don't need the ladies crying 'cuz the story's sad / Cause the Rocky Mountain way is better than the way we had.\"\n\n\"Rocky Mountain Way\" is perhaps most famous for that incredible talk box guitar solo, but he didn't pioneer this sound. Simpler forms of the technology had been used on records before. In fact, Walsh got his device from friend Bill West (Dottie West's husband), and it had previously been used on Pete Drake's 1955 song \"Forever.\" Still, Walsh took things to a whole new level of popularity among his peers and the public.\n\nPeter Frampton was obviously inspired: He called Walsh to find out what this magic box was and how to use it. The results can be heard on Frampton's later entry on this Top 100 list.\n\n56: George Harrison, \"My Sweet Lord\"\n\nWhen George Harrison wrote \"My Sweet Lord\" in late 1969, the Beatles were still officially together, so Harrison gave this future Top 100 Classic Rock Songs entry to their friend and Apple Records label mate Billy Preston.\n\nFive months later, the Beatles had disbanded, while Preston’s version failed to score much attention. So, Harrison reclaimed the number and recorded it for his debut solo album All Things Must Pass.\n\nThough he wasn’t keen on a single getting issued, preferring the undiluted impact of a triple album, \"My Sweet Lord\" was released in late 1970 and soon thereafter, became an international No. 1 hit. It was the first song by a former Beatle to reach the top, and it was the biggest seller of all the singles to be released by any of the four solo Beatles in the ‘70s.\n\nThe million-selling single featured some famous Harrison friends — including Preston, Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr. Still, its success was quickly followed by legal controversy. Turns out Harrison’s song sounded a lot like Ronnie Mack’s \"He’s So Fine,\" which the Chiffons hit with in 1963. A prolonged copyright infringement suit followed, resulting in the court finding Harrison guilty of “subconsciously” copying the tune.\n\nRegardless, Harrison believed that because \"My Sweet Lord\" sounded like a pop song, it had the power to sneak up on the listener, and he was right. The song's numerous “Hallelujahs” and “Hare Krishna” chants became part of the mainstream, thanks to an ex-Beatle with a gentle spirit and a slide guitar.\n\n55: Def Leppard, \"Photograph\"\n\nIt’s often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and the same is true about Def Leppard’s entry into our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list.\"Photograph\" was a smash hit for the Sheffield, U.K.-based group in 1983, helping launch Def Leppard and their Pyromania album into the rock stratosphere.\n\nFrontman Joe Elliott didn’t need a thousand words to get his point across: The lyrics reveal right from the start that the singer is “Outta luck and outta love” and it doesn’t take long to figure out that his photograph collection isn't getting the job done romantically. He longs to touch the real thing, whoever she is. Alas, this mystery girl remains only a fantasy and much to his despair, he can only love her from afar.\n\nDef Leppard knows the formula for creating a good single, and this was just one of many for this talented group. Elliott and guitarist Phil Collen are both huge fans of rock ‘n’ roll, and with inspirations ranging from the Beatles and David Bowie to Mott the Hoople, this band of believers were destined for their own stardom.\n\n\"Photograph\" absolutely ruled the airwaves during its time, and the former No. 1 hit can still be heard frequently on classic rock radio. Decades later it’s also still a fan favorite at their live shows. With its strong, passionate vocal from Elliott and great guitar riffs from Collen, the song's unforgettable melody is as indelible as a photographic image.\n\n54: Free, \"All Right Now\"\n\nPrior to their time in Bad Company, Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke had already realized a few rock and roll fantasies of their own with Free.\n\nTheir signature number \"All Right Now,\" which deservedly grabs a slot on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs countdown, was created by a group who were just in their teens when they first got together. In fact, bassist Andy Fraser just 15 years old at time.\n\nSuccess wasn’t immediate for Free – or for \"All Right Now.\" The song was laid down live in the studio for the most part (Rodgers adding his vocals after the fact), but then found itself buried as the last song on the second side of their third album, 1970's Fire and Water. Listening to \"All Right Now\" now, however, you wonder how anyone missed it.\n\nIn truth, even Free themselves “weren’t that keen on it,” according to Fraser. But Island Records president Chris Blackwell stepped in and released it anyway. As \"All Right Now\" became a big hit, some critics claimed that the main riff had been lifted directly from the Rolling Stones’ \"Honky Tonk Women.\" Fraser pointed to a different influence, telling Classic Rock magazine that he was trying to imitate Pete Townshend, who he calls “the best chord player.\"\n\n\"All Right Now\" was well received amongst Free’s musical peers: Steve Miller later admitted that the intro to \"Rock N’ Me\" was a nod to Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, and the soon-to-be-famous intro from \"All Right Now.\" The inspiration was karmic, because both tunes had been born out of a desire to inject a heavy dosage of rock into an otherwise mid-tempo set. They needed a number to get the audiences on their feet, and \"All Right Now\" (which was made complete with a healthy helping of cowbell) proved to be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nAt the height of Free’s popularity, they performed a rough and tumble version of \"All Right Now\" for over 600,000 people at the Isle of Wight festival, all of whom were unaware that the same song would someday be used to try to pick up a delicious blonde on a bus (via a classic Wrigley’s commercial).\n\nInner-band turmoil and wildly fluctuating record sales eventually caused Free to break apart, and that was followed tragically by the drug-related death of Kossoff in 1976. Still, the blistering \"All Right Now\" remains a feather in their cap.\n\n53: Blue Oyster Cult, \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\"\n\nReleased in 1976, Blue Oyster Cult's classic \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" could be considered the summation of all they had done up to that point in their career, condensed into a five-minute song.\n\nThe first single, and centerpiece of their fourth studio album Agents Of Fortune, was an instant hit on FM radio, and to this day remains a daily radio favorite. It is also the song most identified with Blue Oyster Cult, solidifying its inclusion here on our list of the Top 100 Classic Rock Songs.\n\nFormed in 1968 as Soft White Underbelly, the group soon changed their name to the Stalk Forest Group and signed with Elektra records. An album was recorded, but never released. They soon adopted the moniker of Blue Oyster Cult and signed with Columbia. The band's first three albums are all stone-cold classics of hard, yet at times very ethereal, rock and roll.\n\nWith Agents Of Fortune, the band fine tuned their sound and as a result connected with radio and record buyers, sending \"Reaper\" to No. 12, and the album into the Top 30. The mood is set with a sinister yet inviting, Byrds-inspired guitar riff. A driving rhythm and haunting vocals overtake the proceedings and then at the halfway point, the whole thing bursts wide open into guitar frenzy before the overall calm reclaims the terrain. A brilliant piece of rock and roll from start to end.\n\nThe song was later parodied on Saturday Night Live, with Christopher Walken playing a character who actually had nothing to do with the original recordings. Bruce Dickinson was the reissue producer and did not produce the original album; Sandy Pearlman did.\n\n52: The Guess Who, \"American Woman\"\n\nThese five guys from Manitoba, Canada, can't seem to grasp the allure of an American woman during this entry on our list of Top 100 Classic Rock Songs. But it still made for great rock and roll. Hailing from the record of the same name, the Guess Who's \"American Woman\" vaulted to the top of the Billboard charts shortly after the single was released in March 1970.\n\nThe song actually came together in a rather unexpected way. It reportedly started as a live jam during one of the Guess Who's concerts in Ontario, Canada. As the group found their way, Burton Cummings began improvising the lyrics, singing what he felt worked best with the rhythm.\n\nAlthough some perceived the song's lyrics to be chauvinistic, bassist Jim Kale insisted that the words were merely meant to reflect some of the social differences between Canada and the United States at the time, most namely around the draft for the Vietnam War. In an ironic twist, the Guess Who were invited to play at the White House shortly after the song was a certified hit but were reportedly asked by First Lady Pat Nixon to refrain from playing \"American Woman\" due to its perceived anti-American lyrics.\n\n51: The Police, \"Roxanne\"\n\n\"Roxanne\" almost wasn’t a hit for the Police. In fact, the song wasn’t even a blip on the U.K. charts after its April 1978 release. And when \"Roxanne\" did finally resonate with listeners after its 1979 re-release, it barely cracked the Top 40 in the U.S. (going to No. 32) and only hit No. 12 in the U.K.\n\nStill, \"Roxanne\" is now known as the Police’s signature song, and an obvious choice for our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list, even more recognizable than their monster 1983 hit, \"Every Breath You Take.\"\n\nA departure from their first single, the punk-inspired \"Fall Out\" – but aligned with the reggae-tinged sound of their 1978 debut LP, Outlandos d’Amour — \"Roxanne\" is an early and instructive example of new wave’s genre melding. (\"People always tell me that 'Roxanne' is a reggae song,” Sting told Q magazine in 1993. “It's actually a tango; it's not a f---ing reggae song.”) His unorthodox voice – a ragged, yelping instrument with the phrasing and timing of a soul singer – drives the song, whose hiccupping bass line trips seamlessly through drummer Stewart Copeland’s jazz-crisp beats. Guitarist Andy Summers’ repetitive chords, influenced by punk's raw sound, provide the meticulous texture of the song.\n\nSting’s lyrical inspiration for \"Roxanne\" was the red-light district in Paris. \"It was the first time I'd seen prostitution on the streets and those birds were actually beautiful,” he told L'Historia Bandido in 1981. “I had a tune going around in my head and I imagined being in love with one of those girls. I mean, they do have fellas. How would I feel?”\n\nThe song’s protagonist is ostensibly saving her from her profession: \"You don't have to put on the red light / Those days are over.\" However, it’s unclear if his intentions are pure, as jealousy (\"I have you to tell just how I feel / I won't share you with another boy\") and not-so-tacit disapproval (\"Walk the streets for money / You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right\") crop up in the lyrics.\n\nDespite the risque subject matter, \"Roxanne\" reportedly helped the Police secure a record deal. As the story goes, future manager Miles Copeland (Stewart’s brother) heard them play the song, saw some potential and took it to A&M Records. The label agreed, beginning a relationship that would span the Police's entire career.\n\nAs if to underscore its genre fluidity, \"Roxanne\" has metamorphosed through the years. Emo-pop act Fall Out Boy emphasized the punk roots of the song on a 2005-released cover, while pop star George Michael approached the song like a standards crooner. Sting himself has actually reinvented the song more than anyone else: He recorded a version of the song with rapper Puff Daddy in 1997, and during solo concerts has performed both an extended, reggae-driven interpretation of the song and a gentle orchestral rendition.\n\n50: Peter Frampton, \"Show Me the Way\"\n\nPeter Frampton’s \"Show Me the Way\" was originally featured on the guitarist's 1975 Frampton album, but the version that has entered our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs – and our hearts – is the live take from Frampton Comes Alive!, released the following year.\n\nFrampton is deservedly celebrated for his guitar playing and songwriting, but should also be recognized as a survivor in an industry that chews up and spits out even the best of them. The longevity of his career is nothing short of remarkable. Remember, he started out as the vocalist and guitarist in the British teen band the Herd, and then followed that up by co-founding the mighty Humble Pie before going solo.\n\nFrampton released four mildly successful solo albums before millions and millions of copies of Frampton Comes Alive! surprisingly flew off the record store shelves in 1976, and \"Show Me the Way\" is a big part of why his music suddenly clicked with audiences. It was also one of the first singles to introduce us to Frampton’s talk-box skills, which to this day fascinates and entertains his followers.\n\nThe victory of \"Show Me the Way\" is that the masses were more than willing to participate in Frampton’s quest. He was calling out for guidance and the audience made the connection. So, while the boys tried to figure out how he achieved that unique talk-box sound (could it be he got some inspiration from Joe Walsh?), girls across the globe were gazing upon the bronzed, shirtless blonde that was pinned up on their bedroom walls. Decades years later, Frampton has proven that he knew the way all along.\n\n49: The Doobie Brothers, \"Black Water\"\n\nYou can almost feel the warm breeze blowing in as the summery sounds of wind chimes lead into the acoustic guitar and fiddle during the opening of the next track on our Top 100 Classic Rock Song countdown, the Doobie Brothers' \"Black Water.\"\n\nThe tune was originally relegated to the b-side of the single \"Another Park, Another Sunday,\" from the 1974 album What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits. However, in an oft-repeated tale in rock history, an intrepid DJ flipping the record over and playing the other side led to the song hitting the No. 1 spot early that same year.\n\nWritten and sung by guitarist Patrick Simmons, \"Black Water\" was a change up from the more rootsy rock and roll that had established the band up to this point with hits like \"Long Train Runnin'\" and \"China Grove.\" \"Black Water\" also featured a subtle-but-clear country influence, and a lovely breakdown a cappella section that connected strongly and immediately with fans.\n\nThe Doobie Brothers would go on to score more hits and explore more creative ground throughout their long and successful career, but \"Black Water\" was their first monster hit and remains among their most popular songs ever.\n\n48: Rush, \"Tom Sawyer\"\n\nRush grab their much deserved slot on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list with a track that found the band once again breaking new ground artistically.\n\nThe unmistakeable sonic boom synthesizer intro of \"Tom Sawyer\" launches side one of 1981’s landmark Moving Pictures. Thanks largely to this song, the LP reached the top five of the Billboard album charts and would eventually become Rush’s best-selling record.\n\nFrom the band's perspective, every single second of \"Tom Sawyer\" would be hard fought for in the studio as they worked to get things exactly right. What began (as it often does) as simple noodling at soundcheck evolved into a much more complex undertaking. Fortunately their efforts paid off and \"Tom Sawyer\" was quite well received, to put it mildly.\n\nThe positive reception however, came as a complete shock to the band. Rush bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee once recalled that “when we wrote it, we had no idea that it would touch such a nerve with people.” Today, he calls it a “quintessential” part of the Rush catalog. Of course, South Park’s Eric Cartman had some trouble with the lyrics, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find anyone else who can’t recite the classic opening lines verbatim: “A modern-day warrior/ Mean mean stride/ Today’s Tom Sawyer/ Mean mean pride.”\n\n\"Tom Sawyer\" also features a particularly epic solo from Alex Lifeson. (For every frustrated guitar player who spent countless hours in the bedroom trying to get every note exactly right, just know that you weren’t alone.) Lifeson has joked in the past about nailing the solo in a short period of time, but he later admitted that in reality quite a bit of tinkering was necessary to finally get a satisfactory take.\n\nThe finished results speak for themselves: It’s clear that Rush got exactly it right with \"Tom Sawyer.\"\n\n47: Thin Lizzy, \"The Boys Are Back in Town\"\n\nRegardless of exactly what format the best local rock station from your teenage years favored – the popular classics, the hard stuff, or true oldies – odds are pretty good that Thin Lizzy's 1976 hit 'The Boys Are Back in Town' was regularly pulled out of the record stacks to accompany your evening's adventures.\n\nLearning how to drive, then spending weekend nights goofing off with your friends in the car, you'd kill to hear a song like this on the radio. It would soundtrack your night, but you'd hope for more – that it would somehow bend the evening toward some chaotic climax of insanity, like a bar fight or the chance to sweep some new girl off her feet. Even if, in reality there were no bars you really had a prayer of getting into and few girls willing to give any of us guys the time of day.\n\nThin Lizzy's classic sound was defined by the twin guitars of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson, and the central riff on hard-to-dispute Top 100 Classic Rock Songs club member \"The Boys Are Back in Town\" is maybe their most recognizable and brilliant moment. But let's not discount the late Phil Lynott's lyric or vocals; breathless from the start, he paints with a broad brush and brings you into the middle of an ongoing story. These characters aren't from anywhere you know, and they may not wander through your night again, but while they're around, they will tear things up.\n\nWe must admit, we can't recall any evenings spent cruising around in our green Ford Tempo that rivaled the action depicted in \"The Boys Are Back in Town.\" But we do remember, very vividly, hearing this song on the radio, turning the dial all the way up, and wishing desperately that something unexpected and insane would happen in our dorky 17-year-old lives.\n\n46: Judas Priest, \"Living After Midnight\"\n\nBy 1980, more than a decade into their career, Judas Priest were ready to take on the world. With the release of their sixth album, the classic British Steel and the single \"Living After Midnight\" they were really delivering the goods.\n\nThe song packed a real one-two punch that woke up U.S. fans to the power of Priest. With its simple, almost Kinks-like riff, \"Living After Midnight\" was a perfect melding of metal and pop, in the best sense of both worlds. In just over three minutes, Judas Priest packed all the power of their metallic sound into a simple, direct pop track.\n\nLeaving behind earlier, more complicated songwriting, the band turned in a riff, melody and driving beat that was irresistible to rock radio. Record buyers also got hooked, giving Judas Priest their first major hit. The album cracked the Top 40 in America and the Top 5 in their native England.\n\nJudas Priest could be a lot heavier, no doubt, and at times even poppier (remember \"Turbo Lover\"?), but \"Living After Midnight\" was that perfect union of the two sides of the coin, giving us, perhaps, the definitive Judas Priest record and an obvious choice for inclusion on our list of the Top 100 Classic Rock Songs.\n\n45: Alice Cooper, \"School's Out\"\n\nFour years after Frank Zappa realized there was something special about Alice Cooper, signing them to his record label, the title track from the band's 1972 album School's Out sent the group to the head of the class. Decades later, it still easily aces our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs entrance exam.\n\n\"School's Out\" itself is a masterpiece of full on rock and roll. Three and a half minutes of pure loud guitar bliss, with Alice (the man) in full power of his gritty, made-for-rock and roll voice. From the opening call to arms guitar riff through to the cheering school kids at the end, it's a celebration put to wax.\n\nWisely released just as school was letting out across America, the single hit the Top 10 in June of 1972 and would carry the album all the way to No. 2. The song proved to be an even bigger hit in England, where it shot to No. 1 and made Alice Cooper an sensation.\n\nThe ever-present controversy surrounding Alice Cooper didn't hurt. The group's on-stage use of snakes, hangings, guillotines and a pervading dark, perverse sense of humor made their show a must-see attraction early on. The release of the School's Out album itself was not without its share of headlines as the initial run was packaged with paper panties in lieu of a sleeve.\n\nTurns out, the panties were flammable and had to be recalled. Naysayers howled: Who was this sick Alice Cooper and why were young kids buying a record with panties in it? Of course, this was back when parents would genuinely get upset by such things. Ahh, those were the days!\n\n44: Cheap Trick, \"I Want You to Want Me\"\n\nIn the spring of 1979, you couldn't escape the sounds of \"I Want You To Want Me,\" the first big hit from Cheap Trick. Then again, why would you want to?\n\nThe original studio version of the song had appeared on the band's 1977 sophomore LP In Color, and failed to make any waves in this country. In Japan, a different story was unfolding: The band became an overnight sensation in the land of the rising sun.\n\nJust as their third album, the classic Heaven Tonight, hit the streets, Cheap Trick found themselves being welcomed to Japan, Beatlemania-style. This led to a headlining tour, and the recording of a series of shows at the legendary Budokan arena.\n\nThe resulting live project, Cheap Trick at Budokan, was released in the fall of 1978 and was originally intended for a Japanese-only release. Then something happened. Imports started showing up in this country and – what d'ya know? – it started selling. In fact, Cheap Trick at Budokan reportedly became the biggest selling import album of the '70s.\n\nSo, in a classic case of supply and demand, Epic Records released the album here in early 1979 and it just took off. \"I Want You to Want Me,\" an almost quaint little song from In Color, was transformed into a rocked-up guitar raver in concert, and that also helped catch the ear of listeners in the states.\n\nThe success of At Budokan caught everyone by surprise – the label and radio programmers, not to mention the band itself. As it kept selling, the album shot to No. 4, and \"I Want You to Want Me\" to No. 7. It made the Budokan and Cheap Trick household names, and turned the masses on to what the band's die hard fans already knew: This was a great band that needed to be heard.\n\nAlong with \"Surrender,\" this remains the song most identified with the eternally great Cheap Trick, so it finds a rightful home on our list of the Top 100 Classic Rock Songs.\n\n43: Eric Clapton, \"Cocaine\"\n\nApproximately one year following the release of JJ Cale's 1976 record Troubadour, Eric Clapton introduced Cale's song \"Cocaine\" to a much wider audience when he included it on his album Slowhand, released in November 1977.\n\nSlowhand marked a resurgence of sorts for Clapton, arriving after a string of releases failed to live up to the promise heard on 1974's 461 Ocean Boulevard. Driven by a relatively laid-back blues beat, \"Cocaine\" wasn't so much a lyrically based song as it was a somewhat understated showcase of Clapton's superior skill with the guitar.\n\nHis version of \"Cocaine\" runs approximately 53 seconds longer than Cale's, but Clapton's treatment of the track is otherwise faithful, maintaining the same relaxed vibe as the original. Given his ability on the guitar, it should not be terribly surprising to anyone that Clapton chose to showcase his chops and in turn extend the song.\n\n\"Cocaine\" would not be Clapton's biggest hit by any means, only reaching the No. 30 position on the Billboard singles charts. Regardless, the song stands proud on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list as arguably one of his finest moments, and a staple of his set list decades after its release.\n\n42: Bad Company, \"Feel Like Makin' Love\"\n\nFollowing the massive success of their self-titled debut record, England's Bad Company certainly had their work cut out for them when the time came around to crafting the dreaded sophomore follow-up. Fortunately for the band, 1975 Straight Shooter featured \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" the song that has landed on our list of Top 100 Classic Rock Songs.\n\nThe song starts with an acoustic guitar, sounding somewhat similar to Led Zeppelin, who signed the band to their Swan Song label. Vocalist Paul Rodgers sounds almost wistful and rather restrained, considering what we know of his full potential power. Gentle vocal harmonies keep \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" on track before guitarist Mick Ralphs kicks the distortion pedal on in time for the anthemic, yet simplistic chorus. Rocket science this was not, yet the track resonated well with their fans. \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" climbed to No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart.\n\nKid Rock is one of the more recent artists to have covered \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" including the song on his self-titled release of 2003. But he didn't have quite as much luck on the charts as the originators of the song did, peaking at No. 33.\n\n41: Heart, \"Barracuda\"\n\nThe May 1977 release of Heart's second album, Little Queen, should’ve been an unqualified triumph. The Pacific Northwest band had become superstars in Canada and the U.S. during the previous year on the strength of their Mushroom Records-released debut, Dreamboat Annie and its hit singles, \"Crazy On You\" and \"Magic Man.\"\n\nBut Little Queen arrived around the same time as the odds ‘n’ ends collection Magazine, an LP in retaliation after the band left Mushroom. Relations between the two camps had soured in recent times, partly because of the publication of an ad which insinuated the band’s principals, sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson, had an incestuous relationship.\n\nThe incident was just one in a long line of sexist experiences the siblings faced as Heart’s fame increased. \"Barracuda\" sprang from the anger Ann Wilson felt about this misogyny – and specifically, one backstage encounter with a “real slimeball guy.”\n\n“He just felt the need to say really denigrating things to us, because we were women, right?” she said in a 2007 A&E interview. “We were new into the business at that time, and it hit us right between the eyes, that we were going to meet a lot more people like this. It was really a feeling of rage I felt; I felt sort of trapped and really insulted.”\n\n\"Barracuda\" certainly reflects that rage: Stacked, Zeppelin-esque riffs rumble with the power of a buffalo stampede in tandem with the galloping drumming and her powerhouse voice – an instrument that’s simultaneously operatic, twang-touched and blues-based. When she spits out “barracuda”—or “And if the real thing don't do the trick / You better make up something quick / You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick” — her contempt is evident.\n\nBut \"Barracuda\" is also effective because it’s subtle. Underneath the barreling top layer, sustained guitar flourishes add flickers of unease. And the song’s lyrics are metaphorical rather than direct: The Wilson sisters are referred to obliquely as the porpoise and me, and by the end of the song swim far away from the jerk which insulted them.\n\nHeart's entry onto our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list has lost none of its power over the years. In fact, as a long-time staple of Heart’s live shows, it became a showcase for still-underrated guitarist Nancy Wilson, who traditionally takes the spotlight as she strikes the strident opening chords.\n\n40: Fleetwood Mac, \"Go Your Own Way\"\n\nFleetwood Mac's legendary 1977 record Rumours has sold more than 19 million copies in the U.S. alone, and that's partially driven by the song featured at No. 40 on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list.\n\nA warts-and-all tale of real-life relationship break-downs within the band – yes, more than one, at the same time – Rumours has stood the test of time largely based around the honesty of tracks like \"Go Your Own Way.\" The lyrics find author and guitarist Lindsay Buckingham ruminating on where things might have went wrong with his bandmate and ex-love Stevie Nicks. Ultimately, he concludes if she doesn't like what he has to offer, well, the door's right over there.\n\nIronically, for a song that classic rock radio has almost played to death, it seems to be more revered nowadays than it was at the time of its original release. Looking at the Billboard chart for the week of March 12, 1977 when \"Go Your Own Way\" peaked at the No. 10 position, both Mary McGregor's \"Torn Between Two Lovers\" and Kenny Nolan's \"I Like Dreamin'\" somehow charted ahead of Fleetwood Mac.\n\nChances are that if you were to approach any random stranger on the street, they would be more likely to have heard \"Go Your Own Way\" that either of those other two tracks.\n\n39: Dire Straits, \"Sultans of Swing\"\n\n\"Sultans of Swing\" was Dire Straits’ debut single. Let that sink in: This fully-formed, blues-drenched tune was the first many heard from Mark Knopfler and company.\n\nIts appeal was evident long before \"Sultans of Swing\" hit No. 4 on the Billboard singles chart in 1979, or our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list. After all, a 1977 demo version of the song reportedly earned the band a record deal.\n\nKnopfler’s speak-sing delivery, a laissez-faire drawl reminiscent of Tom Petty and Lou Reed, contributes little in the way of emotion. Instead, snaky guitars – including a twang-dusted bridge that underscores Knopfler’s fluid, effortless playing – tell the tune’s story: a love letter to a bar band called the Sultans of Swing, who live and die for the weekend gigs where they can forget day jobs and immerse themselves in their tunes.\n\nMore specifically, the literal approach to the lyrics is subtle and clever. After Knopfler sings, “Check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords,” he strikes a few deliberate changes; after the next line, “Mind he’s strictly rhythm, he doesn’t want to make it cry or sing,” he plays a bluesy riff that’s, well, very rhythmic.\n\nIt’s brilliant: Dire Straits may not be the Sultans, but they understand the mindset of journeymen who play strictly for the love of music – and so they can be the mouthpiece for all of those who are “saving it up for Friday night.”\n\n38: Paul McCartney, \"Live and Let Die\"\n\nThe year 1973 was busy for former Beatles star Paul McCartney. April saw the release of his album Red Rose Speedway Then the stand-alone single song \"Live and Let Die\" – written for the James Bond movie of the same name – garnered McCartney one of his biggest hits ever. The No. 38 finisher in our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs countdown was then followed by Band on the Run.\n\nUnlike much that McCartney had released to date, \"Live and Let Die\" starts with a hushed introduction featuring piano and McCartney's doubled-up vocals, but an entirely different dynamic comes into play after the first verse. At this point, a bombastic run of strings and orchestral instruments brings 007-approved action movie drama to the proceedings, before making another surprising move, into a pseudo-reggae bridge. It was, to say the very least, an interesting mash-up of musical styles, and one that only a talented and studied artist like McCartney could pull off with such flying colors.\n\nIn what could have been the ultimate tribute, Weird Al Yankovic had approached McCartney with the idea of writing a parody of the song that he was going to call \"Chicken Pot Pie.\" McCartney, a staunch vegetarian, reportedly declined Yankovic permission based on his beliefs. Otherwise, many bands have covered the track since its release. Arguably most successful of these was the version by fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees Guns N' Roses, whose cover appeared on 1991's Use Your Illusion I.\n\n37: Elton John, \"Rocket Man\"\n\nElton John's \"Rocket Man\" is not the first classic rock song about a lonely dude drifting through space. Hell, it may not even be the best, although a debate on the merits of this track versus David Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" (found later on this Top 100 Classic Rock Songs list) is a conversation for another day.\n\nWhat sets \"Rocket Man\" apart also happens to be what makes the music of John and his songwriting partner, lyricist Bernie Taupin, stand the test of time, fads, and fading fame. Elton and Bernie practice a unique division of labor: Taupin writes lyrics almost as stand-alone poetry, with an eye toward the rhythms of pop music. Then Elton sits at a piano with a pile of these lyrics and writes the music. Some of their biggest hits have emerged after just a half-hour or less at the piano, and if he can't find the hook quickly, Elton will simply walk away.\n\nTaupin's lyrics for \"Rocket Man\" emphasize the personal over the sci-fi. The astronaut's wife packs his bags; Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids. John's melody underscores the words with a melancholy, wistful tone, while the production brings in a light element of futuristic sheen, never abandoning that fragile, perfect melody.\n\nWould the song be as successful if Elton John had the skill to write lyrics and melody? Perhaps. But it might not accomplish its emotional goals with quite as much grace.\n\n36: The Allman Brothers Band, \"Ramblin' Man\"\n\nUntil the time of their 1973 smash \"Ramblin' Man,\" the Allman Brothers Band had largely been centered on siblings Duane and Gregg Allman. The years since the breakthrough success of the group's 1971 live album At Filmore East, however, were anything but kind.\n\nThey lost both guitarist Duane Allman and bassist Berry Oakley in separate motorcycle accidents barely a year apart, and many probably wondered if the Allmans would ever recover. The answer, in the form of 1973's Brothers and Sisters, was a clear \"yes.\" \"Ramblin' Man\" becoming one of the Allman Brothers Band's most beloved tunes, earning a spot on our Top 100 Classic Rock Songs.\n\nIn response to the tragedies that had unfolded, Allmans guitarist Dickey Betts step"
