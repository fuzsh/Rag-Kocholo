Her resounding impact led her to a major label deal with Warner Bros. UK, a pioneering move at the time. Songs like “Twisted”, “Automatic”, and the iconic “Free” have solidified her as a dance music legend, and in 2016, Billboard recognized her as the 12th most successful dance artist of all time. Collaborations with artists spanning genres, from Lenny Kravitz to NERVO, underscore her remarkable versatility, while her recent ventures, including the Top 5 podcast “The History of the World Greatest Nightclubs”, reflect her ongoing influence and dynamism.
