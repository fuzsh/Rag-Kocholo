        "text": "YANOFSKY, Nikki\n\nBorn: Nicole Rachel Yanofsky on February 8, 1994 in Montreal, Québec.\n\nJazz-Pop singer Nikki Yanofsky began her professional singing career at the age of 12 with a performance at the 2006 Montreal International Jazz Festival. She was the youngest artist ever to headline there. That title was also given to her when she became the youngest artist ever to record for Verve Records in 2007. She recorded a cover of the Ella Fitzgerald song “Air Mail Special” on the tribute album ‘We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song.’ The song “Gotta Go My Own Way” – in both English and French – was recorded for the movie soundtrack to Disney’s ‘High School Musical 2.’ Next up was a collaboration with Herbie Hancock and will.i.am on “Stompin’ At The Savoy”. On Yanofsky’s 14th birthday in 2008 , Nikki Yanofsky head out on a multi-city tour with Marvin Hamlisch beginning at New York’s Carnegie Hall. Finally, in September 2008, Nikki Yanofsky released her debut album – a live CD/DVD entitled ‘Ella…Of Thee I Swing.’ Two JUNO Award nominations followed in 2009 – one for ‘New Artist of the Year’ and the other for ‘Vocal Jazz Album of the Year.’ Meanwhile, she won ‘Favourite Jazz Artist’ at the 2009 Canadian Independent Music Awards. Yanofsky would then sing CTV’s broadcast theme for the 2010 Winter Olympics called “I Believe”, reaching No.1 on the Canadian Hot 100 the week of February 27, 2010 and the digital single was certified quadruple Platinum by April 2010. Yanofsky’s sophomore release, ‘Nikki,’ was released in April 2010 through Decca Records. A JUNO nomination followed for ‘Vocal Jazz Album of the Year.’ She would go on to win the WAVE Smooth Jazz Award for ‘Female Vocalist of the Year.’ Yanofsky’s ‘Little Secret’ tour began on June 21, 2013 followed by the release of the Quincy Jones produced ‘Little Secret’ album May 2014. Her ‘Solid Gold’ EP – a collaborating with Wyclef Jean – was released on September 30, 2016. During the summer of 2020, Nikki Yanofsky released her third studio album ‘Turn Down The Sound’ followed by the album ‘Nikki By Starlight’ in October 2022.\n\nSingles\n\n2008 Lullaby of Birdland (A440 Entertainment)\n\n2009 I Got Rhythm (A440 Entertainment)\n\n2010 I Believe (Universal)\n\n2010 Cool My Heels (A440 Entertainment)\n\n2010 For Another Day (Decca/Universal – EU)\n\n2014 Something New (A440 Entertainment)\n\n2014 Necessary Evil (A440 Entertainment)\n\n2016 Young Love (A440 Entertainment)\n\n2016 Miss You When I’m Drunk (A440 Entertainment)\n\n2018 Big Mouth\n\n2018 Mistletoe\n\n2019 Blowin’ Smoke\n\n2020 Forget (eOne)\n\n2020 Nerve (eOne)\n\n2020 Loner (eOne)\n\n2020 Comes Love (eOne)\n\n2020 I Get A Kick Out Of You (eOne)\n\n2020 Crazy He Calls Me” [feat.

The band recorded material for Sidewalk Records (who released the material in 1966) which landed them a deal with Warner Brothers. The group recorded a handful of tracks and managed to squeeze out two singles before splitting up; Warners would release a third single and a compilation album in 1967 following the meteoric success of the Mamas & Papas and Yanovsky’s next band. Yanovsky would join forces with singer-songwriter folk artist Sebastian in New York City in 1964. They began playing the Greenwich Village coffee houses before forming a proper band in 1965 with Joe Butler (drums) and Steve Boone (bass) called The Lovin’ Spoonful (named after a Mississippi John Hurt song). The group demoed four songs for Elektra Records in early 1965, but the band ended up signing with Kama Sutra Records by the spring. They began recording for the label with producer Erik Jacobsen. Their first single, “Do You Believe In Magic”, was released in July 1965 and peaked at No.9 on the Billboard singles chart that year and No.3 on the CHUM Chart in Canada. The follow-up single, “You Didn’t Have To Be So Nice”, also went Top10 in early 1966 in the US and No.13 in Canada. The band was on a streak and they topped the charts with “Daydream” (No.2 in the US), “Did You Ever Have To Make Up Your Mind” (No.2 in the Us), “Jug Band Music” (No. 3 in Canada) and their lone No.1 hit in North America “Summer in the City” by August 1966. The Lovin’ Spoonful would rack up seven Top 10 hits in the United States and seven Top10 hits in Canada (not necessarily with the same songs) between September 1965 and November 1968. The band recorded five albums plus two movie soundtracks for Woody Allen’s ‘What’s Up, Tiger Lily?’ and Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘You’re a Big Boy Now’. In 1966, Yanovsky was faced with deportation after he was arrested with bassist Steve Boone for possession of marijuana while in San. They handed the name of their drug dealer over to police who was arrested instead – but it hurt their reputation with fans who considered the group hip. As the band’s fame, fortunes and lifestyles brought stresses to the band, Yanovsky was voted out of the band in 1967 amid internal conflicts, but remained friends with the band members. He soon embarked on a solo career and released the album ‘Alive and Well in Argentina’ on Buddah Records in 1968. The Lovin’ Spoonful itself imploded that year after one more album. The original members would reunite in 1980 for a cameo in the Paul Simon music film ‘One-Trick Pony’. They would do so again when The Lovin’ Spoonful was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. Back in Canada, Yanovsky did some television work before going into the restaurant business and opening the acclaimed Chez Piggy eatery in Kingston, Ontario. Yanovsky died in December 2002 only six days before his 58th birthday.\n\nSingles\n\n1968 As Long As You’re Here/Ereh Er’uoy Sa Gnol Sa (Buddah) 12\n\nwith THE LOVIN’ SPOONFUL\n\n1965 Bald Headed Lena/On the Road Again (Kama Sutra) KA-200\n\n1965 Do You Believe in Magic/On the Road Again (Kama Sutra) KA-201\n\n1965 You Didn’t Have to Be So Nice/My Gal (Kama Sutra) KA-205\n\n1966 Daydream/Night Owl Blues (Kama Sutra) KA-208\n\n1966 Did You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind?/Didn’t Want to Have to Do It (Kama Sutra) KA-209\n\n1966 Jugband Music [4 song EP] (Kama Sutra) KEP-301\n\n1966 Summer in the City/Butchie’s Tune (Kama Sutra) KA-211\n\n1966 Rain on the Roof/Pow (Kama Sutra) KA-216\n\n1966 Nashville Cats/Full Measure (Kama Sutra) KA-219\n\n1967 Darling Be Home Soon/Darlin’ Companion (Kama Sutra) KA-220\n\n1967 Six O’Clock/You’re a Big Boy Now (Kama Sutra) KA-225\n\n1967 You’re a Big Boy Now/Lonely (Amy’s Theme) (Kama Sutra)\n\n1967 Day Blues [4 song EP] (Kama Sutra) KEP-303\n\n1967 She Is Still a Mystery/Only Pretty, What a Pity (Kama Sutra) KA-239\n\n1967 Money/Close Your Eyes (Kama Sutra) KA-241\n\n1967 Something In the Night [4 song EP] (Kama Sutra) KEP-306\n\nwith THE MUGWUMPS\n\n1964 Searchin’/So Fine (Warner Bros.)

They both began playing guitar in 1964, and in 1968 left for Montreal to form the group Mum with Sudbury drummer pal Don Gaudry. They eventually were joined by Montreal vocalist Heather Woodburn (see Tapestry). Heather left in 1969 and was replaced by a Sudbury pal, guitarist/vocalist Marcel Trudeau. The group name was changed to “Brothers And Others”. After a trip to Memphis to record some demos, and opening for a Montreal appearance of Andy Kim, and Gary Puckett And The Union Gap, they disbanded in the summer of 1969. Yates was formed in the late 1970 when the Yates brothers signed to do a single with Capitol Records in New York City. They called some Toronto friends, Leiher and Cossaboom, and Sarnia guitarist Jim Chevalier (ex-Grass Company), to come to New York to do the single recording session with them. Their single, “I’m Only Country”, was a country song written by Larry and side B was a pop rock tune co-written with brother Bill. It was released in Canada and the U.S. in the fall of 1970 to good reviews, but overall success did not follow. They rehearsed in the Catskill Mountains, did a couple of gigs in the New York area before returning to play in southern Ontario. They briefly took on the name Police (the British band of that name was unknown at that time) before disbanding in the summer of 1971; Leiher retired in Orillia and Cossaboom returned to his home town of Sarnia where he formed “Big Sky Music Publishing” and continues with his musical efforts; After Yates, Bill Yates was forced to retire after being diagnosed with schizophrenia; Jim Chevalier would go on to join Leve Heads before striking out on his own as a solo artist; Larry Yates studied electrical technology at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute for a couple of years before getting day work and playing bass with a Toronto gospel group The Tymes which evolved into a gospel trio Expressions Of Joy. In 1979 Larry registered his own company Start Records and recorded a pop/country/folk LP of original songs entitled ‘At the Gate’. He returned to music full time in 1980, writing songs and performing at cafes and bars across Ontario before retiring in 1987. Since 1998 he has been a Hearing Instrument Specialist, testing hearing, selling and servicing hearing aids, and playing in a gospel band at church. with notes from Larry Yates.

She began singing and writing professionally at the age of 19 in the Punk/New Wave band The Last Resorts. They played legendary Toronto clubs such as The Turning Point and Larry’s Hideaway and a career highlight for the band was opening for Teenage Head. Yates then formed Rang Tango who are recognized as pioneers of alternative country/cowpunk music especially in Canada. Scooped up by Sony Nashville as a solo artist, her debut album and single ‘Can’t Stop the Girl’ was released worldwide in 1989 and managed to find a place on the Billboard charts. She toured with Dwight Yoakum, Steve Earle, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Big Sugar. One of her first introductions to Nashville was a 2 A.M. demo session at Cowboy Jack Clements’s studio which was produced by Bob Johnston (Bob Dylan’s ‘Nashville Skyline’, Johnny Cash’s ‘Live at San Quentin’). Marty Stuart played mandolin and Roy Husky Jr. played stand-up bass. Yates also recorded a duet in Los Angeles with Gregg Allman (Allman Bros.) for a Patrick Swayze movie ‘Next of Kin” which was produced by David Kershenbaum (Tracy Chapman). In 1993, she signed to Virgin Music Canada and released ‘Breaking Point’ which was a collection of roots, rock and soul. The album was produced by Colin Linden and featured contributions from Rick Danko (The Band) and Jim Cuddy (Blue Rodeo) on vocals. Following the album’s release she toured with Blue Rodeo, Jann Arden, Colin James and Faith Hill. Her efforts were rewarded with a nominated for a JUNO Award and a CCMA award. In 1996, Yates released her second Virgin Music CD ‘Untogether’ which was a complete artistic departure when she teamed up with trip-hop trio Opium Concepts to create more ethereal soundscapes. She also did work on the TV show ‘Forever Knight’ co-writing songs with Fred Mollin and Stan Meissner for two soundtracks in 1996 and 1999. Returning to her roots, she formed the cowpunk band Hey Stella! in 1998. The release of their debut CD, garnered them the designation of No.1 band in Toronto’s NOW magazine annual readers poll. The band also featured veteran players Bazil Donovan (Blue Rodeo), David Baxter (Sherry Kean), and Michelle Josef. Hey Stella! continued to be active on the club and festival circuit. In 2001, Yates and her family moved to Hamilton, Ontario where she took up residency at the Corktown nightclub playing solo acoustic. This inspired a prolific period of songwriting that informed her next solo release ‘The Book of Minerva’ in 2007. Yates won Hamilton Music Awards in 2007 for ‘Songwriter of the Year’ and ‘Alternative Country Recording of the Year’. She is currently playing with Brian Griffith (Daniel Lanois) and Pete Sisk (Good Brothers) and is a member of the band The Nashville Rejects. She runs a songwriting workshop, is writing a novel and occasionally performs a stand-up comedy routine. with notes from Lori Yates. [also see RANG TANGO, HEY!

His grandfather, Norman Yellowbird Chief Elder of the Samson Cree Nation had been a hand-drum singer so music was a natural fit for the young Yellowbird. His popularity as a singer grew, and he started winning competitions. At 24 he was signed to a management deal with Louis O’Reilly. His strong work ethic as a live performer allowed him to release his debut album ‘Life Is Calling My Name’ in October 2006. The album spawned four singles: “Beautiful Concept,” “They’re All About You,” “Pickup Truck” and “I Remember The Music.” Yellowbird would take home three awards from the Aboriginal People’s Choice Music Awards in November 2006 for ‘Best New Artist,’ ‘Single of the Year’ (“Beautiful Concept”) and ‘Best Video’ (“Beautiful Concept”). In 2007, he toured Canada as the opening act for Emerson Drive. Also that year he represented Canada at the Fourth Annual Global Artist Party during the CMA Music Festival. Chevrolet also named Yellowbird as the ‘Chevy Trucks Rising Star of the Year’ at the 2007 CCMA’S. During the summer of 2007, the song “Pickup Truck” became his first Top 5 song on the Canadian Country Singles chart. It made it to No. 64 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart, while the video topped the CMT Chevy Top 20. Yellowbird returned to the Aboriginal People’s Choice Music Awards and was named the Aboriginal Entertainer of the Year for 2007. He also took home awards for ‘Best Country Album’ and ‘Album Of The Year’ (‘Life Is Calling My Name’), ‘Best Music Video’ (“Pickup Truck”), and ‘Best Male Artist.’ In 2008 he was nominated for ‘Country Recording of the Year’ (‘Life Is Calling My Name’) at the JUNO Awards. In 2009, Yellowbird performed at the Grand Ole Opry – only one of three Indigenous artists to ever do so – where he met fellow singer and stutterer, Mel Tillis. His sophomore release, ‘It’s About Time’ came out in November 2009 and featured the lead-off track “Bare Feet on the Blacktop”. The Native American Music Association in US nominated the video for the song, and he would win ‘Best Country Recording’ (‘Life Is Calling My Name’) in 2011 followed in 2012 with the same award for ‘It’s About Time.’ Yellowbird died on April 25, 2022, in Calgary, Alberta due to complications from epilepsy.\n\nSingles\n\n2005 Beautiful Concept (306)\n\n2006 They’re All About You (306)\n\n2007 Pickup Truck (306)\n\n2007 I Remember the Music (306)\n\n2008 Drive Me Home (306)\n\n2008 Life Is Calling My Name (306)\n\n2009 Bare Feet on the Blacktop\n\n2010 Watching You Walk Away\n\n2010 I Get That A Lot These Days\n\n2011 I Can Help You With That\n\n2012 Sedona Arizona\n\n2013 I’m Not Wearing Boots Today\n\nAlbums\n\n2006 Life Is Calling My Name (306)\n\n2009 It’s About Time (On Ramp/EMI) R2009-003\n\nYOHAWKS, The\n\nBrad Campbell (bass, vocals) / Brian Asselin (saxophone) / Brian Bradfield (drums) / Dave Arthur (trombone) / Dave Poulin (lead vocals) / Ian Clyne (keyboards) / Keith Richardson (vocals, guitar) / Mark Ferguson (trombone, piano) / Mike Tremblay (saxophone) / Nicholas Dyson (trumpet) / Peter Beaudoin (drums) / Raymond Lemaire (organ)\n\nIn 2004 former members of the Ottawa band The Five D – Bradfield, Campbell, Richardson and Poulin – reformed to jam in Poulin’s studio but not without purpose.

When their former light and soundman phoned to tell the band that the Vancouver scene was where they should be they went to see a psychiatrist, figuring that life on the road could be made or broken by their ability to get along. At the time they were a five piece and relocated to Vancouver in 1988 where the crammed into a recording/rehearsal spot which acted as a communal home. Cook, Roe and Churchill took odd jobs to make ends meet but the keyboardist and drummer returned to St. John’s. Former drummer Alex MacFarlane was studying jazz in Toronto when he got the call to join the act – which he did. The band got their break after a lousy gig that paid $51.00 in gate receipts where the lighting man turned them onto manager Cliff Jones (Payolas, BLVD, Idle Eyes). With their demo in hand he was able to line them up a gig opening for Juno winner Sue Medley. While in Toronto opening for Bob Dylan, Medley spoke to Corky Laing and Bob Ansell at Polygram to check out The Young Saints. Polygram scooped them up after an impromptu audition in the band’s shed and in the early weeks of 1991 the band entered the studio with Corky Laing the same day the Gulf War broke out. The depressing news entering the studio led to the writing of the band’s “My God Is Bigger Than Your God” from their self-titled debut. Guest appearances featured Randy Bachman and Sue Medley. The album spawned three singles – “Weight off the World” which peaked at No.6 on Canadian AOR charts; “Live For Today” (with Randy Bachman) which went Top 20 on AOR charts; and “New Solution” which cracked the Canadian Top40. All three singles featured Roy Pike (Bootsauce, Chalk Circle, Sue Medley) produced videos. A tour across Canada with the likes of Glass Tiger, Tragically Hip, and BTO involved driving by van – sometimes non-stop from Nanaimo, British Columbia to St.John’s, Newfoundland in 72 hours straight. Despite the miles of road weariness and two JUNO Award nominations (‘Best New Group’ and ‘Best Artwork/Design’ for Robert Lebouef) the band never made a second album.

The band released a 7″ four song EP called, simply, ‘The White EP’ in 1977 as they performed alongside such notorious acts as The Viletones, Teenage Head and The Ugly among other notables. With several line-up changes the band continued developing its unique cross of King Crimson-inspired art-punk which led to the release of a 12″ 1979’s four song follow-up called ‘The Black EP’ — which contained the 7″ single as a free bonus. That same year the band would achieve its biggest claim to fame when they were immortalized on film and record for their performance as part of the ‘The Last Pogo’ movie and soundtrack recording. But, by the following year, John Paul Young yearned for a more stable and reliable format to produce his music and went solo at which time he performed all his own instrumentation in a new set of recordings in 1980 entitled ‘The Life of Ermie Scub’ which won a CASBY Award. The band reunited for The Edge’s brief resurrection and anniversary celebration April 26, 1981. Recordings from this performance were released as a live album in 1982 before the band split up for good. John Paul Young is a successful actor in many Canadian television productions such as ‘Earth: Final Conflict’ and movies such as ‘Sanctuary’ & ‘Sabotage’, as well as contributing to movie soundtracks such as ‘The Gate’ and ‘Metal Messiah’. He has since resurrected the Cardboard Brains on several occasions for club dates in Toronto, initially to coincide with the John Paul Young And Cardboard Brains ‘best of’ compilation CD, and then in 2000 as a prelude to a possible new Cardboard Brains recording project. The album never materialized and Young would spend time acting in Europe before returning to Canada to care for an ailing parent. with notes from JPY.

Like most teenagers in the 1950’s, Young was very influenced by the music coming out of the US and decided to pick up a guitar. Between late 1960 and 1966 he was a member of such bands as the Jades, the Esquires, the Stardusters, the Classics, several different versions of the Squires, the High Flying Birds, several versions of 4 To Go, and the Mynah Birds. In 1963 he recorded two songs with the Squires, “The Sultan” and “Aurora”, which was released as a single locally in 1963 on V Records. The Squires played coffee houses in the Winnipeg area, and one of those gigs was opening for The Company, which featured two people with whom Young would later form pivotal relationships – Stephen Stills and Richie Furay. Young moved to back to Toronto after the Squires split up in 1965, and formed a band with bassist Bruce Palmer, the Mynah Birds. The Mynahs played around the Yorkville area of Toronto for awhile, during which time they also recorded some material, but quickly realized that if they wanted to move ahead musically it would be best if they joined the burgeoning Los Angeles scene, so they moved to L.A. in late 1965. Driving around sightseeing they ran into Stills and Furay again, and the four of them decided to form a band. They called it Buffalo Springfield, and it featured Young (vocals, piano, lead guitar), Stills (vocals, 2nd lead guitar), Furay (vocals, rhythm guitar), Palmer (bass), and Dewey Martin (vocals, drums). They toured the area for awhile, then went into the studio in the fall of 1966 to record the first album. Between that time and May 1968, they recorded two more albums, and did three more tours (these being cross-country) during which time Palmer was arrested on drug charges and deported to Canada. Jim Messina, who went on to be part of the Loggins and Messina duo, was brought in to fill his spot. Messina produced the third and last Buffalo Springfield album, and the band split up in 1968. In late 1968 Young recorded his first solo album. The self-titled album for Reprise Records was released in November 1968; He has also pursued music for films, including his own movie, ‘Journey Through the Past’ in 1972 (Warner Bros.), and doing arrangements of seven public domain songs for the soundtrack of ‘Where the Buffalo Roam’ (1980, on Backstreet/ MCA). After doing a solo tour of Canada in early 1969 to promote first solo album, he met a band called the Rockets that featured, among others, Danny Whitten (guitar), Billy Talbot (bass) and Ralph Molina (drums); he convinced these three to join him and together they formed Crazy Horse. They first recorded together in early 1969 and their first album, ‘Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere’, was released in May 1969; it contained the hit singles “Down By the River” and “Cinnamon Girl”. While they were recording the album they toured the east coast, and their first full tour was in 1970. Since the release of that first Crazy Horse album, they’ve released 12 more albums, touring sporadically to support them. Of these albums, some are considered some of Young’s finest works, including ‘Rust Never Sleeps’ and ‘Re-ac-tor’. With Crazy Horse, Young also scored a film, “Landlord”. Such is the status of this band that when they get back together to record and tour, it is a musical event of epic proportions. By 1969, Crosby Stills and Nash had achieved some national success with their first album, but felt they would like to augment their sound with a fourth vocalist. Stephen Stills brought in his old friend Young, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (CSNY) was born. This band situation was always meant to be an informal situation for the four singers, so that the individual members could always pursue other work and projects. Still, they toured as CSNY in mid-1969, and in the latter half of that year recorded their first album, ‘Déjà vu’, which was released in March 1970. Since then they have released four more albums, including the successful reunion album, American Dream, in 1988, which spawned the hit single of the title track. In 1970 Young had two solo songs (“Down By the River”, “The Loner”) and a CSNY song (“Helpless”) on the soundtrack for “Strawberry Statement” (MGM) and in 1976 Stills and Young also released an album under the moniker of the Stills/Young Band. Young’s career has been vast and prolific, with commercially and critically successful tours and albums solo, with Crazy Horse and CSNY. He had a solo hit single in 1970 with “Southern Man”, about his impression of life in the southern USA, which prompted Lynyrd Skynyrd to record and release a rebuttal, “Sweet Home, Alabama”; while most people thought that Young and Skynyrd were mortal enemies after this, Young in fact worked with wrote a number of songs for them after all was said and done. In 1971 he did some work on David Crosby’s first solo album, If Only I Could Remember My Name, which kicked off Young’s hobby of appearing on other people’s works, including releases from the Monkees, Emmylou Harris, Nils Lofgren, Warren Zevon, Robbie Robertson, Tracy Chapman, and Randy Bachman, amongst others. One song on the Crazy Horse album ‘Zuma’ (1975), “Cortez the Killer”, was banned in Spain because it offended General Franco’s regime. In 1983 he did an album of original and R&B classics with the Shocking Pinks (Ben “King” Keith – alto sax, lead guitar; Tim Drummond – upright bass; Karl Himmel – snare; Larry Byrom – piano, backing vocals; Anthony Crawford and Rick Palombi – backing vocals). In 1985 he came home to Toronto to participate in Canada’s contribution to Ethiopian famine relief, “Tears Are Not Enough” by Northern Lights (when told by producer David Foster that perhaps his one solo line was slightly off-key and asked to perhaps do it again, Young paused for a second and replied laconically, “That’s my style, man!”), which was eventually included on the American LP, ‘We Are The World’, by USA For Africa. In 1986 this first Neil Young compilation CD was released in Europe called ‘Greatest Hits’, but contained radio edits of his most popular songs causing Young to issue a removal order with his former label Reprise. The disc is now quite rare. In 1995 he released an album with Seattle stalwarts Pearl Jam, called Mirror Ball, but for contractual reasons, Pearl Jam was not allowed to be listed AS Pearl Jam, so the members were simply listed as backing musicians. In his entire career, Young has handled most of his own production duties, with his solo material as well as with his band projects. However, he has also worked with a dizzying array of producers, including Ahmet Ertegun, Jim Messina, Ry Cooder, David Crosby, Brian Wilson, Stephen Stills, and Danny Kortchmar, to name only a very few. The list of musicians he has recorded with is a veritable who’s who of the international music community, attesting to the level of respect the industry has for the Toronto native. His 1997 album ‘Year of the Horse’ was a live album from the tour Crazy Horse did following the release of their last studio effort ‘Broken Arrow’ (1996); Young has spent the intervening years releasing more straight-ahead solo releases – many with political leanings particularly related to the United States — and reunited Crazy Horse in 2003 to back him on his ‘Greendale’ album project. They have recorded half a dozen releases since; On December 30, 2009, Neil Young was awarded the Order Of Canada; Young has also been supporter of the technology of music formats (flipping flopping on the pros and cons of digital downloading). He fully embraced Blu-Ray technology and has been using the archival format to release collections of previously unreleased outtakes, rarities and live recordings. On November 3, 2023, Neil Young & Crazy Horse played to 200 people in a secret show at the Rivoli in Toronto as a warm up for the promotion of the album ‘World Records.’ with notes from Rick “Fred” Geiger, and Greg Simpson.

The band was signed to US label Sussex in 1971 and recorded their material in Detroit, Michigan which disqualified them as Canadian Content under the CRTC’s 1971 airplay rules. However, their debut single “Understanding Is Sorrow” – which only featured Mike Lehman and US session players from the Funk Brothers – reached No.57 on the RPM Top100 Singles chart in September 1971. The surprise hit required a touring act and Copperpenny’s guitarist Vern McDonald was lured away and also became a contributing writer in the band. Their follow-up singles, all produced by Dennis Coffey & Mike Theodore for Sussex Records, failed to chart; Zawadzki became a songwriter and producer with his own Black Forest Band; Lehman would go on to a solo career; Rick Lamb would join Hellfield. He succumbed to cancer in 2004. with notes from Ted Zawadzki, Alan Dunbrook, Ed Miller, and Brian Tozer.
