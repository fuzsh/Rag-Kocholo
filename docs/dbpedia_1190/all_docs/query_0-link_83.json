His voice is gender-bending, gripping, chilling and classic. His words describes the physical sensation of the impending end of a relationship.\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nAye Nako, \"Leaving The Body\"\n\nIn its glorious opening minute, \"Leaving The Body\" could be a song about anything. By its closing notes it has become a survivor's tale stark enough to turn that triumphant intro menacing on a second listen.\n\n– Daoud Tyler-Ameen\n\nBeach House, \"Levitation\"\n\nA winsome tone-setter for band that's long since mastered the art of buzzy, sweetly nostalgic dream-pop.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nBeach House, \"One Thing\"\n\nA career highlight revs the engine on the Baltimore band's dreamy formula, with a perfect Dean Wareham-soundalike guitar solo at the end.\n\n– Jacob Ganz\n\nBeauty Pill, \"Afrikaner Barista\"\n\nTake a surreal funk song, work it, then flip it and reverse it into a kaleidoscope of sound.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nBenjamin Clementine, \"Nemesis\"\n\nThe once homeless street busker with an unforgettable voice signs with Universal, wins the Mercury Prize and, on this heart-stopper, asks us to remember life's Golden Rule.\n\n– Robin Hilton\n\nThe Big Moon, \"The Road\"\n\nIf we're really gonna get any deeper into a '90s/grunge revival, can we have more alt-pop earcandy like this bit of awesomeness by four young women from London? Incredible guitar + organ melancholia that also rocks.\n\n– Piotr Orlov\n\nBjork, \"Stonemilker\"\n\nThis opening track to Vulnicura, her open-chested document of a relationship's end, is stunning, thoughtful, bitter and questioning in a way only Björk could achieve.\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nBlur, \"Lonesome Street\"\n\nIt is so, so, so, so great to hear Graham Coxon's guitar again.\n\n– Otis Hart\n\nBoots, \"I Run Roulette\"\n\nThis is the most contagious tune from BOOTS' debut album Aquaria, mixing spare and muscular beats that are chilling and revealing.\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nBully, \"I Remember\"\n\nIf you're going to look back, you might as well fit your reminiscences into two huge minutes of white-knuckle rock 'n' roll.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nCar Seat Headrest, \"Something Soon\"\n\nWhat begins as an exploration of Will Toledo's neuroses builds to a fist-in-the-air anthem to conquer all.\n\n– Kate Drozynski\n\nCarroll, \"Green Acres\"\n\nThe perfect \"lying on the couch looking out the window at a cloudy Sunday afternoon\" song.\n\n– Chris Ranck, Delmarva Public Radio\n\nChastity Belt, \"Time To Go Home\"\n\nThis throbbing pile of guitar drone embodies the feeling inside your head right at the point where the party has gone too far.\n\n– Ann Powers\n\nCircuit Des Yeux, \"Do The Dishes\"\n\nBuilt around samples from a Laotian ethnographic record, this is an arpeggiated meditation on the feminism of the everyday.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nCity And Colour, \"Lover Come Back\"\n\nDallas Green's soulful voice carries the listener through equal amounts of joy and lovesick sadness.\n\n– Kyle Smith, WYEP\n\nColleen Green, \"Deeper Than Love\"\n\nDelving into seething insecurities over love and intimacy, Colleen Green masterfully unwinds strings of brutal lyrical honesty, all while maintaining her laconic cool.\n\n– Mike Katzif\n\nCourtney Barnett, \"Depreston\"\n\nA series of mundane observations on a couple's low-rent move to the suburbs reveals a devastating portrait of middling humanity.\n\n– Robin Hilton\n\nCourtney Barnett, \"Pedestrian at Best\"\n\nAs Barnett's thickets of witty words spill out, her band blasts out an anthem worthy of the inevitable Nirvana comparisons.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nDan Deacon, \"Feel the Lightning\"\n\nIf Pee Wee Herman made a record with Brian Eno about fear and anxiety, the result would be close to this electronic cartoon pop tune by the brilliant and fun-loving Dan Deacon.\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nDavid Bowie, \"Blackstar\"\n\nKendrick Lamar inspired this outré ten minutes: free jazz sax, formal strings, liturgical-lethargic vocals over caffeinated, terrible, beautiful rhythms. Dark, monstrous and design-minded, it's like a pop fusion score written for a Guillermo del Toro horror film that doesn't yet exist.\n\n– Jason King\n\nDeerhunter, \"Snakeskin\"\n\nA surprising marriage of swirling psych-funk, self-deprecating lyrics of being boney, homely and lonely. The best music I've heard from Bradford Cox in ages.\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nDestroyer, \"Dream Lover\"\n\nJust in case you were wondering what it would sound like if the E Street Band stumbled into a Dan Bejar session.\n\n– Rachel Horn\n\nDiane Coffee, \"Spring Breathes\"\n\nThis sprawling, ambitious showpiece pays tribute to late '60s psych pop and early '70s glam rock with hairpin turns and gorgeous four-part harmonies.\n\n– Robin Hilton\n\nDiet Cig, \"Breathless\"\n\nCathartic pop-punk with boundless vitality and wide-eyed charm, especially in the way Alex Luciano revels in keen observations on escaping the pull of adulthood responsibilities (like owning a shower curtain) by watching Simpsons DVDs.\n\n– Mike Katzif\n\nDivers, \"Breathless\"\n\nDivers exploded onto the Portland music scene this year on the back of incredibly intense live shows driven by expertly-crafted punk rock anthems, like this song from their debut album Hello Hello.\n\n– Jerad Walker, opbmusic\n\nDowntown Boys, \"Monstro\"\n\nThere is a better future, and these political party sax-punks scream a powerful call-to-arms \"that nothing that they can do can push it away!\"\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nEl Vy, \"Return To The Moon\"\n\nThe National's Matt Berninger gets surprisingly funky and not-so-surprisingly obtuse in his fun side project's first single.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nEskimeaux, \"I Admit I'm Scared\"\n\nThese lines end this delicate yet tornadic tune stuck in my head as a perfect description of late teens/early twenties angst and made it a favorite all year: \"And if I had a dime for every time I'm freaking out we could fly around the world or just get out of your parents' house.\"\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nEzra Furman, \"Restless Year\"\n\nA frenzy of poppy synths, rackety percussion and a throbbing bassline, this song effectively blends Furman's visceral indie rock roots with his newer, glossier throwback sound. But there's no time to pin him down or clasify him anyway — it's just good to be along for the ride.\n\n– Kelsey , The Current\n\nFantastic Negrito, \"Lost in A Crowd\"\n\nThe song that catapulted Xavier Dphrepaulezz and his band to victory in NPR Music's Tiny Desk Concert Contest last year is a blistering, soulful and blues-drenched tune inspired by the struggles of the working poor.\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nFather John Misty, \"Chateau Lobby #4 (in C for Two Virgins)\"\"\n\nIt took a long time for Josh Tillman to craft this brilliant ode to his then-new love, and he struck sonic gold by wrapping his wit and vulnerability in lush strings, mariachi horns and one of the lines of the year: \"What are you doing with your whole life? / How 'bout forever?\" (By the way, she said \"yes.\")\n\n– Carmel Holt, WFUV\n\nThe Front Bottoms, \"Cough It Out\"\n\nBrian Sella's words spill out in bunches as he builds to an evocative and plainspoken confession: \"I am delusional with love.\"\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nG.L.O.S.S., \"Lined Lips and Spiked Bats\"\n\nYou do not want to mess with these trans punks or this seriously pissed-off anthem to smashing the patriarchy.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nGirl Band, \"Paul\"\n\nA scream-of-consciousness steamroller that builds, resets, puts its shoes back on, paces around for a while, shivers, heaves and ramps up again. And again. And again. And\n\n– Jacob Ganz\n\nGirlpool, \"Before The World Was Big\"\n\nThe duo looks back on its youth in vivid, loving-but-ambivalent detail, then builds to something transcendent.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nGun Outfit, \"Gotta Wanna\"\n\nThis L.A. bummer-punk band rides the sweet spot between choogle and apache beat for three and a half zenned-out minutes.\n\n– Otis Hart\n\nHayden, \"No Happy Birthday\"\n\nIndie rock veteran Hayden Desser wrote this song for his non-verbal daughter. One of the legit tearjerkers of 2015.\n\n– Otis Hart\n\nHop Along, \"Waitress\"\n\nThe vocal performance of the year, courtesy of Frances Quinlan, whose ragged pipes added a well-worn familiarity to detailed lyrics about being trapped by bad decisions, circumstance and casual cruelty.\n\n– Jacob Ganz\n\nIsrael Nash, \"L.A. Lately\"\n\nA Harvest era-soundalike for the 21st century that transcends its Laurel Canyon feel from an amazing singer-songwriter.\n\n– Dave Michaels, WEXT\n\nJD McPherson, \"It Shook Me Up\"\n\nDidn't quite accomplish what you meant to do today? Let this song — McPherson's brand of retro rock 'n' soul at its best — express your pain\n\n– Rachel Horn\n\nJohn Grant, \"Grey Tickles, Black Pressure\"\n\nGrant writes the funniest words about the most depressing things. This title-track to his 2015 album makes for a thought-provoking bit of pop sung by such a unique talent.\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nJosh Ritter, \"Getting Ready To Get Down\"\n\nOne of the world's best songwriters. Josh Ritter's story songs feel so real.\n\n– Chris Wienk, WEXT\n\nJulia Holter, \"Feel You\"\n\nA sweeping, string-laden song with a vulnerability buoyed by the delightful way Julia Holter breaks apart the syllables in \"myth-o-lo-gi-cal.\"\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nJulien Baker, \"Sprained Ankle\"\n\nIn two minutes, Baker, still college-aged, entwines the need to create with the way that need can cripple, over a skeletal but radiant backing of voice and guitar.\n\n– Jacob Ganz\n\nKurt Vile, \"Pretty Pimpin\"\n\nThe self-described \"pop jam\" on Kurt Vile's brilliant new album b'lieve i'm goin' down. The wordplay and phrasing in this song completely hooked me from the start.\n\n– Russ Borris, WFUV\n\nLianne La Havas, \"What You Don't Do\"\n\nThere's a place for songs about romantic woes, but sometimes you just need a boundlessly joyful celebration of a happy, secure relationship.\n\n– Rachel Horn\n\nLord Huron, \"Fool For Love\"\n\nA sepia-toned campfire song about battling for honor and a woman's hand in marriage. It does not end well.\n\n– Robin Hilton\n\nMakthaverskan, \"Witness\"\n\nYou can almost hear the blood spill from the Swedish post-punk band's urgent revenge fantasy, especially in Maja Milner's final wail: \"My enemy, I bury you.\"\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nMartha, \"Six Men Getting Sick Six Times (Mendable)\"\n\nOur favorite British pop-punks go acoustic on this touching song about love's recuperative power in the face of a ruthless world.\n\n– Otis Hart\n\nMichael Rault, \"Real Love (Yeah)\"\n\nIf the Cisco Kid was actually a singer-songwriter from Toronto.\n\n– Annie Bartholomew, KXLL\n\nNeon Indian, \"Annie\"\n\nSlick and dirty downtown pop for the unremembered '80s, from a '00s survivor unafraid of playing hard to a new niche.\n\n– Jacob Ganz\n\nPalehound, \"Molly\"\n\nIt's not clear if she's referencing the drug Ecstasy or just a really horrible person, but either way Palehound's Ellen Kempner gets Molly in the crosshairs for a gritty, infectious takedown.\n\n– Robin Hilton\n\nPositive No, \"Pedal Through\"\n\nPositive No's weirdness is balanced by its sweetness in a catchy pop song that's undeniably '90s.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nPrettiots, \"Boys (That I Dated in High School)\"\n\nClever, honest, funny, and well put together — everything my high school boyfriend was not.\n\n– Kate Drozynski\n\nProtomartyr, \"Why Does it Shake?\"\n\nYouthful bravado melts into the uncertainty of aging, and the Detroit band turns the words of a woman in the throes of Alzheimer's disease into a moving, guitar-stoked anthem.\n\n– Greg Kot, Sound Opinions\n\nPWR BTTM, \"1994.0\"\n\nThere's a lot to like here — guitar heroics, Matt Sharp-style synth lines, body glitter — but it all pales in comparison to that golden hook, cracked and wordless and completely unshakeable.\n\n– Daoud Tyler-Ameen\n\nRoyal Headache, \"My Own Fantasy\"\n\nAustralia's Royal Headache has all of the grinding guitar, driving drums and furious energy necessary for a pounding punk song.\n\n– Kate Drozynski\n\nSaintseneca, \"Sleeper Hold\"\n\nA masterful bit of hyper-catchy rock craftsmanship, with bold and searching words to boot.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nSheer Mag, \"Button Up\"\n\nKiller riffs blasted through scuzzy, kicked-in speakers and Tina Halladay's ferocious howl ignite this boogie rocker like a spark on a pool of gasoline.\n\n– Mike Katzif\n\nSleater-Kinney, \"A New Wave\"\n\nLeave it to Janet Weiss to start a song in the middle of a drum fill. We'd probably have celebrated their return no matter what, but it's nice to know Sleater-Kinney still has weird ideas.\n\n– Daoud Tyler-Ameen\n\nSoak, \"Sea Creatures\"\n\nShe's still a teenager, but Irish singer Bridie Monds-Watson already has a firm grasp of the ways the pursuit of love can make you feel like an outsider.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nSpeedy Ortiz, \"Raising The Skate\"\n\nWith equal parts hilarious self-deprecation, wry honesty and ambiguous non sequiturs, Sadie Dupuis fires off an empowering call to arms for anyone who's ever felt underestimated by toxic people in their lives.\n\n– Mike Katzif\n\nSufjan Stevens, \"Fourth Of July\"\n\nThe most devastating song from the year's most heartbreaking album finds the now deceased mother who abandoned Sufjan as child praying he had a good life without her.\n\n– Robin Hilton\n\nSweet Spirit, \"If You Wanna\"\n\nThis Austin band writes catchy tunes that reveal several layers upon repeated listens. Also, I want to go to Mexico RIGHT NOW.\n\n– Matt Reilly, KUTX\n\nThe Tallest Man on Earth, \"Sagres\"\n\nRight out of the gate, this Kristian Matsson song engulfs you with wave after wave of beautifully lush sounds that are perfectly suited to a summer drive.\n\n– Eric Teel, Jefferson Public Radio\n\nTame Impala, \"Let It Happen\"\n\n7 minutes, 46 seconds, and I wish it was longer.\n\n– Mac Wilson, The Current\n\nThunderbitch, \"Wild Child\"\n\nBrittany Howard shows off her unmatchable snarl on a rock 'n' roll stomper that gives voice to all the women who didn't ask your permission, thanks.\n\n– Rachel Horn\n\nTitle Fight, \"Rose of Sharon\"\n\nAs punk still experiences growing pains decades later, Title Fight spits into a dream of flanged guitars and jangly hooks.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nTomas Pagan Motta, \"Up and Away\"\n\nIf the amazing vocal — which conjures up Van Morrison, Tim and Jeff Buckley and somehow, Led Zeppelin — doesn't seduce your spirit, try resisting the alchemy of acoustic guitar, strings and pedal steel.\n\n– Vicky Gregor, KRCC\n\nTorres, \"New Skin\"\n\nThis song, from Mackenzie Scott's second album, Sprinter, channels Patti Smith and PJ Harvey and makes for a jarring song of discovery and fear.\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nUnknown Mortal Orchestra, \"Can't Keep Checking My Phone\"\n\nFrom its Tarantino spaghetti western start to its groovy \"Purple Rain\" end, this single by the Portland-by-way-of-New Zealand band is a cinematic treat for our ears.\n\n– Joni Deutsch, West Virginia Public Broadcasting\n\nVetiver, \"Stranger Still\"\n\nWhen Vetiver's Andy Cabic gets a song right, he really gets it right.\n\n– Otis Hart\n\nWaxahatchee, \"Breathless\"\n\nAn insistent, seeping drone mimicks the stagnant relationship Katie Crutchfield's coolly disdainful lyrics describe.\n\n– Rachel Horn\n\nWilco, \"Magnetized\"\n\nThis cryptic address from a Holden Caulfield-like anti hero is one of the most enigmatic and fascinating moments from an album full of captivating head-scratchers.\n\n– Robin Hilton\n\nWolf Alice, \"Moaning Lisa Smile\"\n\n\"Moaning Lisa Smile\" lures you in sweetly only to reveal its savage side, much like the twisted tale for which the band is named.\n\n– Kate Drozynski\n\nThe World Is A Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid To Die, \"1/10/2014\"\n\nThis vengeance-themed emo epic soars and stuns before closing with a call to action: \"Make evil afraid of evil's shadow.\"\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nWorriers, \"Good Luck\"\n\nLet's have a toast for the a-holes: Worriers claps back on every privileged jerk with an opinion, wrapping the words in ice-cold courtesy.\n\n– Daoud Tyler-Ameen\n\nYoung Fathers, \"Shame\"\n\nFrom the orchestrated chaos to the catchy hooks and children's choir, the Scottish trio's anthem for 2015 makes you feel no ... shame.\n\n– Alisha Sweeney, Colorado Public Radio's OpenAir\n\nAdele, \"Hello\"\n\nThe year's biggest and most universal cry-along ballad, and it got here just in time.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nAlessia Cara, \"Here\"\n\nIn an exhausting year of terrorist attacks, mass shootings, police brutalities, Nepalese earthquakes, refugee crises, Trump xenophobia, Cosby allegations and HBO's humorless Season 2 of the The Leftovers, \"Here\" is a solid reminder, in no uncertain terms, that the party has been over for a long time.\n\n– Jason King\n\nBelle & Sebastian, \"The Party Line\"\n\nStuart Murdoch, already indie rock's answer to Whit Stillman or Jean-Luc Godard, locates the conformity jitters buzzing within disco's seductive sparkle. It's still fun to dance to.\n\n– Jacob Ganz\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen, \"Making The Most of the Night\"\n\nAn instant daydream: You're outside the club, hearing the distant echoes of Jepsen's vocal warmup, when suddenly she pops out of the stage door and yanks you inside.\n\n– Daoud Tyler-Ameen\n\nThe Chemical Brothers feat. Q-Tip, \"Go\"\n\nThis is the mega hit of 2015 that should have been!\n\n– Rita Houston, WFUV\n\nChvrches, \"Clearest Blue\"\n\nThe springiest synth-pop confection on an album full of them goes down smoothly no matter how fizzy it gets.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nDemi Lovato, \"Cool For The Summer\"\n\nGod bless all of Lovato's awesome gender-unspecific summer-romance paean, but the main reason I couldn't stop playing this piece of bubblegum was that it contained my favorite Max Martin death-chord since \"Teenage Dream.\"\n\n– Piotr Orlov\n\nElle King, \"Ex's & Oh's\"\n\nAn irresistible bit of braggadocio from a soulful pop singer whose delivery exudes gritty, playful charisma.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nFall Out Boy, \"Uma Thurman\"\n\nA fist-pumping crush song, built around a surf-rock jingle from a TV show about an undead suburban family. It's going to be so hard to explain 2015 Fall Out Boy to our grandkids.\n\n– Daoud Tyler-Ameen\n\nFifth Harmony feat. Kid Ink, \"Worth It\"\n\nFifth Harmony and Kid Ink join forces for this frequently shifting display of swagger and self-satisfaction. It's an ego tripping, hook-laden blast of power pop and swirling sax.\n\n– Sheldon Pearce\n\nFlorence + The Machine, \"Ship To Wreck\"\n\nA big and brassy yet considered pop song about self-destruction for an outsized voice that always needed a step back to take it in.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nGenevieve, \"Colors\"\n\nAn almost impossibly upbeat anthem of affirmation, \"Colors\" has been inching toward its inevitable ubiquity all year.\n\n– Stephen Thompson\n\nGrimes, \"Kill V.

This rapturous and tender movement, with the cello at its fore, is mystical, magical and haunting.\n\n– Anastasia Tsioulcas\n\nKuniko, \"Rebonds - B (Xenakis)\"\n\nJapanese percussionist Kuniko Kato savors the hypnotic groove in the Greek composer's uniquely intense aesthetic.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nLatvian Radio Choir, \"Mercy of Peace (Silvestrov)\"\n\nA sublimely gifted choir exquisitely renders the Ukrainian composer's halos of sound, dramatic shadows and overtones of pure white light.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nNordic Affect, \"Clockworking (Sigfusdottir)\"\n\nWith cogs clicking and gears whirring, this mesmerizing chamber music from Iceland invites you to step into the workings of a giant clock.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nNorthwestern University Cello Ensemble, \"Sky With Four Suns (John Luther Adams)\"\n\nLight from a low-hanging sun, mixed with arctic air, can trigger the illusion of multiple suns, or sundogs. Alaskan composer John Luther Adams thinks they sound like this.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nOlafur Arnalds & Alice Sara Ott, \"Reminiscence\"\n\nBored with perfectly recorded works of Chopin, the Icelandic composer and performer Ólafur Arnalds and pianist Alice Sara Ott went on a hunt for pianos with personality and recorded brilliant Chopin works and music, like this song, inspired by Chopin in intimate spaces on vintage gear. A compelling and deeply emotional record.\n\n– Bob Boilen\n\nPhillippe Jaroussky, \"En Sourdine (Hahn)\"\n\nReynaldo Hahn's gently swaying music and Verlaine's rapturous poetry — set amid the \"half-light cast by the lofty branches\" — lend a cinematic feel to a love song elegantly sung.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nPiotr Anderszewski, \"Allemand from Suite No. 1 (Bach)\"\n\nThe Polish pianist will seduce you, speaking Bach in supple, singing lines, elegant ornaments and a keen sense of the dance.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nRoomful of Teeth, \"Brad Wells, Render\"\n\nThis vocal ensemble made its reputation singing the impossible (and getting some major props from Kanye) — but on this shimmering composition, they catapult into the transcendent.\n\n– Anastasia Tsioulcas\n\nSan Francisco Symphony, \"Absolute Jest — V. Vivacissimo (John Adams)\"\n\nThere are other sections in this piece in which composer John Adams lifts the San Francisco Symphony and the four soloists (the St. Lawrence String Quartet) into dreamier realms, but the last two movements are all about whirling kaleidoscopes of notes.\n\n– Anastasia Tsioulcas\n\nSeattle Symphony, \"Symphony No. 9 (IV. Allegro con fuoco) (Dvorak)\"\n\nThose strings. That brass. What a powerhouse performance. (And check out the spectacular \"Amériques\" by Varèse on the same album.)\n\n– Anastasia Tsioulcas\n\nSimon Smith, \"Nostalghia (Silvestrov)\"\n\nMusic can hold surprising power when stripped to its barest elements. Fragments of melody and half-recollected scales hang in the silence like unsettling memories.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nSonya Yoncheva, \"Le jour sous le soleil beni (Messager)\"\n\nAn evocative and rarely-performed aria sung by the pride of Bulgaria, a rising soprano with confidence and a creamy lyric voice.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nSumi Jo, \"Simple Song #3 (David Lang)\"\n\nVictoria Mullova's plaintive violin, Sumi Jo's ardent soprano and David Lang's sweeping music give this uneasy love song from the movie Youth, ravishing gravitas.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nTallis Scholars, \"Nunc dimitis (Part)\"\n\nThe timeless feel of contemporary composer Arvo Pärt's music, with its tolling bells and halos of sound, is heightened in a luminous performance by the preeminent early music choir.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nTigran Hamasyan, \"Bazum en Qo gtutyunqd (Your Mercy is Boundless)\"\n\nThis fascinating merger of the old and the new sounds as if a choir of 5th-century Armenian monks interrupted Keith Jarrett's Köln concert.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nVesselina Kasarova, \"Lyubasha's monologue (Rimsky-Korsakov)\"\n\nThe veteran mezzo's voice has ripened to a full, luscious black cherry in this mournful, a cappella number from Rimsky-Korsakov's The Tsar's Bride.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nWilliam Schimmel, \"Mahler 9\"\n\nSqueezing Mahler's 90-minute Ninth Symphony into a six-minute piece for accordion takes guts. To do it this creatively — with a cameo by Wynton Marsalis — takes genius.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nZofo, \"Etude from the old country (Riley)\"\n\nTerry Riley's recipe of Latin-tinged dances and gently swaying pulsations gets an exuberant performance from a feisty piano duo.\n\n– Tom Huizenga\n\nAnna Von Hausswolff, \"Come Wander With Me/Deliverance\"\n\nRecorded on one of the largest pipe organs in Scandinavia, this is a monstrous beauty about a desperate and dangerous love.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nBaroness, \"Chlorine & Wine\"\n\nThe Dave Fridmann-produced \"Chlorine & Wine,\" from the first album after Baroness' horrifying 2012 bus accident, is as much about healing as it is about resilience.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nBosse-de-Nage, \"A Subtle Change\"\n\nThe Bay Area black metal band upends savagery and accessibility with hints of pop-punk and screamo.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nBrothers of the Sonic Cloth, \"Unnamed\"\n\nA rumbling, catholic piece of metal that crunches, chants and howls. An incredible return for the Seattle mainstay Tad Doyle.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nChelsea Wolfe, \"Carrion Flowers\"\n\nThe LA-based shapeshifter delivers dark, twisted ruminations on a haunted life. Doom metal never sounded so brutal or gorgeous.\n\n– Robin Hilton\n\nCrypt Sermon, \"Will of the Ancient Call\"\n\nMajestic doom metal in the spirit of Candlemass and Dio-era Black Sabbath that doesn't mind getting a little dirty.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nDead to a Dying World, \"The Hunt Eternal\"\n\nOver 17 minutes, the Dallas seven-piece alternates between blast-beaten violence and majestic ruin, with help from members of Baroness, Pallbearer and Sabbath Assembly.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nDeafheaven, \"Gifts for the Earth\"\n\nThis is Deafheaven at its most exploratory, throwing its gauzy and metallic sonics to the wind with a melody inspired by Oasis.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nFaith No More, \"Cone of Shame\"\n\nHas there ever been a heavy metal song with finger snaps? Only the return of Faith No More could have guaranteed this kind of suave and haunting weirdness in 2015.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nHigh On Fire, \"The Black Plot\"\n\nAll hail Matt Pike's glorious, buzzsaw guitar tone and reptoid croak that fuel this barricade-shaking rampager.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nHorrendous, \"Ozymandias\"\n\nGotta love a death metal band that names a melodically wild track for a Percy Bysshe Shelley poem about dead idols, scraping away of the decay and making way for the new.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nIron Maiden, \"The Book of Souls\"\n\nLest we ever take Iron Maiden's reign for granted, 2015 gave us the band's most exhilarating album in a decade, including the theatrical title track. Up the irons!\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nKhemmis, \"The Bereaved\"\n\nThis is fuzzy and doomy and wizard-y metal, with a high, wailing voice that grips the heavens over Iron Maiden-like twin leads.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nKowloon Walled City, \"Backlit\"\n\nThere is defeat and then there is the heaving, rattling mass of sadness left by Kowloon Walled City.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nLightning Bolt, \"The Metal East\"\n\nWound up and wired, and making mischief of one kind or another for two decades. They'll eat you up.\n\n– Jacob Ganz\n\nRed Death, \"Strategic Mass Delirium\"\n\nYou have 50 seconds to psych yourself up before the D.C. thrashy hardcore band takes a gigantic swing and you're knocked the hell out.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nRoyal Thunder, \"Time Machine\"\n\nA patient, methodical account of a love dismembered. \"Relax,\" Mlny Parsonz sings, wounds still fresh. \"It's gonna fade.\"\n\n– Jacob Ganz\n\nSatan, \"The Devil's Infantry\"\n\nAll hail Satan (the band) and its army of classic and wild heavy metal that never goes out of style.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nSuper Unison, \"Recognize You\"\n\nHigh velocity punk that ain't afraid to shake a tail feather.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nTribulation, \"In The Dreams Of The Dead\"\n\nThe Swedish death metal band has come a long way from its debut, conjuring something far more cosmic and flamboyant that plays with tone and atmosphere.\n\n– Lars Gotrich\n\nVHOL, \"The Desolate Damned\"\n\nWhat a time to be alive, ripping into the inter-dimensional vortex and discovering VHOL's psychedelic thrash bending our brains to its orbit.\n\n– Lars Gotrich"
