        "text": "Featured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2023\n\nMemento Mori by Depeche Mode\n\nReleased in March, Memento Mori is Depeche Mode’s fifteenth studio album.\n\nAfter the death of founding member and keyboardist, Andy Fletcher, remaining members Dave Gahan and Martin Gore decided to soldier on as a duo. I am really glad they did, as Memento Mori is an inspired work and in my opinion their best album since 2005’s Playing The Angel. Lyrically it appears to be themed around death and mortality but musically this is classic Depeche Mode. Has been on and off high rotation for me in the nine months since its release.\n\nFavourite track: “Caroline’s Monkey”\n\n72 Seasons by Metallica\n\nAfter a seven year gap, Metallica released their eleventh studio album, 72 Seasons, in April\n\nAlthough I enjoyed 2016’s Hardwired…To Self-Destruct I enjoy 72 Seasons so much more. I find it difficult to articulate why, but I believe it may be that as a collection of songs it holds together much better as an album. The album received three Grammy nominations and 5 singles were released.\n\nFavourite track: Metallica’s longest song to date, the epic “Inamorata”\n\nRoad by Alice Cooper\n\nRoad is the 29th studio album from Alice Cooper and his 22nd since becoming a solo artist\n\nThe aptly-titled Road features and was written with, his live band and the album has a live feel having been recorded with no overdubs. Alice has described it as a concept album about things that happen while a band is on the road. Featuring his old partner in crime on the mixing desk and production duties, Bob Ezrin, Alice sounds great on the album. Big name guests include Roger Glover and Tom Morello too.\n\nFavourite track: “Big Boots”\n\nHackney Diamonds by The Rolling Stones\n\nHackney Diamonds is the first Rolling Stones studio album of original material since 2005\n\nHow have they done it? I was very pleasantly surprised by how good this album is. I did not have high hopes when I took it home but I was blown away. They have not sounded this good in decades. Jagger is singing surprisingly well for an octogenarian and although Keith may have adjusted his playing style due to his arthritis, he still sounds rifftastic!\n\nFavourite track: “Whole Wide World”\n\ni/o by Peter Gabriel\n\nMore than two decades in the making, i/o arrived 21 years after its predecessor, Up\n\nI was very excited when I heard Gabriel was releasing a new album called i/o (inside/outside) in 2023. I have been a fan for many years and waited with baited breath. Gabriel being Gabriel, he decides to release a new song every full moon and a new mix each new moon. Wait, multiple mixes of the same songs will be available. Yes, 3! The physical versions of the album would not be released until 1st December but it was worth the wait. I got myself a copy of the 2CD/BluRay version as it contains one disc of the Bright Side Mix, one disc of the Dark Side Mix and the BluRay features the Inside Mix. They are all good, if slightly different, and at the time of writing I prefer the Dark Side Mix of the tracks. Great stuff and my contender for album of the year.\n\nFavourite track: “i/o”, the title track\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2022\n\nElephants Of Mars by Joe Satriani\n\nElephants Of Mars is the 18th studio album released by guitar maestro Joe Satriani\n\nThe ever-reliable Joe Satriani continues to release new albums for his fans. At this stage of his career he is unlikely to be finding new recruits but he is definitely keeping his existing fans, like me, happy. This is another great collection of instrumentals that showcase his guitar prowess. I always find much to enjoy about each new release and this album keeps up the trend.\n\nFavourite track: “Sahara”\n\nI Am The Moon by Tedeschi Trucks Band\n\nI Am The Moon is a four part album released over four consecutive full moons\n\nTedeschi Trucks Band are one of my favourite bands of recent years and when I heard they were doing a four album release I was quite excited. When I discovered that the inspiration for the albums was from the same poem the album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (probably my favourite album of all time) took its name, my excitement was trebled. When Clapton used it as source material he only took the name Layla. Tedeschi Trucks Band decided there was a whole story there that deserved more attention. Each album is old-school length of 30-35 minutes and each release was accompanied by an album-length music video. I loved the whole thing. Every track on each album was well-considered, beautifully recorded and contains fantastic musicianship and vocal work. Quite simpy, a masterpiece.\n\nFavourite track: The title track “I Am The Moon”\n\nAfterLife by Five Finger Death Punch\n\nAfterLife is the 9th studio album released by Las Vegas rockers Five Finger Death Punch\n\nAfterLife achieved instant success for Five Finger Death Punch, achieving top ten status in Finland, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, the UK and their home country, the USA. Four singles were released from the album that were also quite successful. It is the first studio album released since long-time lead guitarist Jason Hook left the band.\n\nFavourite track: “Welcome To The Circus”\n\nSunrise On Slaughter Beach by Clutch\n\nClutch released their 13th studio album, Sunrise On Slaughter Beach, in September 2022\n\nIn recent years Clutch can do no wrong for me and I have enjoyed their last few albums very much indeed. This is no exception and I was disappointed with the first copy I obtained. The compact disc was faulty and missing the last two tracks! Heresy! When I received my replacement I was very relieved as not only is it a great album but my favourite track is one of the ones that was missing on the first copy sent to me.\n\nFavourite track: “Three Golden Horns” just for the lyric “jazz music corrupts our youth”\n\nResist by Midnight Oil\n\nResist is Midnight Oil’s 13th studio album and was supported by their final tour\n\nI was very impressed by how good this album is. It has the energy and verve of their earlier work and lyrically still displays their forthright opinions on issues that concern them. Although the tour for the album may be their last the band have said that they are still open to recording again in the future. The album debuted at number one in Australia and also achieved top 20 status in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nFavourite track: “Reef”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2020\n\nF8 by Five Finger Death Punch\n\nIn February 2020 Five Finger Death Punch released their 8th studio album, F8\n\nThis is one of those acts that I stumbled upon by accident. Someone I know shared one of their music videos on social media and I was hooked. Love the vocals and the guitar oriented sound and wanted to get me some. I was not disappointed and have enjoyed their original compositions as well as a couple of cover versions they have made. This is the first full album I have purchased as I only had a compilation prior to getting hold of this. It was a successful one for the band reaching the top ten in 10 countries and number 2 here in Australia.\n\nFavourite track: “A Little Bit Off”\n\nPWR UP by AC/DC\n\nPWR UP (Power Up) is AC/DC’s 17th studio album and the 3rd produced by Brendan O’Brien\n\nAfter the death of founding member Malcolm Young, no one was really sure about the future of AC/DC, including the band themselves. However, despite various issues singer Brian Johnson, bassist Cliff Williams and drummer Phil Rudd all returned to the band for this album. I really like it and admit to being surprised by its quality. I can’t help but wonder how many of these tracks were based on riffs from the late Young brother. Five singles were released and the album went to number one all around the world.\n\nFavourite track: “Through The Mists Of Time” because it sounds different for them\n\nExistential Reckoning by Puscifer\n\nIs the fourth studio album from Puscifer their most accessible to date?\n\nMaynard James Keenan has never been one to rest on his laurels so it is no surprise that another Puscifer album surfaces not long after one from Tool. Existential Reckoning received generally positive reviews from critics, but unfortunately it didn’t reflect in album sales. Sound wise this is fairly easy to digest compared to their earlier work but it is still uniquely Puscifer. Simply put, if you are a fan you will enjoy the album although it is unlikely to win them new ones.\n\nFavourite track: “Bullet Train To Iowa”\n\nHuman Design by Birds Of Tokyo\n\nThe sixth studio album from Birds Of Tokyo debuted at #1 on the Australian charts\n\nThe catchy tunes one has come to expect from Birds Of Tokyo are still here, only this time the lyrics were more personal. The lyrics are largely written about singer Ian Kenny’s marriage breaking down as a coping mechanism for him. They are great songs all the same and 6 of them were released as singles.\n\nFavourite track: “The Greatest Mistakes”\n\nShapeshifting by Joe Satriani\n\nJoe Satriani released his seventeenth studio album in April 2020\n\nYou always know what to expect from a Joe Satriani album and he never disappoints. I own all of his stuff and each album he has released still gets a regular listen. This album made the top 40 in Hungary, Scotland, Poland, Portugal and here in Australia too. Not as successful as his earlier work but still of the same quality in my opinion.\n\nFavourite track: “NIneteen Eighty”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2019\n\nThis Land by Gary Clark Jr.\n\nThis Land was Gary Clarke Jr.’s third studio album and it debuted at #6 on the US charts\n\nI first heard Gary Clark Jr. when he featured at the 2013 Crossroads Guitar Festival. I then tracked down his debut album and have followed his career ever since. I love his playing and singing as well as the different genres of music that turn up in his repertoire despite being considered a bluesman. This Land was his third top ten album in the US and it won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. The title track was released as the lead single (with an accompanying music video) and the song would win Grammy Awards for both Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance.\n\nFavourite track: “Gotta Get Into Something”, which for some reason reminds me of The Clash…\n\nUntitled by Rammstein\n\nRammstein’s seventh studio album was released untitled, a practice I have never understood\n\nThis album was released a decade after its predecessor and despite the long interval it went to number one in ten countries. It achieved critical acclaim as well as commercial success and was supported by the release of three singles. I have been a fan of the band since first hearing their work on the soundtrack to David Lynch’s Lost Highway.I continue to purchase their albums as soon as they are released. Although I like some better than others, they never disappoint.\n\nFavourite track: The single “Auslander”\n\nSigns by Tedeschi Trucks Band\n\nSigns is the fourth studio album released by the Tedeschi Trucks Band\n\nAnother album from this fantastic band that have often been described as blues and roots. Husband and wife, Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, merged their two bands together creating an amazing group of talented musicians. Sadly one of those musicians, Kofi Burbridge, died on the day of the album’s release. This is another act I discovered via the Crossroads Guitar Festival and consider them one of my favourite musical acts this century!\n\nFavourite track: The magnificent “Shame”\n\nEncore by The Specials\n\nEncore is the eighth studio album for The Specials and their first for more than 20 years\n\nTerry Hall returned to the Specials and this is his first recording with the band since 1981. I heard one song from this thanks to another of those free compact discs that comes with a music magazine. They sounded like the Specials of old so I purchased the album. It is an absolute cracker if you are a fan of the band like I am. I was very pleasantly surprised by how good this is.\n\nFavourite track: “Blam Blam Fever” a cover of a song originally recorded by The Valentines (not to be confused with the Australian band of the same name)\n\nFear Inoculum by Tool\n\nReturning after a 13 year gap in releases, Tool released their fifth studio album in 2019\n\nFear Inoculum absolutely blew me away from the first listen. I could hear influences from all their previous work in this album, whilst also being its own unique beast. The majority of the tracks are more than ten minutes long, which in their hands, is a good thing. It has now been more than four years since its release and I still listen to it regularly. Brilliant stuff.\n\nFavourite track: A really difficult ask but I decided on “Culling Voices”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2018\n\nBlack Coffee by Beth Hart & Joe Bonamassa\n\nBlack Coffee was the third collaborative album recorded by Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa\n\nThese two clearly enjoy collaborating and it has always showed on the cover albums they have made together. This one is no exception and it sounds like they are having a rollicking good time. Kevin Shirley is back in the producer’s chair as per the previous two albums and he seems to get the best out of his performers as usual. Another eclectic mix of song choices also helps and I find this an enjoyable listen from start to finish.\n\nFavourite track: “Black Coffee”, the Ike & Tina Turner cover which serves as the album’s title track\n\nAmerican Utopia by David Byrne\n\nAmerican Utopia is the 8th studio album released by David Byrne\n\nThis album is Byrne’s first solo studio album since 2004 and it was released as part of a larger multimedia project called Reasons To Be Cheerful. The project aimed to spread positivity in spite of political strife and environmental problems. It is an upbeat album accordingly and was the first of David Byrne solo albums to reach the top ten in the Billboard album charts. It is a quirky and enjoyable album and the corresponding tour culminated in performances on Broadway resulting in the second best concert film of Byrne’s career.\n\nFavourite track: The lead single “Everybody’s Coming To My House”\n\nEat The Elephant by A Perfect Circle\n\nA Perfect Circle’s 4th studio album was released 14 years after its predecessor\n\nDespite a difficult birth due to the writing process, scheduling conflicts and disagreement on the album’s sound, the album was a return to form for A Perfect Circle and an instant success. Coming on the back of four singles released prior to the album’s launch, it debuted at number 3 in the US charts and top ten in eight other countries. The album also received critical acclaim and for me is the best of their career to date.\n\nFavourite track: “So Long And Thanks For All The Fish”\n\nBook Of Bad Decisions by Clutch\n\nBook Of Bad Decisions is the 12th studio album released by American rock band Clutch\n\nAlthough I am a fan of Clutch, this album snuck up on me in a way. I was not aware that it was coming until I read an article about it in a music magazine. I jumped on a copy as quickly as I could and it went on high rotation immediately. It was a critical and commercial success reaching the top 20 in the UK, Hungary, Germany and the US.\n\nFavourite track: The horn-laden “In Walks Barbarella” with an honourable mention to “Hot Bottom Feeder” which is essentially a catfish recipe\n\nBeloved Antichrist by Therion\n\nFor their sixteenth studio release Therion unleashed the triple album epic Beloved Antichrist\n\nBeloved Antichrist was intended as the soundtrack to a rock musical by the band, who are accompanied by a large orchestra and choir. The founder of the group, Christofer Johnsson, finally decided to do metal/rock music with opera instead of a traditional opera. The result is an epic more than three hours in length, featuring electric rock band instruments, operatic singing and accompanied by an orchestra. As a fan of Therion for more than two decades, this was right up my alley and I think it nothing short of a masterpiece.\n\nFavourite track: “Shoot Them Down!” although it seems wrong to select one song from what is a cohesive whole\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2017\n\nIs This The Life We Really Want? by Roger Waters\n\nRoger Waters released his fourth solo album in 2017, a mere 25 years after its predecessor\n\nAs has always been the case when it comes to Pink Floyd, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. That being said, I have largely still enjoyed the solo albums of its members and the Pink Floyd albums made after the departure of Roger Waters. Although I am sure he would not like to hear it, I find this album a lot closer to the material of his former band than his previous albums. Maybe that is why I like it so much! It was a successful one too, reaching #3 in the UK album charts and #11 in the US.\n\nFavourite track: The trilogy of “Wait For Her/Oceans Apart/Part Of Me Died” which is really a single work in three parts\n\nParty Of One by George Thorogood\n\nGeorge Thorogood released his first solo album, without the Destroyers, in 2017\n\nChoosing to release his first solo album more than 40 years into his career may have seemed a strange decision, but the proof is in the pudding. George plays all the instruments himself on largely acoustic arrangements of tracks that George has loved for most of his life. These compositions were originally performed by some of his heroes such as John Lee Hooker, Elmore James and Robert Johnson. He does them justice and if you have ever been a fan of acoustic blues I highly recommend this album.\n\nFavourite track: His cover of “No Expectations”, a Rolling Stones original\n\nLife Love Flesh Blood by Imelda May\n\nImelda May collaborated with American musician T-Bone Burnett for her fifth studio album\n\nDeciding to have a radical change in direction from her previous rockabilly material seemed to have worked very well for Ireland’s Imelda May. The sound consisted of more acoustic and softer rock styles and was made after her divorce, itself an influence on the album’s lyrics. As I was a fan of her rockabilly material I was a little unsure when I first brought the album home but I needn’t have worried.\n\nFavourite track: The magnificent 3rd single from the album, “Should’ve Been You”\n\nProphets Of Rage by Prophets Of Rage\n\nThe debut (and only) self-titled album from Prophets Of Rage, released in September 2017\n\nProphets Of Rage are a musical act consisting of members of Rage Against The Machine, Public Enemy and Cypress Hill. On paper this collaboration shouldn’t work, but it does. I have always liked the music and musicianship of Rage Against The Machine but have only been able to handle Zack de la Rocha’s vocals in small doses. I enjoyed their work with Audioslave, although others didn’t, because I like Chris Cornell’s vocals. My brother-in-law put me onto this band and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy this album. The group got together as a reaction to Trump which is a good enough reason for me.\n\nFavourite track: “Living On The 110”\n\nVillains by Queens Of The Stone Age\n\nVillains, the 7th studio album from Queens Of The Stone Age, was released in August 2017\n\nVillains was nominated for a Grammy as Best Rock Album and was another successful release for the Josh Homme and co.’s band. The album topped the charts around the world, including here in Australia and was supported by a world tour and the release of two singles. I got to see them on this tour as it included dates in Hobart. I was very impressed with the album as well as their live performance.\n\nFavourite track: “Feet Don’t Fail Me”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2016\n\nDig In Deep by Bonnie Raitt\n\n2016 saw the release of American singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt’s seventeenth studio album\n\nFor my taste, this is Bonnie Raitt’s best album for more than two decades. It is not a coincidence that it is the first for some time to feature some original Raitt compositions. But she also shines when performing the material of others. The album peaked at #11 on the US charts and also reached the top 40 in Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands and the UK.\n\nFavourite track: The slinky, bluesy cover of the INXS hit, “Need You Tonight”\n\nThe Lexicon Of Love II by ABC\n\nABC chose to release a sequel to their 1982 debut studio album The Lexicon Of Love in 2016\n\nDeciding to revisit a classic time in a band’s career is fraught with all sorts of pitfalls. Thankfully ABC didn’t fall into any of those and have instead created a worthwhile successor to their very successful debut. Although lead singer Martin Fry is now the sole member of ABC, this album’s lush orchestrations hark back to the original The Lexicon Of Love as they were created once again by Anne Dudley. I heard one song off this and thought it good enough to warrant investing in the whole album and I was not disappointed.\n\nFavourite track: “The Flames Of Desire”\n\nSantana IV by Santana\n\nSantana chose to call their twenty-fourth studio album, Santana IV\n\nSantana IV picks up where Santana III left off back in 1971 (hence the title) as it features the majority of the line-up from that album in a reunion of sorts. The album was an astounding success, debuting at number 5 in the US as well as reaching the top ten in Germany, the UK, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland. The album peaked at number 11 here in Australia and I really enjoyed it right from the first listen.\n\nFavourite track: “Shake It”\n\nPost Pop Depression by Iggy Pop\n\nIggy Pop’s 17th studio album was recorded Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California\n\nPost Pop Depression is largely co-written by Iggy Pop and Josh Homme, of Queens Of The Stone Age. Homme also produced the album as well as playing on it in a band that featured fellow bandmate from Queens, Dean Fertita and the drummer from Arctic Monkeys, Matt Helder. A sympatico group of musicians that supported Pop in the best possible way which, well, let Iggy be Iggy. The result was a resounding success that made the top ten in album charts around the world.\n\nFavourite track: “Sunday”\n\nBlackstar (stylised as ★) by Iggy Pop\n\nBlackstar is the 26th and final studio album released by the late David Bowie\n\nBlackstar was Bowie’s most experimental album for some time containing art rock combined with avant-garde jazz. Bowie was suffering from liver cancer during its recording and in fact died only two days after the album’s release. The lyrics do appear to feature his impending death and I believe he left us with one last masterpiece before his departure from this mortal coil. Unsurprisingly, it was a number one album all around the world.\n\nFavourite track: The hauntingly beautiful “Lazarus”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2015\n\nSometimes I Sit And Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit by Courtney Barnett\n\nCourtney Barnett released this, her debut album, after first releasing two EPs\n\nSometimes you hear hype about an artist before you hear the artist themselves. It doesn’t always turn out well. I was pleasantly surprised by how good this album is and it definitely lived up to the hype. The album did well reaching number 4 in the Australian charts, as well as achieving top 20 in the US, New Zealand and the UK. It also won the 2015 Australian Music Prize, the Australian Album Of The Year at the J Awards and the ARIA Awards for Best Cover Art, Breakthrough Artist, Best Female Artist and Best Independent Release.\n\nFavourite track: “Nobody Really Cares If You Don’t Go To The Party”\n\nDrones by Muse\n\nFor their 7th studio album Muse co-produced with uber-producer Robert John “Mutt” Lange\n\nDrones debuted at number one on the UK albums chart and was the fifth consecutive number one album in the UK for Muse. It also debuted at number one in the US and topped the charts throughout Europe as well as in Australia, Mexico and Japan. Five singles were released and although some critics disliked the lyrical content it certainly didn’t stop the general public from buying it. The first time I heard the album in its entirety was during a road trip with a friend in his convertible.\n\nFavourite track: “Psycho”\n\nPsychic Warfare by Clutch\n\nPsychic Warfare is the eleventh studio album released by Clutch and remains my favourite\n\nI absolutely love this album and every track on it. I was already a fan of the band but I still didn’t anticipate how good this would be. It performed well on the charts as well, reaching top 20 in the US, Canada, Sweden and the UK and made it to 23 on the Australian album charts. They are not as well known here in Australia as they are elsewhere so I was pleased it did so well. I was even more pleased when they toured here in support of the album and I got to see them live in Sydney with a dear friend.\n\nFavourite track: “Firebirds!”\n\nThe Book Of Souls by Iron Maiden\n\nIron Maiden’s sixteenth studio album and also their first double studio album and longest\n\nThe Book Of Souls was a very successful release for Iron Maiden, achieving number one on album charts in 24 countries around the world as well as gold sales status in multiple countries. It is also the fifth of six of their studio albums to be produced by Kevin Shirley (so far). It is not a concept album as such, but it does feature references to mortality and the soul throughout.\n\nFavourite track: Their longest song released to date, the 18 minute epic about the R101 airship disaster, “Empire Of The Clouds”\n\nEndless Forms Most Beautiful by Nightwish\n\nEndless Forms Most Beautiful is the first album to feature Floor Jansen on lead vocals\n\nNightwish were armed with a new lead vocalist so I did not know what to expect prior to its release. Élan was released as the first single and I can’t say I was impressed. Thankfully it wasn’t representative of the album and I was blown away by how good it is and how good Floor Jansen’s vocals are. I had been familiar with her work with her former band After Forever but it did not prepare me for this. I was also impressed with the lyrical content/subject matter so for me it had everything going for it.\n\nFavourite track: One of the most epic tracks in my collection, the 24 minute masterpiece that is “The Greatest Show On Earth”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2014\n\nBlank Project by Neneh Cherry\n\nBlank Project was Neneh Cherry’s first album of solo material in eighteen years\n\nAs a long time Neneh Cherry fan, I was pleasantly surprised when the release of Blank Project was announced. After such a long time between drinks I did not know what to expect. I heard one single and had viewed its accompanying music video before purchasing the album. I took it home with some trepidation as I did not want it to tarnish her fantastic back catalogue of music. I needn’t have worried, as the album is fantastic and perhaps even the best of her career to date. Cherry apparently wrote the album as a way to mourn her mother and maybe that is why she chose a sparser sound than her previous releases.\n\nFavourite track: “Spit Three Times”\n\nWorld On Fire by Slash featuring Myles Kennedy & The Conspirators\n\nWorld On Fire is the 2nd studio release by Slash with Myles Kennedy & The Conspirators\n\nBack in 2010 when Slash released his first solo album it featured a range of guest vocalists. The only vocalist to appear twice was Alter Bridge’s Myles Kennedy. They obviously enjoyed the collaboration so when it came to do another album they formed a band together. This is the second of four studio albums they have released together so far. The album was a top ten success around the world and three singles were released.\n\nFavourite track: “Wicked Stone”\n\nOz by Missy Higgins\n\nMissy Higgins released an album of Australian cover versions as her fourth studio album\n\nI have enjoyed some Missy Higgins releases but not enough to justify buying an album. Until Oz. An incredibly eclectic choice of Australian compositions intrigued me to say the least and her version of NYE (originally performed by Perry Keyes) was the first thing I heard off this. Not being familiar with the original I was enamoured with her version. When I saw the tracklist also featured songs by The Angels, Paul Kelly, Divinyls, Slim Dusty, Dan Sultan and more, I went out and bought the album. Great stuff.\n\nFavourite track: The afore-mentioned “NYE”\n\nSpace Invader by Ace Frehley\n\nIt wouldn’t be an Ace Frehley album without references to “space” would it?\n\nSpace Invader, the fourth solo studio album released by Ace Frehley, has the honour of being the only solo album from one of the past or current members of KISS to reach the top ten in the US. If the artwork appears to have a style reminiscent of something you have seen before, it is because it was created by Ken Kelly, who is also responsible for the artwork for the KISS albums Destroyer and Love Gun. This is a great bunch of songs, three with a space theme and a great cover of Steve Miller Band’s “The Joker”. Classic stuff.\n\nFavourite track: “Inside The Vortex”\n\nPrimus & The Chocolate Factory With The Fungi Ensemble by Primus\n\nPrimus reimagined the soundtrack of the 1971 film Willie Wonka & The Chocolate Factory\n\nPrimus have always marched to the beat of their own drum, so their choice to cover a film soundtrack as their eighth studio album isn’t all that surprising. However, in saying that, nothing prepared me for how much they would make these songs their own. I adore this album and am grateful that I stumbled across it. I have always liked Primus but I cannot remember how I heard about this one!\n\nFavourite track: “Golden Ticket”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2013\n\nDirty Pop Fantasy by Regurgitator\n\nDirty Pop Fantasy was Brisvegas rockers Regurgitator’s eighth studio album release\n\nDirty Pop Fantasy was written and recorded in Hong Kong and was streamed two weeks earlier than its official release. The tracks on this album are all quite radically different yet still 100% Regurgitator so they all seem to gel well. The album title does a good job of describing the album’s contents and I enjoyed it right from the first listen. But then I have been a fan since very early on in their career…\n\nFavourite track: “Fuck You Sweetness”\n\nTubular Beats by Mike Oldfield\n\nTubular Beats, a remix album resulting from a collaboration between Mike Oldfield and York\n\nFor me, this album almost works as a “greatest hits remix” album for Mike Oldfield. When collaborating with York they have used some of the original master recordings, some new recordings of Mike Oldfield and some rerecorded vocals featuring different singers than on the original releases. I think it can be enjoyed as a cohesive whole and even the music video for the remix of “Guilty” works really well. I have been a long time fan of Mike Oldfield and found it interesting to hear his material presented differently.\n\nFavourite track: “Far Above The Clouds”\n\nAsymmetry by Karnivool\n\nKarnivool’s Asymmetry was nominated at the J Awards for Australian Album Of The Year\n\nComing four years after the successful Sound Awake, Asymmetry was the third studio album released by Karnivool. Fans of the band, like myself, have now been waiting a decade for a follow-up album. The album was a success, topping the Australian albums chart and achieving gold sales status. Two singles were released and the album won the ARIA Music Award for Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Album.\n\nFavourite track: Lead single, “We Are”\n\nBlack Dog Barking by Airbourne\n\nAustralia’s O’Keefe brothers and their bandmates released their 3rd studio album in May\n\nAirbourne are quite appropriately compared to AC/DC, a very obvious influence. Some would go so far as to say that they are almost a carbon copy. My response to that has always been “and your point is…”. I have no problem with bands sounding like their influences and as long as I like what I hear with my ears, who am I to judge?\n\nFavourite track: “Live It Up”\n\nEarth Rocker by Clutch\n\nAfter a four year gap, Clutch returned with their tenth studio album, Earth Rocker\n\nI haven’t always been a fan of Clutch, but I have liked all their releases from Blast Tyrant onwards and would consider them one of my favourite 21st century musical acts. This is an absolute cracker in my opinion and has been described as heavier and faster than their previous efforts. They had been touring with Thin Lizzy and Motorhead prior to the album’s release and some band members believe this contributed to Earth Rocker becoming a more straight ahead rock and roll album.\n\nFavourite track: “Cyborg Bette”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2012\n\nA Different Kind Of Truth by Van Halen\n\nVan Halen’s 12th and final studio album, A Different Kind Of Truth, was released in February\n\nReuniting with original lead singer David Lee Roth, this was the first full album recorded with him on vocals since the 1980s and was also unfortunately the last Van Halen album. It was also the only one to not feature Michael Anthony on bass, as he had been was replaced by Eddie’s son, Wolfgang Van Halen. The album was very successful and achieved top ten status around the world. Two singles were released and for me, was a return to the form of their heyday.\n\nFavourite track: “Stay Frosty”\n\nLove This Giant by David Byrne & St. Vincent\n\nLove This Giant is a collaboration between David Byrne and Annie Clark a.k.a. St. Vincent\n\nThis is Byrne’s ninth studio album overall and Clark’s fourth. The duo had previously played together on the album Here Lies Love. The performers enlisted a variety of brass musicians to augment their song-writing and toured over the following year to promote the album. The album was a success and reached the top 30 in the US on the back of two singles.\n\nFavourite track: Lead single, “Who”\n\nBlack Rabbits by Grinspoon\n\nBlack Rabbits was the seventh and to date, final studio album by Australian act Grinspoon\n\nI have enjoyed Grinspoon’s music throughout their career and own all their albums. Even so, I was surprised by how good this album was and was disappointed that it was not as well received as some of their earlier albums. It did reach the top 10 in Australia though and two singles were released. The following year the band went on a five year hiatus.\n\nFavourite track: “Branded”, released as the album’s second single\n\nKing Animal by Soundgarden\n\nKing Animal was the sixth and final studio album released by grunge rockers Soundgarden\n\nReleased 16 years after its predecessor Down On The Upside, a reunited Soundgarden did their best to recapture their former glory. Largely it worked, picking up from where they left off. The album debuted at number five on the US charts and was a success around the world. Three singles were released, two of which charted well in the US.\n\nFavourite track: “By Crooked Steps”\n\nThe Russian Wilds by Howlin Rain\n\nHowlin Rain’s third studio album was four years in the making\n\nI absolutely adore this album and I still haven’t tired of it after 11 years. I think it is a modern masterpiece and it was not just my favourite album of 2012, but also the decade! I had not heard of the band prior to this album and it was another of those serendipitously discovered thanks to a free compact disc accompanying a music magazine. Man do I miss those happy accidents!\n\nFavourite track: “Phantom In The Valley”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2011\n\nWasting Light by Foo Fighters\n\nWasting Light is the seventh studio album released by Foo Fighters\n\nFoo Fighters recorded this album in frontman Dave Grohl’s garage in Encino, California using only analogue equipment. The band sought a heavier sound and wanted to recapture the sound of their earlier material. The process worked and the album was another successful one for the band. Six singles were released and the album debuted at number one in 12 countries. It was their first to top the US charts.\n\nFavourite track: “Bridge Burning”\n\nFrom Here To Anywhere by Sneaky Sound System\n\nSneaky Sound System released their third studio album in October 2011\n\nThis is actually the 5th studio album in my collection to feature Connie Mitchell as lead vocalist, as I also have the two albums she released with Primary. I have always loved her vocals and I think this is the most cohesive effort from Sneaky Sound System. Four singles were released and the album was nominated for Best Dance Release at the ARIA Music Awards.\n\nFavourite Track: “Friends”\n\nThe Unforgiving by Within Temptation\n\nThe Unforgiving is the fifth studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation\n\nThe Unforgiving part of a multimedia storytelling project and involved a series of six comic books and three short films. The album featured more pop and 80s influences than previous efforts and three singles were released. The album reached the top 10 in several European countries, the top 30 in the UK and Australia and the top 50 in the US.\n\nFavourite track: Third single, “Shot In The Dark”\n\nTo The Horses by Lanie Lane\n\nLanie Lane released her self-produced debut album, To The Horses, in 2011\n\nLanie Lane seemed to come out of nowhere to most listeners upon release of this, her debut album, in 2011. I had the advantage of being involved in community radio at the time so got to know her material from the start, before this was released. I was an instant fan and really enjoyed her music. The album was a success and reached number 12 in the Australian album charts. Six singles were released and Lanie was nominated for five ARIA Music Awards.\n\nFavourite track: “Betty Baby”\n\nWelcome 2 My Nightmare by Alice Cooper\n\nWelcome 2 My Nightmare, was released as a sequel to 1975’s Welcome To My Nightmare\n\nProducer Bob Ezrin convinced Alice Cooper to release a sequel album to the biggest album of Alice’s career. It was a wise decision as it made the top 30 around the world and was his most successful album in the US since Trash back in 1989. The album also featured some tracks recorded with the surviving members of the original Alice Cooper band, their first recordings together since 1973’s Muscle Of Love.\n\nFavourite track: “I’ll Bite Your Face Off”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2010\n\nScratch My Back by Peter Gabriel\n\nReleased in February 2010, Scratch My Back was Peter Gabriel’s 8th solo studio album\n\nGabriel decided to release an album featuring his interpretations of other artist’s compositions using only orchestra and voice, resulting in Scratch My Back. The intent was always for his covers to be reciprocated by the artists he covered. Most played along and after some delays the companion album, And I’ll Scratch Yours, was released in 2013. The album performed well on album charts around the world reaching the top 5 in Belgium, Sweden, France, the Czech Republic, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Canada. It also achieved top 20 in the UK and top 30 in the US.\n\nFavourite track: “My Body Is A Cage”, originally performed by Arcade Fire\n\nBingo! by The Steve Miller Band\n\nThe Steve Miller Band’s 16th studio album, Bingo!, was released after a 17 year hiatus\n\nBingo! was recorded at the studio owned by George Lucas, appropriately named Skywalker Studios. Miller chose to record covers of some of his favourite songs, predominantly in the blues genre. He intended the recording to be a “party album” that would make people get up and dance. Joe Satriani also turns up on a couple of tracks.\n\nFavourite track: “Tramp”\n\nWhat Lies Beneath by Tarja\n\nThis is Tarja’s first album in which she is credited for composition on every track\n\nOriginal Nightwish lead singer, Tarja Turunen, released her third studio album in September of 2010. It is probably the first to sound closer to the music she made with her former band. Four singles were released from the album and it performed well in the charts of various European countries. Joe Satriani turns up on this one too!\n\nFavourite track: “Anteroom Of Death”\n\nThe Final Frontier by Iron Maiden\n\nThe Final Frontier, the 4th studio album released since Bruce Dickinson rejoined the band\n\nI loved this album right from the first listen and it remains one of my favourites from the band. I also got to see them live at the Sydney Entertainment Centre on the tour for this album. I thought they were amazing and the new songs held up well in the live format. The album received favourable reviews and topped the charts in 28 countries.\n\nFavourite track: “Isle Of Avalon”\n\nAmerican Slang by The Gaslight Anthem\n\nAmerican Slang, was the Gaslight Anthem’s third studio album, released in June 2010\n\nI first heard a track from this band and from this album on another of those sampler compact discs that came free with a music magazine. The album was successful in the US, Ireland and Australia. Five singles were released from the album to limited success. The band also toured Australia on the back of the album.\n\nFavourite track: “The Spirit Of Jazz”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2009\n\nAnomaly by Ace Frehley\n\nAnomaly was the first album of original material from Frehley since 1989’s Trouble Walkin’\n\nThis was the first studio album recorded by original KISS guitarist Ace Frehley since becoming clean and sober. It tells in the quality of his playing, the quality of the song-writing and his focus on recording a cohesive album. I loved this from the first moment I heard it, but then he was always my favourite member of KISS.\n\nFavourite track: “Outer Space”\n\nBefore The Frost…Until The Freeze by The Black Crowes\n\nBefore The Frost… was released on a CD that was manufactured as a vinyl LP replica\n\nWhen buying Before The Frost… a code was provided for downloading …Until The Freeze\n\nThis double album from the Black Crowes was recorded before a live audience at Levon Helm’s studio The Barn in Woodstock, New York. I loved this whole thing from start to finish and for me, was their best recording for more than a decade. Although they are back performing live again, albeit with a different line-up, they still haven’t recorded any new original studio material since this release.\n\nFavourite track: “Been A Long Time (Waiting On Love)” just for the guitar fireworks of the last 3 minutes or so of the 8 minutes plus track\n\nSound Awake by Karnivool\n\nSound Awake was the second studio album from singer Ian Kenny’s “other” band\n\nKarnivool was singer Ian Kenny’s original band before also joining Birds Of Tokyo. Despite this, Karnivool have only released three albums whereas Birds Of Tokyo have released six. I think this album is brilliant and is still on high rotation more than a decade after acquiring it. The album was also a success debuting at number two on the ARIA charts and achieving Gold certification for sales in Australia. Two singles were also released from the album.\n\nFavourite track: The epic “New Day”\n\nChickenfoot by Chickenfoot\n\nChickenfoot was the self-titled debut of the band which was released in June 2009\n\nThis is the first of two “supergroups” to feature in my favourite five albums of 2009. This band features one my favourite guitarists, Joe Satriani, on guitar. It also includes drummer Chad Smith of Red Hot Chili Peppers and two ex-Van Halen members, Michael Anthony on bass and vocalist/guitarist Sammy Hagar. What a line-up! Three singles were released from the album and it achieved the top five in both the US and Canada.\n\nFavourite track: “Soap On A Rope”\n\nThem Crooked Vultures by Them Crooked Vultures\n\nPrior to the release of this album Cream was my favourite “supergroup”\n\nThem Crooked Vultures included Josh Homme of Queens Of The Stone Age on guitar and vocals, Dave Grohl of Nirvana/Foo Fighters on drums and former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. This band absolutely rocks! I love this album so much it would be in my top ten albums of all time and one of my “desert island discs” as they say. The album was a success reaching the top 5 in Australia, Norway, Belgium, Canada and New Zealand. It also made the top 20 in the US, Germany, the UK and Ireland.\n\nFavourite track: “Bandoliers”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2008\n\nDeath Magnetic by Metallica\n\nDeath Magnetic, Metallica’s 9th studio album, was released 5 years after St. Anger\n\nDeath Magnetic became Metallica’s fifth number one album in a row on the US charts upon its release. For many fans it was seen as a return to form after the much-maligned St. Anger. I didn’t mind St. Anger myself, but this album was way better in my opinion. I enjoy every track on it and six singles were released. It topped the album charts all around the world and even the tracks that didn’t make the cut, were released as an EP called Beyond Magnetic a couple of years later.\n\nFavourite track: “The Day That Never Comes”\n\nBlack Ice by AC/DC\n\nBlack Ice is AC/DC’s 15th studio album and the 9th recorded with Brian Johnson\n\nProducer Brendan O’Brien set out to push AC/DC to sound more like they did in the 1970s on this album. He felt that the previous two albums had been more blues-oriented and instead wanted them to focus more on the melodic side with strong choruses. Four singles were released and the album was a multi-platinum seller around the world.\n\nFavourite track: “Big Jack”\n\nThe Long Now by Children Collide\n\nThe Long Now was the debut studio album from the Melbourne-based indie band\n\nI first heard this thanks to my co-host on community radio at the time of the album’s release. He added one of the album’s singles to our playlist and I have been a fan of the band ever since and own all of their albums (four at the time of writing). Four singles were released from the album and they received airplay on Australian radio station Triple J.\n\nFavourite track: “Social Currency”\n\nAlong Came A Spider by Alice Cooper\n\nCooper’s 18th studio album was his highest charting in the US since 1991’s Hey Stoopid\n\nI really enjoyed this and Alice has never been afraid to make a concept album. The premise here is based on a serial killer called “Spider” collecting a leg from each of his victims to make his own arachnid. He is brought down by falling in love with the 8th victim. I was totally chuffed when it is revealed at the end that “Spider” is actually the character Steven from Cooper’s 1975 album, Welcome To My NIghtmare.\n\nFavourite track: “The One That Got Away”\n\nIndestructible by Disturbed\n\nIndestructible was the fourth studio album released by the American heavy metal band\n\nDebuting at number one on the US charts, Indestructible also topped the charts in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Four singles were released from the album and “Inside The Fire” was even nominated for a Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance. It was the first of their albums I purchased and ended up buying its predecessors as well as those released since.\n\nFavourite track: “The Night”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2007\n\nDark Passion Play by Nightwish\n\nDark Passion Play was the 1st of two studio albums featuring Anette Olzon as lead vocalist\n\nAfter original Nightwish lead singer Tarja Turunen’s departure from the band, none of the band’s fans knew what to expect going forward. Anette Olzon was announced as the new lead singer of the band and the album Dark Passion Play was released in September 2007. The album was a top 5 success all over Europe and topped the charts in five countries. Although a completely different vocalist Olzon blended with the band straight away and did not sound out of place at all.\n\nFavourite track: The album-opening epic “The Poet And The Pendulum”\n\nMagic by Bruce Springsteen\n\nMagic was Bruce Springsteen’s 15th studio album and 8th recorded with the E Street Band\n\nFor me, Springsteen is always at his best when recording with the E Street Band. This was the first album he had recorded with them since 2002’s The Rising. Although it doesn’t scale the heights of his masterpiece albums like Darkness On The Edge Of Town or Born To Run, Magic holds its own against the majority of his back catalogue. The album was a top ten success around the world and reached number one in ten countries.\n\nFavourite track: Lead single “Radio Nowhere”\n\nLove And Paranoia by Regurgitator\n\nThe majority of Regurgitator’s sixth studio album was recorded in Brazil\n\nAdding a fourth member was an inspired decision and Seja Vogel added both her vocals and keyboards to their sound. The album was 80s influenced and lyrically was loosely based around either romantic love or fear and paranoia as indicated by the album’s title. I really enjoyed this album and although I like the majority of their material, I have a soft spot for this one.\n\nFavourite track: “Romance Of The Damned”\n\nRaising Sand by Robert Plant & Alison Krauss\n\nT-Bone Burnett produced the album by the pair and selected the songs they should cover\n\nIn what initially appeared like an unlikely pairing, no one was more surprised than me how good this was. Their voices blend amazingly well and T-Bone Burnett’s song choices were inspired and worked amazingly well for both singers. The album won Album Of The Year at the Grammys and performed well on charts around the world.\n\nFavourite track: “Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us”\n\nBlackbird by Alter Bridge\n\nAlter Bridge pulled out all the stops for their second studio album helping make the band\n\nOne Day Remains was a great debut album but Blackbird was truly a creative leap from its predecessor. Four singles were released from the album to varying success yet the album charted reasonably well. The first album was mostly written before lead vocalist Myles Kennedy joined the band so his song-writing contributions are notable on this album and it was all for the better.\n\nFavourite track: Title track “Blackbird” featuring one of the finest guitar solos ever recorded, in my humble opinion\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2006\n\nAll The Roadrunning by Mark Knopfler & Emmylou Harris\n\nBoth regular collaborators with others, these two took seven years to complete the album\n\nI tend not to listen to much of anything with a country flavour but I have made the odd exception over the years, including this album. They work so well together and I admit to being pleasantly surprised when I first heard the album. The album was a success for the pair and they followed it up with a successful tour and corresponding live album.\n\nFavourite track: “Red Staggerwing”\n\nBlood Mountain by Mastodon\n\nMastodon’s third album was my first taste of this American heavy metal act\n\nI stumbled across Mastodon through one of those free sampler compilation CDs that used to come with music magazines, remember those? I bought this album on the strength of one song and have bought every album they have released since. The album is a concept album about climbing a mountain, getting lost in the woods, starving, hallucinating, hunted and running into strange creatures apparently.\n\nFavourite track: “Sleeping Giant”\n\nLive To Win by Paul Stanley\n\nLive To Win is only the 2nd solo album from the KISS founder released 28 years after the first\n\nSounding unsurprisingly much like his regular band, Stanley collaborated on this album with songwriters he had worked with before in Holly Knight and Desmond Child. He also drafted former KISS guitarist, Bruce Kulick, to play bass on a few tracks. I was unsure what to expect when this came out but I needn’t have worried. As a KISS fan who actually enjoys their music, I was always going to like this.\n\nFavourite track: “Bulletproof”\n\nThe Road To Escondido by J.J. Cale & Eric Clapton\n\nThis collaboration album features the final recordings from keyboardist Billy Preston\n\nClapton has always been a fan of J.J. Cale and has recorded several of his songs throughout his career, usually achieving greater success than the originals. 11 of the 14 songs on the album are Cale compositions so it effectively works as a J.J. Cale album featuring Eric Clapton. But that is also its charm.\n\nFavourite track: Their cover of the Brownie McGhee composition “Sporting Life Blues”\n\nBlack Holes & Revelations by Muse\n\nBlack Holes & Revelations was the fourth studio album released by English rock band Muse\n\nThis is one of only two Muse albums in my collection. I have liked several of their songs over the years but have found some of their albums overwrought. Not so with this one and it deservedly topped the charts all around the world. Five singles were released which were quite successful, particularly in the UK. The album cover was designed by Storm Thorgerson, renowned for working with Pink Floyd.\n\nFavourite track: “Knights Of Cydonia”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2005\n\nAerial by Kate Bush\n\nKate Bush’s eighth studio album, Aerial, was released as a double album in November 2005\n\nThey say absence makes the heart grow fonder. But what does it do to a musical career? Aerial was released after a twelve year hiatus, during which time Kate Bush devoted herself to her family and raising her son. This double album is a tour de force and for my taste is her finest since Hounds Of Love. The first disc is subtitled A Sea Of Honey and features a number of unconnected songs. The second disc, subtitled A Sky Of Honey, consists of single musical piece representing outdoor adventures over a 24 hour period.\n\nFavourite track: The magnificent hit single “King Of The Mountain”\n\nWolfmother by Wolfmother\n\nWolfmother’s debut self-titled album was released in Australia in October 2005\n\nWolfmother received high rotation on Australian radio station Triple J upon release and won the station’s inaugural J Award. They weren’t afraid to proudly wear their influences on their sleeves and the album’s sound was reminiscent of early 70s hard rockers like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. The album reached the top 3 in Australia and achieved five times platinum in sales on the back of six singles released from the album. Although not as successful when released in the US & the UK it did achieve top 30 in the album charts in both markets.\n\nFavourite track: Their highest charting single “Joker & The Thief”, which was also featured in the motion picture soundtrack for Shrek The Third\n\nWith Teeth by Nine Inch Nails\n\nWith Teeth was the fourth studio album released by the band and is catalogued as Halo 19\n\nFeaturing three singles and more rock-oriented songs, With Teeth, is probably the most accessible Nine Inch Nails album since Pretty Hate Machine. I found the songs to be quite catchy and the whole album a much more comfortable and enjoyable listen than either The Fragile of The Downward Spiral. Although I like those albums too they are a more challenging listen that you need to be in the mood for.\n\nFavourite track: The album opener “All The Love In The World”\n\nTea & Sympathy by Bernard Fanning\n\nTea & Sympathy was the debut solo album of the former Powderfinger lead singer\n\nReleased while Powderfinger were on hiatus, Bernard Fanning had a ready-made audience for his debut album. Although a slightly different sound to his band it wasn’t far enough removed to deter their fanbase, so the album performed well, topping the Australian charts. It also won three ARIA Awards and an APRA Award. I liked it right from the first time I heard it and I still do.\n\nFavourite track: “Songbird” which was released as the second single off the album\n\nMezmerize/Hypnotize by System Of A Down\n\nMezmerize was released on the 17th May 2005\n\nHypnotize was released on 22nd November 2005\n\nAlthough released six months apart, Mezmerize and Hypnotize were two parts of the same whole. Mezmerize opens with an excerpt from the closing track of Hypnotize effectively bookending the two albums. I think they are both great albums and either would be capable of standing on its own two feet. The fact that they work as companion albums is an added bonus. I do wonder if it exhausted them creatively though, as ultimately the band pretty much fell apart and haven’t released any new original music since.\n\nFavourite track: “B.Y.O.B.” an acronym for Bring Your Own Bomb\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2004\n\nOnce by Nightwish\n\nOnce, the 5th studio album by Nightwish and last to feature original vocalist Tarja Turunen\n\nThanks to a sampler DVD which came with another purchase, I discovered Nightwish by watching the music video for lead single “Nemo”. I was intrigued and was already into symphonic metal largely due to another band that features later in this blog post. The vocals were extraordinary so I wasn’t surprised to discover that lead vocalist, Tarja Turunen, had been opera-trained. She was asked to leave the band after this album which although I was originally disappointed, it just meant I now had a solo career to follow as well as that of Nightwish.\n\nFavourite track: “Dead Gardens”\n\nSeven Circles by The Tea Party\n\nSeven Circles would be the last studio album released by the band for a decade\n\nThe Tea Party broke up after the tour that accompanied the release of this album in 2005. It was a surprise to the other band members, as singer Jeff Martin announced his solo career. They had assumed the band was just going on hiatus for a while. In the end that turned out to be the case when they reformed in 2011. Seven Circles was a success for the band, particularly in Australia and their native Canada, and two promotional singles were released. The track “Empty Glass” appears to be some sort of tribute to David Bowie as its lyrics include the terms Major Tom, diamond dogs, starman and golden years.\n\nFavourite track: “Stargazer”\n\nMach Schau by Hoodoo Gurus\n\nEnding an 8 year gap between albums Mach Schau was released by the re-formed band\n\nHoodoo Gurus broke up in the late 1990s but reformed in 2003 before going on to record this album. I am sure that I was not alone in thinking the break-up would end the band and was very pleasantly surprised when they got back together. For me, this was their best album in many years and I was very pleased with what my ears were receiving when I took it home on its first day of release.\n\nFavourite track: Album opener “Chop”\n\nLemuria/Sirius B by Therion\n\nLemuria and Sirius B were released simultaneously by Therion on 24th May 2004\n\nWhat’s better than a new album from your favourite Swedish symphonic metal band? Why, two new albums of course! I was blown away by how good both these albums were as there was not a weak track between them in my humble opinion. A work colleague in the late 1990s got me into them and I have been a fan ever since. Lemuria apparently refers to a lost continent much like the mythical Atlantis and Sirius B to the twin star of Sirius A. As one would expect from Therion, the albums’ lyrics feature mythical creatures, deities and religious sects.\n\nFavourite track: “The Blood Of Kingu”\n\nIs There Love In Space? by Joe Satriani\n\nIs There Love In Space? is the tenth studio album by guitar virtuoso Joe Satriani\n\nThe ever-reliable Joe Satriani returned with another guitar master class with the release of Is There Love In Space? in April 2004. As always with an artist I know and love, I bought it first day out as I couldn’t wait to hear it. That’s how music used to work, you had to have the physical version in order to hear the material! To this day I still like holding something physical when I purchase music.\n\nFavourite track: “If I Could Fly”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2003\n\nDe-Loused In The Comatorium by The Mars Volta\n\nThe Mars Volta was formed by former members of At The Drive-In after their break-up\n\nThis album completely blew me away and it was so unexpected. I liked At The Drive-In but not enough to go out and buy one of their albums (although the track “One Armed Scissor” is amazingly good). I loved this from the get-go and still listen to the album regularly. Apparently the concept album is based on a short story about Cerpin Taxt, a man who enters a week-long coma after overdosing on a mixture of morphine and rat poison. Now there’s a premise for an album…\n\nFavourite track: “Inertiatic ESP”\n\nVulture Street by Powderfinger\n\nPowderfinger’s fifth studio album, Vulture Street, won the ARIA for Best Rock Album\n\nVulture Street peaked at #1 on the Australian albums chart and four singles were released from the album. Overall it was a very successful follow-up to its predecessor Odyssey Number Five, although the band had decided to deliberately go in a more rock-oriented direction with the intent of creating an album more fun to play live. Whatever their thinking was behind the album it definitely worked.\n\nFavourite track: Album opener “Rockin’ Rocks” setting the scene for the rest of the album\n\nKiss My Grass: A Hillbilly Tribute To Kiss by Hayseed Dixie\n\nHearing Kiss tracks performed in a bluegrass style is certainly a unique experience\n\nI had already heard Haysee Dixie’s treatments of AC/DC tracks prior to this albums release so when I heard they were doing the same thing to my favourite band’s songs I had to have it. I have no regrets and I think their arrangements are quite cleverly done. They even dub their own style of music as “rockgrass” by focussing on covering hard rock tracks in a bluegrass style.\n\nFavourite track: Although not my favourite Kiss track, “Let’s Put The X In Sex” is outright hilarious when given the Hayseed Dixie treatment\n\nBlackout by Dropkick Murphys\n\nBlackout is the fourth studio album from American Celtic punk band, Dropkick Murphys\n\nAlthough similar in intent to the Pogues, Dropkick Murphys rock harder and are far punkier (if there is such a word). I actually heard them for the first time by watching the Martin Scorsese picture The Departed, which featured in its soundtrack their brilliant track “I’m Shipping Up To Boston” featuring lyrics by Woody Guthrie. What a discovery they turned out to be!\n\nFavourite track: The fantastic duet “The Dirty Glass”\n\nTough Love by Magic Dirt\n\nTough Love was Magic Dirt’s fourth and most commercially successful album\n\nThe band worked particularly hard on Tough Love and they found it difficult due to its regimented and disciplined recording process. So much so they vowed never to record that way again. The fruit of their labours was definitely worth the effort though and it remains my favourite of their albums.\n\nFavourite track: The simply fantastic “Vulcanella”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2002\n\nThe Rising by Bruce Springsteen\n\nThe Rising was the first album fully recorded with the E Street Band since Born In The USA\n\nThe Rising was an instant commercial and critical success for Springsteen. Unsurprising as it is the first full album recorded with the E Street Band since their reunion. They always seem to bring out the best in him in my opinion. Written in the aftermath of 9/11 in contains some of his most poignant work. The album topped the charts around the world and three singles were released. He then launched a successful world tour supporting the album and I finally got my chance to see him live at an outdoor gig at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n\nFavourite track: “You’re MIssing”\n\nSongs For The Deaf by Queens Of The Stone Age\n\nSongs For The Deaf, a concept album taking the listener driving through the California desert\n\nFeaturing Dave Grohl on drums, Songs For The Deaf was the third studio album from Queens Of The Stone Age. The late Mark Lanegan, formerly of Screaming Trees, was also a member of the band at the time of recording. Three singles were released from the album and it was very successful for the band making the top 10 in the UK, Norway, Australia, Belgium and Germany.\n\nFavourite track: The fantastic lead single “No One Knows”\n\nUp by Peter Gabriel\n\nExcluding Gabriel’s soundtrack work Up was his seventh studio album and thirteenth overall\n\nInitially I found this album quite different to what I was expecting from Peter Gabriel, but like a fungal infection it grew on me. I now consider it a masterpiece on a par with Us and So. Largely concerning themes of death, it is considerably darker than his previous work. But that is also its appeal. Four singles were released and it was another successful album for Gabriel.\n\nFavourite track: “Growing Up”\n\nBy The Way by Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\nThe eighth studio album from Red Hit Chili Peppers went on to sell 8 million copies\n\nGuitarist John Frusciante has gone on record to say that writing this album was one of the happiest times of his life. It shows in the material, which has a strong melodic focus and little of the funk fusion that made their name. Four singles were released and it peaked at #1 on numerous album charts around the world.\n\nFavourite track: “The Zephyr Song”\n\nStrange Beautiful Music by Joe Satriani\n\nVirtuoso guitarist Joe Satriani released his ninth studio album in June 2002\n\nI have bought everything Joe Satriani has released ever since I became a fan upon hearing Surfing With The Alien. His releases never disappoint and I am continually amazed by his compositions as he somehow allows the music to breathe even when playing at his fastest. Someone else summed up his abilities as having the knack of knowing when not to play.\n\nFavourite track: “Chords Of Life”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2001\n\nThat’s What I Am by Eric Gales\n\nChild prodigy Eric Gales released his first solo album at the ripe old age of 27\n\nHaving released two albums with his band in 1991 and 1993 respectively and another with his brothers in 1996, it was surprising that his first real solo album didn’t come until later. Primarily showcasing his guitar chops the album also features hip-hop style vocals, turntable scratching and a fiery cover of Jimi Hendrix’s “Foxey Lady”, an artist he is often compared to. He is much funkier here than was indicated on his previous releases.\n\nFavourite track: “Insane”\n\nLateralus by Tool\n\nThe album arrived five years after its predecessor mostly due to legal issues with their label\n\nLateralus is quite epic in its scope compared to previous Tool releases and even includes one three track song cycle that totals more than 23 minutes in length. As a big fan of Tool I was always going to like this although I still prefer Ænima. It rewards repeated listening, as does much of their work, not least due to the complexity of the rhythm changes and the album’s dynamic sound.\n\nFavourite track: Album opener “The Grudge”\n\nWatching The World by Primary\n\nPrimary was my first taste of the vocal stylings of Connie Mitchell, it would not be my last\n\nBefore a brief stint with Machine Gun Fellatio and joining Sneaky Sound System, Connie Mitchell performed vocals out the front of Primary. The Fonti brothers, previously members of Caligula, formed techno rock group Primary with Connie. I enjoyed their debut album This Is The Sound, but I thought their sound had improved markedly on this one and loved it right from the first listen.\n\nFavourite track: “Not For Me”\n\nGold by Ryan Adams\n\nReleased in September 2001, Gold was the second solo studio album by Ryan Adams\n\nI was never really a fan of Whiskeytown, which featured Adams on lead vocals and guitar, so I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy this album. I hadn’t heard his first solo album and so this was the first of his releases I had ever listened to in its entirety. Released only two weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the single “New York, New York” did well for the singer accordingly. His intent was to create a modern classic and he originally intended for it to be a double album, but sadly his record company didn’t agree.\n\nFavourite track: “Enemy Fire”\n\nStrange Little Girls by Tori Amos\n\nFour different album covers were available representing four different tracks from the album\n\nAmos released Strange Little Girls as a concept album reinterpreting songs written and performed by males, from a female perspective. If you didn’t know these songs otherwise you’d be mistaken for thinking them her own compositions so unique are her interpretations. I have been a fan of Tori’s work since her debut so I soon as I heard which songs she’d be covering I knew I would have to get my hands on it.\n\nFavourite track: Her unusual take on Slayer’s thrash metal classic “Raining Blood”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 2000\n\nSmoke & Mirrors by The Radiators\n\nSmoke & Mirrors was the seventh and final studio album released by The Radiators\n\nAustralian pub rockers the Radiators, more commonly known as the Rads, have been around for what feels like forever. This is probably because they haven’t stopped their constant gigging since their inception in 1978. I have always been a big fan and have seen them live 11 times. I was pleasantly surprised when this album came out, as it had been seven years since their self-titled previous album (although a couple of EPs had been released in between). It has the sound of their classic material and I am sure it would be enjoyed by fans of the band even if it didn’t win them any new ones.\n\nFavourite track: “Ocean Blue”, in some ways reminiscent of “Summer Holiday” from their 1980 debut\n\nRiding With The King by B.B. King & Eric Clapton\n\nWhat do you do when two of your favourite blues artists record an album? Buy it of course!\n\nAs soon as I heard this album was coming out I made a note in my desk calendar (they used to be a thing once upon a time), to remind me to go out and buy it on the day of release. I was not disappointed and I adore enjoy every track on it. Featuring predominantly revisited tracks from King’s earlier career and cover versions, B.B. shares the lead vocal duties with Clapton on most of the album. Unsurprisingly the album was a success achieving double platinum sales in the US, reaching the top 5 in the album charts around the world and winning a Grammy for Best Traditional Blues Album.\n\nFavourite track: The cover of “Marry You” originally recorded by Doyle Bramhall II, who also plays on the album\n\nBrutal Planet by Alice Cooper\n\nBrutal Planet was the fourteenth solo studio album released by Alice Cooper in June 2000\n\nGoing for a much darker and heavier sound than his 90s material was an interesting change in direction for Alice. This was almost industrial metal and although it did not appeal to some listeners, it really worked for me. The album features regular contributor Ryan Roxie on guitar and KISS drummer Eric Singer.\n\nFavourite track: “Pessi-Mystic” just for the lyric “I’m so pissed-off-istic“\n\nOdyssey Number Five by Powderfinger\n\nOdyssey Number Five was the most successful album of Powderfinger’s career\n\nPowderfinger’s fourth studio album, Odyssey Number Five, won the band several ARIA Music Awards including Highest Selling Album, Best Group and Best Rock Album. Four singles were released, the second of which “My Happiness”, won the ARIA for Single Of The Year and peaked at #4 in the Australian music charts as well as topping radio station Triple J’s Hottest 100. I was already a fan of the band before the album so they just continued to grow in stature for me.\n\nFavourite track: “Like A Dog”\n\nDaisies Of The Galaxy by Eels\n\nDaisies Of The Galaxy was the third studio album released by American rock band Eels\n\nIn my opinion this is a fine album of catchy pop music on the whole with some darker edges. Along with the usual suspects of Mark Oliver Everett aka E playing the majority of the instruments and Butch on drums, the album features guest musicians such as Grant-Lee Phillips and REM’s Peter Buck. The album achieved gold record sales in the UK, Belgium and Australia. It also made the top 40 in Ireland, France and Norway.\n\nFavourite track: “Mr E’s Beautiful Blues”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 1999\n\nHere are my favourite five albums from 1999 to finish off the 90s decade.\n\nCalifornication by Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\nCalifornication is the 3rd album from Red Hot Chili Peppers to be produced by Rick Rubin\n\nReuniting with John Frusciante was a wise move from Red Hot Chili Peppers and ultimately resulted in another very successful album for the band. Five singles were released and the album topped the charts all around the world (pun intended). Millions of copies were sold and it remains one of their best sellers most likely due to having a more melodic sound than the previous six albums.\n\nFavourite track: “Scar Tissue”\n\nSupernatural by Santana\n\nUnbelievably, prior to the release of this album Santana did not have a record contract\n\nCarlos Santana decided that he would work with Clive Davis, who originally signed Santana to Columbia in 1969, ultimately signing with Arista prior to the release of the album. Santana had decided that he wanted to go in a more pop-oriented direction and that Clive Davis would be the right man for the job. He wanted to produce radio-friendly songs with strong melodies and collaborate with contemporary musicians. Six singles were released and 30 million copies of the album were sold, clearly a runaway success.\n\nFavourite track: “Smooth”, featuring Matchbox Twenty’s Rob Thomas on vocals\n\nGrand Slam by Spiderbait\n\nSpiderbait’s fourth album went in a poppier direction than previous albums\n\nGrand Slam achieved gold sales in Australia and made the top ten albums chart. Four singles were released from the album mostly featuring bass player Janet English’s vocals. Phil McKellar, who had worked at the ABC and youth station Triple J, was the perfect choice to produce the album for the band managing to capture the sound they were after.\n\nFavourite track: “Shazam!”\n\nThere Is Nothing Left To Lose by Foo Fighters\n\nThere Is Nothing Left To Lose’s cover features the band’s initials on the back of Grohl’s neck\n\nThe third album from Dave Grohl’s Foo Fighters is also the first to feature Taylor Hawkins on drums. Five singles were released from the album and it has a softer more experimental sound than its predecessors. The album was a top ten hit in Australia, the US, Norway, Canada, Sweden and the UK. It would also win the band their first Grammy, winning for Best Rock Album.\n\nFavourite track: “Stacked Actors”\n\nBorn Again Savage by Little Steven\n\nAfter a gap of a decade, Little Steven released his fifth studio album in 1999\n\nIn the liner notes for this album Little Steven claims this would have been the album he would have released in 1969 if he had been capable. It describes its loose garage rock sound and the power trio band line-up. Featuring his own guitar and vocals, Little Steven managed to get Jason Bonham to play drums and U2’s Adam Clayton to play bass. After the album’s release he would return to Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band for the next 18 years.\n\nFavourite track: “Guns, Drugs And Gasoline”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 1998\n\nPsycho Circus by KISS\n\nThe album featured a lenticular cover alternating between the KISS logo and a circus image\n\nPsycho Circus was hailed as the return of the original line-up in the studio on the back of their worldwide tour together. In truth, original drummer Peter Criss only plays drums on one track and original guitarist Ace Frehley plays guitar on two. The album does feature vocals from all four originals however. Despite their limited involvement, KISS had not seemed this invigorated for years and it remains the last decent album they have made. Four singles were released to promote the album and it was a top five hit in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, the US and Sweden.\n\nFavourite track: “Psycho Circus”, the title track and lead single\n\nwww. tism. wanker. com by TISM\n\nTISM (This Is Serious Mum) are noted for their dark, sarcastic humour and anonymity\n\nOne of the tracks on this album inspired Bruce Ruxton, the former head of the RSL, to write to TISM’s record label to complain about lowering standards to the sewer. TISM unsurprisingly published it on their website to help promote the album. The album was TISM’s fourth studio album and four singles were released to promote it. It was nominated for Best Independent Release at the ARIA Awards.\n\nFavourite track: “Thunderbirds Are Coming Out”\n\nPilgrim by Eric Clapton\n\nPilgrim would be the first of several Eric Clapton solo albums produced by Simon Climie\n\nHaving first collaborated with Simon Climie as TDF in 1997, Clapton had him produce his next solo album, Pilgrim, which was released in March 1998. Although most critics didn’t like this album, I still did. Clearly I wasn’t alone as it became one of his most successful albums reaching the top ten in 22 countries. Five singles were also released from the album including “Circus”, written about the last night he spent with his four year old son Conor before his untimely death.\n\nFavourite track: “Fall Like Rain”\n\nMechanical Animals by Marilyn Manson\n\nMechanical Animals is the 3rd studio album by the band fronted by Brian Warner\n\nAlthough Marilyn Manson had made their name prior to this album, in reality there was nothing new about their “shock” tactics. Like many artists before, Alice Cooper and KISS for example, they realised that controversy meant publicity and publicity meant sales. Musically however, this album was more akin to glam than the harder-edged industrial rock they had been known for. Maybe that’s why I like this album so much.\n\nFavourite track: “Rock Is Dead” just beating out “The Speed Of Pain”\n\nWords And Music by Paul Kelly\n\nIncluding his work with the Dots, Words And Music is Paul Kelly’s 11th studio album\n\nThis 1998 release from legendary Australian singer/songwriter Paul Kelly, was for me his best album since parting ways with his Coloured Girls/Messengers band line-up. The album reached the top 20 in Australia achieving Gold sales status and also reached the top 50 in New Zealand. Along with his then current band line-up, the album featured three Australian female vocalists in Renee Geyer, Monique Brumby and Rebecca Barnard. Four singles were released from the album.\n\nFavourite track: The Prince-inspired “Nothing On My Mind”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 1997\n\n1997 saw the release of some of my favourite albums of the 90s decade. This year was full of music that appealed to me, so it remains another where I found it hard to limit myself to five with some classic albums left off the list.\n\nUnit by Regurgitator\n\nUnit’s simplistic artwork has seen it become iconic and instantly identifiable\n\nUnit was a radical shift in Regurgitator’s sound and was unlike any of their previous material. Wearing their 80s influences on their sleeves they pre-empted the backlash from their original fans by penning “I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your Knew Stuff”. This remains my favourite Australian album of the 1990s. It made the top 5 in Australia, top ten in New Zealand and won 5 ARIA Awards including Album Of The Year.\n\nFavourite track: “! (The Song Formerly Known As)”\n\nBlue Moon Swamp by John Fogerty\n\nJohn Fogerty’s fifth solo album was released more than a decade after its predecessor\n\nAfter a long absence Fogerty returned to the world of popular music with the release of this album. It was a critical and commercial success and won a Grammy for best rock album. The album achieved platinum sales status in Australia and gold in the US. It was a top 20 album in Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and Belgium. Several singles were released from the album which no doubt contributed to its success.\n\nFavourite track: “Walking In A Hurricane”\n\nOK Computer by Radiohead\n\nRadiohead’s third studio album won the Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album\n\nIn 2014 OK Computer was included by the United States Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry as “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant”. This is indicative of how influential and revered this album has become. I consider this one of my favourite albums of the 90s decade and I still enjoy it enormously. Although the singles made me want to buy the album, I was pleasantly surprised when I got home and discovered the whole thing was of the same high quality.\n\nFavourite track: “Subterranean Homesick Alien”\n\nTransmission by The Tea Party\n\nTransmission was the fourth album released by Canadian rock band The Tea Party\n\nThe Tea Party expanded their sound on Transmission by adding electronic instruments to their usual mix of world music, rock and blues. In places the album featured acoustic instruments alongside samples, loops and sequencers. The lyrics were influenced by dystopian fiction and the album continued their success with five singles released from the album. The album did particularly well in Australia, where the album made top 5, also doing well by peaking at #3 in their home base of Canada.\n\nFavourite track: Lead single “Temptation”\n\nEarthling by David Bowie\n\nReleased in February 1997, Earthling was David Bowie’s 21st studio album\n\nI really enjoyed the sound of Outside upon its release in 1995 and was disappointed that the final two albums of what was intended to be a trilogy were not happening. My disappointment was short-lived however as Bowie gave us this. Continuing the industrial sound of its predecessor this was a far more accessible album. Five singles were released and the album was a top 40 hit around the world.\n\nFavourite track: “Little Wonder”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 1996\n\n12 Golden Country Greats by Ween\n\nDespite its title the album only features 10 tracks whilst the 12 represents the veteran musos\n\nThis is Ween’s fifth studio album and musically, was a radical change in direction. Employing a bunch of Nashville musicians to create a genuine Nashville-sounding country album was a surprise to many of their fans. Some of the musicians they asked turned them down however, due to the lyrical content of their songs. Ween retained their familiar juvenile comedic lyrics on some of the tracks as per their previous material, yet musically the tracks are very faithful to the intended Nashville sound. Part pisstake and part faithful homage, I really enjoyed it. Some of the lyrical content hasn’t aged well however.\n\nFavourite Track: “Help Me Scrape The Mucus Off My Brain”\n\nÆnima by Tool\n\nTool followed up their much-loved debut Undertow, with the masterpiece Ænima\n\nThe album was very successful for Tool, debuting at #2 on the US charts and eventually earning triple platinum sales. The title track would also win a Grammy for Best Metal Performance. I loved this album from the moment I first heard it and eagerly purchased 4 tickets so I could go see them live with a few friends, as they were coming to Canberra to play at the ANU Bar. Come the night of the concert I discovered my tickets had been stolen, so not only could we not go, I was out of pocket for 4 tickets. I eventually got to see them 22 years later. This remains another of my favourite albums of the 90s decade.\n\nFavourite track: “Forty Six And 2”\n\nBoys For Pele by Tori Amos\n\nBoys For Pele was the third studio album by Tori Amos, released in January 1996\n\nI have been following the career of Tori Amos since her debut album. I remember buying this on the day of release having already heard the single, “Caught A Light Sneeze”. In terms of its sound, it was more diverse and adventurous than some of her previous work and I loved it straight away. According to interviews she gave at the time, Amos conceived of the songs as representing stealing fire from the men in her life as well as a journey to finding her own fire as a woman.\n\nFavourite track: “In The Springtime Of His Voodoo”\n\nBooth And The Bad Angel by Booth And The Bad Angel\n\nThe only album released by the collaboration between Tim Booth & Angelo Badalamenti\n\nI don’t know who came up with the idea for Tim Booth of James and Twin Peaks soundtrack composer Angelo Badalamenti to work together, but it was a stroke of genius. This much under-rated album still gets listened to on a semi-regular basis and I still enjoy it every time. It peaked at #35 on the UK charts but I cannot find any data on how it performed elsewhere (most likely because it didn’t). This is a hidden gem in my opinion and if you can find a copy on a digital stream or elsewhere, I highly recommend you give it a listen.\n\nFavourite track: “Dance Of The Bad Angels”\n\nThe Masquerade Overture by Pendragon\n\nThe Gloucestershire band released their fifth album, the Masquerade Overture, in 1996\n\nMusically, Pendragon are often-described as neo-progressive rock and were considered contemporaries of Marillion, often supporting them on their tours in the early 1980s. I heard this album through a friend around the time of its release so subsequently had to get hold of my own copy. It turned out to be a wise decision as I still enjoy the album now.\n\nFavourite track: “Paintbox”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 1995\n\nThe Bends by Radiohead\n\nEnglish rock band Radiohead released their second studio album, The Bends, in March 1995\n\nFor me, this was a massive improvement on their debut and really showed how much their songwriting had matured. Although it didn’t have anything that sounded like hit single “Creep” from their debut album Pablo Honey, it did receive greater critical acclaim. In the end six singles were released from the album, each with an accompanying music video.\n\nFavourite track: “Just”, which I love both for the music and its intriguing music video\n\nA Million Year Girl by Max Sharam\n\nThree hit wonder Max Sharam, released her only studio album to date in May 1995\n\nMax Sharam has had a very diverse career. She spent several years busking around Europe before landing a lead role in a hit Italian opera. She toured with musical around Europe for two years. She received an award for her efforts, released a dance EP and then spent a year in Japan studying Taiko drums. She returned to Australia and spent time as a stand-up comedian before performing her song “Coma” on TV’s New Faces. This garnered her music label attention ultimately leading to the recording of this album. I loved the singles and enjoy the whole album.\n\nFavourite track: “Can I Catch Fire?”\n\nStanley Road by Paul Weller\n\nThis was Paul Weller’s third studio album and was named after the street he grew up on\n\nFeaturing an album cover by Peter Blake, the artist behind the Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover, Stanley Road continued Paul Weller’s career rejuvenation. It was a commercial success for Weller and featured guest artists including Noel Gallagher and Steve Winwood. I enjoy the whole album immensely and some 28 years later can still put it on any time of day or night and enjoy it.\n\nFavourite track: The fantastic cover of Dr John’s “I Walk On Gilded Splinters”\n\nTo Bring You My Love by P.J. Harvey\n\nRecorded after her trio’s demise, this album is considered to be P.J. Harvey’s first solo outing\n\nThe material on this album is inspired by one of P.J. Harvey’s influences, Captain Beefheart, as well as American blues music in general. I remember being blown away by the first single and its music video, “Down By The Water”. I bought the album as soon as I could get my hands on a copy and it came with a VHS video featuring the music videos for “50ft Queenie”, “Mansize” and “Down By The Water”. It is a very successful album for her, achieving critical acclaim and chart success around the world.\n\nFavourite track: “Down By The Water” of course\n\nMellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness by the Smashing Pumpkins\n\nThis magnum opus from the Smashing Pumpkins was released in February 1995\n\nI absolutely love this album and consider it another of my favourites of the 90s decade. In the 1990s, many acts felt the need to pad out their albums to fill out a compact disc to maximise its 74 minute limit (79 minutes later on), as opposed to the 50 minutes of vinyl LPs. Often this created a mediocre album due to the amount of filler included. This is not the case here. Billy Corgan gave us a two hour masterpiece spread across two CDs, split as Dawn To Dusk and Twilight To Starlight. On the triple vinyl release the sides were Dawn, Tea Time, Dusk, Twilight, Midnight & Starlight. The album was a huge success around the world and spawned five singles.\n\nFavourite track: “Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 1994\n\nAmorica by the Black Crowes\n\nAmorica’s risque cover photo was taken from the July 1976 issue of Hustler magazine\n\nAmorica was the third studio album released by the Black Crowes and the second of three featuring what is for me the definitive line-up of Chris and Rich Robinson, Eddie Harsch, Marc Ford, Johnny Colt & Steve Gorman. The album was another successful one for the band, reaching the top 20 in Australia, the US and the Netherlands and made it in to the top 10 in the UK.\n\nFavourite track: “High Head Blues”\n\nThe Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails\n\nNine Inch Nails released their second studio album five years after their debut\n\nThe Downward Spiral was intended as a concept album detailing the self-destruction of a man from the beginning of his misanthropic “downward spiral” to his suicide. Dark and abrasive, I have always considered this both a challenging and rewarding listen. Progressive rock guitarist Adrian Belew, was given a brief that asked him play freely yet react to melody, concentrate on rhythm and use noise. He certainly stuck to the brief!\n\nFavourite track: “Hurt”, both the original version and the fantastic Johnny Cash cover version.\n\nAround The Next Dream by BBM\n\nBBM was an acronym for the last names of members Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce & Gary Moore\n\nIn 1993 legendary power trio Cream were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame and were briefly reunited to play a few tracks at the induction. Baker and Bruce wanted to reform and go on tour but Eric Clapton was not ready to do so (they would not reform until 2005). Not wanting to lose momentum they formed a short-lived trio with Gary Moore instead. They recorded just the one album, went on a short tour and then disbanded. Being a fan of both Cream and Gary Moore, I bought the album on its day of release and have loved it ever since.\n\nFavourite Track: The track featuring one of Gary Moore’s finest solos, “Why Does Love (Have To Go Wrong?)”\n\nGrace by Jeff Buckley\n\nJeff met his singer-songwriter father Tim Buckley, only once during their equally short lives\n\nWhen Grace was released sales were initially slow despite critical acclaim and celebrity endorsement from the likes of David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Brad Pitt, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. The album sold well in Australia and Buckley toured twice in late 1994 and early 1995. The album consisted of his own compositions alongside three covers, including his well-known take on Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”.\n\nFavourite track: “Last Goodbye”\n\nPurple by Stone Temple Pilots\n\nPurple, the hugely successful second album from Stone Temple Pilots, released in June 1994\n\nPurple debuted at number one on the US charts and would go on to sell six million copies. Three singles were released and were also successful. The album didn’t just do well in the US, it also topped the charts in Australia and was a top ten hit in Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and the UK. I love this whole album, including the hilarious hidden track, and I still listen to it as an album regularly.\n\nFavourite Track: “Big Empty”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 1993\n\nCure For Pain by Morphine\n\nCure For Pain was the second studio album of five released by Morphine\n\nThe unusual sound of Morphine was due to the intentional absence of guitar, relying primarily on bass, drums and saxophone. I loved them from the moment I first heard the track “Buena” on Australian alternative radio station Triple J. I was enamoured with their unusual sound and ended up buying all of their albums. Sadly bass player and lead singer, Mark Sandman, died instantly on stage due to heart attack in 1999 effectively ending the band.\n\nFavourite track: “Buena”\n\nSongs Of Faith And Devotion by Depeche Mode\n\nDarker than its predecessor, Depeche Mode’s eighth album was a successful follow-up\n\nDepeche Mode were really at their zenith in the nineties releasing several successful albums during the decade. I thought Violator almost impossible to top, but Songs Of Faith And Devotion certainly came close. The album was a top 20 chart hit in more than twenty countries and four successful singles were released.\n\nFavourite track: The original album version of “In Your Room”\n\nSymphonic Music Of Yes by London Philharmonic Orchestra & former Yes members\n\nSymphonic Music Of Yes was mixed in Dolby Surround Sound\n\nFeaturing former members of Yes, including original singer Jon Anderson on a couple of tracks and pairing them with the London Philharmonic Orchestra was a stroke of genius. Effectively coming across as a “greatest hits” album by Yes, the orchestrations really highlight the complexity of the compositions. I absolutely adore this album and have had people borrow it as a way of testing if their surround system has been set up correctly.\n\nFavourite track: “Starship Trooper”\n\nUndertow by Tool\n\nTool became one of my favourite bands virtually overnight due to this album\n\nI absolutely love Tool and enjoy all of their recordings. “Sober”, a single off this album, was the first song of theirs I ever heard and I loved its stop-motion music video too. I decided to buy the album on the strength of that one song and when I got it home I was blown away by how good it was. It was on high rotation for weeks on end both at home and in my car.\n\nFavourite track: “Bottom” featuring the “engaging” spoken words of Henry Rollins\n\nDebut by Björk\n\nDebut was technically incorrect having released a self-titled album as a child in 1977\n\nThis solo album was Björk’s first release after the break-up of her previous band the Sugarcubes. Preceded by the single “Human Behaviour”, nothing else around at this time sounded anything remotely like this. The uniqueness of her sound no doubt contributed to her appeal as I know it what made me seek out the album. There have been many imitators since, but none come close to the original.\n\nFavourite track: The non-album single “Play Dead”, which had been added to the album before its Australian release\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 1992\n\nUs by Peter Gabriel\n\nUs, was the follow-up to its highly successful predecessor, So, released 6 years earlier\n\nUs, was an appropriate title for an album that would focus on personal themes for Gabriel, including divorce as well as romantic and familial relationships. Five singles were released from the album, including two that featured Sinéad O’Connor on vocals. The album was one of the first to be promoted with interactive multimedia software that only worked on Macintosh computers. The album was another top ten success all around the world for Gabriel.\n\nFavourite track: The original video mix of “Kiss That Frog” which sadly now appears unavailable\n\nCut by Hunters & Collectors\n\nReleased in September 1992, Cut was the seventh studio album from Hunters & Collectors\n\nAfter discussions with almost 20 producers in an attempt to evolve the sound of the band, they settled on American Don Gehman. They recorded most of the album with him and he incorporated drum loops and electronic percussion into their sound. The recording was apparently an unhappy process for the band as several members didn’t like the change in direction. Few could fault its success though, with six singles released and a top ten album with platinum sales.\n\nFavourite track: “Head Above Water”\n\nLittle Earthquakes by Tori Amos\n\nLittle Earthquakes was the debut solo album from the Y Kant Tori Read lead singer\n\nFollowing the break-up of her former band, Tori Amos made several demos for Atlantic Records. Initially rejected, she kept trying and recorded more songs. These were more acceptable to the label and she moved to London at their request, as they believed the British public would be more accepting of her eccentric style. This was indeed correct and when the album was finally released in the UK it made the top 20 and was on the charts for 23 weeks. It was also critically and commercially successful in the US selling over 2 million copies. It also achieved gold record status in Australia, Belgium, the UK, the Netherlands and Canada.\n\nFavourite track: The hilarious “Leather”\n\nTear Of Thought by the Screaming Jets\n\nTear Of Thought was produced by Steve James, the son of comedian and actor, Sid James\n\nPreceded by the Living in England EP four months earlier, Tear Of Thought was a very successful sophomore album and a more than capable follow-up to their debut, All For One. Five singles were released from the album, including a cover of “Shivers”, originally recorded by the Boys Next Door with Nick Cave on lead vocals. The band expanded somewhat on the sound of their debut but it was still classic Aussie pub rock at its core. The album was a platinum-selling top 5 success for the band.\n\nFavourite track: “Think”, the album’s lead single\n\nTriage by David Baerwald\n\nA former member of David & David, this release was Baerwald’s second solo studio album\n\nThis is another of my favourite albums of the 90s decade. It is unlike anything else in my collection and contains a variety of musical styles. Apparently the album’s lyrics were inspired by a combination of conspiracy theories and politics. Fittingly, the liner notes contain photos of the FBI’s files on his father. Sales were modest, but for me it remains an under-appreciated masterpiece and is an album I never tire of.\n\nFavourite track: “The Got No Shotgun HydraHead Octopus Blues”\n\nFeatured post\n\nFavourite Five Of 1991\n\nSome may consider it sacrilege that Nevermind is not in my five favourite albums of 1991. I like the album generally and it has some fantastic songs on it, it just didn’t really do it for me as an album. I found the quality of the material inconsistent, although I accept how influential they were at the time to the grunge genre. So here’s at least five albums that I personally found more impressive.\n\nMetallica by Metallica\n\nMetallica’s fifth studio album was self-titled but became better known as “the black album”\n\nMetallica became the band’s best-selling album virtually overnight debuting at number one in ten countries. Although an instant success, five singles were also released from the album. It would also be the first of four albums they would record with producer Bob Rock. Some fans of the thrashier earlier style didn’t like the more radio-friendly sound of the album but for me, i found it a natural progression. I loved the whole album from start to finish right from the first listen.\n\nFavourite track: I found it very difficult to choose but I decided on “Wherever I May Roam”\n\nMama Said by Lenny Kravitz\n\nThis was the first Lenny Kravitz album I purchased but it would not be the last\n\nI had heard some of Lenny’s material from his debut album, Let Love Rule, although enjoyable it did not make me want to rush out and buy it. That all changed the instant I heard the lead single from this album, “Always On The Run”. Sure the solo from Slash contributed, but the whole thing was a smash as far as I was concerned. When I discovered he was a multi-instrumentalist and that the whole Mama Said album was of high quality, I was impressed further. I have bought every album he has released since and I went back and bought Let Love Rule too.\n\nFavourite track: The still impressive “Always On The Run”\n\nHolidays In Eden by Marillion\n\nMarillion’s sixth studio album was the second to feature Steve Hogarth on lead vocals\n\nFilling in the shoes of an iconic singer like Fish was always going to be a difficult ask. Steve Hogarth did a sterling job on his first album with the band, Season’s End, but it was on Holidays In Eden that he really cemented his place. This may be because this was his first album with the band where he was involved in the song-writing process right from the start, as opposed to coming in after the music had been written as was the case on the previous album. Steve Hogarth still performs lead vocals with Marillion today. The album reached the top ten in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK and three singles were released.\n\nFavourite track: The album’s first single “Cover My Eyes (Pain And Heaven)” featuring Steve Hogarth’s sublime vocals\n\nBaby Animals by Baby Animals\n\nAt the time of its release Baby Animals was the highest-selling debut Australian rock album\n\nDebuting at number six and topping the Australian charts for six weeks, was a rather audacious start for Baby Animals. It wasn’t lead singer Size DeMarchi’s first foray into music, having moved to London in the mid-80s and released some pop sing"
