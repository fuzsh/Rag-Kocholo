        "text": "Singer-Songwriter Series:\n\nDubbed \"Among the best folk-rock artists in the country\" by the Tucson Weekly, Namoli Brennet has been touring with her own brand of moody and inspiring folk since 2002. A recent Iowa transplant, Brennet was based out of Tucson, AZ for a decade and her music still carries some of the stark, persistent beauty of the desert. She's a breathtaking and moving performer, and her sweet, road-weary voice is as quick to deliver her wit and humor as it is a turn of phrase. Among her influences she names Patty Griffin and Eliza Gilkyson, but she manages to carve out a vocal niche of her own using her sweet, edgy alto. Zocalo magazine calls her music \"Gorgeous and introspective.\"\n\nShe's a top-notch songwriter who's well known for her insightful lyrics and poetic language, but it's her live performances that set her apart from the conventional label of singer/songwriter. On stage she reveals deft acoustic guitar chops, often incorporating foot percussion, loops, vocoder and Kaki-King style tapping to create a broad, layered soundscape. Namoli's 2012 Release, \"Live\" was recorded over the course of 6 months and 10,000 miles. It shines an intimate spotlight on a performer who is at once arresting and vulnerable - powerfully honest and honestly powerful.\n\nA 4-time Outmusic award nominee who was recently named in the inaugural Trans 100 list, Namoli was also the recipient of the Tucson Folk Festival Songwriting Award and a finalist in the ISC songwriting competition. Her 2010 release 'Black Crow' garnered critical acclaim and was named one of KXCI FM's top albums of the year, and her 2015 release 'Ditch Lilies' was nominated for the German Music Critics Award. Namoli's music has been featured on NPR, PBS and in films including the Emmy-award winning documentary \"Out in the Silence\", which details the struggle of a gay teen growing up in rural Pennsylvania. She spends 5 to 6 months a year on the road in the US and Europe.\n\n\"I am lost by design\", sings Alanna Eileen in The Mirror and the Mime. In this moment we already know the landscape here will be deep, its path winding. The musicality which is threaded through both of Eileen's two haunting EP's, Absenceand Keepsake, is layered like artful strokes of paint to canvas; pulsations of heart and sound reverberating between the vulnerable chest cavity and the floor. Hushed phantom tones of emotive swirl make tipsy the entry into Eileen's soundscape. Displaced, yet sure-footed, these are soft, mournful compositions of the in-between. One imagines a light step through dark space, a poet's heart clearing way through underbrush toward an unknown shore laid out against the thick fog of one's travels. Songwriting become equal parts processor of reality and repository for longing. There is an almost sacred element at work in Eileen's lyrics. \"The sky is more than I know how to see\". A painter's heart in awe of the everyday. \"It’s such a mysterious procedure\", says Alanna, \"there’s a touch of alchemy or magic to it. It feels like a gift, almost, because it can’t be planned. It’s like a storm brewing.\" Rain broke loose from the soul tarries along the edges of the unknown, and in that place these songs hesitate to name their maker. Yet \"something always remains,\" grafted onto the mystery is that place where the light and dark share their kindred stories long into the night, and in that night one can only but hope to pocket these tokens from the wayside, reminders, for later, of all that has been lost and all that has been found. The song - here - is a canvas of endless possibilities.\n\nIn a time when the narratives of the heart are becoming increasingly diluted, Taryn Laronge brings back to the table that spirited muse that is a songwriters calling, an internal grappling with the pain of the past and the myriad of ways in which that pain moves us forward. Honesty and self examination are at the forefront of Laronge's compositions, which sit comfortably in that rich tradition of confessional female songwriters that have helped to define, in this writers mind, what music can do almost better than any other language, repair, heal, and bind people together in ways that are hard to put your finger on. But the pulse is there. Taryn sings it the way she's lived it, you can hear it in her voice, how the story and the telling of it are embodiments both of dark and of light, one making room for the other. A songwriter must go deep against the odds that what they come out with may or may not be what they expected to find. In this sense it is all about the journey. Laronge is a traveler who, having taken those odds, leaves us with songs that are both compass and path. Their heart is big, their soul is strong, their love is pronounced and their hunger for more life is the high note that lingers long after the last note of Little Doorways is played. The album, after all, ends with Dear Life, in more ways than one.\n\nAthens, Georgia is the stuff of musical legend. A rich springboard for some of the very best bands and songwriters of our time. Pylon were and still are one such band. A weird, funky, fiery art rock ensemble fronted by the strong force of Vanessa Briscoe Hay, Pylon's sound got inside of your body, torqued your muscles and your mind. Now Vanessa is back with Pylon Reenactment Society and her presence is as captivating and spirited as ever. Vocally, you can hear the arch of a bands story, you can hear the span of a life. Loss and resurrection, it's all there, encoded in these songs. \"Creativity and ideas are things that just happen, and no one really knows where they come from,\" Vanessa says. \"I wouldn’t say that they are impossible to keep alive, because to me, they exist independently from our conscious selves. If you are open to these things and make a little time for them, there they are. If they are going to happen, they will, I really have no control over the creative process. As I get older, I see that it ebbs and flows.\" For now, it is flowing, and its heart, all these years later, is still intact, wildly beating, creating, and giving new voice in all of the right ways. Time marches on, and so do we, battle born, wiser, gentler and kicking still. An artist can only wait for the moment to hit, for the idea to take on skin and walk through fire to meet the sky. Pylon Reenactment Society's shine is writ large. A sky anthem of truth, clarity and utter roar.\n\nCaitlin Canty is an American singer/songwriter whose music carves a line through folk, blues, and country ballads. Her voice was called “casually devastating” by the San Francisco Chronicle and NPR Music describes her songs as having a “haunting urgency.”\n\n​Motel Bouquet, Canty’s third record, features ten original songs that hold her darkly radiant voice firmly in the spotlight. Produced by Grammy-nominated Noam Pikelny (Punch Brothers) and recorded live over three days in Nashville, the album boasts a band of some of finest musicians in roots music, including fiddler Stuart Duncan and vocalist Aoife O’Donovan. Rolling Stone hails Motel Bouquet as “dreamy and daring” with “poetic lyrics and haunting melodies.”\n\nSince the release of her critically-acclaimed Reckless Skyline in 2015, Canty has put thousands of miles on her songs, circling through the U.S. and Europe. She warmed up stages for The Milk Carton Kids and Gregory Alan Isakov and recorded with longtime collaborators Darlingside and with Down Like Silver, her duo with Peter Bradley Adams. She won the Troubadour songwriting competition at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, and her song, “Get Up,” was nominated for Song of the Year in the Folk Alliance International Music Awards. Canty’s original recordings have recently appeared on CBS’s Code Black and on the Netflix original series House of Cards.\n\n​\n\nRaised in small-town Vermont, the daughter of a school teacher and a house painter, Canty earned her degree in biology in the Berkshires and subsequently moved to New York City. She spent her days in the city working as an environmental sustainability consultant and her nights making music at Lower East Side music halls and bars. In 2009, she quit her job and set out to make music full time. In 2015, she packed up her house plants and her 1939 Recording King guitar and drove to Nashville, TN, which she now calls home.\n\nUkraine’s On The Wane are holding a sonic mirror up to the times. Conflict, brutality, hypocrisy, lies, remember when this was something music wrapped its bruised voice around? On The Wane's guitarist Eugene Voitov certainly does. \"Music is on the wane in our days, it isn’t the thing that can unite people around the world anymore,\" Voitov says. There is a raw and vital rage that crystallizes in the live wire sounds of Schism, the bands latest album. Much is done in the moment of the jam, piecing sounds together like a puzzle. A similar ethos to Throbbing Gristle's early experimentation of live, collaborative sonic soul searching. On The Wane, unlike their namesake, are most certainly not disappearing. A far cry from defeat, it's the loudest voice piecing the night in search for truth and a way out of the deadlock of a bankrupt culture. Beauty is ugliness walking the high wire between two worlds, the one that wants to forget and the one that wants to remember. On The Wane chooses the latter. The apocalypse may be in the rear view mirror, and like the saying goes, much closer than it appears. But while the world is still here, music that shreds its way into truth will always burn brightest. The point is to walk out of the shadows cast by such a light. To make music matter again, and, just maybe even the world.\n\nRisa Rubin creates poetic tapestries of lived-in musical landscapes, much like a scrapbook filled with all of those unspoken truths which must find voice lest the most authentic parts of ourselves go speechless, in a life far too long and important for silence. The roots here are planted in the shadows of familial soil but are assuredly growing trees of their own making in the second chapter of life that is Jewish Unicorn. An album of immense courage, scarring, beauty and humor. Rubin's unique compositions and the utterly original, haunting voice which delivers these indelible stories of confusion, insecurity, and finding our selves in the midst of so much life-flooding, is a testament to the power of art and its ability to, if not transform us, at least help us find the necessary tools to tell our stories, and on our own terms. Risa goes for the truth every time, even when it hurts, especially when it hurts.Jewish Unicorn is the voice that speaks after all of the flood waters have receded just enough to allow something else to come through.\n\n\"We all have aspects of smoke and aspects of sugar,\" writes Mari Quinn-Makwaia, but what comes from that in-between space is where all the possibility lies. Brooklyn based Funk Rock band Smoke and Sugar are reinventing the musical languages of community and artistic vitality. Against a backdrop of encroaching gentrification come the lively sounds of this impassioned five piece ensemble, adding to the spaces that they are in. \"As long as the so-called transplants are infusing the city with their life as much as they’re taking from it then there can still be dyanmic growth\" Mari says. As a native New Yorker Mari has seen first hand what has become of the city she grew up in; \"It’s hard not to think that we’re witnessing the most extreme version of gentrification when five years can result in unrecognizable neighborhoods and neighbors. I hope that chains, clubs and high rises don’t end up defining my city because that would feel like conformity and status-oriented hierarchy driving out all the city’s weird kinks that I grew up through.\" But this isn't a defeatist story, it is one of immense hope, light and groove. After all, Smoke and Sugar are the embodiment of life and celebration. \"To inspire people to dance - in their heads, their hearts and their bodies,\" Mari says, while holding the tensions and working through the difficulties, that is Smoke and that is Sugar. As any gardener knows, you have to prepare the soil for what comes next, Smoke and Sugar are planting the seeds, we each have to bring the water.\n\nSurviving a misdiagnosed illness which nearly killed her and more than a few of life's most difficult onslaughts, Jenn Vix puts full emphasis on creating from an intense need to survive. \"I could not emotionally handle listening to music for about a year,\" she says. Then, like a reprieve in the eye of the storm, a fateful encounter with John Ashton (Psychedelic Furs) at a live radio gig rekindled Vix's creative muscles; a fire, surely, had been nearly burning all along. \"I didn't think I had it in me.\" Jenn says. \"I pushed myself to do it; I didn't/don't want to give up. The title track, \"Unlocked,\" is about longing to be freed up from pain, fear, and loss, and oddly enough, I wrote it right before I got sick.\" Having come through the jagged edges of the impossible, Vix offers her take and advice on self care/boundaries, caution, keeping good friends/band-mates close, (never go into the trenches with someone you have to keep an eye on) and leaves us with one of life's most important reminders, no matter what path you're on; \"Please do not listen to anyone who tells you to give up.\"\n\n\"Which heart beat is yours and which one is mine,\" sings Beth Whitney on Tides Are For Sirens, such a question seems to endure the length of the album, where one begins and where one ends, how our lives and stories are tied into one another, how we survive, how we heal, how we go on when we are almost convinced we can't. The Wild Unrest is a very personal album with wide open arms, it pulls listeners in because we have all, in our own unique way, reached such low points, treacherous internal crossings where wild waters rushed against us, and yet we've all dared to cross, if we're lucky we survive what we think we cannot, we bear losses that cannot always be made whole. \"I'm in such a strange season that I find myself re-reading chapters of my life that I thought I'd known well,\" Beth says, \"we are all hurling through space trying to make sense of our experiences. I think a good song can unravel and weave a piece of the mystery in an edible way.\" This music has been deeply lived in and indicates that it is possible to emerge from even our darkest chapters, that our epilogue is survival, the internal and external, wild crossing. \"There is something to be said for sitting in the pain for its time,\" Whitney says, \"scrambling out of it before its ready doesn't seem to be working, and the pressure to convey positivity and joy every minute is not a good one.\" That an album might be something like a loved one who skips their meals to sit with you till the fever lifts, \"I hope it is like that somehow.\"\n\nPaula Boggs has worn more than a few hats in her lifetime, a musician and songwriter logging in a decade now as the front-woman for the Paula Boggs band, a lawyer, a former federal prosecutor, and an Army Airborne veteran. Up until this year, when she and other members decided to resign, she was also a longstanding member of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, originally appointed by President Obama. Boggs has spent a lifetime in service in various fields and capacities, but it is with music that one feels the soul speak through those life chapters. As Paula puts it: \"Music is our best shot at “hearing” each other.\" On the bands new album Elixir: The Soulgrass Sessions, the call to connection, action and human understanding is poignantly at work through each of the songs, and if ever there were a time when such music was necessary, it is now. \"Every day is a canvas\" and we must use our brush well, if the surface happens to be our world what would you want to see reflected back at you, truth, beauty, love, understanding? These are the themes threading through Boggs' vast musical book, the life chapters lead one to a present not just born of experience, but of a lot of hope too; \"I’ve now lived through enough freakout moments to know the sun will rise the next day,\" Paula says, adding: \"It’ll rise for you too.\"\n\nThere are voices that we all know, iconic cadences, and then there are vocal hauntings, sounds of a life that has gone up against the ropes. In an alternative universe where Marianne Faithful and Hope Sandoval are leads in The Highwaywomen, in our reality, Lo Carmen steps in with such raw musical authenticity we shake and shiver at the sounds pouring out of a spooked jukebox in a bar just off the highway. Sometimes dreamy and light, like heat hallucinations in the desert, sometimes disquieting, as even the darkest country songs are also frightful warning shots of a wrong turn ahead on the long road of life. \"I’ve learned that the harder something seems,\" says Carmen, the better the song you’ll probably get out of it. There’s a song in everything if you look hard enough.\" Lo's new album, Lovers Dreamers Fighters,which releases today, was recorded at Nashville's Welcome to 1979 and The Butcher Shoppe studios. Featuring a duet with Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy along with an impressive all-star line up of musicians, \"it was the perfect place to make this album,\" says Carmen, \"with the perfect people to bring it to life. I was just trying to keep the smile off my face at how every song was sounding exactly how I dreamed it would.\" Here Lo talks about the new album and her life in music which has taught her, perhaps most poignantly that \"there’s room for everyone in the world, no matter what it is you’re trying to bring into it.\" These songs, like the best of friends, \"will always lend an ear to what you have to say.\"\n\n\"We are all experiencing the same things, in completely different ways,\" says Kelly Mcfarling. \"I think revealing your own moment through your limited lens can reveal larger more expansive truths.\" Many of those truths on her latest record, Water Dog, are told as learning moments of time and experience, how the shaping of our own lives become informed by all that we go and hopefully come through intact. \"I struggle with letting go, of expectations, of my childhood, of what I should and shouldn’t be. I’m always trying to learn more about letting go gracefully, because I’m realizing that it is something that continues to be required,\" says Mcfarling. Growing, as Kelly points out, can be seismic and uncomfortable, but can also be hugely revelatory of inner transformations we've yet to encounter. Music often plugs directly into the parts of us that know what we know because we feel what we know, we wear it in our bodies, stories both told and untold, and if music is a language we all speak, it's also a language that we all share. We may have more in common than not, even if a million things stand in the way of acknowledging that. Songs are those bridges over troubled waters, and water is the stuff of life and the compass point of this record. \"I found a lot of inspiration from water. I chose the name water dog because I love to watch the reckless abandon and joy of dogs playing in the water. It became a totem for me during this time, and a reminder. I think diving into things is how we come to know the things we know, whether that's an outward or inward journey.\"\n\nFrom the opening shot of \"Time\" (Dir. Michael Hogan) Brenna Manzare crafts what feels and functions like a gorgeous musical short film about family, sense of place, the memories that accrue to the spaces we have passed through and perhaps left behind, how every encountered shape, sound and color of our lives informs us then and now, as if \"we're alive in two dimensions\" as Manzare sings. As if, in the taking, time also gives something back. It is a rich, multi-layered song, and where Manzare's strengths come to bear most are in her poetic approach to song structure, to lyricism and the depth, the utter aliveness of the picture being painted. Through a single track it feels as if a whole universe has been constructed. A photo album of memories lost and reclaimed. Although Manzare has yet to record a full length album, there can be no doubt, as \"Time\" itself is proof of, that when she does it will be an album to be reckoned with. After all, the most worthwhile labors, well, they take time. \"The most important lesson I’ve learned\" says Brenna, \"is that you have to surrender yourself to the unpredictability of creating.\" But, when it does come, the songs that it leaves us are proof that both the surrender and the waiting were well worth it.\n\nThe best truths are the one's closest to home, natural as the air we breathe, the story of our lives are local configurations of the human heart. On Something New, Ottawa Ontario singer-songwriter Ana Miura paints an intimate musical portrait of family, love, small towns and all those ties that bind us to ourselves. \"On a literal level,\" Ana writes, \"the record is about me finding someone new in my romantic life, but in a bigger way it’s about the changes and the dynamics of life and how we are always growing. As we pass through life we express each phase in our own unique way – Something New is my fingerprint from the last few years.\" Songs that resound with deep spirit and heart, markers of then and now and of all that is still to come, the life and beauty pouring through Something New is the work of an incredibly gifted songwriter whose narratives enrich our own lives, as the truths closest to home are also the ones that carry us the longest distance, both anchor and drift. Miura gives us something to lean on, learn from and, pointing us true north, in the unique way of songs that know 'where they are going and where they have been'.\n\nWith Going Gone, Foote's vocal and lyrical honesty collects its fallen objects along a darkening shore line, gems on the underside of that quiet hour of our experience, Silence, a song which stands out, in part due to how beautifully its instrumentality is constructed and in part; how the voice that sings it absolutely soars and sears, where we, listener and composer, are \"tall like an oak tree, it comes crashing down, bend till it broke me, till we broke ourselves down\" And \"though we fear the start of night it always comes around,\" the things we try to keep at bay have their own methods of finding us. A soulful and poetic album, each song comes brimming over with its struggles and its strength, quiet hour or bustling daybreak, the liminal space that makes a song spark with life lingers in our hearts and minds ever after. There are no magic tricks to making all of this happen, just sitting with yourself and writing it all out until something sticks and wont go away. Going Gone, here for an instant, fleeting and spectacular, if ever an album deserved a place in your home and in your heart, it is this one.\n\nInterview here\n\nBoston MA, songwriter Tory Silver approaches music much like a puzzle, the non traditional routes of composing, taking disparate chords and weaving them through the ether till the threads bloom into pattern, offer up ways of challenging song structure while perfectly balancing controlled chaos and melody. Silver's voice seems to be almost at one with her guitar, and the compelling mix of bossa nova, alternative rock, blues and jazz all commingle, diorama like, to dizzying effect, turned one way, hear a mountain, turned another the ocean. By approaching the guitar as if it were a canvas, each song has the integrity of something fought over, decisive musical brush strokes, shading blues and bossa nova reds, spontaneous but methodical. On Observere, the diversity and feel of something highly original comes into view, you may want to dance or wail or both, there are more than a few universes of sound tucked away in this painting of an album. Listen to it from the left, from the right, from the center, each time it feels slightly different. As Tory puts it \"a few simple chords can hit deep, and the feeling is almost instant.\" Observere is the kind of musical trip you'll want to take when surprise, soul and shifting color is the destination you desire most of all.\n\n\"A lot of the stories I’ve written about have to do with distance,\" says New York songwriter Gabrielle Marlena, whose new albumGood Music For You releases this Friday. The songs on this record grapple with \"leaving behind love\" and all of the strain a relationship takes on when two people are separated by continents, \"Today it’s so easy to live in the past through social media, so it’s harder to let go of things, and it inspires a lot of music in me.\" Rescue you, which comes from a piece of advice given to Marlena by her sister: \"No one’s going to rescue you\" is a uniquely memorable song with a classic, dreamy, Mazzy Star like quality, punctuated with twangy guitars and Gabrielle's soaring, soulful voice, \"I've forgotten how to put myself to sleep,\" the song becoming a meditation on self-love, independence, and perseverance. What does it mean to define ourselves apart from our partners, to come to our own aid in hours of crises, to find the answers, like a phone call, coming from within? Each time a song is reopened so too are the wounds of broken hearts and lost love, but in the moment when that first chord is struck and the voice amplifies and fills the room, when ears and hearts are open, healing, it seems, fills up the space between what happened and where one is now. Hearts always break again, but maybe they break differently, when we become the ones capable of rescuing ourselves. Good Music For You, is exactly that; cathartic, self aware and asking big questions. \"Communication,\" after all \"is so important, and it’s the only thing that will get you through.\"\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/self-expression-solves-everything-an-interview-with-gabrielle-marlena\n\nFrom the glittering dream laden hills of Los Angeles comes the lush, crepuscular sounds of LUCKYandLOVE (Loren Luck and April Love). Imagine a skate park at dusk with speakers high as walls, heavy, polyphonic sounds vibrating and rearranging the air like so many light particles splitting in two, Lucky + Love, pouring into your ears. A haunting and precise sound carving itself into your cognitive memory, music travelling like gypsies through the ether.\n\nThe real creative ingenuity of this duo is that they've found a way to build on the rich legacy of their predecessors (Cocteau Twins Depeche Mode), without simply repeating the past, these are new sounds glowing in the dark, twined around the warm, lush vocals of April Love.\n\nTheir music video, Digging in The Earth, has the kind of wild creative presentation that The Cramps would be proud of. B-movie aesthetics and camp, a nod to 90's era Gregg Araki, where ants carry a T.V. aloft like food, and, well, dance.\n\nThe spiritual presence of David Lynch and Siouxsie Sioux hover somewhere above the rich, mysterious musical world on display here. Which is to say unexpected moments of beauty and allure that are well worth the trip taken with this duo. Hop in the car, preferably at night, and listen to Lucky + Love, an album that takes you to the stars.\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/nobody-ever-said-this-was-easy-an-interview-with-april-love\n\nLast year indie-pop powerhouse Allo Darlin' announced the breakup of their band and would play their very last show in London that December. But for lead singer Elizabeth Morris this was but another chapter in an ongoing musical-life, conjoined elements that are hard to pry apart, since, as Elizabeth says, playing and writing music has informed every aspect of her life since she was a child. Coming of age in the 90's, when female singer-songwriters were on our air waves and our televisions in full force, for those who weren't there it can be hard to appreciate the ground breaking significance of that time, but for Morris it became the thing that gave voice to a life's calling, the empowered muses of song and expression that ignited an inextinguishable creative passion in her. \"I think if you want to do it,\" says Elizabeth, \"you will find a way.\" A great musical project's closing leads to other open doors, a new band, Elva, in her new home of Norway, with her husband Ola Innset, Jørgen Nordby and Diego Ivars is in the works. \"At this stage,\" Elizabeth says, \"it's lovely just enjoying playing music again and learning to play with new people. We're really relaxed and have these lovely rehearsals in our basement,\" proving that every closing chapter is but another one beginning.\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/elizabeth-morris-on-finding-a-way-to-do-what-you-love\n\nOn Sitting with Sounds and Listening for Ghosts, Sun Riah sews together an album that at times feels more like a book of poems. A quiet but pronounced meditation of grief and the painfully long process of making sense, if ever we can, of what has been lost. Stephenson explores the spaces of her Grandmothers house, rooms that, once so full of life, become engulfed in absence with her passing. The haunting power of this work is not just its universal applicability, but the recognition that where we come from, landscapes, houses, family, all of the many ties that bind us to our own identity, and what becomes of us once those threads come undone, constitutes the fabric, the language by which we know ourselves.\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/sun-riahs-haunting-meditations-of-loss-home-identity\n\n\"Writing\", says Canteri, \"(great, average or terrible) is therapy. It’s creation.\" The Australian singer-songwriter, who has released two solo albums, When We Were Young and Late At Night, in addition to three stellar records with the Alt. Country band The Stillsons, is currently at work on a new album with Jeff Lang. \"Sometimes I feel it’s hard to quantify just how much of my life and relationships revolve around music,\" Canteri says. \"Playing music definitely keeps you humble… one month you’re playing to an amazing huge crowd at a festival, next month you’ll be playing to one man and the bar tender.\" Canteri's songs bear incredible depth, range and eclecticism, an arresting array of bluesy folk, rock and roll, alt. country grit and tender introspection, songs that scratch beneath the surface and linger in your head long after you've heard them. After a decade in music I think it is safe to say that Cat Canteri has secured a unique and enduring place for herself in music. And to those on a similar path who are being swallowed by doubt, it's important to remember: \"Be compassionate to yourself. Be kind to yourself,\" and most importantly, \"Never give up. Never give in.\"\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/cat-canteri-on-human-connection-strength-in-numbers\n\nBelgium's Annabel Lee is a unique and lively garage pop, post punk band fronted by songwriter Audrey Marot. Their debut album Wallflowers was released this June on Luik Records and features an array of highly addictive songs such as Best Good Friend, (the original working name of the band) and the riot grrrl reminiscent track Period Sex. Audrey talks with AHC about the origins and current configuration of the band, sibling bonds forged through a shared love of music, and using daily life as inspiration.\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-annabel-lees-audrey-marot\n\nBrisbane, Australia singer-songwriter Angharad Drake on her latest album, Ghost, shooting for longevity through unabashed authenticity, side stepping the temporariness of fashion and sticking to your guns. \"If you want to be a musician you're already setting yourself up for a lot of failure. It's a tough business.\" The songs born of determination and honesty often are the strongest, most durable things. And if poetic authenticity is any measurement of success, then Drake's Ghost is certainly a hit from those higher planes where true art unravels, a place where we can \"listen and decide for ourselves what is good.\"\n\nCheck out the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-angharad-drake\n\nDorothea Tachler, lead singer of the Brooklyn based band My Favourite Things, currently set to release their new album, Fly I will, because I can this July, talks with AHC about her inspirations, musical instincts and why we should never assume things will last forever; leaving expectations at the door, and digging deep into the creative vision at hand.\n\nRead our exclusive interview with Dorothea Tachler here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-dorothea-tachler\n\nResistance is built of love, and where these dangerous times will take us depends on those who are carrying the light into the dark. Ruth Mundy takes up the call of her political-musical forebears, Woody Guthrie, Billy Bragg, Leonard Cohen, Joan Baez, to speak truth to power. The title of her debut album, Don't Be A Monster, says it all. Be decent, be good, be brave. \"It’s other people’s response to my songs which can save me,\" says Ruth, \"it reassures me that I’m doing something worthwhile, and also reminds me that other people are struggling with the same stuff and that we are all looking out for each other.\" Songwriters like Ruth Mundy are needed now more than ever. Every added perspective of compassion and resistance to the tapestry of our world is but the price of our humanity. Will we pay it forward, will we stay human, will we refuse to be monsters? It might be uncertain, but Mundy's songs wager that it's worth the risk to find out what we're made of; heart and spirit, or darkness and cruelty.\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-ruth-mundy\n\n\"What’s the focus point?\" asks Nadia Reid, \"Is it to get on a big stage and have attention? Or is it this insatiable urge to write and play, write and play? You have to start from the very bottom. And be patient.\" That patience and perseverance has paid off in the form of Reid's second album, Preservation, where experience from roads less traveled finds relief in returning home to the ones we love. \"I’ll never know what it's like on the other side of the songs that I write,\" says Reid, \"but for me, [it] is a huge healing process... There’s this place I have to tap into. Sometimes I get there and sometimes it feels impossible. I don’t know what it is. But when I’m there, I’m present and songs tend to flow, and it all feels right.\" An unstoppable inner strength pours through the songs of Preservation, asking \"How dark, how heavy?\" if it's true that music is an anchor, than Reid's is no exception, a tried and true, durable sound that echoes inside of us, familiar terrains come to new light.\n\nFull interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-nadia-reid\n\nTo know that what we do matters, that is both the challenge and the challenge's calling. With a sound almost woven out of the earth, Martha Reich sings from the brittle openings of the heart. To hear one must listen, beyond receiving; absorbing. Some music is better suited than others to work on such deep fronts, Reich's songs are certainly up to that task. \"When I listen and follow my heart,\" Martha says, \"I never go wrong or get lost.\" To take in the art that comes from such a place opens up our lives in ways that are impossible to measure but so important to hold onto. As Reich says; \"Don't give up what's in your heart to do.\" \"Sow more seeds,\" instead.\n\nFull interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-martha-reich\n\n\"I don't know if I have a God but my mother likes to think I have hers\" begins Jersey Devil, the debut solo album of Brennan, a member of the Boston MA punk rock band Dazey and The Scouts, here we find a decidedly different sound, a mix of lo fi, tape deck folk in the tradition of The Velvet Underground and Bill Callahan. Brennan's vocal styling has a very earnest lived-in quality which comes across in these songs as if there is almost no separation, which is to say that we believe not only the authenticity of this music but also the voice that carries it.\n\nCheck out the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-brennan-wedl\n\n\"Just cause I'm broke don't mean I need fixed\" Wolf sings in Kill No More, the opening track off her latest album Country Pop Hit. Lo brings to mind Gillian Welch with a sense of humor and irony, but no less sincere and heartbreaking, as evidenced in the somber closing number Gone Are the Days... \"of nothing left but the stain\". Poetry, grit and wit are all effortlessly woven throughout a record that feels equal parts timeless and modern. \"I think a true musical education requires you to face the parts of yourself that present struggles, darkness, misunderstanding, secrets—a lot like good lovers\" Lo says, when asked from whence inspiration comes, quite simply or not so simply; different lovers. Here Lo walks us through \"a house called Girl Island, misguided romances along the way, despair, time spent walking. busking and talking to people in the city\" while leaving us with the sound reminder that we don't get to choose what saves us.\n\nRead our interview with Lo Wolf here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-lo-wolf\n\n\"Being an independent artist is a constant hustle,\" says Lola Rhodes, \"and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’ve always loved being scrappy, paving my own path towards the things that I want.\" The L.A. based singer-songwriter is to be admired when it comes to building an audience, utilizing platforms like Periscope and Patreon, Rhodes is nose to the grindstone in almost every capacity and aspect of her creative career. And, by all indications, it's payed off. Her self titled debut, which is available via Bandcamp and other outlets, bears the mark not only of building something with your own hands, but of possessing an unbeatable determination and spirit. \"Music connects me to myself in ways I didn’t know that I needed to be healed\" says Rhodes, \"and it connects me to my listeners in the same ways.\"\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-lola-rhodes\n\nBrooklyn based singer-songwriter Lara Ewen on out-of-tune pianos, The Ramones, her latest album The Wishing Stone Songs, and how music is a lot like love; you need someone else in the room to make it real.\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-lara-ewen\n\nMelbourne singer-songwriter Anna Cordell says that when she picks up the guitar, it's a symbolic thing. Searching for the in-between moments, the sudden pauses and gaps in the flow of living, her music a type of sight leading one toward the hidden. \"The cracks in the walls are where the magic happens,\" Cordell writes. \"But they are hard to see sometimes- easy to bypass, easy to skirt over.\" Anna's last record, These Walls, which was met with much critical praise upon its release, is soon to be joined by another, no doubt equally praise worthy album this fall. Here Anna talks with AHC about her inspirations, fitting music into fashion and vice versa, making art for the right reasons and about all those who do what they do \"because they have to. Because it is human. \"\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-anna-cordell\n\nTo my mind there are two very distinct kinds of artists in the world: those who create because they can and those who create because they have to. Vancouver Singer-songwriter, poet and playwright Rodney DeCroo, without question, belongs to the latter. The work not only fits the life lived and the experiences undergone, but precisely because its creation is a matter of survival, the insights offered come to us in full form, no empty platitudes or easy answers. What one knows best is what one has been through, and the songs, the poems, the plays, like beacons in the night, open up paths for similar souls to follow. While we each walk our own, familiar stories and songs go a long way as our companions on those singular, treacherous roads that lie ahead. DeCroo describes music as a road map back to himself. \"How I survived those years\" Rodney says, \"is still a mystery to me. Songs express the mysteries of being human that go beyond my ability to talk about them. That's why we need them.\"\n\nRead our exclusive interview with Rodney DeCroo here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-rodney-decroo\n\nSalem, Oregon singer-songwriter Molly Kate, says that many (if not all) of her songs reflect her early environment in the Pacific Northwest, a deep sense of place that gets spun into the flow of folk stories that fill our ether, scrapbooks of personal experience; mountains, verdant forests and overcast coasts. \"I can’t remember a time when I didn’t feel music in my bones, in everything I do\" Kate says. \"I know that the songs I write now will become a capsule later on for this time in history. I think musicians, writers, and artists in general, are the documenters, the folklorists. If we write what we know, what we see, how the world is making us feel at this time, it solidifies something that’s often intangible.\" Here Molly talks to AHC about her musical inspirations, a new album slated for the summer and offers some heart warming advice to her younger self.\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-molly-kate\n\nAmy Duncan is a Scottish singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. She has recorded five albums: Pilgrimage (2006), Story of a Girl (2007), Potential-Space (2010), Cycles of Life (2013) Undercurrents (2016), which was released under her own label, Filly Records and her brand new album, Antidote.\n\n\"There is a sense of hope in Antidote,\" Amy writes, \"I was searching for a cure, a way of being, that could move beyond the depressive cycle. Knowing the past cannot be changed, it is ultimately about moving forward, with the intention to choose to live life in a positive way.\"\n\n​check out the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-amy-duncan\n\nSub Pop recording artist Jesca Hoop, on her new album, Memories Are Now, and the inspirational forces at work in her music.\n\n​Hoop's style has been characterized as largely experimental with folk, rock, and electronic influences. Her early mentor, Tom Waits, described it as, \"like a four-sided coin. She is an old soul, like a black pearl, a good witch or a red moon. Her music is like going swimming in a lake at night\".\n\nShe often finds that, \"I have an identity crisis every time I write a catalog of songs, I think: what is this music? Where does it fit?\". She explained her tendency to move between a number of styles as, \"I am impressed by the power of music and its ability to transform the vessel it enters. I am everyday affected by it. If I want to change my mood, I change my music\".\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-jesca-hoop\n\n\"You are in so much pain, I did not inflict it, I cannot take it away\" Stephanie Forryan sings in Helpless, a song that says so much in the simplest, most purest of ways. Forryan talks us through how letting the moment inspire us, creatively, bends its branches into our daily life as well, \"Let the way you feel right now inform and change the choices you make as you sing and play\" Stephanie writes, and \"as you get better at doing that with music you also get better at doing that in life.\"\n\nCheck out the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-stephanie-forryan\n\nFrom the rugged terrain of Northern Ireland comes a songwriter who, as The Irish Times puts it, is \"a bit of a wonder.\" Hannah McPhillimy, however, is solidly grounded when it comes to what she does, \"I still feel a fool explaining to people what it is that I do\" McPhillimy remarks, \"- surely, I sometimes ask myself, singing at unsuspecting punters can’t be viewed as a legitimate life direction?\" But ultimately it's what art lets loose into the world, something which would have been found lacking if not for our unique, singular contribution, that makes any creative calling incredibly worthwhile. As McPhillimy puts it, \"the buzz of bringing entirely new art to life, throwing it out to strangers across the world and finding, oddly enough, that it has found a place and a home with them is like no other I have known.\" A string of well crafted, thoughtful musical releases, the most recent of which is last years Wind Machine shows the mark of a songwriter who pens from deep within, it might be thought of as a given but not all musicians create from the depths, some play it safe on the surface, not so when it comes to McPhillimy. As she remarks to what this creative journey has taught her, main among many life lessons is that \"Not knowing where you’re going is not a good enough reason to stop going there.\" Adding, soberly, that \"life is opaque/uncertain/incomprehensible for everyone, you might as well make moves towards the things that make you feel most alive. Or if you can't do that, do the things that make for the funniest stories – that’s life lesson number two.\"\n\nCheck out the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-hannah-mcphillimy\n\nLast month saw the release of ​Little Thieves, Elli Perry's latest LP, which has been described as a story of renewal and rebirth, chronicling the journey of transformation and ultimately finding the strength necessary to start again. Perry's voice conveys the very real sense that it has been places, and each song on the record carries testimony to the sense of displacement, heartbreak, longing and scrappy resolve while also consoling the listener in those sweet spots that hide out along the way. Here Elli talks about the ways in which \"being more or less permanently transient teaches you a lot about gratitude and respect for the people and places that care for you, take you in, and allow you to keep moving on down the road,\" how she first started playing music professionally by age 12 and has never really looked back since, concluding that the secret, ultimately, is to just keep going, to make art that you believe in, that can hold you and others up.\n\nRead the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-elli-perry\n\nTo singer-songwriter Brad Sanzenbacher it's all about community. And not just in music, you find it all sorts of places, Brad says, \"I think anyone who goes to the same place every week and sees the same group of people is going to find themselves healing. Whether that’s an open mic night, a kickball league, or whatever, it’s the sense of community that heals.\" The journey, Sanzenbacher says, has been one of trying to do the best he can, keeping in mind that he's had to learn it all along the way. How we get to A and B doesn't matter as much as the images, the world building that comes through in a well painted song. Pulling all of the senses out of the musical kit bag, \"Honeysuckle. Lilac. Perfume. Nostalgic smells; a secret weapon in lyrics.\" Building diorama's that pull you in is a large part of what you aim for, Brad says, a good song has a lot of moving parts, and a songwriter, the ones who are paying attention, are constantly working to fit those pieces together.\n\nFull interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-brad-sanzenbacher\n\n\"Music has saved me countless times, and it really does feel spiritual to me in that sense,\" Barth says, adding, \"That it’s something that has never turned it’s back on me and shows up for me again and again and helps me through tough times.\" Growing up in a musical household, Barth's father, an opera singer, and her mother a choreographer, Lesley grew up on the sounds of Carole King, James Taylor, Carly Simon, influences one can hear on Barth's debut LP, Green Hearts. A soulful and equally introspective record that takes one back to the musical landscape of a different era of songwriters, the 1970's, when confessional female pop, soul and folk ruled the airwaves, Janis Ian, Joni Mitchell, of which Barth eloquently describes, after having first heard the song “Case of You,” \"It was almost like the song was a physical presence in the room – it really felt like there was life before that moment and then life after that moment.\" One gets the sense that this is the approach Barth uses in writing and composing her own songs, leaning into each one, fine tuning toward the essential, with strong, unforgettable tracks like The Falling, resulting in one of the most intelligent, evocative pop albums to appear in recent years. \"I fall squarely in the Dizzy Gillespie camp of “if it sounds good and it feels good, it is good.” I think things that tend to feel good to me are things that are a good mixture of clever, honest, and surprising. And when things feel good you just want to keep doing them.\" And we, the listeners, want to keep listening.\n\nFull Interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-lesley-barth\n\nMinneapolis singer-songwriter Jake Allan has a bare bones, straight-to-the-heart-of-matters, lived in quality to his voice and lyrics, after all, he says, it is simplicity and truth that make songs a bit more steady on their feet. \"Many people try to make things harder than they need to be. I’m certainly guilty of this too\" Allan says, adding \"don't get ahead of yourself and don't look back. Just be.\" Citing Steve Earle and Bob Dylan as abiding influences, one can also hear a bit of John Mellencamp breaking through, \"Just because you're alive doesn't mean you know who you are\" he sings on Wherever You Are, cutting away the lyrical fat and getting down to the bone of truth. On Somewhere to Somewhere and Everywhere in Between, Allan's latest record, we find a songwriter who has, as he puts it, \"set out to create sources of love, danger, and truth for the listener,\" while also sifting through what Jake calls a \"general unknowingness. Not knowing much about living, or being a son, or being a man, but trying to figure it out.\" When music asks these questions we can't help but pay attention, these are, after all, the kind of things we all find ourselves wondering and wanting to know about our own lives. How to be honest, true and better at all the things we continually have to learn along the way, never quite getting it right but aiming to come in as close as we can every time.\n\nFull interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-jake-allan\n\n\"I've got me to keep me down\" sings Lael Neale on Pale Light of the Sun, weaving slow, 60's era sounds throughout a record of poetically introspective, literary songs, Neale has an almost timeless quality to her voice, slightly reminiscent of Fairport Convention's Sandy Denny or Kate Wolf. Although it was a combination of Cat Stevens and Harold and Maude that first sparked her inspiration for songwriting. \"I wanted to tell stories in images made emotional through sound\" Neale says, of that defining moment when creative paths were revealed. \"Inspiration isn’t about magic, it’s about showing up\" she adds. Here Lael talks about the importance of maintaining a childlike enthusiasm, the early and initial sense of awe and wonderment, how to show up with all your attention, the difference between looking and seeing and staying open to the creative possibilities that might, at any moment, come pouring through.\n\nFull interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-lael-neale\n\nUK singer-songwriter Tracey Browne has spent over a decade crafting genuine, gutsy, heartfelt folk-rock songs. Having toured extensively with fellow UK recording artist Thea Gilmore, Browne is currently at work on a brand new album, Doctrine of Song, the first since 2012's 'Everyone Is Ordinary'. Here Tracey talks about how she got started, what and who inspires her and offers some grounded advice on the pitfalls and misconceptions of the music biz, \"No-one is better than the next person just because they’ve got a shiny poster and some quotes telling everyone they are ‘one to watch’.\" says Browne, \"I have been humbled by the fact that there are a million other singer songwriters out there, because we are putting something positive into the world by being honest enough to create and let it be seen.\" Cultivating community, putting both shoulders to the wheel and letting the songs land where they will, a humble, worthwhile and necessary calling.\n\nCheck out the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-tracey-browne\n\nMontreal-based singer/songwriter Roxanne Potvin says that one of the most valuable lessons she has learned about creativity (and life) is: what scares you is usually what means the most to you. And if what means the most is the music, Roxanne has faced that fear head on, resulting in an admirable and enduring body of work. Her latest album, For Dreaming, recorded after a five year break from music, is the well crafted result of all the years Potvin has spent cultivating and composing simplicity; only keeping what is necessary, the bare bones of emotion. As Bob Mersereau once wrote of Potvin, \"The beauty, well, that’s the sound of somebody who has learned how to make the sounds in her heart come alive.” \"I think the most significant thing being a songwriter has taught me\" Roxanne says, \"is how much of yourself is shown to you in the process.\" Here we get a small glimpse of what those things are.\n\nCheck out the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-roxanne-potvin\n\n\"Music,\" Duncan says, is \"a journey of continual discovery. There’s no linearity to what I do. And I love it for that reason.\" Last month saw the release of Doll's debut EP, Hurricane, written in an East Village apartment in NYC, a catalyst for the songs that came through on this record, \"it's where I lived when I was young with my family. I’d become very stuck in my surroundings at home in the UK and I think creating this EP saved me in a way,\" Duncan says, of finding her muses, and bringing them out, across the water. We caught up with Doll to talk about how she got started on this path, her earliest and fondest musical memories and her new EP, Hurricane.\n\nCheck out the full interview here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-doll-duncan\n\n\"No one gets anywhere with out the help of someone else\" writes Ali Holder, whether in the form of inspiration or actual help. \"I am not my art, we are separate things\" adds the Austin, TX singer-songwriter, of the many life lessons that she has learned along the way, including staying tough, being kind to yourself and others. Holder's sound has been described as equal parts outlaw country and Lilith Fair. Literary figures also loom large on her inspiration's horizon, the characters of Stephen King and the \"word herding\" of songwriter James McMurtry have all become central parts of her creative constellation. \"If I did not have a creative outlet, I am not sure how that would have manifested itself in me. Being able to get all the darkness out of my hands and out of my mouth is truly life saving,\" Holder says of the healing, reparative power of music. And if you find yourself beginning to doubt the value of whatever it is that you do in this life time, learn to \"let the universe surprise you\" Holder offers, \"over do it, under do it,\" but most of all just do it. Jump in, stay true to yourself, and live a life that makes you want to sing inside.\n\nRead our interview with Ali here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-ali-holder\n\n\"It starts with a single note\" Beckwitt says, \"to change a person’s life, influence one’s soul.\" Everything that made us must be brought out into the open, transformed through song, poetry, art, \"we end up creating the things that we needed in our darker times.\" In her song “One More,” Elisabeth sings about her struggles with addiction, now, five years clean, Beckwitt says \"it will always be a part of my life, but all I can hope is that through talking about it and through music I can help anyone who might also be struggling, and continue to heal myself.\" Having come through a great many things, Beckwitt has found that by creating with the difficulties of our past often we touch the lives of others, giving them something to hear and hold onto in their own dark times.\n\nRead our interview with Elisabeth here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-elisabeth-beckwitt\n\n\"In the 12 years she has toured the world with Lake Street Dive, Bridget Kearney has fine-tuned many things: adjusting to jet lag, sleeping in moving vehicles, hauling her acoustic bass up and down stairs, keeping her cool in front of cameras, thousands of people and personal heroes. But the skill she has honed most obsessively is songwriting. “For me it's the best part of music,” says Kearney. “That's the best feeling: after those few hours that you spend working on the song, and you have this thing that you've made, and you’re like, ‘Wow. This didn’t exist before. I’m so excited about what just happened.’\" Now, at long last, Kearney steps into the spotlight with her first solo effort, the wry, big-hearted pop album, Won’t Let You Down. The record, like its title, promises not to disappoint.\"\n\nRead our interview with Bridget here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-bridget-kearney\n\nAustin, TX singer-songwriter Nichole Wagner, whose new ep, Plotting the Constellations dropped in January, writes that \"Music, at the end of the day, is a service.\" And as to the mysterious how of it all, when it comes to songwriting \"every once in a while something falls from the sky and you’re in the right spot to catch it…and it just feels “right” — or it says whatever it is you’re trying to say in the way you needed to hear it.\" Nichole talks with AHC about the important role that music has played for her throughout her life and says that her biggest hope, at the end of the day, is that others find joy or solace out of what she's created.\n\nRead our interview with Nichole here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-nichole-wagner\n\nBerry Robertson describes Permafrost as \"an emotional or mental state of being where you feel very frozen, very numb, very unsure, very scared and very stuck.\" Also an apt description for growing up, the young, self taught singer-songwriter finds in music a place to process her life, cope and share stories that are deeply rooted in her day to day. \"It's something that I need to do not just something I enjoy doing or feel like I want to do. Music is all about connection to me.\"\n\nRead our interview with Berry here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-berry-robertson\n\nHomes/Lives, by Harri Endersby, is an electronic folk album of incredible beauty, the sound of the spheres aligning in our modern moment. Here Harri talks about the influence of a sense of place on her work, the North East of England, where, as she puts it \"some scenes and memories are just so beautiful that they need to be sung about.\" Homes/Lives is a musical photo album of those landscapes, and through the artist's eyes we see the world a little wider and more achingly beautiful than before.\n\nRead our interview with Harri here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-harri-endersby\n\nChthonic is a rare album, a living metaphor. In the deep thematics of the underworld, Julia Lucille carves out a landscape of struggle and rebirth, a phoenix rising from the ashes, building a home of its own in a world that may be none too welcoming. Transformations need no permission to occur, they are born, either way, in mid flight or crash, and it is the unspoken in each of us that emerges when our psychic, physical ropes fray. In putting this album together, Julia admirably strove to highlight feminine aspects instrumentally \"rejecting guitar parts and tones that sounded too aggressive or masculine in favor of balance and subtlety.\" Here emerges the evolution of a \"passive girl becoming queen of the underworld,\" of \"going really deep down into the darkest places emotionally and then coming back up,\" edges shimmering. In a time where our collective dreaming seems to be on decline, Chthonic sparks out into the manufactured darkness, piercing the veil and letting in much needed light.\n\nRead our interview with Julia here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-julia-lucille\n\nSarah White became involved with the growing music community in Charlottesville and played in several bands towards the end of the 90's (White Trash Cookin', Pat Nixon, Miracle Penny). At the time the record label Jagjaguwar was based out of Charlottesville (before moving to Indiana to merge with Secretly Canadian) and released her first solo album in 1997, a collection of lo-fi four-track recordings made over a 3-year period dubbed All My Skies Are Blue.\n\nIn 2000, she released her second album, also on Jagjaguwar, entitled Bluebird which was more melodic and was recorded in a studio. The record garnered her a wide range of positive reviews and comparisons to artists like Cat Power and Edith Frost. Later that year she recorded and self-released Pickin' Strummin' And Singin'... The Versatile Sarah White which was a collection of early country standards and traditional songs.\n\nOf her record Bluebird, The San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote: “A delicately bare and pretty album that ensures the singer-songwriter a place in the company of Cat Power’s Chan Marshall and Edith Frost. Yep, that good.” And Dave Matthews has written “Sarah’s music kills me, beautifully from the ground up, no plastic.”\n\nRead our interview with Sarah here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-sarah-white\n\nWith a hint of Gillian Welch but stylings completely her own, Vera van Heeringen plumbs the depths of Americana music with deftly versatile, instrumental skill and a sharp eye on the shifting landscapes and stories of humanity in the 21st century. Others have written, \"It’s unusual to find someone who’s as good a songwriter as an instrumentalist, who brings the guitar to life in a way that is entirely her own. She’s subsequently been compared to people like John Martyn and Richard Thompson. Vera has an open, charming onstage presence that belies her outstanding flat-picking, and the ability to tug at your dancing shoes with a well-chosen rollicking fiddle tune or reduce you to tears with a poignant lyric, making for a great gig that will linger long in the memory.\"\n\nRead our interview with Vera here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-vera-van-heeringen\n\nGabrielle Louise is a nationally touring troubadour noted for her poignant lyrics and lush voice. The daughter of two vagabond musicians, Gabrielle inherited the predisposition to wanderlust and song. Gabrielle Louise's music is anchored deeply in folk and Americana, but undeniably drawn to rich harmonies and melodic adventurism. Her sound has the earthy feel of early Joni Mitchell while also veering into the spirited and versatile delivery of fellow genre-hopping artist Eva Cassidy. Unafraid to take a musical escapade in the name of inspiration, Gabrielle is at one moment folkie and ethereal, the next a smoky jazz chanteuse. Known for her authenticity and candor on stage, Gabrielle's performances are notably present and sincere, a professional presentation of her private creative world. Her story-telling and banter envelopes and enchants, gently enticing her listener to release their grip on the status quo. Perhaps because of this quality, Louise has been entrusted to share the stage with greats such as Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, Patty Larkin, Eliza Gilkyson, and Guy Clark.\n\nRead our interview with Gabrielle here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-gabrielle-louise\n\n\"Inspiration can come and go like the wind.\" Sarah Loucks writes. \"There are times when songwriting feels so fluid that I don’t even feel like I’m a part of it.\" Sarah carefully carves worlds you can feel out of a landscape you can recognize; the human heart and experience. There is a precision and a wandering to these songs, and if music is the journey, the destination is always two steps ahead of us, \"the wind instead of the tree\" or both at once, shiver when touched and as we hear these sonic chapters unfold, crinkled turnings of the life-page. In her own words \"Writing has always been been my guiding light, the nagging feeling in the pit of my stomach and the relief like light rain after a storm. As much as my songs can be serious, I find most things funny and ultimately, I try to rule my life from a place of happiness. I practice thankfulness and I believe that love is the only place I want to live within.\"\n\nRead our interview with Sarah here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-sarah-loucks\n\nFiddler, singer, and stepdancer April Verch knows how relevant an old tune can be. She was raised surrounded by living, breathing roots music—her father’s country band rehearsing; the lively music at church and at community dances; the tunes she rocked out to win fiddle competitions. She thought every little girl learned to stepdance at the age of three and fiddle at the age of six. She knew nothing else and decided early on that she wanted to be a professional musician. While Verch is perhaps best known for playing traditional fiddle styles from her native Ottawa Valley, Canada, her performances extend into old-time American and Appalachian styles and far beyond, for a well-rounded tour-de-force of North Americana sounds. Even as she plays with the tradition she inherited, Verch keeps the community-fired celebratory side of her music at the forefront, honing a keen awareness of how to engage contemporary listeners. And Verch never forgets the roots of her music, that connection to the people out there in the audience, on the dance floor, to the community sparked by a good song. “It’s about joining together to celebrate everyday life, through music. We’re all in this together.”\n\nRead our interview with April here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-april-verch\n\nLaura Cantrell is a country music artist based in New York City. Born in Nashville, TN, she came to New York to attend Columbia College, and found that her abiding interest in country music helped her stay connected with her family roots. That interest was the motivation behind her long-running radio program on WFMU in Jersey City, NJ, “The Radio Thrift Shop.” Beginning on WFMU in 1993, the program was a Saturday afternoon staple in the New York area for 13 years, then moved to WFMU.org and ran for two seasons on BBC Radio Scotland as a summer replacement in 2005 and 2006. In her ten-year recording career, Cantrell has released three acclaimed albums: “Not The Tremblin’ Kind,” “When The Roses Bloom Again,” and “Humming By The Flowered Vine.” She has toured extensively in the United Kingdom, Europe and Ireland, and was a favorite of pioneering British disc jockey John Peel, who called her 2000 album “Not The Tremblin’ Kind” “my favorite record of the last ten years, possibly my life.” Cantrell recorded several Peel sessions for the BBC from 2000-2004 and appeared on the first Peel Day program on Radio One commemorating the first anniversary of Peel’s death. Cantrell’s music has been celebrated in the press including features in The New York Times, “O” Magazine, Elle, and the Wall Street Journal. Cantrell’s music has been featured on NPR’s “All Things Considered,” “On Point,” and “Weekend Edition.” She has performed on “A Prairie Home Companion,” “Mountain Stage,” and the “Grand Ole Opry,” and appeared on the television programs “Late Night with Conan O’Brien,” and the Sundance Channel’s “Spectacle: Elvis Costello. Last spring, Cantrell released Kitty Wells Dresses: Songs Of The Queen of Country Music, a recording she made in honor of one of her heroines, the great Kitty Wells. A meditation on femininity in country music, the set takes its title from an original song written in tribute to Wells. At present, Cantrell is at work on her fourth album of original material.\n\nRead our interview with Laura here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-laura-cantrell\n\nAriana Brophy is the songwriting equivalent of mulled wine; sweet, nostalgic, perfectly paired with a rainy evening and a fireplace. With vocal clarity that would suggest she has been singing a lifetime, she writes songs that weave heartbreak, love, hope and loss onto a canvas of stylized fingerpicking and expert harmony. She crafts her songs with a tuned eye for storyline and a remarkable ear for the moments a heart witnesses before the mind. She is adept at playing to the imagery around her and exploring what it means to genuinely feel. Her first EP ‘Ink And Water’ was nominated for an Edmonton Music Award in 2016, and her second EP ‘Sweet Things’ was released Sept 2016.

She grew up in a quiet Northern California mountain town, where she started her musical journey at an early age. She began learning to play the piano when she was only 4 years old, discovering the fundamentals of music and creativity that would eventually lead her to Los Angeles, Nashville, San Francisco and many places in between. But it wasn't until she was 15 that she really found inspiration in the voices of Janis Ian, The Beatles, Patsy Cline, Tom Waits and her grandfather's old records. From then on, she began living her life as a singer-songwriter, performing her music at venues all across the country and eventually landing in Southern California and making it her home. Besides being a new voice for her generation, the kind that uses her art to share her pure and simple truth, she also heads up community events to support various non-profit organizations and invests herself into arts programs all over Los Angeles.\n\nRead our interview with Jaden here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-jaden-larue\n\nEmily Jane White is an American singer and songwriter from Oakland, (CA), who has released five solo albums and toured internationally.\n\nOn 2 November 2007, White released her first album, Dark Undercoat, through Double Negative Records. It was released on Talitres in Europe and as a vinyl LP in 2008 by Saint Rose Records. It included the song \"Wild Tigers I Have Known\", the title track of the Cam Archer film of the same name.

A passionate performer, she effortlessly melds fiery fiddle playing, electrifying vocals and a fresh interpretation of new and classic songs with an “Ameri-Chicana” attitude. Her newest project, the upcoming Spanish/English album “Lola,” is both a return to her musical roots and something of a departure where she delivers her own twangy, Texas-bred twist on Mexican Ranchera songs, creating culturally blended music for a culturally blended world.\n\nInspired by the 1940’s-era recordings of Carrie’s great aunt, Chicana singing sensation Eva Garza, the album is a mixture of new and old songs. It features Spanish songs written by some of Carrie’s favorite Mexican composers, as well as her own Ranchera-inspired original songs written in English, Spanish and “Spanglish.”\n\nCarrie, an Austin native, began playing violin at age five. Her training quickly became the passion and focus of her childhood, and by age 10, she had performed as part of a group at Carnegie Hall. She continued the classical track in her first year at Oberlin Conservatory, then shifted gears to pursue her true love affair with the fiddle—staying true to her Texas roots—at the Berklee College of Music.\n\nEarly in her career, a collaboration with singer-songwriter Chip Taylor resulted in four highly acclaimed duet albums. Her subsequent solo albums highlight the diversity of her musical identity, from her debut “Seven Angels on a Bicycle” to 2013’s “Give Me All You Got,” which reached no. 1 on the Americana Music Charts.\n\nCarrie has toured, recorded and co-written songs with legendary artists such as Lucinda Williams, John Prine, Bill Frisell, Rickie Lee Jones, Mary Gauthier, Los Lobos, Alejandro Escovedo and Los Lonely Boys, among others. She has made numerous television and radio appearances, including Austin City Limits, The Tonight Show and A Prairie Home Companion. She has been profiled in many publications, including Rolling Stone, The New York Times, The Times of London, The New Yorker, the Washington Post and many more.\n\n“She’s the trifecta for me – beautiful singer, soulful songwriter, and kick-ass fiddler.” —author Brené Brown\n\nRead our interview with Carrie here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-carrie-rodriguez\n\nShlomo Franklin grew up on a farm milking cows in Bethel, New York.

In Leading Lady we hear \"Nothing in my pocket and nothing to gain, work hard at your woman's work and you'll be promised fame, it ain't the same\", a gutsy sound that harkens back to the Odetta era of folk & blues. Think Fairport Convention, think boot stomping, Lead bellly, Kelly Joe Phelps, think good music, done as only Sophie Rae can, shooting from the hip with soul, swerve and some serious guitar chops. Wise to the ways of the world and ready to shout it out, quite simply, this is the blues.\n\nRead our interview with Sophie here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-sophie-rae\n\nFrom New Jersey, John Gorka is a world-renowned singer-songwriter who got his start at a neighborhood coffeehouse in eastern Pennsylvania. Though small, Godfrey Daniels was and is one of the oldest and most venerable music institutions and has long been a hangout for music lovers and aspiring musicians. In the late 1970’s, John was was one of these aspiring musicians. Although his academic coursework at Moravian College lay in Philosophy and History, music began to offer paramount enticements. Soon he found himself living in the club’s basement and acting as resident MC and sound man, encountering legendary folk troubadours like Canadian singer-songwriter Stan Rogers, Eric Andersen, Tom Paxton and Claudia Schmidt. Their brand of folk-inspired acoustic music inspired him, and before long he was performing his own songs – mostly as an opener for visiting acts. Soon he started traveling to New York City, where Jack Hardy’s legendary Fast Folk circle (a breeding ground for many a major singer-songwriter) became a powerful source of education and encouragement. Folk meccas like Texas’ Kerrville Folk Festival (where he won the New Folk Award in 1984) and Boston followed, and his stunningly soulful baritone voice and original songwriting began turning heads. Those who had at one time inspired him – Suzanne Vega, Bill Morrissey, Nanci Griffith, Christine Lavin, Shawn Colvin – had become his peers.\n\nIn 1987, the young Minnesota-based Red House Records caught wind of John’s talents and released his first album, I Know, to popular and critical acclaim. With unusual drive and focus, John hit the ground running and, when an offer came from Windham Hill’s Will Ackerman in 1989, he signed with that label’s imprint, High Street Records. He proceeded to record five albums with High Street over the next seven years: Land of the Bottom Line, Jack’s Crows, Temporary Road, Out of the Valley and Between Five and Seven. His albums and his touring (over 150 nights a year at times) brought new accolades for his craft. His rich multifaceted songs full of depth, beauty and emotion gained increasing attention from critics and audiences across the country, as well as in Europe where his tours led him through Italy, Belgium, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, Switzerland and Germany. He also started sharing tours with many notable friends—Nanci Griffith and Mary Chapin Carpenter among them. All this brought his music to an ever-widening audience. His video for the single “When She Kisses Me” found a long-term rotation on VH-1’s “Current Country,” as well as on CMT and the Nashville Network.\n\nIn 1998, after five successful recordings and seven years at Windham Hill/High Street, John felt the need for a change and decided to return to his musical roots at Red House Records. The choice was driven, in part, by the artistic integrity that the label represents in an industry where the business of music too often takes precedence. The 1998 release After Yesterday marked a decidedly different attitude towards making music for John, and his next release The Company You Keep held fast to his tradition of fine songwriting, yet moved forward down new avenues. Its fourteen songs displays John’s creative use of lyrics and attention to detail. Andy Stochansky played drums and shared production credits with John and Rob Genadek. Ani DiFranco, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Lucy Kaplansky and Patty Larkin contributed stellar guitar work and vocals to this fan favorite. Old Futures Gone was informed by his life as husband and father of two young children and also contained the colorful experience of many hard years on the road. Writing in the Margins followed in 2006 and was an engaging collection of sweet and serious songs that spanned many musical genres—folk, pop, country and soul—and featured guest vocalists Nanci Griffith, Lucy Kaplansky and Alice Peacock. Now with this, his 11th studio album, he returns to his roots with So Dark You See, his most compelling and traditional album to date.\n\nIn addition to his 11 critically acclaimed albums, John released a collector’s edition box featuring a hi-definition DVD and companion CD called The Gypsy Life. Windham Hill also released a collection of John’s greatest hits from the label called Pure John Gorka. In 2010, he also released an album with his friends and Red House label-mates Lucy Kaplansky and Eliza Gilkyson under the name Red Horse. Getting high praise from critics and fans alike, it landed on the Billboard Folk Charts and was one of the most played albums on folk radio.\n\nMany well known artists have recorded and/or performed John Gorka songs, including Mary Chapin Carpenter, Nanci Griffith, Mary Black and Maura O’Connell. John has graced the stage of Austin City Limits, Mountain Stage, etown and has appeared on CNN. His new song “Where No Monuments Stand” is featured in the upcoming documentary Every War Has Two Losers, about activist and Oregon Poet Laureate William Stafford (1914-1993).\n\nJohn Gorka lives in Minnesota and when not on the road, he enjoys spending time with his wife and children. He continues to tour, playing festivals, theaters and clubs all over North America and Europe.\n\n​Read our interview with John here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-john-gorka\n\nYou may know her as the front woman of rock ‘n’ roll band, The Furrs, but Cohen has recently emerged with two striking singles, ‘I Don’t Feel So Alive’, and ‘Sever The Walls’, off her self-produced 10 track album, “Full Closure And No Details”, set to be released early 2016.

The dye was cast young. Some argue that she still communicates better with music than with conversation. She grew up in Melbourne, Australia, the youngest of three kids. Her Dad was a music teacher, her Mum a literature and history teacher. The house reverberated with music of some kind constantly. There were instruments and books on every surface. And the backyard was littered with Aussie rules footies, cricket bats and tennis racquets. Ball sports and art. It was a good way to grow up.\n\nAt thirteen Liz won a music scholarship to an elite private girls school. She spent a few years there, making the most of the grand pianos and the sports facilities. It was a supportive, but rigid, environment. It was against school rules for students to eat in their uniform when not on school grounds. What the actual fuck. At fifteen she started playing guitar. At sixteen she went to Germany, started a band and recorded her first demo with those boys. Onto cassette. She’s declined to divulge the name of that band. Too embarrassing, she reckons. She cut her performing teeth in Germany. And learned how to drink beer and smoke cigarettes. Everyone smoked back then.\n\nShe returned to Melbourne, went to her local high school, and began to write more and more songs. Tripping on acid in her mates’ shed, drinking cold beers on hot summers days in the park next to her school. The guitar went everywhere with her.\n\nAfter she finished high school she went back to Germany, picked up the band where they’d left it, borrowed a black Fender Stratocaster and a Bassman amp, secured a rehearsal studio in a World War II bunker and rehearsed religiously over the next three years. They played a few gigs. And had a lot of fun.\n\nThen she went to England. To follow love, and obtain enough work to sustain her continuing life in Europe. She learned how to barkeep, she wrote more and more songs, played some solo shows and began to focus on the acoustic guitar again.\n\n2003 she was back in Melbourne. And by 2006 had made her first album, “Soon” with her best mate, drummer Adam May. Ten years later it’s 2016 and she’s released four subsequent albums and is about to release her 5th studio record. She recorded it in Portland, Oregon. She wanted adventure again. She needed it. And she also fell in love. With Canada. So she started to plant roots and now she has a record deal and a bunch of beautiful friends there. She also gets back to her mob in Germany as often as she can.\n\n​She’s toured around Australia perpetually for years. She’s played every major festival. She’s revered by her musical peers for her inherent musical talent and low tolerance for bullshit. She neither has, nor wants, industry attention and validation. She’s a musician. It’s pretty simple, really.\n\nRead our inteview with Liz here heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-liz-stringer\n\nFrom the opening track Summer of Feathers off of Jessie Winslow's Bare EP, we hear this whispery question tug at our sleeves, \"Can you feel the fire in our hearts?\" As fingers snap like a bodily percussion throughout the earthy and soft introduction of an over-too-soon solid artistic canvas, Winslow opens a small window onto a musical landscape we can only hope will continue to unfold its magic further on down the road, with the next batch of whispery sounds sure to leave us as enchanted & curious as do the songs of Bare.\n\nRead our interview with Jessie here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-jessie-winslow\n\nKate O'Callaghan is that rare bird that manages to combine evocative melodies with intelligent considered lyrics, covering a gamut of emotions from the sublime to the cathartic and blending together to create a totally original sound.\n\nDistinctive in both writing style and beautiful vocal delivery, Kate draws reference from a very diverse range of sources, from historical figures and local heroes to nature and her surroundings in a skewed, refracted version of folk that is haunting, poignant and uplifting. Her aspect is very much her own, and in arranging songs she explores the less obvious paths tonally as much as the expected.\n\nA singer/songwriter and musician based in Co. Donegal, Ireland, Kate has collaborated with various artists/groups, including Boston based roots collective Session Americana, singer/songwriters Finbarr Doherty (Irl), Jennifer Kimball (US), The Henry Girls (Irl), Duke Special (N.Irl), Mark Black (Irl) and the Inishowen Gospel Choir (Irl).\n\nKate has also toured and/or opened shows for several acts incl.

This has never changed.\n\n​Since then, Caitlin has lived in many countries around the world and travelled to many more, always with her guitar in tow and journal at her side. She’s written hundreds of songs, many lost in the wind and others scribble down. Her live performances have been saved for inspired moments of spontaneity; she has performed at open mics locally and abroad, bars in Colima, Mexico, and one special performance opening for Riders on the Storm (aka The Doors) at Casa de la Cultura in Ecuador. That is another story in itself.\n\nCaitlin was always encouraged to record her music and to pursue her passion, yet there was always something holding her back – Fear.\n\n​In 2015, a medical condition forced her to face this fear because another lay in its wake. Fear of failure, fear of success or simply fear of being heard; it no longer mattered and all of a sudden seemed trivial. She knew it was now or never as her voice might never be the same.\n\nAnd so this EP: Wasting Days came to be. This five song collection remains authentic, organic, and vulnerable. Caitlin considers herself a girl of the world and one with many tastes, so wanting to remain true to herself, Caitlin decided not be typecast into a particular genre. It is her voice that is the constant throughout her music and what bridges the genres: Pop, soul, boot-stomping (as she likes to call it) reggae and folk. These songs are just a taste of what Caitlin has to offer.\n\nRead our interview with Caitlin here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-caitlin-purvis\n\nSinger-Songwriter, Chloe Kat Wandering-Wonderer, Los Angeles, CA, then to Nashville, TN,\n\nthen to everywhere.

A trailblazing independent artist, Lisa was the first musician to have a number 1 single while not signed to a recording contract. She followed that remarkable feat with the hit singles, \"Do You Sleep,\" \"I Do\" and \"Let's Forget about It” and the albums Cake and Pie, The Way it Really Is, and No Fairy Tale.\n\nA native of Dallas, Loeb earned a degree in comparative literature from Brown University, where she experienced her first taste of real musical success with the duo Liz and Lisa (with Elizabeth Mitchell of Ida). The pair built a substantial following on campus and often booked shows in New York on the weekends. Fellow singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik also played in the band during Loeb’s final year of college.\n\nWhen Loeb moved to New York City after graduation, she continued to develop her vision, this time as a solo artist, and hone her artistic talents while carefully managing the business side of her career. This led to Reality Bites and “Stay” in 1994, and the rest, as they say, is history. The fact that “Stay” became a number one single in 1994 and still resonates with people today is a testament to Loeb’s gift as a songwriter and storyteller.\n\nRead our interview with Lisa here: heroinchic.weebly.com/blog/interview-with-singer-songwriter-lisa-loeb\n\n​\n\nJennifer Kimball is a musician known for her unusual choice of notes, her passion for dissonance and her willingness to create harmony where none has been envisioned before. She began songwriting in earnest in 1995 after leaving her first band, the critically acclaimed duo, The Story. Her first solo record, Veering from the Wave, was released on Imaginary Road/PolyGram in 1998.\n\nA force in the local music scene, Kimball is a slow and steady songwriter and frequent collaborator and contributor to other people's projects and/or shows. In addition, she is responsible for the holiday-ish music collaboration called Wintery Songs in Eleventy Part Harmony which celebrates it's seventh annual tour in 2016.\n\nThe release of her new record Avocet is a particular joy as it’s beginning came as a surprise birthday recording session at Q Division in Somerville, MA. Four tunes were recorded that day; two of them are included on Avocet. Kimball chose one of her surprise bandmates, the saxophone player Alec Spiegelman to finish the record. And the result of their collaboration is a splendid sonic experience; a record shimmering with elegant instrumentation arranged and produced by Spiegelman.
