        "text": "Music has a unique ability to connect you with artists you have never met who are writing songs about experiences or feelings similar to your own. It can allow you to escape from your low feelings, or unhealthy situations and become closer with people in your life. For me, music in all different forms has helped me overcome my mental health struggles throughout my entire life. I don’t remember a time when music wasn’t what I turned to during my low points.\n\nBeing stuck in a very toxic home environment during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 and not being able to be with the people who helped me escape from this environment previously, was extremely difficult for me. Most days, I wouldn’t get out of bed, I would barely eat, and I didn’t have enough energy to do something as simple as responding to the messages from the people closest to me.\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, I discovered Phoebe Bridgers after coming across the song “Scott Street” from Bridgers’ first album Stranger in the Alps, and I was immediately hooked. I began listening to everything she had ever released and felt truly understood for the first time in my life. Bridgers has a way with her lyrics and production that makes you feel comforted and understood, and that is exactly what I needed during this time in my life; it felt as though I had found something to save me from this dark hole I was in.\n\nThere was one time it really felt like she was saving me in some way. My family went camping with our trailer for a couple of days, being so close in proximity to them for this long was truly my worst nightmare. All I did for those couple of days was sit in the trailer alone or walk around the campground with my headphones on listening to Stranger in the Alps, specifically the songs “Demi Moore,” “Killer,” “Smoke Signals,” “Scott Street” and “Georgia.” These songs are all that got me through those couple of days, had I not discovered Bridgers’ music the week prior, I’m not sure I would have been able to cope even in the slightest. The experience and connection I have had with Bridgers’ music is unlike anything I have ever experienced, but there are still some other artists and bands who have been able to get me through hard times.\n\nConcerts are some of the best cures for me when I’m at my lowest. I had the opportunity to see Bridgers in June of 2022 at the RBC Echo Beach venue in Toronto. That day changed my life. The anticipation that builds in the days leading up to the event, watching the countdown get smaller and smaller and feeling like you’re in a dream sitting on the GO train and standing in line outside of the venue; these are all things before the show even begins that makes you forget about your struggles. It felt like the world stopped for a second when I saw her walk onto the stage for the first time. Seeing your favourite artist in that space is an out-of-world feeling. Being able to feel the music and Bridgers’ voice through my body made my connection to her music even stronger. There is just truly no happier feeling than seeing your favourite artist right in front of you, singing the songs you have been listening to and connecting with for so long. For those couple of hours, I felt like nothing else mattered and I was the happiest I had ever been.\n\nI was also lucky enough to see Boygenius, a band that Bridgers is a part of along with Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, at the Budweiser Stage in Toronto in June of 2023 with my girlfriend. They were touring for their most recent album The Record, which happened to come out the same day my girlfriend and I met for the first time. As sad as most of the songs on that album are, we really bonded through listening to it. Getting to see Boygenius live with my girlfriend was so special, and it made us both so happy to be able to experience music so personal and close to us, live.\n\nThese shows made me feel like all my problems had gone away for a small period of time and that was exactly what I needed in those moments. Concerts are a great way to cope with mental health struggles and it’s also very helpful to have something so exciting to look forward to.\n\nMore recently, Radiohead has been a band I turn to when I’m struggling with my mental health. The distinct production of songs like “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi,” “Just,” “Jigsaw Falling Into Place,” “Exit Music (For A Film),” “Climbing Up the Walls” and “Spectre” encapsulate the low feelings I have. I’m able to connect with the music on a whole new level, focusing less on lyrics as the sound itself somehow makes me feel understood.\n\nAs much as these depressing songs have helped me, there are times when I just need music to cheer me up and not to relate to. Tyler, the Creator is an artist whom I can always turn to when I need to switch my mood. I get excited every time I listen to any of his music because of how fun and experimental it is. His music allows me to escape from depressing feelings, and for a little while, I get to forget about all of my problems and just enjoy how good his music makes me feel.\n\nAnother musical outlet that has helped me when I am struggling with my mental health is playing guitar. Since I feel so connected to a lot of the songs I listen to, it is often very beneficial for me to learn these songs and be able to play them on the guitar. Playing music releases so many more emotions and allows me to connect even further with songs that hit me so deeply. I find distractions to be very helpful when struggling with my mental health and playing guitar is a great one. Choosing a song and putting all of my attention into learning it has been an incredible tool to help me at my lowest points; it allows me to close off from the world and feel like it is all that matters for a few moments.\n\nPlaying guitar has also brought me much closer with my uncle which has been very important to me since I don’t have a very good relationship with most of my family members. Being able to have that relationship with him through playing guitar has made a lot of the mental struggles I face surrounding the lack of relationship with my family a little bit better, and when you’re feeling that low, a little goes a long way. The feeling of finally mastering a song that I’ve been practicing for a while can also improve my mood so much. Knowing that I’m capable of accomplishing something can mean so much to me when I’m not doing well mentally.\n\nMusic is one of the most important aspects of my life and without it, I would not be able to cope with any of my struggles. It is always there to bring me out of darkness and it is comforting to know that it will always be there. While music is such a helpful resource when struggling with mental health, it is still incredibly important to engage in professional help and use any resources around you to help you get there. The impact that artists like Phoebe Bridgers, Radiohead and Tyler the Creator have had on my mental health is greater than words can explain and I will forever be grateful that I have music as my support through hard times.\n\nIf you're struggling with your mental health, you can find helpful resources on this City of Toronto page. You can also find Toronto Metropolitan University specific resources here.\n\nThe art of rebound relationships in music\n\nBy Melanie Nava Urribarri\n\nEarworms, not to be mistaken for earwigs–who have a poor reputation from the old European myth where these creatures burrow into the ears of sleeping people and lay eggs in their brains–can be perhaps one of every day’s greatest nuisances. Though they aren’t literal creatures, these tunes can certainly feel like wiggling, persistent worms that won’t go away, making a home in your head and adding yet another voice to block out.\n\nLuckily, there are ways to fix this problem. Like finding a good rebound to get over that pesky ex, here are some Canadian earworm remedies that will have you swooning for another song in no time.\n\nThe Classic\n\nHow many times have you had that song on replay? Have your family and friends already begun to give you the stink eye? Oh, what’s that? You just can’t get it out of your head? Well, have you tried the musical version of “Have you turned it on and off again” by simply playing a different song on repeat? This classic solution can be more effective than you think if you play your cards right. For example, if you’re stuck in 2012 with an infamous Canadian earworm like “Call Me Maybe” by Carly Rae Jepsen, there’s no need to change decades for the right counterattack. Stay in the year of the theorized apocalypse with Grimes’ promotional single “Oblivion”. A much more difficult Canadian song to hit the notes to, perfect for erasing numbers.\n\nChange your environment\n\nJust as being in a room for too long can suck away your energy and creativity, sometimes, the problem might not be you at all but your surroundings. How can you get over Avril Lavigne’s song “Girlfriend” if you’re stuck in the angry energy of your bedroom with all the memories of them? Get out and have some fun! Maybe go to your kitchen and treat yourself to something sweet with Nelly Furtado’s “Maneater”. Change your looping song from desiring to being desired and cure that earworm by switching locations and moods.\n\nChew\n\nStuck on 2010s Canadian heartthrobs like Justin Bieber or Shawn Mendes? According to the UK Counselling Directory, chewing gum or eating can create a new sensory experience, diverting your attention and possibly helping with a bad earworm. Instead of looping “As Long As You Love Me” with your young, hopeless romantic heart or “Treat You Better” –an earworm that peaked on the Billboard charts in 2016 and became a lovesick anthem–try eating the worm away like you might eat ice cream after a bad breakup.\n\nRead a Book\n\nYes, reminiscing on the “best days of [your] life” with Canadian singer Bryan Adams and his recorded song “Summer of ‘69” can be all you need on a dreary day, but what happens when you simply can’t stop? Choosing a new distraction that requires new concentration can be just the way to do it.f you still want to do some nostalgic reflecting, maybe you can pick up Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery’s Anne of Green Gables for a heartwarming, coming-of-age other than your own.\n\nMake a Playlist\n\nPlay games with your brain and battle the earworm with a combination move called “the playlist.” Much like simply playing a new song for your brain to catch, this strategic tip gives your mind something new to set its sights on– or many new somethings. Feel new adrenaline and satisfaction with a good playlist, such as one created by The Guardian with 30 of Toronto rapper Drake’s best songs.\n\nEmbrace it\n\nPeople are wired to look for patterns. Our brain likes consistent stimulation, and as stated by Harvard Medical School, some songs are created with specific musical intervals and tempos that are just more appealing to us subconsciously. Earworms can be harmless, and, sometimes it’s really not that serious. So if you can, embrace your earworm! Listen to that song on a loop and dance the annoyed glares away. The artists receiving a rush of streams on their songs might just thank you.\n\nFebruary is here, meaning that the clock is ticking when it comes to planning a romantic hangout with your partner for Valentine’s Day. Although going to the movies or eating a three-course meal at a bougie restaurant seems like the way to go, there is more in store for couples that want to add music to this special occasion. From pairs that want to keep it casual to love birds that want to enjoy an epic night out, the list below has several music-centred ideas to help you find the perfect way to celebrate.\n\nGo Record Shopping\n\nIf there is one place that music lovers can’t help but swing by from time to time, it’s a record store. There is something about roaming through the aisles filled with albums from a variety of genres that is appealing to any music enthusiast. In the case you and your significant other share the same desire to purchase vinyl or CDs, what better way to enjoy Valentine’s Day than shopping together? Maybe once you get past the cashier, you can give each other a record as a gift.\n\nSee a musical at a local theatre\n\nMusicals aren’t for everybody, since they often have more singing and dancing than wordy dialogues. Yet, for those couples that do enjoy a dramatic story accompanied by upbeat tunes, attending a musical production at a local theatre is a must. You’ll laugh at the occasional jokes, hold hands when the characters fall in love, and will surely have a new repertoire to sing together after the curtains close.\n\nAttend a Candlelight concert\n\nYou have probably seen ads promoting a Candlelight concert on your Instagram feed, but never actually purchased a ticket to experience one in person. Well, Valentine’s Day seems like an ideal occasion to give it a try. After all, there is nothing more romantic than being in a dimly lit room next to your soulmate, listening to orchestral versions of your favourite songs.\n\nEnjoy a meal to the sound of a curated playlist\n\nWith so many people making reservations in advance to eat out, enjoying a meal together at home might be a cozy way to go. To make the night even more intimate, come up with a playlist filled with tunes that you both enjoy—or remind you of each other—and listen to it while having dinner. Once a ballad begins to play, you can always seize the opportunity to slow dance with your partner in the living room.\n\nSing at a karaoke bar\n\nListening to music 24/7 means you probably know several songs by heart and sing them in the shower. Why not get out of your comfort zone and belt out the lyrics with your significant other at a karaoke bar? The whole point of karaoke is to have fun and let go of the pressure of sounding good to a picky crowd. Putting your names on the list and hitting the stage will make the night nothing short of exciting!\n\nWatch an artist or band perform live\n\nIf an artist or band that you and your partner love is planning a concert on Valentine’s Day (or maybe during that week), then purchasing a ticket to see them live should be a given. Yet, in the case that they aren’t performing in your hometown anytime soon, why not see a local band or a cover group instead. They might not seem as exciting as the person on your concert bucket list, but you might leave their show with a new local talent to add to your playlist afterward.\n\nNo matter the date idea you and your boo settle on, the truth is that music has the power to make a special occasion even more significant. After all, songs can evoke emotions and remind us of a moment in our lives better than words can. When the right tune plays at the right time, magic happens and a simple get-together with the person that you love becomes an everlasting memory.\n\nMusic is inseparable from memory, so you better hope it’s good music you’re listening to!\n\nBy Sam Santos\n\nHuman memory works in strange ways, none more intriguing than how music can impact it. There are certain moments in our lives that we attach to a song, even if insignificant or seemingly mundane.\n\nAs I write this intro while waiting for my international literature lecture to start, a girl I don’t know got up and played Ghost by Justin Bieber on the piano, much to everyone’s surprise. I’m not the biggest “Belieber,“ but I know the next time I hear the song I’ll remember this particular moment.\n\nMusic has the power to transcend time and space. It manifests itself in our memory, sometimes subconsciously. For me personally, there are certain moments in my life that are inseparable from a particular song or artist.\n\nImagine a collection of songs you despise greatly. Now imagine listening to them on repeat during the course of a 10-hour shift at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), a fair that takes place over 18 days in August and September every year in Toronto, in the sweltering heat of August. Unfortunately, I don’t have to imagine!.\n\nI ran a carnival game by myself with no coworkers nearby, so taking in the sights and sounds was the majority of the job. There were rare positives in this regard, like when an Amy Winehouse tribute concert was held within earshot. Most of the time though, I was subject to a loop of the same songs over and over. I don’t remember all of them, but here are some notable examples.\n\nGirls Like You (feat. Cardi B) by Maroon 5\n\nSome people like it when a Maroon 5 song includes a random rap verse for help on the Billboard charts. I am not one of those people. I thought I didn’t like Cardi B before, but after hearing this track on repeat, that disdain has grown to heights I didn’t think were possible.\n\nI Gotta Feeling by Black Eyed Peas\n\nI admit I am biased enough to give this song a pass. One of my earliest memories of music is dancing to I Gotta Feeling at my friend’s 4th birthday party in 2010. No complaints here.\n\nbad guy by Billie Eilish\n\nEilish’s vocal technique is very unique and I happen to really enjoy some of her stuff. When it comes to bad guy, something about the xylophone-like refrain throughout the song just makes me want to fill my ears with cement.\n\nCha Cha Slide by Mr. C The Slide Man\n\nThis is another musical memory within a musical memory, because most Ontario Gen-Z kids will recall hearing this song at some point in their journey through the public school system.\n\nHowever, by no means do I ever want to listen to it on repeat again, no matter how sweet it was to hear as a kid. Hearing this song upwards of 10 times a day was truly akin to being waterboarded with Kool-Aid.\n\nCold Heart - PNAU Remix by Elton John, Dua Lipa, PNAU\n\nI will not stand for this crude bastardization of Rocketman... enough said.\n\nBaby Shark by Pinkfong\n\nThe most egregious inclusion on this list by a wide margin has to be this children’s hit. There are very few songs that could even dream of competing with the repetitive abhorrence of Baby Shark. The fact that it was even included in the playlist boggles my mind.\n\nI have much more positive memories of songs that I listened to willingly. The Morning by The Weeknd, from his 2011 mixtape House Of Balloons, has an ironically misleading title. The dark synths and cold lyrics are more reminiscent of a drunken Friday night bleeding into Saturday, certainly not anything bright or cheery. At some point during the summer of 2022 though, I began listening to The Morning to start my day.\n\nI’m not sure if someone put the idea in my head or not, but that was my wake-up soundtrack for quite a while. That song, and by extension, the entire mixtape, contains themes of heavy partying, self-destruction and regret. I think that in addition to those main themes, it symbolizes the breaking down of walls and having to confront reality eventually. Something about the brutal honesty of that has always been appealing to me.\n\nI bought a House Of Balloons vinyl from Sonic Boom Records on Spadina Avenue that same summer. It was the only copy in the bin and I felt like I had just won the lottery. The two friends who were with me that day didn’t quite grasp the magnitude of me randomly finding that record, but it was one of the highlights of my summer. That day was extremely hot, into the high 30s, and we explored the dimly-lit malls of Chinatown to escape the heat.\n\nRecord collecting is an expensive but rewarding hobby. Not only do you get to physically own music you love, but you get to tell the stories associated with acquiring that music.\n\nThe folks at Sonic Boom Records were kind enough to let me take some pictures in the store for the thumbnail of this story. While I was there, I found a signed copy of Kendrick Lamar’s Untitled Unmastered. Turns out, even writing about musical memories can lead to making more of them.\n\nThe last memory I want to share also relates to the CNE (and Kendrick Lamar), but thankfully is more positive than the previous story. Before the fair itself, my job interview took place at the Exhibition grounds. I was, admittedly, quite nervous.\n\nThe interview went well and I was hired on the spot. I remember walking away with a silent fist pump before popping in my AirPods and shuffling my playlist. No More Parties In LA by Kanye\n\nWest and Kendrick Lamar was the song that came up first. An unconventional celebratory song? Absolutely. But sometimes unconventional is exactly what you’re in the mood for.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, you can’t avoid some less-favourable songs from seeping into your mental hard drive every once in a while. I’m thankful for that, though. It makes the good musical memories all the more enjoyable.\n\nFrom K-pop to Russian music, musical discovery provides more opportunities than I could’ve ever imagined.\n\nBy Candice Zhang\n\nI remember being in grade six, playing a computer game called “Audition.” It was a dance game, where you had to use your computer’s arrow keys to perform dance moves. Although I enjoyed seeing the different dances, I enjoyed something more from the game: The ability to listen to different types of music, with some of the songs being from indie artists.\n\nI was talking to an online friend in the game, and I asked them if they had a favourite artist.\n\n“I like K-pop,” they replied.\n\nThis was at a time when the Hallyu Wave was perhaps just beginning to gain momentum. I never realized it, but artists and bands such as Girls’ Generation (SNSD), Wonder Girls, 2NE1, and Big Bang were becoming household names. I had heard their songs, but I'd never dove into the music.\n\nThen, one day, I sat in a classroom and asked my friend who happened to sit beside me, “Do you know the song that goes like, ‘I love my boy?’” and I started singing some lyrics from a song entitled “Diva.”\n\nThey looked at me with a blank stare. “Yes,” they replied.\n\n“It was such a weird song; I don’t get why you would sing about you loving your boyfriend,” I said, voicing my opinion.\n\n“No, it’s a nice song,” they said, “It’s by a K-pop band named After School.”\n\nThere was that word again – K-pop, the word that I heard from so many places. But this time, I wanted to know what it meant. So, I asked my classmate, “What is K-pop?”\n\nThey looked at me with the most confused expression ever. “Well, it’s just Korean music. It’s pop in Korean, and there are so many bands debuting right now,” they explained.\n\nAfter further discussion, I decided to research more Korean bands and songs. I ended up admiring the genre to a certain extent, and I felt the need to teach myself the Korean language. I wanted to learn more about the culture, and music allowed me to explore the potential of discovering new languages.\n\nBut little did I know that another genre would interest me more.\n\nAfter a rough year of elementary school, my parents decided to transfer me to a different school. I was now in grade seven, starting fresh as a new student. I was at a new school, in a new place, in a classroom I barely recognized, sitting with classmates I barely knew.\n\nI befriended another girl who was also new to the school. She then befriended two other girls from another class.\n\nDuring a haunted house event, one of the other girls and I got to know each other. Then she told me, “My favourite type of music is K-pop.”\n\nThere was the word again. I now knew some facts about K-pop, so I decided to ask her more questions about it. She told me about some of her favourite bands were F(x), SHINee, and MBLAQ.\n\nFrom that day on, we sat together, listened to a few songs and even sang them out loud at school. But afterwards, times became rougher than I expected.\n\nMy pre-teen and teenage years were definitely tough, but I found my own solace through music. Music helped me discover a new world, and critically think about the various aspects of different countries. I thought about the cultural representation behind the songs, and the slang. Why were words phrased a certain way? What were some cultural hints within the songs? Was it through the rhythm, or through the allusions? Thinking about all of this helped me endure a rough period of time when I was exploring my own identity and questioning who I was.\n\nI wondered if K-pop was the type of music I truly enjoyed. While listening to the songs, I felt that there was something missing from the genre. This is not to say that the genre is terrible, but it just wasn’t to my taste. I do appreciate the time and effort spent on the lyrics, rhythm, and choreography, but I wanted to explore more.\n\nWhile I was questioning this, my friendship with my former friend who had introduced me to K-pop abruptly ended. I then constantly wondered if I could find a friend who I could truly resonate with.\n\nThen I remembered something: a library trip I took with my mom in grade five, when I borrowed a book about Russia. I found myself fascinated with Russian culture. And while researching the culture, I thought to myself: If there is Korean music, shouldn’t there be Russian music as well?\n\nAfter an initial Google search forRussian artists, I felt that I resonated deeply with the music and the lyrics. I first started off by listening to a few punk rock songs, then I moved on to Russian pop and hip-hop.\n\nThese songs soon filled up my playlists, and I introduced them to my friends and relatives in different countries. I became super invested in Russian popular culture to the point where I decided to teach myself to read Russian. I went online, Googled, and began my language-learning journey. I wanted to understand what the artists were saying, and the main themes of the songs. But in order to do so, I needed to understand Russian.\n\nAlthough I could read it at this time, the language still was very daunting. I didn’t know where to start, but I knew that if I wanted to truly understand the songs, I needed to begin immediately. So there I was, on some random website, learning a few Russian words and phrases. I would come home every day from school and spend some time learning the language. And although my classmates taunted me for learning a new language, I felt extremely motivated to understand the lyrics. My motivation and love for music helped me endure these hard times, as they provided me with a sense of belonging.\n\nMy hobby and interest in Russian music then turned into a habit: I constantly scheduled an hour a day to learn Russian. The effort paid off, and by the end of the school year, I was comfortable with speaking Russian at a conversational level. As a result, I felt more confident with myself, and no longer felt that I needed to conform to other people’s music tastes.\n\nWhile discovering new music, I noticed that I became more open to learning about new cultures and languages. Music seems to open a whole entire new universe, as every language has its own unique messages and symbolism showcased throughout its music.\n\nNowadays, whenever I attempt to learn a new language, I try to connect myself with music in that specific language. For example, in high school, when I took grade 12 French, I would constantly listen to French songs in order to improve my comprehension.\n\nNow, I not only listen to Russian music, but songs in Ukrainian, German, Kazakh and Mandarin as well. These songs allowed me to connect with different cultures, learn new words, and explore more of the world without having to travel.\n\nWhen I was going through a rough time, music was the medium that cured my negative thoughts and soothed my sad emotions. It allowed me to develop into a stronger individual who strives to look for opportunities, even with challenges.\n\nAnd although no K-pop songs are on my playlist as of right now, I owe it to the genre for allowing me to explore more about the music of the world. Music is the concept that provided me with unique opportunities, taught me the importance of taking initiative, and helped me discover more about my own personality and characteristics.\n\nThe languages that I gained, the knowledge that I now know, and my love for adventure and culture are all due to music, and for that, I can’t thank that art form enough.\n\nWith Spotify wrapped, making waves once again, and exposing the most vulnerable for their fascinating taste in music, the masthead decided to do them a favour and compile our favourite songs. Who cares if your top artist of 2023 was “Brown Noise,” tell your friends you listened to these Canadian hits instead. Here are our top picks for our favourite Canadian songs this year.\n\nAnna-Giselle Funes-Eng, Multimedia Editor\n\n“I’d Have to Think About It” by Leith Ross\n\nI love Leith Ross with all my heart! I got to see them play live in June and they are majestic. I love how romantically dramatic this song is. I listen to it whenever I feel like screaming in a soft indie-folk way.\n\nCaelan Monkman, Managing Editor\n\n“Gigafire” by Half Moon Run\n\nHalf Moon Run is a band that continuously impresses me. The Montreal trio is consistently reinventing itself, with their latest album, Salt, being no exception. While the album is full of solid tracks from start to finish, “Gigafire” is a personal favourite of mine. The deep growls of the electric guitar paired with a lush arrangement of strings and piano make for a truly cathartic listening experience, not to mention frontman Devon Portielje’s stellar vocal performance on the song.\n\nTalia Saley, Food Editor\n\n“Sk8er Boi” by Avril Lavigne\n\nI grew up listening to Avril Lavigne and she has been an iconic Canadian artist in my life. Whenever I hear her songs on the radio, or in public, I’m transported back to my childhood. It makes me feel rebellious whenever it listen to her!\n\nVanessa Tiberio, Social Media Manager\n\n“Fever Pitch” by Hotel Mira\n\nThis song is by Vancouver-based Indie-rock band Hotel Mira, one of my favourite bands for the past six or so years. “Fever Pitch” catapults listeners into the sunny embrace of summer vibes with upbeat melodies and a strong, boppy chorus. I can’t help but nod my head along to the beat of this song while a smile inevitably forms across my face when I listen to it.\n\nMariana Schuetze, Editor In Chief\n\n“Edge of the Earth” by The Beaches\n\nOne of my top songs from this year is “Edge of the Earth” by The Beaches. In 2023 I started working at TMU’s radio station, Met Radio, so I’ve been slowly getting introduced to a variety of new songs. The Beaches’ latest album, Blame My Ex, has been charting on Met Radio’s charts for a bit now, so I came across their songs a couple of times. Ever since I listened to “Edge of the Earth,” it hasn’t really come out of my mind. It’s a really fun song, I really like the beats and their vocals on this song, really makes me want to get up and dance.\n\nGrace Henkel, Arts Editor\n\n“A Case of You” by Joni Mitchell\n\nI love it because the lyrics and guitar strumming are so raw. Joni’s vocals tell a painful and beautiful story that feels timeless. I have so much nostalgia attached to that song.\n\nJohn Vo, Managing Editor\n\n“Say it Right” by Nelly Furtado\n\nIn the plethora of proclaimed quintessential“pop princess” albums, Nelly Furtado’s Loose remains a classic on 2000s playlists and in any trashy club wanting to appeal to the masses. For me, “Say It Right” is the perfect representation of the album: sensual, confident and catchy as heck.\n\nKhushy Vashisht, Features Editor\n\n\"i wanna be your right hand\" by Nemahsis\n\nThis has been my favourite Canadian song of the year because of the imagery it sets and how it perfectly captures feelings of turmoil, inferiority and determination fuelled by said turmoil.\n\nSarah Grishpul, Film Editor\n\n“You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” by Bachman-Turner Overdrive\n\nThis song brings me back to memories of my dad and my weekly driving trips. We would blast “You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” on the radio along with several other classic hits from the '70s, '80s, and '90s. During these trips, we'd often break out in rhythmic headbanging and off-pitch singing while tearing down the road to the public library. Since moving away from home and adopting a public transit commuter lifestyle, those small memories of carpool karaoke feel utterly nostalgic.\n\nTara Khoo, Social Media & Graphics Director\n\n“Music Box” by Leith Ross\n\nI saw them live this year and it was the most beautiful experience ever. I love listening to this song after a long day.\n\nSena Law, Fashion Editor\n\n“glo up +” by dci. and damn drone\n\nFeatured briefly in Spotify’s Rap Caviar playlist, “Glo Up +” is featured on Different Dimensions 1.5, a summer collaborative project by Toronto artist damn drone and dci. from Montreal. This energetic track features dynamic vocals over an enchanting instrumental, taking influences from genres of hip-hop, pop and plug-n-b. The two artists compliment each other in their vocal deliveries and range, giving us this summer (and frankly, year-round) bop.\n\nKhadijah Ghauri, Graphic Design Manager\n\n“Virginia Beach” by Drake\n\nThis is my favourite song because I’m a huge fan of Drake, and he’s truly my Canadian legend!\n\nNalyn Tindall, Music Editor\n\n“In Too Deep” by Sum 41\n\nWhenever I feel the need to dive back into childhood nostalgia, this song does the trick. The raw intro instantly transports me to the back of my parent's 2005 Ford Focus, driving to elementary school and listening to the local radio station playing rock hits from “the 80s, 90s and now.” To me, Sum 41 is the epitome of early 2000s Canadian rock. I can turn on this hit any time throughout the year to gain an instant burst of energy. From the epic guitar riffs to the catchy chorus, this song will always be a masterpiece in my books.\n\nWhat was your top Canadian song of 2023? If you’re having trouble deciding, listen to the playlist of our favourite Canadian songs here on Spotify.\n\nHave you experienced the epic highs and lows of concert etiquette yet?\n\nBy Vihaan Bhatnagar\n\nIt’s November 2024. You’ve never been to a concert before, but when Taylor Swift announced that she was going to be performing in Toronto, you knew that you had to go. I know what you’re thinking: How do I know what I’m supposed to do and what I’m not? There are thousands of people here, how do I avoid being that one person that they all go home and sneer about?\n\nWell, fear not my dear Swiftie. Because you can find everything you need right here. Here’s a list of everything that you should definitely do. These tips are going to help you beyond the Eras Tour, and you should keep them close for the rest of your life (or at least your 40s, which will probably be the last time you go to a concert).\n\nRecord the entire thing\n\nI think the big question here is; why wouldn't you record the entire concert on your phone? Do you really think people don’t watch the videos of concerts they take? It’s the same way with baseball games and fireworks. Lord knows I always watch every video of these events at least 500 times before I inevitably forget and it falls down into the never-ending abyss that some call the cloud to be forgotten forever.\n\nMake sure to hold your phone as high as you can and for as long as you can. Sure, your arm may hurt after a while. Sure, it might block the view of everyone behind you. But what’s truly important is to have physical proof so you can tell your 150 followers on Instagram that you spent $2000 on a ticket instead of paying half your rent, and then proceeded to be on your phone and watch it through a relatively tiny screen the entire time.\n\nWhoever said “live in the moment” obviously never used an iPhone.\n\nSing along as loud as you can\n\nNot just loud enough that only you can hear it and so it feels like you and Taylor have transcended all physical boundaries and become one with each other. Sing so loud that by the time you’re out of the venue, your throat hurts and your diet for the next few days needs to be of warm oatmeal and honey tea.\n\nYou don’t need to have sold millions of records, or even a singular record, to be allowed to screech at the top of your lungs and drown out the $13 million AV system at Rogers Centre.\n\nYou’re not just there to just watch and listen to the concert. The concert is there to listen to you. Each person who paid the price, however overpriced Ticketmaster may have made it, knew what they were getting into when they went into credit card debt.\n\nDance like your life depends on it\n\nBecause someday, it might. Remember not to wear elbow pads so everyone around you can feel the sting of your dancing. It needs to be clear that you’re the biggest and baddest fan there, and if you have to step on a few toes and break a couple of noses, well, that’s just the price of greatness, isn’t it?\n\nI mean, it’s basically physical proof for them to remember the one true legend that they were in the presence of, who danced like there was no tomorrow.\n\nPush everyone around looking for a better spot\n\nIt’s very possible and likely even that you’re going to end up in a spot that just isn’t the best. If that happens, you’re well within your rights to push and fight so you can find a better spot, even if it takes half the concert.\n\nIt shouldn’t matter that you’re making everyone uncomfortable and their experience unpleasant. You must fight everyone in attendance in a battle royale so you can find a spot that is going to end up never living up to your expectations.\n\nThrow stuff at the stage\n\nTry your best to bring objects just to throw at the performer so they remember you. Stuff like t-shirts, bras, leis, a pigeon, or your grandma’s ashes.\n\nEarlier this year, P!nk was given an enormous wheel of cheese at a concert, followed by a fan’s mother’s ashes. She was clearly delighted by the cheese, less so by the ashes. But it’s the thought that counts. It might be different for every performer, but that’s a risk you’ll have to take. If you really want to commit, you can tailor your gift to the artist, and you could even spend between 12-20 hours creating a replica of Taylor Swift’s dress from The Eras Tour movie and throw it at her if you can get close enough to the stage. You never know; some people might appreciate having something chucked at them at point-blank range by a random person.\n\nWhy would anyone not want to get stuff thrown at them and be given random things that mean nothing to them? It’s not like they would want to just sing and have fun. Why would they want to just be doing their job of entertaining in peace?\n\nThere’s an entire list of things acceptable to throw on stage somewhere. I can’t remember where, but I’m sure it includes roses, phones, your wallet, hotel keys, a frisbee, a ship in a bottle, a wax statue of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and the Declaration of Independence.\n\nAll of these tips will be so helpful to you for your first concert ever, and for all the shows you attend after, for the rest of your life. These might be the best and most serious set of a definite guide of what to do at concerts you’ve ever seen.\n\nThis advice is so everlasting, it could be passed down to your children and to their children like an old family recipe. So make sure you definitely do all of this to ensure you and everyone around you have the most memorable concert of their life.\n\nReminder: CanCulture actually doesn't want you to do any of this. Please remember concerts are a shared collective experience. This is a satirical piece and we hope you've enjoyed it.\n\nNoah Bajec, a 19-year-old singer-songwriter and music producer based in Toronto, says creativity of any form was a significant part of his life, even before getting serious about making his own music. “I’ve always liked the idea of creating something. I started as a visual artist,” says Bajec. With both of his parents being artists, there was always support and encouragement to “pursue the creative,” he says. Bajec reflects on a distinct childhood memory: “No boredom allowed! That’s what my mom painted in the treehouse. It helped me recognize that there is no such thing as boredom.” Boredom was never a bad thing because it led to creativity, he says.\n\nBajec is currently studying at Recording Arts Canada in Toronto. His sound is built upon authentic songwriting, backed by what Bajec calls “nomadic tendencies in instrumentation and production.” Inspired by the many artists and musicians surrounding him throughout an itinerant upbringing, Bajec gathered inspiration from popular soft-rock and r&b/soul artists by diving deep into their style of songs and immersing himself in their music. “It started as listening,” he says. Before he began making his own music, he enjoyed being a part of their world and the stories they painted with their songs.\n\nThe first song Bajec ever wrote was called ‘The Brink.’ “A lot of people listen back to their first music and are really critical about it,” says Bajec. “But when I listen back to it, I can hear the creative force and something really pure about early works.”\n\nBajec’s style of making music is a careful amalgamation of folk-singer songwriter and a profusion of processed sound. He gathers inspiration from known songwriters such as Sufjan Stevens, John Martyn, Fleetwood Mac and D’Angelo. “Their songwriting and fingerstyle, open, lush and alternate tunings, paired with an infusion of afrobeats and Latin jazz styles is something I love,” says Bajec. A year into playing the guitar, he really connected with the sound of the electric guitar and played around with an array of electric effects and sounds. “Then, as I started to write, I stripped it down a bit more and focused on more acoustic sounds.”\n\nBajec’s self-produced and self-written track ‘Empty House’ is a song he wrote while living in British Columbia during the summer of 2020. “I tucked it away and forgot about it until January of the following year when I revisited and recorded it in Ontario.” According to Bajec, ‘Empty House’ explores the idea of “home,” — what it is and how to feel it, accompanied by the distress from the inconclusiveness of believing and searching for it in a physical form.\n\nWhile discussing his process of writing music and how sometimes the “lines are blurry,” Bajec says, “some people write it fully then go into production.” Bajec talks about how the songwriting finishes itself, during the process of recording. He says there’s always something left to chance during the production of a piece, and having a certain “stamp” of the moment he records is something that makes it even more special.\n\nHis song ‘Human Dude’ is a ballad and a “rumination on the voices of the human condition.” It was written and recorded during the cold of November at Bajec’s old home studio in his childhood home in Muskoka.\n\n“I love the moments of stillness. I might be sitting down somewhere and listening to the silence or birds singing or the leaves or the wind. There's something that starts off a dance with your instrument,” says Bajec. He emphasizes a sense of intimacy that arises with his guitar, feeling it wholly and “making space” for the voice, if needed. He also mentions how he is extremely “attentive” to the fact that he is playing an instrument, which opens the gateway for lyrics to just start flowing out followed by the melody. “Sometimes I am making a sample and playing around different soundscapes and I find inspiration in that. Songwriting comes out while I'm producing.”\n\nBajec discusses how it can be a real struggle to set goals for the future, saying, “I can get tired or hypercritical of the music sometimes. I'll hold myself from seeing the initial magic in a song that I would have seen before, and it makes me struggle.” He says the songs “come and go” with regard to what is happening in his life at a certain moment. “Sometimes it's hard to promote something or share something you have written in a prior period. As that song could be a snapshot of a time in the past, a you in the past.”\n\nBajec plans to release a body of work, independent of the oeuvre that he is proud of, in the future. His newest piece, called ‘Don’t Look At Me’ will be released on all streaming platforms on Dec. 1. Bajec says he doesn’t wish to say anything about the song’s meaning. “I'd rather someone listen, hear it themselves. The track is smooth and airy, flow is contagious. The shimmering guitars, the visceral imagery in the songwriting, this one’s good.”\n\nThe Beaches have come a long way from playing smaller venues such as The Opera House and The Danforth Music Hall. The band originally named Done With Dolls is now formed by sisters Jordan (vocals) and Kylie Miller (lead guitar, backing vocals), Leandra Earl (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and Eliza Enman-McDaniel (drums). The indie rock group has two Junos up their sleeves for Breakthrough Artist in 2018 and Rock Album of the Year in 2022. Although the two awards are major achievements, the successful turnaround of post-breakup anthem “Blame Brett” is their greatest accomplishment thus far. The lead single to the band’s latest album, Blame My Ex, has blown up on TikTok and has accumulated more than 21 million streams on Spotify, getting the attention of Nelly Furtado and the Jonas Brothers. After performing in the U.S., The Beaches returned to Toronto playing two sold-out shows at Massey Hall.\n\nThe first of their two concerts had the band jamming on stage, exuding cool and carefree energy throughout their 20-song setlist. Like their catchy album, the indie-rock group seemed like they were in their comfort zone, playing for fans who have known them for more time than the rest of the world and with their family cheering in the crowd.\n\nAs the cheeky banger “Kismet” began to play, Jordan Millerlet loose, dancing and playing around with her white sunglasses and silk dress. The song eased into a set that combined tracks from Blame My Ex and their early hits, including “T-Shirt” and “Desdemona.”\n\nAlthough all of the songs were engaging live, there were a few that stuck out as most crowd-pleasing. The first being “My Body ft. Your Lips”, featuring a guest appearance from Beach Weather's frontman Nick Santino singing and flirting with the lead singer on stage. The performance was chemistry-filled and had the audience blushing, almost forgetting that most of the follow-up anthems are about heartbreak and angst.\n\nIt is important to note that Santino had come on stage prior to the show with his band to open for The Beaches, which allowed the audience to familiarize themselves with Beach Weather’s groovy tunes before the electrifying duet.\n\nKylie Miller and Earl playing their guitar riff for “Want What You Got” was another highlight. With their backs to each other, the two musicians took centre stage and grooved while Jordan played her bass near Enman-McDaniel’s drum set. At the end of the song, Jordan Miller even told the crowd, “It is so great to play in your hometown.” This particular track from the band’s earlier work showcased their signature sound, with catchy indie guitar parts and bold vocal delivery similar to bands like Franz Ferdinand. Despite their latest tunes still holding onto to the group’s sonoric style, they have adopted more of a pop approach with short verses and anthemic choruses.\n\nWhile there were a lot of rock’n’roll moments (with Earl even getting underwear thrown her way), there were also some intimate ones. A special shout out to the acoustic version of “If A Tree Falls”, a song off of their new album that was written with Valley's Karah James.\n\nYet, nothing on the setlist prepared the audience for the enthusiasm that filled Massey Hall when “Blame Brett” began to play. Needless to say many people already had the song stuck in their heads throughout the summer, but getting to jump and scream the lyrics at a fan-filled concert was unmatched.\n\nIt’s no secret that Drake is among the biggest stars in the world today. From his extensive music career — which continues to excel — to his entrepreneurial ventures, he is a mastermind celebrity who knows how to keep his audience entertained. He has also been a pipeline for many other successful artists and celebrities to help them advance to where they are now, thanks to his own work and accumulated fame. With his new album, For All the Dogs, which was released last month alongside his sold-out It’s All A Blur Tour, Drake has come a long way. Being in the spotlight for over a decade, we can’t help but wonder: How has he managed to stay relevant for so long?\n\nStarted From The Bottom\n\nDrake’s career most notably began when he starred in the television series Degrassi: The Next Generation from 2001 to 2009. His character, Jimmy Brooks, became a prominent figure on the show, allowing Drake to build an image. During this time, he started making music. His music ventures are what ultimately led to his exit from the hit Canadian series in 2009. This is due to producers finding out he was making music, and as he gained traction from this “side” venture, Drake was given the choice between continuing the show or music. Clearly, he made the right decision.\n\nIn 2006, he released his first mixtape, Room for Improvement, which fit right into the trending era of mixtapes where many of the rap and hip-hop artists we now know started their careers. Room for Improvement led Drake to work with R&B artist Trey Songz on “Replacement Girl,” the leading single on his sophomore mixtape, Comeback Season, which caught the attention of Lil Wayne. Who knew Lil Wayne’s shout-out to Drake when he said, \"Drizzy Drake, I love you boy!\" would have such an impact on Drake’s career – which we see evident in the success of his next mixtape, So Far Gone, which, to date, has accumulated 1.1 billion Spotify streams.\n\nA New Era\n\nSo Far Gone was the start of a new era for Drake. Alongside Thank Me Later, these two releases helped establish his presence as an artist. The two sound like extensions of his mixtape era but prominently showcase his vocal ability and improved production. This era sounds very retro and hip-hop-focused, with Drake exclusively rapping. He utilizes an orchestral sound to open many of his tracks with rhythmic percussive beats to help his rap flow evolve.\n\nBetween the release of these albums, Drake officially founded OVO Sound, his independent record label established in 2012, which has signed artists including PARTYNEXTDOOR, Majid Jordan, Smiley and many more. Drake’s previous albums are under this label, but it was not until 2012 that it was finally established and founded. This comes after Drake established himself, not just in the music industry but also as a celebrity personality. OVO Clothing was created a year prior, marking the dawn of the production of his clothing line (not to be confused with merch) and OVO as a whole.\n\n2011 also marked the release of Drake’s Take Care, showcasing his R&B range. This album set him apart from other rappers at the time as he incorporated not only rapping but his melodic vocals as well. Hits like “Marvin’s Room” and the album’s title track, “Take Care” featuring Rihanna, both gained over 555 million Spotify streams. This was a turning point in Drake’s music career when he was able to explore a new sound and showcase his versatility. We hear this new sound in his following albums If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late (IYRTITL) and What A Time To Be Alive, where he returned to his rap roots with fast-paced beats contrasted with slower, relaxed percussion, evoking different emotions through lyrics and backtracks.\n\nDuring this era, Drake collaborated with many notable artists, including Future, PARTYNEXTDOOR, Majid Jordan and Lil Wayne, intermingling audiences and bringing one another to even higher levels of fame. As well, Drake became closely associated with the Toronto Raptors; so much so that he was named “Global Ambassador” for the NBA team in 2013.\n\nSuperstar Status\n\nBy 2016, Drake’s sound was established and showcased his versatility through his lyricism, vocals, and production, as well as his overall storytelling ability. Views is a notable album that broke records. Songs like “One Dance” (his most streamed song), “Controlla,” and “Hotline Bling” allowed him to rise to superstar status. The album as a whole feels like a story where Drake takes listeners to Toronto to experience the four distinct seasons felt here. The Ringer debates different views of the album and points out the theme to the tracklist, where T.C. Kane says, “It’s supposed to start in winter and then go through summer and back to winter, which is meant to showcase the ‘two extreme moods’ the seasons cause in Toronto.”\n\n“Keep the Family Close,” “Weston Road Flows,” “Controlla,” and “Fire and Desire” mark the beginning of each season of the year, making the album an all-year-round listen. Arguably, this is among his best albums, thanks to his attention to detail and authenticity, creating an album that feels like a love letter to Toronto.\n\nIn More Life, Scorpion, Dark Lane Tape Demos and Certified Lover Boy, Drake’s sound changes while still infusing rap and R&B seamlessly, paying homage to the groovy old-school Drake but moving away from the percussion that was so heavily present in his earlier work. Speaking of old-school, Care Package, an archive album, compiles Drake songs from 2010 to 2016, debuting as a hit. In this era, Drake took his talents to the television and film industry as a producer on a number of projects starting in 2017. Euphoria and Top Boy are his biggest projects, with more to come.\n\nDrake is not only a superstar artist but also a personality on social media. If you have seen his presence online, he plays along with the jokes – he seems like a fun guy who doesn’t take life too seriously. He shows love to his fans and stays active on his social media, keeping people coming back to see what he’s up to. Memes of Drake consistently find ways to blow up, like the “Drake the type of guy” trend or even his song with Central Cee, “On the Radar Freestyle,” in which his intro went viral on TikTok.\n\nThe Drake We Know Today\n\nBy 2021, Drake was the definition of a household name with the hit release of Certified Lover Boy. The release of Honestly, Nevermind in 2022, however, marks another major shift in Drake’s musical style as he explores the dance and house genres. Sadly, the album was not well received. The piece is consistently upbeat, with his voice melting into the changing tempos. The bright synths and stabbing drums are prominent and definitely unique to his discography but not appreciated in the way Drake had likely hoped.\n\nLater that year Drake released the collaborative album Her Loss, which allowed Drake to redeem himself. His partnership with 21 Savage brought back the Drake people missed. Heavily rap dominated with some great features such as Travis Scott and production from Earl on that Beat and Metro Boomin, so many elements did the trick to bring him his credit.\n\nNow, in 2023, we have the latest Drake album, For All The Dogs, which has received mixed reviews. The record includes notable features from SZA, J Cole, Yeat, even his son Adonis, and many more. This album acts as a great summary of his music career thanks to the lyrics and authenticity of this piece of work. The authenticity is demonstrated in the album art, created by Adonis, and Drake’s vulnerability in songs like “Slime You Out” and “What Would Pluto Do.”\n\nThe new album opens with “Virginia Beach” which includes a Frank Ocean sample and transitions into a soft kickdrum and melody combo with the sample continuing to play in the background. The song encapsulates a full circle moment for Drake, as he once performed in Virginia Beach with Lil Wayne in 2014. In the song, Drake reminisces on his career. This opens the album perfectly, paying homage to his humble beginnings. For All The Dogs's release aligned with the last weekend of his It’s All A Blur Tour, adding an increased sentiment to the release while cementing Drake’s career.\n\nThroughout Drake’s professional life, he has grown exponentially. From making mixtapes in his friends’ basement to owning a record label, clothing brand, and much more, Drake has certainly established himself as an all-time great. He continues to stay relevant through his content and interactions on social media and makes big efforts to give back to his community. He also never fails to pay tribute to his roots in the city of Toronto. All in all, he is an inspiration and his story is truly one that could not have been possible without the immense hard work and dedication he puts into his craft.\n\nIf you attended a concert at Budweiser Stage this summer or ventured outside the Rogers Centre after a Blue Jays game, chances are you’ve likely encountered the vibrant musical force that is James Flannagan, better known as Kip James. “Kip,” being the name he was almost given as a child, one he feels holds more star power.\n\nAmplifier humming with live drum backing tracks boasting and his guitar and vocals soaring above it all, he’s hard to miss, and that’s exactly what he’s aiming for.\n\nKip James, a self-described entertainer, is on a mission to inject positivity into a world that often feels chaotic and divided, uniting people through the power of music. His performances go beyond mere entertainment; they generate a profound sense of unity that transcends the boundaries of spoken language in a way only music can.\n\nBusking, the activity of playing music in the street or another public place for voluntary donations, is a testament to the unity art can inspire, even amid chaos. As James speaks of protests and counter-protests, he contrasts the harsh, divisive scenes with the harmonious interactions he fosters through his performances. \"I'm doing the exact opposite,” he says. “The unity of it is so beautiful.”\n\nAudiences can be found dancing together and singing along to his covers, a reminder that music has the power to bring people together in spontaneous ways. He hopes his music can remind people to come together, share their love for music and enjoy a moment of unity, no matter how different they may be.\n\nHis \"make it happen\" attitude is reflected in every aspect of his musical career, demonstrating his steadfast dedication to his craft. During the summer, he diligently tracked the major events unfolding throughout the city's core, recognizing the prime opportunities to connect with his audience. This led him to perform before and after every baseball game this season and for the crowds ushering out of the concerts of notable stars who played in Toronto this summer. James could always be found gracing the streets with his music and fostering a communal ambiance, riding on the good vibes generated by these events.\n\nAmong the memories etched in James' mind, one moment stands out. An older man, possibly in his late 70s or early 80s, approached with his daughter. \"Can you play 'Pretty Woman' by Roy Orbison?\" the man requested. James enthusiastically obliged, and the music profoundly impacted the man. Unbeknownst to James, this outing to watch a ballgame marked the older gentleman's first venture outdoors in a year, following the loss of his wife. James' performance had allowed him to hear his favourite songs and, for a brief moment, ease the pain of his loss.\n\nInspired by his dad’s classic rock CDs which made up the soundtrack of his childhood, James picked up the acoustic guitar at the age of 12. With determination and passion as his only guides, he taught himself the songs that formed the core of his musical upbringing. Many of these songs make up his busking repertoire today.\n\nKip James' journey would not be complete without mentioning his band, Fighting Chance!, which he formed during his university years. Acting as headman and bass player of the indie band, he has joined forces with his younger brother Joe on the drums.\n\nThe band members, including guitarists Dylan Duthie and Ryan Walsh, have diverse influences, each bringing their unique styles to the table. According to James, the band chooses not to subscribe to a particular genre; their repertoire spans classic rock to modern indie, allowing them to craft an eclectic sonic identity that resonates with a diverse audience. Their Spotify describes their sound as “90's radio rock with early 70’s powerpop,” while their Instagram bio identifies the group as “college radio rock revival.”\n\nTheir most recent single, “Spin Me Round,” has been warmly received by the many fans James has acquired throughout his busking endeavours. The band aims to release a single every month and plans to tour next year.\n\nKip James' journey isn't tethered to Toronto, however. Fleeing the cold weather, James has taken his act international. He recently made his way to New York City, busking in iconic spots such as Times Square and Madison Square Garden. He then headed overseas to play the streets of Portugal, serenading folks across the world. But true to his roots, he’s returned to Toronto, reuniting with Fighting Chance! to play a small tour throughout Ontario this month.\n\nThe path Kip James treads is marked by sheer dedication and unwavering persistence. He is far from content with standing still, instead tirelessly working to turn his dreams into a tangible reality. His performances, whether they be on the streets of Toronto, NYC, or Lisbon, are a whirlwind of good vibes, beginning with the first strum of his electric guitar and gaining momentum with each passing note. Keep an eye, or rather an ear, out for the eclectic busker the next time you find yourself at a major event downtown Toronto, and don’t be afraid to sing and dance along.\n\nSofia Shahbazzadeh and Helen Chen aren’t submitting the average practicum project. The two Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) students transformed their in-class pitch into a live music festival that will showcase the talent of local artists. Complete with vendors, an intimate venue and a high-tech video production, the Grounders Music Festival will occur on Nov. 4 and will be streamable afterwards.\n\nGrounders began as a final project during Shahbazzadeh and Chen's third year. The pair had known each other since high school and decided to combine their shared passion for audio, music and multi-camera production to pitch the music festival. They not only wanted to create a unique live experience for the community, but a fully produced concert video as well.\n\nShahbazzadeh and Chen said that the support they received from their professors and peers helped move the festival forward. “It is a student-run project and there's a lot of love and energy that goes into it,” said Shahbazzadeh. “There's always people out there that want to help you and that believe in your project and your passion.”\n\nThe festival is being put on by a group of women and non-binary creatives who wanted the lineup to reflect their diverse identities. They said they want to foster a sense of community among attendees and artists alike through the event.\n\n“It became a community building initiative and a place where the [Greater Toronto Area’s] community of arts can come together,” Shahbazzadeh said.\n\nChen said that while casting performers, she considered obvious factors like the quality of the music and how the artists would contribute to the vibe of the festival, but also wanted to spotlight marginalized communities. “We were focused on finding musicians of colour, female and non-binary musicians, musicians that belong to the 2SLGBTQ+ community.”\n\nGrounders embraces the concept of time as a driving force behind its curation. Separated into daytime and nighttime portions, the festival will feature nine artists and bands ranging from acoustic folk to experimental pop. The genres of music are intended to change throughout the day, mirroring the passage of time from afternoon to evening. Chen said the festival is a careful blend of acoustic folk, pop and rock, creating a dynamic atmosphere that will resonate with the audience.\n\nThe festival will be held in the Junction at OBJX Studios, which features floor-to-ceiling windows. Chen said that the team wanted a venue with a lot of natural lighting, so that the sky could be the festival’s backdrop and the music could match its atmosphere.\n\nThough not live-streamed, the show will be meticulously recorded so that the artists can have it as a portfolio piece or music fans can stream it. According to Shahbazzadeh, the polished videos will be posted on YouTube. She said she drew inspiration from NPR’s Tiny Desk concerts and wanted to mimic the series’ small and cozy ambience in the festival.\n\nGrace Turner and Theo White started the band City Builders just before they began dating. They will be performing at Grounders as part of the nighttime set.\n\nTurner explained that musical collaboration came naturally to the pair. They said they both use music as a love language, whether they’re writing together or on their own.\n\n“The love that we put into this music comes from a very genuine place,” White said. “I think that translates in the music.”\n\nWhite said that bands come together for pre-show rituals to ensure everyone is on the same page, but that coordination already exists when the only two members are dating. To him, performances are like a long and rather public date. “We spend the whole day together, we do an activity—which is practice—and then we have a date night—which is a performance.”\n\nTurner said that even though she gets a bit nervous before performing, they always have fun once they’re up on stage together. No matter how large or unfamiliar the crowd may be, White said it's about sharing a moment and creating a connection with the people who come to listen to their music.\n\n“Even if it's a room full of people we don't know, it feels like we're all connected in some sort of way and we're all here for a reason,” she said. “That's what kind of eases the intimidation of getting up on a stage.”\n\nWhite promises that any audience that watches them perform will have a fresh and exciting experience. Their sets are filled with new songs, demos, and unreleased tracks, making every concert a unique experience for their audience. “Everyone who comes to our shows gets something that they've never heard before and maybe won't ever hear again.”\n\nTurner said that she’s excited to perform at Grounders but is ultimately looking forward to connecting with different creatives in one space. “One of my favourite parts about playing is talking to people after seeing what kind of art they make,” she said.\n\nThe networking aspect of the festival ties back to the community-oriented approach that Chen and Shahbazzadeh are striving for. Chen said they want the concert to double as an artistic hub and a space for creatives to connect. “We want there to be vendors, food options and different industry professionals that maybe people can network with,” she said.\n\nShahbazzadeh said that at its core, the festival is just a place where artists and music fans can congregate and talk to each other about their interests.\n\nThis approach is aiming to create a sense of community and a vibrant atmosphere that fosters organic interactions between artists and attendees. Both have the opportunity to meet and collaborate with each other, fostering creativity and organic relationships that Shahbazzadeh and Chen hope can lead to future collaborations.\n\nSofia Aëdon will be performing at the festival as part of the daytime set. With a high school background in theatre, she said she feels more comfortable performing in front of audiences because of her experience on stage. To her, putting on a character is an integral part of each show. Putting effort into her outfit and makeup not only enhances her confidence but also adds a unique dimension to her artistic expression.\n\nAëdon explained that she naturally slips into acting whenever she performs a set. “I think that it just makes me more confident,” she said. “It's me, but it's in a way that’s like playing a character on stage.”\n\nHer performances are a blend of her authentic self and the character she portrays. This fusion of reality and artistry creates a captivating experience for her audience, leaving a lasting impression.\n\nAëdon said that she wishes there were more festivals like Grounders, that aimed to showcase local talent.\n\nChen joked that if Grounders goes well, there may be more similar events planned in the future.\n\nShahbazzadeh said there have been many sleepless nights as the team worked to bring the festival together. So when the event finally arrives, she just wants to soak in the experience. “I really want to enjoy the day and take it as it comes,” she said. “If I see smiles at the event, that would make my day.”\n\nCheck out this playlist to help you get ready for the Grounders Music Festival!\n\nIn the heart of Toronto, the freaks and ghouls roam the streets… and the nightclubs!\n\nBy: Klea Pinari\n\nThe first chilling strum of gothic guitar is your opening to a world of darkness – a world cloaked in black, but one that still feels unequivocally bright.\n\nWhen many people hear the word ‘goth,’ they conjure the same image: skin pale as a ghost, eyelids painted jet black. All that comes to mind is a jarring set of traits, a bold and enthusiastic stand against mainstream culture.\n\nThis image is, more or less, an accurate depiction of many goths in the scene. However, the core of goth culture is not their heavy eyeliner or their billowy Victorian sleeves, even though style is an important aspect of being goth. The core of the culture itself is the music.\n\nThe goth scene is a revolutionary subculture that started its journey back in the ‘70s before bursting into the ‘80s with flair. Goth music originated in the U.K. as a result of the post-punk movement, blooming into a large scope of closely related genres that all held the same musical heart.\n\nSome of the most iconic musicians making up the goth scene include Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure and Joy Division. Genres including post-punk and dark wave, along with glam rock and hard rock, are key components of goth’s musical sound and some of the driving forces behind the creation of goth rock. These genres are saturated with moody and experimental resonance. Goth music is unique in the way that it does not bend to the will of any conventional sound – it simply hands itself to the listener.\n\nThis music does it all and explores the dark crevices of musical sounds and themes that popular music is too afraid to peer into. The harsh melody of the distorted guitar and the lilted tune of the singer’s voice come together to create an experience that can only be explained in simple words: haunting and beautiful.\n\nGoth first emerged in Toronto in the ‘80s, but it wasn’t always known as goth. Toronto goths go by a handful of names, including “Batcavers,” as stated by the Encyclopedia Gothica. Batcavers is an ode to The Batcave, a London club that kickstarted the goth movement.\n\nGoth music brought forth a culture of goth clubbing, followed by goth dancing and accentuated by goth fashion. The defining feature of each is goth’s incessant need to be completely authentic.\n\nClubbing is not only an integral part of the goth scene, it’s the home for all things goth. In the ‘80s, there was an influx of after-hours alternative clubs, as discussed by journalist and DJ Denise Benson in her article Then & Now; Voodoo, which highlighted the history of one of the early Toronto clubs named Voodoo. Many other clubs could be found along Queen Street West and other parts of downtown Toronto, playing underground goth rock, post-punk and more.\n\nSome of the most iconic clubs included Sanctuary: Vampire Sex Bar and Nocturne, which could be heard booming into the early hours of the morning with the beat of stripped drums. These clubs unified the lonely Toronto batcavers under the safety of the music and a shared understanding of their darker side. For the first time, a goth community was formed with like-minded people who simply wanted to enjoy the noise.\n\nGoth dancing was all the rage in the clubs. The style was very distinct and bizarre, as is everything that has to do with goths. It was an erratic flailing of arms, movements that flow followed immediately by stuttering movements that jerk, a haunting amalgamation of feelings in the form of dance. These dances could range from anything between stomping your feet and banging your head aggressively, to languidly letting your hands move in any direction they want. Goth dancing is all about feeling the music and moving exactly in the way your heart tells you to.\n\nVery soon, Queen Street West was crawling with Batcavers. In 1988, they officially adopted the term “goths.” But even before identifying as goths, they had a third, more intimate name for themselves: freaks. This label was not derogatory; in fact, it was a badge of honour for all those who wore it, and it remained as such through the ensuing decades. The term freak was an embrace of the authentic and off-putting nature of their existence.\n\nGoth music sang of the strange, the sickly, and the sexy. It was a medium for liberation in a new unusual light. Being a freak was a rejection of the societal norms of the ‘80s and ‘90s and an acceptance of the values of goth music: an all-inclusive, queer, sexually liberated form of art. The label was a representation of the darkness and strangeness of the genre, which was exactly what made — and continues to make — the music so beautiful.\n\nArtists such as Masochistic Religion and Vampire Beach Babes were some of the goth bands that emerged in Canada during the height of the movement. They made numerous references to monsters and vampires in their art. The existence of creatures of the night is a frequent goth symbol and helps to characterize the idea of the “other.” These monsters are given the spotlight in goth music, acting as guiding lights for the freaks to express themselves for who they really are, no matter how the rest of the world reacts to them.\n\nThough the goth scene has died down since the ‘80s and ‘90s, there are still pockets of belonging peeking through the dark crevices. Sanctuary and Nocturne have both closed down, but there are new clubs in their place, teeming with the life of the undead. See-Scape is one of the clubs that remain to preserve goth culture, but there are also goth events at venues such as The Garrison and Bovine Sex Club.\n\nCanadian artists like Dermabrasion and ACTORS are still active and create music that captures the essence of goth rock and all the other genres that make up the goth music scene. The decline in goths wandering down Queen Street West is exactly why it’s important for there to be new artists continuing to pave these pockets of belonging. Lol Tolhurst, drummer and co-founder of The Cure, said that goth was still alive and well through new artists, despite it not looking the same as when he was at the forefront of the movement.\n\n“I see all these people live in small places — their way out was us (The Cure),” he said in an interview with CNN. “I’m very honored and proud of that. That’s what keeps (goth) going.”\n\nGoth music uses its doom and gloom as a means to explore the uncanny, to welcome the freakish and the bizarre. It’s not consumed by the darkness – it’s uplifted and inspired. It’s haunted. It’s beautiful.\n\nToronto-based band Pudding took to the intimate stage of the Dakota Tavern on a mid-October Saturday night, giving the small crowd an impressive performance of both covers and captivating original songs. The band has been writing original songs and playing the Toronto club circuit since their inception in 2012. The fusion of New Orleans funk with the soul of Chicago blues made for a groovy performance that had the crowd dancing and swaying all night long.\n\nThe band kicked the night off with their take on Shakey Ground by The Temptations. John Mavro, lead vocalist and bass player, established Pudding's high-energy stage presence from the top of the set. His voice started off powerful and only got better throughout the evening as he got more comfortable on the stage. He spent the night moving about the small stage and dancing along with the audience, seamlessly transitioning from one song to the next with the help of the band.\n\nJustin Binder was no slouch on electric guitar, giving several solos that notably excited the crowd each time he played. Whether they were covering songs like Raspberry Beret by Prince, Tina Turner's rendition of Proud Mary, originally sung by Creedence Clearwater Revival, or shredding to original pieces like Voodoo disco soul, Look what you done to me and Shake it up, the sound cut through the tavern, filling it with energy.\n\nKeyboardist Lee Cohen gave a standout performance in Will It Go Round in Circles by Billy Preston, and truly put Pudding's touch on the classic song by adding their own distinctive funky sound and taking the time to let each other have their solos. By the end of the song Cohen left the crowd wanting more and cheering for his instrumental solos.\n\nLewis Spring on the drums provided the perfect backbeat, adapting to the various songs played throughout the evening. Spring's creative fill-ins and rhythm were just one key factor throughout the night, keeping the audience moving and adding the unique touch that is Pudding.\n\nThe night was a musical adventure featuring legendary covers of the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Amy Winehouse and many more. Pudding gave every song a unique and fresh twist, like changing up the tempo and experimenting with different instrumental sounds. The crowd crept closer to the stage as the night progressed and the lights dimmed. Although some people left the venue during the break, the ones who stuck around kept the high energy all night long for act two and continued to dance and sing along near the stage.\n\nAlong with covers, the band added a few original songs to the setlist which were equally praiseworthy. This gave the audience a taste of their lyrics and showcased their distinctive groovy sound while still providing the same high-energy funk.\n\nAs the night drew to a close, the band launched into Part-Time Girl, an original song that brought the true Pudding fans to the front of the stage singing along. Even those who didn't know the song could appreciate the talent of lead singer Mavro as he belted out the lyrics.\n\nThe local band infused the small tavern with limitless vitality creating an environment where friends could come together to dance, sing and enjoy live music. Despite the crowd being unfamiliar with certain songs, the audience took this as an opportunity to discover fresh tracks. Those who stuck around till the end of the show left the venue with classics from the ‘70s and ‘80s stuck in their head and a genuine appreciation for the band's talent and funky vibe."
