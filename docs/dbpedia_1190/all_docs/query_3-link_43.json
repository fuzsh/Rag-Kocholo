        "text": "[Verse 1]\n\nI said remember this moment\n\nIn the back of my mind\n\nThe time we stood with our shaking hands\n\nThe crowds in stands went wild\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nWe were the kings and the queens\n\nAnd they read off our names\n\nThe night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nYou held your head like a hero on a history book page\n\nIt was the end of a decade\n\nBut the start of an age\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\nLong live the walls we crashed through\n\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\n\nI was screaming, “Long live all the magic we made”\n\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\n\nOne day, we will be remembered\n\n[Verse 4]\n\nI said remember this feeling\n\nI pass the pictures around\n\nOf all the years that we stood there on the sidelines\n\nWishing for right now\n\n[Verse 5]\n\nWe are the kings and the queens\n\nYou traded your baseball cap for a crown\n\nWhen they gave us our trophies\n\nAnd we held them up for our town\n\n[Verse 6]\n\nAnd the cynics were outraged\n\nScreaming, “This is absurd!”\n\n‘Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped-up jeans got to rule the world\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\nLong live the walls we crashed through\n\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\n\nI was screaming, “Long live all the magic we made”\n\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\n\nI’m not afraid\n\n[Chorus 2]\n\nLong live all the mountains we moved\n\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\n\nI was screaming, “Long live that look on your face”\n\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\n\nOne day, we will be remembered\n\n[Bridge]\n\nHold on to spinning around\n\nConfetti falls to the ground\n\nMay these memories break our fall\n\nWill you take a moment, promise me this?\n\nThat you’ll stand by me forever\n\nBut if God forbid fate should step in\n\nAnd force us into a goodbye\n\nIf you have children someday\n\nWhen they point to the pictures\n\nPlease tell them my name\n\nTell them how the crowds went wild\n\nTell them how I hope they shine\n\n[Chorus Breakdown]\n\nLong live the walls we crashed through\n\nI had the time of my life, with you\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\nLong, long live the walls we crashed through\n\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\n\nAnd I was screaming, “Long live”\n\nAll the magic we made\n\nAnd bring on all the pretenders, I’m not afraid"
