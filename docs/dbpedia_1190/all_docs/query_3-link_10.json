        "text": "Party Rock hits the streets of Amsterdam in the Mickey Finnegan-directed video for Far East Movement’s “Live My Life,” the Justin Bieber-assisted single off the group’s sophomore album Dirty Bass, due May 8. Kev Nish, Prohgress, J-Splif, and DJ Virman board the party bus and make their way through town, starting a flash mob with LMFAO.\n\n“We wanted to bring that dirty bass out into the streets of Amsterdam since it’s one of the bass and party capitals of the world,” said J-Splif.\n\n“Word spread quickly that we were shooting the music video around the city,” added Kev Nish. “Kids were out of school because of a teacher strike, so while shooting the party bus scenes around town and the surprise flash mob in the middle of Amsterdam, there were hundreds of kids on the streets and local news crews chasing the bus, ‘livin that life’ with us.”\n\nFar East Movement and LMFAO will bring their party anthems to the U.S. when the “Cherrytree Pop Alternative Tour” kicks off on May 22 in Columbus, Ohio."
