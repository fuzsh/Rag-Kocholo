        "text": "The Hottest New Releases, Concerts, Future Must-Haves, and Headlines from Around the World!\n\nYour Life The Mixtape Magazine\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n25 min read\n\n·\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\n--\n\nLondon-based songwriter-producer Sky_A teams up with Luo’s Josh Trinnaman on ‘Walker’ remix\n\nSpotify / Apple Music / Amazon Music\n\nLondon-based artist Sky_A released his second single ‘Walker’ on January 26th 2024, taken from his upcoming debut album. He recently teamed up with Josh Trinnaman, the producer and one half of electronic/progressive rock group Luo to release a remix of the single.\n\nThe project name for writer and producer Sky Ainsbury, Sky_A expands on his palette of electronic, acoustic and progressive rock music with this track, to bring a darker edge to his intimate yet cinematic sound.\n\nSky has synaesthesia, and seeks to share with listeners his own experience of music as something deep and immersive, comprised of shapes, colours and textures. Working professionally as a filmmaker and motion graphics artist, he also brings a strong visual element to this project, with a focus on long-form storytelling and beautiful, hypnotic abstract visuals.\n\nDescribing the impact of his perception, and his work in visuals on his music, Sky explains: “This is world-building for me. There is a big story to be told. Each track is a scene, and as far as possible I have instruments representing characters. It’s my “Swan Lake”. I’ll shut my eyes and see these elements like a rolling landscape — sometimes it’s serene and beautific, and sometimes it’s like barbed wire and collapsed concrete buildings. That’s what I want a listener to see when they hear this.”\n\n‘Walker’ was self-performed and produced, with the addition of virtuoso drums by Adam Betts (Three Trapped Tigers, Squarepusher, Pulp) and additional production and mixing by Aneek Thapar (65daysofstatic, Rival Consoles). Lyrically it explores self-knowledge and finding inner strength.\n\nWhen to celebrate, and when to keep the powder dry\n\nWhen to medicate, and when to metamorphosise\n\nAbout the inspiration for the song Sky_A says: “It’s an angry piece of music. Like, anti-imperial levels of anger. It’s about having been lied to, having participated in awful things on a huge scale, and becoming aware, resolving to undo the damage that has been done. It’s a bit like a war march, sonically. Built around the sound of my thumb on an unearthed guitar lead — a sound most musicians will recognise, barely musical — it has this feeling for me of molten rock, this tectonic movement, as this person is accepting their pain as a gift, of purposeful anger. I like it being called Walker, I hear the rhythm as a kind of limping gait, wounded but resolute. There’s a lot more to it than that — every song on the album is a scene, and the sounds are characters — which won’t make much sense out of context, but it comes at a decisive point, it’s the squaring up to the challenge ahead, it’s about seeing the horror and brutality in the world and not looking away.”\n\nDiscussing the remix of the song Sky_A states: “Josh Trinnaman is the producer behind Luo, an electronic/progressive rock group I’ve been following for the best part of a decade. Josh reached out to me after hearing a clip of Walker, saying he’d love to rework it. I’m super happy with the result, a super glitchy, dirty remix that keeps the atmosphere of the original and adds some cybery videogame synth lines.”\n\nBandcamp: https://skyasound.bandcamp.com/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/skya.sound\n\nMEST Debuts “Hate You Sober” (ft. Spencer Charnas of Ice Nine Kills) The Second Single Off Upcoming Release ‘Youth’; Out Everywhere On June 21st\n\nBeloved Chicago pop-punk band MEST will release the new album ‘Youth’ via SBÄM Records on June 21.\n\nFollowing last month’s release of the lead single “WHEN WE WERE YOUNG” (feat. Jaret Reddick from Bowling For Soup), MEST has just debuted the second single, “HATE YOU SOBER” (ft. Spencer Charnas of Ice Nine Kills. The track delves into the theme of a toxic relationship, depicting how one might endure it by numbing themselves with alcohol, while also exploring the journey towards summoning the courage to break free from the toxicity.\n\nStream “Hate You Sober” / Pre-Save ‘Youth’ HERE: https://orcd.co/mestyouth\n\nSpeaking on the recording of the new album, founding member and front man Tony Lovato says, “The drives to the studio were about an hour and 20 minutes long. A lot of my inspiration for this record was found on those drives. I would just listen to all the records that I grew up listening to. Which brought back a ton of memories. It would just put me in another state of mind. The majority of “Youth” was written up in the hills of Los Angeles where I recorded a bunch of our early records. I would get random flashbacks seeing spots I hadn’t seen in years. But as much as I love all the memories and stories of the past, I’m not one to think that the best days are over. I’m creating new core memories and living my life now, so that in 20 years I’ll look back fondly. The same as I do now. These songs are a cheers to the past with a here’s to the future.”\n\n‘YOUTH’ Tracklist:\n\n1. WHEN WE WERE YOUNG\n\n2. HATE YOU SOBER\n\n3. BARELY HANGING ON\n\n4. EMPTY ROOM\n\n5. WAS IT WORTH IT\n\n6. THAT SATURDAY\n\n7. PARKING LOT\n\nAbout MEST:\n\nMEST was formed in 1995 with Tony Lovato, his brother Steve, and his cousin Matt in Blue Island, Illinois; a small working-class town on the Southside of Chicago. From the beginning, Tony used that blue-collar work ethic to quickly build a dedicated following in the growing Chicago punk rock scene. They released a couple of demos on cassette in 1996 and 1997 and a full-length record in 1998. This got the attention of John Feldmann, lead singer and frontman of the punk-ska band Goldfinger, who secured them a demo deal with Maverick Records. Seven days after turning the recordings, Maverick signed them to a multi-record deal. MEST released four records with Maverick/Warner Brothers from the year 2000 to 2005, two of which went gold in Japan.\n\nMEST has appeared on TV shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live and Last Call with Carson Daly. MEST had toured in the United States, Europe and Japan numerous times, and performed as one of the headlining acts on the now infamous WARPED TOUR in 2003 and 2005.\n\nIn 2006 MEST announced their break-up and did their farewell tour “So Long and Thanks For The Booze.”\n\nIn 2006, not knowing what his next move was, frontman Tony Lovato moved to Los Angeles Ca. Tony left his house, his friends and family behind. But the one thing he did take with him was his strong work ethic from his roots.\n\nTony said, “To go from touring the world with the friends, that you grew up with since childhood, owning a house and having financial stability to essentially being alone and sleeping on someone’s couch for a couple years it really put life and the music business into perspective. One day everybody wants to work with you and the next they won’t return your phone calls. But I didn’t achieve everything that I did up to that point by sitting around waiting on others. In the early years of success; including our first big shows, our record deal, and even some of the biggest tours through our booking agent were all due to my friendships that I cultivated over the years. After some lonely and depressed years I had to remind myself what I was capable of and what I had achieved. I remembered something my grandfather told me as a young boy, “if you want something done right, you’ve got to do it yourself.”“\n\nAfter a couple years of soul searching Tony started to write and record new music. Releasing two acoustic records featuring fan favorites and the properly titled LP “NOT WHAT YOU EXPECTED. (2012) Tony continued touring even bringing MEST to country’s previously never visited, like Australia and Mexico.\n\nIn 2013 Tony found out he would be embarking on a new chapter in his life; one that he was certain would never come; fatherhood. Tony began to question whether a career in the music business would be wise with a baby on the way. He moved out of LA and to AZ to raise his family. His son, London, was born in 2014 and was the inspiration behind the song, ‘Don’t Worry Son’.\n\n“That song that was actually meant to inspire my son later in life. “But in turn inspired me and reignited my passion for writing,” said Tony\n\nThis became the driving force behind the development of the next MEST album. Two years later, with an arsenal of music, he knew that CA is where he needed to be.\n\nIn 2018, MEST headed into the studio with Cameron Webb to start production on the next record. MEST initially signed with Cyber Trax, the record label of El Hefe from the legendary Punk Rock band NOFX. After finishing the record, communication broke down with that label and Tony was reminded of his grandfather’s statement and decided it was best to buy the record back and release it himself, raising over $54,000 on Kickstarter.\n\nMEST released their 7th Full length album titled ‘Masquerade’ in January 2020, three months before the world shut down from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMEST toured extensively in 2019 as direct support for Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake and was the special guest on the Reel Big Fish/Bowling for Soup co-headlining tour in the summer of 2019. Finally ending the year doing direct support for the Swedish punk rock band Millencolin.\n\nWhat does the future like for MEST?\n\nMEST has spent the last 2 years writing/recording the first of three LP’s which will come out this year with the 1st one titled ‘Youth.’ Tony has secured a deal for the upcoming MEST LP to be released on Avex Records in Japan as well as SBAM Records in Europe.\n\nNever forgetting the blue collar work ethic they inherited from their home town. MEST looks forward to heading back out on the road to do what they do best, perform their energetic and entertaining live shows. All the while still earning each fan through their grass roots approach.\n\nMEST is heading to Europe May 25 through June 9th for a headlining run and festival appearances.\n\nWhen Tony was asked to sum up 28 years of MEST thus far, he replied “I don’t know, I mean honestly it feels like we’re just getting started…”\n\nTour Dates:\n\nSun, May 26 @ DrinkDrink, Rue Paepsem 123.8, Brussels, Belgium w/ Taken Days, Young Enough, and Mirabelle\n\nMon, May 27 @ Goldrube, Eisenschmiede 85, Kassel, Germany w/ Taken Days\n\nTue, May 28 @ p.m.k., Viaduktbogen 18/20, Innsbruck, Austria w/Taken Days\n\nThu, May 30 @ Cafe Central Punk Rock Festival (Cafe Central) Weinheim, Germany\n\nFri, May 31 @ SBAM Fest 2024 (Wels Alter Schlachthof, Dragonerstraße 22, 4600 Wels, Austria, Austria) with GOLDFINGER (exclusive Austria/Germany), SICK OF IT ALL, H2O, SATANIC SURFERS, BRACKET (exclusive SBAM Fest), NOT ON TOUR (exclusive SBAM Fest too), VERSUS THE WORLD, DFL, NOFNOG, SWALLOW’S ROSE and many many more\n\nSat, Jun 1 @ SBAM Fest 2024 ( Im Wizemann, Quellenstraße 7 70376, Stuttgart, Germany) w/ GOLDFINGER (exclusive Austria/Germany), SICK OF IT ALL, H2O, SATANIC SURFERS, BRACKET (exclusive SBAM Fest), NOT ON TOUR (exclusive SBAM Fest too), VERSUS THE WORLD, DFL, NOFNOG, SWALLOW’S ROSE and many many more\n\nSun, Jun 2 @ Club Vaudeville, Von-Behring-Straße 6–8, 88131, Lindau, Germany w/Taken Days\n\nTue, Jun 4 @ Backstage By the Mill, 92 Boulevard de Clichy 75018, Paris, France w/ Taken Days\n\nWed, Jun 5 @ New Cross Inn, 323 New Cross Road, London MEST w/Taken Days\n\nThu, Jun 6 @ 6:00PM New Cross Inn, 323 New Cross Road, London w/Taken Days\n\nFri, Jun 7 @ 7:30PM Pitcher , Oberbilker Allee 29 40215, Düsseldorf Friedrichstadt w/Taken Days\n\nSat, Jun 8 @ Kufa, Langer Garten 1 31137, Hildesheim, Germany w/Taken Days and Holly Would Surrender\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Mestofficial\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/theofficialmest\n\nhttps://twitter.com/theofficialmest\n\nhttps://mestmusic.com\n\nhttps://shop.sbam.rocks\n\nwww.facebook.com/SBAM.ROCKS\n\nwww.instagram.com/sbamrocks\n\nYoutube\n\nNJ Alt-Rockers Bobby Mahoney Release New Single “We Go On” Off Upcoming Album ‘Another Deadbeat Summer’ Out June 14 on Wicked Cool Records\n\nCentral New Jersey alternative rock outfit Bobby Mahoney, newly signed to Stevie Van Zandt’s Wicked Cool Records, has released “We Go On,” the next single off the band’s upcoming label debut, ‘Another Deadbeat Summer,’ out June 14.\n\nStream the track/pre-order the album here: https://orcd.co/wegoon\n\nWatch the “We Go On” teaser trailer here: https://youtu.be/W-P_B67Nqc0?si=bFDuqB33LGd2H7YN\n\nMahoney says, “We began tracking “We Go On” in Joe Pomarico’s parent’s basement in September 2020, in the middle of the Pandemic. We were masked-up, socially-distanced, etc. We were all starved for human interaction/connection, and live music, so it was important to us that we built the song up from a foundation of us all playing together in a room. It is a song about death, the cosmos, “Enjoying Every Sandwich” as Warren Zevon said.\n\nLike our favorite songs, I believe the impact of our brief time on this planet will echo long after we are gone, but that we owe it to ourselves and the world to leave as many positive echoes as possible, while enjoying and making the most of our own time here before we move onto whatever comes next. Like your favorite song, we go on.”\n\nIf you could distill Bobby Mahoney’s flourishing career down to a single moment, it might well have happened in the middle of a blistering set at the legendary Stone Pony in Asbury Park. The crowd was bouncing along to a thunderous backbeat and Mahoney — the songwriter, vocalist and guitarist — was blasting his way through another fiery solo on his battered Gibson SG. With fans in a frenzy and the song at a crescendo, he looked back to the Pony’s stage manager and flashed a sweat-drenched, mile-wide grin that said it all in an instant; Bobby Mahoney was exactly where he was meant to be.\n\nIt’s a moment that thousands dream about but few experience, and it’s a moment Bobby Mahoney didn’t arrive at without putting in the work. Bridging the gap between the stereotypical teenage desire and musical reality requires dedication, belief, talent and drive; qualities he’s always had in great supply.\n\nWhen you grow up within earshot of the Jersey Shore, and just a bridge or tunnel away from New York City, inspiration comes in waves. For Mahoney, an East Brunswick, New Jersey native, the music of Springsteen and Bon Jovi mixed seamlessly with Gaslight Anthem, Against Me! and the Menzingers; generating a ground-breaking approach. He wasn’t going to take the time-worn route of jumping into the first band that could manage three-chords and half a dozen songs. Instead he chose the long game. Like the legends who inspired him, he would hone his musicianship and songwriting first, then fuse everything with a punk sensibility to create something innovative, something new.\n\nThe result has led to Mahoney joining the robust roster of New Jersey icon Stevie Van Zandt’s (The Sopranos, Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, Little Steven & The Disciples of Soul) Wicked Cool Records and releasing Another Deadbeat Summer, his first album with the label.\n\nIt’s a record that features road-tested songs sharpened and perfected on tour, with stops in New Orleans, Chicago, Miami, Canada and up and down the Eastern Seaboard. Mahoney has spent the last decade honing his live performance, and his prowess has not gone unnoticed. When he wasn’t blowing the roof off dive bars, college basements and music halls — along with his band, currently consisting of Andrew Saul (guitar), James McIntosh (drums) and Jon Chang Soon (bass) — he was opening for Against Me!, Frank Turner, Bon Jovi and Steve Earle. Most recently, Mahoney played The Continental Club in Austin, TX as part of the Wicked Cool Records Revue for the 2024 South By Southwest festival. Never once did he take those opportunities for granted. He wasn’t just soaking up the adulation of the built-in crowds or moon-facing at his musical mentors. In Mahoney’s own words, “We approach every show as a chance to improve, to learn, and to strengthen our bonds within ourselves and our audiences.“ He was going to school and learning what it takes to get ahead in a business that’s as brutal as it is exhilarating.\n\nThat cutting edge attitude, along with a blue collar work ethic and an education that was born out of a relentless touring schedule has given Bobby Mahoney a creative foundation in song craft and a solid understanding of what it takes to succeed. He has done all of this before hitting 30 years old, and is just getting started. Mahoney’s hard work and growth is paying off on a large scale, proving what it takes to succeed in the cut-throat music business. Another Deadbeat Summer is an album of irrepressible sing-along melodies, runaway-train energy and a nod to songwriters like Fallon and Springsteen.\n\nMahoney is the exception to the rule that reaching the precipice of popularity is only possible by pounding down that same dusty well-worn path. In a world that evolves and changes in microbursts, Bobby Mahoney can turn on a dime, flash that rock and roll smile and reach a place that many only dream about. Sure, it’s where he’s meant to be right now, but just imagine where he’s going.\n\nLine-up:\n\nBobby Mahoney | Guitar, Vocals\n\nJames McIntosh | Drums\n\nAndrew Saul | Guitar, Vocals\n\nJon Chang-Soon | Bass, Vocals\n\nSocials: Facebook / Twitter / Instagram / Website\n\nThomas Nicholas Band Releases New Album “We’re Gonna Be Okay”\n\nThomas Nicholas Band has released his brand new album “We’re Gonna Be Okay” via SBAM Records/Double Helix.\n\nThe album contains features from Less Than Jake, Bowling For Soup, The Early November and more.

Jaret and I wrote a brand new song together and I’ve been holding onto to it for the perfect moment to share it with everyone. This is that moment and subsequently the title of my 7th album.\n\nSimilar to the other collaborations, the similar though line from all of my friends was to write a song about what I’m scared to talk about. This song is directly in line with that concept. I don’t want to talk about these ideas and its scary to open up in that way, but after 30 years of writing music, I’m sharing more vulnerable songs. This is one of my favorite songs that I have ever written. Each time that I have a song like that it always becomes the title track. Each title of my 7 albums represents my favorite song that encapsulates the concept of the record.\n\nJaret is very vocal about mental health and respect how is such an open book. I have not been that way my whole life but I’m learning. I do think it’s important to share our dark thoughts and get them into words. My songs are they way that I’m able to do that and I encourage everyone to do the same. Share your dark thoughts with a trusted person. thoughts are like mountains and putting them into words, they become hills that we can climb. As the song says, “We’re Gonna Be Okay.””\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. TOMORROWS GONNA HURT\n\n02. SAME KIDS\n\n03. BETTER THAN HOME\n\n04. NEVER ENOUGH\n\n05. WRONG SIDE\n\n06. WERE GONNA BE OK\n\n07.

The electrifying trio, composed of multi-talented musicians Aldana Aguirre, Ceci Leon and Vedala Vilmond, wrote and recorded the project at 5020 Studios in Miami.\n\nThe result of “DARUMAS” is irresistibly groovy — listen here! The danceable tracklist explodes with upbeat bops made for experiencing on the live stage, highlighted by their latest “Mago,” a mix of fresh and contagious energy, influenced by funk, Latin pop, and disco, which arrives today too, with a new music video — watch here!\n\nThe first offering from the album is as infectious and funky as the rest, “Daruma,” which introduced the Japanese inspiration behind the DARUMAS band name: a good luck charm that symbolizes perseverance and wish fulfillment. True to their stage name, DARUMAS aims to imbue their music with the same spirit of resilience and positivity that the Daruma embodies. Billboard named it the “The best representation of their project… a soulful R&B bop fused with old-school funk melodies, backing their enchanting and powerful vocals,” while REMEZCLA highlighted the “sounds of vintage disco and funk that beam(s) with big breezy pop chic.”\n\nOverall, the album “Darumas” takes listeners on a joyful but introspective journey. “Coleccionista” is a love song that incorporates elements of classic Latin pop ballads, wrapped in the sensuality of R&B. “Cero de Cien” starts with a powerful bass and bursts into a multidimensional array of sounds, with funk taking center stage. “La Llamada” captures the freshness of today’s Latin pop with intriguing arrangements and a blend of modernity and old-school that characterizes the band. “Candy” offers a languid and sensual contrast to the other tracks, with a solid R&B foundation and elements of trap and rap, plus bilingual lyrics. And “Qué Suerte” features the album’s most intense fusion of funk and Latin pop, where vocal performance and bass rhythm are on display.\n\nDARUMAS celebrates global musicianship, bringing together Aldana, a sought-after bassist from Argentina, who has shared the global stage with acts like Karol G, Luis Fonsi, and Fonseca; Ceci, a vocalist from Miami with Cuban roots and a penchant for R&B, also captivates audiences with her electrifying guitar skills, seamlessly blending soulful melodies with fiery riffs; and Vedala, the mesmerizing voice of the group, hailing from Haiti and living in Chile. The mosaic of their cultural influences and musical styles promises a musical experience like no other.\n\nIn their own words: “Darumas is a band formed by three amazing girls,” Vedala emphasizes. “We are three musicians from different parts of the world” Aldana shares “…and three very different backgrounds” Ceci continues, “that are all inspired by similar music, and trying to create something new with one another.”\n\nThe band is signed with Sony Music Latin for recordings, Walter Kolm Entertainment for management, TBA Agency for touring, and FRAZES CREATIVE for publicity partnerships.\n\nFollow DARUMAS:\n\nInstagram: @darumasband\n\nTwitter: @darumasband\n\nTikTok: @darumasband\n\nFacebook: /darumasband"
