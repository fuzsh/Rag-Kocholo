        "text": "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On MeElton John\n\nRecording \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me,\" Elton John was frustrated and sang the line \"don't discard me\" with an exaggerated American accent, which is why is sounds strange.\n\nWhole Lotta LoveLed Zeppelin\n\n\"Whole Lotta Love\" was Led Zeppelin's only US Top 10 hit, charting at #4. Many of their songs, including \"Stairway To Heaven,\" were not released as singles, as it was considered bad form in the UK to make fans pay for singles that were also on albums.\n\nHash PipeWeezer\n\nMTV wanted Weezer to record a version of their song \"Hash Pipe\" as \"Half Pipe\" to appeal to the skateboarding crowd. The band refused, and MTV listed the song as \"H*** Pipe.\"\n\nNew York, New YorkFrank Sinatra\n\nFrank Sinatra was 64 when he had his last hit: \"New York, New York.\" The song pegged him to New York City, leaving Las Vegas to Elvis.\n\nSunday GirlBlondie\n\n\"Sunday Girl\" was written by Blondie guitarist Chris Stein to cheer up Debbie Harry after her cat had run away whilst they were away on tour. The gray cat was called Sunday Man.\n\nAll The Young DudesMott the Hoople\n\nAll The Young Dudes \"carry the news\" because it was intended for a David Bowie concept album where Ziggy Stardust spreads the news in a world with electricity.\n\nTop American Idol Moments: Songs And ScandalsSong Writing\n\nSurprise exits, a catfight and some very memorable performances make our list of the most memorable Idol moments.\n\nGraham ParkerSongwriter Interviews\n\nWhen Judd Apatow needed under-appreciated rockers for his Knocked Up sequel, he immediately thought of Parker, who just happened to be getting his band The Rumour back together.\n\nBryan AdamsSongwriter Interviews\n\nWhat's the deal with \"Summer of '69\"? Bryan explains what the song is really about, and shares more of his songwriting insights."
