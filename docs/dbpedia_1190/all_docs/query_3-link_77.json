        "text": "CURLYHEADS, riding high on their recent wave of success, have garnered impressive support from industry heavyweights like AC Slater and Sidepiece. With their tracks receiving pick up on Diplo’s Revolution, KISS FM, and ToolRoom Radio, it’s safe to say they are on the rise. Their performances at iconic venues such as Space Miami and Brooklyn Mirage, coupled with their appearances alongside Jake Shore and Corrupt UK, tell one part of the greater story that is still unfolding.\n\nTheir latest release, “WHATCHU GONNA DO?”, pops off from start to finish. The track is a masterful blend of funk and groove, featuring classic disco vocals that captivate instantly. The infectious basslines and lively percussion create an irresistible, uplifting atmosphere. Adding a fresh twist, Smith & Sorren’s remix injects modern tech house elements, seamlessly integrating with CURLYHEADS’ original grooves to produce a track that’s both nostalgic and innovative.\n\nJustin Butensky and Ben Naouai, the creative forces behind CURLYHEADS, began their musical journey in Long Beach, New York, before relocating to Tampa, Florida. Known for their energetic and positive performances, the duo’s unique blend of tech and bass house has resonated with fans far and wide. They are only getting started – follow them on socials to see what they do next, as we can be certain more heaters are on the way!"
