        "text": "Happy Sunday and welcome to more music time travel. Picking six tracks from six different decades and different genres in a random fashion feels very liberating and is my favorite activity each week. With that said, let’s do it again!\n\nNat Adderley/Sister Caroline\n\nToday, our little excursion starts in December 1958 with music from Branching Out, an album by jazz cornetist Nat Adderley. After starting to play the trumpet in 1946 as a 15-year-old, Adderley switched to the cornet in 1950. Together with his older brother, saxophonist Julian “Cannonball” Adderley, he co-founded Cannonball Adderley Quintet in 1956 and frequently played with the group until they disbanded in 1975. Adderley also worked with Kenny Clarke, Wes Montgomery, Walter Booker, Ron Carter and Sonny Fortune, among others, and recorded albums as a leader. Branching Out is an example of the latter. Here’s the great Adderley composition Sister Caroline. He was backed by Johnny Griffin (tenor saxophone) and The Three Sounds: Gene Harris (piano), Andy Simpkins (bass) and Bill Dowdy (drums).\n\nJoe Ely/Fingernails\n\nNext we shall kick it up a few notches with some sizzling honky tonk rock & roll by Texas singer-songwriter and guitarist Joe Ely. Fingernails is a neat song fellow blogger Cincinnati Babyhead, aka. CB, recommended to me the other day. Penned by Ely, the track is from his sophomore album Honky Tonk Masquerade, released in February 1978. Ely is generally classified as country, but his music also includes high-energy blues, rockabilly and honky tonk swing. Fingernails sure as heck ain’t no country!\n\nPretenders/Never Do That\n\nIn May 1990, the fifth album by British-American rock group Pretenders came out, and that’s where we’re headed next. Packed! only pictured bandleader Chrissie Hynde on the cover, which was no coincidence. Together with drummer Blair Cunningham, she was the group’s only remaining member. Cunningham had replaced original drummer Martin Chambers in 1986. Chambers returned in 1993 and has played on all subsequent albums except for 2016’s Alone, a Hynde solo effort released under the Pretenders name. From the aforementioned Packed!, here’s the opener Never Do That, written by Hynde. In general, I think it’s great listening to her, and this song is no exception.\n\nPernice Brothers/Bechamel\n\nTime to pay a visit to the current century with Pernice Brothers. I only learned about this indie rock band last week when I featured a song from their new album Who Will You Believe. The group was formed by Joe Pernice in 1998 after his old group Scud Mountain Boys had broken up. Pernice Brothers who also include Joe’s brother Bob Pernice released their first album Overcome by Happiness in May 1998. Bechamel takes us to the band’s July 2010 album Goodbye, Killer.\n\nCarla Thomas/B-A-B-Y\n\nNow I’m in the mood for some Stax soul and hope so are you. In 1966, the Memphis label released the third album by Carla Thomas. In the summer of 1960, the Queen of Memphis Soul had been the first artist to record a single with her father Rufus Thomas in the new Memphis recording facility of the label, which then was still called Satellite. By the time her third album Carla appeared in 1966, Satellite had changed their name to Stax – the first two letters from the founders’ and siblings’ last names (Jim) Stewart and (Astelle) Axton. The opening track B-A-B-Y, co-written by Isaac Hayes and David Porter, also was released separately as a single in July of that year and became one of Thomas’ hits. My kind of music!\n\nNeil Young/Rockin’ in the Free World\n\nI can’t believe we’re once again at the point where we need to wrap things up. Let’s make it count with a true rock anthem by Neil Young, one of my favorite artists: Rockin’ in the Free World, off his 17th studio album Freedom, which came out in October 1989. Freedom relaunched Young’s career after a largely unsuccessful decade. Undoubtedly, this epic track had something to do with it. I’m talking about the electric version that closes Freedom. An acoustic live version of the same song, which I like as well, opens the album.\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist featuring all of the above tracks, including Neil Young who is back on the platform. As always, I hope there’s something you dig. See ya!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nDan Auerbach first entered my radar screen in April 2020 when I reviewed southern guitarist Marcus King’s soulful debut album El Dorado, which was produced by Auerbach. At the time, I didn’t realize yet how prolific the now 44-year-old musician, singer-songwriter and producer is. Between two solo albums, his involvement in The Black Keys and various side projects, as well as his record engineering and production work, Auerbach has had his fingerprints on more than 90 albums to date! In this post, I’d like to primarily focus on his activity as a producer.\n\nDan Auerbach (born Daniel Quine Auerbach, May 14, 1979) was born in Ohio and grew up in a family who exposed him to a variety of music during his childhood. Reportedly, his first concert experience was a Whitney Houston show where his mother took him; his second a Grateful Dead concert, thanks to his dad who also got the boy hooked to the blues via his vinyl collection. Auerbach’s uncles liked bluegrass.\n\nAround the age of 9, Auerbach started playing guitar. While attending high school in Akron, Ohio, he became friends with his future Black Keys partner and drummer Patrick Carney. The two had first met when there were 8 or 9 and lived in the same neighborhood. In 1986, they began jamming together. Eventually, this led to the formation of The Black Keys after both had dropped out of college.\n\nDuring college, Auerbach was heavily influenced by blues guitarist Junior Kimbrough, leading him to drop out, so he could focus on his guitar-playing. Other major influences include the likes of Robert Johnson, R.L. Burnside and Hound Dog Taylor, as well as artists outside the blues, such as bluegrass and country singer Clarence White and rapper RZA.\n\nThe Black Keys released their debut album The Big Come Up in 2002, but it wasn’t until 2004 and their third album Rubber Factory that they were started to get noticed. A couple of years later, Auerbach began recording, engineering and producing for other artists, using downtime from The Black Keys. He also opened his own recording studio in Akron.\n\nBy the time The Black Keys hit their commercial breakthrough in 2010 with their sixth album Brothers, Auerbach had already worked on more than 15 albums for other artists. Some of his projects during this period included garage punk band SSM, blues rock musician Patrick Sweany and garage rock revival band The Ettes. In 2009, Auerbach also launched The Fast Five, a side project with Carney and members from the bands Hacienda and My Morning Jacket. Somehow, Auerbach also managed to release his debut album Keep It Hid in February 2009!\n\nAfter Auerbach moved to Nashville in 2010, he established Easy Eye Sound studio there. In 2015, he launched garage rock band The Arcs, another side project. They released their debut album Yours, Dreamily in September of the same year. And, he also co-produced it, together with band member and multi-instrumentalist Leon Michels. Two years later, Auerbach founded his own label in Nashville, naming it after his recording studio. The first album that appeared on Easy Eye Sound was Auerbach’s second solo effort, Waiting On a Song, in June 2017.\n\nThis may be hard to believe. I’m in the eighth paragraph of this post, and I feel I’ve only provided a topline summary of Auerbach’s extensive bio. I wonder whether he ever sleeps or takes any other breaks! Let’s take a closer look at some of his work as a producer.\n\nBlack Diamond Heavies, a blues rock band from Nashville, turned to Auerbach for their sophomore album A Touch of Someone Else’s Class, released in June 2008. It was recorded at his studio in Akron, and he also served as producer. Here’s Bidin’ My Time featuring Auerbach’s Black Keys partner Patrick Carney on drums.\n\nIn April 2012, New Orleans R&B artist Dr. John released Locked Down, a well received studio album produced by Auerbach, which won the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Blues Album. It was mixed by him and recorded at Easy Eye Sound studio. Auerbach also co-wrote the songs and played guitar. Here’s Getaway.\n\nIn May 2014, outlaw country singer-songwriter Nikki Lane released her sophomore album All or Nothin’. It was recorded at Easy Eye Sound and produced by Auerbach who also co-wrote five of the 12 tracks, and shared vocals with Lane on one of them. “Working with Dan and his professionalism on top of his creative capabilities is so great,” Lane told Billboard in July 2014. “To watch him bring together such a wide variety of artists – legends like Kenny Vaughan, who is such a guitar bad ass, and Russ Pahl [pedal steel guitar – CMM]. Just watching him work with all those people, is such an inspirational experience.” Here’s the opener Right Time.\n\nIn 2016, Auerbach worked with Chrissie Hynde on what became the 10th studio album by Pretenders. At that time, the English-American rock group had become a project of Hynde with her as the sole member. Appropriately titled Alone, the album was recorded at Easy Eye Sound and produced by Auerbach. The session musicians, among others, included Arcs members Leon Michels (keyboards) and Richard Swift (drums). Auerbach also co-wrote two songs and provided guitar, keyboards and backing vocals. Hynde was very complimentary about Auerbach, telling the Akron Beacon Journal, “He’s very involved and dedicated to it, and he has just stellar ideas and his instincts are good.” Here’s the title track.\n\nNext I’d like to turn to British singer-songwriter Yola, who blends vintage country, soul and R&B with contemporary pop, and her compelling debut album Walk Through Fire, which I reviewed here. It was recorded at Easy Eye Sound, produced by Auerbach and released on his label (with distribution by Nonsuch Records). He was also involved in the writing of most songs and assembled an impressive cast of session musicians and guests. The latter included Vince Gill and Molly Tuttle who contributed vocals. Here’s the tasty Love All Night (Work All Day).\n\nI’d like to wrap it up with Black Bayou, the fourth full-length album by blues and soul singer-songwriter and guitarist Robert Finley, released in October 2023 on Auerbach’s label and produced by him. Finley and Auerbach had first met in 2017 when they worked together and released an original soundtrack for the graphic novel Murder Ballads. Auerbach had also produced Finley’s two albums that preceded Black Bayou. Once again, Auerbach played a key role in the songwriting on Finley’s latest album, which was well received by critics. Let’s listen to What Goes Around (Comes Around).\n\nTo date, Easy Eye Sound has released more than 20 albums that have received 16 Grammy nominations, according to a short profile on the website of Concord Records, which entered into a joint venture with Auerbach’s label in 2021. The profile also quotes Auerbach: “Because I’ve lived many aspects of a musician’s life, I have a unique connection to my artists, and I channel that into this label and studio to record and share with musicians that inspire me. I look for honest and overlooked voices and stories and try to shine some light on them.”\n\nWell, Auerbach certainly has a long and impressive track record, especially when considering he’s only 44 years! Following is a Spotify playlist that features the above songs and others produced by Auerbach except for music he produced for himself, The Black Keys or any of his side projects.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; Billboard; Akron Beacon Journal; Concord Records website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Sunday! In case you’ve been celebrating the holidays and perhaps feel a bit exhausted between indulging in food and drink and gatherings with family and friends, I’d like to offer you a great remedy just in time before the new year: Come and join me for the final music time travel trip of 2023! If none of the aforementioned applies to you, hop on board of the magical music time machine anyway. We’re gonna have a lot of fun!\n\nThe Charles Owens Trio/Best Part\n\nThis time, our little excursion starts in the present with contemporary jazz by The Charles Owens Trio. His web bio notes Owens is a master tenor saxophonist, composer, band leader, recording artist, and educator and has been performing, composing, and teaching for over 25 years…He has made 9 albums as a leader and appeared and continues to appear on a plethora of recordings as a hired soloist. He’s performed with such jazz luminaries as Brad Mehldau, Mark Turner, Omer Avital, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Brian Blade, Peter Bernstein, Larry Goldings, Ari Hoenig, Alexander Claffy, Jeff Watts, and Joel Frahm among many others. Off his latest album Here It Is, released earlier this month on Dec 8, here’s Best Part. Owens is backed by Andrew Jay Randazzo (hybrid guitar) and DJHarrison RVA (drums).\n\nBob Dylan/Man of Peace\n\nAfter what may have been a smoother opening than what you anticipated based on the slightly creepy album cover, let’s pay a visit to Bob Dylan. To borrow from a famous mid-’90s movie, the brilliant master is like a box of chocolate – you never know what you gonna get! After Dylan’s conversion to Christianity and three evangelical records, he returned to secular music on his brilliant 22nd studio album Infidels, which came out in October 1993. The album, co-produced by Dylan and then-Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler, who also played guitar on it, was well received by fans and critics alike. Other musicians on Infidels included Dire Straits’ Alan Clark (keyboards), Mick Taylor (guitar), Benmont Tench (keyboards), Robbie Shakespeare (bass) and his Sly and Robbie partner Sly Dunbar – that’s what I call a neat backing band! Here’s Man of Peace.\n\nThe Everly Brothers/Wake Up Little Susie\n\nOur next stop takes us back to Sep 1957 and the second big hit by The Everly Brothers. Wake Up Little Susie was penned by husband and wife songwriting team Felice Bryant and Diadorius Boudleaux Bryant. They also gave the duo of Don Everly and his younger brother Phil Everly their first big hit with Bye Bye Love. Wake Up Little Susie, first released as a single, did even better, topping the pop charts in the U.S., Canada and Australia and surging to no. 2 in the UK. Both songs were also included on The Everly Brothers’ eponymous debut album released in January 1958. Amazing harmony singing and a captivating groove make for my kind kind of combo!\n\nPretenders/I’ll Stand By You\n\nTime to pay a visit to the ’90s with a great song by Pretenders: I’ll Stand By You, off their sixth studio album Last of the Independents, which appeared in May 1994. At that time, the English-American rock band already had seen significant changes, leaving frontwoman Chrissie Hynde (guitar, vocals) and Martin Chambers (drums) as the only remaining original members. Adam Seymour (guitar) and Andy Hobson (bass) were still new to the group. Notably, the entire line-up only recorded one song, while for the remaining tracks Hynde relied on Seymour and a rotating series of musicians on bass and drums. There’s no doubt who ran that band and still fearlessly does to this day! I’ll Stand By You was written by Hynde, along with songwriting partners Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. Not only does this ballad sound beautiful, but Hynde once again proves what an outstanding vocalist she is!\n\nIron Butterfly/In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\n\nFor our next stop, take a deep breath for a psychedelic rock tour de force from June 1968. That’s when American group Iron Butterfly released their sophomore album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Peaking at no. 4 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200, the album sold an incredible more than 8 million copies within just its first year of release – outselling every record in the history of recorded music to that time! Eventually, it would rake up worldwide sales of more than 30 million. Here’s the epic title track, which at 17:05 minutes occupied all of side two. It was written by co-founder Doug Ingle (Vox Continental organ, vocals). The strange title reportedly came to be when Iron Butterfly drummer Ron Bushy misinterpreted the words “In the Garden of Eden” when writing down the lyrics for Ingle who was drunk and slurred the words as he sang the song to Bushy. Well, it was the late ’60s!\n\nGram Parsons/Ooh Las Vegas\n\nAfter all that brilliant weirdness, I hope you’re still with me! If yes, congratulations, we’re getting to the final stop of today’s trip. For this, let’s set the time controls of the magical music machine to January 1974, which saw the release of the second and final studio album by Gram Parsons. Sadly, by the time it came out, Parsons already had died from an overdose of morphine and alcohol. He was only 26! Grievous Angel was compiled from recording sessions that had taken place in the summer of 1973. They prominently featured his singing partner Emmylou Harris and other prominent guests, such as Linda Ronstadt and Bernie Leadon, co-founder of the Eagles. Here’s the incredible Ooh Las Vegas.\n\nOf course, this post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist featuring the above tracks. I also would like to take this opportunity to thank of all my readers for reading and commenting and wish everybody a Happy New Year! If you’re out there celebrating, please be safe. Peace and Love!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Charles Owens website; YouTube; Spotify\n\nWhile this supplementary feature to my weekly new music reviews was never designed to run on a regular basis, it’s been more than four months since the last installment. The reason for the long gap certainly is not that I was caught up on new releases in the meantime. Recently, it occurred to me I completely missed the latest albums by Pretenders and Graham Parker, both of which came out in September – certainly a good reason for another Catching Up post!\n\nPretenders – Relentless\n\nThe English-American rock band around songwriter, lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Chrissie Hynde, who I trust doesn’t need much of an introduction, has been around since 1978. The group’s current line-up also features James Walbourne (backing vocals, guitar, bass and various other instruments) with whom Hynde wrote all songs; Carwyn Ellis (guitar, keyboards); and Kris Sonne (drums). Chris Hill and Dave Page provided bass on select tracks.\n\nRelentless, out since September 15, only is the group’s 12th studio album. But Hynde has been busy on other fronts. Since 2014, she has released three solo albums. Prior to that, in 2010, she teamed up for an album with Welsh singer J.P. Jones, Fidelity, billed as J.P., Chrissie and the Fairground Boys.\n\nJust like on Hate for Sale, the previous album by Pretenders I reviewed here, Hynde who turned 72 on September 7 remains a compelling vocalist. Based on my initial impression, the songs are pretty good as well. Here’s Let the Sun Come In, one of my early favorites.\n\nOther tracks I’d like to call out are opener Losing My Sense of Taste, A Love, Domestic Silence and I Think About You Daily. The last song features strings composed and conducted by Jonny Greenwood, lead guitarist and keyboarder of Radiohead.\n\nGraham Parker & The Goldtops – Last Chance to Learn the Twist\n\nEnglish singer-songwriter Graham Parker has been active since the early ’70s and starting with his 1976 debut Howlin’ Wind has released more than 20 albums to date. Best known as Graham Parker & The Rumour, Parker has also put out albums as Graham Parker & The Shot, Graham Parker & The Figgs, Graham Parker & The Goldtops and under his own name only. Parker preceded Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson, two other artists who emerged from the British pub rock scene he’s often compared to.\n\nParker’s latest album, Last Chance to Learn the Twist, appeared on September 8 and is billed to Graham Parker & The Goldtops. It marks his first new studio effort since 2018’s Cloud Symbols, which he also released with The Goldtops. Apart from Parker (guitar, harmonica), core members of the band include Martin Belmont (guitar), Geraint Watkins (keyboards), Simon Edwards (bass, Mini Moog, vocals) and Jim Russell (drums, percussion).\n\nWhile my knowledge of Parker’s music is limited and, as such, I cannot make well informed comparisons to his previous album, my first impression of Last Chance to Learn the Twist is quite positive and certainly wants me to further explore his catalog. Here’s the opener The Music of the Devil.\n\nOther tracks I immediately liked include Sun Valley, It Mattered to Me, Pablo’s Hippos and We Did Nothing.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; YouTube; Spotify\n\nSunday is fun day and I hope this weekend has been going well for you thus far. Perhaps to make it even better, once again, I’d like to invite you to join me on another trip through space and time to visit music of the past and the present century. The magical time machine is ready to take off so hop on board, fasten to seatbelt and off we go!\n\nStan Getz and João Gilberto/The Girl From Ipanema (feat. Astrud Gilberto)\n\nOur first stop today is March 1964 and a timeless Brazilian jazz gem. Sadly, this pick isn’t coincidental. On Monday (June 5), Brazilian samba and bossa nova singer-songwriter Astrud Gilberto (born Astrud Evangelina Weinert) passed away at the age of 83. I think it’s safe to say she’s best remembers for her vocals on The Girl From Ipanema, which was first released in 1963. Subsequently, the tune also appeared on Getz/Gilberto, a studio album by American saxophonist Stan Getz and Brazilian guitarist João Gilberto, who married Astrud in late 1959. The Girl From Ipanema, which became a worldwide hit in the mid’60s and won a 1965 Grammy for Record of the Year, was written in 1962, with music by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Portuguese lyrics by Vinícius de Moraes. Norman Gimbel later penned English lyrics – an exceptionally beautiful tune!\n\nJonathan Wilson/Moses Pain\n\nNext, we shall travel to the current century, more specifically to October 2013. That’s when singer-songwriter and producer Jonathan Wilson released a solo studio album titled Fanfare. Once again, I have to thank my longtime German music buddy who in late January recommended that I check out Wilson. I did and first featured him in a previous Sunday Six installment. Similar to Wilson’s previous album Gentle Spirit (September 2011), Fanfare included collaborations with various other artists. Moses Pain featured Mike Campbell (guitar) and Benmont Tench (piano), from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, as well as Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Josh Tillman and Jenny O. on backing vocals.\n\nThe Pretenders/My Baby\n\nEnglish-American rock band The Pretenders, who since their fifth studio album Packed! (1990) have been known as Pretenders, probably need no introduction. The group around frontwoman and main songwriter Chrissie Hynde, their only constant member over the decades, had a series of successful albums starting in the late ’70s to the mid-’90s. My Baby, written by Hynde, is a track off their fourth studio album Get Close, released in October 1986. Together with Don’t Get Me Wrong, My Baby holds the distinction of having been the band’s only no. 1 in the U.S. on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock chart – love this tune!\n\nEddie Cochran/Summertime Blues\n\nNow the time has come to visit the ’50s and one of the early pioneers of rock & roll: Eddie Cochran. Not only did his songs capture teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s, but he also experimented with multitrack recording, distortion techniques and overdubbing, even on his earliest singles! Summertime Blues, which I knew first because of The Who’s dynamite rendition, is among Cockran’s best-known tunes. It also became his highest-charting single in the U.S. in 1958, peaking at no. 8 on the pop chart. It also became Cochran’s most successful single in the UK where it climbed to no. 18. What an infectious tune!\n\nBlue Rodeo/Lost Together\n\nHow about paying a visit to the rodeo? No, not one where they ride bulls. I’m talking about Blue Rodeo, a Canadian country rock band I’ve come to dig. Formed in Toronto in 1984, Blue Rodeo, among others, have released 16 full-length studio albums to date. I reviewed their most recent, Many a Mile (December 2021), here and have also covered them on various other previous occasions. Lost Together is the terrific title track of their fourth studio album, which came out in August 1992. Like all other songs on the album, it was penned by the group’s co-founders Jim Cuddy (vocals, guitar) and Greg Keelor (vocals, guitar), who together with bassist Bazil Donovan remain the three original members in Blue Rodeo’s current line-up.\n\nDeep Purple/Smoke On the Water\n\nCanadian wildfires and resulting smoke have been very much in the news throughout the week, so in case you don’t love this final pick on this music trip you’ll have to forgive me. Having been impacted by hazy conditions that turned my neck of the woods into a post-apocalyptic-looking landscape, somehow, Smoke On the Water just came to me.\n\nUndoubtedly a nightmare of every employee who works in a store selling electric guitars you can try out, Smoke On the Water, dare I say it, may well be the ultimate hard tune by what I still consider the ultimate hard rock band: Deep Purple. The must-learn tune for every electric guitarist with that iconic riff first appeared in March 1972 on the English group’s sixth studio album Machine Head. It also became the fourth single in May 1973 and arguably Purple’s signature song. Yes, Smoke On the Water hasn’t exactly suffered from obscurity, but to me, it still remains a hell of a tune! Like the six remaining tracks, it was credited to all members: Ian Gillan (vocals, harmonica), Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Jon Lord (keyboards, Hammond organ), Roger Glover (bass) and Ian Paice – the best line-up this band ever had!\n\nLast but least, here’s a Spotify playlist of the above goodies. So, wadda’ll think?\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nWhile my music history series is an irregular feature, this time, I did not want to wait for another 10 weeks before putting together the next installment. Plus, May 4 turned out to be a date I had not covered yet. As always, this content reflects my music taste and is not meant to present a full accounting of events.\n\n1956: Rockabilly and early rock & roll pioneer Gene Vincent recorded what would become his signature song at Owen Bradley’s studio in Memphis, Tenn.: Be-Bop-a-Lula. Vincent wrote the music in 1955 at US Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Va. while recuperating from a motorcycle accident. The song is also credited to his manager Bill “Sheriff Tex” Davis who claimed he wrote it together with Vincent. Another version is the lyrics were penned by Donald Graves who Vincent met at the hospital and Davis subsequently bought out his rights to the tune. To make things even more confusing, in yet another version, Vincent maintained he came up with the tune’s words, which were inspired by a comic strip called Little Lulu. What is undisputed is that once released in June 1956, Be-Bop-a-Lula became Vincent’s biggest hit in both the U.S. and the UK, peaking at no. 7 and no. 16, respectively.\n\n1967: The Young Rascals (who later became known as just The Rascals) reached the top of the U.S. pop charts with Groovin’, the title track of their third studio album released in July of the same year. The tune was co-written by band members Felix Cavaliere (lead and backing vocals, keyboards) and Eddie Brigati (backing and lead vocals, percussion). Gene Cornish (guitar, harmonica, backing and lead vocals, bass) and Dino Danelli (drums) completed the group who were still in their original lineup. Groovin’, their second big hit after Good Lovin’ (February 1965), reflected Cavaliere’s newfound interest in Afro-Cuban music. The tune featured a conga and a Cuban-influenced bassline played by prominent session musician Chuck Rainey, one of the most recorded bass players who also worked with the likes of Aretha Franklin, Steely Dan and Quincy Jones. Groovin’ also became The Young Rascals’ highest-charting single in the UK (no. 8) and Australia (no. 3).\n\n1970: A peace rally at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio against the U.S. incursion into Cambodia ended in what became known as the May 4 massacre or the Kent State massacre. After more than 300 students had gathered on campus to protest the expansion of the Vietnam war, 28 National Guard soldiers emerged and fired tear gas at the crowd, followed by about 67 rounds of bullets over 13 seconds, killing four students and wounding nine others. Unbeknownst to the protesters, Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes had stationed the National Guard on campus and declared martial law, superseding First Amendment rights and making any assembly illegal. Among the protesters was Jerry Casale who subsequently became a co-founder of the band Devo. Another student who was there that day decided to drop out of school, work as a waitress for a while and eventually head to England to form a rock band. Her name: Chrissie Hynde, of the Pretenders. But the most immediate outcome of the May 4 massacre was the song Ohio, written by Neil Young, and released as a single by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in the wake of the shooting.\n\n1987: Prominent blues harmonica player and vocalist Paul Butterfield, best known as the founder and leader of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, died from a drug overdose in his Los Angeles apartment at age 44. Butterfield formed the Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 1963. Between 1965 and 1971, they released a series of studio and live albums. After their breakup in 1971, Butterfield formed a new group, the short-lived Paul Butterfield’s Better Days, who put out two albums. Afterward, Butterfield launched a solo career. In 1986, he released his final studio album, The Legendary Paul Butterfield Rides Again, an unsuccessful comeback attempt with an updated rock sound. Butterfield’s physical and financial condition started to deteriorate in the early ’80s after he became addicted to heroin, a possible attempt to ease symptoms from serious and painful intestinal inflammation. Here’s Paul Butterfield Blues Band’s rendition of Robert Johnson’s Walkin’ Blues, off their sophomore album East-West, featuring guitarist Mike Bloomfield.\n\n1991: Texas Governor Ann Richards declared ZZ Top day in the Lone Star State. According to an article in the Deseret News, which weirdly is a Utah paper, Richards led a Capitol ceremony honoring the Houston-based rock band, which ended its 120-city “Recycler” tour in Austin Friday.”You’ve heard me talk an awful lot about how proud Texas is of its music industry,” Richards said. “I can’t think of a group better than ZZ Top.” While setlist.fm doesn’t include ZZ Top’s above-noted May 3, 1991 Austin gig, it lists their show in Lubbock, Texas the night before – close enough! Here’s one of the tunes they played, Concrete and Steel, the opener of Recycler, their 10th studio album released in October 1990 – sounds like it was inspired by Sharp Dressed Man.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts Music Calendar; This Day In Music; Deseret News; Setlist.fm; YouTube\n\nHappy humpday and welcome to another installment of my weekly feature that takes a deeper dive on a tune I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all so far. Today’s pick is Don’t Get Me Wrong by Pretenders who at the time they released the song were still known as The Pretenders.\n\nPenned by co-founder, lead vocalist and guitarist Chrissie Hynde, who has been the band’s primary songwriter since their formation in 1978, Don’t Get Me Wrong first appeared in August 1986 as the lead single of the group’s fourth studio album Get Close, which came out in October of the same year.\n\nIn the U.S., Don’t Get Me Wrong peaked at no. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the band’s last big hit on the pop chart. It also topped Billboard’s Mainstream Rock chart. Elsewhere, the single climbed to no. 8 in Australia, no. 10 in the UK, no. 11 in New Zealand, no. 14 in Canada and no. 25 in The Netherlands.\n\nThe album Get Close also did pretty well, reaching no. 6 in the UK and Sweden, no. 9 in Canada, no. 12 in Australia, no. 13 in New Zealand, no. 18 in Norway, no. 22 in The Netherlands and Switzerland, and no. 25 in the U.S. It reached Gold certification in the U.S. (0.5 million certified sold units) and the UK (100,000 certified sold units). This places Get Close within the group’s five most successful albums.\n\nBy the time Don’t Get Me Wrong and Get Close were released, Chrissie Hynde was the band’s only remaining original member. Co-founder James Honeyman-Scott (guitar) was found dead of cocaine-induced heart failure in June 1982, two days after original bassist Pete Farndon had been dismissed from The Pretenders. Farndon drowned in his bath in April 1983 after he had lost consciousness due to a heroin overdose. Honeyman-Scott and Farndon only were 25 and 30 years, respectively. Drummer Martin Chambers, whose enthusiasm was significantly impacted by the two deaths, left during the Get Close recording sessions. He rejoined the group in 1994.\n\nIn addition to Hynde (vocals, rhythm guitar), The Pretenders at the time of Get Close also included Robbie McIntosh (guitars), T.M. Stevens (bass) and Blair Cunningham (drums, percussion). Hynde, the band’s only constant member throughout its 40-plus-year existence, and Chambers remain part of the current line-up, which also features James Walbourne (lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Eric Heywood (pedal steel guitar, backing vocals) and Nick Wilkinson (bass, backing vocals).\n\nFollowing are additional insights from Songfacts:\n\nWritten by Pretenders lead singer Chrissie Hynde, this song describes the complexities of love from a female perspective – she’s inconsistent, but wonderful, and wants her lover to know that he shouldn’t get too worked up, because she could change quickly. Hynde put a lot of weather references in the lyrics, implying that her mood reacts in a similar fashion...\n\n…Chrissie Hynde wrote the song for tennis star John McEnroe, who was an aspiring musician. “He loved playing guitar,” she told Uncle Joe Benson on the Ultimate Classic Rock Nights radio show. “He’s a big music person, which is how I knew him, because he used to come to our shows and he was friendly with the band and stuff.”\n\nHynde added that she found inspiration while aboard a plane. “I had in mind that I was going to write this song for him to do. Years later, when I was on British [Airways], I heard an announcement – because I did write some of that song on a plane – and I think I nicked one of the top-line melodies from the overhead announcement: ‘Dong-dong-dong-dong … Welcome to British Airways.'”\n\nThe music video is based on the spy series The Avengers, which aired in Britain in the ’60s and was an influence on the Austin Powers movies. Most of the video is actual footage from the series, which starred Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, interspersed with shots of Chrissie Hynde as Rigg’s character. With their videos, the Pretenders made no attempts to appeal to the core MTV demographic of American teenage boys.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube\n\nGood morning (in my part of the woods, New Jersey, USA), good afternoon, good evening, wherever you are – welcome to another Sunday Six! If you’re a frequent traveler, you know what’s about to unfold. For first-time visitors, I hope you stick around to join me and others on a new excursion into the great world of music, six tunes at a time. Off we go!\n\nNat Adderley/Work Song\n\nToday, our trip starts in 1960 with music by jazz musician Nat Adderley, who became best known for playing the cornet, a brass instrument similar to a trumpet. After starting to play the trumpet in 1946 as a 15-year-old, Adderley switched to the cornet in 1950. Together with his older brother, saxophonist Julian “Cannonball” Adderley, he co-founded Cannonball Adderley Quintet in 1956 and frequently worked with the group until its dissolution in 1975, following the death of his older brother. In addition to playing bebop, Cannonball Adderley Quintet became known for starting the soul jazz genre. Adderly also worked with Kenny Clarke, Wes Montgomery, Walter Booker, Ron Carter and Sonny Fortune, among others. Nat Adderley passed away in January 2000 at the age of 68 due to complications from diabetes. Work Song, composed by Adderley and Oscar Brown Jr., is the title track of an album Adderley released in 1960. The tune features Adderley (cornet), Montgomery (guitar), Bobby Timmons (piano), Percy Heath (bass) and Louis Hayes (drums). Groovy stuff but not too aggressive – perfect music to start a Sunday morning!\n\nJohn Hiatt/Shredding the Document\n\nThe more I listen to John Hiatt, the more I dig the man! While Hiatt has written songs for 50-plus years and recorded close to 30 albums, his tunes oftentimes became hits for other artists. Perhaps the most prominent examples are Thing Called Love and Have a Little Faith in Me, which became hits for Bonnie Raitt and Joe Cocker, respectively. Hiatt’s songs have also been covered by an impressive and diverse array of other artists like B.B. King, Bob Dylan, Buddy Guy, Emmylou Harris, Joan Baez, Linda Ronstadt, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and Willy DeVille. Shredding the Document, penned by Hiatt, is from Walk On, an album released in October 1995. Peaking at no. 48 on the Billboard 200, it ranks among his better performing records on the U.S. mainstream chart. Walk On did best in Belgium and Sweden, where it climbed to no. 10 and no. 13, respectively.\n\nJames Brown/The Boss\n\nNext, let’s get funky with James Brown and The Boss, a tune from Black Cesar, the soundtrack album for the blaxploitation crime drama motion picture of the same name. The Boss was co-written by Brown, Charles Bobbit and Fred Wesley. The album and the film were released in February 1973. While reactions were mixed among music critics, Black Cesar peaked at no. 31 on the Billboard 200, making it Brown’s second highest-charting album on the U.S. pop chart in the ’70s. I love the guitar work on this tune. The lush horns give it a true ’70s feel.\n\nYes/Owner of a Lonely Heart\n\nOn to the ’80s and the biggest hit by English progressive rock band Yes: Owner of a Lonely Heart. After the group had disbanded in 1981, original co-founder Chris Squire (bass) and Alan White (drums) who had joined Yes in 1972 formed Cinema in January 1982, together with guitarist and singer-songwriter Trevor Rabin and original Yes keyboarder Tony Kaye. In November 1982, they started work on an album with a more pop-oriented sound. During the mixing stage, former Yes vocalist Jon Anderson joined Cinema, which subsequently became the new line-up of Yes. The album was titled 90125, after its catalog number of record label Atco. Owner of a Lonely Heart, written primarily by Rabin with contributions from Anderson, Squire and producer Trevor Horn, topped the Billboard Hot 100. Elsewhere, it climbed to no. 2 in The Netherlands, no. 14 in Australia, no. 28 in the UK and no. 30 in Ireland. 90125 became the group’s best-selling album, reaching 3x Platinum certification in the U.S., 2X Platinum in Canada, Platinum in Germany and Gold in the UK and France. Today, Yes (featuring longtime guitarist Steve Howe) are embarking on a U.S. tour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their fifth studio album Close to the Edge. While Owner of a Lonely Heart has a commercial ’80s sound, it’s an awesome tune!\n\nPretenders/Alone\n\nI trust the English-American rock band The Pretenders (known as Pretenders since 1990) don’t need much of an introduction. The group was formed in March 1978 and originally included Chrissie Hynde (lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar, harmonica), James Honeyman-Scott (lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), Pete Farndon (bass, backing vocals) and Martin Chambers (drums, backing vocals, percussion). By the time the 10th album Alone was released in October 2016, Hynde was literally alone as the only remaining member. She relied on session musicians to record the album, essentially mirroring the same approach Hynde took once before, in 1990 for Packed!, the fifth album that appeared under the band’s name – the first released as Pretenders. Today, the group has a full line-up, with Chambers back in the fold. Here’s the defiant title track of Alone – I love Hynde’s feisty lyrics, which are a perfect match for the raw sound!\n\nThe Fuzztones/Barking Up the Wrong Tree\n\nAnd once again we’ve arrived at our final destination, which takes us back to the present. This past April, American garage rock revival band The Fuzztones put out their latest studio release. Encore is “a collection of unreleased tracks packaged together as a way to say thank you to the faithful who have followed and supported the band through the years,” Tinnitist reported at the time. The Fuzztones were originally formed by singer and guitarist Rudi Protrudi in New York in 1982, who remains the only original member. Since their 1985 debut Lysergic Emanations, they have released eight additional albums including Encore. Barking Up The Wrong Tree, written by Protrudi, is the only original song. The other six tracks are covers of tunes by Rare Earth, The Wildwood and others. Fuzzy garage rock – I love that sound!\n\nOf course, this post wouldn’t be complete with a Spotify playlist of the above songs. Hope there’s something you dig.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Yes website; Tinnitist; YouTube; Spotify\n\nWelcome to Sunday and another installment of The Sunday Six, a journey celebrating music six random tunes at a time. If you’re impacted by tropical storm Henri, I hope you are safe. My area of Central New Jersey has been under a tropical storm warning since Friday afternoon, but other than rain, so far, so good -knock on wood!\n\nWeather Report/A Remark You Made\n\nThe fact I’m kicking off this post with jazz fusion group Weather Report has nothing to do with the storm but instead can be attributed to coincidence. A few days ago, my streaming music provider served up A Remark You Made as a listening suggestion. While jazz fusion remains a largely unknown genre to me, this track blew me away immediately. Appearing on Weather Report’s eighth studio album Heavy Weather from March 1977, the tune undoubtedly has to be one of the most beautiful instrumentals I’ve heard in a long time. Written by Austrian jazz keyboarder and Weather Report co-founder Joe Zawinul, the track also features Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone), Jaco Pastorious (fretless bass) and Alex Acuña (drums). What matters more to me than all these big names is the incredible music, especially Pastorious who literally makes his fretless bass sing – check out that amazing tone! As a huge saxophone fan, I’m also drawn to Shorter’s tenor sax playing – just incredibly beautiful and a perfect match to the singing fretless bass! I realize this very accessible jazz fusion isn’t typical for the genre. Perhaps not surprisingly, Heavy Weather became Weather Report’s highest charting album on the U.S. mainstream chart Billboard 200 where it peaked at no. 30. It also was one of the group’s two records to top Billboard’s jazz albums chart.\n\nJoe Jackson/Geraldine and John\n\nLet’s stay in the ’70s and move to October 1979. Joe Jackson’s sophomore album I’m the Man brought the versatile British artist on my radar screen in 1980, when I received it on vinyl as a present for my 14th birthday – still have that copy. The album is probably best known for its singles I’m the Man, It’s Different for Girls and Kinda Cute, while the song I picked, Geraldine and John, is more of a deeper but nevertheless great cut. And it’s another bassist who absolutely shines on that tune, in my view: Graham Maby. He still plays with Jackson to this day. Rounding up Jackson’s backing band were guitarist Gary Sanford and drummer David Houghton. Jackson worked with them on his first three albums that are among my favorites by the man. Check out Maby’s great melodic bassline on Geraldine and John!\n\nThe Beatles/Something\n\nSpeaking of great basslines, here’s yet another master bassist who conveniently also played in my favorite band of all time. Not only is Something from the Abbey Road album among the absolute gems written by George Harrison, but I think it’s also The Beatles tune with the best bassline Paul McCartney has ever come up with. In addition to Harrison (vocals, lead guitar) and McCartney (bass, backing vocals), the tune featured John Lennon (piano), Ringo Starr (drums) and Billy Preston (Hammond). BTW, Something is also a good example of Ringo’s creative drumming. The Beatles Bible notes the song was recorded and mixed during six sessions between April 16 and August 15, 1969. At this late stage of The Beatles when they took full advantage of the studio, McCartney oftentimes recorded his bass as one of the last instruments. That way he could hear all other instrumental tracks and come up with complementary basslines. In this case, the outcome was truly magnificent!\n\nSheryl Crow/If It Makes You Happy\n\nOkay, time to get off my little bass obsession – something I admittedly can get excited about as a former bassist! On to Sheryl Crow, an artist I have dug since her debut album Tuesday Night Music Club from 1993. Oh, did I mention she also plays bass in addition to guitar and piano? 🙂 Perhaps my favorite tune by Crow is If It Makes You Happy from her eponymous sophomore album that came out in September 1996. She co-wrote the nice rocker with Jeff Trott who became a longtime collaborator and appeared on almost every Sheryl Crow album thereafter. In August 2019, Crow released what she said would be her final full-length album, Threads, citing changed music consumption habits where most listeners make their own playlists with cherry-picked songs rather than listening to entire albums. I previously reviewed it here. Well, the good news is Crow’s statement at the time apparently didn’t include live albums. On August 13, she released Live From The Ryman & More, a great looking 27-track career spanning set I’ve yet to check out. Meanwhile, here’s the excellent If It Makes You Happy. Yep, it surely does!\n\nNeil Young/Hangin’ On a Limb\n\nNext I like to come back to Hangin’ On a Limb, a Neil Young tune I first had planned to include in the August 1 Sunday Six installment. But inspired by a tornado warning that had been issued for my area of central New Jersey a few days earlier, I decided to go with Like a Hurricane instead. BTW, earlier this week, we had another tornado warning and as noted above, there is a tropical storm warning in effect for my area. You can’t make this stuff up – climate change is real, whether the naysayers like it or not! Anyway, Hangin’ On a Limb is a beautiful tune featuring Linda Ronstadt on backing vocals. It’s from Young’s 17th studio album Freedom that appeared in October 1989 and is best known for the epic Rockin’ in the Free World.\n\nPretenders/Buzz\n\nAnd this brings me again to the final tune. Wrapping it up is Buzz, a great track from Hate for Sale, the 11th and most recent album by Pretenders released in July 2020. Time has been kind to Chrissie Hynde’s voice that sounds just as compelling as back in 1980, the year the band’s eponymous debut album came out. There’s another commonality: Original drummer Martin Chambers who had returned after eight years. Apart from Hynde (rhythm guitar, lead vocals, harmonica) and Chambers, Pretenders’ current line-up also includes James Walbourne (lead guitar, backing vocals), Eric Heywood (pedal steel guitar, backing vocals) Carwyn Ellis (keyboards) and Nick Wilkinson (bass). Hate for Sale is pretty solid. In case you’re curious, check out my previous review here. Like all other songs on the album, Buzz was co-written by Hynde and Walbourne.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; The Beatles Bible; YouTube"
