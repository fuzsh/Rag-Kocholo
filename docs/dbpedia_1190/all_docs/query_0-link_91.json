        "text": "Title - Queen Rock Montreal [3LP]\n\nArtist - Queen\n\nQueen Rock Montreal captures the worlds most iconic rock band at the very peak of their live powers. Recorded in 1981 and recently released as a record-breaking digitally restored IMAX concert film, this landmark moment in the bands history is now being released as both double Blu-Ray and double 4K Ultra High Definition packages, plus double CD and triple vinyl packages.\n\nQueen Rock Montreal presents Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon at their most exciting and exhilarating. As Brian May puts it, this is Queen live and dangerous.\n\nQueen were on all-conquering form when they returned to Montreal, Canada for the fourth time in November 1981 to play two huge concerts at the 18,000-seat Forum. This pair of Montreal concerts marked an historic moment for Queen.\n\nAfter their massive success in the 1970s, the band entered the 80s bigger than ever, with the hugely successful The Game album producing their two biggest ever US singles in Another One Bites The Dust and Crazy Little Thing Called Love (both Billboard No.1s), followed by the UK No.1 single Under Pressure.\n\nQueens return to Montreal came after almost two years of touring, including their very first tours of South and Central America, which saw the band playing two nights at Sao Paulos Morumbi Stadium to more than 150,000 devoted fans. As a result, when the band arrived in Canada in November 1981 they were in electrifying form.\n\nMontreal is one of our favorite cities, its a great audience there, very full of energy, says Brian May. Wed played this particular venue, The Forum, several times before, and it was always full of really enthusiastic people giving us a lot of energy back.\n\nThe original concerts, which took place on November 24 and 25, 1981, were truly ground-breaking. They were arranged specifically to be filmed for a full-length concert film to document their live show. Director Saul Swimmer planned to shoot them using state-of-the-art Double Anamorphic 35mm footage, which allowed it to be projected on a gigantic, five-storey high screen. Backstage tensions between the members of Queen and Swimmer could have caused problems, but instead they propelled the band to new heights.\n\nWe were very, very hyped up, some of the tempos are really fast, theres a lot of really incisive, angry playing, says May.\n\nSays Taylor: Its fascinating to now realize how free we were on stage in 1981. Its a four piece, just the four of us in Queen, and to see Freddie. Its like being on stage with the band because the cameras are very high quality for the time. Ive never seen anything that makes you feel quite so involved with the performance.\n\nSide A:\n\n1. Intro\n\n2. We Will Rock You (Fast)\n\n3. Let Me Entertain You\n\n4. Play The Game\n\n5.

We Will Rock You\n\n4. We Are The Champions\n\n5. God Save The Queen\n\nFrom Freddie Mercurys opening cry of Hello Montreal. Long time no see. You wanna get crazy?, things heat up very quickly thereafter, as from the musical opener We Will Rock You (fast version) and a sweeping Let Me Entertain You, on through into the trilogy of magnificence that was Play The Game and Somebody To Love, and flipping the first vinyl over and then getting the thunderous Killer Queen, I think it was obvious to everyone that no group blended melodic, operatic ballads with thunderous hard rock quite like they did.\n\nRounding out the first vinyl LP with the propulsive underlying Im In Love With My Car and both the enthrallingly personal Get Down, Make Love, and a virtually bombastically cultured Save Me, the powerful vocal acrobatics of Mercury, Mays dazzling six-string pyrotechnics, Deacons rock solid heartbeat bass, and Taylors unstoppable rhythmic display, not to mention the unique combination of all four voices, is as gripping as any live show you could have ever seen in history.\n\nThe second vinyl LP opens on a gripping Now Im Here, a track lyrically about the pressures of going into the studio and having to perform Dragon Attack, a quick reprise of Now Im Here, and then we get one of the true highlights here, their signature, achingly diligent ballad Love Of My Life, and the immense Under Pressure.\n\nFlipping the vinyl over (which just so happens to always have been on my favorite things to do) and we next get treated to the frantic Keep Yourself Alive, which is itself backed by a Drum And Tympani Solo which bleeds seamlessly into the Brian May Guitar Solo, before two cuts from the Flash Gordon soundtrack are brought forth: the magnificently operatic, cinematic Flash and the more languishing The Hero.\n\nThe third and final vinyl LP acts as more of a greatest hits ride, as it opens on the rambunctiously seductive Crazy Little Thing Called Love, a vibrantly authentic cover of Jailhouse Rock, and then we get another of the genuine highlights here, the soaring, veritably towering Bohemian Rhapsody, which is itself backed by one of my all-time favorites, the speed-fest of Tie Your Mother Down.\n\nFlipping the vinyl over one last time on this lush three-record set, and next we get the rhythmic Another One Bites The Dust, with the last few songs being just as spectacular as the ones that have gone before, and again capture the band at their baddest best: the always impressive Sheer Heart Attack leading the way, then comes the anthemic trilogy of We Will Rock You, We Are The Champions, and an embroidered God Save The Queen, which then leaves us all wanting for more as the music, and the band, fade off into the night time darkness.\n\nOfficial Purchase Link\n\nwww.queenonlinestore.com\n\nTitle - Art Songs of the Jewish Diaspora\n\nArtist - Ian Pomerantz\n\nFor those unaware, Even in living memory, the locus of Jewish classical music has not always been Israel or the United States of America. This month, Acis is proud to release ART SONGS OF THE JEWISH DIASPORA, a new album of songs performed by Ian Pomerantz (bass-baritone), Byron Schenkman (piano), and Sarah Freiberg (cello).\n\nThe album is a story of stories. It uncovers a treasury of Jewish art song through which the diversity of the diaspora experience, and the lives, countries, and compositional styles of many overlooked composers is celebrated.\n\nMany of the songs have not been recorded in the digital age and have survived only in archives up until now. Amongst them, there is queer, female, refugee, Sephardi, Ashkenazi, and Mizrahi representation.\n\nPomerantz and Schenkmans research and performance project is one of the heart, and the album has been years in the making. It features nineteen works written by ten composers, with songs in six languages, together with piano and cello solo tracks. The liner notes come with modern translations and biographical details deepened through new research and the cooperation of surviving family members and their estates.\n\nPianist BYRON SCHENKMAN says, This program is one of the most personally meaningful of the more than forty recording projects I have been a part of. Like so many Jews in diaspora, I was taught from an early age to hide, or at least downplay, my Jewish identity. Now it is a joy and an honor to celebrate not only my own heritage but the rich diversity of Jewish experience.\n\nBass-baritone IAN POMERANTZ says, The composers and poets here are a testament to the persistence of Jewish art music down the centuries and their legacy that continues into the present. We had to limit ourselves to what would fit on an album  an album that will now be a door for others into a vast treasury of music that needs exploring!

Hes so receptive to the emotional resonances that music creates inside him and stays in tune with those frequencies. His insights allowed me to remain intuitive throughout, even when many of the things the score had to accomplish were quite technical.\n\nWhile our protagonist experiences a different kind of metaphysical impact of music in her life than I do, its akin to the transporting inebriation that Ive always felt from music. Scoring those experiences to capture that kind of heightened, altered state, weaving between and within great songs by other artists, was its own transporting experience for me.\n\nNed Benson, The Greatest Hits Writer, Director, and Executive Soundtrack Album Producer, added, I am haunted by music. Its my partner in crime when I write or when I drive around LA. Its the pile of records on my shelves and floor that gets me up in the morning and reminds me to live. To me, theres no better self-medication than getting lost in a song. So, this movie, and this soundtrack, was a love letter to music and its ability to not only take us back in time, but to remind us to live in the moment.\n\nOfficial Purchase Link\n\nwww.hollywoodrecords.com\n\nwww.disneymusicemporium.com\n\nTitle - Stradella Mottetti\n\nArtist - Rinaldo Alessandrini and Concerto Italiano\n\nRinaldo Alessandrini and Concerto Italiano continue their exploration of 17th century Italian motets with a new disc of works by composer Alessandro Stradella (1643-1682), out on Naïve Classiques on June 21st, 2024.\n\nPrincipally known for his oratorios and operas, Stradellas output of sacred motets is still in an embryonic state, says Rinaldo Alessandrini. Three manuscripts can be found in the Biblioteca Estense in Modena: a total of seventeen motets for various ensembles, of which five have been recorded on this CD.\n\nThe album also includes Stradellas Symphonias in D Major and F Major. Except for Stradellas Exultate in Deo fideles, all of the motets on the album are world premiere recordings.\n\nRinaldo Alessandrini writes, Some of the motets recorded here are dedicated to the Virgin Mary, or to be specific, are written for particular festivals: Nascere virgo for the Nativity (September 8); Convocamini, congregamini for the Immaculate Conception (December 8).\n\nThe motet Sistite sidera was conceived for more general festivities of the Blessed Virgin, as was In tribulationis. Stradella himself, however, is the stated author of the text of the extra-liturgical motet Exultate in Deo fideles referred to as for the Most Holy.\n\n1.

A multifaceted individual, he delved into the worlds of photography, music, and even mastered the art of billiards. As a mere five-year-old, I was but a sponge, eagerly absorbing the greatness exuded by my dad.\n\nOur living room was a sanctuary of sound and culture, adorned with a piano, a couple of chairs, and a sophisticated stereo boasting a turntable. Each evening, as the aroma of dinner wafted from the kitchen where my mother toiled, the air would resonate with the melodies of jazz legends such as Miles Davis, Oscar Peterson, and John Coltrane, amongst a constellation of other luminaries.\n\nMy affinity for music blossomed early, with the upright piano in our living room becoming my instrument of choice. It was here that I first encountered classical compositions and familiarized myself with jazz standards like In a Sentimental Mood, Misty, and A Night in Tunisia.\n\nNow, over five decades later, the yearning to perform my fathers cherished favorites ignited within me. The quest led me to Samurai Studios, where a century-old piano awaited, its timbre akin to liquid gold. Though my father departed in 2008, our session together felt like a communion between my earthly self and his celestial spirit. It was a comforting realization to know that he was present in the room as the music unfurled, culminating in the creation of the album Songs My Father Would Dig.\n\nA poignant addition to this musical journey was the participation of my late cousin, Larry Willis. A luminary in his own right, Larry graced the stages alongside icons like Blood, Sweat & Tears and Hugh Masekela. We paid homage to him with the track To Wisdom, The Prize, infusing his spirit into the heart of our project.\n\nRecording alongside Richie Goods on bass, and my steadfast companions Tony Lewis on drums and Edson da Silva on percussion, was a moment of pure joy. In the autumnal embrace of Queens, with the presence of both my father and cousin Larry permeating the air, we surrendered to the music, allowing it to carry us to transcendent heights.\n\nMay you, dear listener, revel in the melodies woven from the threads of memory and legacy. For within the strains of each note, resonates the essence of those who have shaped and inspired us along our journey. [Bob Baldwin].\n\n1. EQUINOX\n\n2. DOLPHIN DANCE\n\n3.

Girl Groups & Pop Chanteuses (60-66)\n\nArtist - Various\n\nFor those unaware, from Glenda Collins to Diane And The Javelins, during the 1960s Joe Meek worked with countless female artists, many of whom issued just one single, or perhaps never even made it that far. But, until now, the extent of this work, and the volume of material recorded, has remained buried among the Tea Chest Tapes. This unprecedented 3CD set explores that archive in-depth for the first time.\n\nFeaturing established names and previously unknown artists (and indeed, at least one artist whose identity is still unknown), Do The Strum! shines another spotlight on Meeks remarkable work with everything from the serene tones of Pat Reader to the gutsy soul of Glenda Collins and the proto girl-punk of The Sharades.\n\nSpanning almost seven years, and mirroring the changing pop scene of the era, from pre-Beatle to powerful, stripped-down hard rock, this set recontextualises both Meek himself and the artists within. Lost classics and shoulda-beens pervade, and the imagination and production quality never drops below Joe Meeks perfectionist standards. And, most importantly, itll all make you want to shake a tail feather!\n\nIncludes every known A and B side, material from the abandoned Live It Up! film soundtrack, singles that never were, auditions, demos and alternate versions of familiar recordings.\n\nA must-have for fans and collectors of girl groups, Meek freaks young and old and students and historians of British pop. Dont settle for the tried and tested story youll read in books and magazines  this is the real deal, restored, remastered and as fresh as the day it was recorded!\n\nCD 1: The Singles\n\n1 Eve Boswell  Sur Le Pont DAvignon 2 Yolanda  With This Kiss 3 Carol Jones  Boy With The Eyes Of Blue (Meek Version) 4 Pat Reader  Cha Cha On The Moon 5 Glenda Collins  I Lost My Heart At The Fairground 6 Jenny Moss  Hobbies 7 The Cameos  Powercut (Alternate Vocal/Original Speed) 8 Pamela Blue  My Friend Bobby 9 Glenda Collins  If Youve Got To Pick A Baby 10 Gunilla Thorn  Merry Go Round (Original Speed) 11 Jenny Moss  Please Let It Happen To Me (Film Version) 12 The Sharades  Dumb Head 13 Kim Roberts  Ill Prove It 14 The Cameos  My Babys Coming Home 15 Glenda Collins  Baby It Hurts 16 Glenda Collins  Lollipop 17 Flip And The Dateliners  My Johnny Doesnt Come Around Anymore 18 Valerie Masters  Christmas Calling 19 Glenda Collins  Johnny Loves Me 20 Judy Cannon  The Very First Day I Met You 21 Glenda Collins  Thou Shalt Not Steal 22 The Honeycombs  Something Ive Got To Tell You (Stereo Mix) 23 Diane And The Javelins  Heart And Soul 24 Glenda Collins  Something Ive Got To Tell You (Original Speed) 25 Glenda Collins  Its Hard To Believe It.\n\nKicking off with Eve Boswells magic capturing foot tapper Sur Le Pont DAvignon and Yolandas aching ballad With This Kiss, and they are followed by a track that was eventually released a month after Joe Meek left Triumph, Carol Jones vibrant Boy With The Eyes Of Blue (Meek Version), the aptly-titled Cha Cha On The Moon (Pat Reader), a track where Glenda Collins puts her broken heart on the Tilt-A-Whirl within I Lost My Heart At The Fairground and then we get the harmonica-driven Hobbies (Jenny Moss), the frantic Powercut (The Cameos), and both the magically emotive My Friend Bobby (Pamela Blue) and featuring a young Ritchie Blackmore on guitar, we next get Glenda Collins vibrant If Youve Got To Pick A Baby.\n\nWe next get Swedish pop singer Gunilla Thorns Merry Go Round, the film version of Jenny Moss impeccable Please Let It Happen To Me, the rock n roll disco sound of The Sharades Dumb Head and then comes Kim Roberts only single, and quite a Decca rarity Ill Prove It, the spirited psych rocker My Babys Coming Home (The Cameos), then come two from big ballad singer Glenda Collins;

the simply divine pairing of both May Your Heart Stay Young Forever and My Kind Of Love, a couple of unknowns are then paraded in the form of the lush Say Baby and the impassioned Johnny Oh, before we are brought forth a duo from Geri Harlow; the robust Do The Strum and the Caribbean-hued Mr Right.\n\nAlong next are five from Billie Davis, and which kick off with the free flowing Merry Go Round, the licking Dont You Knock On My Door, the lusciously orchestrated Its Goodbye Then, a different, sterner cut entitled Mr Right and the pop-tastic I Think Im Falling In Love, with a quartet from Glenda Collins along next; the shaking shimmer of I Feel So Good, the thigh slapper In The First Place (Original Speed), and both the foot-tapper Nice Wasnt It (Original Speed) and the guitar twanging Everybodys Gotta Fall In Love (Original Speed).\n\nUp next is a quintet from Jennifer Victoria Jenny Moss (an English actress and singer born in Wigan, Lancashire), and which opens on expansive Big Boys, the romantic Please Let It Happen To Me (Alternate Version), the strident Keep Away From My Babys Door, the country chug of When My Boy Comes Marching Home Again, and a piano-led Every Little Kiss (Demo), then we get five from Kim Roberts; the pure pop sway of For Loving Me This Way, the luxuriant soul of A Girl In the Crowd, another Mr. Right cut, the production sturdy Everytime, and the unmistakable Joe Meek sound really comes to the fore on her Love Cant Wait.\n\nThe second disc rounds out on the sketchy sounds of The Cameos High, Low And Lonesomely (Alternate Version), their cheesetastic Where Ere You Walk, and then we get their free flowingly pop lovely Only In Love and Pamela Blues wonderfully double tracked vocals that elegantly flow on her Hey There Stranger (Alternate Version).\n\nCD 3: 1964-1966\n\n1 Gunilla Thorn  Go On Then 2 Gunilla Thorn  Blueberry Hill 3 Gunilla Thorn  Keep Away From My Babys Door 4 Gunilla Thorn  Alright Im In Love With You (Audition) 5 Gunilla Thorn  Come On 6 Gunilla Thorn  Who Started It 7 The Halos  When 8 The Halos  Dont Ever Change 9 Lea And Chess  Little Star (Shine On us Tonight) 10 Lea And Chess  A Long Time Ago 11 Valerie Masters  He Didnt Fool Me 12 The Sharades  Boy Trouble (Alternate Version) 13 The Sharades  Arent You Glad Youre You 14 The Sharades  Loneliness 15 Flip & The Dateliners  Please Listen To Me 16 Flip & The Dateliners  Bye Bye Baby Bunting 17 Flip & The Dateliners  Mama Didnt Lie 18 Flip & The Dateliners  The Mod 19 Flip and The Dateliners  From Tomorrow 20 Flip (with Riot Squad)  Its Hard To Believe It 21 June Harris  Ma I Miss Your Apple Pie 22 June Harris  Remember Your Love Belongs To Me 23 Judy Cannon  Hello Heartache (Alternate Version) 24 Glenda Collins  Been Invited To A Party 25 Glenda Collins  Paradise For Two (Mix Take 4) 26 Glenda Collins  My Heart Didnt Lie (Original Speed/Pre Backing Vocals) 27 Glenda Collins  Dont Let It Rain On Sunday 28 Denise Scott and The Soundsmen  Your Love Keeps Me Going 29 Denise Scott and The Soundsmen  Love Me Tonight 30 Diane And The Javelins  Whose The Girl 31 Diane And The Javelins  Cry Baby.\n\nThe third and final disc opens on a sextet from Gunilla Thorn, backed by The Outlaws, on the vibrant Go On Then leading the way, being followed by the swarthy Blueberry Hill, the fervent swirls and twirls that flow within Keep Away From My Babys Door, the impassioned Alright Im In Love With You (Audition), and both the Hammond-hued Come On and the spirited Who Started It, and they are backed seamlessly by two from The Halos; the freely enjoyable When and their heartfelt Dont Ever Change, before we get the closest sounding thing to Phil Spectors recordings that Joe did, Lea And Chess Little Star (Shine On us Tonight) and A Long Time Ago, with the lovely He Didnt Fool Me from Valerie Masters next.\n\nAlong next is there from The Sharades, opening on the dancefloor swirls and twirls off Boy Trouble (Alternate Version), the strident fare of Arent You Glad Youre You and the luxuriant Loneliness, and then we get six from Flip & The Dateliners, and which begin with the finger-snapper Please Listen To Me, the guitar-fed Bye Bye Baby Bunting, the swarthy hipsway of Mama Didnt Lie, the twanging beauty The Mod, the all-embracing melodies of From Tomorrow, before one from Flip (with Riot Squad) and the elegant Its Hard To Believe It is brought forth.\n\nThe third disc, and the collection as a whole, then rounds out with a couple from June Harris in the form of the engrossing Ma I Miss Your Apple Pie and the dutiful hipsway of Remember Your Love Belongs To Me, then we get one from Aussie songstress Judy Cannon, the lush Hello Heartache (Alternate Version), before a quartet from Glenda Collins; beginning with the rambunctious Been Invited To A Party (which was itself originally the b-side to the 1965 single, John D. Loudermilks Thou Shalt Not Steal), the lovely Paradise For Two (Mix Take 4), the extremely underrated My Heart Didnt Lie (Original Speed/Pre Backing Vocals) and the Riot Squad backed Dont Let It Rain On Sunday, all coming to a close on, quite possibly, pseudo stereo cuts of Denise Scott and The Soundsmens Your Love Keeps Me Going and Love Me Tonight, ending on the veritably shimmering rocker Whose The Girl and the animated Cry Baby from Diane And The Javelins.\n\nOfficial Purchase Link\n\nwww.cherryred.co.uk\n\nTitle - The Sound of Thunder\n\nArtist - McCoy\n\nFor those unaware, the world of hard rock and heavy metal attracts many larger-than-life characters, and few are larger than life than John McCoy. Although he has had a long and varied career, from Atomic Rooster to Zzebra, plus Samson and Mammoth, among others, McCoy is probably best known for playing bass with Gillan, the band he formed with Ian Gillan of Deep Purple.\n\nFor an all too brief few years, John McCoy could be relied upon to entertain millions whilst whilst holding down the bottom end with Gillan on Top Of The Pops, playing sold out world tours, or snapping bass guitars in half on Saturday morning kids TV shows like Tiswas.\n\nWhen Gillan came to an abrupt and untimely end in 1982 following a packed Wembley Arena show, John McCoy formed the eponymous McCoy with an impressive line-up featuring former Gillan colleague Colin Towns on keyboards, Paul Samson of Samson on lead guitar, original Iron Maiden drummer Ron Rebel Matthews and vocalist Tony T-Bone Rees.\n\nCD 1: McCOY EP (1982)\n\n1 Oh Well!\n\n2 Night Lights\n\n3 The Sound Of Thunder\n\n4 Temporary Threshold Shift\n\n5 Because You Lied\n\nTHINK HARD (1985):\n\n6 Freemind\n\n7 The Demon Rose\n\n8 Loving Lies\n\n9 The Demon Rose\n\n10 Heads Will Roll\n\n11 Ride The Night\n\n12 Fear Of The Morning\n\n13 Jerusalem\n\n14 Night Lights (Alternate Version) BONUS TRACK\n\n15 Oh Well! (Single Version) BONUS TRACK\n\nThis set kicks off with the self-titled McCoy EP (CD1), which starts with a rollicking cover of Fleetwood Macs Oh Well. The EP ends with Because You Lied, a song sadly aimed at the lead singer of his former band. Released in 1985, Think Hard (CD1) was McCoys first full set, featuring Hell to Play, Heads Will Roll and Ride The Night.\n\nBest known for forming Gillan, the band, with ex Deep Purple front man, Ian Gillan, when they badly broke up after 4 years, with John McCoy going on to form McCoy (the band, and ultimately, Mammoth), he did indeed write and subsequently dedicate Because You Lied to Ian Gillan, which might just be why I love the raw honesty of its lyrics so much.\n\nAs for their first long-player, 1985s Think Hard, well, now were talking as it is a foot to the floor rocker that is, as they say, all killer with no filler!\n\nSure it was recorded on a low budget and admittedly with an average vocalist, but my goodness, they get the best out of both here. Especially on tracks such as Freemind, The Demon Rose, The Demon Rose, Heads Will Roll, and my own personal favorite, Ride The Night (although the bonus track Oh Well! is a great touch too!).\n\nI shows itself not to be a flashy rocker, at times not even a tasteful rocker, but instead a blended mix of catchy rock riffs that satisfy with every lick.\n\nCD 2: BRAINSTORM (1998)\n\n1 Dreaming Of The Dead\n\n2 Heavy Metal Cowboy\n\n3 On And On\n\n4 Outrageous\n\n5 I Know A Place\n\n6 Dont Walk Away\n\n7 Save Me\n\n8 Steamtrain\n\n9 Bad Luck\n\n10 Josephine\n\n11 Tarot Cards\n\n12 The Prophets Of Doom\n\n13 The List/Zoomusic/The List Continues\n\n14 Disillusioned\n\n15 Hawaiians 2 - Electrolux 1\n\nBrainstorm (CD 2) was recorded at Studio 43 in New York. McCoy was joined by ex-Belladonna guitarist/vocalist Al Romano and drummer Mike Sciotto (From The Fire); Rainbow and Black Sabbath drummer Bobby Rondinelli guests on two tracks.\n\nBeing joined here by both ex-Belladonna guitarist/vocalist Al Romano and Mike Scoitto (From The Fire) really needs to be brought into the light as this trio brought out what was the culmination of two years work and it is the most perfect showcase for McCoys talents.\n\nAs well as being chock full of some truly great hard rock playing, where tracks can be sometimes introspective, sometimes wildly upfront, this is an album that always repays repeated investigation.\n\nIn truth, and rightly so, McCoy takes chances in the diversity of his material and style on this album. Meaning that Brainstorm will not be pigeon holed and is certainly not for the faint of heart, of course. Classic, ageless and without boundaries, McCoy the artist, the band and this album, in particular, are in the most incredible form of their collective careers.\n\nCD 3: LIVE 1977\n\n1 Are You Sitting Comfortably?\n\n2 Ill Be Round (Part One)\n\n3 Will You Want Me?\n\n4 Ill Be Round (Part Two)\n\n5 Big Brother\n\n6 Telephone\n\n7 Wrong Side of Time\n\n8 Loser\n\n9 Six Foot Under\n\n10 Cathedral\n\n11 Love Lace Lady\n\n12 The Shuffle\n\n13 Nasty Dogs and Funk Kings\n\n14 Big Boss Man\n\n15 So Low\n\n16 I Wish I Was\n\nThe band Samson were a major influence on the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal at the end of the 1970s, and John McCoy was an important figure for the band, playing bass, producing and co-writing their 1979 debut album. Prior to that, the band McCoy, with Paul Samson and drummer Roger Hunt, were regulars on the London and South East gigging circuit. Captured at the height of new wave, Live 1977 (CD 3) acts as a raw, rough and ready antidote to the nascent punk scene that gripped the UK at that time.\n\nRecorded on July 11th, 1977 at The Target in Reading, Berkshire, this is the only surviving record of this power trio making this third CD an indispensable piece of rock history, and arguably one of the touchstones of NWOBHM, as several of the songs would eventually form the aforementioned Samson debut album; Big Brother, Six Foot Under, The Shuffle, Wrong Side of Time. Despite the challenging sound quality, you can still sense something special emerging.\n\nOfficial Purchase Link\n\nwww.cherryred.co.uk\n\nTitle - Phase By Phase  The Virgin Albums [3CD]\n\nArtist - Peter Baumann\n\nFor those unaware, as a key member of Tangerine Dream, Peter Baumanns contribution was felt on the classic albums released by Virgin Records issued between 1974 and 1976, Phaedra, Rubicon, Ricochet and Stratosphere.\n\nIn 1976 he embarked on a solo career with his classic work Romance 76, recorded in July and August that year in Berlin and Munich. The result was a remarkable album that is now held in huge esteem by aficionados of German electronic music.\n\nHis next work as a solo artist was the equally remarkable and ground-breaking album Trans Harmonic Nights, recorded in Berlin between July 1978 and January 1979, a release which per-empted and influenced the protagonists of synthesizer-based music that would burst forth in the 1980s.\n\nHis third and final album for Virgin Records was Repeat Repeat, which saw him adopt a more song-based approach to his writing, stylistically akin with the prevailing mood of the early 1980s. Recorded in New York and at Compass Point studios in Nassau in the Bahamas, Repeat Repeat was co-produced by Baumann and Robert Palmer.\n\nPhase By Phase  The Virgin Albums [3CD] is the first time all of Peter Baumanns solo works issued by Virgin Records have been gathered together in one collection.\n\nCD 1: Romance 76\n\n1. Bicentennial Present\n\n2. Romance\n\n3. Phase by Phase\n\n4. Meadow of Infinity (Part One)\n\n5. The Glass Bridge\n\n6. Meadow of Infinity (Part Two)\n\nWith blatant references to Rubycon, Ricochet, and Stratosfear popping up in various places, its actually Baumanns arrangements here that have an added clarity and directness that drive the music more than one would have imagined.\n\nThus on a song like Phase by Phase, the results can seem circumspect, and too much open space allows the listeners attention to seep out through the cracks. But the rest of the record finds Baumann expertly controlling what he wants the listener to hear.\n\nFor a further example, Romance introduces new sounds carefully and for calculated effect, a style that would reappear on the Baumann-produced Grosses Wasser by Cluster. This and the opening Bicentennial Present are remarkably accessible for electronic music from the 70s - the latter especially feels like the best parts of Stratosfear distilled - but never at the expense of sounding trite.\n\nBaumann shows off different styles of electronic music on the first three tracks, only to challenge the listeners expectations all over again with the semi-classical Meadow of Infinity. Mixing orchestral instruments (cellos, human voices, percussion) and electronics, the composer creates a tone poem using only the sounds he needs to describe the action.\n\nCD 2: Trans Harmonic Nights\n\n1. This Day\n\n2. White Bench and Black Beach\n\n3. Chasing the Dream\n\n4. Biking Up the Strand\n\n5. Phaseday\n\n6. Meridian Moorland\n\n7. The Third Site\n\n8. Dance at Dawn\n\nBaumanns second solo album, released in 1978 following his departure from Tangerine Dream, covers much of the same ground as his first solo album, meaning it is mostly short, unfussy, minimalist melodic synthesizer pieces with perky sequencing.\n\nThe main addition to the mix is a vocoder which Peter makes liberal use of in several of the tracks. To be honest, the music on offer here will be immediately familiar in style to anyone whos heard Tangerine Dreams Stratosfear, Encore or all those bootlegs of their lives sets from back when, to the point where it makes me wonder why Baumann felt he had to leave the band to make this stuff.\n\nI mean, it can hardly have been so-called musical differences (indeed he even can be heard some distinctly Edgar-ish fuzzed guitar in places), but regardless, the music is timeless.\n\nCD 3: Repeat Repeat:\n\n1. Repeat Repeat\n\n2. Home Sweet Home\n\n3. Deccadance\n\n4. Real Times\n\n5. M.A.N. Series Two\n\n6. Brain Damage\n\n7. Kinky Dinky\n\n8. Daytime Logic\n\n9. Playland Pleasure\n\n10. What is Your Use\n\nBaumann returned in 1981 with his third solo album, Repeat Repeat. After two well received electronic/progressive/instrumental albums in the late seventies, Repeat Repeat, produced by Robert Palmer along with Baumann, is a straight forward electro-New Wave album.\n\nIndeed, this new venture has Baumann providing vocals on all tracks with a style similar to Gary Numan and icy electronics that recall Kraftwerk and early John Foxx. The title track was given a single release and music video in the UK, which I vividly recall, having grown up in England.\n\nAnd by the time the album was released in the USA, the running order was shuffled and a couple of songs had been remixed. Daytime Logic was released as a single and became an underground dance hit.\n\nIn closing, and with the album title Repeat Repeat, luckily he didnt actually bring forth another Ricochet here, or God forbid, another Romance 76 album! For me, the best track is definitely Playland Pleasure, itself being a rather catchy and addictive cut than most all the others: and one that we can even lovingly recognize its elements inspired by prior Tangerine Dream albums.\n\nOfficial Purchase Link\n\nTitle - No Steps Left To Trace [2CD]\n\nArtist - PAKT\n\nFor those unaware, PAKT, a true super group of master musicians merging and colliding new music in the realms of progressive rock, electric jazz, experimental, ambient, psychedelic and beyond, is an experience as much as a musical project.\n\nAn IMAX film for the ears, PAKT takes its listeners on an improvised sonic voyage with no preconceived destination, minimal pre-planning and little use for forms and conventions. Rare is the musician who can thrive in such a spontaneous environment, but Percy Jones (fretless bass guitar), Alex Skolnick (guitar), Kenny Grohowski (drums) and Tim Motzer (guitar and electronics) are all up to the task.\n\nArmed with enough tastefully used effects to stock a small music store, Motzer and Skolnick create sounds so atmospheric and ethereal that one might not guess their source is a guitar. Meanwhile, Grohowski and Jones approach their instruments in textural manners that seamlessly intertwine with each other and the quartet as a whole.\n\nErgo, the music here on their brand new live album No Steps Left To Trace runs the gamut from highly sensitive to intense, with all four musicians listening skills so strong that their collective playing is as cohesive as it is unpredictable.\n\nWelsh bassist Jones (now a New York resident) is known for his tenure in the legendary jazz fusion group Brand X (whose classic lineup included drummer Phil Collins, yes that one) and extensive studio work (especially with Brian Eno). Skolnick is a diverse improviser whose jazz and world playing and instrumental associations (including bass virtuosos Stuart Hamm and Michael Manring) forms a Jeckyll & Hyde dynamic with his high profile as lead guitarist of the metal band Testament.\n\nGrohowskis many recent associations include John Zorn, a reincarnated version of Brand X and masked avant-metal outfit, Imperial Triumphant. Motzer has a long background in free improvisation, including the bands Bandit65 (with fellow guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel) and Orion Tango, plus many other recorded collaborations for his 1k Recordings label.\n\nBefore this album, all of PAKTs releases had been taken from live performances. This studio session took place during the bands East Coast tour in December, 2021. Primed from several successful shows in Upstate New York (including musician Daryl Halls thriving venue in Pawling, NY, Daryls House), the band took the day off in the Catskills Mountains, where they tracked live at NRS Studios.\n\nNRS is located in the home of musician/recording engineer Scott Petito, whose studio has hosted such luminaries John Scofield, Chick Corea and James Taylor. The PAKT musicians set up in a circle, all in the same room and performed, just as they would at a live concert. This began in the late morning and continued past dusk. By days end, they had accumulated a bunch of material  quite a nice document of where the band was musically back in 2021.\n\nLive, of course, they have an audience that takes the ride with them. It is a real shared experience in that regard. Motzer curated five such journeys for the Live CD, one from Buffalo, three from NYC (Nublu), and one from Philadelphia.\n\nAdding the live album to the double release shows the growth and evolving chemistry in PAKT from the 2021 studio recording to the newer live recordings in 2023. Its a nice contrast with a lot of great interplay and listening happening from all the players. It also makes the album an excellent introduction to the bands music for anyone new to it, as well as a fine addition to their discography.\n\n1. No Steps Left To Trace, Part 1 (21:11)\n\n2. No Steps Left To Trace, Part 2 (15:34)\n\n3. On The Other Side, Part 1 (11:12)\n\n4. Wormhole (1:44)\n\n5. On The Other Side, Part 2 (9:29)\n\n6. Spontaneous Combustion (9:58)\n\n7.

Solar Myth (22:34)\n\nThis wonderfully musical abstract new live recording opens on No Steps Left To Trace, the fluidly rhythmic Part 1 and the more jaggedly industrial Part 2 along with On The Other Side, and the frenetically flirtatious Part 1, and they are backed by the digital hubbub of the short, but sweet Wormhole, Part 2 of the melodically-structured, yet playfully avant-garde On The Other Side, the free-flowing Spontaneous Combustion, and they are then followed seamlessly by the, at first, hauntingly ethereal, latterly frantically sculpted The Ghost Mills, the gentle rhythms that drive NYC III, the all-embracing stillness of pulse that drives NYC IV, the propulsive blues/prog that is NYC V, the recording coming to a close on the spatially aware guitar jam that is the 22 minute Solar Myth.\n\nMusicians:\n\nPERCY JONES - bass guitar\n\nALEX SKOLNICK - guitars\n\nKENNY GROHOWSKI drums\n\nTIM MOTZER - guitars, electronics\n\nOfficial Purchase Link\n\nwww.moonjune.com\n\nTitle - Dream Into Action [2024 New Stereo Mix Remix]\n\nArtist - Howard Jones\n\nFor those unaware, Cherry Red Records are delighted and proud to announce the newly remastered and expanded release of Howard Jones second album Dream Into Action.\n\nReleased in March 1985, Dream Into Action reached No.2 in the UK Album Charts and achieved Gold Album status. Like its pre-decessor Humans Lib, Dream Into Action contained four Top 20 hit singles; Things Can Only Get Better reached No.6, Look Mama at No. 10, Life In One Day at No.14 and No One Is To Blame at No.16.\n\nIn addition to these four Top 20 Hit singles, the original CD version of Dream Into Action also contained a bonus track, namely Howards hit single from the previous year - Like To Get To Know You Well - which reached No.4 in the Singles Chart.\n\nDream Into Action also enjoyed massive international acclaim and success; particularly in the USA where it reached No.10 in the Billboard Album charts achieving Platinum status. It spawned three Billboard Top 20 hit singles including Things Can Only Get Better at No.5, Life In One Day at No.19 and a re-recorded version of No One Is To Blame featuring Phil Collins on backing vocals and drums (produced by Hugh Padgham), which gave Howard his biggest ever US hit single reaching No.4.\n\nAs well as achieving great success in the UK (# 1) and USA, Dream Into Action and the various singles taken from it also enjoyed tremendous success internationally in such countries as Canada, New Zealand, Australia and throughout most of Europe.\n\nDisc 1: Blu-Ray - 5.1 Surround Sound Mix and 96/24 LPCM 2024 New Stereo Mix\n\n1.

Like To Get To Know You Well [Dolby Atmos Mixes]\n\nHoward Jones second album is very different from his brilliant Humans Lib, as it doesnt really rely quite as much on synthesizers, although they are still very dominant. But in no way is Dream Into Action much weaker, of that I think we can all attest to.\n\nAgain, Jones has released an uplifting, encouraging and melodious album, concentrating on people; their feelings and emotions. The first two songs, Things Can Only Get Better and Life In A Day, typify this perfectly, with such lyrics as Try and enjoy the here and now, the future will take care of itself somehow/Grass is never greener over there.\n\nOther songs, that focus on troubled lives, include Elegy and Specialty (bout time you realized, you are a specialty, there is no-one like you / Spend your life worrying bout what you could have been, cant you like being you.).\n\nDream Into Action and Look Mama, the latter about an overbearing parent, are two other fine tracks, while Jones does include hard-hitting songs here, including Hunger For The Flesh and the magnificent Assault and Battery, arguably his best song of all.\n\nOK, sure, the brilliant first half of the record is followed by a slightly lesser second, but overall, this is another outstanding release from a very talented man, and possibly the one of his which has aged the best.\n\nDisc 2: CD - 2024 New Stereo Mix\n\n1.

Both released albums with similar titles and both were direct competitors. The first of those records, Human Racing by Kershaw, is one of the greatest albums ever made. The other, Humans Lib, is still very worthy and, in some ways, matches the newborn enthusiasm that brought Human Racing cruising into our lives back then.\n\nJones was a synth wiz and a bit of a hippy (this reflects heavily in the albums lyrics). The synths are very nicely arranged here and unlike a lot of 80s pop records, there is more to be found than just the singles. What is Love and New Song are both brilliant, but I also love tracks like Conditioning, Pearl in the Shell, Dont Always Look At The Rain and the title track.\n\nThe main criticism though here is that being a hippy, he can get a bit pretentious in his lyrics, but I can look past this. The synths can also get a bit too heavy occasionally at times, but that doesnt mean that the album, overall, isnt thoroughly enjoyable, as it is most definitely still to this day one his best.\n\nIn closing, the albums big hit New Song is Howard trying to motivate his friends to throw off their mental chains, and indeed, with its wriggly, joyous Hammond organ touches and the rather cute melody that manages to outdo Howards voice in terms of eager-eyedness, you totally buy into the spirited nature of whatever mental stimulation is supposed to be arising here.\n\nOh, and the album opener Conditioning is beautifully bouncy, speedy electropop, with sprightly staccatos, bleeps and bloops and off-kilter percussion and the almost gothic ambient-pop of Hide and Seek is dutifully enigmatic, bordering on darkwave territory, and to my mind remains Howards finest moment.\n\nDisc 2: CD - 2024 New Stereo Mix\n\n1.

She can sing anything and can morph into whatever the style is. Working together was a natural step, and the two went to work in April.\n\nThe result is a vibrant and cohesive album guided by self-reflection. I wanted it to be like a letter to myself, and how far Ive grown as an artist, the singer says. I want the world to see who April is and what that name invokes. Its a reflection of both my personality and the many feelings associated with the season of Spring. My goal was to showcase different emotional layers that people could resonate with.\n\n1. April Blues\n\n2. Ill Remember April\n\n3. Joy of April\n\n4. April Come She Will\n\n5. April Give Me One More Day\n\n6. April Again\n\n7. Sometimes It Snows In April\n\n8. Dear April\n\n9. April In Paris\n\n10. Lost April\n\n11. Who Let April Back Into My Dreams?\n\nThe brand new recording opens on the dulcet, upright bass-led April Blues and the gently fervent Ill Remember April and then we get brought forth the scat-introduced, latterly a sweepingly gorgeous Pat Metheny ballad Joy of April, her veritably shimmering take on Simon and Art Garfunkels April Come She Will and the all-embracing April Give Me One More Day.\n\nAlong next is the playfully perky, Hammond-hued April Again and the beautifully-sculpted Prince and the Revolution classic ballad Sometimes It Snows In April, and they are in turn backed seamlessly by Frank Oceans languishing Dear April, the twinkling April In Paris, the album rounding out on the low slung Lost April, closing on the ambiant Who Let April Back Into My Dreams?\n\nApril features pianist Caelan Cardello (who also is the album arranger), guitarist Russell Malone, bassist Reuben Rogers, drummer Miguel Russell, trumpeter and vocalist Benny Benack III, and tenor and soprano saxophonist Dayna Stephens. When choosing the band, Varner wanted to include musicians who had inspired her.\n\nVarners years-long history with Cardello and Russell particularly is displayed by their discernible interplay and tight musical connection. In selecting the guests, Owens Jr. played a significant role, in shaping the bandstand by suggesting players that would best complement the vocalist.\n\nMusicians:\n\nVocals: April Varner\n\nPiano: Caelan Cardello\n\nGuitar: Russell Malone\n\nBass: Reuben Rogers\n\nDrums: Miguel Russell\n\nTrumpet/Vocals: Benny Benack III\n\nTenor/Soprano Saxophone: Dayna Stephens\n\nVocal Arranging & Production on Dear April: Theo Bleckmann\n\nOfficial Purchase Link\n\nwww.aprilvarner.com\n\nTitle - Coração Vagabundo [Vagabond Heart]\n\nArtist - Rosemary Loar\n\nFor those unaware, Rosemary Loars influences are eclectic. Her first five years in New York City were spent performing a critically acclaimed jazz cabaret act, where she wrote the arrangements and broke new ground in what was then, a very homogenous venue. She left cabaret to go the the bigger stages of Broadway but has since returned.\n\nHer cabaret show When Harry Met The Duke was given a rave by BroadwayWorld.com which said the show was Out of this world and Loar.. has managed to come up with yet another variation, (on The Great American Songbook) and her erudite and accessibly sophisticated new show featuring wonderful jazz, pop, and Broadway songs from the 1930s-50s goes down well like a delicious vodka martini topped with a skewer of blue cheese-stuffed olives.\n\nMore recently Loar had her Joes Pub Debut with her latest cabaret creation STING*chronicity:v Loar doesnt simply rearrange numbers; she re-contextualizes them, morphing into a series of characters that sing each song as it arises out of an imagined situation.\n\nAs a commercial recording artist she can be heard on Stings soundtrack for the movie The Emperors New Groove, the cast albums of Chess and Sunset Boulevard and on the Listening Library series. Her debut CD of original music Alternative Torch was released in 1996, her second, Through Womens Eyes was produced in 1997 to benefit Susan G. Komen Foundation. Water From The Moon released in 2003 is also the score of Rosemarys original rock musical by the same name: produced by the Grammy award winning Joel Moss (soundtrack for Chicago).\n\nShe produced and wrote all the vocal and string arrangements for her fifth CD Indigo and Iridescent Rosemarys songs have been featured on NBCs The Today Show, on The Lifetime Network, at Town Hall, Joe Franklin and Joan Hamburg shows, at the UN Fourth Conference for Women in Beijing and in the documentary Our Daughters, Our Future narrated by Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nThe release of Rosemarys fourth CD, The Quando Swing punctuated her return to the jazz-cabaret scene in 2006 and features standards with a modern take. For Rosemary Loar, jazz is a smorgasbord, a feast of incredible tastes and textures. STING, STANG, STUNG, SWINGING THE MUSIC OF STING is a live recording of her critically acclaimed tribute to the pop icon Stings music.\n\nWith Rosemary having redefining the intersection between Jazz and the American songbook, we are next to be graced with her brand new recording, entitled Coração Vagabundo [aka Vagabond Heart].\n\nCoração Vagabundo is the latest example of Ms. Loars lifelong love of jazz, elegantly showcasing her ability to infuse the genre with international influences and traditional cabaret.\n\n1.

I love to prepare songs in ways that surprise and delight listeners, adding different variables and finding commonalities. I love blasting my trumpet over a hard grooving rhythm section. I love hearing horns in harmony and singing from a whisper to a roar, Skonberg reflects.\n\nIts a cathartic, soul-satisfying experience, and all Ive wanted to do since I first met the trumpet. This elation was, for Skonberg and others, poignantly put on hiatus with the onset of the global pandemic in 2020.\n\nBy January 2021, Skonberg had experienced the weight of the worldwide lockdown in a profound blend of emotions. From not having seen her parents in over a year and having interacted with other musicians less than ten times since the start of the lockdown, mingled with the kaleidoscopic wonder of becoming a new parent, Skonberg at once experienced the desolation of the depths of the worldwide sense of isolation while being beautifully overwhelmed with a new kind of love.\n\nWith this experiential context, when gigs finally did begin to return, Skonberg felt like I was trying to find a way back and a way forward at the same time. What proved deeply grounding for Skonberg amid this tumultuous societal return to normalcy was revisiting the material she had learned in her teens  classics like Louis Armstrongs Cornet Chop Suey  and immersing herself in lifelong musical favorites of her family, such as Van Morrison and The Beatles, and of her own, namely Wynton Marsaliss septet music.\n\nThis blend of worldwide trepidatious optimism, parental beauty, and the music that stirred Skonbergs soul from her teens through her adulthood led her to a place where she understood what her next project needed to be.\n\nAfter meeting and brainstorming with long-term mentor and friend, Producer Matt Pierson, Skonberg envisioned the project that now stands as What It Means, a love letter to the music and tradition of New Orleans that first inspired her.\n\n1. Comes Love (4:28) (Lew Brown, Sam Stept, Charles Tobias)\n\n2. Sweet Pea (3:40) (Amos Lee)\n\n3. Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans? (4:11) (Eddie DeLange, Louis Alter)\n\n4. The Beat Goes On (6:49) (Sonny Bono)\n\n5. In the House (6:21) (Bria Skonberg) 6. Cornet Chop Suey (4:43) (Louis Armstrong)\n\n7. Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy) (5:05) (John Lennon)\n\n8. Days Like This (featuring Gabrielle Cavassa) (3:20) (Van Morrison)\n\n9. Petite Fleur (4:36) (Sidney Bechet)\n\n10. Elbow Bump (7:03) (Bria Skonberg)\n\n11. Lullabye (Goodnight My Angel)/A Child is Born (4:29) (Billy Joel/Thad Jones)\n\nOn an album that oozes such an authentically felt New Orleans vibe throughout, allowing Skonberg to lean deeply into the power of meaningful and humble collaboration, the album opens on the slinky Comes Love and the playfully perky Amos Lee cut Sweet Pea and they are followed by the dulcet ballad Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?, a rousing rendition of the Sonny Bono cut The Beat Goes On, and then we are graced with her first original, the lushly elgant In the House.\n\nAlong next is the propulsive Louis Armstrong track Cornet Chop Suey and her delicate version of John Lennons sumptuously-sculpted Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy), and they are in turn backed by the upbeat and joyful Van Morrison track Days Like This (featuring Gabrielle Cavassa), a gorgeous, aching yearn of a take on Sidney Bechets Petite Fleur, the album rounding out on her other original, the fervently gleaming Elbow Bump, closing on the Billy Joel/Thad Jones combo ballad Lullabye (Goodnight My Angel)/A Child is Born.\n\nThe albums title holds layers of significance, both on an individual level and in recognizing jazz history  a truncated version of one of the most famous standards about the Crescent City: Do You Know What It Means To Miss New Orleans? By evoking this standard, Skonberg immediately aligns the album with the history and tradition of that great musical city.\n\nMoreover, by shortening the title to simply state What It Means, Skonberg turns it into a broader statement and call to her audience to recognize that which is important to each person. Skonberg herself addresses the topic from her perspective on the album. I am affirming what it means to me, she says. I care about family, I care about getting to make music that brings joy with other people, from a place that reveres its roots, and that looks forward to brighter days.\n\nwww.briaskonberg.com\n\nBria Skonberg @ Facebook\n\nBria Skonberg @ Instagram\n\nTitle - It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown [RSD]\n\nArtist - Vince Guaraldi\n\nIn celebration of the 55th anniversary of the timeless 6th animated Peanuts® special, It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown, the entire soundtrack [along with some never-before-heard Bonus Tracks not used in the Special] will be available exclusively at a participating record store starting April 20th, 2024 as part of Record Store Day.\n\nThis new extended version now comes complete with not only classic Peanuts themes and songs made directly for this special, but now includes 6 never-before heard takes that were not used in the special.\n\nGuaraldi lovingly created the soundtrack for the summer camp adventure where Charlie Brown and his gang face off against the girls camp lead by Peppermint Patty. The large jazz combo album also includes the best rendition of Guaraldi classic, Love Will Come (Nova Bossa) as well as the first use of additional percussion in Victor Feldman.\n\nThe recording features Guaraldi (piano), Monty Budwig (double bass), Jack Sperling (drums), Conti and Pete Candoli (trumpet), Frank Rosolino (trombone), Victor Feldman (percussion), Herb Ellis (guitar), Willian Hood and Peter Christlieb (woodwind), and John Scott Trotter as the orchestra leader. The soundtrack was produced by Sean Mendelson and Jason Mendelson and restored and re-mastered by Vinson Hudson.\n\nThis quite brilliantly organized special soundtrack opens on the beloved Charlie Brown Theme, the renowned Linus and Lucy piece and then we get the jaunty, titular run of It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown, the fun, playful Oh Good Grief, the romantically-charmed Youre In Love, Charlie Brown, the free-flowing Schroeder, and then we get the aptly-named Bus Blues (and reprise) thereafter.\n\nAlong next is a reprise of the titular It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown, the cute Frieda (With the Naturally Curly Hair) and a short reprise of Oh Good Grief, and then comes a cute collective: the more adamant Come and Get It, a most wondrous Hash and then Hash with Horn, before we are brought forth the perky AM Break and the upbeat Tah Dah.\n\nA resonant Bon Voyage and a romanticized Peppermint Patty are up next and in turn backed by an endearing Love Will Come (Nova Bossa), and then come a perkily emphatic Hes Your Dog, Charlie Brown, the smooth Pebble Beach, a short reprise of both Youre In Love, Charlie Brown and Hes Your Dog, Charlie Brown, and they are then themselves backed by a dashing Masked Marvel and the fluctuating Air Music.\n\nContinuing the musical adventure, along next are two more reprises of Masked Marvel and a reprise of Linus and Lucy, which are followed by a second reprise of Oh Good Grief, a short reprise of the Charlie Brown Theme, and a second reprise of It Was a Short Summer, this delightful musical flashback to a time less stressful, ending on the six bonus tracks: the lovely alternative take of Linus and Lucy, an interesting Working on It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown, the recording rounding out on alternative takes on Bus Blues, Pebble Beach, Masked Marvel Music and Linus and Lucy.\n\n1.

Produced by Gus Dudgeon (known for his work with Elton John) the album features the singles Song For You and The Right To Sing and now also comes with the addition of two non-LP, non-CD B-sides.\n\nDisc two is 1985s Transition album, released as the John Miles Band and appearing here on CD for the first time. It features the singles Blinded and I Need Your Love plus the non-LP non-CD Good So Bad among the bonus tracks.\n\nThe final disc is 1993s Upfront album which includes the singles What Goes Around, Oh How The Years Go By and One More Day.\n\nJust so we are all on the same page, John Miles was an English rock singer, guitarist and keyboard player best known for his 1976 top 3 UK hit single Music, which won an Ivor Novello Award, and his frequent appearances at Night of the Proms.\n\nHe also won the Outstanding Musical Achievement award at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards, and deservedly so, in my humble opinion, as this musician was far more than simply a one-hit wonder.\n\nDisc One: Play On (1983)\n\n1. Take Me To My Heaven\n\n2. Song For You\n\n3. It Wasnt Love At All\n\n4. Ready To Spread Your Wings\n\n5. Ill Never Do It Again\n\n6. Heart Of Stone\n\n7. Home\n\n8. Close Eyes, Count To Ten\n\n9. Carrie\n\n10. The Right To Sing\n\n11. Back To The Magic [Bonus Track]\n\n12. Thats Rock N Roll [Bonus Track]\n\nPlay On was actually the sixth solo album by Miles and released in 1983 via EMI label it was also one of his most beloved. It was also the first time that drummer Barry Black and bassist Bob Marshall were not used on the album (although Marshall still wrote the songs with Miles).\n\nInstead they were replaced by session musicians. The Right to Sing was the first single released from the album and was written about the fact that record companies wanted to decide which songs Miles had to release and which direction he had to take.\n\nAnother single, the catchy track Song For You became a small worldwide hit and was used as a soundtrack in TV commercials for cigarette brand Hollywood in Brazil and few other countries. Interestingly though, Thats Rock n Roll was left off the album because it was too different, and was subsequently released as a B-side.\n\nThe track Carrie was covered by The Hollies on the b-side of the 1988 re-release of their cover version of He Aint Heavy, Hes My Brother and on which Miles also sang backing vocals on.\n\nDisc Two: Transition (1985)\n\n1. Once In Your Life\n\n2. Run\n\n3. Blinded\n\n4. Youre The One\n\n5. I Need Your Love\n\n6. Hard Time\n\n7. Who Knows\n\n8. Dont Lie To Me\n\n9. Watching Over Me\n\n10. I Need Your Love (Edited Single Version) [Bonus Tack]\n\n11. Good So Bad [Bonus Track]\n\n12. Blinded (Special Cut Single Version) [Bonus Track]\n\nWhile some of the tracks here now have, shall we politely say, mildly dated, it is still a most gorgeous thing to hear the amount of synth used by this prog-lite rocker.\n\nIndeed, it is sometimes enough to make you raise an eyebrow, but the album has some other, rockier good moments, especially in the first half with tracks such as Run, Blinded and Youre The One. For me though, the ultimate highlight is the excellent banger of a track Blinded!\n\nFor the most part though, Miles isnt a particularly distinctive writer or guitarist and his blustery vocals are a bit much too take at times, although hes not as overblown and wayward here as he would be on Jimmy Pages Outrider album; but then again, no one was listening to Outrider for Miles vocals anyway.\n\nDisc Three: Upfront (1993)\n\n1. Everythings O.K.\n\n2. Cant Get Through\n\n3. One More Day Without Love\n\n4. Oh How The Years Go By\n\n5. What Goes Around\n\n6. Now That The Magic Has Gone\n\n7. Its Such A Mystery\n\n8. Body Of My Brunette\n\n9. Forever And Ever\n\n10. Its Not Over Yet\n\n11. Chains And Wild Horses\n\n12. Absent Hearts\n\n13. Pale Spanish Moon\n\n14. One More Day Without Love (Single Version) [Bonus Track]\n\n15. Oh How The Years Go By (Single Version) [Bonus Track]\n\n16. Its Such A Mystery (Single Version) [Bonus Track]\n\nThe songwriting here on Upfront is really bloody good, with Miles voice sounding strong and mature, and some of the guitar work quite easily being the best he had done in years.\n\nAs usual with Miles, it is on the ballads that his vocal range really shines and there are one or two truly beautiful ballads on here, such as Now That The Magic Has Gone, which is a dedicated stand out!\n\nJust to make this clear, this album was not rehash of his 70s work, but a very goo, clean cut album that will appeal to older John Miles fans, let alone all those who like artists such as Joe Bonamassa, John Mayer, Stevie Wonder, and Chris Rea.\n\nThe sleeve notes have been written by Stephen Carson who oversees the Official John Miles Facebook page and created the John Miles website below.\n\nJohn Miles - The Albums 1983-93 [3CD] (Official Trailer)\n\nOfficial Purchase Link\n\nwww.John-Miles.net\n\nTitle - Im Alive:The Don Fardon Anthology (1967-74) [3CD]\n\nArtist - Don Fardon\n\nFor those unaware, Don Fardon first tasted fame as the singer in Coventrys cult freakbeat legends The Sorrows, when their single, Take A Heart, made #21 in the UK chart in 1965.

Linus and Lucy (Acoustic Piano Mix)\n\nThis classic Peanuts® recording opens on the luxuriantly perky, short but sweet Incumbent Waltz, the quick, veritably chanted ode Youre Not Elected, Charlie Brown, the opulent piano piece Oh, Good Grief! and then we get given the aptly-titled ditty Cookin Snoopy (Fast Piano Jazz), the finger-snapper Blue Charlie Brown, and a dulcet reprise of Incumbent Waltz.\n\nAlong next is the jauntily fun Linus and Lucy / Poor Charlie Brown and the Randy Newman-esque Joe Cool (Vocal) and they are in turn backed by the second reprise of Incumbent Waltz, the free flowing Elect Linus (Dilemma) / Woodstocks Wake Up and both the smooth Joe Cool (Unused Reprise) and a delightful reprise of Oh, Good Grief!\n\nNext up is the spirited piano work that drives the blues-jazz cut Deserted Charlie Brown, a lush reprise of Youre Not Elected, Charlie Brown and a gently frenetic reprise of Linus and Lucy (Reprise), before we are greeted with the New Orleans-imbibed second reprise of Youre Not Elected, Charlie Brown (End Credits), and two alternate takes of Joe Cool, and one more of Blue Charlie Brown.\n\nThe recording then rounds out with the lovely to finally hear properly African Sleigh Ride and a fast piano jazz, alternate three takes of Cookin Snoopy, coming to a close on a trio of different takes and outtakes of Incumbent Waltz, and finally a rather delightful acoustic piano mix of Linus and Lucy.\n\nIn addition to the composers piano playing, guitar and vocals, the maestros cabinet (band) is comprised of legends who lent their talents for this wonderful campaign. The music will get you in a great mood for any election.\n\nThe album was remixed at Bones and Knives by Terry Carleton, and restored and mastered by Vinson Hudson, and produced by Sean Mendelson and Jason Mendelson.\n\nThe album will be available on CD, Vinyl, and digital.

Both the CD and Vinyl include art from the special and liner notes that give a track-by-track analysis by Derrick Bang (author of Vince Guaraldi at the Piano) and notes by Sean and Jason Mendelson, sons of Peanuts® producer Lee Mendelson and album producers.\n\nOfficial Purchase Link\n\nwww.mvdshop.com\n\nTitle - Cockney Rejects: Greatest Hits Vol.1 + Vol.2\n\nArtist - Cockney Rejects\n\nFor those unaware, rarely in the long history of British rocknroll has there been a story of such depth, magnitude and sheer turbulence as that of the Cockney Rejects.\n\nThe band were formed in the late Seventies in East London as an answer to the art school punk that had dominated the scene up until then.\n\nFiercely working class in stance and attitude, the band eschewed the political ramblings of punks first wave and sang about the circumstances that surrounded them and millions of street kids in Britains inner cities- Police harassment, street battles and football to name three.\n\nSigned by EMI after playing four local gigs (less than the pistols!) they found themselves playing sell out tours the length and breadth of the UK and seeing their debut album storm the charts.\n\nTop of the pops appearances followed, which became the stuff of legend as the band generally ran amok in the hallowed White city studios, finally getting banned from the show for their boisterous behavior.\n\nIn 1980 the band recorded a riotous version of Im forever blowing bubbles to celebrate the fact that their belov"
