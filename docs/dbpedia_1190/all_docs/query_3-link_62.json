        "text": "When is it?\n\nNightLife is every* Thursday from 6-10 pm. Last entry into the building is 9 pm. All guests must be 21+ with valid, physical photo ID.\n\n*Well, *almost* every Thursday. We hibernate for the holidays from mid-December through early-January, and there are a couple other NightLife-less Thursdays during the year due to other events in the building.\n\nAre all exhibitions open?\n\nEverything that’s open during the day is open during NightLife, but please note that our rainforest and gem exhibitions have reduced hours:\n\nOsher Rainforest closes at 7:45 pm, with last entry at 7:30 pm. It’s one of our most popular exhibitions, so please queue up early if you want to trek through the tropics. (Our free-flying birds and butterflies operate on a different schedule than night owls like you—thanks for understanding.)\n\nGems and Minerals Unearthed opens at 8:30 pm. It is reserved for NightLife Plus guests from 6-8:30 pm.\n\nHow much are tickets?\n\nNightLife ticket prices vary by event, but are always lower than daytime prices. While we love spontaneity, a little planning pays off in three ways: You’ll save an average of $3+ per ticket when you buy 3+ days in advance; you’ll skip the ticket line at the door; and you’ll guarantee your tickets, because sellouts do happen.\n\nHow do I see a planetarium show?\n\nMorrison Planetarium passes are not included with NightLife admission, and are sold separately for $5 each. When purchasing NightLife tickets online, you’ll be prompted to add an available showtime to your cart. Shows are at 6:30, 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30 pm unless otherwise noted.\n\nHeads up:\n\nPlease queue up at the planetarium 15 minutes before your showtime. For your safety, there is no late entry into the theater once shows have started.\n\nPlanetarium passes almost always sell out in advance, so we strongly recommend purchasing them online instead of hoping for a miracle at the museum. A limited number of standby seats will be available for all showtimes on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nHow can I find out which shows are playing during NightLife before I purchase a pass?\n\nA weekly program schedule, including planetarium shows, is available on each NightLife event page. Please note: Scheduled programming is subject to change prior to each event date.\n\nWhat happens if I miss my reserved showtime? Can I exchange or get a refund?\n\nRefunds are not available for planetarium passes. If you miss your reserved showtime or arrive after the planetarium doors have closed, our staff will do their best to accommodate you at a later show if space permits. If you know you won’t be able to attend the event or would like to exchange for a different showtime, we are happy to exchange your planetarium pass for another date or time up to three days in advance of the event date. After that time, no exchanges can be made.\n\nI’ve already purchased a NightLife Plus ticket. Do I still need to purchase a reserved planetarium pass?\n\nNope, all NightLife Plus tickets include entry to the 8:30 pm planetarium show.\n\nWhere can I get a drink?\n\nBars are located on the Main Floor (usually in the Piazza and next to the Swamp) and downstairs in the aquarium, with beer and wine available for sale in the Academy Café. Our friendly bartenders sling a smorgasbord of specialty cocktails, craft beer, and delicious wines, plus a variety of non-alcoholic beverages. Pay with cash, card, or Apple Pay. *Clink!*\n\nWhere can I grab some food?\n\nThe Academy Café offers a range of grab-and-go options, from pizza and pasta to salads and sandwiches. Some events have a food theme, with samples and munchies available while supplies last.\n\nCan I eat and drink throughout the museum?\n\nYes and no. You’re welcome to roam around with your drink everywhere except the planetarium, rainforest, and Swamp, but can only eat in the Academy Café or outdoors.\n\nNightlife is supported by Local Motion® Vodka Sodas, light, refreshing, and simply made with vodka, carbonated water, and natural flavors. Grab a can of Local Motion® at bars throughout NightLife this year!"
