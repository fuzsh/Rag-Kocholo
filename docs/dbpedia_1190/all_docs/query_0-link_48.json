        "text": "Hey there, time traveller!\n\nThis article was published 25/06/2020 (1522 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.\n\nBack in 2017, a crew of musically inclined Free Press staffers and freelancers was asked to create a list of Canada’s 150 most important songs, in honour of our fair country’s sesquicentennial anniversary.\n\nThe process was long and arduous, and though we were all ultimately incredibly proud of the outcome, we had little desire to take on a project of that magnitude again.\n\nFlash-forward to early in 2020, pre-pandemic, when enterprise editor Scott Gibbons did a brisk walk by my desk to suggest we get the team back together and create a similar list for Manitoba’s 150. He knew it was a big ask, hence the pace of his stride, but the desire to highlight (and find a practical use for our knowledge about) 150 Manitoba-made songs outweighed any hesitation we previously had.\n\nSo, get the gang back together we did. This time, our expert panel consisted of me, writer Jill Wilson, arts reporter Alan Small, copy editor Rob Williams, columnist Jen Zoratti, arts reporter Eva Wasney, books and drinks editor Ben Sigurdson, managing editor for Canstar News John Kendle and writer David Sanderson.\n\nIn early May, we gathered together, this time on a Zoom call in order to adhere to social-distancing directives, and got to work narrowing down more than 250 potential songs to our final list of 150. Two hour-long video meetings, countless emails, a handful of vocal disagreements and a few last-minute changes later, we have the finished product.\n\nFor this list, we decided each artist could have up to three songs, but as it turned out, only the Guess Who ended up with a trio of tracks.\n\nWe also decided not to include Neil Young. We know, we know — it’s a controversial decision, but we’re letting you know now so you don’t incredulously scroll through looking for Heart of Gold or Harvest Moon. The Squires are there, though. And there’s a sidebar about Young. We are not so cruel as to cut him out completely.\n\nLike last time, the Top 10 was compiled using a super-secret email ballot system; American Woman by the Guess Who and One Great City! by the Weakerthans tied for first place.\n\nWe’ve all spent the last few weeks writing away, providing context for each of our 150 song selections, so we hope you’ll keep an open mind as you read through our picks for Manitoba’s most important 150 songs and listen to the playlists. We encourage you all to air your grievances and/or support our choices in the comments below.\n\n— Erin Lebar\n\nTHE TOP 10\n\nAmerican Woman — The Guess Who\n\nAmerican Woman (1970)\n\nIt’s hard to imagine now — as Winnipeg’s most famous rock musicians seem to have been grizzled veterans forever — but Randy Bachman, Burton Cummings, Jim Kale and Garry Peterson were in their early 20s when they hit upon the riff that became Manitoba’s most memorable rock song.\n\nThe precise details of the origins of American Woman have been lost in time but the gist of the story remains the same — the song’s familiar riff and many of the lyrics came about in a live jam after singer Burton Cummings was late returning to the stage for the second show of a gig at a curling club in southern Ontario in 1968.\n\nAt the time, Bachman would have been 24, Cummings just 20, Kale was also 24 and Peterson was 23. They were a tight-knit musical unit but only just coming into their own as songwriters and recording artists.\n\nCummings has said he was outside the hall, chatting with a fan, when he heard Randy Bachman’s guitar fire up, with bassist Kale and drummer Peterson quickly falling into a groove behind him. Bachman told biographer John Einarson in Randy Bachman: Takin’ Care of Business that he liked the impromptu chord sequence he came up with while testing a changed string, so the trio kept the jam going as the singer scrambled onstage and began improvising lyrics.\n\nA kid in the hall had fortuitously recorded the set on an early-model cassette recorder so, after the show, when they realized they might be on to something, the quartet sent a roadie to retrieve the tape. Cummings said most of the key lines were all there — “all that stuff about war machines and ghetto scenes, coloured lights that hypnotize…”\n\nThe band recorded American Woman on Aug. 13, 1969, at the RCA Mid-America Recording Center in Chicago, with Jack Richardson producing, as part of the sessions for the American Woman album, which was released in January 1970. With its bluesy acoustic guitar intro and vampy Cummings vocal, the full-length version of the tune clocked in at 5:15, while the edited version that was released as a single was just 3:51.\n\nNo Time was actually the first single from the American Woman album, and it did well, hitting No. 1 in Canada and No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, but when the album’s title song was released in March 1970, it began a climb up the U.S. singles chart that peaked on May 9, 1970.\n\nAt No. 3 on the singles chart that week was the Beatles’ Let it Be. The No. 2 song, which had held top spot the previous week, was ABC by the Jackson 5. No. 1 was American Woman, a song by four kids from Winnipeg who cut their teeth playing community club dances in the mid-1960s. When they heard the news, they celebrated by jumping up and down on the bed in a Chicago hotel room.\n\n— John Kendle\n\nOne Great City! — The Weakerthans\n\nReconstruction Site (2003)\n\nHow perfect is it that the song that shares top spot on this list with the Guess Who name-checks them — and decrees that they suck?\n\nThe Weakerthans’ most sung-along and requested song, One Great City!, which appeared on the band’s third record, 2003’s Reconstruction Site, started as a writing exercise by singer/songwriter John K. Samson. “Christine (Fellows, Samson’s partner) and I would each write a song every day for five days. At the end of the day we’d record them, share them with each other and critique them,” Samson explains. “I was coming up with nothing that day; it was nearing the end of the day, so I had to come up with something. I wrote a verse-chorus-verse-chorus of this song and recorded it, and sort of thought of it as a little jokey song.”\n\nA friend who heard the recording convinced Samson to finish the tune over the next couple of weeks. After Reconstruction Site was released, One Great City! quickly became the Weakerthans’ signature song. Samson’s lyrics chronicle a laundry list of common gripes, stereotypes and (sometimes) misnomers about our city, sung over a simple finger-picked acoustic guitar riff. The singalong part drops during the chorus when he sings “I hate Winnipeg.”\n\nThe song has led to many misconceptions about Samson’s feelings about the city.\n\n“The song is about the pitfalls of boosterism, and trying to be honest with who we are, where we’re from, and also the kind of right and duty to critique the place you’re from,” he says. “Also I think of it as a song about cherishing the things that are good about the place and not knocking them down.\n\n“When I sing ‘The Guess Who suck, the Jets were lousy anyway,’ what I’m trying to say is that the Guess Who are kind of amazing, and uniquely Winnipeg, and something we should actually cherish. And that the Jets, the original Jets, being lousy was actually kind of beautiful.”\n\nNo matter where the Weakerthans would play, it was a sure thing fans would heartily belt out the chorus, whether they’d ever been to Winnipeg or not.\n\n“I guess what they relate to, I think, is their own homes, the kind of uniqueness of the place they’re from — I feel like that’s perhaps what they’re thinking when they sing ‘I Hate Winnipeg’ is ‘I Hate (place name here),’” Samson muses. “And there’s something kind of liberating about that, in a way.”\n\nOne Great City! is still a staple in Samson’s set list whenever he plays — and he doesn’t mind a bit. “I think a lot of songwriters have a song they have to play every night. I’m grateful,” he says, adding with a laugh, “It’s not like it’s American Pie — it’s not 12 minutes long.”\n\n— Ben Sigurdson\n\nTakin’ Care of Business — Bachman-Turner Overdrive\n\nBachman-Turner Overdrive II (1973)\n\nWhat separates Randy Bachman from most other rock stars of the 1960s and ’70s are his recollections of those crazy days. He says he hasn’t had a drink since he was 21 and never took any drugs, so there’s no haze of substance abuse impairing his memory like many of his contemporaries.\n\nWhen it comes to Takin’ Care of Business, which spent 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and has been used in countless movies and television shows, there’s the legendary song and then there is the song’s urban legend. The way Bachman tells it — he’s a great storyteller at his concerts and on his CBC radio show Vinyl Tap — you got to believe him, right?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4sI5DG5sjc\n\nTakin’ Care of Business originally began during Bachman’s days with the Guess Who, the story goes, and he originally titled the song White Collar Worker. No one else in the band went for it, and eventually, he left the group. A few years later, he formed Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, and that tune returned — with a new catchy title — when Turner, BTO’s lead vocalist, lost his voice late in a show, according to liner notes written by Winnipeg historian John Einarson for the band’s 40th anniversary CD.\n\nThe crowd loved it, so off to the studio they went. Bachman says in a video for Toronto radio station Boom 97.3 that a pizza delivery guy entered their Seattle studio and heard them recording the song and said it needed a piano.\n\nThe pizza guy played the piano on one take — the one BTO’s manager loved — and the song became a hit. The pianist/pizza guy turned out to be Norman Durkee, who went on to perform with Bette Midler, and a host of musicals on the West Coast and was a longtime fixture on the Seattle music scene.\n\nA 2014 obit for Durkee in the Seattle Times says the pizza story is an urban legend, instead saying the pianist and was spontaneously recruited by Bachman-Turner Overdrive for the track.\n\nThe urban legend is a great tale though, and it keeps Takin’ Care of Business to this day.\n\n— Alan Small\n\nLife Is a Highway — Tom Cochrane\n\nMad, Mad World (1991)\n\nThere’s a recurring joke on the sitcom How I Met Your Mother that revolves around a cassette of the Proclaimers’ Sunshine on Leith album that is stuck in the tape deck of a character’s car. On road trips, passengers cycle through rage and delight when the familiar single I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) inevitably makes its appearance, alternating between stony-faced disgust or head-bopping happiness.\n\nTom Cochrane’s massive 1991 single — inspired by a famine-relief trip with World Vision to East Africa — strikes a similar nerve. Its sheer ubiquity in the years since its chart-topping release means that sometimes, merely hearing the first (instantly recognizable) bars can have you lunging for the radio off switch.\n\nOther times — not coincidentally, often when you’re driving down a highway on a sunny day, wind in your hair — it just hits that pop-rock sweet spot and you’re belting out the chorus at the top of your lungs.\n\nThe track, from his diamond-selling Mad Mad World album, was the biggest international hit the pride of Lynn Lake would ever have; it hit No. 6 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and was covered by Rascal Flatts for the Cars soundtrack. It won Cochrane the Juno for Single of the Year in 1992; he was nominated for a Grammy for Male Rock Vocal Performance in ‘93.\n\nIt’s easy to be disdainful of the trite metaphor of the title and the platitudinous lyrics, which Cochrane said were his attempt to find some kind of hope amid the poverty he witnessed in Africa. But more often, the chugging harmonica, the propulsive guitar, gang vocals and skilfully crafted singalong chorus take over, and you’re like, “Tom, my man, you’re so right. Life IS a highway. And I AM going to ride it all night long.”\n\n— Jill Wilson\n\nA Plea from a Cat Named Virtute — The Weakerthans\n\nReconstruction Site (2003)\n\nStanding out among John K. Samson’s many lyrical achievements is this: a song from the point of view of a cat who is frustrated with the self-sabotage and unhealthy coping mechanisms of her depressed owner.\n\nA centrepiece of the Weakerthans’ landmark 2003 album Reconstruction Site, A Plea from a Cat Named Virtute is a study in juxtapositions. It’s a driving, propulsive rocker with all the emotional heft of a ballad. It’s literally from the perspective of a cat — “Why don’t you ever want to play? I’m tired of this piece of string” — but it’s not cutesy.\n\nLiving with depression is horrible; living next to it is horrible, too. Virtute embodies that helplessness and powerlessness to help. She’s desperate for her owner to see themselves as she sees them, but she’s limited in how she can express herself.\n\nI swear I’m going to bite you hard/And taste your tinny blood\n\nIf you don’t stop the self-defeating lies/You’ve been repeating since the day you brought me home\n\nI know you’re strong\n\nStrength is a through-line in the song. Virtute, which was sometimes wrongly transposed as “Virtue” in early reviews, is Latin for “strength.” Look closely at the City of Winnipeg’s coat of arms and you’ll see that word in the motto: “unum cum virtute multorum,” or “one with the strength of many.” Here, though, Virtute’s name is less of a Winnipeg reference and more about how someone (a person, a cat) can be strong for someone else.\n\nVirtute the cat would go on to make two more appearances in the Weakerthans catalogue: the devastating Virtute the Cat Explains Her Departure, from 2007’s Reunion Tour, and — steel yourself — Virtute at Rest, from Samson’s 2016 solo album, Winter Wheat. (Another song from that album, 17th Street Treatment Centre, is thought to be something of a compendium from the owner’s point of view; “sang the one about the spring the cat ran away/on the 21st day of my court-ordered stay, here.”)\n\nShe may be a cat, but Virtute’s plea will be heartbreakingly familiar to anyone who has ever loved someone who can’t quite find their way out of the darkness.\n\n— Jen Zoratti\n\nBack to the Motor League — Propagandhi\n\nToday’s Empires, Tomorrow’s Ashes (2001)\n\nA savage attack on the music scene, this track has Portage la Prairie-born vocalist-guitarist Chris Hannah fantasizing about going back to his former job at CAA instead of dealing with people who are just out to party mindlessly with no thought given to the deeper messages in the band’s music.\n\n“Once thought I drew a lucky hand/ Turned out to be a live grenade of play-acting anarchists and Mommy’s-little-skinheads/ Death-threats and sycophants and wieners drunk on straight-edge,” Hannah sings while later taking shots at nu-metal, Christian hardcore, college rock and “floor-punching macho pabulum” among other targets, while throwing in a couple of Dead Kennedys references for good measure.\n\nThe thrash-punk track is off the band’s 2001 release Today’s Empires, Tomorrow’s Ashes, which saw Hannah and drummer Jord Samolesky joined by new bassist Todd Kowalski (ex I-Spy).\n\nThe song showcases the band’s propensity to forgo a regular verse/chorus/verse structure, instead piling on different musical sections and ideas that build towards a frenzied guitar-solo climax/rant, ending with a quote from Sioux leader Crazy Horse.\n\nWhereas the band’s first two releases were steeped in the punk-pop genre, Today’s Empires… adds more of the band members’ metal influences into the mix while still keeping things melodic and political, touching on topics such as feminism, veganism, immigration, war, murders of political activists and the story of East Timor’s Bella Gahlos, who was forced to undergo forced sterilization when the country was invaded by Indonesia in 1975.\n\nIt’s not easy listening; more like essential listening.\n\n— Rob Williams\n\nSuperman’s Song — Crash Test Dummies\n\nThe Ghosts That Haunt Me (1991)\n\nBrad Roberts was moved to write Superman’s Song after he saw Lyle Lovett perform at a workshop at the Winnipeg Folk Festival in 1988.\n\nAt the time, Lovett, a high-haired singer-songwriter from Texas, was just breaking onto the national and international scene with Pontiac, his debut album for MCA Records, and Roberts was a bright, well-read, 24-year-old University of Winnipeg grad who was getting serious about Crash Test Dummies, the band he’d formed with friends at the legendary Blue Note Café on Main Street.\n\nBrad had been trying to write his own songs for a while but hadn’t come up with anything he really liked or felt confident about.\n\nThat Sunday morning, though, as Roberts watched Lovett perform accompanied only by cellist John Hagen, he was struck by the simplicity of Lovett’s musical delivery and the wry wit of the carefully parsed lyrics in songs such as If I Had a Boat, She’s No Lady and Give Back My Heart.\n\nInspired, Roberts spent the next week crafting his wistful tale of Superman, the DC Comics superhero who, in Brad’s vision, lived the quiet life of a real gent when he wasn’t saving the world from Solomon Grundy. Compared to Tarzan, the song surmised, Superman never really got to enjoy the spoils of his exploits.\n\nWritten for just Brad’s guitar, Ellen Reid’s piano and cello, Superman’s Song was an immediate showstopper in the Dummies’ live sets and Roberts soon followed it up with several other tunes that formed the basis of a five-song demo tape that prompted a Canadian music industry feeding frenzy in early 1989.\n\nThe group signed with BMG Music Canada that fall and, after recording and mixing its debut album, The Ghosts That Haunt Me, with producer Steve Berlin (of Los Lobos) at Winnipeg’s Wayne Finucan Studios in May 1990, the Dummies were signed to Clive Davis’ prestigious Arista label in the U.S.\n\nThe Ghosts That Haunt Me was released on March 25, 1991, with Superman’s Song as its first single. While Canadian radio was extremely kind to the Dummies, it was the video for Superman’s Song, based on Reid’s concept of aging, downtrodden superheroes attending Superman’s funeral, that really propelled the success of the tune. The clip, directed by Dale Heslip, won the MuchMusic Video Music Award for best video of 1991.\n\nInterestingly, Superman’s Song only reached No. 4 on the Canadian singles chart in 1991 (that was the year of Tom Cochrane’s Life Is a Highway and Bryan Adams’ Waking Up the Neighbours), but The Ghosts That Haunt Me went on to sell 400,000 copies in Canada alone (that’s four times platinum) and the Dummies won the Juno Award for group of the year in March 1992.\n\nThey were on their way to even bigger things…\n\n— John Kendle\n\nJuniper — Begonia\n\nLady in Mind (2017)\n\nWhen singer-songwriter Alexa Dirks emerged as a solo artist under the name Begonia, longtime fans weren’t sure what to expect from the woman who had spent the majority of her career as part of a various groups, most recently the Juno Award-winning roots/pop band Chic Gamine.\n\nThen she released her first single, Juniper, and it was clear she was onto something good.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just local fans who took notice of Dirks and her unmistakable set of pipes; after its release, Juniper ended up topping the CBC Radio 2 national chart, allowing ears all over the country to jump on the Begonia bandwagon.\n\n“To be honest, I never anticipated this song being embraced by people in the way that it has been,” Dirks wrote in an email to the Free Press.\n\n“Once CBC picked it up and added it to the national charts, the streaming numbers started going up and I noticed people really attaching themselves to it, the song took on a whole new meaning for me. I started hearing it differently than when I first wrote it.”\n\nDespite its boppy melodies and anthemic, fun qualities, Juniper discusses some pretty deep themes of insecurity and “imposter syndrome,” Dirks explains. The chorus, which sparks singalongs wherever it is played, was built to serve that exact function; to offer a moment of joy even while singing lyrics that are covering some hard emotional ground.\n\n“I remember the first time I played it at a local festival, I was walking back to my campsite the day after my set and heard a group of people yell-singing the chorus from across the campground and I was stopped in my tracks. It totally freaked me out in the best way possible,” Dirks says.\n\n“It felt like we had achieved exactly what we wanted to achieve and it was so magical and special. That’s what’s so beautiful about music: you can write something with one intention and then once it’s out in the world, people get to interpret it however is most meaningful for them.\n\nHearing people sing along to my songs, especially Juniper as it was the first one I ever released as Begonia… it’s so humbling and sweet. It never gets old for me!”\n\nBegonia recently claimed a spot on the 2020 Polaris Music Prize long list with her debut full-length album, Fear.\n\n— Erin Lebar\n\nSmokes ‘N Chicken — The Perpetrators\n\nStick ‘Em Up (2013)\n\nThe veteran blues-rock trio, fronted by guitar wizard Jason Nowicki, delivers an autobiographical tale about two different times Nowicki had a gun pulled on him in Winnipeg.\n\nNowicki describes the incidents in reverse, first going into the details about an attempted mugging outside of a 7-Eleven on Day Street and Regent Avenue when a male who’d just robbed the store came up behind him in the parking lot, stuck a gun in his back and asked for the $20 he had just seen Nowicki put in his pants after buying cigarettes and chicken.\n\n“I decided not to go along with the plan. I’m going to play crazy,” Nowicki said in a recent interview. “I raised up my Benson and Hedges and was shifting them from side to side, looking him dead in the eye, and I said, ‘I spent all my money on smokes and chicken.’ He knew I was lying but he wasn’t going to shoot me for 20 bucks.”\n\nThe line turned into the chorus, while the verses of the song are more of a spoken-word rap.\n\nThe second incident documented in the tune happened when Nowicki and a friend were accosted on Portage Avenue across from the University of Winnipeg by two men who had just robbed the video store around the corner. The men stole the car keys from Nowicki’s friend, but couldn’t drive standard, so fled on foot and continued their crime spree.\n\nWhile many Perpetrators songs lean toward the electric Chicago blues tradition, Smokes ‘N Chicken is written in a Mississippi country-blues style with a one-chord motif and slide riff by Nowicki, while bassist Ryan Menard and drummer Ken McMahon keep things together.\n\nOn 2013’s Stick ‘Em Up album, Nowicki is banging on a single piano key while producer Len Milne is deadening the string inside the piano for some extra thump.\n\nThe crowd favourite remains a staple of the band’s live show.\n\n— Rob Williams\n\nThe Cat Came Back – Fred Penner\n\nThe Cat Came Back (1979)\n\nThe cat kept coming back to Fred Penner. Some might say the song just couldn’t stay away.\n\nWhile the Winnipeg-born children’s entertainer didn’t write the tune that launched his career, he has certainly made it his own over the last four decades.\n\nPenner was a pre-teen when he first heard The Cat Came Back sung by American country musician Sonny James — a major chord, bluegrass-y version of the original song written in 1893 by Harry S. Miller.\n\nThe song, which Penner takes as a metaphor for overcoming adversity, resurfaced when he was flipping through a folksong book during a jam session in the 1970s.\n\n“I turned the page and there was The Cat Came Back,” says Penner from his home in Vancouver Island. “It had a really lovely storytelling quality to it and that’s the thing that really drew me to the song.”\n\nWhen he got the opportunity to record his first full-length album, it was obvious which song would be the title track.\n\nThe Cat Came Back was released in 1979; Penner was in the midst of a cross-country 40th anniversary tour when the coronavirus pandemic cut the program short in March. The multi-generational “Fred Heads” who were present at the first few shows are indicative of the tune’s longevity.\n\n“It started off with the baby boomers back in the ’80s and then it blossomed into those children growing into adulthood and having their own children,” he says. “That circle has been completed many times over.”\n\nPenner closes most concerts with The Cat Came Back and has never tired of playing it — likely because he keeps inventing new verses about topics like Christmas and outer space.\n\n“Whenever I write, I try to do it in a way that is exciting to me,” he says. “Then it inspires me to bring it to the audience with that same kind of energy.”\n\n— Eva Wasney\n\n140 MORE\n\nRed River Jig — Andy De Jarlis\n\nAndy De Jarlis and his Early Settlers (1964)\n\nWinnipeg music teacher and three-time Canadian grand master fiddle champion Patti Kusturok once posted a series of videos on YouTube entitled 365 Days of Fiddle Tunes, a year-long tribute to her instrument.\n\nOn Day 19 of her odyssey, Kusturok tore through Red River Jig, a traditional tune once recorded by Andy De Jarlis, one of Manitoba’s most renowned fiddle players.\n\nDe Jarlis, born Joseph Desjarlais in 1914, grew up in the southeast part of the province, near Woodridge. A major influence on Métis fiddlers, De Jarlis had already won 20 Canadian fiddling titles when he embarked on a successful recording career in the mid-50s.\n\nHe released 37 albums under his own name before his death in 1975; he was awarded the Manitoba Centennial Medal in 1970.\n\nHard to Get — Gisele MacKenzie\n\nReleased as a single (1955)\n\nGisele MacKenzie, born in Winnipeg in 1927, was often called Canada’s first lady of song. MacKenzie, also an actor who went on to guest-star in episodes of Murder She Wrote and MacGyver, began her career as a concert violinist. After moving to the United States in 1950, she traded in her bow for a microphone, singing first with the Percy Faith Orchestra and later the Bob-Cats, a swing outfit led by Bob Crosby, the younger brother of Bing.\n\nIn 1954 MacKenzie headed into the studio to record her debut album. Hard to Get, a track written by American composer Jack Segal, climbed all the way to No. 5 on the American Billboard chart, thanks in large part to her performance of the song on Your Hit Parade, a popular variety show that aired on NBC-TV from 1950 to 1958.\n\nYesterdays Today — The Fifth\n\nReleased as a single (1967)\n\nDuring the mid- to late 1960s, Winnipeg was categorized as Liverpool West owing to a plethora of British-influenced acts, most of which recorded for Franklin Records, a local label founded by entertainment booking agent Frank Wiener. The Fifth, one of Franklin’s most popular artists, may well have been the only rock and roll outfit to chart internationally that called Winnipeg Beach home.\n\nThe group’s breakout single, Yesterdays Today, was recorded in Toronto in 1967 for the London label, which counted the Rolling Stones among its clients.\n\nThe Byrds-like song created enough buzz that the Fifth was subsequently booked to open for, among others, Sonny and Cher, Paul Revere and the Raiders, and the Roger McGuinn-led Byrds themselves.\n\nThese Eyes — The Guess Who\n\nWheatfield Soul (1968)\n\nBefore American Woman, there was These Eyes, the Guess Who’s first single with Burton Cummings as singer, taken from the Wheatfield Soul album.\n\nThe ballad was originally conceived by guitarist Randy Bachman around its basic chord structure and the phrase “these arms,” which Cummings took and modified into the now-familiar lyrics.\n\nRecorded with producer Jack Richardson, the tune features a strings-and-horns arrangement by Ben McPeek and was the band’s first big American success, reaching No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and going on to sell more than a million copies\n\nUntil It’s Time for You to Go — Juliette\n\nJuliette (1968)\n\nBefore there was Madonna, Beyoncé and Prince, artists famous enough to go by one name, there was Juliette, born Juliette Augustina Sysak in St. Vital in 1926. Juliette, nicknamed “our pet,” was a double threat: the host of her own TV shows (Juliette and Juliette and Friends) and a recording star to boot.\n\nHer 1968 debut album contains her best-known song, a wistful cover of Buffy Sainte-Marie’s Until It’s Time for You to Go. Juliette, a member of both the Order of Canada and Canada’s Walk of Fame, died in Vancouver, her longtime home, in 2017 at the age of 91.\n\nLove Is a Beautiful Thing — Gettysbyrg Address\n\nReleased as a single (1967)\n\nThe lead track on the 2008 double CD The Best of Franklin Records, an exhaustive collection chronicling Winnipeg’s 1960s and early ’70s rock ‘n’ roll heyday, is the Gettysbyrg Address’s debut single, Love is a Beautiful Thing.\n\nA cover of a Young Rascals tune written by Felix Cavaliere, it’s one of those rare interpretations that almost causes you to forget the original. Purposely misspelled, Gettysbyrg Address included future Guess Who members Kurt Winter and Bill Wallace.\n\nFurthermore, Love Is a Beautiful Thing was produced by a then-24-year-old Randy Bachman. The tune climbed all the way to No. 3 on the Canadian charts.\n\nFunny Day — Mongrels\n\nReleased as a single (1968)\n\nIn 1968, Dick Clark, host of the ultra-popular TV series American Bandstand, played Winnipeg band the Mongrels’ latest single, Funny Day, penned by Randy Bachman, during the rate-a-record portion of his show, a segment when Clark would poll the studio audience, asking if they felt this song or that was going to ascend the charts.\n\nUnfortunately, Funny Day got a thumbs-down, recalls Winnipeg media personality and ex-Mongrels drummer Joey Gregorash.\n\nHere’s the amusing part of the story: when the Mongrels broke into Funny Day during a show at the River Heights Community Centre the same night that particular Bandstand episode aired, all the teenagers on the dance floor kiddingly mimicked the sound of a buzzer, the sound effect used on Bandstand when a song didn’t receive a passing grade.\n\nThe Cruel War — Sugar & Spice\n\nReleased as a single (1969)\n\nAt the height of the Vietnam War, Sugar & Spice, an eight-member ensemble, headed into the studio to record The Cruel War, an antiwar anthem written by Peter, Paul and Mary’s Peter Yarrow.\n\nGiven radio listeners’ immediate reaction to their rendition of the song, Sugar & Spice seemed on the verge of worldwide success… until Yarrow, whose name was inexplicably left off the Sugar & Spice release, threatened to sue the band and its label.\n\nNot wanting a fuss, the band pulled all copies of the single from record stores. Michael Gillespie, Sugar & Spice’s manager at the time, says he could “write a book” about The Cruel War. He may get his chance; 50 years after the legal dispute, Gillespie is preparing to re-release the tune, along with a host of other Sugar & Spice tracks recorded during the same turbulent era.\n\nMoody Manitoba Morning — Rick Neufeld\n\nHiway Child (1970)\n\nA bit like the way grade schoolers from coast to coast had to learn Bobby Gimby’s Ca-na-da in 1967 in celebration of Canada’s centennial, students attending class in Manitoba in 1970 were taught Rick Neufeld’s Moody Manitoba Morning — all about grass a-growin’ and sun’s a-glowin’— to mark the province’s 100th birthday.\n\nNeufeld, a folksinger who grew up near Boissevain, wrote Moody Manitoba Morning in the late ‘60s. A Top 10 hit for Montreal-based the Five Bells in 1969, Neufeld recorded it for his debut album Hiway Child.\n\nMoody Manitoba Morning surfaced again on the his 1978 release, Manitobasongs, alongside other provincially inspired ditties such as Flin Flon Gone, Souris Valley River and The People in the Pas.\n\nJodie — Joey Gregorash\n\nNorth Country Funk (1971)\n\nFun fact: Joey Gregorash has a son named Jody, born nearly a decade after his first big hit made him a Canadian household name in the early 1970s.\n\nFirst appearing on Gregorash’s 1971 album North Country Funk, Jodie has a decidedly CCR-ish feel to it, with lyrics that were very much of the time: “Jodie is a good name/For people who are free/’Cause Jodie stands for freedom/Whatever Jodie be,” Gregorash sings over the mid-tempo country-tinged rocker.\n\nGregorash scored another big hit with Together (The New Wedding Song), but Jodie was the song that nearly took his music career to the next level. He eventually dropped off the music scene to pursue a career in local radio and TV (most notably S’Kiddle Bits on CKY in the mid-’80s).\n\nUndun — The Guess Who\n\nCanned Wheat (1969)\n\nUndun was a Randy Bachman composition based on jazz chords he learned from the Mickey Baker Jazz Guitar book, recommended by friend and fellow guitar fiend Lenny Breau.\n\nInspired by the phrase “she came undone” from Bob Dylan’s Ballad in Plain D, Bachman wrote a doleful lyric about a young woman’s fatal acid trip, which Cummings gave just the right plaintive vocal reading, replete with a little scatting.\n\nOriginally released as the B-side of Laughing, Undun eventually climbed on its own to No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and enjoyed something of a renaissance when Quentin Tarantino used it in his 1997 movie, Jackie Brown.\n\nDunrobin’s Gone — Brave Belt\n\nBrave Belt II (1972)\n\nIf you’re wondering what the missing link is between the Guess Who and Bachman-Turner Overdrive, the answer is Brave Belt, an early ’70s group composed of Chad Allan, the Guess Who’s original lead singer, and Randy Bachman and Fred Turner, the B and T in BTO.\n\nDunrobin’s Gone, the lead single from the album Brave Belt II, is instantly recognizable to anybody who ever tuned into an AM radio station in 1972.\n\nOne problem: because the title — an obscure reference to a street in East Kildonan — never surfaces in the lyrics, fans who phoned a DJ, imploring them to play “She’s gone and she won’t be back” were stymied, as there was no such song.\n\nAllan, who co-wrote it, later admitted the song’s curious tag was probably a contributing factor to its lacklustre sales (in Canada, it only reached No. 62 on the charts) though it got a second life in 1974, when Brave Belt II was re-released.\n\nAin’t Seen Nothing Yet — Bachman-Turner Overdrive\n\nNot Fragile (1974)\n\nThe story goes that Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet almost didn’t make it on BTO’s 1974 album.\n\nFrontman Randy Bachman has said in interviews the track was recorded as a joke for his brother who had a stutter, but when the band was wrapping up production, Not Fragile was missing that magic hit single, which they believed was Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet.\n\nAfter pressure from label execs and bandmates, Bachman relented and rearranged the album to make room for the song; he even tried re-recording it without the stammering chorus, but it just didn’t sound as good.\n\nAin’t Seen Nothing Yet went on to top the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, adding another massive hit to BTO’s collection.\n\nSilver River — Shingoose\n\nNative Country (1975)\n\nCurtis Jonnie, born in Winnipeg in 1946, was a member of the Roseau River Anishinaabe First Nation. Jonnie started his music career in the late 1960s, after moving to Washington, D.C., where he played with various R&B groups.\n\nHe returned to Manitoba in 1973, changing his stage name to Shingoose, his great-grandfather’s name. Soon after he began exploring the world of folk music, particularly how it related to the American Indian Movement, an American Indian civil rights organization founded in Minneapolis in the late 1960s.\n\nShingoose, a seven-time performer at the Winnipeg Folk Festival, released his debut album Native Country in 1975. Silver River, a standout track from that recording, was re-issued 29 years later as part of the Grammy Award-nominated package Native North America, Vol. 1.\n\nRed River Waltz — Reg Bouvette and the Road House Gentlemen\n\nRed River Jig (1976)\n\nFour years ago we interviewed Tim Frisk, a Winnipegger whose mother was married to Reg Bouvette, a legendary Winnipeg-born fiddler, from 1982 to 1992. At the time Frisk, 60, was on the hunt for anything and everything related to Bouvette: albums, posters, even bows the Métis musician, labelled a “superstar” by his record label, Sunshine Records, may have used at one time or another.\n\n“If you’ve never listened to this stuff, you’re missing out,” Frisk told us, holding up Red River Waltz, which includes Bouvette’s version of Red River Jig, a traditional number known as the unofficial anthem of the Métis Nation.\n\nIn 2013, Bouvette was properly feted at an event dubbed Reg Fest, held at Indian and Metis Friendship Centre. Guest artists included Sierra Noble, Gary Lepine and Métis square-dance troupe the Asham Stompers.\n\nSeasons in the Sun — Terry Jacks\n\nSeasons in the Sun (1974)\n\nTerry Jacks, a founding member of Canadian psychedelic rock group the Poppy Family, was born and raised in Winnipeg.\n\nThe Poppy Family split up in 1972, at which time Jacks was hired to produce an album for the Beach Boys. After that group rejected their label’s request to record Seasons in the Sun, Jacks included the tune — an English-language rewrite of Jacques Brel’s Le Moribond (1961) — on his debut album for Bell Records.\n\nGood move: not only did Seasons in the Sun, about a dying man’s final words to his loved ones, top the charts all over the world, it earned Jacks a much-coveted spot next to Norman Greenbaum (Spirit in the Sky) and Wild Cherry (Play That Funky Music) in The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders.\n\nStand Tall — Burton Cummings\n\nBurton Cummings (1976)\n\nBurton Cummings, born and raised in Winnipeg’s North End, spent 10 years as the frontman of the Guess Who. Deciding he had his own way to rock, the St. John’s High School alumnus left the band in 1976 to pursue a solo career.\n\nCummings enjoyed a run of hits in the ensuing years — Break It to Them Gently and I Will Play a Rhapsody, to name two — none bigger, however, than his debut single Stand Tall.\n\nIn addition to topping Canadian charts, Stand Tall, a mournful ballad spawned by a recent breakup, went all the way to No. 2 on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart. It was denied the top spot by — how could this be true? — Captain & Tenille’s (woeful) Muskrat Love.\n\nAction — Streetheart\n\nMeanwhile… Back in Paris (1978)\n\nWho says Manitoba and Saskatchewan can’t get along? Streetheart, formed in Regina in 1977 and based out of Winnipeg for the bulk of its recording career, took home the Juno Award for Most Promising Group of the Year in 1980 — a full two years after Meanwhile…, considered by many to be the best debut album in Canadian rock history, hit stores.\n\nAction is a 4:48 tour de force that builds slowly with a driving bass line performed by Ken (Spider) Sinnaeve, before lead vocalist Kenny Shields kicks in, singing/rasping “Meanwhile, back in Paris, I was embarrassed…babe.”\n\nYou know how people misconstrue song lyrics? Same thing in my case: until a member of Streetheart informed me the line immediately following, “Action, action…” is “read all about it,” I screamed “we got a party,” at the top of my lungs every time I gave the song a spin.\n\nIce Box City — Popular Mechanix\n\nPopular Mechanix (1979)\n\nWe’ll see your Weakerthans’ One Great City! and raise you Popular Mechanix’ Ice Box City, a 2:19 new wave burst of energy that sarcastically denounced Manitoba’s capital long before the Weakerthans declared the Guess Who sucked and the Jets were lousy.\n\nFor three years in the late ’70s and early ’80s, Popular Mechanix, which consisted of Stu Nichols on guitar and vocals, Boris Hoagy on bass and piano and Greg Gardner on “hits anything in sight,” were this city’s answer to beautifully quirky outfits such as XTC and Devo.\n\nIce Box City, the lead track on the band’s debut album, pokes fun at the trio’s hometown, à la “ice box city…it don’t look pretty…it’s the middle of May…there is snow on the ground to make you pay.”\n\nLeaders — Lowlife\n\nLeaders (1979)\n\nThe nascent proto-punk and early punk scenes of Detroit, New York and London took a while to reach the Canadian Prairies but once they did, teenagers learning instruments, disaffected by the state of FM radio, took to the raw sounds like ducks to water, inspired by punk’s DIY ethos.\n\nLowlife was a quartet from St. Boniface and St. Vital that featured Richard Duguay (later of Personality Crisis) on bass, Brad Hrushka (Monuments Galore) on guitar, Mark Halldorson (Le Kille, PC) on drums, as well as singer Rick Sprung, and Leaders, a three-song 45, was Winnipeg’s first punk release, financed with a couple hundred dollars borrowed from pal Mitch Funk.\n\nThe song itself is a burst of breakneck early punk energy, marked by Halldorson’s effervescent drumming and a lyric about self-involved, uncaring politicians and scenesters. What it spawned is now the stuff of legend.\n\nCrossing Selkirk Avenue — Finjan\n\nCrossing Selkirk Avenue (1993)\n\nThe title track to Finjan’s 1993 album is credited to Myron Schultz but it’s really a group effort from the band’s six players — Schultz, his brother Victor, Shayla Fink, Eli Herscovitch, Daniel Koulack and Kinzey Posen — and a brilliant distillation of the klezmer music that Finjan popularized in Western Canada in the ’80s and ’90s.\n\nThe tune opens with a wailing clarinet and slowly loping bass and gently gains momentum, piece by piece. As percussion, mandolin, guitar, saxophone, accordion and violin join in, the tempo shifts and heels begin to pick up in an imaginary Selkirk Avenue dance hall until you can almost see the steam accumulating on the window panes as a storm rages outside on a cold winter’s night.\n\nSuccess — The Pumps\n\nGotta Move (1980)\n\nDon’t be fooled into thinking Success, a single from Winnipeg new wave act the Pumps’ debut album, was lead singer Chris Burke-Gaffney’s desperate plea for recognition.\n\nInstead, Burke-Gaffney, who hails from Lynn Lake, says the song’s lyrics are a “non-specific, throw-it-all-at-the-wall-whatever-sticks-kinda thought… hit song success, relationship success…any success.”\n\neached at home, Burke-Gaffney weighs in on a reporter’s assertion Success ranks right up there with My Generation and (ba-ba-ba) Bennie and the Jets as one of rock’s greatest stuttering songs.\n\n“It was supposed to be word play, as in ‘sex-cess,’” he says in reference to how he stammered su-su-su-success throughout the chorus. “I was hoping my peeps got the ‘sex-sex-sex-success’ reference.”\n\nRock & Roll Gypsies — Dianne Heatherington\n\nHeatherington Rocks (1980)\n\nDianne Heatherington would have deserved a spot on this heady list even if she hadn’t been known as “the First Lady of Winnipeg rock and roll,” and Rock & Roll Gypsies, a track from Heatherington’s 1980 effort, Heatherington Rocks, sums up her career in a nutshell.\n\nAfter more than a decade performing in one Winnipeg watering hole or another, she left the city for Toronto and later New York. She also tried her hand at acting — she had a bit part in Cocktail — before being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1993.\n\nHeatherington, a runner-up in the Juno Awards Most Promising Female Vocalist category in 1982 — died in Toronto in 1996.\n\nCan I Come Near — Graham Shaw & the Sincere Sernaders\n\nGraham Shaw & the Sincere Sernaders (1980)\n\nGraham Shaw, whose family moved to Winnipeg from Calgary in the early 1960s, created a bit of stir among curious audiophiles in 1980. Those of us who picked up a copy of Shaw’s debut wondered who exactly he was hoping to cosy up to in the lyrics of Can I Come Near.\n\nFour minutes of Beatles-esque pop perfection, the tune begins by asking the menacing question, “Did you know I’ve been watching you for weeks on end? Probably not.”\n\nReached at home in Ontario, Shaw says sorry, he’s still not naming names. “I’ve got nothing except I wrote it about every archetypically beautiful girl or woman ever who scared the (crap) outta me, so any approach I mustered was with extreme caution and trepidation,” reports the 1980 Juno Award winner for Most Promising Male Vocalist.\n\nLittle Star — iskwē\n\nacākosīk (2019)\n\nLittle Star is a gut-wrenching, hauntingly beautiful song inspired by Cree astronomy that condemns the media’s portrayal of Indigenous victims of violence, such as Tina Fontaine and Colten Bushie. Winnipeg-born alt-pop artist Iskwē (born Megan Meisters) uses her platform and powerful voice to shine a spotlight on the systemic abuses of Indigenous communities in Canada throughout her third album, acākosīk.\n\nThe work received two 2020 Juno Award nominations: acākosīk is being considered for adult alternative album of the year and collaborator Sarah Legault is up for music video of the year for the stop-motion animated video for Little Star. (The award ceremony was indefinitely postponed in March owing to the coronavirus and the winners have yet to be announced.)\n\nInnocence — Harlequin\n\nLove Crimes (1980)\n\nHarlequin was a hard-working five-piece Winnipeg rock outfit founded by bassist Ralph James that cut its teeth on the Prairie circuit, then elbowed its way onto the national scene by catching the attention of famed record producer Jack Douglas (Aerosmith, John Lennon, Patti Smith), who helped the group land a deal with Epic/CBS.\n\nDouglas was executive producer of the band’s first album, 1979’s Victim of a Song, then took the reins himself for Love Crimes in 1980, which yielded an immediate hit in Innocence, a song about betrayal which rode an insistent synth riff from Gary Golden and an expressive George Belanger vocal into the Canadian Top 30.\n\nQueen Jealousy — Mood Jga Jga\n\nMood Jga Jga (1974)\n\nThe cover of Mood Jga Jga’s self-titled debut album is peak Winnipeg, as it boasts a shot of the four members, Greg Leskiw, Gord Osland, Bill Merritt and Hermann Frühm, perched on a bridge, we’re guessing it’s the Slaw Rebchuk, with the sprawling Canadian Pacific railyards clearly visible in the background.\n\nMood Jga Jga, a moniker reportedly “suggested” by drummer Osland’s infant son when he was trying to tell his dad what he wanted for supper, travelled to New York in 1973 to record with famed producer Phil Ramone (Stevie Wonder, Billy Joel).\n\nThe end result, including the lead single Queen Jealousy, drew favourable comparisons to American hit-makers Steely Dan thanks to its mix of — as one reviewer put it — “funky jazz country blues rock.”\n\nSandwiches — Fred Penner\n\nThe Cat Came Back (1980)\n\nWritten by Winnipeg songwriter Bob King — who just happens to be the brother of Free Press film and theatre critic Randall King — this sprightly ode to a brown-bagged staple became synonymous with Fred Penner.\n\nIncluded on Penner’s 1980 debut album The Cat Came Back, Sandwiches is still imprinted on the brains of kids who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s — and therefore with his CBC show, Fred Penner’s Place, which aired from 1985 to 1997 — who are now singing it to their own kids.\n\nAlong with the album’s titular song, Sandwiches remains one of the most-requested songs by Fred Heads young and old.\n\nNew and notable\n\nIn creating this list, we unfortunately had to cut out a lot of talent that has more recently found feet in the Winnipeg scene. Here are a few newer Manitoban acts that were on our initial list that are worth checking out.\n\nIn creating this list, we unfortunately had to cut out a lot of talent that has more recently found feet in the Winnipeg scene. Here are a few newer Manitoban acts that were on our initial list that are worth checking out:\n\n3Peat — Hip-hop trio featuring Steve, E.GG and Dill the Giant; released its most recent EP in 2019, 3peat 2.\n\nAriel Posen — Known for his guitar chops and songwriting; released his solo debut, How Long, in 2019; formerly a member of the Bros. Landreth.\n\nKelly Bado — Bilingual soul/pop artist originally from Côte d’Ivoire but now based in Winnipeg; released a brand-new single, Ahora, earlier this month.\n\nMadeleine Roger — Folk artist who was previously part of duo Roger Roger with her twin brother, Lucas, but is now a solo artist; released her debut full-length, Cottonwood, in 2018.\n\nMicah Erenberg — Indie-folk-pop musician whose music is built on a foundation of nostalgic sounds and quirky lyrics; released his sophomore full-length album, Love is Going to Find You, in 2019.\n\nMulligrub — Pop-punk trio that came out of the gate strong with its excellent debut full-length, 2016’s Soft Grudge.\n\nSebastian Gaskin — An R&B singer-songwriter and guitarist; opened for legendary hip-hop artist Common at the 2019 Winnipeg International Jazz Festival; released his debut EP, Contradictions, in 2019.\n\nSilence Kit — Rock group that floats along the musical spectrum from alt-rock to grunge to punk; most recent release is the band’s 2018 EP, Silence Kit Presents Kitty Kitty.\n\nSuper Duty Tough Work — Supergroup that meshes elements of jazz, hip-hop and soul; 2019 debut EP, Studies in Grey, recently landed on the Polaris Music Prize long list.\n\nVeneer — Alt-pop trio made up of members from Living Hour, Basic Nature and Animal Teeth; recently named one of Paste Magazine’s “30 Canadian Artists You Need to Know in 2020”; released debut, self-titled EP in 2019.\n\nNo Sad Refrain — Dash and the Dots\n\nWinnipeg Homegrown Vol. 1 (1981)\n\nAnyone who haunted downtown record stores in the late ’70s and ’80s will attest to the fact Winnipeg Homegrown Vol. 1, a 92 CITI-FM sponsored project, was a must-have.\n\nIn addition to tracks by popular draws such as the Freeze, Exit and Woodwork, it also contained Dash and the Dots’ No Sad Refrain, a radio-friendly song that sounded a bit like the Police, a bit like the Jam, but mostly like nobody else, Unfortunate souls who didn’t possess a copy of Homegrown Vol. 1 had a long wait on their hands if they wanted to hear No Sad Refrainn in the comfort of their own home.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2016 that the reunited Dots put out Morse Code, a CD that contained an updated version of the group’s greatest “hit.”\n\nWhat Kind of Love is This — Streetheart\n\nStreetheart (1982)\n\nAfter disappointing album sales, Streetheart went back to basics in 1982 with the release of an eponymously titled, largely self-produced record.\n\nStreetheart contained a number of uptempo rockers that quickly became staples of the band’s live shows; the song that gained the most attention chart-wise, however, was a power ballad, What Kind of Love is This.\n\nDescribed by one rock critic as a song “that is a case study in hoping against hope” what with the chorus asking, “What kind of love is this? The kind that keeps me standing in line,” the song became Streetheart’s biggest self-written hit, reaching No. 13 in Vancouver, No. 9 in Ottawa and No. 4 in Winnipeg.\n\nAwakening — Elias, Schritt & Bell\n\nAwakening (1982)\n\nClose your eyes and listen to Awakening, the title track of Elias, Schritt & Bell’s debut album. Then try to convince us the song, featuring pitch-perfect harmonies by the band’s three members, Tim Elias, John Schritt and Steve Bell, doesn’t sound like an outtake from Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young’s 1970 smash Deja Vu.\n\nFolk-pop trio Elias, Schritt & Bell played together for four years. The group, long billed as Winnipeg’s Next Big Thing, recorded its one and only album in January 1982 at CBC Winnipeg’s Studio 11. Although the record topped local charts, the band wasn’t able to expand its base outside Manitoba.\n\nFifteen years after the group’s breakup in 1983, guitarist Bell became the first ever winner in the Juno Awards’ Best Gospel Album category.\n\nBlues for ‘Ol Ed — Ron Paley\n\nBoxton (1977)\n\nAs local musical resumés go, few compare to Ronald Frank Paley’s. Paley, born in Winnipeg and a graduate of both the University of Manitoba and Boston’s Berklee College of Music, toured in the early 1970s with the Buddy Rich and Woody Herman big bands. He also played bass on a concert recording by Frank Sinatra, 1974’s The Main Event Live.\n\nPaley returned to his hometown in 1976 forming the Ron Paley Big Band. That same year he wrote and recorded his debut album, Boxton.\n\nBlues for ‘Ol Ed, the track that closes out Side 1, is a 7:14 slice of cool jazz, augmented by Julie Opocensky’s (later of the Parachute Club) scat vocals, Paley’s nimble work on piano and Ed Philp’s, for whom the tune is named, virtuoso performance on tenor sax.\n\nI Did It for Love — Harlequin\n\nOne False Move (1982)\n\nThe opening track of Harlequin’s third album, One False Move, again produced by Jack Douglas, was an uptempo rocker that featured just a hint of the Cars in Gary Golden’s keys, Glen Willows’ rhythm guitar parts and the relentless beat of Ralph James and David Budzak.\n\nGeorge Belanger’s earnest vocals and clever lyrics, in which a spurned young lover tries to plead his case, drive the tune forward but the shining moments in this song come courtesy of Willows’ three solos, which could be case studies in how to turn lead breaks into restrained, tasteful bursts of excitement.\n\nCanadian listeners agreed, propelling I Did it for Love to No. 19 on the national charts.\n\nStand — Dub Rifles\n\nBoom (1983)\n\nIn 1983, influential American alternative rock magazine Trouser Press released a 20-track compilation tape called Trouser Press Presents: The Best of America Underground, which featured the song Stand, by a brassy little post-punk quintet from Winnipeg called Dub Rifles, the only Canadian group in the collection.\n\nWith a breezy, twin-saxophone-fuelled melody and a crunching guitar line that built to an anthemic chorus of “Stand! Rock steady and ready, are you ready?” the song was a beacon for young, arty Winnipeg music fans, proof that we could make our new sounds right here at home.\n\nMiracle — Orphan\n\nLonely at Night (1983)\n\nChris Burke-Gaffney is a rock ‘n’ roll lifer. He signed three different record deals with three different acts, helped steer Chantal Kreviazuk into her career and is active as a producer, manager and songwriter with numerous artists.\n\nOrphan, the new name for a reconstituted version of the Pumps, was the second go-round for Burke-Gaffney and keyboardist Brent Diamond, and Miracle, a power-ballad that CBG says was written in four minutes after the birth of his son, Nick, was the big hit from the quartet’s debut 1983 album, Lonely at Night, for Portrait/CBS Records, produced by Tony Bongiovi.\n\nAll together now, Winnipeggers of a certain age: “Whoa-oh… it’s a miracle…”\n\nTwilight’s Last Gleaming — Personality Crisis\n\nCreatures for Awhile (1983)\n\nEven though it’s just two minutes and nine seconds long, Twilight’s Last Gleaming is a full-on sonic assault that captures the essence of Personality Crisis, a proto-punk, pre-hardcore outfit whose 1983 album, Creatures for Awhile, is a Canadian punk classic.\n\nEverything’s here — molten guitar riffs propelled by double-time drums, a pummelling, sinuous bassline, Mitch Funk’s creepily cryptic baritone vocals, a shouted call-and-response chorus and a breakdown bridge that becomes a virtuosic lead guitar break. TLG will leave you breathless… and wanting more.\n\nIls s’aiment — Daniel Lavoie\n\nTension Attention (1984)\n\nOne of the world’s most prominent francophone singers was born and grew up in Dunrea, a small community about 220 kilometres west of Winnipeg. That singer is Daniel Lavoie, and the 1984 song Ils S’aiment, which he co-wrote with Daniel DeShaime.\n\nThe song, Lavoie has said, was initially written in English as They Love Each Other and was influenced by TV reports showing teens walking amid the rubble in Beirut.\n\nOnce he translated it into French — Lavoie attended what is now Université de Saint-Boniface — it became a hit in Quebec and France. It has sold more than two million copies and has become a standard; francophone superstars such as Céline Dion perform the song in concert.\n\nLonely at Night — Orphan\n\nLonely at Night (1983)\n\nA churning, muscular riff, swirling and chiming ’80s synths and a sweet but rather abbreviated lead guitar break from guitarist Steve McGovern were the signatures of the title track from Orphan’s 1983 album for Portrait/CBS, a tune that picked right where the Pumps left off and breathed new life into the quartet, which also featured singer/bassist Chris Burke-Gaffney, keyboardist Brent Diamond and drummer Ron Boisvenue.\n\nWho’s in Charge — Stretch Marks\n\nWho’s in Charge (1983)\n\nRonald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Moammar Gadhafi, Yuri Andropov, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat, Ayatollah Khomeini… The faces of the world leaders depicted on Glen Dunits’ illustrated cover for Stretch Marks’ six-song, seven-inch, 33 rpm Who’s in Charge EP say it all.\n\nLife on the world’s geopolitical stage was rather bleak 37 years ago, too. At the time, North American punk had evolved into a harder, faster form of guitar music that riled up roiling mosh pits.\n\nSinger Dave McCombe, bassist Mark Langtry and the Jackson brothers, guitarist Bill and drummer Kelly, captured the spirit of the age perfectly in the EP’s title track, a 1:46 burst of frustration and anger that features a wonderfully distorted psycho-guitar solo and closes with a profane statement of disgust at the state of affairs.\n\nTanks Keep Rolling — Unwanted\n\nShattered Silence (1984)\n\nOne of the first generation of Winnipeg punk bands, the Unwanted also spread the word far and wide, getting out of the city on tour and attracting the attention of California label Better Youth Organization, which released the band’s 1984 album Shattered Silence and included Tanks Keep Rolling on the influential compilation Something to Believe In (along with tracks from Winnipeg’s Personality Crisis and the Stretch Marks).\n\nTanks Keep Rolling is a political antiwar salvo with a fist-in-the-air chorus. An important early strike in the city’s punk-rock history.\n\nShot With Our Own Guns — The Cheer\n\nReleased as a single (1986)\n\nThe first time this writer saw the Cheer was at Corner Boys, a basement bar located near the corner of Osborne and Morley. The power pop group, led by lead singer and guitarist Lloyd Peterson, hadn’t recorded a note to that point but word of their live shows was spreading fast.\n\nIn addition to originals such as Don’t Even Know What I Want and Just Another Crisis, both of which turned up on the band’s 1985 debut, Swimming to Work, the Cheer also performed a crowd-pleasing, 100 mph cover version of the Carpenters’ Top of the World to end its first set. Let’s just say we were sold.\n\nThe Cheer released a new single in 1986, Shot With Our Own Guns, which was similar in style to British bands Simple Minds and the Alarm. Produced by Bob Rock (Metallica, Bryan Adams, Aerosmith), the hard-driving tune was received favourably at college stations from coast to coast.\n\nCasual Design — Ruggedy Annes\n\nJagged Thoughts (1985)\n\nFew women were seen onstage in the Winnipeg punk/alternative scene of the late ’70s and early ’80s, but Ruggedy Annes — a quartet of singer Jake Moore, guitarist Margaret Fonseca, bassist Ruth Monk and drummer Debbie Wall — more than held their own as musicians and performers.\n\nTaken from their 1985 Jagged Thoughts EP, which was produced by Jimmy Green of Personality Crisis, Casual Design was a short (just 2:21), sharp slice of smart post-punk songcraft, featuring buzzing guitars and throbbing bass, a churning middle-eight and a dramatic performance from Moore, including a spoken-word outro, delivered in a delightfully blasé tone, that concludes with “The bored look is in…”\n\nPeace and Harmony — Monuments Galore\n\nReleased as a single (1987)\n\nMonuments Galore was a two-guitar rock band fronted by the effervescent Kevin Mears that emerged from Winnipeg’s punk/alt/indie underground of the early 1980s.\n\nThe quintet released a couple of EPs and won a CASBY (Canadian Artists Selected By You) Award in 1986 before issuing Peace and Harmony as an independent single in 1987.\n\nThe group signed with Eureka Records in 1988 and re-recorded the tune with Mitch Easter for its debut full-length but, strangely, the song was left off the album and didn’t resurface until 2016, when the band released it again on its version of the ’89 record, which was this time titled Colour Depth & Field.\n\nCome for the guitar riff, stay for the gang vocals and singalong chorus.\n\nTogether (The New Wedding Song) — Joey Gregorash\n\nCanadian Gold (1987)\n\nWhile the commercial single for Joey Gregorash’s ballad Together (The New Wedding Song) wasn’t released until 1987 on Attic Records, the origins of this popular nuptial earworm go back over a decade.\n\nIn 1975, Gregorash tweaked one of the first songs he had ever written, called Tomorrow, Tomorrow, for a friend’s wedding and, along with the groom-to-be, rewrote the lyrics a few nights before the big day.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Gregorash recorded the song as part of a fundraiser for the Children’s Hospital of Winnipeg, garnering it some local airplay, before landing a one-single deal with Attic in 1987 — and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nTo this day Together is still widely used by those tying the knot across Canada.\n\nMan Who Would Be King — Jeffrey Hatcher and the Big Beat\n\nCross Our Hearts (1987)\n\nThere are some who will argue the list you’re perusing could have been largely composed of songs by Jeffrey Hatcher and David Briggs. Since the mid-1970s, the pair, who met in River Heights as teenagers, have played together in roots-rock projects including the Fuse, the Six, the Big Beat, the Blue Shadows and the Hatcher-Briggs Band, most of which also featured Hatcher’s brothers Don and Paul.\n\nBriggs says he and Hatcher wrote this song after watching the movie The Man Who Would be King, starring Sean Connery. “We skipped the accents and the narrative line that chronicled a megalomaniac’s rise and fall, and cut straight to all of the Mr. Big Stuffs in our lives,” Briggs says.\n\n“I guess that leaves us as the kids dancing around,” he adds, referring to the part of the jingle-jangle, jaunty number that goes, “round and round and round we go, all the children sing, everybody gather round the man who would be king.”\n\nBig League — Tom Cochrane & Red Rider\n\nVictory Day (1988)\n\nThe first cut from Cochrane’s Victory Day album, Big League is an epic, huge-sounding rock tune (produced by Don Gehman) written from the point of a view of the father of a promising hockey player whose skill was his way out of a life in the mill.\n\nAt 18, just as the boy has landed a scholarship with a big U.S. team, he and his girlfriend were killed “by a truck doing 70 in the wrong lane.”\n\nNaturally, Big League was huge in Canada but it was also a hit in the U.S. (where it was misunderstood as being about baseball), reaching No. 9 on Billboard’s rock chart.\n\nIn 2018, after the Humboldt Broncos bus crash, Cochrane reworked the song to honour the team and released an acoustic version with all proceeds donated to a fund for the victims’ families.\n\nI Collect Rocks — Al Simmons\n\nSomething’s Fishy at Camp Wiganishie (1992)\n\nAl Simmons’ Juno nominated debut album, Something’s Fishy at Camp Wiganishie, features more than one song about quirky collectibles. I Collect Rocks is the naturally rockin’ response to Counting Feathers, a ditty about the highs and lows of amassing plumage.\n\nThe theatrical children’s entertainer wrote the song with Canadian roots musician Ken Whiteley.\n\nIt’s wonderfully simple and is at least partially inspired by Simmons’ son Bradley, who at the age of four had a passion for rock collecting and would fill his pockets with stones and pant legs with gravel, according to an anecdote shared on the artists’ website.\n\nShe’s a Square — Ray St. Germain\n\nReleased as a single (1959)\n\nRay St. Germain, born and raised in St. Vital, vividly recalls where he was when Elvis Presley made his debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in September 1956.\n\n“My grandparents lived right across the street from our place and since they already owned a TV, my parents didn’t see the need in buying one themselves,” St. Germain says. “So we gathered over there — I would have been 16 at the time — to see what all the fuss was about.”\n\nIn 1959, by which time he had switched from accordion to guitar, St. Germain, nicknamed “the Saint,” wrote She’s a Square while on tour with the Hal Lone Pine Band. The resulting single, attributed to Ray St. Germain and the Five Satins, was the first Winnipeg-produced rock and roll 45 to chart nationally.\n\nThough it never appeared on one of the Métis performer’s own albums, the track was included on a 2009 double-CD entitled Buried Treasures (Winnipeg Rock Gems 1958-1974).\n\nThis Could Very Well Be True — Zen Bungalow\n\nMilky (1993)\n\nThis tune from the quartet of Greg Lev, Rod Slaughter, Al Wolanin and Grant Page was a Canadian college radio hit in the era when “indie rock” — a weirdly nebulous genre — was making waves (the track was often played on Toronto’s CFNY, known for championing alternative music).\n\nFrom the title on down, the song oozes Britpop, specifically the Smiths, with a jangly acoustic guitar and very Morrissey-esque lyrics (“Fatalist, chauvinist, egotistical bastard / it doesn’t matter what you think anymore”), with an elastic bass and a slightly grungy electric guitar that sets it firmly in the early ’90s.\n\nMmm Mmm Mmm Mmm — Crash Test Dummies\n\nGod Shuffled His Feet (1993)\n\nThe revolutionary “no-chorus chorus” of Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm, from Crash Test Dummies’ 1993 second album, God Shuffled His Feet, was its secret weapon. The song strings together four vignettes about kids facing shame and embarrassment but songwriter Brad Roberts couldn’t come up with a refrain he liked.\n\nSo he didn’t — and it worked. Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm was a left-field hit for the Dummies, peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the U.S., No. 2 in the U.K. and reaching No. 1 in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe band played the song on Saturday Night Live in February 1994, God Shuffled His Feet eventually sold more than eight million copies and the group was nominated for three Grammys in 1995: best pop performance by a duo or group for Mmm Mmm….; best alternative music performance for God…; and best new artist.\n\nPhob, Monarch — Grand Theft Canoe\n\nBolivia + Argentina = Paraguay (1993)\n\nIn the mid-’90s, Winnipeg had a bit of a moment. After the discovery of regional indie-rock hotbeds such as Seattle and Halifax, A&R folks were in search of the next big scene.\n\nGrand Theft Canoe was, quite rightly, touted as one of the acts that would put us on the map, although its delicate melodies and ’60s sensibility had little in common with the grungier rock of those other cities. (Why didn’t GTC make it big? A story for another day.)\n\nThe quartet came by its Anglophile cred honestly: brothers Alex (drums) and Angus (bass) Kirkpatrick are English expats, and the beautiful, slightly psychedelic Phob, Monarch contains echoes of the Kinks and XTC/Dukes of Stratosphear.\n\nAll Uncovered — The Watchmen\n\nIn the Trees (1994)\n\nA hypnotic bass line by Ken Tizzard, deft brushes from Sammy Kohn, and Joey Serlin’s chiming little guitar turnaround set the scene for All Uncovered, from the Watchmen’s second, platinum-selling album, In the Trees.\n\nAs the tune builds with cello and harmonica, Danny Greaves sings a lyric that hints at life’s excesses, offset by Serlin’s regretful refrain: “Oh can’t you see it’s a life I don’t need / please don’t make this thing happen to me.”\n\nBody of Light — Acoustically Inclined\n\nA Short Subliminal Message (1992)\n\nThe first track on the second side of this cassette-only release, Body of Light was written by Andrew Ross, but given life by the motley crew of this folky jam band, which was wildly popular in the early ’90s. (It’s no surprise the band was chosen by the West End Cultural Centre for a Throwback Thursday reunion concert.)\n\nThe uptempo, uplifting tune is a great showcase for Mira Sahay’s smoky vocals (and harmonies from classically trained viola player Richard Moody), and gives guitarist Luke Doucet (who went on to play with Sarah McLachlan and form Whitehorse) ample room to shine.\n\nJack Knife — Kittens\n\nDoberman (1994)\n\nKittens were one of the best-known bands on the local noise-rock scene of the ’90s. Influenced by groups from Chicago’s Touch & Go label, the Winnipeg trio was neither quite metal nor hardcore, but as heavy as either, with an abiding sense of menace and obliquely unsettling lyrics.\n\nJack Knife doesn’t have the distorted country influence of later Kittens, but its quiet-loud-quiet-terrifying formula is a great showcase for vocalist Shawdasn Fedorchuk’s buzzsaw guitar and frayed scream, which makes “Got a mouth like a mailbox” sound like a threat.\n\nFun fact: Fedorchuk has been nominated for three Emmys, including one for his work on the opening credits for HBO’s True Blood.\n\n7620 36th Ave. — The New Meanies\n\nThe Blue Meanies (1995)\n\nIt starts with a simple bass riff from Sky Onosson, drummer Jason Kane’s snare and high-hat gradually fade in, and then… BOOM… guitarists Damon Mitchell and Jason Hondubura kick into gear, with Mitchell wailing on a wah pedal for added psychedelic inflection.\n\nWhen Mitchell starts singing, his bluesy tenor wail spitting lyrics in what feels like double-time, 7620 36th Ave. is driven up yet another notch.\n\nSure, a young band sounding like a hyper-caffeinated Jimi Hendrix Experience at the height of the grunge era was an anomaly, but there was no doubting the virtuosity and ability behind the Meanies’ take on soulful blues rock — which still sounds fresh today.\n\nRusty Nail — Red Fisher\n\nWar Wagon (1995)\n\nRed Fisher emerged in the late 1980s on the front edge of the rise of Winnipeg’s skate-punk music scene, layering its up-tempo, technically dialed-in songs with a slightly metallic edge.\n\nThe constants throughout most of the band’s chronology were drummer Jason Tait (the Weakerthans, Bahamas) and John Stewart, who sang and played guitar in Red Fisher for most of the band’s later duration.\n\nThey attracted (but rejected) interest from major labels, and their full-length War Wagon was released on local label G7 Welcoming Committee records. Rusty Nail was first recorded with former singer Jay Smith on lead vocals; on the War Wagon version, Stewart’s singing and riffs are big and brash.\n\nThe song sounds like it could have been ripped from a skateboarding video, with big, chunky guitar lines and a singalong chorus.\n\nWayne – Chantal Kreviazuk\n\nUnder These Rocks and Stones (1996)\n\nThen 22, Chantal Kreviazuk released the kind of career-catapulting debut album most singer-songwriters dream of. Under These Rocks and Stones spawned five era-defining singles – including God Made Me, Believer, Hands, Surrounded and, of course, Wayne.\n\nSurrounded may have been the song to net her major radio play, but it’s Wayne that grabs you. Chock full of raw emotion, Wayne boasts one of those great big Kreviazuk choruses — the kind that tear out of her throat and soar like a hot air balloon — that would come to define her sound.\n\nBetamax — Farm Fresh\n\n(1996)\n\nLongtime Brandon pals Rod Bailey, Pat Skene and Tyler Sneesby — otherwise known as, respectively, Mcenroe, Pip Skid and DJ Hunnicutt — started writing rhymes, composing songs and playing shows in the Wheat City in the early 1990s before relocating to Winnipeg and releasing EPs and full-length albums as well as starting their own record label, Peanuts & Corn Records.\n\nBut it wasn’t until long after they had disbanded — in February 2020 — that the trio released a 7” record featuring Betamax, one of their most popular tracks. The song sees Sneesby take centre stage for the longtime live staple, waxing poetic about the home-video device and girls.\n\nFarm Fresh had plenty of popular, catchy jams in their arsenal; this fan fave finally got its just desserts decades later.\n\nLeave a Little Light — the Wyrd Sisters\n\nLeave a Little Light (1992)\n\nThe Wyrd Sisters are a folk-pop trio founded in 1990 by Winnipeg vocalists Kim Baryluk, Nancy Reinhold and Kim Segal. Leave a Little Light appears on two of the Wyrd Sisters’ six albums — it was the title track of the trio’s debut in 1992 — and also appeared on 2002’s Sin & Other Salvations, one of three Sisters’ records to earn Juno nominations.\n\nThe band gained notoriety in the pop-culture world when Baryluk launched a $40-million lawsuit against Warner Bros., the studio behind the Harry Potter film franchise. Baryluk tried to halt the release of 2005’s Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire because the film, just like the J.K. Rowling novel, included a rock band called the Wyrd Sisters.\n\nThe case dragged on for five years, included an Ontario Superior Court justice who ruled in Warner Bros.’ favour, several appeals, and eventually ended with an undisclosed settlement.\n\nShake it — Stagmummer\n\nRim (1996)\n\nThe Stagmummer live experience was a confrontational circus sideshow.\n\nVocalist Jack Balles (Zack Walsh) was an in-your-face frontman with a quick wit whose lyrics about the human condition, surgeries and other abstract subjects rode above the throbbing rhythm section of drummer Chris (Mama) Bauer and bassist Rob Barteaux, while guitarists Scott (C.J. Bhutte) Cook and Mike McIssac set down a cavalcade of riffs that drew on everything from the Jesus Lizard to King Crimson.\n\nThe verses of Shake It — produced by the legendary Steve Albini — are akin to a noise-rock boogie that shows off the band’s warped humour with lines such as “I’d like to kiss my dad because he is a man/A real man!” before exploding into an almost threatening chorus.\n\nBeauty Love Chant — Vav Jungle\n\nZig-a-Dig (1997)\n\nThis song from Vav Jungle’s debut is Winnipeg’s nod to the mid-’90s cocktail-kitsch craze, which included such acts such as Pizzicato Five; this groovy, half-crooned, half-spoken ode to beauty standards was also the first video released by the eclectic electro-lounge act led by Eve Rice (formerly of Just Ducky).\n\nRice was a favourite of CBC’s David Wisdom, who championed her music on his late-night radio show, Night Lines. Onstage, her quirky dance sensibility — backed with drum machines and rinky-dink keyboards — was fleshed out with appearances by go-go dancer Grace Martini.\n\nBeauty Love Chant is quintessential Vav Jungle: insidiously catchy and weirdly sexy with a swinging bouffant ‘60s vibe.\n\nStereo — The Watchmen\n\nSilent Radar (1998)\n\nAfter hitting platinum with In the Trees, The Watchmen made a rather more introspective album in the underrated Brand New Day.\n\nOn their next album, Silent Radar, the band hit the reset button and leadoff track Stereo was its statement of intent, a straightforward, guitar-driven rock track with a simple hook, a driving beat and a phasing effect from producer Adam Kasper that plays on the stereophonic metaphor of the lyric.\n\nThe Mayor of Ganja City — JFK and the Conspirators\n\nThe Mayor of Ganja City (1998)\n\nEvery city seems to have its ska scene, and Winnipeg is no exception; the seven-piece JFK and the Conspirators seemed like the kingpins of the two-tone crowd.\n\nReleased on Stomp Records, a Montreal label devoted to third-wave ska, this largely instrumental track kicked off JFK’s debut album of the same name.\n\nIt’s a fine example of the band’s traditional rocksteady style, a mellow, grooving tune, almost spaghetti western-ish in spots, with crisp but warm horns that dip into mariachi territory.\n\nThe Mummers’ Dance — Loreena McKennit\n\nThe Book of Secrets (1997)\n\nIt’s tough to imagine the musical environment that allowed a moody medieval ballad prominently featuring a hurdy-gurdy by a harpist from Morden about a troupe of masked pantomime actors to become a global hit.\n\nWell, if Enya could do it, why not our own Celtic-influenced, history-loving soprano songwriter? The Mummers’ Dance rose to No. 1 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary charts, and to No. 18 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 (higher than Enya’s Orinco Flow, for what it’s worth, and a notable feat for a song containing the lyrics: “A garland gay we bring you here / And at your door we stand / It is a sprout well budded out / The work of our Lord’s hand”).\n\nSpaceman — Bif Naked\n\nI Bificus (1998)\n\nThis song, the first single from I Bificus, was the song that launched a Winnipegger who was born in New Delhi into Canadian music stardom and into the global punk lexicon.\n\nSpaceman was such a big hit that it sparked two different versions that reached the charts. The original already had a danceable beat and a memorable chorus — “Spaceman, oh Spaceman, come rescue me!”\n\nThe dance version — remember the 1990s, when dance remixes were required? — created by the Boomtang Boys soared to No. 2 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart. Songs from I Bificus ended up on the TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, linking the two feminist touchstones in perpetuity.\n\nShe’s So High — Tal Bachman\n\nTal Bachman (1998)\n\nNot content to let Jakob Dylan have all the fun attempting to outshine his more famous father, Tal Bachman — son of Randy Bachman — put up a valiant fight when he released She’s So High in April 1999, a single from his 1998 self-titled album.\n\nThe summer bop about being in awe of a woman Bachman was trying to bribe to date his stepbrother reached No. 3 on the Canadian charts at its peak and even hit the No. 1 spot in the United States on Billboard’s Adult Top 40 chart.\n\nThe music video features Bachman on a fire escape looking down on the woman who is supposedly high above. I think it’s a metaphor.\n\nSara’s Black Pyjamas — The Bonaduces\n\nThe Democracy of Sleep (1998)\n\nThe Bonaduces’ last proper full-length showed singer-songwriter Doug McLean had moved beyond crafting deceptively simple but catchy upbeat pop-punk songs with his trademark thoughtful lyrics.\n\nWhile there are still pop rockers peppered throughout the record, the mid-tempo Sara’s Black Pyjamas delivers catchy and sadly sweet melodies to accompany McLean’s heartfelt lyrics about the pitfalls of mental health.\n\n“Suicide can be this subtle thing that keeps burrowing through your routine, until you’re not eating and phones just ring themselves to sleep,” McLean sings in one verse.\n\nThe band resurfaced in 2013 and still plays the occasional show — and Sara’s Black Pyjamas is still a fan favourite.\n\nAnyways/Mayonnaise — Transistor Sound & Lighting Co.\n\nTransistor Sound & Lighting Co. (1998)\n\n“I thought that rock guitar could save my generation,” sings Jason Churko in Transistor Sound & Lighting Co.’s Jaded and Elated — and with the band’s catchy indie-rock single Anyways/Mayonnaise, they very nearly did.\n\nThe band’s brief half-decade tenure in the late 1990s saw them sign to ViK. Recordings (like many Canadian up-and-comers at the time) and tour with a number of fellow alt-rockers before they disbanded.\n\nFor a time, the bowling-alley video for Anyways/Mayonnaise was in heavy rotation on MuchMusic, and it’s easy to see why — Churko’s plaintive verses and jangly guitar lead into a massive chorus built on a simple but fuzzy, overdriven riff and fist-raising shout-alongs.\n\nThe song’s far catchier than most output from similarly scruffy Can-rockers of the day, and still sounds fresh 20-plus years later.\n\nLove Wins Everytime — McMaster & James\n\nMcMaster & James (2000)\n\nPut aside the grammatically incorrect title and capital-B basicness of the sentiment, and what you have here is Y2K pop perfection created by Winnipeg duo McMaster & James.\n\nLove Wins Everytime has it all — a catchy-as-hell chorus, a brass section and lyrics that could not be more radio friendly (and boy, was it on the radio).\n\nNo to mention it was the first in a string of singles that did very well, including the objectively better I Understand and everyone’s grad song in the year 2000, Thank You.\n\nFeels Like Home — Chantal Kreviazuk\n\nReleased as a single (1999)\n\nAt the end of the millennium, Chantal Kreviazuk struck chart gold with a pair of covers. But while her version of John Denver’s Leaving on a Jet Plane — recorded for the 1998 Armageddon soundtrack — might be among her most recognizable songs, it’s her cover of Randy Newman’s Feels Like Home, which was featured on both teen drama Dawson’s Creek and rom-com How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days and later landed on her 2002 album, What If It All Means Something, that really sparkles.\n\nKreviazuk is in an impressive constellation of stars who have covered this one — Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt (that one featured Emmylou and Dolly, too), Neil Diamond, Josh Groban — but it was Kreviazuk’s that became a hit in Canada and Ireland.\n\nIt’s also a hint at a road not taken; she would have made a decent country singer.\n\nThe Canadian Way — Guy Smiley\n\nAlkaline (1999)\n\nPunk rock act Guy Smiley offers its take on the loss of the Winnipeg Jets and how money is destroying the sport in this rousing anthem from 1999’s Alkaline.\n\n“You took our game/now you give it back before you throw it away,” sings frontman Derek Kun on the track from the band’s third and final album, released by local imprint Smallman Records.\n\nThe band — Kun, guitarist Paul Stewart, bassist Jamie Fyles and drummer Ryan Francis — was a touring machine throughout the 1990s and travelled coast-to-coast across Canada at least 30 times, along with sojourns into the U.S. and Europe, where even if audiences didn’t know anything about hockey, they got to hear, “Go, Jets, go!” whenever Guy Smiley came to town.\n\nWest St. James — Greg MacPherson\n\nBalanced on a Pin (1999)\n\nAnyone who grew up west of Polo Park will recall the “explosion at Orest’s Barber Shop” and be familiar with St. James High School (technically St. James Collegiate, but let’s not split hairs).\n\nAnd while singer-songwriter Greg MacPherson’s melancholy West St. James, from his breakout album Balanced on a Pin, name-checks neighbourhood institutions, the lyrics are framed in the context of a dialogue had between travellers headed to the West Coast by plane.\n\nLike the Weakerthans’ One Great City!, there’s a universal quality to MacPherson’s reflections — after all, as he sings, we’re the “same collection of faults and accidents no matter where we are.”\n\nBaby, Cool Your Jets — Jet Set Satellite\n\nBlueprint (2000)\n\nIn the year 2000, Jet Set Satellite — Jet Set if you were trying to sound cool — dominated both MuchMusic and Power 97.\n\nOf the pair of singles from the band’s major-label debut to land heavy rotation status — the other being Best Way To Die — Baby, Cool Your Jets, with that instantly recognizable, rollicking guitar riff, has proven to be the one with the most staying power 20 years later, even if frontman Trevor Tuminski’s of-the-time growl places it firmly in the early aughts.\n\nIn 2013, Jet Set Satellite released a rewrite celebrating the return of the Winnipeg Jets called Baby, Fuel Your Jets.\n\nI Love Myself Today — Bif Naked\n\nPurge (2001)\n\nIt’s loud, it’s brash and an attitude of “This is how it’s gonna be,” is how most punk rock sounds. That was certainly the case in 2001 when Bif Naked released I Love Myself Today, the first single from her album, Purge.\n\nBeyond the heavy beat and loud guitars emerges a classic breakup song, where Bif shouts on the rebound after being “left free-falling like space junk.” The song’s video is pure chaos, and almost personifies the line “proud and loud and outta control.”\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine Bif, born Beth Torbert, performing to such a raucous beat during her formative musical years in Winnipeg at venues such as the Royal Albert and Wellington’s.\n\nAm I Drunk Because I’m Stupid? — Ditchpig\n\n(2000)\n\nThe punk band went through a few personnel changes over the years, but the classic lineup of vocalist/guitarist Doug Bell, vocalist/guitarist Ted Simm, vocalist/bassist Scott Hopper and drummer Dave (Egghead) Reynolds recorded the veteran outfit’s one and only album.\n\nThe band featured three distinct songwriters, each with his own style, but many of the group’s short-to-the-point, not-so-serious songs featured a strong melodic bent, including this anthemic ripper that asked the chicken-or-the-egg question: “Am I drunk because I’m stupid, or am I stupid ‘cause I’m drunk?”\n\nBitterman — Duotang\n\nThe Bright Side (2001)\n\nOpening with the evocative sound of a stylus being placed on a record, this track from the bass-and-drums duo of Rod Slaughter and Sean Allum manages to pack a lot into its four-minute running time — or should we say manages to Jam a lot, as the band wears its debt to Paul Weller et al. on its well-tailored sleeve.\n\nThe track, from the twosome’s third album, starts out dreamy with an almost psychedelic flair, before switching tempos dramatically and launching energetically into a tale of disillusionment and aging. Sounds like a downer, but it’s got a good beat and you can dance to it.\n\nThe Pukatawagan Song — Sidney Castel\n\nReleased as a single (2001)\n\nSidney Castel was a latecomer to country music stardom, but when he arrived on the scene with a quirky homage to his home community (most) Canadians couldn’t get enough.\n\nThe Pukatawagan Song — an ambling, off-key country ballad about the northern Manitoba reserve — was Castel’s entry for a talent search hosted by the local radio station. The song became an unexpected hit and was picked up by CBC Radio.\n\nAt 68 years old, the former hospital orderly was signing autographs, booking shows across the country and recording a full-length album of original tunes, according to an article published in the Globe and Mail.\n\nThe Cree singer died in 2003, one year after releasing Live at the Beaver Lodge, but was brought into the spotlight again in 2017 when Jimmy Fallon featured the album on The Tonight Show.\n\nParty — Hot Live Guys\n\n(2002)\n\nNo recorded material could ever truly capture the magic of seeing this band perform, but Party — a fuzzbomb of turbo-charged rawk ‘n’ roll with an infectious ferocity, especially in a live setting — could have come close.\n\nGuitarist Joe Warkentin was a madman of a showman who roamed venues with the longest guitar cable he could find and sacrificed his body by jumping on (and falling off) tables, chairs and bars, while vocalist-guitarist Julian Bargen, bassist Kurt Wittneir and drummer Mike (White Dog) Johnson were a powerful, intense unit on stage and kept things from falling off the rails.\n\nThe quartet also had the songwriting chops to match their live show. For a time, one of the best bands in the city.\n\nRocketship — Mood Ruff\n\nI Do My Own Stunts (2005)\n\nAn impossibly upbeat song about love for “girls” and “beats,” Rocketship was the first commercial hit for Winnipeg hip-hop outfit Mood Ruff. The group’s founding members Odario Williams and Eli Epp (a.k.a Spitz, a.k.a DJ Dow Jones) met at Kelvin High School and started performing live in the mid-’90s.\n\nRocketship appears on their fourth and final album, I Do My Own Stunts, which won a Western Canadian Music Award for best rap recording. New members ICQRI and Breakz joined the group before it disbanded in 2005.\n\nWilliams went on to front local hip-hop collective Grand Analog and is now the host of CBC Radio 2’s After Dark program. Epp is the official tour DJ for Canadian rapper Madchild, formerly of Swollen Members.\n\nTake a Message — Remy Shand\n\nThe Way I Feel (2002)\n\nWhat ever happened to Remy Shand? The Winnipeg soul singer released his debut album in 2002 to widespread acclaim, earning a Juno for R&B/soul recording of the year and no fewer than four Grammy nominations. Then he vanished from the spotlight.\n\nAlmost 20 years later, the mysterious phenom from West Kildonan still has a following, as evidenced by an active Facebook group with more than 1,000 members from around the world dedicated to celebrating Shand’s music and figuring out his whereabouts.\n\nSpoiler alert: he appears to be living in Toronto and running his own label called Remy Records. Close your eyes and let Shand’s signature falsetto and knitted-cap confidence wash over you with Take a Message.\n\nYakomon — VaGiants\n\nShort and Hard (2002)\n\nA rallying red-hot rawk ‘n’ roll battle cry from the explosive quartet of fiery vocalist Joanne (J-Rod) Rodriguez, guitarist Craig Bjerring, bassist Brendon Ehinger and drummer Chris (Mama) Bauer.\n\nThe VaGiants never phoned it in live or in the studio, and several songs could have made this list. Yakomon is a perfect example of everything that made this band a can’t-miss act: a rousing fist-in-the air chorus, J-Rod’s distinctive soulful vocal styling that goes from smooth to raspy to a howl, a Stooges-esque riff from Bjerring and a pulsating bottom end that shakes and grooves. Yakomon, indeed.\n\nCompany Store — Greg MacPherson\n\nMaintenance (2004)\n\nCape Breton-born singer-songwriter Greg MacPherson has lived all over Canada, but his musical output often reflects the Prairie sensibility of his adopted hometown. This incendiary track, however — a passionate throwback to rousing union anthems of yore — is set in Sydney, the Nova Scotia coal-mining town.\n\nWritten from the point of view of a miner who hasn’t worked in 40 days, the track has echoes of a Celtic folksong, but with lyrics that tell a story of corporate greed and a sense of rage fuelled by MacPherson’s insistent electric guitar and urgent vocals.\n\nThe song, from the Maintenance EP, wasn’t a single, but it’s a fan favourite at live shows; MacPherson performed it on the mainstage at the Winnipeg Folk Festival.\n\nKinship of the Down and Out — John Smith\n\nPinky’s Laundromat (2004)\n\n“The North End, it’s all bridges and train yards,” raps John Smith in the flagship song from his 2004 album, Pinky’s Laundromat (yes, it’s named for the now-closed washeteria at Pritchard Avenue and Arlington Street), but the Peanuts & Corn MC knows Winnipeg’s toughest neighbourhood is also all about people and pride of place.\n\nYeah, life can be hard and grimy here, he acknowledges, but it can be warm and fun, too — and most folks have each other’s backs.\n\nProducer Mcenroe takes a less-is-more approach to this track, laying hypnotic string loops and piano chords over a basic hip-hop backbeat that lets Smith paint intimately detailed scenes with his rhymes.\n\nPossibility — Sierra Noble\n\nPossibilities (2008)\n\nA young fiddle prodigy, Sierra Noble had long been a household name around town before the release of her 2008 album, Possibilities, her first vocal album, at the age of 18.\n\nPossibility was the first single released from that album; the sweet, acoustic-lead track saw heavy rotation on both pop and country radio in Canada, topping the MuchMoreMusic countdown.\n\nNot to mention the album itself was chosen as one of 20 to be brought aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour in July 2009 by then-astronaut, now-Gov. Gen. Julie Payette.\n\nOne Voice — The Wailin’ Jennys\n\n40 Days (2004)\n\nThe Wailin’ Jennys first came together for a one-off show in 2002 at Sled Dog Music, a Wolseley guitar shop.\n\nTaken with the reception, and each other, folk singer-songwriters Cara Luft, Nicky Mehta and Ruth Moody decided to forge ahead as a trio and quickly recorded an EP, followed by a full-length album, called 40 Days, that showcased their songwriting abilities, interpretive capabilities and, most effectively, their beautiful vocal harmonizing.\n\nOne Voice is a Moody composition from that album which invites her singing companions into the tune on successive verses and it’s both a wonderful exposition of the threesome’s talents and a sweetly powerful metaphor for what can be achieved when people work together.\n\nWe Stay High and Lonesome — D. Rangers\n\nWe Stay High and Lonesome (2004)\n\nDubbed mutant bluegrass for its anything-goes approach to the genre, the quintet of Jaxon Haldane (vocals, banjo, saw), Aaron Goss (mandolin), Chris Saywell (guitar), Tom (Twisty) Fodey (muckbucket) and Don Zueff (fiddle) describe the life of a Winnipegger who ends up hanging out downtown at the Times Change(d) High and Lonesome Club on this track.\n\nHaldane is a skilled lyricist who can even make lines about eating breakfast compelling. The mid-tempo, swinging country stomper allows each member of the band to have his turn in the spotlight and is filled with some keen observations about the city and its citizens, while the anthemic chorus remains a sing-along for fans when the band gets together at the Times to get wild ‘n’ rowdy.\n\nWatch Your Money — The Waking Eyes\n\nVideo Sound (2004)\n\nThe gritty opening chords of Watch Your Money are instantly familiar to many mid-’00s Winnipeg music fans and represented the kind of frenetic rock energy the Waking Eyes harnessed in much of their catalogue.\n\nThe track opens the band’s sophomore release, 2004’s Video Sound, which led to a Juno Award nomination for Group of the Year, as well as a Western Canadian Music Award win.\n\nThe Waking Eyes went on to release one more record, 2008’s Holding On To Whatever It Is, before going on a hiatus that allowed members to go on to form acts such as Royal Canoe and Imaginary Cities.\n\nWinnipeg Is a Frozen S—hole — Venetian Snares\n\nWinnipeg Is a Frozen S—hole (2005)\n\nReal aficionados of the work of breakcore artist Venetian Snares, a.k.a. Winnipegger Aaron Funk, likely wouldn’t choose this track as the best or even the most representative of his prolific career, during which he has released a slew of critically acclaimed, wildly experimental albums of crazy-making controlled chaos.\n\nHowever, its title ensures it’s one of his best known locally outside the not-very-mainstream breakcore community, and there’s a cheeky charm amid the chopped-up drums, jarring, arrhythmic beats and siren-like effects, including samples of Isabella Rossellini’s lines from Guy Maddin’s film The Saddest Music in the World.\n\nWake the Dead — Comeback Kid\n\nWake the Dead (2005)\n\nHard-touring band Comeback Kid — which started as an offshoot of another local favourite, Figure Four — offers up a blast of take-no-prisoners hardcore with melodic dual guitar riffs courtesy of Jeremy Hiebert and Andrew Neufeld, and anthemic gang-chorus vocals about getting over past regrets and making positive changes in your life.\n\nRecorded at the famed Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colo., with Bill Stevenson (Descendents) and Jason Livermore, the title track to the band’s 2005 sophomore album, which sold more than 100,000 copies after getting an international release by Victory Records, is a wake-up call that proved this quintet was no mere side project.\n\nSundancer — Eagle & Hawk\n\nMother Earth (2004)\n\nWhat started as a collaboration between Vince Fontaine, the Winnipeg guitarist who is one of Canada’s most prominent Indigenous composers, and Troy Westwood, the former kicker for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, has become a Juno Award-winning group that has lasted 25 years and counting.\n\nMore than a dozen Manitoba musicians from various musical genres have performed or recorded with Eagle & Hawk over the years, including vocalist Jay Bodner, keyboardists Gerry Atwell and Will Bonness, and drummer Brent Fitz.\n\nSundancer, which comes from the 2004 album Mother Earth, was named song of the year at the Canadian Aboriginal Music Awards that year, one of three trophies the group would take home from the ceremony. The album also received a Juno nomination.\n\nF— Knob — The Quiffs\n\nThe Quiffs (2005)\n\nPicture it: it’s 2005, and the roof of the Royal Albert Arms is being torn off by a scrappy punk band called the Quiffs. Like the riot grrrls screaming from Olympia, Wash., before them, the Quiffs — Erica Jacobson, Gillian Oswald, Meghan Flett and Alana Mercer — wrote take-no-prisoners feminist anthems with largely unprintable song titles. Like this one.\n\nF— Knob, with its bratty, blistering “I don’t like boys, they think they’ve got me figured out” refrain, sounds like a sister song to the Bikini Kill classic White Boy.\n\nIt’s one minute and 32 seconds of ovaries-to-the-wall punk rock.\n\nMike! Your House is on Fire! — Quinzy\n\npleasebabypleasebabybabybabyplease (2005)\n\nQuinzy will long be remembered for their incredibly fun annual holiday show, Quinzmas — which wrapped up its nine-year run in 2012 — and the semi-festive Mike! Your House if on Fire! encapsulates all the best parts of Quinzy’s legacy.\n\nThe indie-rock gem highlights the band’s quirky songwriting skills, its uncanny ability to craft a guitar line or hook so catchy it’ll stay with you for years (it’s impossible not to dance to that instrumental breakdown near the end!), and, of course, includes a hint of holiday magic. In short, it’s a bop-and-a-half.\n\nHypothesist — Novillero\n\nAim Right for the Holes in Their Lives (2005)\n\nHorns, hand-claps, hooks for days — this tune, from mod-pop outfit Novillero’s 2005 sophomore album, is a tight three minutes and 26 seconds of pure pop perfection.\n\nNovillero was never really referred to as a supergroup, though it certainly could have been; the band, which put out three records in the 2000s, featured, at various times, members from Transonic, Duotang, Bulletproof Nothing, the Paperbacks and the Waking Eyes.\n\nThe accompanying music video is also a stroke of genius; set at a ’60s-era junior high science fair, Novillero appears in miniature diorama form for a project entitled “Rock Band.”\n\nNo Bourbon and Bad Radio — Scott Nolan\n\nNo Bourbon and Bad Radio (2006)\n\nScott Nolan is one of those preternaturally gifted songwriters who finds poetry everywhere — and, as a musician, he also has incredible range, as deft with high-lonesome Americana ballads as he is with bluesy boot-scooters.\n\nThis little honky-tonk shuffle from his second album is build for dancin’ — at the Times Change(d), perhaps? — and serves as a reminder that not only does Scott Nolan know his way around a guitar, he also absolutely wails on the harmonica.\n\nHeaven’s My Home — The Duhks\n\nMigrations (2006)\n\nThis soulful, gospel-tinged song from the Duhks’ third album was nominated for a Grammy (songwriter Katie Herzig co-wrote it with Ruby Amanfu, who would go on to record it with her duo Sam & Ruby in 2008).\n\nThe slow, simmering track, buoyed by Tania Elizabeth’s fiery fiddle, lacks the plucky energy of some of the livelier bluegrass or Celtic-influenced tracks from the folk fusion band led by banjo player Leonard Podolak, but Jessee Havey’s husky, powerful vocals are enough to make you think you’ve died and gone to heaven.\n\nAlways, Always, Always, Never — The Details\n\nDraw a Distance. Draw a Border. (2007)\n\nIn 2007, indie rock band the Details released a shimmering debut of cinematic songs that, no surprise here, found their way to television and film.\n\nIn particular, Always, Always, Always, Never, with its slow-build that gives way to a galloping rhythm section, has soundtracked many a coming-of-age story; the YouTube comment section is filled with nostalgic “Degrassi: The Next Generation brought me here” posts.\n\nThe song was also featured in Sean Garrity’s 2012 sex comedy My Awkward Sexual Adventure.\n\nShakin’ All Over — Chad Allan & the Expressions\n\nReleased as a single (1965)\n\nIn January 1965, Chad Allan & the Expressions, an East Kildonan-based band, was in a bit of a funk sales-wise. In an effort to spark interest in the community club stalwarts — plus to cash in on the British Invasion — Quality Records credited the group’s new release to “Guess Who?”.\n\nPractically overnight, DJs from coast to coast seized on the mysteriously branded group’s new single, a rollicking cover of a ditty originally recorded by little-known British outfit Johnny Kidd & the Pirates.\n\nShakin’ All Over dented the charts across Canada and reached No. 22 on Billboard’s Top 40 in June 1965. In a twist of fate, that success spelled the end of Chad Allan & the Expressions.\n\nMoving forward the group was known as the Guess Who, minus the question mark.\n\nShame — Inward Eye\n\nThrowing Bricks Instead of Kisses (2007)\n\nInward Eye was a local phenomenon that gained buzz in the 2000s after signing with J Records, a Sony Music subsidiary run by Clive Davis, and being invited to tour with the Who and Flogging Molly. But the honeymoon didn’t last for the punk rock trio made up of brothers Dave, Kyle and Anders Erickson.\n\nBy the end of the decade and the release of Inward Eye’s debut album, the band’s relationship with its label had soured. Shame, a call out of those in power, was released as a single and appeared as the first track on Throwing Bricks Instead of Kisses.\n\nTrans Am — Nathan\n\nKey Principles (2007)\n\nDuring mid-oughts, the Juno-winning alt-country/roots quartet Nathan — Keri Latimer, Devin Latimer, Shelley Marshall, Damon Mitchell — was am"
