        "text": "Porkchop’s Catch of the Week\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\nIf you have followed my Catch of the Week for very long, you are aware that I have strong opinions on tribute albums. They are either very good, or they are very bad. There is no middle ground. So, when I recommend a tribute album, rest assured I hold it in high regard. Most tribute albums are homage to musical artists that have made an impact on other musicians, but they are no longer with us. This Catch of the Week is not only a tribute album, but the artist being honored is still alive and well.\n\nNorman Blake is a legendary performer. Norman, born in 1938, is an expert multi-instrumentalist that has had a great career as a soloist, as a duo with his wife, Nancy, and recording and touring with many other artists over the years. Two of the most notable collaborations that Norman Blake was involved in was with Johnny Cash and John Hartford. He recorded and toured with Johnny Cash for 10 consecutive years and collaborated with Cash over the remainder of his career. Blake was also a member of the band Aero-plain, along with John Hartford. Even though that group was together for just a short time, Norman Blake and John Hartford continued to perform and record together through the years. That work with Johnny Cash and John Hartford figure heavily into this new album, Pilgrimage to Rising Fawn.\n\nJohn Carter Cash, Johnny and June Carter Cash’s son, served as the producer and the driving force behind Pilgrimage to Rising Fawn. The project was captured over a year’s time, as he took recording equipment to the Blake’s home in Rising Fawn, GA in order to make the album. The John Hartford connection to this project is through John’s son, Jamie, who performs along with Norman Blake on two of the album’s ten tracks. Other appearances on this album includes Nancy Blake, Jamey Johnson Carlene Carter, Ana Cristina Cash, Joseph Cash, John Carter Cash, Matt Combs, John Cowan, Dennis Crouch, Jerry Douglas, Jamie Hartford, and Bill Miller. Here is the complete track listing for Pilgrimage to Rising Fawn:\n\n“Alabama Jubilee” – Featuring Jamey Johnson\n\n“Mystery Of Life” – Featuring Jamie Hartford\n\n“Cowboy’s Rules/ Boston Boy” – Featuring Norman Blake, Nancy Blake, Dennis Crouch, and Matt Combs\n\n“Hi-Eenktum Daddy-O” – Featuring Ana Cristina Cash and John Carter Cash\n\n“Shady Grove” – Featuring Jamey Johnson\n\n“Uncle Noah’s Ark” – Featuring Norman Blake\n\n“Give My Love to Rose” – Featuring Joseph Cash\n\n“Life’s Railway to Heaven” – Featuring Carlene Carter and John Carter Cash\n\n“Howard Hughes Blues” – Featuring Jamie Hartford\n\n“Georgia On My Mind” – Featuring Jamey Johnson\n\nI want to give a big tip of the hat to John Carter Cash for capturing these performances with a live and relaxed sound. It sounds as if we are listening to friends having a jam session. Most importantly, Cash uses this album to remind the world of Norman Blake’s greatness. However, the biggest tip of the hat goes to Norman Blake. In the world of acoustic guitar players, I feel like he is sometimes overlooked when younger pickers mention the greats. I can guarantee that your favorite young six string wonder was influenced, directly or indirectly, by Norman Blake. There is no shame in not being familiar with Norman Blake. However, use Pilgrimage to Rising Fawn as a starting place to explore the wonderful world of Norman Blake’s work. I recommend giving Pilgrimage to Rising Fawn a listen today.\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\nSturgill Simpson is one of the most interesting artists of our time. It is almost impossible to put a label on his music. Simpson has put a wide variety of styles and sounds in his previous albums: High Top Mountain , Metamodern Sounds in Country Music , A Sailor’s Guide to Earth, Sound and Fury, and The Ballad of Dood & Juanita. You will hear everything from country and gospel to bluegrass, rock, psychedelic rock, strings, and horns. Simpson had previously stated that he was only going to make five original albums before calling it quits as a solo artist. His Cuttin’ Grass, Vol. 1 & 2 are not included in the album total because those albums consist primarily of bluegrass versions of his previously recorded material. He has just released a new album, Passage Du Desir, but, true to his word, the album is not credited to Sturgill Simpson. Instead, Passage Du Desir is credited to his alter ego, Johnny Blue Skies.\n\nSturgill Simpson has said in several interviews that Johnny Blue Skies is the moniker that was given to him by a patron of a bar he frequented when he was younger. I am fine with the new name because the music is completely Sturgill Simpson. The album features eight new songs, and all of them were written by Simpson. Each song has a sound that is unique from the next track. However, there is something that is difficult to quantify that sonically ties the album together. Maybe it is Sturgill Simpson….I mean Johnny Blue Skies that is the thread that stitches the songs into a musical quilt. I enjoyed each track, but a few of my favorites are “Scooter Blues”, “Who I Am”, and “One For the Road”. Here is the complete track listing for Passage Du Desir:\n\n“Swamp of Sadness”\n\n“If The Sun Never Rises Again”\n\n“Scooter Blues”\n\n“Jupiter’s Faerie”\n\n“Who I Am,”\n\n“Right Kind of Dream”\n\n“Mint Tea”\n\n“One for the Road”\n\nIt is hard to say that this album is a return Sturgill Simpson’s earlier sound because it is almost impossible to pin him down to a particular genre. However, this album feels like it is more akin to Metamodern Sounds in Country Music and A Sailor’s Guide to Earth. Maybe it is an example of an artist continuing to grow while drawing on his previous musical experiences. Whether it is Sturgill Simpson or Johnny Blue Skies, I hope that he gives us more music in the future. I recommend giving Passage Du Desir a listen today.\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nTracy Lawrence was one of the standout country music stars of the 1990s. It is one of the most successful periods for the genre, with millions of albums having been sold. From that era, Tracy Lawrence’s songs are still revered by fans and covered in concert by current country stars. Since the time of his breaking into mainstream country music, Lawrence has continued to release new projects and tour. Never resting on his laurels, Tracy Lawrence has just released a new EP, Out Here In It.\n\nThere are six tracks on the new EP. As expected with a Tracy Lawrence project, the songs vary from the feel-good “Pretty Dang Good” to the heartbreak of “Gulf of Mexico”. I enjoyed each track on Out Here In It, but my two favorite tracks are the aforementioned “Gulf of Mexico” and the reflective “Out Here In It”. Here is the complete track listing for Out Here In It:\n\n“Pretty Dang Good”\n\n“I Could Use One”\n\n“A Cowboy Would”\n\n“Gulf of Mexico”\n\n“Out Here In It”\n\n“Honky Tonk Up”\n\nTracy Lawrence is a prime example of country stars that are still releasing quality songs despite not finding a place on current country radio playlists. I cannot speak for Lawrence or any of the others that find themselves in that situation, but I believe I would find those circumstances freeing as an artist. Lawrence sounds as good as ever, and his ability to convey a story or an emotion is still top notch. I recommend giving Out Here In It a listen today.\n\nJuly 10, 2024\n\nIt is hard to imagine, but for a period of time no record label wanted Johnny Cash. After starting his career in 1954 at Sun Records, Cash signed with Columbia in 1958. In one of the more shocking announcements in country music history, Columbia dropped Cash from the label in 1986. It did not take long before Mercury picked up Cash. He was with Mercury from 1987-1991. From the end of his deal with Mercury until he signed with Rick Rubin’s American Recordings in 1994, Cash was without a label. How could the legendary “Man in Black” be cast aside by the music industry? During that period of musical limbo, it turns out that Cash was busy recording music. That music was recently discovered by John Carter Cash, the only child of Johnny and June Carter Cash, and he decided to take the recordings and finish the productions process. Now we have a new album from Johnny Cash, Songwriter.\n\nAs the album’s title implies, Johnny Cash is the sole writer of all of this project’s songs. The original recordings were basically demos. John Carter Cash sought the help of musicians and background vocalists to add to the existing material, including Vince Gill, Marty Stuart, and Dan Auerbach. Those recognizable names adding to the recording left me with the concern that the end result could be a tangled mess of sound. However, my fears were put to rest when I listened to Songwriter. It is obvious that the focus in on the voice of Johnny Cash. Here is the track list for Songwriter:\n\nHello Out There\n\nSpotlight\n\nDrive On\n\nI Love You Tonite\n\nHave You Ever Been to Little Rock?\n\nWell Alright\n\nShe Sang Sweet Baby James\n\nPoor Valley Girl\n\nSoldier Boy\n\nSing It Pretty Sue\n\nLike A Soldier\n\nThis album is a wonderful bridge between Johnny Cash’s Mercury run and the start of his wonderful relationship with Rick Rubin and American Recordings. These songs echo the early sounds that made Cash a legend. With his American Recordings projects, many of the songs were wonderfully selected and performed covers. This new album serves to remind everyone that not only was Johnny Cash a performer, but he was also a songwriter. I recommend giving Johnny Cash’s Songwriter a listen today.\n\nApril 17, 2024\n\nIt has been many years since I have listened to an instrumental album that was led by a steel guitar player. I guess the last one I heard was one of the many Buddy Emmons LPs. Steel guitar players are not extinct, but they on the endangered list. If you are able to spot a steel guitar player in the wild, many are approaching or already at AARP age. That is why it was so exciting to find a new project from a young steel guitar player.\n\nHailing from Austin, Texas, Noah Faulker is a 16-year-old pedal steel phenom. His musical journey did not begin with steel guitar. At the age of 9, Faulkner began playing piano, teaching himself the basics. Later he began taking advanced lessons with Bukka Allen. Faulkner was introduced by Allen to legendary Texas musician, Lloyd Maines. After the introduction, Noah became interested in pedal steel guitar. Maines helped him find his first pedal steel and gave him a lesson. It turns out that is the only lesson Noah would take. He taught himself by watching videos of Maines and the aforementioned Buddy Emmons. In 2022, Noah posted his first pedal steel video on Instagram, and he was off to the races.\n\nNoah Faulkner, known professionally as Pedal Steel Noah, has just released his first EP, Texas Madness. The album is comprised of five songs. There are two original PSN compositions on the project: “Cleopatra” and “Lucy and Dixie”. The remaining three tracks are covers, but they are not songs that you would expect a pedal steel player from Texas to cover. He takes on Joy Division’s “Love Will Tear Us Apart”, The Cure’s “Just Like Heaven”, and Tears for Fears’ “Head Over Heels”. You may be shocked by that list of songs. However, it will be more shocking once you listen to the songs. PSN takes the non-country songs and makes them sound like they are country standards. Here is the complete track listing for Texas Madness:\n\nLove Will Tear Us Apart (Joy Division)\n\nJust Like Heaven (The Cure)\n\nCleopatra (Pedal Steel Noah)\n\nHead Over Heels (Tears For Fears)\n\nLucy and Dixie (Pedal Steel Noah)\n\nPedal Steel Noah received some backup in the studio from his family on Texas Madness. PSN’s dad, Jay, plays guitar and 13-year-old brother Nate plays bass. If you have watched any of Noah’s videos, you will recognize the family’s dog, Kara, gracing the EP’s cover. PSN plays with the touch of player that has been playing for decades. Who knows what the future holds for Pedal Steel Noah. Whether it is as a studio musician or backing artists at live shows, I have a feeling that we will be hearing a lot his pedal steel work down the road. If you want more information about Pedal Steel Noah, visit https://pedalsteelnoah.com/. I recommend giving Pedal Steel Noah’s Texas Madness a listen today.\n\nApril 10, 2024\n\nOver the past few years, there has been resurgence in the popularity of ‘90s country. Many up and coming artists that have been inspired by the likes of Alan Jackson, Travis Tritt, and Tracy Lawrence are, to borrow a line from the aforementioned Jackson, “chasin’ that neon rainbow.” You can hear the influence in the new artists’ releases. However, this Catch of the Week does not just pay tribute to the ‘90s country sounds. Zach Top’s Cold Beer & Country Music sounds exactly like it is pulled from that decade.\n\nZach Top may be a new name to many, but he is not a novice when it comes to performing music. The Sunnyside, Washington native began playing publically in various bluegrass bands. He landed with the group Modern Tradition, and the group was very successful, including having a #1 song (“Like It Ain’t No Thing”). In 2021, Top turned his sights to Nashville and country music.\n\nZach Top’s Cold Beer and Country Music is comprised of twelve songs, and he co-wrote each of the songs. There is plenty of fiddle, steel guitar, and piano featured throughout the project. Speaking of the instruments, it is refreshing to be able to hear every instrument individually as they are working together. I feel like a lot of today’s music, not just country, is compressed to the point that you cannot hear the important place each instrument holds in helping to paint the mood of the song. I truly enjoyed every track on this album, but some of my favorites include “Use Me”, “Dirt Turns to Gold”, “Lonely for Long”, and the title track. Here is the complete track list for Cold Beer & Country Music:\n\nSounds Like The Radio\n\nCold Beer & Country Music\n\nCowboys Like Me Do\n\nThere’s The Sun\n\nDirt Turns To Gold\n\nThe Kinda Woman I Like\n\nLonely For Long\n\nBad Luck\n\nUse Me\n\nAin’t That A Heartbreak\n\nI Never Lie\n\nThings To Do\n\nI want to take a moment to recognize the producer of Cold Beer & Country Music, Carson Chamberlain. I am sure his experience helped to inform his work on this album. Chamberlain is the former steel guitar player for the late Keith Whitley, touring manager for Alan Jackson and Clint Black, songwriter for acts like George Strait and Alan Jackson, and producer for the likes of Billy Currington and Easton Corbin. With his contributions, the expert musical performances and, most importantly, Zach Top’s outstanding vocals, you have the perfect combination to make Cold Beer & Country Music. With Zach Top being only 25-years-old, I feel like we will be hearing him on country radio for many years to come. I recommend giving Zach Top’s Cold Beer & Country Music a listen today.\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nSinger-songwriter Kelly Willis, singer and bassist Melissa Carper, and singer and guitarist Brennen Leigh are successful solo acts. In recent years, each of their individual tour stops would sometimes find the three artists packaged together for a concert date. When those occasions occurred, they not only played their individual sets, but they also would perform songs together. The merging of their powers for those special performances had many concert goers inquiring if the three had any records they had recorded together. The three singers had no such recording that they could direct people towards. However, that got them to think that maybe that it was not a bad idea to pursue a collective venture. Willis, Carper, and Leigh have just released their new project, Wonder Women of Country.\n\nThe EP includes six songs, and with the exception of a cover of John Prine’s “I Have Met My Love Today”, each song was written or co-written by Willis, Carper, and Leigh. In addition to providing lead and harmony vocals on the project, each member plays their own instruments, with Brennen Leigh playing lead guitar and mandolin, Kelly Willis on rhythm guitar, and Melissa Carper on bass. The other musicians includes Chris Scruggs on steel guitar, Geoff Queen on Dobro and steel guitar, Ginny Mac on accordion, and Timmy Campbell on drums. The project is a combination of traditional country sounds and a splash of western swing. Some of my favorite tracks include “Hanging on to You”, “Another Broken Heart”, and “I Have Met My Love Today”. Here is the complete track list for Wonder Women of Country:\n\n“Fly Ya to Hawaii”\n\n“Another Broken Heart”\n\n“Won’t Be Worried Long”\n\n“A Thousand Ways”\n\n“Hanging on to You”\n\n“I Have Met My Love Today”\n\nKelly Willis, Melissa Carper, and Brennen Leigh have done an outstanding job on their vocal delivery, musical performances, and songwriting on Wonder Women of Country Music. I also want to give a tip of the hat to the aforementioned additional musicians that also helped to craft the album. I know this collaboration is not going to be Willis, Carper and Leigh’s main gig going forward. They will continue to further their individual solo careers. However, I hope that we are given more projects in the future from this group. I recommend giving Wonder Women of Country a listen today.\n\nMarch 27, 2024\n\nThe origin of Wilson Banjo Co. is interesting and worth mentioning before reviewing their new project. After working in Nashville, TN for the Gibson Custom Art Shop and honing his craft, Steve Wilson decided to start Wilson Banjo Co. and offer customized banjos. In addition to his expert craftsmanship in the workshop, Wilson is an experienced banjo player, too. As a way to feature his custom banjos, Wilson decided to record and release a collection of songs that highlighted his customized banjos. Since that first EP, he decided to release more projects to promote his banjos. In the process of making the subsequent albums, Wilson received request to perform live with the Wilson Banjo Co. band. This has led to various artists filling the roles in the band over the years, both on the album and the stage. Besides Steve Wilson, the other almost constant member in the group is singer and fiddler Sarah Logan. Now that you have a brief background on Wilson Banjo Co., I will get to their latest release, Memory Lane.\n\nThe new album is the third full-length project for Wilson Banjo Co. Several singles have been released prior to Memory Lane coming out. The singles have done very well on various charts, including two Number 1’s. As I mentioned earlier, Wilson Banjo Co. calls on many musicians and singers to fill all the roles on a project, and Memory Lane is no exception. In addition to the banjo and vocals of Steve Wilson and the fiddle and lead and harmony vocals of Sarah Logan, the rest of the pieces of this album includes Glen Crain (resonator guitar and vocals), Jaime Carter (bass and vocals), Melanie Wilson & Colton Rudd (vocals), Tony Wray (guitar and bass), Jason Fraley (mandolin) Adam Plott (percussion), Deanie Richardson (fiddle), and Clay Hess, Heather Mabe & Joseph Welborn (guitar). In addition, Josh Raines (guitar) and Milon Williams II (mandolin) each sing lead on a song, “Don’t Forget About Maggie” and “Tomorrow’s Coming Fast” respectively. The two aforementioned tracks, along with “Sadie Danced a Hole in Her Stocking”, “Nightbird”, and “The Gavel”, are some of the album’s standout tracks. Here is the complete track listing for Memory Lane:\n\nSadie Danced A Hole In Her Stocking (written by Jack Shannon, Troy Engle, Rick Lang)\n\nTomorrow’s Coming Fast (written by Rick Lang, J. Tony Rackley)\n\nHoller (written by Jordan Rainer, Bill Packard)\n\nDon’t Forget About Maggie (written by David Stewart, Brice Long, Bobby Taylor)\n\nNightbird (written by Jordan Rainer)\n\nThe Gavel (written by Jordan Rainer, Lance Carpenter)\n\nCoalmine (written by Richie McDonald, Ron Harbin, Roxie Dean)\n\nMemphis Anymore (written by Karli Chayne, Jessica Lynne Witty)\n\nOur Last Goodbye/Walk Softly On This Heart Of Mine (written by Carter Stanley; Bill Monroe, Jack Landers)\n\nCome To Me (written by Barbie Blankenship Owens)\n\nAs per usual, the song selection from Wilson Banjo Co. is great. In addition, the singers and musicians do a great job interpreting the songs. Kudos to Steve Wilson on giving us another enjoyable project. By the way, Memory Lane by Wilson Banjo Co. is available on Pinecastle Records and available at all of the regular music download sites. I recommend giving it a listen today.\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nThis week’s Catch is a type of project that I do not review very often: an instrumental album. I actually enjoy instrumental releases. However, I realize that the percentage of people that will take time to listen to that type of album is much less than those that will check out an album that includes singing. Despite that fact, this Catch of the Week deserves to be reviewed.\n\nWyatt Ellis is the fourteen year-old mandolin prodigy that has grabbed the Music City’s attention. He has shared the stage and jammed with legends, such as Marty Stuart and Vince Gill. Even though he is young and has only been on the radar for a very short time, as soon as folks heard Wyatt Ellis play, people began to ask when he was going to release an album. That question has been answered with Wyatt Ellis’ project, Happy Valley.\n\nThe first thing to note about the songs on this album is the fact that Wyatt Ellis wrote them all. He was only twelve years-old when he penned the twelve songs that are included in Happy Valley. On top of that, Ellis invited some of the stars that he has met and played with to help out on the album. The list includes Marty Stuart, Sierra Hull, Sierra Hull, Mike Compton, and Alan Bibey. Wyatt Ellis also had Justin Moses serving as the producer on Happy Valley. Now, let’s get to the songs. It is amazing that Wyatt Ellis composed songs that sound fresh while at the same time familiar. It takes someone with a special talent to pull off such a feat. It is difficult for me to pick a favorite on the project. Each song is outstanding and just as enjoyable as the next. Here’s the complete track list for Happy Valley:\n\n1 Blue Smoke ft. Marty Stuart\n\n2 Happy Valley ft. Dominick Leslie\n\n3 Grassy Cove ft. Sierra Hull\n\n4 Get Lost ft. Jake Workman\n\n5 Little Pigeon ft. Scott Napier\n\n6 Johnson Mtn Blues ft. David McLaughlin\n\n7 Sandy Gap ft. Mike Compton\n\n8 Goin’ to Townsend ft. Alan Bibey\n\n9 Two Rivers ft. Danny Roberts\n\n10 Wildwood ft. Lauren Price Napier\n\n11 Whites Creek ft. Christopher Henry\n\n12 Maryville ft. David Harvey\n\nKudos to Wyatt Ellis, producer Justin Moses, the featured guests, and those that make up the backing band on each track of Happy Valley. Each song is vibrant, alive, and attention grabbing. I have listened to plenty of instrumental albums in my life, and, I must admit, most leave me bored by the third or fourth track. That is not the case with Happy Valley. The sky is the limit for Wyatt Ellis. Give his album, Happy Valley, a listen today.\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nAfter winning the national TV talent show, Star Search, Sawyer Brown became a mainstay on country radio in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Their hits ranged from the fun “Step That Step” to the serious “All These Years”. Since first hitting the scene in the 1980s, Sawyer Brown has undergone several lineup changes. The current lineup consists of Mark Miller (lead vocals), Gregg “Hobie” Hubbard (keys/piano), Joe Smyth (drums/percussion), and Shayne Hill (lead guitar). The band’s last release of new material was Travelin’ Band in 2011. After a thirteen years Sawyer Brown have just released a project of new material. Their latest album is Desperado Troubadours.\n\nSawyer Brown’s new project includes ten songs, many of them penned by the group’s Mark Miller and Gregg Hubbard. There are some other notable writers that contributed to the songs on Desperado Troubadours, including Cody Jinks, Tennessee Jet, Mac McAnally and Monty Criswell. As with Sawyer Brown’s earlier releases, the songs on the new album vary from the fun to the thoughtful. Some of my favorite songs on this project include “Nashville Cat”, “Socrates”, and the title track. Here is a complete track listing for Desperado Troubadours:\n\n“Under This Ole Hat” (Mark Miller / Cody Jinks / Tennessee Jet)\n\n“Nashville Cat” (Mark Miller)\n\n“I Wouldn’t Change A Thing” (Mac McAnally / Monty Criswell)\n\n“Socrates” (Mac McAnally)\n\n“The One I’ve Got” (Mark Miller)\n\n“God Bless This Road” (Mark Miller / Gregg Hubbard)\n\n“Goodnight And Good Morning” (Mac McAnally)\n\n“This Side Of The Sky” (Mark Miller / Gregg Hubbard)\n\n“Get Me To The Stage On Time” (Mark Miller)\n\n“Desperado Troubadours” (Mark Miller / Cody Jinks / Tennessee Jet)\n\nSawyer Brown was one of my favorite groups to listen to as I was growing up. So, I awaited their new album with a great deal of excitement. However, with thirteen years having passed since their last album, I had an equal amount of trepidation. Many groups that have a long hiatus between albums are not able to deliver the new music with the same magic. Once I listened to Sawyer Brown’s new album, I was totally pleased with what I heard. The Sawyer Brown sound is still there. They did not try to reinvent themselves. Instead, the group cranked out new songs in their signature style. It is worth noting that Mark Miller shared producing duties with Blake Shelton, and they deserve a tip of the hat for helping to give us this new Sawyer Brown album, Desperado Troubadours. I recommend giving it a listen today.\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\nLast year at this time I reviewed a project from a project from Brit Taylor called Kentucky Blue. Taylor’s vocals and songwriting were very impressive. In fact, the title track from that album received significant airplay on The Breakfast with Porkchop Show. So, when I saw that Brit Taylor was coming out with a new album in early 2024, I was very excited. However, when the new album was released, I thought I had accidentally grabbed Taylor’s last project. Upon further inspection, I discovered that, in fact, I had the new project. The new album from Brit Taylor is Kentucky Bluegrassed.\n\nIt is no surprise to see Taylor, a Kentucky native, releasing a bluegrass album. It seems that no matter what type of musical style you currently perform, bluegrass music is in the DNA of every musician and singer from Kentucky. The new album includes five songs from the aforementioned Kentucky Blue that have been bluegrassified. There is also three new songs on the new project (“Married”, “Church Bus”, and “Saint Anthony”), and each one is outstanding. Here is the track listing for Kentucky Bluegrassed:\n\nAnything But You\n\nRich Little Girls\n\nNo Cowboys\n\nMarried\n\nChurch Bus\n\nKentucky Blue\n\nSaint Anthony\n\nIf You Don’t Wanna Love Me\n\nBrit Taylor and husband, Adam Chaffins, gathered a band of bluegrass all-stars to help make Kentucky Bluegrassed a reality, including Stewart Duncan, Rob Ikes, Seth Taylor, Dominick Leslie, and Matt Menefee. Taylor and the rest of the musicians have created an album that feels natural. That can be very hard to, even if you have the ingredients of seasoned bluegrass musicians added to the recipe. Not only is Brit Taylor’s songs and delivery hit the bluegrass target. In addition, Brit Taylor’s vocal performance conveys the emotion each song warrants. Whether it is sass, frustration, or vulnerability, Taylor’s delivery fits the songs perfectly. I recommend giving Brit Taylor’s Kentucky Bluegrassed a listen today.\n\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\nI must admit I was a little apprehensive before giving Drake Milligan’s Dallas/Fort Worth album in 2022 it a listen when I first decided to review the project. With very few exceptions, singers that have done well on talent competition shows do not have great albums out of the gate. Milligan came in third on America’s Got Talent, and that was the reason for my apprehension. However, once I listened to Dallas/Fort Worth all of my fears subsided. The album was a big success for Milligan, and he looks to build on that foundation with the release of his new EP, Jukebox Songs.\n\nDrake Milligan’s baritone voice fits perfectly on each of the four songs on Jukebox Songs. The project starts with “What I Couldn’t Forget”, a song that sounds like it could be from George Strait’s catalog. “I Got a Problem” starts slow with Milligan singing over laid back piano playing. Then, the song increases speed with the full band behind him. “Don’t Leave Me Loving You” is a great country ballad featuring the turn of a phrase that serves as the song’s title. “Jukebox Songs and Barstool Beers” has a ‘90s era sound that will be sure to catch the ears of listeners.\n\nWith all of the comparisons I have already made about Jukebox Songs, I want to make it clear that Drake Milligan is not a nostalgia act. He is definitely influenced by his predecessors, but he is making fresh country music. With the momentum that he has gained from his previous album, I hope we will start to hear Drake Milligan’s music added to regular rotation on mainstream country stations. I recommend giving Drake Milligan’s Jukebox Songs a listen today.\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\nIt is always an adventure when I am trying to find new albums to review for the Catch of the Week. The most fun I have is when I find an album from an artist that I have never encountered before, give it a listen, and the music is outstanding. That is the case with this week’s Catch, the Castellows. The group is comprised of sisters Ellie, Powell, and Lily. The sisters are Georgia natives that not only sing and play their own instruments, they also write their own songs. The Castellows new EP is entitled A Little Goes A Long Way.\n\nThe Castellows EP contains seven songs. All are originals compositions, except “Hurricane”. You may recognize that song because it has been recorded by several artists, including the hit recording from 1981 by Leon Everette. The other six songs were either written or co-written by members of the Castellows. Each song is enjoyable, but a few of my favorites include “Cowboy Kind of Love” and “No. 7 Road”. Here is the complete track list for A Little Goes a Long Way:\n\n“A Little Goes a Long Way”\n\n“Heartline Hill”\n\n“The Part Where You Break My Heart”\n\n“No. 7 Road”\n\n“Cowboy Kind of Love”\n\n“Hurricane”\n\n“I Know It’ll Never End”\n\nThis is a great introduction for me to the Castellows. They are very talented singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists. Add to their talent the fact that the trio worked with a top notch producer, Trina Shoemaker, who has done projects with likes of Tanya Tucker, Emmylou Harris, and Nancy Griffith, and the result is an outstanding EP. I think we will be hearing more from the Castellows in the future. Be sure to give their new EP, A Little Goes a Long Way, a listen today.\n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nSister Sadie has put out several albums that I have reviewed. Since the time of those reviews, the group has undergone some member changes. Along with original members Deanie Richardson (fiddle), Gena Britt (banjo & vocals), Sister Sadie have added Jaelee Roberts (guitar & vocals), Dani Flowers (guitar & vocals), and Maddie Dalton (acoustic bass & vocals) to their lineup. The current configuration released their first single in the fall of 2022. Since then, we have had several more singles that left the fans wanting more. Well, the wait is over. Sister Sadie has just released a new album, No Fear.\n\nSister Sadie starts the album with “Willow”, a song penned by country star Ashley McBryde, that has already performed very well on the bluegrass charts. McBryde shows up later on the album, singing on “Ode to the Ozarks”. “Cannonball” is the one the latest singles from Sister Sadie, and it has also shown up on the bluegrass charts. Some other tracks that stand out include “Blue As My Broken Heart”, “Baby You’re Gone”, and the instrumental “Pad Thai Karaoke”. With that being said, there is not a track on the album that I wanted to skip. Each song is expertly executed, both musically and vocally. Here’s the complete tracklist for No Fear:\n\nWillow\n\nIf We Ain’t Drinking Then We’re Fighting\n\nBlue As My Broken Heart\n\nBaby You’re Gone\n\nMississippi River Long\n\nPad Thai Karaoke\n\nCannonball\n\nLie to Me\n\nDiane\n\nFree\n\nWell\n\nOne’s Real Life\n\nOde to the Ozarks (featuring Ashley McBryde)\n\nIt is hard to please everyone’s musical tastes. It is nearly impossible. However, Sister Sadie has gotten pretty close to doing just that on No Fear. They offer straight forward bluegrass tunes, country tinged songs, and just enough modern elements to please the traditionalists, new grass enthusiasts, and fringe bluegrass fans. I recommend giving Sister Sadie’s No Fear a listen today.\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\nRandall King has been featured in our Catch of the Week segment before, and his music has been played regularly on The Breakfast with Porkchop Show. King’s 2022 album Shot Glass, his first major label release, was a fun album to review. It was fresh and familiar at the same time. The album was full of brand new songs, but they had a sound that was reminiscent of ‘90s country music. Randall King continues with that same formula on his latest project, Into the Neon.\n\nIn a time of singles and EP releases, King’s Into the Neon is supersized. You will find eighteen tracks on this album. Randall King co-wrote six of those songs. One of my favorite tracks is the opener, “One Night Dance”. It is the classic story of a boy falling for a girl after sharing a dance. Into the Neon offers a variety of styles among the eighteen songs, and all of them have the steel guitar helping to evoke the mood of each tune. Here is the complete track list for Into the Neon:\n\nOne Night Dance\n\nSomewhere Over Us\n\nWhen My Baby’s in Boots\n\nWhat Doesn’t Kill You\n\nHang of Hangin’ On\n\nBurns Like Her\n\nGood Feelin’\n\nThe One You’re Waiting On\n\nInto The Neon\n\nTonk ‘Til I Die\n\nBut It Ain’t\n\nCoulda Been Love\n\nDamn You Look Good\n\nHard To Be Humble\n\nRight Things Right\n\nAs Far As We Go\n\nI Could Be That Rain\n\nI Don’t Whiskey Anymore\n\nMany people have classified Randall King as a neo-traditionalist. I guess that is a correct description. King seems to have been heavily influenced by the sound of ‘90s country music, especially that of George Strait. Although an identifier, such as neo-traditionalist, is meant to inform the reader about what they are getting ready to listen to. However, Randall King is more than a nostalgia act. As I mentioned earlier, his music sounds familiar, but it is fresh. I recommend giving Randall King’s Into the Neon a listen today.\n\nJanuary 24, 2024\n\nWe head to the Tar Heel State for this review. Town Mountain is a group from Asheville, North Carolina. They have released multiple projects since 2008. Their early projects were more in a bluegrass vein. Town Mountain’s more recent recordings have incorporated more country and rock sounds. However, those are just descriptions of their music. I am not trying to put their music inside a box. Town Mountain’s new project, Dance Me Down Easy: The Woodstock Sessions, continues to build on their long tradition of outstanding projects.\n\nTown Mountain headed to Woodstock, NY to record this EP. The project was recorded at Levon Helm Studios. Helm was a longtime member of The Band. He moved to Woodstock, NY and set up a recording studio. In addition, Levon Helm’s barn was the sight of his famous Midnight Ramble concerts. Town Mounatin’s Phil Barker said, “I would say Levon Helm is one of, if not, the biggest influences on this band as a whole. He was a little bit country, a little bit rock and roll, but definitely down home.” Frontman Robert Greer said, “Recording at Levon Helm’s Barn in upstate New York has an instant cool vibe. You don’t have to search for it or pay a speaker to motivate you”.\n\nTown Mountain picked six songs to cover on Dance Me Down Easy: The Woodstock Sessions. The eclectic list of artists that the group chose songs from include the Kinks, Dire Straits, J.J. Cale, the Rolling Stones, and, of course, Levon Helm. I enjoyed each song, but a couple that stood out to me is “Strangers” and the title track. Here’s the complete track list for Dance Me Down Easy: The Woodstock Sessions, including the artists that Town Mountain is covering:\n\nDevil In Disguise (J.J. Cale)\n\nDance Me Down Easy (Levon Helm)\n\nFlannery’s Reprise (Traditional)\n\nSo Far Away (Dire Straits)\n\nStrangers (The Kinks)\n\nSweet Virginia (Rolling Stones)\n\nEven if I did not know that Town Mountain’s new EP was recorded at Levon Helm’s studio, I think I would have picked up on the vibe of The Band. The 6 songs are outstanding recordings and leave me wanting more from Town Mountain. Hopefully, we will get a LP sometime in the near future. If you are new to the music of Town Mountain, I encourage you to go back and check out their entire catalog. Before you do that, give their latest project, Dance Me Down Easy: The Woodstock Sessions a listen today.\n\n*********************************************\n\nDecember 20, 2023\n\nIf anyone ever embodied the designation of “legend” in music, it is Willie Nelson. The Red Headed Stranger’s singing, songwriting, and guitar playing have been influencing other artists for over six decades. Earlier this year Willie celebrated his 90th birthday with a two-night concert extravaganza at the legendary Hollywood Bowl. That star-studded event was captured on audio and video and now is available for you to enjoy in the comfort of your own abode.\n\nLong Story Short: Willie Nelson 90 Live At The Hollywood Bowl is available in many different formats and configurations: Deluxe 2CD+Blu-ray, Digital and 2xLP. The digital edition features 13 bonus tracks, to bring the total to 52 performances. The following list may be long, but it worth noting all of the artists that showed up to pay tribute to Willie Nelson at the Hollywood Bowl: Allison Russell, Beck, Billy Strings, Bobby Weir, Booker T. Jones, Buddy Cannon, Charley Crockett, Charlie Sexton, Chris Stapleton, Daniel Lanois, Dave Matthews, Dwight Yoakam, Edie Brickell, Emmylou Harris, Gary Clark Jr., George Strait, Jack Johnson, Jamey Johnson, Keith Richards, Kris Kristofferson, Leon Bridges, Lily Meola, Lukas Nelson, Lyle Lovett, Margo Price, Micah Nelson (Particle Kid), Miranda Lambert, Nathaniel Rateliff, Neil Young, Norah Jones, Orville Peck, Rodney Crowell, Rosanne Cash, Sheryl Crow, Shooter Jennings, Snoop Dogg, Stephen Stills, The Avett Brothers, The Lumineers, Tom Jones, Tyler Childers, Warren Haynes, Waylon Payne, and Ziggy Marley.\n\nIf ever an artist deserved a two-night concert to celebrate his 90th birthday, it is Willie Nelson. The performance by Willie and all of his special guests are outstanding. It feels like each performer was not just going through the motions. They all knew how important it was to properly pay tribute to one of the greatest musical artists of all-time. This would make a great gift for the Willie Nelson fan on your Christmas list. I recommend giving Long Story Short: Willie Nelson 90 Live At The Hollywood Bowl.\n\nDecember 13, 2023\n\nBalsam Range have been making outstanding music since their founding in 2007. Throughout the group’s history they have collected multiple International Bluegrass Music Association Awards, released 13 albums, and had numerous chart topping songs. This was all done with the original band lineup: Buddy Melton (fiddle, lead and tenor vocals), Dr. Marc Pruett (banjo), Tim Surrett (bass, dobro, baritone and lead vocals), Darren Nicholson (mandolin and vocals), and Caleb Smith (guitar, lead & baritone vocals). In 2022, Nicholson left the group to pursue a solo career. The group welcomed mandolin virtuoso Alan Bibey to their ranks. With the new configuration in place, Balsam Range have just released their much anticipated new album, Kinetic Tone.\n\nThe album features 11 songs. 3 singles from the album have already charted for Balsam Range: “That’s What The Years Do” (#1), “Snake Charmer” (#3), and “We’ll All Drink Money” (#2). Some of my favorite tracks on the albums include “Marshall McClain”, the cover of Waylon Jennings’ “Just to Satisfy You”, and the Scruggs style guitar driven “Worry”. Here’s the complete tracklist for Kinetic Tone:\n\n1. Echo Canyon\n\n2. Snake Charmer\n\n3. Evergreen\n\n4. Marshall McClain\n\n5. Just to Satisfy You\n\n6. God Knows\n\n7.Two Lane Highway\n\n8. Running Out of Reasons\n\n9. Worry\n\n10. We’ll All Drink Money\n\n11. What the Years Do (with Reprise)\n\nBalsam Range, as always, delivers high quality bluegrass on Kinetic Tone. The musical performance is outstanding, the singing is top notch, and the song selections are great. I recommend giving Balsam Range’s Kinetic Tone a listen today. By the way, Balsam Range will be in concert at the Walhalla Performing Arts Center on Saturday, December 16th. For more information, visit walhallapac.com.\n\nNovember 29, 2023\n\nMy musical tastes are eclectic. Whether it is country, bluegrass, gospel, R & B, soul, rock, or pop, if the music is good, I like it. That is one of the reasons I like Jim Lauderdale’s music . He has released more than thirty albums in his career, and he has covered a lot of musical genres on those projects. Most importantly, Lauderdale’s music is always excellent. He is known not only for his varied musical catalog, but for his outstanding songwriting, with his songs being covered by numerous artists, including George Strait (“We Really Shouldn’t Be Doing This”) and Mark Chesnutt (“Gonna Get a Life”). Jim Lauderdale’s latest album, The Long and Lonesome Letting Go, is in the bluegrass genre, and is a collaboration with the Po’ Ramblin’ Boys.\n\nThe alliance between Jim Lauderdale and the Po’ Ramblin’ Boys is not a new thing. They have shared stages at various festivals over the years. Their familiarity with each other is evident on The Long and Lonesome Letting Go. It sounds as if you are listening to one act that has been recording albums together for years. Lauderdale co-wrote each of the album’s songs. 6 of the albums songs were co-written by Po’ Ramblin’ Boys guitarist Josh Rinkel. Some other writers on this project includes the award winning Becky Buller, Joe Newberry, Jimmy Ritchey, Logan Ledger, Alex Leach, and Bob Minner. The title track, my favorite on the album, was written by Minner and Lauderdale, and features a guest vocal appearance by the legendary Del McCoury.\n\nThe Long And Lonesome Letting Go Tracklist:\n\n1. Long And Lonesome Letting Go\n\n2. She’s On A Different Train\n\n3. I’m Only So Good At Being Good\n\n4. You Fell Off The Face Of The Earth\n\n5. Last Resort\n\n6. Ghost Of A Rose\n\n7. Darkness Is The Other Side of Light\n\n8. If I Could Only Get My Heart To See\n\n9. That Was When We Were Together\n\n10. A Better Place\n\n11. She’s The Light\n\n12. Drop The Hammer Down\n\nIf you are a fan of traditional bluegrass music, you will love The Long And Lonesome Letting Go. As Jim Lauderdale has done on his previous projects, he approaches whatever genre suits his fancy with an authenticity and gusto that could make you think that is the only style of music that he has ever played. The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys playing and harmonies are steeped in the old time style from the early days of bluegrass. Add Lauderdale’s lead vocals and the great songwriting to PRB’s performances, and you have one of the best traditional bluegrass albums of the year. I recommend giving Jim Lauderdale and The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys’ The Long and Lonesome Letting Go a listen today.\n\nNovember 22, 2023\n\nI was introduced to Vincent Neil Emerson in 2021 with his self-titled album. I am a big fan of singer-songwriters, and Emerson’s songs were right up my alley. He wrote all of the songs on that album, and there was something about his delivery that just drew me in. The Texan of Choctaw-Apache heritage was the authentic article. Emerson continues in the tradition of songwriters like Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, and Rodney Crowell. He adds to his great collection of recordings with his latest album, The Golden Crystal Kingdom.\n\nThe album, produced by Shooter Jennings, is full of great songs. Emerson wrote all but 2 of the album’s 12 songs. The two songs he did not write are “Time of the Cottonwood Trees” by Charley Crockett and Buffy Saint-Marie’s “Co’dine”. As expected, all of the songs are outstanding. Some of my favorites include “Time of the Rambler” and “Little Wolf’s Invincible Yellow Medicine Paint”. Here is the complete track list for The Golden Crystal Kingdom:\n\n1. Time of the Rambler\n\n2. The Golden Crystal Kingdom\n\n3. Time of the Cottonwood Trees\n\n4. I’ll Meet You in Montana\n\n5. Hang Your Head Down Low\n\n6. Cod’ine\n\n7. Blackland Prairies\n\n8. On the Banks of the Old Guadalupe\n\n9. The Man From Uvalde\n\n10. Voices (On the Spanish Isle)\n\n11. Clover on the Hillside\n\n12. Little Wolf’s Invincible Yellow Medicine Paint\n\nIt is great to see the singer-songwriter tradition continuing in such an outstanding way. Vincent Neil Emerson carries the tradition of Texas songwriters forward into modern times. Also, big kudos to the musicians on this album and producer Shooter Jennings. I cannot recommend enough giving Vincent Neil Emerson’s The Golden Crystal Kingdom a listen today.\n\nNovember 15, 2023\n\nChris Stapleton has been riding high since bursting on the country music scene in 2015 with his breakthrough album, Traveller. That album gained Stapleton acclaim from both fans and critics. His follow up projects, From A Room: Volume 1 & 2 and Starting Over earned Stapleton more adoration from the fans, as well as an armful of awards. His songs from those three albums are still getting airplay on country radio, but we have not had a new Stapleton project since 2020. Well, the wait is over. Chris Stapleton has released a new album, Higher.\n\nThe album was produced by Dave Cobb, Chris Stapleton, and his wife Morgane. Stapleton returned to Nashville’s famous RCA Studio A to record Higher. In addition to Chris Stapleton’s outstanding vocals and guitar work, I must take a moment to mention the rest of the performers on Higher. The album features Morgane Stapleton (background vocals, synthesizer, tambourine), Dave Cobb (acoustic guitar, eclectic guitar), J.T. Cure (bass), Derek Mixon (drums), Lee Pardini (organ, piano), and Paul Franklin (pedal steel). Their are 14 songs on the project, all of which Stapleton had a hand in writing. As with previous Chris Stapleton projects, Higher offers a variety of tempos and styles. Many fans will be familiar with “White Horse”. The single has received significant airplay ahead of the album’s release. However, I recommend giving the entire album a listen. Here’s a complete track list for Higher:\n\n1. What Am I Gonna Do (Chris Stapleton, Miranda Lambert)\n\n2. South Dakota (Chris Stapleton, Dave Cobb, Derek Mixon, J.T. Cure)\n\n3. Trust (Chris Stapleton, Steve McEwan)\n\n4. It Takes A Woman (Ronnie Bowman, Jerry Salley)\n\n5. The Fire (Chris Stapleton, Dave Cobb, Morgane Stapleton, Derek Mixon, J.T. Cure)\n\n6. Think I’m In Love With You (Chris Stapleton)\n\n7. Loving You On My Mind (Chris Stapleton, Kendell Marvel, Tim James)\n\n8. White Horse (Chris Stapleton, Dan Wilson)\n\n9. Higher (Chris Stapleton)\n\n10. The Bottom (Chris Stapleton, Lee Miller)\n\n11. The Day I Die (Chris Stapleton, Carolyn Dawn Johnson)\n\n12. Crosswind (Chris Stapleton, Dave Cobb, Derek Mixon, J.T. Cure)\n\n13. Weight Of Your World (Chris Stapleton, Tim Larsson, Tobias Lundgren, Johan Fransson)\n\n14. Mountains Of My Mind (Chris Stapleton)\n\nMany artists write, sing, and play their own songs. However, there is something different about Chris Stapleton. When you listen to his albums, you feel like Stapleton is giving you everything he’s got to offer, from the pen, the guitar, and his voice. I believe that is why Stapleton strikes a chord with fans and critics. I recommend giving Chris Stapleton’s Higher a listen today.\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nAt the request of some listeners of the Breakfast with Porkchop Show, this review will feature a Christmas album. This is a little earlier than I normally review new holiday releases. However, whether we like it or not, people are getting into the Christmas spirit earlier each year. Although I personally do not listen to Christmas music until after Thanksgiving, I am a man of the people. So, this week I will review Merry Christmas From Jon Pardi with the All-Nighters.\n\nJon Pardi offers a mixture of traditional songs with some original Christmas tunes. Even though I have grown tired of hearing “All I Want for Christmas is You”, it is nice to hear someone other than Mariah Carey sing the song. Pardi also offers “Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow” and “Winter Wonderland” as songs you know and can sing along. However, I am always interested in new holiday tunes, and Jon Pardi and the All Nighters offer plenty of new songs, like “Beer for Santa”, “400 Horsepower Sleigh”, the Caribbean themed “Merry Christmas From the Keys” and the western swing of “Swing on Down to Texas”. An interesting choice, but one I really enjoy, is the choice to cover the Counting Crows’ “A Long December”. Here is a complete album track list:\n\n“Beer for Santa”2. “400 Horsepower Sleigh”3. “All I Want for Christmas is You”4. “Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow”5. “Merry Christmas From the Keys”6. “Please Come Home for Christmas”7. “Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy”8. “I’ve Been Bad, Santa” (And Pillbox Patti)9. “Reindeer”10. “Swing on Down to Texas”11. “Winter Wonderland”12. “A Long December”\n\nThere you have it. One of my earliest Christmas album reviews ever. If you have already had your Christmas decorations up for at least a couple of weeks, listen to this album now. If you are staunchly opposed to consuming Christmas music until after the Thanksgiving leftovers have been put away, this recommendation is here for you whenever you are ready. Whenever you decide to give this album a listen, I think you will enjoy this country Christmas album. Give Merry Christmas from Jon Pardi with the All-Nighters a listen.\n\nNovember 1, 2023\n\nTexas has a long history of great singers, songwriters, and performers. This tradition continues to nourish the current music scene. Although it is not a prerequisite for getting an album reviewed on the Catch of the Week, it seems the artists that catch my ears quite often have Lone Star State roots. This week’s review calls for a return trip across the Red River. Our spotlight shines on a group called Flatland Cavalry. We have reviewed this group’s past albums. This week will review their just released album, Wandering Star, their first major label release.\n\nWandering Star features 13 songs. There are a lot of songwriters that contributed to the songs on this album, including Will Hoge, Jason Nix, Dwight Baker and Ashley Monroe. Several of the band’s members are also listed as songwriters, but the name that shows up on the writing credits for each album’s songs is Flatland Cavalry’s lead singer, Cleto Cordero. You may recognize him as a member of the group the Panhandlers. However, Flatland Cavalry is his primary gig. His lead singing and songwriting are on display throughout Wandering Star. There is something about the band’s approach and delivery of a song that seems to add a little sunshine to my day, even when the subject matter is less than sunny. Some of my favorite songs on the album include “Let It Roll”, “Oughta See You (The Way I Do)” and “New American Dream” and “A Thousand Miles An Hour”. Here’s a complete track listing for Wandering Star:\n\nThe Provider\n\nThe Best Days\n\nOnly Thing At All\n\nLast American Summer\n\nMornings With You\n\nLet It Roll\n\nSpinnin’\n\nDon’t Have To Do This Like That\n\nNew American Dream\n\nOughta See You (The Way I Do)\n\nA Thousand Miles An Hour\n\nBurned Out Flame\n\nForgotten\n\nFlatland Cavalry’s members are Cleto Cordero (lead vocals, guitar), Reid Dillion (electric guitar), Wesley Hall (fiddle), Jonathan Saenz (bass), Jason Albers (percussion), and Adam Gallegos (utility). The group’s musical and vocal performances are great. Add to the equation the aforementioned songwriting, and you are in store for a pleasant listening experience. I recommend giving Flatland Cavalry’s Wandering Star a listen today.\n\nOctober 25, 2023\n\nThere has been an uptick in interest by the listening public in the music of singer-songwriters. Do not misunderstand that statement. The singer-songwriters, with a few exceptions (see Chris Stapleton), do not have mainstream success on country music radio. However, everything, including music, is cyclical. The musical trend we are going through is similar to that of the 1970s, with Willie Nelson achieving mainstream success, which led to a rising interest in other singer-songwriters, like Townes Van Zandt, Jerry Jeff Walker, Guy Clark, and Billy Joe Shaver. With that observation being stated, this review will focus on a singer-songwriter outside of the mainstream. His name is John R. Miller, and his new album is Heat Comes Down.\n\nWhen you make a recommendation to someone, whether it is music or food, they want to know if it is similar to anything they are familiar with. John R. Miller has his own distinctive style, but I will play along for those that are seeking identifiers. Miller’s voice has similar qualities of Jerry Jeff Walker, while his writing is akin to that of Walker, Guy Clark, and John Prine. However, although he may bear resemblance to those artists, Miller is no copycat. Heat Comes Down features 11 songs, and all of them were penned solely by John R. Miller. With the exception of the upbeat “Conspiracies, Cults & UFOs”, every song has a laid back approach. My favorite track on this project is “Smokestacks On The Skyline”, but there is not a song that I wanted to skip. Here is the complete track list for Heat Comes Down:\n\nNobody Has to Know Your Mind\n\nInsomnia Blues\n\nHarpers Ferry Moon\n\nDitcher\n\nCrumbling Pie\n\nSmokestacks on the Skyline\n\nSummer Lens\n\nConspiracies, Cults & UFOs\n\nBasements\n\nDollar Store Tents\n\nPress On\n\nJohn R. Miller’s writing on Heat Comes Down is outstanding. It will be an inspiration for any aspiring songwriter. If you are late to the party like me, be sure to check out John R. Miller’s earlier albums. You will be glad you did. Before you do that, check out his latest album, Heat Comes Down. I highly recommend giving it a listen today.\n\nOctober 11, 2023\n\nWhen it comes to the Texas music scene, I am a huge fan. It has always been rich with talented singers, songwriters, and instrumentalist. The tradition continues with modern artists like John Baumann. He is not only a notable solo artist, but Baumann is also a member of The Panhandlers. That group features fellow Lone Star artists Josh Abbot, William Clark Green and Cleto Cordero. Whether with The Panhandlers or as a solo artist, John Baumann is a shining example of the quality songwriting and singing that the Texas music scene has to offer, and his talent is in the spotlight on his latest solo album, Border Radio.\n\nAs most people know, there is not a state in the union that boasts prouder residents than Texas. Many times the singer-songwriters from the Lone Star state use their residence as the location that their songs takes place. Baumann falls into the category. Even when he does not mention it directly, you get the feeling that the song’s backdrop is Texas. Border Radio includes 9 tracks, and Baumann either wrote or co-wrote each one. Every song is truly a class in storytelling. Some of my favorite tracks on the project include, “Revving Engines, River Street”, “The Day Before the Day of the Dead”, “South Texas Tradition”, and the title track. Here’s the complete track listing for Border Radio:\n\n1). Gold El Camino\n\n2). Revving Engine, River Street\n\n3). South Texas Tradition\n\n4). Border Radio\n\n5). My Heart Belongs to You\n\n6). Saturday Night Comes Once a Week\n\n7). The Night Before the Day of the Dead\n\n8). Turning Gold\n\n9). Boy’s Town\n\nThere are so many great artists from the Lone Star state that are making music that is listener friendly. However, you have to be an active listener because they have a lot to say. It is easy to be an active listener because John Baumann’s songs draw you in and make you pay attention. You will not be disappointed with John Baumann’s Border Radio. I recommend giving it a listen today.\n\nOctober 4, 2023\n\nBrent Cobb is one of my favorite artists that I have discovered during my never ending search for great music to review on Porkchop’s Catch of the Week. With albums like Keep ‘Em On They Toes, Shine On Rainy Day, Providence Canyon, and his gospel album And Now, Let’s Turn To Page…, the Georgia born singer-songwriter has not only won me over, but has gained many other new fans and critical acclaim. His laid back vocal style and songwriting is breath of fresh air. With the aforementioned projects, many were anxiously waiting for Cobb’s new project. The wait is over. Brent Cobb’s new album is Southern Star.\n\nBrent Cobb had a hand in writing 7 of the 10 songs on Southern Star. As expected with a Brent Cobb project, the songwriting is outstanding. The sonic experience the album provides is a mixture of southern sounds: country, soul, blues, and swampy funk. The mixture is appropriate since the album was recorded at the Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, GA. It is the same studio that the Allman Brothers Band, the Marshall Tucker Band, and the Charlie Daniels Band used to record some of their classic albums. Some of my favorite songs on the album includes “Devil Ain’t Done”, a song about someone who has done a lot of wild stuff in their time, and, even though they are older, they still have a few wild oats to sow. The song is aided by Cobb’s laidback delivery. It makes it sound like he is already making a list of crazy things to do. “Patina” is another of my favorites. It is a beautiful love song with one of my favorite lines from the project: “For worse or for better and all of the weather that comes/We’ve been together so long we put patina on love”. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed each song on Southern Star. Here is the complete track list for the album:\n\nSouthern Star\n\nIt’s a Start\n\nLivin’ the Dream\n\nPatina\n\n‘On’t Know When\n\nKick the Can\n\nDevil Ain’t Done\n\nWhen Country Came Back to Town\n\nMiss Ater\n\nShade Tree\n\nThere is one more song I want to mention. “When Country Came Back to Town” is a love letter to the independent country music scene. I am normally not a fan of songs that are centered on name dropping. However, this song is not referencing the artists that sometimes do not get the respect of mainstream country radio for some sort of credibility with music fanatics. The lines are delivered with reverence as Cobb mentions Sturgill Simpson, Brandi Carlile, Hayes Carll, Tyler Childers, Jason Isbell, The Turnpike Troubadours, and many others. He also mentions those mainstream artists that have the same spirit as the independent darlings, including Miranda Lambert and Chris Stapleton. Brent Cobb’s name must be included in the list. He always delivers outstanding songwriting, sans trucks on backroads, with his southern molasses laid back vocals that puts him among the aforementioned artists. I recommend giving Brent Cobb’s Southern Star a listen today.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023\n\nSince hitting the national scene in 2017, Ashley McBryde has gained critical acclaim and commercial success. I believe one of the reasons for her success is that McBryde’s vocals make her easily recognizable in a landscape of sound alike artists. Another reason is her songwriting talent. McBryde’s songwriting is step above much of what is offered in today’s mainstream country landscape. Those talents are on display again on Ashley McBryde’s latest album is The Devil I Know.\n\nThe album features 12 songs, all of which Ashley McBryde had a hand in writing. You get a variety of moods throughout the album, from the rocking opening track “Made For This” to the final tender, yet powerful, “6th of October”. The lead single, “Light On In the Kitchen”, is a great song that has performed very well on the charts. There are so many other great tracks on the album too. However, a few that stood out include “Coldest Beer in Town”, a song full of heartache. “Learned To Lie” is a raw, confessional song that deals with family issues. “Coolest Little Bars” is a loving salute to the unique watering holes everywhere. Here’s the complete track list for The Devil I Know:\n\nMade For This (Ashley McBryde and Travis Meadows)\n\nColdest Beer in Town (Ashley McBryde, Autumn McEntire and Nicolette Hayford)\n\nLight On In The Kitchen (Ashley McBryde, Jessi Alexander and Connie Harrington)\n\nWomen Ain’t Whiskey (Ashley McBryde, Hillary Lindsey, Jon Nite and Chris LaCorte)\n\nLearned To Lie (Ashley McBryde, Nicolette Hayford and Sean McConnell)\n\nThe Devil I Know (Ashley McBryde, Jeremy Stover and Bobby Pinson)\n\nSingle At The Same Time (Ashley McBryde, Benjy Davis and Andy Albert)\n\nCool Little Bars (Ashley McBryde, Trick Savage and Lainey Wilson)\n\nWhiskey and Country Music (Ashley McBryde, John Osborne and Lee Thomas Miller)\n\nBlackout Betty (Ashley McBryde, Aaron Raitiere and Nicolette Hayford)\n\n6th Of October (Ashley McBryde, Blue Foley and CJ Field)\n\nWhen it comes to McBryde’s songwriting and singing, her talent puts her near the top of the list of country artists today. Listening to her projects, you do not get the feeling that she is releasing songs or albums just to fill a contracted commitment. McBryde takes great care in the crafting and presentation of each song. You can hear and feel that on this album. I recommend giving Ashley McBrydes’s The Devil I Know a listen today.\n\nSeptember 20, 2023\n\nThe legendary Willie Nelson’ singing, songwriting, and guitar playing have been influencing artists for over six decades. The Red Headed Stranger has released an unbelievable number of albums during his career. In recent years he has released two or three albums each year. Although mostly closely associated with country music, Nelson has released albums in many different genres. His latest album finds Willie trying his hand at performing his songs in a bluegrass style.\n\nInstead of writing or searching for new songs for this album, Willie takes the same approach that Sturgill Simpson employed on his Cuttin’ Grass albums. Nelson’s Bluegrass album features twelve of his previous songs done in the aforementioned genre. Willie turned to his recent go to producer Buddy Cannon to help him with the song selection. Because I am such a fan of Willie Nelson’s music, it is difficult to pick a favorite track on the album. They all sound great with the bluegrass treatment. Here is the complete track listing for Willie Nelson’s Bluegrass:\n\nNo Love Around\n\nSomebody Pick Up My Pieces\n\nGood Hearted Woman\n\nSad Songs And Waltzes\n\nHome Motel\n\nYou Left Me A Long, Long Time Ago\n\nYesterday’s Wine\n\nBloody Mary Morning\n\nSlow Down Old World\n\nStill Is Still Moving To Me\n\nOn The Road Again\n\nMan With The Blues\n\nThis album’s success is due in large part to the cast of pickers that serve as Willie’s backing band on Bluegrass. The all-star lineup includes Aubrey Haynie on fiddle, Rob Ickes on reso-guitar, Ron Block is on banjo, Barry Bales on bass, Dan Tyminski and Seth Taylor on mandolin, Josh Martin and Bob Terry on guitars. Add to that, Mickey Raphael on harmonica, and Buddy and Melanie Cannon singing harmony. As I have said many times before, long live Willie Nelson. Check out his latest album, Bluegrass.\n\nSeptember 13, 2023\n\nWith the flurry of albums released in the last few months, plus new albums released each week, it is taking me a while to get to all of the projects that deserve to be reviewed. I am happy to finally getting around to reviewing the new album from Dale Ann Bradley. She is one of the foremost female vocalists in bluegrass music today, and she has been for many years. Bradley has received six IBMA Female Vocalist of the Year awards, and is a member of the Kentucky Hall of Fame. It has been a few years since her last release. Her much anticipated new album, Kentucky For Me, has been released.\n\nAs you might suspect by the album’s title, the album is a tribute to Kentucky, Dale Ann Bradley’s home state. There is a Kentucky connection in each track, either through the subject matter of the song or with fellow guest artists who are Kentuckians. There are eleven tracks in all on Kentucky For Me, and, as expected with a Dale Ann Bradley album, she is not afraid to cover songs from other genres in a bluegrass style. Some of my favorite tracks on this project include “The Sun is Going to Shine” featuring JP Pennington of the chart-topping country group Exile, Bradley and Dave Adkins covering the Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers/Stevie Nicks’ collaboration “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around”, and the title track (written by Tom T. Hall) which is a duet with Larry Cordle. Here’s a complete track listing for Kentucky For Me:\n\nThe Sun Is Going To Shine feat. JP Pennington (written by JP Pennington, Amanda Rae Martin)\n\nKentucky Gold feat. Sam Bush (written by W. Carson, Ronnie Reno)\n\nKentucky For Me feat. Larry Cordle (written by Tom T. Hall)\n\nDogwood Winter (written by Steve Gulley, Tim Stafford)\n\nAppalachian Blue feat. John Cowan (written by Donna Anderson, Michael Anderson)\n\nOne By One feat. Danny Paisley (written by Jack Anglin, Jim Anglin, Johnnie Wright)\n\nI’m Just An Old Chunk of Coal feat. John Conlee (written by Billy Joe Shaver)\n\nGod Already Has (written by Mark Brinkman, David Stewart)\n\nLove Train feat. Rebecca Lynn Howard(written by Kim Fox)\n\nPoor Man’s Pride feat. The Po’ Ramblin’ Boys (written by Catherine Elisabeth Britt, Guy Charles Clark, Jerry Dean, JR Salley)\n\nStop Draggin’ My Heart Around feat. Dave Adkins (written by Mike Campbell, Tom Petty)\n\nEven though I mentioned my favorite tracks, I want to point out that there is not a track I wanted to skip. This is one of those albums I can listen to again and again. In fact, when it comes to Dale Ann Bradley’s projects, this is par for the course. The singing, playing, song selection, and production is outstanding. I recommend giving Dale Ann Bradley’s new album, Kentucky For Me, a listen today.\n\nSeptember 6, 2023\n\nThe Turnpike Troubadours have been making music together since 2005. They started releasing albums in 2007 and have steadily gained an ever growing fan base. The Turnpike Troubadours were introduced to a wider audience when their music was included in TV series Yellowstone. The band took a hiatus in 2019, and many fans were devastated, thinking this was the end of one of the more popular Red Dirt Music acts. Rumors started to swirl in 2021 that the band may be hitting the road and working on an album. They were back to performing together in 2022, and they have just released a new album, A Cat in the Rain.\n\nThe Turnpike Troubadours members are the same as you remember: Evan Felker (vocals, guitar), RC Edwards (bass), Hank Early (pedal steel), Kyle Nix (fiddle), Ryan Engleman (electric guitar), and Gabe Pearson (drums). The new project features 10 songs, many written by the group’s lead vocalist, Evan Felker. As usual the Troubadours songs have a quality more akin to Jerry Jeff Walker and Guy Clark than any mainstream country. There is not a track I wanted to skip on this album, but one of my favorite tracks on the album is “Mean Old Sun”. Here is a complete track listing for A Cat in the Rain:\n\nMean Old Sun\n\nBrought Me\n\nLucille\n\nChipping Mill\n\nThe Rut\n\nA Cat in the Rain\n\nBlack Sky\n\nEast Side Love Song (Bottoms Up)\n\nThree More Days\n\nWon’t You Give Me One More Chance\n\nThe songwriting and song selection on A Cat in the Rain is outstanding. The musical performances, as always, are soulfully superb. I have to mention Shooter Jennings, the producer of the album. With a group like the Turnpike Troubadours, the wrong producer could destroy the feeling that the group conveys in their musical and vocal delivery. It seems that Jennings set the table for the Troubadours to naturally shine through. I highly recommend giving the Turnpike Troubadours’ A Cat in the Rain a listen today.\n\nAugust 30, 2023\n\nTim O’Brien is a highly regarded singer, songwriter and musician. Whether playing with Hot Rize, touring and recording with other artists, or as a solo artist, his talent is evident through his expansive body of work. Even though he is respected, I do not believe that Tim O’Brien’s genius is truly appreciated. He has always been able to transfer effortlessly from one genre to the next without a hiccup. Most importantly, the transitions are not just for the point of showing off his versatility, as some artists are known to do. Rather, Tim O’Brien’s approach is to give each individual song whatever musical underpinning it needs, and he is an expert at doing just that. Tim O’Brien’s expertise is on display on his latest offering, Cup of Sugar.\n\nAlthough Tim O’Brien has had a long career, this is the first album he has ever released that he had a hand in writing every one of the project’s songs. I have always enjoyed his unique writing style, and it is on full display on Cup of Sugar. There are songs from the perspective of animals (“Thinkin’ Like a Fish” and “Bear”), a grave digger (“The Pay’s a Lot Better Too”), and even Walter Cronkite (“The Anchor”). It is truly hard for me to choose a favorite song from this album. As soon as I listen to a song and I think I have discovered my favorite tune on this project, the next song comes on, and my mind is changed. Here’s a track listing for Cup of Sugar:\n\nBear\n\nLet the Horses Run\n\nStuck in the Middle\n\nThinkin’ Like a Fish\n\nCup of Sugar\n\nThe Pay’s a Lot Better Too\n\nShout Lulu\n\nThe Anchor\n\nShe Can’t, He Won’t and They’ll Never\n\nDiddleye Day\n\nLittle Lamb Little Lamb\n\nGoodbye Old Friend\n\nGila Headwaters\n\nAlthough Tim O’Brien is a highly respected artist, I believe he is not fully appreciated. His expert musicianship and that of the other musicians on the album flow effortlessly in various styles from song to song. O’Brien’s ability to write and perform songs that have multiple layers is amazing. He can deliver songs that on the surface are humorous. However, just below the surface the same lyrics can be thought provoking. I highly recommend giving Tim O’Brien’s Cup of Sugar a listen today.\n\nAugust 23, 2023\n\nThere has been a swell of popularity of singer-songwriters in country music circles. Although they are not regulars on country music radio, fans have sought out those songwriters that display gritty authenticity that has not been polished by the Nashville music machine. Some of the artists that have made a mark include Cody Jinks, Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, Tyler Childers, Colter Wall, and Margo Price. It seems that some major labels have realized that there is money to be made with the rising class of singer-songwriters. Many of the labels have moved to sign these artists. This week’s review is from one of the new major label signees.\n\nColby Acuff’s first major label release, Western White Pines, is out on Sony Music Nashville. The Idaho native is not a novice when it comes to music. He began learning instruments at the age of 5, and he performed for the first time at the age of 12. Acuff has released three independent albums before Western White Pines. He wrote or co-wrote each of the new album’s 10 tracks. Acuff’s vocals have a laid back approach that puts me in mind of Brent Cobb, although the two have different tones to their voices. Some of the tracks that stand out include “Boy and a Bird Dog”, a song that switches back and forth from the perspective of the aforementioned boy and dog. The title track is so well written that you can almost see the landscape that Acuff describes. “Better Man” propels the outlaw spirit that is interwoven throughout the entire project. Here’s the complete track list for Western White Pines:\n\nWestern White Pines\n\nOne Day At A Time\n\nPlaying God Again\n\nOutlaw in Me\n\nBoy And A Bird Dog\n\nBetter Man\n\nHard Livin’ Life\n\nWelcome to Toms\n\nAll I Got\n\nRolling With The Wind\n\nHaving a major label release will definitely help draw attention to any artist’s music. Colby Acuff might be new to the major label, but he has put in the time as an independent artist and those projects deserves a listen, too. The songwriting, singing, and musical performances on this new project are outstanding. I highly recommend giving Colby Acuff’s Western White Pines a listen today.\n\nAugust 16, 2023\n\nIn recent years, Ward Davis has become one of my favorite songwriters. I became familiar with him through his 2015 release 15 Years in a 10 Year Town. Whether through his solo work, teaming up with Cody Jinks, or having his songs covered by the likes of Trace Adkins, Willie Nelson & Merle Haggard, I have enjoyed Davis’ work. I reviewed his album Black Cats and Crows in 2020, and it was one of that year’s best projects. I must admit that his latest project somehow slipped under my radar. That is why I not only look to the list of albums’ future release dates, but also check to see if I missed anything. Inevitably, I will often find a gem when I take a second look, and I have found another one in Ward Davis’ Sunday Morning.\n\nThe project’s title may lead you to think that this is a gospel album. I guess you can say it is, but not in the traditional sense. You will not find covers of well-known hymns or worship songs. Rather, this album is an emotional, raw look at the spiritual and human struggles that people encounter every day. By the way, he tackles the deep subject matter, and nails it, in only 4 songs. It is truly amazing how Davis’ words and vocals draw you into the song. You can almost feel the emotions that he presents in each song. Of the songs, Ward Davis had a hand in writing 3 of the 4 songs: “Day One” (written w/Greg Jones), “Into the River” (written w/the project’s producer Jim “Moose” Brown), and “Goodbye World” (written by Davis). He also includes a soulful version of James Taylor’s “Lo and Behold”. Each song is great, but my favorite is “Day One”. The song is about the struggles of a recovering addict. I think the song will resonate with many listeners who have dealt with addiction personally, or those that have had addicted friends and family members.\n\nWard Davis is able to deeply touch your emotions in 4 songs in a way that some artists are unable to do on full length album. That speaks to his writing talent. In addition to his expert songwriting, Davis’s delivery conveys emotions that intensify the EP’s impact on the listener. I have been a fan of Ward Davis for many years. This new project has done nothing but strengthen my admiration of his work. I recommend giving Ward Davis’ Sunday Morning a listen today.\n\nAugust 9, 2023\n\nOn their own, Vince Gill and Paul Franklin are masters at their craft. Gill is known for his tenor vocals and hot guitar licks, while Franklin is one of country music’s greatest steel guitar players. The two combined their forces over 10 years ago on the critically acclaimed album Bakersfield. That album was a tribute to the music of Merle Haggard and Buck Owens. Vince Gill and Paul Franklin have teamed up again for another tribute album, Sweet Memories: The Music of Ray Price & The Cherokee Cowboys.\n\nWhile Bakersfield featured many songs that were easily recognizable, the new album finds Gill and Franklin took a different approach. You will not find Ray Price’s well-known hits, like “Heartaches By The Number”, “Crazy Arms” or “For The Good Times”. Rather, they dive deep into Ray Price’s extensive catalog. To be more accurate, Vince Gill and Paul Franklin searched for the music of not only Ray Price, but of his band, The Cherokee Cowboys. Ray Price’s career is divided into two parts: the 1950s honky tonk style, featuring the 4/4 “Ray Price Shuffle”, and the 1960s string laden tracks that helped push forward what would become known as the “Nashville Sound”. Although this album features songs from both sections of Ray Price’s recording career, you will not find lush string arrangements. This is a honky tonk project, even on the slower songs. Here is the complete track listing for Sweet Memories: The Music of Ray Price & The Cherokee Cowboys:\n\nOne More Time {written by Mel Tillis}\n\nI’d Fight The World {written by Hank Cochran and Joe Allison}\n\nYou Wouldn’t Know Love {written by Hank Cochran and Dave Kirby}\n\nWalkin’ Slow (And Thinking ‘Bout Her) {written by Bobby Bare and Lance Guynes}\n\nThe Same Two Lips {written by Marty Robbins}\n\nWeary Blues From Waitin’ {written by Hank Williams Sr.}\n\nKissing Your Picture (Is So Cold) {written by Mel Tillis, Ray Price and Wayne Walker)\n\nSweet Memories {written by Mickey Newbury}\n\nDanny Boy {written by Fred E. Weatherly}\n\nYour Old Love Letters {written by Ray Price}\n\nHealing Hands Of Time {written by Willie Nelson}\n\nVince Gill and Paul Franklin have done it again. Their attempt to pay tribute to the legends of country music, first with Merle Haggard & Buck Owens, and now Ray Price & The Cherokee Cowboys, hits the bullseye. Unlike a lot of tribute albums, this album is alive and fresh with Gill and Franklin’s musical interpretations. I hope that every listener, whether longtime Ray Price fans or new country music, will enjoy the album. Then, go back and dig into the catalog of Ray Price & The Cherokee Cowboys, a group that over the years featured many future country superstars, including Johnny Paycheck, Roger Miller, and Willie Nelson. I know Vince Gill and Paul Franklin have busy schedules, but I hope they will continue to pay tribute to past country stars. I recommend giving Vince Gill and Paul Franklin’s Sweet Memories: The Music of Ray Price & The Cherokee Cowboys a listen today.\n\nAugust 2, 2023\n\nMolly Tuttle’s music is no stranger to the Catch of the Week. Her albums When You’re Ready and Crooked Tree were both reviewed here. In case you are not familiar with Molly Tuttle, let me give you a quick look at her background. Molly Tuttle has been playing guitar since she was 8 years old, performing on stage for the first time at the age of 11 with her father, Jack. Tuttle’s songwriting skills were evident at an early age, winning the Chris Young songwriting competition at MerleFest. She also received a scholarship in 2012 to Berklee School of Music. Tuttle also has the distinction of being the first woman to win the International Bluegrass Music Association Guitar Player of the Year Award in 2017. For an encore, she repeated as the 2018 award winner. Molly also won the 2022 IBMA Female Vocalist of the Year Award, and Best Bluegrass Album at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards for Crooked Tree. That album was her first bluegrass style album. Her latest project, City of Gold, continues in the bluegrass vein.\n\nMolly Tuttle not only brought her voice and hot guitar licks to the recording sessions for City of Gold, but she also brought her pen. Tuttle co-wrote all of the albums songs. There are a few other writers on the album, but Ketch Secor (Old Crow Medicine Show) co-wrote every song on the project. All of the tracks on the album are outstanding. A few of my favorites include “El Dorado”, a song that paints a picture of characters involved in the gold rush. I also enjoyed “San Joaquin”, the story of a smuggler on a train. It is high speed bluegrass storytelling at its’ best. “Yosemite”, a duet featuring Dave Matthews, is a well-crafted song about a couple going through some rough patches in their relationship and how they hope to fix the problems. I will mention one more song that stood out on City of Gold. “Alice in the Bluegrass” is a retelling of Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland”, except in a rural setting. Here is the complete tracklisting for Molly Tuttle & Golden Highway’s City of Gold:\n\nEl Dorado\n\nWhere Did All the Wild Things Go?\n\nSan Joaquin\n\nYosemite (feat. Dave Matthews)\n\nNext Rodeo\n\nWhen My Race Is Run\n\nAlice in the Bluegrass\n\nStranger Things\n\nDown Home Dispensary\n\nMore Like a River\n\nGoodbye Mary\n\nEvergreen, OK\n\nThe First Time I Fell in Love\n\nMolly Tuttle & Golden Highway are comprised of top shelf pickers. In addition to Molly Tuttle on guitar, there is Bronwyn Keith-Hynes on fiddle, Dominick Leslie playing mandolin, Kyle Tuttle on banjo, and bassist Shelby Means. Jerry Douglas adds dobro on several tracks. He also serves as co-producer on City of Gold, along with Molly Tuttle. With the great playing, singing, songwriting, and production, City of Gold is one of the most enjoyable listening experiences I have encountered this year. I recommend giving it a listen today.\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\nLori McKenna is a well-known, and respected, as a songwriter. She has written hit songs for many artists, becoming the first woman ever to win the CMA Song of the Year Award two years in a row (2015’s Little Big Town’s “Girl Crush” and 2016’s Tim McGraw’s “Humble and Kind”). In 2017, McKenna also was the first female to be awarded the ACM Songwriter of the year, and she won the 2021 Best Country Song Grammy Award for her hand in writing The Highwomen’s “Crowded Table”. Although she has been recognized as one of the preeminent country music songwriters of our time, she is largely overlooked as performer. Her previous albums, The Bird and The Rifle and The Tree, and The Balladeer are testaments to McKenna’s talents. Those gifts are on display again on Lori McKenna’s latest album, 1988.\n\nAs expected, Lori McKenna wrote or co-wrote each of the album’s 10 tracks. Her songwriting is what she is mainly known for. However, as I noted previously, I love to hear her sing. McKenna’s voice sounds great on 1988. The album’s name is a reference to the year she and her husband married. In addition to the nod to her husband, Lori McKenna gets some other family members involved in this project. Her son Chris co-wrote “Happy Children”, while her other son, Brian, co-wrote the title track. Lori McKenna has an ability to write songs in which the listener can connect. Some of my favorite tracks on the album include, “The Old Woman in Me”, “The Town in Your Heart”, and “The Tunnel”. Here is the complete tracklist for Lori McKenna’s 1988:\n\nLori McKenna – 1988\n\nThe Old Woman in Me\n\nHappy Children\n\nKilling Me feat. Hillary Lindsey\n\nDays Are Honey\n\n1988\n\nGrowing Up\n\nWonder Drug\n\nThe Town in Your Heart\n\nLetting People Down\n\nThe Tunnel\n\nLori McKenna is one of my favorite current singer-songwriters. She is one of Nashville’s favorites, too. When artists are heading to the studio to begin a new album they turn to Lori McKenna. McKenna’s songs have a way of pulling you in from the first lyrics to the last word. I must mention that Dave Cobb serves as the producer on 1988. He shows again that he has an expert ability to highlight the talents of the artist he is working with. The focus is on McKenna’s voice, and her ability to tell stories through songs that are relatable. I recommend giving 1988 a listen today.\n\nJuly 19, 2023\n\nWe were introduced to the music of Colter Wall through his 2018 album, Songs of the Plains. Then, we reviewed his excellent album Western Swing & Waltzes and Other Punchy Songs. The 28 year-old Canadian’s baritone voice sounds much older than his years, and it is one of the most unusual, recognizable voices today. I have never been a cowboy, but hearing Wall’s music made me wish I was a cowpoke, sitting around a campfire, and listening to trail songs after a hard day riding the range. His songs are truly the western in country & western music. In addition to the western songs, Wall does his fair share of honky tonk tunes. Colter Wall is back with a new album that again mixes country and western and honky tonk songs.\n\nLittle Songs includes ten songs, nine of which Colter Wall wrote. The lone exception is the Hoyt Axton/Ken Higginbotham song, “Evangelina”. From the opening track, “Prairie Evening/Sage Brush Waltz”, to the final track, “The Last Loving Words”, Colter Wall transports the listener to western settings that most have only seen on TV and in the movies. Some of my favorite tracks on Little Songs include, “Prairie Evening/Sagebrush Waltz”, “The Coyote & The Cowboy”, “Cow/Calf Blue Yodel”, and “Honky Tonk Nighthawk”. Here’s the complete track listing for Little Songs:\n\nPrairie Evening/Sagebrush Waltz\n\nStanding Here\n\nCorralling The Blues\n\nThe Coyote & The Cowboy\n\nHonky Tonk Nighthawk\n\nFor a Long While\n\nCow/Calf Blue Yodel\n\nLittle Songs\n\nEvangelina\n\nThe Last Loving Words\n\nColter Wall is a DYI artist. He wrote the songs, sang, played guitar, and co-produced Little Songs. The other co-producer on this album was Patrick Lyons. He also played multiple instruments on this project, including pedal steel, mandolin, and dobro, just to name a few. The other musicians on Little Songs include, Doug Moreland (fiddle), Jason Simpson (bass), Jake Groves (harmonica), and Russell Patterson (drums). The instrumental work paired with Wall’s lyrics and vocals were a perfect equation to make Little Songs such an enjoyable album. If you are looking to escape from what is routinely offered on mainstream country radio and want something a little more honest and authentic, give Little Songs a listen.\n\nJuly 12, 2023\n\nBrennen Leigh is a respected singer-songwriter. She has achieved success as a songwriter, with her songs having been recorded by Lee Ann Womack, Rodney Crowell, and Sunny Sweeney. It was my pleasure to review her superb 2022 album Obsessed With the West featuring Asleep at the Wheel. It was a wonderful foray into the world of western swing. I would be lying if I did not say I was curious how Brennen Leigh was going to follow such a well-received project. I do not have to wonder any longer because Brennen Leigh’s new album, Ain’t Through Honky Tonkin’ Yet, has just been released.\n\nThe new project features twelve new songs. Brennen Leigh is credited as the writer or co-writer on each of the songs. The music on Ain’t Through Honky Tonkin’ Yet is outstanding. The fiddle, steel guitar, piano, and upright bass capture the sound of 1950s & ‘60s Nashville. Just as I was amazed with Leigh’s ability to write new songs in a western swing style on Obsessed With the West, she does again on the new album. If you did not know better, you would think that Brennen Leigh is covering classic songs. Some of my favorite songs on Ain’t Through Honky Tonkin’ Yet include “Running Out of Hope, Arkansas”, a song that would also sound great as a bluegrass song. I also liked the ode of a truck driving queen, “Carole With An E” and the hilarious “You Turned Into a Dragon”. “Mississippi Rendezvous” might be the best track on the album. Leigh’s vocals are top notch, as well as the call and response on the chorus between her and the backup singers. Here’s the complete track listing for Ain’t Through Honky Tonkin’ Yet:\n\nRunning Out of Hope, Arkansas\n\nSomebody’s Drinking About You\n\nThe Red Flags You Were Waving\n\nI Ain’t Through Honky Tonkin’ Yet\n\nMississippi Rendezvous\n\nCarole With An E\n\nThe Bar Should Say Thanks\n\nEvery Time I Do\n\nThrowing Away a Precious Jewel\n\nI’m Still Looking for You\n\nWhen Lonely Came to Town\n\nYou Turned Into a Dragon\n\nJust as Brennen Leigh embraced western swing on Obsessed With the West, she nails the honky tonk sounds of Nashville’s golden era. In addition to Leigh’s outstanding songwriting and singing, Chris Scruggs (Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives) serves as the producer, as well as playing guitar, and provided background vocals. Others that contributed to the album include Marty Stuart (mandolin), Aaron Till (fiddle and acoustic guitar), Tommy Hannum (pedal steel and dobro), Micah Hulscher (piano), Alec Newman (upright bass), and Nate Felty (drums). There are several folks that provided background vocals, including Rodney Crowell. If you need a dose of pure country music, Brennen Leigh has just what you are looking for on Ain’t Through Honky Tonkin’ Yet. I recommend giving it a listen today.\n\nJune 28, 2023\n\nDan Tyminski has been a fixture in bluegrass music since the 1990s, playing with the Lonesome River Band before joining Alison Krauss & Union Station in 1994. He went on to critical and commercial success for his recording of the classic “I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow” for the ‘O Brother, Where Art Thou’ movie soundtrack, and his collaboration with Avicii on the song “Hey Brother”. Tyminski has also released several solo albums, and created the Dan Tyminski Band to tour in support of his solo projects when AKUS is on hiatus. His incredible vocals and strong rhythm guitar work is emulated by bluegrassers everywhere. In 2022, Tyminski released his tribute to the late Tony Rice, the excellent EP One More Time Before You Go: A Tribute to Tony Rice. With the release of that EP, word came out that he was working on a full length album to be released in 2023. Well, the wait is over. Dan Tyminski’s new album, God Fearing Heathen, is now available.\n\nThe new album features 10 songs, and with the exception of a bluegrass rendition of “Hey Brother”, all of the songs are new. Tyminski co-wrote many of the songs on God Fearing Heathen. Some of my favorite tracks include “Hey Brother”, “Occam’s Razor”, “G.O.A.T”, “Keep Your Eyes on Kentucky”, “Silence in the Brandy”, and the title track. Here is the complete track listing for the album:\n\nGod Fearing Heathen\n\nNever Comin’ Home\n\nHey Brother\n\nKeep Your Eye on Kentucky\n\nNever Met a Stranger\n\nSilence in the Brandy\n\nGod Fearing Heathen\n\nG.O.A.T\n\nNo Song to Sing\n\nOccam’s Razor\n\nOde to Jimmy\n\nIt goes without saying that Dan Tyminski is the star of this album. However, the supporting cast, the Dan Tyminski Band, is a huge part of this album’s greatness. The band consists of Jason Davis on banjo, Gaven Largent on dobro, Maddie Denton on fiddle, Harry Clark on mandolin, and Grace Davis on bass. Their expert playing, Tyminski’s powerful vocals and musicianship, along with the outstanding songwriting make God Fearing Heathen a definite keeper. I recommend giving it a listen today.\n\nJune 21, 2023\n\nMarty Stuart has an elite musical pedigree that includes performing and touring with Country Music Hall of Famers Lester Flatt and Johnny Cash, having success as a solo artist in the 1990s, being a member of the Grand Ole Opry for over 30 years, and being inducted to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2020. With that long list of accomplishments, you could not blame Stuart if he leaned back and propped up his cowboy boots and just relaxed. However, that does not seem to be something that is in his DNA. Marty Stuart has been touring and recording with his group, The Fabulous Superlatives, since 2002, and he is not just going through the motions. Stuart’s voracious desire to create new music seems to be one of his driving forces. Since beginning the Catch of the Week over ten years ago, I have had the pleasure of reviewing several Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives albums. I am happy to say that it is time to review a brand new album from Marty and the guys. The project is called Altitude.\n\nIt has been six years since Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives last album, Way Out West, was released. Altitude seems to be a sonic continuation of Way Out West. The best way to describe the sound is cosmic country. Stuart pays tribute to his influences on Altitude, from the Byrds inspired “Sitting Alone” to the Johnny Cash styled “Tomahawk”. There are also three musical interludes, called “Lost Byrd Space Train”, throughout the album that ties the project together with a certain vibe. Here is a complete track listing for the album –\n\nAltitude:\n\n1) Lost Byrd Space Train (Scene 1)\n\n2) Country Star\n\n3) Sitting Alone\n\n4) A Friend Of Mine\n\n5) Space\n\n6) Altitude\n\n7) Vegas\n\n8) The Sun Is Quietly Sleeping\n\n9) Lost Byrd Space Train (Scene 2)\n\n10) Night Riding\n\n11) Tomahawk\n\n12) Time To Dance\n\n13) The Angels Came Down\n\n14) Lost Byrd Space Train (Epilogue)\n\nMarty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives – Kenny Vaughan (guitar), Harry Stinson (drums) and Chris Scruggs (bass and steel guitar) – have done it again. They are top notch instrumentalists and singers. Like skilled scientists in a lab, Stuart and The Superlatives have taken parts of the Bakersfield Sound, Byrds California country, and Johnny Cash’s Tennessee Three, and made a new musical compound. I highly recommend giving Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives’ album, Altitude, a listen today.\n\nJune 14, 2023\n\nJason Isbell is lauded as one of this generation’s preeminent songwriters. Since his time as a member of The Drive By Truckers, the world has seen Isbell grow as a songwriter and performer. He has been on quite a streak since the release of Southeastern (2013). During that time, Isbell has won multiple Grammy Awards and Americana Music Honors and Awards. Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit’s latest album is Weathervanes.\n\nJason Isbell wrote all of the albums 13 songs, and, after successfully teaming with producer Dave Cobb on for several of his releases, Isbell dons the producer cap on Weathervanes. This album has a variety of styles (country, folk, and rock). If you have followed Isbell’s career, it is almost expected. The mixture of styles would be a detriment to many artists. However, Jason Isbell seems at home, no matter the style. I will not try to break down the songs here because it would not do justice to the craftsmanship each track displays. I enjoyed each song on the album, but some of my favorite tracks on Weathervanes include, “Strawberry Woman”, “King of Oklahoma”, “Cast Iron Skillet”, “White Beretta”, and his tribute to Justin Townes Earle, “When We Were Close”. Here’s the complete track list for Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit’s Weathervanes:\n\n1. Death Wish\n\n2. King of Oklahoma\n\n3. Strawberry Woman\n\n4. Middle of the Morning\n\n5. Save the World\n\n6. If You Insist\n\n7. Cast Iron Skillet\n\n8. When We Were Close\n\n9. Volunteer\n\n10. Vestavia Hills\n\n11. White Beretta\n\n12. This Ain’t It\n\n13. Miles\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed Jason Isbell’s music over the years. From his work with the Drive By Truckers, his solo work, and with the 400 Unit, Jason Isbell has released some outstanding records. As far as his work with the 400 Unit, I think Weathervanes is the most complete presentation of what they are able to present musically. It almost goes without saying that Jason Isbell’s songwriting is outstanding. It seems that the producer hat fits him pretty well, too. I recommend giving Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit’s Weathervanes a listen today.\n\nJune 7, 2023\n\nWhen I reviewed Tanya Tucker’s While I’m Livin project in 2019, I said that I have always believed that Tanya Tucker was overlooked in the pantheon of country music legends. I suspect it was because she is a woman. There have been plenty of male country singers that have dealt with their share of bad decisions and battles with demons, and they have rebounded, sometimes with their star shining brighter. She has been making great records since 1972, with 15 reaching #1. However, her While I’m Livin’ received critical acclaim, including winning the Grammy Awards for Best Country Album and Best Country Song for “Bring My Flowers Now” in 2020. The attention that Tanya Tucker garnered due to the success of While I’m Livin’ caused many to reexamine her career, and she was announced as a 2023 inductee to the Country Music Hall of Fame. On the heels of her recent success, Tanya Tucker has just released a new album, Sweet Western Sound.\n\nAs on While I’m Livin’, Tanya Tucker teams with producers Brandi Carlile and Shooter Jennings on Sweet Western Sound. Carlile and Jennings also provided their songwriting talents for the project. In addition, Tim and Phil Hanseroth, of Brandi Carlile’s band, along with Bernie Taupin, JT Nero, Billy Don Burns, Craig Dillingham, and Tanya Tucker wrote songs for the album. Some of my favorite songs from Sweet Western Sound include “The List”, “When The Rodeo Is Over (Where Does The Cowboy Go?)”, and Tanya’s tribute to Linda Ronstadt, “Letter To Linda”. Also, there is a haunting a capella rendition of “Tanya” by Tucker’s close friend, Billy Joe Shaver. Here’s a complete track list for the album:\n\nSweet Western Sound\n\nTanya (written by Billy Joe Shaver, Tanya Tucker)\n\nKindness (written by Tim Hanseroth, Phil Hanseroth)\n\nBreakfast In Birmingham featuring Brandi Carlile (written by Brandi Carlile, Bernie Taupin)\n\nWaltz Across a Moment (written by Shooter Jennings)\n\nReady As I’ll Never Be (written by Brandi Carlile, Tanya Tucker)\n\nThe List (written by Brandi Carlile, Tanya Tucker)\n\nLetter To Linda (written by Tanya Tucker, Shooter Jennings)\n\nCity of Gold (written by JT Nero)\n\nThat Wasn’t Me (written by Brandi Carlile, Tim Hanseroth, Phil Hanseroth)\n\nWhen The Rodeo Is Over (Where Do the Cowboys Go?) (written by Billy Don Burns, Craig Dillingham)\n\nI am so happy to see Tanya Tucker’s recent success. It is great to have another new album from Tanya Tucker. This album is fresh and vibrant, but Brandi Carlisle, Shooter Jennings, and all the other folks involved in recording this project have done a great job of making these songs sound like classic Tanya Tucker songs. From the background vocals, to the instrumentation, this album is outstanding. Of course, you could not have that sound without Tanya Tucker. I recommend giving Tanya Tucker’s Sweet Western Sound a listen.\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\nRodney Crowell is a legend. His career includes a three year stint as a member of Emmylou Harris’ Hot Band, having 5 number one singles as a solo artist, and, as a songwriter, having his songs covered by the likes of the Oak Ridge Boys, Waylon Jennings, and Keith Urban. In recent years, he has taken on the mantle of the preeminent songwriting sage from some of his biggest songwriting influences, Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt. Rodney Crowell’s latest project is The Chicago Sessions.\n\nRodney Crowell offers 10 songs on The Chicago Sessions. All were written or co-written, save for the Townes Van Zandt penned tune “No Place to Fall”. I recommend to pay attention to the lyrics of each song. It will be a great reminder of just how talented Crowell is as a songwriter. Some of my favorite tracks from this album include “Lucky”, a tune led by a soulful piano riff and laidback drumming. I also enjoy his interpretation of the aforementioned Townes Van Zandt tune, “No Place to Fall”. The musical approach of “Oh Miss Claudia” seems to be akin to that of Lightnin’ Hopkins, and that is definitely a good thing. I think my favorite song on this album is “Somebody Loves You”. It almost feels like a gospel song, and the lyrics are outstanding.\n\nHere’s the complete track list for The Chicago Sessions:\n\n1) Lucky\n\n2) Somebody Loves You\n\n3) Loving You is the Only Way to Fly\n\n4) You’re Supposed to be Feeling Good\n\n5) No Place to Fall\n\n6) Oh Miss Claudia\n\n7) Everything at Once (feat. Jeff Tweedy)\n\n8) Ever the Dark\n\n9) Making Lovers Out of Friends\n\n10) Ready to Move On\n\nRodney Crowell has done it again. He has given the world an album full of great songs. His songwriting is outstanding. A big tip of the hat must go to Jeff Tweedy. He served as the producer for The Chicago Sessions. As I have said many times in the past, my favorite producers are those that make the performers feel relaxed and gets out of the way of the artists. On this album, Tweedy seems to have hit a bullseye. I highly recommend giving Rodney Crowell’s The Chicago Sessions a listen today.\n\nMay 24, 2023\n\nI have been reviewing albums on WLHR since 2014. With that length of time in giving reviews, I have come across the same artists multiple times. It is always a pleasure to listen from album to album to listen performers grow artistically. Whitney Rose is one of those repeat artists. I reviewed her album Heartbreaker of the Year (2015) and the EP South Texas Suite (2017). Her music has an air of classic honky tonk sounds from yesteryear, while at the same time providing fresh, modern lyrics. After dealing with a serious illness that sidelined her for some time, Whitney Rose is back with a new project, Rosie.\n\nWhitney Rose offers 10 songs in a traditional country song. As I mentioned before, although the songs have a traditio"
