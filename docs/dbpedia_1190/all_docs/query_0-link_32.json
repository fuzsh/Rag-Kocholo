I am not the wild partying 21-year-old rock n roll front man that I used to be. I’m a husband. I’m a father. I’ve been sober for a decade now. It’s a record that proves you don’t have to always be going 100mph to find success in this business. It’s a record that says ‘it’s ok to take a minute to reflect on how far you’ve come, not worry about how much further you have to go’. For the longest time I thought that if I took my foot off the gas for even a second, I would lose all the ground that I had gained. Fatherhood changed that. I’ve found a beautiful balance between rock ‘n’ roll and family, and I wanted a record that showcased that freedom. In the studio, I’ve always strived to find the perfect balance between showcasing the songwriting and the fact that I have a great rock ‘n’ roll band.” [An indie store exclusive ‘blue jeans’ color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBlur – Live At Wembley Stadium 2xCD/2xLP/3xLP (WB/Parlophone)\n\nBlur celebrate the one-year anniversary of their Live At Wembley Stadium show with the release of the concert. Live At Wembley Stadium is a collection of songs captured across two unforgettable nights last summer – the biggest shows of the band’s 30+ year career to date – which saw Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree perform to over 150,000 fans at Wembley Stadium, Blur’s first time ever to play the iconic London venue. [A triple-LP vinyl version is available.]\n\nCrack Cloud – Red Mile CD/LP (Jagjaguwar)\n\nRed Mile’s sound breathes expansive energy into the circuitous, street bound sonics of Crack Cloud’s prior material. Fizzling synths intertwine with chiming pianos. Songs layer like Russian nesting dolls; one may find a Ramones chorus set within a desolate Western prog soundtrack only to watch it erupt into a joyous anthem. Real-ass guitars — alternately lilting, scuzzy and soaring — ring out across wide sun-bleached spaces. In 2024, the cumulative effect is (in rock instrumentation terms) naturalistic. Any whiff of embalmed nostalgia is absent. Even the close of the album – a winding, almost Jerry Garcia guitar noodle that leads us out of Red Mile – is delivered without sentimentality. Principal songwriter Zach Choy’s lyrics are cutting but merciful, with a sharp self-awareness that never slides into self-satisfaction. [A blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nEmpire Of The Sun – Ask That God CD/LP (Astralwerks)\n\nAlongside the release of the new single “Music On The Radio,” the astral wizards of electro-pop announce their long awaited fourth studio album titled, Ask That God.

Known for their elaborate stage performances and distinctive visual style, the band achieved international acclaim with their debut album, Walking On A Dream (2008), which featured hit singles like “Walking On A Dream” and “We Are the People”. The album’s success established them as significant figures in the synth-pop and electronic music scenes. [A clear vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nGhost – Rite Here Rite Now (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) 2xCD/2xLP (Loma Vista Recordings)\n\nGhost is a Swedish rock band known for its distinctive blend of theatricality, heavy metal, and arena rock. Formed in Linköping in 2006, the band first gained attention with their 2010 three-track demo, followed by the 7-inch vinyl “Elizabeth” and their debut album, Opus Eponymous. Rite Here Rite Now is Ghost’s debut feature film; a unique phantasmagorical blend of mesmerizing live performance and intriguing narrative, started haunting cinemas (nearly 2000 across 50 countries) on June 20. Rite Here Rite Now: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is a fitting 18-song complement to the film, captured at their now-legendary sold-out two-night stand at the Forum, and includes a new single “The Future Is A Foreign Land”. [An opaque silver color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nPat Metheny – MoonDial CD/2xLP (BMG)\n\nPat Metheny returns with new album MoonDial.

Powerwolf’s high quality releases are steadily praised by critics and fans alike, building upon the successful reach of their songs and impressive official music videos.

AG Club has been crowned Los Angeles’s “next big music collective,” by Nylon, and the release of Brodieworld represents the duo’s crowning achievement to this point in its career. The ten-track offering showcases the best of AG Club’s serene, buoyant brand of lifestyle rap.\n\nAmerican Aquarium – The Fear Of Standing Still CD/LP (Losing Side)\n\n“The Fear of Standing Still is a record about growing up and growing older. I am not the wild partying 21-year-old rock n roll front man that I used to be. I’m a husband. I’m a father. I’ve been sober for a decade now. It’s a record that proves you don’t have to always be going 100mph to find success in this business.

[A triple-LP vinyl version is available.]\n\nBulldozer – IX [Reissue/1987] CD/LP (Napalm)\n\nIX is the third album by an Italian thrash/black metal band Bulldozer, which was originally released in December 1987.\n\nCategory 7 – Category 7 CD/LP (Metal Blade)\n\nThey’re as heavy as a battleship, yet the songs are meticulously structured, skillfully balancing thrash beats, New Wave of British Heavy Metal rhythms, punk metal attitude, blistering and ferocious dual guitar work, and scar-inflicting vocals. [A limited-edition white-in-blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nCrack Cloud – Red Mile CD/LP (Jagjaguwar)\n\nRed Mile’s sound breathes expansive energy into the circuitous, street bound sonics of Crack Cloud’s prior material. Fizzling synths intertwine with chiming pianos. Songs layer like Russian nesting dolls; one may find a Ramones chorus set within a desolate Western prog soundtrack only to watch it erupt into a joyous anthem.

A beloved staple of the Pacific Northwest music scene since emerging with the beloved Portland-based band The Shaky Hands (Kill Rock Stars). It was clear then, as it is now, that he possessed an authentic-maybe ancient-voice and energy. Delffs has long been fascinated with Hinduism and took a second trip to India not long before work on the new album began. Delffs enlisted several old friends to help flesh out Transitional Phase: drums from Joe Plumer (The Shins, Modest Mouse, Cold War Kids) and Graeme Gibson (Michael Nau, Fruit Bats); keys from Luke Wyland (Au, Methods Body); strings and arrangements from composer Peter Broderick (Sharon Van Etten, M. Ward); and his old The Shaky Hands bandmate Mayhaw Hoons on bass. The result is transcendentally and sonically free, like those particularly melodic moments spent with Peter Gabriel or Kate Bush. [An indie store exclusive black w/ white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nBruce Dickinson – Resurrection Men CDEP (BMG)\n\nResurrection Men is the brand-new single from legendary Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson, taken from his acclaimed new solo album, The Mandrake Project, released in March 2024.

Featuring music and remixes from BICEP, Daniel Avery, Mind Against, Bonobo & Jacques Greene, Agents Of Time, and more.\n\nVuur & Zijde – Boezem CD/LP (Prophecy)\n\nBoezem (‘Bosom’), the debut full-length of Dutch quintet Vuur & Zijde (“Fire & Silk”) quite remarkably revolves around themes of conditional and unconditional love – and the difference between those, the liberation of intimacy, and motherhood. Obviously, this album politely abstains from going through the motions of tedious heavy metal cliches. [A limited-edition orange marbled color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nWhite Stones – Memoria Viva CD (Reigning Phoenix Music)\n\nMemoria Viva is the third strike of Opeth bassist Martín Mendéz’ other musical outfit White Stones. Much like its predecessors, this new chapter melts together disparate genres into a unique sonic experience. The instrumental frenzy migrates with delicate intricacies creating a mesmerizing atmosphere captivating the musical connoisseur. To up the antics, the energetic Spanish language was chosen to round up this multi-faceted endeavor. Elements of aggression, that can be seen rearing their head in instrumental frenzies, manage to co-exist along softer vibes, generating a distinct dynamic among the songs, with interludes allowing the listener to take a breath and appreciate what they’re hearing.\n\nWormwitch – Wormwitch CD/LP (Profound Lore)\n\nLike black wings from an obsidian sky, Wormwitch descended from the darkness in 2015, somewhere upon the rain-soaked woodlands of coastal British Columbia. Animated from the bones of several local punk and metal bands, the new entity set out to combine a melodic blackened death assault with the ferocity and attitude of crust punk and classic rock and roll, jettisoning the burdens of ceremony and pomp that dominate the genre today.\n\nYarn – Born, Blessed, Grateful & Alive CD/LP (333 Entertainment)\n\nBorn, Blessed, Grateful & Alive is yet another milestone in the evolution of Yarn’s music. Born in a time of a near implosion of the band. Blessed by a generous cast of unique and super talented collaborators; grateful for yet another chance to hone in on the philosophy of their music, and alive more than ever before with the heartbeat of our collective human experience. A collection of 12 songs to keep you company in this lonely and often, seemingly impossible to navigate life.\n\nThis Week’s Vinyl Exclusives:\n\nAmblare – Amblare LP (Melodic Virtue)\n\nThis eight-song behemoth is as expansive as it is explosive. Echoing the monstrous drums of Hum from the late Bryan St. Pere, Matt McGuyer (Mock Orange) and Alex Wallwork (Faerie Ring) fill out the sound with the near-dissonant blasts of snarling low-end along with powerful yet approachable vocals and colossal guitar.\n\nArmlock – Seashell Angel Lucky Charm LP (Run For Cover)\n\nCoke bottle cloud colorway. Australian duo Armlock make music for having your head in the clouds. On new album Seashell Angel Lucky Charm, Simon Lam and Hamish Mitchell bring you on a steady ascension through compressed and heavenly sonic realms. The band’s second proper release showcases the songwriters’ experimental electronic roots through an indie rock lens. Free from distortion or overindulgence, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm is a collection of consistent rhythms decorated with clean guitar tones and eccentricities. Through playful layers of vocal harmony and minimal arrangements, Armlock capture the inventive and uncomplicated essence of Pinback or Alex G.\n\nLouis Armstrong – The Definitive Album By Louis Armstrong [Reissue/1970] LP (LMLR)\n\nTranslucent blue colorway. An absolute treasure, with outstanding sound that brings the great instrumental and vocal prowess of the greatest jazz man ever front and center. Louis has long been recognized as the most influential trumpeter ever, but his vocal talents have often been overlooked.\n\nBaby Rose & BADBADNOTGOOD – Slow Burn LP (Secretly Canadian)\n\nClear smoke colorway. Less than a year after her album Through And Through, Baby Rose returns with Slow Burn, a collection of songs that explode her sonic palette from progressive R&B into a rawer, richer and more sprawling lens of American music. Here, Rose asserts herself as not only a once-in-ten-lifetimes vocalist, but as a formidable songwriter connecting the dots where Muscle Shoals meets psych, psych meets jazz, jazz meets Americana, and the right players bring it all together. Produced by BADBADNOTGOOD, Rose and the band found an instant but seemingly endless well of inspiration; what started as an introduction became a day, became a song, became a night, became Slow Burn.\n\nBad Brains – I Against I [Reissue/1986] LP (Org Music)\n\nI Against I is the third studio album from Bad Brains, originally released in 1986 on SST Records. It remains the best-selling album in the band’s catalog, showcasing Bad Brains’ unique fusion of punk rock, hardcore punk, reggae, and heavy metal influences.

This reissue marks the eighth release in the remaster campaign, re-launching the Bad Brains Records label imprint. [Multiple colorways are available.]\n\nBeastie Boys – Ill Communication [Reissue/1994] 3xLP/Cassette (Capitol)\n\nCelebrating the 30th anniversary of Beastie Boys’ multiplatinum album, III Communication, this limited-edition deluxe reissue is a rare version of the album that was originally released as a limited run in 2009.

The new material has such common pop elements as songs, vocals and drum machines, but the results could hardly be called conventional and are like little else happening on the (then) current scene.\n\nPatrick Belaga – The Sport Of Love LP (Pan)\n\nOn The Sport of Love, seasoned collaborators Asma Maroof, Patrick Belaga and Tapiwa Svosve consider the language, competition and contradiction of modern romance: it’s yearning, incomprehensible vastness and the inevitable darkness and fleeting fragility. For the trio, love is the emotion that propels all of us whether we acknowledge it or not, and its expression can be realized in many forms.\n\nThe Beths – Expert In A Dying Field [Reissue/2022] LP (Carpark)\n\nNew silver colorway. The third LP from the New Zealand quartet houses 12 jewels of tight, guitar-heavy songs that worm their way into your head, an incandescent collision of power-pop and skuzz. With Expert, The Beths wanted to make an album meant to be experienced live, for both the listeners and themselves. They wanted it to be fun – to hear, to play – despite the prickling anxiety throughout the lyrics, the fear of change and struggle to cope.\n\nJello Biafra & The Guantanamo School Of Medicine – Audacity Of Hype [Reissue/2009] LP (Alternative Tentacles)\n\nTwo new colorways. In the twenty or so years since his brainchild, The Dead Kennedys, officially disbanded, Jello Biafra has made a career of spoken word gigs interspersed with musical collaborations with some of the most compelling figures in underground music. Recording projects and touring with the likes of Melvins, NoMeansNo, DOA, Mojo Nixon, and Lard (with Ministry’s Al Jorgensen) among others have kept his “punk as political weapon” message sharp, but the lack of his own band made these collaborations usually short-lived and left Biafra with a ton of songs that never saw the light of day.\n\nTowa Bird – American Hero LP (Interscope)\n\nDebut album release from half-Filipino, half-English artist, singer-songwriter, guitarist Towa Bird who’s been co-signed by Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo, Tyler the Creator and more.

In the summer of 1998 Birdie recorded their debut album Some Dusty with the estimable Brian O’Shaughnessy (Denim, Moose, The Clientele). It’s a deep and beautiful album, with melodic & sophisticated (yet understated) arrangements providing the perfect setting for Debsey’s sweet and soulful soft-pop vocals. Add in gorgeous string arrangements from The High Llamas’ Sean O’Hagan and you have all the makings of a pop classic.\n\nBenson Boone – Fireworks & Rollerblades LP (WB)\n\nClear vinyl pressing. Benson Boone’s intimate, diaristic pop songs are constantly evolving as he quickly becomes a global hitmaker.\n\nJames Alexander Bright – Cool Cool LP (Athens Of The North)\n\nA dynamic set of urgent funkers, gentle soul ballads, head-nodders, fuzzy folkers and straight-up disco bangers span 10 songs that soundtrack fertile daydreams, esoteric dancefloors, languorous reflection, and wild excursions in nature and beyond. James’ voice, pitched somewhere between Eddie Chacon, Beck and Michael McDonald, takes a confident lead on Cool Cool.\n\nBernard Butler – Good Grief LP (355 Recordings)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. Good Grief is the first solo album in 25 years from songwriter and producer Bernard Butler. Between then and now, Butler had ventured into the world of pop songwriting and producing, including two seminal albums with folk musician Sam Lee, a Mercury nominated project with actor Jessie Buckley as well as working with Bert Jansch and Ben Watt From Everything But The Girl, The Libertines, Tricky and an eight-million selling, Grammy-winning record with Duffy. [A silver colorway is available.]\n\nBill Callahan – Resuscitate LP (Drag City)\n\nCallahan comes alive in Chicago, with Jim White, Matt Kinsey and special guests Nick Mazzarella, Pascal Kerong ‘A, Nathaniel Ballinger and Natural Information Society’s Joshua Abrams & Lisa Alvarado. Why, Bill? “Songs tend to mutate after they’ve been recorded. These songs were mutating faster than usual. Like whatever happened to Bruce Banner in the lab – I knew these songs were about to get superpowers… this change needed to be documented.”\n\nMaria Carey – #1’s [Reissue/1999] 2xLP (Sony Legacy)\n\n#1’s is a collection of Mariah Carey’s first 13 chart-topping singles. Originally released in 1998, this Greatest Hits album includes the classics “Always Be My Baby,” “Fantasy” and “One Sweet Day,” along with the four bonus tracks included on the original vinyl release. This 2024 edition is pressed on metallic silver & black swirl vinyl.\n\nChildren Of The Sun – Ofamfa [Reissue/1971] LP (Moved By Sound)\n\nOriginal released in 1971 by the Black Artist Group label Universal Justice Records this album has for years been impossible to find/listen, and this is its first reissue ever.

The BAG group being about all the arts, theater, and dance.\n\nClifton Chenier and His Red Hot Louisiana Band – New Orleans LP (GNP)\n\nThe “King of Zydeco”, Chenier, is a member of the Louisianna Music Hall of Fame, The Blues Hall of Fame, and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner. He is presented here with 13 original compositions. Recorded in the late ’70s with one of his classic bands, which featured his brother on washboard, saxophonist John Hart, and guitarist Paul Senegal, among others. The album is textbook Chenier – which means it rocks & rolls, wails and shouts. It may be a typical record for the king of zydeco, but that means it’s very, very enjoyable.\n\nCloud Nothings – Final Summer LP (Pure Noise)\n\nMarbled amethyst colorway. Over the past 15 years Cloud Nothings have become part of the fabric of modern indie rock with a steady run of reliably fantastic records, and this streak continues unabated with Final Summer–an album that’s so assured, so instantly satisfying, that it forces you to pause and realize you’re listening to one of the great American rock bands in their prime. Cloud Nothings recently shared Final Summer’s title track (which garnered attention from the likes of Pitchfork, NPR, Stereogum, Paste, BrooklynVegan, Uproxx, and more) and now they’ve released another high voltage new single, “Running Through The Campus”. It’s a three-minute blast of surging guitars and drums wrapped around the effortless hooks that vocalist/guitarist Dylan Baldi excels at.\n\nCoheed & Cambria – In Keeping Secrets Of Silent Earth: 3 [Reissue/2003] 2xLP (Sony Legacy)\n\nCoheed and Cambria’s second studio album, In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 celebrated it’s 20th Anniversary in 2023.

This new edition of the legendary London debut, unleashed at Camden’s Music Machine in October 1980, is a blistering set that captures the group at their freshest. [A white colorway is available.]\n\nColleen Dow – Inside Voices LP (Run For Cover)\n\nBaby blue colorway. The complete collection of Colleen Dow’s singles and EP Inside Voices as they were intended to be on one album.

The soundtrack to your summer.\n\nDrive-By Truckers – Southern Rock Opera (Deluxe Edition) LP (New West)\n\nSouthern Rock Opera is the third studio album by the American rock band Drive-By Truckers, released in 2001. Originally released as a double album covering an ambitious range of subject matter from the politics of race to 1970s stadium rock, Southern Rock Opera either imagines, or filters, every topic through the context of legendary Southern band Lynyrd Skynyrd. New West Records is proud to present a remixed and remastered deluxe edition LP featuring a re-sequenced record as well as a third disc with multiple bonus tracks including a song “Mystery Song” that was recorded one night in Birmingham. [An indie store exclusive clear vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nModesto Duran – Fabulous Rhythms Of Modesto [Reissue/1960] LP (Numero)\n\nA disciple of mambo innovator Perez Prado, the Cuban-born Modesto Duran was a pivotal figure in Latin dance music’s transitionary mid-century period. His gentle slaps can be heard across dozens of 1950s mega-sellers, from Esquivel to Belafonte, Eartha Kitt to Lena Horne. On his 1960 solo debut, Duran gathers a who’s who of conga-men, including Mongo Santamaría, Willie Bobo, and Juan Cheda, delivering a cinematic and percussive mélange of afro-Cuban, cha cha, and exotic jazz styles for the discerning listener. [A color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nGreg Foat – The Glass Frog LP (Blue Crystal)\n\nLarge group session featuring deep spiritual modal jazz and new age ambient synthesizer pads.\n\nFred Again – USB: Volume 1 2xLP (Atlantic)\n\nFred Again has released USB Volume 1 – the first volume of his “Infinite” album project, which is now available as a vinyl drop.

While the focus on songwriting already makes Coagulated Bliss the most grounded album in Full Of Hell’s catalog, it’s also the first Full Of Hell record that tries in earnest to reflect the world around it—not in some broad, monotony-of-evil way, but the everyday horrors of life in small town America. Three of the four members of the band were raised in Ocean City.\n\nFuture & Metro Boomin – We Don’t Trust You LP (Epic)\n\nFuture & Metro Boomin – We Still Don’t Trust You 2xLP (Epic)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. We Don’t Trust You arrives as a celebration of the historic partnership of two culture-shifting legends at the peak of their powers. Future and Metro Boomin’s latest collaborations are a continuation of a musical legacy that dates to “Karate Chop”, an electric 2013 single that birthed the most dynastic hip-hop duo of the 2010s. They’d fortify their connection with tracks like 2015’s “Jumpman” (with Drake) and 2017’s “Mask Off”, singles that have combined to be certified 14-times Platinum by the RIAA. We Don’t Trust You features the track “Like That” feat. Kendrick Lamar as well as other “A list” guest features. The expanded double-CD We Still Don’t Trust You includes guest appearances by the Weeknd, Chris Brown, Brownstone, Ty Dolla Sign, J. Cole, Lil Baby, and ASAP Rocky.\n\nGrateful Dead – Shakedown Street [Reissue/1978] LP (Grateful Dead/WEA)\n\nShakedown Street is the tenth studio album by The Grateful Dead, originally released in 1978.

It has nurtured the minds of multiple generations of children, introducing them to basic musical building blocks while fostering a spirit of togetherness and inclusivity.

In the album, she adapts long-established, historically significant Black gospel songs, spirituals, and blues songs collected from the churches, jukeboxes, and record stores of her youth. Songs including “I’m Gonna Tell God All My Troubles” and “How High’s the Water” reflect her active role in the ongoing struggle for Black liberation in mid-century America.

The collection of 16 tracks serves as a time machine, whisking listeners away on a journey through dimensions both familiar and uncharted since his last foray with 2019’s Dusted Jazz Vol. 3. Jenova 7 has meticulously crafted an album that resonates with the essence of ’90s trip hop nostalgia while propelling us into the cosmos of futuristic soundscapes.\n\nThe Killjoys – Starry [Reissue/1994] LP (Record Record Label)\n\nIn the words of singer and guitarist Mike Trebilcock, “We recorded Starry over the span of a few months.

As Knocked Loose chipped away at what would become their third album, they felt the pressure from all sides. Internally, there was the need to challenge themselves as songwriters while retaining the merciless intensity and unflinching honesty that have always been their calling cards. Externally, there was a whole new set of eyes on the hard-touring Louisville quintet, following a banner year in which they’d brought their underground-seasoned sound to some of the world’s biggest stages, finding themselves the unlikely viral darlings of both Coachella and Bonnaroo.\n\nDanny LHarle – Harlecore (Remixes) LP (Mad Decent)\n\nPicture disc. Danny LHarle invites electronic music’s superstars, high speed club legends and cutting-edge ascendant names alike to color the ‘Harlecore’ universe in their own wildly creative vision. The nine track Harlecore (Remixes) moves Danny L Harle’s utopian euphoric brainchild one step closer to the real world, with the likes of Flume, Nia Archives, VTSS, Hixxy and more twisting and manipulating the sounds of Club Harlecore to their own will.\n\nLinkin Park – Meteora [Reissue/2003] LP (WB)\n\nLinkin Park – Hunting Party [Reissue/2014] 2xLP (WB)\n\nNew colorways of Link Park’s second and sixth albums.\n\nBob Marley – Small Axe LP (LMLR)\n\nTranslucent green colorway.

Mastodonna is Tucson’s premier death metal Madonna cover band. Their new full-length record consists of eight Madonna songs that have been brutally torn apart and sewn back together wrong, giving the listener a haunting sense of nostalgia mixed with the urgent need to smash and destroy.\n\nJohn Mayall – Behind The Iron Curtain LP (GNP)\n\nRecorded in Szeged, Hungary in 1985, John Mayall reclaims the “Bluesbreakers” name to highlight a quintet featuring two lead guitarists, Coco Montoya and Walter Trout, along with a rhythm section of Bobby Haynes (bass), and Joe Yuele (drums). The album was recorded in concert in Hungary in June 1985, and takes a bluesy approach, with lots of space for the guitarists to shine, a format similar to that of The Bluesbreakers lineups of 1965-1968.\n\nJoe McPhee – Black Magic Man [Reissue/1975] LP (Superior Viaduct)\n\nJoe McPhee Featuring John Snyder And Makaya Ntshoko – The Willisau Concert [Reissue/1976] LP (Superior Viaduct)\n\nJoe McPhee – Tenor [Reissue/1977] LP (Superior Viaduct)\n\nJoe McPhee’s first international release, Black Magic Man, was issued on the newly formed Hat Hut imprint in 1975. It was a watershed moment for the 35-year-old musician. Based in Poughkeepsie, New York, he was too far away from Manhattan to have participated extensively in the Loft Jazz happenings of the decade. European exposure, however, would give McPhee an alternative circuit, something of an escape route from the trappings of American cultural myopia.\n\nThe Mountain Movers – Walking After Dark LP (Trouble In Mind)\n\nThe members of The Mountain Movers swap and cycle effortlessly through instruments without missing a beat, utilizing the downtime of lockdown to write and record every jam in their practice space. Those piles of tapes would eventually get edited and sequenced into Walking After Dark, a tour-de-force double-album that balances fried, stony brilliance with outré excursions of experimental serenity.\n\nGerry Mulligan Meets Ben Webster – Gerry Mulligan Meets Ben Webster [Reissue/1960] LP (Verve)\n\nGerry Mulligan Meets Ben Webster was just one of many “meets” albums that Gerry Mulligan appeared on during the period when this classic was recorded – Nov. 3 and Dec. 2, 1959, in Los Angeles. Mulligan and Pepper Adams were baritone saxophonists during the golden age of modern jazz, both masters of the unwieldy and deep-toned instrument. History was made here, as was a classic record for the ages. Mulligan was an innovator of the west coast cool jazz style who flourished playing with all manner of jazz musicians. The tunes he and Webster recorded are smooth, lush and emotional, driven along by a rhythm section that swings with just the right amount of bop. The result is an album that’s included among NPR’s “Basic Jazz Record Library.”\n\nNightshift – Homosapien LP (Trouble In Mind)\n\nIt’s been three years since Glasgow musical collective Nightshift’s last album (Zöe, 2021) and aside from an odds & sods tape compilation Made Of The Earth, the group has remained relatively quiet on the recorded front. Newly regrouped into a quartet, the band has readied their proper follow up to Zöe and their third album Homosapien, again for Chicago’s Trouble In Mind Records. [A technicolor fruit basket’ swirled color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nFrank Noviello – Surprise! [Reissue/1983] LP (Jazz Room)\n\nBig thanks to a certain Mr. Gilles Peterson who first alerted Paul Murphy, Head of Jazz Room Records to this Spiritual Jazz meets Bebop gem when he played the track ‘I’ve Known Rivers’ on his show on BBC6 MUSIC. Paul immediately took steps to contact Mr. Noviello with a view to release this previously unknown (to him anyway) hidden delight. It’s Frank Noviello’s debut album and a mixed bag of jazz standards and highly original covers and originals. Randy Westons’s “High Fly” has a really grooving arrangement, vocal bebop in the original “Tribal Dance” and the highlight in the Gary Bartz/Langston Hughes Spiritual Jazz outing “I’ve Known Rivers”. If you’re known to glide in and around to that Mark Murphy bag, then this is hip to the trip for you.\n\nOrquestra Broadway – New York City Salsa LP (LMLR)\n\nTranslucent blue colorway. Orquesta Broadway was an American mid-1960s/late 1980s New York-based salsa band. They issued almost 20 albums between 1964 and 1987. Orquesta Broadway and Típica 73 were two popular New York salsa bands that played in the charanga format.\n\nPainted Shield – Painted Shield 3 LP (Loosegroove)\n\n“I think Painted Shield 3 is our most equally collaborative record yet. You can really feel all five of us on this one with Josh Evans’ production keeping it all cohesive. Stone has some classic amazing Stone riffs like ‘The Pleasure’ and ‘Lover Divine’. Brit takes the lead on some fantastic grooving songs like ‘The Getter’ and ‘She Runs’. Matt Chamberlain really brought his amazing modular synth writing chops to the table on songs like ‘Testify’ and ‘Run Em All Down’. Jack-of-all-trades Jeff is holding down the amazing bass on songs like ‘End In Mind’ and singing amazing harmonies on songs like ‘The Pleasure’. And I’m bringing my folkier songwriting passion to songs like ‘Window’ and ‘Clear Blue Sky’. The result is Painted Shield 3. A musical universe unto itself. Can’t wait for you to hear it!” – Mason Jennings.\n\nParis Texas – Mid Air 2xLP (Paris Texas LLC)\n\nA picture of an object in midair doesn’t necessarily tell you whether it’s on the way up or down. There is no logic, no history, no narrative arc—just the present tense, the suspension of a single moment. So perhaps it was inevitable that Paris Texas, the wildly inventive duo from Los Angeles who blend various strains of rap and rock music into a fugue of pure energy and irresistible urgency, would name their full-length debut Mid Air. [An indie store exclusive lapis lazuli color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nWilliam Parker Organ Quartet – Uncle Joe’s Spirit House LP (Centering)\n\nA gorgeous soul-jazz organ quartet album that hearkens back to early-mid- ‘60s sessions of similar form; fully revitalized by William Parker’s indelible compositions and the generous musical gifts of Darryl Foster, Cooper-Moore and Gerald Cleaver.\n\nPARTYNEXTDOOR – PARTYNEXTDOOR Two [Reissue/2014] LP (Santa Ana/Ovo)\n\nWhite colorway.

Fred And Toody Cole’s post Dead Moon band with Legendary rocker Kelly Haliburton on drums. Most musicians get softer with age, but Fred and Toody brought a harder edge to Pierced Arrow’s than their earlier bands. A legendary record back in print for the first time since it initially came out in 2008. A killer!\n\nEdith Piaf – Piaf! [Reissue/1958] LP (Destination Moon)\n\nOne of the most celebrated vocalists of the 20th Century and the best-known French singer of all time, the iconic cabaret and chanson performer Edith Piaf had an incredible life and an equally amazing career. Abandoned by her mother at birth and raised partly in a brothel by her granny, Piaf began performing in her father’s acrobatic street troupe as a teen and made her name in occupied Paris. For 1958’s Piaf! her torch-song deliveries are aided by the subtle strings of the Orchestra of Robert Chauvigny; if you’re an Edith Piaf fan there is plenty to savor here, especially “En Pourtant,” “Les Orgues De Barbarie,” and “Le Gitan Et La Fille.”\n\nPiñata Protest – Plethora “Reloaded” [Reissue/2012] LP (Saustex Media)\n\nThis accordion-fronted conjunto punk band began over a half-decade of hard traveling in 2011 and have won thousands of hardcore fans in the time since, headlining and doing extended tours with acts including The Reverend Horton Heat, Brujeria, Agent Orange, Guttermouth and many more at hundreds of shows across the USA, Mexico and Canada.\n\nRainer Maria – Look Now Again (25th Anniversary Edition) LP (Polyvinyl)\n\nThe guitar is tuned open and sings through a cranked old Fender amp, the melodic bass rolls, drums pound and the lyrical trade-off between Kaia and Caithlin is capable of puncturing a grapefruit size hole through the heart. Without a doubt, 1999’s Look Now Look Again is the definitive Rainer Maria album to own. With the aid of Smart Studios’ Mark Haines (Poster Children, Son Volt) and Elliot Dicks (Joan of Arc), Rainer Maria’s second album has become a Polyvinyl classic and set the standard against which the band will always be judged.

Although the band is partly known for being the first band that Philip Anselmo (Pantera, Down, Necrophagia) was part of, Razor White represents much more than that, especially for aficionados of heavy metal made in the United States. An example of this is the tremendous 1988 cassette (“The Black Demo”), which contains valuable proof of what late ‘80s US Metal could offer.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers – Californication [Reissue/1999] 2xLP (WB)\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers release their seventh studio album, Californication.

One of the band’s most influential records, it includes “Tormentor,” “Spasmolytic,” and more. In addition to praise from Vice and many more, Metal Hammer fittingly named it one of the “10 Best Industrial Albums,” and Spin summed it up best as a “return to the bloodbath.” A menacing and massive pastiche of H.P. Lovecraft-style cosmic horror, addiction, mental disarray, and the disintegration of nature, Too Dark Park remains a cataclysmic and chaotic classic through and through.\n\nSkyzoo & Torae – Barrel Brothers [Reissue/2014] 2xLP (Internal Affairs)\n\nThe collaboration album from Brooklyn MCs Skyzoo and Torae is available once again after its original debut in 2014.\n\nThe Softies – Winter Pageant [Reissue/1997] LP (K.)\n\nOn their second album, Winter Pageant, The Softies move forward with focused delight. It’s the combination of Jen Sbragia (All Girl Summer Fun Band) and Rose Melberg (Tiger Trap, Gaze, Go Sailor) that molds The Softies’ panoply: feathers and thorns, fawn and fearless, fable and friction. Originally released in 1997, Winter Pageant is the drama of utter melancholia documenting broken promises, missed phone calls, conversations stalled, love lost. Colossal tasks recorded two guitars deep, forming a new Iliad, chapters on brave deeds and the power of love on the move. You can live for love, or you could live for the splendid cascade of guitar on guitar, voice over voice: The Softies.\n\nJulia Sophie – Forgive Too Slow LP (Ba Da Bing)\n\nForgive Too Slow, avant-garde artist Julia-Sophie’s deeply personal debut album is testament to her ability to transform adversity into raw beauty, combining her traditional songwriting roots with her own take on experimental electronica.

[Clear vinyl pressings of each title are available.]\n\nThrowing Snow – Isthmus LP (Houndstooth)\n\nIsthmus’ is Ross Tones’s fifth album for Houndstooth in 10 years. It only seems fitting for it to return to the eclecticism of 2014’s Mosaic. An isthmus is a narrow strip of land that connects two larger bodies. The two islands contrast in time, topography, chaos and character. One sears. The other, buried by blizzards. A land bridge fights the tide, offering harbor. Connecting the estranged. Giving battle to the noise. It is uncertain who won.\n\nTigirlily Gold – Blonde LP (Monument)\n\nThe debut album from sister duo Tigirlily Gold, including the viral single “Shoot Tequila” and “I Tried A Ring On.”\n\nSam Tompkins – Hi, My Name Is Insecure LP (Republic)\n\nIntroducing Hi, My Name Is Insecure – a transformative musical journey crafted by the immensely talented Sam Tompkins.

Midnight Run packs 11 tracks that will instantly satisfy fans of the elite lyricism and hard-hitting production the duo is known for.\n\nWand – Vertigo LP (Drag City)\n\nSliding between the bodies in the street, cutting across the contrails that bisect our sky, Wand find melody and the anxiety beats as they hum the soundtrack for a new gravitational center. Seeking connections against the plan of niche interest and anonymity, Vertigo is the sound of slippage, rocks of contradiction (in soft focus); feet lost, regained, lost again, a multi-chromatic swaying, more automatic, associative, directed, in time.\n\nMuddy Waters – Live In Los Angeles 1954 LP (GNP)\n\nA brand new, never-before-heard recording that is essential listening for any student of the blues. Live In Los Angeles 1954 captures the father of the electric blues, Muddy Waters, at the peak of his powers, in a riveting performance that easily explains an immense reputation that continues to this day.\n\nWild Rivers – Never Better LP (Nettwerk)\n\nWith exquisite harmonies, gorgeous melodies and emotionally charged, tightly crafted lyrics, Wild Rivers deliver their unique blend of folk-pop songs that are at once inviting and infectious.\n\nAnthony Wilson Trio – Our Gang 2xLP (Groove Note)\n\nWilson’s Our Gang is the culmination of his more recent ideas, in both originals and standards, and this album includes some stunning performances of standards like “Chitlins Con Carne” (by Kenny Burrell), “I Want You – She’s So Heavy” (from Abbey Road), and “Prelude To A Kiss” (Strayhorn). The album also contains further evidence of Anthony Wilson’s skill and talent as a composer as demonstrated by original compositions like Our Gang and Britta’s Blues.

Onra spent several years living in Thailand, immersing himself in the vibrant culture and scouring local record shops for rare gems. The result is a collection of Thai songs from various genres, all sourced on 7 inches. These short instrumentals serve as time capsules, transporting listeners to a bygone era filled with nostalgia and longing. Produced entirely on the MPC1000 in 2017 and revisited in 2020, Nosthaigia is a testament to the power of serendipity and artistic evolution. What began as a casual exploration of unfamiliar musical territory blossomed into a deeply personal and meaningful project for Onra. Amidst a series of unfortunate life events, he found solace and inspiration in the beats he had crafted years prior. Each track on Nosthaigia reflects his journey, a sonic expression of longing and introspection."
