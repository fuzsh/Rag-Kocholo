        "text": "Gordi has released her ‘Extraordinary Life’ EP, featuring four alternate versions of the titular single.\n\nThe EP includes remixes of the track by Alex Somers and Camp Cope‘s Georgia Maq. On top of these renditions, Gordi has thrown in a 2018 demo of the single as well as a live recording from her recent Sydney Opera House performance.\n\nStream the EP below:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGordi and Georgia Maq spoke to NME about their collaboration earlier this month.\n\n“I got hit up to do a little remix, I found some chords and made this little thing,” Maq explained.\n\nRecommended\n\n“It’s actually the first song I fully produced on my own. I think I did a really good job, I believed in myself.”\n\nTo celebrate the EP’s release, Gordi has announced a handful of new dates for her forthcoming tour. She had previously only announced shows in Sydney, but will now also perform in Brisbane, Canberra, Newcastle, Wollongong, Byron Bay and Hobart.\n\nIn response to border closures, Gordi has scheduled some of the shows for February 2021.\n\nOn October 14, Gordi added an additional Wollongong show to her upcoming tour.

In July, she appeared on triple j’s ‘Like A Version’, performing a cover of ‘Wrecking Ball’ by Miley Cyrus.\n\nGordi, a qualified doctor, has also been working on the COVID-19 frontline in 2020.\n\n“Victorian hospitals are having huge numbers of staff being furloughed – meaning because they’ve had exposure to COVID-19, they have to go and isolate for two weeks,” she explained in an Instagram post last month.\n\n“This means huge staff shortages so I’ve been filling the gaps where I can.”\n\nGordi 2020 Tour Dates\n\nOctober 2020:\n\nWednesday 21 – Sydney, Factory Theatre*\n\nThursday 22 – Sydney, Factory Theatre*\n\nFriday 23 – Newcastle, Newcastle City Hall\n\nSaturday 24 – Wollongong, La La La’s*\n\nFriday 30 – Canberra, The Playhouse\n\nFebruary 2021:\n\nFriday 5 – Brisbane, The Triffid*\n\nSaturday 6 – Byron Bay, Byron Theatre\n\nSaturday 20 – Hobart, Altar\n\n*indicates that Gordi will perform an early and late show"
