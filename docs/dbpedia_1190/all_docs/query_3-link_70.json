        "text": "In between the pop-up parties Caribou is hosting around the globe this summer, the Canadian musician has released the video for his new single “Volume,” which is based on the 1987 hit “Pump Up The Volume” by M|A|R|R|S.\n\nIn a statement, the artist otherwise known as Dan Snaith reflected on the significance of the tune: “’Pump up the Volume’ was the first time in my life I heard electronic music – sitting in front of the family stereo system listening to the top 40 countdown on the radio when i was a kid. it completely blew my mind – it sounded like something from another world. it’s stuck with me ever since – I always wanted to rework it in some way. I didn’t consciously think about it when I started working on my track but I think there’s something really special about having gone right back to the very beginning in making this.”\n\nAn announcement from Caribou’s PR team notes that other recent releases include a club version of the track “Broke My Heart (Champion Remix), which is featured in the Charli XCX PARTYGIRL Ibiza Boiler Room set and “Broke My Heart (Harry Hayes Remix)” which “began as a fan-edit sent via Instagram by the rising star.”\n\nThe pop-up parties – which are expected to continue through the summer – have included a stop “in North Wales with Kelly Lee Owens, Koreless, and David Wrench and one in Berlin with Sofia Kourtesis and Ahadadream as well as Dublin, Manchester, Glasgow and Liverpool.”\n\nA world tour is set to kick off in October with a show at Tokyo’s O-East on Oct. 14, followed by an Oct. 17 set at the Amsterdam Dance Event. The North American portion of the trek launches Nov. 8 at Vancouver’s PNE Forum. Stops include Seattle, Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Toronto and more. Tickets are available now via https://www.caribou.fm/.\n\nCaribou is booked in North America by TBA Agency’s Amy Davidman, who was named to Pollstar‘s 2024 Women of Live list.\n\nCheck out the routing below, along with the video for “Volume.”\n\nCaribou 2024 Live Dates\n\nOctober 14, Tokyo, JP @ O-East\n\nOctober 17, Amsterdam, NL @ Amsterdam Dance Event\n\nNovember 8, Vancouver, BC @ PNE Forum *\n\nNovember 9, Portland, OR @ Roseland *\n\nNovember 10, Seattle, WA @ Showbox Sodo *\n\nNovember 12, Oakland, CA @ Fox *\n\nNovember 13, Los Angeles, CA @ Shrine Expo Hall *\n\nNovember 15, Denver, CO @ Mission Ballroom * ^\n\nNovember 17, 2024 Chicago, IL @ Salt Shed *\n\nNovember 18, Atlanta, GA @ Eastern *\n\nNovember 19, Washington D.C. @ Anthem *\n\nNovember 20, 2024 Philadelphia, PA @ Franklin Music Hall *\n\nNovember 21, 2024 Queens, NY @ Great Hall at Avant Gardner *\n\nNovember 23, Toronto, ON @ Massey Hall *\n\nNovember 25, Montreal, QC @ L’Olympia *\n\n* = support from Yunè Pinku\n\n^ = with Joy Orbison\n\n2025 Live Dates\n\nFebruary 3, Paris @ Zenith Paris, FR @ La Villette “\n\nFebruary 4, Esch/Alzette, LX @ Rockhal “\n\nFebruary 6, London, UK @ Roundhouse SOLD OUT\n\nFeb 7, London, UK @ Roundhouse SOLD OUT\n\nFeb 8, London, UK @ Roundhouse SOLD OUT\n\nFebruary 9, Leeds, UK @ 02 Academy “\n\nFebruary 10, Bristol, UK @ Bristol Beacon “\n\nFebruary 11, Brussels, BE @ Ancienne Belgique “\n\nFebruary 12, Brussels, BE @ Ancienne Belgique “\n\nFebruary 14, Berlin, DE @ UFO (Velodrom) “"
