        "text": "2024\n\nSaturday 22nd June 2024 - KOSSOFF...The Band Plays On | Doors 7.45pm\n\nSupport | A Smile Two Bangs and a Legend\n\nAfter unprecedented public demand we finally get this band back down south! This is a gig no one should miss!\n\nThe stunning blues-rock music of Paul Kossoff, the lead guitar prodigy whose soaring playing lit up 1970s rockers Free, is coming to Long Street Blues Club. Kossoff, of course, died tragically young after a drugs battle aged just 25, but his music lives on with The Band Plays On, a band featuring Terry Slesser, the lead vocalist of Kossâs post-Free band, Back Street Crawler.\n\nForty years on since Paul Kossoff, one of Britainâs finest guitarists, tragically passed away at the tender age of 25 in 1976. Singer Terry Slesser, the voice of Kossoff's critically acclaimed post-Free band Back Street Crawler, and a close friend of Koss, keeps the memory of one of the greatest British Blues guitarist and his music alive.\n\nSless has chosen the guitarist John Buckton, (of whom Simon Kirke said \"If Free were to reform, John would be my first choice as guitarist\"), to play a series of special dates reviving for the first time since the 70s the catalogue of Back Street Crawler songs as well as favourite Free numbers.\n\nAlso included in the lineup is drummer Clive Edwards (UFO, Wild Horses, Pat Travers) and highly respected keyboard player Mark Taylor (Elton John, Simple Minds, The Alarm). The Band Plays On will feature the very best of Freeâs back catalogue and also Back Street Crawlerâs two-album sojourn.\n\nThe bandâs name is fittingly also the name of BSCâs first album with Kossoff from 1975. Highlights include Freeâs world-wide hit and rock anthem âAll Right Nowâ, âFire and Waterâ, crowd pleaser âThe Hunterâ and âMolten Goldâ, one of the first tracks Slesser and Kossoff played together with Back Street Crawler.\n\nSaturday 18th May 2024 - THE DIRT ROAD BAND | Doors 7.45pm\n\nSupport | Ruby Darbyshire\n\nThe Dirt Road Band is the brainchild of guitar legend Steve Walwyn, mainly known as the longest serving guitar player in Dr Feelgood (32 years). During this time, he has amassed a massive reputation as a guitar hero in the UK, Europe, and beyond. He says, âIâd always liked the idea of the power trio-stripping everything back to basics. Guitar, bass, and drumsâ.\n\nTo help him in this he has recruited the services of Ted Duggan- professional since the 60s, including stints with Badfinger and world techno giants Banco de Gaia. âl'd worked with Ted beforeâ, Steve says, âI knew he would fit the gig perfectlyâ. He certainly does.\n\nBass player Horace Panter is better known as a founding member of The Specials. Horace has âgrooveâ imprinted on his DNA. Holding it down comes as second nature.\n\nThis then is Steve's dream team rhythm section that swings as hard as it rocks. âWe have started to develop that musical telepathy that makes a band more than just the sum of its parts. It is a really thrilling time and keeps music aliveâ.\n\nCERES Promotions present at the Corn Exchange, Devizes\n\nSaturday 4th May 2024 - BEAUX GRIS GRIS and the APOCALYPSE | Doors 7.45pm\n\nSpecial homecoming gig! This gig will have many special guests and will be filmed!\n\nThis is a triumphant homecoming gig for Hoax member Robin Davey. Based in California this band has seen a meteoric rise. With two albums under their belt and now heavily featured by Planet Rock this will be one special gig to savour.\n\nBeaux Gris Gris & The Apocalypse is the musical creation of Greta Valenti and Robin Davey. The pair met when their respective bands crossed paths on YouTube, having already established themselves as performers and musicians.

Yet his funky blues deserves huge recognition on its own merits. The time has come for Billy to take his place in the pantheon of Jersey greats.\n\nYet his funky blues deserves huge recognition on its own merits. The time has come for Billy to take his place in the pantheon of Jersey greats.\n\n\"True guitar hero fronting an old-school rockânâsoul band, you might describe Billy Walton as âJimi Ray Claptonâ or âExile On E Streetâ â a man who will take you on a journey through the American rock and blues landscape.\n\nThere was a time when the Jersey Shore represented the best in American entertainment. Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, the Rat Pack, Dick Clark, Chubby Checker, they all made stops on the Jersey Shore. Tony Martâs was the club Levon Helm was playing when Dylan called. Of course we all know what happened in Asbury Park. The town, ravaged by riots in the late 60âs, became a melting pot of musical experimentation. Late night jams that ended when the sun came up were the norm. Bruce Springsteen & Southside Johnny were the two acts that made their way to an international stage from these humble beginnings.\n\nFor decades musicians have come and gone, always hoping to make a living and pursue a dream. Billy Walton is no different. Billyâs proving ground was Long Beach Island. There he was chaperoned from gig to gig by his Mom, two young to drive around and enter the clubs on his own. He always was up for a jam and looking to learn some tricks. For years Billy spent his time sharpening his skills, developing his stage act until he decided to step up to center stage with the Billy Walton Band.\n\nThe band has focused itsâ effort in Europe. 13 tours since 2007 have established the group in the fertile British Blues Rock scene. In 2010 Billy got the call to join in with one of the masters of the Asbury Park sound, Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes. For years Billy toured with the Jukes. Most people donât know that the creative force behind Southside was none other than Little Steven. A highpoint in Billyâs tenure with the Jukes was when they recorded a live version of Southsideâs most acclaimed release, Hearts of Stone, with Little Steven.\n\nRest assured this gig will be a total sell out in record time so you have to get tickets for this show as early as possible.\n\nCheck out the latest official video on YouTube\n\nThe new season opens with one of the finest blues musicians this country has produced over the last thirty years.\n\nA songwriter genuinely literate, sometimes almost literary, Ian is an original craftsman.\n\nExpressed through a distinctive bitter-sweet vocal delivery, Ian's songs hold nothing back. His ability and willingness to share with his audience, naked honesty and genuine emotion, is what sets him apart.\n\nIan's career took off in the summer of 2003, when he signed to Ruf Records following a personal introduction to US record producer, David Z (Prince - Purple Rain).\n\nHis debut album 'INSIDE' (Ruf1094) was released in October of that year. Further albums, live DVDs and extensive tours of Europe and the USA followed, with Parker always seeking new musical avenues to explore, never content to merely rehash old ideas, no matter how successful they may have been. To this end, Ian is something of journeyman, guided by his art and his self-confessed emotional need to express his soul through music.\n\nHis journey has taken unexpected turns, testing his loyal following from time to time, but the integrity of his writing, the quality of his distinctive voice and the soulful nature of his signature guitar playing have always been the bedrock of his work. Following the release of Politik Blues (Eye-Pea002) in April 2015, Ian refocused his attention on the Stratocaster-driven blues music he began building his reputation on, more than twenty years ago.\n\nA return to the iconic Rockfield Studios (Queen â A Night at the Opera) in the summer of 2018 resulted in the blues album many long-standing fans and critics alike are lauding as his best work to date. âSpoonful of Gold â Blues for Willieâ celebrates the music of Willie Dixon, delivered in Ianâs inimitable style.\n\nFreed from the shackles of being the new kid on the block vying for attention in an over-saturated market, Parker approaches his music, these days, with the calm, self-assurance that accompanies one who has, to some extent, been there and done it.\n\nNothing to prove and still so much to say, Ian Parker remains an act not to be missed.\n\nAdvance Tickets are Â£16.00 from usual outlets or book online (online booking fee applies) Tickets Â£18 on the door\n\nSaturday 10th June 2023 - ERIC BELL BAND | Doors 7.45pm\n\nSupport | A Smile Two Bangs and a Legend\n\nHaving had to postpone the original February date due to an illness to the bassist we are delighted to welcome Thin Lizzy founding member and original guitarist Eric Bell and his Band to the club.\n\nThe original and, one of the very best, guitarists to play with Thin Lizzy, he will be forever be associated with Whisky in the Jar and The Rocker which were staples of the bands live sets.\n\nEric played with Van Morrison in the back end of Them before helping form Thin Lizzy.

The time has come for Billy to take his place in the pantheon of Jersey greats.\n\n\"True guitar hero fronting an old-school rockânâsoul band, you might describe Billy Walton as âJimi Ray Claptonâ or âExile On E Streetâ â a man who will take you on a journey through the American rock and blues landscape.\n\nThere was a time when the Jersey Shore represented the best in American entertainment. Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, the Rat Pack, Dick Clark, Chubby Checker, they all made stops on the Jersey Shore. Tony Martâs was the club Levon Helm was playing when Dylan called. Of course we all know what happened in Asbury Park. The town, ravaged by riots in the late 60âs, became a melting pot of musical experimentation. Late night jams that ended when the sun came up were the norm. Bruce Springsteen & Southside Johnny were the two acts that made their way to an international stage from these humble beginnings.\n\nFor decades musicians have come and gone, always hoping to make a living and pursue a dream. Billy Walton is no different. Billyâs proving ground was Long Beach Island. There he was chaperoned from gig to gig by his Mom, two young to drive around and enter the clubs on his own. He always was up for a jam and looking to learn some tricks. For years Billy spent his time sharpening his skills, developing his stage act until he decided to step up to center stage with the Billy Walton Band.\n\nThe band has focused itsâ effort in Europe. 13 tours since 2007 have established the group in the fertile British Blues Rock scene. In 2010 Billy got the call to join in with one of the masters of the Asbury Park sound, Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes. For years Billy toured with the Jukes. Most people donât know that the creative force behind Southside was none other than Little Steven. A highpoint in Billyâs tenure with the Jukes was when they recorded a live version of Southsideâs most acclaimed release, Hearts of Stone, with Little Steven.\n\nRest assured this gig will be a total sell out in record time so you have to get tickets for this show as early as possible.\n\nCheck out the latest official video on YouTube\n\nSaturday 25th March 2023 - THOMAS ATLAS | Doors 7.45pm\n\nThomas Atlas (aks Tom C Walker) comes to the club with a two piece horn section...\n\nA great young band\n\nThomas Atlas is a British guitarist, singer and songwriter.

Having gained a large internet following, and fans all over the UK through playing countless live shows, this band has what it takes to go all the way.\n\nWatching them live only enforces this belief. Their sound brings comparisons with the brio of the E Street Band and the dark passion of classic Doors, but with plenty of British authenticity and perhaps even a hint of Dexy's in their high voltage attack.\"\"Meet the five-piece band who are not only turning heads with the confident glide in their stride; they're literally bulletproofâ - Paul Sexton (Sunday Times)\n\nProudly based in the border city of Carlisle, Hardwicke Circus have played over 150 gigs this year - supporting Bob Dylan & Neil Young in Hyde Park, Madness, Alabama 3, Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes, Bob Geldofâs Boomtown Rats and The Blockheads. They have gigged at the legendary Isle of Wight Festival, Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds, headlined the Yam Riot Stage at Kendal Calling and gained airplay on BBC Introducing, Radio 1, Radio 2 & 6 Music.\n\nHC have recently completed a four month residency at the famous Hope & Anchor in London and have just released their third EP. In March 2020 they play the legendary South by Southwest Festival in Austin Texas, USA.\n\nThe first local band to sell out their hometown venue âThe Brickyardâ four months in advance, Hardwicke Circus have added a second night - playing two sell out hometown gigs back-to-back. With every new show, more and more fans get on board, because this is a group where there's so much to watch as well as to listen to. The focal point of it all is lead singer and chief songwriter Jonny Foster, who draws the eye as he exudes all of the 'Brown Sugar'- era swagger of Jagger. But on stage and on record, there's also an echo of the energy of such modern-day heroes as Arcade Fire. âIt's a very visual thing, and I think people like to see the seven of us on stage,â avows Foster. âYou don't really find that in modern bands. I've always liked the big band and I always aspired to play in one, with cinematic songs. To have six people channel that same vision, I think we're really lucky.â\n\nâImagine The Rolling Stones creating an album with The Doors jamming with Primal Scream...This is Hardwicke Circus. Transforming their influences into their own originality, this night was one to remember for some time to come.â \"One the best gigs I've ever seen; raw visceral rock music, before it all got too damn perfect and corporate\" \"Every so often a band comes along that has something special. This is a young band with talent to burn and huge potential\" Their ever expanding army shows no sign of stopping.\n\nFollowing a barnstorming support slot earlier we have been inundated to get Alex Voysey back so opening tonight's show is his highly rated trio.\n\nRelatively new to the scene and at 26 now a rising star in the blues world, the Alex Voysey Blues Trio shows are packed with incredible guitar performances, phenomenal musicianship, breath-taking grooves and riffs, and a deep passion for blues.\n\nThe band bring together new and virtuosic twists on great artists from Robert Johnson and BB King through Stevie Ray Vaughan, to the more lyrical blues of Eric Clapton and John Mayer, right up to contemporary artists Joe Bonamassa, Joanne Shaw Taylor and many more in between, plus Alex's original blues material from his debut album âHead In A Blurâ released last year and forthcoming release âBlues In Isolationâ coming soon.\n\n\"A brilliant night â Alex Voyseyâs guitar playing is out of this world.\n\nHeavily inspired by the prowess of Joe Bonamassa, Alex is fast becoming a leading exponent of his virtuosic and complex blues writing. Together with Ben Hands on bass and Paul Arthurs on kit, the trio bring diverse musical backgrounds to the table but share a huge breadth of experience between them and revel in their shared love of blues.\n\nWhatever your passion, look no further for consummate musicianship and a show not to be missed.\n\nAlex Voysey is not only a superb musician but plays with a feeling and a passion that is true to the meaning of the blues.\n\nCERES with LONGCROFT Promotions presents at the Corn Exchange, Devizes\n\nFriday 11th November 2022 - BEAUX GRIS GRIS and the APOCALYPSE | Doors 7.45pm\n\nSupport CALIBRE\n\nThis is a triumphant homecoming gig for Hoax member Robin Davey.

The pair met when their respective bands crossed paths on YouTube, having already established themselves as performers and musicians.

The albums wide-reaching appeal earned it a #13 placement in the âTop 50 Albums of the yearâ by Classic Rock Magazine, describing it as âA sensual, vibrant cocktailâ\n\nGuitarist Robin Davey was the youngest ever inductee into the British Blues Hall of Fame. He spent time as an artist on Atlantic and Interscope Records, and has recorded with a wide spectrum of artists from Mick Jagger to Katy Perry. Multi-award-winning vocalist and songwriter Greta Valenti is Louisiana-born-and-bred creative with generations of her family dating back before the Louisiana purchase. Her rock outfit Well Hung Heart (OCMAâs Best Live Band) toured the USA opening for the likes of Fitz & The Tantrums, Twenty One Pilots, Foreigner, and Offspring.\n\nWhile Beaux Gris Gris is the musical arm of their creativity, the pair have also established their own multi-award winning creative agency, Grow Vision, as a sought-after multimedia content and development team.

At their core Calibre is a rock band â with bags of swagger. Big riffs and soaring choruses blend with gutsy vocals and a powerful rhythm section to create their earthy sound.

It's an exciting musical partnership born of the same musical influences, but one that offers them a broader canvas than before.\n\nInnes always has a special place in our heart having opened the club way back in May 2008 and Marcus also has visited Devizes on a number of occasions.\n\nSaturday 19th March 2022 - SOFT MACHINE | Doors 7.45pm\n\nSoft Machine : One of the greatest UK avant/jazz-rock bands of all time.\n\nTheir work, from their earliest performances as a psychedelic band who were contemporaries of, and shared stages with, Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, all the way to being one of Europe's best known 'fusion' groups, has influenced several generations of bands, and continues to be name-checked by today's hip experimentalists.\n\nWhilst the line-up of Soft Machine may have changed many times since the heady days of the late 1960’s, the band’s spirit of musical adventure, and the ease with which it freely avoids being pigeon holed and can move from powerful progressive jazz fusion to atmospheric psychedelia to free improvised jazz-rock to ambient loop music continues to make it both unique and totally contemporary.\n\nSaturday 26th February 2022 | MARK FLANAGAN BAND | Doors 7.45pm\n\nWe are over the moon that one of the great British guitarist is coming to the club with his own band as part of a rare club date.\n\nFor nearly 30 years Mark Flanagan has been the guitarist in the Jools Holland Orchestra.

Performing his rootsy blues originals this will be a night to remember.\n\nâA truly great guitaristâ â Eric Clapton\n\nâHe understands everything.. He can swing it and then rock itâ - Jools Holland.\n\nCheck out Mark live - 'Where Lies My Home' on YouTube\n\nDo not miss this opportunity to witness one the great stars of the U.K. Music scene in a very intimate setting.\n\nSaturday 19th Feb 2022 | MIKE ZITO BAND | Doors 7.45pm\n\nWe welcome back one of the most popular artists to appear at the club. Mike Zito is founding member of the Royal Southern Brotherhood along with Devon Allman.\n\nHe may be one of the most lauded artists in the contemporary blues arena today, and rightfully so, but for Mike Zito, the thing that counts the most is maintaining his honesty, authenticity and integrity. Those are the qualities that have steered Zitoâs career since the beginning and continue to define every effort heâs offered since.\n\nâI have nothing to hide; it seems my honesty is what people relate to most,â he once told Vintage Guitar magazine. âAnders (Osborne) told me early on, âIf you donât believe what youâre singing, youâll never be a good singer.â I try not to write fluff; I try to make every word count.â\n\nThat point became convincingly clear with his last record 2018âs First Class Life, a collection of songs that detailed his journey from addiction to sobriety and the subsequent success he achieved through his award-winning body of work. A multiple award winner and nominee, Zito has built his career on an ability to tap into tradition while maintaining contemporary credence all at the same time.\n\nZitoâs upcoming album -- his 16th -- due this November on Ruf Records and descriptively titled Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, finds him broadening his boundaries still further even as it marks a return to his roots. The album consists of 20 Chuck Berry classics performed by Zito and an impressive array of 21 guest guitarists, among them Joe Bonamassa, Walter Trout, Eric Gales, Robben Ford, Sonny Landreth, Luther Dickinson, Albert Castiglia, Anders Osborne and, significantly, Chuckâs grandson, Charles Berry III.\n\nâThis was a very special project for me,â Zito says. âI lived in Chuckâs hometown of St. Louis for 32 years, and I worked at a small musical instrument store where his drummer also happened to be employed. Chuckâs son would drop by on occasion as well. He was an icon, and rightfully so. Iâve been playing his songs since I was a kid. Needless to say, he was a tremendous influence on my career, and, of course, on many other musiciansâ as well.â\n\n\" If you donât believe what youâre singing, youâll never be a good singer.â I try not to write fluff; I try to make every word count \" Mike Zito\n\nProduced by Zito himself, the album was recorded at his own Marz Studios and mixed and mastered by David Farrell. âWe recorded the basic tracks and then sent them to each guest musician,â Zito recalls. âThey added their contributions and then sent the files back to us. The process took a year to complete.\" Naturally, patience and perseverance have been Zitoâs stock and trade since the beginning. He began playing guitar at the age of five, and by the time he reached his late teens, he was already a fixture on the local St. Louis music scene. He initially released his music independently and then signed with Eclecto Groove Records in 2008. \"Pearl River,\" the title track of his 2009 album for the label, won Song of the Year at the Blues Music Awards and marked his first collaboration with Cyril Nevill, with whom heâd later work in the Royal Southern Brotherhood.\n\nA steady succession of critically acclaimed albums followed, culminating in 2011âs Greyhound, which was nominated for Best Rock Blues Album at that yearâs Blue Music Awards ceremony in Memphis. Two years later, he signed with Ruf Records and released Gone to Texas, the story of how he gained his sobriety, offered an emotional homage to the state that left an indelible imprint on his entire life. It also marked the debut of his band, the Wheel.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Zito also played an integral role in the super group of sorts, Royal Southern Brotherhood. The group released two albums and a DVD, Songs from the Road - Live in Germany, winner of the yearâs Blues Music Award for Best DVD. He also made his mark behind the boards by producing albums for Samantha Fish, Albert Castiglia, Ally Venable, Jeremiah Johnson, Jimmy Carpenter, and many others.\n\nMeanwhile, the accolades keep coming. His album Make Blues Not War debuted on the Billboard Blues Album Chart at number one and garnered him recognition as the 2018 Rock Blues Artist of the Year at the Blues Music Awards. Last yearâs First Class Life followed suit, also entering the charts at number one. Alternate Root magazine insisted that âThe First Class Life that Mike Zito titles his upcoming album can be heard in the sweet sound of Blue Soul rising like heat waves from his guitar and his vocal.â American Blues Scene said âMike Zitoâs return to the blues is, in a word, triumphant!â No Depression declared, âOnce again, Zito has delivered the goods, a first class package with no postage due.â\n\nNow, with Rock N Roll: A Tribute to Chuck Berry, Mike Zito again does what he does best, making an album thatâs humble, heartfelt, skilled and sublime....and, to paraphrase Chuck himself, letting it rock all at the same time.\n\nCheck out Mike Zito live on YouTube!\n\nFronting a superb band this will be one gig to savour.

As most of the band are resident in the North East they do not venture this far south a great deal and also they carefully choose the times when they can take this project on the road.\n\nThe stunning blues-rock music of Paul Kossoff, the lead guitar prodigy whose soaring playing lit up 1970s rockers Free, is coming to Long Street Blues Club. Kossoff, of course, died tragically young after a drugs battle aged just 25, but his music lives on with The Band Plays On, a band featuring Terry Slesser, the lead vocalist of Kossâs post-Free band, Back Street Crawler.\n\nForty years on since Paul Kossoff, one of Britainâs finest guitarists, tragically passed away at the tender age of 25 in 1976. Singer Terry Slesser, the voice of Kossoff's critically acclaimed post-Free band Back Street Crawler, and a close friend of Koss, keeps the memory of one of the greatest British Blues guitarist and his music alive. Sless has chosen the guitarist John Buckton, of whom Simon Kirke said \"If Free were to reform John would be my first choice as guitarist\", to play a series of special dates reviving for the first time since the 70s the catalogue of Back Street Crawler songs as well as favourite Free numbers.\n\nAlso included in the lineup is drummer Clive Edwards (UFO, Wild Horses, Pat Travers) and highly respected keyboard player Mark Taylor (Elton John, Simple Minds, The Alarm). The Band Plays On play will feature the very best of Freeâs back catalogue and also Back Street Crawlerâs two-album sojourn.\n\nThe bandâs name is fittingly also the name of BSCâs first album with Kossoff from 1975. Highlights include Freeâs world-wide hit and rock anthem âAll Right Nowâ, âFire and Waterâ, crowd pleaser âThe Hunterâ and âMolten Goldâ, one of the first tracks Slesser and Kossoff played together with Back Street Crawler.\n\nON SALE NOW - Advance Tickets are Â£17.00 from usual outlets or book online (online booking fee applies) Tickets Â£19 on the door\n\nSaturday 27th November 2021 | ANTONIO FORCIONE QUARTET | Doors 7.45pm\n\nBack by overwhelming popular demand is the amazing Antonio Forcione this time with his renowned quartet.\n\nThe Antonio Forcione Quartet have been performing and wowing audiences at sell out concerts all over the world.

Guaranteed.\n\nSaturday 30th October 2021 - CLIMAX BLUES BAND | Doors 7.45pm\n\nWe are delighted to have Climax Blues Band as replacements for the postponed Billy Bremner gig. The Billy Bremner gig has been postponed until Friday 8th April 2022 - venue tbc. The postponement is due to the current restrictions in travel between Sweden (where the band are based) and the UK.\n\nClimax Blues Band were formed in 1968 by Colin Cooper who led the band with Pete Haycock through great success and recognition through the 1970s and 1980s, with huge selling albums like FM Live and Gold Plated, hit singles Couldnât Get It Right and I Love You.\n\nGeorge Glover joined the band on keyboards in 1981, Haycock left in 1984 and Lester Hunt came into the re-vamped Climax in 1985, Roy Adams joined in 1987 and Neil Simpson in the early 1990s. Colin Cooper was leading the band with a return to the kind of blues that got the band started before his untimely death in 2008. His wish was the for the band to continue and the recruitment of Graham Dee and Chris âBeebeâ Aldridge was made with a view to broadening the Climax sound again and take on new musical influences, move forward creatively which was the Climax Blues Band trademark, rather than rely on the past glories.\n\n\"Climax Blues Band are very much still proudly flying the flag in 2021, moving forwards, blending the old with the new, and loving making music\".\n\nClassic Rock MagazineThe live album Security Alert was released in 2015 and reflected this move forward and the fact that Climax were delighting old and new fans alike throughout the UK and Europe. Roy Wood of ELO and Wizzard fame mixed the live album. Graham Dee as a focal point is a larger than life front man who holds the audience in the palm of his hand. His amazing vocal range sets him apart from the field and he is quite happy to go walk about in the audience to spread the joy. Chris Aldridge is more laid back and does his talking with his outstanding virtuoso sax playing, easing through soul, jazz and blues influences with great style.\n\n2019 saw the release of the album HANDS OF TIME, the first studio album of original songs since Drastic Steps in 1987. Hands Of Time went straight to the top of Amazon downloads and to No. 3 in the iTunes Blues chart. With the 30 year experienced bedrock rhythm unit of Adams and Simpson, Climax veteran George Glover holding everything together from the keyboard stand as band leader, and Les Huntâs supreme guitar skills transcending all the musical areas Climax find themselves in. A firm statement of intent is given: Climax Blues Band are very much still proudly flying that flag in 2021, moving forwards, blending the old with the new, and loving making music.\n\nFrom the USA - JIMMY CARPENTER | Saturday 2nd October 2021 | Doors 7.45pm\n\nAcoustic Support from Lewis Clark\n\nJimmy Carpenter, saxophonist, singer-songwriter, and arranger, began his musical journey over 35 years ago.

Expressed through a distinctive bitter-sweet vocal delivery, Ian's songs hold nothing back. His ability and willingness to share with his audience, naked honesty and genuine emotion, is what sets him apart.\n\nIan's career took off in the summer of 2003, when he signed to Ruf Records following a personal introduction to US record producer, David Z (Prince - Purple Rain). His debut album 'INSIDE' (Ruf1094) was released in October of that year. Further albums, live DVDs and extensive tours of Europe and the USA followed, with Parker always seeking new musical avenues to explore, never content to merely rehash old ideas, no matter how successful they may have been. To this end, Ian is something of journeyman, guided by his art and his self-confessed emotional need to express his soul through music.\n\nHis journey has taken unexpected turns, testing his loyal following from time to time, but the integrity of his writing, the quality of his distinctive voice and the soulful nature of his signature guitar playing have always been the bedrock of his work. Following the release of Politik Blues (Eye-Pea002) in April 2015, Ian refocused his attention on the Stratocaster-driven blues music he began building his reputation on, more than twenty years ago.\n\nA return to the iconic Rockfield Studios (Queen â A Night at the Opera) in the summer of 2018 resulted in the blues album many long-standing fans and critics alike are lauding as his best work to date. âSpoonful of Gold â Blues for Willieâ celebrates the music of Willie Dixon, delivered in Ianâs inimitable style.\n\nFreed from the shackles of being the new kid on the block vying for attention in an over-saturated market, Parker approaches his music, these days, with the calm, self-assurance that accompanies one who has, to some extent, been there and done it.\n\nNothing to prove and still so much to say, Ian Parker remains an act not to be missed.\n\nAdvance Tickets are Â£15.00 from usual outlets or book online (online booking fee applies) Tickets Â£17 on the door\n\nSaturday 25th January 2020 - from the USA - KIRK FLETCHER BAND\n\nSpecial support from Liam Alexander Ward | Doors 7.45pm\n\nThe first night of our Beat the January Blues Weekend is going to be one special evening.\n\nKirk Fletcher is an artist we have been trying to get for ages and finally we have managed it. Joe Bonamassa rates Kirk as one the finest guitarists in the world, some accolade from such a legend.\n\nKirk Fletcher has a reputation as a bonafide canât-miss performer. His soulful playing and singing never fails to elicit chills, and his unique approach to Rhythm & Blues music is both refreshingly modern and completely authentic.\n\nWidely considered one of the best blues guitarists in the world, he has commanded the respect and acclaim of critics, peers and fans across the globe.\n\nHe is a four-time Blues Music Award and a 2015 British Blues Award nominee and has played with a variety of popular artists, including Joe Bonamassa and a three-year role as lead guitarist of The Fabulous Thunderbirds. He released three studio albums and a live album.\n\nKirk first picked up a guitar at age eight, playing alongside his older brother Walter in their fatherâs church. One day with his older brother, Kirk visited a small L.A. guitar shop, Music Works, which ultimately became his second home after meeting Jeff Rivera, Robben Fordâs guitar tech. âWe started hanging out and I would help load gear, change strings and just be a fly on the wall to some of the most amazing music Iâve ever heard,â Kirk remembers.\n\nIt was in the next few years that Kirkâs full introduction to traditional blues occurred. He started seeking out other musicians who shared this same understanding â enter Al Blake, lead singer and harp player for the Hollywood Fats Band. After hosting dinner every Sunday, Al would offer Kirk early 20th Century blues records as dessert. He also helped establish connections to other famous West Coast blues artists like Junior Watson and Richard âLynwood Slimâ Duran. So followed Kirkâs first gigs as a blues guitarist and eventually the recording of his first album Iâm Here & Iâm Gone for the JSP label out of England.\n\n\"An absolute master of blues, soul, gospel and funk guitar.\"\n\nMusic Radar\n\nAl Blake would also introduce Kirk to Kim Wilson of The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Wilson brought Fletcher further into the blues family from California to Texas and then out touring the world. One highlight during this time was at Antoneâs Night Club 25th Anniversary Week in Austin, Texas, which gave Kirk the opportunity to perform with his blues heroes Pinetop Perkins, James Cotton and Hubert Sumlin. Wilson also tapped Kirk to play on his Grammy-nominated Smokinâ Joint live album. Shortly thereafter a call to collaborate came from blues legend Charlie Musselwhite, confirming that Kirk was becoming one of the most in-demand blues guitarists on the scene.\n\nSo began three years on the road with the Thunderbirds. Kirk contributed to the Thunderbirdsâ Paint It On album and time spent with many famous blues artists along the way, including a brief stint with the late Doyle Bramhall Sr. and a few guest appearances playing for Cindi Lauper, Michelle Branch and a world tour with Italian mega-star Eros Ramazzotti. Kirk more recently has been part of two projects with close friend Joe Bonamassa Muddy Wolf at Redrocks and the Grammy nominated Live at the Greek Theatre.\n\nDemand for this gig will be very strong indeed so early booking is strongly advised.\n\nAdvance Tickets are Â£16.00 from usual outlets or book online (online booking fee applies) Tickets Â£18 on the door\n\nSunday 26th January 2020 - Billy Bremner's Rockfiles | Doors 7.45pm\n\nFor the final night of our Beat the January Blues Weekend we welcome one of the true legends of the UK music scene Billy Bremner and his band. The evening will be dedicated to the music of Rockpile, a band he formed with Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe and had great commercial success.\n\nScottish Guitar Legend from Rockpile & The Pretenders. Billy Bremner started out in Luluâs backing group The Luvvers. After joining Neil Innes in the band Fatso he recorded some solo singles under the pseudonym âBill Murrayâ before joining Nick Lowe and Dave Edmunds in Rockpile.\n\nBilly Bremner sang lead vocals on the 1980 Rockpile single âHeartâ. He then wrote âTrouble Boysâ which became a hit for both Dave Edmunds and Thin Lizzy. Bremner then released a few solo singles on Stiff Records before becoming a full time member of The Pretenders where he played the lead guitar on their 1982 hit âBack on the Chain Gangâ.\n\nRockfiles live performances are rare these days so we are very pleased to be included on this short UK tour.

Pete Gage joined Dr Feelgood when Lee Brilleaux sadly passed away. Dave Raeburn joined the Hoax as their drummer the rest is history with that band.
