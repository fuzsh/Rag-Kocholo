        "text": "After releasing their seminal debut album, Since I Left You, two decades ago, The Avalanches became a go-to reference among music nerds and sample aficionados. The Australian electronic duo made a meticulous record that influenced thousands, including music giants like MF DOOM. Now, the late rapper is getting a belated chance to collaborate with them in the form of a “Tonight May Have to Last Me All My Life” remix.\n\nFor his spin on the staple single, MF DOOM turned up the vinyl static and let his iconic freestyle flow do its thing, rapping atop the classic with the mellow flair and witty wordplay he was known for. It’s pretty special to hear MF DOOM flexing so casually again atop “Tonight May Have to Last Me All My Life” mere months after the news of his death broke. It’s one of the few previously unreleased collaborations fans had yet to hear from the late rapper, and it delivers in the most casual and comforting way possible.\n\nMF DOOM’s remix of is one of several brand new tracks exclusive to the 20th anniversary deluxe edition of Since I Left You, due out June 4th via Astralwerks. It’s a stacked release that features new takes on the album’s various classic tracks from the likes of Stereolab, Prince Paul, Black Dice, Leon Vynehall, Sinkane, and Carl Craig, among others.\n\nRelated Video"
