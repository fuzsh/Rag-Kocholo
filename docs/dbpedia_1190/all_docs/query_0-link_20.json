        "text": "Clyde McPhatter was born in Durham, NC, on November 15, 1932, one of six children. The McPhatters moved to New York City in late 1950 and McPhatter,. after singing for a few years with gospel groups, joined Billy Ward's Dominoes.\n\nThe Dominoes signed with King Records in 1950 and recorded the chart-topping \"Sixty Minute Man\" with McPhatter singing the lead vocals. That song was the biggest R&B hit of 1951 and the first by a black group to cross over from the R&B to the pop charts. McPhatter stayed with the group for three years, singing such hits as \"Have Mercy Baby\", \"The Bells,\" \"I'd Be Satisfied\". However, Ward had his name as top billing and collected all of the profits, while McPhatter wasn't earning enough to live on from the small amount of money that Ward paid him. Finally, in early 1953, McPhatter decided to quit.\n\nAtlantic Records approached him with an offer to record his own group, eventually named The Drifters. As the group's leader McPhatter racked up a number of hits, beginning with \"Money Honey\"--which became the biggest R&B hit of 1954--\"Such a Night,\" \"Honey Love,\" \"White Christmas\" and \"What'cha Gonna Do.\" McPhatter had already made a decision to leave The Drifters, as he saw himself moving toward a solo career. His voice was so dominant that it took five years for the Drifters to recover after he left.\n\nIn 1955, McPhatter recorded a duet for Atlantic Records with Ruth Brown on \"Love Has Joined Us Together,\" which made number 8 on the R&B charts, and in August of that year he recorded \"Seven Days,\" which became a number 2 R&B hit in 1956. In 1956 he scored with \"Treasure of Love,\" which was his first solo chart-topper on the R&B and the pop charts. \"Just to Hold My Hand\" made the Top 10 on the R&B charts and \"Long Lonely Nights\" made the pop Top 30 in 1957.\n\nIn 1956 Atlantic released his singles as Clyde McPhatter & the Drifters. McPhatter saw his biggest hit on Atlantic in 1958 with \"A Lover's Question,\" which was a top 10 smash on the pop charts and a #1 seller on the R&B listings. He had three more chart singles in 1959, none of which broke the Top 10.\n\nHe left Atlantic that year after one last hit, \"Lovey Dovey\", and had some minor hits in \"I Told Myself a Lie\" and \"Think Me a Kiss\" in 1960. He moved to Mercury Records and his career picked up again with the Top 10 single \"Ta Ta,\" which was followed by the smash Top 10 pop single in 1962 with \"Lover Please\". It seemed that McPhatter was back on top. However, behind the scenes, he was dealing with alcoholism and unreliability and his career started to spiral down.\n\nOver the next few years he recorded for several smaller labels but was unable to get a hit or keep his performing career going. McPhatter moved to England. In the early 1960s he found work in British clubs for a few years until the same personal problems began to haunt him. He returned to the U.S. in the early 1970s, and signed with Decca Records. He recorded the album \"Welcome Home\", which was his final attempt at a comeback. It was too late for McPhatter, however, both professionally and personally, as alcoholism, depression and personal problems ended with a fatal heart attack in New York in 1972\n\nEver heard \"I Want Candy\" or \"Not Fade Away\" or \"Willie & The Hand Jive\", Shirley & Company's \"Shame, Shame, Shame\" or U2's \"Desire\" or George Michael's \"Faith\"? If you have, then you've heard the \"Bo Diddley beat\", the most famous beat in the world! One of the founding fathers of rock 'n' roll, Bo Diddley's innovative pounding and hypnotic, Latin-tinged beat, his vast array of electric custom-built guitars, his use of reverb, tremelo and distortion to make his guitars talk, mumble and roar, his use of female musicians, his wild stage shows, and his on-record and on-stage rapping, pre-date all others. Bo Diddley was born Ellas Bates on Sunday December 30, 1928, on a small farm near the town of McComb, Mississippi, in rural Pike County, close to the Louisiana border, the only child of Ethel Wilson and Eugene Bates, he had three half-brothers and a half-sister. He was adopted by his mother's cousin, Mrs. Gussie McDaniel, along with his cousins Willis, Lucille and Freddie, and adopted the name Ellas McDaniel. In the mid-1'30s the family moved to the south side of Chicago. Soon after, he began to take violin lessons from Professor O.W. Frederick at the Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church. He studied the violin for 12 years, composing two concertos for the instrument. For Christmas in 1940, his sister Lucille bought him his first guitar, a cheap Harmony acoustic. It was at this time that he acquired the nickname \"Bo Diddley\" (\" . . . Bo Diddley is me; to tell ya the truth, I don't know what it [the name] really is . . . \") from his fellow pupils at the Foster Vocational High School in Chicago. The newly named Bo Diddley had long been fascinated by the rhythms that he heard coming from the sanctified churches. A frustrated drummer, he tried to translate the sounds that he heard into his own style. Gradually he began to duplicate what he did with his violin bow by rapidly flicking his pick across his guitar strings: \"I play the guitar as if I'm playing the drums . . . I play drum licks on the guitar.\" He continued to practice the guitar through his early teens. Shortly before leaving school he formed his first group, a trio named The Hipsters, later known as The Langley Avenue Jive Cats, after the Chicago street where he lived. Upon graduation he pursued a variety of low-paid occupations including truck driving, building site work and boxing, playing locally with his group to supplement his income. Around this time he married his first wife, Louise Woolingham, but the marriage did not survive. A year later he married Ethel \"Tootsie\" Smith, a marriage that lasted just over a decade. In 1950 maracas player Jerome Green joined the group, followed a year later by harmonica player Billy Boy Arnold. After more than a decade of playing on street corners and in clubs around Chicago, Bo Diddley finally got the chance to cut a demo of 2 songs that he had written; \"Uncle John\" and \"I'm A Man\". After various rejections from local record labels (most notably VeeJay), in the spring of 1955 he took the recordings to brothers Leonard and Phil Chess, owners of Chess Records, with studios located at 4750-2 South Cottage Grove Ave. in Chicago. They suggested that he changed the title and the lyrics of \"Uncle John\" to more reflect his own unique personality. The twp songs were re-recorded at Bill Putnam's Universal Recording Studio at 111 E. Ontario in Chicago on Wednesday, March 2, 1955, and released as a double A-side disc \"Bo Diddley\"/\"I'm A Man\" on the Chess Records subsidiary label Checker Records. It went straight to the top of the R&B charts, establishing him as one of the most exciting and original new talents in American music. With musical influences of his own ranging from Louis Jordan to John Lee Hooker, and from 'Nat 'King' Cole' to Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley was now set to help shape and define the sound and presentation of rock music for all time. From Elvis Presley to George Thorogood, from The Rolling Stones to ZZ Top, from The Doors to The Clash, from Buddy Holly to Prince, and from The Everly Brothers to Run DMC, all acknowledged the unique influences of Bo Diddley upon their styles of music. Now in his early 70s, he is still very much active in the recording studio and in the clubs and the concert halls around the world. He performed a rousing version of his classic song \"Who Do You Love\" with George Thorogood & The Destroyers in front of a TV audience of millions at the Live Aid Concert in Philadelphia in 1985. A couple of years later he was deservedly an early inductee into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. In 1996 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm 'n' Blues Foundation and in 1998 received another Lifetime Achievement Award, this time from The Recording Academy at that year's annual Grammy Awards Ceremony. In 2000 yet another honor was justifiably awarded to him when he was inducted into The Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame. In the words of one of his many famous eponymous songs, \"Bo Diddley Put The Rock in Rock 'n' Roll\", and remember . . . Bo Knows!\n\nThe Penguins were an early \"doo-wop\" group that was formed by several classmates at Los Angeles' Fremont High School in the early 1950s (one of its members, Curtis Williams, had previously been a member of The Hollywood Flames). They took their name from the character \"Willie the Penguin\" on the package of \"Kool\" cigarettes, a brand that one of the members smoked.\n\nThey recorded a song called \"Hey Senorita\" that was released by Dootone Records in 1954. It got some airplay, but one day a DJ flipped the record over and played the \"B\" side, and audience reaction to the song was swift: it shot to #1 on the Billboard charts and stayed there for three weeks. The song was what turned out to be a \"doo-wop\" classic: \"Earth Angel\".\n\nThe airwaves were very strictly segregated at the time, and most white-owned radio stations would not play records by black artists; if a record became a hit on the \"black\" stations, record companies would hire a white group to re-record it so it could get played on the white stations. A white group called The Crew Cuts--which had re-recorded \"Sh-Boom\", a hit for the black group The Chords in 1954 and had a big hit with it--re-recorded \"Earth Angel\" and it got heavy airplay on the white stations, eventually rising to #3 on the pop charts.\n\nAfter the success of \"Earth Angel\", the group left Dootone Records for the much larger Mercury Records, but their records at Mercury didn't do much on the charts. The group went through a string of personnel changes, and although one of their songs, \"Pledge of Love\", hit #15 on the R&B charts, they never again had a record that hit nationally, and the group broke up in 1962. Different versions of the group formed and re-formed over the next several years, and in 1999 the current version appeared on the \"oldies\" special Doo Wop 50 (1999).\n\nRichard Wayne Penniman, better known as Little Richard, the self-proclaimed \"Architect of Rock 'n' Roll\", traveled in his early days with the legendary vaudeville star Spencer \"Snake\" Anthony. One of Richard's early bands had the young, then unknown singer James Brown (the Godfather of Soul), a fourteen-year-old keyboardist named Billy Preston, and the famous and legendary rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix. His first recording session took place at WGST in Atlanta, Georgia, USA; he was backed by a local band led by Billy Wright. This session produced a local hit called \"Every Hour\" which enjoyed heavy airplay on Atlanta's WERD radio station which was the first completely Black-owned radio station in the United States. Little Richard was backed up by his idol Billy Wright, once referred to him as the most fantastic entertainer he had ever seen. Indeed, it was Wright who used a brand of makeup called Pancake 31.\n\nLittle Richard admitted to copying Wright's penchant for heavy makeup and wild stage theatrics. With a public persona and personal life marked by sexual ambiguity, he would make his mark with later hits such as the suggestive \"Tutti Frutti\" and \"Good Golly Miss Molly\". Unbeknownst to many fans, Richard overcame a debilitating drug habit and eventually became an ordained minister. Beginning in the 1980s, he saw a resurgence in his popularity as he acquired small acting roles where he impressed fans, old and new, with his unique comedic timing. As versatile and ageless as ever, Little Richard continues to delight fans the world over with his extraordinary stage presence and flamboyant antics. Now inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the American Songwriters Hall of Fame, he remains one of the most popular entertainers in the world."
