        "text": "I learned of Jackson Taylor years ago when he was touring as the Jackson Taylor Band (JTB). In 2001, Taylor set out to be an edgy rock and country artist and songwriter.\n\nJackson Taylor is the perfect example of being, as they call them in the music industry, a true \"independent artist\". JTB got out touring, recording, managing, booking, and onto the Billboard charts without the help of anyone else. He even got the attention of legendary performers like Willie Nelson, Jason Boland, Billie Joe Shaver, Dale Watson, and others.\n\nGrowing up, Taylor only had visions of being a farmer or a rancher, much like his father, who was a migrant farm worker. Taylor spent his time listening to the likes of Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, and some Texas rockers like the Pear Ratz, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and The Black Crowes.\n\nAccording to the Official Jackson Taylor Website\n\nMuch of Jackson’s career early on was marred by excessive drugs and alcohol, and violent outbursts. Cementing his image as a wild and out-of-control artist. Leading him to being blacklisted from many venues across the country and internationally. Source: The Official Jackson Taylor Website\n\nIn the last five years though, Texas music’s badass has made good for himself by creating \"Jackson Taylor & the Sinners\". Taylor seems to have recalibrated his life, and was offered his place in Texas music history by recording a Live at Billy Bob’s CD/DVD in 2013, which is hard to believe because he had been banned from so many places just a few years before."
