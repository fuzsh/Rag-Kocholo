Not unlike the artists who inspired them, the duo’s songs frequently dabble in stories of revenge, drinking and feature sinners of all stripes and persuasions.\n\nOozing an infectious stage presence and chemistry that carries over from the music to the back and forth banter between songs, “A Tale Of Two” offers a different kind of Americana – storytelling by a swampy pair of retro raconteurs spinning blues arias with soul, intrigue and power.\n\nWebsite: https://www.taleoftwomusic.com/\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkpPt0dT1SQ\n\nView Event →\n\nWHQR Soup to Nuts Live! w/ Jon Shain & FJ Ventre\n\nDoors open at 3pm, show 4-6pm. Tickets are $15.\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nHailing from Durham, NC, Jon Shain is a veteran singer-songwriter who’s been turning heads for years with his words, his fiery acoustic guitar work, and his evolved musical style – combining improvised piedmont blues with bluegrass, swing, and ragtime. Jon has released nine solo albums to date, along with two albums with duo partner FJ Ventre, a Jon Shain Trio live album, and one album of co-writes with Joe Newberry. Shain’s newest album, Restless Soul Syndrome, recorded at Good Luck Studio this past year, will be released April 9, 2024. Shain is also the author of the music books Gettin’ Handy With the Blues – a Tribute to the Legacy of W.C. Handy and Jon Shain’s Fingerstyle Guitar Method, both published by Mel Bay Publications. In 2019, Shain won the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, TN in the solo/duo category.\n\nJon grew up in Haverhill, Massachusetts, a Merrimack River mill-town that had already seen its better days by the time he was a child in the 1970s. His family’s business was a small textile dyeing company, and he worked in the factory during the summers throughout his teens. At the same time, Shain began to discover his love of American roots music and songwriting, specifically drawn to the narratives about regular people and themes of social justice.\n\nShain headed south to North Carolina in 1986, to study American History at Duke University and to continue his musical journey, as well. In addition to studying with jazz professor Paul Jeffrey, he also had the good fortune to learn the piedmont blues tradition firsthand by playing in Big Boy Henry’s backing band. It was at this time that Shain also got to meet and play with John Dee Holeman and a number of the great older NC blues players. Shain's classes in school were heavily concentrated in southern history, English, and world religions. That mixture of the academic environment and the real-world blues music is what has most informed his musical direction.\n\nShain cut his touring teeth from 1989-1998 founding the Chapel Hill, NC folk-rock group, Flyin' Mice and their spin-off group, WAKE. The band performed with acts such as David Grisman, Tony Rice Unit, Hot Tuna, and the Dixie Dregs, released four CDs, and played clubs, schools, and festivals up and down the East Coast, building a legion of fans.\n\nAfter the band’s breakup, Shain went solo, returning to his roots by touring in the folk and blues circuit. Shain has also become a sought after guitar teacher and studio producer. In 2021, he produced Donna Herula’s blues radio chart-topping album, Bang at the Door.\n\nOver the last several years, Shain has headlined listening rooms both as a solo and with duo partner FJ Ventre throughout the US and he's done two solo tours in Europe. He has opened shows for John Hiatt, Keb’ Mo’, Little Feat, and many other roots legends. When Shain is not recording, producing other artists, or performing, he stays busy giving private instruction in guitar, and teaching group workshops in songwriting and blues guitar.\n\nFJ Ventre began playing music with Jon in 1982 when they met in high school and have developed a brotherly connection that continues to this day. Ventre went to University of Massachusetts-Lowell, earning a B.A. in Music Performance and Sound Recording and remained for some time in the Boston area, performing in the city's vibrant music scene. Since relocating to Chapel Hill, NC in 2000, Ventre has performed with his own group The Swang Brothers, as well as with Chris Stamey, Wes Collins, Huzzah, and a who's who of NC music groups. In addition to being a sought-after bassist, Ventre spends his time behind the mixing board, producing and engineering at his own Good Luck Studio as well as writing his own songs.\n\nWell into its second decade, WHQR's Soup To Nuts LIVE! has become one of the Cape Fear region's favorite, live-listening experiences, featuring a wide array of musical genres on its stage.\n\nSTNL!'s recording process reflects its commitment to high quality, ongoing success, and the hard work of its technical staff. Each performance is engineered, multitracked, and edited into a one-hour program for broadcast on an upcoming date. In addition, WHQR forwards and cross-promotes the live event (and the later broadcast) across their website, on-air, social media, and related platforms.\n\nStarting in 2023, Live At Ted’s joined in hosting and booking acts for the STNL! show, alternating hosting duties each month with WHQR. Ted’s listening room environment, recording capabilities, and commitment to showcasing original music made for a seamless partnership.\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj3klop8pGk\n\nWebsite: https://www.jonshain.com/\n\nView Event →\n\nCaleb Caudle & The Sweet Critters\n\nDoors open at 7pm, show 8-10pm. Tickets are $25.\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nJust as the marbled salamanders emerge from under damp logs and leaves, the mushrooms—smooth, pearlescent ones and spongy morels—turn on like night lights glowing in the dark, and the long-horned beetles and regal moths begin buzzing. The fiddlehead ferns and trout lilies curl inward, a copperhead slowly swerves, and a fox steps into the moonlight looking for prey. It is here, in that restless middle of the night, under cover of darkness, where Caleb Caudle’s sixth studio LP Sweet Critters is nestled.\n\nThrough sometimes shadowy arrangements that creep and lurk, Caudle continues to mine both the brightest and murkiest corners of his imagination, finding that purest of points where tenderness and grit collide, inspired by musical heroes like Buddy Miller and Guy Clark, and mentors like Elizabeth Cook and John Paul White. It was White who Caudle tapped to produce Sweet Critters, along with Ben Tanner, at the duo’s Florence, Alabama studio Sun Drop Sound. \"I was very excited to work with Caleb on this record. Iʼve been a fan for years and count him as\n\na friend,” White says of working with Caudle. “Heʼs a stellar songwriter, so I knew heʼd bring the goods. And he did.” The album features Allison Russell, Aoife OʼDonovan, John Paul White, and Caudleʼs own touring band.\n\nThese songs are a showcase of Caudle’s singular command of language. He sees the world through a hyperreal lens wholly unique to him, one that renders dank humidity “horsefly heat,” a moody sky “cast iron skillet” dark, or a loved one’s “wind chime of a smile.” For Caudle, details are the last frontier in a world where thousands of new songs are created every day. As such, he weaves his intricate tales of redemption, sacrifice, forgiveness, and loss with the colorful threads of living, breathing characters and all the rich idiosyncrasies and ephemera that fill out their worlds.\n\nCaudle and his band have played Stagecoach, Cayamo, Luck Reunion, Mountain Stage, Merlefest, Americanafest, The Long Road (UK), AMAUK (UK), and recently supported Marty Stuart, Steve Earle, Hayes Carll, Elizabeth Cook, Brent Cobb, Charles Wesley Godwin, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and many more.\n\nWebsite: https://www.calebcaudle.com/\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/b0D2oOPlbKA?si=wbjGLi_uenHL0FcS\n\nView Event →\n\nJive Turkey featuring Randy McQuay\n\nDoors open at 3pm, show 4-6pm.

I was watching a friend of mine going through a divorce and it was hard on her, and I could see her trying to hold onto to something that was already long gone, and she was holding onto more of the idea of how it used to be instead of how it actually was. It’s like holding onto an electric fence waiting for it to stop hurting you, when all you have to do is let go. I’ve had to keep learning this lesson over and over, so I’m singing it to myself just as much as documenting her story too.\"[3]\n\n​ Shallow debuted \"Let It Pass\" on his livestream series \"Live from Shallow Chateau\" that he created during quarantine in response to all live shows being cancelled due to the pandemic.

Desperate to salvage the showcase, Rose approached Brian, who she knew fronted Canadian celtic rock band Enter the Haggis. She thrust a guitar into Brian’s hands, pulled him onstage, and the two just clicked.\n\nFour years and hundreds of shows later, the duo was booked to play a closing slot at a Colorado festival, so they hired a bass player and drummer to fill out their sound. By the oddest of coincidences, their hired bandmates’ flights were canceled the day of the show. A frantic Facebook post introduced Brian and Rose to local musician Caroline Browning, who joined them on bass for the weekend. Once again, the chemistry was undeniable, and House of Hamill became a trio.\n\nThe band's upcoming release, “Wildfire,” marks House of Hamill's most compelling work to date.

Tickets are $15.\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nSam Robbins is often described as an \"old soul singer songwriter.\" A Nashville based musician whose music evokes classic 70's singer songwriters like James Taylor and Neil Young, Sam adds a modern, upbeat edge to the storyteller troubadour persona. An avid performer, he has gained recognition from extensive touring and as one of the six 2021 winners in the Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk competition, one of the largest and most prestigious songwriting competitions in the country.\n\nSam released his debut album, Finally Feeling Young, on May 14th, 2021. The album is reminiscent of his 70's singer-songwriter heroes, with a modern perspective. On the heels of the award winning opening single, 'Remind Me\", Finally Feeling Young has already garnered radio airplay and critical acclaim. Two album tracks, Remind Me and Saying Amen, won him a place as one of the six Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk winners. Americana Highways writes: “He writes of subjects that others don't explore. Saying Amen has Robbins touching that special place Leonard Cohen went. This is brilliance.\" Fateau Magazine in the UK writes \"One of the most promising new songwriters of his generation\".\n\nA multi-instrumentalist from a young age, Sam began learning drums and piano, falling in love with guitar at age 15. He then started writing original music, recording his first CD during his sophomore year of high school, while playing open mics in his hometown of Portsmouth, NH.\n\nOver his career, Sam has performed countless shows across the country, in theaters, house concerts, biker bars, weddings, proposals, frat parties, and everything in between. Sam is able to tour full time, and feels at home in both intimate listening rooms and larger venues. Sam is a solo acoustic performer who melds intricate and exciting acoustic guitar arrangements with smooth, intriguing vocals. Wherever he is performing, Sam builds an intimate, easy connection with the listener, naturally creating a feeling of closeness throughout the performance.\n\nSam is a full time troubadour, playing over 150 shows a year across the country, including the MainStage at the Kerrville Folk Festival, Dripping Springs Songwriter’s Festival, and as one of the “‘Most Wanted to Return” artists in the 2023 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival.\n\nSince moving to Nashville in September 2019 following his graduation from Berklee College of Music, Sam has made a splash in music city - performing at the Bluebird Cafe within a month of moving, and sitting in again at the legendary venue with Liz Longley in February. Sam was also a winner at the Eddie's Attic Songwriter's shootout competition in Atlanta in early March 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Sam was able to audition and was aired on NBC's The Voice, performing for Adam Levine, Kelly Clarkson, Blake Shelton and Jennifer Hudson as the first artist to perform a Jim Croce song on the show.\n\nSam considers himself a student of songwriting, constantly searching and learning about why songs have the impact they do. A 2019 graduate of Berklee College of Music's songwriting department, he has hosted many songwriting workshops and masterclasses, including at the Harvard Music Department, the Boys & Girls Club of Boston, and the Folk Project's Fall Acoustic Getaway. In his performances and workshops, Sam explores the magic behind the craft of songwriting, and tries to help others express themselves through the unique and powerful medium of songwriting.\n\nWebsite: https://samrobbinsmusic.com/home\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/zUZbLTs263c\n\nView Event →\n\nAn Evening with Ted! - SOLD OUT\n\nDoors open at 7pm, show 8-10pm.

This show is SOLD OUT.\n\nOriginally formed in Wilmington, North Carolina, The Hatch Brothers are a breed of their own. Lead vocalist and songwriter, Sam Hatch, has an iconic voice that transcends genre. His songwriting approach captures stories in time with colorful chord progressions, unique time signatures, and poetic lyricism. Bassist Paul Hatch is a self-taught musician with an ear for improvisation. Paul is never afraid to play with new ideas in the moment. Drummer Phil Milligan is a master of many styles. His biggest asset is understanding exactly what a song needs. He picks his moments, and when it’s time to shine holds nothing back. Their newest member, Joe Sprunt, is the lead guitar master who undoubtedly breathes new life into the band. The overall sound is a blend of their favorite genres pulling from blues, rock, jazz and even folk in some instances. Collectively, The Hatch Brothers have undeniable chemistry and their ability to tailor songs on the spot creates a unique performance every time.\n\nIn 2010, brothers Paul and Sam Hatch began their journey in music performing at local Wilmington venues. Over time their vision grew, and they evolved into a full band, known as The Hatch Brothers. Although Phil and Joe are not technically related, the group has adopted the brother identity through and through.\n\nThe Hatch Brothers’ debut album Twelve Bar Grievances is a representation of transformation that fully encompasses the band’s spirit and energy. Some songs were written years ago while others were written just days before recording. The band’s favorite thing about the album is that there is at least one song for every kind of person out there. No matter what genre an audience may prefer, The Hatch Brothers ensure their music reaches everyone.\n\nWebsite: https://thehatchbrothers.com/\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqdy2LH7bSM\n\nWell into its second decade, WHQR's Soup To Nuts LIVE! has become one of the Cape Fear region's favorite, live-listening experiences, featuring a wide array of musical genres on its stage.\n\nSTNL!'s recording process reflects its commitment to high quality, ongoing success, and the hard work of its technical staff. Each performance is engineered, multitracked, and edited into a one-hour program for broadcast on an upcoming date. In addition, WHQR forwards and cross-promotes the live event (and the later broadcast) across their website, on-air, social media, and related platforms.\n\nStarting in 2023, Live At Ted’s joined in hosting and booking acts for the STNL! show, alternating hosting duties each month with WHQR. Ted’s listening room environment, recording capabilities, and commitment to showcasing original music made for a seamless partnership.\n\nView Event →\n\nAZUL & Emily Musolino\n\nDoors open at 7pm, show 8-10pm.

Influenced as a child by iconic female vocalists Etta James and Janis Joplin, Musolino’s music emits a dynamic combination of blues and shredding rock guitar with hints of jazz and classic outlaw country that only those with a mastery in music composition can create. Traversing addiction, discrimination, and growing up LGBT in the southeast, Musolino finds strength for her recovery in songwriting that culminates in authentic, pure music infused with strong feminist and queer positive messaging.\n\nAfter graduating from Berklee College of Music in 2012, Emily moved back home to Durham, North Carolina where she built her own recording studio, Blue Moose Studios. She quickly found her talents recruited by Dark Water Rising and spent the following 4 years performing over 200 shows a year, perfecting her sound.

Vocals, guitar and…other stuff, Lipbone has a style that adheres to no style at all. Musical, upbeat and imaginative, sometimes soft and soulful, his story is peppered with vocal trombones and throat-singing birds, fantastic animals and a host of poignant characters.

They started collaborating as a duo in 2015 and developed an original sound by blending diverse musical influences and unique approaches to their instruments and to songwriting. Perhaps best described as modern bluesy-folk with a touch of singer-songwriter storytelling, Soul-R Fusion’s music highlights ethereal fretless basslines and rhythmic acoustic guitar, that together complement intelligent, heartfelt lyrics.\n\nBased in Wilmington N.C., the duo are focused on writing and performing their own original music. Soul-R Fusion’s songs and live performances are uplifting, positive experiences that pull people in and make them feel good.\n\nSoul-R Fusion’s large repertoire of original music ranges from the humorously quixotic Slack Cat Blues to the elegant poignancy of Simple.

Tickets are $15.\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nHailing from Durham, NC, Jon Shain is a veteran singer-songwriter who’s been turning heads for years with his words, his fiery acoustic guitar work, and his evolved musical style – combining improvised piedmont blues with bluegrass, swing, and ragtime. Jon has released nine solo albums to date, along with two albums with duo partner FJ Ventre, a Jon Shain Trio live album, and one album of co-writes with Joe Newberry. Shain’s newest album, Restless Soul Syndrome, recorded at Good Luck Studio this past year, will be released April 9, 2024. Shain is also the author of the music books Gettin’ Handy With the Blues – a Tribute to the Legacy of W.C. Handy and Jon Shain’s Fingerstyle Guitar Method, both published by Mel Bay Publications. In 2019, Shain won the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, TN in the solo/duo category.\n\nJon grew up in Haverhill, Massachusetts, a Merrimack River mill-town that had already seen its better days by the time he was a child in the 1970s. His family’s business was a small textile dyeing company, and he worked in the factory during the summers throughout his teens. At the same time, Shain began to discover his love of American roots music and songwriting, specifically drawn to the narratives about regular people and themes of social justice.\n\nShain headed south to North Carolina in 1986, to study American History at Duke University and to continue his musical journey, as well. In addition to studying with jazz professor Paul Jeffrey, he also had the good fortune to learn the piedmont blues tradition firsthand by playing in Big Boy Henry’s backing band. It was at this time that Shain also got to meet and play with John Dee Holeman and a number of the great older NC blues players. Shain's classes in school were heavily concentrated in southern history, English, and world religions. That mixture of the academic environment and the real-world blues music is what has most informed his musical direction.\n\nShain cut his touring teeth from 1989-1998 founding the Chapel Hill, NC folk-rock group, Flyin' Mice and their spin-off group, WAKE. The band performed with acts such as David Grisman, Tony Rice Unit, Hot Tuna, and the Dixie Dregs, released four CDs, and played clubs, schools, and festivals up and down the East Coast, building a legion of fans.\n\nAfter the band’s breakup, Shain went solo, returning to his roots by touring in the folk and blues circuit. Shain has also become a sought after guitar teacher and studio producer. In 2021, he produced Donna Herula’s blues radio chart-topping album, Bang at the Door.\n\nOver the last several years, Shain has headlined listening rooms both as a solo and with duo partner FJ Ventre throughout the US and he's done two solo tours in Europe. He has opened shows for John Hiatt, Keb’ Mo’, Little Feat, and many other roots legends. When Shain is not recording, producing other artists, or performing, he stays busy giving private instruction in guitar, and teaching group workshops in songwriting and blues guitar.\n\nFJ Ventre began playing music with Jon in 1982 when they met in high school and have developed a brotherly connection that continues to this day. Ventre went to University of Massachusetts-Lowell, earning a B.A. in Music Performance and Sound Recording and remained for some time in the Boston area, performing in the city's vibrant music scene. Since relocating to Chapel Hill, NC in 2000, Ventre has performed with his own group The Swang Brothers, as well as with Chris Stamey, Wes Collins, Huzzah, and a who's who of NC music groups. In addition to being a sought-after bassist, Ventre spends his time behind the mixing board, producing and engineering at his own Good Luck Studio as well as writing his own songs.\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj3klop8pGk\n\nWebsite: https://www.jonshain.com/\n\nView Event →\n\nCatesby Jones\n\nDoors open at 7pm, show 8-10pm.

Tickets are $20.\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nSeth Walker is often cited as one of the most prolific contemporary Americana artists on the scene today. He’s a multi-dimensional talent who combines a gift for melody and lyric alongside a rich, Gospel-drenched, Southern-inflected voice with a true blue knack for getting around on the guitar. His new studio album, I Hope I Know, produced by Jano Rix of The Wood Brothers, and a string of singles, including “We Got This,” “Spirits Moving” and a cover of Van Morrison’s classic “Warm Love” further build upon this reputation.\n\nIn 2021, Walker added published author to his oeuvre with his first memoir, ‘Your Van Is On Fire.’ A riotous and charming melange of a touring musician’s life, the book is comprised of many short essays, poems and paintings he’d accumulated over a near 30-year career. Written during the pandemic lockdown, Walker offers a first hand account of an artist in perpetual motion who’s dedicated his life to chasing the muse wherever it may lead.\n\nGrowing up on a commune in rural North Carolina, the son of classically trained musicians, Seth Walker played cello long before discovering the guitar in his 20s. When his introduction to the blues came via his Uncle Landon Walker, who was both a musician and disc jockey, his fate was forever sealed. Instantaneously, Seth was looking to artists like T-Bone Walker, Snooks Eaglin, and B.B. King as a wellspring of endless inspiration. The rest is history. He’s released ten albums, broken into the Top 20 of the Americana Radio Charts, reached No. 2 on the Billboard Blues Album Chart and received praise from NPR, American Songwriter, No Depression and Relix, among others.\n\nIn addition to extensive recording and songwriting pursuits, Seth is consistently touring and performing at venues and festivals around the world. Along with headline shows, he’s been invited to open for The Mavericks, The Wood Brothers, Raul Malo, Paul Thorn and Ruthie Foster, among others.\n\nSeth Walker is currently based in Asheville, NC after previously residing in Austin, New Orleans and Nashville. He’s used those experiences wisely, soaking up the sounds and absorbing the musical lineage of these varied places. With a bluesman’s respect for roots and tradition, coupled with an appreciation for—and successful melding of—contemporary songwriting, Seth sublimely incorporates a range of styles with warmth and grace. Perhaps Country Standard Time said it best: “If you subscribe to the Big Tent theory of Americana, then Seth Walker –with his blend of blues, gospel, pop, R&B, rock, and a dash country—just might be your poster boy.”\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/knthwZWX-Yk\n\nWebsite:https://sethwalker.com/\n\nView Event →"
