        "text": "Taylor Swift has released an LP Giobbi remix and a live version of her hit song “Cruel Summer” from her concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.\n\nAfter dropping the two tracks, the singer-songwriter wrote on Instagram on Wednesday evening, “What a truly mind blowing thing you’ve turned The Eras Tour Concert Film into. I’ve been watching videos of you guys in the theaters dancing and prancing and recreating choreography, creating inside jokes, casting spells, getting engaged, and just generally creating the exact type of joyful chaos we’re known for.”\n\nShe continued, “One of my favorite things you’ve done was when you supported Cruel Summer SO much, I ended up starting The Eras Tour show with it. For old times sake, I’m releasing the live audio from the tour so we can all shriek it in the comfort of our homes and cars PLUS a brand new remix by [LP Giobbi]. Thank you, so much, forever, wow, just thank you!!!”\n\n“Cruel Summer” is one of more than three dozen songs featured in Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, which is currently playing in theaters.\n\nThe film lets audiences experience Swift’s Eras Tour concert, and was filmed over three Los Angeles shows at SoFi Stadium on the pop star’s record-breaking global tour. It has also become the top-grossing concert film of all time in North America.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter‘s TV critic Angie Han wrote in her review that each segment of the movie, which corresponds to nine of Swift’s albums, “feels like a mini-concert on its own, complete with its own visual language.”\n\n“Cruel Summer” was originally from Swift’s seventh studio album, Lover, which dropped in 2019.\n\nThe remix and live version songs came nearly a week ahead of the release of her next rerecorded album, 1989 (Taylor’s Version), which arrives Oct. 27.\n\nSwift announced in 2019 that she would rerecord her songbook to own her masters after Scooter Braun acquired Big Machine Records and her catalog of master recordings. The rerecorded albums that have already been released include Fearless (Taylor’s Version), Red (Taylor’s Version) and Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)."
