I've been watching videos of you guys in the theaters dancing and prancing and recreating choreography, creating inside jokes, casting spells, getting engaged and just generally creating the exact type of joyful chaos we're known for.\n\n'One of my favorite things you've done was when you supported Cruel Summer SO much, I ended up starting The Eras Tour show with it. For old times sake, I'm releasing the live audio from the tour so we can all shriek it in the comfort of our homes and cars PLUS a brand new remix by @lpgiobbi. Thank you, so much, forever, wow, just thank you!!!' (sic)\n\n'Cruel Summer' features on Taylor's 2019 album 'Lover' and is one of the 44 songs on 'The Eras Tour' set list, which encompasses songs from all 10 of her studio albums. 'The Eras Tour' concert film features performances from Taylor's six concerts at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles earlier in the year.\n\nSwifties can also look forward to the UK 'The Eras Tour' concerts, with Taylor set to perform in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London in 2024.\n\nTake a look at Taylor Swift's incredible career:\n\nYou can hear songs by Taylor Swift on Hits Radio.\n\nNow read:\n\nTaylor Swift's concert film of 'The Eras Tour' breaks box office records\n\nTaylor Swift: All your questions answered on the 'All Too Well' singer ðŸŽ¶\n\nTaylor Swift's albums: Facts and figures about her super successful records\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
