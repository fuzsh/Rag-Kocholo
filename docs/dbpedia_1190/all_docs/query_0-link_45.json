        "text": "I don’t know if Bruce Springsteen thinks about death as much as I think about the inevitability of his dying. I’ve lived an entire life as a fan of Bruce Springsteen, which means I have already imagined the world without him in it, and I have mourned that world. If you’re lucky enough to age gracefully beyond a certain point, with that aging will come an acceptance of finality or of the idea that there is going to be a darkness from which you can’t return. If you’re lucky enough to have made a life writing songs or stories or something at the intersection of songs and stories, this could mean that there comes a point where you make sure people hear you clearly, one last time, before you go.\n\nI don’t know if Springsteen himself thinks about his life and death in this way, but the silences in “Springsteen on Broadway” — which ran on Broadway from Oct. 3, 2017, to Dec. 15, 2018, culminating in a soundtrack and a Netflix special — suggest he might. The spaces he built in between the songs allow the artist to explain and give context not to just the music but also to the life built around the music. If the project of Springsteen’s Broadway show was to attach histories and legacies to the individual songs long adored by the public, there is also something to be said about what time does to natural storytellers. They can become more tactile with age, drawing out stories that have been told several times before the most current retelling — leaving a listener with even more touchable moments than otherwise might have been asked for or sought, so that when the storyteller is long gone, there might still be fragments of his or her stories that span generations.\n\nOf the many gripping examples of this in “Springsteen on Broadway,” the one that stands out most memorably is the sprawling story he tells before playing his iconic (and often misconstrued song) “Born in the U.S.A.” The story centers on Walter Cichon, who was the frontman for the Motifs, a band Springsteen still considers one of the best rock ’n’ roll bands from the Jersey Shore. In the ’60s, the Motifs played weekend shows to rooms packed with teenage admirers. Cichon wore his hair long and sported pointy black boots. When he performed, he would shake out his hair and send beads of sweat flying past the stage lights. For anyone who has ever lived in any town where a band was on the verge of “making it,” you know the epiphany: This band is too good to be here, in this place, in this moment. That was the Motifs, with their frantic and warbly guitars laid below Cichon’s howling vocals.\n\nWalter Cichon was drafted when he was 21 and didn’t come back from Vietnam. He went missing in action in 1968.\n\nOn Broadway, Bruce Springsteen performs “Born in the U.S.A.” largely in silence. The song is half-spoken, half-sung, Springsteen’s voice rough and breaking beneath the decades of labor it has done — labor rendered romantic through writing and performance. What has always been true about the career of Bruce Springsteen is that he’s most entertaining when backed by his pals, but he’s most earnest when he’s alone. To hear “Born in the U.S.A.” presented without an instrument is to hear the strain that pushes toward the edge of anger, that hovering sentiment that was lost in the original’s bombastic wall of sound and perhaps camouflaged by its imagery. At the time of the song’s release, Springsteen was a young, attractive, muscular man who appeared midjump in front of an American flag on the single’s cover. From a zoomed-out perspective — a white musician writing about the intricacies of labor — it could seem as if he represented everything that a particular America would be proud of. The misreading of the original song was not purely accidental: Its volume and fanfare meant that it sounded (and still sounds) good bursting out of speakers while fireworks explode in the sky, and its loudest words in the chorus are about land and birthright. But with the drums and bursts of keyboards gone, the relentlessly hollow hope of the song is gone, too. On the isolated stage of a theater, all that’s left is knowing that the singer has loved and dreamed and lost in a country sometimes not worth loving and dreaming and losing in.\n\nIn his long monologue introducing “Born in the U.S.A.” on Broadway, Springsteen talks about “the blood and the confusion and the pride and the shame and the grace that comes with birthplace,” and I get it. There are some of us who didn’t ask to be born in our particular here, and there are some of us who didn’t ask to come to this particular here, but to be in wherever your here is means that you might be compelled to both fight for it and forgive it. On Broadway, Springsteen mentions something else: He tells the story of him and two of his friends being summoned to the selective-service office, as a prelude to being sent to Vietnam — for what, he says, “we were sure was going to be our funeral.” They did everything they could to get out of being drafted, and succeeded. He ends the story by exhaling softly and pausing before telling the audience: “I do sometimes wonder who went in my place. Because somebody did.”\n\nI imagine that’s it. To live a long enough life in a place founded, in part, on violence and volatility is to know that long life may depend on someone else walking through a door you wanted no part of. Or to know that the heroes from your hometown never made it out because war got to them first. Stripped to its barest bones, “Born in the U.S.A.” asks a listener to recognize that human survival is not something we can count on. The song matters now in a different way than it did in 1984, largely because of the artist behind it: Springsteen, trying to wrestle not only with the song’s current legacy but also with how it might be co-opted decades from now, when he won’t be around to make sure people understand the ache behind the song’s fury.\n\nHanif Abdurraqib is a poet, an essayist and a cultural critic in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nRead more\n\nLast year, in a span of months, Meek Mill went from solitary confinement in a Pennsylvania prison to releasing an album that debuted at No.1 on the Billboard chart. It’s a paradoxical narrative that has defined the Philadelphia rapper since his teenage years, when he landed both a record deal and criminal convictions on drug and gun charges. Sentenced at 21 to prison and years of probation, the 31-year-old rapper has spent his entire adult life in and out of courts and prison, often for noncriminal violations like not adequately reporting his travel plans.\n\nBut 2018 proved transformative. New scrutiny of the judge overseeing his probation, and of the initial case — he has always maintained that the police made up charges — roused public support from powerful people, including Jay-Z, Philadelphia’s district attorney and the Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin. With tour dates for his “Championships” album selling out, Mill has become a leading voice on the failings of the criminal-justice system. Along with writing an op-ed for The New York Times and appearing on national news shows, the rapper helped start the Reform Alliance, an organization dedicated to getting one million Americans out of the prison system.\n\nHow long did you work on the album? Probably eight months. Since I came out.\n\nI usually take about eight months to produce a piece as well. Then there’s panic — you’ve gone over it so many times, you can’t even tell anymore if it’s good or not. I feel the same way. Going through the music so much, not even knowing if it’s good anymore — I done heard it at least a thousand times, trying to analyze and look at it so many ways.\n\nAt the end of “Championships,” you say we had to beat the streets, beat racism, beat poverty. So much of what you write is sociological, a study of the neighborhood. Your being from Philadelphia made me think about W.E.B. Du Bois in 1899 — he did a study called “The Philadelphia Negro.” Yeah, I read pieces of it in prison. One of the older guys probably gave it to me.\n\nThen you know what I’m talking about. This was known as the first sociological study of black Americans in the country. He was trying to understand why black folks lived the way they lived. And the social problems he identified — poverty, crime, illiteracy, white discrimination — are the exact same things you talk about 120 years later. That was my life coming up, so it was normal. I always tell people, I’ve been living the life I’m living now for the last eight years, but I’ve been living in the ghetto for 23. Things we’ve been traumatized by our whole lives — we have a right to talk about it.\n\nYou refer to school a couple of times on this album — your mom praying you’d go to Yale, or going to a school with bullet holes in the lockers. You said you were on the honor roll? I used to be, until, like, third grade. There was another book I got in prison, about black kids — the fourth grade, things go wrong and grades start to decline. That was my life. Mine was because I moved to a different neighborhood, rougher than the one I came from.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes from James Baldwin is “The kids had been told that they weren’t worth [expletive], and everything they saw around them proved it.” What did your schools say about what society thought of you? We used to have teachers say, “Oh, you’re probably going to be dead or in jail, or you’re probably going to be a failure.” I had some good teachers, too, but it was rough in our schools.\n\nI feel like that’s a message we start telling black boys very early: You’re going to be dead or in jail. I know we’re trying to warn them, but it also seems as if you’re dictating their future. Yeah, but I never believed that. I used to say I was going to be a normal story of the ghetto. But if you have your mom telling you you’re going to be a great person and then your teachers talk to you like that — you wouldn’t really want to listen to that person anymore.\n\nWas school easy for you? Pretty easy. I didn’t have to study to pass my tests. Even if I ran the hallways, I would still be fairly good. Later on, when I really stopped trying, I was put in disciplinary schools. It was like a jail. You get strip-searched before you go in, fingerprinted every day. One day I just climbed over the gate and left.\n\nIt was a public school organized like a jail? In other words, it was early conditioning for what everybody assumed your future was going to be. When I finally went to jail, I already knew everybody. Everybody I went to school with was in the jail.\n\nWhat were you put in that school for? Fighting and acting up. I said in one of my raps, I was acting up in school because I thought it was cool, but really I was hurt. Your mom’s at work, your dad’s in the graveyard, you’re not really getting nurtured, and I guess you just resort to acting up.\n\nYou have a song called “Trauma,” which talks about that, the PTSD young people in these neighborhoods are dealing with. But that’s why I love that Baldwin quote — everything about the environment tells these kids they’re nothing, right? But when they react in what’s actually a very normal way, we want to break them down. You don’t value yourself because you grow up not being valued. What type of motivation do you get if your mom is on drugs? Your self-esteem is automatically just low. Some people have the determination to shoot to the top. But, you know, that’s not normal — for just a regular kid to have the determination to do that.\n\nI always say anger is an easier emotion to deal with than pain. Yeah. That’s why I say, you come through neighborhoods and you see kids with their faces all balled up or looking angry? They’re probably really angry. His mom is probably really on drugs, and he probably really don’t have food in the house, and his dad is probably really dead. They hurt, they torn, they scarred. It’s nothing that words can really fix. “Why is this kid always angry?” Well, he’s been through something.\n\nWho’s the first black writer you ever read? I’d never be able to determine who was black and white when I was reading back then. I don’t know the first. “The New Jim Crow” — that’s a black writer?\n\nYes. Michelle Alexander. When you were in high school, you weren’t exposed to black literature, black writers? I went to public school. The books were falling apart. They probably still got the same books from when I was in school. We didn’t get no black literature in public school.\n\nI read a lot as a child, mostly because I was grounded all the time. Then we had a black-studies course in high school, and I became obsessed with black history because it felt like, for the first time, the world made sense. You would see your community and how people lived, and they would tell you we just did not want better. But I could see how hard people worked, and they still could not get ahead. Studying history calmed me. The most I ever read was in prison. There’s nothing to do, so you turn to books. Reading made me process the system. Sometimes I thought it was just millions of black people, and Spanish — when you come to prison, it’s black and Spanish. Looking deeper, and seeing the way some of those things are broken down in “The New Jim Crow,” it made me really wonder. Because I am already a conspiracy theorist.\n\nI don’t understand how you can be black and not be a conspiracy theorist. I was doing a show on CNN, and a guy was like, “Why are you saying the system is similar to slavery?” It kind of caught me off guard, and I couldn’t really answer. But you’ve got people working for eight cents in here. You’re feeding people the [expletive] you would feed slaves. You’ve got people cuffed up, shackled from top to bottom. People locked in the basement for 23 hours a day, being beat by the officers. It’s basically the same. And one of the amendments says that when you’re under custody of the government, you can be treated like a slave.\n\nYes, the 13th. So you were first arrested — for the original charge — at 19? My first arrest was actually going to school. In sixth or seventh grade. I was suspended, and I didn’t want to tell my mom, so I tried to hang out in the hallways. I got caught and went to jail for trespassing. My mom had to come get me.\n\nWhat’s the charge you’re still on probation for? Selling crack. This is to my dad’s soul: I wasn’t selling crack when they locked me up for it. When I got back, I had to get back in the street and start really selling weed to get me a lawyer, because everyone who had a public defender got crucified. My mug shot has my face swollen, both sides of my face beat up. I was charged with fracturing the cop’s hand. You know how his hand got fractured?\n\nYeah, punching you. Yeah. He charged me for him punching my face. They said I pointed a gun at them. If somebody can sit there and tell you the story of how they didn’t point a gun at cops, nine times out of 10, it’s true. It’s not too many people who can make it out of pointing a gun at a couple cops.\n\nI remember one time, this judge said, “I don’t give people three to six months; I give people three to six years” — for something like a first-time weed charge. That always stuck with me. That’s not O.K. I mean, you can’t shoot nobody and expect to be getting chances. But if you were on probation and began smoking weed? People in the ’hood are going through real [expletive]. I barely sleep from so much trauma. Sometimes you just want to smoke and go to sleep.\n\nAnd you’ve got to think about it — you’ve got 18-, 19-year-old kids, sending them to a whole building full of rapists, killers. They put you in a cell with a 45-year-old man who got a life sentence, who’s a killer. This is your dad right here. He’s going to raise you. He’s going to show you how to clean the toilet, how to carry yourself. They’re not thinking about that. They’re just giving this guy three years to get taught this mentality.\n\nMy mom was a probation officer. She would tell me how certain officers would wait outside the person’s house, trying to catch them. And it’s for noncriminal things, right? The average person, I think, believes that people are being violated because they’re doing criminal activity. But I’ve had family and friends incarcerated, and part of their probation would be that they couldn’t drive. In a place with no public transit, they would drive to work and get violated. You can’t associate with known felons, but that means you can’t be around your family members or go to the barbershop. You can’t associate with felons when you just came from prison, with a thousand felons in your face every day. That makes no sense. One time the judge was like, “This is lenient,” and in my head — I couldn’t say this — I was like, Who are you to even say this is lenient? If you gave me three months, that is not lenient. I’m going to lose my job, lose the lease on my house. She made it a condition that I couldn’t even rap.\n\nIn prison, you were 23-and-1, right? Isolated all but one hour a day? I can’t even imagine what that’s like. Nobody can. I was just talking to 21 Savage in prison, and I was like, This is the closest you’ve ever been to God in a room like this. The last time I was on 23-and-1, my lawyer came to see me, and I was like, “Did I go crazy and just don’t know I went crazy?” I started writing everything I was feeling, but when I went back and looked at it, I was spelling everything wrong, things I know how to spell. I kept blacking out in the middle of the day — not passing out, but like falling asleep. I was counting the birds on the wire: This bird’s gonna fly off in 10, 9, 8, 7. The bird don’t fly off, start over. Twenty-three and a half hours a day. Come out to take a shower, back to your cell. And I wasn’t in there for punishment — they had me on a mental block because I’m a celebrity, and they didn’t have anywhere to put me. Every time I got out, I’m like, yeah, I’m not the same no more.\n\nYou’ve become the face of criminal-justice problems. When did you realize that you had a platform, and that you should use it to advocate for more than yourself? When I saw the support people gave me. Everybody was saying “Free Meek,” but it was really like saying “Free everybody who goes through these conditions.” It surprised me, because I’ve been in and out of prison for these types of things for the past 11 years, and people were just like: “Aw, he’s stupid. He keeps going to jail.” I am not stupid. It’s just normal mistakes. I caught one case at the age of 19. I am 31. I have never been back to prison for a crime.\n\nYou’re working with some powerful people in the Reform Alliance. Jay-Z, Michael Rubin, Robert Kraft, Clara Wu Tsai. Basically all billionaires except me. Robert Kraft saw me in prison, and he was like, How are you still smiling? He was like, If that was me, I would be depressed, mad, angry.\n\nYou’re not? You can’t sleep. Yeah, but that comes from my environment. Coming from seeing violence, people robbed, people murdered, you heard gunshots every night — couldn’t sleep.\n\nSo how do you deal with the trauma? I just override it. I don’t know. Rapping is one of my therapies. I’ve never been a dweller to sit back and be sad about something. The saddest thing I can think about is Lil Snupe, an artist I had signed, got killed at 18 by a grown man. That bothered me a lot for two years, but I suppressed it and never really addressed it. Then one day, I started realizing that had damaged me, and I thought about it a lot.\n\nDo you actually think Reform Alliance can change the system? I think it’s a possibility we can make a change. In Pennsylvania, they’re talking about changing the laws of probation already, to where the cap is five years. That will be a big win for a lot of kids who will enter the system and probably would have gotten 10 to 20.\n\nAfter everything, you’re still hopeful. Yeah. Hell, yeah. I got a mean team with me. I don’t think none of us lose in anything we do.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones is a staff writer for the magazine.\n\nDevin Yalkin is a photographer from New York who has covered a range of subjects for the magazine, including dirt-track racing, Trump rallies and basketball on Montana’s Flathead Indian Reservation.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited.\n\nRead more\n\nA couple of weeks before she would step onstage to accept the Grammy for Album of the Year, Kacey Musgraves was under the covers in the bedroom at the back of her tour bus, pondering the nature of the universe. She had a little unexpected time on her hands. A show in Chicago had been canceled, thanks to the polar freeze that had descended over the Midwest, leaving her stuck in the middle of a vast tundra with a buildup of tour adrenaline and nowhere to put it. She watched some “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” read a little “The Catcher in the Rye” and then lost herself down her favorite YouTube rabbit hole, a video genre in which someone mashes up tweedy old-school physics lectures with wonky electro beats. “It’s like if Daft Punk went totally science,” she says, “and I’m here for that.”\n\nLater, she would stand in a diaphanous scarlet Valentino dress at the Grammys, giving a speech that could, given her tone and reputation, be read as subtly anti-authoritarian. “Life is pretty tumultuous right now for all of us,” she told the crowd. “I feel like, because of that, art is really thriving.” Musgraves is well known for her support of the L.G.B.T. community, her unabashed love of weed and her ability to turn a cutting phrase in her perfect Texas twang — particularly when she’s writing about the shackles of social convention. She started writing her winning album, “Golden Hour,” early in 2016, when Donald Trump was still assigning stinging nicknames to his Republican primary opponents, and began recording it just after Trump’s inauguration. She has tweeted in support of the Women’s March and in disdain of Eric Trump’s family-branded Christmas ornaments. She speaks with pride about the stack of detention slips her mother still keeps from her daughter’s time in the Mineola, Tex., school system: “I was always getting in trouble for, like, insubordination.” Add all that to the nose piercing that, as she famously sings on the rapturous single “Slow Burn,” made her grandmother cry, and you might expect her album to be a bit of a call to arms, a middle finger to a broken world.\n\nNot so much. “I just got tripped out one day,” she says, musing on her inspiration for the album. “Thinking, Whoa, wait, we live in this world that seems so mundane, but at the same time that I’m sitting here, there’s things that are glowing in the ocean and eating each other — and there’s also northern lights and shooting stars and plants that grow and literally heal people.” She paused for breath. “And it’s all happening around us, you know?” Falling for the man who is now her husband — the singer and songwriter Ruston Kelly — was another part of the album’s genesis. “It’s sort of a love song to him,” she says, “but also to nature, the human race, Earth and why we’re here. We don’t know, and I kind of love it.”\n\nIn other words, this wry firebrand’s big statement on the state of the world — at a time when so many of the issues she has become famous writing about, like feminism and gay rights, are making daily headlines — is a metaphysical country-pop record more inspired by Carl Sagan than Willie Nelson. And just so we’re clear, Musgraves was on acid only part of the time. “It’s not like I was tripping my face off every day,” she clarifies. (After she told reporters that psychedelics influenced a couple of songs, including “Slow Burn,” it was all anyone wanted to talk about.) “It has only been a couple times. And very responsibly! Enough to be able to get outside of yourself and see a different perspective or point of view.”\n\nWhat makes Musgraves such a resonant figure right now, in fact, is the way her response to a dark, anxious moment in human history is to move willfully closer to lightness, to stillness, toward the possibility of a world that comes in more colors than red or blue. When she talks about art thriving in this climate, she means it — just not in the same sense as, say, angry punks railing against the Reagan administration. What she means is that right now, the best rebellion involves turning off the hate and making space for hope. Or, as she puts it: “The [expletive] storm won’t last forever, and I want to make music that does.”\n\n[Watch Kacey Musgraves turn country music psychadelic.]\n\nI caught up with Musgraves in Wisconsin, on the tail end of January’s alarming deep freeze, which had temperatures in the upper Midwest dropping as low as minus 40. (I missed her in Chicago, where everyone was trapped inside, the streets vacant apart from the odd extreme-weather junkie taking photographs of ice floes.) Far from Valentino, she was, for the moment, in sweaty Victoria’s Secret workout tights and a fluorescent-green beanie, sitting straddle-style on the floor of the bar at a Madison venue called the Sylvee, having just finished a workout via Skype with Erin Oprea, a trainer to many of Nashville’s stars.\n\n“O.K., so this is the one I put on my story yesterday,” she said, finding a clip she had posted to Instagram and showing me her phone. It was something called Symphony of Science’s “Quantum World,” a favorite among those space-disco physics videos. “Featuring Neil DeGrasse Tyson,” she chuckled, reading from the chyron at the bottom of a related clip. I had indeed seen her Instagramming this kind of mysterious, late-night Discovery Channel-type stuff — the sort of thing teenagers once saw at the IMAX theater on a field trip after getting stoned. How did she get into it? “Oh, who knows, it was years ago,” she replied, then sang happily along to a remix that showed Morgan Freeman superimposed on a colorful tunnel of celestial light. One of the scientists’ 1970s professorial look, she pointed out, was “literally like what the band wears” in her stage show.\n\nWhen Musgraves was 18 and a contestant on the reality show “Nashville Star” — she placed seventh — she had to fill out a getting-to-know-the-contenders C.V. Under the category of “dream vacation,” she listed “staying in a huge log cabin in the mountains, riding horses, hunting and four-wheeling with my friends.” The “craziest” thing she’d ever done? “Hunting for Bigfoot deep in the woods of East Texas. ... We didn’t get him.” That version of Musgraves — the one who cited Jack in the Box egg rolls and beer as her favorite foods — still appears at every show, even when she’s dressed like Bianca Jagger heading to Studio 54. She’s the one leading the ritual preshow group shot of tequila, taken from tiny cactus-shaped glasses she and her band have long been toting from show to show. And she’s the one hanging with me on the floor of a bar in Wisconsin, looking at videos by a user with the handle “melodysheep.”\n\nAnd yet even in her early years, when Musgraves looked more the part of your average Nashville aspirant, in cowboy boots and blond highlights, there was always a kind of poise, an innate regality that set her apart. This, perhaps, is the other side of her East Texas grit — the one that manifests less as yee-haw joy and more as D.I.Y. conviction. “When it comes to art, I will not bend,” she says. “I won’t.”\n\nMusgraves grew up in Golden, Tex., a town so small it doesn’t even have an elementary school. “A few hundred people,” she guesses, is the total population. It’s about 90 minutes from Dallas, and about six or seven miles outside Mineola, where Musgraves and her sister, Kelly Christine Sutton — a photographer, who shot the “Golden Hour” cover — went to school, and where their parents had a small printing shop. “Even at a young age,” Sutton says, “I always knew my sister would be known for her music. And not really on anyone else’s timeline. She would make it happen on her own terms.” It’s their parents’ model of small-town independence, Musgraves figures, that gave her a tend-your-own-garden will. “A large part of who I am comes from the fact that I never saw my parents have bosses,” she says. “They’ve never answered to anyone but themselves. And not in a baller way — like very small-business, check-to-check kind of a thing. But they made all their own decisions.”\n\nGrowing up, she had a Spice Girls poster in her room — Ginger, with her wild tattoo, made a strong impression — and listened to emo rock bands like the Used and Dashboard Confessional. But that wasn’t the sort of music she played. “I was part of this kids’ group called the Buckaroos that would meet every month in the Fort Worth Stockyards and would dress up in cowboy clothing and stroll the stockyards and learn instruments,” she recalls. “There were mentors there who kind of encourage kids to learn this old stuff.” By 9, she was writing her own songs and playing guitar; by 12, she was singing Western swing and yodeling at festivals on the weekends. Bookings and press kits were handled by her grandmother — the same one who later cried when Musgraves pierced her nose, and who referred to “It Is What It Is,” the singer’s melancholic ode to casual sex, as “the slut song.” “She’s a hoot,” Musgraves says. “She was wheeling and dealing.”\n\nThere was, of course, the requisite period in which a teenage Musgraves turned her back on the whole cowgirl thing. “I was like, Dude, none of my friends think this is cool. If they saw me I’d be superembarrassed. I’m yodeling, you know what I mean?” She rebelled — for a second. “I chopped off all my hair and was like: Suck on that! Now I can’t wear a cowboy hat, Mom!” (“You would not believe how upset my family was,” Sutton remembers.) But this rebellion turned out to be short-lived. By the time Musgraves moved full time to Nashville, at 19, she had realized “nobody really in the country world was embracing the hard-core roots of the genre.” But she had come to worship John Prine and Loretta Lynn — big-hearted, sharp-tongued, storytelling pillars of country’s outlaw roots who had risen up in the ’70s by staging their own insurgency against the bubble-gumming-up of the genre. “I randomly already had this superknowledge about all the old songs that came before me, and that style, the Western fashion,” Musgraves says. “I was like: I’m going to bring it back. I want to mix that in with something modern.” Prine himself is now one of her many admirers; he compares her to “a goofy Cinderella.” “She has a certain honesty to her voice,” he says. “She’s breaking down barriers.”\n\nThere’s a famous tale about Kacey Musgraves’s first big showcase performance for the Country Radio Seminar. This is a big-deal event in the business; its attendees are queen-makers in an industry in which success is still determined by access to radio airwaves. The story of her 2013 debut there smacks of a plotline on “Nashville” — appropriate, given that she co-wrote “Undermine,” one of the hits to emerge from the juggernaut TV series. You can easily picture the kind of episode Musgraves’s performance might have inspired. A young woman takes the stage at the legendary Ryman Auditorium, the so-called Mother Church of country, about to play the song that could make or break her career. We learn that she’s being hyped — thanks to her preternatural songwriting skills, good looks and the already-feverish crossover response to her first single, “Merry Go Round” — as the Veronica to Taylor Swift’s Betty: a sassier but potentially just as marketable product. As is the industry’s way, the corporate powers would like this rising phenom to be herself, but only within reason. They’d prefer she refrain from playing what will become her third single — the one with the lines about smoking joints and kissing girls — until after she can already be heard in every Walgreens in America. But the woman steps up to the microphone, leans into it a little and speaks: “I’m kind of a big believer in people doing whatever the hell they want to do, because I feel like society is probably going to have an opinion either way.” Then she starts strumming “Follow Your Arrow.” As she delivers its opening line — “If you save yourself for marriage, you’re a bore/If you don’t save yourself for marriage you’re a horr-” — the crowd gasps. Then she finishes — “-ible person” — and the audience laughs. A star is born.\n\nIt’s easy to wonder where Musgraves got the nerve. It’s one thing to admire your parents’ entrepreneurial spirit, and another to hold your own amid the chaos and pressure of the starmaking machine. For Musgraves, performing alongside Dolly Parton at the Grammys, winning Album of the Year, presenting an award at the Oscars — all of this is unequivocally her dream. But it’s also something she believes she could live without, and remembering this has become a kind of daily meditation, especially as the scope of her fame has increased. “I don’t get high off my own supply, you know?” she says, mentioning, by way of inspiration, Willie Nelson’s ability to welcome “Republicans, rappers, presidents, my grandpa, your grandpa, our hipster friends, me” without treating anyone as superior to anyone else. “You can be proud of yourself and excited for what you’re doing, and you could even really have a high level of confidence, without being a D-bag.”\n\nIn Musgraves’s mind, she made it the minute she signed her first songwriting deal, back in 2009, penning tunes that would be sold around Nashville to other performers. That was the day she realized she would never again have to work a job in which she dressed up as Disney characters for children’s birthday parties, one of many day gigs she had endured. “For the next few years,” she says, “I was like: Really? Wait, I can use my brain, sit on my ass and make a living?” When her current label first made her an offer to record as an artist, Musgraves turned it down; she was having a perfectly good time as a writer. She also knew she didn’t have real access to her own voice yet. “Those songs were fine for other artists,” she says. “Maybe they could be popular on the radio or something, but they’re not very me.”\n\nBy the time Musgraves eventually located her particular voice, it was already honed to a sharp edge. Her first hit, “Merry Go Round,” from 2012, is packed with the kind of mordant wordplay she’d be known for, conjuring a “same trailer, different park” world where people marry out of boredom and settle “just like dust” into small-town lives: “Mama’s hooked on Mary Kay, brother’s hooked on Mary Jane, Daddy’s hooked on Mary two doors down.” But after two albums and multiple world tours, Musgraves felt worn out by her own verbal cleverness. “Everyone hopefully knows I can flip a phrase by now, and I like that,” she says. “But I don’t want bumper-sticker songs.” It also concerned Musgraves that the refreshing directness with which she had addressed social issues might start to feel heavy-handed, even ideologically gimmicky. She is, as she puts it diplomatically, “noticing things about the world that I’m not happy with.” But when she started working on “Golden Hour,” it no longer felt right to address them directly. “Everyone that’s listened to any of my music knows exactly how I feel,” she says. “This record does kind of nod to some of the social and political things that are going on, but it’s just doing it in a different way. It’s not as linear.”\n\nBack on her bus, in Wisconsin, after playing to a couple thousand freezing fans who arrived lit and ready to party, Musgraves decompressed again. Gone was the collection of products the singer uses to transform herself from the kind of girl her sister remembers Musgraves sometimes presented as in high school — “Converse, Dickies and black eyeliner” — to the flamboyantly feminine star who shares the stage with “RuPaul’s Drag Race” contestants. (“I have thought, Am I just doing this because it’s expected, or do I actually enjoy it?” Musgraves said to me earlier, while spraying her face with a mist of foundation. “And it’s like: No! I enjoy it!”) Now she was in slippers and a kind of housecoat, which I mentioned made her look approximately like my grandmother. “Let’s just say I also have a towel warmer,” she replied. She puttered around her kitchen, making mugs of ginger tea. Then she pointed out where the bus’s temperature controls were, and the cabinet where she keeps the melatonin gummies, and said good night.\n\nTucked away with her tasteful crystal collection in the earth-toned bedroom in the back of the bus — the first she has ever had, after touring for years alongside “15 other people” — there were any number of things might have turned her attention to. She could have looked at specs for the adult coloring book she’s designing with her mother, or maybe FaceTimed with her husband, Ruston Kelly, also on tour somewhere in the frozen Midwest. She might have scrolled through the looks her stylist had just sent through for the Grammys; she was still searching for something just right to match Dolly Parton. Or there was Musgrave’s common insomnia treatment, shopping on eBay: “I get down a little rabbit hole,” she told me, “ordering old toys that they don’t make anymore. Like dolls from the ’80s or ’90s. If I ever have a girl, it could be cute to give her P.J. Sparkles, or Makeup Beauty, or whatever, you know?” They would all be shipped to Nashville, where they’d be waiting for her when she got home — whenever that was.\n\n“I mean, my 2020 is planned out,” she told me earlier. “I’m going to be putting another record out. I haven’t made that yet, so I need to write that and make that. Lots to do.” It is imposing, you’d guess, to have an album scheduled for release that you haven’t begun to record. “It’s scary,” she allowed. “You worry that the muse is not going to visit you again.” She reached for her lip gloss. “There’s no banking on it. So it’s odd that there’s an entire industry banking on it.” She’s not worried, though. Her latest idea showed up a few weeks ago — a low-key, “kind of like Bill Withers meets Sade” track she’s calling, for the moment, “Good Wife.” She likes its ease, she says: “It’s not trying too hard.”\n\nLizzy Goodman is a journalist and the author of “Meet Me in the Bathroom,” an oral history of music in New York City from 2001 to 2011.\n\nDevin Yalkin is a photographer from New York.\n\nRead more\n\nThe first time I saw the video for Tekashi 6ix9ine’s “Gummo,” I felt a little bit like Rip Van Winkle wandering down from the Catskills. What in the world happened here? I was only gone for an hour! Some elements were familiar (a crew of guys in front of a brownstone, drinking and mugging for the camera), and some were menacing (the number of red bandannas and guns on display), but it was the man at the center of the video who startled me most; he seemed almost precision-engineered to make people feel old.\n\nHe was screaming himself hoarse about robbing and shooting people, over a haunting, spare beat, but I’d heard that before — it was his appearance that shocked me. In an era when most young rappers have a couple of face tattoos, 6ix9ine had the number 69 inked above his right eye in 72-point type. He had the same number spelled out in cursive over his left eye. It was everywhere on his body. His scraggly hair was dyed ROYGBIV, and he had a grill to match. He looked like one of those frogs you’re not supposed to touch.\n\nWithin about a year, he would be in federal custody, a 22-year-old facing life in prison for a number of charges, including racketeering and attempted murder. Law enforcement accused 6ix9ine and others in his circle of being members of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods and, under the RICO Act, charged them with participating in shootings and robberies all over New York City. Normally this sort of arrest leads to an outcry about literal-minded police overreach. Not this time. People generally seemed pleased to see the rapper in cuffs.\n\nThis was partly because 6ix9ine was universally reviled by music critics and journalists, on account of a crime he committed before he became famous: In 2015, he pleaded guilty to the use of a minor in a sexual performance, for having filmed and shared on social media a video of a girl performing oral sex on his friend. But it was also because he had spent the past year living the life of a Looney Tunes character: courting danger, narrowly escaping it, then taunting his foes. This genuinely incredible run netted him more than 150 stories on TMZ: gang members in San Antonio threatening his life; a shootout at the Barclays Center; shots fired at a video shoot in Brooklyn; more shots fired at a Beverly Hills video set. Through it all, he posted on Instagram, usually wearing red, often handling bricks of cash, sometimes clutching extremely illegal-looking guns, but never betraying an ounce of concern for his well-being.\n\n[More on the rapid rise and sudden fall of Tekashi 6ix9ine.]\n\nCultivating this sort of personal mythology is not at all new; it dates back to the earliest days of gangsta rap. Ever since Eazy-E bankrolled NWA with drug money, a certain proximity to criminality has been expected of certain rappers. If your music purports to document life on the other side of the law, then you better know what you’re talking about. Not long ago, rappers had just a few limited channels through which to prove that they did: lyrics, album art and, if they were famous enough, music videos. Like Old Testament gods, they willed whole universes into being through their words.\n\nNow they have social media. Case in point: On “Stoopid,” which came out last fall, 6ix9ine insults two rappers he was feuding with at the time, but unless you were listening for it, you probably wouldn’t have noticed. Much more memorable were the Instagram videos he made to antagonize the two; in one he took his rival’s former girlfriend and mother of his child out shopping.\n\nThis sort of online mythmaking is second nature to SoundCloud rappers, so called for the streaming service that birthed the scene. SoundCloud rap is not characterized by a particular sound so much as its anarchic energy — the face tattoos, the prescription drugs, the orthographically complex handles. This scene has been alarmingly fecund and seems to accelerate evolution in disturbing directions, a little like Lake Springfield on “The Simpsons.” Even within this ecosystem, 6ix9ine stood out like a chumbox thumbnail — is he ... real?\n\nThe problem, for 6ix9ine, was that a big part of his adopted persona, both on Instagram and in his music, involved being a member of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods. According to a Rolling Stone profile that came out after his arrest in November, this was essentially an act: Danny Hernandez, in the years leading up to his fame, had been a trollish and goofy Bushwick deli employee; his industry blacklisting had pushed him into the hands of an apparently gang-affiliated manager, who also provided him with a new edge. 6ix9ine is far from the only rapper to have ever made dubious claims to being a Blood, but Instagram has a way of making even the most absurd feints real. Maybe the whole thing really was a put-on, but also, he really did it. The Rolling Stone article recounts how, at his arraignment, the presiding judge asked the prosecution how it knew Hernandez was at real-life crime scenes. “The answer was often simple: Hernandez had posted about it on Instagram.”\n\nA liminal space has always existed between rappers and their personas. Sometimes it’s as thin as a fig leaf, but even then it’s essential, both legally and morally. The gap between 6ix9ine and Danny Hernandez was considerably wider, but he snapped it shut with his phone, merging fantasy with reality through a front-facing camera. Once intertwined on a criminal indictment, the two aren’t easily unwound. It was reported in February that 6ix9ine, who pleaded guilty, agreed to help prosecutors in their case against his co-defendants, hoping for leniency: a reduced sentence and possibly witness protection. But helping 6ix9ine disappear into some corner of America might prove difficult, and not just because of the tattoos.\n\nWilly Staley is a story editor for the magazine.\n\nRead more\n\nIn 1993, the Swedish singer-songwriter Robyn turned 14 and finished middle school; then she signed a record deal. She has been making music ever since, starting with her 1995 debut album, “Robyn Is Here,” which netted her two Billboard Hot 100 singles. Her 2005 album, “Robyn,” cemented her as a beloved, idiosyncratic pop star and earned her a Grammy nomination. She released a trilogy of mini-albums in 2010, which included some of her biggest hits — “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend.” Now, after a long gestation period, she has returned with a new album and single, “Honey.”\n\nYou’ve described the making of this song as searching for a feeling. A feeling of healing from sadness and wanting to share that with the world and with myself — a sense of self-love, excitement, some kind of peace of mind. Like when your strength is coming back. I wanted to describe this feeling like when you’re super close to someone else’s skin, or when you’re falling asleep, or when you’ve taken a drug that’s starting to kick in — sensations that are pleasurable, where your body is reacting to something outside of you.\n\nI felt naïve because I thought it was about self-discovery, but a friend said, “No, it’s about oral sex!” It could be about oral sex, sure! Intimacy, definitely, but it could be with yourself. It doesn’t have to do with another person. In a way I think your analysis is probably the best one, because isn’t oral sex self-discovery? Any experience you have that will give you a new point in your scale of emotions will make any other experience richer because you have a new point of reference.\n\nMaybe it’s about elevating self-care to the level of eroticism? Not reserving that deep pleasure for a sexual sensation, but something you could experience day to day. Exactly! That’s exactly it. It’s like approaching life as if you’re seducing it. As if you’re seducing yourself, or the other person, or your work, or whatever. Intimacy in every little thing.\n\nHow do you approach life as if you’re seducing it? I feel like I have to work for it every day. It’s like starting a little fire: You have to be so careful with it, not force it. You get it going and then you can use it and tend to it and start it back up again.\n\nIs your fire well tended? Not at all. I’m not in a great place at the moment, to be honest. It’s a good conversation for me to have, a good reminder. I maybe need to go back and listen to some of my songs myself to figure this out.\n\n[How Robyn, pop’s glittery rebel, danced her way back from darkness.]\n\nYour songs are known for intermingling sadness and euphoria. But “Honey” is less triumphant than that. I don’t think life is that easy anymore. I used to believe it would all make sense if you just powered through. I really don’t feel that way anymore at all. I think it’s pragmatic — I really don’t feel pessimistic.\n\nThe idea of “self-care” can seem like a challenge. Post-recession capitalism has glorified the hustle so much. The society we live in at the moment — we didn’t really make it very good, you know? It’s really tough to take care of yourself. Self-care is difficult when you have a 9-to-5 job, and people are on Instagram projecting these images of themselves — we’re in a time where everyone’s engaged in storytelling in such an aggressive way. Stories are amazing — they’re part of what it is to be human — but you have to be aware they’re stories. That’s the problem with capitalism: It’s always trying to trick you into thinking there’s a purpose for all of this. But you can actually use a story that relates to something more real than buying yourself out of anxiety.\n\nIt’s jarring to see people turning themselves into personal brands as part of that storytelling. That’s the strange thing about being an artist. There’s always a gap between how I see myself and how other people see me. When I was younger, I felt like it was easier for me to absorb other people’s thoughts about me, and more complex to understand what was me and what was other people, and how to respond to those expectations. I’m still learning that. I’ve been more specific with my expression on this album than I’ve been able to be before, but I’m aware that that doesn’t mean that people understand me. I don’t even know if that’s the point.\n\nA lot of today’s pop is about nihilism, depression, anxiety. There’s real sadness behind your album, too. It struck me as something that’s easy for the industry to exploit. Definitely: Pop at the moment is depressing. Hip-hop is really dark. The music kids are listening to is heavy! Maybe it’s hard to be positive and optimistic at the moment, for a lot of young people — the number of voices that are trying to share this space in their brains is crazy. But maybe it’s cool that they get to explore their darkness as a collective earlier in life, because maybe it will also get them to the point where they’re letting go of it early as well.\n\nIs the industry set up for artists to be able to share their pain but protect themselves? It’s really difficult for anyone to not be exploited in our society as a whole. As an artist, you’re exposed, because you deal in emotions all the time. People want you to be vulnerable. If you think about sports — you look at it because someone’s pushing themselves to their limit. If you don’t risk anything, why would people want to see it happen?\n\nYou turn 40 this June. You could listen to “Honey” as a celebration of the richness that comes with age, and maybe aging as a woman. I think it can be that, for sure. I’m not looking forward to being 40, to getting older. I know that’s not a very mature thing to say, but it is what it is.\n\nLaura Snapes is the deputy music editor of The Guardian.\n\nDevin Yalkin is a photographer from New York.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited.\n\nRead more\n\nLast fall, Marie Davidson, a French Canadian producer of electronic music, released “Work It,” an aggressively rattling track on which she serves “kind of like an M.C./personal trainer,” exhorting listeners not to dance but to work, constantly and sweatily, seven days a week. The song became a minor anthem, and the album it came from, “Working Class Woman,” was embraced as one of the best dance records of the year.\n\nWhat sort of place were you at in your life when you wrote this song? Obviously I was working a lot. I had already toured Europe and the U.S., and I was going back to Europe to play festivals. I wanted to make a banger to play live — I just picked up my microphone and started talking. The song came out in a funny way, but the undertone is serious.\n\nI don’t think all people should work all the time. It’s sarcastic, it’s humorous, but in the joke there’s also truth. It’s why I say, toward the end, that when I say “work,” you have to work for yourself, love yourself, feed yourself. Whatever you do, whatever amount of energy you put into something, you have to do it for yourself and not to please others. Not to build this facade or this persona or achievement.\n\nDo you think people base too much of their self-worth on their work? Absolutely. We live in a society that is based on work — goals, achievement, money. Of course! It’s a real problem — workaholism, exhaustion, burnout. We’re not taught in this society — it’s not valued — to take time and just learn to love yourself. You’re taught to be strong, to look smart, to be useful. But I think you become a much more useful person if you learn how to love yourself.\n\nDo you think people who aren’t musicians are aware of how physically taxing it can be? It would be hard to know. When you look at pictures or videos, it doesn’t look like that. It looks really fun and glamorous. And it is, sometimes, for a few hours. But it’s not a glamorous job being a touring musician. I still have people come up to me after a gig or somewhere, saying: “You’re so lucky. I wish I had your life.” And I’m like: What do you mean by that? Do you think I woke up one morning and became who I am? It’s years and years of work and trial and error. It’s a real job, like being a carpenter or being a designer.\n\nPeople think of the dance floor as this freeing space. But you’re kind of pointing out that this is just another workplace. For me, at least, it is. It used to be different. When I was 16 and I started going out in Montreal, going to underground parties and raves and clubs, it was magical. But it was different: I wasn’t working. It wasn’t my job. I was going there for fun. Even if I was playing, it was special. It wasn’t in the schedule, where you just do it over and over again. That space is now a work space for me. There’s no more leisure. I’ve sacrificed that freedom for other things. Now if I want to feel something mind-blowing or magical, I have to look for it outside of club culture. The music never loses its magic, but the social thing happening at a party or something like that? No.\n\nIt sounds as though the song stemmed from your personal experience, but it feels universal. When I made it, I knew anyone could relate. Because this is the time we live in. Everything goes really fast now. People are expected to produce and achieve. It’s kind of sad, I think. There’s a rigidity in that mind-set about what you should be doing with your life. We’re ruled by capitalism, so that’s what we get. We are living comfortably, and people feel that they are free, but I don’t think that individuals are that free in society.\n\nSo how do you make art under capitalism? I don’t care. When I’m in my studio composing music, I really don’t think about that — about what is the potential of that song, where is it going to take me, what does it mean to the world. I don’t care. I never did. I don’t think about my label or my manager or anybody. My insecurities come after, when it’s time to be in the world.\n\nInterview has been condensed and edited.\n\nHazel Cills is the pop-culture reporter at Jezebel.\n\nRead more\n\nJames Blake was talking about shanzhai, a Chinese phrase that means, roughly, “knockoff,” and that stems from the time-honored tradition in Chinese art of apprentices’ mimicking their masters — “copying something until you can better it,” he said, “or if not better it, compete with it.”\n\nBlake, a Grammy-winning avant-gardist with an ear for pop, who has been playing the piano since he was about 6, has a long list of heroes whom he has studiously copied in pursuit of his own sound. Copying the virtuoso jazz-pianist Art Tatum, the protominimalist French composer Erik Satie and the midcentury gospel maestro the Rev. James Cleveland taught Blake novel ways of opening up complex chord structures and fitting them — to gorgeous, aching effect — around deceptively simple melodies. Copying singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder emboldened him to write and sing pop songs with increasing emotional candor. Copying the hip-hop producer Timbaland and the South London dubstep craftsman Mala informed Blake’s love of distorted timbres — electronic rhythms that skitter and twitch as often as they groove — and of sampling, a technique of literal copying (and cutting and pasting) so central to Blake’s practice today that, even when he isn’t sampling anyone else, he routinely samples himself. “I’ll sit at a piano, improvising” into a microphone, he explained, then search the tape for building blocks that he can pluck out and, with editing software, arrange into new compositions.\n\nBlake stands at an imposing 6-foot-6 and carries himself with the deliberateness of a man at risk of scraping his head on doorways. Early in February, in a wood-paneled rehearsal space in the Larchmont neighborhood of Los Angeles, he sat at a Prophet ’08 synthesizer opposite Rob McAndrews, a multi-instrumentalist, and Ben Assiter, a drummer, his longtime friends and touring bandmates. At their feet, black cables snaked and cloverleafed among clusters of red-, blue-, silver- and cream-colored effects pedals, like tracks connecting villages in a model-train set.\n\nBlake is from London, but three and a half years ago he began dating the British comedic actress Jameela Jamil, and when she booked a lead role on the NBC sitcom “The Good Place,” he tagged along with her to California. Now Blake led McAndrews and Assiter through a practice run of “I’ll Come Too,” a swooning new song about joining Jamil out west — about that moment when you want to follow a crush anywhere. The song comes from his fourth LP, “Assume Form,” which was released in January. “That’s a fun one to play,” he said when they finished. “I really like it. But it’s hard — I’m singing all the way through, in all these different ranges, and I don’t get a chance to breathe. When I recorded it, I broke the vocal up.”\n\nThe extent to which Blake has digested the lessons of his musical heroes is illustrated not only by his decade-spanning run of singles, EPs and albums but also by the number of pop auteurs who have collaborated with him. Frank Ocean, Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z, André 3000 and Travis Scott are among those artists who have enlisted Blake’s assistance. As an influence and a collaborator, Blake has helped shape two of the more striking trends in contemporary pop: beats that mutate over the course of a song, resisting any traditionally identifiable center, and an emotional atmosphere in which the line between hedonism and melancholy, bliss and despair comes undone.\n\nHis influence extends even to artists he hasn’t worked with directly. In 2011, I visited Drake — a pop giant whose entire musical project has been about smudging the line between hedonism and melancholy — at a converted Toronto warehouse, where he was working on his second album with his musical right hand, the producer known as 40. The room was free of decoration save for 40’s copy of Blake’s debut LP, perched on a windowsill like a talisman. Drake later sampled unreleased music of Blake’s on a single called “0 to 100/The Catch Up.” Blake, who hadn’t approved this usage, got his part removed. At the start of his career, Blake told me, he’d been a solitary, “solipsistic” bedroom producer. “I was so protective of my ideas — so militantly and obsessively protective,” he explained, that it wasn’t until years later, when “I found personal openness, for maybe the first time in my life, that I found collaborative openness, too.”\n\n“Assume Form” is an album expressly about getting out of one’s skull. Five-odd years ago, Blake suffered from a depression so severe that he considered suicide. “Assume Form” chronicles his escape from that depression, and its title track, which leads the album, plays like a statement of purpose. Blake described it to me as “a song about intimacy — about feeling like you don’t deserve intimacy and feeling like there’s no way somebody could really want it with you.” The song’s themes are sex, shame and — by the end — happiness. “It’s by far the most vulnerable, exposed song on the entire record,” Blake said. “It’s saying, If you’re comfortable with this, then the bar has been set.”\n\nBlake was two and a half weeks into rehearsals for a tour that would take him around the country and then around the world. He and his band manned a variety of instruments, mostly electronic: the Prophet ’08; a large, modular synthesizer, studded with knobs, plugs and blinking lights, which McAndrews operated; and a rubber-covered pad, nestled between cymbals and high-hats, that Assiter thwacked with drumsticks to trigger pulses and prerecorded percussive sounds. Translating and arranging Blake’s intricate studio creations for live concerts is a tricky task made trickier still by his refusal to use a laptop. “With live electronic music, I’ve seen the man-checking-emails situation so many times,” Blake said, referring to that category of lackluster performance in which artists stand unbudgingly at MacBooks, pecking at keys. “I want an audience member to see what’s happening. So if Ben is playing the kick and Rob is over here fiddling with knobs and it’s clear that what he’s doing is changing the sound, then it makes sense.”\n\nThe trio consulted a whiteboard upon which the new album’s dozen songs were listed. “Should we try ‘Assume Form?’” Assiter asked. Blake furrowed his brow. The new album’s title track is, structurally speaking, strange. As its lyrics switch between optimistic vows of commitment and confessions of insecurity, this duality is echoed in the music, which consists of two alternating piano motifs — one shimmering, the other overcast. The track began as a long, meandering improvisation from which Blake eventually sampled two disparate chunks, putting them into jarring conversation. When I asked Blake to explain the harmonic unease between these two parts, he replied: “The song essentially modulates from D major in the first section to B flat in the second, which are unrelated keys. The first section has the tonic as the bass note, which gives it this firmly rooted presence, whereas the other section has the third in the bass, which makes it feel suspended — which is when the lyrics turn to self-doubt.” He thought for a moment. “It’s quite an odd pairing. It doesn’t work, musically. But there’s a harmony there. Joni Mitchell does something similar on ‘My Old Man,’ where it goes into a minor key when she sings, ‘But when he’s gone. ...’” Complicating things further, Blake’s piano playing on the track was “loose — like, microseconds” offbeat, he said, which would add yet another layer of difficulty when it came to replicating “Assume Form” live. “Let’s try something else,” he told Assiter.\n\nBlake was raised by his father, James Litherland, a singer-songwriter and guitarist with a prog-rock pedigree, and his mother, a graphic designer and cycling instructor, in Enfield, a North London suburb. He described his life from adolescence on as largely unhappy, warm and supportive parents notwithstanding. “I had anger,” he said. “A lot of it.” As a teenager, “I had terrible acne, and now I think it was a physical presentation of how angry I was.” What angered him? “My treatment by other people,” he said. “People I’d been open with. Romantic and personal betrayals. And just a feeling of persecution. I didn’t fit in, and I resented not fitting in. I had a couple friends outside of school, so I wasn’t totally alone, but I remember years of sitting by myself at lunch. Or just going home because I didn’t want to suffer in public.” Rather than getting out this anger, he repressed it. “As a child I was very open and emotionally vulnerable and said how I felt,” he recalled. “And I sort of had that beaten out of me — not physically but emotionally. At school, and in British society, there was this sense of, if you don’t behave in the right way — if you’re not coolheaded — then people punish you for that. So that was my childhood, that reflex being stamped out of me. And it stayed with me well into my 20s.”\n\nInstead, Blake said, music “started to be my first language” and “talking about how I felt was second or third.” In 2007 he enrolled in the Popular Music program at Goldsmiths University of London. As important as his classes were the nighttime excursions he took to clubs like Plastic People and Mass. There, Blake discovered a community of producers and D.J.s — black, white, “from all parts of London,” he said — who were busy hashing out the oblong dimensions of dubstep, a new kind of dance music defined by cavernous reverb, sinister drones and deceptively complex rhythms in which growlingly deep bass lines were the primary propellant. Whereas an amped-up version of dubstep soon grew into a global phenomenon, throbbing in GoPro commercials and glitzy Las Vegas clubs, it was more subtle in its dynamics at first. Its architects assumed gnomic pseudonyms like Coki, Skream and Loefah and tended to direct attention away from themselves and toward the dance floor. “You can imagine how that appealed to me at the time,” Blake said.\n\nOn small but influential labels, he began releasing his own dubstep-inspired songs marked by his sophisticated harmonic sense. Initially he sampled other people’s vocals, but later he began singing himself. Blake eventually became comfortable enough to let his voice — a lovely, quaking baritone — ring out clearly, but at first he distorted it self-protectively: “I intentionally disembodied my voice,” he said, explaining that “there’s a safety in alteration, because it no longer has to represent the natural resonance that came out of your chest.”\n\nIn 2011, his debut album, “James Blake,” was shortlisted alongside releases by Adele and P.J. Harvey for Britain’s prestigious Mercury Prize. The album’s fans included Bjork, who attended Blake’s concerts; Thom Yorke, who dropped Blake’s songs into D.J. mixes; and Brian Eno and RZA, who collaborated with Blake on “Overgrown” (2013), which was also shortlisted for a Mercury (this time he won). Success didn’t cure Blake’s long-seething unhappiness, however. Around this time, he told me: “I was at home, playing PS4 and smoking weed, which I’d been doing a lot, and I started to have these hallucinations of black. The screen stopped being the game and started being the void. I had physical tremors and panic attacks and had to go to my room and just lie there. I started saying things like, What’s the point? What’s the point of me?”\n\nHe was having trouble writing new music, which inspired an existential dread in him. He remembered thinking, That’s my only expression as a human being, so I may as well not be here. He never took concrete steps to kill himself, he said, “but I was thinking about it a lot. Thinking about nothingness. I was just despondent. It didn’t matter to me whether I was here or not. So I was at that point. And I was caught just in time.”\n\nIt was Jamil who caught him — she, more than anyone else in his life, Blake said, helped him to break free of his self-destructive tendencies, prodding him to speak up when he grew sullen and requiring complete emotional transparency. “Nothing else will do,” he said. “In a relationship, something rots unless there’s full disclosure.” He also saw a therapist specializing in a technique known as eye-movement desensitization reprocessing, or E.M.D.R., in which a patient recalls unhappy memories while moving the eyes back and forth rapidly and tapping the hands in time — reconfiguring a relationship to past traumas, in effect, by setting them to a beat.\n\nBlake’s default mode on “Assume Form,” which he calls “essentially a pop album,” is one you might call cautious euphoria. It is also the most collaborative thing he has put out, featuring guest production from the Atlanta-based hip-hop luminary Metro Boomin and a series of duets with stars like Travis Scott, André 3000 and the breakout Catalan singer Rosalía. It would be important, Blake said, when playing these songs live, to carve out room for improvisatory runs. “After seven shows, you almost feel like you’re on rails, and I hate that,” he said. “Feeling like I don’t have a choice. With tours you’re already so tightly scheduled in all other regards, that’s when I start to get anxious, feeling like I’m locked in.”\n\nThe band moved next to a song called “Where’s the Catch,” on which Blake and André 3000 sing and rap, respectively, about what Blake characterized as “a distrust of really great things: ‘Everything’s seemingly nice — for today. But what’s around the corner?’” Rather than play André’s verse all the way through at concerts, the band intended to chop up his vocals and distribute them across the track in stuttering bursts. As they rehearsed the song, Blake’s vocals, too, were chopped up and fed through McAndrews’s synthesizer, where he warped them even further. The trio rode out the song with a jam session, adding layer after layer of noise on their way to a squalling crescendo. Blake’s vocals grew increasingly refracted and spectral, and there was something both frightening and exhilarating about the sound of the electronics swallowing him up whole.\n\nJonah Weiner is a contributing writer for the magazine.
