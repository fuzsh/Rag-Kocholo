        "text": "Carol Douglas (born April 7, 1948) is an American singer whose hit “Doctor’s Orders” (1974) was a pioneer track in the disco genre. Carol Douglas was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York. She is the daughter of Minnie Newsome, a jazz performer who has been cited as the inspiration for the Cab Calloway classic “Minnie the Moocher”; her father was a mortician. Sam Cooke was her cousin. At 10, Douglas was a contestant and winner on the game show Name That Tune and says “Ebony followed my career for the next three years.” She attended the Willard May School for professional children and afterwards the Quintanos High School for young professionals alongside Gregory Hines, Bernadette Peters, Carol Lynley, and Patty Duke. While in high school Douglas sang in a female trio named April May & June, who were signed as a management client by Little Anthony and the Imperials. She made a one-off recording in 1963 for RCA Victor, cutting the single “I Don’t Mind (Being Your Fool)” under the name Carolyn Cooke: becoming pregnant with her first son at age 15 ended RCA’s interest in promoting her. Douglas also cut several jingles for TV commercials – ” used to do voiceovers for Ideal Toys and General Mills with Bernadette Peters” – but recalls: “I never thought I would be a singer,” and for most of the 1960s Douglas pursued an acting career, appearing in an episode of The Patty Duke Show but mostly acting in theatrical productions beginning with One Tuesday Morning starring Clarice Taylor. Later Douglas understudied Jonelle Allen in the off-Broadway production of The Life of Mary McCloud Bethune and co-starred with James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson in the play Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. She married “high school sweetheart” Ken Douglas in the mid-1960s and resumed her musical career in the early 1970s touring nationally on the oldies circuit in a lineup of the Chantels featuring original front woman Arlene Smith: with these Chantels, Douglas cut the single “Some Tears Fall Dry” for Capitol. In 1974, Douglas was recruited by Midland International Records via an ad in Showbiz magazine: label vice president/record producer Eddie O’Loughlin had heard the UK hit single “Doctor’s Orders” by Sunny and was seeking a female vocalist to cut the track for the U.S. market. Douglas’s audition led to a five-year contract and her version of “Doctor’s Orders” became a hit, reaching #2 on the Billboard disco chart, #9 R&B, and #11 on the Hot 100; the single also reached #4 in France. Although O’Loughlin was credited as “Doctor’s Orders” producer the production had in fact been by Meco Monardo who was also responsible for Gloria Gaynor’s “Never Can Say Goodbye” which had ascended the pop chart at around the same time as “Doctor’s Orders”; claims have been made for each single to be the hit that broke disco into the Top 40. She made her album debut in 1975 with The Carol Douglas Album, followed in 1976 by Midnight Love Affair and in 1977 by Full Bloom. Monardo’s special expertise was missing in the production of her post-“Doctor’s Orders” tracks which maintained her as a popular club presence with negligible mainstream popularity; the follow-up single to “Doctor’s Orders”, “A Hurricane is Coming Tonight”, became her only other Hot 100 entry peaking at #81 in April 1975. Douglas hit #1 on the disco chart with “Midnight Love Affair”; the song did appear on the Top 100 chart in Cash Box magazine but only via a cover by Tony Orlando and Dawn which reached #94. (In France, Douglas’s version reached #82.) Douglas’s other recordings included “Headline News” – a minor Edwin Starr hit from 1966 written by “Doctor’s Orders” co-writer Roger Greenaway and remade by the latter track’s originator Sunny – and in the tradition of “Doctor’s Orders” Douglas cut discofied covers of several songs which were current or recent hits in the UK including ABBA’s “Dancing Queen”, “I Wanna Stay With You” by Gallagher and Lyle, and “So You Win Again” by Hot Chocolate. In 1977 she recorded the single “You Make Me Feel The Music” for the soundtrack to the film Haunted. “So You Win Again” was arranged by Michael Zager whose presence on her 1978 album release Burnin resulted in a critical (if not commercial) upswing. Burnin also featured Douglas’s version of the Bee Gees’ “Night Fever” – not a Zager arrangement – which became Douglas’s only entry in the UK Singles Chart at #66. Douglas’s 1979 album Come Into My Life was an obvious bid to recharge her club popularity; it was only six tracks long with production by Greg Carmichael who had enjoyed several disco hits with studio groups, but the single “I Got The Answer” was a mild club success. Although she did not appear in the disco-themed movie Saturday Night Fever, she was enough of a disco star that her name appears on the marquee of the disco featured in the movie. In 1981, her cover of the Three Degrees’ “My Simple Heart” was released on 20th Century Records as by then the Midland International (aka Midsong) was defunct. “My Simple Heart” was also her debut on Carrere Recordsbased in Paris where she lived for a time: in the early 1980s Carrère handled her European releases while in the US she was signed to O’Loughlin’s Next Plateau label. Her last album to date ‘I Got Your Body’, renamed ‘Love Zone’ in the US and Canada, was released in 1983 and included her last four 12″ singles from 1981 to 1983: “My Simple Heart”, “You’re Not So Hot”, “I Got Your Body”, and “Got Ya Where I Want Ya”; “You’re Not So Hot” reached #71 in France (1982). The retro-boom of the 1990s put Douglas back on the road touring and making personal appearances at a number of special events including the Martin Luther King Concert Series, Beatstock ’97, Saturday Night Fever 20th Anniversary Reunion, and the Dance Music Hall of Fame ceremony. In 2003, she returned to the recording studio when she was invited to sing backing vocals on Wanda Dee’s Goddess Is Here! CD. During this period, she also re-recorded a number of her hits. Douglas is not to be confused with (and not related to) Carl Douglas, a fellow pop one-hit wonder whose famous #1 single, “Kung Fu Fighting”, was in the Billboard Hot 100 at about the same time as “Doctor’s Orders”.

They were heavily influenced by the disco band Chic. The current incarnation of the group formed in 2018. Concept Change was initially formed in early 1979 as a studio band with a revolving cast of musicians, led by businessman and executive producer Jacques Fred Petrus, with the majority of song-writing and production carried out by Mauro Malavasi and Davide Romani.[2] The band’s dual Italian and American identity was a result of a production system in which the music, excepting the vocals, were written and recorded by Italian collaborators in studios such as Fonoprint Studios, Bologna, Italy. The backing tracks were then taken to the USA where vocals were added by American performers, before being mixed into finalized versions in major studios such as the Power Station in New York City.[2] Immediate success The band’s debut album, The Glow of Love, was released on Ray Caviano’s label, Warner/RFC Records in 1980. It was composed by a small team of writers made up of Romani, Malavasi, Paolo Gianolio (lead guitarist), Tanyayette Willoughby, Paul Slade and Wayne Garfield. The first single was the million seller “A Lover’s Holiday” featuring the ad lib stylings of Zachary Sanders, known then for his work on Schoolhouse Rock. The follow-up hits from the album, “Searching” and the title song, feature lead vocals by Luther Vandross who had yet to come to prominence. The three songs combined set the all-time record, spending nine weeks at #1 on Billboard’s Club Play Singles chart,[3] enough to make it the #1 Disco recording of the year and a strong seller in the U.S. It also made the Pop Top 40 that summer. The success of “Searching” and “The Glow of Love” exposed Luther’s voice to mainstream and eventually led to a successful solo career soon afterward. At the time The Glow of Love was released, the group also drew comparisons to another Disco act at the time, Chic, who not only were Change’s label mates at Atlantic Records, but also shared the backing vocalists as well. The follow-up album, Miracleswas released in 1981. It was created by the same collection of writers and producers as had worked on the debut album. Due to contractual differences, Vandross refused to sing lead vocals on any of the album’s tracks and was only featured on backing vocals on selected songs. After Miracles, Vandross continued to provide backup vocals for the group until 1981, when he left Change to pursue his solo career. Petrus and Malavasi signed up James ‘Crab’ Robinson to replace Vandross, owing to his ability to perform in a similar vocal style. Robinson shared vocals with Diva Gray for the album. Miracles was released to a similar level of success as the début, though it did not manage to produce a mainstream crossover hit such as “A Lover’s Holiday”. The three singles from the album, “Paradise”, “Hold Tight” and “Heaven of My Life” all reached number one on the Billboard Club Play Singles chart in 1981. Change’s 1982 album, Sharing Your Love, moved the band further away from disco and club music and into genres such as R&B and Funk. The lead single, “The Very Best in You”, was one of the foremost examples of the group’s take on R&B. The album also marked a new process in the writing of the band’s albums. The team behind the first albums contributing less, instead a wide range of songs by other writers were recorded. Overall, the album continued a slowly declining trend in the commercial fortunes for the project, though the album sold well and “The Very Best In You” was popular. Mixed fortunes During the recording and touring of their fourth album, This Is Your Time (1983) Change’s relatively stable line-up of performers, writers and producers as well as their commercial success faltered. The album failed to chart a major hit, with the title track flopping in comparison to previous lead singles. After the album’s release Rick Brennan stepped into the place of Robinson who left to pursue a solo career, while producers Davide Romani and Mauro Malavasi departed for other projects. At the same time of these important departures, Change was bolstered by the contributions of bassist and songwriter Timmy Allen and returning vocalist Deborah Cooper now promoted to lead, both of whom remained in the band until its demise. After Change, Cooper worked with the C+C Music Factory in the 1990s.[2] The failure of the 1983 album left future of Change in jeopardy. Petrus wisely hired recently sacked Time members Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to write and produce what would become Change of Heart in 1984.[2] The album did well internationally, returning the group to the charts in Europe and the USA. The title track became Change’s first top ten R&B hit in three years. Unlike former Change albums which had a large number of songwriters, Change of Heart was written by just three writers, four tracks were by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis’ partnership while the remaining four were the work of Timmy Allen. Nevertheless, Allen was given the opportunity by Petrus to write and produce the majority of what became Change’s final album in 1985, Turn on Your Radio. This album bore little of the polished dance and R&B sound that the group had always emphasized, and was less successful even than This Is Your Time, though Europe remained receptive to the group. The band’s final US hit “Let’s Go Together” was notable as it was co-written by Petrus with returning collaborators Davide Romani and Paul Slade. Demise and future Turn on Your Radio was the band’s commercial low point, but had not been intended as the act’s final release. The formal end came after the death of Petrus in 1987. While the original Change disappeared after Petrus’ death, Davide Romani, Mike Francis (Francesco Puccioni), and Patrick Boothe attempted to revive the project in 1990. This new Change project was planned for a release on BMG North America under the name X-Change in 1992, but due to lack of money, the album was left unreleased. The availability of the X-Change recordings was resolved in 2009 after Romani closed a deal with Italian label Fonte Records to release the album later that same year as Change Your Mind, it was produced by Romani and Puccioni, written by Romani, Puccioni and Boothe, with Boothe as the main lead vocalist. In 2001, AmericanR&B/pop singer Janet Jackson featured a sample of Change’s The Glow of Love in her number 1 single “All for You”. In 2018, Change returned with original members Davide Romani and Mauro Malavasi, and new vocalist Tanya Michelle Smith. The reformed act also released their first single and video, “Hit or Miss,” in June 2018, which is the lead off track from “Love 4 Love,” a nine-song set scheduled for a September 2018 release.\n\nCynthia Manley A petite and powerful performer that can steal your heart in a moment and then melt you with her passion in the next. She can send shivers up your spine, causing what Quincy Jones aptly described as “truth marks,” singing stories as though she were talking to only you. She sings in the “blue eyed soul” tradition, and lists Janis Joplin, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Tina Turner amongst her heroes. She has been singing along with their records since she was a child on her parent’s coffee table. In her illustrious career, she has recorded 11 national and international hit records. Her recordings include: covers of “Remember Me/ Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” “Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You,” “Back In My Arms Again” and “Stand,” as well as her original songs, “Chain Reaction,” “Crusin’ The Streets,” “Everybody Dance,” “Give,” “Sunshine Hotel,” “Save The World” and her latest album of her “Greatest Hits.” As the original and only touring lead singer for the Boys Town Gang, she has become a legend within the dance community. Her performance record in America is hard to match. She has performed in every major city many times over as well as being invited to small town venues and lounges. Whether singing for a small number of music lovers or thousands of cheering fans, she gives 100% of herself when performing. She was one of 10 artists asked to perform at the International New Music Seminar, in New York City and was named one of the Top 20 Artists of the Year, in Billboard magazine. She has toured the globe several times. Her tours have brought her to Germany, Spain, Ireland, Italy, England, France, South America, Japa, Switzerland, and China, Oman and Brazil. In a role that was particularly close to her heart, she was asked to portray Janis Joplin in “Janis” The one-woman show had a successful run and gave her vital theatrical training. Although she loved the experience, the role didn’t allow for anything else in her life, and she knew she wanted more. When asked about career highlights Cynthia says she is “the most proud of her military tours.” She has taken bands into Iraq, Bosnia, Baghdad, Kosovo, Korea, and many other places of danger for our troops. They often had to wear flack jackets and bulletproof vests in 130* heat or perform in the freezing cold. On one base, only 23 soldiers were allowed to come to her performance because they were under alert. She slow danced with each soldier, one by one, while her keyboardist sang. By giving them each a special moment of peace, it brought tears to our brave men’s faces as well hers. This is but one example of her connection with her audiences. In addition to performing, she has had 3 of her compositions included in major movies. She has co-written and produced 4 original CDs, as well as an instructional package for up and coming singer/musicians. Her work has also included dozens of national commercials for both radio and television. And as a backing vocalist she can be heard on dozens of internationally recognized Blues recordings. In April 2009 while touring Switzerland, she met international producer and D.J. Jamie Lewis. The two had an instant connection and soon began working on their first project together. In April 2010 they released their original composition “GIVE” on Jamie’s Swiss label, Purple Music. The record received critical radio and club exposure and sold well, topping several dance music charts in various countries. With Jamie doing the music and Cynthia composing the melody and lyric, the duo have become a creative musical force. In June 2011, they put out their second release, “SUNSHINE HOTEL.” By now their vision was clearer and stronger. Cynthia recorded her master vocal tracks in Los Angeles. As part of the Los Angeles music community she was able to bring in top-notch background singers. Ruben ‘Swift’ Vidal directed the video. The disc featured American re-mixers and producers doing their interpretation, as well as the Australian team “PnP.” The accompanying video was placed on 12 in-store video play streams, such as Banana Republic and Hard Rock Café. Cynthia did satellite interviews from Africa and Brazil, to NYC and Hollywood in a promotional effort. With its success she had reminded the Dance music world that she was alive and well! 2012 was a busy year for Cynthia. She continued touring and composing as well as working with her L.A. based, old-skool R&B band. While catching up with old friends some suggested, “you should write this stuff down,” and so she did. She put it in a“how to” platform and basically told her story of maintaining a successful life, in Los Angeles, without being on television. The package entitled “YOU WANT TO BE A ROCKSTAR” continues to sell. It covers everything from running and promoting a band to marketing yourself in social media. Tips on makeup, wardrobe, and walking techniques, are accompanied with visual aids. Also included is a short vocal coaching session, with exercises to strengthen and control your vocal chords. In 2013, she recorded an updated version of “CAN’T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF YOU.” The recording was produced D.J., Paul Goodyear. She took the project on by herself with the help of some very talented friends. Glenn Rivera directed the video for the song, shot on a green screen, which was a first for Cynthia. The song received chart exposure and filled dance floors across the globe. She mastered 12 various mixes onto a compact disc, which allowed D.J.’s to do their own edits. 2014 began with a bang as Cynthia hit the road with her “Cruisin’ The Streets” tour. She enjoyed the stages of several gay pride events and was even asked to be the Grand Marshall for the Wilton Manor’s parade. On August 22nd Cynthia and producer Jamie Lewis released their latest #-1 record, “ SAVE THE WORLD.” She celebrated disco’s 40th birthday throughout the year and her chapter in it, as heralded by the very successful book, “ First Ladies Of Disco.” In December Cynthia ended a great year by releasing her long awaited “GREATEST HITS” compact disc. Of the 12 tracks, included are four of her internationally charted dance hits. Her signature medley of “Remember Me/Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” is there in remixed form as well as the adult-rated gay anthem “Cruisin’ The Streets.” It also includes “Back In My Arms Again” (making it’s compact disc premier) as well as tracks that she recorded in Italy plus three previously unreleased songs. Of those unreleased tracks is a scorching hi-energy version of “Turn The Beat Around” produced by Kevin O’Connor. This song as Cynthia puts it“was my most technically challenging vocal recording ever.” With six pages of Cynthia’s own recollections and pictures from across the decades, it is sure to charm and satisfy. Now 2015 is in full bloom. So far Cynthia has lent her time, energy and talent to several fund raising events. Giving back to her community is a priority. Whether it’s delivering food to the hungry through Project Angel Food, (a charity she has been involved with since 1990), or helping to raise funds for programs that empower teens against bullying, intolerance and discrimination. Cynthia can be found in the trenches doing her part to help. Her most recent humanitarian effort was lending her talent to noted producer Clifford Bell’s project against suicide. “ We Care” (song and video) features Cynthia along with the cream of the crop of L.A. session singers and vocalists united in this worthy project. On February 14th, Valentines Day, Cynthia brought the love to San Francisco. Her appearance at international DJ/Producer Paul Goodyear’s Where Love Lives” event was a magical evening for those lucky to attend. The venue, Beatbox, was transported back over 30 years of hits as Cynthia rattled the rafters with her high energy show. There is never a shortage of producers wanting to work with Cynthia, as her voice tells stories with such passion and conviction, but after releasing two records in 2014, she plans to roll slower into the next adventure. She discussed a project with fellow legends Carol Jiani and Claudja Barry, however the logistics made it better put on a slow burner. Family and friendships were all needing nurturing, which lead to composing and producing 3 records to submit for tv and/or movies. Nothing like drama to inspire ! Performances, travel, home, and creativity kept Cynthia busy through the rest of the year. 2016 started off with talks about the “La-La Peace Project,” and Cynthia’s participation with this “victims of violence”charitable project. This production is still in motion, including talents like Jessica Williams, Scherrie Payne, the incredible Vincents, and many more. From there, in March, Cynthia recorded 2 records for Grupo Discolocos for their upcoming documentary entitled“DISCOLOCOS.” It is an pleasure to be part of this event, honoring the music that has done so much for my life. Jamie Lewis is writing a new track for her to sing and write a story. It will go out on Jamie’s, Purple Music Records, Switzerland, probably early 2017. This is always a fun collaboration. Suffice it to say, Ms. Manley is excited about all this. She has an optimistic attitude that keeps her working and creating. One thing is for sure, she won’t stop singing, performing and creating new product until her “ ashes are thrown to the wind.” She has always tremendously loved working with her old skool R&B band, so she plans to put a lot of energy into creating more venues with which to share this experience. Visit her “Cynthia Manley Band ” page on this website to read their story and see pictures. Because Cynthia LOVES to perform, she and Annie Bertucci (www.anniebertucci.com) have created a duo to do local gigs that can’t afford the trio, or want a more structured show. As of May, 2016, they have done 3 parties and are having a blast. They plan to work cruises, hotels, casinos, and any gig that “puts them on the road”. They are “SUGAR AND SPICE,” and they are FUN ! Full into the electronic world, they can perform literally 100s of songs, according to audience. “Let them lead the way.”These talented women enjoy working together and have delicious harmonies woven throughout their performances. Their voices are their instruments and they are ‘jammin’ ……. and funny, too ! Stay tuned, as you never know what she’ll come up with next!\n\nPhilly soul drummer Earl Young kept the beat on countless hits coming out of the City of Brotherly Love during the ’60s, ’70s, and mid-’80s. As one-third of the classic Baker-Harris-Young rhythm section that included bassist Ron Baker and guitarist Norman Harris, Young played on hits by the Intruders, the O’Jays, Barbara Mason, Teddy Pendergrass,Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, the Three Degrees, the Village People, and many others. The trio was an integral part of MFSB, the studio aggregation that was the house band forKenneth Gamble & Leon Huff’s Philadelphia International Records (PIR). He also played on numerous releases issued by other Philly-area labels and co-formed Baker-Harris-Young Productions, having hits with First Choice,Loleatta Holloway, Love Committee, and other acts on the Cayre Brothers’ Salsoul Records out of New York City. Young, who first aspired to be a singer, read drum instruction books and taught himself how to play. As a teen, he began playing drums in a marching band called the Elks. Economics dictated that he concentrate on the drums rather than sing, because it paid better. In the early ’60s, Young began his professional recording career with the Volcanos. The group’s 1965 R&B hit “Storm Warning” peaked at number 33. They were the house band for the Uptown Theater in Philadelphia. The Uptown was akin to New York’s Apollo Theater, a necessary stop for R&B/pop acts of the ’60s. While playing at the Uptown,Young backed such stars as Jackie Wilson. In his early twenties, Young was called by Stevie Wonder to join him on his tour of Japan. Wonder, who was a student of influential Motown drummer Benny Benjamin, taught Young some valuable drumming tips. Returning to Philadelphia, Young teamed up with guitarist Norman Harris and bassist Ron Baker where they began playing at area clubs. Of the three,Harris began doing recording sessions first, later bringing in Young and Baker. The group can be heard on Barbara Mason’s “Yes I’m Ready” (number two on the R&B charts for two weeks, number five pop, summer 1965) and on the Delfonics’ “La La Means I Love You” (number two R&B for four weeks, number four pop, around March 1968) and the million-selling “Didn’t I Blow Your Mind” (number three R&B, number ten pop, January 1970). Besides their considerable playing abilities and cohesiveness, what also made the trio so in-demand was the fact that if record producers called Young, he could contact Bakerand Harris, thus insuring that there would be a complete rhythm section for the recording session; such “one stop shopping” saved time and money. In the late ’60s, producer Kenneth Gamble contacted Harristo play on sessions for the Intruders on his Gamble label. Harris brought Baker, but not Young because the drummer spot was filled by Karl Chambers, a former bandmate of Gamble’s when both were in the Romeos (“Precious Memories”). Young can be heard on the gold single “Cowboys and Girls” (number one R&B, number six pop, spring 1968), “When We Get Married” (number eight R&B, summer 1970), as well as the group’s later hits, “I’ll Always Love My Mama (Part 1)” (number six R&B, spring 1973), “I Wanna Know Your Name” (number nine R&B, fall 1973), and the Three Degrees’ platinum single “When Will I See You Again” (number four R&B, number two pop, fall 1974). Most of the PIR catalog has been reissued by Sony Legacy, U.K. label VCI, and PIR itself. The group had the golden touch, not to mention sound, playing on million-selling hits spanning the PIR catalog as well as by Joe Simon (the gold hit “Drowning in the Sea of Love,” number three R&B, number 11 pop, December 1971). One album that perfectly captures the era is Wilson Pickett in Philadelphia, a 1970 Atlantic Records album. The LP spawned the hits “Engine Number 9” (number three R&B, number 14 pop, fall 1970) and the gold single “Don’t Let the Green Grass Fool You” (number two R&B for two weeks, number 17 pop in February 1971). In 1995 Rhino reissued the album on CD. With such success, Baker-Harris-Young began backing such visiting acts as the Jacksons (their self titled 1976 gold LP), the Spinners (“I’ll Be Around,” number one R&B for five weeks, number three pop, fall 1972; “Could It Be I’m Falling in Love,” number one R&B, number four pop, late 1972; “One of a Kind (Love Affair),” number one R&B for four weeks and number 11 pop, spring 1973), B.B. King (“To Know You Is to Love You,” co-written by Stevie Wonder, number 12 R&B, July 1973; “I Like to Live the Love,” number six R&B, December 1973), the Whispers (“A Mother for My Children,” number 32 R&B, January 1974; “Bingo,” number 40 R&B, summer 1974), Blue Magic(“Sideshow,” number one R&B, number eight pop, spring 1974; “Three Ring Circus,” number five R&B), and the Temptations (“Think for Yourself”). With such an ever-increasing time-intensive schedule and more work with intricate arranger Thom Bell, Young was taught by Baker and Harris how to read music, as that skill was becoming a prerequisite. Bell arranged “People Make the World Go Round” — number six R&B, number 25 pop, summer 1972 — for the Stylistics. On the track, Young had to contend with the difficult task of shifting between three different time signatures. After logging so much studio time, Baker-Harris-Young decided to get into the business end of music. They started Golden Fleece, a record label and music publishing company. Going to Sigma Sound in Philadelphia, they convinced studio owner Joe Tarsia and general manager Harry Tipitt to donate some studio time. Young sang lead in a bass voice on “Zing Went the Strings of My Heart,” a hit for Judy Garland in 1943. An executive at Buddah Records,Neil Bogart (later head of Casablanca Records in the ’70s), picked up “Zing…” and the record was a number 17 R&B hit in summer 1972. Three Trammps tracks were released on Golden Fleece: “Love Epidemic,” (number 75 R&B, late 1973), “Where Do We Go From Here” (number 44 R&B, spring 1974), and “Trusting Heart” (number 72 R&B, late 1974). Lacking the necessary distribution, the group switched to PIR, releasing two LPs. Another Buddah hit for the group was “Hold Back the Night,” number ten R&B, late 1975. Curiously, “Hold…” was released after the group had signed with Atlantic, with their first charting single being “Hooked for Life,” number 70 R&B, fall 1975. When he wasn’t touring with the Trammps, Young still cut for PIR and other labels, and even recorded with one of his music idols, drummer/singer Grady Tate. Signing with Atlantic, the Trammps began cutting R&B/disco hits, including “That’s Where the Happy People Go” (number 12 R&B, spring 1976) and “Disco Inferno” (number nine R&B, number 11 pop, March 1977). “The Trammps”‘ big crossover break came when “Disco Inferno” was included on the mega-selling movie soundtrack of Saturday Night Fever starring John Travolta. The track was selected because the Trammps were a favorite at popular Brooklyn, NY, disco club 2001 Odyssey. The club was used as a location for the filming of the movie. The group rode the wave of the wildly popular movie; wherever the movie was playing, The Trammps could find an eager audience. In the late ’70s, the trio started Baker-Harris-Young Productions, producing, writing, and playing on disco/R&B hits for Salsoul Records artists Loleatta Holloway (“Hit and Run”), Double Exposure (“Ten Percent,” “My Love Is Free”), First Choice (“Armed and Extremely Dangerous”), and Love Committee (“Heaven Only Knows,” “Cheaters Never Win,” “Law and Order”). The trio was reunited with Eddie Holman, whom they’d backed on “Hey There Lonely Girl” (number four R&B, number two pop, late 1969), for the 1977 album, This Will Be a Night to Remember. Baker-Harris-Young primarily were studio musicians, but toured with MFSB and Vince Montana’s Salsoul Orchestra, with whom they also recorded. Baker-Harris-Young’s own self-titled Salsoul album was released in fall 1979, later becoming a dance classic. Most of the B-H-Y tracks are available on numerous Salsoul compilations and reissues on their imprint and licensed through Capitol/Right Stuff and U.K. label Charly Records. When Salsoul ceased record business operations to focus a home video division, the trio continued to do session dates and Youngcontinued touring with the Trammps. During the ’80s, the trio began to fade. Norman Harris died in 1987. “My Forever Love” (number two R&B, fall 1987) from Levert’s 1987 Atlantic LP The Big Throwdown was one of the last completed tracks by the multi-talented guitarist/songwriter/arranger/producer. Bassist Ron Baker passed away in 1991. Without his friends,Young began to scale back, only drumming on sessions he felt were worthwhile. In 1994, Rhino Records issued That’s Where the Happy People Go: The Best of the Trammps. The Collectibles label reissuedThe Legendary Zing Album, Featuring The Fabulous Trammps as Golden Classics in 1992. Still active in the business today, Young tours all over the world with the Trammps, whose “Disco Inferno” is still hot. The track has been featured on various movie and TV soundtracks and in ad campaigns. The group, which now includes “Hooked for Life” co-writer Bunny Sigler, has done TV appearances on Oprah, The Ricki Lake Show, VH1’s Where Are They Now, and the Mike Douglas Show. Young accompaniedJocelyn Brown on her remake of the Ashford & Simpson song “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” originally a 1967 hit for Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell. Brown sang lead on a 1981 disco-oriented remake for Salsoul Records act Inner Life. The veteran drummer is also working with Salsoul Records on a tribute compilation to Baker-Harris-Young. The trio is memorialized with a plaque in front of the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Artist Biography by Ed Hogan\n\nFelipe Rose came into prominence in the 1970s out of the urban gay clubs and discotheques of New York City. He was best known in those days as the Native “Indian” dancer and singer inspired by his parent’s heritage when he met a French producer by the name of Jacque Morali. Felipe’s ancestry is that of Taino and Lakota. His mother was from Puerto Rico and his father arrived from a wave of Indians who came to New York City to work in construction in the 1950’s. Felipe would grow up in the ghettos of Brownsville, Brooklyn, but his rise to pop music fame would make him a fixture in mainstream music culture. Felipe became an original member of Village People fame, by the young age of 19 yrs old. Village People began as a disco group well known for their on-stage costumes and named after New York City’s Greenwich Village. Originally created by Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo inspired by Felipe’s insidious imagery to target disco’s gay audience, the Village People quickly became popular and moved into the mainstream. The group scored several disco dance hits internationally, including three hits in the US, “Macho Man, “In the Navy”, and their biggest hit, “Y.M.C.A.”. Now four decades later, Felipe and Village People remained a pop culture mainstay in music, sports arenas, commercials and television as they continue to tour the world. “Y.M.C.A” remains the group’s biggest hit since it’s release in 1978. The song remains popular and is played throughout the U.S. and Europe, with crowds using the dance in which the arms are used to spell out the four letters of the song’s title. The song is number 7 on VH1’s list of The 100 Greatest Dance Songs of the 20th Century. Village People’s mega-hits include: San Francisco/Hollywood Macho Man Y.M.C.A. In The Navy Go West Can’t Stop the Music 5 0’Clock In the Morning\n\nLet’s Go Back to the Dance Floor (2014) written and penned for VP by K.C. of the Sunshine Band Internationally, on a worldwide scale, Y.M.C.A. sold over a million copies each in Germany and United Kingdom. The latter also made it a hit all over again in 1993 when a remix hit #12 ( made it to #1 for the first three weeks of 1979 in its original go-round). The Guinness British hit single ranked Y.M.C.A. as the 45th biggest single ever on that country’s music chart (which began in 1952). Putting it ahead of “Unchained Melody” and behind “Reach Out I’ll Be There.” To date, Felipe and the Village People sold over 100 million records and have won many international music awards and garnered over 30 Platinum and Gold records. Felipe’s highest moment of achievement was receiving a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the following month, being inducted into the NAMA Music Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1996, he formed The Tomahawk Group and Tomahawk Records focusing on songwriting and talent development. BY 2001, with Tomahawk flourishing, Felipe set his sights on a solo career, collaborating with his longtime composer/arranger Forrest “Frosty” Lawson. Rose released his first EP, “Trail of Tears, his retelling of the forced removal of the Cherokee Nation. Creating his hybrid Native dance composition’s calling it Disco Fever/Burning up the Rez! It received rave reviews and was nominated for three Native American Music Awards in 2002. Felipe was asked to open the Fifth Annual Native American Music Awards show. His production number “brought the house down” and “Trail of Tears” took home “Best Historical Recording” honors that year. To date, no artist has ever duplicated the energy and visual effect, that Felipe unveiled that evening at the Marcus Amphitheater.\n\nContinuing his solo sojourn in 2003, Felipe released “We’re Still Here”. Rose was again nominated and awarded a second NAMMY as the EP won the coveted “Single Song of the Year” statuette at the Sixth Annual Awards show. In 2005, rounding out the trilogy was his next CD, a tribute to the late Virginia Indian activist Thomasina E. Jordan, entitled, “Red Hawk Woman”. Combining contemporary elements with traditional music, spoken word, Native hip-hop, and poetry, the recording features contributions by; Chief Anne Richardson, Chief of the Rappahannock Nation, flutist Douglas Blue Feather and Native rapper Shadowyze. The album won best Hip-Hop Recording and Songwriter of the Year. Felipe then returned to rapper Shadowyze to create a hip-hop offering called, “Two Fallen Feathers”.\n\nTaking a break from recording, he continued touring the world with Village People, heading in concert venues, throughout Europe, South East Asia, and Australia, for the 39th time in his career and a country he calls his second home. In 2005, Felipe donated his Gold single of Y.M.C.A. before an international audience in the rotunda of the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI). His unique branding and indigenous style in pop music and his rich heritage is reflected in the clothing he dons with Village People as he tours the world. To Felipe, he is not just wearing a stage costume, and shares where his roots come from, using his unique style that honors the heritage of his Native American roots, which reflect the that he dons to perform in.\n\nThis is not just a costume but is a signifier of where his bi-racial roots come from and his long association with Native American Indian groups across the country. A “ShadowWalker” is a Native term or word for walking in two worlds and also as a “Two-Spirited” person who is Gay. Felipe has managed to stay relevant throughout his adult life tapping into a passion and devotion to what he loves to do around the country as a speaker, an ordained minister with the Universal Church of Life, most recently he was the host and interviewer on the Red Carpet for the Native American Music Awards and also as a presenter in the category for Artist of the Year.\n\nHe has always been committed to the advancement of human celebration and its potential in Music Arts, Culinary and Visual Arts.

The Trenton, NJ, band started out with the core lineup of bassist Raymond Earl, drummer Scotty Miller, and guitarist Kim Miller. It later expanded to include keyboardist Dennis Richardson; lead singer James Carmichael; horn players Larry Davis, Eric Huff, and Johnny Onderlinde; and percussionist Charles Williams. The band can be heard on sides by Evelyn “Champagne” King (her gold single “Shame”), Archie Bell & the Drells (“Let’s Groove,” “The Soul City Walk,” and “Strategy”), South Shore Commission (“Free Man,” “A Train Called Freedom”), the O’Jays (” Let Me Make Love to You,” “I Swear I Love No One but You”), Lou Rawls (“From Now On,” “When You Get Home”), Gabor Szabo (“Keep Smilin'”), and Jean Carn, as well as for their mentor, Bunny Sigler, and his cover of “Love Train,” “Keep Smilin’,” “Let Me Party With You,” “Sweeter Than the Berry,” and “Only You,” a duet with Loleatta Holloway. In the mid-’60s, bassist Raymond Earl met drummer Scotty Miller in grade school and formed the duo the Music Machine. In 1973, Scotty’s younger brother, guitarist Kim Miller, joined the duo. After hours and hours of playing together, the trio found that they clicked; they became so intuitively “tuned” into each other that they could anticipate and accent each other’s playing. In 1968, they began backing local vocal group the TNJs, appearing at local dances and venues building up a good reputation. Around 1971, the group’s manager Jackie Ellis christened the backup band Instant Funk because they could come up with funky grooves instantaneously. Philly soul artist/producer/songwriter Bunny Sigler was invited by Ellis to see Instant Funk and the TNJs perform. Sometime during the show, Sigler was called on stage to perform. He was impressed that the band knew “Sunshine,” a song he co-wrote with Phil Hurtt that was made popular by the O’Jays. They began backing Sigler, the Manhattans, and various other R&B acts. As a staff songwriter/producer at Gamble & Huff’s Philadelphia International Records, Sigler began using Instant Funk on his sessions along with the TNJs. At those sessions and later, Sigler would record the basic track with Earl and the Miller brothers. Sigler, a brimming fount of ideas, would often stop the band midsong to implement one of his flashes of brillance. They backed Sigler on three of his PIR albums: That’s How Long I’ll Be Loving You, Keep Smilin’, and My Music. Some tracks from those LPs are on Sony/Legacy’s The Best of Bunny Sigler: Sweeter Than the Berry and the 1998 Sony CD Bunny Sigler. Instant Funk released a single on PIR’s TSOP imprint, “Float Like a Butterfly,” and an album, Get Down With the Philly Jump, issued in November 1976, whose title track and “It Aint Reggae (But It Sho Is Funky)” were popular in disco clubs. Instant Funk can also be heard on sides by the O’Jays (“Let Me Make Love to You,” “You’ve Got Your Hooks in Me,” “Once Is Not Enough,” and “I Swear I Love No One but You” from Message in Our Music; “Strokety Stroke” from So Full of Love), Archie Bell & the Drells (“Let’s Groove,” “Strategy,” “The Soul City Walk,” and “I Could Dance All Night” on Tightening It Up:The Best of Archie Bell & the Drells), the Three Degrees (“Take Good Care of Yourself”), Jean Carn (“I’m in Love Once Again” and “You Are All I Need” from Jean Carn), Dexter Wansel (“Life on Mars,” the best recording that gives an idea of how the band sounded live, and “You Can Be What You Wanna Be” from The Very Best of Dexter Wansel), and M.F.S.B. (“Let’s Go Disco” from Universal Love). The band can be heard on studio bandmate T. Life’s That’s Life album and LPs by his protégée, Evelyn “Champagne” King (Smooth Talk and Music Box). In 1977, M.F.S.B. guitarist Norman Harris started his own label, Gold Mind Records, distributed by New York-based Salsoul Records. Sigler signed on as a recording artist. He and the band were constantly in the studio recording ideas and songs. One track, “Let Me Party With You,” Sigler would listen to while driving around and excited passengers suggested that he release it. The single, co-written by the Miller brothers, Earl, and Sigler, went to number eight R&B in January 1978. The track was reminiscent of Marvin Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up.” The album, Let Me Party With You, was a huge disco hit, and included the follow-up single, the funky Sam Peake’s sax-drenched ballad “I Got What You Need,” “Don’t Even Try,” and the club hit “Your Love Is So Good.” While brainstorming in the studio, Sigler and Instant Funk came up with “I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl).” Sigler did overdubs on the track at Philadelphia-area studios, Alpha International and Sigma Sound Studios, before taking it to Bob Blank’s Blank Tapes in New York. When the track was done, Sigler shopped it around to the record labels, who rebuffed him with comments like “the hook’s not strong enough” and it sounds incomplete.” Instant Funk signed with Gold Mind, but by the time their single “I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)” was released, Gold Mind had folded and all of its acts were transferred to Salsoul. The million-selling “I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)” (remixed by Larry Levan) parked at number one R&B for three weeks, peaking at number 20 pop on Billboard’s charts in March 1979. Their second album, Instant Funk, issued January 1979, went gold hitting number one R&B in spring 1979. Other Instant Funk albums on Salsoul were: Witch Doctor (November 1979), The Funk Is On (October 1980), Looks So Fine (March 1982), Instant Funk, Vol. 5 (January 1983), and Kinky (September 1983). The band backed Sigler on his Salsoul LPs: I’ve Always Wanted to Sing…Not Just Write Songs (March 1979) and Let It Snow (June 1980). Other Salsoul LPs that feature Instant Funk are Loleatta Holloway’s Queen of the Night, Loleatta, and Greatest Hits; Double Exposure’s Locker Room; and the Salsoul Orchestra’s How High. For Neil Bogart’s Casablanca Records, the band can be heard on two albums Sigler produced for the label: Party Girl by Patti Brooks and Callin’ by the Pips. On Curtis Mayfield’s Curtom Records, Sigler and the band are on Barbara Mason & Bunny Sigler’s Locked in This Position, the self-titled debut of Mystique featuring Ralph Johnson, and Mayfield’s own Heartbeat. With the John Brothers, who were featured on Witch Doctor, they recorded a Sigler-produced RCA single, “Try to Walk a Mile” b/w “I Just Want to Be Free,” both songs written by Bunny’s brother Jimmy Sigler. They are also on Gabor Szabo’s Mercury LP Nightflight and Carl Carlton’s I Wanna Be With You. When the Cayre brothers, owners of Salsoul Records, decided to fold the label in 1984, in an effort to concentrate on the then-emerging home video market, Instant Funk was without a record deal. The band toured for a few years then disbanded. Some of the members were still in the music business in one form or another as the 21st century began. Raymond Earl was operating his own studio and production company, Ray Ray Productions. Kim Miller, Dennis Richardson, and James Carmichael went into gospel music. Bunny Sigler was touring the world as a member of the Trammps. “I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)” can be found on the CD reissue of their 1979 gold album Instant Funk, Greatest Hits from EMI/Capitol/The Right Stuff, in the movie and on the soundtrack for the Disney/Miramax movie 54, Larry Levan’s Paradise Garage, and various Salsoul and Salsoul-licensed compilations. Artist Biography by Ed Hogan\n\nJOEL DIAMOND Joel Diamond is now celebrating his 50th year in the music industry and going stronger than ever. His vast experience has included everything from music publishing, record production, song writing, personal management, and even having been a recording artist himself. He has held senior positions in both executive and creative capacities for major music companies, including Sony. Just recently, a top Sony executive described him this way: “Joel is respected as one of the industry’s more creatively oriented business people who always has his finger on the pulse of what’s happening now.” Joel Diamond began his music industry career by heading up MRC Music (the publishing arm of Mercury Records). He scored his first #1 record with “This Girl Is A Woman Now,” as recorded by Gary Puckett and the Union Gap. He followed up with Steam’s #1 “Na, Na, Hey, Hey” (on which he is also was one of the background singers) and then the Supremes’ and Temptations’ smash duo of “I’m Gonna Make You Love Me.” He organized MRC Music with keen instinct and by setting high standards for himself. He recruited virtual unknowns at the time such as: Janice Seigal, who is currently and has been from inception the lead singer of Manhattan Transfer; Phil Cody, who went on to write numerous top 10 hits with Neil Sedaka; Don Oriolo, the force behind Lisa Lisa’s success, and also the current copyright owner of the famed cartoon characters Felix The Cat and Casper The Ghost; artist Benny Mardones, who scored his top 10 record twice with “Into The Night”; songwriter Alan Bernstein, who wrote “This Girl’s A Woman Now,” and later penned Engelbert Humperdinck’s #1 records for Diamond, “After The Lovin'” and “This Moment In Time.” Robert Flax, who is the former President of EMI Music International and former partner with the law firm of Grubman/Indursky; and last, but not least, Diamond’s #2 man and assistant, Tommy Mottola, who with Diamond’s help, landed him his position at Chappell Music, which in turn afforded him the opportunity to launch the careers of Hall & Oats. Mottola, former husband of diva Mariah Carey, current husband of Thalia, Latin soap opera queen and pop star, currently heads up his own Universal distributed company after serving for 15 years as CEO of Sony Music Entertainment. Clive Davis, former President of Arista Records, then President of CBS Records, became aware of Diamond’s accomplishments. Davis brought Diamond on board and positioned him as the head of the CBS Music Publishing Division (replacing Tony Orlando, who was then riding the crest of his second #1 record, “Knock Three Times”) to oversee the New York, Los Angeles, and Nashville offices, as well as part of Clive’s personal A&R staff at CBS Records. Diamond initiated his publishing/record signings with an unknown group, Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show, who went on to achieve 62 gold and platinum records worldwide. His second signing was that of two brothers who had written the classic song “Never My Love,” which not only achieved the #1 position three different times by three different artists, but also just recently received an unprecedented 6 Million Performance Award from BMI. The Addrisi Brothers, thanks to Diamond, now had their first #1 record as recording artists and writers entitled “We’ve Gotta Get It On Again,” which today Joel owns 50% of as well as at least 25 other Addrisi songs. Mama Cass’ last top 10 record “Move In A Little Closer” hit the charts during this era and is currently owned by Diamond’s publishing company. It was also during this period that Diamond’s music publishing career flourished and gave him the opportunity to work closely with such writer/artist giants such as James Taylor, Laura Nyro, Harry Nilson, Van Morrison, The Bee Gees, Rod Stewart, Barry Manilow, David Bowie, etc. and build long lasting relationships at every level with gifted songwriters, producers, managers, studio owners, attorneys, and record company heads, many of whom are today’s power brokers of the industry. One such example is David Geffen, who recently donated 200 million dollars to UCLA according to a recent article in the LA times, and states that it all began for him in 1971. It was Diamond who was pivotal, as the head of the publishing company, along with CBS chief Clive Davis, that afforded Geffen his first seven figure deal in exchange for Laura Nyro’s Tuna Fish Music. This in turn afforded Geffen the luxury of signing Linda Ronstadt, The Eagles, and Jackson Browne, and became the nucleus and birth of Asylum Records After several successful years at CBS/Sony, an offer made to Diamond to establish and run his own record label came from Polygram International. He used this opportunity to now produce records for the first time for his own label, as well as outside labels as well. This was also the birth of his currently successful & wholly owned publishing companies, Silver Blue Music and Oceans Blue Music, as well as the beginning of Silver Blue Records and Silver Blue Productions, Ltd.. Gearing his label early on mostly toward R&B and Dance, he scored no less than 27 chart successes, including several Billboard #1 R&B singles. Silver Blue Records signed Van McCoy, best known for his ground-breaking hit/dance, “The Hustle,” as an exclusive artist; and at the same time benefitted Silver Blue Music by purchasing 29 Van McCoy copyrights. Enjoying the art of producing, he carried it one step further by creating his own sound with himself as the artist. His first self-produced album that rode the charts during the height of the disco craze was “The Joel Diamond Experience”, distributed by CBS Records followed by his Casablanca album, then a top 50 single Billboard hit, “Theme From Raging Bull”, distributed by Motown, followed by an independently distributed album entitled Joel Diamond’s “House Gold” and a Silver Blue Records distributed deal with Henry Stone & TK Records. Joel Diamond’s classic rendition (still being played today in clubs as the end of the evening spin), “Super-Strauss,” was distributed by Atlantic Records. To add yet another dimension to his string of successes, Diamond was approached by film producer Frank Capra, Jr. to write and produce the title song for Capra’s new movie, “Paradise,” starring Phoebe Cates (“Fast Times At Ridgemont High”). The result was an astonishing success. The “Theme From Paradise” quickly became a gold and platinum record, selling 712,000 copies in Italy alone, and remained #1 for an amazing 22 weeks. This huge European success became the vehicle for Diamond weave a deal for Phoebe with an entire album with CBS/Sony Records. Having proven successful with this project, the title track to a John Belushi movie, “Continental Divide,” came next with Helen Reddy singing the title song and Joel producing. Then a chance meeting with Michael Uslan (of “Batman” fame), landed Joel the opportunity to write and produced the title them for the film “Swamp Thing.”. Before Reality Shows were in fashion, Diamond co-wrote the title song for Gary Nardino’s highly acclaimed Showtime Cable TV sitcom, “Brothers,” which is now in network syndication. The show prides itself on having achieved for the first time on cable, over 100 episodes. In addition, Diamond has had his copyrights performed on such major TV shows as Chicago Hope, ER, Friends, Beverly Hills 90210, 2001 Super Bowl, etc., as well as multiple features. A film director in search of “authenticity” (for what turned out to be a critically acclaimed cult movie) gave Diamond an opportunity to stretch his talents even further. Diamond co-starred with Ruben Blades and Elizabeth Pena in one of Miramax’s first films, “Crossover Dreams”. The film portrays Joel Diamond a/k/a Neil Silver as a highly successful record producer offering a big break to a Latino recording artist, Ruben Blades a/k/a Rudy Velez. This film and storyline no doubt was a template for today’s Latino cross-over success in the music industry. Certainly one of the apexes of Diamond’s career (thus far) has been the 12 successful albums and 109 recordings he has produced in 1976 for legendary recording artist, Engelbert Humperdinck. “After The Lovin’,” a 100% owned Diamond copyright, was nominated twice for a Grammy, achieved platinum album and gold single status, won most played “Jukebox Record of the Year” award, top 10 best sheet music seller of all time, #1 Country record, and has surpassed the 4 million radio/TV performances as logged by BMI, which has only been accomplished by around 40 songs in BMI history and carries with it substantial monetary bonus awards. “This Moment In Time,” another #1 record and 100% owned copyright and Diamond produced recording, is close to follow the achievements of “After The Lovin'”. It was also during this period of time, that Joel became a virtual magnet for many diversified and eclectic Pop, Country, R&B, and Middle of the Road Artists that the industry had given up on and boosted their careers by producing Billboard Hot 100 chart singles for such artists as: Helen Reddy, David Clayton-Thomas, Tommy James, Jay & The Americans, Gloria Gaynor, Howard Hewett, Clint Holmes, Steve Tyrell, Al Martino, Lana Cantrell, Eddie Arnold, Billy Crash Craddock, James Darren, Jack Jones etc. He also produced the one and only recording for Britt Ekland (married to Peter Sellers & The Bond girl), and also produced quite a unique perennial Christmas record with Joe Pesci & Frank Vincent. An interesting occurrence in Europe happened for Diamond with superstar actor David Hasselhoff. When they met, David was then the star of Knight Rider, which was followed by BayWatch – the “most watched TV show” on the planet according to Guinness. After being turned down by virtually every U.S. record label, it was only Diamond who believe in David’s talent, ability, and potential career in music. Joel Diamond personally underwrote and produced David’s first recording session that resulted in making David’s dream come true. Little did anybody think that one year later after the recording, that David would achieve Gold & Platinum status in Germany (outselling Michael Jackson & Madonna) on .his first album on Silver Blue Records. This led to David Hasselhoff, also known as The Hoff, being voted the #1 recording artist in Germany, selling literally tens of millions of records, earning a cool $60,000 per performance and to this day selling out stadiums around the world. An advanced copy of a song from a forthcoming Broadway Show, La Cage Aux Folles, given to Diamond by good friend, the late Allen Carr, would be another turning point in Diamond’s career. In a matter of days upon hearing this song, he was in the studio producing “I Am What I Am” with recording artist Gloria Gaynor. It became an instant International success on Silver Blue Records, and was also the linchpin for the return of Joel to CBS, except this time with his own wholly owned record label. “I Am What I Am” became, and still is, Gloria’s biggest single since her classic of “I Will Survive” and is officially the Gay Anthem around the world. The show “Chess” had just opened to rave reviews in London and Diamond was quick to get his hands on an advance backer’s audition “cassette”. Out of 20+ songs he heard on the tape (all performed “Broadway style,” it was only “One Night In Bangkok” that jumped out at him. He booked a studio and recording session for the next day, and pinpointed NY model (and part-time singer) Robey to record it. Once again, his instinct was spot on, resulting in a landmark Top 10 record for Silver Blue Records in the US, along with the simultaneous release and top 10 charts in 23 countries. The Family Film Awards was aired on CBS-TV. This was a concept put together and produced by Joel Diamond, Antonio Gellini, and Dick Clark – certainly, best known for the the Golden Globe Awards, Academy of Country Music Awards, Daytime Emmy Awards, and the legendary American Bandstand. The Show featured P.G. and G rated films exclusively, and was simulcast into 62 countries. A red carpet and star-studded evening indeed, with its Lifetime Award being presented to (an ailing and last TV appearance for) Bob Hope by Charlton Heston. Benny Mardones was first discovered literally coming off a bus from Savage, MD by Joel Diamond. Joel gave Benny his opportunity to write and sing his first recordings. Joel produced Benny’s first record called “Please Say You Want Me” followed by Joel producing “Tomorrow Means Another Day We’re Apart” having gotten Benny a deal on CBS Records. Benny certainly carved out a major recording career after that having written and produced on of the most iconic rock songs ever and to this day, still in the Top 25 most played songs on the radio, “INTO THE NIGHT”. It was Joel who made the Mike Curb connection for Benny to re-record “Into The Night” which landed him his second Top 10 record with the same song. It was only recently that Joel took Benny back in the studio to record “Into The Night” for the third time…stand by! Joel Diamond also served as Vice-president and ran Maurice Starr’s Boston International Records, distributed and located on the Disney Studio Lot. Maurice Starr is best known as the creator, producer, manager, and writer of two of the industry music phenomenons: New Kids On The Block and New Edition. It was during this time that Maurice was red hot with 10 #1 records with New Kids, that Joel asked Maurice “is there anybody in the business you have never met but always wanted to?” Answer: “Frank Sinatra and David Geffen!” Joel then orchestrated shortly thereafter, not only a personal meeting for him and Maurice to meet with Frank Sinatra at his home in Beverly Hills, but also the beginnings of Maurice & Joel producing Frank’s first Duets album. This meeting was then followed up by the second meeting for Maurice and Joel personally to meet with David Geffen at his office, at which time David offered Maurice his own label under the Geffen umbrella. Although at the time, Joel had put out a call for a new young male singer, he was contacted by the mom of 11 year old Kaci, who was insistent that Joel would be interested in her daughter once he heard her sing. Not only was he interested, he was completely knocked out with her vocal ability, Joel landed Kaci her first single and album deal with Curb/Warner Bros. Kaci’s and re-recorded the song that he had such a huge success with in Italy, “Paradise”. This time around “Paradise” debuted top 10 in England, and as of this date, has sold over 2 million units in the UK alone, and earned for Joel seven gold and platinum records, and one triple platinum. Paradise has also achieved gold status in Ireland, Greece, and Italy. Kaci, through Joel’s contact with SFX for personal appearances, toured with Backstreet Boys, O’Town, etc., and starred on a Pepsi Tour in 2002. Kaci’s second Diamond produced single release of “I Think I Love You,” also charted top 10 in UK, gold in Ireland, and top 5 in Canada. David Cassidy’s 15 year old daughter, Katie Cassidy, created all the magic in Diamond recorded sessions that originally launched the success of her dad, with her Diamond produced debut “hip-hop” single of “I Think I Love You.” Artemis Records (“Who Let The Dogs Out”) had the insight to see the potential of lightning striking twice, and Danny Goldberg and Daniel Glass personally signed Katie to their label. Katie was featured in People Magazine, Parade, and many other local and national papers, as well as Diamond arranging for a two hour special on VH1 for Katie. Katie’s career has now shifted into film and TV having been in three films and starring in multiple TV shows. On the other side of the spectrum Joel produced his first “comedy album” for the one-of-a-kind, Andrew Dice Clay, and succeeded in orchestrating a duet for Andrew with Snoop Dogg. In literally two weeks, Joel got Dice a deal with EMI, releasing a Comedy Album that sold over 75,000 copies. After Andrew’s return engagement to Madison Square Garden (FYI…the only comedian in history to ever sell out the Garden two nights in a row), strategically coinciding with the album release, his record sales went through the roof. Dice currently, in 2017, has two shows running on Showtime and is packing major venues again. Legendary Ike Turner had put his trust in Diamond, and before Ike’s passing, Joel put the final touches on his duet session, along with his wife, Audrey. A re-record of a new Joel Diamond produced version of “Tie A Yellow Ribbon ‘Round The Ole Oak Tree” featuring none other than Tony Orlando along with legendary rapper Young MC, is first time Tony allowed anybody other than his original producer, Hank Medress, to record him on this iconic song. Tony has incorporated this new rendition in his show, and receives a standing ovation each and every time. With recognition always being the compliment of one’s work, New York Magazine chose Joel Diamond, along with Jimmy Iovine and Phil Ramone, as one of “New York’s Hottest Record Producers.” Billboard Magazine described Diamond as, “one of Contemporary Music’s Best Record Producers sitting behind the board.”\n\nLOU GRAMM BIOGRAPHY Pre-Foreigner Era. Gramm was born in Rochester, New York, and began his musical career in hismid-teens, playing in local Rochester bands, including St. James Infirmary (laterThe Infirmary), and PHFFT. He later sang harmony vocals in another local band,Poor Heart. Gramm then went on to sing and play drums, and to eventuallybecome front man for the band Black Sheep. Black Sheep had the distinction ofbeing the first American band signed to the Chrysalis label, which released theirfirst single, “Stick Around” (1973). Black Sheep played in nightclubs in Rochesterand Buffalo, NY including McVan’s, formerly at Niagara Street and HertelAvenue. Soon after this initial bit of success, Black Sheep signed with CapitolRecords, releasing two albums in succession [Black Sheep (1974) andEncouraging Words (1975)]. They were the opening act for KISS when an icyaccident with their equipment truck on the New York State Thruway suddenlyended the band’s tour on Christmas Eve, 1975. Unable to support its albums withlive performances, Black Sheep came prematurely to a screeching halt. A year earlier, Lou Gramm had the opportunity to meet his future bandmate MickJones. Jones was in Rochester performing with the band Spooky Tooth, andGramm had given Jones a copy of Black Sheep’s first album (S/T). It was early in1976, not long after Black Sheep’s truck accident, when Jones, in search of alead vocalist for a new band he was assembling, expressed his interest inGramm and invited him in a phone call to audition for the job of lead singer. Foreigner Formation and Heyday With the blessings of his Black Sheep bandmates, Gramm flew down to NewYork to audition for the still-unnamed band. With his powerful vocals, he got thejob. Lou Grammatico then became Lou Gramm, and, with the band initiallyknown as “Trigger,” and later renamed Foreigner, became one of the mostsuccessful rock vocalists of the late 1970s and 1980s. Circus magazine in 1978upon release of “Hot Blooded” commented that Lou Gramm had a voice thatRobert Plant might envy. His unique vocals have made Foreigner one ofBillboard’s Top 100 Artists of All Time in hit songs history. Gramm was the lead vocalist on all of Foreigner’s hit songs, including “Feels Likethe First Time”, “Cold as Ice”, “Long, Long Way from Home”, “Hot Blooded”,”Double Vision”, “Blue Morning, Blue Day”, “Head Games”, “Dirty White Boy”,”Urgent”, “Juke Box Hero”, “Break It Up” and “Say You Will”. He co-wrote most ofthe songs for the band, which achieved two of its biggest hits with the ballads”Waiting for a Girl Like You”, which spent ten weeks at #2 on the 1981-82American Hot 100, and “I Want to Know What Love Is”, which was a #1 hitinternationally (US & UK) in 1985. Their first 8 singles cracked the Billboard Top20, (4 went Top 10) making them the first group since the Beatles to achieve thisin 1980. Following the band’s second album, the wildly successful Double Vision, shifts inpersonnel began to take place. Following their next album, Head Games, Grammand Jones jointly decided to reduce the band’s lineup from six to four members.The next album, which Gramm has called the high point of his work withForeigner, was aptly titled 4. Gramm wanted the band to remain true to its purerrock origins, favoring music with a solid drum and guitar structure, whereasJones embraced the 1980s style of synthesizer ballads — a more lucrativeapproach at the time. Indeed, the next album, Agent Provocateur, would findJones moving creatively in the opposite direction from Gramm, seeking outpotential co-producers such as Trevor Horn, and then Alex Sadkin, which endedup giving Foreigner’s sound a somewhat new-wavish, keyboard-dominant quality. Late 1980s and 1990s By 1987, Foreigner continued to struggle with ongoing internal conflicts. Duringthis period, Gramm released his first solo album, Ready or Not, which receivedcritical acclaim and contained a top five hit single with “Midnight Blue”. This wasfollowed by the late-1987 Foreigner album Inside Information, which reachednumber 15 on Billboard’s album chart. The extracted “Say You Will” was released late that year, reaching number 6 on the Hot 100 early in 1988, and “I Don’t Wantto Live Without You” followed, reaching number 5 on the Hot 100 and numberone on the adult contemporary chart in the spring. A third single, “Heart Turns toStone” reached number 56 in the summer. Eventually a second solo effort, LongHard Look, that included the top ten hit, “Just Between You and Me”, and “TrueBlue Love”, reached the Top 40. Gramm also contributed a song to thesoundtrack for the 1987 movie The Lost Boys, titled “Lost in the Shadows.” Encouraged by his solo success, Gramm left the group in 1990 to form ShadowKing with close friend and former Black Sheep bassist Bruce Turgon. The newgroup’s 1991 self-titled album was released by Atlantic Records. Despite positivereviews, the group lacked cohesiveness. It also did not enjoy the level ofmarketing and promotional support necessary to sustain a new project. ShadowKing soon disbanded. The same year, Foreigner released the album UnusualHeat, a relatively unsuccessful effort fronted by vocalist Johnny Edwards. Gramm returned to the group in 1992 to record three new songs for thecompilation, The Very Best of … and Beyond, bringing a new energy back intothe mix. Gramm also brought Bruce Turgon with him to join the Foreigner lineupat this point. In 1992, Gramm became a Born-Again Christian “after being tired of the rock ‘n’roll life and not feeling very fulfilled…I was falling prey to some of the bad habitsthat can go along with that, and I just decided that my own willpower andstrength was not enough, and [being raised a Catholic Christian], I knewthe answer was something deeper for a long time.”In 1995, Foreigner released the album Mr. Moonlight on the Rhythm Safari label which, although relatively successful in Europe, was not as widely marketedor distributed in the U.S. Still, “Until the End of Time” made inroads at adultcontemporary radio. With the changing trends in popular music, this now-classicrock band came to suffer the inevitable slowing of their genre’s momentum. In 1996, Mick Jones invited Gramm to perform backing vocals on a cover versionof “I Want to Know What Love Is” he was producing for the Australian singer TinaArena. The song went on to become a major hit again throughout Europe. In April 1997, two months after providing vocals for Christian rock band Petra’sPetra Praise 2: We Need Jesus, and on the eve the band was to leave for aJapan tour, Gramm was diagnosed with a type of brain tumor called acraniopharyngioma. Although the tumor was benign, the resulting surgerydamaged his pituitary gland. In addition, the recovery program had causedGramm to gain weight, and likewise affected his stamina and voice. He continuedto work with Jones throughout his illness and in 1999, Gramm was back touringwith Foreigner playing summer festivals and smaller markets. 2000s to present Gradually, Gramm’s health and energy have rebounded. Gramm left Foreigneragain in 2003, and has been touring the U.S., Canada, and Mexico (as well asperforming occasional dates off the continent) steadily since January 2004.

The group released two albums, and three top ten Billboard dance singles. They achieved worldwide fame, touring the U.S., Canada and Europe. Billy appeared on the 1987 debut album, of then teen sensation and eighties songstress, Debbie Gibson, Out of the Blue, combining the use of acoustic and electronic drums. The album spawned several international hits, including, “Only In My Dreams” and “Shake Your Love.” He received a triple platinum record award by the RIAA, from producer Fred Zarr for his contribution. His musical credits include television commercials, movie soundtrack albums and hundreds of 12” remixes. Billy has also performed as a special guest percussionist with Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band on several occasions. He has been associated with Modern Drummer magazine, for twenty-five years, and is currently hosting a weekly podcast. Early Life Born William Michael Amendola in Brooklyn in 1957, Billy’s father, Vincent, an Italian immigrant and naturalized citizen served the United States during WWII. He was musically inclined, playing trombone in US Navy big band. His mother, Ann, was a stay-at-home mom who managed to be supportive and attentive to Billy’s early musical aspirations despite having to care for his disabled brother, five years his senior. Like many musicians of his time, Billy was inspired to take up drumming after seeing The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. His father insisted on formal drum lessons and for his efforts, Billy was rewarded with his own kit by his grandparents. Drumming became a way for Billy to keep himself busy while his parents were occupied with the care of his brother. Career Beginnings Billy allied himself with older, local neighborhood musicians, watching and learning by imitation and by the tender age of fourteen, started his first professional band, Uncle Sam, comprised of friends, Frank DeCrescenzo and John Kaz. The group morphed into a new group, Gypsy after the addition of Jimi Braffett on guitar before finally completing the lineup in 1976 with Jimmy Maer on guitar, vocals and keyboards, calling the band, Mantus. Although the band mostly played rock covers of the day, they were always composing original music. They became popular performing at clubs, block parties and high school dances in and around the New York City metro area before moving to larger venues and hotels out of state. By 1977, Mantus was playing at CBGB’s with the likes of punk bands Blondie, Television and the Ramones when then New York Times music critic, John Rockwell, referred to Mantus as “one of the best rock bands to come around in a long time.” Transitioning from rock to disco came literally overnight when Mantus was playing at a virtually empty Trudie Heller’s in New York City late one night. They drifted into a half hour long version of The Commodore’s hit, “Brick House,” funking it up, much to the chagrin of the club owner but conversely to the delight of a patron, an African American gentleman, who as luck or kismet would have it, owned a small independent dance label. He offered the band an opportunity to cut a record, “Turn Around Boogie Down,’ featuring Diana Ross’ then keyboardist, Ray Chew. It was released in Canada and faired well enough to provide the band an opportunity to cut another record. Their next release, “Dance It Free Style” became a huge hit in multiple cities, charting at number two on major NY radio station WKTU for eight weeks. Mantus rode the success of their first hit, playing prestigious dance clubs across North America. The group now had a follow up album, Midnight Energy and 12” Single “Rock It To The Top” catapulting them to the top of the disco scene, playing at clubs like the legendary Studio 54, the Fun House and Roseland where they were voted “Best Up and Coming Group” in 1979. By the third single, “Boogie to the Bop,” from Mantus’ second eponymous album the group was looking to “cross over” into pop. But after mismanagement and poor handling, they left the label and returned to their rock roots, performing at their former stomping grounds. They reinvented themselves into a pop rock genre but started to dissolve slowly due to differences in musical tastes, personal demands and the responsibility of starting families. In the mid-nineties, Mantus temporarily reunited to record and perform new material. The bonds of friendship managed to supersede their rise and fall and remains strong to present day. Studio Musicianship In the late 1970’s and early 1980’s, Billy started a new journey into studio musicianship, where he pioneered the art of mixing acoustic and electronic drums, a recording breakthrough at that time. His work partnered Billy on sessions with Branford Marsalis, Najee, Paul Shaffer, Bashiri Johnson, Jocelyn Brown, Dolette McDonald, Ira Siegel and Tinkr Barfield among others. Billy paired with producers, Loris Holland, Bernie Worrell, Fred Zarr, Jellybean Benitez, John Morales, Mark Berry, Scotty Blackwell, Shep Pettibone, John Luongo and many more. A few of Billy’s album projects include, Alisha, Marlena Shaw, Nona Hendryx, Walt Williams (O’Jays), Tin Tin, Fred Schneider (B52’s), Dunn Pearson, Jr., Will Downing and on Harry Nilsson’s 2019 posthumously released album, Losst and Founnd, produced by Mark Hudson. Billy is also featured playing “the phonebook rhythm” on the first single “Another Day,”from RAM ON, the tribute record to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Paul & Linda McCartney’s RAM album coming out in May 2021. Slappers In the nineties, Billy created a specialty flat drum stick he named Slappers. Slappers offered an alternative method of creating sounds on drums and cymbals The innovative sticks have numerous playing applications including bells, blocks, bongos and timbales. The item was well received by his professional colleagues. Modern Drummer Billy’s career path took another turn when family and fatherhood made touring and time away from home a less than a desirable way to make a living. Having been a spotlighted artist of Modern Drummer magazine, a monthly publication targeting the interests of drummers and percussionists, Billy often freelanced the journal’s famed festivals as an artist liaison. Over several years, Billy developed a close relationship with Modern Drummer founder and publisher, Ron Spagnardi. Spagnardi was impressed with the connections and associations that Billy had built during his storied career in the music industry and in 1997, Billy began working in an official capacity for the periodical. He began as an Adverting Assistant, utilizing his relationships with drum makers to increase the publication’s advertising revenue. Billy’s rapport with artists and manufacturers alike made him an invaluable asset. Billy made a profound impact in delivering his passion for music and most especially drumming through the magazine’s platform. Spagnardi served as mentor to Billy, grooming him to take on more responsibility at Modern Drummer. With this guidance, he quickly moved up the ranks to Associate Editor and presently Editor At Large. In 2003, Ron Spagnardi sadly passed away, shortly after Billy’s rise within the publication. Amendola Today Billy has reinvented himself over and over throughout his sustained and successful career, from live performer, songwriter, studio musician and music magazine editor while staying true to himself and his origins. His resilience keeps him pertinent in a constantly changing industry. In 2018, coming full circle, Mantus’ commemorated the 40th anniversary of the release of their first record by reuniting and recording a new album, EST 1976. The LP features nine new original songs and was produced by Billy’s son, Matty Amendola, who has followed in his father’s musical footsteps, boasting his own professional success. Butch Jones, who worked on their first single and album forty years earlier, returned to serve as engineer on this most recent project. EST 1976 was lauded by both fans and the industry alike. Music Connection magazine gave the album a coveted 9/10 review. Mantus received accolades from preeminent musical peers on this latest collaboration. Giving Back Inspired by his love of the art rather than the laurels, Billy has helped launch the careers of innumerable performers. He advocates for the rights of musicians, striving to help new artists to the forefront while encouraging established artists to remain relevant and seek the respect they deserve. He acted as consultant and co-host for David Fishof’s Rock N’ Roll Fantasy Camp, where attendees play, write and record music in professional rehearsal and recording studios alongside music industry legends. Billy lent his acumen to author/photographer, Jules Follett, on her book, Sticks n’ Skins, a photojournalistic essay spotlighting drummers and their craft. He subsequently served on the advisory board of The Sessions, a foundation which focuses on empowering artists through education and real-world advice. Billy is also an advisory board member of Little Kids Rock, a charitable organization which provides free music instruction and instruments to public school districts across the country. Over 1,000,000 youngsters currently participate in LKR programs nationwide. Having spent forty plus years in the industry, Billy has experienced the ins and outs of music, media and marketing making him an ideal choice to provide creative yet practical techniques and strategies for both budding and established artists.\n\nPattie Brooks is an American singer most frequently associated with the disco era. She was born in Fort Riley, Kansas to a military family. Her first break came in 1968 when she auditioned for the chorus on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour”. In the next decade she became a sought-after backing singer, appearing on the Bobby Darin Show and touring with, among others Helen Reddy. She sang backing on Donna Summer’s “I Remember Yesterday” album. In the mid-1970s Brooks came to the attention of disco producer Simon Soussain and her solo recording career was born. Her first of four albums on the Casablanca label was 1977’s Love Shook (the album was credited as Pattie Brooks & The Simon Orchestra), and the whole album peaked at #2 on the US Dance Club Play Chart. Pattie remained with Soussain and in 1978 recorded her biggest club hit, “After Dark”. This was selected to be part of the soundtrack to the film Thank God It’s Friday and as the soundtrack topped the club play charts, Pattie’s contribution was up there with friend and stablemate Donna Summer’s “Last Dance” as the most celebrated tracks. “After Dark” was the mainstay of Pattie’s second album (now with sole billing) Our Ms Brooks. In 1979 Pattie moved away from Soussain as her third album Party Girl was produced by Bunny Sigler of Instant Funk and Salsoul fame. The result was a far more varied album that encompassed funk, pop and a big ballad as well as pure disco. While the album spawned no huge singles it did include “Got To Go Disco”, the title song from a notorious Broadway flop musical. In 1979 Pattie branched out from disco by singing “Close Enough For Love”, the title song to the Vanessa Redgrave movie Agatha. By 1980 the disco backlash had taken effect in the USA, and Pattie’s fourth and last Casablanca offering Pattie Brooks was very much a pop-soul affair, produced this time by Michael Smith. No hits were forthcoming and Pattie left Casablanca. She returned in 1982 on the Mirage label with a fifth album In My World, produced by Sandy Linzer. The album reflected the popular styles of the time, and produced a moderate club hit in the dance-rock tinged “Doctor Ruth” and a minor R&B hit in the ballad “Every Time I Turn Around”. This turned out to be Pattie’s last album, although she remained active in terms of one-off singles. In 1983 she was signed by Backstreet Records, releasing the minor club hit “Get It On And Have A Party” and featured prominently on the soundtrack to the film Doctor Detroit, including two duets with its star Dan Aykroyd. In the mid-1980s Pattie released singles on the Easy Street label, including a contribution to the 1985 Emilio Estevez movie That Was Then… This Is Now. In 1988 she surfaced on another label, Waterwheel with the maxi-single “Function At The Junction”. At this point Pattie returned to backup singing and advertising jingles. In 2006 the Nu Improved label remixed Pattie’s greatest hit “After Dark” and issued a CD single with up to the minute remixes, the single was well received and spent several weeks on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. In 2011, Brooks followed up this hit with the single “It’s All About the Music”. She continues to record and tour. Her daughter Yvette Marine is a member of the Mary Jane Girls.

Casablanca Records career[edit] In the mid-1970s Brooks came to the attention of disco producer Simon Soussain, and her solo recording career was born. Her first of four albums on the Casablanca label was 1977’s Love Shook[1] (credited as Pattie Brooks & The Simon Orchestra), the album peaked at #2 on the US Dance Chart.[2] Brooks remained with Soussain and in 1978 recorded her biggest club hit, “After Dark”. It was selected to be part of the soundtrack to the film Thank God It’s Friday, which topped the club play charts (#1 for six weeks).[3] “After Dark” was the mainstay of Brooks’s second album, Our Ms. Brooks.[4] The album also included the hit “This Is The House Where Love Died” and reached #22 on the US Dance Charts.[5] In 1979 Brooks moved away from Soussain with her third album, Party Girl,[6] produced by Bunny Sigler of Instant Funk and Salsoul fame.[7] This album included a wider range of sounds – funk, pop, disco and ballads. While the album contained no major hits it did include “Got Tu Go Disco”, the title song from the short-lived Broadway musical. The 12″ single peaked at No. 67 on the US Dance Charts.[5] In 1979 Brooks branched out from disco by singing “Close Enough For Love”, the title song to the Vanessa Redgrave movie Agatha. By 1980, when a disco backlash had hit the industry in the US, Brooks’s fourth and last Casablanca offering, Pattie Brooks,[8] was more of a pop-soul affair, produced this time by Michael Lovesmith. No hits were forthcoming, and Brooks left Casablanca. Post-disco activity[edit] She returned in 1982 on the Mirage label with a fifth album, In My World,[9] produced by Sandy Linzer. The album reflected the popular styles of the time, and produced a moderate club hit with the dance-rock tinged “Dr. Ruth” and a minor R&B hit with the ballad “Every Time I Turn Around”. The album was remastered and released as a compact disc on the Funky Town Grooves label in 2009. This turned out to be Brooks’s last album, although she remained active in terms of one-off singles. In 1983 she was signed by Backstreet Records, releasing the minor club hit “Get It On And Have A Party”. She was featured prominently on the soundtrack to the film Doctor Detroit,[10] including two duets with its star Dan Aykroyd. In 1985 Brooks released “Lifeline Dancing” on the Easy Street label, which was featured in the Emilio Estevez movie That Was Then… This Is Now. In 1987 she surfaced on West Holly Records with “All Talk”, and in 1988 on Waterwheel Records with the maxi-single “Function at the Junction”. Following these one-off releases, Brooks returned to backup vocalist sessions and the occasional advertising jingle (most notably 1985’s “Nature Valley Granola’s Dandy Bar”). She has returned to making club appearances, including a spot at L.A.’s “Don’t Tell Mama” in November 2013. Recent activity[edit] In 1993, producer Rick Gianatos remade Brooks’s greatest hit, “After Dark.” It was released on a vinyl 12″ single b/w “Sweet Temptation.” In 2006 Gianatos issued a CD single of “After Dark” on his Nu & Improved label with up to the minute remixes. The single was well received and spent several weeks on the US club play chart. A pairing with Gianatos again in 2011 produced the track “It’s All About The Music,” also released on the Nu & Improved label. This was available on two compact discs, one featuring the U.S remixes and another with the U.K. remixes. There were also download-only remixes, entitled “The Soul Mixes.”[11] Once again Brooks was well received and had moderate chart success. In 2013 Gianatos recorded the new dance track “I Like The Way You Move” with Brooks. The track featured backing vocals by Scherrie Payne (former “Supreme”) and Joyce Vincent Wilson and Pamela Vincent (of “Tony Orlando & Dawn” fame). This was released as a “Bonus-Exclusive” on the compilation First Ladies of Disco – Rick Gianatos Presents the Music.[12] Also in 2013, Brooks was included in the book The First Ladies Of Disco. On April 19, 2014, the video and CD-single (with ten mixes) of “I Like The Way You Move” were released. The video features a star-studded cast, including Scherrie Payne, Charlo Crossley[13] and Peggi Blu.[14] Brooks’ daughter Yvette (Marine) Barlow was a member of the Mary Jane Girls.\n\nThe Sweethearts of Sigma: Carla L. Benson, Evette Benton and Barbara Ingram THE SWEETHEARTS OF SIGMA aka THE SWEETIES, Tommy’s Girls, The Philadelphia Angels, The Girls, Alpha Angels. Carla Benson, Evette Benton and Barbara Ingram were all born and raised in Camden, New Jersey and have been together for as long as they can remember. Carla Benson and the late Barbara Ingram are first cousins and Evette Benton and Carla are best friends since early childhood. They were invited to audition for the world famous song writer, producer and arranger Thom Bell while still in their teens and immediately became an integral part of the Sound of Philadelphia. In the Music World where background singers’ careers last approximately five years, two cousins and a best friend, managed to maintain a successful career over 20 years. They were nicknamed several times. First known as ” Tommy’s Girls,”-references to Thom Bell who, after discovering them, subsequently took them under his wings then, “The Sweethearts of Sigma, and ” The Philadelphia Angels,”-references to Sigma Sound Studios, the studio playground for producers Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff and Thom Bell, and to Philadelphia International Records, masters of Philly soul and many other producers. They were also frequently referred to as simply “The Girls” and “Alpha Angels” references to Alpha Studio also in Philadelphia. Later in 1984, the Sweethearts were on tour with Patti LaBelle when Ms. LaBelle and her Musical Director, Budd Ellison soon took to calling them, “The Sweeties,” and have been quoted saying, “They’re the best in the business. Working with them was just like playing a finely tuned instrument.” The name stuck and since that time, Barbara, Carla and Evette have been known as “The Sweeties.” The sing along riffs the public associates with a hit are often performed not by the star, but the background singers: that’s Carla Benson, Evette Benton and Barbara Ingram whom people hum along with on Billy Paul’s “Me and Mrs. Jones”, McFadden & Whitehead’s “Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now”, Patti LaBelle’s “New Attitude”, If Only You Knew” & “On My Own” and cuts by Teddy Pendergrass, the O’Jays, Lou Rawls, Salsoul Orchestra, MFSB, Jerry Butler, Archie Bell & the Drells, the Stylistics, the Spinners, Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes, Elton John, Dionne Warwick, France Joli, Charo, Englebert Humperdink, Grace Jones, Johnny Mathis, Deniece Williams, Dick Jenson, Evelyn “Champagne” King, -plus many, many more. (Jan Hoffman, the Village Voice) The Sweethearts of Sigma, as they were originally known, soon rose to the top of their field causing Ms. Magazine to list them among the Record Industries, “TOP 40 MUSIC MOGULS,” and TODAY magazine, (the Philadelphia Inquirer) included them in their timely and informative article entitled- “The THINKING PERSON’S WOMAN.” In 1972, the late Barbara Ingram, after returning from a tour as a Raylette for Ray Charles, learned some exciting news from her sister “Frankie”. Frankie had a friend who was married to an up and coming composer and producer named Thom Bell. She learned that this Thom Bell, along with two of his friends, Leon Huff and Kenny Gamble, were in the process of forming a new record company. Ms. Ingram and Thom Bell’s co-writer, Linda Creed sang a few background vocals for Bell and Creed’s first project for a group called The Stylistics. It was then that Thom Bell told her if she knew of 2 other ladies who could really sing, that they may be able to make some money by doing studio work singing for this new company which was to be named Philadelphia International Records. Barbara called her cousin, Carla, whom she’d heard singing an aria in high school a few months earlier and told her about the new company. She asked her if she knew anyone else who could sing, that might want to do this with them. By then, Carla was enrolled in her first semester at Glassboro State College, now Rowan University, studying, Voice. Carla’s roommate was her very best childhood friend, Evette Benton, who was a fabulous alto and was majoring in Special Education. Carla and Evette had sung together all through high school, under the direction of Dr. James E. Mumford. They also were members of a well known local gospel group called, “The Arneld Dupree Singers”, under the direction of Arneld “Chucky” Dupree. So, when Barbara asked her if she knew of anyone else, Carla replied, “yeah, she’s sitting right here!” The three ladies met and discussed the exciting proposition. After some initial hesitation by Evette, Barbara set up the audition and off they went to the offices above the old Shubert Theater, now The Merriam Theater, on Broad Street in Philadelphia. In all the excitement, they never prepared a song to sing for the audition! According to Evette, “As we drove over the bridge to Philadelphia we realized we’d never sung together, and had not prepared a song for an audition!” Scrambling for a song they all knew that they could do together, they remembered a song called “MacArthur’s Park”, a popular song at that time, and came up with the idea to sing the bridge of that song-“There will never be another song for me, for I will sing it; There will be another dream for me, someone will bring it.” So they practiced it in three part harmony, 15 minutes away before arriving at the audition. They were greeted by Thom Bell and he led the girls to his office and everyone spent the better part of an hour chatting and getting to know one another. Finally, Thom asked them to sing for him individually. Evette sang “I Got Love”- from the Broadway Musical “Purlie” and Barbara sang “A House Is Not A Home”. Thom looked at Carla, for her to sing a song, she nervously replied, “I don’t sing much R & B, but pull out an aria and I’ll work it for you!” Bell laughingly suggested they sing something together. They cleared their throats, Barbara established the melody, Carla, jumped on the high harmony and Evette held down the bottom. As they sang that bridge to “MacArthur’s Park” in that small office that fateful day, something magical happened. What the girls came to call “The God-Sent Blend” was born. Thom Bell left his office at least 10 times and came back with every producer in the building, instructing the girls each time to “sing that again!” After about 45 minutes of singing those same 8 bars over and over, Mr. Leon Huff returned and asked them if they wanted to do a session. They were ecstatic and said, “yeah, when?” Huff said tomorrow night at midnight! “MIDNIGHT?” they screeched! Huff stated, “If you want to be in the music business, you gotta get used to the hours”. And that’s how it began. Their first session was for “Joe Simon” and it was a song called “Pool of Bad Luck”, which was an irony because it was anything but bad luck for these three Camden Natives. They went on to become the official in-house background vocalists for Philadelphia International Records for almost 10 years! Their smooth blend was much sought after by Producers who flew in from all over the world to work with these ladies. Their speed for learning parts, their ability to read music when required, their ability to arrange background vocals, their professionalism and comedic antics in the studio became legendary. In 1983, Patti Labelle was looking for some new background vocalists to tour the world with her. Barbara’s brothers had been the band for Ms. LaBelle and Barbara’s brother Johnny Ingram knew the girls could get the gig; if they wanted it. So, he told Barbara, Barbara called Evette and Carla and they, again decided to go for it. Years before The Sweethearts had done background vocals for Damon Harris’, who was a former member of Temptations, new album. Budd Ellison, Ms. Labelle’s Musical Director and Patti LaBelle co-produced a couple of songs for that project and they hired, “The Girls,” to do the background vocals. They loved the Sweethearts sound, and when the time came that Miss Patti needed new background personnel, they immediately thought of “The Girls”"
