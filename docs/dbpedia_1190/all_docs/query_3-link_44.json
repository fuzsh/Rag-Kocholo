        "text": "Lil Durk is taking his 2023 smash “All My Life” global with a pair of new remixes, one featuring Nigerian superstar Burna Boy, the other boasting the hit Korean group Stray Kids.\n\nBoth artists fit seamlessly on the uplifting, emotional track while still bringing their own distinct styles to it. Burna Boy, for instance, delivers a poignant interpolation of the song’s hook, drawing out the melody as he sings, “All my life, they tryna put me on my knees/All my life, I try not to waste precious time, waste my precious time/I choose to speak life.”\n\nMeanwhile, all eight members of Stray Kids contribute to their remix. Seungmin, Bang Chan, Lee Know, and I.N combine for the first verse, which is delivered in English, while Changbin, Hyunjin, Felix, and Han jointly deliver the final verse, which is largely in Korean.\n\nTrending\n\n“All My Life” — which also features a guest verse from J. Cole — was the lead single from Lil Durk’s 2023 album, Almost Healed, and easily his biggest song of the year, peaking at Number Two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Almost Healed was released back in May and followed Durk’s 2022 LP, 7220."
