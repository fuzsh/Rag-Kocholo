Director Monte Hellman, whose previous film was the cult classic TWO LANE BLACKTOP (1971) solidified his place among the New American movement with this haunting slowburn, shot in rural Georgia, which follows a stoic professional cockfighter, who conditions and battles pedigreed roosters in service to the ancient underground blood sport.\n\n“The evening is also a celebration of the film’s legendary producer, Roger Corman (who passed away in May of 2024), and who purportedly stated that COCKFiGHTER was his only film of the 1970s that he ever lost money on, perhaps due to the sensationalized subject matter.”\n\nWith stunning cinematography by Nestor Alemendros (DAYS OF HEAVEN), memorable performances by Harry Dean Stanton, Laurie Bird & Ed Begley and a quintessential soundtrack Michael Franks, this 50th anniversary screening is an absolute must-see for folks interested in forgotten cinematic treasures.\n\n“Presented by MOViES FOR MANiACS and hosted by Jesse Hawthorne Ficks along w/ very special guest Kier-la Janisse who will be on hand in-person to discuss and autograph her new book “𝘾𝙊𝘾𝙆𝙁𝙞𝙂𝙃𝙏”, that explores the film’s checkered past.

It all began years ago when Bijou Video’s Jules Zinn introduced the label to the soundtracks of the pornographic films of legendary filmmaker Steve Scott and gay superstar Al Parker. It wasn’t until The Magazine’s Bob Mainardi gifted a cassette copy of the soundtrack to the film TURNED ON—a bathhouse fantasy from 1982—that the wheels started turning. The steamy, hypnotic sounds were credited only to “Forbidden Overture…” but who was that? This question remained unanswered for some time, and countless hours of research, Venn diagramming, and elaborate flow charts all proved fruitless. It wasn’t until a chance screening of BAD GIRLS DORMITORY, a 1986 women-in-prison movie from gay porn director Joe Gage that happened to reuse some of the same music did the answer become clear: Forbidden Overture was none other than the mighty Man Parrish!​The soundtrack to TURNED ON consists of two epic side-long pieces, both of which employ classic Man Parrish production techniques. “Primal Overture” slinks along with brooding pads and ominous chords, building and oozing throughout its 27 minute runtime like a sultrier Goblin soundtrack. “Strictly Forbidden” takes a similar groove to a major key, but it’s optimistic chirp conceals a wry, mysterious wink. Says director Steve Scott: “It took us about two weeks to find the right piece for the jockstrap scene. But it’s like anything else—you know when it’s right.” TURNED ON is an exciting musical rediscovery as well as a vital document of queer history.\n\nWith an espresso pop-up from Hi-NRG in the lobby!\n\nDoors at 7:00 PM | Film at 7:30 PM\n\nView Event →\n\nSAVING FACE W/ DIRECTOR ALICE WU Q&A: 7:30pm\n\nWil (Michelle Krusiec) is a lesbian, but she not dare tell her widowed mother, Hwei-lan (Joan Chen), or her very traditional grandparents.

A native of Baltimore, Maryland, Linda started writing music in the late 1970s, inspired by Young Marble Giants and The Raincoats, drawn to their untrained, fuss-free approach because “there seemed to be a sincerity in their music”. Linda strived to do the same and in the 1980s started playing guitar in a band called Woods. Living in New York, she’d purchase a 4-track recorder in order to record demos before playing them to other members of the band, but soon she realised these songs weren’t for sharing. Instead she started crafting her own cassettes, thoughtfully putting together albums, which without a record label, were heard by relatively few people. “I felt like a rarity in that world,” explained Linda years later, upon realising that she was one of the women working within the small but dedicated home-taper network. “Most, if not all the people, who contacted me about my music in the old days, were male.”\n\nWithout commercial pressure, Linda’s sound was as personal as they come, undiluted by the whims of a producer, label or engineer and instead a pure expression of her own feeling and state of mind. It’s this that makes songs like the dreamy ‘I So Liked The Spring’ even more affecting, it’s loved-up lyricism trickling over hypnotic guitar as Linda sings: “I so liked the spring last year/Because you were here.”\n\nNow of course, everyone from Grimes to Billie Eilish have recorded in their bedrooms, but 35 years ago home taping was deeply subversive, a chance for an artist to do things their way and share it with others without the need for a middleman. Of course, in the days before SoundCloud could beam your music into the homes of millions, this was hard work. A one woman cottage industry, Linda would make her own tapes to sell or to trade with other bedroom recording artists, designing covers and assembling the albums, too.\n\n\"Essentially this is the best bedroom-pop you are ever likely to hear, directly from an age that did not really know what to do with it.\" (JanglePopHub.)\n\nMusic | Linda Smith (bandcamp.com)\n\nApril Magazine:\n\nApril Magazine combines the talents of a handful of Bay Area indie pop notables into a collective that releases fragile and noisy songs that land right in the sweet spot between The Velvet Underground hum and The Pastels warble with a heavy dose of slowcore static in the mix. A string of digital singles primed listeners for the group's sound; late 2021 brought both a collection of said releases -- If the Ceiling Were a Kite, Vol. 1 -- and their first LP, Sunday Music for an Overpass.\n\nMusic | April Magazine (bandcamp.com)\n\nDOORS 7:00 | MUSIC 8:00\n\nView Event →\n\nRAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK: 10am Popcorn Palace & 1pm & 9pm\n\nEpic tale in which an intrepid archaeologist tries to beat a band of Nazis to a unique religious relic which is central to their plans for world domination.

From a musical legacy that chronicles a long list of minor triumphs and major tragedies— the continued saga of The Reds, Pinks & Purples stands tall as the encapsulation of Donaldson's own proliferation and prestige ever since its emergence in the late 2010s.\n\n\"Unwishing Well\" pontificates on the promiscuity of the pop machines’ propped up and exploited brand ambassadors with the cutting \"Your Worst Song is Your Greatest Hit,\" or the collective commissaries of commerce exhibitionism on \"Public Art,\" to auditing the forums of obsessive fandom with \"Learning to Love a Band.\" \"What's Going on with Ordinary People\" balks with concern over contemporary states of regressive trends, while \"Faith in Daydreaming Youth\" questions what hope and valor can be found in the new pop culture vanguards that govern the world's sovereign daydream nations. The dustbins of dastardly discontinuity are imbued with desire and grief on \"Dead Stars in Your Eyes,\" to the discarded ditches of obscurity on \"Nothing Between the Lines at All.\" The human addiction to languishing in anguish, misery and negativity tussles, tosses and turns on \"We Only Hear the Bad Things People Say,\" the penultimate ode to inherent human fallibility as \"Goodbye Bobby\" rides out into the gilded sunset glow.\n\nThe central set piece of \"Unwishing Well\" revolves around the title track that wrestles with wellness and wishes tempered by the sobering reality of ultra pragmatic skepticism. \"Unwishing Well\" is a reflection of us, the icons we adore, the Adonises we worship, the false prophets that proselytize the edicts from theses cults of personality, the fallouts, the third acts and the artistic fabrics that spool these sub-sects of artful dodgers into the stuff of legend. Glenn once again uplifts and uproots the undercurrents that carry the commonalities between the spectators and the spectacles.\n\nCindy:\n\nMusic | Cindy (bandcamp.com)\n\nView Event →\n\nWET, HOT AMERICAN SUMMER ~ 3:00 PM & 8:00 PM\n\nSet on the last day of camp, in the hot summer of 1981, \"Wet Hot American Summer\" follows a group of counselors who are each trying to complete their unfinished business before the day ends.
