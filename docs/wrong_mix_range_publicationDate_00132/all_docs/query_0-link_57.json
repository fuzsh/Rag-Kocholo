        "text": "Some of us own more age than others which fails to make us superior but does provide longer memories. Yesterday (Jan 9), I was scanning through Mike Resnick’s books available on Kindle. I do like Resnick’s books! I came to a title that intrigued me. So, I clicked on it. Turns out Resnick’s contribution was a delightful Foreword. I finished the book this morning, the speed attributed to the amazing bibliographies therein.\n\nThere is a preface to the book wherein the author discusses criticism versus reviewing and exemplifies his thoughts on the matter by discussing the critiques of James Blish. I have spent my reading life avoiding literary critiques. My exposure to such in high school left no desire to continue the pain. I can gladly inform that the author causes only the pain of having missed a book he presents. I lived with these books, I knew these authors (though not personally), read many of them, ignored more (to my regret) and discovered all too many I have missed but I go forward with the intent to correct my behavior.\n\nSo, let me tell you why you should read this book. I’m going to take my time and it will take several posts to cover it all. Even if you find my nattering annoying, you should purchase this book. You deserve to know what you may have missed.\n\nPast Masters: & Other Bookish Natterings .Bud Webster, ReAnimus Press. Kindle Edition.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Bud Webster is a prize-winning poet, science fiction historian, and writer. He has been buying and selling sf and fantasy for almost 40 years, beginning with comics and soon graduating to real books, the ones that have more words than pictures. Most of his working career has been spent in retail of one sort or another, and his bookselling experience ranges from large book store chains to independent specialty bookshops. Over the years, Bud’s supplemented his hard-won knowledge of the field by poring over his personal reference library and by consulting those even more obsessed than he. Along the way he also proved he paid attention while reading all of those books by selling fiction and nonfiction to a variety of markets including Analog and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. His column, Anthropology 101, currently runs in the Bulletin of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Bud’s one of few living Americans who can properly be called an award-winning epic poet. He lives in sin in Central Virginia with an understanding woman and three furiously neurotic damn cats (aren’t they all?).\"\n\nNow, on to his columns:\n\nMars\n\nA literary history of Mars, good and bad, and why it seems to grab my imagination. Start in 1656 with\n\nItinerarium Exstaticum. Continue in 1787 with The Earths In Our Solar System and then go forward to 1874 and Aleriel, or A Voyage to Other Worlds. I have not read these books, did not know they existed but now I have an itch. That’s merely the beginning of the history. The late 1800s developed a small library of Mars stories and I have only read one of them: The War of the Worlds.\n\nMoving into the 20th Century, we get to A Princess of Mars and I discover it was published under a pseudonym of Norman Bean. For some reason I find that fact satisfying. I report that I ignored C.S. Lewis Out of the Silent Planet never realizing it took place on Mars. It wouldn’t have mattered as the the thematic matter did not appeal. Speaking of themes, in the 1800s Martians were bad guys. In the 20th Century, acknowledging a few radio programs still thought they were evil, a trend started making them good guys.\n\nWe end the 20th Cenury with Kim Stanley Robinson’s Colorful Mars stories which I have not read as I could never get past the blurb on the cover. My problem; not Kim’s. As Bud says: “...and just for giggles, I’ve made a list of what I consider to be the 100 best story titles that mention Mars, and here they are:\n\n“A Martian Sends a Postcard Home”\n\n“All the Beer on Mars”\n\n“An Occurrence on the Mars-to-Earth Run”\n\n“Are There “Bears” on Mars?”\n\n“Arthur Sternbach Brings the Curveball to Mars” et al.\n\nMy personal favorite is a coin-toss “The Toad Prince or, Sex Queen of the Martian Pleasure-Domes” or “Rise and Fall of Paco Cohen and the Mariachis of Mars”\n\nSo much for Mars.\n\nWay Up in the Middle of the Air,\n\nAnd now we take up the biography of our first Past Master, George Adamski. If you are a fan of UFOs and their alien passengers, then the information provided here will fascinate you. I enjoyed it but I am not a fan since I did read Ancient Astronauts and John Gribbon’s The Jupiter Effect. Gribbon has some good fact filled books. For me. Not so much for Jupiter Effect. Despite this blah introduction, I did enjoy the biography and can almost sympathize with Bud and definitely do not begrudge him his memories.\n\nBud did provide a list of the 36 best titles with saucer in the name. Once again, I give you a flavor:\n\n“A Flying Saucer with Minnesota Plates”\n\n“A Saucer Has Landed… Probably”\n\n“A Saucer of Loneliness”\n\n“Captain Starlight and the Flying Saucer”\n\n“Cassidy’s Saucer”\n\n“Dennis and the Flying Saucer” (Ought to be about Dennis the Menace)\n\n“Eight Things Not to Do When the Alien Steps Out of Its Saucer” et al\n\nI do appreciate the latter title. Good manners are important but I like “I Did Too See a Flying Saucer” as I can envision one of my great grand daughters stomping her foot, gnashing her teeth and saying something just like that.\n\nSince this is 2083 I should pay more attention to the news.\n\nTBC\n\nPast Masters - Part II\n\nNelson Bond\n\nMy first introduction to this author and the back story convinces me to add his work to my to-be-read list. His advice to the author of this book shakes me up...a lot! He advised Bud (and me a half century too late); (“Remember,” he told me more than once. “Great stories aren’t written, they’re re-written.”). Character names such as Squaredeal Sam McGhee, Pat Pending, and Horse-Sense Hank beg you to get to know them. Consider the titles n his cv:\n\nMr. Merganthwirker’s Lobblies – Coward-McCann 1946\n\nExiles of Time – Prime Press 1949, Paperback Library 1965\n\nThe Thirty-First of February – Gnome Press 1949\n\nThe Remarkable Exploits of Lancelot Biggs, Spaceman – Doubleday 1950, Wildside 2000\n\nThe Postal Stationary of Canada – Herman Herst 1953\n\nNo Time Like the Future – Avon 1954\n\nNightmares and Daydreams – Arkham House 1968\n\nThe Far Side of Nowhere – Arkham House 2002\n\nThat Worlds May Live – Wildside 2003\n\nOther Worlds Than Ours – Arkham House 2005\n\nThe Thirty-First of February and The Postal Stationary of Canada, in particular, have generated a fierce desire to know what they have to say. Thanks, Bud. I needed that.\n\nZenna Henderson, People Person\n\nI remember reading one of her stories back in the “60s but I cannot recall the specific which one. Her name triggers a recall of time and feelings well spent but, then for reasons I do not recall, I never read another. The back story here convinces me to go back and correct a big mistake. Look at all the books I have to read – if I can find them.\n\nWhy? Because Bud said so: “As should all of you out there reading this. Trust me; I wouldn’t waste my time or yours with hacks or those numberless writers who’ve been forgotten for good reason. If I bring ‘em up here, it’s because I think they’re in danger of fading from the SF Consciousness forever, and it’s my job to do what I can to prevent that.”\n\nGats, Six-Guns and Blasters\n\nThe back story here has a terrific biographical opening and if you haven’t met the protagonist before, either personally or in her writing. Shame on us. Check this quote: “It’s 1944, and Howard Hawks has just hired William Faulkner to write the screenplay for Raymond Chandler’s The Big Sleep. Thinking about who to bring on as collaborator, he remembers reading an outstanding hardboiled novel titled No Good from a Corpse. “Get me that Brackett guy,” he tells an assistant. Surprised when an attractive young woman shows up, he hires her anyway, beginning a long relationship.”\n\nHer name was Leigh Bracket and you must read Bud’s back story. She’s the kind of lady my mother wanted my sisters to grow up to be. Listen to the end of a Robert Silverberg quote: “What was significant was the complete sweetness of her tone as she told Harlan to put a lid on it. Truly ladylike, which was amusing when you consider that Leigh was a broad-shouldered, athletic-looking woman with a fine two-fisted outlook on the world. ‘Little old lady’ indeed!” Again, read the back story to discover the significance of the entire quote. It’s all there.\n\nInstead of re-writing Bud’s story, just get a taste of her work by checking out her screen plays:\n\nThe Vampire’s Ghost (1945, screenplay and story)\n\nThe Big Sleep (1946, screenplay)\n\nCrime Doctor’s Man Hunt (1946)\n\nRio Bravo (1959, screenplay)\n\nCheckmate (one episode, “Face in the Window” 1960, story and teleplay)\n\nGold of the Seven Saints (1961)\n\n13 West Street (1962, from her 1957 novel, The Tiger Among Us)\n\nHatari! (1962)\n\nThe Alfred Hitchcock Hour (2 episodes, “Terror at Northfield” and “Death of a Cop”, both 1963) Man’s Favorite Sport? (1964, uncredited draft polish)\n\nEl Dorado (1966, screenplay)\n\nRio Lobo (1970)\n\nThe Long Goodbye (1973, screenplay)\n\nArcher (1 episode, “The Body Beautiful”, 1975)\n\nThe Rockford Files (1 episode, “The Four Pound Brick”, 1975)\n\nStar Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980, screenplay, finished by Laurence Kasdan)\n\nFor myself, I never got past the cover blurbs but Oh, I loved her movies.\n\nForest of Incandescent Bliss\n\nI won’t explain the title, the explanation is in the book. But it refers to Cordwainer Smith and Bud believes he was the best there ever was. I can’t agree or dispute the notion because I have never read the man. Bud makes me want to. Another to-be-read list will now be constructed. Cordwainer Smith’s backstory herein is astounding. It makes me want to have known the man.\n\nEvidently, he was quite familiar with leprosy and his own ill health. The knowledge seeps into his stories which has me wondering if Stephen R. Donaldson, a man with his own astounding biography, was influenced by Smith.\n\nLook at the titles of his stories and try not to be mesmerized into buying them. I can’t.\n\n“War No. 81-Q” – June 1928 The Adjutant\n\n“Scanners Live In Vain” – January 1950 Fantasy Book (#6)\n\n“The Game Of Rat And Dragon” – October 1955 Galaxy\n\n“Mark Elf” – May 1957 Saturn (as “Mark XI”)\n\n“The Burning Of The Brain” – October 1958 If – Worlds of Science Fiction\n\n“Western Science Is So Wonderful” – December 1958 If—Worlds of Science Fiction\n\n“No, No, Not Rogov!” – February 1959 If—Worlds of Science Fiction\n\n“Nancy” – March 1959 Satellite Science Fiction (as “The Nancy Routine”)\n\n“When The People Fell” – April 1959 Galaxy\n\n“Golden The Ship Was – Oh! Oh! Oh!” – April 1959 Amazing Science Fiction (with Genevieve Linebarger)\n\n“Angerhelm” – June 1959 Star Science Fiction No. 6 (ed. Frederik Pohl, Ballantine)\n\n“The Fife Of Bodhidharma” – June 1959 Fantastic\n\n“The Lady Who Sailed The Soul” – April 1960 Galaxy (with Genevieve Linebarger)\n\nCan someone please explain to me why I looked at his books but never had the inclination to read them?\n\nTBC\n\nPast Masters - Part III (at least three to follow)\n\nPiper at the Gates\n\nI was aware of H. Beam Piper’s work. I was thoroughly impressed in 1962 by Little Fuzzies but not enough to follow through on the series. Why? Probably the covers, titles and blurbs. Hey, in 1962 I was twenty-one years old. What did I know about anything literary?\n\nAnyway, despite my lacks I did read Little Fuzzies and went back to it 40 years later and found it not quite as brilliant as the first time. It wasn’t the writing as much as the politics’ The second time through they were a bit more strident than I liked.\n\nAnd then there was the title Lone Star Planet. I grew up in Arizona which installed in me a discomfort with anything Texan. I was stationed in Texas twice and it almost cured me. Then we moved back to Arizona and I returned to normalcy. Now, Bud has me re-thinking my attitude. I may be required to construct another to-be-read list. The obstacle to overcome is my relative discomfort with time travel stories and Piper has a bunch.\n\nStill I Persist in Wondering\n\nMeet Edgar Pangborn as Bud tells it: “And here my meager skills as a critic fail me, because Pangborn’s prose is so lovely, so human, that it defies any attempt on my part to describe it adequately. In the long run, it would be simpler for me to hand you a copy of the book and watch as you read it.”\n\nI know I read Angel’s Egg in the June 1951 Galaxy magazine. For the nine-year old boy it was a breath-taking bite of time. My problem today “the winds of time have chilled me to the bone, and all I have to keep me warm are my memories, which get a little older and a little colder every day.” (I wish I could have written that last bit but memory of Angel’s Egg prompted me to paraphrase Resnick & Robyn.)\n\nI know I read Harlan Ellison’s Dangerous Visions in which Pangborn’s The Life and the Clay\n\nappears but, damn it all, I can’t remember.\n\nAnother TBR to be constructed.\n\nIt's Not the Length, It's What You Do With It\n\nNow here is Bud’s truly fine introduction and ya’ll just sit back and ponder same:\n\n‘A few years ago as turtles reckon time, it became popular for ‘net writers to write something called “flash” fiction, stories of fewer than a thousand words. Quick, in-your-face, and sharply pointed—or so flash writers fondly believed. Most of the time, they were obvious, tepid, overblown and, as Prof. F. Leghorn would have put it, about as sharp as a bowling ball. Bowling ball, that is.\n\nAnd of course, the practitioners of said literary form considered themselves, quod erat demonstrandum, sine qua non (and non-compos mentis) absolutely on the Cutting Edge of Literature. After all, they were doing it online, right?”\n\nHaving traversed that mine field, we get to the story of one Fredric Brown, an author of whom I’ve never heard. He wrote short stories, please re-read the title to this section because his name is associated with the classic: long: “The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door…” Bud claim’s it’s not a story but we have had that argument over and over over in the Writing thread.\n\nHe wrote “Answer” two years before Asimov produced “The Last Question.” Asimove ran to 7,500 words. “Answer” is 222 words.\n\nSo, all of us who love the micro- and flash fiction contests over in the Writing thread must now construct a TBR for Fredric Brown, sit down and read those stories, and learn what we may be able to do better. Oh yeah, definitely check out the bibliography Bud provides and either fix yourself a decent Beefeater martini or go hide in the closet for a day or two.\n\nCyril With an M A Kuttner\n\nI had a light and infrequent friendship with Cyril M A Kuttner. Of course I read The Little Black Bag in Astounding magazine in 1950 (at age 9), The Silly Season in 1950; and The Marching Morons in Galaxy 1951. Scrolling through the bibliography, I am astonished that I recognize none of the other titles. Maybe I had learned what I needed to learn from those three stories and moved on to Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke. Maybe! More likely poor memory and other interests.\n\nStill, Bud’s comments on the quality of his writing do inspire curiosity. How can you ignore “His noteworthiness wasn’t limited to his sour outlook, though. His stories may lack sentimentality, but they certainly don’t lack humanity. The titular object in “The Little Black Bag” transforms its finder, Dr. Full, from a shattered drunk into a man again capable of feeling something other than a desperate need for another bottle of wine, back into a physician with the firm intent to use the contents of the magic case to do once again what he had always done best: heal the sick. Simple bitterness wouldn’t give an author the range to create that character and make him breathe; it takes a clear understanding of, as well as a real affection for, people.\n\nAnother TBR to be constructed.\n\nPast Masters - Part IV\n\nA Kuttner Above the Rest (But Wait, There’s Moore!)\n\nMarried a year before I graced our planet with my presence, Henry Kuttner and Catherine L. Moore collaborated from 1939 to 1957. Their joint output is phenomenal . From Barry Malzberg: Their styles meshed totally…they were the greatest collaborative writers in the history of collaboration. Like Gilbert & Sullivan, Frazier & Ali, the 1978 Red Sox and Yankees they brought out the best in one another.” It is too bad to note that TLWSHLWM has no interest in sff. Despite our half-century together, the closesr she has come to collaborating with me was editing Sue Boulton and My Seven Threads. Evidently, that cured her.\n\nI remember viewing covers by these authors, reading the blurbs but my mind was elsewhere. Scanning their bibliographies I recognize no title. Where was my mind? Reading everything (and I do mean everything) Heinlein and Asimov produced, a spattering of Hemingway, some Verne, all of Ayn Rand. all of John Hersey and John Steinbeck, most of John O’Hara, a couple of Harold Robbins, half of James Michener, all of Allen Drury. Well, you get the idea.\n\nThough their accomplishments are impressive, even dear old Bud didn’t cause me to hurry off another TBR. Maybe some day after I read what I really want to read.\n\nLet Me Be Frank (or, Welcome to the Allamagoosa Russell-Palooza!)\n\nBud’s take on Eric Frank Russell begins with a quote of Russell’s on the back cover of his 1954 novel Deep Space. “Age forty-seven, look like fifty-seven, feel like thirty-seven, act like twenty-seven, think like seven,” he said a year earlier on the back of Sentinels of Space. “I think that is all anyone could possibly care about. Oh, yes—I fiddle around trying to write stories.” I think that’s what I should have put on the back covers of my own efforts.\n\nOf all the titles Bud provides in the bibliography, the only one I know I read and loved is Wasp. I remember it well as it led me to examine Mao’s On Guerilla Warfare, Guevara’s Guerilla Warfare, Grdovic’s A Leader’s Guide to Guerilla Warfare. It was 1970-71. I was teaching leadership to NCOs at the time. Had a lot of fun springing Wasp on the hidebound minds of some of those not gentleman by order of the Congress.\n\nBut, some times titles alone intrigue me and these certainly do. Oh well, another TBR list.\n\nThe Saga of Pelican West\n\nThe Prr-r-eet\n\nDescribe a Circle\n\n“The Sin of Hyacinth Peuch”\n\n“The Courtship of 53 SHOTL 9 G”\n\nAllamagoosa\n\nMurray Leinster's a Ten(ster), Or Deal the Lincolns Out to Will F. Jenkins\n\nPlease read the first paragraph in this column before anything else. I’ll wait. …….. Think anyone could get away with that today? Ah, the good ole days!\n\nMr. Leinster is a name I remember very clearly. Examining the bibliography supplied I cannot say the same about any of the titles. So, he was never a Heinlein, Asimov, Laumer, Chalker, Cherryh, McCafferty, Le Guin in my world. But, the memory tickles. It could have been stories in anthologies that caught my attention. Whatever, his name produces feelings of being right, that I had read him and liked him. That’s my story; I can’t prove it; but I’m sticking to it. So, let’s take a peek at the titles that intrigue me:\n\nThe Runaway Skyscraper (even though it’s a time story)\n\nThe Oldest Story in the World\n\nThe City of the Blind\n\nDe Profundus\n\nA Logic Named Joe\n\nMerrily We Roll Along (or, That’s Funny… You Don’t Look Judith)\n\nThe back story Bud provides is an education for me. I know the name Judith Merrill but I’ve never been a fan of anthologies though I’ve contributed to one or two and I did read Dangerous Visions when it came out.. What ran through my mind as I pondered her life, I realized that she was a woman who wasn’t supposed to be there. Throughout all our history books, we’re told that women had little impact over the millenia and were therefore not worth mentioning. I have an unfinished novella on the topic and research for that demonstrated very clearly how my history text books were good at concealing women’s contributions. And here was another woman whose importance I had not recognized. I know of a few truly gifted female sff authors, they’ve been there all along but Judith Merrill might be the most significant influence I’ve encountered. Three of her anthologies are now on order. You'll recogize which ones when you read the review. Love it when I look foolish all over again.\n\nThe real world and two otherp pieces interrupted this effort. I'll finish, I promise.\n\nPast Masters - Part V\n\nIn a Klass By Himself (or, Tops On a Scale of One to Tenn)\n\nI’ll begin with a Bud Webster quote that occurs in the early part of his column: Science Fiction isn’t ever about the future, even when it’s set there; it’s about the Now. I want to argue this; then, I want to broadcast it, and finally, I want to see how Fung Koo, KatG and others respond to it.\n\nOf course I met William Tenn; first in Galaxy and then on the book shelves of my favorite book stores. He never failed to give me a good read and/or a good laugh and/or a private smirk and I never failed to thank him, telepathically of course. I knew then and I know now (thanks to Karen Armstrong’s A History of God The 4,000-Year Quest Of Judaism, Christianity And Islam) only the basics of Judaism but I didn’t need to know more. Tenn taught me everything my very young self wanted to know. Scanning the bibliography was a joy and still I persist in wondering if I can resist going back for the same. Like these for example:\n\n“Venus Is a Man’s World”\n\n“Medusa Was a Lady”\n\n“Of All Possible Worlds”\n\n“On Venus, Have We Got a Rabbi”—\n\n“There Were People on Bikini There Were People on Attu”\n\nThe problem is, that when I’ve read these I’ll want to read all the others.\n\nA Logic Named Clement (or, Open the Pod Bay Doors, Hal)\n\nI met Harry Clement Stubbs in the middle 50’s when Mission of Gravity hit the stands in paper back. I read it in three or four days (I was in high school then so much of my days were filled with distractions). I was profoundly impressed with the concept and the implementation. The book had everything a young man would need to understand (I didn’t get to physics till 1958) the story but only the aliens to care about. I admired them but I didn’t develop a long term relationship.\n\nStill, impressed as I was I went out and purchased Needle. I’m sorry to say it didn’t pass my 10-page test much less a 50-page test. I just couldn’t develop an interest. I suppose as a teenager I needed some people to invest myself in. Physics was interesting but people are better. I never went back to Clement.\n\nThat written, what Bud talks about makes a lot of sense. And the man does have an interesting back story.\n\nA Martian? Odd, I See (or, a Taste of Milwaukee’s Finest)\n\nYes, I knew and know the name Stanley Weinbaum. Over the years I have met him in a hundred different settings and yet I’ve never had the urge to examine his work. A flaw in my personality. From Bud’s column I know I am being hard headed but I never found and still don’t find the inclination. So, best to ignore anything I might say and pay attention to what Bud has to say. It’s an interesting back story and I like the column’s title.\n\nThere are always titles that intrigue me and the following are like that:\n\n“The Lotus Eaters” (I’ve seen this title before but I can’t remember where.)\n\n.“Pygmalion’s Spectacles”\n\n“Revolution of 1950”\n\n“Strange Genius”\n\nSo, yeah, I’ll have to look.\n\nSecret Crocodiles and Strange Doings (or, Sometimes the Magic Really Works)\n\nWhen determining what to read, I never seek to know the author’s life history first. Except as an anecdote or so, I don’t care. So, here Bud gives us a fascinating history of R. A. Lafferty and it is a fine history at that acknowledging the authors personal flaws. But, it doesn’t inspire me to go looking for his stories. I have my own personal flaws so I’m not surprised when others do too. But what an author is like personally is not a criteria for reading his work.\n\nI agree that’s a hell of lot of output! I probably came across some of those stories but none made so deep an impression that I have instant recall. Here are some titles that intrigue me:\n\n“Adam Had Three Brothers”\n\n“The Polite People of Pudibundia”\n\n“Rainbird” (sounds familiar)\n\n“Sodom and Gomorrah, Texas” (I’ve been there.)\n\n“Maybe Jones and the City” (Got to be curious about how he got his name.)\n\n“About a Secret Crocodile”\n\n“Brain Fever Season”\n\n“Ifrit”\n\n“Apocryphal Passage of the Last Night of Count Finnegan On Galveston Island”\n\nCity Slickers, Country Bumpkins, Ants, Robots and Mutants (I Think That’s Everybody… Oh Yeah, There’s Goblins, to Say Nothing of the Banshee)\n\nHere we begin the account of Clifford Simak, the one ancient Raf admits re-reading. Interesting, as usual, back story. Phenomenal output. Continuous appearance in Galaxy and Astounding. I must have read his stories. So, why don’t I remember any specific story? He was a Grand Master for god’s sake!\n\nSo, here’s a half dozen titles that intrigue me. And Raf, if you’re reading,, could you send me a recommended list?\n\n“Rule 18”\n\n“City” (with a vague memory)\n\n“The Trouble With Ants”\n\n“Condition of Employment”\n\n“The Goblin Reservation”\n\n“Grotto of the Dancing Deer”\n\nWho?! San Diego Lightfoot Tom\n\nTom Leary is a name I do not recognize today. Maybe in the past but horror is not my thing so maybe not. From Bud’s history lesson there does seem to be good stuff lurking there. Finding the time to make the side trip is problematic. Again, look at these titles:\n\n*”San Diego Lightfoot Sue”\n\n*”Insects in Amber”\n\n”2076: Blue Eyes”\n\n“Blind Voices\n\nPast Master Natterings\n\nAt this point, we slide a bit away from the Past Masters to the Nattering Bud promised. It’s a fun read.\n\nThe Snouters\n\nYou get choices with this one and only one effort. You can read the fictitional author Harald Stimpke or the actual author Geroff Steiner. And what you read will be The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades. It is an illustrated textbook created for children to introduce to them to some of the seditious thoughts of evolution. The idea was to instill curiosity in the children. Can’t write any more as I’m off to find the book. Amazon only wants $100+ US . Still looking.\n\nAdventures to Come\n\nI am torn between just copying Bud’s one page summary or trying to get across a feel for the reviewer’s passion. Adventures to Come is an anthology of science fiction. It appears to be the first ever published and that was in 1937. Oh, nuts! Just read Bud’s review.\n\nLegal Daisy Spacing\n\nThis is by Chris Winn published in 1985. It is an illustrated satire with a considerable bite on legal terraforming. Can’t write any more as I’m off to find the book.\n\nThe Gods Hate Kansas\n\nJoseph Millard’s The Gods Hate Kansas. Is his one and only sf effort. It was published in 1941 in time for my birth but no one ever told me about it. I can’t get over the title. I’d be very surprised if it wasn’t true. Bud’s history won’t let me not search for the book. Any book made into a movie must have caught somebody’s attention.\n\nCodex Seraphinianus\n\nBack in 1981, Italian surrealist Luigi Serafini compiled a folio of flora, fauna, and persona. If preserving past masters can interest you, please read Bud’s column. This is another one too good to pass.\n\nThe Quest of the Gole\n\nIf you do not care for poetry, ignore this one. If you do, then meet one emeritus Sterling Professor of English at Yale, John Hollander and his illustrator Reginald Pollack and prepare yourself for a dazzling poetic exercise. Oh, yeah, read Bud’s one page back story and you’ll be sucked into the whole thing.\n\nPlanet Big Zero\n\nOnce again, I had no clue to this books existence. Bud provides some personal reasons for his recommendation but he failed with this one to entice me into his world.\n\nThe 27th Day,\n\nAgain, I had no clue to this books existence. Bud provides some reasons but he failed with this one to entice me into his world. His last line sealed it for me.\n\nFather of the Amazons,\n\nNope! Can’t recommend this. Even Bud isn’t raving.\n\nAlvin Steadfast on Vernacular Island,\n\nWritten by Frank Jacobs, he of Mad Magazine notoriety, published in 1965, Bud gives a fun argument for reading this one including alien animals such as the Standing Ovation, the Running Commentary, the Appropriate Gesture, the Glowing Report, the Small Wonder, and the Ill Omen, Explaining it is no more than hour’s read, he may be correct.\n\nE-Books vs. Dead-Tree Books:\n\nSearching and Researching:\n\nIn the Good Old Days:\n\nIn the Beginning\n\nAll conversations between Bud and Jerry Pournelle. The first discusses problems of publishing books and the disappearing of mass market paperbacks because of e-books. The other titles foreshadow their contents. All are interesting reads and their topics have been discussed long and hard here on sff world.\n\nAnd with that I am finished. Read the book. You’ll find it entertaining as well as educational. Maybe even a source for your future reading experiences."
