        "text": "Based on Robert Silverberg’s bestselling Sci-Fi novel \"Downward to the Earth\".\n\nEx-lieutenant Eddie Gundersen returns to Belzagor, where he left behind his youthful illusions, the love of his life, and a shameful history as a brutal colonialist. Today, the planet has been returned to its two native, intelligent species: the Nildorors and the Sulidorors. Acting as a guide for a scientific expedition deep within native territory, Gundersen confronts his inner demons and settles old scores with a planet that hasn’t yet revealed all its secrets to him.\n\n\"COLONIES: Return to Belzagor\" is a new edition of the previously released \"Downward to the Earth\" (2017). It has been edited for content.\n\nMore details"
