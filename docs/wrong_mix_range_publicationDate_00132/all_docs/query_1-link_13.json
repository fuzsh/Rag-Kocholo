        "text": "Sailing by Starlight: The Remarkable Voyage of Globe Star\n\nRod Scher (author)\n\nPublisher: Sheridan House\n\nISBN13: 9781493065691\n\nBinding:Hardback\n\nPage Count: 296 Pages\n\nSailing by Starlight is the story of the adventure of a lifetime—in fact, of many lifetimes. In the early 1980s, retired geography professor Marvin Creamer set out to do what hadn’t been done for a thousand years—if indeed it had ever been done at all: Marv and his crew boarded a 35’ sailboat named Globe Star and set out into the frigid Atlantic, planning to sail around the world without the use of any instruments. There was no sextant aboard. No compass. No chart-plotter. No GPS. No radar. Not even a stopwatch. Creamer wanted to prove to the world that it was possible for ancient mariners to have crossed the largest seas, perhaps even sailed around the world, using only their brains, their experience, their senses, and their courage. In attempting to prove his point, Creamer would push his boat and his crew to the limit—and occasionally beyond.\n\nTravel with Creamer as Globe Star sails around the perilous Horn, across dangerous and tumultuous seas, and into an active war zone. Sail around the world with a man who was taken prisoner by an idea, a man obsessed with proving a point, and who would let neither 40-foot waves nor fractious crewmembers deter him."
