        "text": "Character development takes a back seat though, as world building and faction development are Salvatoreâs focus. Artemis shows little conflict, and Cattie-brieâs main choice is whether to pursue adventure with the man who previously kidnapped her, or to enjoy a life at home with her husband, Drizzt, and their child. Of course, the wizard-rogue turns to the road out of boredom, despite the only fight she had with her husband in the past few books being what religion to raise their daughter, as if Mielikki would forbid the child to learn meditation under Grandmaster Kane. Meanwhile,Â Drizzt continues to contemplate the role of religion in people's lives, whether to follow the path of least resistance in order to be one with the universe, and how direct his instruction to others should be. Much of this was influenced byÂ Kane's role instructing him.\n\nThe book takes the companions to the frigid Great Glacier where magic has its seasons, where water elementals freeze people into stalagmites, and where a giant primordial ice elemental that supports a hidden city allegedly does battle with the fire elemental it encompasses. Thatâs fine, until an army of creatures who are immune to fire and ice start boring holes into it, shifting the natural balance. The fire elemental provides a warm oasis in the frigid wasteland, where a giant city full of dwarves, orcs, elves, and a new species of drow called the aevendrow (starlight drow) live in perfect harmony. When the group is gently captured, with threats to erase their memory to conceal the cityâs existence, they must ask themselves whether theyâve found utopia, or an illusion.\n\nWhen one character is attacked by a certain monster, those familiar with Dungeons & Dragons will already know whatâs going to happen. For some, this will heighten the suspense, while for others it ruins one of the main surprises that builds suspense. Considering that the foe in question harkens back to first edition, this will be most readers. The book ends with a huge cliffhanger as the companions face the forces of nature and the power of death in all their wrath.\n\nâ\n\nOverall:\n\nâ\n\nThe book is great for newcomers to the series, as itâs fairly self-contained, and most of it focuses on just the four companions and their journey. Compared to the endless head hopping that Salvatore usually employs, taking third-person omniscient to its full grandeur, the point of view is tight and focused on the group. While some fantasy novels would feel less epic without taking a broad approach to the world, the new location is intriguing enough that it maintains interest.\n\nThe action scenes heâs known for are more limited in this book so that the focus can be on exploration, a welcome change. Likewise, two of the action scenes occur in the form of sports matches which make the new city come alive. These matches would normally be handled two ways by authors: as low risk, low suspense scenes, or as a fight to the death. Salvatore masterfully maintains tension instead by the failing health of one of the seriesâ main characters, whose life becomes tied to a sporting match in an intensely emotional experience, even though he's not a player.\n\nSalvatoreâs writing style is straightforward as normal, with extensive use of distancing language and a habit of stating the obvious, but this makes it accessible to all age levels. The scenes are wonderful, and the new city a fantastical escape. It reminds me that I read science fiction to think, and fantasy to smile. It's definitely worth checking out! Also check out his new audio novella, One-Eyed Jax, and his young adult book, The Color of Dragons, a Pre-Arthurian tale.\n\nA few of Starlight Enclave's monster stats from 5e are available as follows (donât click if you wish to avoid spoilers).\n\nEnemy 1\n\nEnemy 2\n\nEnemy 3\n\n(All images fair use fromÂ Wizards of the Coast and Salvatore's book cover)"
