Highway 641 is a 600-series municipal highway in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It runs from Highway 39 near Rouleau north to Highway 15 at Semans. It is about 153.3 kilometres (95.3 mi) long. The highway intersects the Trans-Canada Highway south of Pense and east of Belle Plaine, Highway 20 at Lumsden, and Highway 22 at Earl Grey. Local Improvement Districts were the precursors of rural municipalities which initially established and maintained roads in their area. Early settlers helped to construct and maintain the route and would get paid road improvement wages from the local rural municipality. The 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) concurrency between Highway 20 and Highway 641 was constructed in 1927 following the removal of the Canadian National Railway line between Lumsden and Craven. The remainder of the road followed Dominion land survey township and range lines.
