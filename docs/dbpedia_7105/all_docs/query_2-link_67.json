        "text": "Andjelic Land currently has holdings in 95 Rural Municipalities across Saskatchewan making up around 232,808 acres under ownership. Why so much land? Because we want to be a one-stop shop for all producers looking to rent farmland. From those just starting out to large operations with generations of history and everyone in between, Andjelic Land has rental options available.\n\nWe want to cater to the young farmer just starting out who needs to rent a quarter or two, for they are our future. Farming is a very capital-intensive business, with high equipment costs, inputs & land. Renting can reduce some of these inputs. Once a young producer gets established they can start purchasing land as their cash reserves allow. We want to be there for young producers to get established and eventually become larger and larger as the older farmers retire. Our large inventory of land is there for producers to rent and, in combination with their own land, utilize equipment to its full potential.\n\nOur large inventory also caters to large farm operations, which may need 100 quarters to set up a satellite operation. This would enable these operations to de-risk from area-specific frost, rainfall, seeding, and harvesting conditions. We feel our holdings separate us from other landowners in the province as we are poised to grow with our tenant's needs. As producers look to expand or diversify their geographic location we have the ability to accommodate such changes within our current land base."
