        "text": "1.1 Overview\n\nThe Evaluation, Performance Measurement and Review Branch (EPRMB) of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) conducted this Evaluation of the Comprehensive Community-based Planning Pilot Project in Saskatchewan to provide evidence-based conclusions regarding the project's relevance and performance.\n\nAANDC Saskatchewan region requested an independent evaluation to assess the results achieved by the pilot project, capture lessons and provide recommendations to inform future support for comprehensive community-based planning. The report includes a program profile, evaluation methodology, evaluation findings relating to relevance, performance and lessons, and conclusions and recommendations.\n\n1.2 Program Profile\n\n1.2.1 Background and Description\n\nIn 2005-06, AANDC's Saskatchewan region undertook a pilot project to examine how Comprehensive Community-based Planning could assist in responding to the urgent issues and needs of First Nations communities. The pilot project was intended to overcome the lack of:\n\nlocal examples illustrating that community-based planning makes a difference;\n\nlocal expertise to initiate, guide and sustain planning efforts;\n\nresources and technological capacity at the local level; and\n\nawareness of comprehensive planning.\n\nThe Saskatchewan regional office through Yorkton Tribal Council (YTC) contracted the Cities and Environment Unit (CEU) of the Faculty of Architecture and Planning at Dalhousie University in Halifax to engage four Saskatchewan First Nation communities in Comprehensive Community-based Planning. This type of planning is a process through which a First Nation establishes a direction for the future and determines specific actions to realize that direction. It is comprehensive because it encompasses all aspects of community life, such as infrastructure development, governance, land and resources, health, culture, social issues and the economy. It is community-based because it employs extensive community involvement throughout the development and the implementation of the plan.\n\nAANDC Saskatchewan region selected the first four communities to participate in the pilot project on the basis of six principles.\n\nPilot communities, through their council, must confirm a willingness and desire to advance Comprehensive Community-based Planning.\n\nCommunities from the North and South should be represented.\n\nA pilot community must possess demonstrated financial management capacity and be committed to principles of accountability.\n\nTechnical expertise from tribal council advisory staff and planning consultants will be essential in the initial pilots to build comprehensive planning capacity.\n\nInitial pilot communities must be affiliated with a tribal council to ensure linkages are developed and planning is supported over the long-term.\n\nPilot communities must have demonstrated a commitment to community engagement as part of their day-to-day operations.\n\nIn 2007-2008, CEU won a tendered contract to expand the pilot project and four more communities were added in Phase 2. In 2008-2009, three communities entered the pre‑planning stage of the process as part of Phase 3.\n\nPHASE 1\n\nCOMMUNITIES PHASE 2\n\nCOMMUNITIES PHASE 3\n\nCOMMUNITIES 1. Flying Dust First Nation 1. Cowessess First Nation 1. Big River First Nation 2. George Gordon First Nation 2. Kinistin Saulteaux Nation 2. Lac La Ronge Indian Band 3. Shoal Lake Cree Nation 3. Muskoday First Nation* 3. Standing Buffalo Dakota Nation 4. Kahkewistahaw First Nation 4. Pasqua First Nation\n\n*Muskoday First Nation withdrew from the pilot project in April 2010.\n\nAt the outset, Phase 1 communities were to receive three years of support. However, these First Nations successfully lobbied for continued funding to support the implementation of their plans and as subsequent First Nations were added to the project, communities from the earlier phases continued to receive support and acted as mentors for the newer communities. Out of 11 communities that participated in the pilot project, 10 were still involved when it ended in March 2011.\n\nOver the course of the project, the CEU submitted two proposals to AANDC Saskatchewan region for funding to establish a diploma program in First Nations community planning, first with the First Nations University in 2006 and then with the First Nations University and the University of Saskatchewan in 2010. Such a program was to provide on-going access to local planning expertise in Saskatchewan. While AANDC Saskatchewan region set aside funding in 2010-2011 to support such an initiative, it has yet to become a reality.\n\nThe First Nations Community Planning Model (2003, 2nd Ed.), as developed by the CEU, uses a seven-stage process for developing a comprehensive community-based plan.\n\nStage 1: Gathering Background Information - Collect basic facts and perceptions about the community so that aspects which stand out as high and low points can be identified.\n\nStage 2: Identifying Strengths & Issues - Concentrate on recording and understanding problems that need to be dealt with and opportunities that can be built on.\n\nStage 3: Researching Root Causes - Explore strengths and issues to reveal the root causes and the consequences of no action.\n\nStage 4: Establishing a Vision - Establish a long-term, ambitious and appropriate direction for the community.\n\nStage 5: Building a Framework - Translate the vision, issues and values into a blueprint for concerted action in terms of policies, administration, priority action areas and physical improvements.\n\nStage 6: Developing an Implementation Strategy - Develop an implementation strategy and determine priority projects. Organize the necessary resources to realize the projects.\n\nStage 7: Monitoring the Plan & Projects - Evaluate the impact of projects individually, the effects of planning as a whole, and revise the plan on an on-going basis.\n\n1.2.2 Objectives and Expected Outcomes\n\nThe overall objective of Comprehensive Community-based Planning pilot project is to make community-based planning (developing comprehensive local, long-term, and action-oriented plans) an on-going practice for First Nations. Since no formal logic model or performance measurement framework was developed for the pilot project, the evaluators developed a logic model for the project (see Appendix C). This logic model was validated by AANDC Saskatchewan region, the CEU, and YTC, which administered the contract with the CEU on AANDC's behalf.\n\nThe logic model articulates the following outcomes:\n\nIncreased awareness of the importance of comprehensive community-based planning on the part of pilot communities and AANDC;\n\nIncreased capabilities of community members to engage in development and use of comprehensive community-based plans; and\n\nImproved planning in pilot communities.\n\n1.2.3 Program Management, Key Stakeholders and Beneficiaries\n\nAANDC Saskatchewan region established a Joint Steering Committee to manage and oversee the pilot project. This committee included representatives of AANDC Saskatchewan region, the CEU, participating First Nations Communities and their corresponding tribal councils, and Health Canada. While Health Canada contributed to funding for the pilot project, the Department's involvement was largely confined to attending Joint Steering Committee meetings.\n\nThe key beneficiaries of the pilot project were the participating First Nations. Within each community, AANDC Saskatchewan region provided funding for the First Nation to hire a Plan Champion to guide the planning process, facilitate community engagement, ensure that all information gathered and created was shared with the entire community, and report on progress to the Chief and Council.\n\nA Community Contact, usually a member of the band administration, supervised the pilot project. A Planning Work Group comprised of a cross-section of community members worked with the Plan Champion to ensure broad-based community involvement in, and support for, plan development and implementation.\n\nThe tribal councils associated with the pilot project communities were to provide technical and professional support for the development and implementation of the community plans as they already played a role in assisting First Nations to fulfill AANDC planning requirements.\n\n1.2.4 Program Resources\n\nAn examination of the fees charged by the Unit shows that they appear reasonable for the services delivered as they were lower than rates normally charged by professional planning consultants. However, the distance between Halifax and Saskatchewan added to the cost of the project. While the total travel costs are not broken down in CEU contracts, budget documents show that airfare alone comprised nearly $150,000, or six percent of Dalhousie's costs. The Joint Steering Committee meetings were also costly, bringing together between 15 and 50 participants from around the province for one- or two-day meetings several times a year. The meetings appear to have cost about $260,000 and comprised about five percent of the project.\n\n2005-2006 2006-2007 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010 2010-2011 Total Category Amount % of\n\nTotal Amount % of\n\nTotal Amount % of\n\nTotal Amount % of\n\nTotal Amount % of\n\nTotal Amount % of\n\nTotal Amount % of\n\nTotal CEU, Dalhousie 6,000 4.7 235,060 47.9 389,397 48.0 491,850 48.0 588,000 44.5 524,253 42.8 2,234,560 44.7 First Nations/\n\nTribal Councils 110,000 86.6 236,940 48.3 396,720 48.9 508,150 49.6 707,500 53.6 575,082 47.0 2,534,392 50.7 Joint Steering\n\nCommittee\n\nAdministration*. 11,000 8.7 19,000 3.9 25,000 3.1 25,000 2.4 25,000 1.9 25,000 2.0 130,000 2.6 Other\n\n(Diploma program)\n\n100,000\n\n8.2\n\n100,000 2 Totals 127,000 100.0 491,000 100.0 811,117 100.0 1,025,000 100.0 1,320,500 100.0 1,224,335 100.0 4,998,952 100.0\n\n(Source: AANDC Saskatchewan region)\n\n* it represents only the amount spent by AANDC Saskatchewan region and not the total cost.\n\n2.
