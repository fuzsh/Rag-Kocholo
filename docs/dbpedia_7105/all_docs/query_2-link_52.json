Yes. There are mile markers starting in Fort Chipewyan that run south to the entrance gate by the washrooms. Markers can be used for emergency situations and wide loads. Do drivers need to radio in the markers to anyone? No. There is no requirement to call in to anyone while travelling the road. How can I get information on the Fort Smith Winter Road?"
