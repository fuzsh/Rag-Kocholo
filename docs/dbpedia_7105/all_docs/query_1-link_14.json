The city is surrounded by towns, cities, villages, and acreages providing a wealth of housing options — and for most, the commute to work is no more than 30 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Saskatoon StarPhoenix ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Saskatoon StarPhoenix ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nSaskatoon’s CMA includes the cities of Martensville and Warman to the north, plus nine towns, five villages, two resort villages at Blackstrap Lake, the Whitecap Dakota First Nation, and six rural municipalities. The CMA population, including Saskatoon proper, was 337,000 as of January.\n\nFisher, broker/owner of Royal LePage Vidorra, said bedroom communities are largely within a 50-kilometre radius of Saskatoon, including the towns of Dundurn, Clavet and Delisle.\n\n“The further out you go, the more house you will be able to buy for your money,” he said. “A house of $365,000, the average price in Saskatoon last year, might be $250,000 in Clavet.”\n\nA buyer may well find lower taxes and a larger — even much larger — yard in the surrounding communities, along with “more of a community feel,” he says. The question is always whether people want to commute.\n\n“’Do I have time to commute 20 minutes each way?’ And there are costs of doing that as well,” Fisher said. “You’re funding extra transportation costs that will offset some of the mortgage savings. Of course, you don’t have to qualify for gas.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“You could easily qualify for $250,000 or $275,000 in a suburban area and still fund the cost of travel.”\n\nUrban Saskatoon, naturally, offers more amenities, more cultural diversity, a public transportation system, and large events you won’t get in the smaller communities; but many of those are accessible if you’re willing to drive in, he noted.\n\nSome properties in surrounding areas are not less expensive than city homes, however. It depends on the community’s proximity to Saskatoon and the smaller town’s vibe.\n\nThe nearby smaller cities of Martensville and Warman have a variety of housing choices, some less and some equally or more expensive than city counterparts. (Condos are also available, but not in large numbers.)\n\n“Warman, for instance, was higher in average price than in Saskatoon last year (2021),” Fisher said. “Half of the sales were homes built in the last 10 years. There’s been a lot of development in Martensville and Warman and there’s a good selection of even luxury properties — beautiful houses around golf courses.\n\n“As those areas become easier to access and offer a better selection of housing options, the prices go up. Consequently, there’s not a huge difference between Saskatoon and Martensville and Warman. You have to get further out to see much in terms of cost savings.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAcreages are a completely different ball game, he said.\n\n“While they’re not in the city, they tend to be more expensive. The average price within 50 kilometres of Saskatoon is almost $600,000. The difference there is you have more land, and those properties typically have larger houses.”\n\nAn average acreage home in the area measures 1,870 square feet compared to 1,275 on the average Saskatoon lot, he said.\n\nPeople tend to buy acreages for the privacy.\n\n“Sometimes you can almost be invisible on your land. You can engage in hobbies not as accessible in the city, like having a couple of horses or snowmobiles … or massive-scale gardening for your family.”\n\nAmong the very first things to check when seeking an acreage is the quality of the water, Fisher added.\n\n“There’s pretty good well water available in most areas around Saskatoon. Water is hugely important. It should almost be one of your top concerns when buying an acreage. Wells should be tested and monitored over the long term to be sure they’re supplying safe water.\n\n“A lot of these newer developments close to the city have city water service.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nThe right vibes: Eight tips for choosing your Saskatoon neighbourhood\n\nSaskatoon offers wide variety of housing\n\nConsider housing incentive programs to support your move\n\n10 things to consider before buying a condo in Saskatoon\n\nThe news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.
