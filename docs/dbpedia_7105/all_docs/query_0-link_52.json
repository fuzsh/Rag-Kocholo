        "text": "RM roads follow Provincial Highway's weight designations.\n\nPlease respect all Detour Signs during our busy road construction season.\n\nMost roads will remain open, for at least the width of one lane, during construction. During culvert replacements, however, roads will need to be temporarily closed.\n\nMINISTRY OF HIGHWAYS & INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nIn response to the backlog in grain movement out of Saskatchewan, the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure has taken steps to ease seasonal weight restrictions on some highways.\n\nShippers and farmers may apply to Ministry District Offices for permits that will allow for heavier than published spring weights. Circumstances where permits could be granted include roads where ministry staff determine heavier loads will not cause undue road damage, or during colder than seasonal temperatures. Haulers must hold a permit to access the heavier weights. This flexible approach applies only to agricultural commodities.\n\nThe R.M. of Frenchman Butte participates in the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure Winter Weight Seasonal Restrictions Orders.\n\nPlease see the link for more information: Sask Highways Website for Road Restrictions\n\nPLEASE REFER TO MINISTRY OF HIGHWAYS WEBSITE FOR THE - Spring Weight Restrictions\n\nClick here for the Guide to Saskatchewan Weight and Dimension Regulations Part 1 & Part 2 Please Note when calculating weights, RM roads are secondary weight.\n\nTHE RM OF FRENCHMAN BUTTE OFFICE DISCRETIONARY OVERWEIGHT PERMITS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON ROAD CONDITIONS. ALL MUNICIPAL ROADS ARE AT SECONDARY WEIGHTS FOR EACH AXLE. PLEASE CALL ROADATA FOR A PERMIT NUMBER BEFORE ANY PLANNED MOVEMENT.\n\nPlease note: If conditions do not warrant travel, the permit(s) are invalid.\n\nCONDITIONS OF OVERWEIGHT PERMIT"
