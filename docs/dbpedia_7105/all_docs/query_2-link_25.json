Both figures have increased by 33 per cent over the last five years.\n\nHowever, the cost of rural policing stands in stark contrast to that of a major urban police force. The per capita cost of policing Saskatoon is expected to be $390 next year, while Regina’s is estimated to be $381.\n\nAsked about the gulf between rural and urban costs, Orb said while there are differences, such as geography and the fact that cities with their own police forces can collect revenue from fines, rural crime “has to be addressed one way or another.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThat likely means reinvigorating the Rural Crime Watch and Community Safety Officer programs while continuing to push the provincial government for more RCMP officers in rural areas, he said.\n\nRural crime and policing have become major issues in the seven months since Colten Boushie, a 22-year-old man from Red Pheasant First Nation, was shot to death in a farmyard north of Biggar.\n\nGerald Stanley, a 55-year-old farmer, pleaded not guilty to a second-degree murder charge in connection with Boushie’s death, which has highlighted strained relations between indigenous and non-indigenous communities in the province.\n\nFederation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) vice-chief Kim Jonathan, who last week condemned a SARM resolution to lobby the federal government for expanded self-defence rights, said it’s important for communities to find common ground.\n\nThat means funding programs that encourage conversation between indigenous and non-indigenous people and police, rather than simply hiring more officers to make more arrests, Jonathan said.\n\nThrough a spokesman, Saskatchewan RCMP commanding officer Curtis Zablocki declined an interview request on Monday. The spokesman said the force could not immediately comment on concerns about rural policing.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSaskatchewan Justice Minister Gordon Wyant said while hiring more RCMP officers could be “part of the answer,” any viable long-term solution will include a range of new policies, measures and programs.\n\nThat could mean shifting “low-risk” policing activities to other agencies, funding programs like Rural Crime Watch and encouraging all interested parties to demonstrate leadership and build relationships, he said.\n\nA caucus committee chaired by Saskatchewan Party MLA Herb Cox is expected to release its report on policing in the province this month. Wyant said the government will “do what we can to work on solutions to help alleviate concerns in rural Saskatchewan.”\n\namacpherson@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/macphersona\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\n'This is a slap in the face': Boushie family lawyer blasts SARM self-defence resolution\n\n'We don't need these kinds of fires being started': Former RM councillor appalled by SARM resolution\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
