        "text": "Where a neighbourhood plan applies to a proposed new residential or commercial area, it sets the stage for more detailed planning such as concept plans and rezoning.\n\nThere are currently no neighbourhood plans under review or being considered by the Regina Planning Commission, City Council or Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Official Community Plan (OCP) directs that 30 per cent of Regina’s growth over the next 20 years should occur within established areas as intensification.\n\nIntensification is the construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings on serviced land within existing built areas of the city that result in more residential units or an increase in area of commercial, institutional or office.\n\nIntensification includes:\n\nDevelopment on vacant land\n\nAddition to an existing building\n\nBuilding conversion (redevelopment of an existing non-residential building into a residential building)\n\n‘Infill development’ is generally any development that occurs within established areas, but it doesn’t necessarily result in intensification.\n\nFor example: If you demolished one single family dwelling within an established area and replaced it with another single-family dwelling, it would be considered infill. If you replaced it with a fourplex, it would be considered an infill project that results in intensification as there are more units than there were originally.\n\nSupporting development and intensification in established areas of a city has many benefits:\n\nCreates complete, more connected and vibrant communities – a sense of place for people\n\nIncreases availability of diverse housing options for people of all ages and stages of life\n\nFosters economic prosperity with a new customer base for local businesses and employment opportunities for residents\n\nCreates financial sustainability through new tax revenue and larger tax base per hectare\n\nPromotes active transportation and more choice (walking, cycling, transit), leading to decreased traffic emissions and a healthier population\n\nCreates cost savings and efficiencies in use of land, infrastructure and services like transit already in place\n\nEnsures the population needed for neighbourhood schools and amenities to stay open\n\nImproves safety with less “dead space” and more “eyes on the street”"
