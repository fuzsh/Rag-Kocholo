These investments include the Regina Bypass and twinning Highway 11 between Saskatoon and Prince Albert, he added.\n\n“We have a growth plan target to improve 10,000 kilometres of highway by the year 2030,” Moe said. “We’re committed to doing 1,100 kilometres this year, which would put us above that target if we were to repeat that over the course of each year out to 2030.”\n\nSome delegates said highway upgrades are needed in order to accommodate new private infrastructure, like canola crushing plants.\n\nPamela Bartlett with the RM of Enniskillen, said Highway 9 near the border community of Northgate is expecting dozens of more trucks and thousands of more rail cars when Ceres builds its canola crushing plant in the community.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Highway No. 9 south has been in a state of disrepair for some time. After numerous letters, nothing has happened … You talk about building the economy, this is proof right here,” she told ministers.\n\n“Please build No. 9 highway now, not later. It’s long overdue.”\n\nSARM president Ray Orb said the organization lobbies for funding for rural roads, adding they always need more funding.\n\nHe said there will be more road damage when the economy picks up in rural communities.\n\n“We totally understand our members’ point of view, where more money needs to be put into highways,” he said.\n\nHighways critic Trent Wotherspoon said the province needs to invest in highways and ensure they are safe.\n\nIn some cases, he said, they are repaired inadequately.\n\n“We need to ultimately make sure we’re investing in systems and rebuilds that are going to get the public the value for the money they deserve and the safety and integrity of those highways,” Wotherspoon told reporters after question period Wednesday.\n\nDuring Moe’s address to rural delegates, he spoke about investing further in some services, while also aiming to bring the budget back to balance.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe said people can expect “significant” investments in health care, particularly on surgical wait-times, as well as hiring and retaining staff.\n\n“The few (workers) we have lost temporarily, we are going to get them back, we’re going to get them back very quickly,” he said.\n\nAs well, Moe said people can expect a “renewed commitment” of dollars into public infrastructure.\n\nWhen asked how he plans to weigh more investment while aiming to balance the budget, he said he is doing this carefully.\n\n“We need some investment in health-care people, trained people to offer the services in rural Saskatchewan as well as our urban centres,” Moe said, adding the past two years have been challenging financially.\n\n“When it comes to our finances, we’re among the best in our debt-to-GDP ratio, but we still have a deficit, and we need to remove that. We need to get this province back to balance.”\n\nDuring his remarks, Moe again called on Ottawa to not hike the carbon tax, adding he wants to see more Canadian oil and gas shipped out east and to European markets so they’re less reliant on sources like Russia.\n\njsimes@postmedia.com\n\nThe news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.
