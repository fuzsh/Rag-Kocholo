        "text": "Saskatchewan is not often mentioned in discussions of sustainable infrastructure. We are known for our potholes, our mining, and our never-ending fields. It is true; we face some very real challenges when it comes to sustainable infrastructure. These challenges affect all three pillars of sustainability: social, environmental, and economic. However, it would be naive to claim that Saskatchewan’s infrastructure as a whole lacks sustainability. We are working to overcome the challenges at hand, and while we may still have a ways to go, we’re on the right track.\n\nPromising Foundations. For over 10,000 years, people of the region of Saskatchewan have lived off of the land. The indigenous people canvassed the land as hunter gatherers. The fur traders introduced a universal means of organic currency. The pioneers settled the land and created the timeless prairie backdrop of grain elevators standing tall in pools of wheat.\n\nToday, agriculture is one of our biggest economic markets: it accounts for 1/3 of the province’s total exports and over 30% of the world’s exports in flaxseed, durum, peas, and lentils (1). We are the world leader in potash and uranium exports. We are making a name for ourselves in oil and natural gas.\n\nAs a province, we are known for our strength, our perseverance, and our core “small town” values. We have a modest upbringing and a strong sense of community. When you look at our fields, our mines, and our rigs, it’s obvious that we really do still “live off the land.” Through our often frugal spending and our traditionalist attitude, the economic and social pillars of sustainability are always at the forefront of infrastructure design. But when it comes to the environmental pillar, the single most important component of our economy and our founding, have we forgotten to consider it?\n\nDark Years. Saskatchewan has a history of being a have-not province. We spent decades literally weathering the storm. For the 70 years preceding 2006, our province hovered at a population in the mid 900,000’s. In the 1980’s, a great deal of our infrastructure required renewal. However, the funding still wasn’t there. Sustainability in its three-pillar form wasn’t even brought to the table, as nearly impossible upfront costs spoke loudest. Some of these architectural scars still exist remind us of a time where we lacked choice.\n\nUnimagined Growth. Since 2006, Saskatchewan has seen impressive and diversified growth on all fronts. In fact, amidst current economic conditions, it is predicted that Saskatchewan will not only avoid a recession in 2015, but we will see growth(2).\n\nThrough this growth, we have transitioned from a Have-Not province to a Have province. However, many of our humble residents have trouble believing that our hard work has finally paid off. We have difficulty considering long-term investments in sustainable infrastructure because we lack the confidence to believe that our success may be permanent. We become fixated on the short-term gains from savings in capital expenditures. It might be said that we have more confidence investing in the prosperity of the province’s football team than in its own people.\n\nConservative Development Standards. In many parts of the province, we are harnessed by out of date bylaws. Municipal Engineers on many city projects see bloated construction costs based on outdated development standards.\n\nMany Consultants are hungry to implement new technologies. Time and time again, the question is asked, “is everyone else doing it?” We lack risk appetite, and therefore are slow to adapt technologies which have been developed elsewhere. Our harsh climate has historically made new technologies risky and prone to failure.\n\nIt will be the responsibility of Civil Engineers to provide guidance and support to regulatory agencies to help improve opportunities for sustainable technical creativity while providing a framework for controlling quality and mitigating risk.\n\nUrban Sprawl. Saskatchewan, like much of the prairies, houses a culture of people who started with nothing. The pioneers worked hard for every acre they bought, sowed, harvested. Today we still place a huge sense of value, respect, and priority in gaining land and possessions such as vehicles. This has led to urban sprawl, which only further complicates our ability to fund infrastructure. Public transportation is a tough sell when the neighbourhoods aren’t developed for it, the travel time is inconvenient, and the cost savings are marginal. Additionally, it is difficult to create a thriving city centre when housing costs less and provides more space in the “suburbs” – which are still only a short drive to downtown.\n\nRural Dispersion. One of Saskatchewan’s greatest challenges is servicing its people. Saskatchewan has the highest amount of road surface of any province – and a modest population with which to spread the cost of upkeep. For years, the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure (MHI) has been forced into the position of being unable to afford to upkeep its highways, bridges, or culverts until failure. Again, we are aware that it’s not the most logical or economical solution – but it’s the only solution that fits in the short-term budget.\n\nIn light of the challenge at hand, MHI does an impressive job of asset management. Given an impossible budget and an unforgiving freeze-thaw cycle, MHI still finds ways to maintain our current infrastructure at a functional level while upgrading our system where growth demands it. In addition, highway maintenance directly and indirectly employs thousands of residents. Further, we have identified that cheaper, flexible asphalt used across most of the province actually performs better in our regional conditions than more expensive, rigid asphalt or concrete mixtures.\n\nDisaster Mitigation. Saskatchewan is a province that is prone to extremes: winter temperatures dipping below -50oC, arid +40oC summers causing fire, storm events reaching 1 in 1000 year flows, plow winds demolishing infrastructure. Our people can attest that we truly are the “Land of the Living Skies.” As a province, we have begun to take these risks seriously: we simply don’t have the resources to start over. Disaster mitigation has been integrated into transportation design, community design, flood control structures, and vital infrastructure standards. We have identified and accepted that extreme weather patterns are changing and our previous standards are no longer acceptable.\n\nConstruction. The Construction sector has seen ample improvement in sustainable practice. Local companies are taking on LEED designated projects. Recycling on site has become not only a viable option, but in many cases the most economical option: only five years ago, items such as drywall could be recycled, but they had to be shipped out of province. Recycling bins were an expense with very restricted use. Today, recycling bins have become an affordable option with a practical application. Not only this, but many of the materials brought onto site are recycled material.\n\nThe Energy Debate. Saskatchewan is looking to change the world’s perspective on coal with the first ever commercial-scale carbon capture and storage operation. The CO emissions captured are equivalent to removing 2.6 million cars from the road.3 We also have major investments in hydroelectric infrastructure and lesser investments in wind, waste heat, and landfill gas that should not be overlooked. Housing the largest uranium mine in the world, Saskatchewan has yet to make use of this highly debatable resource as anything more than an export. However, we are likely to continue to feel pressure to increase our use of renewable resources.\n\nCall to Action. We certainly aren’t anywhere near our potential when it comes to sustainable infrastructure. However, we have started down the right path. Saskatchewan has seen unprecedented growth over the last decade. If we can be leaders in the country for exports, growth, and employment rates, why can’t we be leaders in the country for sustainability? All of the morals comprising sustainability were center stage in our rural upbringings. My challenge to Saskatchewan is to bring environmental sustainability back to the table for infrastructure planning.\n\n1 – “Who Knew – Agriculture in Saskatchewan” Government of Saskatchewan. http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=7b598e42-c53c-485d-b0dd-e15a36e2785b\n\n2 – “A decade of growth will help Saskatchewan’s economy weather the storm” Southwest Booster, 2015/03/05. http://www.swbooster.com/News/Regional/2015-03-05/article-4066668/A-decade-of-growth-will-help-Saskatchewans-economy-weather-the-storm/"
