Part of the reason for the high rates is the RM’s lack of protocols to prevent crime.\n\nCyber insurance coverage can include expenses for computer and electronic data restoration, e-commerce extortion and crisis management, according to the Insurance Bureau of Canada.\n\nSilverwood is one example of an RM that did not go through with the coverage this year.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“They said we are at high risk, because we don’t have enough internal protocols, IT on staff and education towards all the different kinds of threats. The coverage came back so high and with such large deductibles that it wasn’t really worth going through with it,” Buetler said.\n\nThe staffing problem within RM offices persists. Offices with only a handful of employees can’t realistically take on cybersecurity issues.\n\n“RM administrators have so many tasks that they have to do, it’s virtually impossible for them to do them on their own with the way they’re staffed,” said Colin Warnecke, manager of risk management at SARM.\n\n“I don’t know too many organizations where you’re the accountant, the HR manager, the marketing individual, and the IT individual. Who could handle all of that? They really have to look at having some outside assistance in doing that — but that comes with a cost.”\n\nThe price depends on the solution. Warnecke said right now, a lot of the focus is on educating RM; SARM currently offers a $25 cyber training program for its members.\n\nHe would like RM administrators to implement good controls, preferably with IT professionals, to better protect themselves, including adding multi-factor authentication and backup systems, he said.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSilverwood suggested hiring an IT specialist, but whether one hiring would be a realistic solution to oversee the nearly 300 RMs within the province is debatable.\n\nBrennan Schmidt, a Regina-based cybersecurity expert, said he would advocate for an economies of scale model that would put a consistent set of standards in place, but on a broader scale to save taxpayer money.\n\n“If you can have a water agreement or a fire truck agreement in place for sharing between municipalities, I think it’s a really good time to start having the conversation as to what that may look like in the digital age,” Schmidt said, noting that as demand for broadband internet access increases, so do the potential risks.\n\n“If anything, by advocating for broadband, you are creating a couple problems. No. 1, you’re getting folks who may not have adopted technology to fast track on the technology track. And No. 2, you have this whole issue of now municipalities are going to have to start keeping pace with the demands that people expect.”\n\nOrb noted that the potential for increased susceptibility with the advancement of internet technology is a concern, but said SARM has been working over the last year with SaskTel and smaller internet service providers, on proper connectivity and cybersecurity.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSchmidt’s advice for RM taxpayers is to identify the safeguards for data recovery and whether insurance is in place.\n\nSchmidt believes a government standard is required for RMs.\n\n“If the government can put forth legislation that stipulates that you must have a budget that is released at this time and you can’t … borrow against money that you don’t have, etc. I would say they should definitely have some sort of standards in terms of cybersecurity, because if we don’t have that, I think that it’s just going to be a disaster for the tax base.”\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nSLGA target of Christmas Day cyber attack\n\nCity of Saskatoon loses $1 million to fraudster posing as executive\n\nCity of Saskatoon looks for cybersecurity expert\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Star Phoenix is part of the Local Journalism Initiative and reporters are funded by the Government of Canada to produce civic journalism for underserved communities.
