        "meta_description": "We report results from a two-phase mixed methods research\nstudy to illustrate challenges and opportunities of waste management within the\nrural circumpolar and boreal regions of Canada. In the qualitative research\nphase, data were obtained from archives, semi-structured interviews with\ncommunity partners, an information meeting with a community grassroots\norganization, and a participatory action meeting to develop a case study of the\nLabrador waste management system. Like many regions across the world’s boreal\nbelt, the study area consists of a population centre surrounded by diffuse,\nrural communities (many of which are inhabited by Indigenous and First Nations\npersons), multiple land uses, and complex governance considerations. The area\nfaces harsh climatic conditions (e.g. frigidly cold temperatures and extended\nwinters) that challenge biological processes and organic waste decomposition.\nThese regions are often highly reliant upon natural resources and temporary\nlabour forces to drive economic development, and they bear the environmental\nconsequences of legacy wastes after project closures. In the qualitative\nresearch phase, we identify factors contributing to the accrual, management,\nand transport of inorganic waste across the study region to select a priority\nwaste stream for an economic analysis in the quantitative study phase. In the\nquantitative phase we build an economic enterprise budget to assess costs\nassociated with converting waste biomass from the construction of the Muskrat\nFalls hydroelectric dam into biochar with either a fast or slow mobile\npyrolysis system.
