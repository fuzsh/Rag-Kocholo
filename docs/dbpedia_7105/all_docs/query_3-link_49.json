        "text": "This Request for Bid (RFB) is an invitation by the Northern Municipal Trust Account (NMTA) to prospective Proponents to provide a submission for the provision of Wildfire Mitigation work.\n\nNMTA is entering into year six (6) of a nine (9) year program and has identified select communities that require Proponents to bid on forest vegetation thinning and brush pile burning services.\n\nThe Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) is the project manager. SRC, under contract to NMTA, is responsible for contract coordination and oversight.\n\nWildfire mitigation work will increase wildfire resilience for Saskatchewan communities and includes forest thinning, fire guard construction and vegetation maintenance. Project work reduces potential impacts of wildfire on critical infrastructure, therefore reducing the interruptions in essential services. Project work focuses on forests surrounding communities, helping to reduce the impact from wildfire on vulnerable regions. Project work’s goal is to result in a clean, parklike area that is aesthetically pleasing but will not carry wildfire well.\n\nThis work will also help to increase safety levels of any responding agency to a wildfire incident and those evacuating because of the incident.\n\nThis project is funded, in part, by the Government of Canada.\n\nSpecial Instructions to Bidders:\n\nSubstitutions are allowed only if they are of equivalent type, style, and quality to the specifications and features indicated in this RFQ.\n\nAll products must be commercial grade and meet all requirements necessary for commercial use (i.e. rub counts, material densities, qualities, etc.). Bidders must indicate commercial-grade specifications.\n\nVendors may bid on one or more items. Preference may be given to vendors that can provide all the items.\n\nSpecification sheets are required for each item with bid submission. Including fabric, rub count, color options,\n\nPrice quoted must be in Canadian Dollars and the prices listed above shall be the total cost to SIGA including all, shipping/freight, enviro fees, duties, license costs, fees, insurance, and all other charges including applicable taxes as itemized in the chart provided.\n\nThe pricing listed in the Bid submission shall be valid for 30 days from the submission deadline date.\n\nSIGA reserves the right to contact any or all Bidders to clarify their submission\n\nStandard warranty to be included, unless already specified. Provide a quote and details on any extended warranty options as an attachment to this form.\n\nThe successful vendor shall provide order confirmation and tracking information.\n\nThis Request for Proposal (RFP) is an invitation by the Government of Saskatchewan (GOS) to prospective Proponents to provide Submissions for the provision of Project Management Services for Swift Current Comprehensive High School Mechanical, Electrical and Building Code Upgrades, as further described in the RFP Particulars (Appendix A).\n\nThe successful proponent will be responsible for assisting, supporting and leading the Project Management of a successful renovation to the existing school in Swift Current, SK. This Project will be a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Ministry of SaskBuilds and Procurement (SBP) and the Chinook School Division #211 (CSD), collectively known as “the Owners”.\n\nThe estimated renovation area is 26,942 m2 which will consist of a complete rehabilitation of mechanical and electrical systems throughout the building, replaced exterior lighting, parking pedestals, the conversion of ventilation and AC distribution to a displacement ventilation configuration, bringing life and safety systems up to current Canadian Building Code including but not limited to fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, egress travel distances, fire separations, pull stations, and asbestos abatement where applicable. The work is anticipated to be phased to accommodate an operational school, with most of the work anticipated to be completed over the summer breaks. The estimated budget for this project is $39,000,000.\n\n** Mandatory pre-tender site visit will be held on September 9, 2024 at 1:00pm **\n\nThe required Work shall include, but not be limited to the following:\n\nTo be on call for snow removal services during or after major snow falls (Trigger depth of 2”), or when requested to provide the service.\n\nIncludes whole parking lots. Sidewalks, and laneways for the Dakota Dunes Resort/Hotel and Dakota Dunes Casino, as well as road to the golf course parking lot. The Dakota Dunes Golf Course parking lot is not in scope.\n\nThe services includes, but is not limited to snow clearing, snow blowing, shovelling, pushing, piling, salt/sanding, de-icing, hauling /transporting accumulated snow away from the property., and dumping.\n\nPreference is to clean public lanes, roads, and parking lots by no later than 6:00 am to ensure that the service area can be cleaned without the presence of vehicles. Then move to sidewalks, and staff parking areas.\n\nTo push and pile the snow in the designated areas.\n\nSnow removal/hauling can take place during the day and needs to be done as soon as possible after each snowfall to eliminate massive piles of snow on site. The snow piles must be hauled away & dumped to the community/city approved snow dumping areas.\n\nSnow piling in the designated areas is to be snow which is pushed from the casino/hotel property and road to the golf course only. Snow from other locations outside of the casino area and hotel are not to be piled in these areas.\n\nUpon SIGA’s request, a sand and salt mixture will be spread by appropriate mechanical means to provide coverage without large lumps of frozen sand.."
