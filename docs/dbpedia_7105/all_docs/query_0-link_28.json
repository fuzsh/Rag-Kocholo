Your community is so proud of you.\n\nJeanne-Marie de Moissac\n\nJuly 26th, the second annual Springwater Lake Revitalization Sports Day, dawned chilly after a spell of hot, still weather. It was a whitecapped, windy day at the Lake but in true Prairie Fashion, no one let it spoil anyone’s fun. A hearty, steaming bowl of chili was served for lunch and warmed everyone up for the volleyball tournament. Four teams entered the round robin tournament hoping to win the 100-dollar prize, putting on an entertaining show for the enthusiastic bystanders. Although everyone played well, Springwater Colony was the star of the show and won first prize! If you weren’t playing or watching the volley ball, you could have partnered up for sack races, horseshoes or competed to get your pig to market! Supper was hotdogs, hamburgers provided by Dennis Falcon and cooked by Mel Bachman and Mike Plysiuk, with pasta salad and buns donated by Springwater Colony. Duperow Co-op donated the pop and chips and all three drug stores donated the water. Thank you so much for your generosity!\n\nThe Springwater Lake Revitalization Committee would also like to thank the Biggar Credit Union, Biggar Agencies, Leading Edge Welding and Northland Painting and Sandblasting for their support. Almost a thousand dollars was raised for the new boat launch!\n\nIt takes a prairie community to raise a lake and it’s happening! As always there’s room for more people around the committee table. Take this as your invitation to join us with your ideas!\n\nI was told by Springwater’s Sage (Harry, you know who you are) anytime the community comes together it’s a Win. All ages gathered at Springwater Lake on July 26th and it was, indeed, a Win!\n\nThe Rural Municipality of Biggar accepts the following forms of payments.\n\nIn Person Payments\n\nOnline Banking Payments\n\nMail In Payments\n\nIn Person Payments - either by cash, cheque, or debit\n\nOnline Banking Payments - The RM accepts online payments for accounts receivable and property taxes.
