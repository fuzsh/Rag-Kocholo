        "text": "I was looking at a map of canada, a pretty detailed one at that. I have noticed that the above provinces use numeric roads i.e. 27 Mile rd, I guess to show the distance from the U.S border. In Manitoba it seems that the towns or counties have names plus a number. I dont have the map in front of me but if the town name has a number next to it that seems to be consistent with the distrance fromt he U.S border.\n\nTowns in Sask and Alberta also have numbers next to them but one town has a number like 602 and the other 145. :?:\n\nWhat do the numbers in these towns mean? I\n\nI rarely see any info from manitoba but I curious\n\nThanx in advance\n\nEric\n\nHi EJB,\n\nI have gone through 3 Saskatchewan maps I have, and have not come across these numbers beside the towns. Must be one hell of a detailed map!!\n\nThere are 2 things I think they night be.\n\n1. Is possibly the population of the town? If this is the case, towns like Humbolt will have a 4 digit number while towns like Pilot Butte will have 3.\n\n2. Is that our Province is divided up into regions called RM's (Rural Municipalities). It is possible it is giving you the RM number the town is situated in.\n\nIs there a legend some where in the map that tells you what those numbers mean?\n\nRegards,\n\nRichster.\n\nI think what you're seeing is township and range roads. Alberta, I think Saskatchewan, and possibly Manitoba as well (though don't quote me on that) is divided up into parcels of land called townships and ranges, and those are further divided into \"sections\". The roads are mainly laid out in a grid format on the borders of these divisions.\n\nSee http://www3.gov.ab.ca/srd/land/recaccess/township.html for a good description of this system. I don't know how 27 Mile Road comes into play, but I know that townships are numbered starting with township 1 at the U.S. border and going upwards as you go north, and ranges are numbered from east-to-west, starting at one of a number of \"Meridians\" (specific lines of longitude).\n\nAs for regions/municipalities with numbers before and after them, I think what you're seeing may be one of two things - either municipal districts (i.e. counties) or native indian reservations. For example, in my area, there is the Municipal District of Rockyview, which often has \"#44\" appended to its name. South of me is the Municipal District of Foothills, which is #31. Also in the nearby area are several native reservations, such as the Sarcee Reserve #145, and the Morley Reserve #s 142, 143, and 144. (There are three bands on the Morley Reserve, which is why they get three numbers, as far as I know.)\n\nHowever, I have no clue how or why this numbering system works, or is in place. Sorry."
