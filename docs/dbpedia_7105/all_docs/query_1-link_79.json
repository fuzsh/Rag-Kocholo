        "text": "On an early July morning, Barry Carriere packed up his boat and set out on the calm waters of the Saskatchewan River Delta.\n\nAt 57 years old, he's been navigating these narrow channels and tributaries his entire life. But the trapper, fisherman and guide sees the delta increasingly in decay — with shrinking waterways.\n\n\"This was all lake at one time,\" Carriere said, pointing to walls of invasive weeds that choke native plants. \"The fish, the moose, the deer — all that is moving south, because there's no water here for them.\"\n\nCarriere, who is from Cumberland House Cree Nation in northern Saskatchewan, is one of many trappers, environmentalists and First Nations leaders raising concerns over the deterioration of the ecosystem. The Saskatchewan River Delta is the largest freshwater river delta in North America, stretching 9,700 square kilometres from northeast Saskatchewan into western Manitoba.\n\nA home to diverse wildlife from moose and bear to migratory birds, the delta — known as Kitaskīnaw in Cree — has seen water levels drastically fluctuate from the impact of hydroelectric dams and development in the province's south.\n\nNow Carriere fears a $4 billion farm irrigation project planned by the provincial government, set to break ground next year, will further affect its health.\n\n\"If they do that irrigation project, that's the last nail that they're going to put to the delta,\" he said.\n\nCarriere heads down the delta in his boat near Cumberland House. The delta is home to many species of fish, insects, moose, bear and migratory birds. (Don Somers/CBC)\n\nWhat are the plans?\n\nThe project, initially announced in 2020, plans to eventually irrigate some 202,000 hectares of land in southwestern and west-central Saskatchewan with water from Lake Diefenbaker. The lake was formed by the construction of two dams to provide water for irrigation and drinking.\n\nThe project would double the amount of irrigable land in the province and allow farmers to grow high-value crops, including potatoes and cucumbers.\n\nThe first phase of the project, currently being designed, will rehabilitate existing and incomplete infrastructure on the west side of the lake. It will allow for the irrigation of about 36,000 hectares.\n\nPatrick Boyle, a spokesperson with the Water Security Agency — a Crown corporation responsible for water management in Saskatchewan — said the project will use a fraction of the available water in Lake Diefenbaker.\n\nSteve Primrose is a cattle producer with both dryland and irrigated crops. He hopes to see irrigation availability expand for farmers in Saskatchewan. (Kendall Latimer/CBC)\n\n\"We actually lose more to evaporation, which is over three per cent, than we do to irrigation,\" he said. \"We believe that there is significant supply there to satisfy all needs.\"\n\nGraham Strickert, an associate professor at the University of Saskatchewan and part of the Global Institute for Water Security, has studied the delta for more than a decade. He estimates the project's initial phase will have minimal impact on flow to the delta. But if later phases go through, he says it could potentially impact water levels, particularly in dry years.\n\nThe delta is rich in wildlife and spans 9,700 square kilometres from northeast Saskatchewan into western Manitoba. (Don Somers/CBC)\n\nStrickert says since record-keeping began in the 1920s, there's been a 20 per cent decline in water flowing through the delta annually, mostly due to irrigation for agriculture and cities taking drinking water.\n\nHe says dams and reservoirs are also altering the ecosystem, stopping new sediment from flowing into the delta.\n\n\"The river becomes deeper and wider. It's slowly becoming a single-river channel, and so the wetlands aren't as productive as they once were,\" Strickert said.\n\n'Billions' from agriculture boom\n\nOn his farm in central Saskatchewan, Steve Primrose is already spraying his fields with water from Lake Diefenbaker. He says the new project will boost food security, as farmers increasingly grapple with dry spells.\n\n\"We're going to guarantee families and our next generation and generations to come, to be able to stay in agriculture business,\" he said.\n\nInvasive grasses are taking over the river banks as parts of the delta no longer flood, making them inaccessible by boat. (Alexandre Silberman/CBC)\n\nPrimrose runs cattle operations in Outlook, Sask., and chairs the South Saskatchewan River Irrigation District. He recognizes why people outside the industry might raise concerns about water use. But in reality, he says highly efficient pump systems allow farmers to use small amounts of water for a significant return.\n\n\"You need to manage it, because it's a priceless commodity we don't take lightly,\" he said.\n\nThe province is also promoting potential for major economic growth from new crops that require more water.\n\nBoyle says the irrigation expansion will result in a significant boost to the provincial GDP, increasing tax revenue by potentially \"billions\" over time. He says 0.4 hectares of dryland wheat contributes $400, while the same land area of an irrigated, processed high-value crop, like potatoes, contributes $20,000.\n\n'It's crying for help'\n\nOn the delta, people are searching for solutions to try to protect it.\n\nStrickert says there are several viable options, including changing how hydroelectric dams operate to allow for more consistent water flow. That could include the creation of a holding pond or battery storage.\n\n\"It's not possible to put it back to what it was before development. But it is possible to slow down the decline and to even reverse some of that through environmental restoration projects,\" he said.\n\nCumberland House Chief Rene Chaboyer says he understands the need for irrigation for food security, but wants to ensure projects have minimal impact on the Saskatchewan River Delta. (Chanss Lagaden/CBC)\n\nSome of those projects are already underway in Cumberland House Cree Nation, which sits on the delta. Those efforts have included prescribed burning of invasive weeds in the wetlands.\n\nChief Rene Chaboyer says he wants his community to play a direct role in managing the water on the delta. Last year, one of the driest on record, saw the northern village's drinking water supply nearly dry up.\n\n\"It's been a big fight for generations to try and save what is left,\" he said. \"It's crying for help.\"\n\nChaboyer acknowledges that irrigation is positive for food security. But he wants to ensure it's done responsibly to minimize impact on delta.\n\nThe Water Security Agency is working with the community to find solutions. Boyle said an interim water management committee has been set up for the delta, including representatives from Cumberland House. They've conducted flood mapping work to gather more data on changes to the delta.\n\nFor Carriere, concrete solutions to stop the decline can't come soon enough. He said if nothing changes, he will soon further lose access to traditional hunting grounds and his camp — because the channels will become too shallow to navigate.\n\n\"It's dying and there's no other way to say it.\"\n\nCumberland House sits on an island on the Saskatchewan River Delta in the province's northeast. It is home to about 2,000 people in both a village and the adjacent Cumberland House Cree Nation. It is reachable by a single unpaved highway. (Alexandre Silberman/CBC)"
