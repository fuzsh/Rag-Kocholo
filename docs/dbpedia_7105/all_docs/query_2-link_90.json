        "text": "Provincial Disaster Assistance Program (PDAP)\n\nThe Provincial Disaster Assistance Program (PDAP) helps residents, small businesses, agricultural operations, First Nations, non-profit organizations and communities recover from natural disasters, including flooding, tornadoes, plow winds and other disasters caused by severe weather. PDAP may help cover the cost of uninsurable essential losses, cleanup, repairs and temporary relocation.\n\nOverland Flood Insurance: Saskatchewan insurance providers recently started to offer policies that protect homeowners from overland flooding. The Government of Saskatchewan advises all property owners to obtain adequate coverage for their property. To learn more, read this Overland Flood Insurance - Fact Sheet or contact your insurance company.\n\n1. Guidance\n\nPDAP may cover damage or loss to uninsurable, essential property. Your community must be approved for PDAP assistance before you can apply.\n\nWhat to do when disaster strikes\n\nBe safe\n\nRead the Flood Clean Up Guide.\n\nMake sure your property is free of hazards, such as wet electrical equipment, and that it is safe to begin cleaning.\n\nRemove water from your home and clean wet material as soon as possible to prevent mould problems.\n\nAny repairs or cleanup that can be safely postponed should wait until an adjuster can inspect the site. Remove the affected contents of your home and store them in a safe, dry area.\n\nCheck your coverage\n\nContact your private insurance provider to see if any damages may be covered.\n\nContact your municipality, First Nation band office or PDAP for a PDAP application.\n\nKeep detailed records\n\nKeep detailed written and photographic records. You will need to clearly show and/or\n\nprovide evidence of your damages and expenses to an adjuster.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWrite down a description of the situation, including:\n\nWhen and where the water entered your home;\n\nHow high the water was; and\n\nHow long the water sat before it was removed.\n\nTake pictures\n\nTake photos of all damage and record the date and location of each photo.\n\nTake photos of any emergency building materials used and keep samples of it.\n\nRecord all work and hours\n\nKeep a log of all work done to protect your home, including:\n\nhours worked;\n\nwho performed the work; and,\n\nwhat work was completed.\n\nRecord equipment usage costs and hours for items such as fans, dehumidifiers, shop vacs\n\nand sump pumps.\n\nIf the disaster is ongoing, be sure to record any emergency repairs and measures you take to prevent further losses.\n\nDecide whether to do the cleanup and repairs yourself or to hire a contractor\n\nDoing the work yourself\n\nCleanup work – PDAP pays 100% of the provincial hourly minimum wage (as determined at\n\nApril 1 of the year of the disaster) to claimants performing their own clean up. This is subject to the maximum hours as specified allowed for this activity in the PDAP General Claim Guidelines.\n\nRepair and restoration work – PDAP pays 140% of the provincial minimum wage\n\n(as determined at April 1 of the year of the disaster) to claimants performing their own repairs.\n\nHiring a contractor\n\nPDAP requires estimates from contractors in advance and pays for only rates within the Saskatchewan standards.\n\nPDAP only pays according to the adjuster allowance. The rates for contractors must fall within the Saskatchewan standards.\n\nRead the Current PDAP General Claim Guidelines to learn more about eligible claims.\n\n2. Eligibility\n\nIn order to qualify for aid, your community's local authority (whether it be a city, town, village, resort village, provincial or regional park, rural municipality, or First Nations) must seek approval by applying. If your locality isn't mentioned, reach out to them directly to notify them of your losses. They must apply to PDAP before you can proceed with submitting your claim.\n\nEligible communities for 2024\n\nName of Municipality Event Type Event Start Date Event End Date Cities Resort Villages Rural Municipalities RM of Langenburg Flooding April 2, 2024 April 4, 2024 RM of Keys Flooding April 7, 2024 April 15, 2024 Towns Town of Porcupine Plain Flooding April 12, 2024 April 21, 2024 Town of Carrot River Plow Wind June 23, 2024 June 24, 2024 Villages\n\nResidents, including homeowners, renters and residents living on First Nations\n\nThe damaged property must be your primary place of residence.

PDAP-assigned engineers and adjusters will need these photos throughout the application process.\n\nAvoid delays\n\nIt is important to us that claimants receive eligible financial assistance as quickly as possible. Wherever possible, PDAP tries to avoid potential delays where coordination with private insurance companies might be involved.\n\nAs part of the claim approval process, PDAP will\n\nrequire a coverage denial letter from your insurance company. However, we do not want\n\nthis requirement to delay your application and processing of your claim.\n\nOnce your community has been designated for PDAP assistance, pick up an application\n\nform from your city, town, village, resort village, First Nation, provincial or regional park,\n\nor rural municipality.\n\nPlease complete your application form and submit it to PDAP as soon as possible, so that we can begin processing your claim while you continue to work with your insurance company. Once you are able to submit the required documentation, your claim can then be completed much more quickly and eligible payments provided to you.\n\n5. Further Information\n\nOnce PDAP receives your application and determines that you are eligible for assistance, an adjuster will be assigned to your claim. The adjuster will arrange a time with you to complete\n\na damage assessment of your property.\n\nAfter the adjuster's report is submitted to PDAP, you will receive a letter with a Payment Worksheet describing eligible costs. In most cases, a single payment (also called a FastTrack Payment) based on this Payment Worksheet will be issued to you shortly thereafter.\n\nReimbursements for eligible structural repairs follow a different process. See Section 2.4.3\n\nof the current PDAP General Claim Guidelines for more details.\n\n6.
