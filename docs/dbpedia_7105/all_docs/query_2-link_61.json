        "text": "Canada offers an investor visa that allows foreign entrepreneurs to obtain permanent residency and citizenship through federal and provincial investment immigration programs. Successful applicants will receive work permits to begin operating their businesses in Canada. If their business is successful, they may be eligible to apply for permanent residency and citizenship in Canada. This page provides detailed information about federal and provincial business immigration programs, the costs associated with obtaining an investor visa, and other important considerations for foreign entrepreneurs who are interested in business immigration to Canada.\n\nWhat are Canada’s Investor Visa and Investment Immigration Programs?\n\nVarious immigration programs in Canada are tailored to foreign entrepreneurs, investors, and companies that make applicants eligible for permanent residency. As a result, there is no single Canada Investor program; instead, there are numerous options for investor immigration. These options can be divided into federal and provincial programs, described below.\n\nChoosing the right immigration program, federal or provincial, will play a significant role in the success of your immigration strategy. Selecting the program most suitable for your business and your background is essential. Our free instant assessment tool will certainly help you make the right decision. If you need further guidance, you can always rely on valuable advice during our scheduled meeting with our top business immigration lawyers. During this meeting, you will get an honest and unbiased assessment of the immigration possibilities available to you.\n\nCanada’s Federal Investor Programs\n\nThe following are business immigration programs that are created on the federal level.\n\nThe ICT program is ideal for foreign companies with a Canadian office or a subsidiary or looking to expand their operations in Canada. This immigration program is designed for businesses that want to transfer their employees from their foreign office to their Canadian office. Under this program, these employees will be granted a temporary work permit and will be eligible for permanent residency after working in Canada for a period of one year.\n\nUnder Canada’s Start-Up Visa program, up to 5 founding partners of an innovative foreign company could be eligible for an open work permit for up to 3 years. Additionally, applicants can become eligible for permanent residency in Canada through the SUV program by securing a Letter of Support or investment commitment from a designated organization.\n\nThe C11 Entrepreneur Stream is perfect for foreign entrepreneurs who want to invest in an existing Canadian business or start a new one. First, the entrepreneur will receive a temporary work permit to operate their business in Canada. After one year of operating the business, they become eligible for permanent residency.\n\nEntrepreneurs and investors can receive a work permit through the LMIA pathway and eventually permanent residency after 2 years of employment in Canada. However, this program is tailored more toward hiring foreign workers. Other above-mentioned programs are usually preferred over this one for investor immigration to Canada.\n\nProvincial Investor Immigration Programs\n\nOn the provincial level, Canadian provinces offer various immigration programs to invest and settle permanently in various parts of the country. These Provincial Nominee Programs (PNP) are listed below.\n\nAlberta’s PNP program is known as the Alberta Immigration Program (AAIP). One of the most widely recognized programs in the Canadian prairies is the program offered by Alberta due to its rapidly growing economy in the region. This program allows foreign entrepreneurs to obtain a work permit initially, and after operating their business in Alberta for 1 to 2 years, they become eligible to apply for permanent residency. Alberta Farm Stream:\n\nManaged by AAIP in collaboration with Alberta Agriculture and Forestry.\n\nTargets individuals with farm management skills and financial resources for investing in farming businesses in Alberta.\n\nEncourages the growth and development of the agricultural industry in the province.\n\nAlberta Foreign Graduate Entrepreneur Stream:\n\nDesigned for foreign-educated graduates from outside Canada.\n\nAllows graduates to launch start-up enterprises in Alberta and obtain permanent residence.\n\nFosters innovation and entrepreneurial talent from around the world.\n\nAlberta Graduate Entrepreneur Stream:\n\nSpecifically tailored for international graduates from Alberta post-secondary institutions.\n\nEnables graduates to establish and operate businesses within the province.\n\nSupports the retention of talented individuals who have already studied in Alberta.\n\nAlberta Rural Entrepreneur Stream:\n\nGeared towards entrepreneurs interested in starting or purchasing a business in a rural Alberta community.\n\nAims to promote economic growth and opportunities in rural areas.\n\nEncourages entrepreneurial investment outside urban centers.\n\nIn this province, you could be eligible for the BC PNP immigration pathway. This province’s PNP pathway is one of the most popular ones in Canada, along with Ontario’s program. There are 3 main streams within the program: Entrepreneur Immigration, Regional Pilot, and Strategic Projects. All 3 allow applicants to eventually become eligible for permanent residency in Canada.

When you first receive approval for your business immigration application, you will obtain a work permit as your Canadian company will employ you. You may become eligible for permanent residency after operating your business for at least a year. After receiving permanent residence, you can eventually qualify for Canadian citizenship.\n\nThe entire process of how to get an investor visa for Canada can be summarized as follows:\n\nEstablish or buy a Canadian company – The first step towards obtaining an investor visa is establishing or purchasing a Canadian company. This company will serve as the platform for your entrepreneurial activities in Canada. It is essential to ensure that your business aligns with the requirements of the chosen business immigration program.\n\nYour Canadian company employs you – Once your Canadian company is established or acquired, it will employ you as an executive, manager, or business owner. This employment relationship is a crucial component of your application and establishes your eligibility for a work permit.\n\nApply for a work permit through a business immigration program – With your Canadian company employing you, you can now apply for a work permit through a business immigration program. This work permit allows you to legally work and operate your business in Canada. The specific program you choose will depend on your eligibility criteria and long-term goals. Part of your application will include a comprehensive business plan.\n\nOperate your business in Canada for one year – After receiving your work permit, it is time to put your entrepreneurial skills to work and actively operate your business in Canada. Maintaining accurate records of your business activities during this period is important, as they will be required when applying for permanent residency.\n\nApply for permanent residency – Once you have successfully operated your business in Canada for at least 1 year, you become eligible to apply for permanent residence. This application is typically made through the business immigration program you initially entered. The immigration authorities will review your business performance, financials, and compliance with the program’s requirements.\n\nBecome eligible for Canadian citizenship – After obtaining permanent residency, you can work towards Canadian citizenship. The eligibility criteria for citizenship include meeting residency requirements, demonstrating proficiency in English or French, passing a citizenship test, and showing knowledge of Canadian history, values, and rights.\n\nHow Much Do You Need to Invest to Immigrate to Canada and Get Permanent Residence?\n\nIn our experience, you must invest between CAD $250,000 to $350,000+ to gain Canadian permanent residence and eventually citizenship as a foreign entrepreneur. With such an investment, you could apply for one of Canada’s investment immigration programs, under which you could become eligible for permanent residency after operating your business in Canada on a work permit for 1 – 2 years. The amount that you invest will largely depend on various factors such as:\n\nType of Business – The amount you would invest during your business immigration may be lower or higher than CAD $250,000 to $350,000 simply because of the needs of your business. Some businesses require a significant upfront investment as with manufacturing or industrial production. On the other hand, some businesses may be easier to set up compared to others, for example, buying a convenience store franchise or a nail salon. Some business immigrants choose to expand their foreign business to Canada, while others prefer to purchase or invest in an existing Canadian business.\n\nLocation – Canada is a vast country with a considerable market disparity from region to region. Bigger cities tend to require an investment on the higher end of the spectrum. For example, it may cost you CAD $180,000 to immigrate to Saskatoon by buying a business; in Toronto or Vancouver, it could add up to CAD $300,000. The difference in investment costs due to the location would be visible in real estate, staff, products, and service costs, to name a few.\n\nCompetition – Understanding your competition will allow you to gauge the costs of your business immigration more precisely. Our lawyers have extensive experience helping foreign entrepreneurs immigrate to Canada and accurately estimating the costs. We have exclusive knowledge of Canadian markets and can help you more efficiently understand the competition you might face as a foreign entrepreneur. Book a 1-hour consultation to gain tailored insights about how business immigration can work for you.\n\nViability and Permanent Residency – Once you are in Canada on a work permit operating your business, keeping your business viable is essential to switch to permanent residency. Only business owners with viable and successful companies can apply for permanent residence. Thus, for some, to keep or make their business profitable and viable may take more investment than other business immigrants. Again, this will depend on numerous factors. However, even if your business is unsuccessful and you are ineligible for PR, you can apply to extend your work permit and continue working on your business.\n\nAdvantages of Canada’s Citizenship by Investment Programs\n\nYou want to make Canada a new home for you, your business, and your family for numerous reasons. For instance:\n\nCanada has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world;\n\nYou can qualify for permanent residence much faster than in other countries;\n\nCanada is multicultural and diverse;\n\nSociety is highly accepting of all nationalities and cultures;\n\nCanada supports new businesses, and often, the government will provide subsidies and rebates for specific industry sectors;\n\nCanada has a free healthcare system, and\n\nEducation in Canada is highly affordable and is of a very high standard.\n\nHow to Succeed in Your Canada Investor Visa Application\n\nThere isn’t one particular thing you must focus on that will make you successful in obtaining your investor visa. Each business immigration program’s requirements are different. This means that your application must be tailored toward the program that you are applying for. However, some general guidelines could increase the chances of a successful application, such as:\n\nDocumentation. The entire application process for any of Canada’s Investor Visas involves showing evidence to support your claims. For example, you must show evidence of your finances and/or your company’s financial statements to show that you have funds required for business immigration. For a successful application, you will have to provide documents for almost everything ranging from your education to the projected revenue of your Canadian company. Although the government provides a list of mandatory documents, it is always advisable to go above and beyond and provide immigration officials with all the additional documentation.\n\nCommitment. One of the critical elements of a successful business immigration application is having evidence that you have already committed to executing your business plan. This means that you must invest in your Canadian business before submitting your application. This poses a risk to some foreign entrepreneurs because you are investing your money even before knowing whether you can move to Canada or not. However, immigration officials want to see that you have already started investing in Canada and not just promising to do so in the future. Evidence of your investment commitment can be securing a lease for your business, buying a business, buying essential equipment, or even hiring staff.\n\nProfessional Advice. Securing one of Canada’s Investment Visas through business immigration is not easy. Your immigration application will be subject to a highly detailed assessment by immigration officials. Thus, your application must be pristine. The stakes are high for business immigrants because you are investing your hard-earned money in a Canadian business with hopes of immigrating to operate that business. This is why it is crucial to have an experienced legal team to help you create an excellent case for your business immigration. You can schedule a 1-hour consultation with our lawyers, who will help you create the best immigration strategy for you and your business.\n\nFamily Members of Investor Visa Applicants in Canada\n\nMany business owners want to immigrate to Canada with their families. You should note that your family members will be eligible to come with you through business immigration. Usually, your spouse or a common-law partner would receive an open work permit. Also, depending on age, your children would obtain study permits or temporary residence permits. Your children can benefit from Canadian education and choose to study an array of exciting subjects, go to law school in Canada, or medical school and pursue their dream careers. As the principal applicant, the family members will also be eligible for permanent residency.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nBelow are some of the most asked questions based on our experience.\n\nCan you get Canadian citizenship by investment?\n\nThe short answer is no. There are no immigration programs that allow you to buy Canadian citizenship. The long answer is yes; however, you are not investing in citizenship but instead investing in a Canadian business. Once you have a business in Canada, you will be eligible for a work permit to operate that business. After operating it for 1 – 2 years, you will become eligible for permanent residency, and after you fulfill the requirements, you will become eligible for Canadian citizenship.\n\nUnderstanding that the investment alone will not grant you Canadian citizenship is crucial. The immigration programs that cater to business immigrants will put you on track to becoming Canadian if you fulfill numerous requirements. Do not be misled by any claims that you might see that offer Canadian citizenship for sale. Canada has never had such programs, and under the current immigration plan, there are no intentions of creating such programs.\n\nHow much money is needed for a Canada investment visa?\n\nThe minimum investment required for the Canada investment visa is between $250,000 and $350,000. However, according to federal immigration programs, there are no minimum or maximum investment requirements. How much you will invest will ultimately depend on the type of business you plan on operating in Canada, the location of your business, and the competition within your industry.\n\nHowever, the investment amount is not the only criterion for obtaining a Canada investment visa. Other requirements include a minimum net worth, business experience, and language proficiency. Additionally, applicants must pass a medical examination and a security background check. If you are interested in applying for a Canada investment visa, it’s recommended that you seek the guidance of a reputable immigration lawyer who can help you navigate the complex application process.\n\nWho is eligible for an investor visa in Canada?\n\nTo be eligible for an investor visa in Canada, you must:\n\nStart a new business or buy an existing business\n\nInvest between $250,000 and $350,000 into your business\n\nHave a detailed business plan\n\nHave business experience and business management skills\n\nBe able to transfer your skills and experience to Canada\n\nGenuine intention to operate a business in Canada\n\nEligibility for an investor visa in Canada is typically based on certain criteria established by the respective business immigration programs.\n\nHow to get an investment visa in Canada?\n\nThe process of obtaining an investor visa in Canada is as follows:\n\nResearch Business Immigration Programs – Explore the various business immigration programs available in Canada, such as the C-11 Entrepreneur Stream, Start-up Visa, LMIA work permit, or Intra-Company Transfer. Determine which program aligns with your goals and which program you are most suitable for.\n\nMeet Program Requirements – Review the specific requirements of the selected program, including net worth, investment amount, management experience, and other criteria. Ensure that you fulfill the prerequisites and gather the necessary documentation.\n\nPrepare Business Plan – Develop a comprehensive business plan that outlines your proposed investment or business venture in Canada. Your business plan should demonstrate its viability, market potential, and economic benefits for Canada.\n\nSubmit Application – Complete and submit your application for the chosen business immigration program, including all required documents and supporting evidence.\n\nApplication Review and Processing – The IRCC will thoroughly review your application. This includes assessing your business plan, financial capacity, management experience, and other relevant factors. Responding promptly to requests for additional information or clarification during this process is essential.\n\nReceive a Work Permit and Operate Your Business – If your application is approved, you will receive a work permit to work and operate your business in Canada. Follow your work permit’s regulations and guidelines and establish a successful business presence in Canada.\n\nApply for Permanent Residency – Once you have fulfilled the requirements specified by your chosen program, typically after operating your business in Canada for 1 to 2 years, you can apply for permanent residency. This involves submitting an application, supporting documents, and paying the necessary fees.\n\nCan I get PR if I invest in Canada?\n\nYes, investing in Canada could lead to permanent residency. Several business immigration programs offer a pathway to permanent residence based on investment and entrepreneurial activities. For example, programs like the C11, SUV, ICT, and LMIA allow applicants to obtain work permits that could qualify them for permanent residency after fulfilling specific requirements. These requirements could be: operating a business for a certain period, creating jobs for Canadians, or other prerequisites. Understanding the specific requirements of the program you choose to determine your eligibility for permanent residency through investment in Canada is crucial.\n\nWhat countries offer citizenship for investment?\n\nMany countries offer immigration schemes that can lead to citizenship, often referred to as golden visas in Canada. For example, America’s EB-5 program is similar to Canada’s Entrepreneur C11 pathway. Both offer the same result, a Work Permit, then PR (green card), and eventually citizenship, but the process varies dramatically.\n\nWhat are the benefits of federal investment programs?\n\nThere are various benefits of the federal programs, such as:\n\nThere are no mobility restrictions, and you can build businesses in any province and expand across different provinces as well;\n\nNo provincial residency requirements and more freedom to explore and adjust your business without breaching a business activity commitment list;\n\nThey focus more on attracting foreign investments and encouraging innovation/economic stimulus rather than mandating business success. You are not punished if your business fails as long as you genuinely work on and try executing your plan;\n\nThere are no industry restrictions. Some provincial programs are specifically geared toward fostering growth in specific industries. It may limit your access to them if you don’t fit into a particular sector/category;\n\nMost programs have no minimum net worth or investment requirement – you need to show that you have sufficient liquid funds to execute your business plan.\n\nCan you get Canadian citizenship by buying a property?\n\nCurrent Canadian immigration laws do not allow foreign investors to gain citizenship by buying property. However, under federal and provincial investment immigration programs, purchasing a property can contribute to your immigration as an entrepreneur.\n\nIf you are a foreign entrepreneur and decide to start a business in Canada, the property you purchase can become part of your investment in the Canadian economy and your business. By no means will this land you Canadian citizenship. Instead, the investment in property may make your business more viable, allowing you to gain permanent residency in Canada, which could lead to citizenship."
