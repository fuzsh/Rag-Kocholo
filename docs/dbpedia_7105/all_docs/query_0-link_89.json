        "text": "THE BATTLEFORDS — One never knows what to expect except the unexpected in March.\n\nTemperatures are moving toward plus numbers, but Saskatchewan's roads are still wintery.\n\nHighway 16 is still subject to swirling and drifting snow and icy sections —\n\nexcept for the stretch between Saskatoon and Lanigan, which has been upgraded to “seasonal” driving conditions.\n\nMost highways north of Highway 16 are yellow on the Highway Hotline map published by the Ministry of Highways. Yellow indicates winter conditions, which may include icy, slippery sections or swirling snow.\n\nThose areas of yellow extend down to Swift Current on the west side of the province and to Moosomin on the far east side.\n\nThe Trans Canada Highway is primarily seasonal except for two stretches of yellow, between Swift Current and Moose Jaw, where fog is reducing visibility, and Whitewood to the Manitoba border where there is loose snow and subject to freezing where the roads are wet.\n\nWeight restrictions\n\nThis is also the time of year when truckers and shippers must begin reducing loads on secondary highways in Saskatchewan. All secondary highways return to regulation weights, which will help prevent damage to these roads this spring.\n\nDuring the coldest months of December, January and February, roadbeds freeze and become stronger, and subsequently supports heavier truck loads.\n\nWhen the mild temperatures arrive, winter weights are removed. Effective at 12:01 a.m., Tuesday, March 15, any existing winter weights will be removed and revert to regulation weight.\n\n2022 Spring Road Bans\n\nSpring road restrictions are used by the province and rural municipalities to mitigate damage to infrastructure. Typically, these road restrictions start in March in the southwest and move in an east and northern direction. These restrictions remain in place for approximately six weeks or 42 days.\n\nThe road bans reduce allowable weights on RM roads and secondary weight provincial highways by 10 to 15 per cent and typically last about six weeks.\n\nNine Month Primary Weights\n\nSaskatchewan is unique because of its nine-month primary weight highways. As a large province with considerable difference in climate in the north and the south, there are different dates for when nine-month primary weights are in effect.\n\nIn the north of the province, the annual weight increase on the nine-month primary highways is from July 1 to March 31 of the following year. In the south of the province, the annual weight increase on the nine-month primary highways will occur earlier, from June 15 to March 15 of the following year. This helps sustain road conditions in the south, where spring thaw occurs earlier.\n\nTo check which highways are impacted by weight restrictions, please visit truck weight classifications and restrictions at saskatchewan.ca/trucking. Spring road bans will be posted as necessary under the \"New Spring Order\" link."
