It is not subject to the Government of Canada Web Standards and has not been altered or updated since it was archived. Please contact us to request a format other than those available.\n\nArchived\n\nThis page has been archived on the Web.\n\nNote:\n\nEasing border measures now allow for fully vaccinated travellers to enter into Canada for discretionary or non-essential travel. Unvaccinated foreign nationals seeking to enter for optional or discretionary (non-essential) purposes such as tourism, recreation, or entertainment continue to be prohibited entry to Canada under the Emergency Orders (the Orders) made under the Quarantine Act. Workers performing duties in an essential service or function are only exempt if they qualify for one of the specific exemptions in the Orders or the associated Group Exemptions.\n\nCanada's National Strategy for Critical Infrastructure defines critical infrastructure as the processes, systems, facilities, technologies, networks, assets, and services essential to the health, safety, security or economic well-being of Canadians and the effective functioning of government. The Strategy classifies critical infrastructure in Canada according to ten sectors:\n\nEnergy and Utilities\n\nInformation and Communication Technologies\n\nFinance\n\nHealth\n\nFood\n\nWater\n\nTransportation\n\nSafety\n\nGovernment\n\nManufacturing\n\nA number of jurisdictions within Canada have announced that business closures and border measures are in effect. Provincial and territorial announcements have highlighted that only organizations necessary to provide “essential services” are permitted to operate.\n\nPublic Safety Canada has developed a set of functions deemed essential in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to help provinces/territories, Indigenous communities, and municipalities protect their communities while maintaining the reliable operation of critical infrastructure services and functions to ensure the health, safety, and economic well-being of the population. These services and functions can also help the private sector self-identify as essential.\n\nThese services and functions are considered essential to preserving life, health and basic societal functioning. These include, but are not limited to, the functions performed by first responders, health care workers, critical infrastructure workers (e.g., hydro and natural gas), and workers who are essential to supply critical goods such as food and medicines. Workers who deliver essential services and functions should continue to do their jobs provided they have no symptoms of COVID-19 disease. Employers of these workers should take all possible steps to protect their health and safety by implementing practices and procedures recommended by public health authorities and providing appropriate protective equipment and products. Further, workers who can perform their tasks remotely should do so.\n\nMunicipal, provincial, territorial or Indigenous jurisdictions have the legislative authority to implement and execute response actions within their jurisdictions, while Public Safety Canada has a key role to play to facilitate and enable critical infrastructure security and resilience.\n\nAs many organizations are determining what services and functions are essential to the continuity of operations and incident response, Public Safety Canada has compiled a non-exhaustive list of essential services and functions to support this effort and assist in enabling the movement of critical infrastructure workers within and between jurisdictions. These essential services and functions are advisory in nature. This guidance is not, nor should it be considered to be a federal directive or standard.\n\nThis set of essential services and functions (Annex A) was developed in consultation with industry representatives. Public Safety Canada will continually consult on, and amend the list as events unfold. For specific questions and guidance on essential services and functions, please contact the appropriate authorities in your respective jurisdiction.\n\nAnnex A: Essential Services and Functions by Critical Infrastructure Sector\n\nHealth\n\nWorkers providing COVID-19 testing\n\nWorkers that perform critical clinical research needed for COVID-19 response\n\nCaregivers (e.g., physicians, dentists, psychologists, mid-level practitioners, nurses and assistants, infection control and quality assurance personnel, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists and assistants, social workers, counsellors, speech pathologists and diagnostic and therapeutic technicians and technologists)\n\nHospital and laboratory personnel (including accounting, administrative, admitting and discharge, engineering, epidemiological, source organs, plasma and blood donation, food service, housekeeping, medical records, information technology and operational technology, nutritionists, sanitarians, respiratory therapists, etc.)\n\nWorkers in other medical facilities (including ambulatory health and surgical, blood banks, clinics, community mental health, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation, end stage renal disease, health departments, home health care, hospices, hospitals, long term care, procurement organizations, psychiatric facilities, and rural health clinics)\n\nManufacturers, technicians, logistics and warehouse operators, and distributors of medical equipment, medical devices, personal protective equipment (PPE), medical gases, medical isotopes, pharmaceuticals and other health products, blood and blood products, vaccines, testing materials, cannabis for medical purposes, laboratory supplies, cleaning, sanitizing, disinfecting or sterilization supplies, tissue and paper towel products, and safety gear/clothing\n\nPublic health/community health workers, including those who compile, model, analyze and communicate public health information\n\nBlood and plasma donors and the employees of the organizations that operate and manage related activities\n\nWorkers that manage health plans, billing, and health information, who cannot practically work remotely\n\nWorkers who conduct public health functions, conducting epidemiologic surveillance, compiling, analyzing and communicating public health information, who cannot practically work remotely\n\nWorkers performing cybersecurity functions at healthcare and public health facilities, who cannot practically work remotely\n\nWorkers performing security, incident management, and emergency operations functions at or on behalf of healthcare entities, who cannot practically work remotely\n\nWorkers who support food, shelter, and social services, addictions treatment and outreach, supervised consumption sites and other necessities of life for economically disadvantaged or otherwise needy individuals, such as those residing in shelters or children in care\n\nPharmacy employees\n\nWorkers performing mortuary services, including funeral homes, crematoriums, and cemetery workers\n\nWorkers who coordinate with other organizations to ensure the proper recovery, handling, identification, transportation, tracking, storage, and disposal of human remains and personal effects;
