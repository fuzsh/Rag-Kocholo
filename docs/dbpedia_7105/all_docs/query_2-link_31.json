Be sure to pay special attention to the electives that are required for second year specialties (listed at the bottom of the Courses section below).\n\nAccountancy\n\nAccounting is about more than numbers; it's about conducting audits, doing business analyses and presenting financial information so managers and investors can make informed decisions. Accounting is often called the language of business. If you want to be one of the people at the table when critical business decisions are made, Saskatchewan Polytechnic's Business Accountancy specialty will appeal to you.\n\nYou'll study cost accounting, auditing, taxation, finance, financial accounting and more. You'll apply theory to real-world situations in business simulations, case studies and group projects. You'll use industry standard software in your courses. Optional co-operative education work terms are a great way to gain valuable experience and make industry connections - while earning money.\n\nYou can apply to use your diploma for credit in a degree program at the University of Regina's Paul J. Hill School of Business, University of Saskatchewan's Edward School of Business, Royal Roads University, University of Lethbridge or online degree programs at Athabasca University. You can also apply to use your diploma credits for standing toward the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation. For more information, visit www.cpacanada.ca.\n\nAccountancy specialists are in demand. Many grads have jobs lined up before they graduate. You'll find opportunities in every sector: commercial, industrial, institutional, government and non-profit. You could work for an accounting firm or in the accounting department of a private company or government department.\n\nFinancial Services\n\nIf you're interested in a career that combines working with money and working with people, Saskatchewan Polytechnic's Business Financial Services specialty diploma is a great choice. Financial services is more than banking - it's loans, mortgages, investment products, financial planning and advising, money management, insurance, risk management and more. Essentially it's helping people with their financial health from the cradle to the grave. With so many services and an aging workforce, it's also an industry with exceptional potential for career growth and mentorship.\n\nYou'll develop specialized knowledge and skills in residential mortgages, bank operations, financial products and services, loans and credit, personal financial planning, tax fundamentals, advanced investment products and more.\n\nPractical exercises and hands-on activities give you a chance to apply what you learn. A unique seminar course on strategic advising in your final semester gives you a chance to integrate theory and practice in a simulated retail banking environment. It's a chance to polish your skills before entering the workforce.\n\nSaskatchewan Polytechnic works with the Canadian Securities Institute (CSI) to ensure students are meeting actual marketplace needs. As part of your course requirements, you must register with the CSI and purchase specified textbooks that will be used for Saskatchewan Polytechnic's Investment Funds in Canada preparation course. Saskatchewan Polytechnic will guide you through your CSI registration process and textbook purchase.\n\nGraduating with a financial services specialty diploma qualifies you to apply for advanced standing into degree programs at the University of Regina's Paul J. Hill School of Business, Royal Roads University, University of Lethbridge or online degree programs at Athabasca University. Graduates of this specialty may also receive transfer credits towards the Certified in Management designation through the Canadian Institute of Management and the Certified Logistics Professional designation through the Canadian Institute of Traffic and Transportation.\n\nGraduates are prepared to work in a multitude of positions including management trainees in the financial market (financial institutions). These include chartered banks, investment firms, credit unions, trust companies, and insurance companies.\n\nHuman Resources\n\nHuman resources offers the best of two career paths; working with people and working in a business environment. On a day-to-day basis, you might be dealing with benefits, payroll, labour relations or recruitment issues. But you'll also be involved in the bigger picture - designing competitive employee packages, supporting a productive work environment and creating a healthy organizational culture. Saskatchewan Polytechnic's Business human resources specialty provides the broad-based training you need to work in any sector.\n\nThis Human Resources specialty is available on campus in Moose Jaw or through flexible learning options (online and evening). You'll focus on in-depth training in the application of business management practices to employment situations, employee engagement, compensation and benefits, labour and employee relations, organizational effectiveness and behavior, recruitment and selection, training and development, and workplace wellness.\n\nIn addition to lecture material, you'll participate in class assignments, role-playing, demonstrations, and simulations. The emphasis on learning by doing will help you translate theory into real-life skills.\n\nAs a student you have the option to spend a year taking three consecutive four-month paid co-operative education work terms. Work terms not only let you develop your skills on the job, they provide an excellent introduction to potential employers.\n\nYou can use your Business Human Resources specialty diploma for credit in degree programs at the University of Regina's Paul J. Hill School of Business, University of Saskatchewan's Edwards School of Business, Royal Roads University, University of Lethbridge or online degree programs at Athabasca University. Graduates of this specialty may also receive transfer credits towards the Certified in Management designation through the Canadian Institute of Management and the Certified Logistics Professional designation through the Canadian Institute of Traffic and Transportation.\n\nA Business diploma in Human Resources gives you a lot of choices. You could work in the HR department of a large multinational company, government agency or health organization. You could be part of a smaller team or even the only specialist in a small business. Where you work impacts what you do. In a smaller organization, you might be a generalist doing a wide variety of HR tasks. In a larger organization, you could be an HR manager, recruiter, labour relations assistant, compensation analyst, training coordinator or benefits administrator.\n\nInsurance\n\nInsurance is big business in Canada. People, businesses, and organizations rely on insurance professionals to help manage risk and protect against loss. With more than 25 percent of the current workforce* expected to retire in the next few years, now is a great time to start a career in insurance.\n\nInsurance brokers, appraisers, claims investigators and marketing representatives work closely with people and businesses. Insurance adjusters, underwriters, loss control specialists, risk managers, and actuaries work behind the scenes balancing the numbers.\n\nSaskatchewan Polytechnic is one of only nine colleges and universities in Canada to offer a dedicated insurance program, and the only one in Saskatchewan. The Insurance specialty is designed with extensive input from Saskatchewan's insurance industry and the Insurance Institute of Canada.\n\nIn this second year specialty, you'll take courses in insurance against liability, insurance broker/agent skills, insurance on property, loss adjusting, relationship selling, commercial law, and underwriting.\n\nWhen you graduate, you'll have written five of the 10 Insurance Institute of Canada exams necessary to earn your Chartered Insurance Professional (CIP) designation. You can also apply to use your diploma for a head start in degree programs at the University of Regina's Paul J. Hill School of Business, Royal Roads University, University of Lethbridge or online degree programs at Athabasca University. Graduates of this specialty may also receive transfer credits towards the Certified in Management designation through the Canadian Institute of Management and the Certified Logistics Professional designation through the Canadian Institute of Traffic and Transportation.\n\nThere are more job openings than insurance specialty grads. You'll find your skills in demand in communities around the province. Work as an insurance broker/agent in a large firm or as an independent broker. Build a career as a claims adjuster, underwriter or appraiser for government or private insurance agencies.\n\n* Insurance Institute of Canada\n\nManagement\n\nIf you like being part of decision-making processes and are interested in organizational culture and interpersonal dynamics, the Business Management specialty will appeal to you. Business management is many things - efficient management of people, effective organization of resources, and strategic planning for growth. You could work in an administrative role in a wide range of public and privately owned enterprises, crown corporations and government organizations, or start your own business.\n\nYou'll develop knowledge and skills in interpersonal and organizational behavior, finance and managerial accounting, entrepreneurship, digital media, leadership and decision making, cross-cultural management, project management, and strategic management.\n\nYou can take a year to participate in the optional three consecutive four-month paid co-operative education work terms between semesters three and four. It's a chance to try different job areas in administration and discover the best fit for your career goals.\n\nSaskatchewan Polytechnic's Business Management specialty diploma is accredited by the Canadian Institute of Management (CIM). When you graduate, you'll have met the educational requirements for the Certified in Management (CIM) professional designation. After two years of managerial (or supervisory) work experience, you can apply for the right to put the highly respected \"CIM\" designation after your name.\n\nYou can also use your Business Management specialty diploma for credit in degree programs at the University of Regina's Paul J. Hill School of Business, University of Saskatchewan's Edwards School of Business, Royal Roads University, University of Lethbridge or online degree programs at Athabasca University. Graduates of this specialty may also receive transfer credits towards the Certified Logistics Professional designation through the Canadian Institute of Traffic and Transportation.\n\nWhen you graduate, you will have the knowledge and practical skills for a wide variety of administrative and supervisory jobs in many types of organizations. Or you can apply what you have learned to grow your own business.\n\nMarketing\n\nA career in marketing can take you in many directions - branding, research, public relations, retail, advertising sales or event planning. And you can find jobs in these areas in almost every sector, from health agencies to natural resource companies to non-profit organizations.\n\nOur dynamic curriculum includes social media, computer-based simulations, industry-standard Adobe software, crisis management, and other emerging trends.\n\nYou can develop on-the-job skills, introduce yourself to different employers and test-drive different types of jobs over the year during three consecutive four-month paid co-operative education work terms.\n\nYou'll gain knowledge and skills in advertising, branding and creative design, digital and social media, market research and strategic marketing, project management and relationship selling, public relations, and retail strategy and development.\n\nYou'll get a hands-on education using social media, writing copy, doing mock presentations, conducting research, creating computer-based simulations, participating in group projects and more. You'll also get involved in the community; Saskatchewan Polytechnic's Business Marketing specialty diploma gives you an opportunity to work on real projects for community-based organizations.\n\nYou can apply to use your Business Marketing specialty diploma for credit in degree programs at the University of Regina's Paul J. Hill School of Business, University of Saskatchewan's Edwards School of Business, Royal Roads University, University of Lethbridge or online degree programs at Athabasca University.

Use your skills in your own business, work for an advertising agency or design firm, or look for opportunities in larger organizations and government agencies.\n\nMunicipal Administration\n\nThe Municipal Administration specialty will give you the skills you need to successfully manage the day-to-day operations of a town or municipality. For the first time in Saskatchewan, this specialty offers applied learning at the diploma level that will prepare you for success as a senior government manager or official.\n\nThis specialty has been developed in partnership with the following organizations: Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA), Saskatchewan Association for Rural Municipalities (SARM), Urban Municipal Administrators' Association of Saskatchewan (UMAAS), Canadian Association of Municipal Administrators (CAMA) and the Saskatchewan Ministry of Government Relations.\n\nThe curriculum has been developed based on the direction of these organizations and their members to ensure graduates are prepared for demanding and rewarding roles in municipal administration.\n\nKey learning outcomes of the specialty include managing human resources and labour relations in a municipality, applying municipal laws, ordinances, and protocols, developing strategic communication, interpersonal and project management skills, applying principles of municipal accounting and risk management by implementing tax laws, financial reporting protocols, and protocols for managing public utilities.\n\nWith 10 courses developed specifically to address the job requirements of senior government managers and officials, this program will equip you with the specific knowledge, skills and attitudes you need for a successful career in municipal administration.\n\nAdditionally, this specialty is offered online so that you can complete the program from anywhere, anytime, and at a pace that works for you. This flexible delivery model allows you to continue working while you upgrade your knowledge and skills.\n\nSport Management\n\nFor more information contact Stephen Kirzinger, program head, Business diploma, Sport Management: stephen.kirzinger@saskpolytech.ca.\n\nIf you love sports but are unsure how to transform that passion into a meaningful career path, then the Sport Management specialty may be right for you!\n\nSport management combines your love of sports with business management fundamentals, making it a meaningful and rewarding career path.

When we determine that you meet the program's admission requirements, you will be offered admission based on the date you fully qualify for the program. The earlier you provide the appropriate documents and information that qualify you for admission to the next intake, the earlier you might begin your studies. Your application, once qualified, is always considered for the next intake.\n\nApplicants to programs with multiple intakes in an academic year remain in the application pool until the last intake for that academic year has begun. Programs using the FQFA process receive applications year round and maintain an application pool for each academic year. Qualified applicants who are not offered a seat must reapply for the next academic year.\n\nSponsored programs or programs targeted to specific groups do not accept applications year round or maintain an application pool.\n\nSee Admission Processes for more information about this method of admission.\n\nTuition and fees\n\nEstimates are based on current rates and are subject to change.
