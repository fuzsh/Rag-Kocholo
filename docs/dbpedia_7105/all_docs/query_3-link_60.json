        "text": "REGINA, SK, March 13, 2024 /CNW/ - Bridges and culverts in communities across Saskatchewan will be replaced or upgraded after a combined investment of more than $8.2 million from the federal and provincial governments along with municipalities.\n\nThese 12 projects were announced by Minister Dan Vandal and Minister Don McMorris. The new bridges will create safer and more efficient local routes. Investing in culverts will ease the flow of water underneath roads, relieving potential drainage issues in the future.\n\nRural municipalities, like the RMs of Enniskillen No. 3 and Frenchman Butte No. 501 will see new culverts to help with safe water flow, while others like Lomond No. 37 and Star City No. 428 will receive funding for bridge replacement projects.\n\nFind out more about each of these projects and how they are going to improve the connections between communities and enhance reliable water drainage across the province for years to come.\n\nQuotes\n\n\"Investing in rural community infrastructure projects, such as bridges and culverts, creates more seamless transportation and water distribution services. By providing new life cycles to these essential pieces of infrastructure, we continue to deliver for Saskatchewanians through investments that will make a real difference to their everyday lives.\"\n\nThe Honourable Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, PrairiesCan and CanNor, on behalf of the Honourable Sean Fraser, Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities\n\n\"Our government understands the impact these projects will have on the communities receiving this funding. The importance of replacing and creating new infrastructure to build and protect our communities cannot be overstated. Projects like this could not happen without the cooperation of the communities themselves. Our government is excited to have these projects get underway for our communities to reap the long-term benefits of growth and a stronger Saskatchewan.\"\n\nThe Honourable Don McMorris, Saskatchewan's Minister of Government Relations\n\nQuick Facts\n\nThe federal government is investing $1,378,474 through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program. The Government of Saskatchewan is investing $2,756,123 and the municipalities are contributing a combined $4,134,596 to their respective projects.\n\nFederal funding is conditional on fulfilling all requirements related to consultation with Indigenous groups and environmental assessment obligations.\n\nThe Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure stream supports projects that increase access to more efficient and reliable energy sources, improve community infrastructure, and improve internet connectivity for rural and northern communities.\n\nIncluding today's announcement, over 122 infrastructure projects under the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure stream have been announced in Saskatchewan, with a total federal contribution of more than $106 million and a total provincial contribution of more than $99 million.\n\nUnder the Investing in Canada Plan, the federal government is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada's rural and northern communities.\n\nInfrastructure Canada helps address complex challenges that Canadians face every dayâ€”ranging from the rapid growth of our cities, to climate change, to environmental threats to our water and land.\n\nOn December 18, 2023, the federal government launched the Framework to Build a Green Prairie Economy, which highlights the need for a collaborative, region-specific approach to sustainability, focusing on strengthening the coordination of federal programs, and initiatives with significant investments. This Framework is a first step in a journey that will bring together multiple stakeholders. PrairiesCan, the federal department that diversifies the economy across the Canadian prairies, has dedicated $100 million over three years to support projects aligned with priority areas identified by Prairie stakeholders to build a stronger, more sustainable, and inclusive economy for the Prairie provinces and Canada.\n\nInfrastructure Canada is supporting the Framework to Build a Green Prairie Economy to encourage greater collaboration on investment opportunities, leverage additional funding, and attract new investments across the Prairies that better meet their needs.\n\nRelated Products\n\nBackgrounder: Bridging communities together across Saskatchewan with joint federal and provincial funding\n\nAssociated Links\n\nInvesting in Canada: Canada's Long-Term Infrastructure Plan\n\nhttps://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/plan/icp-publication-pic-eng.html\n\nInvesting in Canada Plan Project Map\n\nhttps://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/gmap-gcarte/index-eng.html\n\nRural and Northern Community Infrastructure Stream\n\nhttps://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/plan/rnc-crn-eng.html\n\nFederal infrastructure investments in Saskatchewan\n\nhttps://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/plan/prog-proj-sk-eng.html\n\nCanada Community-Building Fund\n\nhttps://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/plan/gtf-fte-eng.html\n\nCanada Community-Building Fund Allocation Table\n\nhttps://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/prog/gtf-fte-tab-eng.html\n\nBuilding a Green Prairie Economy Act\n\nhttps://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-9.88/page-1.html\n\nBuilding a Green Prairie Economy\n\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/prairies-economic-development/programs/green-prairie-economy.html\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn\n\nWeb: Infrastructure Canada\n\nSOURCE Infrastructure Canada"
