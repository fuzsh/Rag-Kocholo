Nomination of a site does not guarantee that it will be abandoned and/or reclaimed under the program.\n\nASCP program funds cannot be used by licensees to abandon and/or reclaim sites where the licensee is in arrears to the landowner on surface lease payments, unless there is express consent from the landowner to do so.\n\nThe landowner nomination process is meant to facilitate information sharing between licensees and landowners to identify abandonment and reclamation opportunities of mutual interest.\n\nMore information, including how to nominate sites on your land,\n\ncan be found on the Accelerated Site Closure Program.\n\nBaldwinton Grid Highway 40 Access\n\nCouncil continues to have the first mile of Baldwinton Grid, South off of Highway 40 closed.\n\nIn past years, water had covered a portion of this road.\n\nThis road has been deemed unfit for travel, even with the water receeding.\n\nFor everyone's safety it has been closed to traffic.\n\nWelcome\n\nThe Rural Municipality of Hillsdale No. 440 is located in the West Central part of Saskatchewan.
