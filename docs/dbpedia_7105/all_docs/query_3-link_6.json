        "text": "What We’re Learning\n\nIn total, 36 Saskatchewan municipalities were assessed by the Saskatchewan Municipalities Sustainability Index using 934 documents. This included six cities, 15 smaller urban centers, 10 rural municipalities and five northern municipalities.\n\nCity municipalities achieved the highest scores for sustainability. Among 36 municipalities reviewed, cities had the highest average score (21.5 out of 24) for economic, social, and environmental sustainability with no city municipalities scored as absent in any of the 12 policy areas. The project team noted that cities were also more likely to have official community plans that allowed for alignment with economic, social, and environmental goals. Using the index scores, cities were followed by northern municipalities (16.8), small urban municipalities (15.7), and finally rural municipalities (10.6). Municipalities were more likely to have developed plans related to reduced waste generation, partnerships, integrated water management and terrestrial freshwater ecosystems. Across indicators, fewer municipalities had developed plans related to sustainable tourism, affordable housing, and access to modern energy.\n\nBarriers can become facilitators. Stakeholders from Saskatchewan municipalities shared similar barriers to exploring and implementing sustainability initiatives, including lack of revenue options, restrictive funding and legislation, limited planning, lack of engagement and partnership, and too little transparency. However, many stakeholders also felt barriers could become opportunities in the right circumstances, for example while restrictive funding is a barrier, funding opportunities from other levels of government can be a facilitator of sustainability initiatives and plans.\n\nAdministrative skills for sustainability are in-demand.\n\nKnowledge and skills capacity were identified as a major factor influencing the success or failure of sustainable development for many participants. Many municipalities noted a challenge in finding and retaining experienced administrators and those in place were so tied up with their day-to-day duties that they did not have the free time to research suitable upskilling courses or to be away from the office for training. This skills gap extends to municipal officials, including councilors, whose lack of sustainability knowledge and skills can translate to a lack of political will for sustainability initiatives generally. Several stakeholders shared failed attempts to provide councilors with training opportunities.\n\nNot everyone supports sustainability as a goal. Sustainable development and the UN principles were not uniformly accepted by people or political leaders in Saskatchewan. The roundtables hosted by the project team included groups aggressively opposed to the concept of sustainability, the United Nations and the SDGs. Stakeholders in discussions with the project team also shared their experience with municipal councilors skeptical of sustainability principles and initiatives. These opposing views pose a significant barrier to municipal sustainability planning and implementation.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nCanadian municipalities play a pivotal role in Canada’s progress towards its commitments to the sustainable development goals.\n\nMunicipalities are on the front-lines of many of the acute economic, social, and environmental challenges facing Canada today including aging infrastructure, lack of affordable housing, increasingly frequent climate related disasters like forest fires and flooding, and the accessibility of broadband internet access.\n\nThis project highlights the benefits of looking across municipalities to understand the progress towards economic, social, and environmental sustainability targets within a larger region, and cultivating connections across municipalities to support awareness and progress. The Municipalities Sustainability Index was a useful tool to engage municipal stakeholders across Saskatchewan in identifying shared challenges, but also to highlight successes that merit wider adoption.\n\nThis project holds lessons for municipal, provincial, and federal decision makers, as well as municipal associations on the local challenges faced by different types of municipalities in meeting sustainable development goals. The project team encouraged actors like Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association, Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities, and New North to deepen their role bringing together Saskatchewan municipalities in sector-wide conversations about sustainability and to share success stories. However, efforts to convene municipalities across Saskatchewan are complemented by national efforts from The Federation of Canadian Municipalities, which provides municipalities across Canada with issue expertise and advocacy, funding opportunities, and events to share learnings across economic, social, and environmental issues."
