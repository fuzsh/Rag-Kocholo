Abstract

Co-cultivation of the fungal strains Penicillium sp. Ma(M3)V and Trichoderma sp. Gc(M2)1 in malt 2% medium led to the production of two novel, unusual polyketides, (Z)-2-ethylhex-2-enedioic acid and (E)-4-oxo-2-propylideneoct-7-enoic acid. Analysis of spectroscopic data enabled the structure determination of both compounds.
