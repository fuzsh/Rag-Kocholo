        "text": "Introduction\n\nNatural environments are heterogeneous in many aspects. Nutrient composition in the soil is subject to spatiotemporal variations, which create very distinct and ephemeral microhabitats [\n\n1\n\nHutchings M.\n\nWijesinghe D.\n\nJohn E.\n\nThe effects of heterogeneous nutrient supply on plant performance: a survey of responses, with special reference to clonal herbs.\n\n]. Fungi cope with this discontinuous nutrient distribution by the formation of a continuous (syncytial) network of arrays of linearly arranged cells (hyphae), referred to as a mycelium, which allows them to access nutrient-rich microhabitats and to achieve nutritional homeostasis within all cells of the multicellular organism [\n\n2\n\nBurnett J.H.\n\nFungal Populations and Species.\n\n,\n\n3\n\nRayner A.\n\nGriffith G.\n\nAinsworth A.\n\nMycelial interconnectedness.\n\n].\n\nFungal mycelia grow by tip extension of individual hyphae, resulting in indeterminate radial growth, whereas secondary and further branches populate intermediary regions to optimize nutrient acquisition [\n\n4\n\nProsser J.I.\n\nTrinci A.P.\n\nA model for hyphal growth and branching.\n\n]. The formation of a network is accomplished by hyphal fusion (anastomosis) [\n\n5\n\nGlass N.L.\n\nRasmussen C.\n\nRoca M.G.\n\nRead N.D.\n\nHyphal homing, fusion and mycelial interconnectedness.\n\n,\n\n6\n\nGlass N.L.\n\nJacobson D.J.\n\nShiu P.K.\n\nThe genetics of hyphal fusion and vegetative incompatibility in filamentous ascomycete fungi.\n\n,\n\n7\n\nCarlile M.J.\n\nWatkinson S.C.\n\nGooday G.W.\n\nThe Fungi.\n\n]. Depending on the fungal species, such networks can become quite large, ranging from cubic centimeters to many cubic meters, as is the case for ectomycorrhizal systems or cord-forming basidiomycetes [\n\n8\n\nBoddy L.\n\nSaprotrophic cord-forming fungi: meeting the challenge of heterogeneous environments.\n\n]. The network as such can be continuously remodeled and is therefore highly dynamic, adapting to different underlying nutrient conditions, damage, or assault by meso-fauna [\n\n8\n\nBoddy L.\n\nSaprotrophic cord-forming fungi: meeting the challenge of heterogeneous environments.\n\n,\n\n9\n\nFricker M.D.\n\nLee J.A.\n\nBebber D.P.\n\nTlalka M.\n\nHynes J.\n\nDarrah P.R.\n\nWatkinson S.C.\n\nBoddy L.\n\nImaging complex nutrient dynamics in mycelial networks.\n\n,\n\n10\n\nFricker M.D.\n\nTlalka M.\n\nBebber D.\n\nTakagi S.\n\nWatkinson S.C.\n\nDarrah P.R.\n\nFourier-based spatial mapping of oscillatory phenomena in fungi.\n\n].

Nutrient reallocation (in the form of radiotracers) through mycelial networks was predominantly examined and observed within cords or rhizomorphs of different basidiomycete species, where it is claimed to be important for the sufficient delivery and distribution of metabolically relevant nutrients to growing tips [\n\n16\n\nAgerer R.\n\nExploration types of ectomycorrhizae: a proposal to classify ectomycorrhizal mycelial systems according to their patterns of differentiation and putative ecological importance.\n\n,\n\n17\n\nGenney D.R.\n\nAnderson I.C.\n\nAlexander I.J.\n\nFine-scale distribution of pine ectomycorrhizas and their extramatrical mycelium.\n\n,\n\n18\n\nTlalka M.\n\nBebber D.\n\nDarrah P.R.\n\nWatkinson S.C.\n\nMycelial networks: nutrient uptake, translocation and role in ecosystems.\n\n,\n\n19\n\nWatkinson S.C.\n\nBoddy L.\n\nBurton K.\n\nDarrah P.R.\n\nEastwood D.\n\nFricker M.D.\n\nTlalka M.\n\nNew approaches to investigating the function of mycelial networks.\n\n].

For example, the sessile and heterotrophic lifestyle of fungi entails constraints when encountering competitors, predators, or parasites. In order to defend themselves against these antagonists, fungi have developed an impressive arsenal of toxic metabolites and proteins [\n\n25\n\nSpiteller P.\n\nChemical defence strategies of higher fungi.\n\n,\n\n26\n\nRohlfs M.\n\nChurchill A.C.L.\n\nFungal secondary metabolites as modulators of interactions with insects and other arthropods.\n\n,\n\n27\n\nStadler M.\n\nSterner O.\n\nProduction of bioactive secondary metabolites in the fruit bodies of macrofungi as a response to injury.\n\n,\n\n28\n\nSabotič J.\n\nOhm R.A.\n\nKünzler M.\n\nEntomotoxic and nematotoxic lectins and protease inhibitors from fungal fruiting bodies.\n\n,\n\n29\n\nWang M.\n\nTriguéros V.\n\nPaquereau L.\n\nChavant L.\n\nFournier D.\n\nProteins as active compounds involved in insecticidal activity of mushroom fruitbodies.\n\n].

Thus far, studies of inducible defense responses of fungal mycelia have focused on transcriptional and/or translational changes of the entire organism (mycelium). The defense response of individual hyphae, the eventual propagation of these local responses to other parts of the mycelium, as well as the ecological significance of such coordinated behavior remain to be elucidated [\n\n35\n\nCrowther T.W.\n\nBoddy L.\n\nHefin Jones T.\n\nFunctional and ecological consequences of saprotrophic fungus-grazer interactions.\n\n,\n\n36\n\nCrowther T.W.\n\nA’Bear A.D.\n\nImpacts of grazing soil fauna on decomposer fungi are species-specific and density-dependent.\n\n,\n\n37\n\nBoddy L.\n\nWood J.\n\nRedman E.\n\nHynes J.\n\nFricker M.D.\n\nFungal network responses to grazing.\n\n].\n\nIn order to understand how the vegetative mycelium of C. cinerea responds to local changes in the environment, we developed a microfluidic platform designed to constrain the area of interaction between fungal mycelia and nematodes and visualize events occurring within individual hyphae (fungal-nematode-interaction [FNI] device). Microfluidic manipulation of fluid volumes on the microscale has been employed in a multitude of different biological disciplines, notably for the study of whole (living) organisms in recent years [\n\n38\n\nStanley C.E.\n\nGrossmann G.\n\ni Solvas X.C.\n\ndeMello A.J.\n\nSoil-on-a-chip: microfluidic platforms for environmental organismal studies.\n\n]. Importantly, our novel FNI platform enables the precise manipulation of the microenvironment, including the addition of nematodes and abiotic stimuli [\n\n39\n\nStanley C.E.\n\nStöckli M.\n\nvan Swaay D.\n\nSabotič J.\n\nKallio P.T.\n\nKünzler M.\n\ndeMello A.J.\n\nAebi M.\n\nProbing bacterial-fungal interactions at the single cell level.\n\n], and allows the fungus of interest, growing both within and outside of the confrontation area, to be monitored. In combination with high-resolution, automated imaging techniques, this platform facilitates the study of dynamic biological processes at the cellular level without losing spatial or temporal resolution. We constructed C. cinerea reporter strains to visualize and quantify the induction of genes coding for defense proteins upon challenge with nematodes. As a result of combining the reporter strain with the microfluidic platform, we were able to follow the defense response of the fungus in real time and with single-hypha resolution. The same setup was used to introduce the fluorescent glucose analog 2-Deoxy-2-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-D-glucose (2-NBDG) to precise locations within the microfluidic device to follow nutrient transport through the mycelium.\n\nThis experimental setup revealed that the transcriptional induction of C. cinerea defense genes in response to predation by A. avenae is mainly localized to those parts of the vegetative mycelium that are in direct contact with the predator. We could, however, identify a distinct hyphal subtype in the mycelium of this basidiomycete that was capable of propagating the defense response over several millimeters both in the acropetal and basipetal direction. Remarkably, our time-lapse studies revealed an oscillation of the fluorescence signal with a constant periodicity of approximately 4–6 hr within these hyphae. The same hyphal subtype also transported the glucose analog 2-NBDG with similar kinetics, but propagation of the defense signal and transport of 2-NBDG were mutually exclusive when triggered and applied, respectively, at opposite locations within the device. These findings can be explained by a periodical switch in the direction of solute transport and coordinated opening and closure of septa in these hyphae.\n\nResults\n\nLocal and Specific Defense Response of C. cinerea against the Fungivorous Nematode A. avenae\n\nTo monitor the spatial distribution of the C. cinerea defense response upon predation by A. avenae with cellular resolution, we first designed a microfluidic device (FNI) in which the access of nematodes to the growing mycelium is restricted to specific regions, namely the “confrontation area” (Figures 1A, 1B, S1A, and S1B). Spatial restriction is achieved by incorporating constriction channels between the confrontation area and the basipetal and acropetal monitoring areas. Due to their small width and height (10 μm) and long length (500 μm), nematodes cannot enter these channels. We also introduced a control area for examination of non-confronted hyphae of the same mycelial colony. Second, we constructed various C. cinerea AmBm reporter strains carrying either dTomato or eGFP expression cassettes driven by the promoters of the cgl2 and cctx2 genes to visualize the expression of these genes. The expression of both genes is induced in the vegetative mycelium of monokaryotic C. cinerea strain Okayama 7 under nematode feeding pressure, and the encoded proteins are toxic to different fungal foraging phyla [\n\n33\n\nBleuler-Martínez S.\n\nButschi A.\n\nGarbani M.\n\nWälti M.A.\n\nWohlschlager T.\n\nPotthoff E.\n\nSabotiĉ J.\n\nPohleven J.\n\nLüthy P.\n\nHengartner M.O.\n\net al.\n\nA lectin-mediated resistance of higher fungi against predators and parasites.\n\n,\n\n34\n\nPlaza D.F.\n\nSchmieder S.S.\n\nLipzen A.\n\nLindquist E.\n\nKünzler M.\n\nIdentification of a novel nematotoxic protein by challenging the model mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea with a fungivorous nematode.\n\n].\n\nIn our setup, induction of defense gene expression was most prominent for parts of the mycelium that were directly confronted with the nematode (Figure 1C). Within the confrontation area, the vast majority of hyphae expressed dTomato at high levels, whereas in the control area, hyphae did not show any induction of the cgl2p-dTom reporter gene 18–24 hr after addition of the nematodes (Figures 1C and 1D).\n\nThe local induction of defense genes after nematode foraging was also demonstrated for the second reporter strain, C. cinerea AmBm cctx2p-dTom, encoding the dTomato expression cassette under the control of the promoter for the chimerolectin CCTX2. Again, production of dTomato was only detected when nematodes were present and not in the control area (Figure S1C). Because the level of dTomato production observed in this strain was lower, compared to dTomato production driven by the cgl2 promoter, further analyses of the C. cinerea defense response were carried out with the C. cinerea AmBm cgl2p-dTom strain.\n\nA. avenae feeds by piercing the hyphal cell wall and ingesting the content of a hyphal compartment (Video S1). The active feeding by A. avenae seems to be required for the induction of the cgl2 promoter, because the application of dead A. avenae did not, in accordance with previous results [\n\n33\n\nBleuler-Martínez S.\n\nButschi A.\n\nGarbani M.\n\nWälti M.A.\n\nWohlschlager T.\n\nPotthoff E.\n\nSabotiĉ J.\n\nPohleven J.\n\nLüthy P.\n\nHengartner M.O.\n\net al.\n\nA lectin-mediated resistance of higher fungi against predators and parasites.\n\n], trigger dTomato production in C. cinerea AmBm cgl2p-dTom (Figure S1C). Induction of dTomato was also not detected when, instead of A. avenae, bacteria (B. subtilis 168 and E. coli Nissle 1917) were applied to the confrontation area (Figure S1C).\n\nhttps://www.cell.com/cms/asset/6d61d30b-7ac0-4647-abf7-d7cfb453d839/mmc2.mp4\n\nLoading ...\n\nThe production of nematotoxic lectins, as observed by the production of dTomato, was detectable as early as approximately 6 hr and became significant 18 hr after the addition of A. avenae to the confrontation area (Figures 1D and 1E). Thus, the expression of defense effector genes was detected significantly earlier using the microfluidic FNI device than described previously (48–72 hr after nematode inoculation) [\n\n34\n\nPlaza D.F.\n\nSchmieder S.S.\n\nLipzen A.\n\nLindquist E.\n\nKünzler M.\n\nIdentification of a novel nematotoxic protein by challenging the model mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea with a fungivorous nematode.\n\n]. qRT-PCR analysis of C. cinerea AmBm cgl2p-dTom hyphae collected from the confrontation area 6 hr and 48 hr after nematode application confirmed the differential expression of cgl2 and cctx2 (Figure 1E).\n\nPropagation of Defense Response in Trunk Hyphae\n\nThe above analysis of C. cinerea AmBm cgl2p-dTom challenged with A. avenae showed that the induction of the C. cinerea anti-nematode defense response was primarily localized within the confrontation area and did not propagate systemically throughout the entire mycelium (e.g., into the control area harboring hyphae of the same colony; Figure 1C). However, detailed analysis of the acropetal and basipetal monitoring areas, where hyphae do not come into direct contact with A. avenae, revealed a systemic propagation of the induction in a distinct subset of hyphae. This systemic induction within individual hyphae was observed acropetally, as well as basipetally, originating from the confrontation area (Figures 2A and 2B ). dTomato fluorescence within such hyphae was observed to spread over long distances, in some instances over several millimeters (>2.5 mm). Importantly, the acropetal and basipetal transmission was not dependent on the promoter (cgl2p, cctx2p; data not shown) or the fluorescent protein used (dTomato, eGFP) (Figure S1D). The speed of propagation of the fluorescence signal in both directions was similar and determined to be approximately 5 μm/s. This value exceeds the apical growth rate of C. cinerea AmBm by a factor of about 75× (4.1 μm/min [\n\n39\n\nStanley C.E.\n\nStöckli M.\n\nvan Swaay D.\n\nSabotič J.\n\nKallio P.T.\n\nKünzler M.\n\ndeMello A.J.\n\nAebi M.\n\nProbing bacterial-fungal interactions at the single cell level.\n\n]). The dTomato fluorescence signal rarely spread from an induced hypha into secondary branches, but was found to propagate from one hypha to another via anastomosis bridges (Figures S2A and S2B). Interestingly, we could not detect any further propagation of the induction in the donor hyphae beyond the point of anastomosis.\n\nHyphae capable of long-distance propagation of the defense induction were otherwise not readily distinguishable from the rest of the hyphal population; however, the diameter of these hyphae appeared consistently large. We therefore analyzed the diameters of hyphae in the vegetative mycelium of C. cinerea AmBm. A two-step clustering analysis was performed and the results suggest that hyphae of a C. cinerea AmBm mycelium can be grouped into, on average, 2 or 3 distinct populations of hyphae based on the different hyphal diameters (Figures S2C and S2D). The average diameter of hyphae transmitting the dTomato fluorescence signal showed a mean diameter that clustered into the group of hyphae exhibiting a large diameter, here termed generally as trunk hyphae (Figure S2D) [\n\n13\n\nSimonin A.\n\nPalma-Guerrero J.\n\nFricker M.\n\nGlass N.L.\n\nPhysiological significance of network organization in fungi.\n\n,\n\n40\n\nBistis G.N.\n\nPerkins D.D.\n\nRead N.D.\n\nDifferent cell types in Neurospora crassa.\n\n].\n\nOscillation of Defense Response Propagation\n\nWe followed the dTomato fluorescence in trunk hyphae over time by acquiring a series of time-lapse images. The time-lapse series revealed that the fluorescence signal was propagated in the same hyphae several times within a 48 hr time frame, seemingly switching between an on/off state in a regular fashion (Figure 2A). We analyzed the fluorescence intensity profiles (mean gray values) of a section in several induced hyphae over time, and the analysis showed a periodicity of approximately 4–6 hr for the individual hyphae between induced and non-induced states in both directions (as illustrated in Figures 2B and 2C; Video S2).\n\nhttps://www.cell.com/cms/asset/2cef9c68-0c1c-430c-aae0-bb5752e4262f/mmc3.mp4\n\nLoading ...\n\nThe dTomato reporter protein was expressed as a cytosolic version that did not allow differentiation between diffusion/transport of the dTomato protein from its expression site, and/or the diffusion/transport of the underlying fungal defense inducer from the confrontation area. To determine whether the underlying fungal defense inducer is restricted to the site of nematode assault, we first constructed a C. cinerea AmBm reporter strain where dTomato localized to the nucleus. For this purpose, dTomato was fused to the C. cinerea histone H1 (cgl2p-dTomH1). When using this reporter strain, a fluorescence signal was observed in the nuclei of induced compartments and little to no dTomato was detected in the cytoplasm (Figures 2D and 2E). A detailed analysis of the co-cultivation between A. avenae and C. cinerea AmBm cgl2p-dTomH1 showed that the nuclear dTomato was still induced in distinct hyphae within the acropetal and basipetal monitoring areas, which were not directly in contact with the nematode (Figure 2E). However, unlike in C. cinerea AmBm cgl2p-dTom, which expresses the cytosolic version of dTomato, induced hyphae in C. cinerea AmBm cgl2p-dTomH1 did not show any “on/off” state (Figure 2F). The fluorescence signal in the nuclei in these hyphae remained stable or increased over the measuring period.\n\nSecond, we tested the opening states of the dolipore septa in the acropetally and basipetally induced trunk hyphae. For this purpose, we performed fluorescence bleaching experiments, because closed septa apparently represent a diffusion barrier for cytosolic dTomato in these hyphae (Figure S2A). The results indicate that, at the time of bleaching, not all septa along an induced hypha were open. The “−1 compartment” did not respond to the bleaching, indicating that the septa linking compartments 1 and −1 remained closed (Figures S3A–S3C). Furthermore, we observed that the opening state of a given septum can change over time. The septa connecting compartments 1 and −1 were closed at the time of the first bleaching, but opened 30 min later to allow transport of dTomato. The septa between compartments 3 and 4, on the other hand, closed during the time course (Figures S3D–S3F).\n\nTransport of Nutrients in Trunk Hyphae\n\nIt is known that cord-forming basidiomycetes transport nutrients such as glucose or amino acids in a bidirectional manner and also show an oscillatory behavior [\n\n10\n\nFricker M.D.\n\nTlalka M.\n\nBebber D.\n\nTakagi S.\n\nWatkinson S.C.\n\nDarrah P.R.\n\nFourier-based spatial mapping of oscillatory phenomena in fungi.\n\n,\n\n20\n\nTlalka M.\n\nBebber D.P.\n\nDarrah P.R.\n\nWatkinson S.C.\n\nFricker M.D.\n\nQuantifying dynamic resource allocation illuminates foraging strategy in Phanerochaete velutina.\n\n,\n\n41\n\nLindahl B.\n\nFinlay R.\n\nOlsson S.\n\nSimultaneous, bidirectional translocation of 32P and 33P between wood blocks connected by mycelial cords of Hypholoma fasciculare.\n\n]. Given the observed bidirectional propagation of the fungal defense response against nematodes within a specific subset of hyphae, we tested whether the same hyphae were also used for transport of solutes within the mycelium. For this purpose, we employed the soluble and fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG. Instead of applying A. avenae, 30 μM 2-NBDG was applied to the confrontation area and the fluorescence signal within the acropetal and basipetal monitoring areas was analyzed (Figure 3A). In contrast to the production of dTomato upon nematode challenge, distribution of 2-NBDG in the mycelium was far more complex. Septa of secondary or higher-order branches were permeable to 2-NBDG, leading ultimately to diffusion of 2-NBDG throughout the mycelium (Figure 3B, all hyphae). Furthermore, 2-NBDG diffusion within the chamber itself was observed (Figure 3B, background). Nonetheless, we could clearly detect a fluorescence signal in some distinct hyphae that exhibited a similar periodicity as those that had been induced by nematode challenge (Figure 3B, oscillatory hyphae). These hyphae showed transport of 2-NBDG both acropetally and basipetally, approximately 1 hr after application, whereas the arrival of 2-NBDG by general diffusion into the analyzed acropetal regions of interest (ROIs) was only apparent approximately 7–13 hr after application and did not show a periodicity (Figure 3B, control hypha, all hyphae).\n\nWhen A. avenae and 2-NBDG were added to the confrontation area at the same time, the dTomato and 2-NBDG fluorescence signals propagated along the same trunk hyphae with a synchronous oscillation (Figures S4A–S4G). Given the strikingly similar behavior observed for both molecules, we analyzed the time required for one periodic event (Figures 2C and 3C) and found no statistical difference between dTomato and 2-NBDG or between acropetal and basipetal propagation (Figure S4H). To confirm a shared underlying distribution mechanism, we determined the theoretical concentration profile over time for dTomato (based on a 25-kDa model protein) and 2-NBDG (based on diffusion kinetics of a typical ion) assuming distribution by simple diffusion only, according to [\n\n24\n\nFricker M.D.\n\nHeaton L.L.M.\n\nJones N.S.\n\nBoddy L.\n\nThe mycelium as a network.\n\n, ] (Figures S5A and S5F).\n\nThe theoretical diffusion profile for dTomato is not in agreement with the fluorescence profile we obtained within propagating hyphae, suggesting that simple diffusion over large distances (>1,000 μm) alone cannot account for the fast dTomato propagation kinetics observed (Figures S5B–S5E). Furthermore, the profile for 2-NBDG, although similar to the dTomato signal, also cannot be explained by a diffusion model, thus jointly suggesting a similar mechanism, different from diffusion, is underlying the transport of these two molecules.\n\nFinally, we asked whether an individual trunk hypha mediates transport both in the acropetal and basipetal directions to potentially explain the on/off state. We therefore introduced A. avenae into the confrontation area and 2-NBDG into the medium inlet (see Figures S1A and S1B for the microfluidic device scheme). The results revealed that the defense response and 2-NBDG were still transported in the same hyphae, but that their transport was mutually exclusive and the oscillation of their transport was shifted by about half a period (2–3 hr) (Figures 4 and S4I)."
