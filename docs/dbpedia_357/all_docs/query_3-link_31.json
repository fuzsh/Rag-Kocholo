Dithiodiketopiperazines are complex polycyclic natural products possessing a variety of interesting biological activities. Despite their interest, relatively few total syntheses have been completed. We here-in report the enantioselective, scalable and diver-gent total synthesis of two symmetrical pentacyclic dithiodiketopiperazines, (-)-epicoccin G and (-)-rostratin A. A common intermediate was synthesized on multigram scale from inexpensive, commercially available starting materials using an enantioselective organocatalytic epoxidation and a double C(sp3)-H activation as key steps, with the latter allowing the efficient simultaneous construction of the two five-membered rings. In addition to the cis,cis-fused target (-)-epiccocin G, the more challenging (-)-rostratin A possessing two trans ring junctions was obtained for the first time on a 500 mg scale through the optimization of each step and valida-tion on multigram quantities. Both natural products were synthesized with high overall yields (13-20%). This study should facilitate the access to this fasci-nating and yet understudied family of biologically active natural products.",
