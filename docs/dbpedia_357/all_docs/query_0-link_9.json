        "text": "Results and Discussion\n\nThe ETP tag 7 was synthesized, as in biosynthesis, using exclusively C2 building blocks derived from acetate, i.e., 8–12 (Scheme 1). At the beginning, chloroacetate 8 was reacted with ethylamine 9. The resulting secondary amine 13 was coupled with Boc-protected glycine 10. Liberation of the amine in the obtained dipeptide 14 prepared for the cyclization of 15. The resulting diketopiperazine heterocycle 16 was alkylated with bromoacetate 11. With dilactam 17, a key intermediate was reached. The sulfur atoms were introduced via radical bromination followed by substitution with thioacetate 12.24 The cis isomer 18 was obtained as the major product (4.5:1), easily separated from the trans isomer, and assigned by a strong NOE between the two remaining endocyclic hydrogens. Hydrolysis of the thioesters 18 with ammonia afforded the free thiols, which were immediately oxidized with molecular iodine to afford the high-tension ETP disulfide 19 in excellent 63% yield as a pale yellow solid. The bicyclic ETP scaffold remained intact during the acid-catalyzed removal of the tBu protecting group in 19, the activation of the resulting acid 20 with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), and reaction of the resulting ETP tag 7 with amines of free choice, here a fluorescent model substrate, under mildest conditions, to give the CF–ETP conjugate 6 in 68% yield.\n\nIn D2O at pD 8.0, equimolar DTT reduced 5 mM ETP 20 instantaneously and completely to dithiol 21 (Table 1, entry a, Figure S10). This was also true at pD 5.5 and with 2 equiv of glutathione (GSH) at pD 8.0 (Table 1, entries b and c, Figures S9 and S14). At pD 5.5 with GSH, the consumption of the hyperstrained disulfide 20 reached 50% within the time needed to set up and record an 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1, entry d, Figure S13). In sharp contrast, AspA 23 reacted slowly with DTT and failed to react with GSH under these conditions (Table 1, entries a–d, Figures S11, S12, S15, and S16).\n\nTo explore the formation of strained disulfides by disulfide exchange, dithiols 21 and 24 were prepared in situ by 1 equiv of TCEP. Subsequent addition of 1 equiv of DTNB 25 in neutral water gave rise to the strained ETP 20 and AspA 23 instantaneously (Table 1, entry e, Figures S17 and S18). With 2 equivalents of oxidized glutathione GSSG, a much less reactive disulfide, the reduced ETP 21 exchanged rapidly into the tension-free mixed disulfide 22 (Table 1, entry f, Figure S19), and, with time, ring closure into hyperstrained ETP 20 could be observed (Table 1 entry g, Figure S20). The high reactivity of reduced ETP 21 could be ascribed to the lower than usual pKa of thiols due to the presence of lactam nitrogen and carbonyl groups on the α position. Besides high tension, this increased acidity also explained the ease of ring-opening disulfide exchange (20 → 21/22) and the reluctance of ring closure (22 → 20). In comparison, the thiols of the reduced AspA control 24 were much less reactive toward nonactivated disulfides (Table 1, entry f, Figure S21), whereas formation of the less strained dithiolane ring was faster (Table 1, entry g, Figure S22). Control experiments without GSSG resulted in very little auto-oxidative ring closure to 20 or 23, thus demonstrating that the rings form through the mixed disulfides, such as 22, by disulfide exchange reactions. In summary, compared to AspAs, ETPs are (1) more reactive in ring-opening disulfide exchange with nonactivated thiols, also under acidic conditions, (2) more reactive in their reduced form with nonactivated disulfides, and (3) less efficient in ring-closing disulfide exchange to go full cycle and reproduce the hyperstrained ETPs in neutral water (Table 1).\n\nThe uptake of the green-fluorescent CF-ETP conjugate 6 into HeLa Kyoto cells was monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Incubation with 10 μM 6 in Leibovitz medium for 1 h at 37 °C resulted in intense homogeneous emission from the cytosol and particularly from the nuclei, including nuclei that were poorly stained by Hoechst 33342 ( C). This result contrasted sharply from the uptake of the AspA control 5, which failed to reach the nucleus and produced mostly punctate emission at much lower intensity ( B). The same distinct differences between ETP 6 and AspA 5 were observed in several other cell lines ( A,B).\n\nThe punctate emission obtained with AspA 5 can be assigned with confidence to receptor-mediated delivery into endosomes.14 The absence of punctate emission suggested that contrary to AspA 5, ETP 6 does not suffer from endosomal capture and is delivered exclusively to the cytosol and nucleus. Different from the polycationic CPDs,11 accumulation of the overall anionic ETPs in the nuclei is not driven by ion pairing and thus not limited to the DNA-rich nucleoli. Possibly, the presence of target proteins with reactive thiols, such as histone methyl transferase,7,8 dictates the intracellular distribution of ETPs. ETPs continued to deliver efficiently at concentrations as low as 500 nM, whereas detectable uptake of AspAs stopped below 5 μM ( C,D). Still higher intensities obtained with ETPs at 500 nM than with AspAs at 10 μM suggested that ETPs are at least 20 times more active ( C,D).\n\nAs many natural ETPs are toxins, the MTT assay was employed to assess the toxicity of ETP tags in HeLa Kyoto cells. This assay reports on the enzymatic conversion of the tetrazolium dye MTT into formazan, that is, the metabolic activity of the cells.25 The positive control, polyarginine (pR), was confirmed to be cytotoxic at 10 μM ( A).11 Under the same conditions, ETP 6 and AspA 5 were not toxic ( A).\n\nFlow cytometry analysis confirmed the impression from CLSM images that the hyperstrained ETP 6 is much more active than the AspA control 5 ( B). The loss of essentially all activity at 4 °C is commonly interpreted as indication of uptake by endocytosis ( B). However, other possible explanations such as changes in disulfide exchange kinetics, membrane fluidity, etc., should not be forgotten, particularly since all common endocytosis inhibitors were inactive. Namely, insensitivity toward chlorpromazine (CPZ) excluded clathrin-mediated endocytosis, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD) caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and wortmannin and cytochalasin B (cytoB) ruled out macropinocytosis ( B).11,22,26−28"
