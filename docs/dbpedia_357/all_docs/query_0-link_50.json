        "text": "PRIORITY\n\nThis application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/909,184 filed Feb. 1, 2016, which is now U.S. Pat. No. 9,944,925, which is the US national stage of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2014/049649, filed Aug. 4, 2014, which claims benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/861,805 filed Aug. 2, 2013, 61/883,131 filed Sep. 26, 2013, 61/935,265 filed Feb. 3, 2014, and 61/938,933 filed Feb. 12, 2014, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe invention relates to, inter alia, methods and compositions for genome-scale editing of genetic information.\n\nREFERENCE TO THE SEQUENCE LISTING\n\nReference is made to the sequence listing submitted via EFS-Web, which consists of a file named, âENV-002C1v2_SL_ST25â (16.0 KB), created on Sep. 28, 2018, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nSuccessful genomic and pathway engineering requires that metabolic flux be increased through select pathways, while not substantially interfering with viability and/or growth of the organism, or a desired phenotype. This can be especially pertinent for substrates or intermediates of the desired pathway that are involved in core or primary metabolism, or for branch intermediates involved in more than one pathway. Stephanopoulos, Metabolic Fluxes and Metabolic Engineering, Metabolic Engineering 1, 1-11 (1999). In fact, genetic alterations, or combinations of genetic alterations, that increase metabolic flux through a desired pathway are difficult to predict, limiting the usefulness of rational engineering approaches. Kern A, et al., Engineering primary metabolic pathways of industrial microorganisms, J. Biotechnology 129: 6-29 (2007). Further, it is often impractical to generate random and discrete mutational events in vivo and screen or select for improved metabolic flux or biomolecular function.\n\nMethods are needed for screening the genetic space of a host organism to identify changes in endogenous genes and/or heterologous recombinant genes that provide improved phenotypes, such as in metabolic flux and balance, so as to improve or optimize microbial processes, including production of desired chemicals and biomolecules at industrial levels, or bioremediation applications.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIn various aspects, the invention provides methods for genomic and pathway engineering. The methods are useful in E. coli, as well as bacterial cells that are harder to genetically manipulate but are otherwise valuable for production of chemicals, inducing Bacillus sp. (e.g., Bacillus subtilis), Streptomycetes (e.g., Streptomyces avermitiils, Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces lividins, Streptomyces cinnamonensis, Streptomyces collinus, etc.), Cyanobacteria (e.g., Synechocystis spp., Prochlorocoocus spp., Nostoc punctiforme, Calothrix spp., Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Arthrospira platensis, etc.), and Corynebacteria (e.g., Corynebacteria glutamicum, Corynebacteria ammoniagenes, etc.), among others. The methods are further applicable in some embodiments to Eukaryotic cells, such as yeasts (e.g., Pichia sp., Saccharomyces sp., Schizosaccharomyces sp., Kluyveromyces sp, etc.), filamentous fungi (e.g., Neurospora sp, and Aspergillus sp., Penicillium, etc.), algae (e.g., Botryococcus, Chlorolla, Dunaliella, Gracilaria, Pleurochrysis, and Sargassum, etc.), and plants.\n\nIn various aspects, the invention is applicable to phenotype engineering, including but not limited to: change in carbon substrate utilization, increased cell growth rate, increased production of a desired chemical, redox cofactor balance, reduced production of one or more undesired byproducts, increased resistance to industrial fermentation, and increased recombinant protein production, among others. In some embodiments, the phenotype relates to pathway engineering, such as where metabolic flux through a core or primary metabolic pathway is significantly altered (e.g., significantly altered as compared to wild type strain, an unengineered strain, or a starting strain), including alteration of metabolic flux through one or more intermediates that represent metabolic branch points. In various embodiments, the invention is applicable to introducing and balancing of heterologous recombinant enzyme activity with endogenous metabolism, to limit effects on viability and growth, for example. In some embodiments, the phenotype relates to engineering alterations among one or more proteins, such as, by way of illustration, enzymes, for improved biochemical or biophysical properties.\n\nIn various aspects, the invention provides methods for pathway engineering, in which metabolic flux is altered through one or more intermediates of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway. TCA cycle, one or more secondary biosynthesis pathways (e.g., amino acid or nucleotide biosynthesis pathway), the mevalonate or non-mevalonate pathway, pathways involved in sulfur or nitrogen metabolism, and others. The invention relates to, in various embodiments, engineering cells to result in one or more of increased or diversified carbon substrate utilization, increased or maintained growth rate, modified enzyme activity at metabolic branch points, decreased metabolic flux through one or more competing secondary pathways and/or increase in flux through a desired secondary biosynthetic pathway, balanced cellular redox chemistry (e.g., redox cofactor balance), balanced heterologous enzyme activity with the endogenous metabolism, including reduction in toxic intermediates, increased resistance to environmental (e.g., industrial) conditions, increased recombinant protein production, and increased yield of desired product.\n\nIn various aspects, the invention engineers cells using one or a combination of recombineering systems. The recombineering systems each offer distinct advantages in engineering cells. In some embodiments, the method produces a library of mutants cells using a ssDNA recombinase system, which may include a single-stranded annealing protein (SSAP), such as the Î» Red recombineering system (e.g., Beta protein) or RecET system (e.g., recT), or homologous system, which in some embodiments offers advantages in identifying pathways, genes, or regions of genes for alteration, as well as targeting specific regions for genetic diversification. The Î» Red operon encodes ssDNA annealing protein Beta, which promotes annealing of single stranded oligonucleotides at the lagging strand of the replication fork. The Î» Red recombineering system, as with other SSAP systems, may further involve a deletion, inactivation, or reduction in mismatch repair (e.g., deletion, inactivation, or reduction in activity or level of mutS). Such a system is useful for engineering E. coli and other prokaryotic systems, and may be engineered into other species described herein. Specifically, an oligonucleotide library designed to screen for beneficial mutations (or combinations of mutations) in a target genetic âspaceâ is introduced into the organism, and a desired phenotype identified. The genetic âspaceâ includes identified target pathways (e.g., a primary metabolic pathway and/or one or more secondary competing or biosynthetic pathways), target genes, and the nature and diversity of alterations to screen, including changes to gene regulatory sequences such as promoters and transcriptional enhancer sequences, ribosomal binding sites and other sites relating to the efficiency of transcription, translation, or RNA processing, as well as coding sequence mutations that control the activity, post-translational modification, or turnover of the encoded proteins. Oligonucleotide library design strategies to leverage the power of this method are described in detail herein. In some embodiments, these aspects employ a single stranded DNA annealing protein system with mismatch repair inactivation to identify target genes to be engineered, that is genes that are optimally up- or downregulated in activity or expression. Subsequently target genes or sequences are honed with a more targeted or defined oligonucleotide library, or by a complementary approach to introduce replacement sequences by, for example, producing double-strand breaks in some cases with homologous recombination. Such alternative systems include CRISPR/Cas, ZFNs, BurrH binding domain or BuD, derived nucleases, TALEs, and TALENs, among others, to introduce double-strand breaks at desired location in the host genome to enhance allelic replacement. In this manner, the invention uses both rational and random design aspects to engineer cells toward desired phenotypes.\n\nIn some embodiments, the genetic or genomic engineering systems (e.g., recombineering or site-specific programmable nucleases such as Cas, TALENs, ZFNs, or BuDs) are inducible or controlled, such that the engineered strain remains genetically stable.\n\nOther aspects of the invention provides cells that are efficient for recombineering, by targeting the endogenous components of the cell, or providing heterologous components described herein, and screening for increased recombineering efficiency.\n\nIn other aspects, the invention is applicable to prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms that are more difficult to genetically manipulate than E. coli. For example, the invention allows for target genes or genomic sequence variants to be introduced into a recombineering- (e.g., MAGE-) competent organism where engineering can be performed, e.g. E. coli, using a vector that is compatible for replication in the recombineering or MAGE-competent organism (such as E. coli) and replication in the desired host, or replication in the recombineering or MAGE-competent organism and conjugation into the desired host; and after undergoing one or more cycles of engineering in the recombineering or MAGE-competent organism, the engineered vectors are introduced into the host cell of choice. In various aspects, the vector confers one or more selectable markers for both the recombineering or MAGE-competent organism and the target organism, such that following transformation (or transfection, conjugation, etc.), successful transformants can be selected from unsuccessful transformants.\n\nIn some aspects and embodiments of the invention employ a vector that encodes a component of a site-specific programmable nuclease system (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN, ZFN, BuD, or homologous or analogous system), which is coupled, e.g. in the same vector (e.g., a plasmid), to a donor sequence for a locus targeted by the programmable nuclease. The donor nucleic acids are not susceptible to cutting by the programmable nuclease, described herein, that is introduced into the system. Coupling the site-specific programmable nuclease system to the donor sequence on the same DNA results in a scarless method for selecting recombinants and obviates the need for an additional selectable marker. Thus, recombination with the homologous target region mutated at the wild-type locus targeted by the site-specific nuclease permits the cell to escape restriction by the programmed nuclease system. In other words, recombination with the mutated sequence frees the organism from the genomic instability caused by the programmable site-specific nuclease.\n\nIn still other aspects, the invention provides methods for engineering the programmable nuclease system itself by using the recombineering system to replace or alter the subsequence of the vector that specifically targets the host genomic locus (or loci) such that a new genomic locus (or loci) will be targeted by the programmable nuclease (e.g., CRISPR/Cas, ZFNs, BurrH binding domain or BuD, derived nucleases, TALEs, and TALENs).\n\nIn various embodiments, the invention provides engineered cells made through the processes described herein, and provides methods of producing desired chemical products through fermentation of the engineered cells. For example, the methods and cells may, in various embodiments, produce a biofuel such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, or isobutanol, or a compound having a C2 to C6 carbon skeleton (for example) ethylene, acetate, methacrylic acid, acrylate, lactic acid, isoprene, propanoic acid, hydroxypropanoic acid, propylene, propane, propene, butadiene, butanediol, butanone, butyric acid, butyrolactone, butanal, putrescine, fumarate, malate, levulinic acid, pentanoic acid, caproic acid, cyclohexanone, or adipate, among others. In some embodiments, fatty acid derivatives, which may serve as valuable long-chain carbon molecules (e.g., alkanes, alkenes) of high energetic value may be produced. In some embodiments, the compound is a product of secondary metabolism or biosynthetic pathway, and may be a fatty acid, a natural or unnatural amino acid, lipid, lipopeptide, antibiotic, nucleotide, pharmaceutical or intermediate thereof, a polynucleotide (e.g. RNA), or a terpene or terpenoid. In some embodiments, the compound is a recombinant protein such as an antibody or insulin.\n\nAdditional aspects and embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\nFIG. 1 shows shuttle-MAGE plasmid design. The Shuttle-MAGE plasmid contains origins of replication and selectable marker(s) for the target organism (2u and URA3 in orange), a DNA fragment homologous to the region in the target organism targeted for MAGE mutagenesis (green), and a CRISPR guide RNA expression cassette designed to guide the Cas9 endonuclease to digest the target genome at a specified site (red). The vector backbone (blue) allows the plasmid to be maintained in MAGE-competent E. coli cells under a selectable marker.\n\nFIG. 2 shows modifying the shuttle-MAGE plasmid via MAGE. The repair sequences in the Shuttle-MAGE plasmid were targeted for modification by applying cycles of MAGE with oligos designed to introduce premature stop codons or new fluorescent properties to the target sequences. Panel A shows the ADE2 gene was targeted to be cleaved by Cas9 at the designated PAM recognition sequence. Two distinct MAGE oligos introduced premature stop codons in the encoding gene to render cells that utilize the given repair sequence to escape Cas9 cleavage unable to express a functional ADE2 allele. Panel B shows the fluorescent properties of the Venus-YFP gene introduced into the yeast genome were altered by the introduction of mutations in the sequence via MAGE. Oligos were designed to change the Venus-YFP sequence to that of either the Emerald (Yellow to Green) or Cerulean (Yellow to Blue) fluorescent proteins, or to contain a premature stop codon. The CRISPR gRNA target recognition sequence along the YFP target is shown in blue. Panel C shows after cycles of MAGE individual plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the desired mutations were incorporated.\n\nFIG. 3 shows imaging of yeast colonies to identify targeted changes. In order to confirm that the desired engineered mutations have been introduced into the target genomes, colonies of yeast strains were imaged after having undergone Shuttle-MAGE manipulation. Panel A shows the ADE2 Shuttle-MAGE plasmid was transformed into Cas9-expressing BY4741 and BY4733 cells. The resulting cultures were plated onto agar plates and photographed under different bright-field and fluorescent channels. The colonies that appear red have incorporated one of the premature stop codon mutations introduced by MAGE on the repair sequence in the Shuttle-MAGE plasmid. All colonies continue to express the Venus YFP protein. Panel B shows the YFP Shuttle-MAGE plasmid was transformed into Cas9-expressing cells. Under the fluorescent channels, most colonies appear to no longer be expressing the Venus YFP fluorescent protein, but rather an alternate fluorescent protein, pertaining either to Emerald (GFP) or Cerulean (CFP) fluorescent protein. The fluorescent spectra for the encoded YFP and GFP proteins largely overlap, so they appear very similar under the chosen imaging conditions.\n\nFIG. 4 shows changing CRISPR gRNAs on the shuttle-MAGE plasmid. In order to alter the Cas9 cleavage site along the genome (left), a MAGE oligo was designed to change the gRNA sequence in the Shuttle-MAGE plasmid (right). Cycles of MAGE were applied using Oligo 13, which contained homologous sequences to the regions up and downstream of the gRNA recognition sequence on the plasmid. The resulting library of plasmids is therefore capable of digesting and modifying the target genome at multiple sites.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\nIn various aspects, the invention provides methods for engineering a cell for a desired phenotype. In some embodiments, the method comprises introducing an oligonucleotide library into a population of cells, where the cells express a single-stranded annealing protein (SSAP) system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide library targets sequences that control gene expression in the cell (e.g., 5â² and/or 3â² untranslated sequences), and/or may target protein coding sequences (e.g., including start and stop codons). Cells having the desired phenotype may then be screened or selected, and genes with altered expression as a result of oligonucleotide incorporation can be identified for further engineering. Further engineering in various embodiments can be conducted by a second oligonucleotide library designed for diversification of the identified genes, and/or by targeting at least one gene with a gene editing system, such as a programmable nuclease as described herein. With each iterative round (or intermittently in a substantially continuous process), cells are selected having an improvement in the desired phenotype.\n\nWhile the invention provides for selecting for any desired phenotype, the desired phenotype can be one or more of a change in carbon substrate utilization, increased cell growth rate, increased production of a desired chemical, redox cofactor balance, reduced production of one or more undesired byproducts, increased resistance to industrial fermentation, and increased recombinant protein production, among others.\n\nThe various steps for diversifying the genetics of the host cell population can target endogenous genes and/or heterologously expressed genes, including enzymes expressed as part of a biosynthetic pathway or recombinant proteins for production.\n\nAs cells with the desired phenotype are selected, genes altered by the first or subsequent oligonucleotide libraries can be identified by transcriptional (e.g., microarray) or translational analysis or by DNA sequencing and compared to a reference genomic sequence (e.g., the starting sequence).\n\nIn some embodiments, the desired phenotype is increased production of a desired chemical, and which may be the result of a primary metabolic pathway and a downstream biosynthetic pathway (which may further comprise at least one heterologously expressed gene in some embodiments). In some embodiments, the cell expresses a heterologous biosynthetic pathway that alters flux through one or more of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, MVA or MEP pathway.\n\nIn various aspects, the invention provides methods for genomic and pathway engineering. The invention is applicable to pathway engineering where metabolic flux through a core or primary metabolic pathway is altered (e.g., significantly altered as compared to wild type, unengineered, or starting strain), including where flux at a metabolic branch point is altered. In these or other embodiments, the invention is applicable to balance one or more secondary pathways, that is, to reduce flux from competing secondary pathways while enhancing flux to a desired biosynthetic pathway. In various embodiments, the invention is applicable to introducing and balancing of heterologous recombinant enzyme activity with endogenous metabolism, to limit effects on viability and cell growth (for example). In various aspects, the invention provides methods for pathway engineering, in which metabolic flux is significantly altered through one or more intermediates of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, one or more biosynthesis pathways (e.g., for production of natural or unnatural amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, fatty acids, antibiotics, among others), the MEP or MVA pathway, pathways involved in sulfur or nitrogen metabolism, and others. Thus, the invention relates to, in various embodiments, engineering cells to increase one or more of carbon substrate utilization, increase or maintain cell growth rate, modify enzyme activity at metabolic branch points, decrease metabolic flux through one or more competing secondary pathways, balance cellular redox chemistry (e.g., redox cofactor balance), balance heterologous enzyme activity with the endogenous metabolism, including reduction in toxic intermediates, increase resistance to environmental (e.g., industrial) conditions, and increase recombinant protein production.\n\nIn some embodiments, the invention engineers cells through a SSAP system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides, such as the Beta protein of the Î» Red recombineering system or the RecT protein of the homologous RecET system, or a homologous system. In such embodiments, the host cell expresses the ssDNA annealing protein Beta, or derivative or homolog thereof. These proteins promote annealing of single stranded oligonucleotides at the lagging strand of the replication fork. These embodiments may further involve a deletion, inactivation, or reduction in a mismatch repair protein. For example, these embodiments can employ a deletion, inactivation, or reduction in activity or level of mutS, or homolog thereof in the host organism of choice (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,144,734, 7,521,242, and 7,674,621 and US Patent Publication No. 2005/0079618, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). This system is useful for engineering E. coli and similar bacterial systems. Specifically, an oligonucleotide library designed to screen for beneficial mutations (or combinations of mutations) in a target genetic âspaceâ is introduced into the organism by transformation (e.g., by electroporation (e.g. Lithium Acetate or PolyEthyleneGlycol), chemical transformation, ballistic transformation (e.g. gene gun), pressure induced transformation, mechanical shear forces induced, for example, in microfluids, and carbon nanotubes, nanotube puncture (such as carbon nanotube arrays), induced natural competence mechanisms of an organism, merging of protoplasts, and conjugation with Agrobacterium) of a cell population, and a desired phenotype is identified.\n\nThe genetic âspaceâ includes selected target pathways, target genes, and the nature and diversity of alterations to screen, including changes to gene regulatory sequences such as promoters and transcriptional enhancer sequences, ribosomal binding sites and other sites relating to the efficiency of transcription, translation, or RNA processing, as well as coding sequence mutations that control the activity, post-translational modification, or turnover of the encoded protein. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide library targets start and/or stop codons, and splice sites. Alternative genomic engineering platforms that may be used, alternatively or in combination with the Î» Red or homologous or analogous system as described herein, include CRISPR/Cas9, ZFNs, BurrH binding domain or BuD, derived nucleases, TALEs, and TALENs.\n\nThus, in some embodiments, the host cell is an E. coli possessing the Î» Red recombineering system or the RecET system (e.g., the Beta gene or recT gene) and lacking the mismatch repair gene mutS. The Î» Red System has been referred to as Multiplexed Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) and is a process by which the genome of a cell is reprogrammed to perform desired functions via a form of accelerated, directed evolution (Wang et al., Nature, 460:894-898 (2009); Church et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,153,432, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). During MAGE cycling, Beta proteins recombine oligos designed to target key genomic regions for highly specific mutations. The deletion of mutS may further improve recombination efficiency by avoiding the mismatch repair machinery.\n\nAt each round of transformation, without wishing to be bound by theory, protein Beta binds to, protects, and promotes strand annealing of the ssDNA oligomers. This may occur in the lagging strand during DNA replication where the oligomers are thus incorporated into the duplicated genome. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the deletion of the mismatch repair gene mutS in the recombineering strain prevents the reversion of some of the non-homologous genetic changes introduced by the ssDNA oligonucleotide pool. Thus after each cycle of transformation, genetic diversity is greatly increased in focused regions of the genome according to the targeted design of the oligonucleotide pool. After some number of cycles of transformation (determined by the size of the oligomer pool, for example), selection or screening is performed for the desired genomic characteristic and the process is repeated. In some embodiments, the process is conducted in a continuous fashion.\n\nIn some embodiments, the host cell or strain has one or more genetic modifications to protect oligos following entry into the cell. Knocking out four potent ssDNA exonucleases in E. coli improves oligomediated allelic recombination frequency when low concentrations of oligos are used (Mosberg, J. A., et al., PloS One, 7(9), e44638). ExoVII is a nuclease that degrades the ends of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cassettes. Removing this nuclease improves both recombination frequency and the inheritance of mutations at 3â² ends of ssDNA and dsDNA. Removing ExoVII and the set of four exonucleases (RecJ, ExoI, ExoX, and Lambda Exo) may improve recombineering performance. Thus, the host strain may have a deletion or inactivation in ExoVII, and one or more (or all) of RecJ, ExoI, ExoX, and Lambda Exo.\n\nIn some embodiments, co-selection will be applied to increase the rate at which surviving cells will contain the desired mutations. This may be executed by including oligos that introduce or revert mutations in a counter-selectable marker positioned in the genome or on a plasmid along with the oligos targeting other genomic location(s). This may include but is not limited to TolC, as described in (Gregg C J, et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 42(7):4779-90 (2014), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference).\n\nIn some embodiments, the SSAP system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides is first used to identify primary and secondary pathway targets. For example, transcriptional and/or translational sequences can be broadly disrupted and/or enhanced by oligonucleotide design, and the transcriptional and/or translational state of cells showing improvement in the desired phenotype (e.g., chemical production) evaluated to identify genes that are frequently upregulated versus genes that are frequently downregulated or shut off completely, or identify frequent or optimal combinations of the above. Transcriptional effects can be induced with the oligonucleotide library by exchanging or interfering with gene promoters or transcriptional binding sites. Translational effects can be induced by the oligonucleotides by enhancing or interfering with ribosomal binding sites, such as the Shine-Dalgamo sequence, or the Kozak sequence, or DNA sequences 5â² or 3â² of the ORF that affect RNA degradation rate, as well as start and stop codons. These identified genes, optionally including genes catalyzing adjacent or competing reactions, can be identified by screening or a selection system with a second round to identify more finely tuned expression modulation or amino acid substitution events that increase product yield.\n\nAlternatively or in addition, subsequent rounds employ CRISPR/Cas9, TALENS. ZFNs, BurrH binding domain or BuD, derived nucleases, or homologous or analagous systems for refining selected strains. Such systems can be used to induce double-strand breaks (DSB) and increase homologous recombination efficiency.\n\nFor example, a double-strand break (DSB) or single-strand break or nick can be created by a site-specific nuclease such as a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) or TAL effector domain nuclease (TALEN) or BurrH binding domain (BuD)-derived nucleases, or using the CRISPR/Cas9 system with an engineered crRNA/tracrRNA (or synthetic guide RNA) to guide specific cleavage. See United States Patent Publications 2003/0232410; 2005/0208489; 200510026157; 2005/0064474; 2006/0188987; 2009/0263900; 2009/0117617; 2010/0047805; 2011/0207221; 2011/0301073 and International Publication WO 2007/014275, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes. Transgene insertion can be accomplished via homology-directed repair (HDR) processes, which require the inserted transgene to include regions of homology to the site of insertion (cleavage). Alternatively, targeted integration can occur by homology-independent non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair machinery. Thus, in these embodiments, the recombineering strain expresses an endogenous or heterologous ZFN, BuD, TALEN, or CRISPR/Cas9. Donor nucleic acid libraries can be designed for this system as described in detail herein.\n\nFor example, in certain embodiments, the process employs a double-strand break system as described in US 2013/0326645, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In this system, the donor molecules may be integrated into the endogenous locus via homology-independent mechanisms (e.g., NHEJ), and may employ a double-stranded donor comprising a transgene or synthetic DNA of at least 1 kb in length and nuclease target site(s) 3â² and/or 5â² of the transgene for in vivo cleavage. The nuclease target site(s) used to cleave the donor are not re-created upon integration of the transgene, for example when a spacer between paired target sites is not present in and/or does not exhibit homology to an endogenous locus. The donor molecule may be, for example, a plasmid or a DNA sequence incorporated within a plasmid. In certain embodiments, the donor DNA is integrated following nuclease-mediated cleavage of the endogenous locus. Such processes can employ donor sequences of up to about 20 kb, and in various embodiments employ donor sequences of from about 50 bases to about 10,000 bases, or from about 100 bases to about 5,000 bases, or about 200 bases to about 2,000 bases, or about 200 bases to about 1000 bases.\n\nDouble-strand breaks (DSB) or single-strand breaks (nicks) in the genome of the target cell may be created by any mechanism. In certain embodiments, the DSB or nick is created by one or more (e.g., a dimerizing pair of) zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), fusion proteins comprising a zinc finger binding domain, which is engineered to bind a sequence within the region of interest, and a cleavage domain or a cleavage half-domain. In other embodiments, the DSB or nick is created by one or more TALE DNA-binding domains (naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring) fused to a nuclease domain (TALENs). In other embodiments, the DSB or nick is created by one or more BurrH binding domains or BuD-derived nucleases, which is engineered to cleave a sequence within the region of interest. In still further embodiments, cleavage or nicking is performed using a nuclease system such as CRISPR/Cas with an engineered crRNA/tracr RNA or crRNA/tracr RNA combined into a single synthetic guide RNA targeting the desired genomic or extra-chromosomal sequence.\n\nThe genetic components of CRISPR/Cas9, as well as the structural requirements for the crRNA/tracrRNA or synthetic guide RNA are described in, for example, PCT/US2013/032589, publication number: WO2013176772 (describing, inter alia, the use of CRISPR/Cas9 with a single combined crRNA/tracrRNA system, known as a guide RNA); Jinek, et al.

Increased recombineering potential may be determined, for example, by introducing an oligonucleotide directing entry of a premature stop codon in a marker gene.\n\nRecombineering strains may be created through initial genetic modifications to protect and promote ssDNA annealing or homologous recombination efficiency and avoid the mismatch repair system. The suitability of any particular host cell or strain for recombineering can be assessed using a reporter or selection system. For example, candidate host cells or strains are subjected to cycles of genomic engineering using an oligo-pool or pool of mutants for recombination designed to introduce mutations into endogenous or heterologous genes that control these processes. Exemplary target genes are described below for bacterial and yeast systems for example, and other prokaryotic and eukaryotic counterparts are known. The number of initial cycles can be determined according to the efficiency of the parent strain and the number of allelic targets. To assess recombining efficiency, one cycle is performed with a single oligo designed to replace a premature stop codon in a gene for one or more selection marker(s) in the host genome or on a plasmid (e.g., a fluorescent or luminescent reporter protein, or other gene creating an easily observable or quantifiable phenotype); and after selection for strains capable of successfully introducing the stop codon, quantifying specificity and efficiency of the replacement. Promising strains, e.g. those demonstrating more efficient allelic replacement than strains from the previous cycle, are then recursively applied to the process. Cycling with oligos targeting genes that effect ssDNA recombination and mismatch repair, or homologous recombination, in the organism of choice, generates a diverse population of organisms with a spectrum of recombineering efficiencies. Selection for strains with increasingly efficient allelic replacement machinery for reintroduction to the pipeline may continue until replacement reaches a plateau, where there is no quantitative improvement in efficiency.\n\nIn recombineering strains, recombination may be mediated by phage-derived proteins from the Î» Red system or RecE/RecT from the Rac prophage of E. coli. The Î» Red recombination functions are encoded by an operon containing three genes, gamma, beta, and exo, although only the beta gene is required for oligonucleotide incorporation. The RecET system is a member of the same superfamily, and the Î» Red Exo/Beta and RecE/RecT protein pairs are functionally equivalent. Beta and RecT are SSAPs that bind and protect ssDNA, and Beta is capable of efficient recombination with ssDNA oligos by promoting annealing of complementary ssDNA at the replication fork. ssDNA recombinases other than or related to Beta and RecT, have been described. Sequence analysis of diverse SSAPs and/or recombinases shows at least six families among at least three evolutionarily distinct superfamilies: Rad52-like (of which Î» Red Beta, Sak, and Erf are members), Rad51-like (e.g., Sak4), and Gp2.5-like, each with distinct sequence profiles and folds. Datta et al., PNAS USA, 105:1626-31 (2008); Lopes, A., Nucleic Acids Research, 38(12), 3952-3962. doi:10.1093/nar/gkq096, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Specifically, recombineering strains can be engineered as follows.\n\nIn various embodiments, the host cell or stain encodes and expresses one or more of a SSAP and/or recombinase or variant from the three superfamilies described above. In this context, the term âvariantâ means that the variant comprises an amino acid sequence with at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% identity to at least one of the SSAPs and/or recombinases.\n\nIn some embodiments, yeast strains with higher recombineering efficiency with single stranded oligonucleotides are prepared, using a library of oligonucleotides that alter the expression (transcription and/or translation), and/or coding regions, of one or more (or all) of Rad52, Rad51, Rad59, and Rad54, among others genes. Thus, the library of oligonucleotides target for mutations the 5â² and/or 3â² non-coding sequences, intron sequences (including splice sites), and/or coding sequences of these genes, and the yeast strains selected for recombineering efficiency as described above. In some embodiments, programmable nuclease systems as referenced above are used to target mutations in these genes, for example, as described above by coupling the heterologous system with donor DNA on a single vector.\n\nIn yeast, Rad52 may also function independently of the RecA ortholog, Rad51. In yeast, nearly all homologous recombination pathways begin with resection of dsDNA to generate 3â²-terminated ssDNA, followed by the binding of RPA and Rad52, and its paralog Rad59. RAD52 binds ssDNA during recombination and also shows a quaternary organization similar to those of RecT/RedÎ² and ERF, and may be used in the invention in various embodiments.\n\nThe RPA-Rad52-Rad59-ssDNA complex can participate in either Rad51-ssDNA filament formation and the canonical gene conversion pathway or Rad52-mediated (and Rad51-independent) single-strand annealing. This choice is primarily controlled by Rad51, but is moderated by Rad59 and other cellular proteins. The competition is dynamic and reversible, and the pathway chosen for DSB repair is likely determined by DNA target availability and protein availability. Rad59 enhances DNA annealing by Rad52 and increases the likelihood of entering the SSA pathway. Overexpression of S. cerevisiae wild-type Rad52 increases recombination rates of dsDNA, and it has the opposite effect with single-strand oligo-mediated AR. When Rad5l and Rad54 are overexpressed together, there is a dramatic increase in oligo-mediated AR, which is further elevated in the absence of Rad52. This system may be engineered as described above to improve the host cell's efficiency for recombineering.\n\nIn this manner, aspects of the invention allow for essentially any host cell to have recombineering potential. In various embodiments, the cell is a eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic cell, including bacterial, yeast, agal, plant, insect, and/or non-human mammalian cells, or immortal cell lines. For example, the host cell may be Esherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces castellii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia stipitis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis thaliana, or Caenorhabditis elegans. In some embodiments the cell is a bacterial cell, such as Escherichia spp., Streptomyces spp., Zymonas spp., Acetobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Synechocystis spp., Rhizobium spp., Clostridium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., Xanthomonas spp., Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Alcaligenes spp., Pseudomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., Azotobacter spp., Comamonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., Rhodococcus spp., Gluconobacter spp., Ralstonia spp., Acidithiobacillus spp., Microlunatus spp., Geobacter spp., Geobacillus spp., Arthrobacter spp., Flavobacterium spp., Serratia spp., Saccharopolyspora spp., Thermus spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., Chromobacterium spp., Sinorhizobium spp., Saccharopolyspora spp., Agrobacterium spp. and Pantoea spp. In some embodiments the cell is a Cyanobacterial cell, such as Synechocystis spp., Prochlorococcus spp., Nostoc punctiforme, Calothrix spp., Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Arthrospira platensis, etc. The bacterial cell can be a Gram-negative cell such as an E. coli, or a Gram-positive cell such as a species of Bacillus. In other embodiments, the cell is a fungal cell such as a yeast cell, e.g., Saccharomyces spp., Schizosaccharomyces spp., Pichia spp., Paffia spp., Kluyveromyces spp., Candida spp., Talaromyces spp., Brettanomyces spp., Pachysolen spp., Debaryomnyces spp., Yarrowia spp., and industrial polyploid yeast strains. Preferably the yeast strain is a S. cerevisiae strain or a Yarrowia spp. strain. Other examples of fungi include Aspergillus spp., Penicillin spp., Fusarium spp., Rhizopus spp., Acremonium spp., Neurospora spp., Sordaria spp., Magnaporthe spp., Allomyces spp., Ustilago spp., Botrytis spp., and Trichoderma spp. In other embodiments, the cell is an algal cell or a plant cell (e.g., A. thaliana, C. reinhardtii, Arthrospira, P. tricomutum, T. suecica, P. carterae, P. tricomutum, Chlorolla spp., such as Chlorolla vulgaris). Target cells can include transgenic and recombinant cell lines, including Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO).\n\nIn various embodiments, the host cell or strain, in addition to having a SSAP system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides as described, has one or more nucleic acids for inhibiting a mismatch repair system. While these systems can be inactivated by a more permanent genetic deletion or mutation event, alternatively, the systems can be controlled by expressed inhibitor nucleic acid, which in some embodiments is inducible to render recombineering an inducible phenotype. In other embodiments, inhibitory nucleic acids are not encoded by the cell, but are provided exogenously (e.g., transiently) to allow recombineering to take place. Inhibitory nucleic acids include, but are not limited to, antisense oligonucleotides, antagomirs, and RNAi-related sequences (e.g., short hairpin RNA (shRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)) that target mismatch repair genes within a target cell and thereby decrease expression of the mismatch repair gene in the cell. Mismatch repair genes that can be targeted include but are not limited to, for example, one or more of Msh2, Msh3, Msh6, Msh1, Msh2, and/or Pms1.\n\nThe mismatch repair (MMR) system is primarily responsible for correcting errors following replication, but it also directly takes part in homologous recombination by rejecting recombination partners with insufficient homology. The proteins responsible for initiation of E. coli mismatch repair are MutS and MutL, which function as homo-oligomers. MutS is responsible for mismatch recognition and MutL serves to interface mismatch recognition by MutS to activation of downstream activities. Eukaryotes have at least two MutS heterodimers that share MSH2 as a common subunit: MSH2-MSH6 and MSH2-MSH3. The MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer mainly recognizes single nucleotide substitutions and small loops of 1 or 2 bases, while the MSH2/MSH3 pair has greater affinity for larger loops of 2-5 unpaired nucleotides. Three eukaryotic MutL heterodimeric complexes have been identified with MLH1 serving as a common subunit: MLH1-PMS2, MLH1-PMS1, and MLH1-MLH3, MLH1-PMS2 is the primary MutL activity in human mitotic cells and supports repair initiated by either MutS heterodimer.\n\nAvoidance of the MMR system in E. coli recombineering is substantially more effective in strains lacking MMR machinery, at the cost, or benefit depending on perspective, of higher overall mutation rates. See, e.g., and US Patent Publication No. 2005/0079618, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Indeed temporary suppression of MMR is an effective strategy for enhancing gene-editing efficiency in many cells. Using short-hairpins to suppress MSH2 expression allows for large increases in allelic recombination efficiency. Transient suppression of MSH2 by shRNA is very effective for base substitutions, particularly for the simultaneous substitution of 3-4 bases rather than 1 or 2. Transient knockdown of the downstream MMR gene, Msh, rendered ES cells permissive for oligo-mediated single base pair alterations. Other factors at the interface of homologous recombination and mismatch repair may also markedly contribute to increased allelic recombination efficiency. For example, oligo-mediated targeted mutagenesis by Rad51/54 in early mouse embryos is enhanced by inhibition of the homologous recombination partners Ku70/86. Numerous other interactions exist that could potentially offer subtle or even dramatic improvements. For example, disassembly of the Rad51-ssDNA filament is controlled by the Srs2 helicase and Rad52-mediated annealing between divergent homologous sequences is subjected to heteroduplex rejection by the Sgs1 helicase. The connection between these two processes can also explain, without wishing to be bound by theory, why deletion of RAD54, which promotes stabilization of Rad51-ssDNA filaments and DNA strand invasion, also increases SSA efficiency. Furthermore, the Rad52 SSA recombination pathway also depends on MSH2, MSH3 and numerous other components.\n\nIn some embodiments one or more inhibitory nucleic acids can be antisense oligonucleotides. Antisense oligonucleotides may be designed to block expression of a DNA or RNA target by binding to the target and halting expression at the level of transcription, translation, or splicing. The antisense oligonucleotides can be complementary nucleic acid sequences, or substantially complementary sequences, designed to hybridize under stringent conditions to a mismatch repair gene. In some instances, one or more inhibitory nucleic acids can be RNAi-related sequences, including but not limited to a small interfering RNA (âsiRNAâ) or short hairpin RNA (âshRNAâ). The interfering RNA can be assembled from two separate oligonucleotides, where one strand is the sense strand and the other is the antisense strand, wherein the antisense and sense strands are self-complementary (i.e., each strand comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in the other strand; such as where the antisense strand and sense strand form a duplex or double stranded structure); the antisense strand comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof (i.e., an undesired gene) and the sense strand comprises nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof. Alternatively, interfering RNA is assembled from a single oligonucleotide, where the self-complementary sense and antisense regions are linked by means of nucleic acid based or non-nucleic acid-based linker(s). The interfering RNA can be a polynucleotide with a duplex, asymmetric duplex, hairpin or asymmetric hairpin secondary structure, having self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence in a separate target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof. The interfering RNA can be a circular single-stranded polynucleotide having two or more loop structures and a stem comprising self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof, and wherein the circular polynucleotide can be processed either in a target cell to generate an active siRNA molecule capable of mediating RNA interference.\n\nIn some instances, the interfering RNA coding region encodes a self-complementary RNA molecule having a sense region, an antisense region and a loop region. Such an RNA molecule when expressed desirably forms a âhairpinâ structure, and is referred to herein as an âshRNA.â The loop region is generally between about 2 and about 10 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the loop region is from about 6 to about 9 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the sense region and the antisense region are between about 15 and about 23 nucleotides in length. Following post-transcriptional processing, the small hairpin RNA is converted into a siRNA by a cleavage event mediated by the enzyme Dicer, which is a member of the RNase III family. The siRNA is then capable of inhibiting the expression of a gene with which it shares homology. For details, see Brummelkamp et al., Science 296:550-553, (2002); Lee et al, Nature Biotechnol., 20, 500-505, (2002); Miyagishi and Taira, Nature Biotechnol 20:497-500, (2002); Paddison et al. Genes & Dev. 16:948-958, (2002); Paul, Nature Biotechnol, 20, 505-508, (2002); Sui, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sd. USA, 99(6), 5515-5520, (2002); Yu et al). Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99:6047-6052, (2002).\n\nThe target RNA cleavage reaction guided by siRNAs is highly sequence specific. In general, siRNA containing a nucleotide sequences identical to a portion of the target nucleic acid (i.e., a mismatch repair gene) are preferred for inhibition. However, 100% sequence identity between the siRNA and the target gene is not required. Thus the invention has the advantage of being able to tolerate sequence variations that might be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence. For example, siRNA sequences with insertions, deletions, and single point mutations relative to the target sequence have also been found to be effective for inhibition. Alternatively, siRNA sequences with nucleotide analog substitutions or insertions can be effective for inhibition. In general the siRNAs must retain specificity for their target, i.e., must not directly bind to, or directly significantly affect expression levels of, transcripts other than the intended target.\n\nIn some embodiments, a one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids are used to target one or more of Msh2, Msh3, Msh6, Msh1, Msh2, Msh 3, and/or Pms1, in Saccharomyces cerevisiaee, Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces castellii, Kluyveromyces lacbs, Pichia stipitis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, or mammalian (e.g., non-human mammalian cells). For example, a construct for use in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can include one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids that target Msh2 (NP 014551.1), Msh3 (NP 010016.2), Msh6 (NP 010382.10), Msh1 (NP 013890.1), Msh3 (NP 015161.1), and/or Pms1 (NP 014317.2). In some instances, constructs can include one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids that target different regions within the same gene. For example, in the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, constructs can include one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids against Msh2 (NP 014551.1), Msh3 (NP 010016.2), Msh6 (NP 010382.10), Msh1 (NP 013890.1), Msh3 (NP 015161.1), and/or Pms1 (NP 014317.2). In an equivalent manner, targeting of the following genes can also occur:\n\nTarget gene\n\nTarget cell Msh2 Msh3 Msh6 Mlh1 Mlh3 Pms1/2 Saccharomyces NP_014551.1 NP_010016.2 NP_010382.1 NP_013890.1 NP_015161.1 NP_014317.2 cerevisiae Pichia pastoris XP_002490775.1 XP_002490502.1 XP_002490975.1 XP_002491051.1 XP_001388013.2 XP_002493530.1 Saccharomyces CCC67425.1 CCC70051.1 CCC68482.1 CCC69671.1 CCC69118.1 CCC71165.1 castellii Kluyveromyces XP_455202.1 XP_453028.1 XP_452992.1 XP_53504.1 XP_452646.1 XP_452705.1 lactis Pichia stipites XP 001386399.2 XP 001384191.2 XP 001387139.2 XP 001384344.2 XP 001388013.2 XP 001384508.2 Schizosaccharomyces XP_001713136.1 NP_593952.1 NP_588344.1 NP_596199.1 NP_594417.1 pombe Escherichia coli NP417213.1 Chlamydomonas XP_001698121.1 XP_001689901.1 XP_001690102.1 XP_001692227.1 reinhardtii Arabidopsis NP_566804.3 NP_194284.2 NP_192116.1 NP_567345.2 NP_195277.5 NP_567236.1 thaliana NP_850630.1 NP_189075.2 Cacnorhabditis NP 491202.1 NP 491163.1 NP 499796.2 NP 505933.1 NP 505933.1 elegans Mus musculus NP_032654.1 NP_034959.2 NP_034960.1 NP_081086.1 NP_780546.1 NP_032912.2\n\nIn some embodiments, the host cell or strain has one or more genetic modifications to protect oligos following entry into the cell. Knocking out four potent ssDNA exonucleases in E. coli improves oligomediated allelic recombination frequency when low concentrations of oligos are used. ExoVII has been identified as a nuclease which degrades the ends of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cassettes. Removing this nuclease may improve both recombination frequency and the inheritance of mutations at 3â² ends of ssDNA and dsDNA. Removing ExoVII and the set of four exonucleases (RecJ, ExoI, ExoX, and Lambda Exo) improves recombineering performance.\n\nIn some embodiments, the host cell or strain provides for controlled activation/termination (e.g. expression of the machinery necessary for recombineering, or double-strand break or nicking by the programmable site-specific recombinase systems described herein, can be controlled). Control of machinery that suppresses the mismatch repair mechanisms of the host cell provides for genomic stability before and after the recombineering process. In some embodiments, expression of constructs can be induced by chemical or thermal means and can remain unexpressed when not induced (or vice versa). In some embodiments, the recombineering phenotype or programmable site-specific nuclease phenotype is reversible, that is, constructs can be removed after performing the recombineering process. In the case where the construct is to be maintained as a plasmid or episome with a selectable marker, the construct can be removed by growth in non-selectable media as is standard practice for the target organism. In the case where the construct is to be integrated into the host genome, the device may include sequence elements to allow for rapid removal (e.g., flanking loxP sequence).\n\nExpression control sequences suitable for regulating expression of a SSAP system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides, programmable nucleases, and optionally one or more inhibitory nucleic acids, can include a promoter and/or enhancer sequence. The promoter and/or the enhancer can be inducible (e.g. chemically or physically regulated). A chemically regulated promoter and/or enhancer can, for example, be regulated by the presence of alcohol, tetracycline, a steroid, or a metal, to name but a few. A physically regulated promoter and/or enhancer can, for example, be regulated by environmental factors, such as temperature and light. In some instances, expression control sequences can include copper and nickel dependent promoters such as the Cyc6 promoter (Quinn et al., Eukaryotic cell, 2:995-1002 (2003)). In some instances, expression control sequences can include light induced expression control systems that include, e.g., the Cabll-1 promoter. In some instances, expression control sequences can include tetracycline-controlled systems, including Tet-Off and Tet-On (Bujard et al., PNAS USA, 89:5547-51 (1992)).\n\nIn some embodiments, the host cell or strain controls localization of recombineering or programmable nuclease effectors within the cell, to thereby control the process in an on or off fashion. For example, the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen receptor (ER) can be used to regulate the localization and activity of nuclear proteins in yeast and mammalian cells. Nuclear proteins containing the ER LBD are retained in the cytoplasm until activated by estradiol or the functional estrogen antagonists tamoxifen (TAM) or 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT). Upon binding, the ligand displaces Hsp90 and facilitates correct folding of the released fusion protein, which activates the LBD fused nuclear protein and allows translocation to the nucleus. Several ER ligand variants with different activation mechanisms are known. The mouse ER LBD mutant G525R and corresponding human mutant G521R (ERT) exhibit roughly a 1000-fold reduction in 17Î²-estradiol binding affinity compared to wildtype, yet retain normal affinity for TAM and 4OHT. The 4OHT affinity of the human ER LBD mutant ERT2 (G400V/M543A/L544A) is approximately 4-fold higher than that of ERT. In addition to the Gal4 transcription factor fusion to ER and VP16 (GEV), ectopic DNA enzymes such as Cre, Flp and I-SceI have successfully been controlled by fusion with ERT and other nuclear hormone receptors. These systems can be adapted for host cells of choice, including yeast.\n\nIn some embodiments, ER LBD and mutants fused to other yeast nuclear proteins would elicit the same properties of control. For example, fusing these components to various mutant SSAP or SSAP enabling genes allows constitutive expression, whereby the proteins remain inactive (and non-physiological) in the cytosol until activated prior to transformation. Furthermore, an inducible protein degradation system using the GEV system to activate expression of the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease is useful in the present invention. TEV specifically degrades proteins with the N-degron peptide sequence. With expression of TEV under tight control of the GEV system. MMR and/or Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway members with N-degron sequences can be degraded concomitant with SSAP activation.\n\nIn these or alternative embodiments, the host cell or strain can include one or more nucleic acids encoding one or more CRISPR pathway components e.g., operably linked to expression control sequences. In some instances, expression control sequences for protein beta, one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids, and/or RNAi and/or CRISPR machinery can be distinct and independently controlled. In some instances, expression control sequences for protein beta, one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids, and/or RNAi and/or CRISPR machinery can be the same or can be induced via the same signal.\n\nIn some aspects, the invention is applicable to prokaryotic organisms that are more difficult to genetically manipulate than E. coli. For example, the invention allows for target genes to be introduced into E. coli using a vector that is compatible for replication in E. coli and the desired host, and after undergoing rounds of engineering in E. coli, the engineered vectors are introduced in the host cell of choice. For example, in these embodiments the method comprises providing a vector suitable for replication in a target species (e.g. any of the cells disclosed herein) and suitable for replication in a second species (e.g. any of the cells disclosed herein). The second species expresses a SSAP system and/or recombinase that optionally promotes annealing of single stranded oligonucleotides at the lagging strand of the replication fork, or the second species expresses a gene editing system, wherein the vector comprises a target polynucleotide for engineering. The vector is introduced into the second species under conditions suitable for diversification of said target polynucleotide by the SSAP system and/or recombinase, and the vector library isolated and introduced into said target species. The second species may be E. coli, and the target species can be a slow growing organism. In some embodiments, the target species is S. cerevisiae or an actinomycetes and the second species is E. coli, or the target species is a plant and the second species is an agrobacter.\n\nIn some embodiments, genome engineering for the target organism is conducted in a MAGE-competent recombineering strain, for example such as an E. coli strain described herein, anlocus (or library thereof) exported to target cells (e.g., non-recombineering or MAGE-competent strains). In certain embodiments, the invention provides a method for multiplex genomic alteration of a target cell population, comprising: (a) generating a combinatorial vector library in a recombineering cell population; and (b) transferring the combinatorial vector library to a target cell population. While genome engineering methods such as MAGE, CRISPR/Cas9, BuDs, ZFNs, TALEs, and TALENs are applicable to many diverse species, multiplex application of these technologies can be hindered in some organisms by the length of time required to execute the sequential rounds of engineering necessary to accumulate the combinatorial diversity in the loci of interest. For example, organisms such as Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces spp.), are relatively slow growing and laboratory techniques used to perform genetic manipulations may take days or weeks. To facilitate application of multiplex genome engineering techniques in slow growing or difficult to manipulate organisms, such as the Actinomycetes, the present invention provides methods and compositions to elaborate the diversity indirectly in a faster growing and easier to manipulate organism, such as E. coli, via a shuttle system. By elaborating the diversity in the shuttle system within the facile E. coli host, then introducing the generated shuttle library into the target organism, extended sequential cycles in the non-facile target organism are avoided. Such methods and compositions are applicable to a variety of multiplex genome engineering techniques (e.g. MAGE, CAGE, CRISPR/Cas9, BuDs, ZFNs, TALEs, and TALENs). In some embodiments the genetic diversity at the desired locus is synthesized and not elaborated with a technique such as MAGE, then cloned directly into the vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) using standard methods. In still other embodiments the genetic diversity is synthesized and cloned directly into the vector. In still other embodiments the DNA is then further elaborated with a technique such as MAGE.\n\nIn some embodiments, the vector possesses one or more selectable markers such that the vector may be selected for in both the recombineering organism and the target organism. In still other embodiments all or a portion of the site-specific programmable nuclease system (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9g, TALEN, ZFN, BuD, or homologous or analogous system) is encoded and coupled, e.g. in the same vector. For example, when using the CRISPR/Cas9 system the components of the site-specific programmable nuclease system comprises the gRNA or crRNA and tracrRNA In some embodiments, the gRNA (e.g. synthetic gRNA) is present on the same vector. In some embodiments, the crRNA is present on the same vector. In some embodiments, the crRNA and tracrRNA are present on the same vector. In some embodiments, the Cas9 is present on the same vector. In some embodiments, the same vector encodes one or more TALENs programmed to cut the target sequence. In some embodiments, the same vector encodes one or more ZFNs programmed to cut the target sequence. In some embodiments, the same vector encodes one or more BuDs programmed to cut the target sequence. In some embodiments, the site-specific programmable nuclease system is directly tethered on the same DNA to the repair or donor sequence that is elaborated with a multiplex genome engineering technique (e.g. MAGE, CAGE, CRISPR/Cas9, BuDs, ZFNs, TALEs, and TALENs) (e.g. there is roughly a 1:1:1 ratio of DNA encoding selectable marker for the target organism, the programmable nuclease designed to cut the organism genome and the repair or donor DNA). Also, in some embodiments, there may be one or more (e.g. 1, or 2, or 3, or 4, etc.) of the site-specific programmable nuclease system and repair or donor sequence on the same vector (e.g. one or more gRNA and donor sequence on the same vector (optionally also with Cas9 on the same vector), one or more crRNA and donor sequence on the same vector (optionally also with Cas9 on the same vector), one or more crRNA and tracrRNA and donor sequence on the same vector (optionally also with Cas9 on the same vector), one or more TALENs programmed to cut the target sequence and donor sequence on the same vector, one or more ZFNs programmed to cut the target sequence and donor sequence on the same vector, and one or more BuDs programmed to cut the target sequence and donor sequence on the same vector). In various embodiments, such vectors, each targeting a unique genomic locus, may be transformed together, optionally in a cyclical manner in a similar way as with MAGE (as described herein). In some embodiments, the systems described herein allow selection for the vector DNA, and against wild type genomic locus being targeted by the programmable nuclease, by providing relief from genome cutting through repair by the donor DNA that contains the desired mutation(s).\n\nThis approach allows for a scarless method for selecting recombinants and obviates the need for additional or genome integrating selectable markers. In this case, recombination with the homologous target region mutated at the wild-type locus targeted by the site-specific nuclease permits the cell to escape restriction by the programmed nuclease system. In other words, recombination with the mutated sequence frees the organism from the genomic instability caused by the programmable site-specific nuclease. Thus, in some embodiments, a library of plasmids is introduced into a population of host cells, the plasmids encoding and allowing for expression of Cas9 or homologous or analogous CRIPSR enzyme, and a crRNA/tracrRNA or synthetic guide RNA targeting a region of the host cell genome. In still other embodiments. Cas9 is expressed from the genome or separate from the plasmid and the plasmids express only a crRNA/tracrRNA or a single synthetic guide RNA. In still other embodiments, the tracrRNA is also expressed from the genome or separate from the plasmid and only the crRNA is encoded on the plasmid. In still other embodiments, the plasmids encode one or more TALENs, ZFNs, BuDs, or analogous system, each further providing a donor nucleic acid for introduction into the targeted region of the host genome. In this manner, desired donor nucleic acids targeting the particular site can be introduced into the host cell and screened or selected for desired phenotype. In various embodiments, the donor nucleic acids are not susceptible to cutting by the Cas9 and crRNA/tracrRNA (or synthetic guide RNA), or analogous programmable nuclease described herein, that is introduced into the system. The library of vectors may thereby allow for the screening of any number of variant donor nucleic acids, such at least about 102, about 103, about 104, about 105, about 105, about 107, about 108, about 109, about 1010 or more, without an additional or integrating selectable marker to select for recombination events. In some embodiments, the library varies one or more (or all) of promoter sequences, ribosomal binding sequences, coding region variations, silent codon variations, synthetic scaffold components, and protein tags to select for optimal expression, function, and/or activity of the target.\n\nCloning methods are known in the art and include, by way of non-limiting example, fusion PCR and assembly PCR see, e.g. Stemmer et al. Gene 164(1): 49-53 (1995), inverse fusion PCR see, e.g. Spiliotis et al. PLoS ONE 7(4): 35407 (2012), site directed mutagenesis see, e.g. Ruvkun et al. Nature 289(5793): 85-88 (1981).

PNAS 70 (11): 3240-4 (1973).\n\nIn some embodiments, the shuttle vector encodes an origin of replication suitable for both the host where the combinatorial vector library is generated (e.g., E. coli) as well as an origin of replication of one or more target organisms where the desired mutations are to be introduced. Illustrative origins of replication are known in the art (see, e.g., Bryant et al., J Exp Bot., 52(355):193-202 (2001); Edward et al., Basic Virology Third Edition, Blackwell publishing, ISBN 1-4051-4715-6 (2007); Mott and Berger, Nat.

Virol., 79(10): 5933-5942 (2005); Kelman, Trends Microbial., 12: 399-401 (2004); Nasheuer et al., Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol., 72: 41-94 (2002), the contents of which are hereby incorportated by reference in their entireties).\n\nIn some embodiments, a programmable nuclease is employed in the recombineering or MAGE-competent organism, or organism where the combinatorial shuttle vector library is generated, in order to eliminate those vectors where mutations were not introduced into the desired target sequence of the target organism through the course of engineering. Thus, the final vector library produced is substantially enriched for possession of mutated target sequences to be introduced into the target organism.\n\nIn some embodiments, the shuttle vector encodes an origin of replication allowing for tunable control of copy number such as pETcoco-1 or pETcoco2, such that when creating the combinatorial library, a lower plasmid copy number can be utilized to elaborate the genetic diversity at the desired locus (as described herein). As such, the proportion of vectors within the cell population undergoing allelic replacement with an oligonucleotide is increased at each cycle. Furthermore, the copy number can be increased prior to transfer to the target organism, in order to increase yield.\n\nÎ» RED-mediated (or functionally similar) genetic manipulation of a compound-producing Actinomycetes may be undertaken. The strategy employs E. coli as a surrogate to enable recominbeering with the Î» RED cassette. The E. coli strain may carry a plasmid expressing Î» RED, and a vector containing one or more target genes or regions in the Actinomycetes or other non-recombineering cell. Recombineering is used to perform the replacement with an oligo library targeting the Actinomycetes gene of interest within the vector. The vector may then be purified and transferred and/or conjugated or used in any other suitable transferring technique. The genetic exchange in Actinomycetes is subsequently achieved by homologous recombination between the chromosomal locus and the recombinant vector following conjugation.\n\nThe inclusion of oriT (RK2) allows conjugation to introduce the recombineering-modified vector into an Actinomycete (e.g. Streptomyces coelicolor). Conjugation is more efficient than transformation of protoplasts and is readily applicable to many actinomycetes. The potent methyl-specific restriction system of Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces) is circumvented by passaging the vector DNA through a methylation-deficient E. coli host such as, for example, ET12567 and various Dam-Dcm-strains. Alternatively, the recombineering strain itself may be made methylation-deficient.\n\nVectors with an oriT (RK2) site are transmissible in trans by pUB307 in E. coli or the non-transmissible pUZ8002, which lacks a cis-acting function. To adapt the procedure of Î» RED-mediated recombination for Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces), cassettes were constructed that can be selected both in E. coli and in Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces). After a single disruption with an onT-containing cassette, further disruptions can be performed on the same vector using oriT-free cassettes containing alternative selective markers.\n\nThus, a MAGE-competent strain of E. coli can readily be used to develop a combinatorial library of Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces, S. coelicolor) vectors targeting one or multiple Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces, S. coelicolor) genomic loci. The entire E. coli library would subsequently be conjugated with Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces, S. coelicolor) as outlined herein.\n\nThe combinatorial vector library can be constructed in multiple ways to facilitate multiplex genome engineering of diverse cells as described herein. In one embodiment, a vector possessing a sequence allowing conjugation with Streptomyces, such as oriT, a selectable marker and origin of replication for E. coli and one or multiple cassettes is used for construction. In some embodiments, each cassette may be engineered by MAGE (e.g., SSAP system and/or recombinase) to create a diverse combinatorial vector library. In some embodiments, a cassette is a region of homologous DNA, with one or more insertions, deletions, or mutations introduced by MAGE (for example) or synthetic DNA method, designed to target a specific locus of the genome of the Actinomycete spp., and/or encodes one or more genes conferring function necessary or useful for one or more cassettes to recombine with its target locus in the genome of the Actimonycete spp. In some embodiments, the cassettes are separated by one or more restriction digest sites that enable digestion by an endogenous restriction endonuclease, (e.g., Sau32391, StuI, or ScoI) or an exogenous restriction endonuclease encoded by one or more of the cassettes, under control of an inducible or constitutive promoter.\n\nIn some embodiments, a cassette may possess one or more genetic markers that can be selected in the Actinomycete spp. In various embodiments, the marker enables selection of the vector prior to integration and/or the marker is capable of integrating into the genome of the Actimonycete spp. together with the region of homologous DNA, with one or more insertions, deletions, or mutations introduced by MAGE or synthetic DNA method. In some embodiments, the marker can be recycled for use in subsequent modifications of the genome of the Actimonycete spp. by, for example, flanking the marker sequence with site-specific recombinase recognition targets such as FRT or loxP for example, that can be excised from the genome following expression of Flp or Cre recombinase, respectively, using standard methods.\n\nIn some embodiments, the cassette contains one or more genes, under control of an inducible, repressible, or constitutive promoter, that render the recipient strain improved in homologous recombination efficiency, e.g.: the Î» RED cassette from phage Î»; RecE/T; homologs of the Rad52, Red-beta, Erf, Sak, Rad51 superfamily, and/or endogenous or exogenous analogs and Beta from E. coli, EF2132 from E. faecalis, OrfC from L. pneumophila, s065 from V. cholera, plu2935 from P. luminescens, RecT from E. coli, Orf48 from L. monocytogenes, Orf245 from L. lactis, GP35 from B. subtilis, GP61 from M. smegmatis, GP20 from S. aureus and/or endogenous or exogenous analogs.\n\nIn one embodiment, multiple vectors are used for construction. In some embodiments, one or more vectors comprise a sequence allowing conjugation with Actinomycete spp. (e.g. Streptomyces), such as oriT; and/or a selectable marker and origin or replication for E. coli; and/or a cassette.\n\nIn some embodiments, one or more vectors optionally further comprises a sequence which encodes a programmable site-specific nuclease system (e.g., TALEN, BuD, or CRISPR/Cas9) as described above, or one or more components of such a system, such as a tracrRNA, crRNA, or synthetic guide RNA, targeting the wild-type locus of a region of the Actimonycete spp. genome targeted for diversification by the cassette conferring the homologous sequence, as described herein, where the site-specific nuclease may be under control of an inducible, repressible, or constitutive promoter. In some embodiments, the cassette may be engineered to create a diverse combinatorial vector library using the methods described herein and/or by including synthesized DNA.\n\nIn some embodiments, the cassette possesses one or more genetic markers that can be selected in the Actinomycete spp. such that, for example, the marker enables selection of the vector prior to integration; or the marker is capable of integrating into the genome of the Actimonycete spp. together with the region of homologous DNA, with one or more insertions, deletions, or mutations introduced by MAGE (for example) or synthetic DNA method. In various embodiments, the marker can be recycled for use in subsequent modifications of the genome of the Actimonycete spp. by flanking the marker sequence with site-specific recombinase recognition targets such as FRT or loxP for example, that can be excised from the genome following expression of Flp or Cre recombinase, respectively.\n\nIn some embodiments, conjugation can then be used to efficiently introduce the modified DNA library into Actinomycetes using previously described techniques (see, e.g., Matsushima, incorporated by reference in its entirety). In some embodiments, the modified DNA library can be introduced by means known in the art (by way of non-limiting example, transfection, transformation, phage, electroporation, biolistics etc.).\n\nWhen selectable markers are used the number of genomic loci targeted for combinatorial mutations can be either 1:1 or 1: greater than 1 (marker:locus/loci). That is, a selection marker may be tied to the targeting of a single site or the same marker may be tied to several targeted sites. When used in a 1:1 manner, the selection ensures that the locus of interest has been modified. When used as 1:greater than 1 the marker ensures that at least one of the targeted loci have been modified. Multiple recovery cycles for the markers will lead to an accumulation of scars on the genome (e.g., loxP, FRT, etc. sites) which may lead to genomic instability, thus decreasing the overall efficiency of the approach(es) due to decreased viability in the population.\n\nAnother method of selection includes the use of a site-specific nuclease (such as CRIPSR/Cas9 or a TALEN) programmed to recognize the wildtype sequence of the Actimonycete spp genomic region targeted for diversification by the cassette conferring the homologous sequence as described herein. When coupled, e.g. in the same vector, to an individual locus targeted by the cassette, this approach can result in a scarless method for selecting recombinants and obviates the need for a selectable marker. In this case, recombination with the homologous target region mutated at the wild-type locus targeted by the site-specific nuclease, is the only way to escape repeated cutting by the nuclease. In other words, recombination with the mutated sequence frees the organism from the genomic instability caused by the site-specific nuclease.\n\nIn some embodiments, the endogenous exonuclease system(s), e.g. RecD, SbcCD, of the host Actinomycete spp. are disrupted.\n\nIn some embodiments, conjugation is used to transfer the mutated vector or plasmid from a MAGE-competent organism, e.g., Escherichia coli, to the host cell. For example the conjugation may employ the oriT system described as above to transform Streptyomyces. In some embodiments, the plasmid or vetor system encodes the T-DNA or analogous system, to enable transfer of the mutated plasmid or vector DNA to plant cells with Agrobacterium (e.g., Agrobacterium tumefaciens), as anyone skilled in the art will recognize, for the purpose of genetic engineering of plant cells.\n\nThese systems thereby expand the engineering approaches to essentially any host cell. For example, host cells can include eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic cells, including bacterial, yeast, agal, plant, insect, and/or non-human mammalian cells, or immortal cell lines. For example, the host cell may be Esherichia coli, Saccharamyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces castelli, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia stipibs, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis thaliana, or Caenorhabditis elegans.

In other embodiments, the cell is a fungal cell such as a yeast cell, e.g., Saccharomyces spp., Schizosaccharomyces spp., Pichia spp., Paffia spp., Kluyveromyces spp., Candida spp., Talaromyces spp., Brettanomyces spp., Pachysolen spp., Debaryomyces spp., Yarrowia spp., and industrial polyploid yeast strains. Preferably the yeast strain is a S. cerevisiae strain or a Yarrowia spp. strain.

Target cells can include transgenic and recombinant cell lines. In addition, heterologous cell lines can be used, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO).\n\nIn some embodiments the cell is a bacterial cell, such as Badillus spp, Actinomycetes spp Escherichia spp., Streptomyces spp., Zymonas app., Acetobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Synechocystis spp., Rhizobium spp., Clostridium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., Xanthomonas spp., Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Alcaligenes spp., Pseudomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., Azotobacter spp., Comamonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., Rhodococcus spp., Gluconobacter spp., Ralstonia spp., Acidithiobacillus spp., Microlunatus spp., Geobacter spp., Geobacillus spp., Arthrobacter spp., Flavobacterium spp., Serratia spp., Saccharopolyspora spp., Thermus spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., Chromobacterium spp., Sinorhizobium spp., Saccharopolyspora spp., Agrobacterium spp, and Pantoea spp. The bacterial cell can be a Gram-negative cell such as an Escherichia coli (E. coli) cell, or a Gram-positive cell such as a species of Bacillus. In other embodiments, the cell is a fungal cell such as a yeast cell, e.g., Saccharomyces spp., Schizosaccharomyces app., Pichia spp., Paffia spp., Kluyveromyces spp., Candida spp., Talaromyces spp., Brettanomyces spp., Pachysolen spp., Debaryomyces spp., Yarrowia spp., and industrial polyploid yeast strains. Preferably the yeast strain is a S. cerevisiae strain or a Yarrowia spp. strain.

Target cells can include transgenic and recombinant cell lines. In addition, heterologous cell lines can be used, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO). Host cells may be unicellular host cells or multicellular host cells.\n\nIn some embodiments, the cell suitable for use in and/or with the compositions and methods described herein is an Actinomycetes spp. cell. Actinomycetes are a heterogeneous collection of bacteria that form branching filaments which include, for example, Actinomyces, Actinomadura, Nocardia, Streptomyces and related genera.

For example, the present multiplex genome engineering techniques are used to alter probiotic cells to, for example, increase the functionality of the probiotic cells (e.g. increase digestion, synthesize various vitamins or amino acids, decrease pathogens, etc.). Accordingly, various probiotic species are a cell of the present invention. For example, the cell may be E. coli Nissle 1917.

In some embodiments, the genomic engineering methods alter or diversify the suitable feedstock for a host cell. For example, the process may enhance the usage of feedstock selected from industrial or municipal waste, syngas, methane, as well as cellulosic or lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as sugar cane bagasse, wheat straw, corn stover, or other. For example, the feedstock may be processed from cardboard, paper, yard waste and/or other agricultural waste. In some embodiments, the recombineered strain enhances the availability of five and/or six carbon sugars that are available for metabolism.\n\nIn some embodiments, the genomic engineering methods alter carbon flux to increase or decrease the level of one or more glycolysis intermediates or products, such as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde. dihydroxyacetonephosphate, glycerol, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, 3-phospho-glycerate, 2-phospho-glycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate.

First, an engineering round is conducted to target all genes of one or more pathways, such as one or more (or three, four, five, or more) of glycolysis, tricarboxylic acd cycle, Embden-Meyerhof-Pamas. Entner-Doudoroff, pentose phosphate, phosphoketolase pathway, and glyoxylate pathway (or others described herein). The engineering round is conducted by varying at least one sub-sequence of each enzyme or related genomic target, such as the ribosomal binding sequence. so as to produce an engineered library of mutants with decreases and increases in expression of each enzyme, change in cellular localization with or without respect to other pathway components, functional characteristics of one or more enzymes, as well as additional endogenous components that may affect cellular characteristics affecting the performance of one or more pathway components (e.g., pH, import/export, degradation rates, etc.) and various combinations thereof.\n\nIn various embodiments the invention provides methods to employ combinatorial in vivo screening of synthetic scaffolds to a set of enzymes involved in production of a desired target molecule (John E Dueber, Gabriel C Wu, G Reza Malmirchegini, Tae Seok Moon, Christopher J Petzold, Adeeti V Ullal, Kristala L J Prather & Jay D Keasling.

Having then generated any number of strains with mutations in these various aspects, these cells are subjected to a selection or screen for the production of a desired compound or intermediate. Any suitable chemical, analytical, biochemical, biophysical, microbiologic, phenotypic screen common in the art may be applied to identify the improved strain. Non-limiting examples of screening methods include chromatographic analysis, spectroscopic analysis, extraction followed by an analytical chromatographic step, chemical chromogenic assay, flow cytometric analysis and sorting, enzymatic activity assay, zone of inhibition assay, auxotrophic reporter strain growth assay, etc. By then determining the incorporated sequences that gave rise to the increased production, further rounds of targeted genomic engineering may be conducted on the identified genes.\n\nAlternatively or in combination, a sensor strategy may be coupled to a selectable marker or system to identify improved strains. A competitive advantage, such as improved growth, can be induced by a system engineered to respond to the phenotypic improvement being sought, such as higher production of a metabolite. See, e.g., Bertels F, Merker H, Kost C (2012) Design and Characterization of Auxotrophy-Based Amino Acid Biosensors. PLoS ONE 7(7): e41349. For instance, a chemical binding transcription factor can be used to drive expression, via its cognate promoter, of a selectable marker, such as TolC. Expression of the selectable marker may be modulated through means such as transcription factor recruitment or mRNA processing (riboswitch) as long as the expression is regulated by the improved phenotype. Non-limiting examples of sensors include LacI for IPTG or a riboswitch for riboflavin.\n\nAdditionally, the screening techniques may be used singly or in combination. In one instance, a sensor-selector screen may be applied to identify a series of high producing strains which are then interrogated for best performers by use of a quantitative chromatographic assay.\n\nIn some embodiments, the host cell or strain is engineered to enhance the expression or activity of one or more recombinant genes such that genes are regulated and optimized for product development. For example, the target recombinant enzyme may be one or more of an oxidoreductase, transferase, hydrolase, lyase, isomerase, or ligase specific for the desired substrate, and which may be a product of a core metabolic pathway as described, or an endogenous biosynthetic pathway. In some embodiments, at least one enzyme is an endogenous or heterologous cytochrome P450 oxidase enzyme, which may be fused in some embodiments to its reductase partner.\n\nIn other aspects, the invention provides engineered cells made through proce"
