        "text": "Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare inherited disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other body systems. This disorder is characterized by progressive difficulty with coordinating movements (ataxia) beginning in early childhood, usually before age 5. Affected children typically develop difficulty walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The movement problems typically cause people to require wheelchair assistance by adolescence. People with this disorder also have slurred speech and trouble moving their eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia). Small clusters of enlarged blood vessels called telangiectases, which occur in the eyes and on the surface of the skin, are also characteristic of this condition.\n\nAffected individuals tend to have high amounts of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in their blood. The level of this protein is normally increased in the bloodstream of pregnant women, but it is unknown why individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia have elevated AFP or what effects it has in these individuals.\n\nPeople with ataxia-telangiectasia often have a weakened immune system, and many develop chronic lung infections. They also have an increased risk of developing cancer, particularly cancer of blood-forming cells (leukemia) and cancer of immune system cells (lymphoma). Affected individuals are very sensitive to the effects of radiation exposure, including medical x-rays.\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia has no cure, though treatments might improve some symptoms. These treatments include physical and speech therapy and improving deficits in the immune system and nutrition. The life expectancy of people with ataxia-telangiectasia varies greatly, but affected individuals typically live into early adulthood.\n\nAtaxia Telangiectasia (AT)—also known as Louis-Bar syndrome, cerebello-oculocutaneous telangiectasia, or immunodeficiency with ataxia telangiectasia—is a rare inherited childhood neurological disorder that affects the part of the brain that controls motor movement (intended movement of muscles) and speech. AT also affects the spine and immune system. It usually begins in early childhood before age 5.\n\nAT is caused by mutations in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasis mutated) gene. Some children with AT develop cancer, most frequently acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma.\n\nNeurological symptoms include:\n\n* Unsteady walking and lack of balance\n\n* Lack of coordination of movement\n\n* Slurred speech\n\n* Difficulty swallowing\n\n* Unintentional movement, such as tremor or jerky movement\n\n* Difficulty coordinating eye movement\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\n* Frequent respiratory infections\n\n* Red “spider” veins around the eyes, ears, or cheeks (telangiectasias)\n\n* Increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (such as X-rays or gamma rays)\n\n* Diabetes\n\n* Premature graying of the hair\n\n* Fatigue\n\n* Delayed physical and sexual development\n\nThere is no cure for AT and, currently, no way to slow the progression. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, such as physical therapy to help maintain flexibility and speech therapy to teach children how to control breathing. Additionally, high-dose vitamins, antioxidants, and gamma-globulin injections may be useful. The severity of the ATM mutation adjusts the average lifespan. Those who had a later onset and slower progression of AT typically survive into their 50s.\n\nAtaxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectases, immune defects, and a predisposition to malignancy. Chromosomal breakage is a feature. AT cells are abnormally sensitive to killing by ionizing radiation (IR), and abnormally resistant to inhibition of DNA synthesis by ionizing radiation. The latter trait has been used to identify complementation groups for the classic form of the disease (Jaspers et al., 1988). At least 4 of these (A, C, D, and E) map to chromosome 11q23 (Sanal et al., 1990) and are associated with mutations in the ATM gene."
