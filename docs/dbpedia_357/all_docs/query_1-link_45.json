The investigated collection of the mutants was heterogeneous by the level of the thiostreptone resistance (2.5 to 20 micrograms/ml). The thiostreptone resistance mutations had a pleiotropic effect: 17 per cent of the mutants was characterized by the growth thermosensitivity and 26 and 5.8 per cent of the mutants were characterized by loss of the ability to form melanine and aerial mycelium respectively. Such phenotypes were most frequent in the mutants resistant to low concentrations of thiostreptone (2 to 5 micrograms/ml). The absolute majority of the isolated thiostreptone resistant mutants was unstable and formed both the antibiotic resistant and the antibiotic sensitive clones. The greatest portion of the strains with high antibiotic activity (20 per cent) was detected among the S. erythraea spontaneous mutants on the medium with 2.5 micrograms/ ml of thiostreptone. It was shown that the instability of the high antibiotic activity in the mutants was associated with loss of the thiostreptone resistance property.\n\nComplete Genome Sequence of Thiostrepton-Producing Streptomyces laurentii ATCC 31255\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFujino, Yasuhiro; Nagayoshi, Yuko; Ohshima, Toshihisa; Ogata, Seiya\n\n2016-01-01\n\nStreptomyces laurentii ATCC 31255 produces thiostrepton, a thiopeptide class antibiotic. Here, we report the complete genome sequence for this strain, which contains a total of 8,032,664Â bp, 7,452 predicted coding sequences, and a G+C content of 72.3%.

As a first step toward cloning the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of thiostrepton (Th) in Streptomyces laurentii (Sl), the Th resistance-encoding gene (tsnR) was cloned as a 1.5-kb BamHI-PvuII fragment in Escherichia coli (Ec), and shown to confer Th resistance when introduced into S. lividans TK24. The tsnR-containing DNA fragment was used as a probe to isolate clones from cosmid libraries of DNA in the Ec cosmid vector SuperCos, and pOJ446 (an Ec/streptomycete) cosmid vector. Sequence and genetic analysis of the DNA flanking the tsnR indicates that the Sl tsnR is not closely linked to biosynthetic genes. Instead it is located within a cluster of ribosomal protein operons.\n\nThe structure of free L11 and functional dynamics of L11 in free, L11-rRNA(58 nt) binary and L11-rRNA(58 nt)-thiostrepton ternary complexes.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Donghan; Walsh, Joseph D; Yu, Ping; Markus, Michelle A; Choli-Papadopoulou, Theodora; Schwieters, Charles D; Krueger, Susan; Draper, David E; Wang, Yun-Xing\n\n2007-04-06\n\nThe L11 binding site is one of the most important functional sites in the ribosome. The N-terminal domain of L11 has been implicated as a \"reversible switch\" in facilitating the coordinated movements associated with EF-G-driven GTP hydrolysis. The reversible switch mechanism has been hypothesized to require conformational flexibility involving re-orientation and re-positioning of the two L11 domains, and warrants a close examination of the structure and dynamics of L11. Here we report the solution structure of free L11, and relaxation studies of free L11, L11 complexed to its 58 nt RNA recognition site, and L11 in a ternary complex with the RNA and thiostrepton antibiotic. The binding site of thiostrepton on L11 was also defined by analysis of structural and dynamics data and chemical shift mapping. The conclusions of this work are as follows: first, the binding of L11 to RNA leads to sizable conformation changes in the regions flanking the linker and in the hinge area that links a beta-sheet and a 3(10)-helix-turn-helix element in the N terminus. Concurrently, the change in the relative orientation may lead to re-positioning of the N terminus, as implied by a decrease of radius of gyration from 18.5 A to 16.2 A. Second, the regions, which undergo large conformation changes, exhibit motions on milliseconds-microseconds or nanoseconds-picoseconds time scales. Third, binding of thiostrepton results in more rigid conformations near the linker (Thr71) and near its putative binding site (Leu12). Lastly, conformational changes in the putative thiostrepton binding site are implicated by the re-emergence of cross-correlation peaks in the spectrum of the ternary complex, which were missing in that of the binary complex. Our combined analysis of both the chemical shift perturbation and dynamics data clearly indicates that thiostrepton binds to a pocket involving residues in the 3(10)-helix in L11.\n\nThe Structure of Free L11 and Functional Dynamics of L11 in Free, L11-rRNA(58nt) Binary and L11-rRNA(58nt)-thiostrepton Ternary Complexes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Donghan; Walsh, Joseph D.; Yu, Ping; Markus, Michelle A.; Choli-Papadopoulou, Theodora; Schwieters, Charles D.; Krueger, Susan; Draper, David E.; Wang, Yun-Xing\n\n2007-01-01\n\nSummary The L11 binding site is one of the most important functional sites in the ribosome. The N-terminal domain of L11 has been implicated as a âreversible switchâ in facilitating the coordinated movements associated with EF-Gâdriven GTP hydrolysis. The âreversible switchâ mechanism has been hypothesized to require conformational flexibility involving re-orientation and re-positioning of the two L11 domains, and warrants a close examination of the structure and dynamics of L11. Here we report the solution structure of free L11, and relaxation studies of free L11, L11complexed to its 58 nt RNA recognition site, and L11 in a ternary complex with the RNA and thiostrepton antibiotic. The binding site of thiostrepton on L11 was also defined by analysis of structural and dynamics data and chemical shift mapping. The conclusions of this work are as follows: First, the binding of L11 to RNA leads to sizable conformation changes in the regions flanking the linker and in the hinge area that links a Î²-sheets and a 310-helix-turn-helix element in the N-terminus. Concurrently, the change in the relative orientation may lead to re-positioning of the N-terminus, as implied by a decrease of radius of gyration from 18.5 Ã to 16.2 Ã . Second, the regions, which undergo large conformation changes, exhibit motions on ms-Î¼s or ns-ps time scales. Third, binding of thiostrepton results in more rigid conformations near the linker (Thr71) and near its putative binding site (Leu12). Lastly, conformational changes in the putative thiostrepton binding site are implicated by the re-emergence of cross-correlation peaks in the spectrum of the ternary complex, which were missing in that of the binary complex. Our combined analysis of both the chemical shift perturbation and dynamics data clearly indicates that thiostrepton binds to a pocket involving residues in the 310-helix in L11.

Described herein is the total synthesis of the thiopeptide natural product amythiamicin D, which utilizes a biosynthesis-inspired hetero-Diels-Alder route to the pyridine core of the antibiotic as a key step. Preliminary studies using a range of serine-derived 1-ethoxy-2-azadienes established that hetero-Diels-Alder reaction with N-acetylenamines proceeded efficiently under microwave irradiation to give 2,3,6-trisubstituted pyridines. The thiazole building blocks of the antibiotic were obtained by either classical Hantzsch reactions or by dirhodium(II)-catalyzed chemoselective carbene N-H insertion followed by thionation, and were combined to give the bis-thiazole that forms the left-hand fragment of the antibiotic. The key Diels-Alder reaction of a tris-thiazolyl azadiene with benzyl 2-(1-acetylaminoethenyl)thiazole-4-carboxylate gave the core tetrathiazolyl pyridine, which was elaborated into the natural product by successive incorporation of glycine and bis-thiazole fragments followed by macrocyclization.\n\nEffect of antibiotics on growth and laccase production from Cyathus bulleri and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus.\n\nPubMed\n\nDhawan, Shikha; Lal, Rup; Hanspal, Manjit; Kuhad, Ramesh Chander\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThe effect of nine different antibiotics (chloramphenicol, ampicillin trihydrate, kanamycin A monosulfate, neomycin sulfate, erythromycin, thiostrepton, tetracycline, apramycin sulfate and streptomycin sulfate) on growth and laccase production from Cyathus bulleri and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus has been investigated. All the antibiotics tested at a concentration of 200 mg/l affected the fungal growth, release of protein and laccase production to different extent. Inhibition in fungal growth was found to be positively correlated with increase in laccase production. Interestingly, apramycin sulfate inhibited biomass production (14.9-26.2%), nevertheless, it stimulated maximum laccase production (18.2 U/ml) in both the fungi. Increasing concentrations of apramycin sulfate enhanced laccase production from P. cinnabarinus but not from C. bulleri.\n\nPeroxiredoxin 3 Is a Redox-Dependent Target of Thiostrepton in Malignant Mesothelioma Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNewick, Kheng; Cunniff, Brian; Preston, Kelsey; Held, Paul; Arbiser, Jack; Pass, Harvey; Mossman, Brooke; Shukla, Arti; Heintz, Nicholas\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThiostrepton (TS) is a thiazole antibiotic that inhibits expression of FOXM1, an oncogenic transcription factor required for cell cycle progression and resistance to oncogene-induced oxidative stress. The mechanism of action of TS is unclear and strategies that enhance TS activity will improve its therapeutic potential. Analysis of human tumor specimens showed FOXM1 is broadly expressed in malignant mesothelioma (MM), an intractable tumor associated with asbestos exposure. The mechanism of action of TS was investigated in a cell culture model of human MM. As for other tumor cell types, TS inhibited expression of FOXM1 in MM cells in a dose-dependent manner. Suppression of FOXM1 expression and coincidental activation of ERK1/2 by TS were abrogated by pre-incubation of cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), indicating its mechanism of action in MM cells is redox-dependent. Examination of the mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase 2 (TR2)-thioredoxin 2 (TRX2)-peroxiredoxin 3 (PRX3) antioxidant network revealed that TS modifies the electrophoretic mobility of PRX3. Incubation of recombinant human PRX3 with TS in vitro also resulted in PRX3 with altered electrophoretic mobility. The cellular and recombinant species of modified PRX3 were resistant to dithiothreitol and SDS and suppressed by NAC, indicating that TS covalently adducts cysteine residues in PRX3. Reduction of endogenous mitochondrial TRX2 levels by the cationic triphenylmethane gentian violet (GV) promoted modification of PRX3 by TS and significantly enhanced its cytotoxic activity. Our results indicate TS covalently adducts PRX3, thereby disabling a major mitochondrial antioxidant network that counters chronic mitochondrial oxidative stress. Redox-active compounds like GV that modify the TR2/TRX2 network may significantly enhance the efficacy of TS, thereby providing a combinatorial approach for exploiting redox-dependent perturbations in mitochondrial function as a therapeutic approach in\n\nThe antituberculosis antibiotic capreomycin inhibits protein synthesis by disrupting interaction between ribosomal proteins L12 and L10.\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Yuan; Li, Yan; Zhu, Ningyu; Han, Yanxing; Jiang, Wei; Wang, Yanchang; Si, Shuyi; Jiang, Jiandong\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCapreomycin is a second-line drug for multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). However, with increased use in clinics, the therapeutic efficiency of capreomycin is decreasing. To better understand TB resistance to capreomycin, we have done research to identify the molecular target of capreomycin. Mycobacterium tuberculosis ribosomal proteins L12 and L10 interact with each other and constitute the stalk of the 50S ribosomal subunit, which recruits initiation and elongation factors during translation. Hence, the L12-L10 interaction is considered to be essential for ribosomal function and protein synthesis. Here we provide evidence showing that capreomycin inhibits the L12-L10 interaction by using an established L12-L10 interaction assay. Overexpression of L12 and/or L10 in M. smegmatis, a species close to M. tuberculosis, increases the MIC of capreomycin. Moreover, both elongation factor G-dependent GTPase activity and ribosome-mediated protein synthesis are inhibited by capreomycin. When protein synthesis was blocked with thiostrepton, however, the bactericidal activity of capreomycin was restrained. All of these results suggest that capreomycin seems to inhibit TB by interrupting the L12-L10 interaction. This finding might provide novel clues for anti-TB drug discovery.\n\nStructural basis for the interaction of antibiotics with peptidyl transferase center in eubacteria\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchlunzen, Frank; Zarivach, Raz; Harms, JÃ¶rg\n\n2009-10-07\n\nRibosomes, the site of protein synthesis, are a major target for natural and synthetic antibiotics. Detailed knowledge of antibiotic binding sites is central to understanding the mechanisms of drug action. Conversely, drugs are excellent tools for studying the ribosome function. To elucidate the structural basis of ribosome-antibiotic interactions, we determined the high-resolution X-ray structures of the 50S ribosomal subunit of the eubacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, complexed with the clinically relevant antibiotics chloramphenicol, clindamycin and the three macrolides erythromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin. We found that antibiotic binding sites are composed exclusively of segments of 23S ribosomal RNA at the peptidyl transferase cavitymoreÂ Â» and do not involve any interaction of the drugs with ribosomal proteins. Here we report the details of antibiotic interactions with the components of their binding sites. Our results also show the importance of putative Mg{sup +2} ions for the binding of some drugs. This structural analysis should facilitate rational drug design.Â«Â less\n\nTargeting FOXM1 Improves Cytotoxicity of Paclitaxel and Cisplatinum in Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nWesthoff, Gina L; Chen, Yi; Teng, Nelson N H\n\n2017-10-01\n\nAberrantly activated FOXM1 (forkhead box protein M1) leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and dysregulation of FOXM1 transcription network occurs in 84% of ovarian cancer cases. It was demonstrated that thiostrepton, a thiazole antibiotic, decreases FOXM1 expression. We aimed to determine if targeting the FOXM1 pathway with thiostrepton could improve the efficacy of paclitaxel and cisplatin in human ovarian cancer ascites cells ex vivo. Human ovarian cancer cell lines and patients' ascites cells were treated with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and thiostrepton or a combination for 48 hours, and cytotoxicity was assessed. Drug combination effects were determined by calculating the combination index values using the Chou and Talalay method. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine changes in FOXM1 expression and its downstream targets. Ovarian cancer cell lines and the patients' ascites cancer cells had an overexpression of FOXM1 expression levels. Targeting FOXM1 with thiostrepton decreased FOXM1 mRNA expression and its downstream targets such as CCNB1 and CDC25B, leading to cell death in both cell lines and patients' ascites cancer cells. Furthermore, addition of thiostrepton to paclitaxel and cisplatin showed synergistic effects in chemoresistant ovarian cancer patients' ascites cells ex vivo. Targeting FOXM1 may lead to novel therapeutics for chemoresistant epithelial ovarian cancer.\n\nUsing interactive family science shows to improve public knowledge on antibiotic resistance: does it work?\n\nPubMed\n\nLecky, Donna M; Hawking, Meredith K D; Verlander, Neville Q; McNulty, Cliodna A M\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe public plays an important role in controlling the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. A large British survey showed that there is still public misunderstanding about microbes and antibiotics. e-Bug, a European DG Sanco sponsored project, aims to disseminate a school antibiotic and hygiene educational pack and website across Europe. Interactive science shows based on the e-Bug educational packs were developed to take the key health and hygiene messages from the e-Bug school resources to families. The science show was evaluated to assess public knowledge and understanding of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance pre and post intervention. An interactive stall comprised of a 3Ã2 m backing stand with background information, an interactive activity and discussions with a trained demonstrator was on display at a family holiday resort. Pre-piloted knowledge questionnaires were completed by parents and children pre and post intervention. Adult (â¥19 years) baseline knowledge regarding antibiotics and antibiotic resistance was high although significant knowledge improvement was observed where baseline knowledge was low. Children's (5-11 years) knowledge around antibiotics and antibiotic resistance was significantly improved for all questions. The science show can be viewed as a success in improving parents' and children's knowledge of antibiotic use thereby highlighting the importance of educating the public through interaction.\n\nSurface mediated cooperative interactions of drugs enhance mechanical forces for antibiotic action\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNdieyira, Joseph W.; Bailey, Joe; Patil, Samadhan B.; VÃ¶gtli, Manuel; Cooper, Matthew A.; Abell, Chris; McKendry, Rachel A.; Aeppli, Gabriel\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe alarming increase of pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics is now recognized as a major health issue fuelling demand for new drugs. Bacterial resistance is often caused by molecular changes at the bacterial surface, which alter the nature of specific drug-target interactions. Here, we identify a novel mechanism by which drug-target interactions in resistant bacteria can be enhanced. We examined the surface forces generated by four antibiotics; vancomycin, ristomycin, chloroeremomycin and oritavancin against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant targets on a cantilever and demonstrated significant differences in mechanical response when drug-resistant targets are challenged with different antibiotics although no significant differences were observed when using susceptible targets. Remarkably, the binding affinity for oritavancin against drug-resistant targets (70ânM) was found to be 11,000 times stronger than for vancomycin (800âÎ¼M), a powerful antibiotic used as the last resort treatment for streptococcal and staphylococcal bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Using an exactly solvable model, which takes into account the solvent and membrane effects, we demonstrate that drug-target interactions are strengthened by pronounced polyvalent interactions catalyzed by the surface itself. These findings further enhance our understanding of antibiotic mode of action and will enable development of more effective therapies.\n\nIn vitro interactions of Peucedanum officinale essential oil with antibiotics.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiladinoviÄ, Dragoljub L; IliÄ, Budimir S; KociÄ, Branislava D; MiladinoviÄ, Ljiljana C; MarkoviÄ, Marija S\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Peucedanum officinale L. (Apiaceae) essential oil were examined, as well as the association between it and antibiotics: tetracycline, streptomycin and chloramphenicol. The interactions of the essential oil with antibiotics were evaluated using the microdilution checkerboard assay. Monoterpene hydrocarbons, with Î±-phellandrene as the dominant constituent, were the most abundant compound class of the essential oil of P. officinale. The researched essential oil exhibited slight antibacterial activity against the tested bacterial strains in vitro. On the contrary, essential oil of P. officinale possesses a great synergistic potential with chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Their combinations reduced the minimum effective dose of the antibiotic and, consequently, minimised its adverse side effects. In addition, investigated interactions are especially successful against Gram-negative bacteria, the pharmacological treatment of which is very difficult nowadays.\n\nUsing Interactive Family Science Shows to Improve Public Knowledge on Antibiotic Resistance: Does It Work?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLecky, Donna M.; Hawking, Meredith K.

In this study, Pharmacodynamic interactions between silver nanoparticle (SNP) and topical antibiotics such as Cefazolin (CEF), Mupirocin (MUP), Gentamycin (GEN), Neomycin (NEO), Tetracycline (TET), Vancomycin (VAN) were investigated using the MIC test, Combination assay followed by Fractional Inhibitory concentration Index and Agar well diffusion method.

In addition, we elucidated the possible mechanism involved in the pharmacodynamic interaction between SNP-topical antibiotics by increased ROS level, membrane damage following protein release, K(+) leakage and biofilm inhibition. Thus, our findings support that conjugation of the SNP with topical antibiotics have great potential in the topical formulation when treating complex resistant bacterial infections and where there is a need of more concentration to kill pathogenic bacteria.\n\nElucidating pharmacodynamic interaction of silver nanoparticle - topical deliverable antibiotics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nThirumurugan, G.; Seshagiri Rao, J.

Many classes of clinically useful antibiotics bind to the ribosome to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin B (MLSB) antibiotics form one of the largest groups, and bind to the same site on the 50S ribosomal subunit. Here, we review the molecular details of the ribosomal MLSB site to put into perspective the main points from a wealth of biochemical and genetic data that have been collected over several decades. The information is now available to understand, at atomic resolution, how macrolide antibiotics interact with their ribosomal target, how the target is altered to confer resistance, and in which directions we need to look if we are to rationally design better drugs to overcome the extant resistance mechanisms.\n\nInsights in Nanoparticle-Bacterium Interactions: New Frontiers to Bypass Bacterial Resistance to Antibiotics.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiab, Roudayna; Khameneh, Bahman; Joubert, Olivier; Duval, Raphael\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNanotechnology has been revealed as a fundamental approach for antibiotics delivery. In this paper, recent findings demonstrating the superiority of nanocarried-antibiotics over \"naked\" ones and the ways by which nanoparticles can help to overwhelm bacterial drug resistance are reviewed. The second part of this paper sheds light on nanoparticle-bacterium interaction patterns. Finally, key factors affecting the effectiveness of nanoparticles interactions with bacteria are discussed.\n\nOil shale powders and their interactions with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and oxytetracycline antibiotics.\n\nPubMed\n\nGouza, Asmae; Saoiabi, Sanaa; El Karbane, Miloud; Masse, Sylvie; Laurent, Guillaume; Rami, Ahmed; Saoiabi, Ahmed; Laghzizil, Abdelaziz; Coradin, Thibaud\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe interaction of oil shale, as a widespread sedimentary rock, with common antibiotics ofloxacine, oxytetracycline, and ciprofloxacine was studied. The selected Moroccan deposit and its thermally treated forms were fully characterized from a chemical and structural point of view, indicating the prevalence of quartz as a mineral component together with aluminum- and iron-rich phase that are converted into Al-doped iron oxide phases upon heating. The presence of 4Â wt% organics was also detected, which was removed at 550Â Â°C without significant loss of specific surface area. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir equation were found the most adequate to reproduce the kinetics and isothermal sorption experiments. These analyses enlighten the contribution of the organic matter on antibiotic retention as well as the key role of hydrophobic interactions on the molecule-mineral surface interactions. Our results emphasize the possible contribution of raw oil shale in the accumulation of antibiotics in soils and suggest that thermally treated oil shell powders can constitute cheap mineral sorbents for environmental cleaning.\n\nAntimicrobial activity of human pancreatic juice and its interaction with antibiotics.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMinelli, E B; Benini, A; Bassi, C; Abbas, H; Falconi, M; Locatelli, F; de Marco, R; Pederzoli, P\n\n1996-01-01\n\nPancreatic juice (PJ) should be a factor of variability in the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics eliminated by the pancreas during pancreatic infections. We studied its effects on the activity of antimicrobial drugs with different mechanisms of action. Samples of pure PJ were collected from 16 patients with stabilized external pancreatic fistulas. The antimicrobial activity of the juice at different concentrations (from 1.25 to 100%) alone and in combination with mezlocillin, imipenem, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin was studied by a microbiological method (continuous turbidimetric recording of bacterial growth). The human PJ showed dose-dependent antimicrobial activity that increased directly with the concentration. The activity of the antibiotics at bactericidal concentrations were not modified by the PJ, while the combination with subinhibitory concentrations produced the following variable and different effects: (i) additivity with mezlocillin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin and autonomy (no interaction) with imipenem and ofloxacin against Providencia rettgeri and (ii) additivity with ceftriaxone, ofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, and mezlocillin and autonomy with ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli. In the presence of PJ, fluoroquinolones showed constant positive effects, while beta-lactams showed more variable antimicrobial activity. Antibiotic concentrations and PJ pharmacodynamics are the main factors determining the final effect of the interaction in vitro. These results may be useful in choosing antibiotics for the treatment of pancreatic infections when they are supplemented with the pharmacokinetic data for each drug.

By combining experimental evolution and genome sequencing of 63 laboratory-evolved lines, we charted a map of cross-resistance interactions between antibiotics in Escherichia coli, and explored the driving evolutionary principles. Here, we show that (1) convergent molecular evolution is prevalent across antibiotic treatments, (2) resistance conferring mutations simultaneously enhance sensitivity to many other drugs and (3) 27% of the accumulated mutations generate proteins with compromised activities, suggesting that antibiotic adaptation can partly be achieved without gain of novel function. By using knowledge on antibiotic properties, we examined the determinants of cross-resistance and identified chemogenomic profile similarity between antibiotics as the strongest predictor. In contrast, cross-resistance between two antibiotics is independent of whether they show synergistic effects in combination. These results have important implications on the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Inpatient gynecologic and gastroenterologic service at a university medical center. Three groups of 20 ASA physical status I and II patients with normal kidney and liver function, taking no medication, and undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and alfentanil intravenously (IV) and maintained with a propofol infusion and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Pipecuronium bromide 50 micrograms/kg was administered after reaching a stable baseline of single-twitch response. At 25% recovery of pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, patients received one of two antibiotics, clindamycin 300 mg or colistin 1 million IU, or a placebo. The recovery index (RI, defined as time from 25% to 75% recovery of neuromuscular blockade) was measured using the single-twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle with supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. RI after administration of an antibiotic (given at 25% recovery) was measured and compared with RI of the control group using Student's unpaired t-test. Statistical analyses of the results showed a significant prolongation of the recovery time (from 25% to 75% recovery) of 40 minutes for colistin. When this type of antibiotic is used during anesthesia with pipercuronium as a muscle relaxant, one must be aware of a significant prolongation of an already long-acting neuromuscular blockade and (although not observed in this study) possible problems in antagonism.\n\nDrug interactions between non-rifamycin antibiotics and hormonal contraception: aÂ systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimmons, Katharine B; Haddad, Lisa B; Nanda, Kavita; Curtis, Kathryn M\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether interactions between non-rifamycin antibiotics and hormonal contraceptives result in decreased effectiveness or increased toxicity of either therapy. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane libraries from database inception through June 2016. We included trials, cohort, case-control, and pharmacokinetic studies in any language that addressed pregnancy rates, pharmacodynamics, or pharmacokinetic outcomes when any hormonal contraceptive and non-rifamycin antibiotic were administered together vs apart. Of 7291 original records that were identified, 29 met criteria for inclusion. Two authors independently assessed study quality and risk of bias using the United States Preventive Services Task Force evidence grading system. Findings were tabulated by drug class. Study quality ranged from good to poor and addressed only oral contraceptive pills, emergency contraception pills, and the combined vaginal ring. Two studies demonstrated no difference in pregnancy rates in women who used oral contraceptives with and without non-rifamycin antibiotics. No differences in ovulation suppression or breakthrough bleeding were observed in any study that combined hormonal contraceptives with any antibiotic. No significant decreases in any progestin pharmacokinetic parameter occurred during co-administration with any antibiotic. Ethinyl estradiol area under the curve decreased when administered with dirithromycin, but no other drug. Evidence from clinical and pharmacokinetic outcomes studies does not support the existence of drug interactions between hormonal contraception and non-rifamycin antibiotics. Data are limited by low quantity and quality for some drug classes. Most women can expect no reduction in hormonal contraceptive effect with the concurrent use of non-rifamycin antibiotics.

HILIC can be used as a valuable alternative LC mode for separating small polar compounds. Polar samples usually show good solubility in the mobile phase containing some water used in HILIC, which overcomes the drawbacks of the poor solubility often encountered in normal phase LC. HILIC is suitable for analyzing compounds in complex systems that elute near the void in reversed-phase chromatography. Ion-pair reagents are not required in HILIC which makes it convenient to couple with MS hence its increased popularity in recent years. In this review, the retention mechanism in HILIC is briefly discussed and a list of important applications is provided including main experimental conditions and a brief summary of the results. The references provide a comprehensive overview and insight into the application of HILIC in antibiotics analysis. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of the cation-pi interaction in sorption of fluoroquinolone antibiotics by pyrogenic carbonaceous materials (PCMs) has not been addressed. We studied sorption of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on graphite to quantify the contribution of the cation-pi interaction. Through competition experiments, the decreased amount of sorbed CIP by sequential treatment with hexadecane, phenanthrene and benzylamine represents the contribution of hydrophobic, pi-pi and cation-pi interactions, respectively. Benzylamine competed more strongly with CIP than n-hexadecane and phenanthrene, indicating that cation-pi is a major force. Cation-pi interactions accounted for up to 72.6% of the total sorption at an initial CIP concentration of 0.000015 mmol/L. Importantly, species transformation (CIP(0) captures H + from water to form CIP(+1)) induced by cation-pi interactions was verified both experimentally and theoretically and can be used to explain the environmental behavior of other fluoroquinolone antibiotics and biochemical processes of amino acids that interact with aromatic moieties. Because of the significant role of cation-pi interactions, CIP desorption increased up to 2.32 times when Na + increased from 0.01 mM to 0.45 mM, which is an environmentally relevant scenario at river estuaries. Hence, behaviors of fluoroquinolone antibiotics that are affected by ionic strength changes need to be carefully evaluated, especially in river estuaries.\n\nInteraction of Antibiotics with Innate Host Defense Factors against Salmonella enterica Serotype Newport\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKumaraswamy, Monika; Kousha, Armin; Nizet, Victor\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT This study examines the pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials that are used to treat Salmonella with each other and with key components of the innate immune system. Antimicrobial synergy was assessed using time-kill and checkerboard assays. Antimicrobial interactions with innate immunity were studied by employing cathelicidin LL-37, whole-blood, and neutrophil killing assays. Ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin were found to be synergistic in vitro against Salmonella enterica serotype Newport. Ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and azithromycin each demonstrated synergy with the human cathelicidin defense peptide LL-37 in killing Salmonella. Exposure of Salmonella to sub-MICs of ceftriaxone resulted in enhanced susceptibility to LL-37, whole blood, and neutrophil killing. The activity of antibiotics in vivo against Salmonella may be underestimated in bacteriologic media lacking components of innate immunity. The pharmacodynamic interactions of antibiotics used to treat Salmonella with each other and with components of innate immunity warrant further study in light of recent findings showing in vivo selection of antimicrobial resistance by single agents in this pathogen. IMPORTANCE It is becoming increasingly understood that the current paradigms of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing may have significant shortcomings in predicting activity in vivo. This study evaluated the activity of several antibiotics alone and in combination against clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serotype Newport (meningitis case) utilizing both conventional and physiological media. In addition, the interactions of these antibiotics with components of the innate immune system were evaluated. Azithromycin, which has performed quite well clinically despite high MICs in conventional media, was shown to be more active in physiological media and to enhance innate immune system killing. Alternatively, chloramphenicol did not show enhanced immune system killing, paralleling its inferior\n\nModification of Escherichia coliâbacteriophage interactions by surfactants and antibiotics in vitro\n\nPubMed Central\n\nScanlan, Pauline D.; Bischofberger, Anna M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Although experiments indicate that the abiotic environment plays an important role in bacterial interactions with their parasitic viruses (bacteriophages or phages), it is not yet clear how exposure to compounds present in nature alters the impact of phages on bacterial growth and evolution. To address this question, we exposed Escherichia coli K12 MG1655, in combination with three lytic phages, to various substances that natural and clinical microbial populations are likely to encounter: bile salts (present in mammalian gastrointestinal tracts), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, a common surfactant in cleaning and hygiene products) and four antibiotics (present at variable concentrations in natural and clinical environments). Our results show that bile salts and SDS can reduce the detrimental effect of phages on bacterial growth. In some cases these compounds completely mitigated any negative effects of phages on bacterial growth and consequently bacteria did not evolve resistance to phages in these conditions. The proportional effects of phages were unaffected by antibiotics in most combinations, excepting three cases of phage-drug synergy. These results suggest that accounting for interactions between phages and environmental factors such as surfactants and antibiotics will improve understanding of both bacterial growth and resistance evolution to phages in vivo and in nature.

In the checkerboard method, synergy of 45.8% was observed, being independent of Gram reaction, with combinations in the aqueous extract yielding largely (18.8%) antagonistic interactions. The time-kill assay detected synergy (45.8%) that was also independent of Gram reaction with a potentiation of more than 3 orders of the bactericidal activity of the test antibiotics. The crude leaf extracts of H. pedunculatum could thus be considered to be potential source of a broad-spectrum antibiotic-resistance-modifying compounds.\n\nActivity and interactions of antibiotic and phytochemical combinations against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJayaraman, Premkumar; Sakharkar, Meena K; Lim, Chu Sing; Tang, Thean Hock; Sakharkar, Kishore R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn this study the in vitro activities of seven antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, tetracycline, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, polymyxin B and piperacillin) and six phytochemicals (protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, ellagic acid, rutin, berberine and myricetin) against five P. aeruginosa isolates, alone and in combination are evaluated. All the phytochemicals under investigation demonstrate potential inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa. The combinations of sulfamethoxazole plus protocatechuic acid, sulfamethoxazole plus ellagic acid, sulfamethoxazole plus gallic acid and tetracycline plus gallic acid show synergistic mode of interaction. However, the combinations of sulfamethoxazole plus myricetin shows synergism for three strains (PA01, DB5218 and DR3062). The synergistic combinations are further evaluated for their bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa ATCC strain using time-kill method. Sub-inhibitory dose responses of antibiotics and phytochemicals individually and in combination are presented along with their interaction network to suggest on the mechanism of action and potential targets for the phytochemicals under investigation. The identified synergistic combinations can be of potent therapeutic value against P. aeruginosa infections. These findings have potential implications in delaying the development of resistance as the antibacterial effect is achieved with lower concentrations of both drugs (antibiotics and phytochemicals).

The increasingly common spread of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella spp. is a major public healthcare issue worldwide. In this study, we wished to explore (1) antibiotic or polypeptide combinations to inhibit multidrug-resistant Salmonella bredeney and (2) the regulation of cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity of antibiotics and polypeptides. We undertook a study to select antibiotic combinations. Then, we promoted drug-resistant strains of S. bredeney after 15 types of antibiotic treatment. From each evolving population, the S. bredeney strain was exposed to a particular single drug. Then, we analyzed how the evolved S. bredeney strains acquired resistance or susceptibility to other drugs. A total of 105 combinations were tested against S. bredeney following the protocols of CLSI-2016 and EUCAST-2017. The synergistic interactions between drug pairings were diverse. Notably, polypeptides were more likely to be linked to synergistic combinations: 56% (19/34) of the synergistic pairings were relevant to polypeptides. Simultaneously, macrolides demonstrated antagonism toward polypeptides. The latter were more frequently related to collateral sensitivity than the other drugs because the other 13 drugs sensitized S. bredeney to polypeptides. In an experimental evolution involving 15 drugs, single drug-evolved strains were examined against the other 14 drugs, and the results were compared with the minimal inhibitory concentration of the ancestral strain. Single drug-evolved S. bredeney strains could alter the sensitivity to other drugs, and S. bredeney evolution against antibiotics could sensitize it to polypeptides.\n\nComputational analysis of structure-based interactions and ligand properties can predict efflux effects on antibiotics.\n\nPubMed\n\nSarkar, Aurijit; Anderson, Kelcey C; Kellogg, Glen E\n\n2012-06-01\n\nAcrA-AcrB-TolC efflux pumps extrude drugs of multiple classes from bacterial cells and are a leading cause for antimicrobial resistance. Thus, they are of paramount interest to those engaged in antibiotic discovery. Accurate prediction of antibiotic efflux has been elusive, despite several studies aimed at this purpose. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratios of 32 Î²-lactam antibiotics were collected from literature. 3-Dimensional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship on the Î²-lactam antibiotic structures revealed seemingly predictive models (q(2)=0.53), but the lack of a general superposition rule does not allow its use on antibiotics that lack the Î²-lactam moiety. Since MIC ratios must depend on interactions of antibiotics with lipid membranes and transport proteins during influx, capture and extrusion of antibiotics from the bacterial cell, descriptors representing these factors were calculated and used in building mathematical models that quantitatively classify antibiotics as having high/low efflux (>93% accuracy). Our models provide preliminary evidence that it is possible to predict the effects of antibiotic efflux if the passage of antibiotics into, and out of, bacterial cells is taken into account--something descriptor and field-based QSAR models cannot do. While the paucity of data in the public domain remains the limiting factor in such studies, these models show significant improvements in predictions over simple LogP-based regression models and should pave the path toward further work in this field. This method should also be extensible to other pharmacologically and biologically relevant transport proteins. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The reported increase of pneumococcal meningitis from 2001 to 2009 in France, where a national campaign to reduce antibiotic use was implemented in parallel to the introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine, provides unique data to assess these effects. We constructed a mechanistic pneumococcal transmission model and used likelihood to assess the ability of competing hypotheses to explain that increase. We find that a model integrating a fitness cost of penicillin resistance successfully explains the overall and age-stratified pattern of serotype replacement. By simulating counterfactual scenarios of public health interventions in France, we propose that this fitness cost caused a gradual and pernicious interaction between the two interventions by increasing the spread of nonvaccine, penicillin-susceptible strains. More generally, our results indicate that reductions of antibiotic use may counteract the benefits of conjugate vaccines introduced into countries with low vaccine-serotype coverages and high-resistance frequencies. Our findings highlight the key role of antibiotic use in vaccine-induced serotype replacement and suggest the need for more integrated approaches to control pneumococcal infections.\n\nInfluence of Space Flight Factors on the Genetic Properties of Streptomyces Lividans 66 (PIJ702)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTabakov, V.

Strain S. lividans 66 harbors the multicopy plasmid pIJ702 with selective and differential marker genes for antibiotic thiostrepton resistance and melanin production. Culture plates of modified ISP agar medium with and without thiostrepton were flown on Foton-M2. Suboptimal flight temperatures, which were simulated for asynchronous ground controls, resulted in slow growth and failure to differentiate and sporulate. Flight samples and asynchronous controls showed a high frequency of failing to express plasmid markers compared to laboratory controls. This was associated with loss of plasmid DNA and likely resulted from suboptimal temperatures for flight cultures and controls. Neither restriction fragment length polymorphism, nor polymerase chain reaction amplification coupled with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, revealed differences between pIJ702 DNA from flight vs. control clones. Mutations of the plasmid marker genes resulting from specific spaceflight factors, e.g., microgravity and radiation, were not detected.\n\nInhibition by Siomycin and Thiostrepton of Both Aminoacyl-tRNA and Factor G Binding to Ribosomes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLl, Juan Modole; Cabrer, BartolomÃ©; Parmeggiani, Andrea; Azquez, David V\n\n1971-01-01\n\nSiomycin, a peptide antibiotic that interacts with the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits binding of factor G, is shown also to inhibit binding of aminoacyl-tRNA; however, it does not impair binding of fMet-tRNA and completion of the initiation complex. Moreover, unlike other inhibitors of aminoacyl-tRNA binding (tetracycline, sparsomycin, and streptogramin A), siomycin completely abolishes the GTPase activity associated with the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA catalyzed by factor Tu. A single-site interaction of siomycin appears to be responsible for its effect on both the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA-Tu-GTP complex and that of factor G.

High prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria among bacteria-based infections decreases effectiveness of current treatments and causes thousands of deaths. New improvements in present methods and novel strategies are urgently needed to cope with this problem. Owing to their antibacterial activities, metallic nanoparticles represent an effective solution for overcoming bacterial resistance. However, metallic nanoparticles are toxic, which causes restrictions in their use. Recent studies have shown that combining nanoparticles with antibiotics not only reduces the toxicity of both agents towards human cells by decreasing the requirement for high dosages but also enhances their bactericidal properties. Combining antibiotics with nanoparticles also restores their ability to destroy bacteria that have acquired resistance to them. Furthermore, nanoparticles tagged with antibiotics have been shown to increase the concentration of antibiotics at the site of bacterium-antibiotic interaction, and to facilitate binding of antibiotics to bacteria. Likewise, combining nanoparticles with antimicrobial peptides and essential oils generates genuine synergy against bacterial resistance. In this article, we aim to summarize recent studies on interactions between nanoparticles and antibiotics, as well as other antibacterial agents to formulate new prospects for future studies. Based on the promising data that demonstrated the synergistic effects of antimicrobial agents with nanoparticles, we believe that this combination is a potential candidate for more research into treatments for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nInteraction of Vaccination and Reduction of Antibiotic Use Drives Unexpected Increase of Pneumococcal Meningitis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde CellÃ¨s, Matthieu Domenech; Pons-Salort, Margarita; Varon, Emmanuelle; Vibet, Marie-Anne; Ligier, Caroline; Letort, VÃ©ronique; Opatowski, Lulla; Guillemot, Didier\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAntibiotic-use policies may affect pneumococcal conjugate-vaccine effectiveness.

However, benefits offered by these magic bullets have been substantially lost in subsequent days following the widespread emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant strains. While it is obvious that excessive and imprudent use of antibiotics significantly contributes to the emergence of resistant strains, antibiotic resistance is also observed in natural bacteria of remote places unlikely to be impacted by human intervention. Both antibiotic biosynthetic genes and resistance-conferring genes have been known to evolve billions of years ago, long before clinical use of antibiotics. Hence it appears that antibiotics and antibiotics resistance determinants have some other roles in nature, which often elude our attention because of overemphasis on the therapeutic importance of antibiotics and the crisis imposed by the antibiotic resistance in pathogens. In the natural milieu, antibiotics are often found to be present in sub-inhibitory concentrations acting as signaling molecules supporting the process of quorum sensing and biofilm formation. They also play an important role in the production of virulence factors and influence hostâparasite interactions (e.g., phagocytosis, adherence to the target cell, and so on). The evolutionary and ecological aspects of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in the naturally occurring microbial community are little understood. Therefore, the actual role of antibiotics in nature warrants in-depth investigations. Studies on such an intriguing behavior of the microorganisms promise insight into the intricacies of the microbial physiology and are likely to provide some lead in controlling the emergence and subsequent dissemination of antibiotic resistance.

Nocathiacins are a thiazolyl peptide group of antibiotics, are structurally related to thiostrepton, have potent activity against a wide spectrum of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, and inhibit protein synthesis. The in vitro growth inhibition assay was done using three laboratory strains of P. falciparum displaying various levels of chloroquine (CQ) susceptibility. Our results indicate that BMS461996 has potent antimalarial activity and inhibits parasite growth with mean 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 51.55 nM for P. falciparum 3D7 (CQ susceptible), 85.67 nM for P. falciparum Dd2 (accelerated resistance to multiple drugs [ARMD]), and 99.44 nM for P. falciparum K1 (resistant to CQ, pyrimethamine, and sulfadoxine). Similar results at approximately 7-fold higher IC50s were obtained with BMS411886 than with BMS461996. We also tested the effect of BMS491996 on gametocytes; our results show that at a 20-fold excess of the mean IC50, gametocytes were deformed with a pyknotic nucleus and growth of stage I to IV gametocytes was arrested. This preliminary study shows a significant potential for nocathiacin analogues to be developed as antimalarial drug candidates and to warrant further investigation.

Accordingly, blood concentrations of other drugs increase with clarithromycin coprescription leading to adverse events. These macrolide antibiotics also differ on other properties that may impact outcomes. In this study, we compared outcomes in two groups of macrolide antibiotic users in the absence of potentially interacting drugs. Design Population-based retrospective cohort study. Setting Ontario, Canada, from 2003 to 2010. Patients Patients (mean 74â years) prescribed clarithromycin (n=52â 251) or azithromycin (referent group, n=46â 618). Main outcomes The primary outcomes were hospital admission within 30â days of a new antibiotic prescription with any of the 12 conditions examined separately (acute kidney injury, acute myocardial infarction, neuroimaging (proxy for delirium), hypotension, syncope, hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperglycaemia, arrhythmia, ischaemic stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding and sepsis). The secondary outcome was mortality. Results The baseline characteristics of the two groups, including patient demographics, comorbid conditions, infection type and prescribing physician specialty, were nearly identical. The median daily dose was 1000â mg for clarithromycin and 300â mg for azithromycin and the median duration of dispensing antibiotics was 10 and 5â days, respectively. There was no difference between the groups in the risk of hospitalisation for any condition studied (relative risk ranged from 0.67 to 1.23). Compared with azithromycin, clarithromycin was associated with a slightly higher risk of all-cause mortality (0.46% vs 0.37%, relative risk 1.25, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.52). Conclusions Clarithromycin can be used to assess drug interactions in population-based studies with azithromycin serving as a control group. However, any differences in mortality observed between the two\n\nCounteraction of antibiotic production and degradation stabilizes microbial communities\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKelsic, Eric D.; Zhao, Jeffrey; Vetsigian, Kalin; Kishony, Roy\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSummary A major challenge in theoretical ecology is understanding how natural microbial communities support species diversity1-8, and in particular how antibiotic producing, sensitive and resistant species coexist9-15. While cyclic ârock-paper-scissorsâ interactions can stabilize communities in spatial environments9-11, coexistence in unstructured environments remains an enigma12,16. Here, using simulations and analytical models, we show that the opposing actions of antibiotic production and degradation enable coexistence even in well-mixed environments. Coexistence depends on 3-way interactions where an antibiotic degrading species attenuates the inhibitory interactions between two other species. These 3-way interactions enable coexistence that is robust to substantial differences in inherent species growth rates and to invasion by âcheatingâ species that cease producing or degrading antibiotics. At least two antibiotics are required for stability, with greater numbers of antibiotics enabling more complex communities and diverse dynamical behaviors ranging from stable fixed-points to limit cycles and chaos. Together, these results show how multi-species antibiotic interactions can generate ecological stability in both spatial and mixed microbial communities, suggesting strategies for engineering synthetic ecosystems and highlighting the importance of toxin production and degradation for microbial biodiversity.

The antibiotics of interest were the red-pigmented undecylprodigiosin and blue-pigmented actinorhodin. Pure cultures of S. coelicolor in a defined medium produced higher concentrations of actinorhodin compared to those of undecylprodigiosin. The latter however, is more important due to its immunosuppressive and antitumor properties. As a strategy to increase undecylprodigiosin production, we added separately, live cells and heat-killed cells of E. coli C600, and the cell-free supernatant of E. coli culture to S. coelicolor cultures in shake flasks. The interaction with live cells of E. coli altered the antibiotic production pattern and undecylprodigiosin production was enhanced by 3.5-fold compared to the pure cultures of S. coelicolor and actinorhodin decreased by 15-fold. The heat-killed cells of E. coli however, had no effect on antibiotic production. In all cases, growth and glucose consumption of S. coelicolor remained almost the same as those observed in the pure culture indicating that the changes in antibiotic production were not due to nutritional stress. Results with cell-free supernatant of E. coli culture indicated that the interaction between S. coelicolor and E. coli was mediated via diffusible molecule(s). Using a set of extraction procedures and agar-well diffusion bioassays, we isolated and preliminarily identified a class of compounds. For the preliminary verification, we added the compound which was the common chemical structural moiety in this class of compounds to the pure S. coelicolor cultures. We observed similar effects on antibiotic production as with the live E. coli cells and their supernatant indicating that this class of compounds secreted by E. coli indeed could act as actives during interspecies\n\nSynergistic interaction of Helichrysum pedunculatum leaf extracts with antibiotics against wound infection associated bacteria.\n\nPubMed\n\nAiyegoro, Olayinka A; Afolayan, Anthony J; Okoh, Anthony I\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe effect of combinations of the crude methanolic extract of the leaves of Helichrysum pedunculatum and eight first-line antibiotics were investigated by time kill assays against a panel of bacterial strains that have been implicated in wound infections. The plant extract showed appreciable antibacterial activities against the test bacteria with zones of inhibition ranging between 18 and 27 mm, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varying between 0.1 and 5.0 mg/ml. The MICs of the test antibiotics range between 0.001 and 0.412 mg/ml, and combination of the plant extract and the antibiotics resulted in reduction of bacterial counts by between 0 and 6.63 Log10 cfu/ml. At V2 MIC, 56.81% synergy; 43.19% indifference and no antagonism were observed, and at MIC levels, 55.68% synergy; 44.32% indifference and no antagonism were observed when the extracts were combined with eight different antibiotics. In all, 60% of the interactions were synergistic. All combination regimes on Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 yielded no synergy, neither was antagonism detected in any of the assays. We propose that extracts of the leaves of Helichrysum pedunculatum could be of relevance in combination therapy and as a source of resistance modifying principies that could be useful as treatment options for persistent wound infections.\n\nNon-optimal microbial response to antibiotics underlies suppressive drug interactions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBollenbach, Tobias; Quan, Selwyn; Chait, Remy; Kishony, Roy\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSUMMARY Antibiotics inhibiting translation can increase bacterial growth rate in the presence of DNA synthesis inhibitors. Here, we show that this extreme type of drug antagonism, termed suppression, results from non-optimal regulation of ribosomal genes, leading to sub-maximal growth in the presence of DNA stress. Using GFP-tagged transcription reporters in Escherichia coli, we find that ribosomal genes are not directly regulated by DNA stress, leading to an imbalance between cellular DNA and protein content. Sequential deletion of up to 6 of the 7 ribosomal RNA operons corrects this imbalance and leads to improved survival and growth under DNA synthesis inhibition. Further, this genetic manipulation completely removes the suppressive drug interaction. Mathematical modeling shows that non-optimal regulation of ribosome synthesis under DNA stress can be explained as a side-effect of optimal growth-rate-dependent regulation in different nutrient environments. Together, these results reveal the genetic mechanism underlying an important class of suppressive drug interactions.

In this context, the development of simple but physically meaningful mathematical models to represent the interaction between anti-HIV drugs and their biological targets is of major interest. One such area currently under investigation involves the targets in the HIV-RNA-packaging region. In the work described here, we applied Markov chain theory in an attempt to describe the interaction between the antibiotic paromomycin and the packaging region of the RNA in Type-1 HIV. In this model, a nucleic acid squeezed graph is used. The vertices of the graph represent the nucleotides while the edges are the phosphodiester bonds. A stochastic (Markovian) matrix was subsequently defined on this graph, an operation that codifies the probabilities of interaction between specific nucleotides of HIV-RNA and the antibiotic. The strength of these local interactions can be calculated through an inelastic vibrational model. The successive power of this matrix codifies the probabilities with which the vibrations after drug-RNA interactions vanish along the polynucleotide main chain. The sums of self-return probabilities in the k-vicinity of each nucleotide represent physically meaningful descriptors. A linear discriminant function was developed and gave rise to excellent discrimination in 80.8% of interacting and footprinted nucleotides. The Jackknife method was employed to assess the stability and predictability of the model. On the other hand, a linear regression model predicted the local binding affinity constants between a specific nucleotide and the antibiotic (R(2)=0.91, Q(2)=0.86). These kinds of models could play an important role either in the discovery of new anti-HIV compounds or the study of their mode of action.\n\n[Interaction Between Sulfonamide Antibiotics Fates and Chicken Manure Composting].\n\nPubMed\n\nLin, Hui; Wang, Jian-mei; Sun, Wan-chun; Fu, Jian-rong; Chen, Hong-jin; Ma, Jun-wei\n\n2016-05-15\n\nBased on aerobic manure composting with or without the addition of a mixture of sulfadimethoxine SM2 and sulfamonomethoxine SMM (1:1, m/m), changes in the physic-chemical properties of manure compost, the microbial community physiological profiles, the antibiotics concentration and the abundances of five antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during the composting were tracked. The results indicated that the introduction of sulfonamide antibiotics led to inhibition on the basal respiration of manure compost during the early composting period, delayed the formation of thermophilic temperature and reduced the conversion of nutrients such as organic matter, ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. Meanwhile, the introduction of sulfonamide antibiotics dramatically affected the physiological profile of microbial community in manure in the middle stage of composting. HPLC-MS/MS results showed that both SMM and SM2 in manure were completely degraded within 14 days, while the degradation rate of SMM was faster than that of SM2. For both composting treatments with or without addition of exogenous antibiotics, the relative abundance of sull and sul2 showed an initial decline in the first 14 or 21 days and a slight increase thereafter. The addition of exogenous antibiotics showed insignificant enhancement on increasing the relative abundance of sul1 and IntI1 in manure, but resulted in an apparent increase in sul2 relative abundance. Although the fates of tetQ and tetW during composting were different from that of sulfonamide ARGs, the introduction of sulfonamide antibiotics into manure increased the relative abundance of tetracycline ARGs. Redundancy analysis indicated that composting temperature correlated negatively with sul1, sul2 and IntI1 relative abundance in manure but had no obvious relationship with tetQ and tetW relative abundance. All the ARGs detected in this work correlated negatively with C/N ratio and the nitrate nitrogen concentration of manure compost but\n\nAntibiotic resistance shaping multi-level population biology of bacteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBaquero, Fernando; Tedim, Ana P.; Coque, Teresa M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAntibiotics have natural functions, mostly involving cell-to-cell signaling networks. The anthropogenic production of antibiotics, and its release in the microbiosphere results in a disturbance of these networks, antibiotic resistance tending to preserve its integrity.

Systematic reviews have highlighted factors that may influence antibiotic prescribing and that this is a complex process. It is unclear how factors interact and how the primary care organization affects diagnostic procedures and antibiotic prescribing. Therefore, we sought to explore and understand interactions between factors influencing antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections in primary care. Our mixed methods design was guided by the Triangulation Design Model according to Creswell. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in parallel. Quantitative data were collected by prescription statistics, questionnaires to patients, and general practitioners' audit registrations. Qualitative data were collected through observations and semi-structured interviews. From the analysis of the data from the different sources an overall theme emerged: A common practice in the primary health care centre is crucial for low antibiotic prescribing in line with guidelines. Several factors contribute to a common practice, such as promoting management and leadership, internalized guidelines including inter-professional discussions, the general practitioner's diagnostic process, nurse triage, and patient expectation. These factors were closely related and influenced each other. The results showed that knowledge must be internalized and guidelines need to be normative for the group as well as for every individual. Low prescribing is associated with adapted and transformed guidelines within all staff, not only general practitioners. Nurses' triage and self-care advice played an important role. Encouragement from the management level stimulated inter-professional discussions about antibiotic prescribing. Informal opinion moulders talking about antibiotic prescribing was supported by the managers. Finally, continuous professional development activities were encouraged\n\nGenetic Mechanisms of Antibiotic Resistance and the Role of Antibiotic Adjuvants.\n\nPubMed\n\nPontes, Daniela Santos; de Araujo, Rodrigo Santos Aquino; Dantas, Natalina; Scotti, Luciana; Scotti, Marcus Tullius; de Moura, Ricardo Olimpio; Mendonca-Junior, Francisco Jaime Bezerra\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe ever increasing number of multidrug-resistant microorganism pathogens has become a great and global public health threat. Antibiotic mechanisms of action and the opposing mechanisms of resistance are intimately associated, but comprehension of the biochemical and molecular functions of such drugs is not a simple exercise. Both the environment, and genetic settings contribute to alterations in phenotypic resistance (natural bacterial evolution), and make it difficult to control the emergence and impacts of antibiotic resistance. Under such circumstances, comprehension of how bacteria develop and/or acquire antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) has a critical role in developing propositions to fight against these superbugs, and to search for new drugs. In this review, we present and discuss both general information and examples of common genetic and molecular mechanisms related to antibiotic resistance, as well as how the expression and interactions of ARGs are important to drug resistance. At the same time, we focus on the recent achievements in the search for antibiotic adjuvants, which help combat antibiotic resistance through deactivation of bacterial mechanisms of action such as Î²-lactamases. Recent advances involving the use of anti-resistance drugs such as: efflux pump inhibitors; anti-virulence drugs; drugs against quorum sensing; and against type II/III secretion systems are revealed. Such antibiotic adjuvants (as explored herein) collaborate against the problems of antibiotic resistance, and may restore or prolong the therapeutic activity of known antibiotics.

We investigated the effectiveness of an antiseptic in two variations: octenidine (Oct) and octenidine+ (Oct+ with isotonic glucose addition). Using the agar diffusion test with cultures of pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus and the non-pathogenic Bordetella petrii, we compared the effectiveness of octenidine to the classical antiseptics beta-isodona (povidone-iodine; PI), chlorhexidine (Chl) and taurolin (Tau) alone, and in combination with various common antibiotics to uncover cooperativity between antiseptics and antibiotics. We detected strong interactions between antibiotics and antiseptics, that either enhanced or reduced the bactericidal efficiency. Effectiveness was dependent on the type of organism tested. Oct applied together with ineffective antibiotics frequently led to effective growth inhibition of Bordetella petrii. With Staphylococcus aureus we did not find such an effect. To this end, we reason that positively charged Oct may associate with antibiotic compounds via electrostatic interactions and guide it more efficiently to the bacterial cell wall. Interaction with antibiotics sometimes led to sequestration and reduced availability of some antiseptic/antibiotic combinations, but never with Oct. These data provide new arguments for decision planning concerning the choice of agent in the treatment of wound infections.\n\nAntibiotic-Resistant Gonorrhea\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

At the same time, evolution of antibiotic resistance is probably the best-documented case of contemporary evolution. To date, research on antibiotic resistance has largely ignored the complexity of interactions that bacteria engage in. However, in natural populations, bacteria interact with other species; for example, competition and grazing are import interactions influencing bacterial population dynamics. Furthermore, antibiotic leakage to natural environments can radically alter bacterial communities. Overall, we argue that eco-evolutionary feedback loops in microbial communities can be modified by residual antibiotics and evolution of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this review is to connect some of the well-established key concepts in evolutionary biology and recent advances in the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics to research on antibiotic resistance. We also identify some key knowledge gaps related to eco-evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance, and review some of the recent technical advantages in molecular microbiology that offer new opportunities for tackling these questions. Finally, we argue that using the full potential of evolutionary theory and active communication across the different fields is needed for solving this global crisis more efficiently.This article is part of the themed issue 'Human influences on evolution, and the ecological and societal consequences'.

CRD-BP is present in extremely low levels in normal adult tissues, but it is over-expressed in many types of aggressive human cancers and in neonatal tissues. Although the exact role of CRD-BP in tumour progression is unclear, cumulative evidence suggests that its ability to physically associate with target mRNAs is an important criterion for its oncogenic role. CRD-BP has high affinity for the 3â²UTR of the oncogenic CD44 mRNA and depletion of CRD-BP in cells led to destabilization of CD44 mRNA, decreased CD44 expression, reduced adhesion and disruption of invadopodia formation. Here, we further characterize the CRD-BP-CD44 RNA interaction and assess specific antisense oligonucleotides and small molecule antibiotics for their ability to inhibit the CRD-BP-CD44 RNA interaction. CRD-BP has a high affinity for binding to CD44 RNA nts 2862â3055 with a Kd of 645 nM. Out of ten antisense oligonucleotides spanning nts 2862â3055, only three antisense oligonucleotides (DD4, DD7 and DD10) were effective in competing with CRD-BP for binding to 32P-labeled CD44 RNA. The potency of DD4, DD7 and DD10 in inhibiting the CRD-BP-CD44 RNA interaction in vitro correlated with their ability to specifically reduce the steady-state level of CD44 mRNA in cells. The aminoglycoside antibiotics neomycin, paramomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin effectively inhibited the CRD-BP-CD44 RNA interaction in vitro. Assessing the potential inhibitory effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics including neomycin on the CRD-BP-CD44 mRNA interaction in cells proved difficult, likely due to their propensity to non-specifically bind nucleic acids. Our results have important implications for future studies in finding small molecules and nucleic acid-based inhibitors that interfere with protein-RNA interactions.
