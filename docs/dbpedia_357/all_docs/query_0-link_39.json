        "text": "Human Similarity Proteins of target is determined by comparing the sequence similarity of all human proteins with the target based on BLAST. The similarity proteins for a target are defined as the proteins with E-value < 0.005 and outside the protein families of the target.\n\nA target that has fewer human similarity proteins outside its family is commonly regarded to possess a greater capacity to avoid undesired interactions and thus increase the possibility of finding successful drugs (Brief Bioinform, 21: 649-662, 2020).\n\nHuman Tissue Distribution of target is determined from a proteomics study that quantified more than 12,000 genes across 32 normal human tissues. Tissue Specificity (TS) score was used to define the enrichment of target across tissues.\n\nThe distribution of targets among different tissues or organs need to be taken into consideration when assessing the target druggability, as it is generally accepted that the wider the target distribution, the greater the concern over potential adverse effects (Nat Rev Drug Discov, 20: 64-81, 2021).\n\nHuman Pathway Affiliation of target is determined by the life-essential pathways provided on KEGG database. The target-affiliated pathways were defined based on the following two criteria (a) the pathways of the studied target should be life-essential for both healthy individuals and patients, and (b) the studied target should occupy an upstream position in the pathways and therefore had the ability to regulate biological function.\n\nTargets involved in a fewer pathways have greater likelihood to be successfully developed, while those associated with more human pathways increase the chance of undesirable interferences with other human processes (Pharmacol Rev, 58: 259-279, 2006).\n\nBiological Network Descriptors of target is determined based on a human protein-protein interactions (PPI) network consisting of 9,309 proteins and 52,713 PPIs, which were with a high confidence score of ≥ 0.95 collected from STRING database.\n\nThe network properties of targets based on protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been widely adopted for the assessment of target’s druggability. Proteins with high node degree tend to have a high impact on network function through multiple interactions, while proteins with high betweenness centrality are regarded to be central for communication in interaction networks and regulate the flow of signaling information (Front Pharmacol, 9, 1245, 2018; Curr Opin Struct Biol. 44:134-142, 2017).\n\nHuman Similarity Proteins\n\nHuman Tissue Distribution\n\nHuman Pathway Affiliation\n\nBiological Network Descriptors"
