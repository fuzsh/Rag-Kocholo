A double bond was incorporated into the tetrahydroisoquinoline structure of 1 to be immobilized by a light induced hydrosilylation reaction on hydrogen-terminated Si(1 1 1). The best results were obtained employing a polar solvent (DMSO), rather than a non-polar solvent (toluene). The azide derivative 2 was grafted onto alkenyl-terminated silicon substrates with copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle goniometry (CA) and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) were used to demonstrate the incorporation of 1 and 2 into the surfaces, study the morphology of the modified surfaces and to calculate the yield of grafting and surface coverage. CA measurements showed the increase in the surface hydrophobicity when 1 or 2 were incorporated into the surface. Moreover, compounds 1 and 2 were prepared starting from 1-(p-nitrophenyl)tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 under smooth conditions and in good yields. The structures of 1 and 2 were designed with a reduced A-ring, two substituents at positions C-6 and C-7, an N-methyl group and a phenyl moiety at C-1 in order to provide a high affinity against dopaminergic receptors. Moreover, O-demethylation of 1 was carried out once it was adsorbed onto the surface by treatment with BBr{sub 3}.

The amides required for this purpose would result from reaction of aminoacetaldehyde dimethylacetal with different substituted benzenes in polyphosphoric acid, followed by acylation of the obtained amines with different acid chlorides or sulfochlorides. We compared the cyclisation step using conventional (milieu of acetic-trifluoracetic acid = 4:1 and solid supported reagents (SiO2/PPA, as recovered, regenerated and reused without loss of its activity catalyst. We found that in comparison to conventional methods, the yields of the reaction are greater and the reaction time is shorter.\n\nDesign, synthesis and biological evaluation of LBM-A5 derivatives as potent P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance inhibitors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWu, Yuxiang; Pan, Miaobo; Dai, Yuxuan; Liu, Baomin; Cui, Jian; Shi, Wei; Qiu, Qianqian; Huang, Wenlong; Qian, Hai\n\n2016-05-15\n\nA novel series of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) inhibitors with triazol-N-phenethyl-tetrahydroisoquinoline or triazol-N-ethyl-tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffold were designed and synthesized via click chemistry. Most of the synthesized compounds showed higher reversal activity than verapamil (VRP). Among them, the most potent compound 4 showed a comparable activity with the known potent P-gp inhibitor WK-X-34 with lower cytotoxicity toward K562 cells (IC50>100Î¼M). Compared with VRP, compound 4 exhibited more potency in increasing drug accumulation in K562/A02 MDR cells. Moreover, compound 4 could significantly reverse MDR in a dose-dependent manner and also persist longer chemo-sensitizing effect than VRP with reversibility. Further mechanism studies revealed that compound 4 could remarkably increase the intracellular accumulation of Adriamycin (ADM) in K562/A02 cells as well as inhibit rhodamine-123 (Rh123) efflux from the cells. These results suggested that compound 4 may represent a promising candidate for developing P-gp-mediated MDR inhibitors. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In our present work, we synthesized two organometallic gold(III) complexes harboring C^N ligands that structurally resemble tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ): Cyc-Au-1 (AuL 1 Cl 2 , L 1 = 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine) and Cyc-Au-2 (AuL 2 Cl 2 , L 2 = methylenedioxyphenethylamine). In screening their in vitro activity, we found both gold complexes exhibited lower toxicity, lower resistance factors, and better anticancer activity than those of cisplatin. The organometallic gold(III) complexes accumulate in mitochondria and induce elevated ROS and an ER stress response through mitochondrial dysfunction. These effects ultimately result in simultaneous apoptosis and autophagy. Importantly, compared to cisplatin, Cyc-Au-2 exhibits lower toxicity and better anticancer activity in a murine tumor model. To the best of our knowledge, Cyc-Au-2 is the first organometallic Au(III) compound that induces apoptosis and autophagic death. On the basis of our results, we believe Cyc-Au-2 to be a promising anticancer agent or lead compound for further anticancer drug development.\n\nDual Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Î±4Î²2 Antagonists/Î±7 Agonists: Synthesis, Docking Studies, and Pharmacological Evaluation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines and Tetrahydroisoquinolinium Salts\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nCrestey, FranÃ§ois; Jensen, Anders A; Soerensen, Christian\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe describe the synthesis of tetrahydroisoquinolines and tetrahydroisoquinolinium salts together with their pharmacological properties at various nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

This outcome suggests that the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline skeleton may be exploited as a template for the development of novel anticancer agents. In this article, we report the synthesis and chemical characterization of a new series of isosalsoline-type alkaloids (10â11 with variations at N2 and C3 positions with respect to the natural Compound 2, obtained by a synthetic strategy that involves the Bischler-Napieralski cyclization. The substrate for the condensation to the tetrahydroisoquinoline system, i.e., a functionalized Î²-arylethyl amine, was obtained through an original double reduction of nitroalkene. The synthetic strategy can be directed to the construction of highly substituted and functionalized 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines.\n\nSynthesis of substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines by lithiation then electrophilic quench.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTalk, Ruaa A; Duperray, Alexia; Li, Xiabing; Coldham, Iain\n\n2016-06-07\n\nSubstituted N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines were prepared and treated with n-butyllithium in THF at -50 Â°C to test the scope of the metallation and electrophilic quench. The lithiation was optimised by using in situ ReactIR spectroscopy and the rate of rotation of the carbamate was determined. The 1-lithiated intermediates could be trapped with a variety of electrophiles to give good yields of 1-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline products. Treatment with acid or reduction with LiAlH4 allows conversion to the N-H or N-Me compound. The chemistry was applied to the efficient total syntheses of the alkaloids (Â±)-crispine A and (Â±)-dysoxyline.\n\nDesign and synthesis of 4-heteroaryl 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines as triple reuptake inhibitors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, Shuang; Zha, Congxiang; Nacro, Kassoum; Hu, Min; Cui, Wenge; Yang, Yuh-Lin; Bhatt, Ulhas; Sambandam, Aruna; Isherwood, Matthew; Yet, Larry; Herr, Michael T; Ebeltoft, Sarah; Hassler, Carla; Fleming, Linda; Pechulis, Anthony D; Payen-Fornicola, Anne; Holman, Nicholas; Milanowski, Dennis; Cotterill, Ian; Mozhaev, Vadim; Khmelnitsky, Yuri; Guzzo, Peter R; Sargent, Bruce J; Molino, Bruce F; Olson, Richard; King, Dalton; Lelas, Snjezana; Li, Yu-Wen; Johnson, Kim; Molski, Thaddeus; Orie, Anitra; Ng, Alicia; Haskell, Roy; Clarke, Wendy; Bertekap, Robert; O'Connell, Jonathan; Lodge, Nicholas; Sinz, Michael; Adams, Stephen; Zaczek, Robert; Macor, John E\n\n2014-07-10\n\nA series of 4-bicyclic heteroaryl 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline inhibitors of the serotonin transporter (SERT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and dopamine transporter (DAT) was discovered. The synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs) will be discussed. Compound 10i (AMR-2), a very potent inhibitor of SERT, NET, and DAT, showed efficacy in the rat forced-swim and mouse tail suspension models with minimum effective doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg (po), respectively. At efficacious doses in these assays, 10i exhibited substantial occupancy levels at the three transporters in both rat and mouse brain. The study of the metabolism of 10i revealed the formation of a significant active metabolite, compound 13.\n\nConcise Redox Deracemization of Secondary and Tertiary Amines with a Tetrahydroisoquinoline Core via a Nonenzymatic Process.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJi, Yue; Shi, Lei; Chen, Mu-Wang; Feng, Guang-Shou; Zhou, Yong-Gui\n\n2015-08-26\n\nA concise deracemization of racemic secondary and tertiary amines with a tetrahydroisoquinoline core has been successfully realized by orchestrating a redox process consisted of N-bromosuccinimide oxidation and iridum-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. This compatible redox combination enables one-pot, single-operation deracemization to generate chiral 1-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines with up to 98% ee in 93% yield, offering a simple and scalable synthetic technique for chiral amines directly from racemic starting materials.\n\nQSAR of estrogen receptor modulators: exploring selectivity requirements for ER(alpha) versus ER(beta) binding of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives using E-state and physicochemical parameters.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMukherjee, Subhendu; Saha, Achintya; Roy, Kunal\n\n2005-02-15\n\nConsidering importance of developing selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), the present paper explores selectivity requirements of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives for binding with ER(alpha) versus ER(beta) receptors using E-state index and physicochemical parameters. The best model [n=21, Q(2)=0.512, R(a)(2)=0.613, R=0.819, F=11.6 (df 3,17)] for ER(alpha) binding data obtained from radioligand binding assay showed importance of C(1), C(15) and lipophilicity (logP) while the best model [n=21, Q(2)=0.768, R(a)(2)=0.796, R=0.904, F=40.1 (df 2,18)] for ER(beta) binding data showed importance of C(1) and molar refractivity (MR). While modeling ER(alpha)/ER(beta) selectivity [n=21, Q(2)=0.695, R(a)(2)=0.739, R=0.882, F=19.8 (df 3,17)], C(1), C(15) and molar refractivity were found to be significant contributors. The data obtained from cellular transcription assay were also modeled. In case of ER(alpha), the best equation involving E-state values of C(1) and C(14) and logP explained 62.1% of the variance while the best equation for ER(beta) involving E-state values of C(1) and C(15) and MR explained 64.6% of the variance of the response variable. In case of ER(alpha)/ER(beta) selectivity, the best equation involving E-state values of O(8), C(14) and N(27) showed 48.3% explained variance, which increased to 63.5% on deletion of single outlier. From the analysis it appears that the nitrogen atom of the aminoethoxyphenyl substituent and 6-hydroxy substituent of the tetrahydroisoquinoline nucleus play important roles for ER(alpha)/ER(beta) selectivity in addition to R(1) and R(2) substituents.\n\nAsymmetric Organocatalysis and Photoredox Catalysis for the Î±-Functionalization of Tetrahydroisoquinolines\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nHou, Hong\n\n2018-03-14\n\nThe asymmetric Î±âalkylation of tetrahydroisoquinolines with cyclic ketones has been accomplished in the presence of a combined catalytic system consisting of a visibleâlight photoredox catalyst and a chiral primary amine organocatalyst.

The imidazopyridine derivatives were found to have good potency and physical-chemical properties. Several highly potent compounds such as 8ji, 8jl, and 8jm were identified with single nanomolar activities. The most potent compound 8jm showed an IC50 of 3 nM, lower microsome clearance and no CYP inhibition. The profile of 8jm appeared to be superior to BMS433771, and supported further optimization.\n\n2-Arylbenzo[b]furan derivatives as potent human lipoxygenase inhibitors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLang, Li; Dong, Ningning; Wu, Deyan; Yao, Xue; Lu, Weiqiang; Zhang, Chen; Ouyang, Ping; Zhu, Jin; Tang, Yun; Wang, Wei; Li, Jian; Huang, Jin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHuman lipoxygenases (LOXs) have been emerging as effective therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases. In this study, we found that four natural 2-arylbenzo[b]furan derivatives isolated from Artocarpus heterophyllus exhibited potent inhibitory activities against human LOXs, including moracin C (1), artoindonesianin B-1 (2), moracin D (3), moracin M (4). In our in vitro experiments, compound 1 was identified as the most potent LOX inhibitor and the moderate subtype selective inhibitor of 12-LOX. Compounds 1 and 2 act as competitive inhibitors of LOXs. Moreover, 1 significantly inhibits LTB4 production and chemotactic capacity of neutrophils, and is capable of protecting vascular barrier from plasma leakage in vivo. In addition, the preliminary structure-activity relationship analysis was performed based on the above four naturally occurring (1-4) and six additional synthetic 2-arylbenzo[b]furan derivatives. Taken together, these 2-arylbenzo[b]furan derivatives, as LOXs inhibitors, could represent valuable leads for the future development of therapeutic agents for inflammatory diseases.\n\nSAH derived potent and selective EZH2 inhibitors\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKung, Pei-Pei; Huang, Buwen; Zehnder, Luke; Tatlock, John; Bingham, Patrick; Krivacic, Cody; Gajiwala, Ketan; Diehl, Wade; Yu, Xiu; Maegley, Karen A.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nA series of novel enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) inhibitors was designed based on the chemical structure of the histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitor SAH (S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine). These nucleoside-based EZH2 inhibitors blocked the methylation of nucleosomes at H3K27 in biochemical assays employing both WT PRC2 complex as well as a Y641N mutant PRC2 complex. The most potent compound, 27, displayed IC50âs against both complexes of 270 nM and 70 nM, respectively. To our knowledge, compound 27 is the most potent SAH-derived inhibitor of the EZH2 PRC2 complex yet identified.

Here we report on the isolation of a new potent angiogenic factor, diuridine tetraphosphate (Up4U from the secretome of human endothelial cells. The angiogenic effect of the endothelial secretome was partially reduced after incubation with alkaline phosphatase and abolished in the presence of suramin. In one fraction, purified to homogeneity by reversed phase and affinity chromatography, Up4U was identified by MALDI-LIFT-fragment-mass-spectrometry, enzymatic cleavage analysis and retention-time comparison. Beside a strong angiogenic effect on the yolk sac membrane and the developing rat embryo itself, Up4U increased the proliferation rate of endothelial cells and, in the presence of PDGF, of vascular smooth muscle cells. Up4U stimulated the migration rate of endothelial cells via P2Y2-receptors, increased the ability of endothelial cells to form capillary-like tubes and acts as a potent inducer of sprouting angiogenesis originating from gel-embedded EC spheroids. Endothelial cells released Up4U after stimulation with shear stress. Mean total plasma Up4U concentrations of healthy subjects (N=6 were sufficient to induce angiogenic and proliferative effects (1.34 Â± 0.26 nmol L(-1. In conclusion, Up4U is a novel strong human endothelium-derived angiogenic factor.\n\nThioester derivatives of the natural product psammaplin A as potent histone deacetylase inhibitors\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMatthias G. J. Baud\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available There has been significant interest in the bioactivity of the natural product psammaplin A, most recently as a potent and isoform selective HDAC inhibitor. Here we report our preliminary studies on thioester HDAC inhibitors derived from the active monomeric (thiol form of psammaplin A, as a means to improve compound delivery into cells. We have discovered that such compounds exhibit both potent cytotoxicity and enzymatic inhibitory activity against recombinant HDAC1. The latter effect is surprising since previous SAR suggested that modification of the thiol functionality should detrimentally affect HDAC potency. We therefore also report our preliminary studies on the mechanism of action of this observed effect.\n\nSynthesis and biological evaluation of novel tetrahydroisoquinoline-C-aryl glucosides as SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPan, Xuan; Huan, Yi; Shen, Zhufang; Liu, Zhanzhu\n\n2016-05-23\n\nA series of novel tetrahydroisoquinoline-C-aryl glucosides has been synthesized and evaluated for the inhibition of human SGLT2.

The accuracy and precision were determined and validated statistically. The method was validated as a guideline. The results showed that the proposed method is suitable for the accurate, precise, and rapid determination of pyrimidine derivative.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs remove the acetyl group, leading to chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression. HDAC inhibitors are considered a new class of anticancer agents and have been shown to alter gene transcription and exert antitumor effects. This paper describes our work on the structural determination and structure-activity relationship (SAR optimization of tetrahydroisoquinoline compounds as HDAC inhibitors. These compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit HDAC 1, 3, 6 and for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of a panel of cancer cell lines. Among these, compound 82 showed the greatest inhibitory activity toward HDAC 1, 3, 6 and strongly inhibited growth of the cancer cell lines, with results clearly superior to those of the reference compound, vorinostat (SAHA. Compound 82 increased the acetylation of histones H3, H4 and tubulin in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that it is a broad inhibitor of HDACs.\n\nHydroxamic acid derivatives as potent peptide deformylase inhibitors and antibacterial agents.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nApfel, C; Banner, D W; Bur, D; Dietz, M; Hirata, T; Hubschwerlen, C; Locher, H; Page, M G; Pirson, W; RossÃ©, G; Specklin, J L\n\n2000-06-15\n\nLow-molecular-weight beta-sulfonyl- and beta-sulfinylhydroxamic acid derivatives have been synthesized and found to be potent inhibitors of Escherichia coli peptide deformylase (PDF).

Among these compounds, 2-pyridylacetanilide (2f), pyrimidin-2-ylacetanilide (2u), and pyrazin-2-ylacetanilide (2v) derivatives exhibited potent agonistic activity at the beta3-AR with functional selectivity over the beta1- and beta2-ARs. In particular, compound 2u was found to be the most potent and selective beta3-AR agonist with an EC(50) value of 0.11 microM and no agonistic activity for either the beta1- or beta2-AR. In addition, 2f, 2u, and 2v showed significant hypoglycemic activity in a rodent diabetic model.\n\nIsovanillin derived N-(un)substituted hydroxylamines possessing an ortho-allylic group: valuable precursors to bioactive N-heterocycles.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDulla, Balakrishna; Tangellamudi, Neelima D; Balasubramanian, Sridhar; Yellanki, Swapna; Medishetti, Raghavender; Kumar Banote, Rakesh; Hari Chaudhari, Girish; Kulkarni, Pushkar; Iqbal, Javed; Reiser, Oliver; Pal, Manojit\n\n2014-04-28\n\nThe intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of isovanillin derived N-aryl hydroxylamines possessing ortho-allylic dipolarophiles affords novel benzo analogues of tricyclic isoxazolidines that can be readily transformed into functionalized lactams, Î³-aminoalcohols and oxazepines.

Therefore, development of new classes of antimalarial agents is essential to effectively treat malaria. In this study, the efficacy of naturally occurring diterpenoids, dehydroabietylamine and abietic acid, and their synthetic derivatives was assessed for antimalarial activity. Dehydroabietylamine and its N-trifluoroacetyl, N-tribromoacetyl, N-benzoyl, and N-benzyl derivatives showed excellent activity against P. falciparum parasites with IC50 values of 0.36 to 2.6 ÂµM. Interestingly, N-dehydroabietylbenzamide showed potent antimalarial activity (IC50 0.36), and negligible cytotoxicity (IC50 >100 ÂµM) to mammalian cells; thus, this compound can be an important antimalarial drug. In contrast, abietic acid was only marginally effective, exhibiting an IC50 value of ~82 ÂµM. Several carboxylic group-derivatives of abietic acid were moderately active with IC50 values of ~8.2 to ~13.3 ÂµM. These results suggest that a detailed understanding of the structure-activity relationship of abietane diterpenoids might provide strategies to exploit this class of compounds for malaria treatment.

It exhibits a wide spectrum of pharmacophores and has bactericidal, antiviral, antimalarial, and anticancer activities. In view of the reported antimicrobial activity of various fluoroquinolones, the importance of the C-7 substituents is that they exhibit potent antimicrobial activities. Our objective was to synthesize newer quinolone analogues with increasing bulk at C-7 position of the main 6-fluoroquinolone scaffold to produce the target compounds which have potent antimicrobial activity. Methods. A novel series of 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-7-{4-[2-(4-substituted phenyl-2-(substituted-ethyl]-1-piperazinyl}-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives were synthesized. To understand the interaction of binding sites with bacterial protein receptor, the docking study was performed using topoisomerase II DNA gyrase enzymes (PDB ID: 2XCT by Schrodingerâs Maestro program. In vitro antibacterial activity of the synthesized compounds was studied and the MIC value was calculated by the broth dilution method. Results.

Structure based design of subtype selective D 2 R antagonists requires high resolution crystal structures of the receptor and pharmacological tools promoting a better understanding of the protein-ligand interactions. Recently, we reported the development of a chemically activated dopamine derivative (FAUC150) designed to covalently bind the L94C mutant of the dopamine D 2 receptor. Using FAUC150 as a template, we elaborated the design and synthesis of irreversible analogs of the potent antipsychotic drug haloperidol forming covalent D 2 R-ligand complexes. The disulfide- and Michael acceptor-functionalized compounds showed significant receptor affinity and an irreversible binding profile in radioligand depletion experiments.

Controlled inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) may slow neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The anticholinesterase activity of phenylcinnamide derivatives was determined against Electric Eel acetylcholinesterase (EeAChE) and horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE) and some of the compounds appeared as moderately potent inhibitors of EeAChE and hBChE. The compound 3-(2-(Benzyloxy)phenyl)-N-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)acrylamide (3i) showed maximum activity against EeAChE with an IC50 0.29 Â± 0.21 Î¼M whereas 3-(2-chloro-6-nitrophenyl)-N-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)acrylamide (3k) was proved to be the most potent inhibitor of hBChE having IC50 1.18 Â± 1.31 Î¼M. To better understand the enzyme-inhibitor interaction of the most active compounds toward cholinesterases, molecular modelling studies were carried out on high-resolution crystallographic structures. The anticancer effects of synthesized compounds were also evaluated against cancer cell line (lung carcinoma). The compounds may be useful leads for the design of a new class of anticancer drugs for the treatment of cancer and cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

The hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin are thought to mediate the self-assembly of elastin into fibers, and the temperature-mediated self-assembly (coacervation) of one such repetitive peptide sequence (VPGVG) has been utilized in various bio-applications. To elucidate a mechanism for coacervation activity enhancement and to develop more potent coacervatable elastin-derived peptides, we synthesized two series of peptide analogs containing an aromatic amino acid, Trp or Tyr, in addition to Phe-containing analogs and tested their functional characteristics. Thus, position 1 of the hydrophobic pentapeptide repeat of elastin (X(1)P(2)G(3)V(4)G(5)) was substituted by Trp or Tyr. Eventually, we acquired a novel, short Trp-containing elastin-derived peptide analog (WPGVG)3 with potent coacervation ability. From the results obtained during this process, we determined the importance of aromaticity and hydrophobicity for the coacervation potency of elastin-derived peptide analogs. Generally, however, the production of long-chain synthetic polypeptides in quantities sufficient for commercial use remain cost-prohibitive. Therefore, the identification of (WPGVG)3, which is a 15-mer short peptide consisting simply of five natural amino acids and shows temperature-dependent self-assembly activity, might serve as a foundation for the development of various kinds of biomaterials.

The anti-inflammatory potential of nineteen mono-, di- and polyhydroxylated flavones including fisetin, quercetin, morin, tricetin, gossypetin, apigenin and myricetin were investigated on rat mesangial cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS as the inflammatory stimuli. 6-Hydroxyflavone and 4',6-dihydroxyflavone exhibited high activity with IC50 in the range of 2.0 Î¼M, a much better inhibition potential in comparison to the well-studied polyhydroxylated flavones. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory activity was not due to direct quenching of NO radicals. Investigation on derivatives with methylation, acetylation or sulfation of 6-hydroxyl group revealed that 6-methoxyflavone was the most potent with an IC50 of 192 nM. Mechanistic study indicated that the anti-inflammatory activity of 6-methoxyflavone arose via the inhibition of LPS-induced downstream inducible NO synthase in mesangial cells. The identification of 6-hydroxyflavone and 6-methoxyflavone with potent anti-inflammatory activity in kidney mesangial cells provides a new flavone scaffold and direction to develop naturally derived products for potential nephritis prevention and treatment.\n\nDiscovery of potent broad spectrum antivirals derived from marine actinobacteria.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAvi Raveh\n\nFull Text Available Natural products provide a vast array of chemical structures to explore in the discovery of new medicines. Although secondary metabolites produced by microbes have been developed to treat a variety of diseases, including bacterial and fungal infections, to date there has been limited investigation of natural products with antiviral activity. In this report, we used a phenotypic cell-based replicon assay coupled with an iterative biochemical fractionation process to identify, purify, and characterize antiviral compounds produced by marine microbes. We isolated a compound from Streptomyces kaviengensis, a novel actinomycetes isolated from marine sediments obtained off the coast of New Ireland, Papua New Guinea, which we identified as antimycin A1a. This compound displays potent activity against western equine encephalitis virus in cultured cells with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of less than 4 nM and a selectivity index of greater than 550. Our efforts also revealed that several antimycin A analogues display antiviral activity, and mechanism of action studies confirmed that these Streptomyces-derived secondary metabolites function by inhibiting the cellular mitochondrial electron transport chain, thereby suppressing de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Furthermore, we found that antimycin A functions as a broad spectrum agent with activity against a wide range of RNA viruses in cultured cells, including members of the Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Paramyxoviridae families. Finally, we demonstrate that antimycin A reduces central nervous system viral titers, improves clinical disease severity, and enhances survival in mice given a lethal challenge with western equine encephalitis virus. Our results provide conclusive validation for using natural product resources derived from marine microbes as source material for antiviral drug discovery, and they indicate that host mitochondrial electron transport is a viable\n\nGraphite-supported gold nanoparticles as efficient catalyst for aerobic oxidation of benzylic amines to imines and N-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines to amides: synthetic applications and mechanistic study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSo, Man-Ho; Liu, Yungen; Ho, Chi-Ming; Che, Chi-Ming\n\n2009-10-05\n\nSelective oxidation of amines using oxygen as terminal oxidant is an important area in green chemistry. In this work, we describe the use of graphite-supported gold nanoparticles (AuNPs/C) to catalyze aerobic oxidation of cyclic and acyclic benzylic amines to the corresponding imines with moderate-to-excellent substrate conversions (43-100%) and product yields (66-99%) (19 examples). Oxidation of N-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines in the presence of aqueous NaHCO3 solution gave the corresponding amides in good yields (83-93%) with high selectivity (up to amide/enamide=93:4) (6 examples). The same protocol can be applied to the synthesis of benzimidazoles from the reaction of o-phenylenediamines with benzaldehydes under aerobic conditions (8 examples). By simple centrifugation, AuNPs/C can be recovered and reused for ten consecutive runs for the oxidation of dibenzylamine to N-benzylidene(phenyl)methanamine without significant loss of catalytic activity and selectivity. This protocol \"AuNPs/C+O2\" can be scaled to the gram scale, and 8.9 g (84 % isolated yield) of 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline can be obtained from the oxidation of 10 g 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline in a one-pot reaction. Based on the results of kinetic studies, radical traps experiment, and Hammett plot, a mechanism involving the hydrogen-transfer reaction from amine to metal and oxidation of M-H is proposed.\n\nScreening of Natural Product Derivatives Identifies Two Structurally Related Flavonoids as Potent Quorum Sensing Inhibitors against Gram-Negative Bacteria\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSuvi Manner\n\n2018-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Owing to the failure of conventional antibiotics in biofilm control, alternative approaches are urgently needed. Inhibition of quorum sensing (QS represents an attractive target since it is involved in several processes essential for biofilm formation. In this study, a compound library of natural product derivatives (n = 3040 was screened for anti-quorum sensing activity using Chromobacterium violaceum as reporter bacteria. Screening assays, based on QS-mediated violacein production and viability, were performed in parallel to identify non-bactericidal QS inhibitors (QSIs. Nine highly active QSIs were identified, while 328 compounds were classified as moderately actives and 2062 compounds as inactives. Re-testing of the highly actives at a lower concentration against C. violaceum, complemented by a literature search, led to the identification of two flavonoid derivatives as the most potent QSIs, and their impact on biofilm maturation in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was further investigated. Finally, effects of these leads on swimming and swarming motility of P. aeruginosa were quantified. The identified flavonoids affected all the studied QS-related functions at micromolar concentrations. These compounds can serve as starting points for further optimization and development of more potent QSIs as adjunctive agents used with antibiotics in the treatment of biofilms.\n\nMarine-derived fungi: Source of biologically potent and novel compounds\n\nDigital Repository Service at National Institute of Oceanography (India)\n\nMajik, M.S.; Parvatkar, R.R.; Tilvi, S.; Gawas, S.G.\n\n-83) showed potent anti-mycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. bovisand M. tuberculosis, with MIC values in the range 0.02â2.0 mg/mL, and were effective against both actively growing and dormant states.

Available treatment regimen was unsuccessful in eradicating the deaths caused by the disease worldwide. Owing to the drawbacks such as prolonged treatment period, side effects, and drug tolerance, there resulted in patient noncompliance. In the current study, we attempted to develop inhibitors against unexplored key target glutamate racemase. Methods: Lead identification was done using thermal shift assay from in-house library; inhibitors were developed by lead derivatization technique and evaluated using various biological assays. Results: In indazole series, compounds 11 (6.32 Â± 0.35 Î¼M and 22 (6.11 Â± 0.51 Î¼M were found to be most promising potent inhibitors among all. These compounds also showed their inhibition on replicating and nonreplicating bacteria. Conclusion: We have developed the novel inhibitors against M. tuberculosis capable of inhibiting active and dormant bacteria, further optimization of inhibitor derivatives can results in better compounds for eradicating tuberculosis.\n\nSynthesis and SAR studies of potent imidazopyridine anticoccidial agents.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiang, Gui-Bai; Qian, Xiaoxia; Feng, Dennis; Fisher, Michael; Brown, Christine M; Gurnett, Anne; Leavitt, Penny Sue; Liberator, Paul A; Misura, Andrew S; Tamas, Tamas; Schmatz, Dennis M; Wyvratt, Matthew; Biftu, Tesfaye\n\n2007-07-01\n\nDiaryl imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives, such as 6a and 7i, have been synthesized and found to be potent inhibitors of parasite PKG activity.

Inhibition assays with a panel of glycosidases revealed that the guanidino analogues display potent inhibition against human recombinant Î²-glucocerebrosidase with IC 50 values in the low nanomolar range. Related urea analogues of 1,5-dideoxy-1,5-imino-d-xylitol were also synthesized and evaluated in the same fashion and found to be selective for Î²-galactosidase from bovine liver. No inhibition of human recombinant Î²-glucocerebrosidase was observed for the urea analogues. Computational studies provided insight into the potent activity of analogues bearing the substituted guanidine moiety in the inhibition of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GBA).

Inhibition of such pumps is a promising strategy to circumvent this resistance mechanism. NorA is a Staphylococcus aureus efflux pump that confers reduced susceptibility to many structurally unrelated agents, including fluoroquinolones, resulting in a multidrug resistant phenotype. In this work, a series of 2-phenyl-4(1H)-quinolone and 2-phenyl-4-hydroxyquinoline derivatives, obtained by modifying the flavone nucleus of known efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), were synthesized in an effort to identify more potent S. aureus NorA EPIs. The 2-phenyl-4-hydroxyquinoline derivatives 28f and 29f display potent EPI activity against SA-1199B, a strain that overexpresses norA, in an ethidium bromide efflux inhibition assay. The same compounds, in combination with ciprofloxacin, were able to completely restore its antibacterial activity against both S. aureus SA-K2378 and SA-1199B, norA-overexpressing strains.

The attachment of His-derived lipo-amino acid into the very short inactive cationic peptides endows potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without hemolytic activity. Furthermore, our designed His-derived lipo-peptidomimetics (HDLPs) consisting of two or three residues displayed strong anti-MRSA activity and protease stability as well as retained potent antimicrobial activity under high salt concentration. Our results demonstrate that the novel lipo-amino acid is highly flexible to synthesize and carry out the extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) on lipo-antimicrobial peptidomimetics and represents aÂ unique amenable platform for modifying parameters important for antimicrobial activity. Through this study, we proved that the discovery of His-derived lipo-amino acid and the corresponding HDLPs are an excellent candidateÂ as a lead compound for the development of novel antimicrobial agents.

In this respect, we turned several fusogenic peptides (FPs) derived from the hemagglutinin glycoproteins (HAs) of IAV into potent antibacterials by replacing the negatively or neutrally charged residues of FPs with positively charged lysines. Their antibacterial activities were evaluated by testing the MICs against a panel of bacterial strains including S.Â aureus, S.Â mutans, P.Â aeruginosa, and E.Â coli. The results showed that peptides HA-FP-1, HA-FP-2-1, and HA-FP-3-1 were effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with MICs ranging from 1.9 to 16.0Â Î¼m, while the toxicities toward mammalian cells were low. In addition, the mode of action and the secondary structure of these peptides were also discussed. These data not only provide several potent peptides displaying promising potential in development as broad antimicrobial agents, but also present a useful strategy in designing new antimicrobial agents.

Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells and associated with regulation of T cell development via interleukin-2 signaling pathway. Here, we designed novel 4,6-diaminonicotinamide derivatives as immunomodulators targeting JAK3 for prevention of transplant rejection. Our optimization of C4- and C6-substituents and docking calculations to JAK3 protein confirmed that the 4,6-diaminonicotinamide scaffold resulted in potent inhibition of JAK3. We also investigated avoidance of human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) inhibitory activity.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of a pyrrolidine analogue 2 led to the discovery of 5e as a potent Na(+) channel blocker with a low inhibitory action against human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels. Compound 5e showed remarkably neuroprotective activity in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, suggesting that 5e would act as a neuroprotectant for ischemic stroke.

In principle, a Na,K-ATPase inhibitor with selectivity for Î±2Î²3 that penetrates the cornea could effectively reduce intraocular pressure, with minimal systemic or local toxicity. We have recently synthesized perhydro-1,4-oxazepine derivatives of digoxin by NaIO4 oxidation of the third digitoxose and reductive amination with various R-NH2 substituents and identified derivatives with significant selectivity for human Î±2Î²1 over Î±1Î²1 (up to 7.5-fold). When applied topically, the most Î±2-selective derivatives effectively prevented or reversed pharmacologically raised intraocular pressure in rabbits. A recent structure of Na,K-ATPase, with bound digoxin, shows the third digitoxose approaching one residue in the Î²1 subunit, Gln84, suggesting a role for Î² in digoxin binding. Gln84 in Î²1 is replaced by Val88 in Î²3. Assuming that alkyl substituents might interact with Î²3Val88, we synthesized perhydro-1,4-oxazepine derivatives of digoxin with diverse alkyl substituents. The methylcyclopropyl and cyclobutyl derivatives are strongly selective for Î±2Î²3 over Î±1Î²1 (22-33-fold respectively), as determined either with purified human isoform proteins or intact bovine nonpigmented epithelium cells. When applied topically on rabbit eyes, these derivatives potently reduce both pharmacologically raised and basal intraocular pressure. The cyclobutyl derivative is more efficient than Latanoprost, the most widely used glaucoma drug. Thus, the conclusion is that Î±2Î²3-selective digoxin derivatives effectively penetrate the cornea and inhibit the Na,K-ATPase, hence reducing aqueous humor production. The new digoxin derivatives may have potential for glaucoma drug therapy.\n\nEffects of single and repeated administration of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline analogs on the binding of [11C]raclopride to dopamine D2 receptors in the mouse brain\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIshiwata, K.; Senda, M.; Saitoh, T.; Taguchi, K.; Toda, J.; Sano, T.; Koyanagi, Y.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nWe investigated the effects of intraperitoneal injection of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) analogs and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on the binding of [ 11 C]raclopride to striatal dopamine D 2 receptors in mice. The binding of [ 11 C]raclopride, but not of [ 11 C]N-methylspiperone or [ 11 C]nemonapride with higher affinity, to the receptors was significantly decreased immediately after TIQ injection. Neither a dopamine transporter blocker induced such effect nor TIQ affected the dopamine transporter-radioligand binding. Among the compounds investigated, including parkinsonism-inducing TIQ and (R/S)-1-benzyl-TIQ, parkinsonism-preventing (R)- and (S)-1-methyl-TIQ, and probable N-methylated metabolites of TIQ and 1-methyl-TIQ, TIQ and (S)-1-methyl-TIQ had the strongest effect on the binding of [ 11 C]raclopride, and N-methylated derivatives showed less of an effect than the respective parent compounds. The decrease in the binding of [ 11 C]raclopride continued for 7 hours and was followed by an increase until 10 days after the single and subchronic administration of TIQ. These findings suggest that TIQ analogs profoundly stimulated dopamine release which resulted in the competitive inhibition of the binding of [ 11 C]raclopride to dopamine D 2 receptors, but did not induce degeneration of the receptors.

After a single oral administration of (14)C-YM758, extensive accumulation and long-term retention of radioactivity were observed in the eyeballs of nonalbino rats and in the thoracic aorta of albino/nonalbino rats. Radioluminograms of the eyeballs of nonalbino rats indicated that the radioactivity was localized to the uveal tract, which suggests that the radioactivity may be positively charged and bound mainly to the melanins. Treatment with a mixture of 2 mol/l hydrochloric acid and methanol (5:95, v/v) allowed for the recovery of the major portion of radioactivity from the eyeball, which suggests reversible binding. The radioactive constituents in eyeballs consisted of the unchanged drug (YM758) and three metabolites [mainly 6,7-dimethoxy-2-[(3R)-piperidin-3-ylcarbonyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (YM-252124)]. Using the organic solvent mixture described above, almost all of the radioactivity was not collected from the thoracic aorta, and approximately 90% was recovered by treatment with elastase, which suggests that some metabolites covalently bind to the elastin fiber localized in the tunica media.\n\nProposal for novel curcumin derivatives as potent inhibitors against Alzheimer's disease: Ab initio molecular simulations on the specific interactions between amyloid-beta peptide and curcumin\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOta, Shintaro; Fujimori, Mitsuki; Ishimura, Hiromi; Shulga, Sergiy; Kurita, Noriyuki\n\n2017-10-01\n\nAccumulation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) peptides in a brain is closely related with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. To suppress the production of AÎ² peptides, we propose novel curcumin derivatives and investigate their binding properties with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), using protein-ligand docking as well as ab initio molecular simulations. Our proposed derivative (curcumin XIV) is found to have a large binding energy with APP and interacts strongly with the cleavage site Ala19 by secretase. It is thus expected that curcumin XIV can protect APP from the secretase attack and be a potent inhibitor against the production of AÎ² peptides.\n\nDiindolylmethane Derivatives: Potent Agonists of the Immunostimulatory Orphan G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR84.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPillaiyar, Thanigaimalai; KÃ¶se, Meryem; Sylvester, Katharina; Weighardt, Heike; Thimm, Dominik; Borges, Gleice; FÃ¶rster, Irmgard; von KÃ¼gelgen, Ivar; MÃ¼ller, Christa E\n\n2017-05-11\n\nThe G i protein-coupled receptor GPR84, which is activated by (hydroxy)fatty acids, is highly expressed on immune cells. Recently, 3,3'-diindolylmethane was identified as a heterocyclic, nonlipid-like GPR84 agonist. We synthesized a broad range of diindolylmethane derivatives by condensation of indoles with formaldehyde in water under microwave irradiation. The products were evaluated at the human GPR84 in cAMP and Î²-arrestin assays. Structure-activity relationships (SARs) were steep. 3,3'-Diindolylmethanes bearing small lipophilic residues at the 5- and/or 7-position of the indole rings displayed the highest activity in cAMP assays, the most potent agonists being di(5-fluoro-1H-indole-3-yl)methane (38, PSB-15160, EC 50 80.0 nM) and di(5,7-difluoro-1H-indole-3-yl)methane (57, PSB-16671, EC 50 41.3 nM). In Î²-arrestin assays, SARs were different, indicating biased agonism. The new compounds were selective versus related fatty acid receptors and the arylhydrocarbon receptor. Selected compounds were further investigated and found to display an ago-allosteric mechanism of action and increased stability in comparison to the lead structure.\n\nDiscovery and characterization of novel imidazopyridine derivative CHEQ-2 as a potent CDC25 inhibitor and promising anticancer drug candidate.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSong, Yu'ning; Lin, Xiaoqian; Kang, Dongwei; Li, Xiao; Zhan, Peng; Liu, Xinyong; Zhang, Qingzhu\n\n2014-07-23\n\nCell division cycle (CDC) 25 proteins are key phosphatases regulating cell cycle transition and proliferation via the interactions with CDK/Cyclin complexes. Overexpression of CDC25 proteins is frequently observed in cancer and is related to aggressiveness, high-grade tumors and poor prognosis. Thus, inhibiting CDC25 activity in cancer treatment appears a good therapeutic strategy. In this article, refinement of the initial hit XDW-1 by synthesis and screening of a focused compound library led to the identification of a novel set of imidazopyridine derivatives as potent CDC25 inhibitors. Among them, the most potent molecule was CHEQ-2, which could efficiently inhibit the activities of CDC25A/B enzymes as well as the proliferation of various different types of cancer cell lines in vitro assay. Moreover, CHEQ-2 triggered S-phase cell cycle arrest in MCF-7, HepG2 and HT-29 cell lines, accompanied by generation of ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Besides, oral administration of CHEQ-2 (10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited xenografted human liver tumor growth in nude mice, while demonstrated extremely low toxicity (LD50 > 2000 mg/kg). These findings make CHEQ-2 a good starting point for further investigation and structure modification. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In present investigation, eight new acacetin-7-O-methyl ether Mannich base derivatives (1-8) were synthesised from naringin. The bioactivity evaluation revealed that most of them exhibited moderate or potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity. Among them, compound 7 (IC 50 for AChEÂ =Â 0.82Â Â±Â 0.08Â Î¼molâ¢L -1 , IC 50 for BuChEÂ =Â 46.30Â Â±Â 3.26Â Î¼molâ¢L -1 ) showed a potent activity and high selectivity compared with the positive control Rivastigmine (IC 50 for AChEÂ =Â 10.54Â Â±Â 0.86Â Î¼molâ¢L -1 , IC 50 for BuChEÂ =Â 0.26Â Â±Â 0.08Â Î¼molâ¢L -1 ).

Adipose-derived stromal cells (ADStCs) have demonstrated tissue regenerative potential including cardiomyogenesis. Omentum is an extremely rich source of visceral fat and its accumulation seems to correlate with cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the capacity of human fat Omentum-derived StCs (FOStCs) to affect heart function upon acute infarct in pigs induced by permanent ligation of the anterior interventricular artery (IVA). We demonstrated for the first time that the local injection of 50 x 10{sup 6} of FOStCs ameliorates the functional parameters of post-infarct heart. Most importantly, histology of FOStCs treated hearts demonstrated a substantial improvement of cardiomyogenesis. In culture, FOStCs produced an impressive number and amount of angiogenic factors and cytokines. Moreover, the conditioned medium of FOStCs (FOStCs-CM) stimulates in vitro cardiac endothelial cells (ECs) proliferation and vascular morphogenesis and inhibits monocytes, EC activation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Since FOStCs in vivo did not trans-differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells, we conclude that FOStCs efficacy was presumably mediated by a potent paracrine mechanism involving molecules that concomitantly improved angiogenesis, reduced inflammation and prevented cardiomyocytes death.

N-methyl-laudanosine and its structurally related derivatives, substituted 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoliniums, are reversible and selective SKCa channel blockers. Carbon-11 labeled N-methyl-laudanosine and its tetrahydroisoquinolinium derivatives may serve as new probes for positron emission tomography (PET) to image SKCa channels in the brain, heart, and cancer. The key intermediates, substituted isoquinolines (3a-c), were synthesized using a modification of the Pomeranz-Fritsch procedure. The precursors, substituted 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines (8a-c), and their corresponding reference standards, substituted 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoliniums (9a-c), were synthesized from compounds 3a-c with 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl chloride (2) in multiple steps with moderate to excellent chemical yields. The precursor 6,7-dimethoxy-1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (10) was commercially available, and the methylation of compound 10 with methyl iodide provided N-methyl-laudanosine (11). The target quaternary ammonium tracers, carbon-11 labeled 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoliniums ([11C]9a-c and [11C]11), were prepared by N-[11C]methylation of the tertiary amine precursors (8a-c and 10) with [11C]methyl triflate and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) purification using a SiO2 or cation-exchange CM Sep-Pak cartridge in 40-65% radiochemical yields.\n\nSynthesis of carbon-11 labeled 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinium derivatives as new potential PET SK{sub Ca} channel imaging agents\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGao Mingzhang; Wang Min [Department of Radiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 1345 West 16th Street, L-3 Room 202, Indianapolis, IN 46202 (United States); Zheng Qihuang [Department of Radiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 1345 West 16th Street, L-3 Room 202, Indianapolis, IN 46202 (United States)], E-mail: qzheng@iupui.edu\n\n2008-02-15\n\nSmall conductance Ca{sup 2+}-activated K{sup +} (SK{sub Ca}) channels play an important role in many functions such as neuronal communication and behavioral plasticity, secretion, and cell proliferation.

Out of the investigated compounds, harmane and norharmane were the most potent inhibitors of specific [3H]-flunitrazepam binding, with IC50-values in the micromolar range. All other derivatives, including harmine, harmaline, and several tetrahydroderivatives were at least ten times less potent. Harmane has been previously found in rat brain and human urine, so it is the most potent endogenous inhibitor of specific [3H]-flunitrazepam binding known so far, with a several fold higher affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor than inosine and hypoxanthine. Thus, we suggest that harmane or other related beta-carbolines could be potential candidates as endogenous ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor.\n\nSulfoximines as potent RORÎ³ inverse agonists.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOuvry, Gilles; Bihl, Franck; Bouix-Peter, Claire; Christin, Olivier; Defoin-Platel, Claire; Deret, Sophie; Feret, Christophe; Froude, David; Hacini-Rachinel, Feriel; Harris, Craig S; Hervouet, Catherine; Lafitte, Guillaume; Luzy, Anne-Pascale; Musicki, Branislav; Orfila, Danielle; Parnet, Veronique; Pascau, Coralie; Pascau, Jonathan; Pierre, Romain; Raffin, Catherine; Rossio, Patricia; Spiesse, Delphine; Taquet, Nathalie; Thoreau, Etienne; Vatinel, Rodolphe; Vial, Emmanuel; Hennequin, Laurent F\n\n2018-05-01\n\nProgress in the identification of suitable RORÎ³ inverse agonists as clinical candidates has been hampered by the high lipophilicity that seems required for high potency on this nuclear receptor. In this context, we decided to focus on the replacement of the hydroxymethyl group found on known modulators to determine if more polarity could be tolerated in this position. SAR of the replacement of this moiety is presented in this article leading to the identification of sulfoximine derivatives as potent modulators with pharmacological activity in the in vivo mouse Imiquimod psoriasis model.

Aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) have received significant attentions as potent therapeutic drugs. Based on combination principles, three series of luteolin derivatives were synthesised and evaluated for their AR inhibitory activity and nitric oxide (NO)-releasing capacity in vitro. Eighteen compounds were found to be potent ARIs with IC50 values ranging from (0.099Â±0.008) Î¼M to (2.833Â±0.102) Î¼M. O(7)-Nitrooxyethyl-O(3'),O(4')-ethylidene luteolin (La1) showed the most potent AR inhibitory activity [IC50=(0.099Â±0.008) Î¼M]. All organic nitrate derivatives released low concentrations of NO in the presence of l-cysteine. Structure-activity relationship studies suggested that introduction of an NO donor, protection of the catechol structure, and the ether chain of a 2-carbon spacer as a coupling chain on the luteolin scaffold all help increase the AR inhibitory activity of the resulting compound. This class of NO-donor luteolin derivatives as efficient ARIs offer a new concept for the development and design of new drug for preventive and therapeutic drugs for diabetic complications.

Amides derived from proline had potency comparable to HTI-286. Reduction of the carboxylic acid to ketones and alcohols or its conversion to acidic heterocycles also gave potent analogs. Synthetic modifications of the carboxylic acid could be carried out selectively using a wide range of synthetic reagents. Proline analog 3 was found to be effective in a human xenograft model in athymic mice.\n\nAlkylsulfanyl analogs as potent Î±2Î´ ligands.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShimada, Kousei; Ohata, Yasuo; Kobayashi, Jun; Onishi, Yoshiyuki; Kawamura, Asuka; Domon, Yuki; Arakawa, Naohisa; Inoue, Tatsuya; Kitano, Yutaka; Matsuda, Fumihiko; Abe, Yuki; Deguchi, Tsuneo\n\n2018-06-15\n\nWe identified novel (3R, 5S)-3-aminomethyl-5-methanesulfanyl hexanoic acid (5a: DS75091588) and (3R, 5S)-3-aminomethyl-5-ethanesulfanyl hexanoic acid (6a: DS18430756) as sulfur-containing Î³-amino acid derivatives that were useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain. These two compounds exhibited a potent analgesic effect in animal models of both type I diabetes and type II diabetes, and good pharmacokinetics. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This model of neurotoxicity was applied in our study to explore neuroprotective potential of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ), an endo- and exogenous substance whose function in the mammalian brain, despite extensive studies, has not been elucidated so far. Injection of malonate at a dose of 3 mumol unilaterally into the rat left medial forebrain bundle resulted in the 54% decrease in dopamine (DA) concentration in the ipsilateral striatum and, depending on the examined striatum regions, caused 24-44% reduction in [3H]GBR12,935 binding to the dopamine transporter (DAT). TIQ (50 mg/kg i.p.) administered 4 h before malonate infusion and next once daily for successive 7 days prevented both these effects of malonate. Such TIQ treatment restored DA content and DAT binding a"
