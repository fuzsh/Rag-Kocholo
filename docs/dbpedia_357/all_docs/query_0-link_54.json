Cells of the two strains were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, polar-flagellated and rod-shaped. According to the phylogenetic tree, strains 5413J-26(T) and KIS18-15(T) fell into the cluster of Sphingomonas sensu stricto. Strain 5413J-26(T) showed the highest sequence similarities with Sphingomonas trueperi LMG 2142(T) (96.6%), Sphingomonas molluscorum KMM 3882(T) (96.5%), Sphingomonas azotifigens NBRC 15497(T) (96.3â%) and Sphingomonas pituitosa EDIV(T) (96.1â%), while strain KIS18-15(T) had the highest sequence similarity with Sphingomonas soli T5-04(T) (96.8%), Sphingomonas pituitosa EDIV(T) (96.6%), Sphingomonas leidyi ATCC 15260(T) (96.6â%), Sphingomonas asaccharolytica NBRC 15499(T) (96.6â%) and Sphingomonas koreensis JSS26(T) (96.6â%). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strains 5413J-26(T) and KIS18-15(T) was 95.4â%. Ubiquinone 10 was the predominant respiratory quinone and homospermidine was the major polyamine. The major polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and several unidentified phospholipids and lipids. The main cellular fatty acids (>10% of the total fatty acids) of strain 5413J-26(T) were summed feature 8 (C18â:â1Ï6c and/or C18â:â1Ï7c), summed feature 3 (C16â:â1Ï7c and/or iso-C15â:â0 2-OH) and C14â:â0 2-OH, and those of strain KIS18-15(T) were summed feature 8 and C16â:â0. Based on the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, and physiological and biochemical characterization, two novel species with the suggested names Sphingomonas aerophila sp. nov. (type strain 5413J-26(T)â=âKACC 16533(T)â=âNBRC 108942(T)) and Sphingomonas naasensis sp. nov.

(1990) as a group of Gram-negative, rod-shaped, chemoheterotrophic, strictly aerobic bacteria that possess ubiquinone 10 as the major respiratory quinone, contain glycosphingolipids (GSLs) instead of lipopolysaccharide in their cell envelopes, and typically produce yellow-pigmented colonies. By 2001, the genus included more than 20 species that were quite diverse in terms of their phylogenetic, ecological, and physiological properties. As a result, Takeuchi et al. (2001) subdivided Sphingomonas into four genera: Sphingomonas, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium and Sphingopyxis...\n\nTaxonomic study of aromatic-degrading bacteria from deep-terrestrial-subsurface sediments and description of Sphingomonas aromaticivorans sp. nov., Sphingomonas subterranea sp. nov., and Sphingomonas stygia sp. nov.\n\nPubMed\n\nBalkwill, D L; Drake, G R; Reeves, R H; Fredrickson, J K; White, D C; Ringelberg, D B; Chandler, D P; Romine, M F; Kennedy, D W; Spadoni, C M\n\n1997-01-01\n\nPhylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences by distance matrix and parsimony methods indicated that six strains of bacteria isolated from deep saturated Atlantic coastal plain sediments were closely related to the genus Sphingomonas. Five of the strains clustered with, but were distinct from, Sphingomonas capsulata, whereas the sixth strain was most closely related to Blastobacter natatorius. The five strains that clustered with S. capsulata, all of which could degrade aromatic compounds, were gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped organisms that produced small, yellow colonies on complex media. Their G + C contents ranged from 60.0 to 65.4 mol%, and the predominant isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone Q-10. All of the strains were aerobic and catalase positive. Indole, urease, and arginine dihydrolase were not produced. Gelatin was not liquified, and glucose was not fermented. Sphingolipids were present in all strains; 2OH14:0 was the major hydroxy fatty acid, and 18:1 was a major constituent of cellular lipids. Acid was produced oxidatively from pentoses, hexoses, and disaccharides, but not from polyalcohols and indole. All of these characteristics indicate that the five aromatic-degrading strains should be placed in the genus Sphingomonas as currently defined. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, DNA-DNA reassociation values, BOX-PCR genomic fingerprinting, differences in cellular lipid composition, and differences in physiological traits all indicated that the five strains represent three previously undescribed Sphingomonas species. Therefore, we propose the following new species: Sphingomonas aromaticivorans (type strain, SMCC F199), Sphingomonas subterranea (type strain, SMCC B0478), and Sphingomonas stygia (type strain, SMCC B0712).\n\nSphingomonas Infections Arising from Hospital Plumbing Fixtures\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZellmer, Caroline J; Michelin, Angela V; Johnson, Ryan C; Dekker, John P; Frank, Karen M; Henderson, David K; Lau, Anna F; Segre, Julia A; Palmore, Tara N\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract Background Following a rise in nosocomial infections due to Sphingomonas, a waterborne Gram-negative organism, we undertook an epidemiological investigation to identify possible sources and develop a remediation strategy. Methods We analyzed Sphingomonas isolates from 30 inpatients in the past 11Â years, and we reviewed each patientâs chart. We collected swabs of faucets, water samples, and free and total chlorine levels from rooms of Sphingomonas patients from 2016, using unrelated rooms as controls. Water samples and chlorine levels were collected from hospital pipes. Swabs were placed into 1Â mL TSB and cultured to sheep blood agar. Isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Water samples were tested via membrane filtration (500Â mL) and spread plate method (1Â mL). Patient and environmental Sphingomonas isolates underwent whole genome sequencing, and were analyzed with Mash and Snippy for overall genomic sequence and single-nucleotide polymorphisms comparisons, respectively, to assess relatedness. Results Of 27 faucets examined, 59% grew Sphingomonas spp., and 33% grew highly-resistant S.Â koreensis. Of 21 water samples, 76% grew Sphingomonas spp., and 48% grew S.Â koreensis. Sequence analysis demonstrated strong genetic similarity among S.Â koreensis clinical isolates from the past 11Â years and recent faucet and water isolates. One patientâs S.Â koreensis isolate was genetically related to isolates from faucets in his room. Sphingomonas did not grow from samples collected from municipal water or some of the far upstream water pipes within the hospital. Free chlorine levels were extremely low in hot water, leading to a program of flushing in order to restore and maintain adequate levels. Among 7 contaminated faucets that were replaced, 3 became recolonized within 4 weeks, and continued to grow Sphingomonas fromÂ water. Conclusion Investigation and genome sequencing suggest long-standing S.Â koreensis colonization within the hospital plumbing system\n\nClassification of \"Pseudomonas azotocolligans\" Anderson 1955, 132, in the genus Sphingomonas as Sphingomonas trueperi sp. nov.\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¤mpfer, P; Denner, E B; Meyer, S; Moore, E R; Busse, H J\n\n1997-04-01\n\n\"Pseudomonas azotocolligans\" ATCC 12417T (T = type strain), which was described as a diazotrophic bacterium, was reinvestigated to clarify its taxonomic position. 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparisons demonstrated that this strain clusters phylogenetically with species of the genus Sphingomonas and represents a new species. The results of investigations of the fatty acid patterns, polar lipid profiles, and quinone system supported this placement. The substrate utilization profile and biochemical characteristics displayed no obvious similarity to the characteristics of any previously described species of the genus Sphingomonas. The new name Sphingomonas trueperi is proposed on the basis of these results and previously published data for the G + C content of the genomic DNA and the polyamine pattern.\n\nSphingomonas molluscorum sp. nov., a novel marine isolate with antimicrobial activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomanenko, Lyudmila A; Uchino, Masataka; Frolova, Galina M; Tanaka, Naoto; Kalinovskaya, Natalia I; Latyshev, Nicolai; Mikhailov, Valery V\n\n2007-02-01\n\nAn aerobic, Gram-negative, yellow-pigmented, non-motile bacterium, designated strain KMM 3882T, was isolated from a marine bivalve (Anadara broughtoni) collected from Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan, and was subjected to phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses. Strain KMM 3882T was found to exert a remarkable inhibitory activity against a number of Gram-positive micro-organisms. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences placed strain KMM 3882T within the genus Sphingomonas, as an independent lineage adjacent to Sphingomonas dokdonensis DS-4T and Sphingomonas panni DSM 15761T. Strain KMM 3882T showed the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Sphingomonas dokdonensis DS-4T (97.3 %); similarities of 96.5-96.7 % were obtained with Sphingomonas pituitosa DSM 13101T, Sphingomonas azotifigens NBRC 15497T, Sphingomonas asaccharolytica NBRC 15499T, Sphingomonas trueperi DSM 7225T and Sphingomonas panni DSM 15761T. Chemotaxonomically, strain KMM 3882T contained sphingoglycolipid, C(16 : 0) and C(18 : 1) as predominant fatty acids and 2-OH C(14 : 0) as a major 2-hydroxy fatty acid, confirming the affiliation of strain KMM 3882T with the genus Sphingomonas. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization and physiological and biochemical characterization, strain KMM 3882T should be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas molluscorum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KMM 3882T (=An 18T=NRIC 0685T=JCM 14122T=CIP 109223T).\n\nSphingomonas japonica sp. nov., isolated from the marine crustacean Paralithodes camtschatica.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomanenko, Lyudmila A; Tanaka, Naoto; Frolova, Galina M; Mikhailov, Valery V\n\n2009-05-01\n\nA Sphingomonas-like bacterium, strain KC7(T), was isolated from a marine crustacean specimen obtained from the Sea of Japan and subjected to a polyphasic study. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis positioned the novel strain in the genus Sphingomonas as an independent lineage adjacent to a subclade containing Sphingomonas trueperi LMG 2142(T), Sphingomonas pituitosa EDIV(T) and Sphingomonas azotifigens NBRC 15497(T). Strain KC7(T) shared highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (96.1 %) with S. trueperi LMG 2142(T), Sphingomonas dokdonensis DS-4(T) and S. azotifigens NBRC 15497(T); similarities to strains of other recognized Sphingomonas species were lower (96.0-93.9 %). The strain contained sphingoglycolipid and the predominant fatty acids were C(16 : 1), C(16 : 0) and C(18 : 1); 2-OH C(14 : 0) was the major 2-hydroxy fatty acid. Previously, these lipids have been found to be characteristic of members of the genus Sphingomonas sensu stricto. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis and physiological and biochemical characterization, strain KC7(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas japonica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KC7(T) (=KMM 3038(T) =NRIC 0738(T) =JCM 15438(T)).\n\nDraft Genome Sequence of Sphingomonas echinoides ATCC 14820\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShin, Seung Chul; Kim, Su Jin; Ahn, Do Hwan; Lee, Jong Kyu\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSphingomonas is a Gram-negative, yellow-pigmented, chemoheterotrophic, strictly aerobic bacterium. The bacterium is known to be metabolically versatile and can utilize a wide range of natural compounds as well as some types of environmental contaminants, such as creosote, polychlorinated biphenyls, etc. Here, we report the draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas echinoides ATCC 14820, which will provide additional information to enhance our understanding of metabolic versatility of Sphingomonas. PMID:22408244\n\nSphingomonas morindae sp. nov., isolated from Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) branch.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Yang; Yao, Su; Lee, Yong-Jae; Cao, Yanhua; Zhai, Lei; Zhang, Xin; Su, Jiaojiao; Ge, Yuanyuan; Kim, Song-Gun; Cheng, Chi\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTwo yellow bacterial strains, designated NBD5(T) and NBD8, isolated from Noni (Morinda citrifolia L.) branch were investigated using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Cells were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile and short rod-shaped. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that the strains were members of a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, the seven closest neighbours being Sphingomonas oligoaromativorans SY-6(T) (96.9% similarity), Sphingomonas polyaromaticivorans B2-7(T) (95.8%), Sphingomonas yantingensis 1007(T) (94.9%), Sphingomonas sanguinis IFO 13937(T) (94.7%), Sphingomonas ginsenosidimutans Gsoil 1429(T) (94.6%), Sphingomonas wittichii RW1(T) (94.6%) and Sphingomonas formosensis CC-Nfb-2(T) (94.5%). Strains NBD5T and NBD8 had sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine as the major polar lipids, ubiquinone 10 as the predominant respiratory quinone, and sym-homospermidine as the major polyamine. Strains NBD5(T) and NBD8 were clearly distinguished from reference type strains based on phylogenetic analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, fatty acid composition data analysis, and comparison of a range of physiological and biochemical characteristics. It is evident from the genotypic and phenotypic data that strains NBD5(T) and NBD8 represent a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas morindae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NBD5(T) (â= DSM 29151(T) = KCTC 42183(T) = CICC 10879(T)).\n\nAromatic-degrading Sphingomonas isolates from the deep subsurface\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFredrickson, J.K.; Romine, M.F.; Balkwill, D.L.\n\nAn obligately aerobic chemoheterotrophic bacterium (strain F199) previously isolated from Southeast Coastal Plain subsurface sediments and shown to degrade toluene, naphthalene, and other aromatic compounds was characterized by analysis of its 16S rRNA nucleotide base sequence and cellular lipid composition. Strain F199 contained 2-OH14:0 and 18:1{omega}7c as the predominant cellular fatty acids and sphingolipids that are characteristic of the genus Sphingomonas. Phylogenetic analysis of its 16SrRNA sequence indicated that F199 was most closely related to Sphingomonas capsulata among the bacteria currently in the Ribosomal Database. Five additional isolates from deep Southeast Coastal Plain sediments were determined by 16S rRNA sequencemoreÂ Â» analysis to be closely related to F199. These strains also contained characteristic sphingolipids. Four of these five strains could also grow on a broad range of aromatic compounds and could mineralize [{sup 14C}]toluene and [{sup 14C}]naphthalene. S. capsulata (ATCC 14666), Sphingomonas paucimobiolis (ATCC 29837), and one of the subsurface isolates were unable to grow on any of the aromatic compounds or mineralize toluene or naphthalene. These results indicate that bacteria within the genus Sphingomonas are present in Southeast Coastal Plain subsurface sediments and that the capacity for degrading a broad range of substituted aromatic compounds appears to be common among Sphingomonas species from this environment. 41 refs., 2 figs., 5 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nOccurrence and Phylogenetic Diversity of Sphingomonas Strains in Soils Contaminated with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeys, Natalie M. E. J.; Ryngaert, Annemie; Bastiaens, Leen; Verstraete, Willy; Top, Eva M.; Springael, Dirk\n\n2004-01-01\n\nBacterial strains of the genus Sphingomonas are often isolated from contaminated soils for their ability to use polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as the sole source of carbon and energy. The direct detection of Sphingomonas strains in contaminated soils, either indigenous or inoculated, is, as such, of interest for bioremediation purposes. In this study, a culture-independent PCR-based detection method using specific primers targeting the Sphingomonas 16S rRNA gene combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was developed to assess Sphingomonas diversity in PAH-contaminated soils. PCR using the new primer pair on a set of template DNAs of different bacterial genera showed that the method was selective for bacteria belonging to the family Sphingomonadaceae. Single-band DGGE profiles were obtained for most Sphingomonas strains tested. Strains belonging to the same species had identical DGGE fingerprints, and in most cases, these fingerprints were typical for one species. Inoculated strains could be detected at a cell concentration of 104 CFU g of soilâ1. The analysis of Sphingomonas population structures of several PAH-contaminated soils by the new PCR-DGGE method revealed that soils containing the highest phenanthrene concentrations showed the lowest Sphingomonas diversity. Sequence analysis of cloned PCR products amplified from soil DNA revealed new 16S rRNA gene Sphingomonas sequences significantly different from sequences from known cultivated isolates (i.e., sequences from environmental clones grouped phylogenetically with other environmental clone sequences available on the web and that possibly originated from several potential new species). In conclusion, the newly designed Sphingomonas-specific PCR-DGGE detection technique successfully analyzed the Sphingomonas communities from polluted soils at the species level and revealed different Sphingomonas members not previously detected by culture-dependent detection techniques. PMID\n\nDetection and Characterization of Conjugative Degradative Plasmids in Xenobiotic-Degrading Sphingomonas Strains\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBasta, Tamara; Keck, Andreas; Klein, Joachim; Stolz, Andreas\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA systematic survey for the presence of plasmids in 17 different xenobiotic-degrading Sphingomonas strains was performed. In almost all analyzed strains, two to five plasmids with sizes of about 50 to 500 kb were detected by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A comparison of plasmid preparations untreated or treated with S1 nuclease suggested that, in general, Sphingomonas plasmids are circular. Hybridization experiments with labeled gene probes suggested that large plasmids are involved in the degradation of dibenzo-p-dioxin, dibenzofuran, and naphthalenesulfonates in S. wittichii RW1, Sphingomonas sp. HH69, and S. xenophaga BN6, respectively. The plasmids which are responsible for the degradation of naphthalene, biphenyl, and toluene by S. aromaticivorans F199 (pNL1) and of naphthalenesulfonates by S. xenophaga BN6 (pBN6) were site-specifically labeled with a kanamycin resistance cassette. The conjugative transfer of these labeled plasmids was attempted with various bacterial strains as putative recipient strains. Thus, a conjugative transfer of plasmid pBN6 from S. xenophaga BN6 to a cured mutant of strain BN6 and to Sphingomonas sp. SS3 was observed. The conjugation experiments with plasmid pNL1 suggested a broader host range of this plasmid, because it was transferred without any obvious structural changes to S. yanoikuyae B1, Sphingomonas sp. SS3, and S. herbicidovorans. In contrast, major plasmid rearrangements were observed in the transconjugants after the transfer of plasmid pNL1 to Sphingomonas sp. HH69 and of pBN6 to Sphingomonas sp. SS3. No indications for the transfer of a Sphingomonas plasmid to bacteria outside of the Sphingomonadaceae were obtained.

Strain CH15-11(T) grew optimally at pH 7 and 28-30 Â°C. According to a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain CH15-11(T) belonged to the genus Sphingomonas and clustered with Sphingomonas sediminicola Dae 20(T), with which it shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (97.6â%). Chemotaxonomic analysis showed that strain CH15-11(T) had characteristics typical of members of the genus Sphingomonas, such as the presence of sphingoglycolipid, ubiquinone Q-10 and sym-homospermidine. Plus, strain CH15-11(T) included summed feature 8 (C18â:â1Ï7c and/or C18â:â1Ï6c) and C16â:â0 as the major fatty acids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 65.6 mol%. Sequence data showed that strain CH15-11(T) was most closely related to Sphingomonas sediminicola Dae 20(T) (97.6â%), Sphingomonas ginsengisoli Gsoil 634(T) (97.2â%) and http://www.genebank.go.kr/eng/microbe/microbe_search_view.jsp?sStrainsn=4602Sphingomonas jaspi TDMA-16(T) (97.0â%). However, the DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain CH15-11(T) and the most closely related type strains were within a range of 35-59â%. Thus, based on the phylogenetic, phenotypic and genetic data, strain CH15-11(T) was classified as a member of the genus Sphingomonas as a representative of a novel species, for which the name Sphingomonas daechungensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CH15-11(T) (â=âKCTC 23718(T)â=âJCM 17887(T)).\n\nSphingomonas rhizophila sp. nov., isolated from rhizosphere of Hibiscus syriacus.\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Zheng-Fei; Lin, Pei; Won, Kyung-Hwa; Li, Chang-Tian; Park, GyungSoo; Chin, ByungSun; Kook, MooChang; Wang, Qi-Jun; Yi, Tae-Hoo\n\n2018-02-01\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile, rod-shaped, catalase-positive and oxidase-positive bacteria (THG-T61 T ), was isolated from rhizosphere of Hibiscus syriacus.

The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain THG-T61 T and its closest reference strains were less than 49.2â%, which is lower than the threshold value of 70â%. Therefore, strain THG-T61 T represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas rhizophila sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is THG-T61 T (=KACC 19189 T =CCTCC AB 2016245 T ).\n\nCharacterization of Sphingomonas isolates from Finnish and Swedish drinking water distribution systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoskinen, R; Ali-Vehmas, T; KÃ¤mpfer, P; Laurikkala, M; Tsitko, I; Kostyal, E; Atroshi, F; Salkinoja-Salonen, M\n\n2000-10-01\n\nSphingomonas species were commonly isolated from biofilms in drinking water distribution systems in Finland (three water meters) and Sweden (five water taps in different buildings). The Sphingomonas isolates (n = 38) were characterized by chemotaxonomic, physiological and phylogenetic methods. Fifteen isolates were designated to species Sphingomonas aromaticivorans, seven isolates to S. subterranea, two isolates to S. xenophaga and one isolate to S. stygia. Thirteen isolates represented one or more new species of Sphingomonas. Thirty-three isolates out of 38 grew at 5 degrees C on trypticase soy broth agar (TSBA) and may therefore proliferate in the Nordic drinking water pipeline where the temperature typically ranges from 2 to 12 degrees C. Thirty-three isolates out of 38 grew at 37 degrees C on TSBA and 15 isolates also grew on blood agar at 37 degrees C. Considering the potentially pathogenic features of sphingomonas, their presence in drinking water distribution systems may not be desirable.\n\nDescription of a Gram-negative bacterium, Sphingomonas guangdongensis sp. nov.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeng, Guang-Da; Yang, Song-Zhen; Wang, Yong-Hong; Zhang, Xiu-Xiu; Zhao, Guo-Zhen; Deng, Ming-Rong; Zhu, Hong-Hui\n\n2014-05-01\n\nA Gram-stain-negative bacterial strain, designated 9NM-8T, was isolated from an abandoned lead-zinc ore in Mei county, Meizhou, Guangdong province, PR China. The isolate was orange-pigmented, aerobic, oxidase- and catalase-positive, motile with lophotrichous flagella and rod-shaped. Strain 9NM-8T grew optimally at pH 7.0 and 30 Â°C and in the absence of NaCl on R2A agar. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain 9NM-8T belongs to the genus Sphingomonas, with highest sequence similarities to Sphingomonas azotifigens KACC 14484T (96.1%), Sphingomonas trueperi DSM 7225T (96.0%) and Sphingomonas pituitosa DSM 13101T (95.6â%). Strain 9NM-8T contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone. The major fatty acids included C18:1Ï7c, C16:0, C16:1Ï7c and/or C16â:â1Ï6c (summed feature 3) and 11-methyl C18:1Ï7c. The DNA G+C content was 69.6Â±1.3 mol%. The major component in the polyamine pattern was sym-homospermidine and the polar lipid profile contained sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, an unidentified glycolipid and two unidentified phospholipids. Based on comparative analysis of physiological, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain 9NM-8T should be considered to represent a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas guangdongensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 9NM-8T (=GIMCC 1.653T=CGMCC 1.12672T=DSM 27570T).\n\nEcology, physiology, and phylogeny of deep subsurface Sphingomonas sp.\n\nPubMed\n\nFredrickson, J K; Balkwill, D L; Romine, M F; Shi, T\n\n1999-10-01\n\nSeveral new species of the genus Sphingomonas including S. aromaticivorans, S. stygia, and S. subterranea that have the capacity for degrading a broad range of aromatic compounds including toluene, naphthalene, xylenes, p-cresol, fluorene, biphenyl, and dibenzothiophene, were isolated from deeply-buried (>200 m) sediments of the US Atlantic coastal plain (ACP). In S. aromaticivorans F199, many of the genes involved in the catabolism of these aromatic compounds are encoded on a 184-kb conjugative plasmid; some of the genes involved in aromatic catabolism are plasmid-encoded in the other strains as well. Members of the genus Sphingomonas were common among aerobic heterotrophic bacteria cultured from ACP sediments and have been detected in deep subsurface environments elsewhere. The major source of organic carbon for heterotrophic metabolism in ACP deep aquifers is lignite that originated from plant material buried with the sediments. We speculate that the ability of the subsurface Sphingomonas strains to degrade a wide array of aromatic compounds represents an adaptation for utilization of sedimentary lignite. These and related subsurface Sphingomonas spp may play an important role in the transformation of sedimentary organic carbon in the aerobic and microaerobic regions of the deep aquifers of the ACP.\n\nEcology, physiology, and phylogeny of deep subsurface Sphingomonas sp.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nFredrickson, Jim K.; Balkwill, David L.; Romine, Margaret F.\n\nSeveral new species of the genus Sphingomonas including S. aromaticivorans, S. stygia, and S. subterranea that have the capacity for degrading a broad range of aromatic compounds including toluene, naphthalene, xylenes, p-cresol, fluorene, biphenyl, and dibenzothiophene, were isolated from deeply-buried (>200 m) sediments of the US Atlantic coastal plain (ACP).

Strain 200 T grew optimally at pH 7.0 and in the absence of NaCl on R2A. Its optimum growth temperature was 20âÂ°C. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 200 T belonged to the genus Sphingomonas. Strain 200 T showed the highest sequence similarities to Sphingomonas kyeonggiense THG-DT81 T (95.1â%) and Sphingomonas molluscorum KMM 3882 T (95.1â%). Chemotaxonomic analysis showed that strain 200 T had characteristics typical of members of the genus Sphingomonas. Ubiquinone 10 was the predominant respiratory quinone and sym-homospermidine was the polyamine. The major polar lipids were sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. The G+Câcontent of the genomic DNA was determined to be 60.9âmol%.

On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, and physiological and biochemical characterization, strain 200 T should be classiï¬ed as representing a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonasantarctica sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 200 T (=CCTCCâAB 2016064 T =KCTC 52488 T ).\n\nProposal of the genus Sphingomonas sensu stricto and three new genera, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium and Sphingopyxis, on the basis of phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analyses.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakeuchi, M; Hamana, K; Hiraishi, A\n\n2001-07-01\n\nPhylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences by distance matrix and parsimony methods indicated that the currently known species of the genus Sphingomonas can be divided into four clusters. Some chemotaxonomic and phenotypic differences were noted among these clusters. Three new genera, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium and Sphingopyxis, are proposed in addition to the genus Sphingomonas sensu stricto. The genus Sphingobium is proposed to accommodate Sphingomonas chlorophenolica, Sphingomonas herbicidovorans and Sphingomonas yanoikuyae. The genus Novosphingobium is proposed for Sphingomonas aromaticivorans, Sphingomonas capsulata, Sphingomonas rosa, Sphingomonas stygia, Sphingomonas subarctica and Sphingomonas subterranea. Sphingomonas macrogoltabidus and Sphingomonas terrae are reclassified in the genus Sphingopyxis. The type species of Sphingobium, Novosphingobium and Sphingopyxis are Sphingobium yanoikuyae, Novosphingobium capsulatum and Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida, respectively.\n\nSphingomonas carri sp. nov., isolated from a car air-conditioning system.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Hyosun; Kim, Dong-Uk; Lee, Suyeon; Yun, Jungpyo; Park, Sooyeon; Yoon, Jung-Hoon; Park, So Yoon; Ka, Jong-Ok\n\n2017-10-01\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, yellow-pigmented bacterial strain, designated PR0302 T , was isolated from a car evaporator core collected in Korea. The cells were strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming and rod-shaped. The strain grew at 15-37âÂ°C (optimum, 25âÂ°C), at pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum, 7.0) and in the presence of 0-1â% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetically, the strain was closely related to members of the genus Sphingomonas(97.04-91.22â% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities) and showed the highest sequence similarity of 97.04â% to Sphingomonas kyeonggiensis THG-DT81 T . It contained C16â:â0, summed feature 8 (C18â:â1Ï7c and/or C18â:â1Ï6c) and C14â:â0 2-OH as the predominant fatty acids and Q-10 as the major ubiquinone. The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and sphingoglycolipid. The major polyamine was sym-homospermidine. The serine palmitoyl transferase gene (spt) was detected and sphingolipid synthesis was confirmed. The mean DNA G+C content of the strain was 67.8Â±0.5âmol%. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain PR0302 T and closely related type strains of Sphingomonas species was less than 30â%. The low levels of DNA-DNA relatedness identified strain PR0302 T as a member of a novel species in the genus Sphingomonas. Based on phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic data, strain PR0302 T represents a novel species in the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas carri sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is PR0302 T (=KACC 18487 T =NBRC 111532 T ).\n\nSphingomonas jatrophae sp. nov. and Sphingomonas carotinifaciens sp. nov., two yellow-pigmented endophytes isolated from stem tissues of Jatropha curcas L.\n\nPubMed\n\nMadhaiyan, Munusamy; Alex, Tan Hian Hwee; Cho, Hayoung; Kim, Soo-Jin; Weon, Hang-Yeon; Kwon, Soon-Wo; Whitman, William B; Ji, Lianghui\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTwo yellow-pigmented isolates, S5-249 T and L9-754 T , originating from surface-sterilized plant tissues of Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) cultivars were characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Strains S5-249 T and L9-754 T had 16S rRNA genes sharing 94.2â% sequence similarity with each other and 91.6-97.2â% sequence similarity with those of other species in the genus Sphingomonas, suggesting that they represent two potentially novel species. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains S5-249 T and L9-754 T shared the highest similarity to that of Sphingomonas sanguinis NBRC 13937 T (96.1 and 97.2â%, respectively). The genomic DNA G+Câcontents of strains S5-249 T and L9-754 T were 66.9 and 68.5âmol%, respectively. The respiratory quinone was determined to be Q-10, and the major polyamine was homospermidine. Strains S5-249 T and L9-754 T contained summed feature 7 (comprising C18â:â1Ï7c, C18â:â1Ï9t and/or C18â:â1Ï12t), C16â:â1, C14â:â0 2-OH and summed feature 4 (C16â:â1Ï7t, iso-C15â:â0 2-OH and C16â:â1Ï7c) as the major cellular fatty acids. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingoglycolipid. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between S. sanguinis NBRC 13937 T and the two type strains (S5-249 T and L9-754 T ) were 72.31 and 77.73â%, respectively. Digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) studies between the novel strains (S5-249 T and L9-754 T ) and other species of the genus Sphingomonas were well below the thresholds used to discriminate between bacterial species. The results of dDDH and physiological tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the strains from each other as well as from the species of the genus Sphingomonas with validly published names. These data strongly support the classification of the strains as representatives of novel species, for which we propose the names Sphingomonas jatrophae sp. nov\n\nSphingomonas psychrolutea sp. nov., a psychrotolerant bacterium isolated from glacier ice.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Qing; Liu, Hong-Can; Zhang, Jian-Li; Zhou, Yu-Guang; Xin, Yu-Hua\n\n2015-09-01\n\nA Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, orange bacterium (strain MDB1-A(T)) was isolated from ice samples collected from Midui glacier in Tibet, south-west China. Cells were aerobic and psychrotolerant (growth occurred at 0-25 Â°C). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that it was a member of the genus Sphingomonas, with its closest relative being Sphingomonas glacialis C16y(T) (98.9% similarity). Q-10 was the predominant ubiquinone. C17 : 1Ï6c and summed feature 8 (C18 : 1Ï6c and/or C18 : 1Ï7c) were the major cellular fatty acids. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingoglycolipid. The polyamines detected were sym-homospermidine, spermidine and spermine. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 63.6%. Based on data from this polyphasic analysis, strain MDB1-A(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas psychrolutea sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MDB1-A(T) (â= CGMCC 1.10106(T) = NBRC 109639(T)).\n\nDescription of chlorophenol-degrading Pseudomonas sp. strains KF1T, KF3, and NKF1 as a new species of the genus Sphingomonas, Sphingomonas subarctica sp. nov.\n\nPubMed\n\nNohynek, L J; Nurmiaho-Lassila, E L; Suhonen, E L; Busse, H J; Mohammadi, M; Hantula, J; Rainey, F; Salkinoja-Salonen, M S\n\n1996-10-01\n\nGram-negative polychlorophenol-degrading bacterial strains KF1T (T = type strain), KF3, and NKF1, which were described previously as Pseudomonas saccharophila strains, were studied by chemotaxonomic, genetic, and physiological methods and by electron microscopy and compared with selected xenobiotic compound-degrading bacteria. These strains contained sphingolipids with d-18:0, d-20:1, and d-21:1 as the main dihydrosphingosines, ubiquinone 10 as the main respiratory quinone, and spermidine as the major polyamine, and the DNA G + C content was 66 mol%. The cellular fatty acids included about 60% octadecenoic acid, 9% 2-hydroxymyristic acid, 14% cis-9-hexadecenoic acid, and 10% hexadecanoic acid. These strains exhibited less than 97% 16S ribosomal DNA sequence similarity to all of the other taxa studied. In the DNA-DNA reassociation studies the highest levels of reassociation between these strains and previously described species were less than 40%. Thin sections of cells of strains KF1T, KF3, and NKF1 were examined by electron microscopy, and the results showed that the cells had peculiar concentrically arranged layered membranous blebs that extruded from the outer membrane, especially at the cell division points. On the basis of the results of this study, polychlorophenol-degrading strains KF1T, KF3, and NKF1 are considered members of a new species of the genus Sphingomonas, Sphingomonas subarctica. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading organism Sphingomonas paucimobilis EPA 505 was closely related to Sphingomonas chlorophenolica as determined by chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and physiological criteria. The xenobiotic compound degraders Alcaligenes sp. strain A175 and Pseudomonas sp. strain BN6 were identified as members of species of the genus Sphingomonas.\n\nChanges to the structure of Sphingomonas spp. communities associated with biodegradation of the herbicide isoproturon in soil.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Shengjing; Bending, Gary D\n\n2007-04-01\n\nThe phenyl-urea herbicide isoproturon is a major contaminant of surface and ground-water in agricultural catchments. Earlier work suggested that within-field spatial variation of isoproturon degradation rate resulted from interactions between catabolizing Sphingomonas spp. and pH. In the current study, changes to the structure of Sphingomonas communities during isoproturon catabolism were investigated using Sphingomonas-specific 16S rRNA gene primers. Growth-linked catabolism at high-pH (>7.5) sites was associated with the appearance of multiple new denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands. At low-pH sites, there was no change in DGGE banding at sites in which there was cometabolism, but at sites in which there was growth-linked catabolism, degradation was associated with the appearance of a new band not present at high pH sites. Sequencing of DGGE bands indicated that a strain related to Sphingomonas mali proliferated at low pH sites, while strain Sphingomonas sp. SRS2, a catabolic strain identified in earlier work, together with several further Sphingomonas spp., proliferated at high-pH sites. The data indicate that degradation was associated with complex changes to the structure of Sphingomonas spp. communities, the precise nature of which was spatially variable.\n\nClassification of Rhizomonas suberifaciens, an unnamed Rhizomonas species, and Sphingomonas spp. in rRNA superfamily IV.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Bruggen, A H; Jochimsen, K N; Steinberger, E M; Segers, P; Gillis, M\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThermal melting profiles of hybrids between 3H-labeled rRNA of Rhizomonas suberifaciens, the causal agent of corky root of lettuce, and chromosomal DNAs from 27 species of gram-negative bacteria indicated that the genus Rhizomonas belongs to superfamily IV of De Ley. On the basis of the melting temperatures of DNA hybrids with rRNAs from the type strains of R. suberifaciens, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, and Sphingomonas capsulata, Rhizomonas strains constitute a separate branch in superfamily IV, which is closely related to but separate from branches containing Zymomonas mobilis, Sphingomonas spp., and S. capsulata. Sphingomonas yanoikuyae and Rhizomonas sp. strain WI4 are located toward the base of the Rhizomonas rRNA branch. DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that S. yanoikuyae is equidistant from Rhizomonas sp. strain WI4 and S. paucimobilis. Sequences of 270 bp of 16S ribosomal DNAs from eight strains of Rhizomonas spp., eight strains of Sphingomonas spp., and Agrobacterium tumefaciens indicated that S. yanoikuyae and Rhizomonas sp. strains WI4 and CA16 are genetically more closely related to R. suberifaciens than to Sphingomonas spp. Thus, S. yanoikuyae may need to be transferred to the genus Rhizomonas on the basis of the results of further study.\n\nComparative genomic analysis of 26 Sphingomonas and Sphingobium strains: Dissemination of bioremediation capabilities, biodegradation potential and horizontal gene transfer.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Qiang; Yue, Shengjie; Bilal, Muhammad; Hu, Hongbo; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Xuehong\n\n2017-12-31\n\nBacteria belonging to the genera Sphingomonas and Sphingobium are known for their ability to catabolize aromatic compounds. In this study, we analyzed the whole genome sequences of 26 strains in the genera Sphingomonas and Sphingobium to gain insight into dissemination of bioremediation capabilities, biodegradation potential, central pathways and genome plasticity. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both Sphingomonas sp. strain BHC-A and Sphingomonas paucimobilis EPA505 should be placed in the genus Sphingobium. The bph and xyl gene cluster was found in 6 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons-degrading strains. Transposase and IS coding genes were found in the 6 gene clusters, suggesting the mobility of bph and xyl gene clusters. Î²-ketoadipate and homogentisate pathways were the main central pathways in Sphingomonas and Sphingobium strains. A large number of oxygenase coding genes were predicted in the 26 genomes, indicating a huge biodegradation potential of the Sphingomonas and Sphingobium strains. Horizontal gene transfer related genes and prophages were predicted in the analyzed strains, suggesting the ongoing evolution and shaping of the genomes. Analysis of the 26 genomes in this work contributes to the understanding of dispersion of bioremediation capabilities, bioremediation potential and genome plasticity in strains belonging to the genera Sphingomonas and Sphingobium.

Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain X1(T) was a member of the genus Sphingomonas and shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Sphingomonas oligophenolica JCM 12082(T) (96.9%), followed by Sphingomonas glacialis CGMCC 1.8957(T) (96.7%) and Sphingomonas alpina DSM 22537(T) (96.4%). Strain X1(T) was able to grow at 15-30 Â°C, pH 6.0-10.0 and with 0-0.3% NaCl (w/v). The DNA G+C content of the isolate was 64.8 mol%. Strain X1(T)-contained Q-10 as the dominant ubiquinone and C(18:1)Ï7c, C(16:1)Ï7c, C(16:0) and C(14:0) 2-OH as the dominant fatty acids. The polar lipid profile of strain XI(T)-contained sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified glycolipid and two unidentified phospholipid. Due to the phenotypic and genetic distinctiveness and other characteristic studied in this article, we consider X1(T) as a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas and propose to name it Sphingomonas qilianensis sp. nov. The type strain is X1(T) (=CGMCC 1.15349(T) = KCTC 42862(T)).\n\nSphingomonas frigidaeris sp. nov., isolated from an air conditioning system.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Yunho; Jeon, Che Ok\n\n2017-10-01\n\nA strictly aerobic Gram-stain-negative bacterium, designated strain KER25-10 T , was isolated from a laboratory air conditioning system in South Korea. Cells were yellow-pigmented, non-motile rods showing catalase- and oxidase-positive reactions. The strain grew at pH 4.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 6.0-7.0) and 10-40âÂ°C (optimum, 30âÂ°C) and in the presence of 0-3â% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0â%). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 65.1âmol%. Strain KER25-10 T contained ubiquinone-10 (Q-10) as the predominant isoprenoid quinone and C16â:â0, C17â:â1Ï6c, summed feature 3 (comprising C16â:â1Ï7c and/or C16â:â1Ï6c) and summed feature 8 (comprising C18â:â1Ï7c and/or C18â:â1Ï6c) as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids were sphingoglycolipid, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. Only spermidine was detected as the polyamine. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA sequences indicated that strain KER25-10 T formed a distinct phylogenetic lineage within the genus Sphingomonas of the family Sphingomonadaceae and the strain was most closely related to Sphingomonas kyeonggiense THG-DT81 T with a 96.8â% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular features, strain KER25-10 T clearly represents a novel species of the genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas frigidaeris sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is KER25-10 T (=KACC 19285 T =JCM 32053 T ).\n\nIsolation and characterization of diesel degrading bacteria, Sphingomonas sp. and Acinetobacter junii from petroleum contaminated soil\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Qiuzhuo; Wang, Duanchao; Li, Mengmeng; Xiang, Wei-Ning; Achal, Varenyam\n\n2014-03-01\n\nTwo indigenous bacteria of petroleum contaminated soil were characterized to utilize diesel fuel as the sole carbon and energy sources in this work. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis identified these bacteria as Sphingomonas sp. and Acinetobacter junii. The ability to degrade diesel fuel has been demonstrated for the first time by these isolates. The results of IR analyses showed that Sphingomonas sp. VA1 and A. junii VA2 degraded up to 82.6% and 75.8% of applied diesel over 15 days, respectively. In addition, Sphingomonas sp. VA1 possessed the higher cellular hydrophobicities of 94% for diesel compared to 81% by A. junii VA2. The isolates Sphingomonas sp. VA1 and A. junii VA2 exhibited 24% and 18%, respectively emulsification activity. This study reports two new diesel degrading bacterial species, which can be effectively used for bioremediation of petroleum contaminated sites.\n\nGrowth in coculture stimulates metabolism of the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS2.\n\nPubMed\n\nSÃ¸rensen, Sebastian R; Ronen, Zeev; Aamand, Jens\n\n2002-07-01\n\nMetabolism of the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS2 was significantly enhanced when the strain was grown in coculture with a soil bacterium (designated strain SRS1). Both members of this consortium were isolated from a highly enriched isoproturon-degrading culture derived from an agricultural soil previously treated regularly with the herbicide. Based on analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, strain SRS1 was assigned to the beta-subdivision of the proteobacteria and probably represents a new genus. Strain SRS1 was unable to degrade either isoproturon or its known metabolites 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1-methylurea, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-urea, or 4-isopropyl-aniline. Pure culture studies indicate that Sphingomonas sp. SRS2 is auxotrophic and requires components supplied by association with other soil bacteria. A specific mixture of amino acids appeared to meet these requirements, and it was shown that methionine was essential for Sphingomonas sp. SRS2. This suggests that strain SRS1 supplies amino acids to Sphingomonas sp. SRS2, thereby leading to rapid metabolism of (14)C-labeled isoproturon to (14)CO(2) and corresponding growth of strain SRS2. Proliferation of strain SRS1 suggests that isoproturon metabolism by Sphingomonas sp. SRS2 provides unknown metabolites or cell debris that supports growth of strain SRS1. The role of strain SRS1 in the consortium was not ubiquitous among soil bacteria; however, the indigenous soil microflora and some strains from culture collections also stimulate isoproturon metabolism by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS2 to a similar extent.\n\nGrowth in Coculture Stimulates Metabolism of the Phenylurea Herbicide Isoproturon by Sphingomonas sp. Strain SRS2\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSÃ¸rensen, Sebastian R.; Ronen, Zeev; Aamand, Jens\n\n2002-01-01\n\nMetabolism of the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS2 was significantly enhanced when the strain was grown in coculture with a soil bacterium (designated strain SRS1). Both members of this consortium were isolated from a highly enriched isoproturon-degrading culture derived from an agricultural soil previously treated regularly with the herbicide. Based on analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, strain SRS1 was assigned to the Î²-subdivision of the proteobacteria and probably represents a new genus. Strain SRS1 was unable to degrade either isoproturon or its known metabolites 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1-methylurea, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-urea, or 4-isopropyl-aniline. Pure culture studies indicate that Sphingomonas sp. SRS2 is auxotrophic and requires components supplied by association with other soil bacteria. A specific mixture of amino acids appeared to meet these requirements, and it was shown that methionine was essential for Sphingomonas sp. SRS2. This suggests that strain SRS1 supplies amino acids to Sphingomonas sp. SRS2, thereby leading to rapid metabolism of 14C-labeled isoproturon to 14CO2 and corresponding growth of strain SRS2. Proliferation of strain SRS1 suggests that isoproturon metabolism by Sphingomonas sp. SRS2 provides unknown metabolites or cell debris that supports growth of strain SRS1. The role of strain SRS1 in the consortium was not ubiquitous among soil bacteria; however, the indigenous soil microflora and some strains from culture collections also stimulate isoproturon metabolism by Sphingomonas sp. strain SRS2 to a similar extent.

Previous analyses of phyllosphere communities revealed the predominance of few bacterial genera on healthy dicotyl plants, provoking the question of whether these commensals play a particular role in plant protection. Here, we tested two of them, Methylobacterium and Sphingomonas, with respect to their ability to diminish disease symptom formation and the proliferation of the foliar plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 on Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants were grown under gnotobiotic conditions in the absence or presence of the potential antagonists and then challenged with the pathogen. No effect of Methylobacterium strains on disease development was observed. However, members of the genus Sphingomonas showed a striking plant-protective effect by suppressing disease symptoms and diminishing pathogen growth. A survey of different Sphingomonas strains revealed that most plant isolates protected A. thaliana plants from developing severe disease symptoms. This was not true for Sphingomonas strains isolated from air, dust, or water, even when they reached cell densities in the phyllosphere comparable to those of the plant isolates. This suggests that plant protection is common among plant-colonizing Sphingomonas spp. but is not a general trait conserved within the genus Sphingomonas. The carbon source profiling of representative isolates revealed differences between protecting and nonprotecting strains, suggesting that substrate competition plays a role in plant protection by Sphingomonas. However, other mechanisms cannot be excluded at this time. In conclusion, the ability to protect plants as shown here in a model system may be an unexplored, common trait of indigenous Sphingomonas spp. and may be of relevance under natural conditions.

The nitrogen-fixing abilities of these strains were confirmed by acetylene reduction assay and nifH gene detection. The three strains were found to be very closely related, with 99.9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and greater than 70 % DNA-DNA hybridization values, suggesting that the three strains represent a single species. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the strains were closely related to Sphingomonas trueperi, with 99.5 % similarity. The chemotaxonomic characteristics (G+C content of the DNA of 68.0 mol%, ubiquinone Q-10 system, 2-OH as the only hydroxy fatty acid and homospermidine as the sole polyamine) were similar to those of members of the genus Sphingomonas. Based on DNA-DNA hybridization values and physiological characteristics, the three novel strains could be differentiated from other recognized species of the genus Sphingomonas. The name Sphingomonas azotifigens sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate these bacterial strains; the type strain is Y39T (=NBRC 15497T = IAM 15283T = CCTCC AB205007T).\n\nSphingomonas kyeonggiense sp. nov., isolated from soil of a ginseng field.\n\nPubMed\n\nSon, Heung-Min; Kook, Moochang; Tran, Hanh T H; Kim, Ki-Young; Park, Sang-Yong; Kim, Ju-Han; Yi, Tae-Hoo\n\n2014-04-01\n\nA Gram-staining negative bacterium, THG-DT81(T), which was isolated from soil of a ginseng field, was investigated using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Cells were oxidase- and catalase-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped and motile with one polar flagellum. Strain THG-DT81(T) grew optimally at pH 7.0 and in the absence of NaCl on trypticase soy agar. Its optimum growth temperature was 25-28 Â°C. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain THG-DT81(T) belongs to the family Sphingomonadaceae and was related to Sphingomonas pituitosa EDIV(T) (98.0 % similarity), S. leidyi ATCC 15260(T) (97.8 %), S. trueperi LMG 2142(T) (97.1 %), S. azotifigens NBRC 15497(T) (97.1 %), S. koreensis JSS26 (T) (97.1 %) and S. dokdonensis DS-4(T) (97.0 %). Strain THG-DT81(T) contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone and C18:1 Ï7c and C16:0 as the major fatty acids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 66.8 mol %. The major component in the polyamine pattern was identified as sym-homospermidine. The major polar lipids detected in strain THG-DT81(T) were sphingoglycolipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of the strain THG-DT81(T) and its closest phylogenetically neighbors were below 21 %. The phenotypic characteristics and genotypic data demonstrated the affiliation of strain THG-DT81(T) to the genus Sphingomonas. On the basis of the polyphasic taxonomic data presented, strain THG-DT81(T) is described as a novel species of genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas kyeonggiense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is THG-DT81(T) (= KACC 17173(T) = JCM 18825(T)).\n\nHomology between genes for aromatic hydrocarbon degradation in surface and deep-subsurface sphingomonas strains\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKim, E.; Aversano, P.J.; Zylstra, G.J.\n\nThe cloned genes for aromatic hydrocarbon degradation from Sphingomonas yanoikuyae B1 were utilized in Southern hybridization experiments with Sphingomonas strains from the surface and deep-subsurface environments. One hybridization pattern was obtained with BamHI-digested genomic DNAs for two surface strains, while a differing pattern was seen for five deep-subsurface strains. The cross-hybridizing genes were located in the chromosomes of the surface strains and on plasmids in the deep-subsurface strains. 31 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.\n\nMicrobial Degradation of Chlorogenic Acid by a Sphingomonas sp. Strain.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, Yuping; Wang, Xiaoyu; Nie, Xueling; Zhang, Zhan; Yang, Zongcan; Nie, Cong; Tang, Hongzhi\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIn order to elucidate the metabolism of chlorogenic acid by environmental microbes, a strain of Sphingomonas sp. isolated from tobacco leaves was cultured under various conditions, and chlorogenic acid degradation and its metabolites were investigated. The strain converting chlorogenic acid was newly isolated and identified as a Sphingomonas sp. strain by 16S rRNA sequencing. The optimal conditions for growth and chlorogenic acid degradation were 37Â Â°C and pHÂ 7.0 with supplementation of 1.5Â g/l (NH4)2SO4 as the nitrogen source and 2Â g/l chlorogenic acid as the sole carbon source. The maximum chlorogenic acid tolerating capability for the strain was 5Â g/l. The main metabolites were identified as caffeic acid, shikimic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The analysis reveals the biotransformation mechanism of chlorogenic acid in microbial cells isolated from the environment.\n\nIsolation and characterization of an isoproturon mineralizing Sphingomonas sp. strain SH from a French agricultural soil.\n\nPubMed\n\nHussain, Sabir; Devers-Lamrani, Marion; El Azhari, Najoi; Martin-Laurent, Fabrice\n\n2011-06-01\n\nThe phenylurea herbicide isoproturon, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (IPU), was found to be rapidly mineralized in an agricultural soil in France that had been periodically exposed to IPU. Enrichment cultures from samples of this soil isolated a bacterial strain able to mineralize IPU. 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that this strain belonged to the phylogeny of the genus Sphingomonas (96% similarity with Sphingomonas sp. JEM-14, AB219361) and was designated Sphingomonas sp. strain SH. From this strain, a partial sequence of a 1,2-dioxygenase (catA) gene coding for an enzyme degrading catechol putatively formed during IPU mineralization was amplified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the catA sequence was related to Sphingomonas spp. and showed a lack of congruence between the catA and 16S rRNA based phylogenies, implying horizontal gene transfer of the catA gene cluster between soil microbiota. The IPU degrading ability of strain SH was strongly influenced by pH with maximum degradation taking place at pH 7.5. SH was only able to mineralize IPU and its known metabolites including 4-isopropylaniline and it could not degrade other structurally related phenylurea herbicides such as diuron, linuron, monolinuron and chlorotoluron or their aniline derivatives. These observations suggest that the catabolic abilities of the strain SH are highly specific to the metabolism of IPU.\n\nMonitoring of biofilm aging in a Sphingomonas sp. strain from public drinking water sites through changes in capacitance.\n\nPubMed\n\nGulati, Parul; Singh, Pawandeep; Chatterjee, Arun Kumar; Ghosh, Moushumi\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis study reports the applicability of a capacitance-based technique for evaluating the biofilm progression of Sphingomonas sp. One hundred and forty isolates of Sphingomonas were screened from public drinking water sites, and one potential strain with biofilm-forming ability was used for the study. The biofilm production by this strain was established in microtiter plates and aluminum coupons. The standard biofilm-forming strain Sphingomonas terrae MTCC 7766 was used for comparison. Changes in biofilm were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Capacitance values were measured at 1, 100 and 200â kHz frequency; however, 1â kHz was selected since resulted in reproducible values, which could be correlated to biofilm age measured as dry weight over a time of 96â h (4â days) depicting the biofilm growth/progression over time. The EDX, SEM and capacitance values obtained in parallel indicated the related physiological profile usually displayed by biofilms upon growth, suggesting authenticity to the observed capacitance profile. The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of a capacitance-based method for analyzing biofilm development/progression by Sphingomonas sp. and suggested a simple approach for developing an online system to detect biofilms by this opportunistic pathogen of concern in drinking water.\n\nEnhancement of welan gum production in Sphingomonas sp. HT-1 via heterologous expression of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Xiaoliu; Zhu, Ping; Jiang, Ruifan; Wu, Lingtian; Feng, Xiaohai; Li, Sha; Xu, Hong\n\n2017-01-20\n\nWelan gum is a microbial polysaccharide produced by Sphingomonas sp. Its production is limited by the dissolved oxygen levels in the highly viscous fermentation. A strategy of heterologous expression of the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene in Sphingomonas sp. HT-1 was investigated to alleviate oxygen limitation and improve the yield of welan gum. Ultimately, the welan gum production increased from 25.3g/L to 34.6g/L, whereas the rheological behavior of welan gum solutions remained virtually unchanged. The transcriptional levels of the key genes in the electron transfer chain, TCA cycle and welan gum synthesis pathway, as well as ATP level revealed that the VHb expression in Sphingomonas sp. HT-1 enhanced welan gum biosynthesis by improving respiration and ATP supply. This study would pave the genetic manipulation way for enhancing welan gum yield, and it's also of great importance for the industrial applications of welan gum under harsh conditions.

The isolate was identified by 16s rRNA gene analysis and morphological and physiological characteristics. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that TS001 belongs to the genus Sphingomonas. The model distribution system HPC results showed that, when the chlorine residual was greater than 0.7 mg L(-1), 100% of detected heterotrophic bacteria (HPC) was TS001. The bench-scale inactivation efficiency testing showed that this strain was very resistant to chlorine, and 4 mg L(-1) of chlorine with 240 min retention time provided only approximately 5% viability reduction of TS001. In contrast, a 3-log inactivation (99.9%) was obtained for UV fluencies of 40 mJ cm(-2). A high chlorine-resistant and UV sensitive bacterium, Sphingomonas TS001, was documented for the first time.

LK11 and exogenous trehalose.\n\nPubMed\n\nAsaf, Sajjad; Khan, Abdul Latif; Khan, Muhammad Aaqil; Imran, Qari Muhammad; Yun, Byung-Wook; Lee, In-Jung\n\n2017-12-01\n\nOsmotic stress induced by drought can hinder the growth and yield of crop plants. To understand the eco-physiological role of osmoprotectants, the combined utilization of endophytes and osmolytes (trehalose) can be an ideal strategy used to overcome the adverse effects of drought. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of Sphingomonas sp. LK11, which produces phytohormones and synthesizes trehalose, in improving soybean plant growth under drought-induced osmotic stress (-0.4, -0.9, and -1.2MPa). The results showed that the inoculation of soybean plants with Sphingomonas sp. LK11 significantly increased plant length, dry biomass, photosynthetic pigments, glutathione, amino acids (proline, glycine, and glutamate), and primary sugars as compared to control plants under varying drought stresses. Trehalose applied to the plant with or without endophyte-inoculation also showed similar plant growth-promoting attributes under stress. Stress exposure significantly enhanced endogenous jasmonic (JA) and abscisic (ABA) acid contents in control plants. In contrast, Sphingomonas sp. LK11-inoculation significantly lowered ABA and JA levels in soybean plants, but these phytohormones increased in response to combined treatments during stress. The drought-induced osmotic stress resistance associated with Sphingomonas sp. LK11 and trehalose was also evidenced by increased mRNA gene expression of soybean dehydration responsive element binding protein (DREB)-type transcription factors (GmDREBa and GmDREB2) and the MYB (myeloblastosis) transcription factor (GmMYBJ1) as compared to the control. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that inoculation with this endophyte and trehalose improved the negative effects of drought-induced osmotic stress, and it enhanced soybean plant growth and tolerance.

ATCC 55669 for heterologous overproduction in Escherichia coli\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMa, Tian; Zhou, Yuanjie; Li, Xiaowei; Zhu, Fayin; Cheng, Yongbo; Liu, Yi; Deng, Zixin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAbstract As a highly valued ketoâcarotenoid, astaxanthin is widely used in nutritional supplements and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the demand for biosynthetic astaxanthin and improved efficiency of astaxanthin biosynthesis has driven the investigation of metabolic engineering of native astaxanthin producers and heterologous hosts. However, microbial resources for astaxanthin are limited. In this study, we found that the Î±âProteobacterium Sphingomonas sp. ATCC 55669 could produce astaxanthin naturally. We used wholeâgenome sequencing to identify the astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway using a combined PacBioâIllumina approach. The putative astaxanthin biosynthetic pathway in Sphingomonas sp. ATCC 55669 was predicted. For further confirmation, a highâefficiency targeted engineering carotenoid synthesis platform was constructed in E. coli for identifying the functional roles of candidate genes. All genes involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis showed discrete distributions on the chromosome. Moreover, the overexpression of exogenous E. coli idi in Sphingomonas sp. ATCC 55669 increased astaxanthin production by 5.4âfold. This study described a new astaxanthin producer and provided more biosynthesis components for bioengineering of astaxanthin in the future.

The present study aims to overcome these limitations. Silica nanoparticles (Si NP) were thus functionalized with polyethyleneimine (PEI) and the functionalized silica nanoparticles ( f Si NP) were then integrated with Sphingomonas sp. cells. The process was optimized for hydrolysis of MP into p-nitrophenol (PNP). Integration of f Si NP with cells was confirmed by FT-IR analysis. Biohybrid of Sphingomonas sp.- f Si NP was immobilized on the wells of microplate and associated directly with the optical transducer of microplate reader. Immobilized biohybrid of Sphingomonas sp.- f Si NP was characterized using SEM. A detection range of 0.1-1ppm MP was achieved from the linear range of calibration plot. After integration with f Si NP the storage stability of biohybrid was enhanced ten times from 18 to 180 days. This study proves that after interaction of cells with f Si NP, improved the sensitivity and stability of the biosensor. Spiked samples were also analyzed and correlated using this biohybrid based biosensor. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The isolate grew with both the biaryl ethers dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran (DF) as the sole sources of carbon and energy, showing doubling times of about 8 and 5 h, respectively. Biodegradation of the two aromatic compounds initially proceeded after an oxygenolytic attack at the angular position adjacent to the ether bridge, producing 2,2{prime},3-trihydroxydiphenyl ether or 2,2{prime},3-trihydroxybiphenyl from the initially formed dihydrodiols, which represent extremely unstable hemiacetals. Results obtained from determinations of enzyme activities and oxygenmoreÂ Â» consumption suggest meta cleavage of the trihydroxy compounds. During dibenzofuran degradation, hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-hexa-2,4-dienoate yielded salicylate, which was branched into the catechol meta cleavage pathway and the gentisate pathway. Catechol obtained from the product of meta ring fission of 2,2{prime},3-trihydroxydiphenyl ether was both ortho and meta cleaved by Sphingomonas sp. strain RW1 when this organism was grown with dibenzo-p-dioxin.Â«Â less\n\nGenome mining of astaxanthin biosynthetic genes from Sphingomonas sp.

The bacterium produced copious amounts of an extracellular polysaccharide, forming slimy, viscous, intensely yellow-pigmented colonies on Czapek-Dox (CZD) agar. The culture fluids of the liquid version of CZD medium were highly viscous after cultivation for 5 d. Cells of strain EDIVT were Gram-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, nonspore-forming, rod-shaped and motile. Comparisons of 16S rDNA gene sequences demonstrated that EDIVT clusters phylogenetically with the species of the genus Sphingomonas sensu stricto. The G+C content of the DNA (64.5 mol%), the presence of ubiquinone Q-10, the presence of 2-hydroxymyristic acid (14:0 2-OH) as the major hydroxylated fatty acid, the absence of 3-hydroxy fatty acids and the detection of sym-homospermidine as the major component in the polyamine pattern, together with the presence of sphingoglycolipid, supported this delineation. 16S rDNA sequence analysis indicated that strain EDIVT is most closely related (99.4% similarity) to Sphingomonas trueperi LMG 2142T. DNA-DNA hybridization showed that the level of relatedness to S. trueperi is only 45.5%. Further differences were apparent in the cellular fatty acid profile, the polar lipid pattern, the Fourier-transform infrared spectrum and whole-cell proteins and in a number of biochemical characteristics. On the basis of the estimated phylogenetic position derived from 16S rDNA sequence data, DNA-DNA reassociation and phenotypic differences, strain EDIVT (= CIP 106154T = DSM 13101T) was recognized as a new species of Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas pituitosa sp. nov. is proposed. A component analysis of the exopolysaccharide (named PS-EDIV) suggested that it represents a novel type of sphingan composed of glucose, rhamnose and an unidentified sugar. Glucuronic acid, which is commonly found in sphingans, was absent. The mean molecular mass of PS-EDIV was\n\nGenome Sequence of Sphingomonas sp.

EGY1 DSM 29616: a value added platform for renewable biodiesel.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmer, Nehad N; Elbahloul, Yasser; Embaby, Amira M; Hussein, Ahmed\n\n2017-07-01\n\nOleaginous microorganisms are regarded as efficient, renewable cell factories for lipid biosynthesis, a biodiesel precursor, to overwhelm the cosmopolitan energy crisis with affordable investment capital costs. Present research highlights production and characterization of lipids by a newly isolated oleaginous bacterium, Sphingomonas sp. EGY1 DSM 29616 through an eco-friendly approach. Only sweet whey [42.1% (v/v)] in tap water was efficiently used as a growth medium and lipid production medium to encourage cell growth and trigger lipid accumulation simultaneously. Cultivation of Sphingomonas sp. EGY1 DSM 29616 in shake flasks resulted in the accumulation of 8.5Â gÂ L -1 lipids inside the cells after 36Â h at 30âÂ°C. Triglycerides of C16:C18 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids showed a similar pattern to tripalmitin or triolein; deduced from gas chromatography (GC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), and Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectra analysis (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Batch cultivation 2.5Â L in a laboratory scale fermenter led to 13.8Â gÂ L -1 accumulated lipids after 34Â h at 30âÂ°C. Present data would underpin the potential of Sphingomonas sp.

Sphingomonas aromaticivorans strain B0695 was the most versatile of the five strains examined. This strain was able to degrade acenaphthene, anthracene, phenanthrene, 2,3-benzofluorene, 2-methyl naphthalene, 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene, and fluoranthene in the presence of 400 mg l(-1) Tween 80. Studies involving microcosms composed of aquifer sediments showed that S. aromaticivorans B0695 could degrade phenanthrene effectively in sterile sediment and could enhance the rate atmoreÂ Â» which this compound was degraded in nonsterile sediment. These findings indicate that it may be feasible to carry out (or, at least, to enhance) in situ bioremediation of phenanthrene-contaminated soils and subsurface environments with S. aromaticivorans B0695. In contrast, stra in B0695 was unable to degrade fluoranthene in microcosms containing aquifer sediments, even though it readily degraded this polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in a defined liquid growth medium.Â«Â less\n\nGenetic analysis of biodegradation of tetralin by a Sphingomonas strain\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHernaez, M.J.; Santero, E.; Reineke, W.\n\nTetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) is produced for industrial purposes from naphthalene by catalytic hydrogenation or from anthracene by cracking. A strain designated TFA which very efficiently utilizes tetralin has been isolated from the Rhine river. The strain has been identified as Sphingomonas macrogoltabidus, based on 16S rDNA sequence similarity. Genetic analysis of tetralin biodegradation has been performed by insertion mutagenesis and by physical analysis and analysis of complementation between the mutants.

Among the 59 pediatric cases of S. paucimobilis infection reported in the literature, the most common diagnosis involves isolated bacteremia. These cases are related to sporadic or epidemic infections. Death related to this infection occurred in only one case. The authors report a case of an 11-year-old boy with the diagnosis of Sphingomonas paucimobilis otomastoiditis and a thorough review of the literature on this infection in pediatrics. The patient presented a 20-day history of fever, otalgia, otorrhea, and progressive retroauricular swelling with protrusion of the left ear; despite 15 days of amoxicillin regimen. His past medical history included chronic bilateral otitis media, but no cause of immunosuppression was found. A brain computed tomography scan showed left otomastoiditis associated with a large circumscribed fluid collection with deep involvement of the soft tissues of the temporal region, including the subperiosteal space. Blood tests showed neutrophilia and elevated C-reactive protein. Surgical manipulation of the cited collection drained a large amount of a fetid purulent secretion. Ceftazidime and clindamycin were empirically initiated. The outcome was favorable, with fever defervescence and resolution of the scalp deformation. Culture of the drained secretion was positive for S. paucimobilis . Ciprofloxacin was scheduled for a further 10 days after discharge. The follow-up showed complete recovery. As far as we know, this is the first case of S. paucimobilis otomastoiditis, complicated with subperiosteal abscess in an immunocompetent child. The authors call attention to the increasing number of reports on S. paucimobilis infection over the years, and therefore to the importance of this pathogen, which was previously underestimated.\n\nDraft Genome Sequence of a Sphingomonas sp., an Endosymbiotic Bacterium Isolated from an Arctic Lichen Umbilicaria sp.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Jungeun; Shin, Seung Chul; Kim, Su Jin; Kim, Bum-Keun; Hong, Soon Gyu; Kim, Eun Hye; Park, Hyun\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSphingomonas sp. strain PAMC 26617 has been isolated from an Arctic lichen Umbilicaria sp. on the Svalbard Islands.

Strain Ndbn-20\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYao, Li; Yu, Lin-Lu; Zhang, Jun-Jie; Xie, Xiang-Ting; Tao, Qing; Yan, Xin; Hong, Qing; Qiu, Ji-Guo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Sphingomonas sp. strain Ndbn-20 degrades and utilizes the herbicide dicamba as its sole carbon and energy source. In the present study, a tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent dicamba methyltransferase gene, dmt, was cloned from the strain, and three other genes, metF, dhc, and purU, which are involved in THF metabolism, were found to be located downstream of dmt. A transcriptional study revealed that the four genes constituted one transcriptional unit that was constitutively transcribed. Lysates of cells grown with glucose or dicamba exhibited almost the same activities, which further suggested that the dmt gene is constitutively expressed in the strain. Dmt shared 46% and 45% identities with the methyltransferases DesA and LigM from Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6, respectively. The purified Dmt catalyzed the transfer of methyl from dicamba to THF to form the herbicidally inactive metabolite 3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid (DCSA) and 5-methyl-THF. The activity of Dmt was inhibited by 5-methyl-THF but not by DCSA. The introduction of a codon-optimized dmt gene into Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced resistance against dicamba. In conclusion, this study identified a THF-dependent dicamba methyltransferase, Dmt, with potential applications for the genetic engineering of dicamba-resistant crops. IMPORTANCE Dicamba is a very important herbicide that is widely used to control more than 200 types of broadleaf weeds and is a suitable target herbicide for the engineering of herbicide-resistant transgenic crops. A study of the mechanism of dicamba metabolism by soil microorganisms will benefit studies of its dissipation, transformation, and migration in the environment. This study identified a THF-dependent methyltransferase, Dmt, capable of catalyzing dicamba demethylation in Sphingomonas sp. Ndbn-20, and a preliminary study of its enzymatic characteristics was performed. Introduction of a codon-optimized dmt gene into Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced resistance against dicamba\n\nComplete Sequence of a 184-Kilobase Catabolic Plasmid from Sphingomonas aromaticivorans F199â\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRomine, Margaret F.; Stillwell, Lisa C.; Wong, Kwong-Kwok; Thurston, Sarah J.; Sisk, Ellen C.; Sensen, Christoph; Gaasterland, Terry; Fredrickson, Jim K.; Saffer, Jeffrey D.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe complete 184,457-bp sequence of the aromatic catabolic plasmid, pNL1, from Sphingomonas aromaticivorans F199 has been determined. A total of 186 open reading frames (ORFs) are predicted to encode proteins, of which 79 are likely directly associated with catabolism or transport of aromatic compounds. Genes that encode enzymes associated with the degradation of biphenyl, naphthalene, m-xylene, and p-cresol are predicted to be distributed among 15 gene clusters. The unusual coclustering of genes associated with different pathways appears to have evolved in response to similarities in biochemical mechanisms required for the degradation of intermediates in different pathways. A putative efflux pump and several hypothetical membrane-associated proteins were identified and predicted to be involved in the transport of aromatic compounds and/or intermediates in catabolism across the cell wall. Several genes associated with integration and recombination, including two group II intron-associated maturases, were identified in the replication region, suggesting that pNL1 is able to undergo integration and excision events with the chromosome and/or other portions of the plasmid. Conjugative transfer of pNL1 to another Sphingomonas sp. was demonstrated, and genes associated with this function were found in two large clusters. Approximately one-third of the ORFs (59 of them) have no obvious homology to known genes.

Besides the PAE biodegradation process, the PAE degrading bacteria have become one of the focuses of study. This study reports the successful isolation of one kind of indigenous bacterium PA-02 from phthalic acid (PA)-degrading aerobic granules. Based on its 16S ribosomal DNA sequence, isolate PA-02 was identified as Sphingomonas genus with 100% similarity to Sphingomonas sp. strain D84532. Strain PA-02 was a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium with strong auto-aggregation ability. In particular, the strain PA-02 possessed PAE-degrading ability without acclimation. Results of growth tests showed that strain PA-02 could degrade dimethyl phthalate (DMP), dibutyl phthalate, and diethylhexyl phthalate. The specific degradation rates of DMP and PA were concentration-dependent with maximum values of 0.4 g-DMP g(-1) biomass h(-1) and 1.3 g-PA g(-1) biomass h(-1), respectively. Kinetic studies also revealed that PA-02 was robust under high concentrations of DMP and PA. Even when the PA concentration was increased to 1,000.0 mg l(-1), the specific PA degradation rate was about 0.25 g-PA g(-1) biomass h(-1). The corresponding value for DMP was 0.067 g-DMP g(-1) biomass h(-1) at 1,000 mg l(-1).\n\nDraft Genome Sequence of Isoproturon-Mineralizing Sphingomonas sp.

Alun W.; Aamand, Jens; Walker, Allan\n\n2003-01-01\n\nSubstantial spatial variability in the degradation rate of the phenyl-urea herbicide isoproturon (IPU) [3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] has been shown to occur within agricultural fields, with implications for the longevity of the compound in the soil, and its movement to ground- and surface water. The microbial mechanisms underlying such spatial variability in degradation rate were investigated at Deep Slade field in Warwickshire, United Kingdom. Most-probable-number analysis showed that rapid degradation of IPU was associated with proliferation of IPU-degrading organisms. Slow degradation of IPU was linked to either a delay in the proliferation of IPU-degrading organisms or apparent cometabolic degradation. Using enrichment techniques, an IPU-degrading bacterial culture (designated strain F35) was isolated from fast-degrading soil, and partial 16S rRNA sequencing placed it within the Sphingomonas group. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified bacterial community 16S rRNA revealed two bands that increased in intensity in soil during growth-linked metabolism of IPU, and sequencing of the excised bands showed high sequence homology to the Sphingomonas group. However, while F35 was not closely related to either DGGE band, one of the DGGE bands showed 100% partial 16S rRNA sequence homology to an IPU-degrading Sphingomonas sp. (strain SRS2) isolated from Deep Slade field in an earlier study. Experiments with strains SRS2 and F35 in soil and liquid culture showed that the isolates had a narrow pH optimum (7 to 7.5) for metabolism of IPU. The pH requirements of IPU-degrading strains of Sphingomonas spp. could largely account for the spatial variation of IPU degradation rates across the field.

GY2B.\n\nPubMed\n\nShe, Bojia; Tao, Xueqin; Huang, Ting; Lu, Guining; Zhou, Zhili; Guo, Chuling; Dang, Zhi\n\n2016-03-01\n\nNano bamboo charcoal (NBC) has been commonly used in the production of textiles, plastics, paint, etc. However, little is known regarding their effects towards the microorganisms. The effects of NBC on phenanthrene degrading strain Sphingomonas sp. GY2B were investigated in the present study. Results showed that the addition of NBC could improve the phenanthrene removal by Sphingomonas sp. GY2B, with removal efficiencies increased by 10.29-18.56% in comparison to the control at 24h, and phenanthrene was almost completely removed at 48h. With the presence of low dose of NBC (20 and 50mgL(-1)), strain GY2B displayed a better growth at 6h, suggesting that NBC was beneficial to the growth of GY2B and thus resulting in the quick removal of phenanthrene from water. However, the growth of strain GY2B in high dose of NBC (200mgL(-1)) was inhibited at 6h, and the inhibition could be attenuated and eliminated after 12h. NBC-effected phenanthrene solubility experiment suggested that NBC makes a negligible contribution to the solubilization of phenanthrene in water. Results of electronic microscopy analysis (SEM and TEM) indicated NBC may interact with the cell membrane, causing the enhanced membrane permeability and then NBC adsorbed on the membrane would enter into the cells. The findings of this work would provide important information for the future usage and long-term environmental risk assessment of NBC. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

GY2B.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Shasha; Guo, Chuling; Dang, Zhi; Liang, Xujun\n\n2017-03-01\n\nPrevious study concerning the effects of surfactants on phenanthrene biodegradation focused on observing the changes of cell characteristics of Sphingomonas sp. GY2B. However, the impact of surfactants on the expression of bacterial proteins, controlling phenanthrene transport and catabolism, remains obscure. To overcome the knowledge gap, comparative proteomic approaches were used to investigate protein expressions of Sphingomonas sp. GY2B during phenanthrene biodegradation in the presence and absence of a nonionic surfactant, Tween80. A total of 23 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated proteins were detected upon Tween80 treatment. Tween80 could regulate ion transport (e.g. H + ) in cell membrane to provide driving force (ATP) for the transmembrane transport of phenanthrene thus increasing its uptake and biodegradation by GY2B. Moreover, Tween80 probably increased GY2B vitality and growth by inducing the expression of peptidylprolyl isomerase to stabilize cell membrane, increasing the abundances of proteins involved in intracellular metabolic pathways (e.g. TCA cycle), as well as decreasing the abundances of translation/transcription-related proteins and cysteine desulfurase, thereby facilitating phenanthrene biodegradation. This study may facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate surfactants-enhanced biodegradation of PAHs at the proteomic level. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The authors have studied the mineralization of {sup 14}C-radiolabeled fluoranthene by high cell masses of Sphingomonas paucimobilis, strain EPA 505, and have shown that initial rates of mineralization can be enhanced by concentrations of the surfactant Triton X-100 as high as 2%. Mass balances are reported that show complete degradation of fluoranthene. The presence of soil stimulated biodegradation of fluoranthene in the same manner as surfactants, presumably becausemoreÂ Â» of increased dissolution rates from soil particulates.
