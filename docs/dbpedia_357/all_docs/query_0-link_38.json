MAGE.\n\nthe repair sequences in the Shuttle-MAGE plasmid were targeted for modification by applying cycles of MAGE with oligos designed to introduce premature stop codons or new fluorescent properties to the target sequences.\n\nPanel A shows the ADE2 gene was targeted to be cleaved by Cas9 at the designated PAM recognition sequence. Two distinct MAGE oligos introduced premature stop codons in the encoding gene to render cells that utilize the given repair sequence to escape Cas9 cleavage unable to express a functional ADE2 allele.\n\nPanel B shows the fluorescent properties of the Venus-YFP gene introduced into the yeast genome were altered by the introduction of mutations in the sequence via MAGE.\n\nOligos were designed to change the Venus-YFP sequence to that of either the Emerald (Yellow to Green) or Cerulean (Yellow to Blue) fluorescent proteins, or to contain a premature stop codon.\n\nthe CRISPR gRNA target recognition sequence along the YFP target is shown in blue.\n\nPanel C shows after cycles of MAGE individual plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the desired mutations were incorporated.\n\nFIG. 3 shows imaging of yeast colonies to identify targeted changes.\n\ncolonies of yeast strains were imaged after having undergone Shuttle-MAGE manipulation.\n\nPanel A shows the ADE2 Shuttle-MAGE plasmid was transformed into Cas9-expressing BY4741 and BY4733 cells. The resulting cultures were plated onto agar plates and photographed under different bright-field and fluorescent channels. The colonies that appear red have incorporated one of the premature stop codon mutations introduced by MAGE on the repair sequence in the Shuttle-MAGE plasmid. All colonies continue to express the Venus YFP protein.\n\nPanel B shows the YFP Shuttle-MAGE plasmid was transformed into Cas9-expressing cells.\n\nFIG. 4 shows changing CRISPR gRNAs on the shuttle-MAGE plasmid.\n\na MAGE oligo was designed to change the gRNA sequence in the Shuttle-MAGE plasmid (right). Cycles of MAGE were applied using Oligo 13, which contained homologous sequences to the regions up and downstream of the gRNA recognition sequence on the plasmid.\n\nthe resulting library of plasmids is therefore capable of digesting and modifying the target genome at multiple sites.\n\nthe invention provides methods for engineering a cell for a desired phenotype.\n\nthe method comprises introducing an oligonucleotide library into a population of cells, where the cells express a single-stranded annealing protein (SSAP) system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides.\n\nSSAP single-stranded annealing protein\n\nthe oligonucleotide library targets sequences that control gene expression in the cell (e.g., 5â² and/or 3â² untranslated sequences), and/or may target protein coding sequences (e.g., including start and stop codons).\n\nCells having the desired phenotype may then be screened or selected, and genes with altered expression as a result of oligonucleotide incorporation can be identified for further engineering. Further engineering in various embodiments can be conducted by a second oligonucleotide library designed for diversification of the identified genes, and/or by targeting at least one gene with a gene editing system, such as a programmable nuclease as described herein. With each iterative round (or intermittently in a substantially continuous process), cells are selected having an improvement in the desired phenotype.\n\nthe desired phenotype can be one or more of a change in carbon substrate utilization, increased cell growth rate, increased production of a desired chemical, redox cofactor balance, reduced production of one or more undesired byproducts, increased resistance to industrial fermentation, and increased recombinant protein production, among others.\n\nthe various steps for diversifying the genetics of the host cell population can target endogenous genes and/or heterologously expressed genes, including enzymes expressed as part of a biosynthetic pathway or recombinant proteins for production.\n\ngenes altered by the first or subsequent oligonucleotide libraries can be identified by transcriptional (e.g., microarray) or translational analysis or by DNA sequencing and compared to a reference genomic sequence (e.g., the starting sequence).\n\nthe desired phenotype is increased production of a desired chemical, and which may be the result of a primary metabolic pathway and a downstream biosynthetic pathway (which may further comprise at least one heterologously expressed gene in some embodiments).\n\nthe cell expresses a heterologous biosynthetic pathway that alters flux through one or more of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, MVA or MEP pathway.\n\nthe invention provides methods for genomic and pathway engineering.\n\nthe invention is applicable to pathway engineering where metabolic flux through a core or primary metabolic pathway is altered (e.g., significantly altered as compared to wild type, unengineered, or starting strain), including where flux at a metabolic branch point is altered.\n\nthe invention is applicable to balance one or more secondary pathways, that is, to reduce flux from competing secondary pathways while enhancing flux to a desired biosynthetic pathway.\n\nthe invention is applicable to introducing and balancing of heterologous recombinant enzyme activity with endogenous metabolism, to limit effects on viability and cell growth (for example).\n\nthe invention provides methods for pathway engineering, in which metabolic flux is significantly altered through one or more intermediates of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, one or more biosynthesis pathways (e.g., for production of natural or unnatural amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, fatty acids, antibiotics, among others), the MEP or MVA pathway, pathways involved in sulfur or nitrogen metabolism, and others.\n\npathway engineering in which metabolic flux is significantly altered through one or more intermediates of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, one or more biosynthesis pathways (e.g., for production of natural or unnatural amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, fatty acids, antibiotics, among others), the MEP or MVA pathway, pathways involved in sulfur or nitrogen metabolism, and others.\n\nthe invention relates to, in various embodiments, engineering cells to increase one or more of carbon substrate utilization, increase or maintain cell growth rate, modify enzyme activity at metabolic branch points, decrease metabolic flux through one or more competing secondary pathways, balance cellular redox chemistry (e.g., redox cofactor balance), balance heterologous enzyme activity with the endogenous metabolism, including reduction in toxic intermediates, increase resistance to environmental (e.g., industrial) conditions, and increase recombinant protein production.\n\nredox chemistry e.g., redox cofactor balance\n\nthe invention engineers cells through a SSAP system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides, such as the Beta protein of the â Red recombineering system or the RecT protein of the homologous RecET system, or a homologous system.\n\nthe host cell expresses the ssDNA annealing protein Beta, or derivative or homolog thereof. These proteins promote annealing of single stranded oligonucleotides at the lagging strand of the replication fork.\n\nThese embodiments may further involve a deletion, inactivation, or reduction in a mismatch repair protein.\n\nthese embodiments can employ a deletion, inactivation, or reduction in activity or level of mutS, or homolog thereof in the host organism of choice (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,144,734, 7,521,242, and 7,674,621 and US Patent Publication No. 2005/0079618, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference).\n\nThis system is useful for engineering E. coli and similar bacterial systems.\n\nan oligonucleotide library designed to screen for beneficial mutations (or combinations of mutations) in a target genetic âspaceâ is introduced into the organism by transformation (e.g., by electroporation (e.g.\n\nLithium Acetate or PolyEthyleneGlycol Lithium Acetate or PolyEthyleneGlycol\n\nchemical transformation e.g. chemical transformation\n\nballistic transformation e.g. gene gun\n\npressure induced transformation mechanical shear forces induced, for example, in microfluids, and carbon nanotubes, nanotube puncture (such as carbon nanotube arrays), induced natural competence mechanisms of an organism, merging of protoplasts, and conjugation with Agrobacterium ) of a cell population, and a desired phenotype is identified.\n\nthe genetic âspaceâ includes selected target pathways, target genes, and the nature and diversity of alterations to screen, including changes to gene regulatory sequences such as promoters and transcriptional enhancer sequences, ribosomal binding sites and other sites relating to the efficiency of transcription, translation, or RNA processing, as well as coding sequence mutations that control the activity, post-translational modification, or turnover of the encoded protein.\n\nthe oligonucleotide library targets start and/or stop codons, and splice sites.\n\ngenomic engineering platforms that may be used, alternatively or in combination with the â Red or homologous or analogous system as described herein, include CRISPR/Cas9, ZFNs, BurrH binding domain or BuD, derived nucleases, TALEs, and TALENs.\n\nthe host cell is an E. coli possessing the â Red recombineering system or the RecET system (e.g., the Beta gene or recT gene) and lacking the mismatch repair gene mutS.\n\nthe â Red System has been referred to as Multiplexed Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) and is a process by which the genome of a cell is reprogrammed to perform desired functions via a form of accelerated, directed evolution (Wang et al., Nature, 460:894-898 (2009); Church et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,153,432, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties).\n\nMAGE Multiplexed Automated Genome Engineering\n\nBeta proteins recombine oligos designed to target key genomic regions for highly specific mutations.\n\nthe deletion of mutS may further improve recombination efficiency by avoiding the mismatch repair machinery.\n\nprotein Beta binds to, protects, and promotes strand annealing of the ssDNA oligomers. This may occur in the lagging strand during DNA replication where the oligomers are thus incorporated into the duplicated genome.\n\nthe deletion of the mismatch repair gene mutS in the recombineering strain prevents the reversion of some of the non-homologous genetic changes introduced by the ssDNA oligonucleotide pool.\n\ngenetic diversity is greatly increased in focused regions of the genome according to the targeted design of the oligonucleotide pool.\n\nselection or screening is performed for the desired genomic characteristic and the process is repeated. In some embodiments, the process is conducted in a continuous fashion.\n\nthe host cell or strain has one or more genetic modifications to protect oligos following entry into the cell. Knocking out four potent ssDNA exonucleases in E. coli improves oligomediated allelic recombination frequency when low concentrations of oligos are used (Mosberg, J. A., et al., PloS One, 7(9), e44638). ExoVII is a nuclease that degrades the ends of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cassettes.\n\nssDNA single-stranded DNA\n\ndsDNA double-stranded DNA\n\nRemoving this nuclease improves both recombination frequency and the inheritance of mutations at 3â² ends of ssDNA and dsDNA.\n\nRemoving ExoVII and the set of four exonucleases may improve recombineering performance.\n\nthe host strain may have a deletion or inactivation in ExoVII, and one or more (or all) of RecJ, ExoI, ExoX, and Lambda Exo.\n\nco-selection will be applied to increase the rate at which surviving cells will contain the desired mutations.\n\nThis may be executed by including oligos that introduce or revert mutations in a counter-selectable marker positioned in the genome or on a plasmid along with the oligos targeting other genomic location(s). This may include but is not limited to TolC, as described in (Gregg C J, et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 42(7):4779-90 (2014), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference).\n\nthe SSAP system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides is first used to identify primary and secondary pathway targets.\n\ntranscriptional and/or translational sequences can be broadly disrupted and/or enhanced by oligonucleotide design, and the transcriptional and/or translational state of cells showing improvement in the desired phenotype (e.g., chemical production) evaluated to identify genes that are frequently upregulated versus genes that are frequently downregulated or shut off completely, or identify frequent or optimal combinations of the above.\n\nTranscriptional effects can be induced with the oligonucleotide library by exchanging or interfering with gene promoters or transcriptional binding sites.\n\nTranslational effects can be induced by the oligonucleotides by enhancing or interfering with ribosomal binding sites, such as the Shine-Dalgamo sequence, or the Kozak sequence, or DNA sequences 5â² or 3â² of the ORF that affect RNA degradation rate, as well as start and stop codons.\n\nribosomal binding sites such as the Shine-Dalgamo sequence, or the Kozak sequence\n\nDNA sequences 5â² or 3â² of the ORF that affect RNA degradation rate, as well as start and stop codons.\n\nsubsequent rounds employ CRISPR/Cas9, TALENS. ZFNs, BurrH binding domain or BuD, derived nucleases, or homologous or analagous systems for refining selected strains. Such systems can be used to induce double-strand breaks (DSB) and increase homologous recombination efficiency.\n\nDSB double-strand breaks\n\na double-strand break (DSB) or single-strand break or nick can be created by a site-specific nuclease such as a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) or TAL effector domain nuclease (TALEN) or BurrH binding domain (BuD)-derived nucleases, or using the CRISPR/Cas9 system with an engineered crRNA/tracrRNA (or synthetic guide RNA) to guide specific cleavage.\n\na site-specific nuclease such as a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) or TAL effector domain nuclease (TALEN) or BurrH binding domain (BuD)-derived nucleases\n\nZFN zinc-finger nuclease\n\nTALEN TAL effector domain nuclease\n\nBuD BurrH binding domain\n\nTransgene insertion can be accomplished via homology-directed repair (HDR) processes, which require the inserted transgene to include regions of homology to the site of insertion (cleavage).\n\nHDR homology-directed repair\n\ntargeted integration can occur by homology-independent non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair machinery.\n\nthe recombineering strain expresses an endogenous or heterologous ZFN, BuD, TALEN, or CRISPR/Cas9.\n\nDonor nucleic acid libraries can be designed for this system as described in detail herein.\n\nthe process employs a double-strand break system as described in US 2013/0326645, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\nthe donor molecules may be integrated into the endogenous locus via homology-independent mechanisms (e.g., NHEJ), and may employ a double-stranded donor comprising a transgene or synthetic DNA of at least 1 kb in length and nuclease target site(s) 3â² and/or 5â² of the transgene for in vivo cleavage.\n\nthe nuclease target site(s) used to cleave the donor are not re-created upon integration of the transgene, for example when a spacer between paired target sites is not present in and/or does not exhibit homology to an endogenous locus.\n\nthe donor molecule may be, for example, a plasmid or a DNA sequence incorporated within a plasmid.\n\nthe donor DNA is integrated following nuclease-mediated cleavage of the endogenous locus.\n\nSuch processes can employ donor sequences of up to about 20 kb, and in various embodiments employ donor sequences of from about 50 bases to about 10.000 bases, or from about 100 bases to about 5,000 bases, or about 200 bases to about 2,000 bases, or about 200 bases to about 1000 bases.\n\nDouble-strand breaks (DSB) or single-strand breaks (nicks) in the genome of the target cell may be created by any mechanism.\n\nthe DSB or nick is created by one or more (e.g., a dimerizing pair of) zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), fusion proteins comprising a zinc finger binding domain, which is engineered to bind a sequence within the region of interest, and a cleavage domain or a cleavage half-domain.\n\nZFNs zinc-finger nucleases\n\nfusion proteins comprising a zinc finger binding domain, which is engineered to bind a sequence within the region of interest, and a cleavage domain or a cleavage half-domain.\n\nthe DSB or nick is created by one or more TALE DNA-binding domains (naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring) fused to a nuclease domain (TALENs).\n\nthe DSB or nick is created by one or more BurrH binding domains or BuD-derived nucleases, which is engineered to cleave a sequence within the region of interest.\n\ncleavage or nicking is performed using a nuclease system such as CRISPR/Cas with an engineered crRNA/tracr RNA or crRNA/tracr RNA combined into a single synthetic guide RNA targeting the desired genomic or extra-chromosomal sequence.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9 The genetic components of CRISPR/Cas9, as well as the structural requirements for the crRNA/tracrRNA or synthetic guide RNA are described in, for example, PCT/US2013/032589, publication number: WO2013176772 (describing, inter alia, the use of CRISPR/Cas9 with a single combined crRNA/tracrRNA system, known as a guide RNA); Jinek, et al. (2012). A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity. Science, 337(6096), 816-821; Mali , et al. (2013). CAS9 transcriptional activators for target specificity screening and paired nickases for cooperative genome engineering. Nature Biotechnology.\n\nthe invention provides a method for engineering a cell for increased recombineering potential (as well as cells provided by such method), comprising: introducing an oligonucleotide library into said cell, and selecting for increased recombineering potential.\n\nIncreased recombineering potential may be determined, for example, by introducing an oligonucleotide directing entry of a premature stop codon in a marker gene.\n\nRecombineering strains may be created through initial genetic modifications to protect and promote ssDNA annealing or homologous recombination efficiency and avoid the mismatch repair system.\n\nthe suitability of any particular host cell or strain for recombineering can be assessed using a reporter or selection system.\n\ncandidate host cells or strains are subjected to cycles of genomic engineering using an oligo-pool or pool of mutants for recombination designed to introduce mutations into endogenous or heterologous genes that control these processes.\n\nExemplary target genes are described below for bacterial and yeast systems for example, and other prokaryotic and eukaryotic counterparts are known.\n\nthe number of initial cycles can be determined according to the efficiency of the parent strain and the number of allelic targets.\n\none cycle is performed with a single oligo designed to replace a premature stop codon in a gene for one or more selection marker(s) in the host genome or on a plasmid (e.g., a fluorescent or luminescent reporter protein, or other gene creating an easily observable or quantifiable phenotype); and after selection for strains capable of successfully introducing the stop codon, quantifying specificity and efficiency of the replacement.\n\na plasmid e.g., a fluorescent or luminescent reporter protein, or other gene creating an easily observable or quantifiable phenotype\n\nrecombination may be mediated by phage-derived proteins from the â Red system or RecE/RecT from the Rac prophage of E. coli .\n\nthe â Red recombination functions are encoded by an operon containing three genes, gamma, beta, and exo, although only the beta gene is required for oligonucleotide incorporation.\n\nthe RecET system is a member of the same superfamily, and the â Red Exo/Beta and RecE/RecT protein pairs are functionally equivalent.\n\nBeta and RecT are SSAPs that bind and protect ssDNA, and Beta is capable of efficient recombination with ssDNA oligos by promoting annealing of complementary ssDNA at the replication fork.\n\nssDNA recombinases other than or related to Beta and RecT have been described. Sequence analysis of diverse SSAPs and/or recombinases shows at least six families among at least three evolutionarily distinct superfamilies: Rad52-like (of which â Red Beta, Sak, and Erf are members), Rad51-like (e.g., Sak4), and Gp2.5-like, each with distinct sequence profiles and folds.\n\nthe host cell or stain encodes and expresses one or more of a SSAP and/or recombinase or variant from the three superfamilies described above.\n\nthe term âvariantâ means that the variant comprises an amino acid sequence with at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% identity to at least one of the SSAPs and/or recombinases.\n\nyeast strains with higher recombineering efficiency with single stranded oligonucleotides are prepared, using a library of oligonucleotides that alter the expression (transcription and/or translation), and/or coding regions, of one or more (or all) of Rad52, Rad51, Rad59, and Rad54, among others genes.\n\nthe library of oligonucleotides target for mutations the 5â² and/or 3â² non-coding sequences, intron sequences (including splice sites), and/or coding sequences of these genes, and the yeast strains selected for recombineering efficiency as described above.\n\nprogrammable nuclease systems as referenced above are used to target mutations in these genes, for example, as described above by coupling the heterologous system with donor DNA on a single vector.\n\nRad52 may also function independently of the RecA ortholog, Rad51. In yeast, nearly all homologous recombination pathways begin with resection of dsDNA to generate 3â²-terminated ssDNA, followed by the binding of RPA and Rad52, and its paralog Rad59. RAD52 binds ssDNA during recombination and also shows a quaternary organization similar to those of RecT/Red â and ERF, and may be used in the invention in various embodiments.\n\nthe RPA-Rad52-Rad59-ssDNA complex can participate in either Rad51-ssDNA filament formation and the canonical gene conversion pathway or Rad52-mediated (and Rad51-independent) single-strand annealing. This choice is primarily controlled by Rad51, but is moderated by Rad59 and other cellular proteins. The competition is dynamic and reversible, and the pathway chosen for DSB repair is likely determined by DNA target availability and protein availability. Rad59 enhances DNA annealing by Rad52 and increases the likelihood of entering the SSA pathway. Overexpression of S. cerevisiae wild-type Rad52 increases recombination rates of dsDNA, and it has the opposite effect with single-strand oligo-mediated AR. When Rad5l and Rad54 are overexpressed together, there is a dramatic increase in oligo-mediated AR, which is further elevated in the absence of Rad52. This system may be engineered as described above to improve the host cell's efficiency for recombineering.\n\nthe cell is a eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic cell, including bacterial, yeast, agal, plant, insect, and/or non-human mammalian cells, or immortal cell lines.\n\nthe host cell may be Esherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces castellii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Pichia stipitis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis thaliana , or Caenorhabditis elegans .\n\nthe cell is a bacterial cell, such as Escherichia spp., Streptomyces spp., Zymonas spp., Acetobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Synechocystis spp., Rhizobium spp., Clostridium spp., Corynebacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., Xanthomonas spp., Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Alcaligenes spp., Pseudomonas spp., Aeromonas spp., Azotobacter spp., Comamonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., Rhodococcus spp., Gluconobacter spp., Ralstonia spp., Acidithiobacillus spp.,\n\nthe cell is a Cyanobacterial cell, such as Synechocystis spp., Prochlorococcus spp., Nostoc punctiforme, Calothrix spp., Aphanizomenon flos - aquae, Arthrospira platensis , etc.\n\nthe bacterial cell can be a Gram-negative cell such as an E. coli , or a Gram-positive cell such as a species of Bacillus .\n\nthe cell is a fungal cell such as a yeast cell, e.g., Saccharomyces spp., Schizosaccharomyces spp., Pichia spp., Paffia spp., Kluyveromyces spp., Candida spp., Talaromyces spp., Brettanomyces spp., Pachysolen spp., Debaryomnyces spp., Yarrowia spp., and industrial polyploid yeast strains.\n\nyeast strain is a S. cerevisiae strain or a Yarrowia spp. strain.\n\nthe cell is an algal cell or a plant cell (e.g., A. thaliana, C. reinhardtii, Arthrospira, P. tricomutum, T. suecica, P. carterae, P. tricomutum, Chlorolla spp., such as Chlorolla vulgaris).\n\nTarget cells can include transgenic and recombinant cell lines, including Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO).\n\nthe host cell or strain in addition to having a SSAP system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides as described, has one or more nucleic acids for inhibiting a mismatch repair system. While these systems can be inactivated by a more permanent genetic deletion or mutation event, alternatively, the systems can be controlled by expressed inhibitor nucleic acid, which in some embodiments is inducible to render recombineering an inducible phenotype. In other embodiments, inhibitory nucleic acids are not encoded by the cell, but are provided exogenously (e.g., transiently) to allow recombineering to take place.\n\nInhibitory nucleic acids include, but are not limited to, antisense oligonucleotides, antagomirs, and RNAi-related sequences (e.g., short hairpin RNA (shRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)) that target mismatch repair genes within a target cell and thereby decrease expression of the mismatch repair gene in the cell.\n\nRNAi-related sequences e.g., short hairpin RNA (shRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)\n\nMismatch repair genes that can be targeted include but are not limited to, for example, one or more of Msh2, Msh3, Msh6, Msh1, Msh2, and/or Pms1.\n\nthe mismatch repair (MMR) system is primarily responsible for correcting errors following replication, but it also directly takes part in homologous recombination by rejecting recombination partners with insufficient homology.\n\nthe proteins responsible for initiation of E. coli mismatch repair are MutS and MutL, which function as homo-oligomers. MutS is responsible for mismatch recognition and MutL serves to interface mismatch recognition by MutS to activation of downstream activities. Eukaryotes have at least two MutS heterodimers that share MSH2 as a common subunit: MSH2-MSH6 and MSH2-MSH3.\n\nthe MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer mainly recognizes single nucleotide substitutions and small loops of 1 or 2 bases, while the MSH2/MSH3 pair has greater affinity for larger loops of 2-5 unpaired nucleotides.\n\nThree eukaryotic MutL heterodimeric complexes have been identified with MLH1 serving as a common subunit: MLH1-PMS2, MLH1-PMS1, and MLH1-MLH3, MLH1-PMS2 is the primary MutL activity in human mitotic cells and supports repair initiated by either MutS heterodimer.\n\nAvoidance of the MMR system in E. coli recombineering is substantially more effective in strains lacking MMR machinery, at the cost, or benefit depending on perspective, of higher overall mutation rates. See, e.g., and US Patent Publication No. 2005/0079618, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Indeed temporary suppression of MMR is an effective strategy for enhancing gene-editing efficiency in many cells. Using short-hairpins to suppress MSH2 expression allows for large increases in allelic recombination efficiency. Transient suppression of MSH2 by shRNA is very effective for base substitutions, particularly for the simultaneous substitution of 3-4 bases rather than 1 or 2.\n\none or more inhibitory nucleic acids can be antisense oligonucleotides.\n\nAntisense oligonucleotides may be designed to block expression of a DNA or RNA target by binding to the target and halting expression at the level of transcription, translation, or splicing.\n\nthe antisense oligonucleotides can be complementary nucleic acid sequences, or substantially complementary sequences, designed to hybridize under stringent conditions to a mismatch repair gene.\n\none or more inhibitory nucleic acids can be RNAi-related sequences, including but not limited to a small interfering RNA (âsiRNAâ) or short hairpin RNA (âshRNAâ).\n\nthe interfering RNA can be assembled from two separate oligonucleotides, where one strand is the sense strand and the other is the antisense strand, wherein the antisense and sense strands are self-complementary (i.e., each strand comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in the other strand; such as where the antisense strand and sense strand form a duplex or double stranded structure); the antisense strand comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof (i.e., an undesired gene) and the sense strand comprises nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof.\n\ninterfering RNA is assembled from a single oligonucleotide, where the self-complementary sense and antisense regions are linked by means of nucleic acid based or non-nucleic acid-based linker(s).\n\nthe interfering RNA can be a polynucleotide with a duplex, asymmetric duplex, hairpin or asymmetric hairpin secondary structure, having self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence in a separate target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof.\n\nthe interfering RNA can be a circular single-stranded polynucleotide having two or more loop structures and a stem comprising self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof, and wherein the circular polynucleotide can be processed either in a target cell to generate an active siRNA molecule capable of mediating RNA interference.\n\nthe interfering RNA coding region encodes a self-complementary RNA molecule having a sense region, an antisense region and a loop region.\n\nRNA molecule when expressed desirably forms a âhairpinâ structure, and is referred to herein as an âshRNA.â\n\nthe loop region is generally between about 2 and about 10 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the loop region is from about 6 to about 9 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the sense region and the antisense region are between about 15 and about 23 nucleotides in length.\n\nthe small hairpin RNA is converted into a siRNA by a cleavage event mediated by the enzyme Dicer, which is a member of the RNase III family.\n\nDicer which is a member of the RNase III family.\n\nthe siRNA is then capable of inhibiting the expression of a gene with which it shares homology.\n\nDicer a member of the RNase III family.\n\nthe siRNA is then capable of inhibiting the expression of a gene with which it shares homology.\n\nsiRNAs The target RNA cleavage reaction guided by siRNAs is highly sequence specific.\n\nsiRNA containing a nucleotide sequences identical to a portion of the target nucleic acid are preferred for inhibition.\n\n100% sequence identity between the siRNA and the target gene is not required.\n\nthe invention has the advantage of being able to tolerate sequence variations that might be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence.\n\nsiRNA sequences with insertions, deletions, and single point mutations relative to the target sequence have also been found to be effective for inhibition.\n\nsiRNA sequences with nucleotide analog substitutions or insertions can be effective for inhibition.\n\nthe siRNAs must retain specificity for their target, i.e., must not directly bind to, or directly significantly affect expression levels of, transcripts other than the intended target.\n\na one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids are used to target one or more of Msh2, Msh3, Msh6, Msh1, Msh2, Msh 3, and/or Pms1, in Saccharomyces cerevisiaee, Pichia pastoris, Saccharomyces castellii, Kluyveromyces lacbs, Pichia stipitis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans , or mammalian (e.g., non-human mammalian cells).\n\nmammalian e.g., non-human mammalian cells.\n\na construct for use in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can include one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids that target Msh2 (NP 014551.1), Msh3 (NP 010016.2), Msh6 (NP 010382.10), Msh1 (NP 013890.1), Msh3 (NP 015161.1), and/or Pms1 (NP 014317.2).\n\nconstructs can include one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids that target different regions within the same gene.\n\nconstructs can include one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids against Msh2 (NP 014551.1), Msh3 (NP 010016.2), Msh6 (NP 010382.10), Msh1 (NP 013890.1), Msh3 (NP 015161.1), and/or Pms1 (NP 014317.2).\n\nMsh2 NP 014551.1\n\nMsh3 NP 010016.2\n\nMsh6 NP 010382.10\n\nMsh1 NP 013890.1\n\nMsh3 NP 015161.1\n\nPms1 NP 014317.2\n\nthe host cell or strain has one or more genetic modifications to protect oligos following entry into the cell. Knocking out four potent ssDNA exonucleases in E. coli improves oligomediated allelic recombination frequency when low concentrations of oligos are used.\n\nExoVII has been identified as a nuclease which degrades the ends of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cassettes. Removing this nuclease may improve both recombination frequency and the inheritance of mutations at 3â² ends of ssDNA and dsDNA. Removing ExoVII and the set of four exonucleases (RecJ, ExoI, ExoX, and Lambda Exo) improves recombineering performance.\n\nthe host cell or strain provides for controlled activation/termination (e.g. expression of the machinery necessary for recombineering, or double-strand break or nicking by the programmable site-specific recombinase systems described herein, can be controlled). Control of machinery that suppresses the mismatch repair mechanisms of the host cell provides for genomic stability before and after the recombineering process.\n\nexpression of constructs can be induced by chemical or thermal means and can remain unexpressed when not induced (or vice versa).\n\nthe recombineering phenotype or programmable site-specific nuclease phenotype is reversible, that is, constructs can be removed after performing the recombineering process.\n\nthe construct can be removed by growth in non-selectable media as is standard practice for the target organism.\n\nthe device may include sequence elements to allow for rapid removal (e.g., flanking loxP sequence).\n\nExpression control sequences suitable for regulating expression of a SSAP system and/or recombinase that promotes recombination of single stranded oligonucleotides, programmable nucleases, and optionally one or more inhibitory nucleic acids can include a promoter and/or enhancer sequence.\n\nthe promoter and/or the enhancer can be inducible (e.g. chemically or physically regulated).\n\na chemically regulated promoter and/or enhancer can, for example, be regulated by the presence of alcohol, tetracycline, a steroid, or a metal, to name but a few.\n\na physically regulated promoter and/or enhancer can, for example, be regulated by environmental factors, such as temperature and light.\n\nexpression control sequences can include copper and nickel dependent promoters such as the Cyc6 promoter (Quinn et al., Eukaryotic cell, 2:995-1002 (2003)).\n\nexpression control sequences can include light induced expression control systems that include, e.g., the Cabll-1 promoter.\n\nexpression control sequences can include tetracycline-controlled systems, including Tet-Off and Tet-On (Bujard et al., PNAS USA, 89:5547-51 (1992)).\n\nthe host cell or strain controls localization of recombineering or programmable nuclease effectors within the cell, to thereby control the process in an on or off fashion.\n\nthe ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen receptor (ER) can be used to regulate the localization and activity of nuclear proteins in yeast and mammalian cells. Nuclear proteins containing the ER LBD are retained in the cytoplasm until activated by estradiol or the functional estrogen antagonists tamoxifen (TAM) or 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (40HT).\n\nthe ligand Upon binding, the ligand displaces Hsp90 and facilitates correct folding of the released fusion protein, which activates the LBD fused nuclear protein and allows translocation to the nucleus.\n\nSeveral ER ligand variants with different activation mechanisms are known.\n\nthe mouse ER LBD mutant G525R and corresponding human mutant G521R (ERT) exhibit roughly a 1000-fold reduction in 1711-estradiol binding affinity compared to wildtype, yet retain normal affinity for TAM and 4OHT.\n\nthe 4OHT affinity of the human ER LBD mutant ERT2 (G400V/M543A/L544A) is approximately 4-fold higher than that of ERT.\n\nectopic DNA enzymes such as Cre, Flp and I-SceI have successfully been controlled by fusion with ERT and other nuclear hormone receptors. These systems can be adapted for host cells of choice, including yeast.\n\nER LBD and mutants fused to other yeast nuclear proteins would elicit the same properties of control.\n\nfusing these components to various mutant SSAP or SSAP enabling genes allows constitutive expression, whereby the proteins remain inactive (and non-physiological) in the cytosol until activated prior to transformation.\n\nan inducible protein degradation system using the GEV system to activate expression of the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease is useful in the present invention.\n\nTEV specifically degrades proteins with the N-degron peptide sequence. With expression of TEV under tight control of the GEV system.\n\nMMR and/or Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway members with N-degron sequences can be degraded concomitant with SSAP activation.\n\nthe host cell or strain can include one or more nucleic acids encoding one or more CRISPR pathway components e.g., operably linked to expression control sequences.\n\nexpression control sequences for protein beta, one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids, and/or RNAi and/or CRISPR machinery can be distinct and independently controlled.\n\nexpression control sequences for protein beta, one or a plurality of inhibitory nucleic acids, and/or RNAi and/or CRISPR machinery can be the same or can be induced via the same signal.\n\nthe invention is applicable to prokaryotic organisms that are more difficult to genetically manipulate than E. coli .\n\nthe invention allows for target genes to be introduced into E. coli using a vector that is compatible for replication in E. coli and the desired host, and after undergoing rounds of engineering in E. coli , the engineered vectors are introduced in the host cell of choice.\n\nthe method comprises providing a vector suitable for replication in a target species (e.g. any of the cells disclosed herein) and suitable for replication in a second species (e.g. any of the cells disclosed herein).\n\nthe second species expresses a SSAP system and/or recombinase that optionally promotes annealing of single stranded oligonucleotides at the lagging strand of the replication fork, or the second species expresses a gene editing system, wherein the vector comprises a target polynucleotide for engineering.\n\nthe vector is introduced into the second species under conditions suitable for diversification of said target polynucleotide by the SSAP system and/or recombinase, and the vector library isolated and introduced into said target species.\n\nthe second species may be E. coli , and the target species can be a slow growing organism.\n\nthe target species is S. cerevisiae or an actinomycetes and the second species is E. coli , or the target species is a plant and the second species is an agrobacter.\n\ngenome engineering for the target organism is conducted in a MAGE-competent recombineering strain, for example such as an E. coli strain described herein, anlocus (or library thereof) exported to target cells (e.g., non-recombineering or MAGE-competent strains).\n\na MAGE-competent recombineering strain for example such as an E. coli strain described herein, anlocus (or library thereof) exported to target cells (e.g., non-recombineering or MAGE-competent strains).\n\nthe invention provides a method for multiplex genomic alteration of a target cell population, comprising: (a) generating a combinatorial vector library in a recombineering cell population; and (b) transferring the combinatorial vector library to a target cell population.\n\ngenome engineering methods such as MAGE, CRISPR/Cas9, BuDs, ZFNs, TALEs, and TALENs are applicable to many diverse species\n\nmultiplex application of these technologies can be hindered in some organisms by the length of time required to execute the sequential rounds of engineering necessary to accumulate the combinatorial diversity in the loci of interest.\n\norganisms such as Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces spp.)\n\nare relatively slow growing and laboratory techniques used to perform genetic manipulations may take days or weeks.\n\nthe present invention provides methods and compositions to elaborate the diversity indirectly in a faster growing and easier to manipulate organism, such as E.\n\nthe genetic diversity at the desired locus is synthesized and not elaborated with a technique such as MAGE, then cloned directly into the vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) using standard methods.\n\nthe genetic diversity is synthesized and cloned directly into the vector.\n\nthe DNA is then further elaborated with a technique such as MAGE.\n\nthe vector possesses one or more selectable markers such that the vector may be selected for in both the recombineering organism and the target organism.\n\nall or a portion of the site-specific programmable nuclease system e.g., CRISPR/Cas9g, TALEN, ZFN, BuD, or homologous or analogous system\n\nthe components of the site-specific programmable nuclease system comprises the gRNA or crRNA and tracrRNA\n\nthe gRNA e.g. synthetic gRNA\n\nthe crRNA is present on the same vector.

In some embodiments, the same vector encodes one or more BuDs programmed to cut the target sequence. In some embodiments, the site-specific programmable nuclease system is directly tethered on the same DNA to the repair or donor sequence that is elaborated with a multiplex genome engineering technique (e.g.\n\nMAGE, CAGE, CRISPR/Cas9, BuDs, ZFNs, TALEs, and TALENs e.g. there is roughly a 1:1:1 ratio of DNA encoding selectable marker for the target organism, the programmable nuclease designed to cut the organism genome and the repair or donor DNA.\n\nthere may be one or more (e.g. 1, or 2, or 3, or 4, etc.) of the site-specific programmable nuclease system and repair or donor sequence on the same vector e.g.\n\none or more gRNA and donor sequence on the same vector (optionally also with Cas9 on the same vector), one or more crRNA and donor sequence on the same vector (optionally also with Cas9 on the same vector), one or more crRNA and tracrRNA and donor sequence on the same vector (optionally also with Cas9 on the same vector), one or more TALENs programmed to cut the target sequence and donor sequence on the same vector, one or more ZFNs programmed to cut the target sequence and donor sequence on the same vector, and one or more BuDs programmed to cut the target sequence and donor sequence on the same vector).\n\nsuch vectors each targeting a unique genomic locus, may be transformed together, optionally in a cyclical manner in a similar way as with MAGE (as described herein).\n\nthe systems described herein allow selection for the vector DNA, and against wild type genomic locus being targeted by the programmable nuclease, by providing relief from genome cutting through repair by the donor DNA that contains the desired mutation(s).\n\na library of plasmids is introduced into a population of host cells, the plasmids encoding and allowing for expression of Cas9 or homologous or analogous CRIPSR enzyme, and a crRNA/tracrRNA or synthetic guide RNA targeting a region of the host cell genome.\n\nCas9 is expressed from the genome or separate from the plasmid and the plasmids express only a crRNA/tracrRNA or a single synthetic guide RNA.\n\nthe tracrRNA is also expressed from the genome or separate from the plasmid and only the crRNA is encoded on the plasmid.\n\nthe plasmids encode one or more TALENs, ZFNs, BuDs, or analogous system, each further providing a donor nucleic acid for introduction into the targeted region of the host genome.\n\ndesired donor nucleic acids targeting the particular site can be introduced into the host cell and screened or selected for desired phenotype.\n\nthe donor nucleic acids are not susceptible to cutting by the Cas9 and crRNA/tracrRNA (or synthetic guide RNA), or analogous programmable nuclease described herein, that is introduced into the system.\n\nthe library of vectors may thereby allow for the screening of any number of variant donor nucleic acids, such at least about 10 2 , about 10 3 , about 10 4 , about 10 5 , about 10 5 , about 10 7 , about 10 8 , about 10 9 , about 10 10 or more, without an additional or integrating selectable marker to select for recombination events.\n\nthe library varies one or more (or all) of promoter sequences, ribosomal binding sequences, coding region variations, silent codon variations, synthetic scaffold components, and protein tags to select for optimal expression, function, and/or activity of the target.\n\nCloning methods include, by way of non-limiting example, fusion PCR and assembly PCR see, e.g. Stemmer et al.

Rev.\n\na programmable nuclease is employed in the recombineering or MAGE-competent organism, or organism where the combinatorial shuttle vector library is generated, in order to eliminate those vectors where mutations were not introduced into the desired target sequence of the target organism through the course of engineering.\n\nthe final vector library produced is substantially enriched for possession of mutated target sequences to be introduced into the target organism.\n\nthe shuttle vector encodes an origin of replication allowing for tunable control of copy number such as pETcoco-1 or pETcoco2, such that when creating the combinatorial library, a lower plasmid copy number can be utilized to elaborate the genetic diversity at the desired locus (as described herein).\n\ncopy number such as pETcoco-1 or pETcoco2\n\nthe proportion of vectors within the cell population undergoing allelic replacement with an oligonucleotide is increased at each cycle.\n\nthe copy number can be increased prior to transfer to the target organism, in order to increase yield.\n\nâ RED-mediated (or functionally similar) genetic manipulation of a compound-producing Actinomycetes may be undertaken.\n\nthe strategy employs E. coli as a surrogate to enable recominbeering with the â RED cassette.\n\nthe E. coli strain may carry a plasmid expressing â RED, and a vector containing one or more target genes or regions in the Actinomycetes or other non-recombineering cell. Recombineering is used to perform the replacement with an oligo library targeting the Actinomycetes gene of interest within the vector.\n\nthe vector may then be purified and transferred and/or conjugated or used in any other suitable transferring technique.\n\nthe genetic exchange in Actinomycetes is subsequently achieved by homologous recombination between the chromosomal locus and the recombinant vector following conjugation.\n\noriT The inclusion of oriT (RK2) allows conjugation to introduce the recombineering-modified vector into an Actinomycete (e.g. Streptomyces coelicolor ). Conjugation is more efficient than transformation of protoplasts and is readily applicable to many actinomycetes.\n\nthe potent methyl-specific restriction system of Actinomycetes e.g. Streptomyces\n\nthe potent methyl-specific restriction system of Actinomycetes e.g. Streptomyces\n\na methylation-deficient E. coli host such as, for example, ET12567 and various Dam-Dcm-strains.\n\nthe recombineering strain itself may be made methylation-deficient.\n\nVectors with an oriT (RK2) site are transmissible in trans by pUB307 in E. coli or the non-transmissible pUZ8002, which lacks a cis-acting function.\n\nâ RED-mediated recombination for Actinomycetes e.g. Streptomyces\n\ncassettes were constructed that can be selected both in E. coli and in Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces ). After a single disruption with an onT-containing cassette, further disruptions can be performed on the same vector using oriT-free cassettes containing alternative selective markers.\n\na MAGE-competent strain of E. coli can readily be used to develop a combinatorial library of Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces, S. coelicolor ) vectors targeting one or multiple Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces, S. coelicolor ) genomic loci.\n\nActinomycetes e.g. Streptomyces, S. coelicolor\n\nthe entire E. coli library would subsequently be conjugated with Actinomycetes (e.g. Streptomyces, S. coelicolor ) as outlined herein.\n\nthe combinatorial vector library can be constructed in multiple ways to facilitate multiplex genome engineering of diverse cells as described herein.\n\na vector possessing a sequence allowing conjugation with Streptomyces , such as oriT, a selectable marker and origin of replication for E. coli and one or multiple cassettes is used for construction.\n\neach cassette may be engineered by MAGE (e.g., SSAP system and/or recombinase) to create a diverse combinatorial vector library.\n\na cassette is a region of homologous DNA, with one or more insertions, deletions, or mutations introduced by MAGE (for example) or synthetic DNA method, designed to target a specific locus of the genome of the Actinomycete spp., and/or encodes one or more genes conferring function necessary or useful for one or more cassettes to recombine with its target locus in the genome of the Actimonycete spp.\n\nMAGE for example\n\nsynthetic DNA method designed to target a specific locus of the genome of the Actinomycete spp.\n\nthe cassettes are separated by one or more restriction digest sites that enable digestion by an endogenous restriction endonuclease, (e.g., Sau32391, StuI, or ScoI) or an exogenous restriction endonuclease encoded by one or more of the cassettes, under control of an inducible or constitutive promoter.\n\nan endogenous restriction endonuclease e.g., Sau32391, StuI, or ScoI\n\nan exogenous restriction endonuclease encoded by one or more of the cassettes under control of an inducible or constitutive promoter.\n\na cassette may possess one or more genetic markers that can be selected in the Actinomycete spp.\n\nthe marker enables selection of the vector prior to integration and/or the marker is capable of integrating into the genome of the Actimonycete spp. together with the region of homologous DNA, with one or more insertions, deletions, or mutations introduced by MAGE or synthetic DNA method.\n\nthe marker can be recycled for use in subsequent modifications of the genome of the Actimonycete spp. by, for example, flanking the marker sequence with site-specific recombinase recognition targets such as FRT or loxP for example, that can be excised from the genome following expression of Flp or Cre recombinase, respectively, using standard methods.\n\nthe cassette contains one or more genes, under control of an inducible, repressible, or constitutive promoter, that render the recipient strain improved in homologous recombination efficiency, e.g.: the â RED cassette from phage â ; RecE/T; homologs of the Rad52, Red-beta, Erf, Sak, Rad51 superfamily, and/or endogenous or exogenous analogs and Beta from E. coli , EF2132 from E. faecalis , OrfC from L. pneumophila, s 065 from V. cholera , plu2935 from P. luminescens , RecT from E. coli , Orf48 from L.\n\nan inducible, repressible, or constitutive promoter that render the recipient strain improved in homologous recombination efficiency\n\nthe cassette contains one or more genes, under control of an inducible, repressible, or constitutive promoter, that render the recipient strain improved in homologous recomb\n\none or more vectors are used for construction.\n\none or more vectors comprise a sequence allowing conjugation with Actinomycete spp. (e.g. Streptomyces ), such as oriT; and/or a selectable marker and origin or replication for E. coli ; and/or a cassette.\n\none or more vectors optionally further comprises a sequence which encodes a programmable site-specific nuclease system (e.g., TALEN, BuD, or CRISPR/Cas9) as described above, or one or more components of such a system, such as a tracrRNA, crRNA, or synthetic guide RNA, targeting the wild-type locus of a region of the Actimonycete spp. genome targeted for diversification by the cassette conferring the homologous sequence, as described herein, where the site-specific nuclease may be under control of an inducible, repressible, or constitutive promoter.\n\nthe cassette may be engineered to create a diverse combinatorial vector library using the methods described herein and/or by including synthesized DNA.\n\nthe cassette possesses one or more genetic markers that can be selected in the Actinomycete spp. such that, for example, the marker enables selection of the vector prior to integration; or the marker is capable of integrating into the genome of the Actimonycete spp. together with the region of homologous DNA, with one or more insertions, deletions, or mutations introduced by MAGE (for example) or synthetic DNA method.\n\nthe marker can be recycled for use in subsequent modifications of the genome of the Actimonycete spp. by flanking the marker sequence with site-specific recombinase recognition targets such as FRT or loxP for example, that can be excised from the genome following expression of Flp or Cre recombinase, respectively.\n\nconjugation can then be used to efficiently introduce the modified DNA library into Actinomycetes using previously described techniques (see, e.g., Matsushima, incorporated by reference in its entirety).\n\nthe modified DNA library can be introduced by means known in the art (by way of non-limiting example, transfection, transformation, phage, electroporation, biolistics etc.).\n\nthe number of genomic loci targeted for combinatorial mutations can be either 1:1 or 1: greater than 1 (marker:locus/loci). That is, a selection marker may be tied to the targeting of a single site or the same marker may be tied to several targeted sites. When used in a 1:1 manner, the selection ensures that the locus of interest has been modified. When used as 1:greater than 1 the marker ensures that at least one of the targeted loci have been modified. Multiple recovery cycles for the markers will lead to an accumulation of scars on the genome (e.g., loxP, FRT, etc. sites) which may lead to genomic instability, thus decreasing the overall efficiency of the approach(es) due to decreased viability in the population.\n\nscars e.g., loxP, FRT, etc. sites\n\nAnother method of selection includes the use of a site-specific nuclease (such as CRIPSR/Cas9 or a TALEN) programmed to recognize the wildtype sequence of the Actimonycete spp genomic region targeted for diversification by the cassette conferring the homologous sequence as described herein.\n\na site-specific nuclease such as CRIPSR/Cas9 or a TALEN\n\nthis approach can result in a scarless method for selecting recombinants and obviates the need for a selectable marker.\n\nrecombination with the homologous target region mutated at the wild-type locus targeted by the site-specific nuclease is the only way to escape repeated cutting by the nuclease.\n\nrecombination with the mutated sequence frees the organism from the genomic instability caused by the site-specific nuclease.\n\nthe endogenous exonuclease system(s), e.g. RecD, SbcCD, of the host Actinomycete spp. are disrupted.\n\nconjugation is used to transfer the mutated vector or plasmid from a MAGE-competent organism, e.g., Escherichia coli , to the host cell.\n\nthe conjugation may employ the oriT system described as above to transform Streptyomyces.\n\nthe plasmid or vetor system encodes the T-DNA or analogous system, to enable transfer of the mutated plasmid or vector DNA
