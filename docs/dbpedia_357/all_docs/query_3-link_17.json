        "text": "Results and Discussion\n\nWe first targeted protected dipeptide 16 as a suitable cyclization precursor. Synthetically, N-boc-protected serine 14 was coupled with nitro-phenylalanine 15 using HATU (Scheme 1A). Protection of the free alcohol was needed to avoid side reactions such as C–O bond cleavage30 or oxidation31 during the subsequent C–H activation reaction. A tert-butyldiphenyl silyl (TBDPS) group was found suitable for this purpose and also proved beneficial by improving the solubility of intermediates. We initially explored cyclization of a dipeptide substrate with the requisite N-methyl group already installed. However, in agreement with observations by Xuan,26 this derivative was found incompatible with the C–H activation step due to the inability to form a bidentate coordination with the metal.\n\nWith 16 in hand, the stage was set for investigating the C–H activation step to form the indoline five-membered ring of the targeted tricyclic system. To this end, we employed Xuan’s optimized conditions:26 Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %) and PhI(OAc)2 (2.0 equiv) in refluxing toluene. Pleasingly, indoline 12 could be isolated along with recovered starting material in a 2:1 ratio. A brief optimization of the reaction conditions showed that increasing the amount of PhI(OAc)2 to 4.0 equiv improved the yield to 50% (see Supporting Information, Table S1), but for gram-scale synthesis, we settled on the original protocol.\n\nDue to the difficult separation of the mixture of 16 and 12 obtained in the C–H activation step, the products were directly subjected to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to give DKP 17 in good overall yield (49% over four steps). It is worth noting that the sequence of reactions starting from commercially available 14 could be telescoped without chromatographic purification of intermediates to produce >9 g of 17 in a single pass.\n\nNext, we turned our attention to N-methylation of amide 17. This transformation proved challenging due to competing β-siloxy elimination in presence of strong bases like NaH or NaHMDS. Ultimately, we found that amide 17 was smoothly methylated using an excess of MeI with K2CO3 as the base32 to give N-methyl DKP 30 in 89% yield. Synthesis of the tricyclic core of glionitrin A and B (11) was then completed by liberation of the primary alcohol with HF (>95% yield). The structure of alcohol 11 was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (scXRD) analysis (Scheme 1B). The conversion of 11 into the corresponding acetate 18 was also straightforwardly accomplished in 94% yield by reaction with acetic anhydride under microwave irradiation for 2 h at 100 °C (Scheme 1A)\n\nWe then applied the same approach to diastereomeric des-nitro derivative 21 (Scheme 1C). This structure was obtained in six steps from N-boc-protected serine 14 in 17% overall yield. In a similar fashion, the corresponding glycine derivative 24 was also produced in 21% yield over four steps (Scheme 1D).\n\nWith a practical method to access to the tricyclic cores of the glionitrins and two related structures in place, we explored methods aimed at elaborating these to the corresponding epi-DTDKPs.8,22,28,29,33−35 To this end, we first investigated direct installation of the disulfide bridge by reacting DKP enolates with electrophilic sulphur.8,14 The reactions of unprotected 11, 21, and 24 or the protected 30 and 35 using various bases (LiHMDS, NaHMDS, or KHMDS) and elemental sulfur (S8) as the electrophile precursor8,14 following literature procedures8 gave slightly varying results, but in no case was formation of the corresponding epi-DTDKP products observed as evident by comparison of the crude 1H NMR spectra with those of known structures (Scheme 2).\n\nIn a brief summary, reacting alcohol 11 with LiHMDS (8.0 equiv) and S8 (1.0 equiv) with the intent of forming glionitrin A gave a mixture of indole 25 along with recovered starting material. Switching the base to NaHMDS or KHMDS gave more complex mixtures of unidentified side products together with indole 25 and unreacted 11. Similar results were obtained when switching the order of addition [LiHMDS (4.0 equiv) first and a mixture of LiHMDS (4.0 equiv)/S8 (1.0 equiv) second], decreasing the reaction temperature (−78 °C), or doubling the amounts of reagents [LiHMDS (16.0 equiv) and S8 (2.0 equiv)]. Indole formation was also observed when exposing des-nitro indoline 21 or indoline 24 to the same conditions. In the reaction of 21 with LiHMDS (8.0 equiv) and S8 (1.0 equiv), we also observed olefin 27 as a minor side product. Reactions of the corresponding O-silylated substrates under the same conditions followed a similar pattern: using LiHMDS, NaHMDS, or KHMDS as the base, silyl ethers 30 and 35 were both converted into complex mixtures.\n\nAlthough examples of successful formation of epi-DTDKPs on indoline-fused DKP scaffolds have been reported using the here-evaluated procedures in moderate to good yields,8,14,36 our results suggest that substrates like 11 are not amenable to these conditions and that the encountered difficulties are not easily circumvented by variations in reaction conditions and operational procedures.\n\nAn alternative approach to construct disulfide bridges on DKP scaffolds is the biomimetic α-oxidation with permanganate reagents pioneered by Movassaghi.32,37−42 The hemi-aminal DKPs formed with this procedure have been successfully transformed into highly complex natural product targets via acid-promoted sulfenylation.32,37,38 Inspired by this work, we explored oxidation of DKPs 18, 24, 30, and 35 with silver(I)bispyridine permanganate (Scheme 3).43\n\nThus, oxidation of silyl ether 30 with silver(I)bispyridine permanganate (8.0 equiv) in CH2Cl2 at room temperature gave a difficult to separate 40:60 mixture of unreacted starting material and C10a mono-oxidized 31 as a single diastereomer (35% yield). Trace amounts of the C3a/C10a doubly oxidized product were detected by HRMS analysis of the crude reaction mixture. Treatment of the mixture of 30 and 31 with HF provided diol 32.\n\nOxidation of acetate 18 with silver(I)bispyridine permanganate (8.0 equiv) was also evaluated and gave a mixture of C10a mono-oxidized 33 (22% yield) and C3a/C10a doubly oxidized 34 (8% yield). In contrast, des-nitro silyl ether 35, which is less deactivated at the C3a position, reacted smoothly with silver(I)bispyridine permanganate (4.0 equiv) to produce diol 36 in 46% yield as a single observed diastereomer. Similarly, oxidation of indoline 24 produced diol 37, albeit in only 12% isolated yield.\n\nAssignment of the relative configuration for the oxidized products was attempted using 2D-NMR spectroscopy experiments; however, the results were inconclusive. For 31–34 and 36/37, the differences in distance between the C10a hydroxyl group proton and protons at C3/C3a position are too small to unambiguously distinguish between the cis and trans configurations by NOESY correlations. For 32, 34, and 36/37, a further complication was magnetization transferred between the alcohol protons due to chemical exchange.\n\nSulfenylation of the obtained hemi-aminals 31, 34, and 36 was investigated next (Scheme 4). Substrates with hemi-aminals at C10a cleanly eliminated into the corresponding indoles, whereas Lewis acid-promoted thio-aminal formation proved fruitful at the C3a position. The reaction of alcohol 31 with BF3·Et2O in the presence of 4-methoxy-α-toluenethiol thus gave indole 38 (>95% yield). Under the same reaction conditions, diol 34 was converted into C3a sulfenylated indole 39 (60% yield) and diol 36 into C3a sulfenylated indole 40 (74% yield).\n\nFinally, we evaluated conversion of indole 38 to the corresponding C10a sulfenylated product with 4-methoxy-α-toluenethiol using various acids44 (camphorsulfonic acid, HBr, or BF3·Et2O). In all cases, 38 was recovered unreacted.\n\nThus, while the tricyclic substrates were successfully oxidized at C10a, and in case of 18, 24, and 35, also at C3/C3a, the propensity to eliminate to the corresponding indoles was found prohibitive for the purpose of conversion to the corresponding epi-DTDKP natural products under the investigated conditions.\n\nExperimental Section\n\nGeneral Procedures\n\nAll reactions were conducted in air unless otherwise stated. Reactions involving hydrogen fluoride were carried out in plastic vessels. The experiment involving microwave irradiation was performed using a Biotage Initiator+.
