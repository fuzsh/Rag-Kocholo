The precipitate was suspended and diluted in saline and the diluted precipitate was inoculated on YM agar medium (YMA) and Capex-Dox agar medium (CDA), followed by culture at 25° C. for 10 days. Single strain was separated and thereby 300 strains were obtained. Among them, bacterial and fungus strains to be used for co-culture were selected, which were then inoculated in Capex-Dox liquid medium, followed by culture in a 25° C. shaking incubator for 5-7 days. Chromosomal DNA of the obtained strain was separated and 16S rDNA sequencing was performed to identify the strain. As a result, the strain KMK-001 had 98.0% homology with Sphingomonas sp. A1XXyl1-5, suggesting that it was a novel strain of Sphingomonas. KMK-001 formed yellow mucous colonies in Cap...\n\nexample 2\n\nCo-Culture of the Novel Sphingomonas Sp. KMK-001 and Aspergillus Sp. Strain KMC-901\n\n[0083]The present inventors inoculated the novel bacterial strain KMK-001 and fungus strain KMC-901 respectively in Capex-Dox liquid medium, followed by culture in a 25° C. shaking incubator for 3 days. The said two strains were cultured in 1 l Erlenmeyer flasks containing 0.5 l of Capex-Dox liquid medium for mass-production. 2 days later, 250 μl of the fungus strain KMC-901 culture solution was added to the Sphingomonas sp. strain KMK-001 culture solution, followed by co-culture. The co-culture solution containing those strains was observed under microscope. As shown in FIG. 5, bacterial strain was shown along with the fungus strain around the mycelium (see FIG. 5).\n\n[0084]Production of a new compound in the co-culture solution was investigated by HPLC.

The extract was dried under reduced pressure at 30° C. using a rotary vacuum evaporator and the resultant extract proceeded to reversed phase column chromatography, and as a result, 6 fractions were obtained. Water and acetonitrile were used for elution. Precisely, elution was started with 20% acetonitrile / water and the content of acetonitrile was raised 20% every time. 100% methanol was used as the final solvent. The obtained fractions were analyzed by HPLC and as a result, the novel glionitrin was confirmed in 60% acetonitrile / water fraction. The fraction was purified by normal phase liquid chromatography using ethyl acetate and methylene chloride as solvents under isocratic condition of 90% methylene chloride / ethyl acetate and 60% methylene chloride / ethyl acetate.

The glionitrin herein has strong cytotoxic effect on cancer cells and has antibiotic effect on 10 pathogenic bacteria including the novel Sphingomonas sp. bacterial strain KMK-001, so that it can be effectively applied in antibiotics or anti-cancer agents.\n\nDescription\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD[0001]The present invention relates to a co-culture method of a Sphingomonas sp. bacterial strain and an Aspergillus sp. fungus strain, in which the novel Sphingomonas sp. bacterial strain KMK-001 is cultured in a liquid medium and the novel Aspergillus sp. strain KMC-901 separately cultured in another liquid medium is added to the above culture solution, a novel glionitrin biosynthesized therefrom and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the said glionitrin or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient.BACKGROUND ART[0002]Studies have been undergoing to obtain a new material from natural sources. However, taking so much time, costs and labor for repeated separation processes from base materials is a major barrier for improving efficiency in the development of a new material having biological activity from the nature. One of important factors to develop a novel drug is to acquire a new material. “A new material development technique using co-cultu...\n\nClaims\n\nthe structure of the environmentally friendly knitted fabric provided by the present invention; figure 2 Flow chart of the yarn wrapping machine for environmentally friendly knitted fabrics and storage devices; image 3 Is the parameter map of the yarn covering machine\n\nLogin to view more\n\nApplication Information\n\nPatent Timeline\n\nApplication Date:The date an application was filed.\n\nPublication Date:The date a patent or application was officially published.\n\nFirst Publication Date:The earliest publication date of a patent with the same application number.\n\nIssue Date:Publication date of the patent grant document.\n\nPCT Entry Date:The Entry date of PCT National Phase.\n\nEstimated Expiry Date:The statutory expiry date of a patent right according to the Patent Law, and it is the longest term of protection that the patent right can achieve without the termination of the patent right due to other reasons(Term extension factor has been taken into account ).\n\nInvalid Date:Actual expiry date is based on effective date or publication date of legal transaction data of invalid patent.\n\nLogin to view more\n\nPatent Type & Authority Applications(United States)\n\nIPC IPC(8): A61K35/74C12N1/20C12N1/14C07F15/00C07D241/36C07D285/15C12P17/16C12P17/18C12P13/00A61K31/555A61K31/498A61K31/548A61P31/04A61P35/00A23L29/00\n\nCPCA23L1/0345A23L1/30A23L1/3014C12N1/14C12R1/66C12P17/182C12P17/185C12P39/00C12R1/01C12N1/20A23L29/065A23L33/10A23L33/135A61P31/04A61P35/00C12N1/145C12N1/205C12R2001/01C12R2001/66C12N1/00C12N1/16\n\nInventor YANG, HYUN OKKWON, HAK CHEOLPARK, HYUN-BONGYOO, JI-HYE\n\nOwner KOREA INST OF SCI & TECH\n\nWho we serve\n\nR&D Engineer\n\nR&D Manager\n\nIP Professional\n\nWhy Eureka\n\nIndustry Leading Data Capabilities\n\nPowerful AI technology\n\nPatent DNA Extraction\n\nSocial media\n\nTry Eureka\n\nBrowse by: Latest US Patents, China's latest patents, Technical Efficacy Thesaurus, Application Domain, Technology Topic.\n\n© 2024 PatSnap.
