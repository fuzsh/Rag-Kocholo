        "text": "Introduction\n\nThiomethylation is deployed for the detoxification of xenobiotic thiols in bacteria, plants, and mammals, and is mediated by thiol methyltransferases (TMTs), which detoxify a broad range of reactive endogenous or foreign thiols through the formation of less reactive thiomethyl derivatives (\n\nBremer and Greenberg, 1961\n\nBremer J.\n\nGreenberg D.\n\nEnzymic methylation of foreign sulfhydryl compounds.\n\n,\n\nWeisiger et al., 1980\n\nWeisiger R.A.\n\nPinkus L.M.\n\nJakoby W.B.\n\nThiol S-methyltransferase: suggested role in detoxication of intestinal hydrogen sulfide.\n\n). The human thiopurine S-methyltransferase, which participates in the detoxification of xenobiotics, is a well-characterized member of this enzyme family (\n\nPeng et al., 2008\n\nPeng Y.\n\nFeng Q.\n\nWilk D.\n\nAdjei A.A.\n\nSalavaggione O.E.\n\nWeinshilboum R.M.\n\nYee V.C.\n\nStructural basis of substrate recognition in thiopurine s-methyltransferase.\n\n).\n\nSeveral plant TMTs have been implicated in the detoxification of reactive thiol-containing metabolites that may otherwise inhibit enzymes associated with aerobic respiration and oxidative metabolism. A TMT isolated from Brassica oleracea L (cTMT1) was shown to methylate thiocyanate. Because thiocyanate is an extremely reactive product of glucosinolate degradation, cTMT1 is most likely responsible for enzymatic detoxification within this pathway (\n\nAttieh et al., 2000\n\nAttieh J.\n\nSparace S.A.\n\nSaini H.S.\n\nPurification and properties of multiple isoforms of a novel thiol methyltransferase involved in the production of volatile sulfur compounds from Brassica oleracea.\n\n). PpSABATH1, a TMT from the moss Physcomitrella patens, showed a high level of activity toward thiobenzoic acid. Interestingly, the expression of PpSABATH1 was induced by the treatment of P. patens with thiobenzoic acid. Additionally, the constitutive expression of PpSABATH1 in tobacco plants resulted in an enhanced tolerance to thiobenzoic acid. These results suggest that PpSABATH1 may have a role in the detoxification of xenobiotic thiols (\n\nZhao et al., 2012\n\nZhao N.\n\nFerrer J.-L.\n\nMoon H.S.\n\nKapteyn J.\n\nZhuang X.\n\nHasebe M.\n\nStewart Jr., C.N.\n\nGang D.R.\n\nChen F.\n\nA SABATH Methyltransferase from the moss Physcomitrella patens catalyzes S-methylation of thiols and has a role in detoxification.\n\n). The Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) O-methyltransferase CrSMT1, the true biological function of which remains unknown, has been shown to methylate a wide range of aliphatic and aryl alcohols and thiols (\n\nCoiner et al., 2006\n\nCoiner H.\n\nSchröder G.\n\nWehinger E.\n\nLiu C.-J.\n\nNoel J.P.\n\nSchwab W.\n\nSchröder J.\n\nMethylation of sulfhydryl groups: a new function for a family of small molecule plant O-methyltransferases.\n\n). Remarkably, S-methyltransferases have only been definitively classified in relation to detoxification mechanisms and primary metabolism, although the activity has long been implicated in numerous secondary metabolite pathways (\n\nBoente and Kirby, 1991\n\nBoente M.\n\nKirby G.\n\nBiosynthesis of hyalodendrin and didethiobis (methylthio) hyalodendrin, sulphur-containing 2, 5-dioxopiperazines of the 3S, 6S series.\n\n,\n\nKirby et al., 1980\n\nKirby G.W.\n\nRobins D.J.\n\nSefton M.A.\n\nTalekar R.R.\n\nBiosynthesis of bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin, a new metabolite of Gliocladium deliquescens.\n\n,\n\nTaylor, 1963\n\nTaylor A.\n\nSporidesmins. Isolation and Structure of Sporidesmin-D and Sporidesmin-F. J. Chem. Soc.\n\n). Recently, the Streptomyces lasaliensis S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase Ecm18 was shown to catalyze the conversion of a disulfide bond in the precursor antibiotic triostatin A to the thioacetal bridge of the nonribosomal dipsipeptide echinomycin (\n\nHotta et al., 2014\n\nHotta K.\n\nKeegan R.M.\n\nRanganathan S.\n\nFang M.\n\nBibby J.\n\nWinn M.D.\n\nSato M.\n\nLian M.\n\nWatanabe K.\n\nRigden D.J.\n\nKim C.Y.\n\nConversion of a disulfide bond into a thioacetal group during echinomycin biosynthesis.\n\n). This is an unusual example of a thiol-directed methyltransferase involved in secondary metabolism.\n\nGliotoxin is a nonribosomally synthesized, redox active metabolite secreted by several fungal species and contributes to the virulence of the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus (\n\nDagenais and Keller, 2009\n\nDagenais T.R.T.\n\nKeller N.P.\n\nPathogenesis of Aspergillus fumigatus in Invasive Aspergillosis.\n\n). Gliotoxin is an epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) class fungal toxin containing a disulfide bridge responsible for the deleterious effects of this toxin (\n\nKwon-Chung and Sugui, 2009\n\nKwon-Chung K.J.\n\nSugui J.A.\n\nWhat do we know about the role of gliotoxin in the pathobiology of Aspergillus fumigatus?.\n\n). Modification of this rare structural motif by reduction and S-methylation significantly depletes the bioactivity of this metabolite (\n\nTrown and Bilello, 1972\n\nTrown P.W.\n\nBilello J.A.\n\nMechanism of action of gliotoxin: elimination of activity by sulfhydryl compounds.\n\n). Several mono- and bis-methylthio derivatives of gliotoxin have also been discovered in various fungi. Bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin (BmGT; Figure S1 available online) is the most well characterized of these gliotoxin derivatives (\n\nForseth et al., 2011\n\nForseth R.R.\n\nFox E.M.\n\nChung D.\n\nHowlett B.J.\n\nKeller N.P.\n\nSchroeder F.C.\n\nIdentification of cryptic products of the gliotoxin gene cluster using NMR-based comparative metabolomics and a model for gliotoxin biosynthesis.\n\n). First identified in Gliocladium deliquescens, BmGT appears to be formed by the irreversible disulfide bridge reduction and S-methylation of exogenous gliotoxin, as demonstrated by feeding [14C]gliotoxin to G. deliquescens (\n\nKirby et al., 1980\n\nKirby G.W.\n\nRobins D.J.\n\nSefton M.A.\n\nTalekar R.R.\n\nBiosynthesis of bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin, a new metabolite of Gliocladium deliquescens.\n\n). The enzyme that catalyzes this biotransformation has remained elusive. BmGT has also been detected in A. fumigatus (\n\nAmitani et al., 1995\n\nAmitani R.\n\nTaylor G.\n\nElezis E.N.\n\nLlewellyn-Jones C.\n\nMitchell J.\n\nKuze F.\n\nCole P.J.\n\nWilson R.\n\nPurification and characterization of factors produced by Aspergillus fumigatus which affect human ciliated respiratory epithelium.\n\n), Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (\n\nGuimarães et al., 2010\n\nGuimarães D.O.\n\nBorges W.S.\n\nVieira N.J.\n\nde Oliveira L.F.\n\nda Silva C.H.T.P.\n\nLopes N.P.\n\nDias L.G.\n\nDurán-Patrón R.\n\nCollado I.G.\n\nPupo M.T.\n\nDiketopiperazines produced by endophytic fungi found in association with two Asteraceae species.\n\n), Penicillium sp.

S-methylation of dithiol metabolites also extends to bacteria such as Streptomyces clavuligerus, which has been shown to produce a bis-thiomethylated derivative of the dithiolpyrrolone antibiotic, holomycin (\n\nLi et al., 2012\n\nLi B.\n\nForseth R.R.\n\nBowers A.A.\n\nSchroeder F.C.\n\nWalsh C.T.\n\nA backup plan for self-protection: S-methylation of holomycin biosynthetic intermediates in Streptomyces clavuligerus.\n\n). Gliotoxin is encoded by a 13 gene cluster in A. fumigatus (\n\nGardiner and Howlett, 2005\n\nGardiner D.M.\n\nHowlett B.J.\n\nBioinformatic and expression analysis of the putative gliotoxin biosynthetic gene cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus.\n\n) and it has been demonstrated that the gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT, encoded within this gli cluster, protects A. fumigatus against exogenous gliotoxin and is essential for gliotoxin biosynthesis (\n\nScharf et al., 2010\n\nScharf D.H.\n\nRemme N.\n\nHeinekamp T.\n\nHortschansky P.\n\nBrakhage A.A.\n\nHertweck C.\n\nTransannular disulfide formation in gliotoxin biosynthesis and its role in self-resistance of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus.\n\n,\n\nSchrettl et al., 2010\n\nSchrettl M.\n\nCarberry S.\n\nKavanagh K.\n\nHaas H.\n\nJones G.W.\n\nO’Brien J.\n\nNolan A.\n\nStephens J.\n\nFenelon O.\n\nDoyle S.\n\nSelf-protection against gliotoxin—a component of the gliotoxin biosynthetic cluster, GliT, completely protects Aspergillus fumigatus against exogenous gliotoxin.\n\n). Subsequently, a similar mechanism for self-protection against holomycin was revealed in S. clavuligerus, where HlmI catalyzes disulfide bridge closure in holomycin (\n\nLi et al., 2012\n\nLi B.\n\nForseth R.R.\n\nBowers A.A.\n\nSchroeder F.C.\n\nWalsh C.T.\n\nA backup plan for self-protection: S-methylation of holomycin biosynthetic intermediates in Streptomyces clavuligerus.\n\n). Deletion of hlmI impaired holomycin biosynthesis and sensitized S. clavuligerus to exogenous holomycin, as had been observed for gliotoxin in A. fumigatus. In bacteria, thiomethylation has been posited as an additional or backup strategy, to disulfide bridge closure, for self-protection during holomycin biosynthesis, and it has been proposed that S-methylation of biosynthetic intermediates, or possibly shunt metabolites, protects cellular components against these reactive species (\n\nGuo et al., 2013\n\nGuo C.-J.\n\nYeh H.-H.\n\nChiang Y.-M.\n\nSanchez J.F.\n\nChang S.-L.\n\nBruno K.S.\n\nWang C.C.C.\n\nBiosynthetic pathway for the epipolythiodioxopiperazine acetylaranotin in Aspergillus terreus revealed by genome-based deletion analysis.\n\n,\n\nLi et al., 2012\n\nLi B.\n\nForseth R.R.\n\nBowers A.A.\n\nSchroeder F.C.\n\nWalsh C.T.\n\nA backup plan for self-protection: S-methylation of holomycin biosynthetic intermediates in Streptomyces clavuligerus.\n\n). Here, we conclusively identify a bis-thiomethyltransferase and confirm its involvement in regulating gliotoxin production, and not self-protection, in A. fumigatus. Interestingly, the enzyme is not encoded within the gli cluster.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis work comprises a characterization of an enzyme responsible for nonribosomal peptide bis-thiomethylation in microbial secondary metabolism, whereby GtmA catalyzes BmGT biosynthesis in A. fumigatus. We unambiguously demonstrate that BmGT production acts as a negative regulatory mechanism for gli cluster expression by disrupting the gliotoxin-mediated gli cluster positive feedback system (Figure 6)—a model that may be applicable to all ETPs synthesized by various filamentous fungi. Surprisingly, gtmA is located outside the gli cluster despite the fact that BmGT production is conserved across all gliotoxin-producing species. We show that unlike the gliotoxin oxidoreductase GliT, GtmA is not essential for gliotoxin biosynthesis or self-protection in A. fumigatus.\n\nThus, exogenous gliotoxin can be converted to BmGT by A. fumigatus and methionine-derived methyl groups facilitate this bioconversion. Previously, it has been demonstrated that G. deliquescens could convert exogenous gliotoxin to BmGT (\n\nKirby et al., 1980\n\nKirby G.W.\n\nRobins D.J.\n\nSefton M.A.\n\nTalekar R.R.\n\nBiosynthesis of bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin, a new metabolite of Gliocladium deliquescens.\n\n), indeed this metabolite has been identified to be endogenously produced by many fungal species (\n\nAmitani et al., 1995\n\nAmitani R.\n\nTaylor G.\n\nElezis E.N.\n\nLlewellyn-Jones C.\n\nMitchell J.\n\nKuze F.\n\nCole P.J.\n\nWilson R.\n\nPurification and characterization of factors produced by Aspergillus fumigatus which affect human ciliated respiratory epithelium.\n\n,\n\nGuimarães et al., 2010\n\nGuimarães D.O.\n\nBorges W.S.\n\nVieira N.J.\n\nde Oliveira L.F.\n\nda Silva C.H.T.P.\n\nLopes N.P.\n\nDias L.G.\n\nDurán-Patrón R.\n\nCollado I.G.\n\nPupo M.T.\n\nDiketopiperazines produced by endophytic fungi found in association with two Asteraceae species.\n\n,\n\nIntaraudom et al., 2013\n\nIntaraudom C.\n\nBoonyuen N.\n\nSuvannakad R.\n\nRachtawee P.\n\nPittayakhajonwut P.\n\nPenicolinates A–E from endophytic Penicillium sp.

It has been proposed that bis-thiomethylation represents a back-up detoxification strategy to the GliT-mediated gliotoxin self-protection system in A. fumigatus. Further, it has been speculated, not unreasonably, that the gli cluster-encoded GliN may be responsible for gliotoxin bis-thiomethylation (\n\nLi and Walsh, 2011\n\nLi B.\n\nWalsh C.T.\n\nStreptomyces clavuligerus HlmI is an intramolecular disulfide-forming dithiol oxidase in holomycin biosynthesis.\n\n). However, although endogenous or exogenous gliotoxin clearly underwent conversion to BmGT in A. fumigatus, our initial attempts to detect bis-thiomethylation activity in wild-type lysates were unsuccessful. Extensive experimentation effected resolution of this issue whereby in vitro BmGT formation was readily detectable by LC-MS in reaction mixtures containing Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)-reduced gliotoxin, SAM, and A. fumigatus ΔgliT mycelial lysates. Thus, GliT absence facilitated GtmA-mediated gliotoxin bis-thiomethylation, which infers that dithiogliotoxin is a cosubstrate for both enzymes (Figure 6). Fractionation of A. fumigatus ΔgliT mycelial lysates via a combination of anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography resulted in a semi-pure protein preparation which retained gliotoxin bis-thiomethylation activity. Subsequent high-sensitivity shotgun mass spectrometric analysis of this fraction revealed the presence of a putative methyltransferase (AFUA_2G11120; GtmA), which had also been observed to undergo significantly increased expression in transcriptomic analysis of A. fumigatus ATCC46645 and ΔgliT46645 (G.O., S.H., T.M. Keane, D.A.F., G.W.J., and S.D., unpublished data; Figure 3A).\n\nLocalization of gtmA on chromosome 2, distal to the gli cluster on chromosome 6 (\n\nCramer et al., 2006\n\nCramer Jr., R.A.\n\nGamcsik M.P.\n\nBrooking R.M.\n\nNajvar L.K.\n\nKirkpatrick W.R.\n\nPatterson T.F.\n\nBalibar C.J.\n\nGraybill J.R.\n\nPerfect J.R.\n\nAbraham S.N.\n\nSteinbach W.J.\n\nDisruption of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase in Aspergillus fumigatus eliminates gliotoxin production.\n\n), is highly relevant to assigning a main role for gtmA in either self-protection against a toxic biosynthetic intermediate, or as a regulator of gliotoxin production. It has been proposed that the colocalization of genes within metabolite-encoding clusters has evolved to protect against toxic biosynthetic intermediates (\n\nMcGary et al., 2013\n\nMcGary K.L.\n\nSlot J.C.\n\nRokas A.\n\nPhysical linkage of metabolic genes in fungi is an adaptation against the accumulation of toxic intermediate compounds.\n\n). Our demonstration that gtmA deletion completely abrogates BmGT formation, but does not enhance sensitivity to exogenous gliotoxin, is in complete accordance with this proposal- and strongly underpins our conclusion that GtmA is primarily a negative regulator of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Moreover, our data endorse the key role of GliT, located within the gli cluster, in mediating self-protection against reactive dithiogliotoxin (Figure 6), and increased gli cluster expression consequent to gliotoxin exposure.\n\nGliotoxin bis-thiomethylation appears to be controlled by transcription factors involved in regulating A. fumigatus secondary metabolism, whereby as an uncharacterized gene, gtmA expression was found to be significantly attenuated in A. fumigatus ΔlaeA (\n\nPerrin et al., 2007\n\nPerrin R.M.\n\nFedorova N.D.\n\nBok J.W.\n\nCramer R.A.\n\nWortman J.R.\n\nKim H.S.\n\nNierman W.C.\n\nKeller N.P.\n\nTranscriptional regulation of chemical diversity in Aspergillus fumigatus by LaeA.\n\n). veA is a global regulator of secondary metabolism in A. fumigatus and gtmA was noted as significantly downregulated in a veA overexpression mutant (and also downregulated in ΔveA;\n\nDhingra et al., 2013\n\nDhingra S.\n\nLind A.L.\n\nLin H.-C.\n\nTang Y.\n\nRokas A.\n\nCalvo A.M.\n\nThe fumagillin gene cluster, an example of hundreds of genes under veA control in Aspergillus fumigatus.\n\n). Indeed, differentially regulated genes in these mutants were dramatically enriched for secondary metabolism-associated processes. In addition, stuA encodes a developmental transcription factor and regulates the expression of six secondary metabolite gene clusters in A. fumigatus (including gliotoxin) and gtmA was also differentially regulated in ΔstuA (\n\nTwumasi-Boateng et al., 2009\n\nTwumasi-Boateng K.\n\nYu Y.\n\nChen D.\n\nGravelat F.N.\n\nNierman W.C.\n\nSheppard D.C.\n\nTranscriptional profiling identifies a role for BrlA in the response to nitrogen depletion and for StuA in the regulation of secondary metabolite clusters in Aspergillus fumigatus.\n\n) and downregulated during co-incubation of A. fumigatus with human immature dendritic cells (\n\nMorton et al., 2011\n\nMorton C.O.\n\nVarga J.J.\n\nHornbach A.\n\nMezger M.\n\nSennefelder H.\n\nKneitz S.\n\nKurzai O.\n\nKrappmann S.\n\nEinsele H.\n\nNierman W.C.\n\net al.\n\nThe temporal dynamics of differential gene expression in Aspergillus fumigatus interacting with human immature dendritic cells in vitro.\n\n).\n\nActivity analysis of purified recombinant GtmA confirmed that this enzyme catalyzes dithiogliotoxin bis-thiomethylation. There are few, if any, reports of fungal thiomethyltransferases, and it appears that no bis-thiomethyltransferase has been identified to date. The thiomethyltransferase (PpSABATH1) identified in a bryophyte P. patens, which can monomethylate a range of thiol-containing compounds, including thiobenzoic acid in a SAM-dependent manner, has been proposed to play a role in the detoxification of xenobiotic thiols (\n\nZhao et al., 2012\n\nZhao N.\n\nFerrer J.-L.\n\nMoon H.S.\n\nKapteyn J.\n\nZhuang X.\n\nHasebe M.\n\nStewart Jr., C.N.\n\nGang D.R.\n\nChen F.\n\nA SABATH Methyltransferase from the moss Physcomitrella patens catalyzes S-methylation of thiols and has a role in detoxification.\n\n). However, deletion of gtmA from A. fumigatus, which completely abrogated BmGT production, did not result in acquisition of a gliotoxin- or H2O2-sensitive phenotype, which leads us to conclude that GtmA is not primarily involved in detoxification of gliotoxin, or related biosynthetic intermediates (\n\nForseth et al., 2011\n\nForseth R.R.\n\nFox E.M.\n\nChung D.\n\nHowlett B.J.\n\nKeller N.P.\n\nSchroeder F.C.\n\nIdentification of cryptic products of the gliotoxin gene cluster using NMR-based comparative metabolomics and a model for gliotoxin biosynthesis.\n\n) as has been previously proposed (\n\nLi et al., 2012\n\nLi B.\n\nForseth R.R.\n\nBowers A.A.\n\nSchroeder F.C.\n\nWalsh C.T.\n\nA backup plan for self-protection: S-methylation of holomycin biosynthetic intermediates in Streptomyces clavuligerus.\n\n). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that GliT activity compensates for absence of GtmA, we considered that a counter-balance for the positive regulation of gli cluster expression by gliotoxin (\n\nCramer et al., 2006\n\nCramer Jr., R.A.\n\nGamcsik M.P.\n\nBrooking R.M.\n\nNajvar L.K.\n\nKirkpatrick W.R.\n\nPatterson T.F.\n\nBalibar C.J.\n\nGraybill J.R.\n\nPerfect J.R.\n\nAbraham S.N.\n\nSteinbach W.J.\n\nDisruption of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase in Aspergillus fumigatus eliminates gliotoxin production.\n\n,\n\nDavis et al., 2011\n\nDavis C.\n\nCarberry S.\n\nSchrettl M.\n\nSingh I.\n\nStephens J.C.\n\nBarry S.M.\n\nKavanagh K.\n\nChallis G.L.\n\nBrougham D.\n\nDoyle S.\n\nThe role of glutathione S-transferase GliG in gliotoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus.\n\n,\n\nSchrettl et al., 2010\n\nSchrettl M.\n\nCarberry S.\n\nKavanagh K.\n\nHaas H.\n\nJones G.W.\n\nO’Brien J.\n\nNolan A.\n\nStephens J.\n\nFenelon O.\n\nDoyle S.\n\nSelf-protection against gliotoxin—a component of the gliotoxin biosynthetic cluster, GliT, completely protects Aspergillus fumigatus against exogenous gliotoxin.\n\n) presented an alternative purpose for BmGT formation. In fact, no consideration has heretofore been given to a mechanism by which gliotoxin-induced gli cluster activity can be downregulated. Now, we propose that BmGT biosynthesis via GtmA, instead of GliT-catalyzed de novo gliotoxin formation, represents a postbiosynthetic “off-switch” for gliotoxin biosynthesis, and leads to diminution of gli cluster expression, and consequent diminished gliotoxin biosynthesis (Figure 6). This hypothesis is underpinned by increased abundance of key gliotoxin biosynthetic enzymes (GliP, GliM, and GliF) in A. fumigatus ΔgtmA compared to wild-type or gtmAc, under conditions permissive for gliotoxin biosynthesis, as well as by the significant elevation (p < 0.0056) in gliotoxin production in A. fumigatus ΔgtmA under these conditions. Moreover, the positive regulation of gtmA expression and GtmA abundance by exposure to elevated gliotoxin levels further consolidates the biological role of this enzyme in attenuating gli cluster activity and gliotoxin biosynthesis. Importantly, significantly elevated abundance of gliotoxin-related biosynthetic enzymes exclude the possibility that increased gliotoxin biosynthesis is simply due to absence of “competing” BmGT biosynthesis (Figure 6). Thus, ETP bis-thiomethylation represents a strategy for suppressing ETP biosynthesis, as opposed to, or in addition to, acting as an alternative self-protection strategy. Nonetheless, removal of dithiogliotoxin by bis-thiomethylation likely confers some indirect element of self-protection against this reactive biosynthetic intermediate. Just as A. fumigatus ΔgtmA facilitates gliotoxin overproduction, deletion mutants of gtmA orthologs in other ETP-producing fungi may result in similar outcomes, in addition to attenuating the bis-thiomethylation of reactive biosynthetic intermediates (\n\nForseth et al., 2011\n\nForseth R.R.\n\nFox E.M.\n\nChung D.\n\nHowlett B.J.\n\nKeller N.P.\n\nSchroeder F.C.\n\nIdentification of cryptic products of the gliotoxin gene cluster using NMR-based comparative metabolomics and a model for gliotoxin biosynthesis.\n\n). Interestingly, overexpression of RsmA, a Yap-like bZIP transcriptional enhancer, in A. fumigatus (OErsmA) resulted in increased gliT expression, enhanced production of gliotoxin and resulted in the effective abolition of BmGT formation (\n\nSekonyela et al., 2013\n\nSekonyela R.\n\nPalmer J.M.\n\nBok J.-W.\n\nJain S.\n\nBerthier E.\n\nForseth R.\n\nSchroeder F.\n\nKeller N.P.\n\nRsmA regulates Aspergillus fumigatus gliotoxin cluster metabolites including cyclo(L-Phe-L-Ser), a potential new diagnostic marker for invasive aspergillosis.\n\n). Our observation that GtmA is the SAM-dependent methyltransferase that bis-thiomethylates GT-(SH)2, is in complete accordance with these observations and provides a definitive explanation for the loss of BmGT formation by A. fumigatus OErsmA.\n\nThe definitive demonstration that GtmA bis-thiomethylates GT-(SH)2 raises the question as to the function of both methyltransferases encoded within the gli cluster. We hypothesize that while gliN most likely encodes the N-methyltransferase that inserts the N-CH3 in gliotoxin, gliM potentially encodes an O-methyltransferase that transiently modifies a gliotoxin biosynthetic intermediate/shunt metabolite. Indeed such an intermediate, 6-benzyl-6-hydroxy-1-methoxy-3-methylenepiperazine-2,5-dione, has been identified by two groups following deletion of A. fumigatus gliG (\n\nDavis et al., 2011\n\nDavis C.\n\nCarberry S.\n\nSchrettl M.\n\nSingh I.\n\nStephens J.C.\n\nBarry S.M.\n\nKavanagh K.\n\nChallis G.L.\n\nBrougham D.\n\nDoyle S.\n\nThe role of glutathione S-transferase GliG in gliotoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus fumigatus.\n\n,\n\nScharf et al., 2011\n\nScharf D.H.\n\nRemme N.\n\nHabel A.\n\nChankhamjon P.\n\nScherlach K.\n\nHeinekamp T.\n\nHortschansky P.\n\nBrakhage A.A.\n\nHertweck C.\n\nA dedicated glutathione S-transferase mediates carbon-sulfur bond formation in gliotoxin biosynthesis.\n\n).\n\nWe inferred GtmA orthology using three approaches. First proteins were located that shared a bidirectional best hit to A. fumigatus GtmA (AFUA_2G11120). Second, a GtmA phylogenetic tree was reconstructed (Figure S6A) and finally we viewed the synteny around GtmA homologs to confirm orthology (Figure S6B). All proteins that share a bidirectional BlastP hit with A. fumigatus GtmA are located in a single clade (Figure S6, clade-A). Based on the GtmA phylogeny, paralogs seem to have arisen in a species/lineage dependent manner as some species such as A. niger and Nectria hematococca contain multiple homologs (4 and 6, respectively), while others such as A. nidulans contain a single GtmA homolog. The most robust manner to infer orthology is by phylogenetic reconstruction and confirmation by synteny. Our phylogenetic tree inferred a GtmA ortholog clade containing A. clavatus, N. fischeri, A. fumigatus, A. niger and A. carbonarius (Figure S6, clade-C). These species, along with Penicillium chrysogenum, A. terreus, A. oryzae, A. flavus, and A. nidulans all belong to the Eurotiales order (Figure S6, clade-B). A. terreus and P. chrysogenum both contain proteins that have reciprocal best blast hits to A. fumigatus GtmA yet neither is found within the GtmA ortholog clade (Figure S6A). However based on our synteny analysis, we can confirm that both species possess orthologs of GtmA (Figure S6B). Based on our phylogeny and reciprocal best-hit strategy, there are two scenarios to explain the evolutionary history of GtmA. First, GtmA is the result of a duplication of the ortholog of AFUA_4G14510 in the last common ancestor of all these species. Species-specific losses of GtmA have since occurred in A. terreus, A. oryzae, A. flavus and A. nidulans. Alternatively, AFUA_4G14510 may be the result of GtmA duplication with subsequent retention of the GtmA paralog and loss of the GtmA ortholog in these species. The presence of GtmA orthologs in fungi nonpermissive for gliotoxin biosynthesis (e.g., A. niger) is interesting and perhaps represents a self-protection mechanism in these species.\n\nThe mechanism responsible for bis-thiomethyl ETP biosynthesis is of substantial interest due to the clear value of these natural products. Furthermore, SAM-dependent methyltransferases have been established as highly versatile enzymes for applications in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, chemical biology, and other areas of biotechnology (\n\nStruck et al., 2012\n\nStruck A.W.\n\nThompson M.L.\n\nWong L.S.\n\nMicklefield J.\n\nS-adenosyl-methionine-dependent methyltransferases: highly versatile enzymes in biocatalysis, biosynthesis and other biotechnological applications.\n\n), because the chemospecific and regiospecific methylation of natural products using classical chemical alkylating agents requires multistep reactions that can be costly and time consuming (\n\nWessjohann et al., 2013\n\nWessjohann L.A.\n\nKeim J.\n\nWeigel B.\n\nDippe M.\n\nAlkylating enzymes.\n\n). However, despite the fact that a vast number of natural product methyltransferases have been characterized, TMTs are a largely unclassified group of biosynthetic enzymes (\n\nLiscombe et al., 2012\n\nLiscombe D.K.\n\nLouie G.V.\n\nNoel J.P.\n\nArchitectures, mechanisms and molecular evolution of natural product methyltransferases.\n\n).\n\nAlthough initially regarded as inactive versions of toxic ETPs, there has been a renewed interest in the biological properties of ETP bis-thiomethyl derivatives (\n\nWatts et al., 2010\n\nWatts K.R.\n\nRatnam J.\n\nAng K.H.\n\nTenney K.\n\nCompton J.E.\n\nMcKerrow J.\n\nCrews P.\n\nAssessing the trypanocidal potential of natural and semi-synthetic diketopiperazines from two deep water marine-derived fungi.\n\n). BmGT has also been shown to display anti-angiogenic activity (\n\nLee et al., 2001\n\nLee H.J.\n\nLee J.H.\n\nHwang B.Y.\n\nKim H.S.\n\nLee J.J.\n\nAnti-angiogenic activities of gliotoxin and its methylthioderivative, fungal metabolites.\n\n), antibacterial activity against both methicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (\n\nLi et al., 2006\n\nLi X.\n\nKim S.K.\n\nNam K.W.\n\nKang J.S.\n\nChoi H.D.\n\nSon B.W.\n\nA new antibacterial dioxopiperazine alkaloid related to gliotoxin from a marine isolate of the fungus Pseudallescheria.\n\n), and the ability to specifically inhibit platelet-activating factor induced platelet aggregation (\n\nOkamoto et al., 1986\n\nOkamoto M.\n\nYoshida K.\n\nUchida I.\n\nNishikawa M.\n\nKohsaka M.\n\nAoki H.\n\nStudies of platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonists from microbial products. I. Bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin and its derivatives.\n\n). Interestingly, glionitrin B (the nontoxic bis-thiomethyl derivative of the ETP, glionitrin A) caused the suppression of DU145 cell invasion whereas the disulfide-containing glionitrin A and gliotoxin exhibited significant cytotoxicity, which eliminated their use in a clinical setting. This highlights the potential of these derivatives as antimetastatic agents (\n\nPark et al., 2011\n\nPark H.B.\n\nKim Y.-J.\n\nPark J.-S.\n\nYang H.O.\n\nLee K.R.\n\nKwon H.C.\n\nGlionitrin B, a cancer invasion inhibitory diketopiperazine produced by microbial coculture.\n\n). BmGT has recently been evaluated as a highly specific diagnostic marker of invasive aspergillosis (\n\nDomingo et al., 2012\n\nDomingo M.P.\n\nColmenarejo C.\n\nMartínez-Lostao L.\n\nMüllbacher A.\n\nJarne C.\n\nRevillo M.J.\n\nDelgado P.\n\nRoc L.\n\nMeis J.F.\n\nRezusta A.\n\net al.\n\nBis(methyl)gliotoxin proves to be a more stable and reliable marker for invasive aspergillosis than gliotoxin and suitable for use in diagnosis.\n\n). Thus, these recent studies indicate that ETP bis-thiomethyl derivatives have the potential to act as lead compounds in the search for new therapeutically valuable agents and effective biomarkers of fungal infection, and underpin the impact of our finding of an ETP bis-thiomethlytransferase.\n\nIn summary, we identified a bis-thiomethyltransferase, demonstrated its role in the bis-thiomethylation of GT-(SH)2 (Figure 6), and proposed that it primarily acts as a molecular switch to attenuate gli cluster expression, and consequently gliotoxin biosynthesis, in A. fumigatus."
