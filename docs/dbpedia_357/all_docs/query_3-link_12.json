        "text": "In this paper, the authors report the activation of \"cryptic clusters\" by competitive co-culture of a bacterium and a fungus producing a previously unreported antibiotic. They demonstrate that a simple process will produce novel agents with biological activity. Recently, there have been a significant number of reports of multiple cryptic clusters in prokarya and eukarya, with numbers of \"cryptic secondary metabolite clusters\" ranging from the middle 30s for S. avermitilis to 44+ for A. nidulans. Although the \"activation\" of metabolite production by alteration of fermentation conditions or by provision of \"competitors\" is an old and hallowed fermentation process (often lost in modern molecular biology of microbes), this paper demonstrated that co-culture of two organisms isolated from extreme conditions, a very acidic coal mine, produced an unknown active agent. Although the compound observed can be considered a close relative of the known fungal metabolite gliotoxin, it was not produced by either organism cultured under the same conditions but in the absence of the other microbe. The compound, although close to gliotoxin contained a nitro substituent on the fully oxidized A ring and had opposite circular dichroism spectra to its close relatives, gliotoxin and dehydrogliotoxin. Of interest was the attempt to determine the mechanism of production and I disagree with the authors' conclusion that this was not produced by \"switch on\" of \"silent genes\". Their experimental design would not demonstrate such an effect, and I would say that \"switch on/off\" at a gene locus is the probable mechanism, as shown by Keller's group in a number of papers dealing with aspergillus metabolites {1, 2}. However, aside from that comment, this is a very interesting paper with potential for significant further work on production and control of fungal metabolites."
