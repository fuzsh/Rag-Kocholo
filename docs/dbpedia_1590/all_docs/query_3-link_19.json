        "text": "Levantine dish of ground meat and bulgur\n\nThis article is about the Middle Eastern dish. For butter, see Niter kibbeh.\n\nKibbehCourseMezePlace of originSyria, Armenia, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, TurkeyRegion or stateLevant, Mesopotamia, Caucasus, East MediterraneanServing temperatureHot (or raw as Kibbeh nayyeh)Main ingredientsFinely ground meat, cracked wheat (bulgur), and Levantine spices\n\nKibbeh ( , also kubba and other spellings; Arabic: كبة, romanized: kibba) is a popular dish in the Levant based on spiced lean ground meat and bulgur wheat. Kibbeh is considered to be a national dish of Lebanon and Syria.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\nIn Levantine cuisine, kibbeh is made by pounding bulgur wheat together with meat into a fine paste and forming it into ovoid shapes, with toasted pine nuts and spices. It may also be layered and cooked on a tray, deep-fried, grilled, or served raw.[7] The Syrian city of Aleppo can lay claim to at least 17 types of Kibbeh.[8] In Mesopotamian cuisine, versions with rice or farina are found.[9]\n\nOutside of Syria,[10] versions are found in Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, the Persian Gulf, Armenia, and Turkey,[4] and among Assyrian people.[11] It is also found throughout Latin American countries that received substantial numbers of immigrants from the Levant during the late 19th and early 20th centuries,[12] as well as parts of North America.[13]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe word kibbeh first appeared in ancient biblical text, meaning “tent” or “tarp”. Later on the word took on a new meaning in Aramaic as kababa, which means \"a covering\".[14]\n\nVariations\n\n[edit]\n\nLevant\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Levantine cuisine, a variety of dishes made with bulgur (cracked wheat) and minced lamb are called kibbeh. Aleppo is famous for having more than 17 different types.[15] These include kibbeh prepared with sumac (kibbe sumāqiyye), yogurt (kibbe labaniyye), quince (kibbe safarjaliyye), lemon juice (kibbe ḥāmḍa), pomegranate sauce, cherry sauce, and other varieties, such as the \"disk\" kibbeh (kibbe arāṣ), the \"plate\" kibbeh (kibbe biṣfīḥa or kibbe bṣēniyye) and the raw kibbeh (kibbeh nayyeh).\n\nKibbeh nayyeh is a raw dish made from a mixture of bulgur, very finely minced lamb or beef similar to steak tartare, and Levantine spices, served on a platter, frequently as part of a meze in Lebanon and Syria, garnished with mint leaves and olive oil, and served with green onions or scallions, green hot peppers, and pita/pocket bread or markouk bread.[3] Because kibbeh nayyeh is raw, it requires high-quality meat to prepare and has been seen as a traditional way to honor guests.[4]\n\nA Syrian soup known as kubbi kishk consists of kubbi \"torpedoes\" or \"footballs\" in a yogurt (kishk) and butter broth with stewed cabbage leaves. Another soup, known as kibbeh hamda, consists of chicken stock with vegetables (usually leeks, celery, turnips and courgettes), lemon juice and garlic, with small kibbeh made with ground rice as dumplings.[16] In the Syrian Jewish diaspora this is popular both at Pesach and as the pre-fast meal on the day before Yom Kippur.[17]\n\nIraq\n\n[edit]\n\nKubba Mosul from Iraq is flat and round like a disc.[4] Kubba halab is an Iraqi version of kibbeh created with a rice crust and named after the largest city in Syria, Aleppo. Kubbat Shorba is an Iraqi and Kurdish version prepared as a stew, commonly made with turnips and chard in a tomato-based stew. It is often served with arak and various salads.[18]\n\nAmong Kurdish Jews, there is a kubba soup flavored with aromatic thyme leaves soup during winter time.[19]\n\nLatin America\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazil\n\n[edit]\n\nBrazilian quibe/kibe, is sometimes stuffed with catupiry or requeijão, a sauce resembling ricotta and cream cheese. Most Brazilian quibe uses only ground beef, but other variations use tahini, carne de soja (texturized soy protein), seitan (Japanese wheat gluten-based meat substitute) or tofu (soybean curd) as stuffing.[20]\n\nIn the Brazilian state of Acre, a variation of quibe called quibe de arroz (Rice kibbeh) is made with a rice flour breading. It was created by Arab immigrants to Brazil who didn't have access to wheat in the remote Amazon region of Brazil.[21]\n\nColombia\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Colombia's Caribbean coast, the most local variations of the dish use ground beef instead of lamb, but the original recipe, or one with mixture of beef and lamb, can be found served by the large Lebanese and Syrian population of the zone.[22] The dish has acquired almost vernacular presence and is frequently served in social occasions at both Arab and non-Arab households. When served as an adopted local dish, it is offered often as a starter along with other regional delicacies, including empanadas, deditos and carimañolas.[23]\n\nDominican Republic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Dominican version was brought to the Dominican Republic by Lebanese immigrants.[24]\n\nMexico\n\n[edit]\n\nSome regional Syrian cuisine and Lebanese cuisines combine kibbeh with elements taken from Latin American cuisine, for example, it is typical of Syrian Mexicans in Mexico to eat the traditional kibbeh with salsa verde.[25]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nFalafel\n\nList of Middle Eastern dishes\n\nList of deep fried foods\n\nList of stuffed dishes\n\nFood portal"
