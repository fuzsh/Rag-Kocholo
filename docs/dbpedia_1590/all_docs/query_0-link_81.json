Add a little at a time, that way you will know if it needs more.\n\nServe with crackers, chips or also good in sandwiches.\n\n(this one was made with 1 slice of whole wheat bread,cut into 4, then you layer bread, salpicao, bread, lettuce, bread, salpicão and bread)\n\nAnother thing I like to do is to bake some wonton wrappers into a small cupcake pan. It will create little wonton cups. Then fill them with this mixture and serve at parties. It is delicious.\n\nOther ingredients you may add to your salpicão:\n\ncan of corn\n\nolives\n\ndiced apples\n\nraisins\n\ndiced ham\n\ndiced cheese"
