There is a couple sitting at the table, and the waiter arrives with a smile on his face and says:\n\nWAITER\n\nCom requeijão pra ela, sem requeijão pra ele, como sempre e no capricho.\n\nGIRL\n\nObrigada.\n\nI get that these customers often go there to eat, but what does the waiter mean with \"no capricho\". Does it mean \"I'm always at your service\"? Thanks again for your help, this is an amazing community.\n\nOh wow! I see. I would have never guessed it. Thanks, Vanda!\n\nThat's so weird though, what's a whim got to do with a big portion? I guess that's for linguists and etymology experts to understand.\n\n\"Capricho\" does not mean \"whim\" in this case, but rather \"with dedication\", or as it is in the case in point, \"well made/generously served\".\n\nIn most languages (as far as I know) capriciousness means doing things on a whim, but in Portuguese (and I'm not sure if only in Brazil — someone else can confirm this for me?) it means that something is done with dedication and zeal. I don't know if it comes from considering that displaying some extreme level of dedication to something may be construed as unnecessary and therefore considered a whim, but it would make sense for a language such as Portuguese.\n\nWAITER\n\nCom requeijão pra ela, sem requeijão pra ele, como sempre e no capricho.\n\nGIRL\n\nObrigada.\n\nThey're having pizza, right? It's common to add requeijão as a topping. It is also common to have the pizza made half-and-half, like half pepperoni-half mushroom.\n\nI'd just add that \"no capricho\" does not mean automatically that the portions will be generous, but that the dish will be made with extra care. It can mean that the chef will make it himself rather than passing it along to a line cook, but it usually means bigger portions: more olives, more cheese, more of something the customer likes.\n\nThey look like two big, fried meatballs... their color is yellow. No clue what they could be.\n\nThat was an interesting explanation! Thank you for taking the time. I also reported this as a potential improvement for the wordreference 'capricho' entry.\n\nOh wow! I see. I would have never guessed it. Thanks, Vanda!\n\nThat's so weird though, what's a whim got to do with a big portion? I guess that's for linguists and etymology experts to understand.\n\nDe fato, parece ser uma expressão fixa... Olha aqui"
