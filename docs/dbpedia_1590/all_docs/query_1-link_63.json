        "text": "This post may contain affiliate links. Read our disclosure policy.\n\nOf all the foods I fell in love with while living in Brazil, Pao de Queijo (literally translated to ‘bread of cheese’) is right up there at the top of my favorites list. If you’ve never had this type of Brazilian cheese roll, it’s not the same type of bread or roll we’re used to here in the US. It’s made with tapioca flour, as opposed to all purpose flour, so it’s almost more like the texture of a cream puff shell or popover, but with more substance. The outside is slightly crisp and browned and the inside is soft and chewy. In the US, you can find them regularly served in Brazilian restaurants, and in Brazil, they’re in every corner store and bakery.\n\nBelow, I’ll show you 2 different methods of preparing the exact same recipe:\n\n1. The traditional method (shown above, R) where the wet ingredients are first heated and then beat together with the dry ingredients and scooped into little dough balls before baking. This results in: A traditional roll with a slightly crisp outside and a soft chewy center.\n\n2. The shortcut version (shown above, L) where you put all ingredients in a blender and pour the ultra thin liquid batter into a muffin tin. This results in: A flavorful roll with the same chewy texture, but not as much density. These often puff up with hollow centers, and shrink after baking. The outside is a little thinner, but still delicious.\n\nHere in this photo you can see the blender method roll on the right and the traditional method on the left. Both super delicious!\n\nIngredients and Equipment List\n\nTapioca Flour– look for tapioca flour in the specialty flour section of the grocery store, or online. I have also found it sometimes in the bulk foods area of stores like WINCO. It’s a naturally gluten free flour. If you happen to be serving these to a person who needs to avoid gluten for medical reasons, avoid purchasing from bulk bins where there can be risk of cross contamination.\n\nEgg – Egg acts as a binder and helps produce the chewy texture. I’ve never tried these with any egg substitute.\n\nMilk – You can use any milk in this recipe, though I prefer one with a higher fat content, like 2% of whole. If you don’t have those, use whatever is in your fridge, including a plant based option if you need to do that for dietary reasons.\n\nSalt – without salt, these will turn out quite bland! I use kosher salt. If subbing table salt, decrease the amount slightly.\n\nCheese – feel free to vary the cheese and discover new combinations. I prefer to use medium or sharp cheddar and parmesan, but most cheeses work well. Stronger flavored cheeses will produce a more flavorful roll.\n\nInstructions\n\nBLENDER METHOD\n\nPut all ingredients except cheese in the blender and blitz it up!\n\nAdd cheese and pulse just a couple times\n\nQuickly pour into prepared muffin tin (I say quickly, so cheese stays distributed.\n\nOptionally, you can sprinkle a little more cheese on top\n\nBake until puffed and just barely golden.\n\nThey’ll be a little crispy on the outside and soft, airy, and tender on the inside. Almost a little chewy. Some of them are even kind of hollow. This version is definitely less dense than the kneaded dough variety. The yield is anywhere from 16-24 rolls, depending on how full you fill your muffin pan. I fill mine pretty full (a good 3/4 full) and I generally get about 16-18.\n\nTRADITIONAL METHOD\n\nPay attention to the photos and my explanation here, because while I have made these a ridiculous number of times over the years, the finished dough, with the exact same ingredients and measurements (even weighed to be sure) often turns out with completely different consistencies. And it’s okay!\n\nFirst you’ll heat your milk and oil on the stove until just simmering.\n\nThen you’ll add this to your tapioca flour. You’ll notice in the photos below, I’m adding the flour directly to the pot, but often I put the flour in my mixer, and pour the hot liquid over it and that’s fine too.\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting. Sometimes this mixture comes out smooth and silky like playdough. Other times it’s crumbly like wet sand. You’ll notice the smooth version in the pan below left, and the crumbly batch (with the egg on top) on the right. The lack of consistency has driven me crazy for years, but after trying other people’s recipes and encountering the same thing, I think it’s just part of the fun haha. I know that different brands of tapioca flour have different levels of absorbency, but even with the same bag of flour, I find this still happens, so now I just go with it. Bottom line- either of these outcomes is okay!\n\n3. The next step is beating in the egg, and then the cheese. Ideally, your mixture should look like a wet cookie dough:\n\n4. You can then use a cookie scoop to drop it on a baking sheet and bake until puffed and golden.\n\nSOS!\n\nBut let’s say your batter is super runny! There’s no way it will hold its shape. Guess what? Happens to me too! Sometimes it just does that. No problem! If it’s just slightly too wet, you can simply add a bit more tapioca flour and even a bit more cheese. If it’s really loose, simply spoon your batter into a muffin tin (mini OR full size) as opposed to the baking sheet, and they will bake right up and be absolutely delicious. They’ll be a little crispy on the outside and soft, tender, and chewy on the inside.\n\nThe yield is anywhere from 16-24 rolls, depending on how full you fill your muffin pan. I fill mine pretty full (a good 3/4 full) and I generally get about 16-18.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan these be made ahead? These are best eaten fresh, but you can absolutely make the dough/batter ahead of time. With the traditional method, refrigerate dough in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Chilling also helps it set up if it’s a little runny.\n\nCan you freeze Pao de Queijo? The baked breads aren’t as good after freezing, but if you use the traditional method of preparation, you can scoop the dough onto parchment and then freeze. Place frozen dough balls in an airtight container or zip top back for up to 3 months. Bake from frozen, adding a few minutes onto baking time.\n\nBrazilian Cheese Rolls | Pao de Queijo\n\n5 from 4 votes\n\nTraditional Brazilian cheese bread. These little rolls have a unique texture as they are made with tapioca flour. They're chewy and flavorful and a perfect snack or side! This recipe includes 2 different methods to make them.\n\nTotal Time 30 minutes minutes\n\nServingsServings16\n\nCook ModePrevent your screen from going dark\n\nIngredients\n\n1/2 cup milk\n\n1/4 cup canola oil\n\n1 cup tapioca flour sometimes labeled tapioca starch no substitutions\n\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n\n1 large egg\n\n1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese preferably medium or sharp\n\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n\nOptional: extra cheese to sprinkle on top and any herbs/flavorings you'd like to add. Try rosemary and or garlic powder my favorites!\n\nInstructions\n\nQuick Blender Version:\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Spray a mini muffin tin with non-stick spray or rub with butter.\n\nPlace egg, milk, oil, tapioca flour, and salt in blender and blend until smooth. Add cheeses and pulse just a couple times.\n\nImmediately pour batter into a mini muffin tin , filling each well about 3/4 full. If desired, sprinkle a bit of parmesan cheese on top.\n\nBake for 15-20 minutes until puffed and golden. Remove from oven and cool for a few minutes before removing rolls from pan. Serve warm.\n\nTraditional Method\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or* spray a muffin tin with non stick spray or rub wells with butter (*see note).\n\nPlace milk and oil in a small pot and heat until just simmering and remove from heat.\n\nPlace tapioca flour and salt in a mixing bowl and pour hot milk and oil over top. Beat to combine.\n\nNOTE: At this point, your mixture might look crumbly and grainy, this is okay.\n\nBeat in egg.\n\nAdd cheese and beat to combine.\n\nScoop dough into balls (I use a cookie scoop, you can do any size you like, I aim for golf ball size) onto parchment-lined baking sheet* and bake until puffed and set on the outside, just slightly golden. Time will vary depending on size, but usually around 15 minutes.\n\n*NOTE: I've made this recipe a million times and have found at this point, sometimes the finished dough is scoop-able like cookie dough, and other times it's kind of runny like thick pancake batter. Tapioca flour differs in absorption levels and this isn't unusual. If your dough is not scoopable, you can always add a little bit more flour. But what I usually do is just bake the mixture in a muffin tin as opposed to a baking sheet. They still turn out great!\n\nNotes\n\n*Tip: You can play around with the cheese. I've used Monterey Jack, low-moisture mozarella, swiss, and even gruyere in place of the cheddar. All great- sharper, stronger cheeses will make for a more flavorful roll.\n\nKeep in mind, these actually don't re-heat well, so I recommend making and eating fresh.\n\nAuthor: Our Best Bites\n\nDid You Make This Recipe?Snap a picture, and hashtag it #ourbestbites.
