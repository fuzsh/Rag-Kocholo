        "text": "Brazilian Cream Cheese\n\nIngredients\n\n250ml whole milk;\n\n1 tsp Maldon salt;\n\n50g unsalted butter;\n\n100g mild English Cheddar cheese, grated (or 70g cow’s Mozzarella plus 30g Parmesan cheese, grated);\n\n100g evaporated milk;\n\n40g potato starch.\n\nMethod\n\n1. In a saucepan mix together the milk, the salt, the butter and the potato starch. Turn the heat on and stir well for about 7 minutes, until the mixture thickens and becomes a sort of a stringy bechamel sauce, carefully so it doesn’t burn or become lumpy. Turn the heat off and add the cheese, stirring well until completely melted and incorporated.\n\n2. Now, transfer the hot sauce into a liquidiser or food processor. Add the evaporated milk and whizz it up for about 5 minutes, until totally emulsified.\n\n3. Transfer your “Requeijão” into a clean container. Let it come up to room temperature before clamping the lid on and refrigerating it. It keeps well for up to 7 days in the fridge. You can also pop it into a piping bag if you’re planning to use it as pizza topping or for buns and other savoury home-made snacks fillings.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
