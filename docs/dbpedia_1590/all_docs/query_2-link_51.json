        "text": "This is our common and famous bread in Brazil. You can find it in everywhere, from north to south in our country and is very good when you enjoy it warm…\n\nIn Brazil our most important meal usually is lunch. It’s when we sit down with family or friends, or have one hour off at work to have a big meal. Usually rice, beans, steak, salad, fried eggs, pasta, lots of food…\n\nSo in our breakfast (it’s not less important but we usually eat something fast or simple), different than US, we don’t have bacon and eggs in the morning (ok sometimes we like it, but not often, people in US think this is so strange…) For breakfast we eat fruits, yogurt and our French bread with * “requeijao”, margarine, butter, cheese, ham, chicken breast or some sweets like jam, some *brazilian jam.\n\n*I will explain “requeijao” and brazilian jam later…\n\nWe also eat this bread with soups or sauces during meals, stuffed with onion and garlic and cooked in a barbecue, different option for our every day bread.\n\nFrench bread in Brasil:\n\nThe French bread in Brazil actually has less to do with the bread made in France. The bread recipe today more consumed in Brazil arose in the early 20th century, probably near a World War II, commissioned by wealthy Brazilians returning from travel to European countries.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, the most common bread in Brazil was quite different, with dark core and shell. At the time, was quite popular in Paris a short bread crumbs with white and golden skin – kind of precursor of the blade, the current predilection of the French. Travelers returning from wealthy families there describing the product to his cooks, who then tried to reproduce the recipe for the appearance.\n\nThe result was the invention of the “French bread” in Brazil, which differs from its European inspiration, especially for taking a little sugar and fat in the dough before baking. Over time, the new bread was earning nicknames different locations, as cacetinho (Rio Grande do Sul), pãozinho (São Paulo), pão massa grossa (Maranhão), pão careca (Pará), média (Baixada Santista), filão, pão jacó (Sergipe), pão aguado (Paraíba), pão de sal, ou pão carioquinha (Ceará) in different cities of Brazil.\n\nOk let’s make it…\n\ningredients\n\n½ pound of flour\n\n15 g of yeast for bread\n\n1 cup of warm water\n\n15 g salt\n\n20g sugar\n\n1 spoon (soup) is margarine\n\nPreparation\n\nDissolve the yeast in a cup of warm water with sugar.\n\nMix the other ingredients.\n\nKnead and up, pushing forward the dough with the palm of your hand and folding it over itself.\n\nIf necessary, place more water and more flour.\n\nThe dough should not stick to hands.\n\nIt should be light and spongy in appearance.\n\nLeave for two hours.\n\nNext, knead again and prepare the bread, giving it the desired shape and place on a greased board.You can make 20 small breads more or less.\n\nIf it is sticky, sprinkle more flour on top.\n\nLet it rest for another hour.\n\nPreheat the oven and brush the bread with water before putting it in the oven.\n\nBake for 40 minutes or less.\n\nEnjoy it warm…"
