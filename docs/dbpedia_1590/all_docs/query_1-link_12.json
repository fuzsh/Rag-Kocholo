        "text": "Catupiry ® (Portuguese pronunciation: [katupiˈɾi]) is one of the most popular \"requeijão\" (creamy cheese) brands in Brazil. It was developed by the Italian immigrant Mario Silvestrini in the state of Minas Gerais in 1911. The name derives from the native Tupi-Guarani word meaning \"excellent\".\n\nCatupiry is a soft, mild-tasting cheese that can be spread over toasts and crackers or used in cooking. Because of its low level of acidity, Catupiry has become an ingredient in various dishes.\n\nThe expression \"com Catupiry\" (with Catupiry) refers to foods where Catupiry is an ingredient, or a filling, such as pizza, coxinhas or Pão de queijo. It is also eaten as a dessert combined with guava jam.\n\nIn the United States, Catupiry can be found in Brazilian ethnic stores and restaurants in the States of Florida, Georgia, California, New York and Massachusetts."
