        "text": "Catupiry is the most popular “requeijão” (cream cheese) in Brazil. It was developed by the Italian immigrant Mario Silvestrini in the state of Minas Gerais in 1911. The name derives from the native Tupi-Guarani word meaning “excellent”. The recipe, created by Mario, still remains a secret kept under lock and key.\n\nCatupiry is a soft, mild-tasting cheese that can be spread over toasts and crackers or used in cooking. Because of its low level of acidity, Catupiry has become an essential ingredient in innumerable dishes. A large number of pasta, fish and chicken recipes using Catupiry, have been created throughout Brazil. The expression “ao Catupiry” (with Catupiry) is widely used and refers to foods where Catupiry is an important ingredient, like in pizza toppings or snacks such as coxinhas fillings, pastries and cheese buns. In the State of Rio de Janeiro, Catupiry is often eaten as a dessert combined with guava jam.\n\nWithin the US, Catupiry can be found in Brazilian ethnic stores and restaurants in the States of Florida, California, New York and Massachusetts, though it can be difficult to find.\n\nHere’s the offical site (in Portuguese) for Laticínios Catupiry."
