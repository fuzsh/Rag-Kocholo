        "text": "CATA\n\nA CATA questionnaire was completed by 121 consumers (77 women and 44 men, aged 18 to 57 yr) who were randomly recruited at the Veterinary School of Federal Fluminense University. Prior to testing, each participant signed a consent form. Consumers who were allergic to milk or lactose intolerant and consumers who consumed dairy products <1 time/week were excluded. Mineral water and unsalted crackers were used to cleanse the palate.\n\nThe selection of attributes for the CATA questionnaire was based on the list from the DA, removing terms that showed low mean values or no significant difference. A similar approach has been used in recent studies evaluating dairy foods such as yogurts (\n\nCruz et al., 2013\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nCadena R.S.\n\nAlvaro M.B.V.B.\n\nSant'Ana A.S.\n\nOliveira C.A.F.\n\nFaria J.A.F.\n\nBolini H.M.A.\n\nFerreira M.M.C.\n\nAssessing the use of different chemometric techniques to discriminate low-fat and full-fat yogurts.\n\n;\n\nTarrega et al., 2016\n\nTarrega A.\n\nMarcano J.\n\nFiszman S.\n\nYogurt viscosity and fruit pieces affect satiating capacity expectations.\n\n), dairy desserts (\n\nBruzzone et al., 2015\n\nBruzzone F.\n\nVidal L.\n\nAntunez L.\n\nGimenez A.\n\nDeliza R.\n\nAres G.\n\nComparison of intensity scales and CATA questions in new product development: Sensory characterization and directions for product reformulation of milk desserts.\n\n), and ice creams (\n\nDooley et al., 2010\n\nDooley L.\n\nLee Y.\n\nMeullenet J.\n\nThe application of check-all-that-apply (CATA) consumer profiling to preference mapping of vanilla ice cream and its comparison to classical external preference mapping.\n\n). Based on these criteria, buttery aroma, sweet aroma, and acid aroma were removed. Color and homogeneity attributes were adapted from the scale used in the DA. In the DA, color ranged from white to yellow, so we evaluated “yellowness” and “whiteness” in the CATA. In the DA, the score for homogeneity varied from low to high, so for the CATA, we revised these extremes to be “homogeneous” and “heterogeneous.” Furthermore, other attributes were revised to be more easily understood by consumers: fatty (oil film), ease of melting in the mouth (oral consistency), viscosity (form wire), and creaminess (consistency).\n\nConsumers were asked to select how many terms they considered appropriate to describe the samples. The position of the terms in the questionnaire was adapted according to recommended procedures from\n\nAres and Jaeger, 2013\n\nAres G.\n\nJaeger S.R.\n\nCheck-all-that-apply questions: Influence of attribute order on sensory product characterization.\n\n, who found that consumers had an easier time with a CATA questionnaire when terms were grouped (i.e., odor, taste, appearance). Therefore, descriptors were assembled into 3 major groups: appearance (brightness, yellowness, whiteness, homogeneity, gelatinous quality, heterogeneity, viscosity, creaminess, and spreadability), natural and artificial requeijão cremoso aroma, and oral perception (sweet taste, salty taste, acid taste, bitter taste, natural and artificial requeijão cremoso flavor, buttery flavor, oil film, and ease of melting in the mouth). Then, groups were arranged on the page so that each group occupied all positions the same number of times. Words within attribute groups always appeared in a fixed order. Thus, we obtained 6 different page models.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nWe analyzed findings from the DA using 2-way ANOVA (samples and assessors and their interaction as sources of variation), followed by Tukey's test for comparison between means (P < 0.05) to check for significant differences between samples for each attribute (\n\nGaze et al., 2015\n\nGaze L.V.\n\nOliveira B.R.\n\nFerrao L.L.\n\nGranato D.\n\nCavalcanti R.N.\n\nConte Junior C.A.\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nFreitas M.Q.\n\nPreference mapping of Dulce de leche commercialized in Brazilian markets.\n\n). We also applied principal component analysis to the mean values for sensory attribute intensity using correlation data (\n\nCruz et al., 2013\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nCadena R.S.\n\nAlvaro M.B.V.B.\n\nSant'Ana A.S.\n\nOliveira C.A.F.\n\nFaria J.A.F.\n\nBolini H.M.A.\n\nFerreira M.M.C.\n\nAssessing the use of different chemometric techniques to discriminate low-fat and full-fat yogurts.\n\n). For the CATA findings, we applied Cochran's Q test to each sensory descriptor to evaluate possible differences between treatments (samples) with binary responses. We calculated correspondence analysis using chi-squared distances on the frequency of each sample and attribute, obtaining a contingency table with orthogonal components and maximizing the sequential representation of variation of data (\n\nVidal et al., 2015\n\nVidal L.\n\nTárrega A.\n\nAntúnez L.\n\nAres G.\n\nJaeger S.R.\n\nComparison of correspondence analysis based on Hellinger and chi-squared distances to obtain sensory spaces from check-all-that-apply (CATA) questions.\n\n).\n\nWe tested multidimensional alignment (MDA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on phi coefficient values (\n\nMeyners et al., 2013\n\nMeyners M.\n\nCastura J.C.\n\nCarr T.\n\nExisting and new approaches for the analysis of CATA data.\n\n), new approaches recently suggested for evaluating CATA findings. We used MDA to evaluate the association of the sensory descriptors with each sample. By calculating the cosine of the angle formed between each attribute and sample (range −1 to 1), it is possible to determine which attributes have a strong relationship with each sample and obtain complete information about the relationship between products and attributes. Absolute cosines below 0.707 [= cos (45°) = −cos (135°)] indicate very little relationship (\n\nCarr et al., 2009\n\nCarr B.T.\n\nDzuroska J.\n\nTaylor R.O.\n\nLanza K.\n\nPansini C.\n\n). We used the phi coefficient to check the correlation between attributes. When applied to all assessors, it allows us to determine which attributes typically appear together and which are used independently. The phi coefficients between pairs of attributes enabled us to construct a matrix of similarities that we submitted to metric MDS. The degree of correspondence among the distances between points implied by the MDS map and the matrix input by the user is measured (inversely) by a stress function. When the MDS map perfectly reproduces the input data, the stress is zero. Thus, the smaller the stress, the better the representation (\n\nGranato and Ares, 2014\n\nGranato D.\n\nAres G.\n\n).\n\nFinally, we used multiple factor analysis to compare both sensory configurations (samples and sensory descriptors) described by each methodology, assessing the sensory positioning of products in a single map. A 6-row matrix, in which each row corresponded to each sample data, was constructed with 2 blocks of columns, corresponding to the positions of the samples at the 2 first dimensions of each methodology. The similarity/correlation RV coefficient was used as a quantitative measure of this correspondence (\n\nCruz et al., 2013\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nCadena R.S.\n\nAlvaro M.B.V.B.\n\nSant'Ana A.S.\n\nOliveira C.A.F.\n\nFaria J.A.F.\n\nBolini H.M.A.\n\nFerreira M.M.C.\n\nAssessing the use of different chemometric techniques to discriminate low-fat and full-fat yogurts.\n\n;\n\nSantos et al., 2013\n\nSantos B.A.\n\nPollonio M.A.R.\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nMessias V.C.\n\nMonteiro R.A.\n\nOliveira T.L.C.\n\nFaria J.A.F.\n\nFreitas M.Q.\n\nBolini H.M.A.\n\nUltra-flash profile and projective mapping for describing sensory attributes of prebiotic mortadelas.\n\n;\n\nPontual et al., 2017\n\nPontual I.\n\nAmaral G.V.\n\nEsmerino E.A.\n\nPimentel T.C.\n\nFreitas M.Q.\n\nFukuda R.K.\n\nSant'Ana I.L.\n\nSilva L.G.\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nAssessing consumer expectations about pizza: A study on celiac and non-celiac individuals using the word association technique.\n\n).\n\nDescriptive Analysis\n\nThe DA resulted in 23 sensory descriptors, more than the number obtained in a previous study (\n\nGarruti et al., 2003\n\nGarruti D.S.\n\nBrito E.S.\n\nBrandão T.M.\n\nUchôa Jr., P.\n\nSilva M.A.P.P.\n\nDesenvolvimento do perfil sensorial e aceitação de requeijão cremoso.\n\n), and demonstrating the sensory complexity of the samples. Table 2 shows the results of the DA test. We observed significant differences for most attributes, indicating a wide variety of sensory characteristics for this group of products and providing evidence for the different procedures and formulations used by dairy companies to make requeijão cremoso. Sample I (traditional requeijão cremoso) was characterized by increased brightness and wire formation, more intense white color, and high homogeneity. Samples II and III exhibited similar profiles, with intermediate brightness, greater tendency to yellow, and a flavor similar to that of traditional requeijão cremoso. Sample III also had the highest sweetness and lower saltiness intensities. Sample IV had high saltiness intensity, lower brightness, and a strong buttery flavor. Sample V was different from the other samples with respect to the following attributes: gelatinous quality, homogeneity, spreadability and wire formation, artificial requeijão cremoso aroma and artificial requeijão cremoso flavor, sweet aroma, and consistency in the mouth. Finally, sample VI showed a tendency to white and increased consistency, adhesiveness, homogeneity, and oral adhesiveness. We observed no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the samples for the following attributes: buttery aroma, acid taste, and oil film.\n\nTable 2Attribute mean values for each sample of

considering the 2 first dimensions (Figure 1). The first dimension was responsible for approximately 50% of the variation, characterized by natural requeijão cremoso aroma, homogeneity, and natural requeijão cremoso flavor. The second dimension was responsible for approximately 26% of the variation, characterized by adhesiveness, buttery flavor, buttery aroma, and bitter taste. Samples I, II, and III were characterized by natural requeijão cremoso aroma and flavor, sweet taste, sweet aroma, forming wire, brightness, homogeneity, and spreadability. Samples IV and VI were characterized by adhesiveness, buttery flavor, buttery aroma, and bitter taste. Sample V was characterized by artificial requeijão cremoso aroma and flavor, oil film, color, and gelatinous quality.\n\nWe found no studies describing a DA of requeijão cremoso containing starch and vegetable in the literature, so we used traditional requeijão cremoso for comparison. The attributes used to describe the samples were similar to those reported by\n\nGarruti et al., 2003\n\nGarruti D.S.\n\nBrito E.S.\n\nBrandão T.M.\n\nUchôa Jr., P.\n\nSilva M.A.P.P.\n\nDesenvolvimento do perfil sensorial e aceitação de requeijão cremoso.\n\n, who studied 4 commercial samples of requeijão cremoso. When comparing those results with the ones obtained in the present study, we noted that forming wire, salty taste, consistency, adhesiveness, and yellow color were important characteristics of this type of processed cheese.\n\nCATA\n\nCochran's Q test (Table 3) showed differences in all attributes among the samples, except for acid taste and viscosity, emphasizing the efficacy of consumer CATA questions in identifying sensory differences. The terms used in the CATA questionnaire were easy to understand, and some differences from the trained panel were due to intrinsic differences in the methods.\n\nTable 3Frequency mention of sensory attributes associated with each sample of requeijão cremoso by consumers (n = 121) on check-all-that-apply questions\n\nAttributeSample\n\n1\n\nI = traditional requeijão cremoso; II, III, and IV = requeijão cremoso with added starch; V, VI = requeijão cremoso with added starch and vegetable fat.\n\nP-value\n\n2\n\nP-value greater than α = 0.05 indicates no significant difference.\n\nIIIIIIIVVVISweet taste931429104<0.001Salty taste626335695660<0.001Acid taste1818191325120.125Bitter taste13138122390.017Natural requeijão cremoso flavor56233038658<0.001Artificial requeijão cremoso flavor284332336915<0.001Buttery flavor2236373323240.028Fatty2845363655340.001Easy melting on mouth545253642149<0.001Natural requeijão cremoso aroma46272933852<0.001Artificial requeijão cremoso aroma172719135611<0.001Brightness724144461960<0.001Yellow color109666411915<0.001White color81929537572<0.001Homogeneity907378723986<0.001Heterogeneity2636386<0.001Gelatinous quality35156010<0.001Viscosity3427242823250.508Creaminess616266641778<0.001Spreadability372844361123<0.001\n\nA correspondence analysis bidimensional map is shown in Figure 2. For correspondence analysis, we divided the samples into 3 groups: samples I, IV, and VI in the upper left quadrant; samples II and III in the lower left quadrant; and sample V in the upper right quadrant. Considering the frequency for each attribute, shown in Table 3, we were able to obtain a description of samples. Samples I and VI were in almost the same position and had the following properties: brightness, natural requeijão cremoso flavor, and natural requeijão cremoso aroma. These were also the attributes most likely to describe the samples. In the same quadrant, sample IV was homogeneous and creamy, and according to the attributes selected, it was also salty and melted easily in the mouth. Samples II and III had a yellow color, sweet taste, and buttery flavor. Finally, sample V was gelatinous, heterogeneous, and had an artificial requeijão cremoso aroma and flavor. Whiteness of requeijão cremoso was also frequently selected by consumers.\n\nAfter developing the correspondence analysis map, we applied MDA to the coordinates of each sample and sensory descriptors. Table 4 shows the relationship between attributes and samples using MDA (cosine values >0.707 suggesting a strong relationship between samples and the attributes). Positive values indicate that the product is strongly characterized by the attribute, and negative values indicate that the product is not characterized by the attribute. Sample I was correlated with viscosity, homogeneity, brightness, and natural requeijão cremoso aroma/flavor (cosines 1.00, 0.74, 0.92, 0.93, and 0.96, respectively); it was not correlated with sweet taste, acid taste, artificial requeijão cremoso flavor, or fatty (−0.71, −0.78, −0.79, and −0.82, respectively). In contrast, samples II and III were characterized as yellow and had a buttery flavor and a sweet taste. The terms spreadability, creaminess, viscosity, homogeneity, brightness, natural requeijão cremoso aroma, easily melted in the mouth and natural requeijão cremoso flavor were the main attributes of sample IV. Sample V was correlated with gelatinous quality, fatty, heterogeneity, artificial requeijão cremoso aroma/flavor, bitter taste, and an acid taste. Sample VI was correlated with viscosity, homogeneity, brightness, and natural requeijão cremoso aroma/flavor. These findings could be interesting for dairy processors, because they can evaluate the attributes that were strongly related to the traditional sample, which did not contain starch and vegetable fat, and use it as a guideline for developing similar products. For example, sample VI, which does contains starch and vegetable fat, had a strong correlation with the same attributes (homogeneity, brightness, and natural requeijão aroma/flavor) as sample I.\n\nTable 4Cosine values between vector pairs (product vector vs. main sensory terms) in the characterization of samples obtained by multidimensional alignment for requeijão cremoso samples\n\nAttributeSample\n\n1\n\nI = traditional requeijão cremoso; II, III, and IV = requeijão cremoso with added starch; V, VI = requeijão cremoso with added starch and vegetable fat.\n\n,\n\n2\n\nBold values indicate correlation of the sensory attributes with the respective sample.

For instance, sample V did not present a clear association with bitter taste, salty taste, and sour taste when assessed by correspondence analysis bidimensional map. Use of MDA to analyze CATA findings is advantageous and confirms recent observations from a study evaluating low-sodium dry fermented sausages (\n\nSantos et al., 2015\n\nSantos B.A.\n\nCampagnol P.C.B.\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nGalvão M.T.E.L.\n\nMonteiro R.A.\n\nWagner R.\n\nPollonio M.A.R.\n\nCheck all that apply and free listing to describe the sensory characteristics of low sodium dry fermented sausages: Comparison with trained panel.\n\n).\n\nWe performed MDS using phi coefficients between attributes (Figure 3). Multidimensional scaling provides a map in which terms are distributed in 2 dimensions. The proximity of terms in the bidimensional map indicates their similarity with respect to sensory properties. The results showed a stress value of 0.162 and high validity; according to\n\nGranato and Ares, 2014\n\nGranato D.\n\nAres G.\n\n, values below 0.1 are considered fair and those up to 0.20 are acceptable. As shown in Figure 3, it is possible to observe a correlation between natural requeijão cremoso flavor/aroma, spreadability, homogeneity, creaminess, easily melted in the mouth and brightness, which were coherent and desirable in a typical processed cheese. We also observed a good correlation for artificial requeijão cremoso flavor/aroma, fatty, viscosity, heterogeneity, gelatinous quality, and bitter taste. These characteristics are not desirable in traditional requeijão cremoso and may have been associated with the vegetable fat and other additives (i.e., flavorings, thickeners) used to mimic the characteristics of the traditional product (\n\nVan Dender, 2014\n\nVan Dender A.G.F.\n\n). In addition, we observed an association between yellow color, buttery flavor, sweet taste, and acid taste in the upper left quadrant. The sweet and acid tastes may have been seen as similar by consumers because of a cross-modal interaction. Cross-modal taste and aroma interactions have been reported in the perception of cheese flavor (\n\nNiimi et al., 2016\n\nNiimi J.\n\nOverington A.R.\n\nSilcock P.\n\nBremer P.J.\n\nDelahunty C.M.\n\nCross-modal taste and aroma interactions: Cheese flavor perception and changes in flavor character in multicomponent mixtures.\n\n), and they should be taken in account in developing processed cheese.\n\nThese findings may be useful as a guideline for the processed cheese industry. Although one of the principal attributes of this processed cheese is natural requeijão cremoso natural flavor and aroma, it may also present with brightness, spreadability, homogeneity, creaminess, and easy melt in the mouth. Similar products should be formulated to achieve these characteristics. For example, the starch level will affect the texture of the sample, because starch interacts with the water in the cheese, forming a gel and making it firmer (\n\nMounsey and O'Riordan, 2001\n\nMounsey J.S.\n\nO'Riordan E.D.\n\nCharacteristics of imitation cheese containing native starches.\n\n;\n\nFerrão et al., 2016\n\nFerrão L.L.\n\nSilva E.B.\n\nSilva H.L.A.\n\nSilva R.\n\nMollakhalili N.\n\nGranato D.\n\nFreitas M.Q.\n\nSilva M.C.\n\nRaices R.S.L.\n\nPadilha M.C.\n\nZacarchenco P.B.\n\nBarbosa M.I.M.J.\n\nMortazavian A.M.\n\nCruz A.G.\n\nStrategies to develop healthier processed cheeses: Reduction of sodium and fat contents and use of prebiotics.\n\n). Vegetable fat levels will result in insufficient emulsification, illustrated by a highly hydrophobic character and more primary bonds, with a direct effect on fat globule structure (increased diameter). This in turn causes a decrease in protein-protein and protein-fat interactions in the processed cheese matrix, lowering the elasticity of the product and affecting its spreadability and ease of melting in the mouth (\n\nCunha et al., 2010\n\nCunha C.R.\n\nDias A.I.\n\nViotto W.H.\n\nMicrostructure, texture, colour and sensory evaluation of a spreadable processed cheese analogue made with vegetable fat.\n\n)."
