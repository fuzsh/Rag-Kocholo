        "text": "Brazilian cheeses are not as internationally famous as Brazilian caipirinhas but we do have some remarkable ones that emerged from Italy, Germany, Portuguese and another European cultures that are very tasty and unique! Almost every cheese in Brazil is produced from cow milk but there are a few types that are produced from buffalo milk and goat milk.\n\nThe cheese culture is very strong over here and somehow Brazilians found a way to incorporate it in every occasion: for breakfast, they usually have toast with mozzarella or white cheese; at lunchtime snack they eat processed cheese; at the beach you can have grilled cheese and even some desserts includes cheese, which is the case of the traditional “Romeo and Juliet” that consists in sweet guava pasta with soft white cheese.\n\nRequeijão or Catupiry is a rich, smooth, white cheese with creamy consistence that is inspired by a Portuguese cheese with the same name but with a different texture and flavor. It is often used as a filling for salty treats, specially pizza. The flavor will remind you of Brie or Camembert but it isn’t as salty as those two.\n\nQueijo Minas is originated in the state of Minas Gerais and that is why it has its name. It is a tasty mild, white cheese produced by coagulating milk with enzymes. Its texture is very similar to the traditional Italian Mozzarella and it can be spread easily. This cheese holds an important cultural weight in Brazil and in 2008 it was declared a part of “Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage.”\n\nThere is a very strict legislation regarding every step of its production and the cheese-makers affirms that if t the corrals where the cows are being milked must be tranquil places with not too many workers otherwise it won’t come out right.\n\nQueijo Coalho literally means “curd cheese” and it is yellowish, semi-hard with rubbery texture cheese. It is more traditional in the North and Northeast and it is supposed to be roasted: instead of melting, the exterior part of it will create a warm lawyer that wraps the middle. It is common to see people selling this treat on the beach!"
