        "text": "The most literal translation of the word Farroupilha, according to Google Translate and every other source I’ve consulted, is “Ragamuffin.” The word is based on the Portuguese farropa, or “rag,” with the diminutive suffix ilha, the feminine form of ilho. In Brazil, the word Farroupilha can refer to a city of roughly 70,000 people in Brazil’s southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul or a neighborhood in Porto Alegre, that state’s capital and largest city. For most, though, it refers to a group of Brazilian gauchos (think white land-owning rancher/cowboys) during Brazil’s imperial period, and the republican revolution they started, a revolution that is still celebrated with a weeklong annual Farroupilha festival in Porto Alegre.\n\nSince the word Farroupilha can refer to so many different things in Brazil, and since very little if any English-language information on the sandwich appears online, and since my Portuguese is nonexistent, researching this sandwich presents some difficulties. Google search results are almost universally about the town or the neighborhood, the cowboys, their festival, or the war it celebrates–a war that ended with the Farroupilha gauchos returning to the fold of the Brazilian empire and executing the black soldiers who fought for secession at their sides.\n\nLet us then start with the definition of the sandwich that is given to us by the anonymous benefactor who added this sandwich to Wikipedia’s List of Sandwiches. “Mortadella slices and cheese, into a French bread with butter inside, usually served split in two halves and paired with coffee or soda.”\n\nSearches for Brazilian mortadella sandwiches turn up much more relevant results. The Wikipedia page on mortadella sandwiches, in fact, states that mortadella sandwiches are very popular in São Paulo, as does the page on mortadella. Google Image Search results abound, almost universally showing a great pile of mortadella, with a melted white cheese oozing out from inbetween its slices, cut in half as per the sandwich definition.\n\nThe most-often referenced sandwich is served by a stand in São Paulo’s large municipal market called Bar do Mané, where Anthony Bourdain once tried one of these massive piles of meat and cheese in an episode of The Layover and declared it a “Matterhorn of meaty goodness” and “<expletive deleted> delicious.”\n\nAnd yes, I started out this month thinking this sandwich would be a quick win. I made a batch of pão francês, the Brazilian “French rolls” that these sandwiches generally employ.\n\nI bought some mortadella, and some provolone, which is generally the cheese referenced when talking about this sandwich. I even bought some ham, since I’d found worrying reports that the Farroupilha contained ham instead of mortadella and I wanted to cover my bases. I made a gooey, slightly-less-overloaded-than-Bar-do-Mané’s-version fried mortadella and cheese sandwich and it was delicious.\n\nI made it again, only this time I added Dijon mustard per another description I’d found.\n\nI made it again, but used ham this time, to cover my bases. I even made a version with turkey (not pictured, and mostly as an accident. It was surprisingly great though).\n\nThe problem with all this, of course, is that São Paulo’s mortadella sandwich isn’t really the same thing as the Farroupilha. Is it a good sandwich? Yes, it’s delicious. Am I glad I tried it? Of course! When I wrote about mortadella sandwiches a few years ago, I completely disregarded this Brazilian behemoth, and it deserves a spot in our pantheon. But not once in any of the videos or articles I found is this sandwich called a Farroupilha. Farroupilha sandwich mentions on restaurant menus from what I can tell seem to cluster around Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, a thousand miles south of São Paulo. Even if the two sandwiches are exactly identical, I am not covering the Farroupilha when I write about São Paulo’s sandwich.\n\nSo I turned again to the internet and did a deeper dive in trying to find the sandwich. This time, I searched social media sites like Twitter and Instagram to try and get a better idea. Unfortunately, people on Twitter, Instagram and the like often write as if their audiences share the same assumptions they do. In a tweet, one barely has enough space to make a point, much less define each term one is using, and other social media statuses are often similarly pithy. Individual posts do not shed much light on the situation.\n\nWe take a nice crusty pão francês roll, still warm from the oven, cut it almost all the way open, leaving a hinge on one side, and spread butter on the interior. If the rolls have cooled off, we can put one back into a 350° F oven for 5 minutes to warm it back up and revive that nice crisp exterior.\n\nInto the roll, we place two slices of mortadella and a slice of provolone cheese, folded in half.\n\nThen we cut the sandwich in half before serving it. This is a Farroupilha, as far as I can tell. It’s as simple as one of these sandwiches can get, and as long as you like the flavors of mortadella and provolone, it’s a good sandwich. Provolone in the Americas is a mild cheese, well suited for sandwiches, and here it allows the aromatic qualities of the mortadella to lead–nutmeg, coriander, black pepper, warming spices. The butter, melting into the warmed bread roll, keeps the sandwich from being too dry, though mortadella itself needs little assistance in that area.\n\nIf we take that same roll, spread it with requeijão instead, add two slices of mortadella, one slice of provolone, tomato and leaf lettuce–this too is a Farroupilha.\n\nRequeijão is not a common item in the US. There are more than a few recipes you can find online for making a similar product. However, a throw-away comment in this recipe post–“from now on you won’t have to go to a Brazilian or Middle-Eastern market in order to buy this amazing Brazilian cream cheese spread”–helped me recall that I’d seen similar products with Arabic labels at some of the markets I frequent.\n\nHow similar are they? I can’t say, never having tried the Brazilian version. Like the descriptions I’ve read of the Brazilian product, it is a cream cheese spread that bears little resemblance to what we in the US would call cream cheese. Regardless, this makes a good sandwich condiment, with a spreadable texture similar to a softened butter and a slightly sour, milky flavor that doesn’t work quite as well with the tomato and lettuce as I’d hoped–mayonnaise would be even better, but this is tasty enough.\n\nIf we take a cacetinho roll, put mortadella and cheese inside it, butter the outside ever so slightly, then toast it in a panini press? This, it appears, would also be a Farroupilha.\n\nLike many bread rolls–as opposed to sliced bread–the pão francês doesn’t work particularly well in the panini press to my mind. The top part has a tendency to wander away from the bottom part, and the crustier the roll, the worse that tendency gets. Otherwise, mortadella and provolone make for an ideal melt, as I’ve observed previously.\n\nWhen it comes to this sandwich, though, simplicity is best, and I find myself returning to the version as described in the Wikipedia List of Sandwiches (though replacing the butter with requeijão)–“served split in two halves and paired with coffee.”\n\nIt’s the best one I’ve tried, even if the two halves don’t want to sit nicely for their closeup. Requeijão may not work as nicely as mayonnaise when dressing a sandwich with lettuce and tomato in it, but it’s at least as good as butter when providing a lubricating factor in a meat-and-cheese-only affair.\n\nSo this is the Farroupilha–I hope. Maybe there is a Brazilian reader out there who can help set me straight if I’ve gotten it wrong. It wouldn’t be the first time."
