It falls into the 'requeij&atilde;o' category, a generic term for loose, ricotta-like creamy cheese used to make cheese spread. The name is derived from the native Tupi word meaning 'excellent'.Catupiry is a famous cheese in Brazil because of its soft, mild taste and low level of acidity. It is made from milk cream, curd mass (fluid milk for skimmed industrial use, sodium chloride), salt and cheese cultures. The whitish cheese is creamy with a liquid consistency. It is easily spread over toast, crackers and bread buns, pizza, and sandwiches.\r\nIt is available in two types: Catupiry&reg; Original and Catupiry&reg; Light (with less fat and calories).",
