        "text": "Kay Sha Das. Do you know what that is? I certainly didn’t! But I knew that I liked the look of them when I passed a bountiful display in a deli window recently.\n\nI was hurrying past, on another mission, but abruptly stopped in my tracks: here was a cake that I couldn’t recognise! How could that be so?!\n\nThe sign itself actually said “Queijadas” and I went in and asked the owner how to pronounce it and more importantly what they were. Kay. Sha. Das, he enunciated slowly. A Portuguese custard tart. But I thought that was a pastel de nata ?…and then I found out that the Portuguese have not just one custard tart but a multitude of regional others!\n\nWhen the Portuguese started to export their wine, they used egg white to filter it. But what happened to the egg yolks that were left? It is believed that the medieval nuns used vast quantities of egg yolks to iron their habits as well as develop endless dessert recipes with the surplus.\n\nToday, the Portuguese still enjoy rich, egg-based desserts that are often seasoned with spices and most popular is egg custard, rice pudding, custard tarts, and of course queijadas.\n\nMy research revealed that queijadas vary greatly by region. Some have a thin pastry some don’t. Some are made with cream cheese or ricotta, some just eggs & milk. Lots had copious amounts of sugar! I found recipes that were based on sweetened condensed milk, or almonds or even cheddar! Some were cake-like whilst others just custardy.\n\nThe common theme was plenty of eggs (whole or yolks), cinnamon, vanilla and sometimes lemon.\n\nI wanted to replicate the ones that I had seen in the window: A pastry-less custardy cake with a tender crust. I have a pretty good egg tart recipe and wanted something a bit different.\n\nI wanted to replicate it and it be dairy-free, gluten-free, possibly nut-free and low sugar! I ended up with something approximating a French clafoutis in a cupcake! Despite me never having any luck with clafoutis, I think these worked out pretty well.\n\nI never did buy one of those enticing “kay sha das” in the window and I haven’t been to Portugal, so I don’t know whether mine come close or not. But having satisfied my curiosity and realising that there are a hundred million versions of the cake, I’m not too fussed! I liked what I made.\n\nDo you know them? Have you had one? What was it like? I’d love for you to tell me in the comments.\n\nrind of 2 lemons\n\n120g coconut sugar (I used Natvia)\n\n40g butter\n\n400g milk (I used almond milk or coconut milk)\n\n4 eggs\n\n80g gluten-free SR flour\n\n2 tabs of desiccated coconut or ground almonds\n\npinch salt\n\na few drops lemon oil to flavour (optional)\n\nMill the rind with the sugar for 10 seconds on SP 9. Add the remaining ingredients and mix on SP 6 for 10 seconds.\n\nGrease a muffin pan well and sprinkle the bases with the coconut or almond meal. Pour in the batter to the top of the pans and bake for 40 – 50 minutes. They will puff up and still be wobbly in the middle. Let cool before turning out. They will sink a bit in the middle so you could fill with lemon curd or jam. I used some orange jelly that I made."
