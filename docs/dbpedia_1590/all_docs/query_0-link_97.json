        "text": "Potassium sorbate (E202) is a synthetic food preservative commonly used to extend the shelf life of various food products.\n\nIt works by inhibiting the growth of molds, yeast, and some bacteria, preventing spoilage. When added to foods, it helps maintain their freshness and quality.\n\nSome studies have shown that when combined with nitrites, potassium sorbate have genotoxic activity in vitro. However, potassium sorbate is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities.\n\nDiphosphates (E450) are food additives often utilized to modify the texture of products, acting as leavening agents in baking and preventing the coagulation of canned food.\n\nThese salts can stabilize whipped cream and are also found in powdered products to maintain their flow properties. They are commonly present in baked goods, processed meats, and soft drinks.\n\nDerived from phosphoric acid, they're part of our daily phosphate intake, which often surpasses recommended levels due to the prevalence of phosphates in processed foods and drinks.\n\nExcessive phosphate consumption is linked to health issues, such as impaired kidney function and weakened bone health. Though diphosphates are generally regarded as safe when consumed within established acceptable daily intakes, it's imperative to monitor overall phosphate consumption to maintain optimal health.\n\nWe need your help!\n\nYou can help us recognize more ingredients and better analyze the list of ingredients for this product and others:\n\nEdit this product page to correct spelling mistakes in the ingredients list, and/or to remove ingredients in other languages and sentences that are not related to the ingredients.\n\nAdd new entries, synonyms or translations to our multilingual lists of ingredients, ingredient processing methods, and labels.\n\nIf you would like to help, join the #ingredients channel on our Slack discussion space and/or learn about ingredients analysis on our wiki. Thank you!"
