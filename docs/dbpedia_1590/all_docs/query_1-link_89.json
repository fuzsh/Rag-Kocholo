        "text": "I encountered many food combinations while living in Brazil that quickly became favorites, but none of them compare to guava and cheese. This sweet and salty combo is better known as Romeu e Julieta.\n\nAfter my first week there I quickly learned that Romeu e Julieta was a name for a flavor that came in many different forms. I was first introduced to it by way of eating slices of the white cheese, queijo fresco, topped with slices of goiabada which was like a solid, sliceable jelly of goiaba (guava) jam.\n\nLater when I traveled to the state of Minas Gerais I learned that it is delicious with Canastra, a cheese specific to an area of that state. The goiabada there is a more spreadable form like a cross between a pudding and a jam.\n\nWhere we lived in Maringá I found Romeu e Julieta in the first form I mentioned as well as combination of the guava jam and mozzarella cheese. Some restaurants also served the guava jam with requeijao which is often described as a white cream cheese. Really it is more like a white from cheese whiz minus the spray can, but without any strong flavor or tang.\n\nA form of Romeu e Julieta could be found on every menu in town and most often it was not just cheese and jam. There was Romeu e Julieta pizza, pudding desserts, ice cream and pastel. Ahhh, pastel.\n\nAsk any ex-pat in Brazil about pastel and you’ll get the response, “Mmmm…pastel.” It will be accompanied by a look of contentment and a bit of day dreaming.\n\nPastel is by far the best type of street food I’ve come across in my travels. Around our city there were booths at the local farmer’s market which sold them like fair food, but then there were also free standing restaurants such as Roberto’s which was exactly one half block away from our apartment.\n\nBelieve me; restraint had to be practiced daily.\n\nPastel is two layers of a puff pastry–like crust that is filled with all kinds of goodies. Then it is deep fried until puffed, toasty brown and flaky. You have to bite off a corner to let the steam escape and wait patiently before you dig in.\n\nThere were over 20 options at the restaurant by our apartment – beef, olives, cheese, mushrooms, chicken, heart of palm, broccoli, arugula, sundried tomatoes or a combination of two or three fillings together. Then there was the dessert menu pastel with coconut and chocolate, apple and nuts, and of course, Romeu e Julieta.\n\nMy husband’s coworker just came in from Brazil and prior to her visit she did some shopping for me. One thing on the list was goiaba jam. I’m sure guava jam is available in places like California in the US, but so far I haven’t seen it around Kentucky so I got it special order, shipped via suitcase.\n\nWhen I heard that FOODalogue’s stop of the South American tour was Brazil this week, I knew I wanted to participate. I pulled out my cookbook, 1000 Receitas da Culinária Brasileira, and found a recipe for pastel.\n\nI knew I didn’t want to fry it. I eat fried foods on occasion, but I’m not big on making them at home. I decided I’d bake it instead. It turned out to be like a lovely little Romeu e Julieta pie. It’s not exactly like the pastel we were used to getting in Brazil, but it definitely provides that favorite flavor of guava and cheese that I grew so fond of during our time there.\n\nPastel Romeu e Julieta\n\nTranslated and adapted from 1000 Receitas da Culinária Brasileira, Pastel de frango\n\n2 cups flour\n\n½ cup butter, room temperature\n\nPinch of salt\n\nWater as needed\n\nGuava jam\n\nMozzarella cheese, thinly sliced\n\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the flour and butter. Just like a pie crust, mix until the butter is pea-sized and incorporated well. Add water a teaspoon at a time until the dough comes together into a consistency that can be rolled out. It took about 1 tbsp for me.\n\nRoll the dough to about ¼ inch thickness on a floured board and cut into 8 equal squares or rectangles. Place 4 squares on a cookie sheet and spread evenly with jam leaving a ¼ inch edge. Spread about 1 tbsp of jam thinly per square. Top the jam with thinly sliced cheese. Using water, lightly wet the edges of the squares. Place the second layer of dough on top and use a fork to seal the edges.\n\nSprinkle the top with cinnamon and sugar. Bake at 375 degrees F for about 15 minutes until just before the jam begins to bubble out and the pastel is lightly browned. Remove, let cool slightly and enjoy warm. Makes 4 baked pasteis.\n\nMore Brazilian foods and recipes:\n\nAçaí na Tigela\n\nBeijinhos\n\nBrigadeiro\n\nCanjica\n\nSagu de Vinho\n\nMoqueca\n\nStrogonoff de Frango\n\nCauliflower & Mandioquinha Soup\n\nEscondidinho de Frango\n\nFoods of Minas Gerais\n\nBrazilian Fondue\n\nPinhão"
