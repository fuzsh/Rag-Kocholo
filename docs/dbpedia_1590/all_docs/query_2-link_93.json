        "text": "Today was the first sunny day in Rio since I arrived 2 days ago, so of course I had to go to the beach! But first, I made breakfast:\n\nThe beach turned out to be terrible. Just kidding. It was everything I had hoped and dreamed. The sun was very warm, but the breeze was cool, although not too cool. I drifted in and out of sleep (with one arm or my head on my bag of course), read some of my Brazil guidebook, and people-watched.\n\nContrary to popular belief, not all Brazilians are devastatingly sexy.\n\nYesterday I managed to visit two apartments AND go to the bank to withdraw rent money. How’s that for productive eh? Had a nice long chat with family as well, followed by late night movie time with Berna (we watched The Barbarian Invasions — though mildly touching, we both found it pretty dull).\n\nHere are some photos of the apartments I visited.\n\nApartment 1:\n\n1,400 reais (~$710 USD)\n\nPros: Privacy (I have my own bathroom, and a giant veranda that isn’t currently being used. I am 1 of 2 people who live on this floor, which is the top floor). Most of this floor is an open air terrace! Located on the busiest street in Copacabana, 2 blocks from the beach. On the top floor (the 11th floor), so there ain’t no noise.\n\nCons: Privacy — The terrace has a queen-size bed.. which leads me to believe that the landlord or someone else might use this space to entertain during busier months..\n\nApartment 2:"
