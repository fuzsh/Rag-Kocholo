        "text": "3.1. TD-NMR Decays\n\nshows the TD-NMR signals of three RC samples with different chemical compositions acquired using CPMG ( a) and CWFP-T1 ( b) pulse sequences. The TD-NMR relaxation curves are colored according to moisture content (black line = lowest, blue = medium, and red = highest moisture content). It is observed that the RC sample with the highest moisture (red line) had a significantly higher T2 value than the sample with the lowest moisture content (black line). This is in agreement with results reported in the literature [33,34], which showed that an increase in moisture resulted in a higher T2 relaxation time. Similar behavior was observed for T1 values; The sample with the highest moisture (red line) had a significantly higher T1 value than the sample with the lowest moisture (black line). T2 and T1 relaxation spectra of the three RC samples estimated by the Inverse Laplace transform (ILT) are shown respectively in c,d [35]. The mean T2 and T1 relaxation curves show the presence of two populations, agreeing with previous studies in the literature, which reported that the T2 relaxation in RC is mainly bi-exponential [16,17].\n\nThe transverse relaxation times of the CPMG curves ( a) showed that the samples with low, medium, and high moisture could be resolved into a fast-relaxing time constant (T21) equals to 2, 3, and 12 ms, respectively, and a slow-relaxing time constant (T22) equals to 30, 41, and 78 ms, respectively. For CWFP-T1 signals, the RC samples with low, medium, and high moisture showed T11 values of 23, 43, and 58 ms, respectively, and a T12 of 329, 374, and 284 ms, respectively.\n\nAs RC contains between 55 and 80% of water and less than 22% of fat, the relaxation signals are dominated by the water relaxation time. As T1 > T2 is an indication that water mobility is restricted by the interaction of dry matter products, mainly lipids, proteins, and saccharides that correspond to 20–45% of the RC.\n\n3.3. Regression Models\n\nInitial PLS models were built by correlating the full TD-NMR decay and reference values of moisture, FDM, FWM, and DDM. As already mentioned (Section 2.4), the whole data set (27 traditional, 9 light, 4 vegan, 3 lactose-free, and 2 fibers) was divided into 33 samples for the training set and 12 samples for the test set. The models were optimized through the detection of outliers based on samples with extreme leverages, large residuals in the X block (spectral outliers) or in the Y block (prediction outliers) were detected at the 95% confidence level. The number of latent variables (LV) was chosen based on the smallest RMSECV values estimated using random subsets (10 data splits and 20 iterations). The figures of merit of the models showed that the predictions were not very accurate and thus could not be considered satisfactory. To confirm the model significance, a permutation test was performed, in which 100 interactions were performed comparing permuted with unpermuted models considering self-prediction and cross-validation. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Wilcoxon) indicates that the models are significant at a 95% confidence level. Moreover, in the self-prediction approach, the signed-rank test (sign test) and randomization t-test (Rand t test) were above 0.05, indicating that these models (permuted and nonpermutes) are not significantly different at the 95% limit. Since this outcome could be attributed to the possible presence of a high amount of irrelevant and/or noisy variables in the data set, the OPS variable selection was conducted.\n\nThe comparison of the PLS models with and without variable reduction for DDM quantification is shown in . The best models were obtained autoOPS algorithm, with a window of 10 and increments of 5, which is coherent with the literature [32]. The number of variables used to build the models was significantly reduced from 993 to 205 for CPMG data and from 5965 to 75 for CWFP-T1 data [36]. The models were obtained with 3 LV, providing parsimonious models. It can be seen that the variable selection steps increase the accuracy of the CWFP-T1 model. Comparing the results obtained with “full data”, the OPS-PLS model attained the best results with an RMSEP value of 1.38% and R2pred of 0.90. Conversely, results suggested that the variable selection did not significantly improve the CPMG model in terms of RMSEP, RPD, and REP. A permutation test indicated that both OPS-PLS models were substantially different from the unpermuted ones and did not display overfitting at a 95% level.\n\nTable 1\n\nCPMGCWFPFullOPSFullOPS Nvars * 993205596575 LV 3333 RMSEP ** 1.511.531.841.38 R2pred 0.490.670.820.90 RPDpred 1.371.361.461.95 REPpred ** 9.559.6711.608.70\n\nThe RPD value can also confirm the good prediction capacity of the CWFP-T1 model. RPD is a dimensionless figure of merit specifically used to evaluate the trueness of multivariate calibration models in absolute terms. According to the literature [37,38,39], desirable calibration models must have an RPD higher than 2.4, while RPD values between 2.4 and 1.5 are considered acceptable. Models with RPD less than 1.5 are considered unusable. Thus, the RPD value for the CWFP-T1 model was considered satisfactory, whereas the RPD value for the CPMG model was considered unusable. The REP was another figure of merit calculated to evaluate the trueness of the models, whose values were 9.55 and 8.70% w w−1, for the CPMG and CWFP-T1 models, respectively. This scenario is completely acceptable once the analysis was performed directly on the packaged commercial products. These results can also be graphically visualized in , where the measured vs. predicted plots for both the calibration and validation sets are displayed.\n\nSimilar approaches were explored to quantify FWM, FDM, and moisture in the RC samples. The commercial samples presented FWM contents from 33 to 73% w w−1, FDM contents from 9 to 30% w w−1, and moisture contents from 56 to 77% w w−1. The PLS models were developed using the autoOPS algorithm, with a window of 10 and increments of 5. The number of variables used to build the models was 205 and 75 for CPMG and CWFP-T1, respectively. The best models were obtained with 4 LV. Results showed that the CPMG models are inadequate to predict fat in wet and dry matter and moisture in the RC samples, with lower values of R2pred (<0.28) and RPDpred (<1.26) and higher values of RMSEP and REP (>7.71 w w−1) ( ). Furthermore, a permutation test indicated that models were not significantly different from the unpermuted ones at the 95% level. Conversely, the models developed using CWFP-T1 data showed to be suitable with R2pred of 0.92, RMSEP of 4.71% w w−1, REP of 8.79% w w−1 and RPDpred of 2.92 for fat in wet matter, R2pred of 0.85, RMSEP of 3.28% w w−1, RPDpred of 16.68% w w−1 and RPDpred of 2.32 for fat in wet matter the model and R2pred of 0.70, RMSEP of 3.00% w w−1, REP of 4.65% w w−1 and RPDpred of 1.77 for moisture.\n\nTable 2\n\nCPMGCWFP-T₁Fat in Dry\n\nMatterFat in Wet MatterMoistureFat in Dry\n\nMatterFat in Wet MatterMoisture RMSEP * 10.906.124.974.713.283.00 R2pred 0.280.230.0500.920.850.70 RPDpred 1.261.241.072.922.321.77 REPpred * 20.3531.137.718.7916.684.65\n\nThe reference vs. predicted values for (a) FWM (% w w−1), (b) FDM (% w w−1) and (c) moisture content (% w w−1) by using CWFP-T1 decays combined with the OPS selection variable method are shown in .\n\nRegression models were also evaluated by correlating the T1 or T2 values against the moisture, fat, and defatted dry matter contents (univariate approaches) and combining T1 and T2 values (multivariate approaches). However, results obtained with the full TD-NMR decays showed better predictability, with a higher correlation coefficient. Therefore, only these results were shown in detail in the manuscript.\n\nMethods based on near- and mid-infrared spectroscopy have been reported in the literature for moisture and fat determination in dairy products, especially in cheese [40]. Nevertheless, no study on RC samples was found. A procedure to quantify fat and moisture in cow mozzarella cheeses by using reflectance near-infrared spectroscopy has been developed and validated [37]. The PLS models were constructed within the ranges from 38.7 to 58.0% w w−1 on dry basis for fat and from 41.5 to 55.1% w w−1 for moisture, providing RMSEP of 2.1 and 0.9%, respectively. The performance of near- and mid-infrared spectroscopy to determine several quality parameters of cheese, including moisture and fat was compared [41] and the results showed that near-infrared spectroscopy was more accurate than mid-infrared, with RPD of 2.14 and 3.38% for fat and moisture, respectively [41]. These infrared procedures showed better predictability than the results acquired with TD-NMR. However, the proposed TD-NMR relaxometry method is interesting because it is applicable in through-package determinations, which is not possible with the infrared ones. Thus, the RC parameters can be predicted using TD-NMR relaxometry and chemometrics without violating the seal of packages."
