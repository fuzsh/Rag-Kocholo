Requeijão

Requeijão (Portuguese pronunciation: [ʁekejˈʒɐ̃w]) is a milk-derived product, produced in Portugal and Brazil. It is sometimes called requesón (the Spanish word for ricotta) in English-speaking countries. It is a loose, ricotta-like cheese used to make cheese spreads. A mild, unsalty ricotta can be substituted. This variety is most often sold in the markets wrapped in fresh corn husks. In El Salvador, cheeses such as requesón can sometimes be transported wrapped in banana leaves instead of corn husks. The Portuguese product is white to yellowish-white, solid, and usually having a characteristic strong taste; typically sold in specially designed draining plastic or basket-like weaved containers, or in plastic cups. The Brazilian product is a type of cream cheese white in color (but not similar to the American notion of cream cheese, and may be better understood as "creamy cheese"). It has a mild taste and its consistency can vary from creamy solid, like the Catupiry, to liquid. Traditionally associated with the state of Minas Gerais, the mineiro presence in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo from the start of the 20th century on popularized it and nowadays it is produced all over the country. Its most common variant is requeijão cremoso, with a consistency similar to that of condensed milk; usually sold in glasses or plastic cups, both generally re-employed by Brazilians as usual cups. The sweet called romeu-e-julieta is a combination of white cheese and guava paste. It usually calls for queijo minas, requeijão or ricotta, with requeijão generally being the one used in Brazilian-adapted pizzas, crêpes, waffles, pancake rolls and spring rolls.
