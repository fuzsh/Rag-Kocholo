Personal life

Miller was born in Valley Stream, New York, on Long Island. He is Jewish. He has said that one of his grandmothers was from Latvia and one of his grandfathers was from Austria. Miller married television writer Eileen Conn in 1993. The couple has two children.

Career

His roles include the nasty doorman on Seinfeld and Walter Stratford in the movie 10 Things I Hate About You, as well as several characters in Christopher Guest's mockumentary movies. He has also appeared in Carry On Columbus, The Nutty Professor, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, Max Keeble's Big Move, and Pretty Woman. He played Edwin Poole in the ABC dramedy Boston Legal. He is close friends with Jerry Seinfeld and auditioned for the part of George Costanza.

He played night-club owner Michael Dobson in two Law & Order episodes, first in the episode "Coma" and then later in "Encore". Miller appeared as himself in a third episode, "Smoke". He was also in 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, where he played Tommy, Kyle's obnoxious father and Paul's colleague. He also played himself in a later episode of the same series. Additionally, he was the writer for the television shows Uncommon Sense (2005), Just Words (1992), and Pros & Cons (1999).

Miller began a weekly podcast on the Carolla Digital Network, This Week with Larry Miller, suspending it after falling and injuring his head severely in April 2012. After hospitalization and a coma, he said in January 2013 that he was convalescing. Miller resumed the podcast on January 9, 2013. In February 2015 the podcast was retitled The Larry Miller Show with direct distribution.
