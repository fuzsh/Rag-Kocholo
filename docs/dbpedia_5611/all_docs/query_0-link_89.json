        "meta_description": "The Rotary Club of San Luis Obispo de Tolosa brings popular comedians Larry Miller, Jake Johannsen and Pat Hazell to San Luis Obispo for its annual fundraising event. This laugh-filled extravaganza will be held on Feb. 9 at 8 p.m. at the Performing Arts Center.    Tickets range from $30 to $75 and can be purchased at the Performing Arts Center box office or online at www.pacslo.org. This year’s sponsors are Central Coast Mortgage Consultants, PG&E and Kevin Main Jewelry.   Miller has appeared in over 50 films including Pretty Woman, The Princess Diaries, and Waiting For Guffman. He has made regular appearances on Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, and Law and Order, as well as talk shows such as The Tonight Show and The Late Show with David Letterman. Jerry Seinfeld claims, “Larry Miller is, was and always will be the funniest guy I know.”  In “Cocktails with Larry Miller and Friends,” Miller will be joined by fellow comedians Jake Johannsen and Pat Hazell. Johannsen is a regular on late night television, having made more than 40 appearances on David Letterman’s The Late Show, as well as a guest spots on most of the other late night shows. People magazine deemed his HBO comedy special, This Will Take About an Hour, “one of the 10 best television shows of the year,” and TV Guide called it “one of the 50 funniest moments on TV.”  Hazell, whom Showtime titled one of the five funniest people in America, is another Tonight Show veteran as well as one of the original writers for the hit TV show Seinfeld.     “This is my favorite event all year.” said Rotary de Tolosa President Carl Dudley. “I look forward to an entertaining night of comedy and knowing that we will be making a difference in the community, and the world.” Proceeds from the event will go toward funding local youth charities and to international projects like the Rotary’s Polio Plus program to eradicate Polio worldwide.   Tickets for the comedy show may be purchased at the Performing Arts Box Office, open from 12 to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. To order tickets by phone, call (805) 756-4849 or online at www.pacslo.org.    Rotary is an organization of business and professional leaders united worldwide, who provide humanitarian service, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace.
