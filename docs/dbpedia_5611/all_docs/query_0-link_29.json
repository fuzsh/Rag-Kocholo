        "text": "Larry Miller is a \"That Guy.\" You know, one of those guys you see on TV, maybe in a movie, and you know you've seen him in so many other shows and movies. Miller's been on \"Seinfeld\" (annoying doorman) and \"Law & Order\" (cold-blooded killer), and he's been in \"The Nutty Professor\" (Dean Richmond) and \"Pretty Woman\" (Mr. Hollister).\n\nMiller's also an accomplished comedian, a comic's comic, and Saturday he'll bring his considerable talents to the Paramount Theatre in Middletown. There, he'll riff on the absurdities of life, much in the way he does on his podcast \"This Week With Larry Miller,\" and on any number of appearances he makes on \"Late Show With David Letterman,\" \"The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,\" and the list goes on.\n\nWhat: Larry Miller\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Oct. 26\n\nWhere: Paramount Theatre, 17 South St., Middletown\n\nPrice: $35, $45\n\nInformation: 346-4195; middletownparamount.com"
