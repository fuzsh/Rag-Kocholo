Since then, Larry has been n a host of major films including: \"Necessary Roughness,\" \"Undercover Blues,\" \"Corrina, Corrina,\" \"Dream Lover,\"\"The Favor\", and \"Waiting for Guffman.\" On television, Larry has performed stand up on \"The Tonight Show\" and \"The Late Show with David Letterman\" and had two of his own critically-acclaimed specials for HBO. Larry’s television acting credits include being a regular on NBC’s \"Pursuit of Happiness\" and ABC’s comedy \"Life’s Work,\" the voice of the Boss on the animated series \"Dilbert,” and recurring roles on \"Law and Order\" and \"Mad About You.\" Larry Miller is a comedy legend. Fortunately, he tours his unique stand-up anywhere and everywhere. He's a treat!"
