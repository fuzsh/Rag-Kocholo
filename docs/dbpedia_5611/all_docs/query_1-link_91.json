        "text": "Like Kofi Annan, Larry Miller is one of the most irresistible comic personalities working today. Known for years as an actor, writer, comedian, and sexual pioneer, he's gained a new following as a cultural commentator and frequent guest on political shows. Now, in Spoiled Rotten America, he fixes his gaze on what's funny about our daily lives—which includes, roughly speaking, everything. From middle-aged drinking to the excesses of our eating habits, Miller finds the silver lining of absurdity within every black cloud.\n\nUltimately, though, Spoiled Rotten America is an insightful, and surprisingly heartfelt, plea for us to notice what's best and worst about ourselves. \"\"The American pendulum only swings to extremes,\"\" he writes. \"\"The news is on all day, but we know less and less, everyone has a phone but nothing to say. It's all or nothing and the world is going to Hell in a handbasket.\n\n\"\"What better time for a collection of comic essays?\"\"\n\nWhat better time indeed.\n\nLarry Miller was appointed the first chairman of the Jordan Brand Advisory Board in January 2019. Under his leadership, Jordan Brand has grown from a $200-million basketball-shoe company to a $4-billion athletic footwear and apparel firm. Miller helped found the Jordan Brand at Nike in 1999 before becoming president of the Portland Trailblazers from 2007 to 2012, after which he returned to Jordan Brand. Miller graduated with honors from Temple University in 1980 and earned an MBA from LaSalle University. He has served on the boards of directors of Self Enhancement, Inc. A passionate advocate for education and mentorship, he’s taken leadership roles with the Urban League and Junior Achievement in the past. Born in Philadelphia, he lives in Portland, OR.\n\nLarry Miller was appointed the first chairman of the Jordan Brand Advisory Board in January 2019.
