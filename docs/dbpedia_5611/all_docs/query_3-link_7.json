        "text": "After making a name for himself with his droll observational stand-up routines, actor-comedian Larry Miller utilized those same sensibilities to build a lengthy career in film and on television. First gaining nationwide attention on such cable comedy specials as \"One Night Stand\" (HBO, 1988), he soon made an impression in Hollywood as the snide shop clerk in the box office smash \"Pretty Woman\" (1990). From there, it was more film work in projects like Steve Martin's \"L.A. Story\" (1991), interspersed with periodic comedy specials such as \"Larry Miller: Just Words\" (HBO, 1992), and the occasional foray into regular sitcom work with efforts like \"Pursuit of Happiness\" (NBC, 1995-96). Miller also became part of Christopher Guest's informal improvisational troupe with \"Waiting for Guffman\" (1997), as well as starred in and wrote his own made-for-cable comedy \"Pros & Cons\" (Cinemax, 2000), and made a brief, but lasting impression in \"The Princess Diaries\" (2001) and its sequel. Supremely sarcastic, yet surprisingly likable, Miller continuously proved himself to be reliably hilarious as a comic and an actor, in roles ranging from a wrongly convicted felon to a flamboyant makeover artist."
