        "text": "Even if Larry Miller's name is not familiar, you'll certainly recognize the comic -- his credits include television shows such as \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Seinfeld\" and \"10 Things I Hate About You,\" and some of his many film roles include \"New Year's Eve\" and \"Valentine's Day.\"\n\nThe actor is now in the news not for his work, but because he nearly died after suffering a head injury last April. Miller, 58, had just wrapped a podcast with Adam Carolla when he lost his footing, fell, and hit the back of his head on a sidewalk. Miller's spokesperson is now revealing to People magazine that Miller, who is a married father of two, nearly died from the injuries. After the fall, he went into a coma, and was put on life support at UCLA Medical Center for a month.\n\n\"It was a serious brain injury, but Larry has made a remarkable recovery in a short amount of time,\" his spokesperson Michael Hansen told TODAY.com.\n\nHansen also told People. \"It's a miracle he woke up. ... He's lucky to be alive.\"\n\nAfter Miller was conscious again, he had to work hard to regain many basic functions. \"He had to work on some issues regarding brain connectivity,\" Hansen said.\n\nMiller's expected to make a full recovery, and in fact he'll talk about his entire experience on his podcast, This Week with Larry Miller, on Wednesday. A further testament to his recovery: On Jan. 12, he's scheduled to make a live comedy appearance.\n\nAlso in TODAY Entertainment:"
