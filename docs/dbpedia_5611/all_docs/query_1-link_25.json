        "text": "Lawrence \"Larry\" John Miller (born October 15, 1953)[1] is an American stand-up comedian, actor, podcaster and columnist.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nMiller was born in Valley Stream, New York,[1] on Long Island. He is Jewish.[2]He has said that one of his grandmothers was from Latvia and one of his grandfathers was from Austria. Miller married television writer Eileen Conn in 1993. The couple have two children.[3]\n\nActing career[]\n\nMiller is primarily regarded as a character actor and is well known for playing 'stuck up to suck up' characters that alternate between being condescending and sycophantic. [4]\n\nMiller's first acting job was as the Emcee on \"Fame\", the television show. He gained mainstream attention for his part in popular scenes of Pretty Woman involving him as a store clerk for the main characters.\n\nHis film roles include Walter Stratford in the movie 10 Things I Hate About You, as well as several characters in Christopher Guest's mockumentary movies. He has held prominent supporting roles in Carry On Columbus, The Nutty Professor, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, and Max Keeble's Big Move. He has over 50 film appearances. [5]\n\nHe was part of the main cast of Life's Work, The Pursuit of Happiness (TV series), and High School Cupid, a Cupid Inc. Story. He is also a frequent guest actor on television, most notably as the nasty doorman on Seinfeld. He played Edwin Poole in the ABC dramedy Boston Legal. He played night-club owner Michael Dobson in two Law & Order episodes, first in the episode \"Coma\" and then later in \"Encore\". Miller appeared as himself in a third episode, \"Smoke\". He was also in 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter, where he played Tommy, Kyle's obnoxious father and Paul's colleague. [6]\n\nHe is close friends with Jerry Seinfeld and auditioned for the part of George Costanza.[7][8]\n\nTelevision writing[]\n\nMiller served as a writer for the television shows Uncommon Sense (2005), Just Words (1992), and Pros & Cons(1999).[citation needed]\n\n[]\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Miller wrote a column for the magazine The Weekly Standard that usually ran once every two weeks.[9] Since then, he has continued to contribute occasionally to the magazine. His subject matter has included politics as well as reminiscences about fellow entertainers, and anecdotes from his own life.[10]\n\nTwo of the columns he wrote in 2002 served as the text for frequently-forwarded emails at the time, though in both cases his words were attributed to others. The first was his very first Weekly Standard column in January 2002, in which he mocked various anti-war platitudes of the time;[9] the text was incorrectly attributed to retired Air Force general Richard E. Hawley.[11] The second was an April 2002 column defending Israel in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict,[12] which was attributed to fellow comedian Dennis Miller.[13] Another email which also began to be forwarded in 2002, purporting to offer \"George Carlin's Views on Aging\", was derived in part from a stand-up routine that Larry Miller performed in the 1990s.[14]\n\nMiller began a weekly podcast on the Carolla Digital Network, This Week with Larry Miller, suspending it after falling and injuring his head severely in April 2012. After hospitalization and a coma, he said in January 2013 that he was convalescing. Miller resumed the podcast on January 9, 2013.[15] In February 2015 the podcast was retitled The Larry Miller Show with direct distribution.[citation needed]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nYear Film Role 1990 Pretty Woman Mr. Hollister Almost an Angel Teller 1991 Necessary Roughness Dean Phillip Elias Suburban Commando Adrian Beltz Frankenstein: The College Years [16] Prof. Loman 1992 Carry on Columbus The Chief 1993 Dream Lover Norman Undercover Blues Detective Sergeant Halsey 1994 Corrina, Corrina Sid Radioland Murders Herman Katzenbach 1995 The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (TV) Dean Al Valentine 1996 The Nutty Professor Dean Richmond Waiting for Guffman Mayor Glenn Welsch 1997 For Richer or Poorer Derek Lester 1998 Chairman of the Board Bradford MacMillan Carnival of Souls Louis Seagram 1999 Pros & Cons Ben Babbitt Runaway Bride Kevin the Bartender 10 Things I Hate About You Dr. Walter Stratford OB/GYN 2000 Nutty Professor II: The Klumps Dean Richmond Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins XR (voice) Best in Show Max Berman 2001 Max Keeble's Big Move Principal Elliot T.
