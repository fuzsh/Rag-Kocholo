        "text": "Biography\n\nA star on Dean Smithâ€™s first two Final Four teams at North Carolina, Larry Miller is one of just three players in ACC history to win ACC Player of the Year and ACC Tournament MVP in consecutive seasons. From 1965-68, Miller scored 1,982 points, a mark that remains in the top 10 of the Tar Heel record book. He was a consensus first-team All-American in 1968 and earned second-team All-America honors in 1967, and is one of only three UNC players to average 20 points or more in three different seasons. Miller went on to play seven seasons in the ABA, where in 1972 he set a league record with 67 points in a game."
