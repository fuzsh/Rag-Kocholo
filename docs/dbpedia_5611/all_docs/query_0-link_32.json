        "text": "Is opera real? The fat man doesn’t really love the fat woman, and she doesn’t really have tuberculosis, and they’re not even looking at each other as they sing facing the audience (and desperately trying to get their short arms around each other.\n\nI love opera, by the way — You can’t sleep like that at home — But think of the kind of acting you see in opera, the back of the hand melodramatically held to the forehead, the shoulders heaving with tears. It doesn’t move us because it’s \"true\" or \"real\" or looks like everyday life.\n\nWell, wrestling is opera mixed with McDonald’s. Wrestling is opera for people who go to McDonald’s.\n\nAnd you know what? I go to McDonald’s. So do you. Not all the time, but you \"get\" McDonald’s\", and so do I, and you go when you feel like it, and sometimes, when walking through an airport, only McDonald’s will do.\n\nFolks, that wrestling was so much fun. My younger son loves it, and I love it with him, and we’ve seen some of the network stuff, and some pay-per-view things, and we have the best time together."
