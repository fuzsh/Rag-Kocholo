        "text": "Read Story Transcript\n\nLarry Miller has enjoyed incredible success in the boardroom, helping build Nike's Michael Jordan brand into a billion-dollar business. But he did it all while hiding a horrible secret that he's only speaking out about now.\n\nAt the age of 16, he shot and killed another teenager, eventually serving time in jail for murder. Now, at 72, he's sharing that story with the hopes of inspiring people who need to turn their life around.\n\n\"I think my responsibility is to be open and share my experience, and not only share it, but then to try to get involved in doing things that are going to help people from going down the same path that I'm going down,\" Miller told Matt Galloway on The Current.\n\nMiller grew up in West Philadelphia, and said that even though he was a good student, he fell in with the Cedar Avenue gang that operated in his neighbourhood at the age of 12.\n\n\"At a certain point, it became more important to me to impress people in the street than teachers and parents,\" he said.\n\n\"There was a certain cool factor about the guys in the gang.\"\n\nNot long after, he was given a gun by his girlfriend at the time. One day, when Miller was 16, he and his friend wanted revenge for a fellow gang member who had recently been killed.\n\nEdward White, a man with no gang connections, was unfortunate enough to run into the group, who had been drinking at the time. Miller shot and killed him.\n\n\"If I could go back and change that, I absolutely would. I think about it every day,\" said Miller. \"The fact that I took the life of a young Black man is something that eats at me every single day.\"\n\nMiller writes about his experiences in his new memoir, Jump: My Secret Journey from the Street to the Boardroom.\n\nHe hopes readers understand what they can accomplish after serving time in jail — and the importance of providing opportunities for people with a criminal record.\n\n\"The goal should be to have people come out a better person than they were when they went in. And I want to try to help be a part of that,\" he said.\n\nLearning to hide it\n\nMiller was charged as an adult, and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. He was sentenced to spend up to 20 years in jail. He was released after four-and-a-half years, but soon found himself back in jail after his involvement in some armed robberies.\n\nDuring that his second stint in jail, he had the opportunity to take college classes. He said he also met people who made him believe he could change his life.\n\n\"One of the things that I was hoping comes out of this story is that maybe it would change how people perceive formerly incarcerated people and be more willing to give them an opportunity,\" said Miller.\n\nThose opportunities didn't come easily to Miller at first.\n\nShortly after his time in prison, he interviewed for a job with an accounting firm. The process was going well — until Miller shared the details of his criminal history with the hiring manager.\n\n\"I could see his face changing as I'm talking to him and I'm like, 'OK, this is not going like I hoped it would go,\" he recalled.\n\nThe manager told him the company had planned on hiring him, but knowing what he knew now, they couldn't take the risk.\n\nThat day, Miller decided he would keep that part of his life a secret.\n\n\"I wasn't going to be dishonest, but I wasn't going to offer up the information,\" he said. \"I went 40 years hiding from this story and keeping it in, hoping that it didn't come out.\"\n\nKeeping the secret\n\nMiller hid his story from some major companies he worked at according to Business Insider, including Kraft Foods, the Campbell Soup Company — and Nike.\n\nHe was hired by the sportswear giant in 1997 as vice president and general manager of Nike basketball. He also worked as president of Nike's Jordan brand between 1999 and 2006, meeting and working with Michael Jordan himself.\n\nDuring his time at Nike, Miller also had to pass a security check from two different White House administrations, when he met then-U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at separate dinners.\n\nBefore the latter meeting, he remembers receiving a phone call from the person who had set up the dinner. He was running a background check.\n\nHe asked what Miller's middle name was. Miller told him it was Garland.\n\n\"He said, 'There's this Larry Miller guy that has all these felonies and stuff on his record. But you're good, you're Garland. You're good,'\" Miller recalled.\n\nMiller didn't say anything to the contrary, and went on to have dinner with Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\nRevealing the secret\n\nNow chairman of the Jordan brand, Miller was convinced by his daughter to share his story.\n\n\"She basically convinced me that ... it could motivate and inspire some people, and that it could maybe change perceptions for people at some point,\" he said.\n\nOne of the first people Miller told ahead of writing the book was Michael Jordan.\n\n\"His first comment to me was, 'I agree with your daughter, you need to tell this story. It can motivate people. It's going to be inspirational to people. You need to tell this story and I'll support you however I can,'\" said Miller.\n\nWith the support of his daughter, Michael Jordan, and Nike executive Phil Knight, Miller was ready to tell his story.\n\nHe first revealed the story about Edward White's death in a preview for the book in October in Sports Illustrated. But at the time, he had not yet spoken to any of White's family members — who voiced their disappointment in a New York Times story the following November.\n\nMiller met members of White's family shortly after. He told Galloway he expressed his regret and remorse for what he had done, and apologized for not reaching out earlier.\n\n\"After each one of them expressed their feelings, each one of them said directly to me, I forgive you,\" said Miller.\n\n\"If nothing else comes out of this book, out of this process, that is the most important thing that I could have gotten out of it.\"\n\nThat forgiveness, Miller said, has put him on the path to forgive himself for what he did.\n\n\"I think I am pretty close to being there, and I think the fact that the family has forgiven me goes a long way. I hope God has forgiven me and you know, I'm in the process of forgiving myself.\"\n\nWritten by Philip Drost with files from Mouhamad Rachini. Produced by Howard Goldenthal."
