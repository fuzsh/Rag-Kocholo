        "text": "Larry Miller, who has starred in more than 100 movies, including \"Pretty Woman\" and \"The Princess Diaries,\" has recovered from a life-threatening brain injury he sustained last April.\n\nMiller, 58, fell and hit the back of his head when he tripped on concrete outside the Toluca Lake, Calif., studio where he records his podcast.\n\nHis spokesman, Michael Hansen, told ABCNews.com that Miller had gone into a coma for two weeks and was placed in intensive care at UCLA Medical Center. Miller was then kept in a medically induced coma for a month, Hansen said.\n\n\"It has been a slow recovery process regarding his brain connectivity, which he had to work on,\" Hansen said. \"It takes time to heal with these types of injuries, but he is doing extremely well.\"\n\nHansen said Miller was expected to make a full recovery and would return to work on his podcast series \"This Week With Larry Miller\" Wednesday.\n\n\"He is one of the fortunate few who have recovered from something so traumatic,\" Hansen said. \"He will have a bright long life ahead of him, and he is looking forward to going back to work.\""
