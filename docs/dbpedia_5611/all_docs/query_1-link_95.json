It’s in the tradition of great American radio raconteurs like Jean Shepherd and Garrison Keillor.\n\nAnd it’s the only podcast recorded from inside an extinct volcano!\n\nMiller’s genteel tales are witty without being stuffy and uplifting without being naive. Join the party! It’s time well spent!\n\nLarry is best-known for his stand-up comedy and his roles in movies such as Pretty Woman, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Best In Show, Waiting For Guffman, A Mighty Wind and 10 Things I Hate About You."
