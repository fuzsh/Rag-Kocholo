        "text": "The Larry H. and Gail Miller Enrichment Scholarship was established in 2002 thanks to the generous support of the Larry H. and Gail Miller Family Foundation. Each year, the scholarship supports deserving students who will contribute to an educationally diverse environment at the University of Utah.\n\nThe Miller Enrichment Scholarship awards full tuition and fees, on-campus room and board, a textbook allowance, and in some cases, an experiential learning stipend. We recognize that a diverse student body benefits and enriches the educational experiences of all students, faculty and staff. Thus the U strives to attract students who have the ability to contribute to and benefit from a culturally and intellectually diverse learning community. Our goal is to make every attempt to support the student’s academic and personal success while enrolled at the U.\n\nEligible students are those with demonstrated financial need as determined by the FAFSA during the time of initial application. If a student has questions about their eligibility that can reach out directly to the University Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at financialaid@utah.edu. Students will be selected from applicants who are under-represented in higher education in Utah and those who are first in their family to attend college, and those who have graduated from a Utah High School. In the event that no students qualify for the award on that basis, the scholarship may be awarded to other students who are first generation college students and who will contribute to an educationally diverse environment at the University of Utah. A primary goal of the scholarship is to integrate students with campus life through volunteer community/leadership service.\n\nThe Miller Enrichment Scholarship award may include any or all of the following benefits:\n\nFull Tuition and Fees (for undergraduate Utah residents) up to 15 credit hours per semester\n\nOn-Campus Room and Board (equivalent to a double occupancy room and up to 21 meals per week)\n\nTextbook Allowance ($300 per semester)\n\nOpportunity for an internship and experiential learning stipend ($1350 per semester)\n\nThis scholarship is renewable for up to ten semesters for new freshmen. To renew this award, students must qualify annually by maintaining satisfactory academic achievement and making acceptable progress toward a Bachelor’s degree and abide by the University of Utah, Student Code of Conduct.\n\nTo qualify for this scholarship, applicants must:\n\nHave and maintain a 2.50 GPA\n\nBe admitted to the University of Utah as a matriculated undergraduate student\n\nBe a Utah resident for the academic year for which they are applying\n\nGraduated from a Utah High School\n\nBe the first in their immediate family to attend any amount of college\n\nDemonstrate financial need\n\nTo ensure that you are considered for this scholarship, please submit all application materials and supporting documents no later than January 31, 2024.\n\nNOTE: A Letter of Recommendation is required. Please ensure that your reference can speak to your academic or leadership abilities.\n\nAll applicants will be notified of the scholarship decision by April 30th of each year (Updated 5/3/2024) Due to the FAFSA delays, we won’t be able to notify recipients until after Financial Need is determined by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, which is anticipated for June 2024."
