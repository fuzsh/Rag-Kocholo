        "text": "The Just Trust Welcomes Larry Miller to Board of Directors\n\nâ\n\nDURHAM, NC (June 11, 2024)âThe Just Trust, an organization dedicated to scaling, aligning, and deploying resources and support to criminal justice reform and public safety innovation in the United States, today announced Larry Miller as the newest board member of its 501(c)(3), The Just Trust for Education. Miller is the Chairman of the Jordan Brand at Nike, former President of the Portland Trail Blazers, celebrated author of Jump, and criminal justice reform advocate that brings personal lived experience with the justice system to his work.\n\nâWhen people impacted by the justice system are given the opportunity to succeed and thrive, anything is possible,â said Larry Miller. âIâm joining forces with The Just Trust to help build a criminal justice system that opens far more doors than it closes, and that nurtures â rather than squanders â the potential of every man, woman, and child who encounters it.â\n\nâThe Just Trust has the grounded vision, smart strategy, and strong network of partners needed to do this work not just when itâs easy, but also when itâs hard,â adds Miller.\n\nLarry Miller joins Dr. Priscilla Chan, co-founder and CEO of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Brian Hooks, Chairman and CEO of Stand Together on the board of The Just Trust for Education. The Just Trust for Action (501(c)(4)) is overseen by a separate board that includes David Plouffe, Kevin Madden, and Jenny Kim.Â\n\nâIt is the honor of a lifetime to welcome Mr. Miller to The Just Trust,â said Ana Zamora, Founder & CEO of The Just Trust. âHis fierce brand acumen combined with his personal experience with the justice system will bring invaluable skills and insight to this work. There is no doubt in my mind that the next chapter of the criminal justice system in America will be profoundly better in part because Larry had a hand in writing it.â\n\nThe Just Trust was founded with a one-time $350 million seed investment from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in 2021. It has since moved over $100 million to organizations of all shapes and sizes working to advance justice reform and public safety innovation in nearly every state in the U.S., and provides advocacy and philanthropic advising services, messaging and public opinion research, and narrative change and communications support in addition to its capacity as a grantmaker. The Just Trust works across ideological, political, and geographic divides to ensure that criminal justice reform can advance in all 50 states.Â\n\n###\n\nAbout The Just Trust\n\nThe Just Trust is 100% dedicated to scaling, aligning, and deploying resources to criminal justice reform in the United States. It is made up of The Just Trust for Education, a 501(c)(3), and The Just Trust for Action, a 501(c)(4). Visit TheJustTrust.org for more information.\n\nâ"
