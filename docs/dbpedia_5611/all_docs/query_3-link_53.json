Later in life, as he ascended the corporate ladder, Miller kept his past a secret, afraid that it would jeopardize his career. In this episode of The Limits, Miller tells Jay Williams why he couldn't keep his secret any longer, and how he took Michael Jordan's ideas and turned them into one of the most successful athlete-driven brands in the world.
