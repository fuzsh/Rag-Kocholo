        "text": "NEW YORK, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SIGA Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: SIGA), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on health security and infectious diseases, announced the appointment of Larry Miller as general counsel, effective today.\n\n“With over twenty years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry, Larry brings a proven track record of growing commercial businesses, successful mergers and acquisitions, and strong corporate governance, which are critical to driving SIGA’s continued success and growth strategies forward,” said Diem Nguyen, Chief Executive Officer. “Larry will be instrumental in helping us expand our reach on a global scale and maximize the benefits we bring to patients, customers, and shareholders.”\n\nPreviously, Mr. Miller served as general counsel and secretary at Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel treatments for gastrointestinal disorders. In this role, he provided strategic legal advice in diverse areas including securities, corporate governance, mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property, regulatory strategy, clinical development, and commercialization. He also served as general counsel and secretary at Blue Buffalo Company, advising the company through its $8 billion sale to General Mills. Earlier in his career, he held increasingly senior roles at Pfizer Inc., and was an attorney with Arnold & Porter and Weil, Gotshal & Manges.\n\nMr. Miller earned his bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College and law degree from Columbia Law School.\n\n“I’m excited to join the SIGA team and help support its important mission of providing solutions for unmet needs in health security and infectious diseases,” said Mr. Miller. “SIGA is well positioned for growth, and I look forward to leveraging our collective strengths to build on its momentum and enhance our contributions to global health.”\n\nABOUT SIGA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\nSIGA Technologies, Inc. is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the health security market. Health security comprises countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear attacks (biodefense market), vaccines and therapies for emerging infectious diseases, and health preparedness. Our lead product is TPOXX®, also known as tecovirimat and ST-246®, an orally administered and IV formulation antiviral drug for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus.\n\nABOUT TPOXX®\n\nTPOXX is a novel small-molecule drug and the US maintains a supply of TPOXX under Project BioShield. The oral formulation of TPOXX was approved by the FDA for the treatment of smallpox in 2018, and the IV formulation was approved for the same indication in 2022. The full label is available by clicking here. Oral tecovirimat received approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines and Healtcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom in 2022. The EMA and UK approvals include labeling for oral tecovirimat indicating its use for the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia complications following vaccination against smallpox. The full label is available by clicking here. In September 2018, SIGA signed a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for additional procurement and development related to both oral and intravenous formulations of TPOXX.

Smallpox, a highly contagious and fatal disease, presents itself as a risk to global health security today given fears of its release accidentally or intentionally as a bioweapon. Mpox virus, similar to smallpox, causes intermittent human infections, painful lesions, and possible case fatalities. Mpox outbreaks have been observed recently in the US, Europe, and Central & West Africa. Whether through natural occurrence or potential bioweapon warfare, orthopox threatens global health. Anti-virals and vaccines serve as possible solutions to address these threats.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including statements relating to SIGA’s future business development including securing new contracts and partnerships.
