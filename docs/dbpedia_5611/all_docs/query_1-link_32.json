        "text": "Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Dave Chappele, and Norm McDonald\n\nRichard Pryor has been mentioned several times in this thread, and rightfully so. I probably rented Live on the Sunset Strip a dozen times back in the day, and it still holds up incredibly well. Pryor was amazing!!!\n\nI love many mentioned, but six pages in and no:\n\nGilbert Gottfried\n\nBobcat Goldthwait\n\nRichard Belzer\n\nGilbert and Bobcat's delivery turn off a lot of folks, but their jokes were/are absolutely top-notch. Unbelievably quick and intelligent.\n\nBobcat was on a local radio show, and they announced a Yes Concert. His remark: \"Did one of them have to make a castle payment?\"\n\nSame show, Gottfried listened to a long sob story from a listener who'd had a souvenir Bills jacket destroyed in a motorcycle accident and was gunning for a replacement. His remark: \"Well, if you'd taken care of the first one...\"\n\nMany I have forgotten the names. The Magician Comedian from Night Court the judge. He was a regular on the late shows and really funny.\n\nA gut for the life of me I cant remember the name Carson and Letterman had him on a lot. Curly blond hair deep voice wire-rimmed glasses and very dry wit. He would double over Johnny in laughter.\n\nAll time? Norm MacDonald. Charismastic, witty, always willing to be the butt of the joke.\n\nBut I have a real soft spot for the Amazing Jonathan. He was never going to be the next Carlin with the type of act he did, but I think he was utterly unique."
