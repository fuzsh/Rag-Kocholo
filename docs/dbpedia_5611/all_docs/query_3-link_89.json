Would his talent have taken him to Nike, where he led the Jordan brand?\n\nIt’s time for business leaders to rethink their hiring practices and start giving the formerly incarcerated more opportunities to prove themselves, say Hise Gibson and coauthors of a Harvard Business School case study about Miller's life and career. When Miller was a teenager, he murdered another teenager and served time in prison. While incarcerated, he earned an accounting degree, but after a prospective employer rescinded a job offer, he vowed not to reveal his past.\n\nIn this video, Gibson discusses why business leaders need to hear Miller's story.\n\nDirected by Jamal Meneide, a filmmaker based in Boston.\n\nProduced in collaboration with Danielle Kost and Dina Gerdeman of HBS Working Knowledge.\n\nInspired by the case \"Larry Miller\" by Francesca Gino, Frances X. Frei, Hise Gibson, and Alicia Dadlani.\n\nThe Journey of Larry Miller\n\nVIDEO: From Prison Cell to Nike’s C-Suite: The Journey of Larry Miller\n\nLarry Miller shares how education helped him escape a life of crime and why employers should give the formerly incarcerated a second chance."
