The Governorate of New Castile (Gobernación de Nueva Castilla) was the gubernatorial region administered to Francisco Pizarro in 1528 by King Charles I of Spain, of which he was appointed governor. The region roughly consisted of modern Peru and was after the foundation of Lima in 1535 divided. The conquest of the Inca empire in 1531–1533, performed by Pizarro and his brothers set the basis for the territorial boundaries of New Castile. After the territorial division of South America between Spain and Portugal, the Peruvian colonial administration was divided into four enclaves: New Castile, consisting of the territories from roughly the Ecuadorian-Colombian border in the north to Cuzco in the south, New Toledo, forming the previous southern half of the Inca empire, stretching towards central Chile, New Andalusia, which was not formally conquered for Spain until decades later, and New Léon (later the New Kingdom of León), the southernmost part of the continent. This territorial division set the basis for the colonial administration of Southern America for decades to come, even though it was formally dissolved in 1544 when Charles sent his personal envoy, Blasco Núñez Vela, to govern the recently founded Viceroyalty of Peru.
