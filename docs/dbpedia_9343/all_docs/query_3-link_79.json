        "text": "We have been told that ʿAbd al-Rahman had a nocturnal emission in the city of Guadalajara, while on a campaign.\n\nEarly Islamic Spain: The History of Ibn al-Qūṭīya, ed. & trans. D. James, (London, 2009), 98-99.\n\nSo begins the historian Ibn al-Qutiya (d. 977) in one of his more unusual stories about the Umayyad Emir of al-Andalus, ʿAbd al-Rahman II (r. 822-852). As an opening gambit it’s certainly striking, particularly as if one were to attempt a Sellars and Yeatman style history of Muslim Spain (a 711 and all That, perhaps), ʿAbd al-Rahman II would appear as a Good Emir. His reputation is that of a reformer, who established government administration, built walls and mosques, oversaw a cultural flowering at his court and defeated viking raiders. Anecdotes about wet dreams do not normally feature in the description of such figures.\n\nThe rest of the passage runs as follows:\n\n‘[ʿAbd al-Rahman] went to perform the ablutions for prayers, which being done, and while the servant was drying his head, he called for Ibn al-Shamir and recited the following verse:\n\n‘From Córdoba, in the night came/ A nocturnal traveller, without the knower knowing it.’\n\nIbn al-Shamir responded to this rather unusual prompt with a verse of his own:\n\n‘Welcome to the one/ Who comes in the dark of night!’\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Qutiya:\n\nThis excited ʿAbd al-Rahman, and he was overcome with the desire to be with one of his favourite concubines, so he turned his command of the army over to his son al-Hakam and returned to Córdoba.’\n\nWhat are we to make of this?\n\nThe first thing to note is that Ibn al-Qutiya is generally very positive about ʿAbd al-Rahman. Elsewhere in his History, Ibn al-Qutiya described the Emir as having ‘lived a meritorious life’, saying that ‘his subjects thought well of him’. ʿAbd al-Rahman leaving his military command to get laid doesn’t sound like a particularly responsible thing to do, but there is no explicit hint of condemnation in the passage in question.\n\nWith the exception of his account about the vikings, Ibn al-Qutiya downplays the very real military challenges the Emir faced in his reign, preferring instead to focus on the relationships within and culture of the court. Our picture of al-Andalus is generally one of high culture, the celebration of the arts and learning, patronised by enlightened rulers. That this is our image is in part testament to the skills of writers of the tenth century such as Ibn al-Qutiya. In the ninth century by contrast, al-Andalus was viewed as a rough and ready Wild West by the rest of the Islamic World.\n\nIn his History Ibn al-Qutiya presents a picture of Córdoba as a city of culture, presided over by a learned Emir. His ʿAbd al-Rahman is a fighter, but his superiority over his enemies is demonstrated by his focus on the things that really matter, poetry, friendship and love, all of which come out in this story. This is epitomised by the poem Ibn al-Shamir is said to have written representing the words of ʿAbd al-Rahman on their journey home:\n\nWhen the morning sun comes up/ it recalls Tarub:\n\na girl of such beauty/ you could think her a wonderful gazelle.\n\nAnd I am the son of the two Hishams of Gahlib/ I start wars and I end them.\n\nIt perhaps loses something in translation but keep Tarub in mind because we will return to her later.\n\nThis is all very well, but it doesn’t explain quite how weird this passage is. The whole account, in which ʿAbd al-Rahman has a wet dream, tells his best mate about it and the two start improvising free verse about the event until the emir is overcome by lust, reads almost like a parody of the civilised courts otherwise celebrated.\n\nThe answer to this lies in genre. Ibn al-Qutiya was not writing a strictly chronological, annalistic chronicle. Indeed he wasn’t writing at all. His students, based on their lecture notes, put the contents of his History together. The History itself is a work of akhbar, effectively a heterogeneous string of anecdotes structured around the reigns of different Emirs. Akhbar existed for a variety of reasons. Sometimes they were written to prove a specific point, explicitly or otherwise, using stories as examples. Other times the purpose was to aid the moral education of the listener. The most common reason, however, was to be entertaining, to amuse an audience with witty stories about the past. In this context, a funny story about the emir deserting his post out of lust and exchanging amusing poetry was something that was going to appeal to a sizeable readership.\n\nMasturbation was generally frowned upon in the medieval Islamic world, with critics drawing upon the Qurʿan 23:5-7\n\nAnd they who guard their private parts, except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they will not be blamed. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.\n\nIn the ninth and tenth centuries, as the madhahib schools of Islamic law began to form, these admonitions became more solid, with the Maliki and Shafiʿi schools being strongly against it, while the Hanbali school was more divided. Even at this time there was disagreement on the question. The historian and jurist al-Tabari (d. 923) argued that masturbation was permissible on the authority of al-ʿAlaʾ b. Ziyad who said ‘There is no problem with it! We used to do it while on military campaigns.’ Ibn Sina (Avicenna, d. 1037) argued for the health benefits of masturbation, warning of the dangers of the build-up of too much semen. Prior to this period, the picture is even more varied, with the general consensus among legal authorities being that while masturbation might be less desirable than sex with a valid sexual partner (wife or concubine), it was better than sex with an invalid partner.\n\n(On female masturbation, the picture is also mixed, with some legal scholars advising women to manage their sexual desires with a pestle, a cucumber or ‘a thing made of hide to resemble a penis’ while others condemned this.)\n\nOutside the sphere of religion and law, masturbation could be seen as a failure of masculinity, a sign that one lacked the wherewithal to acquire a partner and the discipline to manage one’s urges. This made it a natural source of comedy, and it features heavily as a subject in funny stories from the period. The tale of ʿAbd al-Rahman’s nocturnal visitor probably fits in this context. Ibn Hayyan records a poem by al-Ghazali, last encountered in this blog as ʿAbd al-Rahman’s envoy to Constantinople, begging the emir to take pity on him and release him from prison, because the chains were so tight that he couldn’t even masturbate. This hints that jokes about masturbation might have circulated in ʿAbd al-Rahman’s court.\n\nThe emir’s friend in this story, Ibn al-Shamir, was a noted astrologer who had acquired favour with ʿAbd al-Rahman for predicting that he would succeed his father, al-Hakam I (r. 796-822). He was also famed for his poetry and was commissioned to write and perform verses at public occasions, including the funeral of al-Hakam and the celebrations for the enlargement of the Great Mosque of Córdoba. That this also prepared him to extemporise lines on his sovereign’s wet dreams becomes less surprising when we compare this to the career of his later contemporary in the Caliphate, Abu al-ʿAnbas al-Saymari (d. 888). This latter was an astrologer and qadi who came to the attention of Caliph al-Mutawwakil (r. 847-861) for his ribald stories, which made him a fixture at court. Some of these tales were gathered in his The Churning in the Flogging of ʿUmayra, a title which includes not one but two euphemisms for masturbation.\n\nWe know very little about the concubines in ʿAbd al-Rahman’s harem. The emir is reported to have had 87 children, which suggests a large number of concubines, only a handful of whom we can attach a name to. Even those whose names we know tend to appear in our sources as the mothers of emirs, including Halawa (‘Sweetie’), ʿAbd al-Rahman’s mother. His successor, Muhammad I (r. 852-886), was the son of Buhayr (‘Dazzling’), who died when he was young, so he was raised by one the other concubines, al-Shifaʿ (‘Healing’). Al-Shifaʿ also founded a mosque in the west of Córdoba, as did two other concubines of ʿAbd al-Rahman II, Fakhr and Tarub (about whom more below). Among the most celebrated concubines was Qalam, a Basque woman enslaved at an early age, who was famous for her dancing, singing, stories and calligraphy.\n\nIf there is more to Ibn al-Qutiya’s story than just an amusing tale, I think it lies in al-Shamir’s subsequent reference to Tarub. Later writers such as al-Maqqari (d. 1632) noted that ʿAbd al-Rahman II was famous for his libido. According to them, in his later years the emir was entirely under the sway of his favourite, Tarub, who had enormous influence over him. In that context, Tarub may be the concubine that ʿAbd al-Rahman abandoned his post to go and see. Al-Shamir (and through him, Ibn al-Qutiya) may have been trying to make a point about Tarub’s unhealthy sway over the emir.\n\nWhile I strongly suspect that this might well be a story spread by Tarub’s enemies in court to discredit her, I think the biggest reason Ibn al-Qutiya included it is because it’s funny. A vast gap in time and experience separates us from the tenth century. Changes in cultural mores across more than a thousand years make it hard for us to react to material written then in the same way that the original audience was intended to. But I would suggest that when we as a modern audience laugh at the story of ʿAbd al-Rahman II’s nocturnal visitor, we are in fact responding exactly how Ibn al-Qutiya expected and hoped.\n\nOnly a tiny fraction of the writings that survive from Classical antiquity come to us on ancient papyrus (although that number looks to be about to increase). The words of ancient Greece and Rome instead travelled via Byzantium, the Caliphate and the Carolingian world. While that could be spread in the form of copies of complete works, Greco-Roman culture was also transmitted in fragments, sometimes in isolation, sometimes as direct quotation, and sometimes consumed and embedded within the written culture of the time. Much of our classical mythology comes to us in this digested form, never rediscovered simply because it was never entirely forgotten, even if it took on new shapes and purposes.\n\nOne of my favourite examples of this process in action comes from a note on the Muses in the margin of fol. 36v in Madrid Biblioteca Nacional, MS Vitr. 14–3. I’ll talk a bit more about what it is below, but first here’s a translation based on Juan Gil’s 2020 edition.\n\nInterrogatio et carmen de novem nominibus Musarum, ed. J. Gil, Scriptores Muzarabici saeculi VIII-XI CCCM 65B (Turnhout: Brepols, 2020), 1179-1180.\n\nQuestion: Where does the name ‘Muse’ come from?\n\nAnswer: There are said to be nine names for a Muse, because there are nine things through which the human voice is produced, that is, four teeth, the tongue, the two lips, the palate and the lungs. The names and their meanings are as follows: Clio (i.e. ‘thought’); Euterpe (gladly rejoicing); Melpomene (contemplation); Thalia, (captivating); Polyhymnia (making many memories); Erato (finding a likeness); Terpsichore (delighting in teaching); Urania (the heavenly); Calliope (the best-voiced). ‘Music’ is derived from ‘the Muses’, who were named from apu tu mason, that is ‘seeking’, because from them the power of song and the modulation of the voice are sought. Therefore, just as music is brought about by the nine Muses, so the human voice is produced by the aforesaid nine things, without which no one can speak correctly. Therefore the word ‘Muse’ comes from ‘seeking’.\n\nHere ends the question concerning the nine names of the Muses.\n\nBeginning of verses about those same Muses:\n\nFirst in order, Clio sings the histories of things.\n\nEuterpe the second gives a sweet strain to the pen.\n\nMelpomene the third brings the tragedians to floods of tears.\n\nThalia the fourth gives playful speech to comedians.\n\nPolyhymnia the fifth advances rhetorical meaning.\n\nThe sixth, singing Erato, composes metrical songs.\n\nTerpsichore the seventh gives melody to all lyres.\n\nUrania the eighth climbs the threshold of the heavens.\n\nCalliope the ninth wanders through all books of poetry.\n\nIn classical mythology the Muses were goddesses who provided artistic and philosophical inspiration. References to them appear as early as Hesiod and Homer (‘Tell me, Muse, of the man of many devices’), but it wasn’t until the Hellenistic period that their names, number and areas of responsibility began to be reasonably standardized. (Classics buffs may be looking askance at some of the attributions in the translation above. We’ll get to that below). Ancient poets regularly began their works by invoking the Muses for inspiration. As Christianity became a dominant part of late antique and early medieval culture, that proved increasingly controversial, with poets like Claudian (d. c. 404) and Avitus (d. 517×519) dropping them, while Prudentius (d. 405×413) and Venantius Fortunatus (d. 600×609) replaced them with Christ. Writing in southern England, Aldhelm (d. 709) devoted considerable verse to condemning the Muses altogether. They retained their poetic currency though, with the likes of Dracontius (d. c. 505) calling upon them in his Medea.\n\nEven without the addition we’re concerned with today, Madrid Biblioteca Nacional, MS Vitr. 14–3 is an interesting book. It’s a copy of the ubiquitous early medieval encyclopedia, the Etymologies of Isidore of Seville (d. 636), most likely produced at the end of the eighth or beginning of the ninth century somewhere in al-Andalus. Exactly where is unclear. It first appears in Toledo Cathedral in the eighteenth century, but it seems plausible that it had been there for some time. The betting money is that it was made further south, perhaps in or around Mérida, but that is far from certain. In any case, it is a fine reminder that Christian learning didn’t crash to a halt after the Muslim conquest of the Visigothic kingdom in 711.\n\nAlso fascinatingly, the manuscript is filled with short Arabic notes that seem to refer to the text. Although this could be evidence of a Muslim reader, there is plenty of evidence for Christians in medieval al-Andalus who were more comfortable in Arabic than Latin. Here I’m put in mind of the Latin-Arabic glossary contained in Leiden Cod. Or. 231 which, despite being produced in twelfth-century Toledo after the city had been conquered by Castile in 1085, explained Latin terms in Arabic. Interestingly some of these glosses were drawn from earlier Arabic glosses of Isidore’s work, which makes me wonder if Vitr. 14–3 was in Toledo by the twelfth century.\n\nOur little exposition on the Muses has been inserted into a blank space at the end of Book 4 of the Etymologies in the right column of fol. 36v. It is written in a Visigothic cursive that looks tenth-century to my admittedly inexpert eyes. Right from the off it’s a slightly weird text, comparing the nine Muses to the nine parts of the body necessary for speech. Leaving aside the implications that four teeth have for early medieval dentistry, we can identify the source of this analogy, which appears in the Mythologies of Fulgentius. In his great compendium of classical lore, Fulgentius numbered them with Apollo to make ten:\n\n(I.15) For the reason that there are ten organs of articulation for the human voice, whence Apollo is also depicted with a lyre of ten strings… Speech is produced with the four teeth, that is, the ones placed in front, against which the tongue strikes;…two lips like cymbals, suitably modulating the words; the tongue, like a plectrum as with some pliancy it shapes the breathing of the voice; the palate, the dome of which projects the sound; the throat tube, which provides a track for the breath as it is expelled; and the lungs, like a sack of air, exhaling and re-inhaling what is articulated.\n\nInterestingly, Fulgentius also turned to Biblical authority here, referring to the ten-stringed psaltery in Psalms.\n\nThe Mythologies circulated in late antique Spain so it is not surprising to see information from it in play here. The etymologies provided in the passage also came from Fulgentius. While he could cite Homer for Clio and Calliope, the origins of the others are decidedly dubious and probably made up by him, as were their roles. For him the Muses were stages of learning, each one building on the previous, beginning with Clio as the initial spur to thought. Calliope had particular significance for Fulgentius. She appears in the Prologue of the Mythologies, bringing him the knowledge that he shares in the work while engaging in increasingly flirtatious and erotically charged banter with him. (To be fair, Fulgentius is seductively quoting Virgil and Terence at her, which I think we can all agree is sexual dynamite.)\n\nThe next part of the passage, deriving music from Muse, and Muse from the Greek for ‘Searching’ comes from Isidore’s Etymologies (III.14). This is a garbling of a garbling. The word we have, ‘mason’, is meant to be Isidore’s μάσαι which itself is probably meant to be μώσθαι. The ultimate origin of this etymology is Plato’s Cratylus. Here Socrates engages in debate as to whether names express the fundamental essence of their subject or are merely the product of custom. Along the way he gets asked to explain the names of the gods, leading him to state that ‘the Muses and music in general are named, apparently, from μῶσθαι, searching, and philosophy (406a)’. Socrates (or rather Plato) is being decidedly playful in this section, and we probably shouldn’t take him particularly seriously. It’s thus possible that a moment of philosophical whimsy had become accidentally canonised by the time it reached our manuscript (although I’ve long suspected Isidore of having a sense of humour as well, so perhaps he also understood the tone).\n\nAlthough I haven’t been able to find an exact origin for the poem, it fits within a longer poetic tradition of praising the Muses. The closest Greek parallel is the anonymous poem 9.504 in the Palatine Anthology, which has the Muses with many of the same attributes in a different order. Latin variants circulated under the name of Cato, linked to the schoolbook tradition of the Dicta Catonis. As this latter connection suggests, simple poems about the Muses were often part of a school curriculum, imparting knowledge of the Classics with practice reading Latin. The Muses here act to transmit knowledge in a much more direct form than that anticipated by Fulgentius.\n\nAlthough the original bit of Isidore’s Etymologies on page of the manuscript on which this passage appears does not relate directly to the Muses, the heavy emphasis on the meaning of words means it fits in nicely even before we note the quoting of Isidore in the text. It’s not hard to see why a later scribe would think it was a sensible addition. It’s not the only place where apparently out of date information has been added to Vitr. 14–3. At the bottom of the final folio, 163v, someone in the tenth century added a list of Iberian episcopal sees from the pre-Conquest period.\n\nI love this passage because I think it offers a snapshot of how classical culture permeated the early medieval world. Brief snippets of lore from Greek philosophers and Latin clerics were stripped of context and then amalgamated to appear in forms more useable and accessible to Latin (and Arabic) reading audiences. The Muses may be best known for the sudden bursts of inspiration they grant, they great works that come from their blessings. But if she is anywhere, Clio is also here, in the corners of manuscripts, in the translating of tongues, and in the tiny accumulation of details which is how human beings communicate their past to their future.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please be upstanding for a solemn moment in Charter A Week.\n\nD Lo, no. 51 (986)\n\nIn the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity.\n\nLothar, by the gracious favour of divine clemency king of the Franks.\n\nIf We employ the firmness of Our benevolent defence for places destroyed at any time by the tyranny of the pagans through the restoration of estates given to the saints, We do not doubt – far from it – that this will be of benefit to the remedy of Our soul.\n\nWherefore let the industry of all the followers of God’s holy Church and Us, both present and also future, know that a certain abbot of the monastery of Sant Cugat, Odo by name, approaching the presence of Our Dignity, humbly beseeched Our Clemency that We might deign to confirm by a decree of Our regality all the goods of the monastery of Sant Cugat, which is sited in the place called Octavianum, eight miles distant from the city of Barcelona, which have been conceded or will be conceded in future; and this We did.\n\nAnd thus, We concede to the aforesaid abbey all the goods from the precepts of Our predecessors, to wit, Charlemagne and Louis [IV], Our father, and through the writings of others of Christ’s faithful We know to have been burned through the attacks of the pagans; and thus, as was said above, receiving the petition of the aforesaid abbot, We commanded a precept of renewal be made for the aforesaid abbey concerning all the goods pertaining to the same abbey in the present or to be conceded in future:\n\nIn the first place, the allod which is in the neighbourhood of the abbey, as the late Count Sunyer [of Barcelona?] conceded it and set out its borders; the estate of Cercitulus with its borders and adjacencies; the church of Sant Vincenç, which was founded there, with tithes and first-fruits; the valley which they call Gausach with all its adjacencies; the church of Sant Feliu which is at the estate of Vilamilans, with tithes and first-fruits; and in Ayguallonga and in Rubi and in Sardanyola and in Arabó and in their borders, houses, homesteads, gardens, meadows, pastures, vineyards, lands cultivated and uncultivated, separated piecemeal throughout various places; and the allod which belonged to Gotmar the priest; and the allod which they call Palau Auzit and the church of Sant Esteve in its borders with tithes and first-fruits; the allod which is next to Ripollet and around Montcada and in the valley of Mocosa and within the walls of the city of Barcelona and within the neighbourhood of the same city; next to the river Besós and next to the mountains which are above the gardens and above Agudell and next to the river Llobregat and next to the mount of Olorda and on both sides of the river Llobregat and next to the estate which they call Pallejá and next to the castle of Cervelló and next to the mount of Petrosus and up to the castle which they call Castelldefels, with houses, vineyards, lands cultivated and uncultivated, with tithes and first-fruits and mills; the castle which they call Castelldefels with the churches of Santa Maria and Sant Pere founded therein with their endowments; the church of Sant Llorenç and the mount which they call Sant Llorenç; and the church of Sant Esteve which is on the side of the same mountain; the allods which are within the borders of Tarrasa and Barbara and Castellar; and the allod of Toudell which the late Vunterd left there; and the church of the Holy Cross and of Santa Leda and of Sant Silvestre with their tithes and first-fruits, which Count Borrell [II of Barcelona] donated there; the estate of Santa Maria which they call Palantordera in the valley of Tordera; and Ricobert’s estate and that hill wholly and entirely; and the estate of Pinell with its borders; and the church of Santa Maria and Sant Esteve with tithes and first-fruits, without tribute, as Count Gauzfred [of Roussillon?] conceded it there through a writing of donation for the soul of his brother Sunyer the cleric, as he commanded him in his will; the valley which they call Vallgorguina with its borders and adjacencies; the allod which they call Tapiolas with the churches of Sant Genèst and Santa Eulàlia founded there, with tithes and first-fruits and their limits and borders;

and We concede tithes and first-fruits as the place has been accustomed to receive from ancient times, that it might receive, hold and without any opposition possess them; We permit them, that is, Abbot Odo and his other successors, to have everything, the allods which it has and holds in the county of Barcelona, Girona, Osona, Urgell and might be able to acquire hereafter through other writings, with their limits and borders, churches, houses, homesteads, gardens, lands cultivated and uncultivated, vineyards, meadows, pastures, woods, reed-beds, mills and ways in and out, with incomes and renders, that they might hold and possess them without any contradiction and defend them through Our name.\n\nWhence We ordered this precept of Our Highness be made and given to the aforesaid abbey of Sant Cugat, through which let them possess the aforesaid goods disturbed by no-one in perpetual right, such that no count, pontiff, or public judge should have power in the aforesaid goods to distrain or loose cases or carry out reckonings; or should anyone distrain any of their men, whether for murder or arson or rape or any business. And when abbots die, let the coenobites elect an abbot from amongst themselves in accordance with the Rule of the blessed Benedict.\n\nAnd that this largess of Our authority might be observe through times to come, We confirmed it below with Our own hand and We commanded it be sealed with Our signet.\n\nEnacted at the royal palace of Compiègne, in the year of the Incarnation of the Lord 987, in the 31st year of the reign of the most glorious King Lothar.\n\nSign of the most glorious King Lothar.\n\nI, Arnulf the notary, witnessed on behalf of lord Adalbero, archbishop and high chancellor.\n\nThis is the final surviving Carolingian diploma. Lauer, who edited it, dated it to 984. This is certainly wrong. In his edition of it for Catalunya Carolíngia, Ramon d’Abadal correctly put it in the early months of 986. Given that Lothar died in March 986 and that there are no surviving acts from Louis V’s sole reign, this means that this is the final act from the Carolingian dynasty which has come down to the twenty-first century.\n\nUnder the circumstances, this makes it a remarkably good antidote to teleology. None of the actors in this diploma knew that the Carolingians only had eighteen months or so left as kings. Indeed, quite the reverse: all the players here are gearing up to something really big. Abbot Odo of Sant Cugat is not here on his own initiative, but as an ambassador from Count Borrell II of Barcelona (and other places). The reason Borrell feels a need to send an ambassador to Lothar is that Barcelona has just died.\n\nFrom the late 970s, the de facto ruler of al-Andalus, al-Mansur, had been launching raids on his northern neighbours. In 985, though, he took and sacked Barcelona, a time which charters from the area referred to as die quod Barcinona interiit, ‘the day Barcelona died’. After a century or so where the Spanish March had been largely quiescent, this shocked both the magnates of the March and the West Frankish kings into action. Both Lothar and Louis V seem to have taken a role planning frontier defence, and a charter of 986 from Borrell refers to Louis issuing some instructions to help guard the March. For Borrell, royal authority was evidently not rotten: he expected to get some serious help from Compiègne when the chips were down.\n\nThere’s also a fun bit of diplomatic in the arenga. The preamble to this act is lightly modified from an act of Charles the Simple for Saint-Corneille de Compiègne (the bits in bold are shared between the two documents):\n\nIf We employ the firmness of Our benevolent defence for places burned at any time through the restoration of estates given to churches, We do not doubt – far from it – that this will be of benefit for the remedy of Our soul.\n\nIn Lothar’s act, rather than the serious fire that Compiègne had suffered in the 910s, the reference becomes to al-Mansur’s raid. This neatly combines an arenga which could not have been available to the beneficiary prior to their arrival at court combined with information which the beneficiary must have brought with them (i.e. the impact of the raid on the monastery). The combination of these two factors suggests collaboration between the royal draftsmen and the religious of Sant Cugat over the arenga’s content.\n\nThis thoughtful change is more important than it seems. If we imagine that drafting diplomas worked in a comparable way to composing liturgy, then we can imagine people putting together elements of older texts which, even if not tremendously explicit in their content, were made charged by their contexts. This in turn suggests a group of, if you like, diploma connoisseurs, people who thought about the textual composition of acts and could recognise the ends associated with them. Something like this has been argued to be the case for the elaborate diplomas of the reign of the English king Athelstan and his successors; but I think that mutatis mutandis such an in-group is present for most other charter-using circles as well. The significance of this is twofold: first, they can explain the acts to important outsiders (such as Abbot Odo); and second, legitimisation of rulers to themselves and their inner circles is one of the key jobs of acts of legitimation. I’ll leave the full explanation of this to Rodney Barker, from whence I got it; but here it’s fairly straightforward to explain: the only people who would ever see this act were Lothar and his circle, Odo of Sant Cugat and his entourage, and maybe a couple of other people whom Odo told about it back on the March. Consequently, it’s interesting that what this arenga does is to bring together the March and royal institutions in one single public text. Given the collaboration, it seems clear that Odo would have known that Sant Cugat was being described in almost exactly the same terms as an institution to which the king was very close. It was a small but significant written gesture as to how seriously Lothar was taking things, painting Sant Cugat in the same terms as Carlopolis. The aim here isn’t quite propaganda: it’s Lothar identifying himself with Sant Cugat and the March to himself and his allies, and in doing so reassuring Odo that help is coming.\n\nHelp, of course, never came. Instead, Lothar died, and after him his son Louis V. Next time, we’ll look at the first surviving Capetian diploma, and discuss what it shows about the very beginnings of Capetian rule.\n\nNo.\n\n[Ed.: Can we have a bit more here?]\n\nVery well, to elaborate…\n\nIn 1931, Francis W. Buckler proposed a new model for Carolingian relations with the Islamic world in a book entitled Harunu’l-Rashid [sic] and Charles the Great. He argued that the Carolingians and the ʿAbbasids entered a political and military alliance aimed at their shared enemies, the Umayyads of Muslim Spain and the Byzantine empire. For their part, Constantinople and Córdoba created their own counter-alliance against this threat. The resulting alliance system defined the Mediterranean in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. Buckler’s thesis was not received entirely without reservation. The eminent Carolingianist Ganshof condemned it in not one but two reviews, declaring it to be a ‘fantasy’ that he had read ‘avec stupeur’. That said, it has remained influential, largely because it provided a clear and easy to understand explanation for multiple generations of complex and unevenly sourced diplomatic activity which could be illustrated with pretty maps.\n\nIn my book (which I may have alluded to once or twice and is available at all good, average and downright disreputable bookshops) I sought to demolish the alliance system, concentrating on the ʿAbbasid-Carolingian end of this axis. If you want to find out how and why, read my book. But I paid less attention to the Byzantine-Umayyad bloc and why that doesn’t work either, so I thought I’d discuss that here today.\n\nThat the Umayyads and Byzantium might have been interested in each other is by no means implausible. I have talked before about the cultural exchanges that took place in the tenth century linked to the Materia Medica of Dioscorides. The idea of an alliance between Constantinople and Córdoba in the ninth century has one thing going for it that the Carolingian-Caliphate coalition doesn’t, which is some evidence indicating that this was a thing someone really contemplated at the time. The Andalusi historian Ibn Hayyan records that in 839/840 the Byzantine Emperor Theophilos (r. 829-842) sent Emir ʿAbd al-Rahman II (r. 822-852) a letter (borne in the account by a diplomat aptly named ‘Qurtiyyus’, pronounced rather like ‘courteous’). This missive proposed a military alliance against the ʿAbbasids and also asked the emir to do something about the Muslim pirates making a nuisance of themselves in the Mediterranean. Theophilos was under heavy pressure from Caliph al-Muʿtasim (r. 833-842) at the time. ʿAbbasid forces had sacked the city of Amorium in 838, something particularly embarrassing as it was where the imperial dynasty originally came from. The emperor was looking for an ally. He suggested to the emir that now was the time for him to reclaim the caliphal throne of his Umayyad ancestors.\n\nThis is pretty strong evidence as far as these things go, demonstrating some awareness in Constantinople as to who ʿAbd al-Rahman was and about his family’s history. However, note the complete absence of the Franks in any of this. The Carolingians make no appearance in the letter. Theophilos had good relations with the Franks and, equally, had no desire to pick a fight with them. This alliance is entirely aimed at the Caliphate and Mediterranean piracy. It’s also worth noting that this happened some years after the last recorded contact between the Carolingians and the ʿAbbasids, which took place in 831 when Caliph al-Maʿmun sent envoys to Louis the Pious. There is no report of Louis sending envoys back and it looks like their dealings ended there.\n\nMore importantly, part of the reason Ibn Hayyan took note of Theophilos’ letter was that it was unusual. The historian explicitly says that this was the first time a Byzantine emperor had ever proposed such an alliance. Theophilos was not trying to reactivate an old understanding but to forge something new. It therefore follows that there was no alliance between al-Andalus and the Byzantines during the period when the Carolingians were in communication with the Caliphate. Nor was any such agreement ever proposed with the Franks as one of the intended targets.\n\nThe other striking thing to note is that Theophilos’ letter wasn’t successful. ʿAbd al-Rahman II declined the Byzantine emperor’s proposal as impractical. The emir declared that his dynasty would be restored to the Caliphate by divine munificence. The last Umayyad of Córdoba who seems to have actively planned to challenge the ʿAbbasids in some capacity here was the first, ʿAbd al-Rahman I (r. 756-788), who had also had to fend off attempts to overthrow him sponsored by Baghdad. From then, relations between Córdoba and Baghdad seem to have largely consisted of abusive letters. The ʿAbbasids had problems holding North Africa west of Egypt, and the region was eventually largely surrendered in 800. To call al-Andalus a low priority from that point would only be to exaggerate its significance for the caliphs.\n\nThe reach of the Umayyads was even shorter, stretching unevenly over the Iberian Peninsula and occasionally across the Straits of Gibraltar. Even assuming that al-Andalus was quiet, an uncommon state of affairs, the chances of the emirs challenging the ʿAbbasids were miniscule at best. Until the viking attacks on Lisbon and Seville in 844, the Umayyads don’t seem to have had a fleet. ʿAbd al-Rahman II remarks on this point in his reply to Theophilos, noting that in the absence of Andalusi naval power Constantinople was in a stronger position to do something about Mediterranean piracy than Córdoba.\n\nLacking a fleet, any attempt to attack the ʿAbbasids from the Iberian Peninsula would involve a march along the African coast. Even before reaching ʿAbbasid Egypt, such an expedition would face difficulties. ʿAbd al-Rahman had good relations with the Banu Midrar of Sijilmasa, the emirate of Nakur and the Rustamid dynasty of Tahert, although even these allies might be unhappy about the prospect of an Umayyad army travelling through their lands. Further east matters got worse. Something of the relations between ʿAbd al-Rahman and the Aghlabids of modern Tunisia is suggested by the fact that in 842 the emir sent the Rustamid Imam 100,000 dirhams for sacking the Aghlabid capital.\n\nThere were therefore good reasons for ʿAbd al-Rahman to turn down Theophilos. There was no practical means for him to actively trouble Caliph al-Muʿtasim. Nor did the ʿAbbasid ruler present any immediate danger to Córdoba. Lest you feel too sorry for Theophilos, the Byzantines returned to the field of battle in 841 and a peace was signed that year with al-Muʿtasim as the ailing caliph turned to deal with plots within his capital. Neither emperor nor caliph would live to see the end of 842. Nor did this necessarily mean that the emir was opposed to contact with Constantinople. As mentioned above, the Umayyads were interested in Byzantine culture. The Andalusi poet al-Ghazal seems to have travelled to Constantinople with ʿAbd al-Rahman’s return embassy in 840 (the story that he approached the emperor on his back to avoid performing proskynesis is alas probably apocryphal). The group also contained a man carrying a clock, presumably as a gift. But there is no meaningful evidence for an Umayyad-Byzantine alliance against the Caliphate, let alone the Carolingians.\n\nWhat I find most interesting about all this is the number of modern studies that specifically cite Ibn Hayyan’s account of Theophilos’ letter as proof of a long-running anti-Carolingian coalition between Córdoba and Constantinople despite the fact that the actual text of the history disproves every element of that statement. I suspect this simply reflects the extent to which academics rely on previous scholarship. If you’re not especially interested in the diplomacy per se and just want to make a quick point on your way to an argument about something else, it makes sense to cite the previous literature and the sources that they draw upon. This is bad practice but a venial sin, and one that many excellent historians will occasionally commit. After all, building on the work of those who have gone before us is how the field progresses. Nonetheless, this is also how mistakes spread and become canonised.\n\nThis is particularly a problem with topics that cross over sub-disciplinary specialisms. In order to fully understand the issue with the Umayyad-Byzantine alliance you need to be familiar with both empires and their sources, those of the supposed rival ʿAbbasid-Carolingian axis as well as a wider Mediterranean and North African context. That’s hard to do and it becomes especially tempting to rely upon established interpretations. This is reinforced if you’re new to the material and coming from a different specialism. Old and somewhat dubious truisms in one sub-field can seem exciting and fresh in another. Further, if you feel insecure about your ability to analyse the new area of study, taking up the standard lines from that field is not just respectful but reassuring, allowing you to feel like you’re mastering this new material.\n\nWhat I hope I’ve gestured towards today are not just the challenges of early medieval diplomatic history, but also the value of reassessing apparently solved questions and paying attention to what our sources are actually telling us, rather than what we expect them to tell us.\n\nIn June 851 a Christian man named Isaac approached the chief qadi (judge) of Córdoba, asking to be instructed in Islam. Before too long however he had begun insulting the Prophet Muhammad. While the qadi initially assumed that Isaac was drunk, matters escalated when the latter continued his blasphemy. Not only was this a capital crime, but Isaac knew it, demanding that he be executed. His wish was granted. He would not be the last. There would be at least forty-eight of the Martyrs of Córdoba between then and 859. We know quite a lot about the martyrs. Sympathetic figures in Córdoba such as Eulogius (who would join their number in 859) and his friend Paul Alvar wrote extensively about the killings as they were happening. As I explore in my book, Charles the Bald was very interested in these events as well, so we have Frankish sources for the martyrs.\n\nWhat we don’t have is a Muslim perspective. To the best of my knowledge, we have no direct evidence for what these events appeared to Muslim onlookers beyond the accounts of Christians. These sources are by no means worthless, but the image they portray is inevitably limited. Looking elsewhere, I have found something that may offer a clue as to one way the martyrs may have been perceived. It comes in a collection of anecdotes about the qadis of Córdoba gathered by the jurist and alchemist al-Khushani (d. c. 981). Among the stories he gathered is one about Aslam b. ʿAbd al-ʿAziz (d. 929), during his first tenure as chief qadi of Córdoba in 912-921 (n.b.: this is my English translation of Ribera’s Spanish translation of the Arabic original):\n\nAl-Khushani, History of the Judges of Córdoba, ed. and trans. Julián Ribera (Madrid, 1914) pp. 231-233.\n\nI have heard that on one occasion a Christian appeared at the court asking for death for himself. Judge Aslam gave him a severe reprimand, saying:\n\n‘Wretched thing, who has put it into your head that you yourself ask for your own death, without having committed a crime?’\n\nThe foolishness or ignorance of Christians led them to attribute great merit to this action, of offering themselves to death, when nothing similar could be cited as an example, worthy of imitation, in the life of the prophet Jesus, son of Mary. The Christian responded:\n\n‘But does the judge think that if he kills me, that I will be the dead one?’\n\n‘Who then is the dead man?’ the judge replied.\n\n‘The dead person will be a likeness of me that has been put into a body; That semblance is the one that the judge will kill. As for me, I will immediately ascend to heaven.’\n\n‘Look,’ Aslam then said, ‘the one to whom you entrust yourself in these things is not here with me, and the one who could inform you well, to disabuse you of that falsehood, you do not have before you either; But here is a way to show what is true, and you and I can certify ourselves.’\n\n‘What do you mean?’ said the Christian.\n\nJudge Aslam turned to the executioners who were there and said:\n\n‘Bring the scourge.’\n\nHe then ordered the Christian to be stripped naked. They stripped him naked and he immediately ordered him to be beaten. When the Christian began to feel the effect of the whipping, he began to agitate and scream. Judge Aslam told him:\n\n‘On whose back do the blows fall?’\n\n‘On my back,’ replied the Christian.\n\n‘Well, man,’ Aslam told him, ‘the same thing would happen, fool, if the sword fell on your neck. Do you imagine something else could happen?’\n\nThere are some obvious problems with reading this as a straightforward account of what actually happened. Al-Khushani’s work is a collection of stories arranged around the lives of the qadis of Córdoba, gathered because they were amusing or noteworthy. It was put together in 968 at the earliest, almost half a century after the incident is supposed to have happened. Whereas elsewhere al-Khushani gives his source, here we are left with anonymous hearsay. Even if it does refer to something real, the dialogue has been tidied up to make a better story as it made the rounds of the legal circuit.\n\nThe other issue is that the Christian in the account does not sound remotely plausible as a would-be martyr. His claim that the man executed would be a semblance of him, rather than the real thing, has no obvious parallel to actual Christian thought and is naturally very much at odds with martyrology, where the sacrifice and death of the martyr is the central fact of the whole business. Julián Ribera suggests that he might be thinking of Qurʿan 4: 157-8, which denies that Jesus was crucified:\n\n(157) And [for] their saying, ‘Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of Allah.’ And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. (158) Rather, Allah raised him to Himself.\n\nThis fits what the Christian says in the dialogue quite neatly, suggesting that whoever told this story, whether al-Khushani or his source, was a Muslim with only a limited understanding of Christians.\n\nEven if the entire incident was made up in the 960s, it would still be interesting as one of our few sources for how Muslims in al-Andalus thought about Christians seeking martyrdom through state execution. But I suspect that it reflects a memory of a genuine encounter, even if the details have long since been lost. Wannabe Christian martyrs are not common figures in Arabic sources from Muslim Spain and they don’t appear as a recurring anxiety or concern. It seems to me that you would only write about them if they were actually a thing that happened, and that al-Khushani would have no particular reason to date it to the time of Judge Aslam unless that was approximately the time it happened.\n\nFurther, there are a couple of interesting other hints that something was happening around that time. Our only other account of a Christian seeking martyrdom in an Arabic source tells of a woman named Dhabba who told Aslam’s predecessor as qadi of Córdoba that Muhammad had deceived his followers. This incident and her subsequent execution took place in the chaotic last years of Emir ʿAbd Allah (r. 888-912), not long before Aslam’s supposed encounter. There are other references to martyrdoms in the early 920s, including that of Eugenia, who was apparently executed on the orders of ʿAbd al-Rahman III (r. 912-961) in 923, although the circumstances are unclear. This was very unusual but might provide a plausible context of a moment of particular tension in Christian-Muslim relations in which to place al-Khushani’s story. In light of this, I’m inclined to think that the broad outline of the story, in which Aslam was approached by a Christian seeking martyrdom but gave him a beating instead, might be true.\n\nThis incident is full of interest from multiple angles. On one level, it’s a nice illustration of the rougher end of Convivencia. The Muslim Judge Aslam has no desire to execute the Christian and finds a way to avoid doing so. At the same time, it’s an exchange in a legal environment where all the rules were written by Muslims, where a whipping is the gentle option and the choice to be relatively merciful is entirely in the hands of the qadi. Aslam was not only an Arab Muslim but was descended from a client of Caliph ʿUthman (r. 644-656), a member of one of the most powerful and illustrious houses in al-Andalus and educated in the finest legal schools in Egypt and Kairouan. That power was not always wielded for good, either: while Aslam seems to have had a reputation for honesty and fair dealing, his brother Hashim, in addition to advising Emir Muhammad I (r. 852-886), used his influence to amass a formidable real estate empire through not entirely savoury means. (Although later stories say that he would fall on hard times in his old age, having to practise alchemy to make a living, al-Khushani himself was a favourite of al-Hakam II (r. 961-976).)\n\nThe encounter also offers a hint that Christians in al-Andalus seeking martyrdom-by-judge was not a phenomenon confined to the 850s, but apparently took place in other, less well documented, years. That said, Judge Aslam seems somewhat nonplussed by the whole affair, which may be an indication that incidents like this were not particularly common. Eulogius and Paul Alvar seemed to think that the martyrs of the previous century were something special. We might hypothesise that the movement in the 850s were an unusually large and well-connected group of martyrs, but that other martyrdoms or attempted martyrdoms took place at different times, with a possible concentration between c. 910 and c. 923.\n\nAnother striking theme in the exchange is the role played by humour. The passage is clearly meant to be funny. Whatever actually happened at this event, the dialogue has been tidied up over the decades to make a faster, more entertaining story. Most of the tales gathered by al-Khushani are comical and we might imagine them circulating among judges. That said, humour was a desirable quality in a judge. From across the Islamic world, we find quick-witted qadis bantering with people involved in their cases or with the audience. In Córdoba, some could do so in multiple languages with members of multiple faiths. The ability to build a rapport with the room or shut down a heckler was clearly valued.\n\nFor all that the narrative is designed to make the entire episode look ludicrous, Aslam was dealing with a potentially dangerous situation. As the Umayyads had learned in the 850s, dead martyrs were if anything more troublesome than living blasphemers. Although considerable conversion to Islam had taken place, the majority of the population of al-Andalus were probably still Christian. There was never a good time to have religious unrest on the streets of the capital, but the early tenth century was a particularly sensitive moment. ʿAbd Allah’s power had barely stretched beyond his capital city. The early years of ʿAbd al-Rahman III were only slightly better.\n\nRoughly two days’ walk south from Córdoba lies the fortress of Bobastro, from where the Christian warlord ʿUmar b. Hafsun repeatedly menaced the Umayyads until his death in 917, building coalitions with other disaffected people across the Iberian Peninsula. Aslam’s defanging of this potential martyrdom by only using severe corporal punishment may have been a deliberate strategy to head off trouble down the pass. This may also explain the framing of the story as it comes to us, designed to make this potential martyrdom by making it look petulant and poorly thought-through.\n\nThis source offers a precious insight into a lack of insight. Although there are dangers to taking al-Khushani too straightforwardly, the account he presents is one in which would-be Christian martyrs are not just ridiculous but incomprehensible. More than that, his depiction of the Christian is so clearly shaped by Muslim ideas as to indicate that neither he nor his source had paid much attention to Christians at all. The story of Judge Aslam and the martyr tells us relatively little about the Christians of al-Andalus, but a great deal about the people who ruled them.\n\nIn the year 740, the governor of al-Andalus, ʿUqba ibn al-Hajjaj al-Saluli, led a large force north, heading towards Gaul, possibly in response to campaigning by Charles Martel in the Rhône valley the previous year. The army never reached the Pyrenees. At Zaragoza, the governor was informed that a major uprising had broken out in Africa and that he and his men were desperately needed elsewhere. The rebellion that ʿUqba and his troops turned south to face is known as the Berber Revolt. It is to my mind one of the most significant events of the early middle ages that most people working on early medieval Europe have never heard of. I’ve alluded to it before on this blog, but I thought it might be helpful to actually explain what the Berber Revolt was and why it was so notable. This is not going to be cutting edge research, but my best effort to summarise and explain a complicated but important series of events.\n\nThe power of the Umayyad Caliphate in the lands of the west, the Maghrib, depended upon the Berbers. The final fall of Carthage in 698 marked the end of the Byzantine presence in North Africa, but two decades earlier Muslim armies had already reached the Atlantic under the command of ʿUqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri, whose descendants, known as the Fihrids, would be central to the history of Ifriqiya. The peoples given the name ‘Berber’ or ‘foreigner’ by outsiders had defied the expansion of the Caliphate, most famously under the leadership of Queen al-Kahina. Her defeat in the first years of the eighth century marked the end of organised Berber resistance to the Umayyads and many submitted to the new conquerors and converted to Islam. Berber power allowed the Caliphate to expand its reach much deeper into North Africa than the Vandals or the Byzantines had been able to before them, stretching beyond the fertile lowlands of Ifriqiya (Tunisia, Libya and eastern Algeria) south and west, which were much less densely settled. Berber soldiers made up the vast bulk of the troops that conquered the Iberian Peninsula, with the initial invasion in 711 led by the Berber Tariq ibn Ziyad, after whom Gibraltar is named. They also took part in the siege of Constantinople in 717.\n\nTensions existed between Muslim Berbers and Caliphal officials. This was partly a consequence of the distinct forms of Islam that flourished in North Africa. Many Berbers became Sufri or Ibadi Kharijites. The first Kharijites had been followers of ʿAli (r. 656-661), the fourth caliph and Muhammad’s son-in-law, who had left him in disgust when he proved willing to negotiate with the Umayyad Muʿawiya I (r. 661-680) in 657. For the Kharijites, a righteous caliph fit to lead the entire Muslim community did not have to be either Qurayshi (like the Umayyad dynasty) or related to Muhammad (like the ʿAlids, who remained serious political contenders after ʿAli was killed; or the Umayyads’ supplanters as caliphs, the ʿAbbasids).\n\nMore importantly, Muslim Berbers were treated like a conquered people. Power was held by elite Arabs, who monopolised senior offices. Settlement patterns in North Africa suggest the imposition of Arab garrisons in fortified suburbs outside existing cities. In al-Andalus, Berbers seem to have been settled on less desirable agricultural land than their Arab counterparts. As Umayyad forces pushed further south into what is now Morocco, Berber leaders complained that they were placed in the most dangerous positions but received only a fraction of the booty, while their families back home were robbed and enslaved by Arabs.\n\nThe first hints of trouble emerged in 720, when the governor of Africa, Ibn Abi Muslim, was murdered by his Berber bodyguards after he began tattooing their hands as if they were slaves. Towards the start of the 730s, ʿUthman ibn Naïssa rebelled against Córdoba, allying with Duke Eudo of Aquitaine. The Chronicle of 756 states that he was motivated by the ill-treatment of his fellow Berbers in North Africa. In 734, the new governor, ʿUbayd Allah, under pressure from Damascus to raise revenue, began imposing on Muslim Berbers the jizya, a tax normally only levied from non-Muslims, while also demanding slaves as tribute from Berber communities.\n\nIn 739, ten Berber leaders were sent to discuss their grievances with Caliph Hisham (r. 724-743), but he refused to see them. The result, in 740, was the final explosion. One of the ten chiefs, Maysara al-Madghari, proclaimed himself caliph and seized Tangier. The fall of the city was, according to sources hostile to the revolt, accompanied by the brutal massacre and enslavement of its Arab population, as Berber frustration at their earlier poor treatment boiled over. Other Berber risings broke out across North Africa and al-Andalus. Maysara himself was quickly deposed and executed by his comrades, but his successors defeated the army dispatched by ʿUbayd Allah, killing the flower of the Ifriqiyan elite at the Battle of the Nobles late in the year. In 741, Caliph Hisham sent an enormous army recruited from Syria to crush the revolt under the command of Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qushayri. The highhanded behaviour of the Syrians, particularly Kulthum’s nephew, Balj ibn Bishr, led to conflict between them and the Ifriqiyans, before they were beaten by the Berbers in October at Bagdoura in central Morocco. Balj managed to lead a fighting retreat of some 10,000 of the Syrians, together with some of the Ifriqiyan Arabs led by the Fihrid ʿAbd al-Rahman ibn Habib, to Ceuta, where he hunkered down under a Berber blockade.\n\nAt the same time, Berber armies were on the move in al-Andalus, with forces marching on Toledo, Córdoba and the Straits. The governor, ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Qatan, had succeeded ʿUqba after his death in 740 from natural causes (a fate that was going to be in short supply). Seeing no other way to fend off the Berbers, Ibn Qatan ran the blockade and shipped the surviving Syrians from Ceuta to al-Andalus in early 742. The Syrians defeated the three Berber armies, but Balj betrayed and murdered Ibn Qatan. This prompted a revolt by the Andalusi Arabs led by Ibn Qatan’s son. Balj beat them at a battle outside Córdoba in August but died of his wounds in the aftermath of the battle, leading to a further round of chaos.\n\nMeanwhile in North Africa, multiple Berber armies penetrated into Ifriqiya proper, aiming for the capital city of Kairouan. In 742, fresh Umayyad forces drawn from Egypt and Cyrenaica and led by the new governor of North Africa, Hanzala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi, defeated them in a series of large and bloody battles in modern Tunisia, which left Ifriqiya in caliphal hands but most of Morocco under Berber control. Hanzala seems to have been aided by divisions between different Berber groups. After the fall of Maysara, the Miknasa Zenata confederation took the lead in the Revolt. Following the Battle of Bagdoura, other confederations, such as the Barghawata, seem to have concentrated on consolidating their position in Morocco. Following his victories, Hanzala sent his nephew to al-Andalus in early 743, where he appears to have been successful in taking control of the south of the province with the support of the Syrians.\n\nAt this point, some measure of stability seemed to have been achieved. Revolts continued to break out in Ifriqiya. But so long as money and soldiers kept coming from Damascus, Hanzala was able to keep a lid on things. The death of Hisham in 743 and then the assassination in 744 of his successor, the legendary poet and libertine al-Walid II (r. 743-744), jeopardised that flow. The ensuing civil war meant no one in the central Caliphate was paying a great deal of attention to affairs in the Maghrib.\n\nThe next wave of trouble was prompted by scions of the illustrious Arab Fihrid family which I mentioned above. In Tunis a revolt was led by ʿAbd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri in late 744, which forced Hanzala to abdicate and flee in early 745. As mentioned above, Ibn Habib had been with Balj’s Syrians; but he had turned against him when he killed Ibn Qatan. He would rule Ifriqiya independently until 755. Al-Andalus broke out into civil war, which finally ended when the governor of Narbonne, another Fihrid by the name of Yusuf ibn ʿAbd al-Rahman, seized control in 747. Although Berbers played a limited role in this second round of fighting, which was led by the descendants of Arab settlers, the brittle nature of Umayyad control in the Maghrib in 744 was a direct consequence of the Berber revolt.\n\nThe most obvious consequence of the Berber Revolt was the fragmentation of the Muslim Maghrib. No one would ever rule Ifriqiya, Morocco and al-Andalus at the same time ever again. In 762, the ʿAbbasids eventually succeeded in conquering Ifriqiya (which had been captured by Ibadi Kharijite Berbers in 757) but it required a monumental effort and their advance never extended beyond what is now eastern Algeria. The Umayyads would rule in al-Andalus again – but only in al-Andalus – when ʿAbd al-Rahman I ibn Muʿawiya (r. 756-788) defeated Yusuf al-Fihri in 756. Most diverse were the numerous polities that would emerge to the west of Ifriqiya, including the Barghawata confederacy on the Atlantic, the Sufri Kharijite Zenata emirates of Tlemcen and Sijilmasa, the Ibadi Kharijite Rustamid dynasty in Tahert from 761 and the Idrisids in Fes from 788. Not all of these were led by Berbers or Kharijites. But the polities that emerged in what is now Morocco in the eighth century provided a fascinating example of a multipolar Islamic world that was neither dominated (ethnically) by Arabs nor (ideologically) by the Early Medieval forebears of the tradition that we now call Sunni Islam.\n\nThe Berber Revolt had implications for the wider Caliphate as well. Something like the ʿAbbasid revolution was probably going to start whatever happened in the Maghrib. Black banners were raised in Khurasan in 747 largely as a consequence of local tensions which in many ways resemble those in the west, including resentment at unequal treatment. That said, the way those events played out were shaped by the Berber uprising. Defeats in the Maghrib undermined Umayyad authority. More directly, while we should be wary of all the numbers listed in the sources, the 30,000 Syrians allegedly sent west in 741 represented a large proportion of the field armies available to Damascus. These were elite troops who mostly never returned. While Marwan II (r. 744-750), the last Umayyad caliph, could put large hosts on the field, their quality and morale seems to have been fairly low. The Umayyads might well still have been overthrown, but the Berber revolt made it more likely by weakening the regime.\n\nFinally, the events that started in Tangier in 740 were of great significance for the rest of Western Europe. The previous two decades had seen multiple Muslim armies march north of the Pyrenees, and by 725 all of Septimania had been conquered. There had been notable reverses, such as the defeats at Toulouse in 721 and between Poitiers and Tours in 732/3. But southern Gaul remained under considerable pressure and ʿUqba al-Saluli was on the brink of another major expedition in 740. As a result of the Berber Revolt, that invasion was diverted and no subsequent ones were made. The Berber troops that had made previous incursions possible were no longer available and al-Andalus was in sustained political chaos that only really came to an end in the 770s when ʿAbd al-Rahman I crushed the last resistance in the south of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThis is not to say that without the Berber Revolt, Gaul and the rest of western Europe inevitably get conquered by the Caliphate (although I do think it makes it much less likely. No one saw 711 coming until it happened). Instead, I’d argue that the revolt provides the context for the Carolingian unification of the region. The years immediately after the death of Charles Martel in 741 were challenging ones. Pippin III (r. 741-769) and Carloman (r. 741-747) battled their half-brother Grifo, who had Bavarian backing. Duke Hunald I of Aquitaine (r. 735-745) invaded in 742 in support of an Alamannic revolt. The decision to make the Merovingian Childeric III (r. 743-751) king in 743 looks like a response to crisis. Fortunately for the Carolingians, these problems paled in comparison to the ones the Umayyads were facing in the Maghrib in precisely those years.\n\nRather than having to deal with an aggressive superpower willing to send armies into Gaul and to support rivals such as Maurontus in Provence and potentially the likes of Grifo and Hunald, the successors of Charles Martel had a quiet southern frontier that they could absorb piecemeal. In Provence, where Muslim armies had challenged Charles Martel’s conquest in 736, the Carolingians could secure their position. Rather than facing the full might of the Caliphate, in the 750s Pippin was able to isolate the Muslim garrisons in Septimania, leading to the final conquest of Narbonne in 759 and Roussillon in 760 by the Franks. This also provided the context in which Pippin and Charlemagne could slowly grind down the duchy of Aquitaine until the submission of Hunald II (r. 768-769) in 769, confident that no one else was going to interfere. Even after the civil wars in al-Andalus ended, the Umayyad emirate of Córdoba was a far smaller and less formidable prospect than the Caliphate.\n\nI’m not sure I could claim with a straight face ‘without Maysara, Charlemagne would be inconceivable.’ The real importance of the Berber Revolt lies in its impact on the Maghrib, which was enormous and justifies its study on its own. But the ripple effects both across the Mediterranean and over the Pyrenees mean I think it’s something of which early medievalists working beyond al-Andalus and North Africa should be aware.\n\nThere is a lot we don’t know about the battle in which ʿAbd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi died. We know that al-Ghafiqi was the governor of al-Andalus, leading a Muslim army into the lands of the Franks. We know that the Frankish army that defeated and killed him was led by Charles Martel (d. 741), Mayor of the Palace and the ancestor of the dynasty that would be called the Carolingians after him. But we don’t know where the encounter took place, except that it was somewhere on the road between Poitiers and Tours. As a consequence, the battle has been named after both cities, resulting in much confusion. Nor do we know for certain when the battle took place, with the traditional date of October 732 being open to challenge, as we shall see below.\n\nDespite all these known unknowns, an awful lot has been said about this battle. Popular books compiled by writers with more industry than knowledge list ‘The Battle of Tours (732)’ among ‘The Decisive Battles of World History’. Excitable commentators on the internet identify this as the moment where Western Civilisation was saved from Islam. Edward Gibbon’s teasing aside that the Qurʿan would now be taught in Oxford were it not for Martel’s victory is earnestly repeated by those not blessed with his sense of irony.\n\nThe most depressing response to the Battle of Tours is probably the activities of the French far-right anti-Arab terrorist outfit, Groupe Charles-Martel, in the 1970s and 80s. But the thing that most infuriates me about modern discussions of the battle itself are the details. A quick glance at the Wikipedia page will provide you with multiple sets of estimated numbers for armies. Heated debates have been held on the basis of not very much for where the battle must have taken place. Elaborate maps grace various sites, showing the manoeuvrings of cavalry forces and plotting out camps and last stands.\n\nGoing through all this, it struck me that there was an opportunity to do something helpful here, which is to provide an up-to-date set of translations for the major sources for the engagement. By the standards of eighth-century battles, the one in which al-Ghafiqi died actually has a lot of reasonably contemporary detailed sources. The bit before the comma is important. As discussed in the first paragraph, there are some huge holes in our knowledge of what happened. The body of evidence is small enough that Fraser and I could seriously contemplate translating all of the Latin sources in a couple of blog posts. Then, of course, things got out of hand, and we did all of them in one blog post. In doing so, we hope to make a little clearer what we do and don’t know about the Battle of Tours.\n\nFor the sake of readability, we’ve put the sources in the following document, which you can download and peruse at your lecture. Give it a read, and we’ll meet you below for the analysis…\n\nMen on the Edge: Eudo and Munnuza\n\nOne of the most interesting differences that appears in these accounts is the treatment of Eudo. Eudo was the duke who controlled Aquitaine for the first third of the eighth century. Although he has been claimed as an Aquitanian patriot, he should probably be thought of as one of several Frankish military leaders competing for power within the late Merovingian realms. As such, he was a major rival to Charles Martel. He won a victory over an invading Muslim force at Toulouse in 721, for which he was celebrated by Pope Gregory II. Eudo and his memory (he died in 740) remained very positive in some quarters – the Vita Pardulfi shows him as an heroic figure, even if not as a plaster saint – and appears to have presented a threat to the ascendant Carolingians.\n\nConsequently, it comes as little surprise to find that the Continuations depict Eudo as a traitor, shamefully breaking his agreement with Charles and then being humiliated by the latter. Per this account, Al-Ghafiqi’s invasion was prompted by Eudo inviting him in out of wounded pride, betraying the Frankish people. Given that the Continuations were written for Charles’ brother to be read by his son, we should probably be sceptical about this account, particularly when none of our other sources back up its narrative.\n\nThe most detailed alternative account comes from the Chronicle of 754. Here the story begins with Munnuza, or ʿUthman b. Naissa, a Berber leader who controlled the area of Cerdanya in modern Catalonia, right on the Frankish border. I’ve heavily abbreviated the chronicler’s description of ʿUthman, which is a shame because it’s a vivid if horrifying portrait of cruelty and depravity. According to the chronicler, ʿUthman became disaffected from the governor in Córdoba following news of the mistreatment of his fellow Berbers in North Africa. This is an interesting example of the growing tensions that would eventually explode in the Great Berber Revolt in 740, crippling the power of the Umayyad Caliphate in the west. ʿUthman’s agreement with Eudo makes sense in this context, giving both parties an ally. Over the following centuries, similar arrangements would be made by the likes of the Banu Qasi, who married into the ruling dynasty of the kingdom of Pamplona while doing business with Charles the Bald. It does seem to have backfired, if it prompted al-Ghafiqi to attack Aquitaine in order to punish him and discourage future Frankish meddling in Andalusi affairs (although previous governors hadn’t needed any particular excuse to attack Francia). In this reading, Eudo is a canny if somewhat weak politician, handing over his daughter to sate the lust of a monster in a bid for peace gone wrong. Although defeated in battle, his warning is crucial to bringing Charles and co. into the mix.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that this role is generally corroborated by the other Frankish sources which mention Eudo. The compiler of the Chronicle of Moissac, who elsewhere relied upon the Continuations for their narrative, here deliberately departed from them. By Paul the Deacon’s time, Eudo even gets to be a hero again. This is, as we said, clearly related to his confusion between the battle of Tours and that of Toulouse; but it nonetheless shows just how of its time the account of the Continuation of Fredegar is.\n\nDating the Battle\n\nThe traditional date of the Battle of Tours is 732, as found for instance in the Chronicle of Moissac. The Frankish annals are not generally to be sniffed at in terms of chronology. However, the Chronicle of 754 raises potential problems in this regard, as it says that al-Ghafiqi was governor for nearly three years, having been appointed in the Spanish era year 769 (AD 731) and the Hijri year 113, which started in March 731. If he took up the job in 731, then late 733 would be the earliest that the battle could reasonably have taken place and still be described as being nearly three years into his governorship. According to the Chronicle, his successor was appointed in AH 116, which started in February 734, but that might reflect the time it took for news to reach Damascus. As we have seen, Ibn ʿAbd al-Hakam, who is our earliest Arabic source for the battle, says it took place in AH 115, that is between February 733 and February 734. There is nothing in the Frankish sources to rule this out as we don’t really know much about what either Charles or Eudo were up to in 733. My rule of thumb for slightly later Carolingian-Andalusi relations is to trust the Frankish chronology over the Arabic sources, but those for the earlier eighth century are less reliable in that regard.\n\nHowever, the dating of the Chronicle of 754 has its own difficulties. Leo III reigned from March 717, so twelve and a half years after that would make the year ʿAbd al-Rahman became governor in 729, placing the battle in 732. However, the chronicler dated Leo’s accession to Spanish era 758 or AD 720, which would make ʿAbd al-Rahman governor in 732 and put the battle in 734/5. Likewise, Hisham reigned from January 724, so nine years later would be 733, and nearly three years after that 735/6. However, the chronicler dated Hisham’s accession to Spanish era 761 or AD 723, which would make ʿAbd al-Rahman governor in 732 again and put the battle in 734/5. This causes problems for using the other dates to place the battle in 733. It doesn’t help that in addition to saying Hisham became caliph in Spanish era 761, the chronicler also says this was the fifth year of Leo’s reign. All of this raises real questions about the reliability of the chronology of the Chronicle of 754.\n\nWith this in mind, my instinct here is to cautiously prefer a 732 dating, with the ginger tread of someone stepping on rotten wood.\n\nThe Battle\n\nElaborate descriptions of the battle of Tours have been written on the basis of these short accounts, so it’s worth beginning by saying what these sources don’t say. First of all, numbers. Only Paul the Deacon gives any numbers at all, but he is demonstrably confusing what he’s found in his sources. Otherwise, we have vague phrases like ‘great army’, suggesting the forces were substantial but not giving us any indication of the balance of forces involved beyond that. Similarly, the battle’s location is vague, although there are a few clues. The sources say that ʿAbd al-Rahman wanted to plunder Tours; they don’t say that he got very far. Indeed, the Chronicle of Moissac places the battle only a very short distance outside Poitiers, and the Vita Eucherii describes the Arabs as plundering ‘the province of Aquitaine’, implying they didn’t cross the Loire and probably that they didn’t come close.\n\nAs for the course of the battle, again we can say little and must be cautious. The Continuations have been used to argue that Charles Martel won the battle using cavalry. (J.M. Wallace-Hadrill’s somewhat overenthusiastic translation of the Continuations did not help in this regard). As our translation suggests, although the chronicler has Charles at the charge, there’s no particular sign of cavalry playing a leading role in the engagement.\n\nThe Chronicle of 754 indicates that the steady discipline of the Frankish battle line was the key element. There’s more than a hint of literary flourish about the chronicler’s depiction of northern Franks (fascinatingly described as Europeans, in a very unusual turn of phrase) fighting like frozen ice. Nonetheless, I think there might be something to this. Early Arabic descriptions of the Franks emphasise their iron discipline in a manner reminiscent enough of the chronicle’s description to make me wonder if the writer was drawing on the same stories which might have a kernel of truth to them. Beyond that, there’s little to say about the course of the battle. The Chronicle of 754 is the only indication of preliminary skirmishing. The other sources, if they can be read as imply anything, suggest by their descriptions of the speed and violence of Charles’ actions a surprise attack.\n\nAs for the bigger picture around the battle, the two of us have interpretations sufficiently different we’re going to split into our separate personas…\n\nFraser: It’s hard to see Tours as being anything special. Certainly, the pro-Carolingian sources do paint it as being a major triumph for Charles Martel, but it’s far from unique in that regard. The Continuation of Fredegar places the battle as part of a list encompassing Charles’ subjugation of the Alemannians, of Eudo of Aquitaine (i.e., the first part of the translated passage), and of the Burgundians. The military impact does not seem to have been huge. In general, the sources either imply or say explicitly that the Arabs made an orderly withdrawal after ʿAbd al Rahman’s death rather than being routed. Notably, the Vita Pardulfi indicates that they continued raiding activities on their way home. Similarly, Charles apparently did not feel it was either politically or militarily worth pursuing them. Both the Chronicle of 754 and the Vita Eucherii have him returning across the Loire immediately. Presumably, having given a slap-down to a raiding force (albeit a very large one which presented a significant tactical challenge) and taken their booty, nothing more was needed to deal with any threat they presented – which in turn implies the threat was far from existential or that the goal was anything more than plundering and burning. Indeed, if our sources are keen to emphasise anything about the victory it was the scale of the booty Charles captured. The main political outcome of the battle of Tours for contemporaries, it seems, was not that Charles Martel defended Franks, Christians, or Europe from some civilisation-ending disaster. It’s that he took enough bling off of some land pirates to be able to more effectively pursue his policies amongst the Late Merovingian elite.\n\nSam: I differ a little from Fraser on this. Both of us agree that al-Ghafiqi’s army had enough heft and organisation behind it to beat Eudo in the field and retreat in good order after being defeated and losing their commander. However, I think that this shows the Andalusi forces were enough of a strategic threat that we can’t necessarily rule out the possibility that al-Ghafiqi would have attempted to conquer Aquitaine and more if the dominos fell the right way. Barely two decades earlier the Iberian Peninsula had been conquered by a similar expedition winning a big battle fast. The early eighth-century Caliphate had a decidedly messianic flavour. While on balance this probably is just a slap-down raid designed to discourage Eudo from getting involved in Andalusi politics, such things have been known to snowball.\n\nPerhaps more important for our assessment of the Battle of Tours is the continuation of attacks on Gaul from al-Andalus after al-Ghafiqi’s death. Although Aquitaine itself seems to have been untroubled, Septimania and Provence continued to be overrun. By 735 Arles had been captured and Charles Martel spent a good chunk of the rest of the decade trying and failing to hold Avignon, Narbonne, Nîmes and Maguelonne. In 740, a planned major invasion of Gaul from al-Andalus, possibly aimed at Marseille, only halted at Zaragoza when news arrived of the Great Berber Revolt, which I think is the real reason the attacks stop.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat there are many more things we could say about the passages above is the reason we translated them. Much of this post has been destructive in nature, setting out the primary information with the express purpose of firing a ballista bolt into the elaborate descriptions and analyses of the battle that I routinely encounter in the popular press and online. But I have never been happy with demolition for its own sake. I hope that by making the main accounts of the Battle of Tours more easily available, I’ve shown the potential richness and intrigue of the sources. There’s a lot we don’t know about the battle in which ʿAbd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi died. The process of remedying that starts with the sources.\n\nIn February 2015 I had the profound pleasure of meeting a manuscript in Leiden University Library. Leiden Or. 289 is a large book, written in a lovely Arabic script and filled with gorgeous illustrations. Because I must be true to mine own self, I have included the page with a picture of an elephant in this post, but I would urge you all to scroll through the wonderful digitization here and gaze upon the squids, serpents and other animals present in the book. Most marvellous of all are the plants in all their varied forms and colours. This is the oldest surviving copy of the Arabic translation of the Materia Medica written by the Greek physician Dioscorides in the first century. As the name suggests, the Materia Medica is a pharmacopoeia, containing descriptions of plants and how they might be used to make medicine; although it is perhaps more accurate to say that the Materia Medica was the pharmacopoeia, celebrated and treasured for its contents both in classical antiquity and in the many centuries that followed.\n\nI had come to Leiden from England, but Or. 289 had travelled an awful lot further. It came to be possessed by the university upon the death in 1665 of Levinus Warner, ambassador on behalf of the Dutch Republic to the court of the Ottoman Sultan. Warner had studied oriental languages at Leiden, setting him on the path to Istanbul, where he amassed an extraordinary collection of nearly a thousand manuscripts, mostly Arabic, including the only manuscript of Ibn Hazm’s remarkable eleventh-century work on love, The Ring of the Dove. Something of the scale of his library is indicated by the time it took to transport all of it to Leiden – it wasn’t until 1675 that the last shipment arrived!\n\nBut the manuscript was made further afield still, in Samarkand (located in modern Uzbekistan) in 1083. The Materia Medica was first translated into Arabic in Baghdad in the mid-ninth century as part of the first wave of the great translation movement. The work was carried out by one Istifan son of Basil, supervised by the great translator, Hunayn b. Ishaq (d. 873). Hunayn was physician to Caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847-861) and was the author of several original medical tracts as well as the translator of a large amount of the Galenic corpus. The translation was not without its infelicities, and in 990 al-Natili completed a rewrite in Samarkand aimed at improving the Arabic, shortly before he travelled to Bukhara to tutor a child prodigy the western world would come to know as Avicenna. It is al-Natili’s version that appears in Or. 289.\n\nThe celebrated interest in classical knowledge that emerged in the medieval Islamic world had carried Dioscorides as far east as Transoxiana. It would also take him west. In 987, a physician living in Córdoba named Ibn Juljul completed a series of biographies of physicians. He includes a fascinating story about events in the reign of the reign of Caliph ʿAbd al-Rahman III (r. 912-961):\n\nArmanios, Emperor of Constantinople, sent him a message, I think it was in the year 948, and presented him with gifts of great value, including the book of Dioscorides, with pictures of herbs in the marvellous Roman style and written in the Greek language.\n\nThis passage raises potential chronological issues if we read Armanios as Romanos. In 948 the head emperor in Constantinople was Constantine VII (r. 913-959). His overbearing regent and father-in-law, Romanos I (r. 920-944), had been overthrown in 944. Constantine’s son, Romanos II (r. 945-963), was crowned as co-emperor in 945 but very much subordinate to his father. I don’t think this is a very big problem. Ibn Juljul was clearly a little uncertain about the date, so it seems plausible to me that it might have happened before the fall of Romanos I. Alternatively he may have recalled the year but misremembered the name of the emperor.\n\nSeveral examples of Byzantine copies of the Materia Medica survive, the most famous of which is the manuscript made for Anicia Juliana in 515 which now lives in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna as Codex Vindobonensis med. gr. 1. Why the emperor was communicating with ʿAbd al-Rahman is left unclear but not unexpected. Córdoba and Constantinople had had dealings together before. The previous century saw the Emperor Theophilos appeal to the caliph’s great-great-grandfather and namesake, ʿAbd al-Rahman II, for military assistance against pirates and Baghdad. Constantine VII refers to granting presents to foreign rulers in his De Administrando. The lushly illustrated medical manual spoke to Byzantine intellectual and cultural brilliance.\n\nNor was this the only book ʿAbd al-Rahman III received from Constantinople. He was also given a Latin copy of Orosius’ Seven Books of History Against the Pagans. This presented relatively few challenges for the caliph given the large number of Latin-reading Christians he could draw upon in Córdoba. The Greek Materia Medica was more of a problem. Returning to Ibn Juljul, the Emperor apparently noted that:\n\nDioscorides’ book cannot be utilized except with the help of a person who knows Greek well and is acquainted with the drugs concerned. If there is someone in your country equipped with the necessary knowledge, you will, O king, derive great profit from the book.\n\nAs it happened, the physicians of Córdoba were highly familiar with the Arabic Dioscorides. However, as al-Natili had noted, the ninth-century translation did have its disadvantages. As Ibn Juljul records:\n\nIstifan translated into Arabic those Greek names for which he knew an Arabic equivalent, while leaving in the Greek original those for which he did not know an Arabic term… Istifan trusted that he would be succeeded by others who would know the drugs for which he did not know a name and would name them in accordance with the state of knowledge at their time, so that the names would become generally known.\n\nFrom the fourth century the drugs in the Greek Materia Medica had been organised alphabetically, which may have encouraged Istifan’s caution, thus retaining the original structure of the text.\n\nThis meant that large sections of the Materia Medica were effectively unusable to an Arabic audience. The opportunity to correct this was not to be missed, but there was a problem, as there was no one in al-Andalus with the necessary Greek to interpret the Byzantine manuscript. Undeterred, ʿAbd al-Rahman asked the Emperor for a translator. One Nicholas the Monk was sent and arrived in 951. A team of physicians, led by the caliph’s powerful Jewish favourite, Hasdai b. Shaprut, and including in its later years Ibn Juljul himself, spent the next ten years working with Nicholas to explain ‘those obscure names of drugs’.\n\nThis Dioscoridic diaspora sheds interesting light on a couple of wider phenomena. One is the expansion of the cultural possibilities of the Arabic speaking world in the tenth century, as new hubs of learning emerged away from Baghdad in places like Isfahan, Cairo, Samarkand and Córdoba. Another is the importance of books and learning as gifts and statements of cultural power and superiority, and the significance of diplomacy as a means of moving ideas.\n\nBut the thing that I find most fascinating about the history of the Arabic Materia Medica is the way it illustrates translation as process rather than event. There was no single moment when the Arabic Dioscorides was fixed. Hunayn b. Ishaq himself is known to have tweaked, edited and expanded the translation he and Istifan produced. People like al-Natili, Nicholas and Hasdai b. Shaprut reworked it. Ibn Juljul himself produced an epitome of the work. And Leiden Or. 289 itself shows signs of further work, including a note dated to 1116 where another scribe announces his intention to translate the manuscript into the superior language of Persian. This continued labour is a mark not of failure, but of success.\n\nAny book, whether scholarly or literary, dies when the last word is said on it. Those that matter, those that live on, are translated and retranslated, chewed over, abbreviated, expanded, torn to shreds and misinterpreted. In the people they gather around them to conduct this work, they create worlds. Dioscorides exists as a phantom in the space between his words and his readers, drawing sustenance from their engagement even as they remake him in their own image. His sincerest admirers are not those like me, who gaze mutely in awe at the pages Or. 289, but those who pick up the pen and return to the conversation he took part in.\n\nA palm tree stands in the middle of Rusafa\n\nBorn in the West, far from the land of palms\n\nI said to it, ‘How like me you are, far away and in exile!\n\nIn long separation from family and friends\n\nYou have sprung from soil in which you are a stranger\n\nAnd I, like you, am far away from home\n\nMay dawn’s clouds water you, streaming from the heavens in a grateful downpour.\n\nTrans. D. Fairchild Ruggles, Gardens, Landscape, and Vision in the Palaces of Islamic Spain (University Park PA, 2006), 42.\n\nThese words are attributed to ʿAbd al-Rahman b. Muʿawiya, the first Umayyad Emir of al-Andalus (r. 756-788). ʿAbd al-Rahman was born in 731 in Palmyra, the city of palms, the grandson of the reigning Caliph, Hisham (r. 724-743). His comfortable life was shattered when his family was overthrown by the ʿAbbasids in 750, forcing him to flee west. After several desperate years in exile in North Africa, in 756 ʿAbd al-Rahman landed in al-Andalus and proclaimed himself its emir, ruling in defiance of both the ʿAbbasid Caliphs and numerous rivals within the Iberian Peninsula. In the midst of fighting for his throne and for his life, ʿAbd al-Rahman found the time to build a palace three kilometers north-west of his capital at Córdoba. He named it Rusafa, after the palace of the same name in Syria where he grew up as a child, which served as a model for the new residence.\n\nThere are serious problems with the poem’s attribution. It first appears in Ibn ʿIdhari’s fourteenth-century history of the Maghreb, written in Marrakesh. It also closely resembles a poem attributed to ʿAbd al-Rahman’s nephew and fellow Syrian refugee, ʿAbd al-Malik al-Marwani. These both argue against ʿAbd al-Rahman being the actual author. Reconstructing what the gardens of Rusafa in Andalusia looked like is also difficult. The palace was burned down by Berber troops in 1010 and never rebuilt. Most of our descriptions of them come from Ibn Saʿid in the thirteenth century. Excavations of Rusafa in Syria have revealed a cross-axially planned garden in four parts with a central pavilion, which might have been copied by ʿAbd al-Rahman.\n\nThe gardens of Rusafa may be beyond our reach, but the story of ʿAbd al-Rahman and the palm tree fits within a wider range of narratives associating the Umayyads with plants from the East. Rusafa was celebrated for the exotic flora of its gardens. The tenth-century historian al-Khushani writes that ʿAbd al-Rahman’s sister refused to travel to al-Andalus because she was too old. In her place, she sent him marvellous pomegranates. Although they spoiled before they reached Córdoba, the emir distributed them among his followers, before successfully planting the seeds in Rusafa.\n\nʿAbd al-Rahman’s heirs would heavily emphasise both their specific descent from the Umayyad caliphs of Damascus and their general Arab ethnic identity. Genealogies of the family stressed their male ancestors, rather than their female ones, who were often Berber or from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Many of the Umayyads were naturally blond. ʿAbd al-Rahman III (r. 912-961) is said to have darkened his hair in order to look more Arab. The Umayyads also made a point of patronizing cultural figures from elsewhere in the Caliphate, most famously the singer-songwriter (and general polymath) Ziryab at the court of ʿAbd al-Rahman II (r. 822-852).\n\nStories like that of the palm tree of Rusafa acted as a reminder of the Emirs’ Umayyad and Arab lineage. But they also had meaning for a wider Andalusi elite, many of whom also claimed a Syrian Arab heritage, if sometimes on rather dubious genealogical grounds. Like the Umayyads, many were of mixed descent. Although there were Berbers and descendants of Gothic converts to Islam in high places at court and the administration, they risked being sneered at by their Arab counterparts, who sought to police access to power and patronage by (unfairly) questioning their grasp of Arabic language and culture. Prominent families in al-Andalus often looked for wives in the Caliphate to reinvigorate their ties with the homeland. In the self-conception of the Arab elites, the story of al-Andalus was the story of their migration to the Iberian Peninsula, the same journey made by the palm tree. They could be read as the descendants of the men with whom ʿAbd al-Rahman shared his pomegranates.\n\nThe association between Arabs and palm trees could also be used in polemic by those opposed to the former. In the 1050s, Ibn Gharsiya (d. 1084), a Muslim poet of Basque origin, wrote a treatise attacking the arrogance of the Arabs and asserting the superiority of his own ancestors. He compared the employment of his noble forebears with those of the Arabs, claiming that the latter were:\n\nNot camel herders or diggers tilling the soil; great kings, not burners of camel dung for fuel… These non-Arabs were warriors, not guardians of palm branches or planters of palm shoots.\n\nTrans. J.T. Monroe, The Shuʿūbiyya in al-Andalus: The Risāla of Ibn García and Five Refutations (Berkeley, 1970), 25.\n\nMoving with gritted teeth past Ibn Gharsiya’s baffling antipathy to camels, we can see here further confirmation of the importance of palm trees in defining what it meant to be an Arab in al-Andalus.\n\nIn this context, the poem attributed to ʿAbd al-Rahman forms part of a wider pattern of writing, in which the history of al-Andalus was shaped around the migration of Arabs to the Iberian Peninsula, claiming the landscape by filling it with their plants, while retaining their identity through these distinctive reminders of their distant geographical origins. On palm trees, and Umayyad self-presentation, and the expression of Arab identity, there is much more to be said, but if I have not been able to plant a full garden before you, I hope at least that you have been pleased by this single tree.\n\nThe Chronicle of Alfonso III tells of a battle that took place in 859 at Albelda in northeastern Spain. Here King Ordoño I of Asturias (r. 850-869) defeated the Muslim border lord Musa b. Musa, a man so powerful that according to the Chronicle he named himself ‘the third king of Spain.’ I first encountered this passage as an undergrad at the University of York in the summer of 2011. I was working on my dissertation, which was about the vikings in the Iberian Peninsula. This had drawn my attention to Musa, who played a prominent role in fighting Scandinavian raiders when they arrived in al-Andalus, and of whose wider career I wanted to get a better sense. But what caught me when I read about the battle of Albelda was the account of the aftermath, as the Asturians plundered Musa’s baggage train. There they found ‘gifts, which Charles, king of the Franks, had sent’. The question of why a Muslim border lord should have been the recipient of gifts from Charles the Bald (r. 840-877) fascinated me and I decided I needed to find out the answer.\n\nA journey started for me that day twelve years ago, one that will end when my book, The Emperor and the Elephant: Christians and Muslims in the Age of Charlemagne comes out with Princeton University Press in a little under two weeks’ time on 11 July (American readers will have to wait until 26 September). In that book you’ll find out why Musa was campaigning with Carolingian presents, along with a lot of other things, like why the Prophet Muhammad only sent good-looking diplomats, how Charlemagne (r. 769-814) accidentally started a revolution in North Africa and how to use architecture as a method of assassination, as well as sundry musings on the significance of giant ants for historical causation. There may even be an elephant. (There will definitely be an elephant).\n\n(If any or all of that sounds tempting to you, my book is available for pre-order for the low, low price of £35.00/$39.95. You can also read the first chapter for free at the link.)\n\nThis is not quite the end of my work on the Carolingians and the Islamic world. I currently have three works-in-progress in one form or another that relate to the subject. But the moment when I transition from someone who is writing a book about Carolingian diplomacy with the Islamic world to someone who has written one seems as good a place to mark an ending as any. And while most of me is simply appalled at the fact that almost every event in my life since the summer of 2011 have been shaped by my encounter with Musa b. Musa’s baggage train, it occurs to me that now is a chance to talk about why I wrote this book, and what I hope to achieve by doing so.\n\nThe first thing I want to communicate in this book is that Carolingian monarchs talked to all sorts of different Muslim rulers. Multiple generations of ʿAbbasid caliphs and Carolingian royals sent and received ambassadors who travelled the often-dangerous routes between Francia and Mesopotamia, chancing themselves against disease, storms and pirates along the way. The Umayyads of al-Andalus and the Carolingians were the two greatest powers of western Europe, and a merry cast of calculating warlords, vengeful Frankish counts and messianic prophets made a living in the complicated and shifting diplomatic space that lay in between them. Charlemagne kept close tabs on affairs in northern Africa, receiving visitors from the courts of the Maghrib and attempting to spread his influence there. Further, it should surprise us when we find places where such contacts were not made, as in southern Italy, and we should try to find an explanation for these cases.\n\nThe second point is that these connections mattered. Harun al-Rashid (r.786-809) gave Charlemagne expensive and hard to replace gifts. Charlemagne risked the lives of trusted and important agents in his communication with the Caliph. Both parties sank major resources into diplomatic contact with each other because they were important. This significance was even greater in the Iberian Peninsula. Córdoba and Aachen were dangerous to each other in ways that none of their other neighbours were. Their Great Game over the Pyrenees could easily draw blood. Both Umayyads and Carolingians paid close attention to rebels and dissidents within each other’s"
