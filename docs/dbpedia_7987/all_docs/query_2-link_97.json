        "text": "Irrfan and Deepika Padukone worked for the first time in Piku. It went on to win several awards in India and international film festivals, including three National Film Awards. Amitabh Bachchan won the National Film Award for Best Actor, Juhi Chaturvedi won for Best Original Screenplay and Best Dialogues.\n\nSharing her apprehensions about working with Irrfan, Deepika had said in a 2015 interview with PTI, \"I thought he would be an intense actor, an intense person, everything about him is intense, courtesy media’s perception. I thought he would be stern and not interact and look down upon me thinking me being a commercial heroine. But he is very different from that.\"\n\nShe had added, “He is humorous. There are similarities between us like he is also shy… He talks less but when he says, it is very funny. I think his comic timing is pretty untapped. And no amount of explanation can give justice to the fine talent that he is.”\n\nIrrfan went on to become Deepika's ‘favourite person’, who had attended the promotional event of her Hollywood debut film, XXX: Return of Xander Cage. Reacting to his death in 2020, Deepika shared a blank post on Instagram with a heartbroken emoji.\n\nIrrfan had won a National Film Award and was the recipient of the Padma Shri. He had delivered several critically-acclaimed films including Academy Award winning films Slumdog Millionaire and Life of Pi, Salaam Bombay!, Life in a... Metro, Maqbool, Paan Singh Tomar, Piku, The Lunchbox, Haider and Hindi Medium are some of his most celebrated films."
