        "text": "Juhi Chaturvedi: So far usually I give a working title first and then usually I write towards that. Not for it being the title but just to help me ensure that eventually the film is about this particular thing. My working phase title is actually pretty different than from what it eventually becomes. And Vicky Donor was not calledVicky Donor at the beginning. The first ever title was, I think Father’s Day or something like that, and then in fact someone in the AD team, he came up with this idea. There’s a guy called Tushar, he came up with Vicky Donor. So, once the script is given to the team everybody sort of thinks about it and then whoever can come up with something...it’s a pretty democratic way of coming up with a title because you as a writer might be so deep into the script that sometimes you might just lose the objective of what the title must say.\n\nI think of a working title more to help me through my writing phase. So, I choose my title for that phase. So, if it works out, fine. Piku was Piku right from the beginning and it was about Piku, and I was writing towards that only. So, that will never change and it worked well for the film too.\n\nFor October it wasn’t called October, it was Wide Awake. , So, everything that I was writing was just to ensure that this thought process remains in his mind, that for him she is awake. So, everything he was doing was as if he was doing fora person who is listening to him, who is aware of him. But Shoojit came up with this title October and the moment he suggested it sat perfectly well because the film was about the feel of October, about these flowers, about… because you know it’s neither hot or cold neither living nor dead. You know, about that space of existence that you are but you are not, October seems to be that little bridge. And so that’s how October came and that’s what Shoojit suggested.\n\nJuhi Chaturvedi: I was born and brought up and studied and went to college and everything in Lucknow, so I’m from Lucknow. I am like a hardcore Lucknowite. So, for me love for Lucknow is.. it is instrumental, that city is instrumental in whoever I am today, my entire thought process. And I have grown up there so I think Lucknow for me is a person. I was in fact thinking in my mind that I’m working for the second time with Mr Bachchan, for the second time with Ayushmann. Sixth time say on a feature with Shoojit, of course I have been working with him for like 2003 onwards but this is the first time I am working with Lucknow. So I feel Lucknow is a person, it is very difficult to describe that because it’s just in the bloodstream."
