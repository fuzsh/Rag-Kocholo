        "meta_description": "Read this exciting story from The New Indian Express Chennai June 13, 2020. The Hindi word for heed is &lsquo;tavajjo&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s what Mirza (Amitabh Bachchan) claims not to pay Baankey (Ayushmann Khurrana), his tenant of many years. He&rsquo;s lying, of course. In the opening shot of Gulabo Sitabo, we see him steal a bulb from outside Baankey&rsquo;s door. The habit recurs throughout the film: Mirza&rsquo;s thievery a daily annoyance for the residents of Fatima Mahal, a derelict mansion in Lucknow. Even so, the slight against Baankey feels markedly personal, an impulse born not just out of greed, but a fierce rivalry.",
