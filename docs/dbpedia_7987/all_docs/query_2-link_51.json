        "text": "It was the 3 S effect that got me going and doing this eccentric character movie called Piku, the story, script by Juhi Chaturvedi and Shoojit Sircar of whose I have now become a fan of the way he approaches the nuances of a character and conjures the whole fictional world around him, the way he did in Vicky Donor. More than my character a certain oddity and peculiar, highly hypochondriac, unusually potty-obsessed Bengali called Bhashkor Banerjee and his quiet but cussed daughter Piku who go on a road trip from Delhi to Calcutta with an utterly bewildered yet straight-faced driver (nay, cab owner) Rana for company, what I really liked about this whole film was the treatment given to these characters.\n\nI have a strong believer in making the character come alive on the screen for the audience and this is exactly what I have seen many directors miss out on completely in fmy our score and more experience years that I’ve spent in this film industry except for these new age directors these days who really research a character and then come on the set to shoot and make a worthwile movie for audience to watch and take something pure and precious back with them which every movie promises in its trailer but then sadly fails to deliver.\n\nBut Piku didn’t fail, it succeeded mightily, I might add in this exact expectation. For example, the Ramakrishna Paramhans and Sarada Devi photos by the door that Piku bows to each time she leaves home or the laddoos from Sand­ila in Hardoi, where Rana comes from, this movie has an eye for detail, a way with words, with real-life dialogues: “Ice cream khaoge?” “Khaane ke liye hi to laya tha.” Now where would you hear such a testy conversation except within the confines of your home sweet home? And haven’t we all always had this battle of wits between our paternal and maternal sides? This movie is indeed an engaging film of and about our humdrum lives. It’s about the chaos of relationships, yet about unruffled continuities. It’s about how parents and kids can embarrass and exasperate yet stick around and feel responsible for each other. It’s about the argumentative families that pick on any little thing to quarrel about.\n\n“‘Na’ sirf ek shabd nahi… apne aap mein pura vakya hai. Ise kisi tark, spashtikaran, explanation ya vyakhya ki jaroorat nahi hoti” and “Hamare yaha ghadi ki sui, character decide karti hai.” These two dialogues in the whole script are basically what wrenched, tugged and pulled my heart in doing this now a highly admired and commendable movie.\n\nThen came the plot of the movie based on these two dialogues which while narrating the film to me I loved how the director Aniruddha Roy Chaudhary and Producer Shoojit Sircar delivered to me that they are not interested in passing on this message, this revelation in a subtle manner but the entire force of a sledgehammer, which they eventually did in the monologue about the power of ‘No’ which I am proud to say that I did it in one go without any retakes and rehearsals and I love the fact that the audience nationwide irrespective of age, gender and wisdom listened to it with awe and respect.\n\nAnd then I loved my character Deepak Sehgal, once a lawyer of repute, now retired who takes care of his sick and elderly wife at home but comes out of his retirement and takes this case of these three young, professional, independent girls living in New Delhi. What I also like is how my character has this certain formidable presence and this moral piercing gaze in the whole movie. Truly, it is a wonderful, well-rounded, well-written character.\n\nFinally, what I really feel great about this movie is that it is an stinging indictment of the deeply-set prejudices, unmistakable misogyny, misplaced male entitlement (which is rife and rampant in India) and a cold, cynical depiction of the outright injustice that women across the nation must contend with on a daily basis everywhere particularly so when protesting against unwanted sexual attention that is prevalent and embedded in the underbelly of our Indian society."
