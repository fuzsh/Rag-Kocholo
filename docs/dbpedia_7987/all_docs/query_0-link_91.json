        "text": "Bollywood's blue-eyed boy Ayushmann Khurrana has been on a roll since last year, with some stellar box office hits. With just two releases in 2018, and their critical as well as commercial success, Ayushmann not only proved his mettle as an actor but also reclaimed his spot as one of B-town's most promising young stars.\n\nCut to 2019, and the 'Andhadhun' actor has some really quirky and exciting projects lined up for release throughout the year. Check out more about Ayushmann's 5 upcoming movies in a year here:\n\n1. Article 15\n\nHelmed by Anubhav Sinha, the movie will be based on Article 15 of the Indian Constitution, which prohibits discrimination of citizens on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Ayushmann plays a police officer in the film.\n\n2. Dream Girl\n\nEkta Kapoor's romantic-comedy drama, 'Dream Girl', will see Ayushmann portraying the role of a man with a golden voice - one who can sing in both male and female voices. The film stars Nushrat Barucha opposite Ayushmann.\n\n3. Gulabo Sitabo\n\nWritten by Juhi Chaturvedi of 'Piku' and 'Vicky Donor' fame, and helmed by Shoojit Sarkar, this one is going to be an interesting family comedy which also stars Amitabh Bachchan in a prominent role. Part of the film will be shot in Lucknow, where it is reportedly set.\n\n4. Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan\n\nSet to be helmed by Aanand L Rai, 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' is expected to be a coming-of-age gay love story about how a conservative family comes to terms with the fact of being gay.\n\n5. Bala\n\nIn this Dinesh Vijan production, Ayushmann will once again be seen sharing the screen with Bhumi Pednekar and Yami Gautam. Ayushmann is set to essay the role of a man who suffers from premature balding and how he deals with it."
