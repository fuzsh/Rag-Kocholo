        "text": "Shoojit Sircar brings out a simple, meagre, story of the big fat melancholy of great human survival. It’s not even a story infact, it is just few daily unimportant, insignificant characters going on with their irritating cacophony of routine and petty existence – for absolutely nothing but just surviving for a day and knowing not what happens tomorrow. This is the out-of-focus segment of society which is so easily ignored, so easily trampled upon and so easily exploited. They do not revolt against their exploitation but they revolt, they struggle, they quarrel amongst themselves and they go to sleep to revolt, to struggle and quarrel the next day again. Their lives are of no value whatsoever and they live as parasites upon the stumbling bricks of falling down buildings which are beyond repair – they are beyond repair.\n\nThis is close to being a morality tale, but it isn’t because here Greed is not a sin – it is a way of life. Yes, greed doesn’t work out at the end but neither do their lives without that greed for surviving one more day. They aren’t at fault, they just are lost and no one is bothered to find them unless they have something to offer – in this case the “Haveli” of Mirza’s (Amitabh Bachchan) Begum where people like Baankey (Ayushmann Khurana) live as tenants – paying (and not paying) just thirty rupees a month. The Begum loves her Haveli, Mirza loves only the money (very insignificant amount of that) and Baankey loves just to be indifferent, effortless, motive-less, aimless.\n\nThis is Lucknow and they are the antidotes to the city known for the Nawabs. They are nothing short of insects who fly around, buzz around, irritate and perish without being noticed. There is absolutely nothing of grandeur, respect or in the most serious of accusations – love. The characters are so overwhelmingly petty and hapless that as an audience, even you don’t feel the urge to sympathise with them. We laugh them off like we laugh at the “puppets” (The name Gulabo Sitabo comes from the famous puppet show, infact).\n\nWe see the corruption, the ugly and the exploitation of the classes which are above these people. They look at them as opportunities – the Haveli is a treasure island for the archeological department, the local promoter, the minister. The Haveli is life for Begum who refuses to die. The Haveli is existence for Mirza who stoops down to levels of stealing the bells from cycles, bulbs from doors for 2-3 coins. The Haveli is home for these tenants who don’t know where to go if the Haveli fails to exist. Shoojit Sircar with Juhi Chaturvedi visits the underbelly but removes the foul odor. This is a story of two sides – one which shows the nuisances of the daily humdrum of these characters and the other which shows how the educated, powerful, bossy sections of the society easily take these people for granted, for sell. In one of the dark humour scenes, Baankey asks Mirza “wo Begum ki kursi aap kitne pe bechey thhey?” – Mirza says 250. The scene cuts to a highly posh city antique shop where that “kursi” is on sale for Rs 1,50,000. Whom are you laughing at?\n\nWhat would have happened to Indian Cinema if Amitabh Bachchan didn’t happen to India. Ecstasy, delight, bliss, euphoria. How dare can I write about him, I have no authority. He leaves no room. There are times where you want to slap Mirza so hard, at others you forgive him. At times you laugh at him, at times you belittle him. At times he embarasses you, at times you pity him. How can an actor put in so many traits of a character’s lifetime into 2 hours of screen time where the character becomes immortal. The mannerisms, the presence, the dialect, the acting. How can you do this, Sir? Please be forever with us, and if there is anything called the rebirth, please be ours the next time too and for all the times, thereafter.\n\nAyushmann Khuranna is wonderful. He didn’t have to do much because he is so much an actor of this mould that from the moment you see him in this attire you trust him, you believe in him to take you all along and perhaps even you team up with him. Flawless. Maybe small towns in India will soon have statues of him.\n\nThere is a scene where Baankey finds out that Mirza has slyly stolen of his bed sheets and as he snatches it away from Mirza, Mirza says something like “haan ley jao lekin tumhe pata nahi ki hum kitne paadey hai uske upar…” – absurdly nonsensical – so very delightful.\n\nNot going into the exhausting list of the casting – every one of them is fantastic. These people like Vijaay Raaz, Brijendra Kala are as if born for character roles. They are side-artists par excellence. But I would like to spend a line or two on the songs – the lyrics – how hauntingly true they are, yet have an uncanny joy in them. Shantanu Moitra has done so well in mixing the pathetic condition of these characters to some strange beats and honest lines.\n\nAnd my word, the camera work. Poetry in motion. The film takes out time for the shots. The last few moments show the empty Haveli, the sun-kissed roads of unimportant Lucknow and the use of so-ordinary colour palettes never lets the film even think of leaving the roots. The last scene where a street puppet show is being performed about Gulabo Sitabo and Mirza walks past with a balloon in hand is one of the best images that I have seen in Indian Cinema (with the context, ofcourse).\n\nWhat happens inevitably to these plot lines is, they become a bit dragged, stretched out. There will be scenes which you won’t want to watch with all your attention and that is the story itself – the characters deserve no attention and kudos to Sircar and his team as they fight against the ordinary to make Gulabo Sitabo quietly but surely slip into the list of some of the most extraordinary films ever made about “nothing” important."
