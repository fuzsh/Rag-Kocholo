        "text": "Dear CPS, CYS, and all their business alleys: The blissful naïveté of the pup in this video, that “mommy protects me”, and the fierce mom’s protection towards him, are all divine and power of nature, they’re a foundation to a healthy child that grows to build a healthy world, and when ignorant humans like you destroy that power of God for their own agenda, for their superficial understanding of human relations, for their “dislike of the mother”, a quota to meet, or a single mother that looks like an easy prey, then that’s a crime under legal cover, a crime that kills spirits and leaves shells of humans that breathe but are dead inside, that’s a disturbance of divine energy for the mere pleasure of soul-less humans like you, just because you can. You pulled the warm cover off millions of blissfully naive children, you broke the Godly fiercful mothers’ protection, and you left them cold and weak, you faced innocent children with the harsh reality that they are alone in an ugly world, that mommy can’t protect them, you allowed their childish fears to run wild with all scary scenarios in a time they’re not equipped with self-defense mechanisms as an adult would be, they were eaten alive by the demons in their little heads, but hey who cares? By the end of the day you showed someone who’s boss and you made it up for all the years you were bullied in school or by your superiors, you felt you belong to the powerful people now, you felt like the winning bullies, you showed the world that “you can”, like a Mafia can show the world that they can, that they deserve to be feared, the fear we humans have for a mindless wild beast in the jungle… It’s the same fear, but humanity is gone. Dears, you know those kids that you destroyed and killed their innocence? The ones you left crippled, mentally and emotionally impaired, enough that you felt their words lost its credibility, so you can keep your evil between you and them, you also stamped your court proceedings with “confidential”, because in secrets evil thrive, in secrets YOU thrive! But the day will come in which your victims will be heard, they will be seen, and they will expose all the crimes you committed, crimes that are as ugly and destructive as war crimes, you can tell yourself you’re “just doing your job”, but you know who else “just did their job”? The Nazis did, Isis did, and every God damn criminal who plead allegiance to a blood- thirsty cesspool of humans did! When the day comes and your children ask why is the world the way it is and why their country is becoming a huge mental ward, I hope you will be brave enough to tell them you were a part of that, but bravery is not a word you know, otherwise you would’ve not chosen to bully defenseless children, you would’ve not killed their blissful naivety, you would’ve not touched the only manifested pieces of God’s-love on Earth with your evil hands! But you did, and you will never stop doing, because evil will never die, and YOU.ARE.EVIL…\n\nStumbled upon a great post today that got me thinking - we've all got a real-life superhero. We're talking about mothers - tireless, selfless, protective warriors. Their love, an unyielding shield around us. Their sacrifices, a testament to enduring commitment. These unsung, walking, living, breathing superheroes have indeed, given us life. But they've done so much more. They've moulded our character, shaped our thinking, and instilled in us values that stand us in good stead. So, what happens when we step out into the world, particularly into our workplaces, where this protective shield isn't as tangible? Suddenly, we're callously exposed to stress, deadlines, expectations, and pressure. A little piece of this nurturing world we're so accustomed to, seems missing. This absence often is the root of discontent, stress, and reduced productivity at work. So how do we combat this? Let's draw from the wellspring of female energy that has anchored us through life so far. Channel the protective maternal energy - bring empathy to the boardroom, nurture your professional relationships, safeguard your team's well-being, and encourage an emotionally healthy work culture. For by doing so, we create workplaces that are not just about ruthless competition and reaching targets. Instead, we foster an environment that while challenging, is also nurturing and uplifting. Remember, we're the sum total of our experiences and upbringing. Let's bring this to our workplaces for a more balanced, empathetic professional world. #emotinalwellbeing #balance"
