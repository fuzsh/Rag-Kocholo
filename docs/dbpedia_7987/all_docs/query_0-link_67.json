        "text": "Exclusive! Amitabh Bachchan looks almost unrecognisable in Gulabo Sitabo\n\nAmitabh Bachchan’s look in the film, which is currently being shot at Mahmoodabad House in Lucknow’s Qaiserbagh\n\nAmitabh Bachchan is nearly unrecognisable as a landlord to Ayushmann Khurrana’s tenant in Shoojit Sircar’s next\n\nMirror was the first to report (May 15) that Shoojit Sircar has brought Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana together for his next directorial, a quirky comedy titled Gulabo Sitabo. Written by Juhi Chaturvedi, the film went on the floors in Lucknow on Wednesday with the Big B shooting for his portions. Before joining the crew in the Uttar Pradesh capital, he had teased fans with a Twitter post, saying, “From Lucknow today Gulabo Sitabo and the look? Well, what can I say...(sic).”\n\nNow, we have got hold of the 76-yearold actor’s avatar in the film. With a long beard, spectacles, a head scarf and a prosthetically-pronounced nose, Bachchan looks unrecognisable as a grumpy old man from the City of Nawabs. Bachchan plays the character of a landlord to Ayushmann’s tenant in the comedy. According to a source close to the development, this is another high-on-prosthetics look for the Big B after Paa, and 102 Not Out. “When Shoojit showed him the look sketch, he was excited to work on the film, taking it on as a new challenge. He is required to sit down with the make-up team for hours before starting the shoot. An international crew has come on board to work on the appearance,” the source added.\n\nThe Big B had arrived in Lucknow on Monday. “On Tuesday, he had gone to see the location and did a recce of the site and started shooting for his portions on Wednesday. Most of the filming will take place in the old parts of the city,” the source shared.\n\nRonnie Lahiri, who is producing the film with Sheel Kumar, told Mirror that they are eyeing an April 24, 2020 release. “Ayushmann will join the team shortly (once he finishes another upcoming film, Bala). It’s a start-to-finish schedule and will end in August,” he added.\n\nWhile explaining the origin of his new film’s title, Shoojit had earlier (May 15) told Mirror that it is a colloquial term used in Lucknow. “Regarding its association with the story… you will have to wait and watch the film to know more,” the director had said.\n\nAfter wrapping up the comic caper in August, Shoojit moves on to his Udham Singh biopic with Vicky Kaushal. The second schedule begins in October, and the four-month outdoor shoot will take place in Russia, the United Kingdom, Europe and North India.\n\nBachchan and Shoojit have previously collaborated on Piku, which had featured him as the 70-year-old Bhashkor, who suffers from chronic constipation."
