        "text": "At the outset, SIR appears to be an unconventional story about the romance that blossoms between ASHWIN -a wealthy Architect and his housemaid -RATNA. But dig deeper, peel off the gloss of the class, and you will realise that the textures and ethos of romance have always been the same -oblivious to and transcending social, economical, physical and other constructs.\n\nThe journey is from platonic to romantic, unrequited to requited. Sometimes, unconditional and sometimes unspoken!\n\nPLOT:\n\nThe plot underlining doesn’t come until the 3/4th of the movie. However, the implicit-obvious kicks in right from the 6th minute, the moment we see both of them together in the same frame for the first time in the movie.\n\nWhat follows is the occasional pleasantries, daily chores, compassion towards each other and then there’s a lot of silence. It’s platonic! But in our hearts, we know!\n\nAshwin is healing from a broken engagement and his housemaid Ratna is a widow.\n\nHe has quit his writing aspirations, his US life and joined his dad in the construction business ( I don’t know the nitty-gritty).\n\nShe is shuttling between her maid job and 2-4 tailoring classes, trying to wing her Fashion Designer dreams. Yes, she knows the word!\n\nEven Ashwin frowns upon hearing the word, but it’s only because he is surprised. She reprimands, but then from him comes the much-needed reassurance – ‘Everyone is entitled to dream’.\n\nWe know that Ashwin is considerate. His dad doesn’t want him to go green at the cost of the business ending up in red. We see him walking by the construction workers’ sheds. (wrongly labelled as the ‘labour camp’ by the art department). And since we know he is empathetic, we foresee his inclination towards her.\n\nShe stitches a shirt for him and gifts him on his birthday. Her mind knows that he wouldn’t appreciate it, but in her heart she believes and hopes that he would. And when he chooses to wear it! Well.. that certainly painted a wide big smile on my face!\n\nPERFORMANCES:\n\nThe heart of ‘SIR’ lies in its protagonists, who are alien in each other’s world. And the magic of it lies in the way the actors have not only managed to ‘look’ the characters, but also eat, speak and breathe like ones.\n\nThis without any deliberate attempt to paint any of the worlds in superior or inferior colours, but the by-product of their immersive performances has only upped the contrast.\n\nVivek Gomber playing ASHWIN has sophistication ingrained and Tillotama Shome playing Ratna has delicate nuances imbibed. The way she severs the thread after finishing stitching or chooses to sit on the kitchen floor for her food doesn’t appear to be a conscious play. It’s because of this, we begin to believe in them as characters.\n\nAnd once we believe and invest in characters, rooting for them is inevitable.\n\nMy eyes were moist every other minute – sometimes out of sadness, but many other times because the sweet smile permeated.\n\nRohena Gera is the director and has kept it all simple. And this simplicity has made it more real and the romance sweeter than the sugar-coated Bollywood romance.\n\nThere is no complicated writing, but the conflicts and social commentaries are strong enough.\n\nPersonally, ‘SIR’ has been one of the most satisfying and beautiful romantic movies in the past few years (along with October). After all, there is a thing about the words unspoken!\n\n-CHAN\n\nPS: A special shout out to a couple of moments, where things were kept off-screen (like the climax line), and it only added to the emotional value of the moment.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe word ‘success’ is a relative term that comes with varied definitions. For a teacher it could be helping her students pass an exam, for a farmer it could be that first crop of the season, for a poor father it could be educating their kids and for ‘Murad’ it’s rapping his way to break all shackles.\n\nThe tagline ‘Apna Time aayega’ resonates with the emotions of every aspirant out there and it’s no surprise that the song has turned into a new anthem of success.\n\nWhat’s in the story?\n\nGully boy is your rags-to-RAPS-to-riches. It’s the traditional story of an underdog making his way to the top, that has been encompassed in mumbai’s underbelly. I must admit that the ghettos have never been painted so beautifully on screen.\n\nWe have Ranveer as ‘Murad’, who has a thing for writing and an ear for rap. Murad’s father is a driver who curtails his son’s ambitions to roti-kapda-makhaan, for he thinks that reaching for the skies is a thing cut out for the privileged.\n\nThe audacious Safeena (Alia Bhat) is his love interest. Her antics supply the doses of humor to make us laugh and smile. And her affection supplies the much needed dose of life to murad.\n\nWinging his dreams is MC Sher – another rapper from the by-lanes of mumbai, who has earned his own bunch of followers. When the underconfident Murad meets Sher, the former discovers his definition of success.\n\nSher provides rhythm to Murad’s rich poetry and turns him into a rapper – GULLY BOY.\n\nGULLY BOY battling his socio-economics and winning the coveted ‘rap contest title’ forms the crux of the story.\n\nDESI HIP-HOP\n\nHip-hop has been an evolving subculture in certain parts of the country. Underground rappers must have been an unheard thing for most of us, until DIVINE and NAEZY rose to certain prominence.\n\nWhile the movie isn’t their biopic, it has certainly taken a leaf or few from the lives.\n\nZOYA AKTHAR\n\nFamiliarising us with an alien tradition, weaving an underdog story out of it and still making us root for the protagonist is perhaps the biggest win of Zoya and her fellow writer Reema Kagti.\n\nThe ghettos of mumbai isn’t a new destination on the maps of Indian cinema. But offering a new visual perspective to it, perhaps, has added to the movie viewing experience. It looks familiar yet new, beautiful yet real.\n\nMontages is Zoya’s forte. Her montages supply powerful photographs of human emotions.\n\nAnd replicating her style in ZNMD, she has made a wise use of her father’s poetry skills – giving us poems filled with worldly wisdom.\n\nRANVEER, ALIA, MC SHER AND THE ENSEMBLE CAST\n\nWe all know that Ranveer is a capsule of volcanic-energy. Burying his off-screen persona behind that baby-innocent face, he pulls of a restrained performance that could be labelled as ‘tremendous’.\n\nIn Dil Dhadakne do, he was a rich-kid with a lost voice and in here is a lower middle class guy with a similar conflict. Reflecting melancholy in his eyes throughout the movie, he is endearing as ever. This movie is a valuable addition to his short filmography that boasts of diverse and memorable roles.\n\nSimilar thing could be written about Alia. In here, she churns out those giggles, brings out those smiles while playing the second fiddle to Murad.\n\nCamouflaging herself into every character that she plays can’t just be tagged as ‘talent’. There’s a lot of hard work that she puts in there.\n\nSiddhant Chaturvedi as MC sher picks your attention. He stays with you for his effortless performance and because of the beautiful way in which his character has been written.\n\nThe cast that also includes his friends Mohin, father Vijay Raaza and his mother other among others, is one of the best cast ensemble in recent past.\n\nNOT JUST ANOTHER MUSIC-MELODY-FEST\n\nA movie about an aspiring musician is bound to be loaded with umpteen songs and this movie is no exception.\n\nBut what Zoya has certainly done right, is preserving the historical essence of hip-hop culture. The songs reflect on the socio-economic problems and comes across as a channel to vent out personal frustration. And every rap provides a powerful commentary relevant in present times.\n\nMusic has been composed by wide range of musicians, mostly hip-hop rappers. ‘Mere Gully mein’ the original song by DIVINE and NAEZY, has been reprised with similar visuals. May it was the director’s way of paying them a tribute.\n\nI particularly loved the way the background score leans towards classical music in the later part of the second half, culminating in to the beautiful ‘train song’ 🙂\n\n‘Apna Time Aayega’ led to whistles and cheers in my screen.\n\nWHAT ‘I FELT’ COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER\n\nSomething that was seen in all her movies – ‘Luck By Chance’, ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’, ‘Dil Dhadakne Do’ and now ‘Gully Boy’. Her obsession with ‘keeping it all tidy’.\n\nIt wouldn’t bother us when we watch a glossy ghetto in foreign movies, but while watching a desi one, may be keeping it a little more rustic would have helped us get soaked in the lower-middle class life. Owing to this fact, his socio-economic problems ‘appeared’ like first-world problems, in spite of being important. (or maybe it was only me)\n\nIn her segment of ‘Lust Story’, the platform for empathy was beautifully laid out ‘visually’. In here heavy banking has been done on the performances and the writing.\n\nAlso the musical life of Murad rarely sees a failure, except for his first underground rap battle. In the rest other parts of the movie – It’s an upward curve. May be planting few more failures would have added to the emotional quotient.\n\nThe forced twist in the auditions – MC Sher’s eviction and Murad’s selection were two distinct and powerful emotions.\n\nI don’t know if it was the execution, editing or writing, but neither the sympathy for MC Sher’s eviction nor the empathy for Murad’s success reached its emotional fulfillment. There was an emotional confusion.\n\nWell as they say, nitpicking is a lot easier job then going out there and shooting your own movie. But my tiny little complaints shouldn’t take away the glory of the movie.\n\nTHE FINAL WORD\n\n‘Gully Boy’ is a beautifully packaged movie with traditional narrative but impeccable performances accompanied by powerful music.\n\nUnderstanding the prose of the rap would be an additional take away, but the underlying story of ‘rags to riches’ is a formula that always works.\n\nIf you have an ambitious person in you, go hit the theatres. And while ‘Apna time aayega’ plays, root of the underdog ‘Murad’ and the underdog in ‘you’.\n\nPS: Movies like this should be watched without an interval to savor its beauty.\n\n-Chan\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThere’s something beautiful about unfulfilled love stories! It’s poignant but strings together those “could and would have-s”, filling your heart with beautiful imagination.\n\nThe romance in 96 is not unrequited, yet it’s filled with things unspoken.\n\nA boy – Ramachandran ‘RAAM’ and a girl – Jaanaki ‘JAANU’ in their early teens, fall in love – through silent glances and words unsaid. Circumstances bring an abrupt end to their short-lived romance that had blossomed in silence.\n\nNow they meet again, after 22 long years, in a school reunion. The female is married, but the guy isn’t.\n\nWill the silence continue to prevail but with a lot of awkwardness or will they burst into tears at the sight of each other or will the romance from the past be rekindled?\n\n96 brings forth a beautiful love story that we may have experienced in parts, witnessed in our neighborhood or watched umpteen times in movies like “autograph” or “before sunset”.\n\nYet, as they say ‘a thing of beauty is a joy forever”. We couldn’t be bored because we have seen it all before. Except for a stretched later part of second half, 96 is filled with moments that make you smile, turn teary eyed, grow nostalgic and root for the protagonists.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nWHAT WORKS FOR THE MOVIE 96?\n\n– The riveting narrative that cuts between the present, past, perspectives, “could haves” and supplies us with the doses of 90’s nostalgia.\n\n– “Those-eyes-say-it-all” performances from Vijay Sethupathi and Trisha. While Trisha battles her inner pain with a tranquil smile, Sethupathi handles it with his anxiety, nervousness and sometimes as JAANU terms it – “being an innocent school kid”.\n\nHowever hard they try, their eyes can’t help but show a tinge of melancholy. And this makes us long for their togetherness.\n\nA special mention should go to the actors who have played the young “JAANU” and “RAAM”. It’s because of the way they have established the chemistry between the characters, that we begin to root for the present them.\n\n– MUSIC – When the team had first released the teaser, the score Kaathalae Kaathalae had given us the testimony of the magic that would be in store.\n\nI am not a person who buys the thought of “goosebumps moment”. But in the movie when Trisha first walks in, the score “Kaathalae” takes off and it was enough to break my ego and put my hair strands into exercise.\n\nGovind Menon’s score furnishes varied emotions that resonates with the mood and amplifies it, in mesmerizing fashion.\n\n– The debutant Prem Kumar ‘s direction that is devoid of the traditional technique of melodrama. This maturity is perhaps the greatest strength of the movie.\n\nIf you Scout through, you would get enough moments that would demand one. But the director has found resort in keeping it real, keeping it silent and sometimes even bypassing the background score. All these, without lowering the emotional quotient.\n\nI can even remember those few moments, when the sound design transitions into deep silence, but only to enhance the mood.\n\n*************************************************************\n\nMy tiny little complaint about the movie would be about its editing – Well this is a subjective thought. There were many moments where I was yearning to look at RAAM and see what he is going through. Because RAAM he is a bundle of emotions. But the editor had opted to play it completely on JAANU, whose emotions we know already.\n\nEven the second half of the second half appears a little stretched, might leave a few audience in restless state.\n\n***************************************************************\n\nBOTTOM-LINE\n\nPrem Kumar has given us a beautiful romantic drama that is devoid of melodrama and proves us the fact that “old school” love stories are still relevant and if done right, can cast magic.\n\nVijay Sethupathi continues to choose his roles right and Trisha returns to the screen with the charm that makes us fall in love with her – all over again.\n\n96 should be your go-to movie this weekend, if you have a thing for romantic stories.\n\nPS: My Awe for the movie could also be because of my nostalgia.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt was 2013. The release of Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani had marked the 3rd straight successful year for Ranbir Kapoor – commercially and critically.\n\nThe previous 2 years had seen him sweeping major awards, including consecutive Filmfares for Rockstar and Barfi. Both the movies had earned great returns, with the latter breaching the coveted 100Cr mark.\n\nYJHD was his 10th movie and it went onto become one of the highest grossing Indian movies. Ranbir catapulted himself into the league of bankable stars. He was touted as the next big superstar of India. He was living his dream.\n\n……..and then came the slump.\n\n2013, the year that had witnessed his most successful film also marked the beginning of his losing streak –Besharam, Roy, Bombay Velvet (lost around 60 -80crores) and Tamasha. Films continued to fail, year after year. Producers lost whopping amount.\n\nAe Dil Hai Mushkil came as a relief, but then came Jagga Jasoos, for which Ranbir had turned a producer. Jagga lost around 40 -60Crores at BO.\n\nWhen you see Ranbir Kapoor in his recent interviews, you can’t help but notice the melancholy in his eyes. Is it melancholy or is it the metamorphosis that he has underwent while reprising the role of Sanjay Dutt in Sanju?\n\nDutt’s life is filled with unbelievable tales of ups and downs, where he has hit more troughs than peaks. Did Ranbir take a leaf from Dutt’s life?\n\n***************************************************************************\n\nWhat is SANJU – the movie all about?\n\nIt’s the tale of Sanjay Dutt – son of famed Sunil Dutt and Nargis. It’s a tale of his tryst with drug addiction and his fight against it. It’s the tale of a man who was charged under TADA act for his role in Mumbai Serial Blasts case and his acquittal. It’s about a man who was jailed under the ‘Arms Act’ and served 1400 odd days in prison.\n\nAbove all, it’s a tale of a father, who stood by his son in all his hardships. When the movie ends, whom do you fall in love with? Ranbir as Sanju or Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt?\n\n***************************************************************************\n\nRANBIR as SANJU\n\nIn a career spanning over 11 years, Ranbir has largely played similar roles – a man in his soul searching journey. That makes Sanju a tailor made role for Ranbir. It’s his comfort zone.\n\nHowever, the role has brought in its own baggage of hurdles and challenges.\n\nWhen you are acting in a biopic, irrespective of the magnitude of your role – lead or just a supporting cast, you are bound to invite comparisons. The challenge intensifies, when you are reprising the role of someone living.\n\nSanjay Dutt is a star who has acted in over 150 movies. We have seen him through years – young, old, in his teen cheeks and in his silver beard. Hence, our subconscious continues to draw comparisons. There was always a danger of loss of ‘empathy’ for the protagonist, because the mind is too busy playing the game of comparison.\n\nHowever, Ranbir hasn’t blindly tried to ape Sanjay, rather he has transformed himself into Sanju. He has picked few mannerisms that look more implicit than explicit imitation.\n\nAs a result, barring few segments, we live the experience of Sanju – the character and not Sanjay Dutt on whom the character is based on. That’s where Ranbir’s success lies. He becomes increasingly convincing. He makes us cry, he makes us laugh. He makes us cringe and gets us upset. He earns the empathy of the audience that lasts until the credit list rolls.\n\nSanju is not only the redemption of Sanjay Dutt, but also of Ranbir. He has regained his lost sublime form. The film is not only going to set the cash registers ringing, but will also fill his drawing room with few more awards. He is back into business.\n\n(With the much hyped ‘Brahmastra’ on cards, he could be the next superstar that everyone wanted him to be)\n\nParesh Rawal has played the second fiddle, rather beautifully, making us fall in love with the endearing and much revered Sunil Dutt. (After watching the movie, I ended up spending few hours reading about him)\n\nVicky Kaushal’s would be another noteworthy performance.\n\n***************************************************************************\n\nRAJKUMAR HIRANI – The man with the Midas touch\n\n5 movies in 14 years looks a strained effort. It’s the fact that all of them have been blockbusters, which transforms the stats into an enviable track record. Sanju is looking in all good shape to extend his blockbuster streak.\n\nHe along with his writing companion – Abhijat Joshi, has retained their entertainment formula. Every scene should either make audience laugh their lungs out or make them empty their tears (joyous tears most of the times).\n\nHirani movies don’t exist in real plane. It exists in a dramatic space – filled with larger than life characters that look more real than fiction.\n\nDespite being a biopic, he does no different in Sanju. The real characters look larger than life, yet so real. There are places where you feel things going little over board and growing dramatic, but then that’s the space in which the movie is set. You might call it flaws, but they are the flaws that you could live with.\n\nHe appears to be certain about the kind of movie that he wanted this one to be – a Bollywood film. He didn’t want to make an “Aviator” for sure. He has used all the right ingredients and to its perfection.\n\n***************************************************************************\n\nBOTTOM LINE(s)\n\nApart from his drug addiction and his jail episodes, Hirani hasn’t delved deep into other aspects of his life. He has not touched upon all his love episodes, his childhood, his film career, failed marriages etc.\n\nWell, there’s too much drama in Sanju Baba’s life to accommodate in 160 minutes, isn’t it?\n\nFew episodes look exaggerated. Few look fabricated or should I call them ‘exercise of creative liberty’? But who cares, as long as we have 160 minutes of pure entertainment on plate.\n\nAt the end of the movie, we can’t help but sympathize with him.\n\nSanju is perfect monsoon gift from Hirani. Watch it for the remarkable performance of Ranbir and the unbelievable life that Sanjay has lived.\n\nWatch it for the beautiful tale between the father and the son.\n\n***************************************************************************\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nSanju is Hirani’s ode to Sunil Dutt. It’s redemption of Sanjay Dutt and that of Ranbir.\n\n-CHAN\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n(Analysis of October movie, With Spoilers Ahead)\n\nDan (Varun Dhawan) – A Hotel Management trainee, working in a 5-star hotel has a long standing affair with reprimands. His child like demeanor and discipline issues keep earning him rebukes from the management. While his co-trainee Shiuli (Banita Sandhu) continues to earn admiration from the management, Dan is made to hop from one department to another viz. housekeeping, laundry, pest control and every other department except for the one which he loves the most – Kitchen.!\n\nThe year end arrives and along with it comes the long extended weekend, which would mean only one thing to the hotel staff – tight, hectic, tiring shifts. Dan slips away from the demanding schedule, as he goes home to attend his parents’ anniversary.\n\nAfter a tiring day at work, the trainees gather on the terrace floor for some merry making. Shiuli makes a causal enquiry about Dan’s absence. “Where’s Dan? Haven’t seen him since yesterday” she asks – a casual enquiry indeed! A moment later, she tries sitting on the parapet, but only to slip down with a deadly fall. The accident pushes her into coma.\n\nDan returns from vacation and visits Shiuli at ICU, where she looks more equipment than human. The machines that are supporting Shiuli in her battle for life and their intrinsic details piques Dan’s fancy than her sorry state.\n\nA dinner conversation with his roommate makes him learn about the events that preceded the accident. His friend makes a casual mention of Shiuli’s final words – “Where’s Dan?”\n\nIn spite of the attempts by others to write off her question as a casual one, Dan believes that it holds significance. He wants to know the reason behind her enquiry. He is in need of the answer, but the one who could answer his curiosity is living on ventilator, lost her conscious and showing no signs of recovery.\n\nAs rightly described in the trailer- “It’s not a love story, but a story about love”.! Dan doesn’t cry, neither does he laugh. He doesn’t say the magical words ‘I Love you’! Never once Dan tells us that he is in love with her. We see the love that a mother has towards her kid, siblings towards her sister and we see a Young adult whose pursuit for an answer evolves into an unconditional love.\n\nWritten beautifully by Juhi Chaturvedi, the script has transitioned into its absorbing visual form thanks to Shoojit Sircar and an exemplary cast.\n\nIn October, Shoojit doesn’t rely on heavy doses of background score and movement of Camera as much as he does on the performance of Actors. Rarely does the camera ‘dolly in’ to enhance the emotions and rarely does the Background score play to amplify the emotions. Isn’t that how it works in real life..? That’s one of the reasons why ‘October’ seems more real.\n\nIt also seems real, because the frames look extremely beautiful only when it has to and we don’t see actors mouthing deep philosophical dialogs garnished with metaphors. If any metaphor exists, then it exists in visual form – The flower Shiuli(Night Jasmine) being one.\n\nThe faith that Juhi and Shoojit have bestowed on ‘Keeping-it-simple’ coupled with his unorthodox methods, seems to have paid off, as the movie begins to appear more and more real, draws you into its world and puts you into perspective.\n\nWe have seen Varun Dhawan in his innocent avatars even before ‘October’. However, no other movie premise has been benefited by it, as much as this movie. The actor in Varun Dhawan ‘expresses it all, without really expressing anything’ and his restrained performance has only accentuated it.\n\nBefore the release of the movie, in one of his interviews he had said “I have never been so vulnerable on a film set. After a while, it stopped feeling like shooting. When you know that this is acting, it’s a film, there’s a block, that it’s okay. But when it stops feeling like acting and feels like real life, then the floodgates open”. After watching this movie, you shall know the significance that it holds for him.\n\nBanita Sandhu speaks it all through her eyes and Gitanjali Rao has emotions written all over her face.\n\nCasting of the movie is spot on! Shuttling between Hotel and Hospital, the movie has a plethora of characters that set up the perfect emotional ecosystem – roommate and his girlfriend who looks after Dan’s expenses, seemingly rude but silently caring boss, hostile colleagues, strangers, worried parents, friendly nurse and the list goes on. The cast appear to have slipped into their roles with an effortless ease.\n\nThe album has four plus songs, but the movie has none. However, the background score which plays only when needed stays with you!\n\nI often compare movies with food. Probably ‘October’ is like the red wine. Few might love it at the very first go. For few others it’s an acquired taste. The fact that the movie is earning extreme reactions is disheartening for sure, but is quite understandable.\n\n“Where’s Dan?” isn’t the central question of the movie. For Dan the central question is ‘Why did she ask about me?’ and hence the central question of the movie is – Whether Dan will be able to get an answer to it and whether his innocent attempts to revive her pays off or not?\n\nAnd once you watch the movie you shall know that the movie is indeed about ‘Where’s Dan?’ – The answer to which lies in his self-discovery.\n\nOctober is Juhi chaturvedi’s ‘Last leaf’, Shoojit’s best one yet and probably Varun’s ‘Where’s Dan?’ – As the actor in him appears to have made a self-discovery in this movie. Watch it if you want those emotional strings of yours to be tugged.\n\n-Chan\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHistory is a mutating entity. It mutates, because every day there occurs thousands of events of historical significance – few of them is open for world to know and the rest are secluded and stay under wraps. History is a mutating entity, because it’s based on perspectives and there occurs shift in perspectives every now and then.\n\nAnd History is a mutating entity, for it keeps getting rewritten whenever ‘what-has-stayed-under-wraps’ emerges out for world to know and see.\n\nEvery such emergence brings out stories of unsung heroes and Movies play a significant role in bringing these stories into bright light. ‘Schindler’s List’, ‘Hotel Rwanda’ etc. stand as perfect examples for this.\n\n‘A Taxi Driver’ – a South Korean Movie released in 2017, is an addition to the not-so-long-list of shining examples. A beautifully crafted movie based on the Gwangju uprising that took place in South Korea in early 80s and how a Taxi Driver became an accidental hero. (Something that I didn’t know until I watched this movie and read about it later. His real name may not be that).\n\nI am writing this piece, because of the relevance it holds to the times that we live in.\n\nThe movie speaks of a pro-democratic uprising that took birth in Gwangju against the martial law imposed by South Korean Government. The demonstration against the government by the student group was later supported by local citizens but only to be oppressed by the military. The 9 day rebellion-and-oppression exercise witnessed an estimated death toll of 600.\n\nHowever, Gwangju was quarantined during this period. Government had ensured that there is no outflow of information – in writing, in pictures or any other form. The entire uprising episode was being projected to the rest other parts of South Korea and world as “rebellion instigated by Communist sympathizers and rioters”. Death tolls were misreported and falsely projected, so as to make the world believe that it’s the army men who are getting killed by the civilians. This had helped the Government earn sympathizers across the nation.\n\nIt was not until a German Journalist by name ‘Jürgen Hinzpeter’ smuggled himself into Gwangju, videotaped the real events and broadcasted it to the rest of the world, that the perceptions changed.\n\nAnd He couldn’t have done so without the help of a Taxi driver who agrees to drive him into the town, for the hefty bill that the reported had promised to pay. The government sympathizer that he is, the driver’s perception about the uprising sees a seismic shift after he reaches the town and witnesses the holocaust. He then decides to stand by the reporter and ensures his safe return to Seoul along with the videotaped evidence of the military violence. He becomes the accidental hero.!\n\nThe beauty about ‘A Taxi Driver’ is the light hearted narrative set against a violent backdrop. In spite of being based on historical account, it hasn’t dressed itself into a ‘history movie’. The movie progresses through the evolving chemistry between the German reporter who doesn’t speak Korean and the taxi driver who’s English is ‘a-little-better-than-worse’. This has helped the movie in being both entertaining and engaging. Hence, it’s no wonder that ‘A Taxi Driver’ is amongst the highest grossing movies in South Korean Industry.\n\n‘Song Kang‑Ho’ (I have watched most of his movies, yet find it difficult to type in his name without seeking help from Google) is as impressive as ever. Playing the role of the taxi driver, he effortlessly slips into the role and made me empathize with his character. His list of ‘impressive’ movies has continued to grow.\n\nWe need movies like ‘A Taxi Driver’ because it deals with ‘collective perception’ on a very lighter note. In a subtle manner, it tells us how entire/ most parts of the nation/world could have a collective perception about truth only to be proven otherwise. It tells us how, it’s not so right to have an opinion on a provincial issue based on our telescopic views. Telescopic views are influenced on others perceptions. A first-hand account ‘might’ make you realize that your long held opinion was not a right one.\n\nThe movie does all this without being preachy.\n\nWe need movies like ‘A Taxi Driver’ because it tells a beautiful tale. We need movies like ‘A Taxi Driver’, because it might help us build a beautiful and better place to live in 🙂\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThere are movies that look grand, there are movies that appear beautiful and there are movies that the likes of Ang Lee and #SanjayLeelaBhansali do – enchanting, beautiful and grander than the grandest! Hit the pause button at your will, and any frame that freezes is a plush rich painting!\n\nI might be being a bit lavish in my praises for the movie – but that’s only because of the lavish experience that I had, while watching the movie – #Padmaavat!\n\nBased on an epic poem #Padmavat of 15th century, considered as history by many and argued as fiction by many others, this ‘Padmavat’ is a visual poetry painted on screen!\n\nHmm… but take away the grandeur, the aesthetic beauty and you will see the holes underneath.\n\nScreenplay is engaging, but not on par with the excellence that the rest of the departments have brought on screen! If only the screenplay had been improved by a notch or two – this could have been a timeless piece!\n\nThere are no surprises in the screenplay – the planned surprises are way too predictable. There are are no true turbulent journeys for the protagonists – there is no peaking success but only diving failure. For the antagonist it’s the polar opposite. All that he does is win, win and win..!\n\nOne of the important aspects (not like a rule of sorts) of screenplay is to make the audience empathize with the characters and make them find an alter ego in either or both of the protagonists. Yet, I repeat – It’s engaging!\n\nInspite of knowing the climax of the movie ( which everyone anyway knows), the portion does pull the right strings and puts an arrow right through your heart.!\n\nHowever, this minor imperfection could also be because of the “cuts” that were ordered to facilitate the screening.\n\nOther “minor” complaints are – #Padmavati termed as the most gorgeous beauty by the characters in the movie.\n\nIt becomes important to make the audience also feel the same. Amidst the stunning locales, sets and pretty women like #AditiRaoHydari; #DeepikaPadukone in the role of Padmavathi does look beautiful, but not “out of the world beautiful”.\n\nHad the glamour in the costumes, sets been toned down and had the other females looked less gorgeous, Padmvathi would have surely looked one of her kind beauty in the movie. (This is strictly my opinion).\n\n#ShahidKapoor has acted well, but doesn’t look like a king who could inspire bravery and instill confidence in his citizens.\n\nOr is it the side effect of being cast alongside energetic #RanveerSingh, who in the role of Khilji – has KHILLED it.!\n\nIf only he hadn’t gone overboard in couple of scenes and only if #Bhansalihad painted his scenes less beautifully, he could have had a terrorizing impact.\n\nWell.. As I said these are only minor complaints. It’s like walking into an expensive restaurant, with state of the art interiors. The food might not be the best thing that you would have ever eaten, but you wouldn’t mind as long as it’s good and the ambiance is ‘never-experienced-before’ and ‘enchanting’. Had the food been great, it would have been a fulfilling experience!\n\nPadmaavat is an experience to absorb! Not to undermine the efforts put by #Bahubaali, but for me this is the greatest cinematic effort to come out of Indian Industry. #SanjayLeelaBhansali as a film maker does inspire jealousy and makes you feel a lot inferior.\n\nHe has given us a text book of film making – where all the chapters might not be relevant, but ones that are relevant are the ones that are must learns.\n\nPS: Call it my lack of knowledge, but I couldn’t understand how a movie which heaps praises on #Rajput valour and pride, offends them.!\n\nAND IF YOU HAD THE PATIENCE TO READ THIS LENGTHY PIECE, YOU ARE INDEED GREAT.! 😀 😀 Couldn’t even proof read it, such a lengthy one to give a second read..! 😛\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s been long since I have written a detailed analysis of any movie – could be because none of the watch was motivating enough for me to write or could be that I haven’t watched some of the best movies that got released in the recent past.\n\n“Dear Zindagi” – The latest offering from Gauri Shinde, stands as a testimony for the earlier accolades that she had received for her first outing – “English Vinglish”.\n\nBeing an ad filmmaker that she is, it’s for sure that every frame of the movie would be tidy – spick and span, Abundance of light and props only adding to the aesthetic decorum.\n\nThe movie might not be inspired from them, but it does remind you of “Good will hunting” and “Dead Poet’s Society” in parts.\n\n********************************************************************************\n\nPlot:\n\nThe movie revolves around the life of a female cinematographer Kaira (the loveable Alia), going through a phase of “Distress and Desperation” and how she, with the help of a psychiatrist Dr Jehangir Khan (our dear SRK) manages to overcome it.\n\nIt’s this very one lined plot of the movie, which manages to strike a chord with the audience with it’s personal touch.\n\n“Phase of distress and desperation” is bound to visit everyone’s life, every now and then. The unwelcomed guest that it is, it does no gender biasing – treating men and women alike. That said, even I am not spared.\n\nIt’s highly improbable to prevent its visit, but what you could certainly do is – Mastering the art of getting yourselves out of it, as soon as you get into it.\n\nAt the surface layer it would appear that “Dear Zindagi” is trying to give life lessons on how you could help yourselves get out of the phase. But what it does in real is, asking us to identify our own specific ways of overcoming the distress.\n\nEveryone has his/her sources of distress – job, love life, family, economy, social stigma etc. For Kaira, it’s her failed relationships and a childhood deprived of parental love.\n\nSome of us are Kaira, some of us are Jehangir Khan and some of us are both of them. I think, audience identifying themselves with either or both these characters, is Gauri’s biggest victory as a writer and filmmaker\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nPerformances:\n\nTime and again, Alia has reminded us that she is one of the best actresses that we have got. This movie is no exception. Wide range of emotions that she has brought on the screen, seemingly natural and pulled off with so much of an ease, proves her mettle as a brilliant actress.\n\nNothing could be more delighting than watching Shahrukh in such performance oriented roles – maintaining a good hand distance from his stardom. I can’t speak for others, but as a die-hard fan of his, I found him excellent in this role.\n\nAngad and Kunal manage to impress in their brief appearances.\n\nYashaswini as Jackie, is also someone who might stay in your mind for quite some time, for her cute performance.\n\n*************************************************************************************\n\nMUSIC:\n\nAmit Trivedi has worked magic with some of those numbers – that have shades of his earlier works in Lootera.\n\n*************************************************************************************\n\nWHAT COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED?\n\nIt’s of my personal opinion that the cinematographer part of her character has not been effectively written/ brought out. Several forced “superficial” elements put in to justify the cinematographer aspect. But that hasn’t done the movie any damage.\n\nHer “childhood deprived of love” could have been much effectively depicted.\n\nI don’t know if it exists for real – but the melodramatic family that she has including her uncle and aunt, appear far from real. I would discount that, considering it to be a creative liberty taken to entertain the audience.\n\n*************************************************************************************\n\nBottom line:\n\nYou “might” like this movie, if you have loved – Good Will Hunting, Dead Poet’s society, Highway, Devil Wears Prada, Wake up Sid.\n\nI wouldn’t say that every one of you might love the movie – A family that sat next to me, had their fair share of complaints.\n\nBut it’s certainly one the beautiful cinemas that I happened to watch in the recent past.\n\nFor the love towards SRK and for the love of Cinema…….!\n\n-Chan\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
