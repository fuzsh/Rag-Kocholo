        "text": "Amazon Prime Video is making its biggest push into India to date with plans to launch more than 40 films and TV series while striking new licensing deals and launching a TVoD film rental service.\n\nAt its first Prime Video Presents India showcase event in Mumbai, the streamer said its investment in the service would more than double over the next five years.\n\nThis is led by original features, series and co-productions, in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu, which are planned to launch over the next two years. These will range from thrillers, action and dramas to comedies and romances. Original programming for young adult audiences will explore supernatural and horror while Prime Video will grow its unscripted series catalogue with biographies, true-crime and investigative docudramas.\n\nScroll down for full list of titles\n\nThe films include Ammu, directed and co-written by Charukesh Sekar, in which a woman takes desperate measures in an attempt to get her abusive husband suspended from police duty. Produced by Chennai-based Stone Bench, it will be told in Telugu.\n\nHindi titles include Aye Watan… Mere Wayan, directed by Kannan Iyer and produced by Dharmatic Entertainment, which is inspired by true events and follows a young girl who became important to the freedom fight of Indian independence; and Maja Maa, a comedy about a mother who unwittingly becomes an obstacle to her son’s marriage, directed by Anand Tiwari and produced by Leo Media Collective and Amritpal Singh Bindra.\n\nThe streamer also announced new multi-year licensing deals and co-productions with some of India’s biggest studios including Ajay Devgn FFilms, Dharma Productions, Excel Entertainment and Yash Raj Films.\n\nIn addition, Amazon has launched Prime Video Store, its transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) film rental service in India, available to both Prime members and non-members, giving customers early rental access to the latest Indian and international films.\n\nGaurav Gandhi, country head at Amazon Prime Video India, said: ““In the last five years, we have built a strong slate of locally produced content across languages, super-serving the diverse entertainment needs of Indian customers… We have played a key role in helping expand the linguistic palette of Indian customers, thereby, increasing the audience base for creators and talent.”\n\nAparna Purohit, head of India originals for Amazon Prime Video, added: “Our mission has been to tell compelling, authentic and rooted stories that not just connect with audiences in India but resonate with audiences across the world.”\n\nTitles
