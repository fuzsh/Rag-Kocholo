        "text": "Remembering Baji Rout (Youngest martyr in the history of the freedom movement of India) on his death Anniversary üôèüèªüáÆüá≥ He was shot by the British police for refusing to ferry them across the Brahmani river on the night of October 11, 1938, at Nilakanthapur Ghat, Bhuban, Odisha I pay homage to India's youngest martyr Baji Rout on his birth anniversary. Born in a small village of Odisha, #BajiRout took bullets on his head for refusing British troops to ferry them across river Brahmani. The courageous 12-year-old boy holds a special place in our hearts... let us know about his valour and courage. 1. He was born on October 5, 1926, at Nilakanthapur village in Dhenkanal district of Odisha. 2. Baji Rout lost his life to the bullet of a British soldier at the age of 12. 3. As an active member of the Banar Sena of Prajamandal (Party of the People), he had volunteered to keep a watch by the river at night. The British Police force ordered him to help them cross the river on his boat, which he refused. The police force then fired on him. 4. He joined the Banar Sena of Prajamandal at a very tender age. 5. He had also lost his father at a very early age. His mother was surviving on the wages earned by rice husking in the neighbourhood. 6. He had watched how mercilessly Dhenkanal King, Shankar Pratap Singhdeo was fleecing the poor villagers, including his mother of their earnings by using armed forces. So, when Baishnav Charan Pattanayak of Dhenkanal town, later, famous as Veer Baisnav, raised a banner of revolt against the King and founded Prajamandal, Baji joined it despite his tender age. 7. He stood against the oppressive rulers of Dhenkanal and the British. Namma to his Sacrifices üôèüáÆüá≥ #india #freedomfighter\n\nOutsourcing bookkeeping can save your business from financial risks.

Leadership is not about being in charge. It is not about making all the decisions. It is not about having all the answers. It is not about getting all the credit. It is not about status and entitlement. Leadership is about taking care of those who are in our charge. It is about putting others first. It is about always making decisions in the best interest of our team and our organization. It is about self-sacrifice. It is about empowering others to make decisions. Leaders take responsibility when things go wrong and give away the credit when they go right. True leaders have made the shift. They understand the importance of leading the whole person in the 21st Century. What would you add? What do you think are the most important qualities of 21st Century Leadership?
