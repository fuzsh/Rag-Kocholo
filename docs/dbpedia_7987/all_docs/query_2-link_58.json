        "text": "It was in early 2017 when screenwriter Juhi Chaturvedi came up with the idea of Gulabo Sitabo. The moment she shared it with director Shoojit Sircar and told him that there was going to be a character like Mirza Sheikh, a crabby 78-year-old man and landlord of a dilapidated mansion in Lucknow, he knew that Amitabh Bachchan was going to play it. Sircar and Chaturvedi narrated the idea to Mr Bachchan in February 2017 and he was on board since then.\n\nFor over two years, the writer-director duo, who has given us meritorious films such as Vicky Donor (2012), Piku (2015) and October (2018), lived the pulse of Lucknow – the language, the essence, the music and the whole sur of the city. “Wo ek nabz hoti hai na sheher ki? Matlab ek toh sheher as a location aur ek as a character,” Chaturvedi tells in a gentle, unhurried chat, reminiscent of the kind of films she has written.\n\nHad Gulabo Sitabo been set in Delhi’s Chandni Chowk or Bhopal, it would have been easier for Sircar to tell the story because of his familiarity with these locations. However, since Chaturvedi comes from Lucknow and knows the city well, it was mutually decided that the film would be based there. Over and above, it was an added advantage for Bachchan, who was born and brought up in Allahabad (now Prayagraj), a city 200 kilometres away from Lucknow. “He understands these places culturally,” Chaturvedi says.\n\nFilmmaker R Balki had recently said that it was impossible to write a story first and then cast Bachchan in it. Does Chaturvedi share the sentiment? “There is always a temptation to cast him,” she says, adding, “The moment it’s a 70-plus man, whether he is Bhaskor Banerjee in Piku or Mirza in Gulabo Sitabo, obviously the desire for me as a writer is that ‘would he agree to do something like that?’” However, she asserts that the writing has to be true to the character.\n\nChaturvedi shares a great work equation with Sircar. In her sparkling film career of eight years, she has never written a screenplay for any other director. Is she open to collaborating with other filmmakers? “I can’t really think of it actively. Because for me, what’s important is that my written work is brought out as a beautiful creative piece of cinema. So far, it has been happening. My agenda is to write and work with someone who can add much more value to my work,” she says.\n\nIn an industry that breathes on insecurities, we often hear of screenwriters getting anxious about the treatment their work will receive. Many writers even go to the extent of paying regular visits to the sets to ascertain that the final product comes out exactly the way they had envisioned. Chaturvedi, however, says that she does not have that insecurity at all. She visits the sets not out of insecurity but to learn more about the filmmaking process.\n\n“You stay there as a support,” she says forcefully, adding, “If the cinematographer has some confusion, he can come to the director and me and say, ‘Can you guys change the scene because my lighting is not working?’ It may happen that my scene changes from morning to night and I might have to rewrite it.”\n\n“It is all towards making the project better rather than being there as a chowkidaar.”\n\nChaturvedi, whose list of favourite contemporary screenwriters includes names such as Varun Grover, Reema Kagti, Zoya Akhtar, Alankrita Shrivastava and Konkona Sen Sharma, has stuck to writing slice-of-films filled with feel-good characters. Even the negative characters in her movies are not wholly negative.\n\n“There is enough negativity in the world but I don’t want to make any judgement about it. There are people who are doing whatever they are doing due to their own circumstances, there are people who are trying to pull you down, malign your name and doing activities that should not be done by any morally correct person. But then, that is their karma,” she says.\n\nChaturvedi seems clear when she says that she does not want to write scripts involving acts of violence. “If you ask me to write a script about a lot of violence and murders and all, I don’t know if I can write that. I know that world exists but the world that I like to be with is a little more positive, a little more aware, where simple people exist and they have their regular issues,” she signs off.\n\nGulabo Sitabo, also featuring Ayushmann Khurrana, Vijay Raaz, Brijendra Kala, Farrukh Jafar and Srishti Shrivastava, among others, released online on Thursday night."
