Having been the creative force behind ad films for Titan watches and Saffola, she also penned the dialogues for an Amitabh Bachchan film, though it didn't make it to the big screen. Moving to Delhi, Juhi drew from her experiences in Lajpat Nagar to write the script of the Bollywood film, Vicky Donor starring Ayushmann Khurana. Her script for Piku also won accolades from critics and movie-goers alike, with the movie winning the Best Story, Best Screenplay and Best Dialogue at the Zee Cine Awards."
