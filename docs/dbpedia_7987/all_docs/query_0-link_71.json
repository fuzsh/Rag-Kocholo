        "text": "🎉 Reflecting on a Journey of Achievements and Learning on My Birthday 🙏 Hello everyone, As I celebrate my birthday today, I find myself humbled by the journey I've embarked upon, one that's been marked by moments of triumph and lessons learned. In 1973, I was fortunate enough to secure an All India Rank 1 in the Higher School Examination, surpassing previous records by an astonishing 8%. This milestone wasn't just a personal achievement; it was a reminder of the power of dedication and perseverance. This pattern of success continued when I achieved All India Rank 1 in my CA examination. My journey has been guided by simple principles that I've held close to my heart. A fundamental lesson I've embraced is the importance of not procrastinating. This approach has kept me accountable and ready to face challenges head-on. Another principle I've embraced is the value of understanding the building blocks and fundamentals in every subject and endeavor. By delving deep into the core concepts, I've found room for creativity and innovation, allowing me to see beyond the ordinary. My journey has been fueled by a drive for excellence, even in the face of imperfections. This pursuit has led me to consistently strive for the best possible outcomes, recognizing that perfection may be unattainable, but excellence is within reach. Remarkably, I've achieved these milestones without the assistance of tuitions. Instead, I've chosen the path of consistent, dedicated learning. Seeking clarity and understanding, I've forged my own path, a decision that has empowered me beyond measure. As I share my story on this special day, I'm humbled by the thought that my experiences might inspire others. May we all remember that success is not just a destination, but a continuous journey of growth and self-discovery. Here's to embracing each moment with open hearts and eager minds. Warmly, Sunil Goel BCom(Hons), FCA 🎂 #JourneyToSuccess #HumbleBeginnings #LearningNeverStops #UnwaveringDedication #SandMartin #outsourcing #KPO #ICAI #icaistudents #sunilgoelassociates #srcc #SandMartinOutsourcing #happyindependenceday2023\n\n19 Years of Corporate Journey - Remembering mentors, well wishers! On this day in 2005, I kickstarted my corporate journey. Just like most of the South Indian Engineers, I too joined Tata Consultancy Services was a big foundation to my career. We all have a touch of this brand Tata in our lives in some form, isn't it? Thanks to managers like Bhaskar Shastri (he/him), I got the chance to see the first hand experience of team management, project delivery skills. 2009: After 3 years in TCS, faced the usual dilemma - Onsite vs Higher Studies - Cracked CAT and pursued MBA for 2 years Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow. This phase of life changed my career and perspective towards life. My life was moving slowly in second gear and the rigour/experience in campus shifted it to 5th gear. 2011 - Another dilemma - Consulting vs Marketing in campus - Chose consulting. The journey of the middle class consultant started here and 5 years in PwC could not have been better, with great learnings from mentors like Ram Periyagaram, Sudipta Ghosh. 2016 - Deloitte happened. 5 years of exciting journey with leaders from different style, helping me to understand the consulting world deeper and better. Thanks to some of the mentors in this journey like Saurabh Kumar, Srinivas Batny (BGS), Vijay, who guided me in tough times and helped me to realize the hidden \"partner\" skills in me early in my career. 2021 - started. After a long stint in process driven bigger firms, more learnings with my stint in Polestar Solutions & Services to get adapted to people centric startup world. Thanks to Chetan, Saurabh who helped me to drive a bigger team of 500+ people and manage a larger PnL for two years. 2023 - Now, in Cyient, driving the automation, transformation and change management here. A role which is bringing the engineer back in my life after 19 years of engineering. Again, thanks to mentors like Anand Parameswaran, Rajaneesh - learning the art of driving bigger transformations in organization. Through out the journey, some unique experiences of offering AI mentorship to agencies like ISRO - Indian Space Research Organisation to being a mystery shopper in pizza outlets. Every experience - small or big - has given me more to learn. Last but not least, coming from a Tier2 town with little exposure to the metro world, I was always keen on sharing everything I learn during the weekdays with more students to guide them. Started with smaller B schools, but now regularly spending my weekends in top B schools like IIM Calcutta, IIM Lucknow, IIM Amritsar, Great Lakes, Christ University. 19 years in corporate world - just realizing that I am not even half way through. All the best things in my life have happened as a surprise and I did not plan them. So, looking forward to another 20 years of career with the same excitement and curiosity. #SenseofGratitude Mentors make a big difference in the way our careers and lives shape up, isn't it?\n\nCrafting this post has been a reflective journey, one that required me to distill the rich tapestry of experiences garnered during my time at #XLRI. Immersed in an environment pulsating with the vibrancy of world-class faculty and an eclectic mix of participants spanning diverse domains, each day was a testament to the sheer beauty of learning. Personally, the odyssey has been nothing short of enlightening. I've had the privilege of imbibing wisdom from a multitude of sources - from the erudite professors at XLRI to the diverse perspectives brought forth by fellow participants hailing from various walks of professional life. Navigating through the program wasn't without its challenges. Yet, amidst the whirlwind of energy and enthusiasm exuded by seasoned professionals, every moment was an opportunity for growth. Engaging conversations, thought-provoking case studies, and a plethora of concepts and theories formed the backdrop against which our collective journey unfolded. The Executive Diploma in Advanced Business Strategies for CXOs encapsulated an expansive array of subjects, ranging from entrepreneurship to corporate governance, strategic marketing to finance valuation, and beyond. With each module delving deep into the intricacies of modern business dynamics, the program left no stone unturned in equipping us with the tools to navigate the complexities of the corporate landscape. From dissecting mergers and acquisitions to exploring the nuances of strategic human resource management, from understanding the nuances of information management to deciphering organizational structures, the curriculum was as comprehensive as it was enriching. As I reflect on this transformative experience, I am filled with gratitude for the opportunity to have been part of such a transformative journey. Here's to embracing the lessons learned and leveraging them to chart a course towards continued growth and success. #ExecutiveEducation #LifeLongLearning\n\n\"What lies behind and what lies before are tiny matters compared to what lies within us\"- R.W. Emerson In the hot summers of north India in 2007, a young boy dressed in school uniform stood before hundreds of school teachers and government officials. He spoke in Hindi, advocating for the use of English in education, and the whole campus resounded with applause. The story of this boy who fought his school management to participate in the debate competition and won still holds high in the small town of Bindki, inspiring students to do the unconventional. That boy was me, Utkarsh Shukla, and this is my story. After failing to make it into the IITs, I enrolled in UPTU, India's most populous engineering university, where I forged countless memories and lifetime friendships. During campus placements, I boldly decided to join a core company, L&T, rejecting three offers from trendy IT firms. My unconventional journey continued when, as a Graduate Engineering Trainee, I took up a sales role at a start-up division and volunteered to go to Chennai, one of the least sought-after locations in the batch. Over the next ten years, I experienced extremes of professional life. There were times when I faced rejections after rejections during cold calls and times when the same customers invited me to train them on smart building technologies. I roamed the streets of Chennai, selling cameras to dealers, and later negotiated multi-million dollar deals with CXOs. My first job at L&T taught me the value of ethics and empathy, and Honeywell honed my aggressive sales skills. But my last stint at Trane exposed me to real leadership. I joined Trane as the youngest employee in the India sales team. I quickly rose through the ranks to become the youngest people manager in the industry, managing the zonal P&L. Over the next two years, I made a name for myself in the industry by virtue of hard work. I realized the downside of growing faster than the industry's pace when my application for a leadership role got rejected, and then the idea of business education kicked in. In December 2021, my manager granted me 15 days' leave to study for GMAT and offered me his vacant flat. This gesture taught me a valuable lesson in team management and gave me a decent score on my first try. For me, the most critical factor in selecting a business school was the emphasis on leadership development. I have found IIMA PGPX most suitable for preparing individuals for leadership. The decision to leave a gratifying job, letting go of the thrill of closing the business deals, and not being able to see my son's smile for one year is not easy, but aspirations overpowered emotions, and I took a leap of faith. My journey, full of ups and downs, has taught me strength and resilience. I've learned to keep pushing forward, striving for excellence, and never giving up on my dreams. I hope my story can inspire someone to do the same. #PGPX #RedBrickDiaries #inspiration #IIMAhmedabad\n\n\"𝑴𝒚 6-𝑴𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒉 𝑴𝑩𝑨 𝑱𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒏𝒆𝒚 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝑭𝒆𝒂𝒓 𝒕𝒐 𝑹𝒆𝒂𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒔𝒔.\" 𝐀𝐝𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐁𝐈𝐌𝐓𝐄𝐂𝐇 After completing my graduation in BBA, I set my sights on pursuing an MBA, so I gave the CAT examination and took admission in Birla Institute of Management Technology (BIMTECH). The initial month was daunting, as a fresher, grappling with fears about communication skills and fitting into the dynamic environment. However, deep down, I realized that the onus was on me to navigate these challenges. 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 Despite the initial fear, I plunged into the experience, facing numerous presentations and interviews. Over time, I conquered my fear, realizing that personal growth is a journey no one else can undertake on your behalf. I am grateful for the support of my teachers, friends, and parents who stood by me during the ups and downs, encouraging me to participate in diverse activities. 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐎𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬 In the span of six months, I embraced numerous opportunities and pushed myself beyond my comfort zone. This journey has gradually transformed me into a more extroverted individual. MBA, as I discovered, is not confined to closed rooms; it's about practical knowledge. Our teachers consistently emphasized the importance of getting hands dirty to understand the corporate reality. 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 Recognizing the significance of practical knowledge, I approached my projects with dedication. Obviously not all, there are some part of Chat GPT in my assignments 😅 , but few assignments that is connected with our interested field. This integration of theory and application has been instrumental in my learning process. 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡 Many say that the MBA journey equips you to handle pressure, and I can attest to its truth. As I approach the end of the second trimester, I reflect on the invaluable lessons learned. This phase has been pivotal in preparing me for the corporate world, instilling resilience and adaptability. 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧: 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 With the second trimester coming to a close, I stand on the threshold of the corporate world. Grateful for the transformative journey, I acknowledge the role of every person who contributed to my growth. The MBA experience, as my teachers emphasized, is about understanding the reality and getting ready to face it. Excited about the next chapter, I'm prepared to leverage my newfound skills and knowledge. A heartfelt thanks to my mentors - Meera Kapoor, Dhruva Chak, Dr. Pooja Misra, Naman Chaturvedi, Sweety Dixit.
