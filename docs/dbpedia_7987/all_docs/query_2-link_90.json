        "text": "Indian filmmaker and television personality Karan Johar’s jewelry brand Tyaani has made a significant entry into Pune with the inauguration of its first store in the city. Situated in the bustling Kalyan Nagar area, the newly opened store boasts an impressive collection of over 2,000 designs. These designs span various categories, including necklaces, earrings, bangles, rings, maangtikas, and other accessories, offering a diverse range of options for customers seeking exquisite jewelry pieces.\n\nThe launch event was a star-studded affair featuring celebrity designer Maheep Kapoor, who is also the creative mind behind Tyaani’s new festive collection, Inaayt. Kapoor's presence added a touch of glamour to the event, drawing in jewelry enthusiasts and fashion aficionados alike.\n\nOne of the highlights of the launch was the personalized styling sessions, where guests were given the opportunity to explore pieces that matched their unique styles. This interactive element allowed attendees to engage directly with the brand, enhancing their shopping experience. Additionally, guests had the exclusive chance to meet Maheep Kapoor and gain insights into the inspiration behind Tyaani’s intricate designs, further deepening their appreciation for the brand's craftsmanship.\n\nTyaani's direct-to-consumer (D2C) website has also played a crucial role in its growth, featuring top actresses such as Janhvi Kapoor, Shanaya Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Juhi Chawla, and Kriti Sanon modeling for the brand’s latest collections. This strategic use of celebrity endorsements has helped Tyaani build a strong brand presence and connect with a wider audience.\n\nKaran Johar, a well-known figure in the Indian film industry, founded Tyaani in May 2022. The brand launched its first offline store in Borivali, Mumbai, marking the beginning of its journey in the luxury jewelry market. Since then, Tyaani has expanded rapidly and now operates seven outlets across major Indian cities, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, New Delhi, Chandigarh, and Pune.\n\nThe Pune store's opening signifies Tyaani’s commitment to expanding its footprint and making its exquisite jewelry accessible to more customers across India. With a focus on combining traditional craftsmanship with contemporary designs, Tyaani aims to cater to the evolving tastes of modern consumers while preserving the rich heritage of Indian jewelry.\n\nMax Factor, a cosmetics line from the multinational beauty company Coty Inc., has entered the Indian market in partnership with New Delhi-based specialty beauty retailer House of Beauty. Max Factor will launch its global bestsellers, including foundation, mascara, and lipsticks, in India, featuring Indian actress and producer Priyanka Chopra Jonas as the brand’s global ambassador.\n\n“Max Factor is entering a new era of exciting growth in India. We are thrilled to bring our best-selling products to the Indian market, with Priyanka Chopra Jonas leading the charge as our global brand ambassador,” said Kristina Strunz, managing director, Coty Southeast Asia and India.\n\nIts products will be available on e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Myntra, Boddess, and Tata Cliq, as well as at the department store chain Shoppers Stop. The brand aims to be present at all key beauty retailers by 2025. House of Beauty currently manages multiple international brands, including Anastasia Beverly Hills, Kylie Cosmetics, EcoTools, Juice Beauty, and Neal’s Yard Remedies.\n\n“We’re thrilled to welcome Max Factor to the House of Beauty family of brands. We are committed to making the brand highly discoverable and accessible, reaching a wider audience of discerning makeup lovers across the country,” stated Sanjali Giri, chief business officer, House of Beauty.\n\nMax Factor was established in 1909 as Max Factor & Company by Polish-American businessman Maksymilian Faktorowicz. In 1991, it was acquired by Procter & Gamble, and in 2015, New York-based Coty purchased the brand.\n\nFounded in Paris in 1904, Coty, one of the world’s largest beauty companies, has a portfolio of brands across fragrance, color cosmetics, skin, and body care, with a presence in more than 125 countries and territories.

Despite this, the California-based company exceeded estimates for fourth-quarter revenue and profit. Although beauty companies like Elf have maintained strong demand following the pandemic, the forecast suggests that high food prices and interest rates are prompting consumers to prioritize essential goods over discretionary purchases.\n\nIn the previous month, retailer Ulta Beauty reported a slowdown in demand across various categories for the first quarter. According to data analytics firm Emarketer, U.S. retail sales for cosmetics and beauty products are anticipated to grow by 6.9 percent in 2024, compared to a 10.5 percent increase in 2023. UBS analysts have also pointed out that Elf has a history of issuing conservative full-year targets.\n\n\"We do like to take things one quarter at a time ... it's very hard to kind of grow 80% on top of 80%. the first initial outlook is \"very strong,\" said Tarang Amin, CEO, Elf Beauty in an interview with Reuters.\" Amin also noted that Elf is seeing overall \"good behavior\" from a consumer standpoint.\n\nElf Beauty anticipates 2025 sales to range between $1.23 billion and $1.25 billion, falling short of the expected $1.27 billion, according to LSEG data. The company also projects annual adjusted profit to be between $3.20 and $3.25 per share, below the estimated $3.51 per share. In the fourth quarter, net sales surged by 71.4 percent to $321.1 million, surpassing the forecasted $292.6 million. This follows an 84.9 percent sales growth in the previous quarter. Additionally, Elf reported an adjusted profit of 53 cents per share, exceeding the anticipated 32 cents per share.\n\nType Beauty Inc., a pioneering beauty brand, is celebrated for its skin-inclusive, dermatologically tested makeup using innovative formulations tailored to all Indian skin types.

In India, Sebamed products are marketed by USV Private Limited.\n\nZara's meteoric rise to success in the country over the past decade has been undeniable. However, after experiencing exponential growth with sales doubling every two years, the brand's expansion rate has gradually tapered off in recent years.\n\n\"The market is very competitive, and the challenges are real. Nevertheless the opportunity pool and the size of the market means that there is space for multiple successful players. Trent remains well placed to navigate this next phase of growth by leveraging our platform and growth engines,\" P Venkatesalu, chief executive officer at Trent, said.\n\nInditex Trent, the joint venture between Zara and Tata responsible for operating 23 Zara stores in India, experienced a notable shift in financial performance. According to Trent's annual report, revenue saw an 8% increase to Rs 2,775 cr in the last fiscal year, a significant decrease from the 40% growth recorded the previous year. Concurrently, net profit also declined, dropping by 8% to Rs 244 cr.\n\n\"Zara has been a runaway success since its arrival in the country more than a decade ago but after initially doubling sales every two years, the brand's rate of expansion had come down in the past few years. \"The market is very competitive, and the challenges are real. Nevertheless the opportunity pool and the size of the market means that there is space for multiple successful players. Trent remains well placed to navigate this next phase of growth by leveraging our platform and growth engines,\" P Venkatesalu, chief executive officer at Trent, said.\"\n\nTrent, the operator of Westside, has redirected its attention towards its lower-priced fast fashion brand, Zudio. In the last fiscal year, Zudio expanded aggressively, averaging about four new store openings per week, bringing the total store count to 545 doors. Additionally, Trent maintains a separate partnership with the Inditex group to manage Massimo Dutti stores in India. This collaboration witnessed a notable increase in revenues, rising by 14% to ₹102 cr.\n\nAccording to industry experts, consumer demand has experienced a downturn over the past few years, requiring brands to exert additional efforts to achieve same-store growth. Much of the top-line growth for brands has been attributed to the addition of new stores rather than organic increases in consumer demand.\n\n\"Most international and premium Indian brands are competing for a relatively narrow slice of the population pie in the larger urban centres. While the Indian market is a bright spot amid the gloom in the world's major economies, global pressures are likely to play a part in the confidence among brands to invest in expansion,\" said, adding there is not necessarily \"fatigue\" for the brand, \"said Devangshu Dutta, founder of retail consulting firm Third Eyesight.\n\nIn a landscape where competition for consumer attention is increasingly fierce and choices are diversifying across a spectrum of brands, the impact on individual brand performance is inevitable. India, as the world's second most-populous country, stands as an alluring market for apparel brands, particularly as young consumers exhibit a growing affinity for western-style clothing. The operational synergy between Zara and Tata's joint venture, Inditex, is notable, with Inditex primarily overseeing back-end operations and merchandise sourcing, while Tata's expertise lies in real estate and location identification.\n\nThe luxury Maison, formerly known as Her Story, is embarking on a new chapter of global expansion. With a presence in Paris and America, the brand is introducing new collections centered around contemporary universal values, including upcoming high jewelry and men's collections. Throughout this journey, the Maison is actively committed to sustainability and environmental goals. As a result of these developments, it has rebranded itself as ANEKA.\n\n“It is no longer just about ‘her’ story. ANEKA poses a very modern question – What is the position of an individual within the collective? Representing only the collective doesn't make sense, and putting the individual far above the collective doesn't resonate with our values either. So, for me, ANEKA is a super philosophical name,” said Philippe Nobile, ANEKA Chairman and Paris-based luxury industry veteran.\n\nANEKA maintains its presence in Mumbai, situated within the city's esteemed art district of Kala Ghoda. Additionally, it has expanded its reach to Le Printemps Haussmann in Paris, renowned as one of the world's premier luxury retail destinations. Following this, ANEKA is set to make its debut in America, alongside the opening of another unique flagship boutique in India.\n\nAnkit Mehta, CEO shared, “An important part of building something modern, global and inclusive is the ability to adapt and evolve. The ANEKA team today is a truly global network of talented people that have come together for one universal mission: to elevate a new-age luxury brand – one that connects meaningfully with people and finds inspiration in heritage and culture – and bring it to every part of the world.”\n\nEach ANEKA collection undergoes a meticulous creation process lasting nine months to a year within Maison's cutting-edge atelier. This facility is fully vertically integrated, encompassing material sourcing, handcrafting, and retail aspects. Designs are brought to fruition using top-quality diamonds in distinctive cuts, complemented by the finest precious gemstones, all set in pure 18K recycled gold. The Maison embodies a concept of 'new luxury,' where significance surpasses mere material worth.\n\nSitanshi Talati-Parikh, Brand Director said, “ANEKA’s raison d’etre is to create meaning and positive impact, both by action and as a source of inspiration for others. In offering representation for different voices and values, it fosters an understanding of varied perspectives. We’re passionate, as we’ve always been, about representing the beautiful dialogue between the individual and their modern values, in a contemporary world that is dynamic, mindful and inclusive.”\n\nANEKA's headquarters will be located in Geneva, supported by international offices and teams situated in Paris, Mumbai, New York, and Milan. The brand is backed by Walking Tree, a prominent player in the gems and jewelry industry with headquarters in Paris and Geneva, boasting a vast network spanning Europe, India, and America.\n\nLudic, renowned for its footwear-centric lifestyle brand, expands its product range by introducing four new fragrances tailored for day and evening wear, catering to both men and women.

Modi mentioned that Colorbar, being the fastest-growing brand among the three, will be the first to undergo the public offering, while the loss-making 24Seven may witness a financial turnaround by FY25.\n\n“Together, these brands generate about Rs 3,000-3,500 crore revenue but we expect Colorbar to grow 50% this year and with the plan of increasing exports to international markets, we believe it has a potential to grow faster,\" said Samir K Modi, Managing Director, Colorbar.\n\nIndia's beauty and personal care market is poised for rapid growth, outpacing similar markets worldwide with a compound annual growth rate of 10 percent between 2022 and 2027, swelling the market size to $30 billion from $19 billion currently.\n\nNotably, this sector has attracted attention from major retailers such as the Tata group and Reliance Retail, both of which have entered the beauty product market with their own stores to compete with established players like Nykaa and Dabur-owned NewU.\n\nRegarding Godfrey Phillips India, the flagship business of Modi Enterprises, announcing plans to divest from 24Seven, Modi clarified that he is not personally seeking to sell the business.

This expected revival comes on the heels of a recent downturn, as FY24 witnessed a significant 16.5 percent year-on-year decline in LGD exports, the totaling approximately will be $1402.30 million.\n\nLGD Exports have been experiencing a decline in recent times, and have seen over 6.5 percent decline y-o-y for FY24. However, the sales volume has been growing, and the decline in the prices has impacted the exports.\n\nThe demand for Lab-grown Diamond exports is projected to rise in FY25, but the demand for naturally mined diamonds may remain sluggish.\n\n“The LGD exports are expected to witness a revival with expected growth of 7-9 percent to reach ~$1500-1530 million in FY25. Faced with ongoing geopolitical and economic disruptions globally, the gems and jewelry industry is relying on the rapidly growing LGD market to mitigate the effects of low demand for natural diamonds. Due to the low cost of man-made diamonds, domestic consumption, and exports are expected to increase in this fiscal,” said Tanvi Shah, Director, CareEdge Analytics and Advisory.\n\nIndia is known to produce over 3 million lab-grown diamonds a year and accounts for 15 percent of the global production. Currently, India is the second largest lab-grown diamond producer, trailing behind China. In 2023, the projected value of the domestic lab-grown diamond market is $ 300 million. The industry has faced challenges, for instance, lab-grown diamond supply has surged, which led to a significant price drop.\n\nShah added, “While the downtrend has led to a severe hit for the overall fondness towards LGDs, the way forward looks promising for the revival of demand. This comes with a backdrop of a decline in natural diamond prices triggered due to weak purchasing power, which in turn sets the ground for LGD demand to flourish.\n\nThe pricing per carat for LGD is $198.22 for 10MFY24, whereas the natural diamond pricing per carat is $4357 for 10MFY24.\n\nE-commerce marketplace Myntra Chooses Bollywood actor Ayushmann Khurrana to be the brand ambassador for the American lifestyle brand, Nautica in India.

What was once exclusive and financially prohibitive has now become inclusive and accessible, thanks to the rise of fast fashion. This revolution in the fashion industry has not only democratized style but has also empowered individuals from all walks of life to express their unique personalities and embrace the latest trends without breaking the bank.\n\nIn India, the approach to fashion and luxury clothing often reflects a blend of tradition, practicality, and evolving trends. While there is a growing appreciation for luxury brands and high-end fashion, many Indians still carefully consider their purchases, especially when it comes to clothing. Factors such as price, value for money, and the cultural significance of the garment often influence buying decisions. As a result, fast fashion has gained significant traction in India, offering a wide range of trendy and affordable options that cater to diverse tastes and budgets.\n\nThrough affordable pricing, quick turnover of trends, diverse choices, seasonal sales, and the convenience of online shopping, fast fashion brands have democratized style and fashion. This accessibility empowers individuals to experiment with different styles, update their wardrobes regularly, and stay current with fashion trends without the need for expensive designer pieces. As a result, fast fashion has not only transformed the way people approach fashion but has also fostered creativity, self-expression, and confidence in personal style choices, regardless of budgetary constraints.\n\nThe contribution of e-commerce in the fast fashion industry-\n\nE-commerce has played a key role in the fast fashion industry, acting as a catalyst for its exponential growth and widespread accessibility. One of the most notable advantages is the global reach that online platforms provide, allowing fast fashion brands to transcend geographical boundaries and connect with a diverse customer base worldwide. This expanded reach not only increases brand visibility but also opens up new market opportunities, enabling brands to tap into emerging fashion trends and consumer preferences across different regions. Moreover, the 24/7 accessibility of e-commerce platforms has transformed the shopping experience for consumers, offering the convenience of browsing, purchasing, and receiving products at any time, from anywhere. This round-the-clock accessibility has significantly contributed to the industry's sales volume and customer engagement, as shoppers can effortlessly explore the latest fashion offerings and make purchases according to their schedules and preferences.\n\nThe instillation of oneness through fast fashion-\n\nFast fashion has instilled a sense of oneness within the fashion world through its inclusive practices and global influences. By offering diverse sizing options and featuring models of various backgrounds in marketing campaigns, fast fashion brands promote inclusivity and celebrate the beauty of cultural diversity. Additionally, the affordability of fast fashion allows people from different socio-economic backgrounds to participate in current trends and express their style, fostering a sense of unity and belonging. Collaborative efforts, cultural exchange, and mutual appreciation for different styles further contribute to creating a collective environment where individuals can embrace their uniqueness while celebrating shared fashion experiences and expressions.\n\nHow fast Fashion has empowered confidence through stylish choices?\n\nFast fashion has profoundly impacted people’s lives by democratizing style and instilling confidence through accessible, trendy clothing options. By swiftly replicating runway trends at affordable prices, fast fashion brands enable individuals to stay updated with the latest fashion while encouraging experimentation and creativity in styling. This accessibility fosters a sense of curiosity and exploration, empowering individuals to express their unique identities authentically. Moreover, the versatility of fast fashion allows for mix-and-match possibilities, contributing to the development of individualized, signature styles that reflect personal preferences. With inclusivity and representation at the forefront, fast fashion promotes a positive self-image and boosts confidence by offering diverse sizing options and featuring models from various backgrounds, fostering a sense of belonging and acceptance within the fashion community.\n\nThe impact of fast fashion in India-\n\nFast fashion has had an overpowering impact on India's fashion landscape, ushering in a new era of accessibility, consumer behavior shifts, economic growth, and cultural influence. Firstly, it has democratized fashion by making trendy clothing and accessories accessible to a wider demographic, breaking down barriers to style expression across various socio-economic backgrounds. This accessibility has led to a change in consumer behavior, with individuals now expecting constant variety and affordability in fashion offerings, prompting retailers to adapt and innovate.\n\nThe retail sector has experienced significant growth, both in physical stores and online platforms, creating employment opportunities and driving economic development within the industry. Fast fashion has also catalyzed innovation and competition in India's fashion scene, with local designers and brands striving to stay relevant and compete on a global scale. Moreover, it has influenced cultural expression by blending traditional elements with modern trends, creating unique fashion statements that reflect India's diverse heritage and contemporary influences.\n\nOverall, the rise of fast fashion has paved the way for a more inclusive and diverse fashion landscape, where individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds can come together to celebrate their individuality and express themselves through their style.

It’s appliqued and collaged with hand embroidered textiles and metal detailing from the ateliers of Sabyasachi. The artwork is framed with embroidered textiles on hard oak wood.\n\n“I was born in 1974, a time devoid of the internet where television was the sole medium of entertainment.

I’m so happy to be collaborating with Disney that has brought boundless joy to audiences worldwide for a century,\" said Sabyasachi.\n\nSpeaking about the inspiration behind his artwork, he added, “My creation, known as 'Namaste Mickey,' draws inspiration from India's rich tapestry of traditional and miniature paintings.

Sutlej Textiles has been a force to reckon with in India's cotton yarn industry. A faction of the same and a brand for the young home owners is Nesterra with its offering of new-age fabric.\n\nThe core idea for Nesterra has always been incorporating unique personalities of buyers, said Smita Joshi, VP of Home Textiles and Design Expert, Nesterra. \"I’d use a trim differently than you would. So, Trims incorporates personal preferences in the curtains category to enhance its appearance,\" she added. From the most simplistic to highly decorated embroidery, Nesterra shares a wide range of trims that are customisable via retail partners.\n\nEntering a highly cluttered market, that too in pandemic, was a daunting task for Nesterra, which differentiated it's offerings with lesser number of collections for retailers for ease of brand discovery by customers. Customers, maintained Joshi, can use multiple ways such as sharing a color scheme, the price range, or even answer a 10-point questionnaire to get to the fabric of their choices.\n\n\"A lot of our competition originate from brands in UK and Europe. American brands, lesser in number, trends mostly on the casual side. Millennials, well traveled, need a pop of colors and a dash of style but also seek comfort. Nesterra brings in that casual, homelike feeling, as we design for the layers of your personality, and thus focus on emotional intelligence instead of obvious product specifics such as fabric,\" added Joshi.\n\nShouldering the responsibility of the KK Birla brand value, Nesterra always comes up with innovative ATL/BTL campaigns to tap into emotions. For instance their recent Raksha Bandhan campaign at Infinity Mall, Malad, held pillow fight contests for siblings that brought participants back to the road down nostalgia. To amp up the excitement, Nesterra kept it as a content also on social media with an attractive contest plan, thus spreading the campaign's reach beyond its headquarters in Mumbai. When it comes to social media, Joshi believes that Instagram is bang for the buck with its healthy reach and profitable arrangements with various influencers depending on at-home demonstrations or product displays by the influencers themselves.\n\nBeyond Mumbai, the brand has good presence across Ahmedabad in Gujarat, Delhi-NCR, the southern India and Jammu & Kashmir. Acing the game of local communication for southern states on the own hand and choosing stocking options to duck logistical hurdles in J&K, the brand has nurtured the said markets masterfully.
