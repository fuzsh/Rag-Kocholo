Fast Facts

As Boston’s immediate southern suburb, Quincy is a large city with varied attractions. It is the birthplace of two U.S. Presidents, John Adams and his son John Quincy Adams as well as the first signer of the Declaration of Independence, John Hancock. After its incorporation in 1792, the town thrived thanks to a successful granite industry and the Granite Railway, the United States’ first commercial railroad. Beloved Howard Johnson’s and Dunkin’ Donuts were also founded in this beautiful city in the early 20th century. Notable people from Quincy include Clara Blandick, better known as “Auntie Em” in The Wizard of Oz, Peter Del Vecho, Oscar-winning producer of Frozen, and one of Boston’s favorite bands, the Dropkick Murphys.
