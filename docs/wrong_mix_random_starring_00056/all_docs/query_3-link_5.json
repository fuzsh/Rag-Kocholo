        "text": "Living in New England, there's no shortage of historic places to explore. There's something fascinating about walking in the footsteps of those who came before us and exploring old homes, battlefields, graveyards, and more.\n\nVisitors to Quincy, Massachusetts, are particularly lucky, as their town was once the home of two US presidents: Founding Father John Adams (1735-1826), and his eldest son John Quincy Adams (1767-1848).\n\nYou can visit the homes of John Adams and his family thanks to a fascinating collection of tours run by the Adams National Historic Park. This writer went on a Full Park Guided Tour last year, and cannot recommend it enough.\n\nSo, what can you expect on a tour?\n\n1. John Adams and John Quincy Adams Birthplaces\n\nYour first stop will be at the John and John Quincy Adams Birthplaces. The first home (shown below) is where John Adams was born and raised, according to the Historic Park's website.\n\nThe second home (also shown below) sits feet from the first, and is where John settled down with his wife, Abigail. The site explains that within the home's walls, John drafted the Massachusetts Constitution during the American Revolution. It's also where future 6th president John Quincy Adams was born.\n\n2. The Old House at Peace Field\n\nSoon before being elected vice president of the United States in 1789 (he'd eventually become our second president in 1797), John would move with Abigail into this gorgeous house at Peace Field. Unlike the two previous homes, everything inside this place is original...\n\n...from gorgeous sitting rooms...\n\n...to John's office.\n\nThis is the very cane the man used. Original portraits, busts, dinnerware, and books are also present.\n\nAnd of course we can't forget the Stone Library, which houses a collection of John Quincy Adams' books.\n\n3. The Adams Crypt\n\nThis stop is not included on the tour, but since you're already in the area, it's worth checking out. After leaving Peace Field, you're just a short drive away from United First Parish Church, which is the final resting place of John Adams, Abigail Adams, John Quincy Adams, and Louisa Catherine Adams. It's a moving conclusion to your trip back in time.\n\nFor more information about tours through the Adams National Historic Park, click here.\n\nCharming $1.6M Colonial is Two Historic New England Homes in One"
