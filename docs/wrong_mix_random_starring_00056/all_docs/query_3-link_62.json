        "text": "Where is PorchFest Quincy?\n\nPorchFest Quincy will be held in the Wollaston Hill, Squantum, and Merrymount neighborhoods.\n\nHow were these PorchFest Neighborhoods chosen?\n\nNeighborhoods were chosen where we found the most interest when we started. Our mission is to bring people together to build community through the shared experience of music. PorchFest is designed to allow people to walk around in a contiguous area where they can enjoy multiple performers throughout the day and meet new people.\n\nWhen Ian and Wally originally launched PorchFest Quincy in 2016, they intended to do so in their neighborhood on Wollaston Hill. Little did they know the event would bring so much interest from around the city, and that a substantial number of homes in Squantum and Merrymount would volunteer and later be added to the event.\n\nCan you bring PorchFest to my Neighborhood?\n\nHonestly? It depends.\n\nIt is very important to us that our volunteer bands, who donate their time and talent, have a good audience. By keeping the performances close together, the bands have larger audiences enjoying their music, and attendees can more easily walk and enjoy the music.\n\nIf we expand the event, we need to be sure that there are enough hosts interested in any given neighborhood AND that we have enough additional bands to match with all of our gracious hosts. Unfortunately, based on prior experience, we learned that one-offs or a small number of hosts and bands in any area do not work for the continuity of the event.\n\nHow do I volunteer my band to play at PorchFest?\n\nWe generally open registrations through this website on April 1st. Please sign-up to our email list (above), follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to stay in touch and be notified about registrations. We will create the schedule and assign bands to your porch if it is in our festival neighborhoods.\n\nCan bands from outside of Quincy perform at PorchFest Quincy?\n\nAbsolutely! Bands from all over perform at PorchFest Quincy and we encourage everyone to join us.\n\nHow do I volunteer my porch to host a band?\n\nWe generally open and accept registrations through this website on April 1st. Please sign-up to our email list (above), follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to stay in touch and be notified about registrations. We will create the schedule and assign you to a porch in our festival neighborhoods.\n\nHow do I volunteer my band to play on my own porch?\n\nRegister your band through our website (above) and provide your address in the “preferred porch” field on the registration form. Please also let us know in the comments that your preferred porch is your own porch.\n\nPlease note that 1) the PorchFest team still needs to coordinate your performance time to make sure it does not conflict with other nearby performances, and 2) if your porch is not located within the festival area we would be happy to host your band at one of our festival hosts.\n\nWhen is PorchFest?\n\nWe publish the date and time of PorchFest each year at the top of this website, and via email and social media. Please sign-up to our email list (above), follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to stay in touch and be notified about PorchFest. The date can vary but we generally plan for the last Saturday in June, though the pandemic has changed our plans a few times.\n\nEating and drinking?\n\nYou are welcome to bring your own food and beverages, but public alcohol laws still apply during PorchFest. Also, please remember that each venue is someone's home, so please be sure to clean up after yourself.\n\nWe generally arrange for some food trucks - see the schedule/map for details.\n\nBeer and Wine?\n\nPorchFest does not have an officially contained festival area. The entire event takes place in individually owned yards and the public streets in between. When in public, you are subject to the usual laws regarding alcohol consumption and open containers. Please observe these laws and be safe.\n\nIs there a hashtag? Social Media?\n\nPlease post your photos and videos using this hashtag: #porchfestquincy\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PorchFestQuincy\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/porchfestquincy\n\nX: @PorchFestQuincy\n\nWill there be bathrooms?\n\nWe are arranging for a few Porta-Potties - please see the map when the schedule is released a few days prior to the event on this website.. PorchFest music locations are neighbors’ private homes, and they will not provide any facilities for public use.\n\nIs there a rain date?\n\nThere is no rain date. We are from New England.\n\nAre you closing the streets during this festival?\n\nThere will be a few street closures, but for the most part, the streets are open to both drivers and pedestrians. If you must drive near the PorchFest performance locations, please use caution and drive slowly. Any neighborhood that would like to apply for a permit to close streets during PorchFest may, of course, do so on their own. The application for a block party permit can be found here.\n\nAre dogs allowed?\n\nDifferent homeowners will likely have different preferences when it comes to dogs on their property, so please be aware of and sensitive to that. In public spaces, the rules are the same as they'd be any other time. You can learn more about the City of Quincy Animal Control ordinances here.\n\nI registered my band and/or porch. What happens next?\n\nThe final performance schedule is generally published a few days before the event. Here is our 2024 timeline until then:"
