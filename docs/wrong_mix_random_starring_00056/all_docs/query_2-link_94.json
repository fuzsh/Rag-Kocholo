        "text": "T.S. Eliot had his “social function of poetry” and we have social media – YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. etc.\n\nCould it be that what we celebrate as the art of our times is not Art at all? If so, What is Art?\n\nAt best, our culture has relegated Art to the dubious field of “entertainment” – hijacked from its true purpose, left to serve as a decoration on the public walls of high society museums and the private walls of wealthy collectors. At best, art is fashion.\n\nWait, wait, wait.\n\nJohn Seely Brown’s latest newsletter takes us to task by raising an important point:\n\n“Artists are not included in our debate on how we build\n\nthe economy for the future. They’re excluded in our nation’s emphasis on innovation which has been left to the STEM crowd. We’re not thinking about designing for emergence. Innovation is about seeing the world differently. Who is better at helping us see the world differently than the artists?”\n\nWhy is this? I can think of three reasons:\n\n1) The “art” made by “artists” is irrelevant\n\n2) The “artists” are not Artists\n\n3) Art is generally devalued in a society polarized by Science, Fashion, and Politics\n\nAlright, I’m being a bit silly, but here is someone who’s not: Ben Davis and his 9.5 Theses on Art and Class (h/t Doug Smith) serve as both an indictment and a wake-up call for artists everywhere. Have a look at this excerpt:\n\n2.0 Today, the ruling class, which is capitalist, dominates\n\nthe sphere of the visual arts\n\n2.1 It is part of the definition of a ruling class that it\n\ncontrols the material resources of society\n\n2.2 The ruling ideologies, which serve to reproduce this material situation, also represent the interests of the ruling class\n\n2.3 The dominant values given to art, therefore, will be\n\nones that serve the interests of the current ruling class\n\n2.4 Concretely, within the sphere of the contemporary visual\n\narts, the agents whose interests determine the dominant values of art are: large corporations, including auction houses and corporate collectors; art investors, private collectors and patrons; trustees and administrators of large cultural institutions and universities\n\n2.5 One role for art, therefore, is as a luxury good, whose\n\nsuperior craftsmanship or intellectual prestige indicates superior social status\n\n2.6 Another role for art is to serve as financial instrument\n\nor tradable repository of value\n\n2.7 Another role for art is as sign of “giving back” to the\n\ncommunity, to whitewash ill-gotten gains\n\n2.8 Another role for art is symbolic escape valve for\n\nradical impulses, to serve as a place to isolate and contain social energy that runs counter to the dominant ideology\n\n2.9 A final role for art is the self-replication of\n\nruling-class ideology about art itself–the dominant values given to art serve not only to enact ruling-class values directly, but also to subjugate, within the sphere of the arts, other possible values of art\n\nOK. But why are artists banished from the Republic?\n\nOne can argue (via Ben Franklin) that the last artist was Jesus and before him Socrates. I’d add folks like Gandhi, Malcolm X, Mandela, Marley… The artist sees differently. Not just paintings on a wall, but society itself. Who paints our vision for society today? Lady Gaga or our lobbyists?\n\nWalker Percy saw the artist (or writer) as a canary in the coal mine. The artist as prophet. But we are deaf to the canary. We’ve banned our artists from society – not by muzzling them with threats and jail time, but by turning them into designers of consumer and fashion goods.\n\nFor the first time in history, we’ve made art useful as a financial commodity- and killed it in the process.\n\nMeanwhile, somewhere, hidden from the lights of Sotheby’s and Christie’s, art is still being made.\n\nFrom Harold Pinter – Nobel Lecture\n\nArt, Truth & Politics\n\n© THE NOBEL FOUNDATION 2005\n\nIn 1958 I wrote the following:\n\n‘There are no hard distinctions between what is real and what is unreal, nor between what is true and what is false. A thing is not necessarily either true or false; it can be both true and false.’\n\nI believe that these assertions still make sense and do still apply to the exploration of reality through art. So as a writer I stand by them but as a citizen I cannot. As a citizen I must ask: What is true? What is false?\n\nTruth in drama is forever elusive. You never quite find it but the search for it is compulsive. The search is clearly what drives the endeavour. The search is your task. More often than not you stumble upon the truth in the dark, colliding with it or just glimpsing an image or a shape which seems to correspond to the truth, often without realising that you have done so. But the real truth is that there never is any such thing as one truth to be found in dramatic art. There are many. These truths challenge each other, recoil from each other, reflect each other, ignore each other, tease each other, are blind to each other. Sometimes you feel you have the truth of a moment in your hand, then it slips through your fingers and is lost.\n\nI have often been asked how my plays come about. I cannot say. Nor can I ever sum up my plays, except to say that this is what happened. That is what they said. That is what they did.\n\n…….\n\nI have said earlier that the United States is now totally frank about putting its cards on the table. That is the case. Its official declared policy is now defined as ‘full spectrum dominance’. That is not my term, it is theirs. ‘Full spectrum dominance’ means control of land, sea, air and space and all attendant resources.\n\nThe United States now occupies 702 military installations throughout the world in 132 countries, with the honourable exception of Sweden, of course. We don’t quite know how they got there but they are there all right.\n\nThe United States possesses 8,000 active and operational nuclear warheads. Two thousand are on hair trigger alert, ready to be launched with 15 minutes warning. It is developing new systems of nuclear force, known as bunker busters. The British, ever cooperative, are intending to replace their own nuclear missile, Trident. Who, I wonder, are they aiming at? Osama bin Laden? You? Me? Joe Dokes? China? Paris? Who knows? What we do know is that this infantile insanity – the possession and threatened use of nuclear weapons – is at the heart of present American political philosophy. We must remind ourselves that the United States is on a permanent military footing and shows no sign of relaxing it.\n\nMany thousands, if not millions, of people in the United States itself are demonstrably sickened, shamed and angered by their government’s actions, but as things stand they are not a coherent political force – yet. But the anxiety, uncertainty and fear which we can see growing daily in the United States is unlikely to diminish.\n\nI know that President Bush has many extremely competent speech writers but I would like to volunteer for the job myself. I propose the following short address which he can make on television to the nation. I see him grave, hair carefully combed, serious, winning, sincere, often beguiling, sometimes employing a wry smile, curiously attractive, a man’s man.\n\n‘God is good. God is great. God is good. My God is good. Bin Laden’s God is bad. His is a bad God. Saddam’s God was bad, except he didn’t have one. He was a barbarian. We are not barbarians. We don’t chop people’s heads off. We believe in freedom. So does God. I am not a barbarian. I am the democratically elected leader of a freedom-loving democracy. We are a compassionate society. We give compassionate electrocution and compassionate lethal injection. We are a great nation. I am not a dictator. He is. I am not a barbarian. He is. And he is. They all are. I possess moral authority. You see this fist? This is my moral authority. And don’t you forget it.’\n\nA writer’s life is a highly vulnerable, almost naked activity. We don’t have to weep about that. The writer makes his choice and is stuck with it. But it is true to say that you are open to all the winds, some of them icy indeed. You are out on your own, out on a limb. You find no shelter, no protection – unless you lie – in which case of course you have constructed your own protection and, it could be argued, become a politician.\n\nI have referred to death quite a few times this evening. I shall now quote a poem of my own called ‘Death’.\n\nWhere was the dead body found?\n\nWho found the dead body?\n\nWas the dead body dead when found?\n\nHow was the dead body found?\n\nWho was the dead body?\n\nWho was the father or daughter or brother\n\nOr uncle or sister or mother or son\n\nOf the dead and abandoned body?\n\nWas the body dead when abandoned?\n\nWas the body abandoned?\n\nBy whom had it been abandoned?\n\nWas the dead body naked or dressed for a journey?\n\nWhat made you declare the dead body dead?\n\nDid you declare the dead body dead?\n\nHow well did you know the dead body?\n\nHow did you know the dead body was dead?\n\nDid you wash the dead body\n\nDid you close both its eyes\n\nDid you bury the body\n\nDid you leave it abandoned\n\nDid you kiss the dead body\n\nWhen we look into a mirror we think the image that confronts us is accurate. But move a millimetre and the image changes. We are actually looking at a never-ending range of reflections. But sometimes a writer has to smash the mirror – for it is on the other side of that mirror that the truth stares at us.\n\nI believe that despite the enormous odds which exist, unflinching, unswerving, fierce intellectual determination, as citizens, to define the real truth of our lives and our societies is a crucial obligation which devolves upon us all. It is in fact mandatory.\n\nIf such a determination is not embodied in our political vision we have no hope of restoring what is so nearly lost to us – the dignity of man.\n\n…\n\nRead the whole thing and weep.\n\n…"
