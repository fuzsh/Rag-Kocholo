It is not virgin soil, like the drama of the north which has so lately caught the ear of Europe. This, perhaps, accounts for its lack of distinctive originality. For even in Echegaray's notable plays, strong and original as they are, there is an unmistakable ring of the past. We feel it is more a revival than a youthful outburst, with all the promise of novelty. True, it is dominated by the modern need and its restless searching note; it must prove its mission as something more than the mere desire to divert. Not even a sermon could be more remote than this theatre from the old comedy of manners, of loose morals and diverting intrigue, all weighing as lightly on the dramatist's conscience as on the audience's. And it may be questioned if Echegaray, a professor of mathematics as well as a dramatist and poet, could be induced to accept Mr. Stevenson's well-known and not inappropriate classification of the artist as of the family of Daughters of Joy. His is no neutral voice between vice and virtue, concerned solely for the pleasure or viinterest of the hour, suing approbation through laughter and wit, or sympathy through dramatic tears. Lest his audience should fail to carry their musings on the problems of life to the theatre in the proper modern spirit, he starts by pricking their conscience and exciting thought that as little relieves them from the pressure of reality as one of Ibsen's plays—though with the latter his having nothing else in common but this determined purpose.\n\nJosé Echegaray was born at Madrid in 1832. The years of childhood were passed in Murcia, where at the university he studied and took out his degrees. His tendency in youth was towards the exact sciences, with which he still coquets in the same spirit of pride that pushed Goethe to glory in his devotion to painting. He more readily offers to his friends a volume of his Modern Theories of Physics or the Union of Material Forces by which he is known to a select few, than one of his popular dramas. Of the scientific value of these works I am not in a position to offer any opinion. For career, he chose that of engineer, and, we are told, gave evidence in this line of quite exceptional diligence and quickness. Certain it is that in this department as well as in others that followed, he has amply proved that in individual circumstances the Don may be carried into a permanent frenzy of industry. In 1853 his studies in engineering terminated. Echegaray was appointed successively to posts in various provinces, until he returned to Madrid as professor of the School of Engineers. Here he taught theoretical and applied viimathematics, and while building up a serious reputation in science, he found time to study political economy, and devour every form of literature, thus preparing for his future honours as poet and dramatist. He took part in the revolution of 1868, and was appointed Director of Public Works and Minister of Commerce. This post he resigned in 1872, and shortly afterwards that of Minister of Finances, which he was forced to give up on proclamation of the Republic. Then he emigrated to Paris, where he composed his first play El Libro Talonario. In 1874 the political situation permitted his return to Spain, and he was nominated Minister for the third time. After that he began to hold himself more and more aloof from public life, and took to writing for the theatre with prodigious activity. Well advanced in middle age, he seems to have taken Lope de Vega for his model in the matter of production. Within twenty years he has written more than fifty plays. In a letter before me, he offers me a choice of his recent plays (whose appearance can only cover a couple of years, I believe), and thus names them off:—El Critico Incipiente, Los Dos Fanatismos, El Haroldo, El Milagro en Egipto, Siempre en Ridiculo, Sic vos non vobis, etc. etc., the double etc. suggesting at least half a dozen more, I suppose.\n\nThis fatal facility is one of the drawbacks of Spanish talent. The race writes without difficulty, which perhaps is the reason that it writes without finish or distinction. Add to which in adopting French romanticism, upon which wave it was irresistibly carried, it viiidid but accommodate the adoption of the natural bent of its own still mediæval nature. For modern Spanish romanticism belongs more probably to the sixteenth than to the nineteenth century. It is interesting to note the rebound with which Victor Hugo's bell cast this semi-civilised and dreaming people back into their own appropriate century. They prate to-day in Madrid glibly enough of English improvements, clubs, electricity, French vaudevilles, and all the pernicious refinements of our modern civilisation. But these elements are extraneous, a sort of diverting masquerade in their daily life. At heart they are purely mediæval. In all the great moments on and off the stage, they forget the silk hat and coat of civilisation, and walk and talk as if a sword still absurdly cocked the cloak of romance.\n\nIn this hour, when foreign Shakespeares are springing up around us with incredible profusion, it would be an agreeable task to come forward with a Spanish Shakespeare. But Don José Echegaray is no such thing. He bears no resemblance to the new geniuses hailed with such delight. He has none of the subtlety of Maeterlinck, and certainly offers entertainment by means of tricks less reminiscent of our start in modern languages. His literary baggage reveals neither the depth nor the flashes of luminous thought with which Ibsen startles us through an obscurity of atmosphere, a childish baldness, and an unconventional disregard of all the old-fashioned theories upon which the laws of dramatic criticism have been formed. But if Echegaray is less original, he is creditably more sane. The lack of depth ixcarries with it a corresponding absence of crudeness and of an artlessness often so bewildering as to leave us imperfectly capable of distinguishing the extreme fineness of the line between genius and insanity. The lucid air of the south clarifies thought, and produces nothing less sober than Latin bombast and the high-phrased moods of the Don.\n\nWhat is more to be deplored in Echegaray's plays is the absence of French art. An artist in the polished, complete sense he cannot be described. He has none of the French dramatist's incision, none of his delicate irony, his playfulness and humorous depravity, none of his beautiful clarity of expression, still less of his polish, his wit, and consummate dexterity. Poetry is his favourite form of dramatic expression, but it is not the suave measured poetry of M. Richepin; and while he often takes his inspiration from the Middle Ages, he offers us nothing like the ethereal and fanciful verse of M. Armand Silvestre, when that author condescends to forget that he is fin de siècle, and seeks to please through the sweetness and delicacy of some mediæval legend. Echegaray is poet enough to delight in these thrilling ages. But his treatment of them generally leaves us cold. It lacks fancy and buoyancy. Sombre passion does not adequately fill the place of absent humour. It is often thin and false, and glaringly artificial, like the mediæval romance of an inefficient author. It is a remarkable fact that such a play as Mar sin Orillas (Shoreless Sea) should have achieved popularity in a town so imitatively, not intellectually, modern xas Madrid. It has no originality whatever, and offers nothing as compensation for dulness. It is of the Middle Ages, but without the captivating atmosphere of those plumed and belted centuries. It runs complacently along the old dusty highroad; swords clash, knights march off to glory and the Turkish wars, and beauty at home struggles with parental enmity, is sore distraught and belied, and while we are reminded in the high tone of the ancient singers, that\n\nwe are confused by the stupidity of everybody.\n\nThis repertory is extended, but can hardly be called varied. The one note of undiluted drama runs through all, and while the poet declaims upon a lofty level, it may be said that he chiefly reaches poetry through means of the felicitous vocables of the language he has the privilege to write, rather than by reason of any real genius as a poet. He is concerned more with striking situations than with development or revelation of character. In this line he is totally lacking in diversity and subtlety. He apprehends woman in none other but the crude, mediæval form. To him she is simply a personality of divine and inexhaustible love—an exalted and inalterable ideal; and whether she wears modern raiment or the garb of remote centuries, she is never anything but a spiritualised stain-glass outline, which affords gross and barbaric males—Velasquez' heroes and high-toned villains—much opportunity to rant of saints and angels, and is a subject for continuous worship, ill-treatment, misunderstanding, and devotion to death.\n\nxiThe very titles of these plays have a fine melodramatic ring—The Avenger's Bride, On the Sword's Point, In the Bosom of Death, and Death upon the Lips, etc. In Spanish the titles are beautiful and inspiring enough to justify choice. En el Seno de la Muerte is a particularly impressive play, which rings imagination back into the thirteenth century almost upon a thrill with its strong Hugoesque tinge of romance. There is no fluted fervour of lovers, no thrum of lute or impassioned sequidilla to enliven the roll of solemn wedded passion and betrayal. Remorse and stern hidalgic resentment stalk the stage grandiloquently to the blare of trumpets, royal entrances and exits, and the hum of the Roussillon wars. We have the inevitable struggle between love and duty, the inevitable sombre judgment and full-dress sentiments of virtue. Echegaray has apparently no understanding of vice except as subject for castigation. The bastard Manfred, beloved of his legitimate brother and seignor, loves his sister-in-law Beatrix. Don Jaime, the injured husband, has all the noble and melancholy charm of a Velasquez portrait, the model upon which the dramatist would seem to have drawn his unvarying study of the Middle Ages Don. They all carry their black velvet and plumes with the same high air, seem equally unacquainted with smiles and the lighter emotions, and breathe the same unapproachable perfection in domestic life. For each one the wife is sovereign lady, and if they betray anger, it is the anger of heroes who never forget that they are hidalgoes, and who are incapable of falling, upon any provocation, into triviality or pleasantry of speech. Small blame to the xiiladies of such lords if they sometimes forget their oath of allegiance, and occasionally decline upon lesser natures. However picturesque, as housemates these Velasquez gentlemen are beyond endurance, and deserve to perish victims of their own relentless nobility.\n\nDon Jaime adored his wife and loved his half-brother. Both in turn loved him, and recognised to the full his claim upon their mutual admiration. But this was naturally no impediment to their own frailty, though not even Echegaray's sinners are for one moment permitted to give a cheerful aspect to sin. It is perhaps a double unwisdom to stoop to folly when they mean to be so persistently miserable over it. Certain it is, that in this case the lady's choice cannot have been prompted by any desire for a lively change. Manfred is only a more scowling, discontented edition of the legitimate Don. 'You are sadder than ever, and your hand avoids the touch of mine,' he complains to Beatrix in the beginning of the second act. And she replies: 'I am ever sad. Sorrow is throned within my bosom, and so imperious is its possession, that death alone can free its slave.' And then when Manfred prays for death as a mutual deliverance, she reproaches him: 'Does my love not then suffice you? If so, live and enjoy it, or confess that of our sin the vase only contains the bitterness, the shame and the disenchantment.'\n\nManfred. Your love is but a lie, since I strain in my embrace naught but a cold and inert marble statue. While your soul, your mind, yourself—all that I most fondly love eludes the touch of my lips, and my heart hears the disdainful murmur: 'This is not for the bastard.'\n\nxiiiBeatrix. 'Tis not so. You do not understand me.\n\nManfred. Yes, I understand you. You have only loved Jaime.\n\nBeatrix. So deeply have I loved you, Manfred, that I have forsaken Jaime, noble as he is, for you who are so base. I have given myself to you, drawn by the attraction of the abyss which is your love. And I thought that I could live and be happy under cover of my sin, but it may not be. For ever between my breast and your arms he interposes.\n\nThey try to persuade themselves upon insufficient evidence that Jaime is dead, but Beatrix, the more nervous and impressionable of the two, endures the conviction of her senses that her husband lives as the added torture of fear to insistent remorse. Every sound that disturbs the silence, as they sit together by the fire, carries menace of his approach. 'Why are we not happy since we love one another?' Manfred bitterly cries, interrupting her terrified listening. Here is the keynote of Echegaray's philosophy, whether he marshals the dead centuries before us, or treats of the modern conscience. Even in the less complex ages, when the world was younger and fresher, he will not hear of obedience to instinct unpunished before even the fruit has had time to turn to ashes.\n\nWe understand that we are commanded to contemplate unrelieved gloom of sentiment and situation upon the entrance of Don Jaime, back from the Roussillon wars in company with Don Pedro, king of Aragon. The guilty lovers have an enemy in one Juana, the duenna and wife of Roger, the squire, who, discovering Beatrix and Manfred in a passionate embrace, is set upon by the infuriated bastard and inadvertently driven upon the sword's point xivinto the family vault, where the door slams upon him with a secret spring. When Manfred has excited the king's anger by scornful rejection of the favour of a name and title that shall give him equality with his brother, we realise that the hour is a favourable one for Juana's accusation. Whatever rights a sovereign may arrogate to himself in the matter of his own morals, he is usually a keen arbitrator of the limitations of those of his subjects. On this principle, Don Pedro shows himself merciless to the sinners, though one happens to be his hostess and the other his host's much-loved brother. A rational man would have preferred to blink and turn away, with the safe conclusion that it was, after all, none of his business. But monarchs are allowed so many other attributes, that even out of Spain they may be fitly dispensed with reason. In an interview with the culprits, when a saner man would have been touched with the generous strife between them as to which should bear the blame and punishment, he decides that both shall die. Upon Manfred's petition, he consents that Jaime shall live in ignorance of his wrong, but the poor fool, for all his crown, was not sufficiently master of events to contrive this rash promise. Spanish history may furnish a precedent of such a situation, but we are not taught that the lives of the monarchs of the land explain it adequately. When Jaime enters and remonstrates with Don Pedro:—'I am her owner, sir. All your power, your crown, your greatness, the glory of Sicily and of the entire world—what are they against Beatrix! But smoke and dust,'—the king commutes her sentence to perpetual imprisonment, and orders the execution xvof Manfred in Barcelona. Upon this Jaime threatens to carry both away with him, forswear his king and country, and cross the frontier. A violent quarrel ensues between him and the king, and in the midst of recriminations, Don Pedro casts his dishonour in the teeth of his angry subject. The unfortunate nobleman, dazed and incredulous, reads Roger's letter, given him by Don Pedro, and falls into a spiritless despair. He asks his sovereign's pardon, and they part reconciled friends. Left alone by the family vault at night, he bursts into a sonorous soliloquy. We remember a somewhat similar situation in Victor Hugo, and are irritated by the reminiscence. There is a natural note in his simple cry to Beatrix to speak to him before she dies—to lie, feign, accuse him,—only speak. Also in the speech to Manfred that follows, when he recalls the time they were playmates together, and then tells bitterly the roll of his wrongs: 'It were kinder to kill me at once,' Manfred cries impetuously. By a curious ineffectuality, a lack of skill, it however falls just short of real pathos. Echegaray is never simple enough to reach pathos. The climax has a false ring. Manfred dies by his own hand, and, following his example, Jaime stabs himself, and falls near him, in the shadow of the tomb.\n\nD. Jaime. Manfred, too, lies dead, and you shortly will follow us. When you die, where will you fall?\n\nBeatrix. By your side.\n\nD. Jaime. Then come closer—'tis no lie? Answer. [Clasps her.]\n\nBeatrix. No.\n\nD. Jaime. And where will your tears flow?\n\nxviBeatrix. Over your body.\n\nD. Jaime. Then see. You must embrace my inert body. Do not cease weeping—so that—thus we drop into the bosom of death.\n\nDeath on his Lips takes us into quite another atmosphere. We are in foreign lands, on the distant shore of Lake Geneva, in the heart of the Calvinist Inquisition. The Don is introduced, but only as an exile, in the person of Miguel Servet, a famous Aragonese doctor who was martyred at Geneva in 1553. The Calvinists are painted in befitting blackness by a Spaniard, naturally glad of an opportunity to show that other lands had their Inquisition as well as Spain, and cruelty in those days was to be found as fierce elsewhere. It is a gloomy, a powerful, but not a very interesting play. Servet is well contrasted with the Genevese, the heaviness of the one race being dexterously made to appear so much less amiable and well-mannered than that of the other. The heroine, Margarita (naturally), is the usual heroine of Echegaray's choice—all heart, devotion, generosity, sincerity, and a certain broad intelligence. He may be trusted not to choose a fool, though he may never aspire to striking originality in his portrayal of what he evidently regards as the angelic sex.\n\nOn the Sword's Point attains a higher level of dramatic thought. Doña Violante is married to Don Rodrigo—the inevitable Velasquez, in plumes and black velvet. In the first bloom of youth, a titled blackguard had surprised and dishonoured her, and Fernando, her son, is the unsuspected offspring of this shame. He is a fine-spirited xviiyoung fellow, more fiery and blusterous than the implacably dignified Rodrigo. He loves, and is beloved by, Laura, the ward of his parents. An unconscious vein of humour runs through the pompous scene, in which he is found by these latter on his knees before the girl. Don Rodrigo is shocked at such indelicate boldness—just like the amusing Marquis in The Sorcerer. 'They love each other,' Doña Violante expostulates. 'It is necessary to be severe with youth,' the Don replies, repressing his indignation at the bidding of his wife. Then he proceeds to point out to Fernando that henceforth Laura's honour must be as dear to him as his own, and after an eulogy on the virtue of the ladies of his house, he explains that if the stain of dishonour dimmed the splendour of the name of Moncada in a woman, it would be the duty of her husband, father, or brother to kill her on the spot. This is not lively talk for Doña Violante, but life was not a lively matter for women in those dull days—especially in Spain, where it still is the reverse of exciting for them. The young man's ardent youth puzzles Don Rodrigo, it is so unlike his own, and these perplexities are disturbed by the titled blackguard's sudden claim to Laura's hand—whom he describes as a mixture of Turkish houri and Christian virgin. Thereupon ensues a painful scene between the victim and the wrong-doer. The titled blackguard shows himself susceptible of the feelings of a gentleman, and deplores the sin of his rash youth—does he also not wear black velvet and a plumed cap? However, he has no mind to renounce his claim to Laura's hand though Doña Violante kneel to him, and Fernando xviiiswagger about with unsheathed steel. The duenna and the squire (from whom a little humour might not unreasonably be expected if it were possible to convict so serious a philosopher as the author with anything like deliberate pleasantry) contrive to muddle the carriage of Doña Violante's passionate letter to her betrayer, speaking of the fatal night with lamentable lucidity, so that it falls into Fernando's hands, who instantly believes that Laura is the injured woman. Some spirited scenes ensue, and Fernando interrupts an interview in the dark as he believes between Laura and his rival. A light reveals his mother's shame, and when Don Rodrigo enters after Laura he does not hesitate to sacrifice himself and the beloved by letting it appear that it was Laura he discovered at a clandestine meeting instead of his mother. The result is that Laura is condemned by the relentless Moncada to marry the titled blackguard, being now too damaged an article for the son of his house. This is a delicate dilemma for a youth with such traditions to live up to: to have to choose between his mother's death and dishonour and the dishonour and loss of his bride. His birth is only revealed to him by Doña Violante to prevent the sacrilegious duel between him and his father, and to guard the dreadful secret Fernando stabs himself. 'My death, mother, blots out your dishonour.' The third act hurries on through many strong effects, and the young man's death we feel to have the appropriate majesty of the inevitable. The situation is so poignant that there could be no other solution, and even the titled blackguard wins our sympathy in that last tragic scene.\n\nxixThe same gloom and power pervade The Avenger's Bride, the old story of Montague and Capulet. But here the young Montague, one Don Carlos, slays the traditional family enemy, who happens to be the father of a weak-sighted maiden. She emerges into the strong sunlight just in time to recognise her father's assassin, and then is struck blind. Don Carlos woos her under another name, and an old lover, who is an enlightened oculist of the Middle Ages, restores her sight. Her lover Lorenzo had promised to kill the man she should name her father's murderer. When she cries out, 'Don Carlos,' he keeps his word, and she falls upon his corpse 'the avenger's bride.'\n\nWhat touches us more closely is Echegaray's manipulation of the modern conscience, and its illimitable scope for reflection, for conflict, and the many-sided drama of temptation. This is familiar ground, and we are ever pleased to welcome a new combatant. That the Spanish dramatist brings a novel note may be accepted after reading the curious prologue to his Gran Galeoto. It is the best and most popular of Echegaray's plays. In its printed form it is dedicated to Everybody, which is the crowning insistance on the motif of the prologue, and there is an introduction by Señor Ignacio José Escobar from which I copy an interesting statement.\n\n'And then came that unforgettable night the 19th March 1881, the night of the first representation of The Great Galeoto. There was neither strife nor contradiction, nothing but a universal concert of congratulation, xxpraise, and applause. Here your treatment of a great social problem had the good fortune to run on lines that in all eyes seemed elevated and humane. What a splendid and legitimate satisfaction for those among us who had hesitated to share the general opinion!'\n\nThe Epoca wrote next day:—'Don José Echegaray has obtained an indisputable, an unanimous triumph. He has treated a great social question in a masterly manner. The great Galeoto felt the rod of shame upon its cheek, but it applauded without a single exception. The social vice exists, we know, and that vice was whipped with all the vigorous energy of a Greek tragedy. Everybody recognised the truth of the picture, though none cared to accept it as personal: but the social moral avenged by the creative genius of Señor Echegaray owes him a reward and satisfaction, and that reward and that satisfaction will be the union of all classes, those who may have once in a way formed part of the great Galeoto, and those who habitually protest against the facile habit of slander—to show their gratitude to the poet, the one for vengeance, and the other for the lesson received.\n\n'A subscription not to exceed twenty reals (four shillings), which will be devoted to some work of art, will recall to Señor Echegaray while he lives that he may obtain triumphs as great as last night's, seeking his inspiration in the true sentiment of art.'\n\nTo the extraordinary and self-conscious prelude of The Great Galeoto which lifts a play quite out of the region of diversion, and, as the sensible Don Julian remarks, plunges xxius into philosophy, the written, not acted, prologue to El Hijo de Don Juan (Don Juan's Son) may be added as an excellent interpretation of Echegaray's personality, revealed already with passable clearness in the dramatic prologue quoted. He enumerates the conclusions of the critics. That the play was inspired by Ibsen's celebrated Ghosts. That the passions it deals with are more appropriate to Northern climes than to the South. That it treats of the problem of hereditary madness. That it discusses the law of heredity. That it is gloomy and lugubrious, with no other object than that of inspiring horror. That it is a purely pathological drama. That it contains nothing but the process of madness. That from the moment it is understood that Lázaro will go mad, all interest in the work ceases, and there remains nothing but to follow step by step the shipwreck of enfeebled intelligence. And so on. Echegaray regards all this as the lamentable exercise of dramatic criticism. The underlying thought of his work is different, but he declines to enter into further explanation of it, each scene and each phrase sufficiently explaining it already. To touch more closely upon the matter would be perilous. Besides, he adds, it is not his habit to defend his plays. Once written, he casts them to their fate, without material or moral defence, and the critics are free to tear themselves to pieces over them. There is one phrase alone that he defends energetically, because it is borrowed from Ibsen, and appears to him of singular beauty: 'Mother, give me the sun.' This he describes in his prologue as 'simple, infantile, half comical, but enfolding a world of ideas, an ocean of feeling, a hell xxiiof sorrows, a cruel lesson, the supreme watchword of society—of the family.' He continues, quite in the modern spirit:\n\n'A generation consumed by vice, which carries in its marrow the venom of impure love, in whose corrupted blood the red globules are mixed with putrid matter, must ever fall by degrees into the abysm of idiocy. Lázaro's cry is the last glimmer of a reason dropping into the eternal darkness of imbecility. At that very hour Nature awakes, and the sun rises; it is another twilight that will soon be all light.\n\n'Both twilights meet, cross, salute in recognition of eternal farewell, at the end of the drama. Reason, departing, is held in the grip of corrupting pleasure. The sun, rising, with its immortal call, is pushed forward by the sublime force of Nature.\n\n'Down with human reason, at the point of extinction: hail to the sun that starts another day! 'Give me the sun,' Lázaro cries to his mother. Don Juan also begs it through the tresses of the girl of Tarifa.\n\n'On this subject there is much to be said; it provokes much reflection. If indeed our society—but what the deuce am I doing with philosophy? Let each one solve the problem as best he can, and ask for the sun, the horns of the moon, or whatever takes his fancy. And if nobody is interested in the matter, it only proves that the modern Don Juan has engendered many children without Lázaro's talent.\n\n'Respectful salutations to the children of Don Juan.'\n\nFrom all this it will be understood that Echegaray presses into the service of pleasure the desperate problems of our natural history, and instead of laughter confronts us with mournful gravity; asks us to stand aghast at inherited injustice, and to doubt with him the wisdom of Providence at sight of such undiminished and idle wickedness in man, and such an accumulation of unmerited suffering. Now-a-days xxiiiwe are inordinately engrossed by such issues, and life weighs more heavily upon our shoulders than it did upon our fathers. The good old spirit of fun is fast being trodden out of us by the pervading sense of a mission, and the laborious duty of converting somebody to something. We no longer go to the theatre to weep over fictitious wrongs and smile at imaginary joys. We go to study what we are pleased to call life; to sip at the founts of philosophy, to hear a sermon. It is not exhilarating, but we thankfully take the draught of wisdom offered us, and go our ways without a murmur that we have been depressed rather than entertained. Cervantes, with old-fashioned sanity of judgment, condemned the practice of preaching sermons through the veil of fiction. What sort of reflection would the pathological novel and drama inspire in so wise and witty an author? He might be led to create a type of character even more mad than the Knight Errant.\n\nEl Hijo de Don Juan (Don Juan's Son) is an infinitely crueller and more disagreeable play than Ghosts because it is more lucid, more direct. The characters themselves are more carefully drawn, and we have a closer actual acquaintance with them. Here there is not one victim only, but two. Don Juan, the middle-aged roué, has a friend, also a middle-aged roué. The daughter of his friend, Carmen, is consumptive, and is betrothed to his son, Lázaro, who is subject to vertigo. The play opens with three elderly roués, all ill-preserved after a life of scandal, holding converse the reverse of edifying over tobacco and alcohol. Here Echegaray shows how little he means to mince matters by the remarks he puts into the mouth of xxivone of them in reply to Don Juan's boast that the genius of his son is inherited from him. Paternal inheritance would be nothing but rheum or neurosis—'the sediment of pleasure and the residuum of alcohol.' Upon this Don Juan launches into poetry and describes the single moment in which his soul soared above material enjoyments and sighed for the glorious and impossible. It was after an orgy, and as his half-closed eyes saw the sun rise over the Guadalquivir through the silky waves of a girl's hair, he understood the beauty of poetry and Nature, and stretched out a hand to clutch the splendid orb. This desire is afterwards recalled to him in a moment of surprising horror, when his brilliant and beloved son, sinking into imbecility, sees the rising sun, and cries: 'How lovely! Mother, give me the sun.' 'And I also wanted it once,' Don Juan exclaims: 'My God! my son! Lázaro!'\n\nDon Juan, as might be inferred from his name, carries on intrigues with ballet-girls and servant-maids under the nose of his wife and son. Lázaro seems blind enough to parental delinquencies. Not, as he explains himself when complaining of broken health, that he has been a saint because he has eschewed excesses. The scene where he first appears ailing and stupid is singularly painful, above all, towards the end, when, after an outburst of lucid eloquence, he falls drowsily upon the sofa, and feeling sleep upon him, begs that Carmen, his betrothed, should not be permitted to see him in a ridiculous attitude.\n\nXavier. Unless you are as beautiful as Endymion she shall not enter. [Pause. Xavier walks about; Lázaro begins to sleep.]\n\nLázaro. Xavier, Xavier!\n\nxxvXavier. What?\n\nLázaro. Now I am—half asleep—how do I look?\n\nXavier. Very poetical.\n\nLázaro. Good. Thanks—very poetical. [Dreamily.]\n\nThe second act is somewhat livelier, and contains more spirited contrasts. That Echegaray could excel in lighter comedy may be seen in an amusing scene between the serious son and the dissipated, good-natured father.\n\nDon Juan is alone with his son, who is walking restlessly about. The father asks his son what he is thinking of, and then apologises for disturbing weighty thought. Lázaro listlessly replies that his imagination was wandering, and he wandering after it. When he has received many assurances of not being in the poet's way, Don Juan calls for sherry, the Parisian newspapers, and Nana. Caught laughing over Nana, he asserts his horror of immoral books, and his conviction that literature is going to the dogs.\n\nLázaro. Zola is a great writer. Ah, I've caught the idea I was seeking. [Sits down to write.]\n\nThere is here a little humorous by-play between the servant and Don Juan, and afterwards a reference to the lugubrious theme in converse between her and Lázaro, whose listlessness, courtesy and musing, make an admirable relief against the alert and fussy affection and frivolity of his father.\n\nDon Juan. Ha, ha! witty, exceedingly witty. Full of salt; hot as red pepper. Gil Blas is the only paper worth reading.\n\nLázaro. An interesting article? What is it about? Let me see.\n\nxxviDon Juan. [Hastily ramming the paper into his pocket.] A dull and shocking article. I must take it away, for the mischief would be in it if it fell into Carmen's hands.\n\nLázaro. You are quite right. [Beginning to walk again.]\n\nDon Juan. I hadn't finished it. I must finish it later. [Takes up 'Nana.'] Stupendous! Monumental enough to make one die of laughing. Lord! why do we read but for amusement's sake? Then give us diverting books. [Laughing.]\n\nLázaro. Is it a witty book?\n\nDon Juan. [In altered voice.] Perhaps. But this light literature soon wearies. [Seeing Lázaro approach, he hides 'Nana' in another pocket.] Have you anything substantial to read—really substantial?\n\nLázaro. [Looking through his books.] Do you like Kant?\n\nDon Juan. Kant? Do you say Kant? The very thing. He was always my favourite author. When I was young I fell asleep every night over Kant. [Aside.] Who the deuce is he?\n\nLázaro. If you like I will—— [Looking for a passage.]\n\nDon Juan. No, my son. Any part will do, if it can be read in divisions. Let me see. Don't trouble about me. Write, my son, write. [Lázaro begins to write, and Don Juan reads.] 'Beneath the aspect of relation, third moment of taste, the beautiful appears to us the final form of an object, without semblance to finality.' The Devil! [Holding book away and contemplating it in terror.] The devil! 'Or as a finality without end.' There are people who understand this! 'Since it is called the final form to the causality of any conception with relation to the object.' Let me see [holding book still further off]; 'final form to the causality.' 'Pon my word, I'm perspiring. [Wipes his forehead.] 'Conscience is this finality xxviiwithout end, is the play of the cognitive forces.' What! 'The play of cognitive ... the play' ... If it were play I should understand it. 'Conscience of this internal causality is what constitutes æsthetic pleasure.' If I continue I shall have congestion. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Only think that Lázaro understands the finality without end, the causality and the play of the cognitive forces. Heavens! what a fellow! [Reads again.] 'The principle of the methodical conformity of nature is the transcendental principle of the strength of judgment.' [Strikes the table.] I should lose myself if I read more. But what a fellow, who can read such stuff and keep sane!\n\nLázaro. Does it interest you?\n\nDon Juan. Immensely. What depth! [Aside.] I am five minutes falling into it and haven't yet reached the bottom. I should think it did interest me indeed. But, frankly, I prefer——\n\nLázaro. Hegel?\n\nDon Juan. Just so (Nana).\n\nAfter talk of Lázaro's health and engagement, Don Juan, learning that the young man is pensive or preoccupied, solely because he is projecting a drama, says he will leave him to thought. Glancing into Kant, he mutters, 'The—the—cognitive forces—the—the—finality,—yes, the finality.' 'Work, my son, work. Above all, write nothing immoral.' He drinks off a glass of sherry, and regretfully remarks that this finality has an end; then marches away with the bottle, Gil Blas, and Nana to study in solitude.\n\nThis is the sole touch of comedy in a play of ever increasing gloom, pervaded by the stupor of the hero and the cough of the heroine. 'My father loves me dearly, xxviiiCarmen remarks to Dolores, Don Juan's embittered wife. 'Then he ought to have given you stronger lungs,' the elder woman retorts, with shocking directness. It is indeed, as Echegaray complains the critics assert, a pathological drama. When his friends are not discussing the symptoms of Lázaro's strange malady, he himself is enumerating them in merciless monologues. He talks of his greatness, of his fame, of the popularity of his works, and then falls into childish drivel and longs for playthings. 'His head is not firm,' says Don Nemesis to Carmen's father, in dubiety before the prospect of the marriage; 'that is why he is so stupendous at times, and all the world calls him a genius. Put no trust in geniuses, Timotheus. A genius may walk down one street, and hear the people cry, \"The genius!\" Let him round the corner into another street, and he will hear the street arab shout after him, \"The lunatic!\" Much talent is decidedly a dangerous thing.' 'God defend us from it!' piously exclaims the elderly roué. 'I have always been very careful not to cultivate it.'\n\nIt would be difficult to conceive a more needlessly disagreeable scene than the interview between the celebrated brain doctor and Lázaro, who, the night before, has been consulted by Dolores on behalf of a nephew, and innocently, but with terrible frankness, discusses the case with the unfortunate victim himself. 'We cannot with impunity corrupt the sources of life,' says Doctor Bermúdez, in the high scientific manner, without noticing the increasing emotion of his companion; 'the son of such a father must soon fall into madness or idiocy.' 'Ah! No! xxixWhat? My father! I—It is a lie!' Lázaro burst out, in frantic horror. When the poor mother enters the scene and brings her maternal note of despair to the son's distracted terror, we feel that the modern drama has reached a pitch of tragedy unapprehended in healthier and more barbaric ages. 'Lose one's brains as one might lose a hat!' exclaims Don Juan when enlightened. 'Bah! idiots are born so.... but a man of genius! ... Lázaro, who understands the finality without end as he knows the Paternoster!'\n\nDolores. [Despairingly.] But if it were true? If it were true? And then? Oh! why was I born? [Approaching Don Juan who retreats.] Through you have I lost my illusions, stained my youth, debased my life, forfeited my dignity—through you! And after twenty years of sacrifices, to be worthy of Lázaro! ... good for his sake, loyal for him, resigned for him, honourable for him, and to-day! ... No, you have always been a scoundrel; but for once you must be right. Impossible! impossible! God could not will it.\n\nDon Juan. Good, I have always been a scoundrel. What more? But don't remember it now; above all, don't say it. Say that you forgive me. Forgive me, Dolores.\n\nDolores. What does it matter?\n\nDon Juan. It matters to us both. If you should not forgive me, and if God should remember to punish me, and punish me through my Lázaro!\n\nPitiful is the poor mother's wavering between softness and bitterness. At one moment she pardons him with all her heart, or only bargains that he shall help her to save their boy. And then when he vows to do so with his whole soul and the remainder of his life, she retorts cruelly, xxx'With what life you have left; what Heaven, in its mercy, still grants you.' 'Dolores!' the poor wretch exclaims, and again she softens: 'It is true; I had forgiven you.' Upon this the elderly scapegoat brightens and mentions Paris, Germany, England—'the English know so much. Bah! there is a good deal of science scattered over the world.' 'Then let us gather it all for Lázaro.'\n\nThis desperate situation is relieved by the entrance of Carmen's father in the black of etiquette, strictly solemn as befits a Spanish father offering his daughter in marriage to his old chum. He says reprovingly: 'Do not embrace me. Don't you see that I am all in black—in the garb of etiquette? It is a very solemn occasion. Call everybody except Lázaro—him later. Solemnity above all.' The afflicted parents have decided to conceal Lázaro's calamity from the world, and make a heart-broken effort to welcome the betrothal with delight, and the gloom of the situation is deepened by the young man's miserable behaviour when called to his beloved.\n\nLázaro. Carmen! Mine, mine! I may take her, clasp her in my arms! inflame her with my breath! drink her with my eyes! I may if I like!\n\nDon Juan. Yes, yes, but enough.\n\nLázaro. What infamy! What treason! Carmen!\n\nCarmen. [Running to him.] Lázaro!\n\nLázaro. Go, away! Why do you come to me? You cannot be mine. Never, never, never.\n\nCarmen. Do you give me up? Ah, I have already felt it. Mother! [Takes refuge in his mother's arms.]\n\nNobody understands. Carmen's father is indignant. xxxiLázaro's confidential friend asks if he has gone mad, and Lázaro, bewildered, turns despairingly to Don Juan: 'Father, father. You are my father. Save me.' 'With my life, my son.' 'You gave me life, but it is not enough. Give me life to live, to love, to be happy. Give me life for Carmen's sake. Give me more life, or cursed be that which you have given me.'\n\nThe third act is rendered more sombre if possible from the shabby chatter and airs of aged rake on the part of Carmen's father, with which it starts. We are introduced to the Tarifa girl, Don Juan's old mistress, now pensioned and respectably established on his estate on the banks of the Guadalquivir. Deeper and deeper are we forced to wade through unrelenting shadow. Now it is the frivolous Don Timoteo, sipping his manzanilla, and sneering at the young generation as personated by his daughter Carmen, Lázaro, and Lázaro's friend, the girl with her affected lungs, Lázaro with his dementia, and his friend formal and headachy. 'Ah, in my day we were other,' he sighs. 'Perhaps,' retorts the friend, 'it is because you were—other then that we are so now.' Then it is Lázaro, rough, distrustful, and sly, completely altered, afraid to sleep because he does not know how it might be upon his awakening or if he should ever awake, with swift leaps from childish drivel into the Don's plumed phrases, forgetful of modern raiment, and swaggering through imagery and sonorous syllables as if a sword clanked by his side and he carried the spurs of chivalry. And then the poor victim falls to drinking with his father's old mistress, and when half-drunk and wholly mad, plots with her to carry off Carmen. xxxiiWhen she cries out that 'farewell' means tears, he exclaims inconsequently: 'Then you, too, will cry. We will all cry ... Laughing fatigues, crying rests.'\n\nQuite gay and reckless, he faces Carmen to propose elopement to her. He laments the former coldness of his words and moods, the insufficiency of the vulgar tongue to express passion so burning and impetuous as his, and terrifies her by his wild and flowery volubility. There is night all around him except for the ray of intense light that encircles her face. On that he concentrates all that remains to him of life, of manhood, of feeling, thought and love. He descends from this into weak complaining. Her happiness is threatened by inimical conspiracies, and yet how is he to defend her? He fancies he is in a desert full of sand, plagued with unquenchable thirst and menaced by a falling heaven. He mixes up in the dreariest way the sands of the desert and the old applause that greeted his genius, wonders if either will have an end, then doubts the end of anything, and implores Carmen to save him. 'Help me. Look at me, speak, laugh, cry, do something, Carmen, to keep me from wandering into the desert.' But already his look is vague, and he has ceased to see her. In vain she cries to him that she is near, weeps over him, holds him to her. 'I am Carmen, look at me. The little head you were wont to love so is close to your lips. I am smiling at you. Laugh, Lázaro, answer me. Wake up! Surely you hear me, you see me!' When his mother comes in response to the girl's agonised cry, a glimmer of intelligence gives a sort of dignity to his incoherent words. He wants his mother to console him, for he has xxxiiito say 'a long, a sad, and solemn farewell to Carmen.' The girl protests she will not leave him, when he irritably orders her away—a great way off. He loved her much, but now it is adieu eternally. He only wishes now to be alone with his parents, until memory suddenly carries him back into the time of quarrel, reproaches, and jealousies of those two in his childhood. 'Don't contradict me, father; you used to quarrel and make me afraid.' He passionately orders him away, too, with Carmen, and turns for comfort to his mother. Then he remembers his school troubles, how his mother coldly parted with him, and to guard against complete loneliness, calls for Paca, his father's old mistress. 'Come, I am young and wish to live,' he cries, and when we find Don Juan aroused to indignation and threatening to fling the Tarifa girl over the balcony into the river if she does not instantly retire, we are ready to hail the mercifulness of Ibsen. This is to carry a sermon to an intolerable length, and drive us so out of love with both philosophy and science as to paint unreason with a double allurement. A father kneeling to his mad son to let an old mistress go, and the son, struggling out of the gathering torpor of intelligence to stare at the rising sun:—\n\nsobs Don Juan.\n\n'For ever!'\n\nis the last lugubrious note of Dr. Bermúdez.\n\nxxxivIt is a relief to turn from this ghastly tragedy to the brighter movement of El Gran Galeoto. My printed copy of this play shows it to have run to the twentieth edition, which, for an unreading land like Spain, is an enormous sale. Bright is perhaps a misleading term, for the whole is tinged with the profound melancholy that strikes us in the Spanish gaze, in its character and in the tristful note of its popular songs and dances. The English are supposed to take their pleasures sadly. The saying were more appropriate to the rather dreary race beyond the Pyrenees. Whatever may be their preoccupation (generally speaking it is dulness or an empty mind they are afflicted with rather than sadness) they give the foreigner the impression of being the wholesale victims of a shattered organ which we have the habit of associating with the affections.\n\nIn these two dramas—Don Juan's Son and The Great Galeoto—enough will be understood of the passion of gravity with which the Spanish dramatist enters into the obscurer and less picturesque tragedies of life. Love with him is not the sentimental sighing of maids and boys, as he again shows in Lo Sublime en lo Vulgar, but the great perplexed question of married infelicity and misunderstanding. Don Julian dies broken-hearted and wilfully deceived, and his deception it is that forges the tempered happiness of his rival. In Lo Sublime en lo Vulgar we have two diverse husbands: Richard, an airy social success, full of elegant phrases, befittingly tailored, and of manners the best—the sort of man destined to float to the surface in all circumstances, and minuet with xxxvgrace round the ugliest corner. Bernard, whom he betrays and laughs at, is the commonplace, scarce presentable husband, married by a refined and poetical creature for his money, and blushed for by her at every moment while she is solacing herself with the elegant improprieties of her friend's husband, Richard. Here we have another picture of marital jealousy, justifiable in this case, and perhaps for that reason more merciful. Instead of turning from his faithless wife, the insignificant and vulgar Bernard wins her to him and to atonement by an unpretentious magnanimity, and the play ends hopefully with Richard's cry to his wife: 'Louisa, pardon!—and forget!' And Bernard, turning to Inez, his wife, explains his generosity in sonorous verse: 'Honour goes from the soul into the depth, and in the world I put no trust. Since my honour is my own, I understand it infinitely better than the world.'\n\nNot even Tolstoi, with all that delicacy and keenness of the Russian conscience, that profound seriousness, which move us so variously in his great books, has a nobler consciousness of the dignity of suffering and virtue than this Spanish dramatist. And not less capable is he of a jesting survey of life. Echegaray writes in no fever of passion, and wastes no talent on the niceties of art. The morality and discontent that float from the meditative North have reached him in his home of sunshine and easy emotions, and his work is pervaded nobly by its spirit. And unlike Ibsen, he illuminates thought with sane and connected action. Discontent never leads him to the verge of extravagance. Extravagance he conceives to be a part of youth, addicted to bombast and wild words. Man trades xxxviin other material than romantic language and rhodomontade. Hence he brings emphasis and plain speech to bear upon him when youth has had its fill through the long-winded, high coloured phrases of his scribbling heroes. Thought, perhaps, travels too persistently along the shadowed paths, and we should be thankful to find our world reflected through his strong glass, dappled with a little of the uncertain but lovely sunshine that plays not the least part in the April weather of our life here.\n\nThe note of unwavering sadness depresses. But, at least, it is not ignoble, and he conceives it borne with so much resignation and dignity that if the picture carries with it the colours of frailty, it brings a counterbalancing conception of the inherent greatness of man.\n\nHANNAH LYNCH.\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nA study; to the left a balcony, on right a door; in the middle a table strewn with papers and books, and a lighted lamp upon it. Towards the right a sofa. Night.\n\nSCENE I\n\nErnest. [Seated at table and preparing to write.] Nothing—impossible! It is striving with the impossible. The idea is there; my head is fevered with it; I feel it. At moments an inward light illuminates it, and I see it. I see it in its floating form, vaguely outlined, and suddenly a secret voice seems to animate it, and I hear sounds of sorrow, sonorous sighs, shouts of sardonic laughter ... a whole world of passions alive and struggling.... They burst forth from me, extend around me, and the air is full of them. Then, then I say to myself: ''Tis now the moment.' I take up my pen, stare into space, listen attentively, restraining my very heart-beats, and bend over the paper.... Ah, but the irony of impotency! The outlines become blurred, the vision fades, the cries and sighs faint away ... and nothingness, nothingness encircles me.... The monotony of empty space, of inert thought, of dreamy lassitude! and more than all the monotony of an idle pen and lifeless paper that lacks the life of thought! Ah! How varied are the shapes of nothingness, and how, in its dark and silent way, it mocks creatures of my stamp! So many, many forms! Canvas without colour, bits of marble without shape, confused 4noise of chaotic vibrations. But nothing more irritating, more insolent, meaner than this insolent pen of mine [throws it away], nothing worse than this white sheet of paper. Oh, if I cannot fill it, at least I may destroy it—vile accomplice of my ambition and my eternal humiliation. Thus, thus ... smaller and still smaller. [Tears up paper. Pauses.] And then! How lucky that nobody saw me! For in truth such fury is absurd and unjust. No, I will not yield. I will think and think, until either I have conquered or am crushed. No, I will not give up. Let me see, let me see ... if in that way——\n\nSCENE II\n\nD. Julian. [At the door, without entering.] I say, Ernest!\n\nErnest. Don Julian!\n\nD. Julian. Still working? Do I disturb you?\n\nErnest. [Rising.] Disturb me! What a question, Don Julian! Come in, come in. And Teodora?\n\n[Don Julian enters.]\n\nD. Julian. We have just come from the Opera. She has gone upstairs with my brother, to see something or other that Mercedes has bought, and I was on my way to my room when I saw your light, so I stopped to say good-night.\n\nErnest. Was there a good house?\n\nD. Julian. As usual. All our friends inquired after you. They wondered you were not there too.\n\nErnest. That was kind of them.\n\nD. Julian. Not more than you deserve. And how have 5you improved the shining hours of solitude and inspiration!\n\nErnest. Solitude, yes; inspiration, no. It shuns me though I call on it never so humbly and fondly.\n\nD. Julian. It has failed at the rendezvous?\n\nErnest. And not for the first time, either. But if I have done nothing else, at least I have made a happy discovery.\n\nD. Julian. What?\n\nErnest. That I am a poor devil.\n\nD. Julian. The deuce! That's a famous discovery.\n\nErnest. Nothing less.\n\nD. Julian. But why are you so out of sorts with yourself? Is the play you talked of the other day not going on?\n\nErnest. How can it? The going on is done by me going out of my wits.\n\nD. Julian. How is this? Both the drama and inspiration are faithless to my poor friend.\n\nErnest. This is how I stand. When I first conceived the idea, I imagined it full of promise, but when I attempt to give it form, and vest it in an appropriate stage garb, the result shows something extraordinary, difficult, undramatic and impossible.\n\nD. Julian. How is it impossible? Come, tell me. You've excited my curiosity. [Sits down on the sofa.]\n\nErnest. Imagine the principal personage, one who creates the drama and develops it, who gives it life and provokes the catastrophe, who, broadly, fills and possesses it, and yet who cannot make his way to the stage.\n\nD. Julian. Is he so ugly, then? So repugnant or bad?\n\n6Ernest. Not so. Bad as you or I may be—not worse. Neither good nor bad, and truly not repugnant. I am not such a cynic—neither a misanthrope, nor one so out of love with life as to fall into such unfairness.\n\nD. Julian. What, then, is the reason?\n\nErnest. The reason, Don Julian, is that there is no material room in the Scenario for this personage.\n\nD. Julian. Holy Virgin! What do you mean? Is it by chance a mythological drama with Titans in it?\n\nErnest. Titans, yes, but in the modern sense of the word.\n\nD. Julian. That is to say——?\n\nErnest. That is to say, this person is ... everybody.\n\nD. Julian. Everybody! You are right. There is no room for everybody on the stage. It is an incontrovertible truth that has more than once been demonstrated.\n\nErnest. Then you agree with me?\n\nD. Julian. Not entirely. Everybody may be condensed in a few types and characters. This is matter beyond my depth, but I have always understood that the masters have more than once accomplished it.\n\nErnest. Yes, but in my case it is to condemn me, not to write my drama.\n\nD. Julian. Why?\n\nErnest. For many reasons it would be difficult to explain,—above all, at this late hour.\n\nD. Julian. Never mind. Give me a few.\n\nErnest. Look! Each individual of this entire mass, each head of this monster of a thousand heads, of this Titan of the century, whom I call everybody, takes part in my play for a flying moment, to utter but one word, fling a 7single glance. Perhaps his action in the tale consists of a smile, he appears but to vanish. Listless and absent-minded, he acts without passion, without anger, without guile, often for mere distraction's sake.\n\nD. Julian. What then?\n\nErnest. These light words, these fugitive glances, these indifferent smiles, all these evanescent sounds and this trivial evil, which may be called the insignificant rays of the dramatic light, condensed to one focus, to one group, result in conflagration or explosion, in strife and in victims. If I represent the whole by a few types or symbolical personages, I bestow upon each one that which is really dispersed among many, and such a result distorts my idea. I must bring types on the stage whose guile repels and is the less natural because evil in them has no object. This exposes me to a worse consequence, to the accusation of meaning to paint a cruel, corrupted, and debased society, when my sole pretention is to prove that not even the most insignificant actions are in themselves insignificant or lost for good or evil. For, concentrated by the mysterious influences of modern life, they may reach to immense effects.\n\nD. Julian. Say no more, my friend. All this is metaphysics. A glimmer of light, perhaps, but through an infinitude of cloud. However, you understand these things better than I do. Letters of exchange, shares, stock, and discount, now—that's another matter.\n\nErnest. No, no; you've common sense, and that's the chief thing.\n\nD. Julian. You flatter me, Ernest.\n\nErnest. But you follow me?\n\nD. Julian. Not in the least. There ought to be a way out of the difficulty.\n\nErnest. If that were all!\n\n8D. Julian. What! More?\n\nErnest. Tell me what is the great dramatic spring?\n\nD. Julian. My dear fellow, I don't exactly know what you mean by a dramatic spring. All I can tell you is that I have not the slightest interest in plays where love does not preponderate—above all unfortunate love, for I have enough of happy love at home.\n\nErnest. Good, very good! Then in my play there can be little or no love.\n\nD. Julian. So much the worse. Though I know nothing of your play, I suspect it will interest nobody.\n\nErnest. So I have been telling you. Nevertheless, it is possible to put in a little love,—and jealousy too.\n\nD. Julian. Ah, then, with an interesting intrigue skilfully developed, and some effective situations——\n\nErnest. No, nothing of the sort. It will be all simple, ordinary, almost vulgar ... so that the drama will not have any external action. The drama evolves within the personages: it advances slowly: to-day takes hold of a thought, to-morrow of a heart-beat, little by little, undermines the will.\n\nD. Julian. But who understands all this? How are these interior ravages manifested? Who recounts them to the audience? In what way are they evident? Must we spend a whole evening hunting for a glance, a sigh, a gesture, a single word? My dear boy, this is not amusement. To cast us into such depths is to hurl us upon philosophy.\n\nErnest. You but echo my own thought.\n\nD. Julian. I have no wish to discourage you. You best know what you are about—there. Though the play seems rather colourless, heavy, uninteresting, perhaps if the dénoûment is sensational—and the explosion—eh?\n\n9Ernest. Sensation! Explosion! Hardly, and that only just upon the fall of the curtain.\n\nD. Julian. Which means that the play begins when the curtain falls?\n\nErnest. I am inclined to admit it. But I will endeavour to give it a little warmth.\n\nD. Julian. My dear lad, what you have to do is to write the second play, the one that begins where the first ends. For the other, according to your description, would be difficult to write, and is not worth the trouble.\n\nErnest. 'Tis the conclusion I have come to myself.\n\nD. Julian. Then we agree, thanks to your skill and logic. And what is the name?\n\nErnest. That's another difficulty. I can find none.\n\nD. Julian. What do you say? No name either?\n\nErnest. No, unless, as Don Hermogenes[2] says, we could put it into Greek for greater clarity.\n\nD. Julian. Of a surety, Ernest, you were dozing when I came in. You have been dreaming nonsense.\n\nErnest. Dreaming! yes. Nonsense! perhaps. I talk both dreams and nonsense. But you are sensible and always right.\n\nD. Julian. In this case it does not require much penetration. A drama in which the chief personage cannot appear; in which there is hardly any love; in which nothing happens but what happens every day; that begins with the fall of the curtain upon the last act, and which has no name. I don't know how it is to be written, still less how it is to be acted, how it is to find an audience, nor how it can be called a drama.\n\n10Ernest. Nevertheless, it is a drama, if I could only give it proper form, and that I can't do.\n\nD. Julian. Do you wish to follow my advice?\n\nErnest. Can you doubt it?—you, my friend, my benefactor, my second father! Don Julian!\n\nD. Julian. Come, come, Ernest, don't let us drop into a sentimental drama on our own account instead of yours, which we have declared impossible. I asked you if you would take my advice.\n\nErnest. And I said yes.\n\nD. Julian. Then leave aside your plays. Go to bed, rest yourself, and come out shooting with me to-morrow. Kill a few partridges, and that will be an excuse for your not killing one or two characters, and not exposing yourself to the same fate at the hands of the public. After all, you may thank me for it.\n\nErnest. I'll do no such thing. I mean to write that play.\n\nD. Julian. But, my poor fellow, you've conceived it in mortal sin.\n\nErnest. I don't know, but it is conceived. I feel it stir in my brain. It clamours for life, and I must give it to the world.\n\nD. Julian. Can't you find another plot?\n\nErnest. But this idea?\n\nD. Julian. Send it to the devil.\n\nErnest. Ah, Don Julian, you believe that an idea which has gripped the mind can be effaced and destroyed at our pleasure. I wanted to think out another play, but this accursed idea won't give it room, until it itself has seen the light.\n\n11D. Julian. God grant you a happy delivery.\n\nErnest. That's the question, as Hamlet says.\n\nD. Julian. Couldn't you cast it into the literary foundling hospital of anonymity?\n\n[In a low voice with an air of comical mystery.]\n\nErnest. Don Julian, I am a man of conscience. Good or bad, my children are legitimate. They bear my name.\n\nD. Julian. [Preparing to go.] I have nothing more to say. What must be done will be done.\n\nErnest. I wish it were so. Unfortunately, it is not done. But no matter; if I don't do it, somebody else will.\n\nD. Julian. Then to work, and good luck, and may nobody rob you of your laurels.\n\nSCENE III\n\nTeodora. [Outside.] Julian, Julian!\n\nD. Julian. It's Teodora.\n\nTeodora. Are you there, Julian?\n\nD. Julian. [Going to the door.] Yes, I'm here. Come in.\n\nTeodora. [Entering.] Good-evening, Ernest.\n\nErnest. Good-evening, Teodora. Was the singing good?\n\nTeodora. As usual; and have you been working much?\n\nErnest. As usual; nothing.\n\nTeodora. Then you'd have done better to come with us. They all asked after you.\n\nErnest. It seems that everybody is interested in me.\n\n12D. Julian. I should think so, since everybody is to be the principal personage of your play. You may imagine if they are anxious to be on good terms with you.\n\nTeodora. A play?\n\nD. Julian. Hush! 'Tis a mystery. Ask no questions. Neither title, nor characters, nor action, nor catastrophe—the sublime! Good-night, Ernest. Come, Teodora.\n\nErnest. Adieu, Don Julian.\n\nTeodora. Till to-morrow.\n\nErnest. Good-night.\n\nTeodora. [To Don Julian.] How preoccupied Mercedes was!\n\nD. Julian. And Severo was in a rage.\n\nTeodora. Why, I wonder.\n\nD. Julian. How do I know? On the other hand, Pepito chattered enough for both.\n\nTeodora. He always does, and nobody escapes his tongue.\n\nD. Julian. He's a character for Ernest's play.\n\n[Exeunt Teodora, and Don Julian by right.]\n\nSCENE IV\n\nErnest. Let Don Julian say what he will, I won't abandon the undertaking. That would be signal cowardice. Never retreat—always forward. [Rises and begins to walk about in an agitated way. Then approaches the balcony.] Protect me, night. In thy blackness, rather than in the azure clearness of day, are outlined the luminous shapes of inspiration. Lift your roofs, you thousand houses of this great town, as well for a poet in dire necessity as for the devil on two sticks 13who so wantonly exposed you. Let me see the men and women enter your drawing-rooms and boudoirs in search of the night's rest after fevered pleasures abroad. Let my acute hearing catch the stray words of all those who inquired for me of Don Julian and Teodora. As the scattered rays of light, when gathered to a focus by diaphanous crystal, strike flame, and darkness is forged by the crossed bars of shadow; as mountains are made from grains of earth, and seas from drops of water: so will I use your wasted words, your vague smiles, your eager glances, and build my play of all those thousand trivialities dispersed in cafés, at reunions, theatres, and spectacles, and that float now in the air. Let the modest crystal of my intelligence be the lens which will concentrate light and shadow, from which will spring the dramatic conflagration and the tragic explosion of the catastrophe. Already my play takes shape. It has even a title now, for there, under the lamp-shade, I see the immortal work of the immortal Florentine. It offers me in Italian what in good Spanish it would be risky and futile audacity either to write on paper or pronounce on the stage. Francesca and Paolo, assist me with the story of your loves! [Sits down and prepares to write.] The play ... the play begins.... First page—there, 'tis no longer white. It has a name. [Writing.] The Great Galeoto. [Writes feverishly.]\n\n14\n\nACT I\n\nScene—A drawing-room in Don Julian's house. At the back of stage a large door, and beyond a passage separating it from the dining-room door, which remains closed throughout the act. On the left a balcony, and beyond it a door. On the right two doors. On the stage a table, an arm-chair, handsome and luxurious mounting. Hour, towards sunset.\n\nSCENE I\n\nTeodora. What a lovely sunset! what clouds and light, and what a sky! Suppose it were true, as the poets say, and our fathers believed, that our fate is stamped upon the azure heaven! Were the mysterious secret of human destiny traced by the stars upon the sapphire sphere, and this splendid evening should hold the cipher of ours, what happiness it must disclose! what a smiling future! What a life in our life, and what radiance in our heaven! Is it not so, Julian? [She approaches Don Julian.] Ah, plunged in thought, I see! Come and look out. What, no word for me?\n\nD. Julian. [Absently.] What is it?\n\nTeodora. [Coming near.] You have not been listening to me!\n\n15D. Julian. You have my heart ever—who are its magnet and its centre. But my mind is apt to be besieged by preoccupations, cares, business——\n\nTeodora. They are the plague of my life, since they rob me, if not of my husband's affections, at least of some of his attention. But what is the matter, Julian? [Affectionately.] Something worries you. Is it serious, that you are so solemn and so silent? If it should be trouble, Julian, remember that I have a right to share it. My joys are yours, and your sorrows are no less mine.\n\nD. Julian. Sorrows! Troubles! Are you not happy? Do I not possess in you the living embodiment of joy? With those cheeks so ruddy in the glow of health, and those dear eyes, clear like your soul and resplendent as the sky, and I the owner of all you, could pain, or shadow, or grief teach me I am other than the happiest man alive?\n\nTeodora. It is a business annoyance, perhaps?\n\nD. Julian. Money never yet forced sleep or appetite to forsake me. I have never felt aversion, much less contempt for it, so it follows that the article has flowed easily into my coffers. I was rich, I am rich; and until Don Julian of Garagarga dies of old age, please God and his own good fortune, he will remain, if not the wealthiest, certainly the surest, banker of Madrid, Cadiz, and Oporto.\n\nTeodora. Then what is your preoccupation?\n\nD. Julian. I was thinking—'tis a good thought, too.\n\nTeodora. Naturally, since 'tis yours.\n\nD. Julian. Flatterer! you would spoil me.\n\nTeodora. But I am still unenlightened.\n\nD. Julian. There is an important matter I want to achieve.\n\n16Teodora. Connected with the new works?\n\nD. Julian. No; it has nothing to do with stone or iron.\n\nTeodora. What, then?\n\nD. Julian. It is a question of kindness—a sacred debt of old date.\n\nTeodora. [Gleefully.] Oh, I can guess now.\n\nD. Julian. So!\n\nTeodora. You mean Ernest.\n\nD. Julian. You are right.\n\nTeodora. Yes, yes, you must. Poor lad! he's so good and noble and generous.\n\nD. Julian. Quite his father's son—the model of a loyal hidalgo.\n\nTeodora. And then so clever! Only twenty-six, and a prodigy! what doesn't he know?\n\nD. Julian. Know! I should think he did know. That's nothing—rather, that's the worst of it. While he is wandering in the sphere of sublime thought, I fear he's not likely to learn much of a world so deceptive and prosaic as ours, which takes no interest in the subtleties of the mind until three centuries after genius has been buried.\n\nTeodora. But with you for a guide, Julian—you don't intend to abandon him yet a while, surely?\n\nD. Julian. God forbid. I should be black-hearted indeed if I would so readily forget all I owe his father. Don Juan of Acedo risked for my family name and wealth, ay, almost his life. Should this lad need mine, he might ask it, and welcome. 'Twould be but just payment of the debt my name represents.\n\nTeodora. Well said, Julian. It is like you.\n\n17D. Julian. You remember, about a year ago, I heard my good friend was dead, and his son was left badly off. I lost no time, caught the train to Gerona, nearly used force, and carried the boy back here. When he stood in the middle of this room I said to him: 'You are master here; you may command me and mine. Since I owe your father everything, you must regard me in the light of his representative. If I fall short, my desire is to come as near as possible to him. As for the amount of affection I have to dispose of—we'll see if I don't outrace him there.'\n\nTeodora. I remember it well. The soft-hearted fellow burst out crying, and clung to you like a child.\n\nD. Julian. He's but a child, as you say. That's why we must think and plan for him. And 'twas of that I was so seriously thinking a moment ago. I was meditating a half-formed project, while you, dear, wanted me to contemplate a panorama of radiant cloud and scarlet sun that cannot compare with the sun that shines in my own heaven.\n\nTeodora. I cannot divine your idea. What is it you project doing for Ernest?\n\nD. Julian. Those are my words.\n\nTeodora. But is there something yet undone that you expect to discover? He has lived with us for the past year like one of ourselves. Were he your son, or a brother of mine, could you show him more tenderness, I more affection?\n\nD. Julian. It is much, but not enough.\n\nTeodora. Not enough! I fancy,——\n\nD. Julian. You are thinking of the present, and I of the future.\n\nTeodora. Oh! the future! That is easily settled. See, he lives here with us as long as he likes, for years. It is 18his home. Then when the just and natural law prompts him to fall in love and desire another, we will marry him. You will nobly share your wealth with him, and we will lead them from the altar to their own house,—he and she! The proverb, you know, says wisely, 'for each wedded pair a house.' He will live just a little away from us, but that will be no reason for our forgetting him, or loving him less. I see it all distinctly. They are happy, and we even happier. They have children, of course, and we perhaps more—well, at least, one little girl, who will fall in love with Ernest's son, and to whom we will marry her by and by.\n\nD. Julian. But where in heaven's name are you going to stop? [Laughing.]\n\nTeodora. You spoke of his future, Julian, and I've sketched it. If not this one, I will neither approve nor accept it.\n\nD. Julian. How like you, Teodora! but——\n\nTeodora. Ah, there is a but already.\n\nD. Julian. Listen, Teodora. It is but a debt we owe to look after the poor fellow as if he were a relative, and obligation runs with the exactions of our affection. So much for himself; so much for his father's son. But every human action is complex, has two points of view, and every medal has its reverse. Which means, Teodora, that you must understand it is a very different matter to give and receive favours; and that in the end Ernest might feel my protection a humiliation. He's a high-spirited, fine lad, a trifle haughty perhaps, and it is imperative there should be an end to his present position. We may, if we can, do more for him, but we must seem to do less.\n\nTeodora. How so?\n\n19D. Julian. We'll see—but here he comes——[Looks down the stage.]\n\nTeodora. Hush!\n\nSCENE II\n\nD. Julian. Welcome!\n\nErnest. Don Julian!—and Teodora! [Salutes absently. Sits down near the table in pensive silence.]\n\nDon Julian. [Approaching him.] What's the matter?\n\nErnest. Nothing.\n\nD. Julian. You look as if something ailed you—your preoccupation reveals it. No trouble, I hope?\n\nErnest. Nonsense.\n\nD. Julian. Nor disappointment?\n\nErnest. None whatever.\n\nD. Julian. I don't annoy you?\n\nErnest. You! good heavens! [Rises and comes toward him effusively.] You speak out of the right of friendship and affection, and you read me through and through. Yes, sir; there is indeed something the matter. I will tell you, if you, and you also, Teodora, out of your pity, will hold me excused. I am an ungrateful fool, a mere boy, in truth, deserving neither of your kindness nor of your affection. Possessing such a father and such a sister, I ought to be happy, with no care for the morrow. But it is not so. I blush to explain it,—can't you understand?—Yes, yes, you must see how false my position is. I live here on alms. [With energy.]\n\nTeodora. Such a word——\n\n20Ernest. Teodora!\n\nTeodora. Affronts us.\n\nErnest. I expressed myself ill—but it is so.\n\nD. Julian. I say it is not so. If any one in this house lives upon alms, and those no slight ones, it is I and not you.\n\nErnest. I am acquainted, sir, with the story of two loyal friends, and of some money matters long forgotten. It does honour to my father and to his hidalgic race. But I am shamed in profiting by it. I am young, Don Julian, and although I may not be worth much, there ought still to be some way for me to earn my bread. It may be pride or folly, I cannot say. But I remember what my father used to say: 'What you can do yourself, never ask another to do. What you can earn, never owe to any one else.'\n\nD. Julian. So that my services humiliate and degrade you. You count your friends importunate creditors.\n\nTeodora. Reason may be on your side, Ernest, and in knowledge you are not deficient, but, believe me, in this case the heart alone speaks with wisdom.\n\nD. Julian. Your father did not find me so ungenerous or so proud.\n\nTeodora. Ah, friendship was then a very different thing.\n\nErnest. Teodora!\n\nTeodora. [To Don Julian.] What a noble anxiety displays\n\nErnest. I know I seem ungrateful—I feel it—and an idiot to boot. Forgive me, Don Julian.\n\nD. Julian. His head is a forge.\n\n21Teodora. [Also apart to Don Julian.] He doesn't live in this world.\n\nD. Julian. Just so. He's full of depth and learning, and lets himself be drowned in a pool of water.\n\nErnest. [Meditatively.] True, I know little of life, and am not well fitted to make my way through it But I divine it, and shudder, I know not why. Shall I founder on the world's pool as upon the high sea? I may not deny that it terrifies me far more than the deep ocean. The sea only reaches the limit set by the loose sand: over all space travel the emanations of the pool. A strong man's arms can struggle with the waves of the sea, but no one can struggle against subtle miasma. But if I fall, I must not feel the humiliation of defeat. I wish and pray that at the last moment I may see the approach of the sea that will bear me away at its will; see the sword that is to pierce me, the rock against which I am to be crushed. I must measure my adversary's strength, and despise it falling, despise it dying, instead of tamely breathing the venom scattered through the ambient air.\n\nD. Julian. [To Teodora.] Didn't I tell you he was going out of his mind?\n\nTeodora. But, Ernest, where are you wandering?\n\nD. Julian. Yes. What has all this to do with the matter?\n\nErnest. Sir, I have come to the conclusion that others, seeing me housed and fed here, are saying of me what I long have thought. They see me constantly driving out with you, in the morning walking with Teodora or Mercedes, in your opera-box, hunting on your lands, and daily occupying the same place at your table. Though you would like to think otherwise, in one way or another the gossip runs: Who is he? Is he a relation? Not so. The secretary? Still less. A partner? If a partner, it 22may be accepted he brings little or nothing to the general fund. So they chatter.\n\nD. Julian. By no means. You are raving.\n\nErnest. I beg to contradict you.\n\nD. Julian. Then give me a name.\n\nErnest. Sir?——\n\nD. Julian. One will do.\n\nErnest. There is one at hand—upstairs.\n\nD. Julian. Name him.\n\nErnest. Don Severo.\n\nD. Julian. My brother?\n\nErnest. Exactly, your brother? Will that suffice? or shall we add his respected wife, Doña Mercedes? and Pepito, their son? What have you to say then?\n\nD. Julian. That Severo is a fool, Mercedes an idle chatterer, and the lad a puppy.\n\nErnest. They only repeat what they hear.\n\nD. Julian. It is not true. This is false reasoning. Between gentlemen, when the intention is honourable, what can the opinion of the world really matter? The meaner it is, the loftier our disdain of it.\n\nErnest. 'Tis nobly said, and is what all well-bred men feel. But I have been taught that gossip, whether inspired by malice or not, which is according to each one's natural tendency, begins in a lie and generally ends in truth. Does gossip, as it grows, disclose the hidden sin? Is it a reflex of the past, or does it invent evil and give it existence? Does it set its accursed seal upon an existent fault, or merely breed that which was yet not, and furnish the occasion for wrong? Should we 23call the slanderer infamous or severe? the accomplice or the divulger? the public avenger or the tempter? Does he arrest or precipitate our fall? wound through taste or duty? and when he condemns, is it from justice or from spite? Perhaps both, Don Julian. Who can say? though time, occasion, and facts may show.\n\nD. Julian. See here, Ernest, I don't understand an iota of all this philosophising. I presume 'tis on such nonsense you waste your intelligence. But I don't want you to be vexed or worried. It's true—you really wish for austere independence, to stand alone at a post of honour?\n\nErnest. Don Julian!\n\nD. Julian. Answer me.\n\nErnest. [Joyously]. Yes.\n\nD. Julian. Then count it gained. At this very moment I have no secretary. I am expecting one from London. But nobody would suit me better than a certain young fool, who is enamoured of poverty. [Speaks in pleasant reproach.] His work and salary will, of course, be settled as any one else's, though he be a son to one who cherishes him as such.\n\nErnest. Don Julian!\n\nD. Julian. [Affecting comical severity.] Remember, I am an exacting business man, and I have not the habit of giving my money away for nothing. I intend to get as much as possible out of you, and work you hard. In my house the bread of just labour alone is consumed. By the clock, ten hours, starting at daybreak, and when I choose to be severe, you will see that Severo himself is no match for me. So, before the world you pose as the victim of my selfishness ... but in private, dear boy, ever the same, the centre of my dearest affections. [Unable to maintain former tone, Don Julian breaks off, and holds his hand out to Ernest.]\n\n24Ernest. [Deeply moved.] Don Julian!\n\nD. Julian. You accept, then?\n\nErnest. I am yours to command.\n\nTeodora. [To Don Julian.] At last you have tamed the savage.\n\nErnest. [To Don Julian.] Anything for your sake.\n\nD. Julian. So would I have you always, Ernest. And now I have to write to my London correspondent, and thank him, and while recognising the extraordinary merit of his Englishman, whom he extols to the skies, regret that I have already engaged a young man. [Walks toward the first door on the right hand.] This is how we stand for the present; but in the future—it will be as partners. [Returns with an air of mystery.]\n\nTeodora. Stop, Julian, I beg of you. Can't you see that he will take alarm? [Don Julian goes out on the right, and laughs to himself, looking back at Ernest.]\n\nSCENE III\n\nTeodora and Ernest. Towards the end of the last scene twilight has fallen, so that at this moment the room is in deep shadow.\n\nErnest. I am dazed by so much kindness. How can I ever repay it? [He sits down on the sofa, displaying great emotion. Teodora walks over and stands beside him.]\n\nTeodora. By ejecting the spirit of pride and distrust; by being sensible and believing that we truly love you, that we will never change; and by putting full faith in all Julian's promises. His word is sacred, Ernest, and in him you will always have a father, in me a sister.\n\n25\n\nSCENE IV\n\nTeodora, Ernest, Doña Mercedes, and Don Severo. The latter remain standing behind as they enter. The room is quite dark, save for a glimmer of light shed from the balcony, whither Ernest and Teodora have moved.\n\nErnest. How good you are!\n\nTeodora. And you, what a boy! After to-day I hope you have done with sadness—eh?\n\nErnest. Quite.\n\nMercedes. [Outside, speaking low.] How dark it is!\n\nSevero. [In same tone.] Come away, Mercedes.\n\nMercedes. [Crossing the threshold.] There is nobody here.\n\nSevero. [Detaining her.] Yes, there is. [Both stand a while peering.]\n\nErnest. Teodora, my whole life, a thousand lives would still not be enough to offer you in return for your kindness. Don't judge me by my morose temper. I cannot lend a showy front to my affections, but, believe me, I do know how to love—and hate as well. My heart can beat to bursting under the lash of either sentiment.\n\nMercedes. [To Severo.] What are they saying?\n\nSevero. Something odd, but I hear imperfectly. [Teodora and Ernest go out on the balcony, speaking low.]\n\nMercedes. 'Tis Ernest.\n\nSevero. And she—I suppose—is——\n\nMercedes. Teodora.\n\n26Severo. Their eternal tricks—always together. I can stand no more of this. And their words? I mustn't put it off any longer——\n\nMercedes. True, Severo. Come away. It is certainly your duty, since everybody is talking.\n\nSevero. Yes, I must open Julian's eyes—to-day, at once.\n\nMercedes. The fellow has impudence enough, and to spare.\n\nSevero. By all that's holy—so has she.\n\nMercedes. Poor girl! She's but a child. Leave her to me.\n\nTeodora. Another house? Surely no. You wouldn't leave us? What an idea! Julian would never consent.\n\nSevero. [To Doña Mercedes.] I should think not indeed, neither would I. [Aloud.] Ah, Teodora, you didn't see me? This is how you receive your guests.\n\nTeodora. [Coming from the balcony.] Don Severo! I am delighted.\n\nMercedes. Is there no dinner this evening? It's near the hour.\n\nTeodora. Mercedes too!\n\nMercedes. Yes, Teodora.\n\nSevero. [Aside.] She is a capital actress. What a creature!\n\nTeodora. I must ring for lights. [Touches the bell on the table.]\n\nSevero. Quite so. Every one likes plenty of light.\n\nServant. Madam?\n\nTeodora. Bring the lamps, Genaro. [Exit servant.]\n\n27Severo. He who follows the narrow path of loyalty and duty, and is always that which he appears to be, need never fear the light, nor blush in its glare.\n\nTeodora. [Laughing naturally.] So I should think, and such, I imagine, is the general opinion. [Looks at Mercedes.]\n\nMercedes. I suppose so.\n\nSevero. Hulloa, Don Ernest! what were you doing out there? Were you with Teodora when we came in! [Speaks with marked intention.]\n\nErnest. [Coldly.] I was here as you see.\n\nSevero. The deuce you were! It is rather dark to see. [Approaches him with outstretched hand, looking fixedly at him. Teodora and Mercedes converse apart. Aside.] His face is flushed, and he appears to have been crying. In this world only children and lovers weep. [Aloud.] And Julian?\n\nTeodora. He went away to write a letter.\n\nErnest. [Aside.] Though I have patience to spare, this man tries me hard.\n\nSevero. [To Teodora.] I am going to see him. There is still time before dinner?\n\nTeodora. Plenty.\n\nSevero. Good. Then to work. [Aside, rubbing his hands, and looking back at Ernest and Teodora. Aloud.] Goodbye.\n\nTeodora. Goodbye.\n\nSevero. [Rancorously, from the door.] My faith!\n\n28\n\nSCENE V\n\nTeodora, Doña Mercedes, and Ernest. The ladies occupy the sofa, and Ernest stands near them.\n\nMercedes. [To Ernest.] We did not see you to-day.\n\nErnest. No, madam.\n\nMercedes. Nor Pepito?\n\nErnest. No.\n\nMercedes. He is upstairs alone.\n\nErnest. [Aside.] Let him stop there.\n\nMercedes. [Gravely and mysteriously to Teodora.] I wish he would go. I want to speak to you.\n\nTeodora. Indeed?\n\nMercedes. [In same tone.] Yes, it is something very serious.\n\nTeodora. Well, begin!\n\nMercedes. Why doesn't he go?\n\nTeodora. [In a low voice.] I don't understand you.\n\nMercedes. Courage! [Takes her hand and clasps it affectionately. Teodora looks at her in sombre question.] Send him about his business.\n\nTeodora. If you insist. Ernest, will you do me a favour?\n\nErnest. Gladly—with a thousand wills.\n\nMercedes. [Aside.] One were still too many.\n\nTeodora. Then go upstairs—to Pepito——But it might bore you to carry a message.\n\nErnest. By no means.\n\nMercedes. [Aside.] In what a sweet, soft voice he speaks to her!\n\n29Teodora. Tell him—ask him if he has renewed our subscription at the Opera as I told him. He knows about it.\n\nErnest. With pleasure—this very moment.\n\nTeodora. Thanks, Ernest, I am sorry——\n\nErnest. Nonsense. [Exit.]\n\nTeodora. Adieu!\n\nSCENE VI\n\nTeodora. Something serious? You alarm me, Mercedes. Such mystery! What can it mean?\n\nMercedes. It is indeed very serious.\n\nTeodora. Concerning whom?\n\nMercedes. All of you.\n\nTeodora. All of us?\n\nMercedes. Julian, Ernest, and you.\n\nTeodora. All three?\n\nMercedes. Yes, all three. [Short pause. Both women stare at each other.]\n\nTeodora. Then make haste.\n\nMercedes. [Aside.] I should like to——but, no; I must go gently in this unsavoury affair. [Aloud.] Listen, Teodora. My husband is, after all, your husband's brother, and in life and death our fortunes are one. So that we owe one another in all things protection, help, and advice,—is it not so? To-day it may be I who offer assistance, and to-morrow, should I need it, I unblushingly claim it of you.\n\n30Teodora. You may count upon it, Mercedes. But come to the end of the matter now.\n\nMercedes. Up to to-day, Teodora, I shrank from this step, but Severo urges me. 'It can't go on,' he insists. 'My brother's honour and my own self-esteem forbid me to witness that which fills me with shame and sorrow. On all sides am I assailed with innuendoes, with the smiles, the covert glances and the reproaches of my friends. There must be an end to this low gossip about us.'\n\nTeodora. Continue, pray.\n\nMercedes. Then heed me. [They exchange a prolonged gaze.]\n\nTeodora. Tell me, what is the gossip?\n\nMercedes. The murmuring of the river tells us that its waters are swollen.\n\nTeodora. I understand nothing of your river and its swollen waters, but do not drive me wild.\n\nMercedes. [Aside.] Poor child! My heart grieves for her. [Aloud.] So you do not understand me?\n\nTeodora. I? not in the least.\n\nMercedes. [Aside.] How stupid she is! [Aloud, energetically.] You make a laughing-stock of him.\n\nTeodora. Of whom?\n\nMercedes. Why, of your husband, of course.\n\nTeodora. [Impetuously, rising.] Julian! what a falsehood! What wretch could say so? Julian would strike him!\n\nMercedes. [Endeavouring to soothe her and make her sit down.] He would need a good many hands, then; for, if report speak truly, he would have to strike the entire town.\n\n31Teodora. But what does it all mean? What is the mystery, and what is this talk of the town?\n\nMercedes. So you're sorry?\n\nTeodora. I am sorry. But what is it?\n\nMercedes. You see, Teodora, you are quite a child. At your age one is so often thoughtless and light, and then such bitter tears are afterwards shed. You still don't understand me?\n\nTeodora. No, what has such a case to do with me?\n\nMercedes. It is the story of a scoundrel and the story of a lady——\n\nTeodora. [Eagerly.] Whose name——?\n\nMercedes. Her name——\n\nTeodora. Oh, what does it matter?\n\n[Teodora moves away from Mercedes, who shifts her seat on the sofa to follow her. The double movement of repugnance and aloofness on Teodora's part, and of insistence and protection on Mercedes', is very marked.]\n\nMercedes. The man is a shabby-hearted betrayer, who, for one hour of pleasure, would thrust upon the woman a life of sorrow: the husband's dishonour, the ruin of a family, and she left shamed and condemned to social penitence in the world's disdain, and to keener punishment still at the whip of her own conscience.\n\n[Here Teodora, avoiding Mercedes, reaches the edge of the sofa, bows her head and covers her face with both hands. At last she understands.]\n\nMercedes. [Aside.] Poor little thing! She touches me. [Aloud.] This man is not worthy of you, Teodora.\n\nTeodora. But, madam, what is the drift of all this blind emotion? Do not imagine that my eyes are dimmed with fear or horror or tears. They burn with the flame of anger. To whom can such words be addressed? What man do you mean? Is it, perchance——?\n\n32Mercedes. Ernest.\n\nTeodora. Ah! [Pause.] And the woman I? Not so? [Mercedes nods and Teodora rises again.] Then listen to me, though I may offend you. I know not who is the viler, the inventor of this tale or you who repeat it. Shame upon the meanness that formed the idea, and shame upon the villainy that spreads it! It is so abominable, so fatal, that I almost feel myself criminal because I cannot instantly reject the thought and forget it. Heavens! could I suppose or credit such baseness? Because of his misfortunes I loved him. He was like a brother to me, and Julian was his providence. And he so noble and thorough a gentleman! [Stands staring at Mercedes, then turns away her face. Aside.] How she inspects me! I scarcely like to say a good word for him to her. My God! I am compelled already to act a part.\n\nMercedes. Be calm, child.\n\nTeodora. [Raising her voice.] Oh, what anguish! I feel cold and inconsolable. Stained in this way by public opinion! Oh, my dearest mother, and you, Julian, my heart's beloved. [She falls sobbing into a chair on the left, and Mercedes strives to console her.]\n\nMercedes. I did not imagine—forgive me—don't cry. There, I didn't really believe it was serious. I knew your past exonerated you. But as the case stands, you must admit that out of every hundred a hundred would accuse you and Julian of excessive rashness, or say you had led the world to conclude the worst. You a girl of twenty, Julian a man of forty, and Ernest between you, with his head full of romantic thoughts. On the one hand, a husband given up to business, on the other a youth to dreams, every day bringing its opportunity, and you there, unoccupied, in the flush of romance. It was wrong for people to conclude the worst because they saw you walking with him, and saw him so often at the theatre with you. But, Teodora, in reason and justice 33I think that, if the world was bent on seeing evil, you furnished the occasion. Permit me to point out to you that the fault which society most fiercely chastises, pursues most relentlessly and cruelly, and in every varied imaginable way, both in man and woman is—don't frown so, Teodora—is temerity.\n\nTeodora. [Turning to Mercedes without having heard her.] And you say that Julian——\n\nMercedes. Is the laughing-stock of the town, and you——\n\nTeodora. Oh, I! That's no matter. But Julian!—Oh, oh, so good, so chivalrous! If he only knew——\n\nMercedes. He will know, for at this very moment Severo is telling him.\n\nTeodora. What!\n\nJulian. [Inside.] That will do.\n\nTeodora. Oh, goodness!\n\nJulian. Let me alone.\n\nTeodora. Come away, quickly.\n\nMercedes. [Rushing with Teodora towards first door on the right.] Yes, yes, quickly. What folly! [Teodora and Mercedes go to the right.]\n\nTeodora. [Stopping suddenly.] But wherefore, since I am not guilty? Not only does miserable calumny stain us, but it degrades us. It is so steeped in evil, that, against all evidence, its very breath takes the bloom off our consciences. Why should an idle terror cast its mean influence over me? [At this moment Don Julian appears on the threshold of the first door on the right hand side, and behind him stands Don Severo.]\n\nTeodora. Julian!\n\nD. Julian. Teodora! [She runs over to him, and he folds her in a passionate embrace.] Here in my arms, dearest. It is the home of your honour.\n\n34\n\nSCENE VII\n\nTeodora, Doña Mercedes, Don Julian, and Don Severo. Don Julian and Doña Mercedes form the centre group.\n\nD. Julian. Let it pass for this once, but, please God! there's an end of it. Whoever in future shall stain this face with tears [pointing to Teodora], I swear, and mean it, will never again cross the threshold of my house—though he should be my own brother. [Pause. Don Julian soothes and comforts Teodora.]\n\nD. Severo. I only mentioned common report.\n\nD. Julian. Infamous!\n\nD. Severo. It may be so.\n\nD. Julian. It is.\n\nD. Severo. Well, let me tell you what every one says.\n\nD. Julian. Filth! abominable lies.\n\nD. Severo. Then repeating them——\n\nD. Julian. 'Tis not the way to put an end to them.\n\n[Pause.]\n\nD. Severo. You are wrong.\n\nD. Julian. Right—more than right. A fine thing it would be if I let you carry the mire of the street into my drawing-room!\n\nD. Severo. But I will do so.\n\nD. Julian. You shall not.\n\nD. Severo. You bear my name.\n\nD. Julian. Enough.\n\nD. Severo. And your honour——\n\n35D. Julian. Remember that you are in my wife's presence.\n\n[Pause.]\n\nD. Severo. [In a low voice to Don Julian.] If our father saw you——\n\nD. Julian. What do you mean, Severo?\n\nMercedes. Hush! Here is Ernest.\n\nTeodora. [Aside.] How dreadful! If he should know—— [Teodora turns away her face, and holds her head bent. Don Julian looks at her questioningly.]\n\nSCENE VIII\n\nTeodora, Doña Mercedes, Don Julian, Don Severo, Ernest and Pepito grouped from left to right. On entering, Pepito stands on Don Julian's side and Ernest walks over to Teodora.\n\nErnest. [Looking at Don Julian and Teodora. Aside.] He and she! It is no illusion. Can it be what I feared? what that fool told me. [Referring to Pepito, who at that moment enters behind.] It was not his invention.\n\nPepito. [Staring strangely about.] My salutations to all, and good appetite—as it is dinner-time. Here are the tickets, Teodora. Don Julian——\n\nTeodora. Thanks, Pepito. [Accepts them mechanically.]\n\nErnest. [To Don Julian in a low voice.] What's the matter with Teodora?\n\nD. Julian. Nothing.\n\nErnest. [In same tone.] She is pale, and has been crying.\n\nD. Julian. [Angrily.] Don't busy yourself about my wife. [Pause. Don Julian and Ernest exchange glances.]\n\nErnest. [Aside.] The wretches! They've completed their work.\n\n36Pepito. [In a low voice to his mother, pointing to Ernest.] He ought to have a strait-jacket. I quizzed him about Teodora. Poof! 'Pon my word, I thought he'd kill me.\n\nErnest. [Aloud, with resolution and sadness.] Don Julian, I have thought over your generous offer, and much as I've already abused your kindness, it goes sorely against me to refuse it now. But, sir, I feel that I ought to reject this post you offer me.\n\nD. Julian. Why?\n\nErnest. Because I am so fashioned,—a poet and a dreamer. My father, sir, trained me for no career. I want to travel; I am restless and liable to revolt. I am not capable of settling down like another. Like a new Columbus, I am bitten by the spirit of adventure. But we will appeal to Don Severo. He will decide if I am right.\n\nD. Severo. You speak like the book of wisdom and like a man of sense. I have been thinking as you do for a long while.\n\nD. Julian. Since when have you felt this itch for new worlds and travel? When did you make up your mind to leave us? And the means?—where are they?\n\nD. Severo. He wants to go away—to some place more to his taste than here. To be just, Julian, the rest is your affair. Give him as much as he wants, too, for this is no time for economy.\n\nErnest. [To Don Severo.] I don't traffic with dishonour, nor receive alms. [Pause.] Well, it must be so; and as our parting would be a sad one—for in this life, who knows? I may never come back, and may not see them again—it is better that we should shake hands now, here, Don Julian, and have it over. Thus we snap the tie, and you forgive my selfishness. [Deeply moved.]\n\n37D. Severo. [Aside.] How they stare at one another!\n\nTeodora. [Aside.] What a noble fellow!\n\nErnest. [To Don Julian.] Why do you withhold your hand? It is our last adieu, Don Julian. [Goes toward him with outstretched hands. Don Julian embraces him.]\n\nD. Julian. No, lad. The question well considered, this is neither the first nor the last. It is the cordial embrace of two honourable men. You must not mention your mad project again.\n\nD. Severo. Then he is not going away?\n\nD. Julian. Never. I have not the habit of changing my mind or the plans I have matured because of a boy's caprice or a madman's folly. And I have still less intention of weakly subjecting my actions to the town's idle gossip.\n\nD. Severo. Julian!\n\nD. Julian. Enough. Dinner is served.\n\nErnest. Father, I cannot——\n\nD. Julian. But what if I believe you can? Or does my authority begin to bore you?\n\nErnest. I beg you——\n\nD. Julian. Come, dinner is ready. Give your arm to Teodora, and take her in.\n\nErnest. [Looking at her, but holding back.] To Teodora!\n\nTeodora. [With a similar emotion.] Ernest!\n\nD. Julian. Yes, as usual. [There is a movement of uncertainty on both sides; finally Ernest approaches and Teodora takes his arm, but neither dares to look at the other, and both are abrupt and violently agitated.]\n\n38D. Julian. [To Pepito.] And you! The deuce, why don't you offer your arm to your mother? My good brother Severo will take mine. So, quite a family party, and now let pleasure flow with the wine in our glasses. So there are gossips about? Well, let them chatter and scream. A farthing for all they can say. I shouldn't object to a glass house, that they might have the pleasure of staring in at Teodora and Ernest together, and learn how little I care for their spite and their calumnies. Each man to his fancy.\n\n[Enter servant in black suit and white tie.]\n\nServant. Dinner is served.\n\n[The dining-room door opens and displays a well-appointed table.]\n\nD. Julian. Let us look after our life, since it will be the affair of others to look after our death. Come. [Invites the others to pass.]\n\nTeodora. Mercedes.\n\nMercedes"
