        "text": "History\n\nThe Fox & Hound is located on a site in Quincy well known for restaurants over the years.\n\nJames H. McManus opened the original Fox & Hounds Grille in 1936, just a few years after prohibition ended. Over the years, it became famous for its large Baked Stuffed Lobsters and Charcoal Broiled Club Sirloin Steaks. Perhaps even more famous than its food, the restaurant featured a cocktail lounge with nightly entertainment. A few of the more popular personalities that appeared frequently were \"Hugh McGinnes\" and later \"Hum and Strum\" and \"Bob and Ray\". The site was very successfully operated as the Fox & Hounds by the McManus family for over 30 years, who also operated another restaurant of the same name at the junction of Routes 18 and 27 in Whitman. The Fox & Hounds became known as the best place for special occasions.\n\nAfter McManus' ownership, the restaurant, beleaguered by fires, had a number of owners. The site was operated as a steak-house type restaurant known as Sir Loin for a short time. Dutton's established a long and successful run at the site, becoming known for its piano bar and late night crowd until it closed in the early 80's.\n\nThe long idle building was undergoing renovations when a disastrous fire destroyed it just before a planned re-opening by new owners in 1995. The only thing left standing after the fire was the original stone hearth fireplace still intact today. After rebuilding a replica of the original 1936 building, it was named the Custom House which operated for seven years.\n\nAbout Us\n\nAfter being vacant for two years and after extensive renovations, the restaurant re-opened as the Fox and Hound Wood Grille and Tavern on October 27th, 2004 which by chance was the same night the Red Sox won the World Series.\n\nThe restaurant which resembles nothing of its former days as the Custom House, offers exposed brick walls in the dining room, a floor to ceiling fieldstone fireplace in the Tavern, a newly constructed private dining room, and a newly redecorated function room.\n\nThe menu is chock full of classic American comfort food, but with a delicious contemporary twist. In addition, we offer entertainment in the Tavern every weekend.\n\nThe goal was to transform this historical location into a modern hot spot without the inflated metropolitan prices.\n\nCome and see us soon, we are certain you will have a wonderful dining experience."
