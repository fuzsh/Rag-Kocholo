        "text": "The Morehead-Cain Foundation — home of the first merit scholarship program in the United States, founded at the first public university in the country — is pleased to announce the first cohort to join the Morehead-Cain Class of 2026 as part of its Sophomore Intake Initiative. The students — all sophomores attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill — will be introduced as Morehead-Cain Scholars at the Foundation’s Fall Banquet on November 16, 2023.\n\nThe fifteen scholars come from five North Carolina counties, six states and China. Their fields of study at Carolina include statistics, computer science, biology, neuroscience, business, history, political science and education.\n\nMorehead-Cain launched the Sophomore Intake Initiative in September 2023 to identify a small cohort of current sophomores at UNC–Chapel Hill who have demonstrated exceptional scholarship, leadership and character and invite them to join the Morehead-Cain Program as members of the Morehead-Cain Class of 2026.\n\nThe process of selecting the cohort involves an extensive application review and participation in a Final Selection Experience assessed by members of the Morehead-Cain Central Selection Committee. Candidates enter the process via nomination from a wide array of individuals on campus, including professors, department heads, teaching assistants, and staff of scholarship, service, extracurricular and cultural programs.\n\nThe new scholars join a thriving community of thinkers, leaders, creators and adventurers at UNC–Chapel Hill, who are empowered to set their potential free. Scholars gain access to a network of peers and mentors, summer enrichment programming, advising, Lovelace Fund for Discovery, funded study abroad and a living stipend.\n\nThe Sophomore Intake Initiative allows Morehead-Cain to “accelerate the journey” of exceptional students who demonstrated their capacity for leadership in their first year at Carolina, according to Morehead-Cain President Chris Bradford.\n\n“UNC­–Chapel Hill is full of emerging leaders with wide-ranging interests and aspirations. We are honored to invest in that potential by offering opportunities to pursue global experiences, design research projects, and access impactful internships,” Bradford said. “The Sophomore Intake Initiative gives Morehead-Cain the opportunity to identify more emerging leaders and offer more transformational experiences to Carolina students who will shape this campus and the world.”\n\nSince its founding in 1945, the Morehead-Cain Program has been a model for countless merit scholarships throughout the United States. These include the University of Virginia’s Jefferson Scholars Program, Duke University’s Benjamin N. Duke Scholars Program and Emory University’s Woodruff Scholars Program.\n\nHigh-resolution images of the Morehead-Cain Scholars can be downloaded here.
