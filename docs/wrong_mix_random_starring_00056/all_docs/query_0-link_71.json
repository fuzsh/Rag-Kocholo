Along with these ends, it is\n\nconstantly sought to cultivate true womanliness, a womanli-\n\nness which combines strength with gentleness and refine-\n\nment. It is thus the aim of the College to send out educated\n\nChristian women to be a power in blessing the world and\n\nglorifying God.\n\nThe College was founded by Presbyterians, and hence its\n\nmoral standards and religious life conform as nearly as\n\npossible to those which obtain in that church. Special care,\n\nhowever, is taken not to interfere in any way with the re-\n\nligious views or church preferences of students.\n\nThe College offers only the B.A. degree. There are, how-\n\never, optional courses leading to this degree, thus giving the\n\nopportunity for each student to elect a course most in\n\naccord with her special talent and plans.\n\n14 Agnes Scott College\n\nADMISSION OF STUDENTS\n\nAll correspondence in reference to admission of students\n\nshould be addressed to the President of the College.\n\nFor several years the College has not been able to accom-\n\nmodate all of those seeking admission. There are three\n\nmain considerations for the acceptance of a student: (1) the\n\nexcellence of her preparation, as evidenced by a certificate\n\nor an examination; (2) her character and ability, shown by\n\ntestimonials and a psychological test; (3) the date of her\n\napplication for admission.\n\nAs it is not possible to secure full data until the closing\n\nof the various preparatory schools, it is usually not possible\n\nto give definite acceptance of an applicant before June 15th.\n\nApplicants who cannot be accepted at that date are placed\n\nupon a waiting list for spaces that may develop later. In\n\naddition to the general list, the College maintains an\n\n' ' honor group ' ' for exceptionally well prepared applicants,\n\nand these may often secure places even to the opening of\n\nthe college year.\n\nOnly graduates of four-year preparatory schools of recog-\n\nnized standing, or applicants who can offer equivalent\n\npreparation, representing four years of work in a recog-\n\nnized institution, will be received into the College. (For\n\nthe admission of special students, see page 21).\n\nApplicants for admission must not be under sixteen years\n\nof age. Candidates for advanced standing should be of an\n\nage corresponding to this rule.\n\nAdmission op Students 15\n\nEffective for all reservation of space for the session 1924-\n\n1925 and thereafter, a deposit of $25.00 will be required.\n\nOf this $10.00 will be known as the registration fee and\n\n$15.00 as room deposit. The registration fee ($10.00) will\n\nnot he refunded under any conditions, it is a charge for the\n\nextra expenses incurred through registration. The $15.00\n\nroom deposit will be refunded, provided the College is\n\nofficially notified of change of plan before July 1st. Upon\n\nentrance of the student this amount ($15.00) will be de-\n\nducted from the first payment due in September.\n\nAlso effective at the above date a registration fee of $10,00\n\nwill be charged non-resident, or day students, and will not\n\nhe refunded or credited on account. It is a fixed charge for\n\nregistration, the same as for resident students.\n\nFor September 1923, a deposit of $10.00 is required for\n\nthe reservation of space as heretofore.\n\nFor entrance requirements and for description of entrance\n\nsuhjects, see helow.\n\nFor admission hy certificate, see Page 22.\n\nFor entrance examinations, see page 23.\n\nENTRANCE SUBJECTS\n\nThe following subjects are accepted for entrance :\n\nEnglish 3 or 4 units\n\nMathematics 3 or 4 units\n\nLatin 3 or 4 units\n\nHistory 1, 2 or 3 units\n\nFrench 2 or 3 units\n\nGerman 2 or 3 units\n\nGreek 2 or 3 units\n\nSpanish 2 or 3 units\n\nPhysics 1 unit\n\n16 Agnes Scott College\n\nChemistry 1 unit\n\nBiology :\n\nBotany % or 1 unit\n\nZoology % or 1 unit\n\nPhysiography i^ or 1 unit\n\n*Bible 1 unit\n\ntMusic 1 unit\n\nGeneral Science 1 unit\n\nCivics % or 1 unit\n\nA unit represents a year's study of one of the above sub-\n\njects in a standard secondary school, constituting approxi-\n\nmately a quarter of a full year's work.\n\nIt is understood that in choosing the elective units no re-\n\nquired unit may be counted also as an elective unit, and also\n\nthat elective units may be counted only once.\n\nThe fourth unit in Latin and the unit in addition to the\n\nrequired 3 units in Mathematics will be accepted for en-\n\ntrance only by examination, when the student does not con-\n\ntinue these subjects in College.\n\nThe fourth unit in English is accepted only on examina-\n\ntion. See page\n\nThe entrance requirement work in French. German,\n\nGreek and Spanish may be done in College after entrance,\n\nbut will not count toward the degree.\n\nNot more than three units may be offered in History and\n\nCivics combined. See page 40.\n\nThe maximum number of units allowed in Science is\n\nthree. See page 40.\n\nSee page 41.\n\ntSee page 41.\n\nAdmission of Students 17\n\nSTANTUNG TO WHICH STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED\n\nThe College admits students: (I) as unconditioned Fresh-\n\nmen; (II) as conditioned Freshmen ; (III) as irregular stu-\n\ndents; (IV) to advanced standing ; (V) as special students.\n\nI.

As Conditioned Freshmen upon the presentation of\n\nfifteen complete units chosen from the list of accepted sub-\n\njects on pages 15-16 but lacking a maximum of two units of\n\nthose prescribed for unconditioned admission. These condi-\n\ntions in prescribed subjects must be removed before the be-\n\nginning of the second year.\n\nThe following restrictions upon such conditions must be\n\nobserved :\n\n1. The deficiency in no single subject (except in the case\n\nof a modern language or Greek) shall amount to more than\n\na year of preparatory work.\n\n2. Completed work to the following extent must be of-\n\nfered :\n\n(a) English to the extent of three units.\n\n(b) Mathematics to the extent of two units.\n\n(c) Latin to the extent of two units, if the minor re-\n\nquirement be chosen; or,\n\n(d) Latin to the extent of three units, if the major re-\n\nquirement be chosen.\n\nIII. As Irregular Students, without class standing, upon\n\nthe presentation of fifteen complete units chosen from the\n\nlist of accepted subjects detailed on pages 15-16, including\n\nthree units in English and two in Mathematics.\n\nThese students are required to take a minimum of four-\n\nteen hours of recitation a week, which may include Music\n\nand Art, but at least nine hours must be academic work.\n\nShould they later desire to arrange their courses for the\n\ndegree, credit will be given them for work already done in\n\nthe College, but they must meet all of the entrance re-\n\nquirements of degree students.\n\nIV. To Advanced Standing. A candidate may be ad-\n\nmitted to any of the higher classes on the following con-\n\nditions :\n\n20 Agnes Scott College\n\n1. She must present:\n\na. An honorable dismissal from the college she has at-\n\ntended.\n\nb. An official statement of entrance requirements and\n\nhow absolved.\n\nc. An official statement of studies pursued for credit.\n\nd. A catalogue of the institution with her completed\n\ncourses marked.\n\ne. An application for advanced credit properly filled out\n\nupon a blank provided by Agnes Scott College for this pur-\n\npose.\n\nNote. If the above certificates are not entirely satisfac-\n\ntory, a detailed statement of individual professors will be\n\nrequired.\n\n2. She must satisfy the entrance requirements of this\n\nCollege. If necessary, credits presented for advanced stand-\n\ning may be used to satisfy any deficit in the entrance re-\n\nquirements.\n\nIf as few as ten units have been presented for entrance\n\ninto the college from which the candidate comes, no credit\n\nwill be given towards the degree for courses that may remain\n\nafter deduction for entrance deficiency, except upon exami-\n\nnation.\n\n3. If she comes from a college which has been recognized\n\nby the Agnes Scott faculty as having equivalent require-\n\nments and standards for the B.A. degree, she will be given\n\ntentative credit course by coui*se, in so far as the courses are.\n\nin the opinion of the heads of the departments concerned,\n\nequivalent to courses offered in this College. An examina-\n\ntion on the work offered for advanced standing may be re-\n\nquired at any time, if the student's work should prove un-\n\nsatisfactory.\n\nAdmission op Students 21\n\n4. If she comes from a college of liberal arts which offers\n\nthe B.A. degree, but whose standards have not been so ap-\n\nproved, she may, upon the recommendation of the Com-\n\nmittee on Advanced Standing in consultation with the heads\n\nof the departments concerned, be admitted to courses which\n\ncontinue the work of the courses offered for advanced stand-\n\ning. Upon the satisfactory completion of these courses she\n\nmay be given such credit for the preliminary work as the\n\nheads of the departments involved may deem just, full\n\ncredit being given only in exceptional cases. No credit,\n\nexcept by examination, will be given for subjects not con-\n\ntinued in this College, nor will the degree be conferred\n\nupon such an applicant until she has completed at least\n\nthirty year-hours of work in this College.\n\n5. If she comes from an institution not included in either\n\nof the above classes, she will be required to take examina-\n\ntions for any advanced credit she may desire.\n\n6. No credit will be allowed for courses taken by corre-\n\nspondence except by advanced standing examinations given\n\nby this College.\n\n7. The B.A. degree will not be conferred upon any\n\nstudent who has not completed at least fifteen hours of work\n\nin residence during the session immediately preceding\n\ngraduation.\n\n8.

American History.\n\nOf these four units the student must offer one unit, and\n\nmay offer two additional units.\n\nThe examinations will be based upon modern high school\n\ntext-books.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that the preparation in His-\n\ntory include, besides the study of a text-book, parallel read-\n\ning, use of a notebook, taking of notes, and practice in the\n\nfilling in of outline maps.\n\nCivics\n\nOne unit of credit may be received for a course in Civics\n\ntaken throughout the year, or one-half unit may be received\n\nfor a course taken in combination with American History.\n\nOne-half unit of credit may be allowed for a semester course\n\nin Civics and one-half unit for a course in Economics, pro-\n\n40 Agnes Scott College\n\nvided these are taken in the last year of the high school. No\n\ncredit will be allowed for Economics alone. The total en-\n\ntrance credit of History and Civics may not exceed three\n\nunits.\n\nNatural Science\n\nThe student may offer one, two, or three units from those\n\ngiven below. Each should represent the work of one year,\n\nand should include a large amount of individual laboratory\n\nwork. The laboratory work should be directed by a compe-\n\ntent instructor and records made in a notebook, while in the\n\nfield or laboratory. A list of advised experiments will be\n\nsent with the blank for admission. Experiments must be\n\nchecked and certified to by the instructor. In doubtful cases\n\nthe note-book will be called for.\n\n1. Physics, one unit. The amount of work is represented\n\nby the requirements outlined by the College Entrance Ex-\n\namination Board, or such texts as Millikan & Gale. The\n\nlaboratory work must include at least thirty exercises from\n\nthe different phases of the sub jet and comprising a certain\n\nnumber of quantitative experiments. The division of time\n\nshould be three recitations a week of one period each, and\n\ntwo double periods for laboratory.\n\n2. Chemistry, one unit. The preparation in Chemistry\n\nshould consist of recitations, instruction by lecture table\n\ndemonstrations and laboratory work equivalent to five hours\n\neach week throughout the year. It is suggested that two\n\ndouble periods a week be given to individual laboratory\n\nwork.\n\n3. BioTjOGY, Botany, Zoology, one unit. A year in any\n\nof these subjects will be accepted for entrance, provided the\n\nwork in the courses meets the requirements of the College\n\nDescription of Entrance Subjects 41\n\nEntrance Examination Board. Preparation in these sub-\n\njects should require three recitations per week, and two\n\nlaboratory exercises of two periods each.\n\n4. Physiography, one unit. The work in this subject\n\nshould meet the requirements outlined by the College En-\n\ntrance Examination Board in the course in Physical Geog-\n\nraphy.\n\nGeneral Science, one unit. Credit is given for one\n\nyear's high school work in general science when such work\n\ncomprises both text-book and laboratory work. A laboratory/\n\nnotebook with original observations and conclusions must be\n\npresented in order to receive credit.\n\nMusic\n\nOne unit in the elective group may be offered in Music\n\nby examination only. This examination covers theory and\n\ninstrumental proficiency. The preparation for it may not\n\nbe done in College for College admission. For details of the\n\nrequirement, see pages 92-94. The examination may be\n\ntaken only at the College. Students are not advised to try\n\nfor this unit unless they have had unusual musical training.\n\nBible\n\nIn order to encourage the study of the Bible in prepara-\n\ntory schools, the College will accept, in the elective group,\n\none unit under the following conditions :\n\n(1) The applicant must come from a school giving a\n\nthorough course in either the Old Testament or the Ncav\n\nTestament, covering a full academic year and occupying ap-\n\nproximately one-fourth of the student's time for the year.\n\n42 Agnes Scott College\n\n(2) The outline of the course, methods of instruction,\n\nand a report of the student 's work must be submitted to the\n\nCollege Department of Bible for approval before an exami-\n\nnation will be given.\n\n(3) Credit will be given only after examination by the\n\nCollege authorities.\n\nCurriculum 43\n\nCURRICULUM\n\nADMINISTRATION OF THE CURRICULUM\n\nREGISTRATION\n\nStudents report first to the Treasurer's office, where the\n\nfinancial affairs are arranged; a card to this effect is\n\nfurnished them for presentation to the Registrar, where\n\nthey are registerd and given their matriculation cards.\n\nThey then meet with the appropriate committees for classifi-\n\ncation.\n\nNote. If, for any cause, a student fails to register in\n\ntime to attend her first scheduled lecture at the beginning\n\nof a semester, she is charged a fee of $5.00 for late registra-\n\ntion. This rule, which is automatic as outlined above, is also\n\napplied to students returning late from vacations, unless\n\ntheir excuses are approved by the Dean.\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nStudents are expected to make themselves thoroughly fa-\n\nmiliar with the plan of the curriculum and to arrange their\n\ncourses so as to conform with its demands. By so doing they\n\nwill greatly reduce the necessarily arduous work of the com-\n\nmittees.\n\nFirst year students present their cards to the Committee\n\non Admission, and their courses are selected with the advice\n\nof this Committee. On or before April fifteenth, all stu-\n\ndents at that time in residence are required to file with the\n\nRegistrar tentative statements of their courses for the next\n\nensuing year. These programmes are reviewed by the Com-\n\nmittee on Electives and approved or revised. The cards,\n\n44 Agnes Scott College\n\nwith the courses entered upon them in due form, are obtain-\n\ned from the Committee in the fall, presented to the profes-\n\nsors of the subjects, and, when they have been properly\n\nsigned, returned to the Registrar's office.\n\nAfter a course has been agreed upon by the student, with\n\nthe advice of the Committee on Admission or the Committee\n\non Electives, no change will be permitted, unless the\n\nquestion of the student's health be involved. All students\n\nmust be definitely classified within two Aveeks after their\n\narrival at the College.\n\nATTENDANCE ON LECTURES\n\nStudents are required to attend their lectures regularly\n\nand promptly. Absence from courses without due excuse\n\nresults inevitably in the lowering of the student's standing.\n\nProfessors are authorized to require students to make up\n\nsvork by taking written tests covering the periods lost\n\nthrough absence, whether the absence be excused or un-\n\nexcused.\n\nEXAMINATIONS\n\n1. General examinations are held twice a year, in Jan-\n\nuary and in May. Failure to attend any of these examina-\n\ntions, for any cause other than sickness, results in the drop-\n\nping of the delinquent from the student body. In case of\n\nabsence from examination because of sickness, the student\n\nwill be given an opportunity to take the examination in\n\nquestion at the regular time set for re-examinations. (Sec\n\nbelow.)\n\n2. Examinations for advanced standing upon work done\n\nin some other institution, or in the summer, must be taken\n\nat such time as may be arranged for by the professors whose\n\nCurriculum 45\n\ndepartments are concerned, provided that such examinations\n\nmay not be given later than December fifteenth for the first\n\nsemester's work, nor later than April fifteenth for the\n\nsecond semester's work. These examinations for advanced\n\nstanding shall be more extended than ordinary examina-\n\ntions. In case of a subject of three hours value the examina-\n\ntion shall be of at least five hours duration. In case of\n\nsubjects of less value, examinations shall be of correspond-\n\ning proportion. In case of failure on an examination for\n\nadvanced standing, no re-examination is permitted. These\n\nexaminations are given only at the College.\n\n3. Any student desiring advanced standing credit by ex-\n\namination must pass such examination before being ad-\n\nmitted to any advanced course in the given subject. The\n\nlatest date at which any advanced standing examination\n\nmay be given is in September of the year following the\n\nadmission of the student.\n\n4. Re-examinations are allowed in ease of conditional\n\nfailure. These examinations for the first semester's work\n\nare given in the second week of the second semester, and for\n\nthe second semester's work in the first week of the fall\n\nsemester next following. Those failing in the re-examina-\n\ntion will be required to repeat the course in question or\n\nforfeit the credit. In no case will more than one re-examina-\n\ntion be allowed in the same subject.\n\nIn case of unconditional failure in a subject, no re-exami-\n\nnation will be allowed.\n\n5. If for any cause students find it advisable to applj^\n\nfor examinations at any other time than that announced in\n\nthe regular schedule, or arranged for by the professors in-\n\nvolved, such applicants must present the Registrar's receipt\n\n46 , Agnes Scott College\n\nfor five dollars ($5.00) for each examination desired, before\n\nthe professors are authorized to give the same. Such exami-\n\nnations are known as \"Special\" examinations.\n\nThis regulation applies to re-examinations as well as to\n\ngeneral and advanced examinations.\n\nSEMESTER AND YEAR CREDITS\n\nA semester credit is the value in half hours of any course\n\npursued through one semester. Thus, if a course scheduled\n\nfor three hours a week for one semester be taken, the result-\n\ning credit towards the sixty-two hours required for the de-\n\ngree is one hour and a half. A year credit is the value in\n\nhours of a course pursued throughout the year. Thus, a\n\ncourse scheduled for three hours a week for the whole year\n\nwill give a credit of three hours towards the degree.\n\nSUMMER WORK\n\nStudents wishing to make advanced standing credits dur-\n\ning the summer must communicate their plans to the College\n\nCommittee on Advanced Standing and secure permisison to\n\ndo the summer work before entering upon it.\n\nLIMITATION OF HOURS\n\nIn order to prevent over-crowding of work, the following\n\nregulation of the student's hours has been put into opera-\n\ntion:\n\n1. The maximum number of lecture or recitation hours a\n\nweek for Freshmen shall be fifteen, and the minimum four-\n\nteen.\n\n2. The maximum number of lecture or recitation hours a\n\nweek for advanced students shall be seventeen, and the\n\nminimum fourteen. Second and third year students may\n\nnot take the maximum number of hours a week unless they\n\nCurriculum 47\n\nshall have received merit grade in at least two fifths of their\n\nwork for the preceding session. Fourth year students may\n\nnot take the maximum number of hours a week unless they\n\nshall have received merit grade in at least one-half of their\n\nwork for the preceding session.\n\n*MERIT HOURS\n\nGrades indicating the student's standing in any course\n\nare officially recorded as follows: \"A\", excellent attain-\n\nment; \"B\", very good attainment; ''C\", good attainment:\n\n''D\", passable attainment; \"E\", failure, with privilege of\n\nre-examination; \"F\", failure, without privilege of re-ex-\n\namination. The grades \"A\", ''B\", and \"C\" are known\n\nas \"merit\" grades. Beginning with the Class of 1924, at\n\nleast thirty of the sixty academic hours required for the\n\ndegrees of Bachelor of Arts must be of \"merit\" grade, the\n\nremaining hours of the course being made with a grade of\n\nat least \"D\". At least six hours of \"merit\" grade must be\n\ncredited to the student each year after the Freshman year.\n\nExact grades are not announced to students, their reports\n\ncontaining only the information: \"Passed with Merit,\"\n\n\"Passed,\" or \"Failed.\"\n\nNote. For a detailed explanation of the \"Merit\" re-\n\nquirements for admission to recognition in each of the three\n\nclasses Sophomore, Junior, Senior, see notes preceding the\n\nofficial Register of Students, page 138.\n\nREQUIRED RESIDENCE\n\nThe degree will not be conferred upon any student who\n\nhas not done at least one full session of work in residence.\n\nThe system of \"merit hours\" is substituted for the former system\n\nof \"merit points.\" The latter may be found described in the cata-\n\nlogue of 1919-1920.\n\n48 Agnes Scott College\n\nautomatic exclusion\n\nAny student whose work is notably unsatisfactory at the\n\nend of the first semester is considered to have excluded her-\n\nself automatically from the College, unless by vote of the\n\nfaculty she be put on probation for the remainder of the\n\nyear. If at the end of the year she shall have failed to make\n\ncredits to the extent of at least seven and one-half hours in\n\ncourses counting towards a degree, she shall be considered to\n\nhave excluded herself automatically from the College for the\n\nnext ensuing year.\n\nA student who fails for two successive years to meet the\n\nrequirements for advancement to the next higher class, auto-\n\nmatically excludes herself from the College, unless by vote\n\nof the faculty she be allowed to remain on probation.\n\nNote. In addition to the enforcement of the above laws,\n\nthe College reserves the right to request the withdrawal of\n\nstudents who can not remain in residence without danger\n\nto their own health or to the health of others, or whose pres-\n\nence is found to lower the moral tone of the College. Stu-\n\ndents of this last class may be asked to withdraw, even\n\nthough no specific charges be made against them.\n\nTHE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE\n\nCandidates for the B.A. degree must present sixty-two\n\nhours of work, of which two hours' value must be made in\n\nphysical education. Of the remaining sixty hours thirty\n\nand one-half are prescribed and twenty-nine and one-half\n\nelective. All courses are planned and electives chosen\n\nwith the advice of the Committee on Admission or the Com-\n\nCurriculum , ; 4:0,\n\nmittee on Electives. Since the design of the curric'iJwpu is\n\nto reserve elective courses for the more mature year of ihii\n\nstudent, the committees will allow postponement of the work\n\nprescribed for the Freshman and Sophomore years only in\n\nsuch cases as may for special reasons demand this procedure.\n\n(See Section (10) page 52).\n\n*1, The prescribed hours are as follows :\n\nEnglish 6 hours\n\nA modern language, or Greek 3 hours\n\nLatin, or a modern language, or Greek, or\n\na third science, or additional mathematics 3 hours\n\nMathematics 3 hours\n\nTwo of the three sciences, Biology, Chem-\n\nistry, Physics 6 hours\n\nHistory 3 hours\n\nBible Sy^ hours\n\nPsychology 3 hours\n\nZOYz hours\n\n2. The elective hours are to be distributed as follows:\n\n(a) A major subject must be chosen before the close of the\n\nsecond semester of the Sophomore year. With the advice\n\nand approval of the head of the department in which the\n\nmajor subject is selected, a minimum of nine hours in that\n\ndepartment must be taken, together with six additional\n\nelective hours also approved by the professor. \"Work in the\n\nmajor subject must be continued in the Junior and Senior\n\nyears.\n\n*One hour semester courses in Hygiene and Spoken English are\n\nrequired of all Sophomores.\n\nThe Spoken English is not counted towards the degree. For\n\nHygiene, see page 102.\n\n,50 ; Agnes Scott College\n\nMajor courses are offered in the following subjects:\n\nEhglisE, French, Latin, History, Biology, Chemistry,\n\nPhysics, Mathematics, Philosophy, Psychology, Philosophy\n\nand Psychology, Economics, and English Bible.\n\nNote. The following may not be elected to satisfy re-\n\nquirements as to the major or the related hours :\n\n(1) Elementary courses in languages.\n\n(2) Courses in Music, Art, History, and Spoken\n\nEnglish.\n\n(b) The remaining hours necessary to complete the re-\n\nquired sixty- two hours may be chosen at will, subject to\n\nthe following restrictions :\n\n(1) Not more than six hours may be taken under any\n\none professor in any given semester.\n\n(2) Students offering for entrance two languages in\n\naddition to Latin must continue one of these two lan-\n\nguages in the Freshman year. Those offering for en-\n\ntrance Latin and one other language must continue that\n\nother language in the Freshman year. This rule comes\n\ninto operation in the choice of the group of studies to be\n\ntaken in the Freshman year.\n\n(3) Students offering for entrance four units in\n\nLatin and no additional foreign language must take in\n\nthe Freshman year the elementary course in French,\n\nGerman, Spanish, or Greek. This elementary course\n\nwill be counted toward the degree only on condition that\n\nit be followed in Greek by Course 1 or Course 4, in the\n\nother languages by Course 1.\n\n(4) Students offering four units in Latin for en-\n\ntrance, even from accredited schools, who do not wish to\n\nCurriculum 51\n\ncontinue Latin in College, are required to pass an ex-\n\namination covering both, the Latin read in the last\n\npreparatory year and the entrance requirement in\n\nLatin prose composition. Such students will be re-\n\nquired to take two other languages in College, only\n\none of which may be in the Department of Romance\n\nLanguages.\n\n(5) Students offering for entrance one unit in a\n\nthird language must continue this third language in\n\nCollege, or take an examination on the work offered.\n\n(6) One year of a foreign language may be counted\n\nin making up the requirements for the degree only when\n\nthat language is the fourth foreign language that the\n\nstudent has taken.\n\n(7) If a third language is taken in College for en-\n\ntrance credit, it must be continued through Course 1.\n\n(8) Students who do not offer at least one of the\n\nthree sciences, biology, chemistry, or physics, for en-\n\ntrance, must take one of these subjects in the Freshman\n\nyear and another of the three later. Those offering one\n\nor more of these sciences for entrance, may elect history\n\ninstead of science in the Freshman year, taking one of\n\nthe sciences in the Sophomore year and the other in the\n\nJunior or Senior year.\n\n(9) Students electing Group D (see pages 53-54), but\n\nwho do not major in science or mathematics, are re-\n\nquired to take, in addition to the science and mathe-\n\nmatics prescribed for all students, an advanced course\n\nof three hours in the third of the three sciences, biology,\n\nchemistry, physics, or three additional hours in mathe-\n\nmatics.\n\n52 Agnes Scott College\n\n(10) Subjects prescribed for the Freshman or the\n\nSophomore year may not be postponed later than the\n\nJunior year. No postponement is allowed except upon\n\nthe advice of the Committee on Admission, in the case\n\nof first year students, or the Committee on Electives, in\n\nthe case of advanced students.\n\n3. In order to receive the two hours of credit required in\n\nphysical education, the student must have completed three\n\nyears of work in this department. Special arrangements will\n\nbe made for those entering with advanced standing.\n\n4. No student may receive the degree at any given Com-\n\nmencement unless she has obtained her full Senior standing\n\nby the 15th of the preceding April.\n\n5. For the requirements as to \"merit hours\" and resi-\n\ndence, see page 47.\n\nOUTLINE OF COTTRSES\n\nThe following outline indicates the courses that are offered\n\nto each class.
