        "text": "descriptionPrimarily letters to Keppler, including a record of events and people at the Tonawanda and Cattaraugus reservations, among others, over the first part of the twentieth century. Well known correspondents include noted Seneca scholar, Arthur C. Parker; artist Jesse Cornplanter; and Mohawk poet E. Pauline Johnson.\n\nOther parts of the collection include newspaper clippings on Iroquois subjects, government documents, Seneca vocabulary collected by Keppler, and other miscellaneous documents related to the Iroquois and the Six Nations. Newspaper clippings, obituaries, pamphlets, photographs, and notes are included with the correspondence.\n\nOther information includes correspondence about the collection itself, biographic information about the correspondents, clippings and documents regarding New York State land claims by the Caughnawagas and Saint Regis Indians, The New York State Museum, genealogic information, obituaries, clippings about the Wanamaker National Indian Memorial, photographs of a silver cross pendent, and correspondence regarding Iroquois masks.\n\nBio/History:\n\nUdo Keppler was a political cartoonist for Puck Magazine, and an avid collector of Indian artifacts as well as being an Indian activist. He changed his name to Joseph Keppler, Jr. in honor of his father. He was elected honorary chief of Seneca and given the name Gyantwaka.\n\nHe actively promoted Iroquois lacrosse teams, and his connections with the railroad enabled him to procure discount railroad passes for New York Indians, especially those travelling to Canada on Confederacy business. On the national scene, Keppler worked with others to defeat or substantially modify proposed legislation to allot the New York State reservations.\n\nPreferred citation:\n\nJoseph Keppler Jr. Iroquois papers, #9184. Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library./ Provenance: Huntington Free Library. Gift to HFL from Joseph Keppler, 1943.\n\ndescriptionThe papers cover the period from 1874 to 1939. Included in the collection are correspondence, personal diaries, lectures, field notes and other ethnographic papers, drafts, musical transcriptions, publications by various authors, maps and photographs.\n\nBio / His Notes:\n\nAlice Cunningham Fletcher (1838-1923) was an ethnologist with the Peabody Museum of Harvard and collaborator with the Bureau of American Ethnology, and Francis La Flesche (1856-1923), an anthropologist with the Bureau of American Ethnology.\n\nDue to the close professional and personal relationship of Fletcher and La Flesche, their papers have been arranged jointly.\n\nLoc. of Assoc. Material:\n\nAdditional material related to the professional work of Fletcher and La Flesche in the National Anthropological Archives may be found among the correspondence of the Bureau of American Ethnology and the records of the Anthropological Society of Washington.\n\nEthnographic photographs from the collection have been catalogued by tribe in photo lot 24; glass plate negatives have been catalogued by tribe in the BAE glass negatives collection.\n\nPortions of the collection have been microfilmed, including the entirety of Fletcher's incoming correspondence. Refer to appendix B for a list of microfilmed materials. Sound recordings made by Fletcher and La Flesche can be found at the Library of Congress.\n\nThe Nebraska Historical Society has diaries, letters and clippings regarding the La Flesche family, including correspondence of Francis La Flesche and Fletcher.\n\nThe Radcliffe College Archives holds a manuscript account of Alice Fletcher's four summers with the Nez Perce (1889-1892).\n\nCorrespondence between Fletcher and F. W. Putnam is also located at the Peabody Museum Archives of Harvard University.\n\nCite as:\n\nManuscript 4558, National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution\n\ndescriptionThe records document the governance and programmatic activities of the Museum of the American Indian/Heye Foundation (MAI) from its inception in 1904 until becoming part of the Smithsonian Institution in 1989.\n\nBio / His Notes:\n\nThe Museum of the American Indian/Heye Foundation was established by wealthy collector George Gustav Heye in 1908. Heye began collecting American Indian artifacts as early as 1897. Based first our of his apartment in New York, Heye bought collections and documentary photographs, sponsored expeditions, and traveled and collected items himself.\n\nIn addition, he sponsored numerous expeditions across the Western Hemisphere, including North American, Canada, South America and Central America. As he accumulated numerous objects it became apparent that he would need a separate space from his apartment to contain his burgeoning collection.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1917 Heye housed his artifacts on temporary loan at the University of Pennsylvania’s University Museum, Pennsylvania, in lofts on East 33rd Street in New York City, and at other depositories. However, once the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation was completed in 1916, the collections moved to their permanent museum location at Audubon Terrace, at 155th Street and Broadway in New York City.\n\nThe museum, containing ethnographic and archaeological collections from North, Central and South America, then opened to the public in 1922. Less than ten years later, Heye completed a storage facility and research branch in the Pelham Bay area of the Bronx.\n\nHeye served as Chairman of the Board and Museum Director until his death in 1957. After growing concern about the financial and other management of the collections came to a head, the museum became part of the Smithsonian Institution in 1989 and in 1994 opened exhibit and public program space in the U.S. Customs House at Bowling Green near New York City’s Battery Park.\n\nThe Cultural Resources Center in Suitland, Maryland later opened in 1999 and the main Washington, DC museum opened in 2004.\n\ndescriptionIt is difficult to determine exactly the dates of most of the material in the Otis T. Mason collection. Only a small percentage of the papers is dated correspondence, the bulk consisting of notes, articles, catalogues, clippings, and illustrations related to the United States National Museum basketry and knife collections and to the topics of \"Modes of Travel and Transportation\" and \"Mortuary \"Customs.\" From their content, much of this material seems to date to the late 1870s and 1880s, when Mason was working on these collections.\n\nAs far as actual dated material goes, Mason's own articles (not counting his collection of articles by other authors) and dated notes and letters cover 1884, 1888-1889, 1892, 1894-1904. It is presumed, then, that the collection generally spans the years from 1884-1904.\n\nBio / His Notes:\n\nOtis Tufton Mason had begun his professional career at his alma mater, Columbian University (now George Washington University), where he spent the middle third of his life (1861-1884) as a teacher and principal of the preparatory department. In 1872, Joseph Henry redirected Mason's interest from Eastern Mediterranean studies to American ethnology and introduced Mason to what was to become a 36-year career at the United States National Museum.\n\nFor the first twelve years, 1872-1884, Mason worked as one of S.F. Baird's unpaid part-time \"resident collaborators\" in ethnology. In 1884, Mason left Columbian University, where he had worked his way up to \"Professor of Anthropology,\" to become the Smithsonian's first full-time curator of Ethnology.\n\nIn 1902, he became acting head curator and, in 1905, permanent head curator, of the Department of Anthropology, serving as curator of the department until his death in 1908.\n\nLoc. of Assoc. Material:\n\nMaterial related to the Otis T. Mason collection is also to be found in the National Anthropological Archives Records of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Department of Anthropology, including the Division of Ethnology Manuscript and Pamphlet file.\n\nThe following materials in the National Anthropological Archives series of Numbered Manuscripts are also pertinent: A.S.W./Anthrop., Hist. of, 4821 (pt.): Box 4. \"Anthropology in the District of Columbia...\" (39 pages, dated 1906) and two letters pertaining to it; Anthrop., Hist. Of, 4903: \"Diary of Otis T. Mason..\" from 1 July 1884 to 23 May 1891 (approximately 100 pages); Arch., U.S., 2431: notes, sketches, and letters used in Smithsonian Annual Reports for 1876-1879 and 1881-1883; Athapaskan, 173 and Tinne (Kutchin), 169: translation and notes from works of Petitot (total of 68 pages); Choctaw, 666: revision of Byington's grammar of Choctaw (ca. 1872); Census, 4289: report on Indian education for the 10th census; Africa, Morocco, 7083: Choctaw, 4056; Fewkes 4408 (5-a); Mohaven 7036; and Pamunkey, 2218: various letters to Mason containing ethnographic or linguistic information (dated from 1891 to 1893).\n\nIn the United States National Museum Manuscript and Pamphlet File, Boxes 4, 14, 20, 35-40, and 70, is material on the topics represented in the Mason papers as well as other material produced by Mason. Additional material originally found with the Otis Mason collection was, from its nature and arrangement, determined to belong to the Manuscript and Pamphlet file and has been moved to that collection.\n\nThis material consists of numerous articles, notes, and manuscripts, including 14 manuscripts by Thomas Wilson of the Division of Prehistoric Anthropology, correspondence between W.H. Holmes and Zelia Nuttalll, and correspondence between A. F. White and Thomas Wilson. All are listed under \"Thomas Wilson\" in the guide to the Manuscript and Pamphlet file (Box 84).\n\nAdditional papers, consisting of administrative files and correspondence, were originally found with the Otis Mason collection but clearly belongs to the anthropology Department's own administrative files and so were moved to that collection in the National Anthropological Archives.\n\nCorrespondents included in the eleven letterpress books moved to the Anthropology Department collection are W. H. Holmes, Ales Hrdlicka, Walter Hough, and E. H. Hawley. These papers relate almost entirely to administrative matters directed by Mason and very little to Mason's own ethnological and anthropological research.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution Archives has a small series of copies of letters which Mason wrote to the Smithsonian in 1889 while on a trip in Europe to study museum practices (SIA 7086).\n\nCite as:\n\nOtis Tufton Mason Papers, National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution\n\ndescriptionCharles F. Lummis explored and documented the culture and history of the Southwest in his writings and photography from 1884 until his death in 1928.\n\nA resident of Los Angeles for most of his life, Lummis was city editor of the Los Angeles Daily Times, city librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library, an advocate of Native American rights, and founder of the Landmarks Club and the Southwest Museum.\n\nThis collection contains a portion of Charles F. Lummis' prolific correspondence to friends and colleagues, documents his tenure as Los Angeles Public Librarian, provides a sample of his photographic prints, and offers a rare glimpse of his early interests and activities through a personal scrapbook that he assembled during his college years.\n\nLummis' papers include manuscripts, typescripts, notes, articles about and by Lummis, news clippings, publications, photographic prints, legal transcripts, correspondence, invoices, and printed ephemera, all of which are related to his personal and professional interests.\n\nBackground\n\nCharles Fletcher Lummis explored and documented the cultures and histories of Spanish California and the Southwest through his writings and photography from 1884 until his death in 1928. He resided in Los Angeles for most of his life and influenced Southern California as city editor of the Los Angeles Daily Times, city librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library, and an advocate of Native American rights.\n\nHe gained fame in 1884 during his \"tramp across America,\" when he walked from Ohio to California, dispatching newspaper articles about his adventures and gaining respect for the Southwest and its people as he went. He wrote numerous books, reported on the injustices committed against Native Americans, battled to have Native American children released from government schools and returned to their families, advised President Theodore Roosevelt on \"Indian affairs,\" and established the Sequoya League to defend Native American rights. Lummis also photographed and explored the Southwest, Mexico, Central America, and South America, collecting artifacts along the way.\n\nHe also collected Native American and Spanish folktales and recorded many traditional songs on wax cylinders. He founded the Southwest Museum in Los Angles to share his collections with the public and established the Landmarks Club to restore the old Spanish missions.\n\nLummis' campaigns and editorials in favor of preserving Native American and Spanish culture were unusual for the time and often generated great debate.\n\nPreferred Citation\n\nCharles F.

It was while a senior at Dartmouth that Peabody first became interested in photography, producing views of the Dartmouth campus and scenes along the New England coast.\n\nAfter leaving Dartmouth, he spent an additional year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying architecture, electricity, and physics. After working for the Western Electric Company for a few years, he set up a studio first with Alexander Hesler in Chicago, and then in Boston in 1886, where he remained until his wife's death in 1898.\n\nIn Boston, he specialized in marine, landscape and architectural photography.

In 1900 Peabody accepted a position with the Detroit Publishing Company, the largest postcard publisher in the United States. He served as field photographer on both the east and west coasts until 1908. Shortly after joining the Detroit Publishing Company, Peabody relocated to Pasadena, and his primary focus shifted to the landscape of the American West. He also traveled to England and France in 1908 to photograph cathedrals and other architectural monuments.\n\nHe published the \"Swastika Educational Series,\" series of lantern slides, film slides, and films with accompanying narratives, that focused on national parks in the American West. He also delivered illustrated lectures that covered sites in California and the American West.\n\nPeabody's later years were spent selling photographic equipment and photographing the landscape around his home in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California.
