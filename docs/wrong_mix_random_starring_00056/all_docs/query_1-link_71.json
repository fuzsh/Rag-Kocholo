        "text": "When Spain in 1898 got involved with the United States in the war that brought about the final dissolution of her once vast colonial empire, it was possible for her to have possessed a weapon that could well have changed the course of history. This, naturally is purely conjectural and may be classed with all other classic “might have beens.” Perhaps since, due to her decadence, she was slipping anyway, the use of this secret weapon would have only delayed her inevitable descent to the chaotic conditions of 1936-39, when she was abruptly pulled up and started on a newer, more stable course by the present regime.\n\nThis “secret weapon” that she failed to develop and use, was a submarine that worked which she had by the year 1890. It was the prototype of all submarines of both World Wars up to the time of the snorkel and radar. It could cruise on the surface, accurately navigate submerged, and could fire torpedoes that hit the mark. In fact it could fulfill the functions of a submarine of limited cruising radius and sea-keeping qualities, good for coast defense, but no good as a commerce raider. In other words it was no Fleet Submarine as the term is now known. Except for the Gymnole, an experimental French submarine started after this one, no other nation in the world at that time possessed workable undersea craft— including Russia, although an argument might be forthcoming from that direction.\n\nThis submarine was invented by a Spanish naval officer by the name of Isaac Peral. He was one of three sons of a captain in the Spanish Marine Corps who died in Cuba contending with yellow fever and the Insurrectos. Peral was born in the seaport city of Cartagena, June 1, 1851. When he was very young, his family moved to Cadiz, where he grew up in a thoroughly nautical atmosphere. Near Cadiz, which is an important seaport itself, at San Fernando, were the Naval Academy, the National Observatory, and the Navy Yard of la Carraca, all tending to steer a young lad’s ambitions navywise. Isaac entered the Naval Academy in 1865 at the age of fourteen years. In accordance with the inevitable custom, which seems common to all navies, he received a nickname, “The Profound Isaac,” a tribute to his mental caliber, no doubt. He graduated in 1870 and after two years as a passed midshipman, he was commissioned an ensign. He became a naval officer of considerable competence and ability in the ensuing years. The usual tours of duty were assigned him afloat and ashore; Cuba in 1872, where he participated in the ructions with such intrepidity that Maximo Gomez, the rebel leader, put a price on his head; postgraduate student at the School of Application at the Observatory in 1877; the Philippines in 1881, where he wrote a treatise on hurricanes that earned him the White Cross of Naval Merit. He took part in suppressing the Carlist uprisingsand then was ordered back to the School of Application as an instructor in 1883. During this tour of duty he wrote two textbooks on mathematics for the use of midshipmen at the Naval Academy, and began developing his idea of the submarine.\n\nHe rose to an unbelievable peak of personal popularity as the news of the successful trials of his submarine became known. On his many official trips to Madrid from Cadiz, the platforms of the railway stations along the route would be jammed with Peral fans madly cheering. He would be escorted from the station in Madrid to his hotel, carried in from his carriage on the shoulders of his admirers, and then cheered from the outside until he was forced repeatedly to show himself on a balcony. Bullfighters dedicated bulls to him; streets were named after him— there is still a Peral Street in Madrid—collections from patriotic organizations for building more submarines poured in, one check for twenty thousand pounds came from an admirer in the Argentine. He was unable to answer but a fraction of the congratulatory messages he received. This popularity is reminiscent of the career of a contemporary of Peral in the U. S. Navy, Naval Constructor Richmond P. Hobson, who made the glorious failure of sinking the collier Merrimac in the wrong spot in an effort to plug the channel leading in to Santiago where the Spanish fleet was holed up in 1898. Both became very popular, made triumphal tours and resigned from their respective navies to run for congress, Hobson succeeding, Peral not. He also had the customary opposition to face, in the service and out: conservative older officers who believed the battleship to be the ultimo ratio regnum, and political opposition in the Cortes and Cabinet.\n\nLet us return to the Post Graduate School at San Fernando where Peral was an instructor and in his leisure time was mulling over the idea of the submarine. The storage battery had been discovered twenty years previously; by 1883 the Whitehead torpedo and firing tube had been perfected. Peral was an expert on both subjects, the storage battery and the torpedo, and he knew all there was to know at that time about the theory and application of electro-propulsion. Some of his shipmates at the Post Graduate School knew of his work and were helping him, but it was unknown to the rest of the navy and the country at large until 1885 when the Caroline Islands incident occurred.\n\nThis incident was caused by the German gunboat litis which boldly entered these Spanish-owned islands on August 25, 1885, hoisted the German flag, and claimed them for the German Kaiser, over the protests of the resident Spanish officials. When the news of the affair arrived in Madrid, great patriotic fervor was aroused. Mobs gathered before the German Embassy, burnt a German flag, and demanded war, not taking into consideration that at that time Spain would have thought twice about even taking on the State of Andorra, her army and navy being in such a weak and demoralized condition. However, Germany apologized for the incident and withdrew.\n\nThis affair, which could well have led to war, caused Peral, who was aware of Spain’s indefensible state, to submit his plans for a submarine to the Minister of Marine affairs, Vice Admiral Pezuela, in a personal and confidential letter. The Minister, recognizing the soundness of the idea, ordered Peral to Madrid in September, 1885, to report further on the subject. A board of technical experts was convened and, after thoroughly examining Peral’s idea, approved it. But Pezuela left the Ministry and the affair got all tangled up in red tape in the Navy Department.\n\nWith the plans of his project languishing in pigeon holes, Peral went back to teaching and to working further on them. He received some help from his friends at San Fernando, but he himself had to improvise practically everything from scratch. There was nothing to work with, and all the money he had was his $45.00 a month salary to finance his idea and to support a wife and five children.\n\nIn 1886 he was again ordered to Madrid where the Technical Commission approved his idea, but proposed such changes in the submarine, from an economical standpoint, that practically rendered it without any military value. Peral did not agree but took what he could get, 2,000 pesetas which was later increased to 5,000, granted him by the Board to begin the project. Back in San Fernando Peral bought a dynamo and converted a classroom into a workshop. Here he constructed his “aparato de profundidades,” an automatic device to keep the submarine at a set depth. This was probably a combination of a pendulum and a hydrostatic piston, but Peral kept it a secret and nobody knows exactly how it worked. He also carried on experiments perfecting a battery charger. The Commandant of the Naval District as well as the Board approved the aparato and battery charger, so in March of 1887 Peral went once more to Madrid to get a decision as to whether or not the Navy Department intended to go ahead with the building of the submarine.\n\nNow the Queen Regent, Maria Cristina, who was quite navy-minded, heard about the submarine and sent for the designer. As a result of Peral’s interview with the Queen, she was sold on the idea, and on April 20, 1887, a royal order was issued to go ahead with the project under the exclusive direction of Peral, and at the same time appropriating 600,000 pesetas for the work.\n\nPeral was now getting somewhere. In May of the same year he went abroad on a two months’ trip to Brussels, Paris, Berlin, and London to purchase the materials necessary for the construction of the submarine. Very little material of this nature could be found in Spain. When the purchases were assembled, the foremost naval constructor of Spain was consulted on the hull design; after the plans were minutely examined, corrected and added to, the keel was laid in a dry dock of the Navy Yard of la Carraca on January 1, 1888. By the 8th of September the hull was finished and the submarine was launched by flooding the dock. This was in the nature of a test for watertightness and was satisfactory.\n\nAfter these tests the submarine was put back on the blocks in order that the interior construction could be finished. At this time an irresponsible workman tried to wreck the submarine. He was stopped before too much damage was done. Although there had been rumors that the submarine was going to be sabotaged, it was not thought that this was a deliberate act of sabotage, but merely the work of a demented person.\n\nIn December Peral was ordered to the Navy Department in Madrid to draw up a program for the trials of the submarine. On this occasion a friend and enthusiastic supporter, and prominent officer of the navy, Don Pedro Novo y Colson, called an informal meeting of leading naval officers and civilian technical experts so that Peral could explain his invention to them. Among these was Don Jose Echegaray, the leading engineer of Spain. This group went over Peral’s plans thoroughly, Echegaray especially giving them a scientific going-over. They approved the plans and were enthusiastic about the whole idea. They were convinced that Peral had the plans of a workable submarine.\n\nThat evening a spontaneous patriotic manifestation, one of the many that were to follow, took place in front of the hotel where Peral was staying. He was cheered, Spain was cheered, and everybody wanted to see the man whose invention was going to restore Spain to her rightful place among the nations. He got a similar reception when he returned to San Fernando. These ovations were going to do him no good, as it turned out later.\n\nBy January of 1889 the submarine was finished and all that was left to do was to install the batteries and the important automatic depth keeper. Once more she was floated in the dry dock and various tests for watertightness and of the ballast tanks were made satisfactorily. After the batteries had been installed, they were charged. The torpedoes and all other necessary gear came aboard and were stowed.\n\nThe following were her characteristics:\n\nLength over all\n\n69 feet\n\nBeam at main frame\n\n9 feet\n\nDisplacement, surface\n\n79 tons\n\nDisplacement, submerged\n\n87 tons\n\nTwin screw, each motor\n\n30 hp.\n\nBatteries\n\n613\n\nSpeed, surface\n\n10 kts.\n\nSpeed, submerged\n\n8 kts\n\nCruising radius, surface\n\n355 miles Est.\n\nCruising radius, submerged\n\n326 miles Est.\n\nThe estimates of the cruising radii were made from the amount of power used on the various trials. The rated horsepower of the main motors was never reached on any of her runs. In addition to ballast tanks she had two vertical propellors for diving and depth keeping. These were actuated by the famous “aparato de profundidades” through servo-motors. She carried three torpedoes, one in the tube and two in racks. She differed from the modern submarine, however, in that she had no prime source of power aboard. Her batteries had to be charged from shore or from a mother ship. This is what limited her cruising radius. On the surface as well as submerged she ran on batteries. During her trials she was manned by a crew of six officers who were all experts in their various specialties, a machinist, and a quartermaster. Various other officers from the trial boards were embarked from time to time. In addition to the tanks of compressed air for breathing, she also had an “artificial lung.” This was a container of caustic soda through which used air was passed to remove the carbon dioxide and to be dehumidified. There were pumps to discharge contaminated air overboard. For access there were two hatches, one on each side of the conning tower. Any number of the instruments and gadgets in the conning towers of the submarines of World Wars I and II were to be found in the Peral—and most of them were devised or invented by the designer. There was a seeing device which seems to have been a combination of a periscope and the camera obscura, an electric log, a range finder, depth gauges and clinometers. The compass, magnetic naturally, on account of being entirely surrounded by steel, had special compensating magnets, devised by the inventor. Then there was a searchlight, a siren, an instrument panel, voice tubes, push buttons and all the rest. She carried eight tons of water as ballast, for stability only, not for diving. She was built of steel throughout and cost 300,000 pesetas.\n\nSuch was the type of war vessel that was going to make Spain and her navy the greatest in the world. It may not have been that good, but if Spain had gone ahead in the construction of forty or fifty of them, they would have presented a problem for other nations and navies to solve which they did not have to face until many years later. For this submarine worked. The imperfections and bugs that are inherent in any new machine could soon have been worked out. A prime source of power on board would have been the next step, the size increased, and a formidable weapon really developed. But it was not to be, fortunately for the American blockading squadron anchored off Santiago de Cuba several years later.\n\nShe was given a dock trial on March 6, 1889, and commissioned the following day, with appropriate ceremonies, a flowery speech by Peral, and with all of Cadiz as ardent spectators. She was named Peral in honor of her inventor. Most of the newspapers of Spain had reporters on the scene, so the event was well publicized. After the commissioning ceremony she got underway for a short triumphal cruise past the various spectator craft who upped anchor and followed her out to sea where she was to meet the tug on which the Trial Board was embarked. A bearing ran hot and the motor was stopped to effect repairs. While maneuvering to go alongside the tug she grounded. Although she was gotten off right away and suffered no damage, it was decided to return to the Navy Yard which she did on one motor.\n\nWhen the crew went ashore that evening they were almost torn apart by a mob of well wishers—girls kissed them, buttons were torn off their uniforms, guards finally had to keep back the crowd of people crazed by enthusiasm, sun, wine, and patriotism. Three days later, the bearing repaired, she got underway again but this time developed a short circuit which burnt out a coil. It was thought best to have one of the crew go to London and take the coil to the factory for repair. He returned on May 7th with the repaired coil, plus a spare, as well as a lot of other necessary material. The Peral stayed in the Navy Yard undergoing overhaul and alterations until July 17, 1889, when Peral took don Carlos Casado de Alisal, the Argentine benefactor (he of the £20,000 gift who had recently arrived from Buenos Aires) for a spin around the harbor of Cadiz. This was accomplished with no casualty occurring and to the edification of thousands of cheering fans lined up on the house tops and the sea wall of Cadiz. That night don Carlos Casado celebrated the event with a dinner at the leading hotel of Cadiz.\n\nDuring the period between trials, while the submarine was tied up in la Carraca, the two factions, the Peralistas and the anti- Peralistas turned on one another. The grounding on the first trip and the burning out of the coil on the second, gave the anti- Peralistas plenty of ammunition for a broadside of criticism. They knew it wouldn’t work; they whispered that the crew had jumped overboard and had swum to safety on the occasion of the grounding. A leading daily newspaper poohpoohed his automatic pilot and claimed it to be a mere adaptation of the one in the Whitehead torpedo; further, that the submarine was good for nothing. A letter signed by all members of the Peral's crew was sent to a friendly periodical and published, stating that far from abandoning the ship, they had such confidence in her that all were ready to go to the bottom with her before deserting their post of honor.\n\nPeral’s answer to his enemies’ unjustified attacks was to get the submarine ready for another trial trip. By July 26, 1889, she was ready for the habitability tests, to try out the artificial lung. Twelve persons entered the sub and the hatches were dogged shut. They remained three hours sealed up in the submarine, carrying on normal activities and even smoking. All came out of the test in good shape and noted no difference between the air outside and that inside on leaving.\n\nThe Minister of Marine had ordered that the tests of the submarine be conducted in secrecy, so until the 27th of August, various immersion and machinery tests were held in the dock. Dives were made both by using the vertical propellers actuated by the “aparato de profundidades” and by flooding diving tanks to take her down. These tests demonstrated that all gear worked well; the pumps discharged the water from the tanks efficiently and rapidly; the batteries rendered admirable service. The diving tests could not have been more conclusive—she had submerged and come up again in the space of a few minutes.\n\nIn spite of official orders and the posting of “No Visitors” signs, the tests were conducted with something less than secrecy; pictures were taken of the tests and published, as were articles by members of the crew, describing various items of her equipment. As for the trial trips, they were conducted for the profit of all Andalusia, gathered on the Cadiz sea wall or embarked in all manner of craft, getting in the way and making general nuisances of themselves. It speaks well for the maneuverability of the Peral that in all of this dodging of small boats loaded with well wishers, on the many trips she made in and out of the harbor, she only collided once with one of them.\n\nSo passed the greater part of the summer of 1889. On August 27th she put out to sea for torpedo firing tests—before admiring throngs as usual, and a visiting Italian Squadron of three ships in the harbor. Three torpedoes were fired at an anchored target at a range of 500 meters. Each hit the mark. This test satisfied the Trial Board. On the morning of September 3rd she got underway to go out to sea for further trials, but fog set in and she went aground again where she stayed all day until tugs, assisted by the rising tide, got her off. Although not damaged, all tests were suspended until the end of November, to the great glee of the Peralophobes, who pointed out, that if she couldn’t see in a fog how could she see underwater, etc., etc.\n\nDuring this time Feral made a quick trip to Paris to see the Exposition. Unfortunately he neglected to get formal leave papers and was charged with being Absent Without Official Leave when he returned and was placed under arrest to await trial by a General Court Martial. Tests of the submarine were held up pending the Court’s action. At the same time he got into trouble over a message he had sent to friends in the Argentine. A local paper published what purported to' be the telegram, giving all kinds of grossly exaggerated details of the trials of the submarine. This in the face of the secrecy orders made it hot for Peral. The article was proven false and Peral was cleared of the secrecy violation. A Congressman interested himself, and on the Floor asked why the tests of the submarine had been held up while all of Spain impatiently awaited results. The Minister promised immediate action and convened a new Board to conduct final trials.\n\nWhile awaiting the Court’s action some necessary weight distribution tests were made on board the sub in the Navy Yard. Another headache came up—what should be done with the £20,000 gift from the Argentine benefactor, made to Peral personally? In view of the complications involved in its use, he decided to return it to the donor, which he did. At last the proceedings of the Court Martial were stayed, in view of the insignificance of the charge and the good record of the accused.\n\nNow Peral was free to go ahead with the trials, so on November 30, 1889, tests for stability, visibility, and immersion were conducted in the open sea off Cadiz. After various maneuvers, diving and emerging, the Peral went down and stayed on the bottom in six fathoms for two hours and a half. This performance satisfied the Board and even converted some of the opposition. Bad weather delayed further tests for a few days. These trial trips continued, when the weather permitted, through the rest of the year. On Christmas day the Peral made a submerged run of two miles in fifteen minutes, showing that she could make eight knots submerged.\n\nOn January 15, 1890, orders were issued for the final tests. After one run on that date in a rough sea things seem to have been held up until May. The weather continued bad but Peral decided to go out any way, chiefly to silence the critics who maintained that the Peral was not seaworthy and could go out only in fair weather. At 6:00 a.m. on the 22nd of May he got underway and stood out from the Navy Yard in a fresh northeast wind and a sea so rough that Peral and his executive officer had to go inside the conning tower, close the hatches, and con from there, once out of the lee of the port. The Peral cruised partially submerged with just the conning tower awash. The wind shifted to the east and the sea got rougher. The sub although rolling and pitching considerably was negotiating her prescribed course and speed handily when the Colon, on which the Trial Board was embarked, signalled her to discontinue that day’s trials and return to port. This day’s test had been a real one. The crew of eight had been closed up in the submarine, breathing with the help of the artificial lung for eight hours and a half. In this time she had traveled 45 miles in a very rough sea. The Trial Board deemed it convincing and so stated. About two weeks later with her batteries recharged, she got underway to do over the fifty mile test that the bad weather had interrupted. She did it easily following it up with five crash dives in succession. The next day, June 7, 1890, was to be the important day for the submerged run. By early morning the bay was filled with spectator craft, all loaded down with ardent Peral supporters. The gunboat escorts having cleared a passage, the Peral got underway and stood out to the open sea to the southward of Cadiz. After a few preliminary maneuvers and short dives, one of fifteen minutes and another of twenty, she went down six fathoms and stayed for an hour and five minutes underway on a set course and speed of 3 ½ knots. Upon emerging Peral took her alongside the Colon, which was carrying the Commandant of the District and the Trial Board. He was warmly received by them, and congratulated in the name of the King, and Queen and the Spanish Navy.\n\nThe following is quoted from the Trial Board’s report. “The practical results of the tests of these days are: that the Peral demonstrated thereby, even with the defects of construction from which it suffers, that it could submerge with relative facility, and navigate for short intervals at various depths; that during the dives she was completely lost to sight shortly after submerging; that it was not easy to know where she would reappear without prior knowledge of her course and speed; that she could navigate for over an hour at a depth of six fathoms, according to the captain’s statement, on a determined course and speed a little less than that on the surface. The importance of this test, that the signers of this report believe to be the first that has been made with satisfactory results in the open sea and for a relatively long interval of time at a previously set course and speed cannot go unrecognized.”\n\nIt may well be wondered why it took so long to make all these tests; from March 7, 1889, when she was commissioned, until June 23, 1890, the date of her final tests, a period of fifteen months. Could it have been true that this submarine was all the opposition claimed her to be, and, like a lady’s watch, always out of repair? Well it could have been something like that. But it must be remembered that she was the first of her kind and that practically everything that went aboard her was being used for the first time on any submarine and had to be improvised, adapted or invented for the purpose, and that in all of Spain there was little if any material of this technical nature to draw upon. It also must be realized that the Spanish tempo is different from ours today, to say nothing of what it was seventy years ago when the tempo of the whole world was geared to a slower pace.\n\nThe news of this final successful test was soon spread throughout the country as virtually all the papers of Spain were covering the event. Everyone in Spain from the Queen Regent, who presented him with a Sword of Honor, on down including Cabinet Ministers, Governors of provinces, Alcaldes of cities, Chambers of Commerce, to lowly cigarette girls in the tobacco factories congratulated him and wanted to embrace him.\n\nNow at the peak of his popularity, he made the first of two mistakes by involving himself in matters outside his natural orbit. In Madrid a servant girl had been condemned to death for the murder of her mistress, unjustly so according to popular opinion. Peral identified himself with her cause interceding in her behalf to such an extent that his friends and acquaintances avoided meeting him on the streets. The poor girl was executed in spite of Peral’s efforts to save her. This affair did him great harm in high places.\n\nOn June 23, 1890, two weeks after the successful submerged runs, the Peral went out to practice attack runs on a target underway, the Colon. The successful day runs were followed that same evening by night runs. Both tests were conclusive, the Peral having successfully evaded all efforts of the lookouts of the Colon, aided by searchlights, to locate her. Peral’s popularity showed no decline, so at the urging of his friends he offered himself as a candidate to the Cortes from the district of Puerto Santa Maria, running against the son of the new Minister of Marine. The Minister promptly sent for Peral to report immediately to Madrid. He arrived in Madrid the morning of the 16th of July, to a tumultuous reception by what seemed to be most of the inhabitants of the capital. It was with difficulty that he made his way through the excited crowd of Madrilenos to his hotel and later that morning to the Navy Department. No part of this public acclaim went unnoticed by the Minister. After an unpleasant interview with Minister Beranger, who practically ordered Peral to withdraw his candidacy in favor of his son, Peral went back to his hotel accompanied by the same adulation from the crowd as before. That night he went to the railway station to see the Queen off to San Sebastian where he got more cheers than did the Queen. This bordered on lese majesty; it was whispered in her ear that he was a Republican.\n\nHe returned to Cadiz on the 22nd of July to await action by a new Board convened by Beranger to report on the submarine. This Board after picking to pieces the findings of the other Boards, found that the submarine Peral had “defrauded its conceived expectations and that its deficiencies were of such consideration that the ship as constructed served no useful purpose.” They proposed that if another were to be built it be done without Peral’s help or advice. Thus were lost Peral’s ambitious and practical plans for a submarine and Spain’s opportunity to acquire an arm that would have stood her well in 1898 at Manila Bay and at Santiago de Cuba. She made no further efforts to go ahead with the development of the submarine, notwithstanding the remarkable progress already made along that line. The unhappy results of the navy meddling in politics and vice versa are too evident to be pointed out. Just what would have happened during our war with Spain in 1898 had she a submarine force can be imagined. There would have been a different kind of war.\n\nIn view of the course of events, Peral decided that there was nothing left for him to do but to resign from the navy, which he did effective January 5, 1891, not without first issuing a lengthy “Manifiesto a Espana” or apologia in justification of his acts.\n\nThere remained his candidacy. He made a few campaign speeches before the election which took place on the 2nd of February. Despite his great personal popularity, and to the surprise of everybody he came out slightly behind Beranger who had the “machine” behind him. The election was contested, Peral charging the opposition with fraud, and the ballots were sent to Madrid for a recount, and Peral was declared the loser. His popularity diminished and he was soon forgotten like many another prominent hero. In order to make a living he started an electrical and storage battery business which was not very successful.\n\nAs time went by an infection he had acquired in the Philippines began bothering him more and more. He went to Germany for treatment, and there he died on May 24, 1895. He was buried first at Madrid and then later reinterred at Cartagena where he was born. There he rests today, not too far away from where his brain child occupies a place of honor on blocks in the center of the Navy Yard."
