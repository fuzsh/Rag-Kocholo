        "text": "Joaquín Sorolla (1863-1923) is the first major, monographic exhibition to be devoted to the artist since the one also organised in the Casón del Buen Retiro by the Ministry of Science and Education in 1963. It is also one of the most important ever organised, in Spain and abroad on this great 19th-century painter, both with regard to the number of works and their quality. The exhibition brings together around one hundred paintings by Sorolla, the most internationally known Spanish artist of his day and one of the key figures in the history of Spanish art. It offers a comprehensive survey based on examples of his finest works and includes the fourteen panels known as the Vision of Spain painted for The Hispanic Society of America, which were brought to Spain in 2007 by Bancaja, sponsor of the present exhibition.\n\nBesides the collaboration of numerous private collections and institutions all around the world, the contribution of the Museo Sorolla (Madrid) deserves a special thanks, since it loans a group of fourteen works among them some of the artist's masterpieces.\n\nThe exhibition has a fundamentally chronological structure, organised into various sections that emphasise the importance of the various themes and subjects that Sorolla depicted at different periods in his career. For example, there is a space dedicated to the paintings of social themes that brought the artist fame in the last decades of the 19th century. This is followed by a sizeable group of portraits and a nude that reveal the profound influence of Velázquez on his compositions during the early years of the 20th century. Another area displays his finest beach scenes, painted in 1908 and 1909. Due to their particular importance and large size, the fourteen panels of Visions of Spain painted for the Hispanic Society of America will fill an entire room of the four occupied by the exhibition. This spectacular group was the most complex and important decorative scheme of Sorolla’s entire career and can also be seen as an epilogue and summary of his entire oeuvre. The exhibition ends with examples of his landscape paintings.\n\nDespite Sorolla’s initial plans to represent all the regions of the Iberian Peninsula in an orderly fashion on the walls of the Hispanic Society Library, the subjects he portrayed and the painting trips he made to various Spanish provinces emerged gradually, according to the painter’s interest. He first painted the large panel Castile, the Bread Festival, between 1912 and 1913, which, due to its monumental dimensions and grand aspirations, took longer to complete than any other in the series. From March to April 1914 he tackled the first panel on Seville, Holy Week Penitents. In the summer of 1914 he painted Aragon, The Jota; Navarre, The Town Council of Roncal and Guipúzcoa, The Game of Skittles. That autumn he worked on another panel, Andalusia, The Round-up, his last piece of the year. He started off 1915 with two more panels depicting Andalusian themes, Seville, the Dance and Seville, the Bullfi ghters, which kept him busy until April. That same summer he painted Galicia, the Pilgrimage, followed by Catalonia, the Fish, in September. Between January and March of 1916 he worked on Valencia, Couples on Horseback. He then rested for nearly a year, until the following October, when he began Extremadura, the Market. In November of 1918 he returned to Valencia, where he painted Elche, the Palm Grove. After fi nishing that panel, in January of the following year, Sorolla went back to Andalusia to make the last painting in the series, Ayamonte, the Tuna Catch, which he completed in June of 1919.\n\nThe illness that fi rst surfaced when he was fi nishing the last panels, and which led to a stroke in 1920, prevented him from overseeing the mural’s installation in the room for which it had been painted. In 1922 the panels were sent to New York, but they were not hung in the Library of the Hispanic Society of America until 1926."
