        "text": "The College of the South ShoreTM\n\nThe college offers three baccalaureate degree programs, 35 associate degree programs and 21 certificate programs in a variety of disciplines, including those within Professional Programs, Liberal Arts, Natural & Health Sciences, and Nursing. The college is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE), and is licensed by the Board of Higher Education of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to grant the degrees of Associate in Arts and Associate in Science; a Bachelor of Science in Business Management; and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. The college draws a diversity of students from the greater Boston area, as well as 100 countries around the world.\n\nQuincy College Mission Statement\n\nQuincy College offers open-access and selective programs focusing on academic achievement and excellence, fostering diversity, providing economic opportunity, promoting community involvement, and supporting lifelong learning. We foster valuable learning relationships that inspire students to realize their educational and professional futures.\n\nQuincy College History\n\nDuring the mid-1950s, demand for higher education on the South Shore, and Quincy in particular, led to the creation of the Citizen’s Committee appointed to study the feasibility of establishing a community college. This committee recommended that a community college should exist and as early as 1956, the first college-level courses are offered.\n\nIn May of 1958, College Courses, Inc., a non-profit charitable organization, was officially formed to help further higher education on the South Shore. In the Fall of that same year, the first freshman class began at what will later be known as Quincy College.\n\nLess than five years later, Quincy College was empowered to award the Associate in Arts and the Associate in Science degrees.\n\nIn 1991, the school founded the Plymouth campus located thirty minutes south of Quincy in downtown Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\nWhat are my FERPA rights?\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nHow do I transfer credits from another school?\n\nCredits earned at other accredited, degree-granting institutions may be applied toward your degree or certificate program at Quincy College. To transfer credits, have your former college send an official transcript of your grades to Quincy College’s Registrar. To qualify for transfer credit, courses must correspond to offerings at Quincy College and a minimum grade of “C” must have been earned. Students are required to provide a catalog or an official course description from the institution where the credits were earned.\n\nHow do I get CLEP credits?\n\nQuincy College recognizes that many people have acquired skills from work experience or private study. Students who demonstrate this knowledge by satisfactory performance on a College Level Examination Program Subject Examination (not a CLEP General Examination or American College Testing Exam) will be awarded credits for that subject, based on the American Council on Education scoring recommendations. Although Quincy College is not a testing site, you may call the College Board at 781-890-9150 for registration and testing sites. Students awarded credit will be required to pay a per credit fee.\n\nHow do I get a verification letter for insurance or apartment rental?\n\nOur institution has authorized the National Student Clearinghouse to act as our agent for verifications of current student enrollment. Please visit the Clearinghouse online or call them at 703-742-4200. If you have further questions, please contact the Registrar at 617-984 1650.\n\nIs tutoring available?\n\nFree tutoring is available to all Quincy College students at the Nicastro Learning Center and the Plymouth Learning Center. Students may sign up for a tutor in a particular subject or stop by their drop-in hours. Students can contact our Student Development Office at (617)984-1656 for more info.\n\nDo I need to purchase health insurance?\n\nBy Massachusetts state law, some students who register for college courses may be required to purchase health insurance if they are not covered by a comparable health insurance policy. If you already have health insurance that is a comparable insurance policy (most HMO and PPO plans qualify), you can waive your health insurance charge. The deadline to waive your health insurance charge is located here.\n\nAll students who are enrolled in nine (9) or more credits in a semester, or who plan to enroll in nine or more credits in a semester (generally three courses), are required to have basic health insurance. By law, Quincy College automatically charges all students who are registered for nine or more credits with this health insurance fee. Coverage is $25,000. Additional coverage may be purchased at additional cost.\n\nHealth Insurance is required for all students who have clinical placements (nursing, surgical technology, etc) regardless of whether they are part-time or full-time.\n\nIf a student has comparable health insurance (most HMO and PPO plans qualify), then the student must click here to complete a waiver online for the College to remove these charges from the student’s account.\n\nVisit Gallagher Koster for more information about the health insurance waiver. If you have any questions, please contact the Quincy College Business Office at (617) 984-1630.\n\nNOTE: The Massachusetts Free Care Program (Free Care) is not acceptable as qualified student health insurance.\n\nWhat are the tuition and fees?\n\nTuition at Quincy College is dependent on what program you are enrolled in.

These events, open to all who are interested, offer our prospective students a chance to visit our campus, meet Quincy College’s faculty and staff and learn more about our programs. For specific dates and times, please visit the QC Calendar.\n\nDo you have an Orientation Day?\n\nQuincy College offers an orientation program for all our incoming students. The program, held at the beginning of each semester, is designed to familiarize new students with the organization, services, and facilities of the College. The program provides students with an opportunity to meet members of the faculty and the administration. The role of advising is emphasized throughout the program, as is the social interaction among students and an introduction to life at the College.\n\nWhat if I do not meet QC's English language proficiency requirement?\n\nBeing prepared is a key to academic success. Students who have completed secondary school but do not meet Quincy College’s English language proficiency requirement can obtain conditional admission through an agreement with Quincy College and ASC English by enrolling at ASC English in Boston, click here to learn more.\n\nAdditional ESL resources can be viewed here>>\n\nHow do I get to Quincy College? Are you located near a \"T\" station?\n\nWhether you have a car or not, commuting to class at Quincy College is easy. We have two conveniently located campuses in Quincy and Plymouth, Massachusetts. Our campus located in Quincy is only one block from the Quincy Center “T” Station. Click on the appropriate link below to get driving directions to either Quincy or Plymouth and find out how to get to our Quincy campus using the “T”.\n\nClick here for directions.\n\nWhat happens if I get called to Jury Duty and have to miss a class?\n\nNOTIFICATION OF JURY DUTY LAW:\n\nAccording to the office of the Jury Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, “Every U.S. Citizen 17 years of age or older who is a Massachusetts resident and an inhabitant for more than 50% of the time is eligible to serve as a juror. If you are a resident of another state but a student at a Massachusetts college, you are an inhabitant for more than 50% of the year and, therefore, eligible to serve as a juror in Massachusetts.” Students who miss class in order to fulfill their jury service requirement should notify each of their instructors of the summons and make arrangements to complete any missed work. Students should contact their dean if they need assistance in making arrangements for missed class time.\n\nWhere do I purchase my textbooks?\n\nQuincy College makes buying the books you need for class easy. To obtain required books for each course, you may simply bring your class list or schedule into the Quincy College Barnes and Noble Bookstore and the staff will assist you in getting the books you need.\n\nThe Quincy Campus Bookstore is located at 1250 Hancock Street, Quincy MA 02169, inside Presidents Place. The telephone number is 617-405-5934.\n\nThe Plymouth Campus Bookstore is located at 36 Cordage Park Circle, Plymouth MA 02360. The telephone number is 508-732-0279.\n\nHow much time will I need to commit to each class per week?\n\nIn order to help you succeed, Quincy College would like you to know that 3-credit lecture courses require 3 hours of in-class time per week of a 15-week semester. These courses also require a minimum of 6 to 9 hours of study/homework time on average per week. This time may vary week to week, depending on the schedule of the course (e.g. weeks where there are exams or other assignments due may require you to put in more time in order to be successful). Further, writing intensive courses and STEM courses often require even more study/homework time and should be planned accordingly. A one credit laboratory course generally meets for 2 hours per week of a 15-week semester and requires that you spend an additional 2 to 3 hours of study/homework time per week**. Please take this information into consideration when forming your schedule and allow yourself enough time to do the work to earn the grade you desire.\n\n** CHE 223 meet for 4 hours per week during a 15 week semester.\n\nDoes Quincy College have housing?\n\nQuincy College has no on-campus housing, so students must find their own accommodations.

Submit a ticket to the QC Support Portal online and a Quincy College representative will assist you.\n\nQC Feedback\n\nDo you have comments, concerns or complaints? We want to hear from you!
