        "text": "When I was a kid, my bedtime was non-negotiable. It was pretty simple: my dad would stare in my direction and without argument (because I didn’t want to lose a limb) I would head to my room. Peruvian children in the 1980s didn’t negotiate, they accepted their roles in the household, and as fathers go, mine was fairly strict. Keep your elbows away from the dinner table, don’t ever talk back to your mother and always, always go to bed when I say so. The law never changed and my dad would never budge, never show flexibility. I had to meet the rules and that was that.\n\nExcept when football was on.\n\nThe man who implemented those rules was the same person who introduced me to the beautiful game, and more importantly, what it meant to be a Peru fan. He helped me understand the complexity of what it means to root for La Blanquirroja. Understand that this is not the same as being a Brazilian, or an Argentinian, or dare I say it, a Chilean. We don’t hold the luxury of success, or at least the confidence of knowing that at least we’ll be there to compete. For Peruvians, the only assurance that we have in life is that we make the best ceviche in the world and that we won’t qualify for the World Cup. We are not even Cinderella – at least she made it to the ball.\n\nWill there be a time when we can rejoice again? Will there be moment in history where we can say, “We were there, we were there. We didn’t just witness it, we lived it.” We as Peruvians, can only hope and dream. One thing is for sure: if it happens, we will have to blink twice, because you’re going to need to shake us from our accustomed mediocrity.\n\n*****\n\nThere was a better time, of course. The year was 1970. As the world was witnessing the wonders of Pele, Jairzinho and Brazil at the World Cup in Mexico, another South American country was making headlines. Peru, with the help of our national treasure, Teofilo “Nene” Cubillas, were playing mesmerizing football and wins over Bulgaria and Morocco confirmed our place in the knockout stages.\n\nNobody saw it coming.\n\nThe curtain call came in the quarter-final round when we met the eventual champions, Brazil. The Brazilians won 4-2 in a historic game soaked with style and sweat. To this day, many Peruvians believe that had it not been for Pele and company, Peru would have been World Champions. One can dream.\n\nThe year is now 2015 and Peruvian football is vastly different – a shadow of its past. The last time the nation made it to the World Cup was 1982 and our last win away from home in a qualifier was nearly 11 years ago. Peru finished seventh in the Conmebol qualifying rounds for the 2014 World Cup, with only four home wins to our name. But this time around – with a game against Brazil on Tuesday – things look promising. The Argentinian coach, Ricardo Gareca, has implemented a new sense of discipline amongst the squad and has allowed talented players such as Andre Carillo, Carlos Ascues and Christian Cueva to develop and express themselves whilst allowing veterans such as Jefferson Farfán and Paolo Guerrero to lead with maturity. Gareca’s message is simple: professionalism and talent can co-exist. This may seem simple to other nations but trust me, it’s a monumental problem in Peru (There’s actually a Wikipedia page called Peru national football team indiscipline scandals)\n\nThe results of Gareca’s philosophy were obvious this past summer at the Copa America in Chile. Peru finished the tournament in third place and were it not for Carlos Zambrano’s red card in the semi-final against the hosts, who knows what could have happened. La Copa was a perfect platform to address Gareca’s No1 priority: playing well away from home. The fact that the tournament was hosted by Peru’s biggest nemesis was an extra dose of motivation, as playing in a hostile environment is an issue for Peru. We are kings of the choke, the South American Chicago Cubs. Imagine England taking penalties in any tournament ever: that’s Peru away from home.\n\n“As a Peruvian, rooting for the national team is like having a toxic ex-girlfriend,” says Mariano Bustamante, an industrial administrator in Lima. Mariano and I grew up together, attended the same school and spent every spare moment in our childhood playing soccer, exchanging stickers in our Panini albums and lamenting over our heroes on the pitch.\n\n“You know that every time you get back together, she’s going to deceive you, she’s going to cheat on you, but like a fool you forgive her, thinking that she will change. But she never changes, she just disappoints you, over and over again. But she’ll return in four years, and again, like a fool you’ll take her back.”\n\nMariano’s analogy speaks highly of how we deal with our problems. When faced with tragedy, Peruvians don’t simply fall into despair and cry in a corner longing to be rescued, turning our sorrows into a telenovela. Well, actually, we do do that but we also make them into a comedy: Our foundations are built on Inca Kola and the fact that we are not going to the World Cup in Russia.\n\nOr am I wrong?\n\nLosing to Colombia in the first qualifier was not a surprise as some of the players struggled to deal with the Baranquilla heat. Nonetheless, the performance was a positive one as Gareca’s men deployed an attractive style, unfazed by José Pékerman’s star players. The following match against Chile was a disaster albeit an entertaining one. Peru – after losing Cueva in the 23rd minute for throwing the ball at Valdivia’s face – had to once again play against their bitter rivals with 10 men. The match ended in a thrilling, yet disappointing 4-3 loss and again we have to wonder what would have happened if Cueva didn’t lose his head?\n\n“We have to respect the process,” says David Leon Bardi, the editor and general director of El DT Que Llevo Dentro, a soccer magazine based in Lima. “Gareca, is trying to give the team something we haven’t had in more than 15 years: character. With the help of new leaders in the federation such as Juan Carlos Oblitas and Edwin Oviedo, he is pressing the restart button. Gareca’s Peru is a team that fights until the end and that is something we haven’t seen since 1998. Win or lose, we are at least showing that we can compete.”\n\nLast week’s win against Paraguay was as much a necessity as it was expected but Tuesday’s match against Brazil will be Peru’s biggest test yet. Most Peruvians will tell you they know the scoreline already, and are understand the consequences of failure. But then there is that minute fragment of hope. Is it hope? Or is it a toxic ex who just won’t stop texting.\n\nEither way, I’m texting back.\n\n*****\n\nMy dad’s favorite player was Cubillas and he educated me on how a kid from Puente Piedra inspired a nation. “The world calls him the Peruvian Pele,” he would tell me. “But to us, Pele is the Brazilian Cubillas.” On the drive to school we would quiz each other with ridiculous stats and trivia. My father passed away in 2009 and never got a chance to meet his idol but I don’t think he was ever meant to. Memories are perhaps more significant when you are able to pass it on to your loved ones, so they can go on and live them for you when you’re gone. I think that’s why we love this game so much, because it’s a testament of loyalty not just to your team but to the people you love.\n\nThis year, on the last Saturday of September, I met my dad’s hero, Teofilo “El Nene” Cubillas. I asked him about Peru’s chances of making it to Russia 2018. He offered optimism about the squad, liked what Gareca was doing and stressed the importance of querer y poder (where there’s a will, there’s a way.) He talked about winning Copa America in 1975, and how Peru can rejoice once again as long as we have hope. Cubillas is a deep thinker with a poetic rhythm to his voice. It was a day I will never forget. At the end of the day we hugged and as we were about to leave he grabbed my hand and said, “Adios, campeon” (goodbye, champ).\n\nAs a Peru fan, my dad would have loved Cubillas’s optimism. As my father, dad would have loved Cubillas’s farewell."
