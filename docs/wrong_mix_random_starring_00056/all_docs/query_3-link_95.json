        "text": "Today, we're taking you to Quincy, Massachusetts.\n\nIn the last several decades, the number of people in Quincy who identify as Asian has grown considerably. The latest census shows nearly 30% of the city's residents identify as Asian.\n\nPart of this growth can be attributed to the city remaining an affordable, but accessible, alternative to Boston.\n\nMeanwhile, Boston's Chinatown has seen a decrease in its Asian population, as housing prices have increased significantly in the neighborhood.\n\nTo illustrate this change, The Common producer Frannie Monahan spoke with Joyce Chan, a former high school teacher and musician, about her personal experience starting a Chinese bakery in Quincy after her band lost its practice space in Chinatown."
