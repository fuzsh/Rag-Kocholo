Along with these ends, it is\n\nconstantly sought to cultivate true womanliness, a womanli-\n\nness which combines strength with gentleness and refinement.\n\nIt is thus the aim of the College to send out educated Chris-\n\ntian women to be a power in blessing the world and glorify-\n\ning God.\n\nThe College was founded by Presbyterians, and hence its\n\nmoral standards and religious life conform as nearly as\n\npossible to those which obtain in that church. Special care,\n\nhowever, is taken not to interfere in any way with the re-\n\nligious views or church preferences of students.\n\nThe College offers only the B.A. degree. There are,\n\nhowever, optional courses leading to this degree, thus giving\n\nthe opportunity for each student to elect a course most in\n\naccord vdth her special talent and plans.\n\nAdmission of Students 13\n\nADMISSION OF STUDENTS\n\nAll correspondence in reference to admission of students\n\nshould be addressed to the President of the College.\n\nOnly graduates of four-year preparatory schools of recog-\n\nnized standing, or applicants who can offer equivalent prepa-\n\nration, will be received into the College. (For the admission\n\nof special students, see page 20.)\n\nliToTE Beginning with the fall semester of 1921, only those\n\napplicants who can present fifteen complete units, in subjects\n\naccepted by this College, will be recommended for admission.\n\n(See page 23 for changes in admission requirements to go\n\ninto effect in 1921).\n\nApplicants for admission should not be under sixteen years\n\nof age. Candidates for advanced standing should be of an\n\nage corresponding to this rule.\n\nTestimonials of good character from responsible persons\n\nare required. Certificates of honorable dismission from the\n\nlast school attended must be presented.\n\nA deposit of $10.00 is necessary for the reservation of\n\nspace, which amount will be credited on bill rendered at the\n\nbeginning of the session. This fee will be refunded, provided\n\nthe President is notified of change of plan before August 1st.\n\nApplication blanks will be furnished when requested.\n\nFor entrance requirements and for description of entrance\n\nsubjects, see below.\n\nFor admission by certificate, see page 21.\n\nFor entrance examinations, see pages 21, 22.\n\n14\n\nAgnes Scott College\n\n?::^^ ENTRANCE SUBJECTS ^^J^r^., 7\n\nThe following subjects are accepted for entrance:\n\nEnglish 3 units\n\nMathematica 3 or 4 units\n\nLatin 3 or 4 units\n\nHistory 1, 2 or 3 units\n\nFrench 2 or 3 units\n\nGnnan 2 or 3 units\n\nGreek 2 or 3 units\n\nSpanish 2 or 3 units\n\nPhysics 1 unit\n\nChemistry 1 imit\n\nBiology :\n\nBotany % or 1 unit\n\nZoology % or 1 unit\n\nPhysiology ^^ or 1 unit\n\nPhysiography % or 1 unit\n\nBible 1 unit\n\nfMusic 1 unit\n\nA unit represents a year's study in a standard secondary\n\nschool, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's\n\nwork.\n\nIt is understood that in choosing the elective units no re-\n\nquired unit may be counted also as an elective unit, and also\n\nthat elective units may be counted only once.\n\nThe fourth unit in Latin and the unit in addition to the\n\nrequired 3 units in Mathematics will be accepted for en-\n\ntrance only by examination, when the student does not con-\n\ntinue these subjects in College.\n\nThe entrance requirement work in French, German, Greek,\n\nand Spanish may be done in College after entrance, but will\n\nnot count toward the degree.\n\n*See Note 2 on page 39.\n\ntSee Note 1 on page 39.\n\ni\n\nAdmission of Students 15\n\nSTANDING TO WHICH STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED\n\nThe College admits students: (I) as unconditioned Eresh-\n\nmen; (II) as conditioned Freshmen; (III) as irregular stu-\n\ndents; (IV) to advanced standing; (V) as special students.\n\nI.

As Conditioned Freshmen. Prior to the session begin-\n\nning September, 1921, applicants desiring to enter for the\n\nB.A, degree, who can not offer at entrance the full fifteen\n\nunits required for unconditioned admission, may be admitted\n\nas conditioned Freshmen, if they present a minimum of thir-\n\nteen unconditioned units. The remaining units necessary\n\nto complete the required fifteen may be assumed as conditions,\n\nwith the following restrictions :\n\n1. The deficiency in no single subject (except in the case\n\nof a modern language or Greek) shall amount to more than\n\na year of preparatory work.\n\n2. Unconditioned work to the following extent must be\n\noffered :\n\n(a) English to the extent of two and one-half units.\n\n(b) Mathematics to the extent of two units.\n\n(c) Latin to the extent of two units, if the minor re-\n\nquirement be chosen ; or,\n\n(d) Latin to the extent of three units, if the major re-\n\nquirement be chosen.\n\n3. Fifteen complete units, including the prescribed units,\n\nmust be presented before the beginning of the second year.\n\nConditions (except in the case of a modern language or\n\nGreek) must be removed at the student's expense and with-\n\nout faculty instruction.\n\nIII. As Irregular Students. Applicants who desire to\n\ntake a partial course, without becoming candidates for the\n\ndegree, may be admitted to the College as irregular students\n\nwithout class standing. Prior to the session beginning Sep-\n\ntember, 1921, such students may present a minimum of thir-\n\n18 Agkes Scott College\n\nteen units upon entrance. Of this number five are prescribed\n\nnamely, English 3 and Mathematics 2. The remaining eight\n\nunits are elective and may be chosen from the list of sub-\n\njects accepted for entrance (pages 14, 16). Fifteen complete\n\nunits must be presented before the beginning of the second\n\nyear.\n\nThese students are required to take a minimum of fifteen\n\nhours of recitation a week, which may include Music and Art,\n\nbut at least nine hours must be academic work.\n\nShould they later desire to arrange their courses for the\n\ndegree, credit will be given them for work already done in the\n\nCollege, but they must meet all of the entrance requirements\n\nof degree . students.\n\nrV. To Advanced Standing. A candidate may be ad-\n\nmitted to any of the higher classes on the following con-\n\nditions :\n\n1. She must present:\n\na. An honorable dismissal from the college she has at-\n\ntended.\n\nb. An oflBcial statement of entrance requirements and how\n\nabsolved.\n\nc. An official statement of studies pursued for credit.\n\nd. A catalogue of the institution with her completed\n\ncourses marked.\n\ne. An application for advanced credit properly filled out\n\nupon a blank provided by Agnes Scott College for this pur-\n\npose.\n\nNote. If the above certificates are not entirely satisfac-\n\ntory, a detailed statement of individual professors will be\n\nrequired.\n\nAdmission of Students 19\n\n2. She must satisfy the entrance requirements of this\n\nCollege. If necessary, credits presented for advanced stand-\n\ning may be used to satisfy any deficit in the entrance re-\n\nquirements.\n\nIf as few as ten units have been presented for entrance\n\ninto the college from which the candidate comes, no credit\n\nwill be given towards the degree for courses that may remain\n\nafter deduction for entrance deficiency, except upon exami-\n\nnation.\n\n3. When she comes from a college belonging to the Asso-\n\nciation of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern\n\nStates, or to an association of at least equal standing, she will\n\nbe given tentative credit course by course, in so far as the\n\ncourses are, in the opinion of the heads of the departments\n\nconcerned, equivalent to courses offered in this College. An\n\nexamination on the work offered for advanced standing may\n\nbe required at any time, if the student's work should prove\n\nunsatisfactory.\n\n4. If she comes from a college of liberal arts which offers\n\nthe B.A. degree, but which is not a member of any one of\n\nthe associations referred to above, she may possibly, upon the\n\nrecommendation of the Committee on Advanced Standing in\n\nconsultation with the heads of the departments concerned,\n\nbe admitted to courses which continue the work of the courses\n\noffered for advanced standing. Upon the satisfactory com-\n\npletion of these courses she may be given such credit for the\n\npreliminary work as the heads of the departments involved\n\nmay deem just, full credit being given only in exceptional\n\ncases. No credit, except by examination, will be given for\n\nsubjects not continued in this College, nor will the degree\n\nbe conferred upon such an applicant until she has completed\n\nat least thirty year-hours of work in this College.\n\n20 Agnes Scott College\n\n5. If she comes from an institution not included in any\n\none of the above classes, she will be required to take examina-\n\ntions for any advanced credit she may desire.\n\n6. 'No credit will be allowed for courses taken by corre-\n\nspondence, except upon advanced standing examinations given\n\nby this College.\n\n7. The B.A. degree will not be conferred on any student\n\nwho has not done at least fifteen hours of work in residence\n\nfor one complete session immediately preceding graduation.\n\nNote: A candidate for advanced standing may expect\n\nsome unavoidable loss of credit in transferring from another\n\ncollege.\n\nV. As Special Students. In accordance with the regu-\n\nlation prescribed by \"The Association of Colleges and\n\nSecondary Schools of the Southern States/' candidates of\n\nmaturity, who are unable, for any cause, to present the en-\n\ntrance requirements, may be admitted to such courses as they\n\nmay be prepared to take, provided these courses are not among\n\nthose covered by the entrance requirements. This provision\n\nis intended to afford an opportunity to two classes of women :\n\n(1) Those who have completed their entrance requirements\n\nso long since as to render them void; (2) Those whose pre-\n\nparatory work has been interrupted in the past and never\n\nresumed. The following limitations should be observed:\n\n1. Applicants must be not less than twenty years of age\n\nat the time of application.\n\n2. They may not matriculate in any courses covered by\n\nthe entrance requirements without first satisfying the require-\n\nments in those subjects.\n\nAdmission\" op Students 21\n\n3. They have no class standing. If they desire later to\n\ntransfer to the regular degree course, they must first satisfy\n\nthe full entrance requirements.\n\n4. If they have completed the entrance requirements in\n\naccredited schools not more than two years previously, they\n\nwill be expected to submit the certificates of such schools,\n\nand enter as \"regular,\" or as \"irregular\" students, and not\n\nas \"special\" students.\n\nMANNER OF ADMISSION\n\nAdmission hy Certificate. In lieu of entrance examina-\n\ntions, the College will accept certificates from any high school,\n\nfitting school, or seminary on the accredited list of the Asso-\n\nciation of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern\n\nStates, or from any school accredited by other college asso-\n\nciations of equal standing, in so far as such certificates show\n\nthe entrance requirements to have been duly satisfied not\n\nmore than two years prior to the candidate's application for\n\nadmission. Certificates should be on forms provided by\n\nthe College. These forms will be furnished on application.\n\nThe certificate privilege is granted to schools only and not\n\nto private instructors.\n\nAdmission by Examination.

They\n\nthen meet with the appropriate Committees for classifica-\n\ntion.\n\nNote If, for any cause, a student fails to register in time\n\nto attend her first scheduled lecture, either at the beginning\n\nof a semester or on returning from a vacation, she is charged\n\na fee of $5.00 for late registration.\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nStudents are expected to make themselves thoroughly fa-\n\nmiliar with the plan of the curriculum and to arrange their\n\ncourses so as to conform with its demands. By so doing\n\nthey will greatly reduce the necessarily arduous work of the\n\nCommittees.\n\nFirst year students present their cards to the Committee\n\non Admission, and their courses are selected with the advice\n\nof thia Committee. On or before April fifteenth, all stu-\n\ndents at that time in residence are required to file with the\n\nRegistrar tentative statements of their courses for the next\n\nensuing year. These programmes are reviewed by the Com-\n\nmittee on Electives and approved or revised. The cards,\n\nwith the courses entered upon them in due form, are obtained\n\nfrom the Registrar in the fall, presented to the professors of\n\nthe subjects, and, when they have been properly signed, re-\n\nturned to the Registrar's ofiBce.\n\nCurriculum 41\n\nAfter a course has been agreed upon by the student, with\n\nthe advice of the Committee on Admission or the Committee\n\non Electives, no change will be permitted, unless the question\n\nof the student's health be involved. All students must be\n\ndefinitely classified within two weeks after their arrival at\n\nthe College.\n\nATTENDANCE ON LECTURES\n\nStudents are required to attend their lectures regularly and\n\npromptly. Absence from courses without due excuse results\n\ninevitably in the lowering of the student's standing. Pro-\n\nfessors are authorized to require students to make up work\n\nby taking written tests covering the periods lost through ab-\n\nsence, whether the absence be excused or unexcused.\n\nEXAMINATIONS\n\n1. General examinations are held twice a year, in Jan-\n\nuary and in May. Failure to attend any of these examina-\n\ntions, for any cause other than sickness, results in the drop-\n\nping of the delinquent from the student body. In case of\n\nabsence from examination because of sickness, the student\n\nwill be given an opportunity to take the examination in\n\nquestion at the regular time set for re-examinations. (See\n\nbelow.)\n\n2. Examinations for advanced standing upon work done\n\nin some other institution, or in the summer, must be taken\n\nat such time as may be arranged for by the professors whose\n\ndepartments are concerned, provided that such examinations\n\nmay not be given later than December fifteenth for the first\n\nsemester's work, nor later than April fifteenth for the sec-\n\nond semester's work. These examinations for advanced\n\nstanding are more extended than ordinary examinations, be-\n\n42 Agnes Scott College\n\ning in no case less than five liours in duration. In the case\n\nof failure on an examination for advanced standing, no re-\n\nexamination is permitted.\n\n3. Ee-examinations are allowed in case of conditional fail-\n\nure. These examinations for the first semester's work are\n\ngiven in the second week of the second semester, and for the\n\nsecond semester's work in the first week of the fall semes-\n\nter next following. Those failing in the re-examination will\n\nbe required to repeat the course in question or forfeit the\n\ncredit. In no case will more than one re-examination be al-\n\nlowed in the same subject.\n\nIn case of unconditional failure in a subject, no re-ex-\n\namination will be allowed.\n\n4. If for any cause students find it advisable to apply\n\nfor examinations at any other time than that announced in\n\nthe regular schedule, or arranged for by the professors in-\n\nvolved, such applicants must present the Eegistrar's re-\n\nceipt for five dollars ($5.00) for each examination desired,\n\nbefore the professors are authorized to give the same. Such\n\nexaminations are known as \"Special\" examinations.\n\nThis regulation applies to re-examinations as well as to\n\ngeneral and advanced examinations.\n\nSEMESTER AND YEAR CREDITS\n\nA semester credit is the value in half hours of any course\n\npursued through one semester. Thus, if a course scheduled\n\nfor three hours a week for one semester be taken, the re-\n\nsulting credit towards the sixty-two hours required for the\n\ndegree is one hour and a half. A year credit is the value\n\nin hours of a course pursued throughout the year. Thus, a\n\ncourse scheduled for three hours a week for the whole year\n\nwill give a credit of three hours towards the degree.\n\nCurriculum 43\n\nMERIT POINTS\n\nGrades indicating the student's standing in any course\n\nare officially recorded as follows: \"A/' excellent attainment;\n\n\"B,\" very good attainment; \"C\" good attainment; \"D,''\n\npassable attainment; \"E/' failure, with privilege of re-exam-\n\nination; \"F/' unconditional failure. The grades \"A/' \"B,\"\n\nand \"C,\" are known as \"merit\" grades, each of these letters\n\ndenoting a certain number of \"merit points.\" In order to\n\nattain the Bachelor of Arts degree, a student must be cred-\n\nited with at least thirty of these merit points, not fewer than\n\nsix of which must be made in her senior year. On the re-\n\nmaining hours of the course a grade of at least \"D\" must\n\nbe made.\n\nExact grades are not announced to students, their reports\n\ncontaining only the information, \"Passed with merit,\"\n\n\"Passed,\" or \"Failed.\"\n\nREQUIRED RESIDENCE\n\nThe degree will not be conferred upon any student who\n\nhas not done at least one full session of work in residence.\n\nAUTOMATIC EXCLUSION\n\nAny student whose work is notably unsatisfactory at the\n\nend of the first semester is considered to have excluded herself\n\nautomatically from the College, unless by vote of the faculty\n\nshe be put on probation for the remainder of the year. If at\n\nthe end of the year she shall have failed to make credits to\n\nthe extent of at least two year courses, amounting to not less\n\nthan five hours towards the degree, she shall be considered to\n\nhave excluded herself automatically from the College for the\n\nnext ensuing year.\n\nNote. In addition to the enforcement of the above law,\n\nthe College reserves the right to request the withdrawal of\n\n44\n\nAgnes Scott College\n\nstudents who can not remain in residence without danger\n\nto their own health or to the health of others, or whose pres-\n\nence is found to lower the moral tone of the College. Stu-\n\ndents of this last class may be asked to withdraw, even though\n\nno specific charges be made against them.\n\nTHE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE\n\nTHE GROUP SYSTEM\n\nA fundamental principle of the arrangement of the courses\n\nfor the B.A. degree is that of the group system, which comes\n\ninto operation in the choice of elective courses. By requiring\n\na certain amount of work to be elected from each of the three\n\ngroups, the College assures to its B.A. graduates proper\n\nbreadth of culture; and by requiring a major subject, to-\n\ngether with allied subjects, to be chosen from one of the\n\ngroups, it gives to the student also the intensive training\n\nnecessary for the best mental development.\n\nThe groups are as follows :\n\nGROUP\n\nI\n\nGROUP II\n\nGROUP III\n\nLanguage\n\nHistory\n\nScience\n\nIjITEBATXJEE\n\nPhilosophy\n\nMathematics\n\nEnglish\n\nSociology and\n\nAstronomy\n\nLatin\n\nEconomics\n\nBiology\n\nGreek\n\nHistory\n\nChemistry\n\nGerman\n\nPhilosophy\n\nMathematics\n\nFrench\n\nEducation\n\nPhysics\n\nSpanish\n\nBible\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE\n\nCandidates for the B.A. degree must present sixty-two\n\nhours of work, of which two hours' value must be made in\n\nCurriculum 45\n\nphysical education. Of the remaining sixty hours thirty and\n\none-half are prescribed and twenty-nine and one-half elec-\n\ntive. All courses are planned and electives chosen with the\n\nadvice of the Committee on Admission or the Committee on\n\nElectives. Since the design of the curriculum is to reserve\n\nelective courses for the more mature years of the student,\n\nthe Committees will allow postponement of the work pre-\n\nscribed for the Freshman and Sophomore years only in such\n\ncases as may for special reasons demand this procedure. (See\n\nSection (10) page 47.)\n\n*1. The prescribed hours are as follows :\n\nEnglish 6 hours\n\nA Modern Language, or Greek 6 hours\n\nMathematics 3 hours\n\nTwo of the three sciences, Biology, Chem-\n\nistry, or Physics 6 hours\n\nHistory 3 hours\n\nBible SV2 hours\n\nPhilosophy 3 hours\n\n30% hours\n\n2. The elective hours are to be distributed as follows:\n\n(a) A major subject of not less than nine hours must\n\nbe chosen, together with six hours from the same group in\n\naddition to the major and the prescribed courses falling in\n\nthis group. The choice of the major subject must be settled\n\nby the beginning of the Junior year.\n\nMajor courses are offered in the following subjects:\n\nEnglish, French, German, Latin, History, Biology, Chemistry,\n\n*One hour semester courses in Hygiene and Spoken English are\n\nrequired of all Freshmen and Sophomores respectively.\n\nThe Spoken English is not counted towards the degree. For\n\nHygiene, see page 97.\n\n46 Agnes Scott College\n\nPhysics, Mathematics, Philosophy, Sociology, and English\n\nBible.\n\nNote. The following may not be elected to satisfy group\n\nrequirements as to the major or the allied hours :\n\n(1) Elementary courses (with the exception of the first\n\nyear course in a third science).\n\n(2) Courses in Music, Art History, and Spoken English.\n\n(b) The remaining hours necessary to complete the re-\n\nquired sixty-two hours may be chosen at will, subject to\n\nthe following restrictions :\n\n(1) Not more than six hours may be taken in any one\n\ndepartment in any given semester.\n\n(2) Students offering for entrance two languages in ad-\n\ndition to Latin must continue one of these two languages in\n\nthe Freshman year. Those offering for entrance Latin and\n\none other language must continue that other language in\n\nthe Freshman year. This rule comes into operation in the\n\nchoice of the group of studies to be taken in the Freshman\n\nyear.\n\n(3) Students offering for entrance four units of Latin\n\nand no additional foreign language must take in the Fresh-\n\nman year the elementary course in French, German, Spanish,\n\nor Greek. This elementary course will be counted toward the\n\ndegree only on condition that it be followed in Greek by\n\nCourse 1 or Course 4, in the other languages by Course 1.\n\n(4) Students offering four units in Latin for entrance,\n\neven from accredited schools, who do not wish to continue\n\nLatin in College, are required to pass an examination cover-\n\nCurriculum 47\n\ning both the Latin read in the last preparatory year and the\n\nentrance requirement in Latin prose composition,\n\n(5) Students oilering for entrance one unit in a third lan-\n\nguage must continue this third language in College, or take\n\nan examination on the work offered.\n\n(6) One year of a foreign language may be counted in\n\nmaking up the requirements for the degree only when that\n\nlanguage is the fourth foreign language that the student has\n\ntaken.\n\n(7) If a third language is taken in College for entrance\n\ncredit, it must be continued through Course 1.\n\n(8) Students who do not offer at least one of the\n\nthree sciences, biology, chemistry, or physics, for entrance,\n\nmust take one of these subjects in the Freshman year and\n\nanother of the three later. Those offering one or more of\n\nthese sciences for entrance, may elect history instead of\n\nscience in the Freshman year, taking one of the sciences in\n\nher Sophomore year and the other in the Junior or Senior\n\nyear.\n\n(9) Students electing Group D (see pages 49, 50), but\n\nwho do not major in science or mathematics, are required to\n\ntake, in addition to the science and mathematics prescribed\n\nfor all students, an advanced course of three hours in the\n\nthird of the three sciences, biology, chemistry, physics, or\n\nthree additional hours in mathematics.\n\n(10) Subjects prescribed for the Freshman or the Soph-\n\nomore year may not be postponed later than the Junior year,\n\nand then only upon the advice of the Committee on Admis-\n\nsion, in the case of first year students, or the Committee on\n\nElectives, in the case of advanced students.\n\n48 Agnes Scott College\n\n3. In order to receive the two hours of credit required\n\nin physical education, the student must have completed\n\nthree years of work in this department. Special arrange-\n\nments will be made for those entering with advanced stand-\n\ning.\n\n4. For the requirements as to \"merit points\" and resi-\n\ndence see page 43.\n\nOUTLINE OF COURSES\n\nThe following outline indicates the courses that are offered\n\nto each class.
