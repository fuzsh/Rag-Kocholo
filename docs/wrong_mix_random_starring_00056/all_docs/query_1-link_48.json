Specifically, we will examine the cultural threads of distinct identities that have been woven together throughout history to visibly influence the design of contemporary Spanish society. Far from viewing peninsular culture as a seamless, cohesive entity, we will consider the conflicts between dominant and marginalized groups such as men/women, Castilians/non-Castilians, and Christians/Jews/Arabs as crucial forces in the shaping of Spanish identity. Our analyses in this course will question to what extent the concept of Spanishness has been shaped as a reaction against a foreign other, whether that \"other\" dwells outside or inside the borders of Spain itself.\n\nCourse Rotation: NYC: Fall Odd Years\n\nThis course will prepare the student for an intensive 9-day cultural excursion to Argentina and Chile.

We will take into account the many facts that determine the filmic representations of the Spanish-speaking societies of the last third of the 20th and the 21st centuries. Such factors include class, race, gender, culture, aesthetics and ideology. We will therefore study different strategies adopted by Spanish-language film directors in order to articulate their perceptions of the social realities in which they are immersed. This course will also introduce Web 2.0 (blogs, wikis, podcast, rss feed, Second Life discussion groups, etc) tools and students will join discussion about culture through Spanish-speaking blogs. The course will be based around a collaborative wiki project to be determined by consensus where students will incorporate their own podcasts as well as comment personal and group projects on specific scenes, directors, films, topics and countries."
