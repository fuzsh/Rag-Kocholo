        "text": "The prestigious US real estate capital company CBRE has published its global investor survey, the 2024 European Investor Intentions Survey, where for the first time, the industrial and logistics (I&L) sector in Spain is ranked as one of the favourite real estate sectors of European investors.\n\nThe report shows that the logistics market in Spain has strong foundations and continues to be of great interest for investment. In CBRE’s survey, no less than two thirds of respondents chose the I&L segment as their investment preference and believe that occupancy demand will remain the same or increase in 2024, with Madrid and Barcelona being the cities, in that order, that will absorb the most square metres, with more than 70%, followed by Valencia and Zaragoza.\n\nWithin the logistics and industrial building sector, investors are increasingly focusing on sustainability certifications. In fact, according to CBRE, although there’s still some way to go in terms of sustainability, the Spanish logistics sector currently has more than 10 million square metres of certified warehouses, 30% of the total stock, a figure that has quadrupled in the last 3 years.\n\nThis shows that, for developers, it will be increasingly difficult to close contracts with investors that do not meet these ESG criteria.\n\nThis data further positions Magna General Contractors as a benchmark construction company in the I&L sector in Spain and Portugal, enjoying the trust of the major developers in the field, and contributing to the development of industrial and logistics building projects with sustainability certifications to meet the high demand expected for 2024."
