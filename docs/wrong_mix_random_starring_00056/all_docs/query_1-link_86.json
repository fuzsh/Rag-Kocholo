        "text": "Hereje is Arcángel’s new album. Following several projects marked by the curiosity of looking for new channels of expression through a dialogue with other musical genres, the artist embarked on an adventure that took him to explore paths very different from the ones he had previously taken. A project in which singers such as Juanes, Vanesa Martín, Andrés Calamaro, Vetusta Morla, Rozalén and Leiva, amongst others, have had the courtesy to join him and put all their efforts and affection at the service of art, with no recompense other than that of listening to their creations through another “voice”. Thus, Arcangél’s path flows with such different waters as pop, rock and indie, passing through jazz and electronic music.\n\nArcángel (Huelva, 1977) has been a benchmark of flamenco almost from the beginning of his career as a professional singer. Composer and revitalizer of the genre, as well as singer of substance, he has received the recognition of critics and the public, along with awards such as those of the Flamenco Biennial of Seville, the Gold Medal of Andalusia inn 2017 and the Gold Medal of the Province of Huelva in 2018. In the course of his international career he has performed at renown theatres and festivals, such as Carnegie Hall (New York), Teatro Real and Auditorio Nacional de Música (Madrid), Gulbenkian Foundation (Lisbon), the Flamenco Biennials of Rome and the Netherlands, and the French festivals of reference of Aix-en-Provence, Mont-de-Marsan and Les Suds en Arlés."
