        "text": "paula + jamal’s day was one of my favorites by far. their laid back attitude combined with their excitment to be getting married was the perfect combination for a wedding day. their ceremony at St. Peter’s Catholic Church and reception at The Westin Grand completed their timeless day- everything from the detailed marble interior of the church to the soft candlit reception held afterwards made everything absolutely perfect.\n\nwhen i look back at these images i smile and can only hope that every couple gets to experience their wedding day as fully as they did.i wish there were more words to describe how much i loved these two, this family, their details, and really just the entire day. but there aren’t so i will let the pictures tell the story :)\n\nas always, a big hug and thank you to kelsey thompson for asking me to second shoot this wedding. after going through these images i am so glad i did!\n\nfirst…lets begin with some sisterly love <3\n\n“going to the chapel and we’re…..”\n\nseriously you cannot possibly be this cute! favorite! look how handsome the groom is! paula = classic beauty\n\npaula held it together pretty well throughout the entire day…but i had to post this shot that was taken during her sister’s toast. couldn’t get through the day with at least a few tears ;-)"
