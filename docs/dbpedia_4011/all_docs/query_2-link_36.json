        "text": "Julian Jamaal Jones merges a range of mediums to express his perspectives around Black identity. His works bridge drawing, sculpture, and textile to memorialize Black culture. In addition, he communicates through the historical language of African American quilting by implementing abstract forms and vibrant colors to open a conversation around his Black experience.\n\nJones earned his Bachelor Degree of Fine Arts in Photography (2020) from the Herron School of Art + Design in Indianapolis, IN. He is a recent graduate from Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, MI with his Master of Fine Arts in Photography (2022) and received the prestigious Museum Purchase Award from Cranbrook Art Museum.\n\nHow would you describe your artistic style and what inspires your work?\n\nI would personally describe my artistic style as \"a breath of fresh air\". I'm intentionally creating quilts that don't fit the traditional quilt standard. With the inspiration behind the Black church, Hip-Hop culture, jazz music and the Gee's Bend Quilters my work surrounds my experiences as a Black male in white spaces.\n\nWhat message or emotion do you hope to convey through your art?\n\nMy mission as a Black abstractionist is to leave my mark and make your work rememberable. Not create work that others have created but recreate the vivid images that come from my imagination. My work has evolved due to trusting my intuitions and not questioning myself.\n\nI want my audience to take elements of beauty, confidence and an appreciation of color theory.\n\nCan you talk about a specific piece or series that holds a special significance to you?\n\nI like all the work I've created. The piece that holds a special significance to me is my MFA Graduate Degree Exhibition quilt. My piece was selected for purchase by the Cranbrook Art Museum committee and accessioned into the permanent collection of Cranbrook Art Museum.\n\nWhat does this work aim to touch on?\n\nMy Black identity.\n\nWhat is your process for creating a new piece of art?\n\nMy process is a two-step process. Starting with my abstract sketches that are created around my daily moods, reactions, Hip-Hop, Jazz, and Bible verses. Once the sketches are finished, I curate the sketches that will be printed on a variety of fabrics that will be later implemented in my quilts.\n\nHow do you stay motivated and inspired in your artistic practice?\n\nI know my worth and I understand my art practice is rare by reconstructing the verbiage around the traditional quilt. My works speaks my truth and one day my works will receive the proper validation from the art world.\n\nHow do you see your work fitting within the larger context of contemporary art?\n\nI see my work fitting in the larger context due to the subject matter, artistic style and the quilt demand among fiber collectors.\n\nWhat advice do you have for aspiring artists who are just starting out in their careers?\n\nMy biggest advice is to never give up and don't let other artists success interfere with your art journey. Every artist has their own path, just stick to it and believe in yourself.\n\nThank you, and anything else you would like to add?\n\nI would like to publicly acknowledge other Black artists that influence my art practice by uplifting the importance of the Black voice. Thank you……\n\nQualeasha Wood, Paul Verdell, Akea Brionne, Morgan Bouldes, Samuel Levi Jones, Nick Cave, Jammie Holmes, Carole Harris, Michael Cummings, Bisa Butler, Eric Mack, Stanley Whitney, Cydney Camp, Olivia Guterson, Charles McGee, Diedrick Brackens, Sanford Biggers, Darryl DeAngelo Terrell, Davariz Broaden, Mario Moore, Allie McGhee, and Sam Gilliam."
