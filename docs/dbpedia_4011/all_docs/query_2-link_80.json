        "text": "Bicoastal production company Valiant Pictures welcomes director Justice Jamal Jones (she/he/they). Justice’s dynamic and transformative approach to filmmaking, coupled with their wealth of experience in film direction, music videos and branded content, lends a shining facet to Valiant Pictures’ creative vision and mission to uplift untold stories and unique perspectives from diverse production talent.\n\nJustice’s cinematic journey commenced with “How To Raise A Black Boy” a fairytale dedicated to Black boyhood. The film was programmed and awarded worldwide and set Justice apart as an emerging filmmaker. In 2021 they were a Sundance Ignite Fellow and entered the commercial sphere with the heartwarming \"My Black Alchemy,\" a commercial short that captivated audiences during Black History Month on MTV and Viacom platforms. This transformative film secured a gold medal at the Promax North American Awards as part of MTV’s “See Me, Hear Me, Know Me” campaign, laying the foundation for Justice's exceptional career.\n\nClick HERE to view their work.\n\nNoted Valiant Pictures executive producer Matthew D’Amato, “Now having worked with Justice on several amazing projects, we are proud to continue collaborating with them across film, music, and branded content. With the upcoming Crossroads Blues, Vince and I are both incredibly excited to see what the next year brings.”\n\nAdded Justice, “Home is difficult for me to conceptualise. I was born in Omaha, Nebraska and after eighteen years of my life l moved to NYC for school, so home has always been distant. As a director, I’d create a home on set and then in days it would disappear once production was wrapped. Now at Valiant Pictures, the security and safety of being oneself at home is constant. As a part of the team, Valiant has created space for artists to breathe as both commercial and narrative directors. They understand how the narrative can feed the commercial, and vice versa. I am thankful to be supported in a space that values all aspects of me, and I am proud to call Valiant my home.”\n\nFrom award-winning debuts to recent groundbreaking projects like \"Notes on a Siren,\" a powerful exploration blending Black trans and non-binary identity with Vodou spirituality, Justice's work defies convention, fosters global collaboration, and reshapes narratives. Their passion for historical fiction infused with magic reflects a commitment to breaking boundaries, making Justice not only a creative force but also a beacon of change. Advocating for representation, visibility, and justice in the arts, Justice Jamal Jones is set to make an indelible mark on the filmmaking landscape.\n\nBeyond their transformative projects, Justice has contributed their directorial talents as a freelance director for iconic brands such as Calvin Klein and MTV. In addition to their directorial achievements, Justice has also contributed as an author of \"A Pill For Promiscuity,\" published by Rutgers University Press. They are currently at work on the upcoming film “Crossroads Blues”, shooting this summer."
