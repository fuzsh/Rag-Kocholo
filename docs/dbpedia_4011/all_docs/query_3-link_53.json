        "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe first week was a little bumpy for us.‚Äù\n\nIt is the countdown to the preseason at this point for the Jaguars. It is the third week of training camp practice and the Jags have that opening game of the preseason on Saturday night against the Chiefs. That will be the moment that many of the players on the Jaguars see ‚Äúall your childhood dreams come true instantly,‚Äù said Christian Kirk as he thought back to his first preseason game.\n\nFor a guy like Kirk, the preseason games don‚Äôt mean a ton at this point in his career. But for some of the young players fighting for roster spots and playing time preseason games are everything. His biggest tip for them is to be in the moment, and ‚Äúif you mess up mess up fast.‚Äù\n\nThat same statement could be applied to the Jags offense in its start to training camp. Early in camp, they messed up but those mistakes were fast and seem like a distant memory now.\n\n‚ÄúI thought once the pads came on we‚Äôve really taking advantage of that,‚Äù Kirk said.\n\nThat is as true of a statement as can be said. The Jaguars offense flipped the switch once they put the pads back on. That defense has had its moments but the offense has looked much better in pads. That seems like a strange qualifier but if that means the Jags offense plays better when the game is physical, I like it.\n\nTrevor Lawrence, Christian Kirk, Evan Engram, Travis Etienne are names that have been on the Jags offense for a few years now but things will still look a little different this year.\n\n‚ÄúFrom basics and a foundational standpoint, we are doing a lot more,‚Äù Kirk said.\n\nMore could be good. Christian explained that they are moving guys around a little more than before.\n\nüìì Notebook üìì"
