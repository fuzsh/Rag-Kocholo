        "text": "D.C. police confirmed Tuesday that the District has surpassed 200 homicides so far in 2023.\n\nIt comes amid a rise in crime that continued this week when a 16-year-old boy was fatally shot in the , a woman was fatally shot and when an was placed on lockdown after bullets hit the building.\n\nOn Monday night the body of 40-year-old Tangia Tates-Little was found in the roadway of an apartment complex.\n\nTwo young women in the neighborhood called for change, one detailing her experience living in a neighborhood where homicides are out of control.\n\n“It’s unacceptable, but what can we do as a 21-year-old,” the neighbor said.\n\nMORE |\n\n“If it's people out here that’s ready to take people’s lives, nobody wants to try no more, it’s like everybody just gave up,” she continued. “All of us who are victims, all of us who are bystanders, all of us who care about our lives, all that we feel our option is is to duck and cover and it should not be like that...That lady should not have lost her life last night.”\n\nParents at an elementary school hit by bullets Monday decried the violence.\n\n“It’s ridiculous and sad they don’t care about the kids’ safety at all,” said Stanton Elementary parent Shaconya Bey.\n\n“These babies, they’re here to get education and they can't even really be protected,” said parent Shannon Gregory. “But it’s crazy around here.”\n\nOn Tuesday, police identified the 16-year-old Jamal Jones as the teen killed in an Anacostia neighborhood Monday.\n\nThe ANC Commission in the neighborhood is outraged by the continued violence, saying city officials need to bring police from other areas.\n\n“Southeast Ward 8 and Ward 7 is out of control and the mayor should be ashamed of herself,” said ANC Commissioner Paul Trantham. “She shouldn’t be able to sleep at night with the stuff going on in our city.”\n\nThe District surpassed 200 homicides Tuesday evening when a man died after being caught in the crossfire of a and a teen was .\n\nThe grim milestone marks the first time since 2002 to 2004 that the District had over 200 homicides for three years in a row, according to the D.C. Police Union.\n\nMORE |\n\nIn 2022, the milestone was not reached until December 29th, Police Union officials said in a statement.\n\nThe D.C. Police Union shared the following statement:\n\n“On September 26, 2023, Washington, D.C. suffered its 200th homicide of the year. This marks the first time since 2002-2004 that D.C. has suffered three years in a row with 200-plus homicides. Last year, this grim milestone was not reached until December 29th. Data reported by the Metropolitan Police Department shows that homicides have increased 31% over the past year. Armed robberies have increased 65%, and carjackings have gone up 103%. Violent crime overall is up 37%, and all crime is up 28%. Noteworthy, too, is that the annual homicide rate was less than 90 in 2012; 104 and 105 in 2013 and ’14 respectively.\n\nChanges thereafter to policing policies, enforcement of laws and other public safety measures all proven to reduce crime and save lives coincide with the doubling of the homicide rate. Some neighborhoods are suffering greatly from this violence.\n\nIn Ward 6, for example, homicides have increased 280% over the prior year. Armed robberies in Ward 6 are up 95%, and carjackings up 57%. Year to date, there have been over 720 carjackings in D.C., well more than two per day.\n\nThere is no one politician more responsible for all this violence than Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen, who has been the champion of some of the most anti-police and pro-criminal legislation anywhere in the country. Allen has turned a blind eye to concerned residents and public safety experts, rather he chooses to cater to an activist crowd whose agenda is anti-police whatever the cost. The consequences of Allen’s “reform” measures were not properly considered by the Council and have resulted in a tragic loss of life and a horrific increase in the number of victims experiencing violent crime.\n\nSince the passage of so-called “emergency police reform” legislation in June of 2020, over 1,300 police officers have separated from MPD. Most of the members who have left cited the Council’s treatment of law enforcement and political rhetoric, which not only makes policing more difficult and therefore less effective, but it also endangers police officers and their families.\n\nMPD staffing is at one of the lowest levels in decades. The Police Union remains dedicated to working with the DC Council and other elected officials to find positive ways in which we can achieve meaningful police reform while also keeping communities safe from violent crime. We hope these years of tragic, but largely avoidable loss of life does not go unnoticed.\n\nIt is well past time for the Council to repeal “reform” policies that do nothing to improve public safety, as many leaders in other cities have already done. We have seen what three-plus years of these “reform” measures have done to public safety. Allen’s “justice reform” experiment is an abject failure and people are dying as a result.\""
