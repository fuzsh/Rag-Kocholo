        "text": "Seneca Jamal Williams Jones, 15, was born in Boston on Aug. 20, 2007 to Shanequa Hendricks and Seneca Williams. At the age of 5, Seneca was adopted by his great grandmother Theora L. Jones. Due to the illness of Senecaâ€™s great grandmother, Brian and Nichole Jones (great uncle and aunt) became his guardians.\n\nSeneca enjoyed playing with the family dog Moria, going to the latest Sonic movies and eating the spiciest of foods with his Big Brother Kurt. Seneca would spend hours playing video games with his cousins and friends. Seneca had dreams of becoming an architect. Seneca attended elementary school at Paul A. Dever, middle school at John W. McCormack and Wareham High School for the 9th grade. Seneca passed away peacefully surrounded by family on Nov. 5, 2022.\n\nSeneca leaves behind his great grandmothers Theora L. Jones and Flora Williams, father Seneca Williams, grandmother Theora J. Jones, grandfather Kevin Williams and his wife Diane, siblings Auniya, Malachi, Kingston, Kamauri and Neriyah, great aunts Rosezina, Veronica, Esther, Rochelle, Deanna and Deborah, great uncles Willie, Brian and wife Nichole, Christopher and Lee, aunts Kachiri and Lakisha and uncles Tyson, Ramon and wife Jen, Juan, Sequonie, Julio and Tawan, and his dear cousin Dee along with a loving extended family.\n\nServices will be held Friday, Nov. 18, at Twelfth Baptist Church, 160 Warren Ave., Roxbury, MA 02118. Visiting hour 10 a.m., services begin at 11 a.m."
