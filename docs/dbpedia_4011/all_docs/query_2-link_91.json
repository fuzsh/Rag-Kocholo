        "text": "Hip-hop artist Jamal Jones is probably a familiar presence to anyone who's spent time at the monthly Art Walk in downtown Jacksonville.\n\nHe's been bringing rhythm and rhyme to the streets surrounding Hemming Park for more than five years.\n\nAnd though Jones, 39, is an accomplished performer, his shows aren't all about him and his skills at improvisational rap - hip-hop fans know it as freestyle - and he never intended them to be.\n\nAs host of \"The Lyricist Live,\" he makes sure the presentation is largely devoted to ciphers, informal jams where rappers just come out and take turns freestyling.\n\nJones has no fixed location for his four-hour events at Art Walk. \"I move around,\" he said, but he typically sets up outside a business he's formed a good relationship with.\n\nFrom the outset, he feels a tangible energy from the audience, eager for that mic to be turned on.\n\n\"I've got a bunch of hungry rappers following me, waiting for the show to start,\" Jones said.\n\nThe ready-to-rap crowd knows the No. 1 rule that their host has enforced from the get-go: no cursing.\n\nBreak the rule, and the microphone gets cut off. Lose the mic and you lose the ability to express yourself and be creative, Jones said. You lose your power. Nobody wants that.\n\nJones sets guidelines because he believes in hip-hop's potential to make a positive impact. Its messages don't have to be negative. And it can be an effective tool for literacy and education.\n\nWhen kids can't curse, they come up with better words. Freestyling \"teaches them to think faster, to sharpen their vocabulary, to sharpen their mind,\" he said.\n\nJones has worked steadily to boost recognition for hip-hop's value in the Jacksonville community. Recently, he received an important validation of his efforts from the state of Florida.\n\nHe was named one of five folk artists to serve as masters in the 2015-16 Florida Folklife Apprenticeship Program. Over a six-month period that starts in January, Jones will help an apprentice further develop his skills in improvisational rap.\n\nEssentially, he'll be encouraging the development of a tradition strongly associated with African-American culture.\n\nJones understands that for some people, linking \"hip-hop\" to \"folk art\" can seem questionable.\n\n\"Yeah, you'd never think they'd be in the same radius,\" he said. \"But I always knew what it was.\n\n\"This is a traditional form of expression, and it engages people. All of my shows take place out on the street. Peers can get together, without instruments, without music, and create.\"\n\nCHALLENGING PERCEPTIONS\n\nBlaine Waide had no problem understanding the connection.\n\nWaide was state folklorist for the Florida Folklife Program when he met Jones in early 2013.\n\n\"Each year, we do a survey where we go out into communities in Florida and identify and document traditional artists in the state,\" said Waide, who is programming manager for the National Council for the Traditional Arts in Silver Spring, Md.\n\nEach survey has a theme, he said, and \"that year it was artists in the lower St. Johns River area.\n\n\"Going into that year, I want to do something that brought in young people and also challenged what people thought about traditional folk life culture,\" he said. \"When I found out there was vibrant, thriving, hip-hop community here, that sounded like something I wanted to do.\"\n\nWaide eventually contacted Jones, who also introduced him to other hip-hop artists in Jacksonville for the survey.\n\n\"I had a long conversation with him, and he was extraordinarily enthusiastic,\" Waide said.\n\nThe survey led to two \"firsts\" for Jones in 2013. He became the first hip-hop artist in Florida to be archived by the Florida Folklife Program under the Department of State's Division of Historical Resources.\n\nAnd he became the first hip-hop artist to perform at the Florida Folklife Festival at the Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center in White Springs. A longtime collaborator, DJ Paten Locke, performed with him.\n\n\"They were great,\" Waide said, \"and accomplished exactly what I wanted to accomplish. It was an extraordinarily important step toward attracting a younger audience, and to make people think differently about traditional folk artistry.\"\n\nIn their presentations at the festival, Jones and Locke \"spoke very directly\" to the question about hip-hop's place at a folk festival, Waide said.\n\n\"They said, 'We're traditional poets,' \" he said. \"They were very aware of the whole idea of improvisatory rhyme and thinking quickly and how it's very tied to a culture.\"\n\nWaide said he believed audiences got the message because Jones and Locke \"represented so well.\"\n\nHe applauds Jones' determination to tap into hip-hop's positive potential.\n\n\"While it's accurate to say the general public doesn't think of [hip-hop] that way, there are all kinds of ways it can be used in positive ways.\"\n\nA CHILD OF EARLY\n\nHIP-HOP\n\nThe New York-born Jones was right there when hip-hop was getting started.\n\nAn older brother handed out fliers for the \"park jams\" and block parties organized by DJ Kool Herc in the Bronx in the 1970s. Herc (the stage name for Clive Campbell), has been called the \"founding father of hip-hop.\"\n\nJones remembers going to the jams well before the age of 10.\n\nHe was drawn to \"the break dancing, the words, the clothes,\" he said. Hip-hop was \"like the gospel. It was cool to everybody. It was unique to everybody. And I was there at the time.\"\n\nHerc saw hip-hop as a way to help eliminate gang violence, Jones said. Rappers could do battle, and sometimes resolve their differences, with words.\n\nJones was introduced to the power of the spoken word even before than that. His father, John Jones, a jazz musician, would take him to various clubs and have him recite poetry when he was 5. John Jones also participated in street-corner performance poetry, an oral tradition that also influenced hip-hop.\n\n\"That was my introduction to the literary part,\" Jones said.\n\nHis dad died before Jones turned 6, and he eventually moved to South Florida with his mother and twin sister. Jones was 16 when they moved to Jacksonville.\n\nAs his interest in hip-hop grew, \"I wanted it to have a purpose, the way Kool Herc did,\" Jones said. Thus, the positive messages.\n\n\"It's about stopping the violence by making it fun, making it challenging, and connecting with the kids through the music they listen to,\" Jones said. \"It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nThere are \"battles\" on occasion, where, during the cipher, rappers will \"diss\" each other with lyrics and word play.\n\n\"Instead of settling their differences by fighting,\" Jones said, \"they settle their differences with a microphone. Just like Kool Herc.\"\n\nIn the nearly 70 shows at Art Walk, \"there has not been one incident,\" he said.\n\nJones frequently brings his son, Jabari, 12, to \"The Lyricist Live.\" He even performs with his dad.\n\n\"He does a beatbox with his mouth, and I rap over it,\" Jones said.\n\nThe rule against cursing is \"not a restriction, it's an enhancement,\" he said. \"It makes the music more acceptable because you are not limiting your audience. It's not about stopping your expression. It's about being creative.\"\n\nEvery \"Lyricist Live\" is videotaped. Last year, Jones got a Spark Grant from The Cultural Council of Greater Jacksonville to help him document the city's hip-hop culture. The grant funding has ended, but Jones continues to do it on his own.\n\nThe crowd at Art Walk tends to be teenagers and young adults, but Jones said he's seen girls as young as 6 and men older than 60 attempt freestyle. He pulled up a video on his smartphone of a Jacksonville police officer freestyling.\n\nJones has introduced a literacy-through-hip-hop program at the Center of Achievement, a Jacksonville nonprofit, and teaches hip-hop history and rhyme dynamics to students at The Performers Academy. Earlier this year he made a JEA educational video about electrical safety using hip-hop rhyme and a class of third-graders at S.P. Livingston Elementary School.\n\nWith a more mature audience in mind, Jones recently started hosting weekly Freestyle Fridays from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. at Azucena Corner Deli in downtown Jacksonville.\n\nBeing a hip-hop advocate and performer in Jacksonville doesn't pay the bills. Jones has a full-time job at a glass container company.\n\nBut he's hopeful that opportunities such as the Florida Folklife Apprenticeship Program will help him to make it easier to find community support for hip-hop as positive force in young people's lives.\n\nThere are several core ideas behind the program, said Waide, who, in his position at the National Council for the Traditional Arts, wrote a letter of recommendation for Jones as a master artist.\n\nOne is to encourage public recognition for traditional culture, he said. Another is to support a relationship, or encourage one \"that would not otherwise occur,\" to help a cultural tradition to be passed on.\n\n\"You're also providing something tangible from someone in a position of authority,\" Waide said, \"and instilling that sense that the Department of State is telling me that what I'm doing is important.\"\n\nDavid Crumpler: (904) 359-4164"
