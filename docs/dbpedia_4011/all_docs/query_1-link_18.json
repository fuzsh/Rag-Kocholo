        "text": "What was your first professionally directed work and when was it?\n\nThe first professional project I directed was a commercial short film for MTV and Viacom entitled “My Black Alchemy.” The film aired on MTV and Viacom platforms during February for Black History Month. The film won Gold at the Promax North American Awards as a part of MTV’s “See Me, Hear Me, Know Me” campaign.\n\nHow did you get into directing?\n\nI fell into directing after a failed attempt at acting school. I still love acting, but at the time I become bored and unsatisfied with playing underdeveloped Black Queer side characters. This led me to create my work where I didn’t have to contain my imagination and fit into a predetermined box. The shift was natural and freeing.\n\nWhat is your most recent project?\n\nMy most recent project is Notes on a Siren, an autoethnographic essay film that positions Black Trans and Non-binary identity alongside the Black Diasporic spirituality of Vodou (Voodoo). The film follows my artistic process as a resident artist at Palm Heights Hotel as I slowly become enamored with the “siren in the water,” unearthing a spiritual history of my Black Queer lineage.\n\nWhat is the best part of being a director?\n\nThe best part of being a director is the collaborative process. I feel so honored and blessed to have the chance to build a community with so many talented individuals all over the world. I think that art is just a byproduct of the magical bonds we all create as collaborators.\n\nWhat is the worst part of being a director?\n\nOn the flip side, the most difficult part of being a director is the mental and physical stamina and fortitude needed to execute a vision. Every time I direct I feel like I am a professional athlete. I know that for me to be my best for my crew and cast, I have to take daily steps to make sure I am taken care of and be disciplined in how I exert my energy.\n\nWhat is your current career focus: commercials and branded content, television, movies? Do you plan to specialize in a particular genre–comedy, drama, visual effects, etc.?\n\nI enjoy commercials, television, and film in different ways. As a career path, I would like to oscillate between the three.\n\nIn regards to genre, within film I have found that I am drawn to historical fiction with a magical and theatrical flare. Black Queer stories have been obscured in the timeline, overdubbed with false narratives. Through historical fiction, one can make time plastic, reshooting, and replacing scenes in history.\n\nHave you a mentor and if so, who is that person (or persons) and what has been the lesson learned from that mentoring which resonates with you?\n\nI am so grateful for the many mentors in my life. My mentors range from Alchemist Brian Cortnoir and Vodou Priestess Sallie Ann Glassman to film producers like Matthew D’Amato, and many more. These mentors have given me space to fail, and have encouraged me to try again.\n\nWho is your favorite director and why?\n\nMy favorite director at the moment is Peter Greenaway. The theatricality and boldness of his work give me a rush, and always inspires me. He is not afraid to ground the camera in one position and let the frame become a proscenium for movement, lighting, and dialogue.\n\nWhat is your favorite movie? Your favorite television/online program? Your favorite commercial or branded content?\n\nMy favorite movie is the 1978 movie-musical The Wiz. Although the film was not critically acclaimed, the film has survived as a cult classic in the Black community for decades. As a Black Queer child, the simple lessons in the film of believing in one’s self and making the world your home were integral in building my confidence in a world of witches and wizards who tried to stand in my way. I found, like Dorothy, that I had the magic in me all along.\n\nTell us about your background (i.e., where did you grow up? Past jobs?)\n\nI was born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska. As a child and teenager, I was very involved in theatre, which led me to attend NYU Tisch within their acting program.\n\nHave you had occasion to bring your storytelling/directorial talent to bear in the Metaverse, tapping into the potential of AR, VR, AI, NFTs and/or experiential fare? If so, tell us about that work and what lessons you have taken away from the experience?\n\nUnfortunately, I haven’t had the opportunity to take part in any of the above."
