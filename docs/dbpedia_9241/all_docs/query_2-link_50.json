        "text": "Tibetan banknotes were issued between 1912/13 and 1959. Owing to their artistic design, to their handwritten numbers and intricate seal imprints they can be considered part of Tibetâ€™s culture heritage. This book explores the historical background which led to their issue, the way in which they were produced and their artistic design.\n\nThe two last chapters of the book are dedicated to paper notes which were issued in an English Tibetan monastery and to banknotes with both Chinese and Tibetan inscriptions which were put into circulation by Chinese authorities in the former province of Sikang which comprised parts of Eastern Tibet and Western Sichuan. Ten appendices provide further information for the specialist and an extensive bibliography concludes the book."
