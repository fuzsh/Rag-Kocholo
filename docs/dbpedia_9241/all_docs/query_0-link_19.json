        "text": "Despite the influence of commodity exchange within Tibetan society, its historical processes are rarely to be found in “event history.” Commerce and Communities: Social and Political Status and the Exchange of Goods presents a collection of studies on various historically documented modes of exchanging goods in Tibetan societies, their evolution over time, and their impact on the status of the actors involved, be they individuals, social groups or political entities. The contributions to this volume explore the theme of exchange not only from the perspectives of trade, monetary value, and economy; it also takes into consideration the religious, administrative, diplomatic and political aspects that are intertwined in the exchange of gifts and in trade activities. These perspectives are combined in their attempt to fill certain lacunae in the economic history of Tibetan societies, as well as furthering our knowledge of Tibetan social history during the period of the Ganden Phodrang government (1642–1959). The volume covers not only a broad spectrum of perspectives on the exchange of goods, but also a wide range of Tibetan societies: the geographical scope of this volume extends from the Central Tibetan area to the eastern Tibetan-Chinese borderlands and the former Himalayan kingdom of Nepal.\n\nDissertation Abstract: This study entitled The Monastery Rules: Buddhist Monastic Organization in Pre-modern Tibet discusses the position of the monasteries in Tibetan societies before the 1950s and how that position was formed and informed by Buddhist and monastic notions. This research takes as a point of departure the huge impact of monastic Buddhism on society, economy and law, as well as on a wide range of aspects of Tibetan culture and (popular) religion. Whereas Christian monasticism is only of secondary importance to its faith, Buddhist monasticism is generally seen as primary to Buddhism. Its importance is brought to the fore both in Buddhist doctrine and practice. That Buddhist monastic institutions then not only held their position as a religious ‘driving force’ but also became organizations that dealt with more than religion alone, does therefore not come as a surprise, for, in countries where Buddhism was adopted as the dominant religion, monasteries came to be major players in politics, economics, culture, and society as a whole. This work examines the impact of Buddhist monastic institutions on Tibetan societies by looking at their monastic policies with regard to organization, economy, justice, and public relations. The primary sources in which these policies can be found are the monastic guidelines (bca’ yig). The earliest extant texts in this genre stem from the 12th century, whereas the lion’s share of the works available were written in the 17th and 18th centuries. As this type of literature has not been studied in any detail, this study contains an exploration of this genre, its parallels in other Buddhist cultures, its connection to the Vinaya (regularly translated as ‘Buddhist monastic law’), and its socio-historical value. The in-depth study of these texts is supplemented with important information from over twenty interviews, using oral history methods, with elderly Tibetan monks and monks currently involved in monastic organization, collected during fieldwork in India in 2012. By combining methods of history, anthropology, and philology, this study demonstrates that the monastic institution was, in many aspects, guided by Buddhist monastic law and that it was averse to instability and upheaval of the existing social system. The main reason for the strong adherence to the status quo was the obligation monks were seen to hold: to ensure the continued existence of the Buddha’s Teachings. To this end, monks needed to behave well, also in order to be respected by the lay-community. This meant that monks, and thereby monasteries, continuously had to adapt their position to their environments and to change how they treated themselves and others. These changes are attested in the monastic guidelines, which contain rules that are largely aimed to change the monastery in order to preserve it. By this, I show that – contrary to ideas held by many scholars – the monastic institutions’ influence on society was maintained not merely due to existing power-relations, but also because of certain deep-rooted Buddhist beliefs.\n\nThe main title of the book “Play of the Omniscient” is a literal translation of the title in Choekey (thams cad mkhyen pa’i rol mo) and is typical of the flowery title of great masters’ biographies. The book is a reader-friendly English adaptation of the biography of the great Drukpa master Jamgön Ngawang Gyaltshen (1647-1732), whose main seat was Se’ula monastery above Punakha dzong. His biography was written in 1735 by his disciple Shakya Rinchen (1710 1759) before he became the 9th Je Khenpo in 1744. The life story of Jamgön is fascinating and, at times, tragic. It takes the reader from Bhutan to Derge in eastern Tibet and to Ladakh via Mount Kailash; from the religious pursuits of Jamgön to the arcane politics and bloody feuds of that time; from the subtleness of Himalayan politics to the incursions of Tibeto-Mongol troops. The biography is probably one of the most important historical works of Bhutan. It is an immersion into Bhutanese life and religious culture, which was then not separated from politics. It covers an encyclopaedic range of subjects: Drukpa lineages and transmissions, construction and restoration of temples, foreign relations as well as diseases, earthquake, drought, customs, and rituals. Besides the politico-religious history of Bhutan, the biography provides an insight on the socio-economic history, including what would be called today good governance. Jamgön Ngawang Gyaltshen, is depicted as a selfless, energetic, highly learned and respected master, much more inclined to religious and artistic pursuits than to mundane politics. The book has minor flaws, typos or inconsistencies, which are unavoidable in such a complex work. Two points are more annoying: There is no index of personal names and places, which would have been useful, given their great number, and the map of Jamgön ‘s trips is far from accurate. However, these comments can be considered as details. The clear layout and high quality printing of Kuensel press have to be noticed. The biography is put in historiographical and literary perspective by Prof. Sorensen’s excellent introduction. The scholarly notes provide information that extends the scope of the biography; the photos from Bhutan, Tibet and Ladakh lead the reader in the footsteps of Jamgön. This vivid adaptation of Jamgön’s fascinating life, as well as thorough research done by the three authors are to be commended, as well as Felicity Shaw’s painstaking editorial assistance, without forgetting the pioneering works of Dr John Ardussi on the subject. The book reads like a novel, while giving a deep Buddhist message and is also relevant to contemporary Bhutan. It provides an in-depth understanding of the Amorimu Choeje and the Jamgön reincarnations, among the most respected Drukpa lineages in Bhutan to this day. F. Pommaret\n\nThis dissertation examines the place of traditional songs in the Tibetan Buddhist culture of the former Himalayan kingdom of Ladakh. I look at how Buddhism and pre-Buddhist religion informed the texts and performance contexts of traditional songs, and how Ladakhi songs represent cultural self-images through associated musical, textual, and visual tropes. Many songs of the past, both from the old royal house and the rural Buddhist populations, reflect the socio-political structure of Ladakhi society. Some songs reflect a pan-Tibetan identity, connecting the former Namgyal dynasty to both the legendary King Gesar and Nyatri Tsangpo, the historical founder of the Tibetan Yarlung dynasty. Nevertheless, a distinct Ladakhi identity is consistently asserted. A number of songs contain texts that evoke a mandala or symbolic representation of the world according to Vajrayana Buddhist iconography, ritual and meditative visualization practices. These mandala descriptions depict the social order of the kingdom, descending from the heavens, to the Buddhist clergy, to the king and nobles, to the common folk. As the region has become more integrated into modern India, Ladakhi music has moved into modern media space, being variously portrayed through scholarly works, concerts, mass media, and the internet. An examination of contemporary representations of “tradition” and ethnic identity in traditional music shows how Ladakhis from various walks of life view the music and song texts, both as producers and consumers. Situated as it was on the caravan routes between India, Tibet, China, and Central Asia, Ladakhi culture developed distinctive hybrid characteristics, including in its musical styles. Analysis of the performance practices, musical structures, form, and textual content of songs clearly indicates a fusion of characteristics of Middle Eastern, Balti, Central Asian, and Tibetan origin. Looking at songs associated with the Namgyal dynasty court, I have found them to be part of a continuum of Tibetan high literary culture, combined with complex instrumental music practices. As such, I make the argument that these genres should be considered to be art music.\n\nThis article deals with an important festival in Tibet dedicated to the future Buddha Maitreya. It was held on three days in summer when three giant thangkas showing Buddhas Amitābha, Śākyamuni and Maitreya were put on public display. Introduced in the seventeenth century, it became a defining feature of the monastic life in the Dge lugs monastery of Bkra shis lhun po, the seat of the Panchen Lamas. It attained a supra-regional importance, which even extended to Mongolia. Based on a number of textual sources, this essay examines various aspects of this festival, how it was funded, who participated, and which rituals and ceremonies were conducted. It also analyses the history and iconography of the three giant textile thangkas by discussing in detail the contributions made during the reign of each respective Panchen Lama from the past to the present. In sum, the article argues that this festival has to be seen in the context of a special bond the Dge lugs school of Tibetan Buddhism maintained to have with the future Buddha Maitreya"
