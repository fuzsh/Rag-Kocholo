        "text": "Most fake bills are in denominations of 50 and 100 Yuan, and the following are important China travel tips on detecting them.\n\nThe first feature of genuine RMB is the watermark. Hold up the bill against light, you can see a watermark of Chairman Mao. Only a clear watermark means the bill is real.\n\nThe second difference between a real bank note and a fake one is the hair of Chairman Mao. Scratching the hair of Chairman Mao on the bank note, you can feel the hair on a real one while the hair cannot be felt on a fake one.\n\nThe third way is to see the security line on RMB, which is a line in the left side. Against the light, you can see “RMB 100” or “RMB 50” on the line in real bank note.\n\nWhat’s more, you can buy a machine to detect Chinese currency as well.\n\nThe Travelers' Checks in China\n\nYou must know that travelers’ checks are not popular in China. As travelers’ checks are inconvenient, particularly in smaller cities and local Chinese hotels, you should not depend on it too much. If you really need carry and exchange travelers’ checks, then using those issued by major financial organizations such as American Express and Visa is recommended.\n\nOn the other side, cash advance services are not commonly acceptable in China, neither. You should bring some U.S. dollars or Canadian dollar, not coins, but paper bills. What’s important to know is that any badly worn or defaced bills will not be accepted by local vendors.\n\nThe Credit Cards and ATMs in China\n\nMajor credit cards are only accepted at some hotels, tourist stores and upscale shops. For your convenience, you should phone your credit company and let them know that you are traveling in China to ensure your transactions during your trip will not be declined.\n\nNowadays, you can find ATMs in most cities in China. However, most ATMs only offer you withdrawing Chinese currency - RMB. With a Visa, Master card, American Express, Cirrus and Plus you can withdraw money from most ATMs. There is a limit on your daily withdrawal and the exchange rate is the same to credit cards."
