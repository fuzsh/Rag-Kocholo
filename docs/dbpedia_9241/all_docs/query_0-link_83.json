        "text": "Author: Wolfgang Bertsch\n\nPublisher: Library of Tibetan Works & Archives\n\nYear: 1997\n\nLanguage: English\n\nPages: 93\n\nISBN/UPC (if available): 8186470166\n\nDescription\n\nThis work explores both the content and design of the currency, and provides a thoroughly researched and comprehensive Bibliography of Tibetan currency representing a unique blend of printing skills and the artistic genius.\n\nPaper currency was only introduced into Tibet in the early 20th century, and yet Tibetan banknotes are arguably the most attractive among world currencies. The designs on the banknotes include both religious and national symbols, such as the snow lion and the lung rta ('wind horse'), and most are printed in vivid colors.\n\nThis currency represents a unique blend of printing skills and the artistic genius inspired by a long historical tradition of painting in Tibet. Those banknotes which survive are a testament to Tibet's independent status prior to 1959, and serve as a tangible reminder of Tibetan material culture.\n\nThe author of this numismatic study explores both the content and design of the currency, and provides a thoroughly researched and comprehensive Bibliography for those who wish to pursue the subject further.\n\nContents"
