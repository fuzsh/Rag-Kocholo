Tibetan banknotes have a rich history, and among the various denominations issued by the former Tibetan Kashag government, the Tibetan silver hundred-Srang banknotes stand out with their distinctive features. In this article, we will delve into the remarkable aspects of these banknotes, including their impressive face value, extensive circulation, long issuance duration, substantial ticket size, and exquisite colour-overprint patterns.

Tibetan Silver Hundred-Srang Banknotes: A Glimpse into the Past

The Tibetan silver hundred-Srang banknotes have left an indelible mark on the world of numismatics. These paper banknotes are prized collectibles, characterized by their historical significance and unique attributes. However, their exclusivity lies in the fact that they are inscribed in Tibetan characters, which limits the number of collectors who can interpret them. Despite the cessation of Tibetan silver circulation nearly four decades ago, remnants of these banknotes can still be uncovered in cultural relics and ancient coin shops in Beijing.

Printing and Issuance of Tibetan Banknotes

To appreciate the significance of Tibetan silver hundred-Srang banknotes, we must journey back to the early 20th century. In 1912, during the forty-sixth year of the fifteenth year of the Tibetan calendar, a local bank was established in Tibet, marking the inception of Tibetan banknotes. In 1913, five distinct denominations of single-colour banknotes were introduced, each with its unique characteristics.

Varieties of Tibetan Banknotes

Five Srang- Seven Cents and Five Cents: This denomination reflects a total value of Tibetan silver equal to seven cents and five cents.

Ten Srang – One Two or Five Coins: Here, the banknote represents the total hidden silver value, ranging from one to five coins.

Fifteen Srang – Two Taels and Two Cents and Five Cents: This banknote carries a total hidden silver value of two taels, two cents, and five cents.

Twenty-Five Srang – Three Taels, Seven Cents, and Five Cents: The denomination in this Szang represents a total silver value of three taels, seven cents, and five cents.

Fifty Srang: Seven Taels and Five Coins: The most substantial denomination, this banknote represents a total hidden silver value of seven taels and five coins.

Uniqueness of Tibetan Banknotes

Each of these banknotes had a single colour—blue, red, or khaki. While the paper size varied, the picture size remained constant at 145 mm in length and 85 mm in width. However, the single-colour design made them susceptible to counterfeiting, and counterfeit banknotes, often printed in India and Nepal, emerged frequently.

To combat counterfeiting, an organization known as “Yerba Yundan” was established, entrusted with the task of identifying counterfeit banknotes. Banknote numbers were filled in manually, and a rectangular mint black seal was stamped on the right side of the front of each banknote. Remarkably, this manual banknote numbering system persisted until 1959, when the banknotes were discontinued. It has since become a defining characteristic of Tibetan banknotes.

Unique Characteristics of Tibetan Banknotes

Tibetan banknotes are distinguished by two significant features. First, they lack the backing of abundant materials and do not adhere to a reserve system. This non-guaranteed nature sets them apart from conventional banknotes and adds to their historical value and intrigue.

In conclusion, Tibetan silver hundred-Srang banknotes are a fascinating piece of history, with their distinctive features, historical significance, and unique attributes. These banknotes continue to captivate collectors and enthusiasts worldwide, serving as a testament to the rich cultural heritage of Tibet.

In the early 20th century, the Tibetan local government embarked on a journey of modernization, especially in the field of currency and banknotes. Here, we will explore key developments in the printing and issuance of Tibetan banknotes from 1918 to 1959.

1918 – A Quest for Knowledge

In 1918, the Tibetan local government demonstrated its commitment to progress by sending Thubeng Kunphel and Dode to India for the purpose of studying modern printing techniques. This marked the first step towards embracing technological advancements in the world of banknote production.

1926 – Embracing Mechanical Printing

In 1926, the Tibetan local government transitioned to mechanical printing, powered by water, to produce coloured banknotes with a face value of fifty chapters. These banknotes featured a slightly larger size than their monochrome counterparts, measuring 160 mm in length and 100 mm in width. The designs on these banknotes incorporated four vibrant colours: yellow, black, red, and blue.

Notably, they bore the octagonal red seal of the Dalai Lama and the black seal of the bank (later known as the Tashi Mint). Despite the shift to mechanical printing, anti-counterfeiting measures, including manual number filling, were retained to safeguard the integrity of the currency.

1933 – Responding to Economic Challenges

By 1933, the excessive issuance and circulation of single-colour and multi-colour banknotes of various denominations had led to inflation and economic instability. To mitigate the adverse effects, the Tibetan local government introduced a new series of banknotes. These included three taels of Tibetan silver one tael and five silver coins, which were issued from 1934 to 1946. The goal was to raise funds to redeem the older, devalued banknotes.

1937 – Advancements in Printing

In 1937, the Tibetan local government, under the approval of the Regent of Tibet, made further advancements in banknote printing. The Tibetan silver one hundred and two sets of coloured banknotes were produced using iron mould engraving machines. Power generation equipment had been installed at the Tashi Mint in 1928, facilitating more efficient production. These banknotes continued to feature the image of the Dalai Lama on the fifty-chapter notes, along with the red seal and a newly engraved rectangular seal of the Drabchi Mint. Manual numbering remained the norm until 1959.

1941 – Expanding the Range

In 1941, with the endorsement of Acting Regent Dazak, the printing of two sets of coloured banknotes with denominations of 10 taels and 5 taels of Tibetan silver commenced, broadening the range of available currency.

1945 – Investing in Gold

To secure resources for coinage needs, the Tibetan local government issued one hundred Srang of Tibetan silver banknotes in 1945, using the proceeds to purchase gold worth 17,500.94 tolas. This gold played a crucial role in the acquisition of raw materials for coin production.

1948 – Wrapping Up Old Banknotes

By 1948, the extensive work of recycling old single-colour banknotes was nearing completion, further streamlining the currency system.

1949 – Expanding the Palette

In 1949, with the approval of Regent Daza, the printing of coloured banknotes worth twenty-five taels of Tibetan silver commenced, offering a broader spectrum of options for currency users.

1959 – The End of an Era

Following the political changes and counterinsurgency reform in 1959, the Tibetan Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee issued an announcement on August 10. This announcement signalled the end of Tibetan currency’s circulation, stating that “machine-printed banknotes can be exchanged for 50 taels per RMB one yuan,” while one hundred and two sets of coloured banknotes could be exchanged for RMB 2 yuan.

In retrospect, the evolution of Tibetan banknotes reflects not only the economic changes within Tibet but also the region’s openness to embracing modern printing techniques and safeguarding the integrity of its currency. This journey through history showcases the importance of currency management in shaping the financial landscape of a nation.

The Craftsmanship of Tibetan Silver Hundred Liang Banknotes

Tibetan Silver Hundred Srang banknotes are a testament to the artistry and precision that went into their creation. These exquisite pieces of currency provide a glimpse into the materials, size, and intricate design that make them distinctive.

The Remarkable Paper

The paper used to produce Tibetan banknotes was crafted in Milin Jundong District, now known as Xirika Village, Jundong District, Lang County. What sets this paper apart is its unique composition, which includes wolfsbane root. This special paper is prized for its exceptional toughness, resistance to insect and rodent damage, and its ability to remain free of any markings – a crucial feature for distinguishing genuine notes from counterfeits.

The Dimensions and Materials

Let’s delve into the specific details of a Tibetan Silver Hundred Srang banknote. These banknotes are indeed a work of art. The front screen measures 180.8 mm in length and 117.5 mm in width, while the back screen dimensions are 179.6 mm in length and 118.9 mm in width. The overall paper size is 220.9 mm in length, with the uncut raw edge positioned on the right, and it is 140.0 mm in width. The paper boasts an average thickness of 0.17 mm and has a weight of 2.35 grams.

Front Design – A Visual Marvel

The front of the banknote is adorned with an intricate design. At the center, a horizontal pattern measuring 96.6 mm on the left and right, and 37.5 mm on the top and bottom, features a striking red image against a yellow background. This design showcases a pair of lion-faced beasts, also known as the Five-faced King. These mythical creatures exhibit lion claws and tails, with each holding a cornucopia in one of their front paws. They are surrounded by auspicious clouds, signifying good fortune.

The design is bordered by three layers: inner, middle, and outer. On the upper and lower sections of the inner frame, black Tibetan characters adorn white decorations. The upper part reads “Tibetan local government is invincible,” while the lower section states “The political and religious unity is one hundred taels of Tibetan silver.” Each of the four corners features Tibetan chronological values in black against a yellow background with red floral and grass decorations.

The inner frame’s left and right portions are embellished with flowers and clouds, housing the red circular Dalai Lama official seal on the left and the black mint rectangular Huerwen seal on the right. Eight auspicious symbols are symmetrically placed within the middle frame, with two on each side. The upper frame displays a victory banner and Pisces, while the lower frame showcases an auspicious knot and a conch.

On the left, you’ll find a prayer wheel and an umbrella, and on the right, a vase and a lotus. Handwritten banknote numbers are located at the left end of the upper frame and the right end of the lower frame. The outer frame features a red diamond grid pattern on a yellow background, with Tibetan letter patterns and swastika patterns within the diamond grid.

Back Design – A Tapestry of Symbolism

The back of the banknote is equally captivating. At its centre, a blue rectangle, 139.0 mm from top to bottom and 80.5 mm from side to side, sets the stage for a horizontal print enclosed by an inner floral border. Here, two saints, one elderly and one young, sit beneath the Bodhi tree. The elder holds a treasure pot in his right hand, nourishing the earth, while the young saint grasps a treasure bowl in each hand. The backdrop is adorned with a lying deer, a bountiful plate of food, and a treasure tripod.

A pair of cranes grace the left side, while the sea and islands adorn the right. Above the Bodhi tree, two bats fly in opposite directions, symbolizing longevity, peace, happiness, and contentment. Surrounding this centrepiece are three layers of zigzag borders. The inner frame features a red rhombus grid against a white background, filled with cross patterns. Each corner boasts a blue flower dragon with its head facing the centre.

In the left and right sections of the middle frame, green text on a white background proudly states, “The Tibetan local government is invincible.” The four corners and the upper and lower frames are adorned with green peonies, symbolizing wealth on a white background, and a green diamond grid, with four happy emblems in each grid. The outer frame is adorned similarly to the front of the banknote.

Anti-Counterfeiting Measures

Tibetan Silver Hundred Liang banknotes were equipped with anti-counterfeiting measures to ensure their authenticity. When held up to the light, you can observe two horizontal lines of code on the front of the banknote. The Chinese translation reads, “Tibetan local government is invincible.” This ingenious anti-counterfeiting method was a distinctive feature of some banknotes in Tibet, underscoring the craftsmanship and attention to detail that went into their creation.

In sum, Tibetan Silver Hundred Liang banknotes are not just a means of exchange; they are artistic masterpieces that tell a story of Tibet’s rich cultural heritage and craftsmanship. These banknotes, with their unique materials, size, and intricate design, are a testament to the dedication and artistry of those who crafted them.

Unveiling the History and Craftsmanship of Tibetan Silver Hundred Srang Banknotes

Tibetan Silver Hundred Srang banknotes offer a captivating window into both their historical significance and the meticulous craftsmanship involved in their production. While we lack direct data on edition numbers, we can glean valuable insights from historical documents and the design of the banknotes themselves.

Edition Numbers and Historical Context

The term “edition number” pertains to the number of sets of steel moulds used to print the front and back of one hundred taels of Tibetan silver banknotes. Although specific edition numbers are not documented, historical references provide some clues. In 1955, the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso recommended to the central government the cessation of the issuance and redemption of Tibetan banknotes.

Notably, it is mentioned that there were six machines capable of printing banknotes and other materials, suggesting that around six sets of steel, moulds were used for printing.

Quantities Printed

The quantities of Tibetan banknotes printed offer a fascinating glimpse into the monetary history of Tibet. After the liberation of Qamdo in 1950, the 14th Dalai Lama, along with the mint general managers Tsarong Dasang Damdul and Lungshar Thubten Lobsang, transported all the gold, silver, and warehouse materials from the Tashi Mint. This included both numbered and unnumbered banknotes.

Subsequently, to maintain the former Tibetan local government’s expenditure, it was decided to reprint one hundred taels of Tibetan silver banknotes in alphabetical order in 1954. These notes spanned from the 24th to the 78th letter, with each letter containing approximately 25,000 pieces. In total, this endeavour produced 1.36 million banknotes, equivalent to 136 million taels of silver.

The printing records, as documented in the handbook of Manual Handbook, filled in the banknote numbers, reveal the following annual quantities: 41,000 in 1939, and 8,000 in 1940. The circulation calculated on a two-year basis constituted approximately 80% of the total Tibetan banknotes.

Estimating the Year of Production

Dating Tibetan Silver Hundred Liang banknotes can be challenging due to the absence of specific dates. However, the Tibetan alphabet characters featured on these banknotes offer some clues. In your attached picture, the crown character “Hundred Liang Tibetan Silver” is the nineteenth letter of the Tibetan alphabet.

If 25,000 copies of each letter were printed, the nineteenth letter would correspond to a range between 450,000 and 475,000 copies. However, this estimation presents a puzzle, as the banknotes appear to be in remarkably good condition, inconsistent with those printed before 1945.

A more plausible explanation is that these banknotes belong to the 19th letter of the second round of Tibetan letters, reaching the 49th letter in total. This would place them between 1.2 million and 1.225 million copies. Based on this calculation, it is reasonable to conclude that these banknotes were printed in 1957.

Craftsmanship and Technology

The crafting of Tibetan Silver Hundred Liang banknotes represents a remarkable achievement considering the technology and local conditions of the time. Here are some observations about the craftsmanship:

Paper Quality: The paper used for these banknotes was sourced from Lang County and is characterized by its softness. It features small, irregularly distributed particles, which are larger in diameter than the paper’s average thickness. These particles create small local blanks that are more prevalent on the back than the front.

Alignment: Despite over ten colour overprints, there are slight misalignments on the banknotes, noticeable upon close examination. This can be attributed to the technology available at the time.

Size and Alignment: The actual size of the frame on the front and back is misaligned by 1 mm. This non-parallelism between the four sides of the frame and the corresponding edge of the banknote is not easily discerned by ordinary currency holders.

Edges: The right side of the front of the Tibetan Silver Hundred Liang banknotes has rough edges. Further study is needed to ascertain whether this is related to the authentication process.

Despite these imperfections, Tibetan Silver Hundred Srang banknotes remain among the finest examples of banknotes in the history of Tibet. Their combination of historical significance and unique craftsmanship continues to captivate collectors and enthusiasts, offering a glimpse into Tibet’s cultural heritage and monetary history. It is hoped that collectors, both at home and abroad, will share their collections with others to further our understanding of these remarkable artefacts.
