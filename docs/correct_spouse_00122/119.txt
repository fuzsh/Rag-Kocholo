NEW YORK (AP) _ Saying his personal life is off-limits, singer Marc Anthony refused to confirm Tuesday whether he's married to Jennifer Lopez.

During an appearance on NBC's ``Today'' show, co-host Matt Lauer asked the Latin singer how he'd spent his weekend.

``I see where you're going with this, and I'm going to preface it with just saying _ y'all know I don't talk about my personal life,'' Anthony said.

Lauer replied: ``So, I _ do I need to congratulate you?''

``Yeah, I have two albums coming out, man. Absolutely. And I would appreciate it,'' the 34-year-old singer said.

Anthony, who performed in Rockefeller Plaza, could be seen wearing what appeared to be a wedding band on his left hand.

When Lauer continued to ask whether a wedding had taken place Saturday at Lopez's home in Beverly Hills, Calif., Anthony responded, ``That would fall into the category of personal. And that's where I'm going to leave it.''

Lopez's representative didn't immediately return a call Monday, but told The Associated Press on Sunday that he had no comment.

This would be the third marriage for the 33-year-old Lopez _ the first was to waiter Ojani Noa in 1997, the second to Cris Judd in 2001. Noa lasted a little more than a year; Judd for nine months.

The singer-actress also was engaged to Ben Affleck, her ``Gigli'' co-star, but they canceled their plans in September 2003 amid a huge media frenzy and broke up in January.

Anthony divorced former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres last week in the Dominican Republic. They married in 2000 and have two young sons; Anthony also has a daughter from a previous relationship.

His new album, ``Amar Sin Mentiras,'' means ``To Love Without Lies'' in Spanish.
