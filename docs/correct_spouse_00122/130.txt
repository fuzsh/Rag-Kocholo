NEW YORK &#151; Saying his personal life is off-limits, singer Marc Anthony refused to confirm on Tuesday whether he\'s married to Jennifer Lopez.During an appearance on NBC TV\'s "Today" show, co-host Matt Lauer asked the Latin singer how he\'d spent his weekend."I see where you\'re going with this, and I\'m going to preface it with just saying &#151; y\'all know I don\'t talk about my personal life," Anthony said.Lauer replied: "So, I &#151; do I need to congratulate you?""Yeah, I have two albums coming out, man. Absolutely. And I would appreciate it," the 34-year-old singer said.Anthony, who performed in Rockefeller Plaza, could be seen wearing what appeared to be a wedding band on his left hand.Lopez\'s representative didn\'t immediately return a call Monday but told the Associated Press on Sunday that he had no comment.This would be the third marriage for the 33-year-old Lopez &#151; the first was to waiter Ojani Noa in 1997, the second to Cris Judd in 2001. Noa lasted a little more than a year; Judd for nine months.The singer-actress also was engaged to Ben Affleck, her Gigli co-star, but they canceled their plans in September 2003 amid a huge media frenzy and broke up in January.Anthony divorced former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres last week in the Dominican Republic. They married in 2000 and have two young sons; Anthony also has a daughter from a previous relationship.<h4>J.Lo wedding shock: Her exes react</h4><strong>Sean Combs</strong> says Jennifer Lopez is his "girl for life," even after her surprise weekend wedding to Marc Anthony.The hip-hop mogul, who had a high-profile, two-year relationship with Lopez, told "Access Hollywood," "If she\'s in love with somebody and that makes her happy, I\'m happy for her."But dancer <strong>Cris Judd</strong>, Lopez\'s second husband, said he was surprised to learn that she\'d married Anthony."She did?"
