        "text": "It’s been quite some years since Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce from Marc Anthony. A lot has happened since the two veteran entertainers decided to part ways.\n\nFrom mastering the dance of co-parenting to breaking the Internet with a seemingly impromptu kiss that broadcasted during last year’s Latin Grammy awards show, the ex couple seem to have found their groove again — inside the studio.\n\n“It actually kind of repaired certain parts of our relationship that had been fractured from our marriage and our divorce and it kind of made us friends again,” J. Lo says in an interview with Spotify about collaborating with Anthony on her upcoming Spanish-language album. “Like, because when we first started working together it’s how we met, we met working. And so we remembered that like, oh right, we connect on this level of music. And we have that. And that’s what the album came out of.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nShe even performed her own rendition of Anthony’s “Vivir Mi Vida” as a tribute to his mother.\n\n“I thought, ‘I think that’s a good song to sing right now.’ But, in a different way. Not in the kind of up-tempo, rhythmic, salsa way that Marc did it, but in a way where you really hear the words to that song, which is, you know, you have one life and you have to live it.”"
