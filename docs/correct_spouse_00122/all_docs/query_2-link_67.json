        "text": "Jennifer Lopez aka jenny from the block is a icon from the Bronx, New York whose career spans 20+ years. She has been successful in several industries including movies, music, clothing lines & her iconic perfumes. On the outside looking in it seems like Ms. Lopez has everything a girl coming from humble beginnings could only dream of. Lets not forget her unforgettable performance of Mexican-American singer Selena that really put her on the map to be a force to be reckoned with. She can sing, dance & act plus she's been a #girlboss way before the term was even created. She is the CEO of her multi million dollar empire there isn't a thing she touches that doesn't turn into gold. From Maid in Manhattan , The cult classic The Wedding Planner & lets not forget her unforgettable tunes that topped the charts including the 2001 duet “I’m real” with Queens rapper Ja Rule. The opening line of her hit song ironically stated “I met so many men,\n\nIts like they’re all the same.\n\nMy appetite for lovin’\n\nIs now my hunger pain” YIKES\n\nCould it be art imitating life where Jennifer has met & married so many men that their all the same? Or is she the reason her relationships or marriages could barely hang on. With all due respect her love life comes off as a train wreck 5 engagments,3 marriages 2 of which lasted only a year & a lot of relationships. Her longest marriage was with Marc Anthony which lasted roughly about 8 years & resulted in 2 beautiful twins. In a interview she admitted that she wasn't in the best place during the marriage & had to go through therapy and learn to love herself. As beautiful as she is & very accomplished she was dealing with self love issues I mean she is human after all. She has dated normal guys, athletes, actors, rappers & singers. White guys, black guys, Hispanic guys You NAME IT. She even tried the cougar thing with choreographer Casper smart who was 18 years her junior which I still think was a waste of time. He was 23 at the time & she was 42 with two kids with lots of experience career wise & with life. Anyone could see that it was a recipe for disaster. I don't want to come off as an ageist but she is about to be 52 that brings a whole new set of problems. Aging, menopause the reality of growing old you cant be young forever. Sometimes I wonder can she find the happy ever after or will she be serial dating hopping in out of relationships well into her golden years. Only time will tell but I want to see how her current fling with Ben Affleck will turn out."
