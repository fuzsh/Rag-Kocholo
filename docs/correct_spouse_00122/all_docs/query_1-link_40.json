        "text": "Yep, it’s really over. Marc Anthony and Shannon de Lima finally confirmed they’re getting a divorce after only two years of marriage.\n\n“After much consideration, we have mutually and amicably decided to end our two year marriage,” the couple said in the statement to Us Weekly. “We ask for privacy during this difficult process, and no further comments will be made from either one of us about this personal matter.”\n\nMore: Jennifer Lopez just can’t quit Marc Anthony\n\nSpeculation that the couple was divorcing started last month. An inside source told Us Weekly the pair was separated and headed for divorce back in November, saying, “It just was not working and they didn’t have enough in common.”\n\nNovember was also the same month Anthony and Jennifer Lopez shared a kiss onstage during their performance at the 17th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, leaving fans wondering if the formerly married pair could ever get back together.\n\nMore: Jennifer Lopez just used Marc Anthony to confirm she & Casper Smart are over\n\nAnd it sounds like they might. Another inside source told Us Weekly a reunion isn’t out of the question. The source said Anthony is still in love with his ex-wife of seven years and seriously wants to get back together with Lopez.\n\n“As soon as he heard Jennifer split with Casper [Smart], he wanted out [of his marriage],” the source reportedly told the magazine earlier this month.\n\nMore: Why is everyone so worried about Marc Anthony’s “young” wife?\n\nDuring Anthony and Lima’s two-year marriage, the pair was friendly with Lopez and the former couple’s 8-year-old twins Emme and Max. They even all posed for a family photo together after one of Anthony’s concerts back in August."
