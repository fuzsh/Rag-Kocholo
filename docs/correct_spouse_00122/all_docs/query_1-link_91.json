        "text": "Marc Anthony said he’ll “always love” Jennifer Lopez, but the Hollywood power couple had to call it quits because their 7-year marriage wasn’t “sustainable.”\n\nIn his first post-breakup interview since the couple split in July, Anthony told ABC’s “Nightline” that tabloid reports he cheated on Lopez were untrue.\n\n“I’ll tell you that it wasn’t something sensationalistic happening,” Anthony said of what caused the breakup. “It was a realization on both our parts. So you know it wasn’t shocking. These things happen. It was a decision that we made jointly.”\n\nLopez was the first to go public with her take on why the couple was getting divorced.\n\n“It’s not that I didn’t love myself before,” the thrice-married performer told Vanity Fair for its September cover story. But she said, “sometimes we don’t realize that we are compromising ourselves.”\n\nAnthony told “Nightline” not to think of their divorce as a “funeral.”\n\n“This is not a burial,” the Latin pop star said. “This is just two people who came together and just realized — and so I’m saying that it wasn’t sustainable the way it was, and that’s that.”\n\nU.S. & World\n\nHe reiterated, as Lopez has, that the ex-couple will stay in each other’s lives because they are parents to 3-year-old twins.\n\nHe also said they plan to continue working together on their Latin talent reality show “Q’Viva! The Chosen.”\n\nAnthony’s full interview with “Nightline” airs Thursday at 11:35 ET."
