        "text": "As far as friendly exes go, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony are as friendly as they come!\n\nThe former couple shocked fans last November when J.Lo planted a kiss on her ex-husband’s lips during their performance at the Latin Grammys and they were even considering reconciling their relationship — but she finally opened up about whether she’ll ever remarry the Latin crooner.\n\n“Oh, no! No, no, I think we’re really good the way we are,” the 47-year-old said during an appearance on Live With Kelly. “We’re always going to be great friends, I’m always going to be there for him, he’s always going to be there for me. We share something very special in the kids — and we’re there for them, and that’s the main thing.”\n\nMORE: Jennifer Lopez Spends Time With Alex Rodriguez’s Sister as Their Relationship Heats Up!\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2004 and were married for seven years before they split in 2011, just three years after welcoming nine-year-old twins Max and Emme. Their divorce was finalized in 2014 and even though Jen has moved on with other relationships since then, she is still committed to keeping a healthy co-parenting relationship with Marc.\n\nShe even went as far to say that she’s “best friends” with him, and she revealed that even though there’s no chance at rekindling their romantic relationship, they have rekindled their working relationship.\n\nMORE: Jennifer Lopez Throws Shade at Ex-Fiancé Ben Affleck’s Bedroom Skills!\n\n“We’re making an album right now, actually he’s helping me make my Spanish album,” Jen shared. “The kids get to spend time with the two of us more together and see us working together and it’s good for them, it’s just good for the whole family.”"
