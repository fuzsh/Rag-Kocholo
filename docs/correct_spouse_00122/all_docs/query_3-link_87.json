        "text": "Jennifer Lopez is seemingly fanning the flames of online speculation that there is trouble in paradise with her husband, Ben Affleck, after reacting to a vague post about unhealthy relationships.\n\nAccording to Page Six, the \"On the Floor\" singer reportedly \"liked\" a post on Instagram about that states \"you can't build a relationship with someone who is disconnected from themselves.\" The detailed post highlighted qualities that would cause strain in any relationship, like lack of \"communication skills\" and \"integrity and emotional safety\" as well as someone who \"doesn't respect your time\" and \"doesn't know who they are or what they want.\"\n\nThe post was originally shared in March, but Lopez didn't react to the post until this week. The Instagram account that originally shared the post, yourcourageouscomeback, pointed out on Thursday (May 16) that either Lopez or someone on her team seemed to resonate with the advice and left a \"like\" on the post.\n\nEarlier in the day, TMZ reported that the couple were living separately, noting that the Academy Award winner has been staying at a house in the Brentwood neighborhood of L.A., allegedly without his wife, and different from the home they share together in Beverly Hills.\n\nDespite the intense speculation and after \"liking\" the post, Lopez was spotted in Los Angeles Thursday afternoon sporting a certain accessory that hints that the rumors surrounding her reportedly rocky relationship are just that â€” rumors. TMZ shared photos of the Marry Me star outside a dance studio holding a laptop with her wedding ring on full display."
