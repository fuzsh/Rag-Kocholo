        "text": "IF this is the look of love, we’d hate to see detachment.\n\nSo concluded body-language experts, marriage therapists and other observers following Sunday’s Grammy Awards duet between Jennifer Lopez and her husband of seven months, Marc Anthony, who barely looked into one another’s eyes.\n\nAgainst a boudoir setting borrowed from a Telemundo soap opera, the couple sang Anthony’s “Escapemonos” (“Let’s Escape”), about a couple’s yearning to love each other in private, away from the spotlight.\n\nAside from the irony of performing that song before millions, the couple’s distinct lack of chemistry made some wonder what they’re really trying to flee.\n\n“Their marriage raised a lot of questions, and this performance raises even more,” said Sharyn Wolf, a marriage therapist in Manhattan.\n\nShe said it looked as if the couple had been fighting.\n\n“He looked wooden and stressed, and she looked wooden, stressed and cold,” Wolfe said.\n\n“Here they are, a husband and wife, recently married, and for whatever reason, they couldn’t make it appear as if they were engaged by each other, invested in the material and pleased to be performing . . . “There was a tremendous sense of unhappiness between them that had nothing to do with singing a sad song. You might expect, at the end, they’d turn around as a couple – lift their arms together, maybe give each other a squeeze – to show it was just a song.”\n\nAfter all, this was the couple’s first musical performance since their secret June 5 wedding, following J.Lo’s well-publicized break from Ben Affleck and Anthony’s split from his wife, the mom of his two children.\n\nAs emcee Queen Latifah breathlessly put it, it was the first time “two of the world’s most charismatic artists” were performing together.\n\nSo it was a shock to discover, as Manhattan therapist Bonnie Eaker Weil put it, that “she’s not in love with him at all!”\n\n“I was blown away,” declared the author of “Make Up, Don’t Break Up.”\n\n“This is supposed to be a love song, but she couldn’t even act the part. He seemed very much in love with her – he touched her elbow, her hair – but she was disconnected, aloof.\n\n“It doesn’t look as if she has the kind of passion she had with Ben Affleck. You can’t fake it. If it’s not there, it’s not there!”\n\nNearly everyone who spoke about the duet was struck by the fact that – for a couple singing about looking into one another’s eyes, J.Lo and her man seemed to look everywhere but.\n\n“I’ve watched it several times,” says bodylanguage expert Patti Wood, “and it’s not a normal duet. Normally, they’d be singing to each other, they’d play off each other.\n\n“He made some attempts to connect. Once he walked over to put his hand on her shoulder, only he didn’t even get the shoulder – he got hair!”\n\nJ.Lo’s performance, Wood notes, was “all about her. . . What it didn’t say was, ‘This is my partner – he’s important.’ “\n\nNon-Spanish speakers might have been surprised to find that they sang a love song instead of a kissoff.\n\n“Let’s hide from the crowd,” Anthony’s lyrics say, “so that we are alone, my love.”\n\nTo the casual observer, alone is what they seemed to be.\n\nMusically, the duo struck a sour note as well, according to Rolling Stone music editor Joe Levy, who said the scene played like a soap opera. “By definition, soap operas are cheesy and melodramatic,” he said. “That’s what it felt like.”\n\nNevertheless, Blender’s editor in chief, Craig Marks, found the act “pretty compelling.”\n\n“If anything, I think the Grammys needed a touch of glamour and strange romance attached to it.”\n\nStrange indeed.\n\n– Additional reporting by Mary Huhn and Corey Seymour"
