        "text": "(Agencies)\n\nUpdated: 2004-06-06 14:45\n\nJennifer Lopez reportedly married Marc Anthony in a small ceremony at her home on Saturday, less than six months after she ended her high-profile engagement to Ben Affleck.\n\nActress-singer Jennifer Lopez has married her current boyfriend, salsa singer Marc Anthony, Us Weekly reported on June 5, 2004. The magazine said Lopez, 33, married Latin music star Anthony, 34, at her home in Los Angeles on Saturday in front of about 40 guests. [Reuters/file]\n\nBoth Us Weekly and People magazines reported the nuptials. Messages left by The Associated Press with representatives for both Anthony and Lopez were not immediately returned, and neither magazine published comment from their publicists.\n\nFor Lopez, 33, the marriage would mark her third - the first was to waiter Ojani Noa in 1997, the second to dancer Cris Judd in 2001. Noa lasted a little more than a year; Judd for nine months.\n\nAnthony, the Latin singing sensation, just divorced former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres last week in the Dominican Republic. The pair, wed in 2000, have two young sons, and he has a daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nActress Jennifer Lopez and fiance actor Ben Affleck are shown in this Dec. 8, 2002, file photo in New York. Lopez reportedly married Latin singer Marc Anthony in a small ceremony at her home on Saturday, June 5, 2004, less than six months after she ended her high-profile engagement to Affleck. Both US Weekly and People magazines reported the nuptials. [AP/File]\n\nLopez - the singer-actress-fashonista more famously known as J.Lo - has kept her romance with Anthony, 34, decidedly more low-key than her engagement to Ben Affleck, which was a magnet for tabloid attention. The 18-month ``Bennifer'' romance featured a near-wedding, but it was scuttled at the last minute with the couple blaming excessive media attention.\n\nLopez also famously dated Sean ``P. Diddy'' Combs - back when he was still ``Puffy'' - for two years before the couple broke up in February 2001.\n\nIt was unclear when Anthony and Lopez were engaged. The two first dated in 1999 and had been seen together since Lopez's split from Affleck. Lopez had reportedly been wearing a dazzling new diamond engagement ring for several weeks.\n\nWhite tents and an altar were set up outside Lopez's house on Saturday, with folding chairs on both sides of an aisle, Us reported. The two were married shortly after 6 p.m. before about 40 guests, Us reported. Lopez reportedly wore Neil Lane jewelry and a dress with a veil. Lopez's mother, Guadalupe, arrived at the event in a limousine with Anthony, ``Entertainment Tonight'' reported.\n\nAnthony and Lopez were both born in New York.\n\nUs reported that Saturday's wedding was coordinated by Sharon Sachs, who also planned Lopez's wedding to Judd and the canceled wedding to Affleck in Santa Barbara.\n\nLopez was on screen most recently as Affleck's wife in ``Jersey Girl.'' She dies minutes into the film.\n\nAnthony, a salsa superstar who has also had crossover success, is releasing a Spanish album, ``Amar Sin Mentiras,'' on Tuesday. He has also dabbled in acting, and appeared in the recent Denzel Washington film ``Man on Fire.\""
