        "text": "This photo shows Marc and his first daughter, Ariana Muniz, whom he had with his first notorious relationship, Debbie Rosado.\n\nRosado is a police officer from Puerto Rico. They were together for only a couple of years, but they had two kids, Ariana and Chase, whom they adopted in 1995.\n\nMarc and Dayanara met in 1998, kicking off a relationship that had many ups and downs, including a couple of separations and reconciliations. They got married for the first time in May 2000, and had two kids, Cristian and Ryan. In 2002, the couple separated, only to get back together again later that year and renew their vows.\n\nIn 2003, the couple separated definitively, with Dayanara filing for a divorce. While the pair experienced many ups and downs and went through a complex divorce, they appear to have set their differences aside for the health of their children. This year, Marc and Dayanara attended their son Ryan’s graduation. They took pictures together and looked comfortable with eachother.\n\nIn 2004, Marc began one of his longest-lasting relationships, with one of the world’s biggest pop stars. Jennifer and Marc surprised the world that year when they announced they were getting married, kicking off a relationship that lasted seven years and that resulted in two kids, Emme and Max. Jennifer and Marc were one of Hollywood’s favorite couples, making musical collaborations together and even starring in a movie.\n\nWhile their relationship kicked off in 2004, they’d known each other since the 90’s, when they were just starting their professional careers. While they divorced, the couple ended their relationship amicably, and are now great co-parents to their children.\n\nAfter his relationship with Jennifer ended, Marc spent a few years without a notorious romantic relationship. That is until he met Shannon De Lima, the young and beautiful Venezuelan model. The couple met in 2014 and became a source of interest for the paparazzi and media. They got married that year and divorced in 2017.\n\nWhile the media made a fuss about their divorce and speculated much about their relationship and whether infidelities were involved, Shannon explained that the divorce was amicable and that she thought Marc was a great person. “We are really great friends. I care for him a lot. Things don’t work out sometimes, but it’s not as dramatic as people see it,” she said in an interview with People Magazine.\n\nIn 2019, Marc was spotted with J Lynne, also known as Jessica Lynne Harris, who is a model. They made their public debut in December of that year. J Lynne and Marc had an apparently serious relationship, with her meeting Marc’s children and even Jennifer Lopez and her then partner, Alex Rodriguez.\n\nJ Lynne was previously linked to Scott Disick, where they were photographed together in 2017."
