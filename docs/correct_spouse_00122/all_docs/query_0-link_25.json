        "text": "On the heels of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck saying “I do” in front of their friends and family, we are taking a look back at the “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” singer’s most high-profile relationships and marriages.\n\nHere is everything to know about everyone who once had J.Lo’s love.\n\nAlex Rodriguez\n\nLopez and Rodriguez began dating in March of 2017, with a source telling Page Six at the time: “They are really into each other because they have so much in common — from their Latin roots to their love of New York and their kids.”\n\nThe former Yankee confirmed the romance during an appearance on “The View” that same month and made their first appearance together courtside at a Lakers game.\n\nRodriguez popped the question during a lavish vacation in March 2019, but sadly they will not be making it down the aisle after all following rumors he was messaging “Southern Charm” star Madison LeCroy.\n\nA former Playboy Playmate claimed that Rodriguez begged her for a threesome shortly before he proposed to Lopez and baseball player Jose Canseco alleged that Rodriguez had an affair with his ex-wife, Jessica.\n\nThe couple called off their engagement in March 2021, Page Six exclusively reported.\n\nDrake\n\nLopez and Drake were linked a few months in 2016, but industry insiders were skeptical of the union between the two PR-savvy pros.\n\n“This relationship is fake, it is just a publicity stunt to publicize their record together,” a source told Page Six in January 2017. “If Jennifer and Drake were really dating, they’d be way more private about it.”\n\n“Doesn’t Drake realize that it looks weird to declare his love for RiRi at the MTV awards, then start flaunting his chemistry with J.Lo a few months later?” the source added of Drake’s emotional tribute to Rihanna at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nCasper Smart\n\nLopez dated Casper Smart, who was 17 years her junior, for two and a half years.\n\n“It was really professional for a very long time before anything even happened,” Smart said in 2012. “It just really spontaneously happened I guess. The chemistry was there. You can’t fight it.”\n\nThey split in 2014 amid reports that Smart had been allegedly sexting with two transsexual models. They would reunite in 2015 before breaking things off for good in 2016.\n\nMarc Anthony\n\nLopez’s whirlwind romance with fellow Latin music superstar Marc Anthony began in September 2003, with the couple saying their “I dos” in June 2004, just a week after his divorce from former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres was finalized.\n\nThey welcomed twins, Max and Emme, in 2008, before splitting in 2011.\n\nLopez would go on to say that collaborating on their 2017 Spanish-language album “Por Primera Vez” “actually kind of repaired certain parts of our relationship that had been fractured from our marriage and our divorce.”\n\nBen Affleck\n\n“Bennifer” became one of the most overexposed celebrity couples of the Aughts, with Affleck memorably cradling Lopez’s famed rear in her video for “Jenny From the Block.”\n\nThe two met while making “Gigli” in 2001 while Lopez was still married to Cris Judd. Affleck and Lopez got engaged in November 2002 — with Lopez reportedly ordering a $15K gown from Vera Wang — but broke things off a reported two days before the ceremony.\n\nLopez would go on to say Affleck was “her first big heartbreak,” however the pair later rekindled their romance.\n\nPage Six reported the couple were fully back together again after photos of them getting cozy on a date surfaced in June 2021.\n\nThey continued to date seriously for months, before he popped the question for the second time, confirming that they were engaged in April 2022.\n\nLopez and Affleck officially revealed they said “I do” in the July 17 edition of her “On The JLo” newsletter.\n\n“We did it. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient,” she wrote of the Las Vegas ceremony, noting it was “exactly what we wanted.”\n\nThe “Marry Me” actress also said she wore “a dress from an old movie” as they exchanged vows in the “little chapel” and “gave one another the rings we’ll wear for the rest of our lives.”\n\nCris Judd\n\nLopez’s second marriage was to dancer and choreographer Cris Judd. The pair met in Spain in late 2000 when he was hired to direct her music video for “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” and wed in September 2001, splitting in June 2002.\n\n“Your privacy is breached,” Judd later said of the relationship. “You’re no longer a normal person. [Our wedding] was a circus. I think several people got arrested trying to climb up a mountain … trying to sneak in. We actually rented the airspace.”\n\nDiddy\n\nArguably the music power-couple for the extremely limited window of 1999-2001. But the relationship between Lopez and Sean “Diddy” Combs — then still going by Puff Daddy — was both marred by allegations of infidelity by Combs and dragged into the courts with a weapons-and-bribery trial in connection with a December 1999 shooting at Club New York. (A jury eventually acquitted him.)\n\nNone of that stopped Combs from comparing their relationship to two other famous couples: Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra and Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe.\n\n“I’m Frank, you know what I’m saying?” he added, helpfully.\n\nOjani Noa\n\nLopez tied the knot with first husband Cuban waiter Ojani Noa in February 1997 after meeting in Miami while she was filming “Blood and Wine.”\n\nTheir marriage was over just 11 months later in January 1998, but that didn’t stop Noa from shopping an alleged honeymoon sex tape around."
