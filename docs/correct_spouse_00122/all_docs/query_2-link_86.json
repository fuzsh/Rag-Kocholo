        "text": "Two of the most popular personalities in the world of training surprised the public when they decided to unite their lives in 2004, but a decade later the astonishment was even greater when it was announced that the relationship had come to an end.\n\nSudden union\n\nJennifer Lopez was less than a year after breaking up with actor Ben Affleck; and Marc Anthony was only four days after formally announcing his divorce from Dayanara Torres, when the two singers announced to their fans that they were getting married.\n\nThus, the couple walked down the aisle in June 2004 and with that, they became one of the industry's most important musical bellwethers.\n\nIn this light, there was a rumor that their relationship was a publicity stunt to boost both of their careers, but that was ruled out four years later with the arrival of their twins Emme and Max.\n\nDespite how solid the marriage looked, in 2016 Jennifer and Marc by mutual agreement ended their marital relationship.\n\nSince then, although several issues that could have been the trigger have been touched upon, the exact cause that led to the sentimental rupture has not been made known.\n\nUnsolved mystery\n\nIt was mentioned that the singer's taste for parties and celebrations accompanied by his friends ended up tiring his then wife, but nothing was clarified at the time.\n\nIt was not until Jennifer Lopez published her book True Love, when the interpreter touched the subject of their separation and claims that a panic attack made her think about ending their marriage.\n\n\"I was sitting there getting my makeup done and all of a sudden I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest and I couldn't breathe, I started to feel anxious. I felt like I was going crazy and I uttered those words, 'I can't go on with Marc.' No one knew what I was going through. My single On the floor was number one all over the world, but my relationship was fading and I was terrified,\" she describes.\n\nIn this regard, Marc Anthony has remained silent until today, so the reason for the separation with the singer will remain a mystery."
