        "text": "Jennifer Lopez is reportedly turning to her ex-husband, Marc Anthony, for support after ending her engagement to Alex Rodriguez. Lopez and Anthony tied the knot in 2004 before eventually divorcing in 2014. The exes share twins Emme and Max, 13, and have stayed close during the years since their split.\n\n“Jennifer is doing well. She is still filming in the Dominican Republic. The kids have visited her and they make her the happiest,” an insider tells People. “Jennifer and Marc Anthony have a great relationship. Having Marc around while she has had to work abroad has been very comforting for Jennifer.”\n\nLopez and Rodriguez began dating in early 2017 and announced their engagement two years later in 2019. The power couple seemed solid until outlets began reporting in March 2021 that they had split. However, they quickly released a statement denying the story.\n\n“We are working through some things,” Lopez and Rodriguez said in a joint statement, which was obtained by People. “She’s working in the Dominican Republic and he’s in Miami, so it’s tough seeing each other especially with quarantining and COVID,” a source said. “But they want to try to stay together.”\n\nLater that month they were photographed kissing in the Dominican Republic, where Lopez is filming the movie Shotgun Wedding. However, their reunion was short-lived and they later confirmed in a statement to Today in April that they’d called off their engagement.\n\n“We have realized we are better as friends and look forward to remaining so,” they said. “We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects. We wish the best for each other and one another’s children. Out of respect for them, the only other comment we have to say is thank you to everyone who has sent kind words and support.”"
