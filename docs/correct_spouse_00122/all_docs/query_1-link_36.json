        "text": "NEW YORK -- After months of widespread speculation, Jennifer Lopez has confirmed that she and Marc Anthony are indeed married.\n\n\"Yes, we're married,\" Lopez tells People magazine, on newsstands Friday. \"I mean, come on, everyone knows. It's not a secret.\"\n\nIt was the first public acknowledgment of her union with the salsa singer - an unusually long delay considering the ceremony was last June at her Beverly Hills, Calif., home.\n\nThe couple performed a duet, though, at the Feb. 13 Grammy Awards show. Lopez says she was ailing from swollen glands and a sore throat during the performance, which caused her to cancel a London trip to promote the British release of her film \"Shall We Dance?\"\n\nThough the trip cancellation prompted some speculation of pregnancy, Lopez says she's \"not on a timetable\" to have a baby - though she hopes to become a mother someday.\n\nNow, the 34-year-old says, she's entered \"phase two\": a less public, a \"little bit suburban\" life with Anthony - and a far cry from her \"Bennifer\" days with former fiance Ben Affleck. But Lopez counts the high-profile romance as a learning experience.\n\n\"I take responsibility for the fact that I didn't make adjustments,\" she says. \"Now I'm a little more careful. I travel in a certain way. I leave at a certain time. I learned.\"\n\nLopez's new album, \"Rebirth,\" will be released Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nhttp://www.jenniferlopez.com"
