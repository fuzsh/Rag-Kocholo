        "text": "var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]);\n\nMarc Anthony may not want that kiss he shared with ex-wife Jennifer Lopez last month at the Latin Grammy Awards to be their last.\n\nA source reportedly told Us Weekly the 48-year-old singer is “still in love” with 47-year-old Lopez and “is trying to get back together with her.”\n\nIsn’t he too old for her?\n\nThe pair split in July 2011 after being married for seven years, and have 8-year-old twins.\n\nAnthony recently split with his wife, Venezuelan model Shannon De lima and Lopez ended her 4-year-relationship with dancer Casper Smart in August.\n\n“As soon as he heard Jennifer split with Casper, he wanted out,” said the source.\n\nMusic has brought the two back together. Anthony is producing Lopez’s upcoming Spanish-language album. The insider reportedly said they “have magic when they sing together. That’s how they came together last time. There is just this chemistry between them.”\n\nThat was evident at the Latin Grammys on Nov. 17, where they sang “Olvídame y Pega la Vuelta.” Then Lopez presented Anthony with the person of the year award. Responding to crowd chanting, the pair shared a kiss.\n\nA source close to Lopez reportedly told Us Weekly Lopez is “happily single” and has “no plans” to reunite with Anthony. Though the person added “She did make beautiful music with Marc.”"
