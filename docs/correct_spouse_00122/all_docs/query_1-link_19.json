        "text": "On Friday, news broke that Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony were splitting up after seven years of marriage.\n\n“We have decided to end our marriage. This was a very difficult decision. We have come to an amicable conclusion on all matters,” the couple said in a statement issued to several publications.\n\nLopez and Anthony were married in 2004 and have two children together: Max and Emme. Professionally, the couple is producing the upcoming Latin American competition series Q’Viva (The Chosen).\n\nAnthony is currently recurring on TNT’s Hawthorne and serving as a music supervisor on the Jada Pinkett Smith drama, while Lopez most recently served as a judge on Fox’s American Idol.\n\nHere are some of Hollywood’s reactions to the sudden split:\n\nAlyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano): “Anyone else really upset about JLo and Marc Anthony splitting? #SadFace”\n\nEliza Dushku (@elizadushku): “Whoa. @RollingStone Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony are getting divorced.”\n\nJulie Benz (@juliebenz): “My relationship advice- never marry a man who has smaller thighs than your own #randomthoughtsinmyhead”\n\nMindy Kaling (@mindykaling): “(I know you guys are all wondering – I’m just pretending the JLo-Marc Anthony thing isn’t happening. Too much. Too much.)”\n\nGiuliana Rancic (@GiulianaRancic): “Yikes!!! Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony have split up,” before tweeting later, “I feel like this j.lo/marc split came from out of the blue. Remember their super sexy performance on Idol recently? There were no signs.”\n\nNeal Brennan (@nealbrennan): “JLo & Marc Anthony announce divorce. JLo to regain full custody of fame she shared with him.”\n\nCandace Cameron Bure (@candacecbure): “Seriously sad to read that JLo and Marc Anthony split :(“\n\nKeke Palmer (@KekePalmer): “I LOVE @JLo. I mean, I just love her!!”\n\nWendy Williams (@WendyWilliams): “Just landed & want 2 cry. No I want 2 eat. 2 scream WHY? What I want 2 do most is say it’s time for Hot Topics. Marc & JLO getting divorced.”\n\nZack Stentz (@MuseZack), Thor and X-Men: First Class screenwriter: “So according to Twitter, Harry Potter divorces Marc Anthony and gets caught in carmaggeddon?"
