        "text": "This summer, Jennifer Lopez turns 50. To commemorate the multi-hyphenate's birthday on July 24th, we’re counting down with 50 Days of J.Lo, a celebration of the woman who’s shown us all by example how to be ageless—inside and out.\n\nAy, como los extraño!\n\nThat translates to, Oh, how I miss them! in Spanish, an adequate summary of my melodramatic thoughts about Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony’s romance. When these two were together, in my opinion, they were as trendy as Sonny and Cher, as sexy as Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, and as cool as Will and Jada Pinkett Smith. In other words: they were iconic, an untouchable Hollywood couple that captured a particular moment in our pop-culture lexicon.\n\nBefore I explain how, exactly, the pair touched the lives of Latinos like myself, let’s revisit their dating history. Lopez, 49, and Marc Anthony, 50,—two New Yorkers of Puerto Rican descent—famously met in 1998, when the two-time Grammy winner performed in the Broadway show The Capeman. Before they would go on to release epic duets together and eventually fell in love, Anthony married and divorced former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres (whom he has two children with), while Lopez dated Diddy, married and divorced Chris Judd, and eventually became engaged to then broke up with Ben Affleck.\n\nBut the chemistry between Lopez and Anthony was obvious way back in the music video for Lopez’s 1999 song “No Me Ames” (more on that later). His first-ever words to her? “One day you’re going to be my wife,” Anthony told her, according to her memoir, . However, it wasn’t until June of 2004 that they wed in a private at-home ceremony in Beverly Hills. Four years later, they welcomed twins Max and Emme on February 22, 2008. And then...well, in 2011, they announced their separation—prompting immediate heartbreak for each other and, selfishly, fans like myself.\n\nLook, I get that Anthony isn’t as famous to Americans as say, George Clooney. Some folks may have even only recently heard of him as her ex (if you're one of them, here are a few fun facts for you) after his 11-year-old daughter with Lopez, Emme, has come out as a talented singer in her own right. He’s also recognizable from the many photos Lopez posts with him, her children, and her new fiancé, Alex Rodriguez, on social media, teaching us all a lesson in what a healthy, fully-functional blended family looks like.\n\nBut for the Latin America community and Latinos like myself, their love for each other during their marriage served as an emblem of what passion can look like—one that people from Colombia to Nicaragua to the Dominican Republic and yes, Puerto Rico, regularly speak of and still feel nostalgic for. It’s not that Lopez and Anthony were the first major Latino couple to go mainstream with their love (looking at you, Emilio and Gloria Estefan), it’s that the timing of their coupling fell during the early 2000s, at the height of our culture’s obsession with gossip rags and stories that opened the curtains to the lifestyles of the rich and famous.\n\nOh, and then there was the music.\n\nNot only did Lopez and Anthony allow us to witness their affection for one another on the red carpet and eventually in film (they co-starred in the Héctor Lavoe biopic ), but their soulful vocals soared loudly through Latino households like my own, filling living rooms (salas), kitchens (cocinas), and bedrooms (cuartos) with joy and confirmation that as Latinos, we belonged.\n\nThe duo made their official debut as a couple while performing “Escapemonos” at the 2005 Grammys together. According to MTV, Lopez starred in Anthony’s “Contra La Corriente” music video right around the time they met. And in 1999, they recorded the dreamy ballad “No Me Ames” off her debut album, On the 6. Together, they moved on to become frequent collaborators: she cast his daughter Arianna in her “Get Right” music video; he made guest appearances while she judged American Idol; and even after their breakup, they consistently fueled rumors of a joint, post-breakup Spanish language album.\n\nIt’s “No Me Ames”—which, if translated, opens with the dramatic lyrics, “Tell me why you cry / of happiness / and why are you drowning? / For loneliness”—that literally has made fans like me cry and pine for the days when these two were together.\n\nLopez and Anthony have other duets, but it's this hit in particular—which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in 1999—that draws up so many memories for people like me who listened to it with family. Growing up in a Spanish-only Miami home like mine, my playlist shuffled back and forth between 2000s phenoms (think: Britney Spears and *NSYNC) and the records of Latino icons like Celia Cruz, Oscar D’León, and yes, Marc Anthony.\n\nWhen I’d play Spears’ “…Baby One More Time,” the immigrant women in my family would bop their heads and ask, “Que quiere decir eso?\" (\"What does that mean?\") But when “No Me Ames” came on, we all not only understood the lyrics, but appreciated the artists crooning for us. The song gave us something to talk about, and we used it as a tool for getting to know each other better, despite the cultural differences that arise in immigrant-American households. Even my friends—who often felt embarrassed to embrace the Latino traditions we’d later fully appreciate—fell in love with the song.\n\n“I was such a huge fan of his music in Spanish,” Lopez told Billboard about the collaboration, explaining that she said to Anthony, “Maybe we should do something in Spanish, I just love your music.” Dan Shea, who produced the ballad version, also recently opened up about the song, admitting their chemistry while recording was undeniable: “There was definitely a strong creative connection. When Jennifer was singing her part, Marc would stand next to her. He would throw ideas. Because it was in Spanish, there was an immediate personal bond that came into play. I mean, this was a love song.”\n\nI use “No Me Ames” as an example because, while the song itself is a fan favorite, people also came to cherish the times when it was sung by a real-life couple. For so many Latinos, it’s the very first thing that comes to mind each time Lopez and Anthony reunite on stage—and even after their breakup, they’ve saved it for only the most special of occasions. In her 2014 HBO documentary , we see thousands of people quite literally burst into tears and shake when Lopez surprises her fans in Puerto Rico with an appearance by Anthony to sing the tune. I, too, would lose my mind if I had the opportunity to catch them singing “No Me Ames” together—or even if they sung another duet, as they did with their remake of \"Olvídame y Pega la Vuelta\" at the 2016 Latin Grammys before jokingly sharing a kiss—and, of course, fueling speculation of a rekindled romance.\n\nAll of this is to say that regardless of where they stand today, their relationship simply made—and makes—people happy. Lopez and Anthony finalized their divorce in June 2014, with J.Lo getting primary custody of Max and Emme. And though their post-divorce relationship took some time to iron out, they’ve gotten to a place where they can successfully co-parent.\n\n“[Anthony] was devastated when they split, and he will always be a part of her life because of their similar backgrounds, their kids, and their love of music and performing,” a source told People in 2016. A year later, Lopez opened up during Live with Kelly about their split, admitting she would not get back together with Anthony: “I think we’re really good the way we are. Honestly, we’re always gonna be great friends…We share something very special in the kids, and we know that. We’re there for them. That’s the main thing.”\n\nIt is, of course, our responsibility as fans to honor and respect the decisions of celebrities we adore, and I have so much respect for the way they've managed to create a blended family and maintain their friendship post-breakup. But a not-so-little part of me secretly wishes Lopez and Anthony could have stayed together—that they could have made it work for my own selfish entertainment. But as Lopez said, they seem happier “the way they are.” And whenever I yearn for the days when their coupledom made headlines, I know I can always turn on “No Me Ames” and reminisce nostalgically, if only for a few minutes, on one of our culture's most romantic moments."
