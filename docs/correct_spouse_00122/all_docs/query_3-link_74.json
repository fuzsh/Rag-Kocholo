        "text": "Marc Anthony has finally broken his silence on his split from Jennifer Lopez.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ABC News’ Nightline set to air Thursday, August 25, 2011, the Grammy-winning singer denies tabloid reports that their breakup was due to affairs.\n\n“I’ll tell you that it wasn’t something sensationalistic happening,” he says, adding that the marriage simply no longer “worked.”\n\nSTORY: Jennifer Lopez Breaks Silence on Split From Marc Anthony\n\n“It was a realization on both our parts,” he adds. “So you know it wasn’t shocking. These things happen. It was a decision that we made jointly.”\n\nAnthony also tells ABC News‘ John Quinones that he will always have feelings for his estranged wife and mom to their 3-year-old twins, Max and Emme.\n\n“I’ll always love Jennifer,” he says “She knows that; my kids know that. Jennifer’s a wonderful, wonderful woman, a wonderful mother, a wonderful friend.”\n\nSTORY: Jennifer Lopez Performs at Wedding in Ukraine on Heels of Split With Marc Anthony\n\nThe couple announced their split July 15 after seven years of marriage.\n\n“It is sad because you think about the impact of all those people who believe in you,” Anthony says. “You think about your family and the possibilities, but we realized very early on that even though we’re not together, our story’s not over. There are things to do together; there is life to see together through Max and Emme. So it’s all good, man.”\n\nIn fact, Anthony and Lopez are working together on a reality show together, the Latin talent search Q’Viva: The Chosen, which is still going forward despite their split.\n\nAnnounced in June, the collaboration between Lopez, Anthony, director-choreographer Jamie King and American Idol creator and XIX Entertainment CEO Simon Fuller seeks to find the best undiscovered performers south of the border.\n\nSTORY: Marc Anthony Addresses Jennifer Lopez Split at Concert\n\n“The show goes on,” a rep for XIX told The Hollywood Reporter in July. “Q’Viva!, the hotly anticipated 2012 celebration of Latin music, artistry and dance, is set to film this autumn in South America with Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony as previously announced.”\n\nAnd Anthony says fans shouldn’t feel sorry for either him or Lopez.\n\n“This is not a funeral; this is not a burial,” he says of the breakup. “This is just two people who came together and just realized — and so I’m saying that it wasn’t sustainable the way it was, and that’s that.”\n\nA portion of the interview also will air Thursday on Good Morning America."
