        "text": "Deeming his \"personal life\" off-limits, Marc Anthony (search) dodged questions Tuesday about whether he and Jennifer Lopez (search) got married this past weekend.\n\nThe Latin singer, performing in Rockefeller Plaza for NBC's \"Today\" show, repeatedly deflected questions from host Matt Lauer about the widely reported nuptials.\n\nAnthony could be seen wearing what appeared to be a wedding ban on his left hand while performing Tuesday.\n\nLopez and Anthony reportedly tied the knot Saturday in a small ceremony at her Beverly Hills, Calif., home. Anthony's publicist would not comment Monday. Lopez's representative didn't immediately return a call Monday, but told The Associated Press on Sunday that he had no comment.\n\n\"If she's in love with somebody and that makes her happy, I'm happy for her,\" former boyfriend Sean \"P. Diddy\" (search) Combs told \"Access Hollywood\" Monday night. \"That's my girl for life.\"\n\nBut dancer Cris Judd, Lopez's second husband, said he was surprised to learn that she'd married Anthony, the Latin singer she first dated in 1999.\n\n\"She did?\" Judd asked, then added, \"You know what? I wish her and Marc the best and hey, if it's true to her heart then by all means.\"\n\nJudd then turned to the syndicated entertainment show's cameras and sent the newlyweds a message: \"Jen, Marc, I wish you the best, and happiness, definitely.\"\n\nAnd the man who could have been husband No. 3, Ben Affleck, gave the union \"two thumbs up,\" according to US Weekly.\n\nThis is the third marriage for the 34-year-old Lopez — the first was to waiter Ojani Noa in 1997, the second to Judd in 2001. Noa lasted a little more than a year; Judd for nine months.\n\nThe singer-actress also was engaged to Affleck, her \"Gigli\" co-star, but amid a huge media frenzy they canceled their plans in September 2003 and broke up in January.\n\nAnthony, 34, just divorced former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres last week in the Dominican Republic. They married in 2000 and have two young sons; Anthony also has a daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nAnthony was also scheduled to appear on ABC's \"The View\" on Tuesday to promote his new album, \"Amar Sin Mentiras,\" which means \"To Love Without Lies\" in Spanish."
