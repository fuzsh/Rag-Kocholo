Absolutely. And I would appreciate it,'' the 34-year-old singer said.\n\nAnthony, who performed in Rockefeller Plaza, could be seen wearing what appeared to be a wedding band on his left hand.\n\nWhen Lauer continued to ask whether a wedding had taken place Saturday at Lopez's home in Beverly Hills, Calif., Anthony responded, ``That would fall into the category of personal. And that's where I'm going to leave it.''\n\nLopez's representative didn't immediately return a call Monday, but told The Associated Press on Sunday that he had no comment.\n\nThis would be the third marriage for the 33-year-old Lopez _ the first was to waiter Ojani Noa in 1997, the second to Cris Judd in 2001. Noa lasted a little more than a year; Judd for nine months.\n\nThe singer-actress also was engaged to Ben Affleck, her ``Gigli'' co-star, but they canceled their plans in September 2003 amid a huge media frenzy and broke up in January.\n\nAnthony divorced former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres last week in the Dominican Republic. They married in 2000 and have two young sons; Anthony also has a daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nHis new album, ``Amar Sin Mentiras,'' means ``To Love Without Lies'' in Spanish."
