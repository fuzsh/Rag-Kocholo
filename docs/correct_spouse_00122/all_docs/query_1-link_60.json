        "text": "Originally appeared on E! Online\n\nJennifer Lopez refuses to let speculation play her for a fool.\n\nThat's why she had no problem shutting down a question about the breakup rumors surrounding herself and husband Ben Affleck. During a recent press conference for her new Netflix movie \"Atlas,\" Lopez was asked point blank by a reporter to address her \"situation\" with the Oscar winner.\n\nHer answer? After briefly laughing it off, the multi-hyphenate put up a serious front, leaned in and — as seen in footage captured by El Gordo y la Flaca — jokingly told the interviewer, \"You know better than that.\"\n\nOne of her fellow panelists also scolded the question, saying into the mic, \"C'mon, don't come in here with that.\"\n\nBut that's not to say Lopez is refusing to talk about Affleck. In fact, she did a quick mention of the \"Justice League\" star — who she married in Las Vegas in July 2022, before saying \"I do\" again a month later in Georgia — during her May 20 appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's Georgia Wedding\n\nEntertainment News\n\nWhile sharing the story of how she met Barbra Streisand, Lopez recalled the EGOT winner raving over the engagement ring Affleck had given her, saying, \"'So that's a big diamond.'\"\n\n\"It was so surreal,\" Lopez recounted of the encounter, \"but I was just so taken by her.\"\n\nThe \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" singer also cheekily referenced her marriage to Affleck when talking about her 16-year-old twins Max and Emme, who she shares with ex-husband Marc Anthony. After explaining to host Jimmy Kimmel that her kids find it \"awkward\" to watch her perform in racy costumes, she quipped, \"I do do sexy things at home sometimes, but they don't know that.\""
