        "text": "Jennifer Lopez has been open about the highs and lows in her marriage with ex-husband and father of her children, Marc Anthony . In her 2014 book, “True Love,” she’s candidly discussed what it was like splitting up with Anthony, how she invited him to sing on her tour with her shortly after their divorce, and so on. Now, more info has come out about how JLO originally decided to marry her ex-husband of 10 years.\n\nAccording to “True Love,” Lopez explained that she was heartbroken after her breakup with ex-fiancé, actor Ben Affleck . JLO explained that she was publicly known to hop from one relationship to the next but revealed that’s how she coped with heartbreak and pain.\n\n“Ben and I split up at the moment when I thought we were committing to each other forever,” wrote Lopez. “It was my first real heartbreak; it felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest. And when the realization that I wasn’t going to have the fairy tale family I wanted really set in, well, that was when I really started to fall apart.”\n\nIn her book, the singer went on to explain how she ended up starting a relationship with Anthony. She said at the time she thought her and Anthony were meant to be together considering she ran into the singer a few days after she was supposed to marry Affleck, so she took their meet up as a sign. Lopez and Anthony had a history as they first dated back in 1999. After that, they went on to date other people before rekindling at this time in Lopez’s life.\n\n“We thought that this was where everything was supposed to lead, that we were meant to end up together,” wrote Lopez in her book. “All the heartache and pain of my recent breakup couldn’t have been for nothing, could it? Maybe I had to go through the bad so I could end up with the person I was mean to be with all along,” as stated in “True Love.”\n\nLopez said in her book that since Anthony felt familiar to her, she thought they were actually supposed to end up together. “And that was the moment when Marc reappeared in my life,” wrote Lopez. “Marc and I had been friends for a number of years. We’d worked together on a few songs, and we’d sung a duet for my first record, titled “No Me Ames” (ironically, “Don’t Love Me” in Spanish). Right from the beginning, he never made it a secret that he liked me,” she wrote in “True Love.”\n\nLopez said she turned to Anthony since she didn’t want to be alone at this difficult time her in life. “We make our own choices, and I chose to believe that Marc and I were meant to be together—that destiny was stepping in,” wrote Lopez. “In that moment, I needed to believe that; I needed to believe in something. The reality was, I didn’t want to be alone—so when Marc was there, when he met me with his big smile, his heart on his sleeve, and his arms open wide, I was more than happy to let myself fall into them.”"
