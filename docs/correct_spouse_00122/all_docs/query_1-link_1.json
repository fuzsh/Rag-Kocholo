        "text": "Credit: Christopher Polk/Golden Globes 2024 via Getty Images\n\nJennifer Lopez's Dating History: A Timeline of Her Famous Relationships, Exes and Flings\n\nJennifer Lopez has famously been in several high-profile romances — and she’s finally found her happily ever after. Lopez has been married four times, her most recent marriage being with Ben Affleck. Lopez was previously married to Ojani Noa from 1997 to 1998, Cris Judd from 2001 to 2003 and Marc Anthony, with whom she shares twins Max and Emme, from 2004 to 2014. Before marrying Affleck in 2022, they were previously engaged from 2002 to 2004. In addition, Lopez got engaged to Alex Rodriguez in 2019 before they called it quits in 2021. After ending her relationship with Rodriguez, Lopez then rekindled a romance with Affleck and the singer announced their second engagement in April 2022. Three months later, the couple tied the knot at a wedding chapel in Las Vegas. Scroll through the photos below to relive Lopez’s dating history — from her marriages to her engagements and more:\n\nCredit: KMazur/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nCris Judd\n\nThe Monster-in-Law actress met the dancer on the set of her \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" music video and the two tied the knot in September 2001. The couple's marriage was over by June 2002 and their divorce was finalized in 2003. Judd explained that their marriage “just didn't work out” while speaking with Us Weekly in September 2014. “I can't give you the answer as to why her relationships don't work. I think that it's that it is work. It's whether you want to work on it or not. Everyone has baggage and problems. It's whether you want to deal with those problems,” he told Us at the time. “When you sign up to get married, you can't just walk away.” Judd has since remarried to Kelly Wolfe, with whom he shares daughter Vivienne.\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Jennifer Lopez/Instagram\n\nDrake\n\nThe “God’s Plan” rapper and Lopez first connected backstage in December 2016 after he attended her All I Have show. In January 2017, a source revealed to Us Weekly the pair were dating and were “the real deal.” Drake pulled out all the stops while the pair dated, reportedly decking out an L.A. church for a makeshift winter wonderland-themed prom where they were “crowned” king and queen. However, in February of that year, Us confirmed that they had called it quits, with a source telling Us at the time that their brief relationship “died down a bit” after the “Nice for What” crooner embarked on his European tour. Drake touched on their romance in “Diplomatic Immunity,” rapping “2017 I lost a J. Lo / A Rotterdam trip had me on front page, though,” seemingly referring to the \"Jenny From the Block\" singer’s relationship with Alex Rodriguez.\n\nCredit: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for ELLE Magazine\n\nAlex Rodriguez\n\nFourth time’s the charm? Lopez and the former Yankee announced their engagement in March 2019 after more than two years of dating. The pair — who were first linked in February 2017 — often gushed about their love and admiration for one another. In July 2018, the former Fly Girl penned a sweet tribute to her then-beau on his birthday: “Baby, spending time with you over the past year and a half … getting to know the real you more and more … I am surprised everyday by the generous, loving person you are to me and everyone around you.”\n\nIn October 2018, a source told Us Weekly that the couple were looking into moving in together — which made sense since they had happily merged their families together (Rodriguez shares Natasha and Ella with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis). In December 2018, Rodriguez noted that Lopez made him “feel like a kid again.” A source told Us that month, “An engagement is definitely on the horizon. Alex is obsessed with Jen and spends as much time as he can with her.”\n\nLopez and Rodriguez postponed their wedding multiple times amid the coronavirus pandemic. Us confirmed in March 2021 that they were \"working through some things\" amid reports that the pair had split and called off their two-year engagement.\n\nShe and the retired athlete broke up the following month, writing in a joint statement to Today: “We have realized we are better as friends and look forward to remaining so. We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects. We wish the best for each other and one another’s children. Out of respect for them, the only other comment we have to say is thank you to everyone who has sent kind words and support.\"\n\nCredit: David Fisher/Shutterstock\n\nBen Affleck\n\nThe Justice League star and Lopez — famously nicknamed “Bennifer” by the press — met while filming Gigli, and they got engaged in November 2002. The couple called off their wedding four days ahead of the event and later split up in January 2004. “I was eviscerated. I lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. My relationship [with Affleck] self-destructed in front of the entire world,” the “Not Your Mama” singer told Vanity Fair in December 2017 of the headlines surrounding the critically panned Gigli and her split from the Oscar winner. “It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.” In 2005, the Gone Girl actor later married Jennifer Garner, with whom he shares daughters Violet and Seraphina, and son Samuel. Affleck and Garner’s divorce was finalized in 2018.\n\nIn May 2021, Affleck and Lopez reunited and were spotted together on multiple occasions, including on a getaway in Montana and a romantic getaway to Miami. Us confirmed later that month that the couple were officially back together.\n\n\"Jen and Ben are both very happy with each [other] and are excited to see where the relationship goes,\" a source exclusively revealed to Us. \"They are full-on dating and very happy together.\"\n\nIn April 2022, Lopez announced that the couple were officially engaged for the second time. Us confirmed Affleck and the Parker actress wed in July 2022."
