JENNIFER Lopez has snubbed ex Marc Anthony's fourth wedding as she headed on a loved-up family trip with Ben Affleck.

The 53-year-old star was married to fellow singer Marc, 54, from 2004 until their divorce in 2014.

The former couple have twins Max and Emme together and while they are on amicable terms, Jennifer has made no mention of her ex's nuptials to new wife Nadia Ferreira on social media and didn't attend the ceremony.

Nadia, 23, is a former Miss Universe contestant and she became engaged to Marc eight months ago.

The marriage - Marc's fourth - took place at the Perez Art Museum in Miami on Saturday, with David Beckham acting as best man.

Meanwhile guests included Salma Hayek, and Romeo Santos.

Nadia wore a gown a by Galia Lahav, which Hola described as a "design with a romantic flair, beautiful lace details and a long and voluminous tail."

While Jennifer didn't attend the ceremony, neither did her two children she shares with Marc.

Instead, the singer and actress was seen enjoying an afternoon out for lunch her husband Ben and their kids in Los Angeles.

Jennifer and Ben, 50, married in July last year, a little over a year after they rekindled their romance.

The couple had previously dated from 2002 to 2004 but called off their engagement.

Jennifer looked stylish in a pair of flared jeans, a white T-shirt and furry coat.

She wore platform heels and sunglasses and had her brown hair up in a simple top knot.

Jennifer held hands with Ben, who wore cream chinos, a cream jumper and brown jacket.
