        "text": "One of the greatest moments for an Aggie is the day they receive their Aggie Ring. As the most visible sign of the Aggie Network, the Aggie Ring is a unique representation of achievement, as it can only be ordered when a student completes specific academic requirements.\n\nThe tradition of the Aggie Ring dates back to 1889, when the first rings featured the letters “AMC” — for Agricultural and Mechanical College — entwined on the crest. E.C. Jonas, Class of 1894, designed the Aggie Ring, which includes many of the same symbols used in today’s design.\n\nSlight modifications were made to the ring through 1933, when a committee was formed to help standardize the manufacturing of the ring. The Aggie Ring has remained mostly unchanged since 1933, with one exception: in 1963, the Texas Legislature changed the name of the university from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas to Texas A&M University, and the name on the ring was changed accordingly.\n\nTraditionally, students wear the ring with the class year facing them to signify that their time at Texas A&M is not yet complete. During commencement ceremonies, The Association of Former Students leads a ritual in which Aggies turn their rings around to face the world proudly, just as the Aggie graduates are now ready to face the world.\n\nRing Symbolism\n\nEvery element on the Aggie Ring is symbolic. The top of the ring features a shield that symbolizes the protection of the good reputation of the alma mater. There are 13 stripes on the shield that represent the 13 original states and an Aggie’s patriotism.\n\nThe five stars found in the shield refer to the five phases of Aggie development: mind or intellect, body, spiritual attainment, emotional poise and integrity of character. The eagle on the top of the Aggie Ring symbolizes agility, power and the ability to reach great heights and ambitions.\n\nOne side of the Aggie Ring holds a large star, which symbolizes the seal of the State of Texas, encircled with a wreath of olive and live oak leaves joined together by a ribbon near the bottom of the ring. The wreath of olive leaves represents achievement and desire for peace, while the live oak leaves symbolize the strength to fight. The leaves are joined at the bottom by an encircling ribbon to show the necessity of joining these traits to accomplish one’s ambition to serve.\n\nThe other side of the Aggie Ring contains an ancient cannon, saber and rifle, conveying that the citizens of Texas fought for their land and were determined to defend it. The saber stands for valor and confidence, while the rifle and cannon stand for preparedness and defense. The crossed flags of the United States and Texas recognize an Aggie's dual allegiance to both the nation and state.\n\nLearn about the Aggie Ring's history and symbolism\n\nRing Day\n\nStudents receive their Aggie Rings at a special celebration called Aggie Ring Day. Three times a year, thousands of Aggies, family and friends gather at the Clayton W. Williams, Jr. Alumni Center to celebrate an academic milestone by receiving their Aggie Rings.\n\nDuring this celebration, Aggies can enjoy various festivities on the Alumni Center grounds, including taking professional photos at different landmarks, watching student group performances and more.\n\nLearn more about Ring Day\n\nRing Dance\n\nSince its creation in 1936, Ring Dance has come to be as much a part of Aggieland as the many older traditions that have existed as long as the school itself. This dance, held in honor of the senior class, will be for many students the last social function of their time at Texas A&M.\n\nLearn more about Ring Dance"
