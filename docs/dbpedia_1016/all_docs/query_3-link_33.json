        "text": "For other uses, see Droid Army.\n\nThe Separatist Droid Army, otherwise referred to as the CIS droid army, Separatist Army, or the droid army, served as the ground forces for the Confederacy of Independent Systems' military during the course of the Clone Wars. Primarily constructed by the workers of Baktoid Combat Automata, the droid army was very largest of its kind in galactic history. The army was led by Kaleesh cyborg General Grievous, who held the title of Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies, while also being commanded by Separatist leader Count Dooku. The Separatist Droid Army was more numerous than the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic. In addition, the droid army received additional reinforcements throughout the war, such as in 21 BBY, when they requested a supplemental amount of three million battle droids with financial assistance from the InterGalactic Banking Clan.\n\nFor three years, the Separatist Droid Army, with transportation from the Confederacy of Independent Systems Navy, engaged in open warfare with the Grand Army of the Republic on many fronts throughout the galaxy, first coming face-to-face on the planet Geonosis. However, by the third year of the war, the Confederacy and its droid armies had suffered extensive losses to the Republic in the Outer Rim Sieges, and was later deactivated in totality at the immediate end of the war following the deaths of the Confederacy's leadership. Despite the Separatist Droid Army's deactivation and the rise of the Galactic Empire under the command of Galactic Emperor Sheev Palpatine, who had orchestrated the war, elements of the droid army remained active several years after the end of the Clone Wars, although these small groups of Separatist holdouts, which were primarily formed from still-active battle droids, were hunted by the Empire following its rise.\n\nOrganization[]\n\nAdministration[]\n\nThe Separatist Droid Army, otherwise known as the Separatist Army, was commanded by the Head of State of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Count Dooku, who was responsible for administering the day-to-day operations of the entire Confederacy military and thereby the droid army. In addition, the army was placed under the command of the Supreme Martial Commander of the Separatist Droid Armies, the Kaleesh cyborg General Grievous, whose responsibilities were to manage the logistics and tactics for the entire army.[3]\n\nDooku and Grievous were also supplemented by several handpicked generals drawn from the ranks of the Confederacy's member worlds, all of whom served under Grievous's command. Furthermore, while the defense of vital resources and strategic locations from the Galactic Republic fell to the droid army, several of the Confederacy's aligned worlds were known to manage individualized defense.[3]\n\nOrder of battle[]\n\nOverview[]\n\nIn the initial days of the Confederacy, the Separatist Army featured an assortment of forces provided to them from several of the conglomerates that support the Confederacy and its movement. While the army's forces were supplied from the Trade Federation, the Techno Union, the Commerce Guild, the Corporate Alliance, the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and the Retail Caucus, the uniform army of B-series battle droids[3] and other battle droid models were constructed from the workers of several manufacturing companies, including Baktoid Combat Automata.[20]\n\nFurthermore, the public goals of the Confederacy and thereby the Separatist Droid Army were two-fold. The first of its goals were to defend the planets that declared an independent state from the Republic. Second, the Confederacy sought to surround and therefore overwhelm the Core Worlds and deprive it of vital trade from the rest of the galaxy. Moreover, the leaders of the Confederacy possessed a belief that the assurance of proper negotiations were capable through the means of successfully blockading a planet of interest, in which would allow the government to conduct the desired negotiations of the government's terms of independence with the Republic from a position of strength.[3]\n\nStructure[]\n\nAlthough the bulk of the entire Separatist Army[3] and the army infantry corps[13] consisted of models from the B-series battle droid line, with defense forces that were often relied on as the front line of defense for their respective worlds. The security defenses of the Confederacy's supporting corporations were also known to provide support to the government's affiliated planets.[3]\n\nMade up of billions of battle droids,[14] the Separatists' ground forces comprised the largest amount of droids ever fielded, though not as numerous as the droids on Geonosis. Factional forces were also deployed on personally led special missions by the members of the Confederacy's legislative Executive Separatist Council or their trusted allies. These faction-based forces included the Trade Federation Home Defense Legions[3] and Trade Federation Droid Army,[18] Techno Union Droid Army, Commerce Guild Punitive Security Forces, Corporate Alliance Policy Administration Directorate, InterGalactic Banking Clan Collections and Security Division,[3] and the private droid army of the Retail Caucus.[17]\n\nPersonnel[]\n\nCommand[]\n\nWhile the Separatist Droid Army maintained a low cost per unit and surpassed the Grand Army of the Republic in their numbers, battle droids possessed limited intelligence and autonomy. However, to supplant their shortfall, Separatist leader Count Dooku courted experienced leaders from the Confederacy's member worlds to command the droid army, all of whom were placed under the command of General Grievous, who served as the leader for the droid army.[3]\n\nSuch leaders included Neimoidian General Lok Durd, an overfed arms developer who used his position as a general to initiate field tests for prototype weapons and General Horn Ambigene, a rugged individualist who led an anti-Republic militia for decades prior to the outbreak of the Clone Wars. Another leader included General Kleeve, a prominent Devaronian Separatist leader whose talent was dealing in bounty hunters and mercenaries to complete his objectives. Other officers were General Oro Dassyne,[3] the Kerkoiden General Whorm Loathsom,[7] and the Karkarodon Commander Riff Tamson, who was responsible for leading the droid army on aquatic planets.[3]\n\nHowever, despite organic leaders being preferred, the Confederacy did not maintain enough competent commanders to lead all their forces. Instead, the government and its forces relied on droid commanders to lead their soldiers. Modified B1 droid commanders, which bore yellow markings, were responsible for leading units below the strength of a regiment, while probability-obsessed T-series military strategic analysis and tactics droids commanded larger units assigned to their missions.[3] The Separatist Droid Army also employed ST-series military strategic analysis and tactics droid, highly intelligent droids who were capable of conducting military operations without direction from a superior officer.[21]\n\nSoldiers[]\n\nThroughout its operational history, the Separatist Droid Army incorporated and deployed a wide variety of different battle droid models against the clone armies of the Republic during the war.[1] Among the most common battle droid employed in the Separatist Army was the B1-series battle droid,[22] which included several different variants, such as the 631 model B1 battle droid,[23] the B1 grapple droid,[24] the Heavy Battle Droid,[25] the B1-series rocket battle droid,[26] the grenade droid,[27] the AAT Driver Battle Droid,[28] which also served as a battle droid for jungle operations,[25] the B1 recon droid, the B1 repeater blaster droid, the B1 rocket launcher droid,[24] the B1 supervisor droid,[29] the firefighter battle droid,[26] E-5C B1 Trooper, E-5s B1 Trooper, E-60R B1 Trooper,[30] and the OOM-series battle droid. The OOM-series also consisted of three different variants, which included the OOM command battle droid, distinct by its yellow markings, the OOM pilot battle droid, and the OOM-series security droid.[2]\n\nAnother droid model that actively saw use by the droid army was the B2-series super battle droid,[1] which also had several different variants. These variants included the B2-ACM Trooper,[31] the B2-HA series super battle droid, which were capable of leading other droids in battle,[28] the B2 grapple droid,[32] the B2-RP super battle droid[33] and its successor the B2 super rocket trooper.[34] In addition to the B1 and B2 battle droids, the Separatist Army also made use of droidekas,[1] which were constructed by Colicoid Creation Nest[35] and used to overwhelm enemies, such as Jedi.[7] Droidekas also consisted of different variants, including the Droideka Sharpshooter,[36] and the W-series and Q-series droidekas.[37] The Droideka Oppressor variant was designed for use in the Clone Wars but, due to when it was developed, never ended up seeing use due to the conflict coming to its end.[38]\n\nProvided to the Confederacy's cause by the Banking Clan, which pledged their droid army to the Confederacy,[3] IG-series battle droids saw extensive use throughout the entire Clone Wars, with the chrome-plated battle droids seeing deployments in phalanxes across several battlefields.[39] The IG-100 MagnaGuard was one of several IG-series droids used by the Separatist Army during the war.[2] The presence of MagnaGuards typically indicated that high-ranking officers were also present, which gave MagnaGuards immediate authority over all other units.[20] Other IG-series units deployed by the droid army were the IG lancer droid, which saw service as front line defenders for worlds of the Banking Clan,[3] and the IG-86 sentinel droid.[40]\n\nThe Separatist Droid Army also incorporated several other models of battle droids, each of which were designed to serve a specific purpose.[41] The AQ-series battle droid manufactured by Haor Chall Engineering Corporation[42] was a battle droid model used by the Separatist Army, and were used to supplant land-based droid forces on aquatic battlefronts, such as Kamino.[41] Another droid model was the BX-series droid commando, which were designed to fulfill special operations, infiltration missions,[43] or escort members of the Separatist Parliament to other planets during the war.[44] Furthermore, the commando droid captain was a variant of the BX-series droid commando designed to command inferior commando droids, which were distinguishable white markings.[43]\n\nAmong the other various models was the B3 battle droid, which the Separatist Army had favored, alongside the B2-series super battle droid, above the expensive and complex E522 assassin droid.[45][46] Two other models of battle droids were the C-8 saboteur droid, an advanced model of battle droid designed to conduct espionage and sabotage missions, in which saw them deployed in small, independent squads,[3] and the Pistoeka sabotage droid[2] manufactured by the Colicoids,[20] where they were used by the Confederacy and the Separatist Droid Army to disable enemy war craft. There was also the Colicoids Infiltrator-series droid.[2] Other models incorporated into the droid army were the LR-57 combat/retail droid,[7] which saw initial use in the private army of the Retail Caucus,[47] the chameleon droid,[48] the spelunker probe droid,[3] and PK-series worker droid,[49] a model of labor droid[3] initially stationed aboard the Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighters of the Trade Federation fleet[50] but saw later use within the Separatist Army for several support functions.[3]\n\nEquipment[]\n\nIn order to openly engage the Grand Army of the Republic, the Separatist Droid Army possessed and wielded a vast array of different weapons throughout its operational history. E-5 blaster rifles, a type of reverse-engineered blaster rifle design from BlasTech Industries, was a weapon that proved to be more than sufficient for Separatist droids,[20] such as standard battle droids and droid commandos,[43] as the weapon generated excessive amounts of heat when in use, which thereby made the E-5 uncomfortable for organic soldiers.[20]\n\nAnother weapon that saw frequent use by the droid army were wrist blasters, a model of wrist-mounted blaster that was primarily used by B2-series super battle droids,[1] as well as the E-5s sniper rifle and RG-4D, a model of blaster pistol that saw use by the army's B1 droid commanders.[25] Separatist droids also made use of J-10 dual blaster cannons, a type of blaster cannon that was essentially a pair of scaled-up reciprocating E-5 blaster rifles. However, the J-10 saw rare deployments throughout the war due to its many drawbacks.[51] The DDC-MR6 modular rifle was designed for the Separatists but, due to its high cost, only a prototype run of the weapon was used before the Confederacy moved onto cheaper weapons instead.[52]\n\nTo accommodate their blasters, the Separatist Droid Army also incorporated and deployed an array of melee weaponry used by their forces. Vibroblades, a type of bladed knife, often saw use by the army's commando droids, while the electrostaff, a weapon capable of engaging a lightsaber, was typically carried and wielded by IG-100 MagnaGuards.[2] The droid army also employed a variety of different explosive weaponry, which included the Sienar Fleet Systems-manufactured[3] RPS-6 rocket launcher,[53] the remote operated thermal annihilator bomb,[36] Class-A thermal detonators,[43] and precision laser darts.[54]\n\nFurthermore, the droid army also made use of several different pieces of equipment. Separatist droids, such as OOM command battle droids and oftentimes standard battle droids used macrobinoculars in order to locate far-away enemies. Personal energy shields were also used within the Separatist Army by its unit of BX-series droid commandos stationed at the Citadel on the planet Lola Sayu.[55] Moreover, comlink booster packs were another piece of technological equipment that saw extensive use by the B1 battle droids of the droid army,[2] while firefighter battle droids, a variant of the B1 battle droid stationed aboard starships of the Confederacy's naval branch, came equipped with fire hoses and enhanced thermal shielding in order to eliminate any and all fires that took place aboard their stationed vessels.[56]\n\nIn order to protect their facilities[57] and ground forces, the Separatist Army utilized military-grade deflector shield generators,[7] oftentimes using generator models of the KR series.[57] While certain droids within the Separatist Army were painted in order to distinguish their position, such as the yellow-painted OOM command battle droids,[7] the army's organic officers adorned white and grey uniforms that bore the hex emblem of the Confederacy on the sleeves and were given a single blaster pistol as a means of protecting themselves.[29]\n\nVehicles and machinery[]\n\nIn addition to its plethora of different weapons and infantry units, the Separatist Droid Army utilized a variety of ground assault vehicles, as well as machinery. From the start of the war, the Separatist Army made use of Armored Assault Tank Mk Is.[7] Initially used by the Trade Federation army,[50] the Armored Assault Tank served as one of the army's backdone infantry defenses and vehicles that saw frequent use throughout the entire war on several battlefronts. The droid army also utilized Defoliator Deployment Tanks, a modified variant of the Armored Assault Tank created by General Lok Durd that was armed with a turret-mounted missile launcher designed to fire defoliator shells.[4]\n\nAnother ground assault vehicle used by the Separatist Army was the super tank, an experimental tank equipped with heavy armor and a ray shield powerful enough to withstand the firepower of several Republic AV-7 Anti-vehicle Artillery Cannons at once.[58] One other tank in the Separatist Droid Army was the large seismic tank.[59]\n\nAlongside their various models of tanks, the Separatist Droid Army's ground vehicles also consisted of an arsenal of different droid vehicles. Supplied by the Commerce Guild's private security forces,[3] the DSD1 dwarf spider droid was utilized by the Confederacy's ground forces since the outbreak of the war,[1] which resulted in it becoming a mainstay in the Separatist Army[20] throughout the remainder of the conflict.[2] Additionally, the Separatist forces also employed OG-9 homing spider droids,[1] a large tank-like walker initially used by the Commerce Guild[60] that served as the heavy tank variety of spider droid, while the dwarf spider droid fulfilled an antipersonnel role.[17]\n\nMoreover, the Separatist Army deployed IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks, a model of droid tank supplied by the InterGalactic Banking Clan's droid army,[3] who initially used it for the intended purpose of debt collection,[61] that saw minimal use in the Confederacy's ground forces despite its powerful prescience in battle as a result of its limited complement of missiles.[62] As a replacement for the hailfire droid,[60] the Separatist Droid Army incorporated Corporate Alliance NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcers, a model of droid tank that maintained an extensive armament[20][17] and saw continued use throughout the war.[2]\n\nFurthermore, the Separatist Droid Army used Harvesters, a model of droid walker designed to harvest the plant life on planets.[63] Supplied by the Techno Union, the Separatist ground forces also utilized LM-432 crab droids, a type of four-legged droid walker that was primarily designed for navigating swampy environments, at which they excelled. These walkers maintained consistent contact with their commanders and came in various sizes.[20] Octuptarra tri-droids were also frequently utilized by the Separatist Army on various battlefronts throughout the war.[2] The larger and more lethal counterpart of the DSD1, octuptarra tri-droids were almost incapable of being caught off guard due to their lack of blind spots. They also came in two different sized models, the agile[64] octuptarra combat tri-droid,[65] and the gigantic[64] octuptarra magna tri-droid,[65] which saw use as combat artillery on the battlefield.[64]\n\nIn addition to their plethora of ground assault vehicles, the Separatist Army incorporated several different models of transportation vehicles for the purpose of moving and deploying their troops in high numbers.[2] Manufactured by Baktoid Armor Workshop[20] and initially used by the Trade Federation Droid Army,[50] the Multi-Troop Transport was a model of heavy repulsorlift vehicle designed to transport battle droids to the battlefield or cargo, but was also used as both a tank and siege ram.[3] The Platoon Attack Craft,[2] another transport that initially saw use by the Trade Federation, was a repulsorlift vehicle[2] capable of carrying many battle droids to a designated area.[66] Moreover, the Separatist Army also employed the XT Beetle Transport, a model of transport that was originally used by the Trade Federation army and moved on ten pairs of mechanized legs. XT Beetle Transports were capable of being bundled together by cables in order to form an outpost for operations conducted by the Confederacy's ground forces.[67]\n\nSpeeders and other repulsorcraft also composed parts of the Droid Army, with ground forces making use of the Single Trooper Aerial Platform,[7] airspeeders,[68] the and the Flitknot Speeder Bike.[1] The combat speeder[69] and the TSMEU-6 personal wheel bike were used by General Grievous,[2] and the Separatist Droid Army also possessed artillery pieces, which consisted of the the J-1 proton cannon,[11] the Geonosian LR1K sonic cannon.[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigins[]\n\nDuring the Separatist Crisis, Count Dooku's emerging Separatist movement, the Confederacy of Independent Systems, secretly began manufacturing the largest droid army in galactic history on the planet Geonosis[1] in stark defiance of Republic laws.[70] The Separatist movement was supported by the Trade Federation, the Commerce Guild, the Techno Union, the InterGalactic Banking Clan, and the Corporate Alliance. The massive droid army was discovered by Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose capture triggered an attack by the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic's new Grand Army of the Republic, which had been commissioned by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. The outbreak of the Clone Wars played into the hands of Darth Sidious,[1] who masterminded the conflict while simultaneously serving as Supreme Chancellor of the Republic.[2]\n\n22 BBY[]\n\nFollowing the Battle of Geonosis[71] in 22 BBY,[19] the Separatist Droid Army saw action against the Jedi and the Grand Army of the Republic on numerous fronts and worlds across the galaxy including Hissrich,[71] Christophsis,[7] Ryloth,[33] Maridun,[4] and Felucia.[72] On Maridun, Separatist droid forces led by Lok Durd attempted to test the Defoliator weapon on Lurmen migrants but were repelled by the Republic and Jedi led by Jedi General Aayla Secura, General Anakin Skywalker, Commander Ahsoka Tano, Commander Bly, and Captain Rex.[4]\n\nLater, General Grievous, was ambushed by Jedi and Republic forces led by General Kit Fisto. Grievous survived the attack and Fisto was forced to flee. The ambush was a test engineered by Dooku to test Grievous' worthiness to lead the Droid Army.[53] Elements of the Droid Army also guarded Separatist scientist Nuvo Vindi's secret laboratory on Neimoidia, which manufactured stockpiles of the deadly Blue Shadow Virus.[73] On Ryloth, Separatist droid occupation forces faced resistance from Cham Syndulla's Twi'lek Resistance, who continued to combat the droid army until the end of the Separatist occupation.[74]\n\n21 BBY[]\n\nBy 21 BBY,[19] the Separatists had occupied Florrum and Poggle the Lesser begun producing more battle droids for the Droid Army. In response, the Republic sent a force led by Jedi Generals Ki-Adi-Mundi, Kenobi, Luminara Unduli, and Skywalker to r clear out the planet of droids, culminating in the Second Battle of Geonosis.[75] Following fierce fighting, the Republic succeeded in destroying the primary droid foundry,[58] killing Karina the Great, and capturing Poggle the Lesser, dealing a major blow to the Separatists.[76]\n\nAfter General Grievous kidnapped Jedi Master Eeth Koth,[77] the Jedi and clone troopers pursued the Supreme Commander and his contingent of battle droids to Saleucami. Despite sustaining heavy casualties to his forces, the droid general eluded capture.[78] The Droid Army later invaded the Dug homeworld of Malastare in an attempt to cut off the Republic's supply of fuel. Separatist droid forces were disabled by the detonation of an electro-proton bomb, but the bomb awoke a powerful prehistoric creature known as the Zillo Beast.[79]\n\nSeparatist forces under General Grievous and Sith assassin Asajj Ventress later attacked the cloning facilities on Kamino in an attempt to disrupt the production of clone troopers. During the battle, the Separatist forces included AQ-series battle droids and aquatic Trident-class assault ships. Despite a vigorous attack, the Separatist were repelled by clone and Jedi defenders.[41]\n\nAs part of a conspiracy to derail Separatist Senator Mina Bonteri and Republic Senator Padmé Amidala's efforts to forge a peace agreement between the two states, Count Dooku and General Grievous dispatched demolition droids to bomb Coruscant's Central power distribution grid; undermining Bonteri and Amidala's efforts to seek a diplomatic solution to the Clone Wars.[80] Not long after the Separatists ordered an additional three million battle droids with financial backing by the InterGalactic Banking Clan.[15]\n\n20 BBY[]\n\nIn 20 BBY,[19] Separatist Droid Army forces under the Karkarodon Commander Riff Tamson joined forces with the Quarren Isolation League and their Quarren warriors to oppose the succession of the Mon Calamari Prince Lee-Char, who was backed by the Republic and Jedi. During the Battle of Mon Cala, the Separatists deployed AQ-series battle droids and Hydroid Medusas against the Mon Calamari and Republic, who were forced to retreat from Mon Cala city.[10] Tamson's Trident assault ships later neutralized Gungan reinforcements led by Jar Jar Binks.[81] Despite capturing most of the opposing Republic and Mon Calamari forces including Prince Lee-Char, the Separatist forces were defeated when the Quarren leader Nossor Ri convinced his people to unite with the Mon Calamari and Republic to expel Tamson's droid forces.[82]\n\nCount Dooku later attempted to forge an alliance with the Gungans using his local collaborator Rish Loo, who bewitched Boss Lyonie. This Separatist plot was foiled by Binks and Roos Tarpals, who succeeded in capturing General Grievous. However, the Gungans and Neimoidia were forced to release the Separatist Droid General when Dooku threatened to execute General Skywalker.[83] Later, the Droid Army invaded the Togruta colony of Kiros and sold the colonists as slaves to the Zygerrian Slave Empire.[36] General Grievous subsequently commanded the Droid Army's attack against the Nightsisters of Dathomir, whom Count Dooku regarded as a growing threat to the Sith. During the assault, Grievous slew Mother Talzin while the droids killed many Nightsisters.[84]\n\nDuring the Onderonian Civil War, Separatist droid forces under the super tactical droid General Kalani later propped up the pro-Separatist regime of King Sanjay Rash of Onderon in the Inner Rim.[5] King Rash and his Separatist backers were opposed by the insurgent Onderon rebels led by Saw Gerrera and his sister Steela, who were aided by the Jedi and the Republic.[85] After winning the support of the rightful King Ramsis Dendup[86] and General Akenathen Tandin,[87] the Onderon rebels succeeded in expelling Separatist forces from Onderon. Separatist droid forces were also attacked by the local population in the capital Iziz. General Kalani and the surviving droids retreated to the Outer Rim planet Agamar.[86]\n\nIn retaliation for the Ohnaka Gang's mistreatment of Count Dooku years earlier, Separatist droid forces under General Grievous attacked Hondo Ohnaka's pirate base on Florrum and laid waste to it. Tano and six Jedi younglings fought against Grievous and his forces but were forced to retreat.[69]\n\n19 BBY[]\n\nIn 19 BBY,[19] elements of the Droid Army under Admiral Trench engaged in the Battle of Ringo Vinda Under orders from Dooku they attempted to kidnap clone trooper \"Tup,\" whose inhibitor chip had malfunctioned and caused him to kill Jedi Master Tiplar. The Separatist was foiled by General Skywalker, Captain Rex, and ARC trooper \"Fives,\" who rescued Tup from Commander Kraken's shuttle.[34] After Count Dooku pressured Rush Clovis, the new head of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, to raise interest rates on the Republic, Separatist droid forces attacked Clone Commander Thorn's forces on Scipio. When the Galactic Senate voted to invade Scipio, Dooku promptly withdrew Separatist forces from the planet. The capture of Scipio gave the Supreme Chancellor control over the banks; placing the galactic economy under the control of the Sith.[88]\n\nLater, two of Grievous' IG-100 MagnaGuards assassinated Jedi Master Tu-Anh on the neutral world of Utapau.[89] While investigating Tu-Anh's death, Master Kenobi and Jedi Knight Skywalker fought the two MagnaGuards and discovered that the Separatists were interested in acquiring a large kyber crystal through several Sugi mercenaries led by Endente.[54] After Kenobi and Skywalker stole the crystal, General brought some droid forces, including some of his MagnaGuards, to recover the crystal.[90] Despite Grievous evacuating the kyber crystal off world, the Jedi managed to destroy the crystal and the Separatist supply ship it was in, the resulting explosion destroying the Separatist fleet around the planet.[91]\n\nAfter escaping from the Spire prison, Maul's Shadow Collective inflicted heavy casualties on the Droid Army at the Battle of Zanbar before retreating.[92] The Shadow Collective later lured Count Dooku and General Grievous into a trap on Ord Mantell. Separatist ground and space forces were decimated during the battle and the two Separatist leaders were captured by Maul and his allies.[32] Maul's Shadow Collective was later defeated by Separatist forces with the help of Darth Sidious at Dathomir.[93]\n\nThe Separatist Droid Army also fought an extended campaign against the Republic on Anaxes, a world that held vital Republic shipyards.[68] Admiral Trench was aided by the Techno Union's Foreman Wat Tambor who used an unconscious clone trooper \"Echo\" to provide the Separatists with an algorithm on the Republic's strategies.[94] Echo was rescued by Clone Force 99, General Skywalker, and Rex who fought Tambor's D1-series aerial battle droids and octuptarra tri-droids with the help of the Poletecs of Skako Minor.[95] With the help of Echo, Skywalker and the clones infiltrated Trench's flagship and disabled his droid army on Anaxes, turning the tide of the battle in favor of the Republic.[96]\n\nFollowing the death of Count Dooku at the Battle of Coruscant, the Separatist Droid Army battled the Grand Army of the Republic on numerous fronts including Kashyyyk, Utapau, Saleucami, Mygeeto, Felucia,[2] and Kaller.[6] These battles coincided with Palpatine's initiation of Order 66, which led to the Great Jedi Purge. Palpatine than transformed the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire. Palpatine then sent his new apprentice Anakin Skywalker, who had assumed the persona of Darth Vader, to execute the Separatist Council on Mustafar. Vader also transmitted a signal destroying the Droid Army, ending the Clone Wars.[2]\n\nLegacy[]\n\nDespite the destruction of the Separatist Droid Army, its legacy still lived on in battle droids that survived the Clone Wars. After the Clones Wars various Separatist holdouts survived and attempted to fight the Empire.[97] Nevertheless, the Empire ordered all surviving battle droids to be shot on sight[21] and destroyed.[98] Though the IG-series battle droids that had been used the CIS were assigned this fate, the efforts of the Droid Gotra spared many.[39] By the Imperial Era, the gotra was made up of surviving battle droids[97] that sought to fight for droid rights.[39]\n\nDuring the Imperial Era, a group of battle droids under the leadership of General Kalani inhabited the wreckage of a DH-Omni Support Vessel on the planet Agamar. Believing the destruction signal was a Republic trick, Kalani had overridden the command signal, preventing the shutdown of his droid forces.[21] In 2 BBY, he encountered the former Clone Captain Rex, the Jedi Purge survivor Kanan Jarrus, and his Padawan Ezra Bridger. Still refusing the way the Clone Wars had ended, Kalani organized a final battle with his prisoners. The rebels managed to break through Kalani's lines and Ezra managed to convince Kalani and Rex to put aside their differences in order to escape Imperial forces. This cooperation informally ended the Clone Wars and allowed Rex and Kalani and his droids to make peace with the past.[21]\n\nAnother holdout during the reign of the Galactic Empire was the holdout on PM-6986, led by JF-86. After the Battle for Anaxes and a cataclysm that destroyed the planet, a droid army survived on a Separatist stronghold on what would become the planetoid PM-6986. Awoken by a Separatist signal that originated light-years away, JF-86 proceeded to reactivate the rest of the droid army. Following its last orders, JF-86 sought to destroy the Galactic Senate of the Republic, unaware of the events in the galaxy and the transformation of the Republic into the Empire. JF-86 was not able to carry out its plan however, as it possessed no starships to ferry its troops, and as such, was forced to remain on the planetoid, waiting for an opportunity.[100]\n\nGroups[]\n\nArmies[]\n\nIG-series battle droid army[3]\n\nTrench's army[96]\n\nVentress's army[28]\n\nWhorm Loathsom's army[7]\n\nLegions[]\n\nRiff Tamson's legion[10]\n\nUnidentified battle droid legion[1]\n\nGarrisons[]\n\nHorain garrison[101]\n\nBattalions[]\n\nTJ-55's battle droid battalion[102]\n\nUnidentified droid battalion[68]\n\nPlatoons[]\n\n4-A7's battle droid platoon[7]\n\nUnidentified Separatist platoon[68]\n\nSquads[]\n\nPatrol 118[5]\n\nSquad One[4]\n\nSquad Two[4]\n\nSquad Three[4]\n\nTeam Three[57]\n\nTeam Four[57]\n\nUnidentified droid patrol[74]\n\nUnspecified[]\n\nHissrich droid unit[71]\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nThe Separatist Droid Army first appeared in the 2002 feature film Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.[1]\n\nIn the Star Wars: The Clone Wars episode \"Duel of the Droids,\" a new model of B1 battle droid was planned to be introduced known as Red Shoulders, but was cut from the episode.[103]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nNon-canon appearances[]\n\nLEGO STAR WARS: Celebrate the Season — \"All I Want For Life Day\"\n\nStar Wars: Visions — \"The Village Bride\" (Ambiguous canonicity)\n\nLEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga\n\n\"Stepping Up\" — LEGO Star Wars 109\n\nSources[]\n\nNotes and references[]"
