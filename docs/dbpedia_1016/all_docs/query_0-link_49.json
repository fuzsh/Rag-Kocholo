Each country has its own unique history of computer games. Among them, Japanese computer games were strongly inﬂuenced by the USA in the early days of the industry, but they escaped from its inﬂuence much earlier than in other countries. In addition, Japan differed signiﬁcantly from the USA and Europe in its industrial development path and game culture, as evidenced by the fact that arcade games, which have declined in other countries, are still alive and well today, and that Japan has its own unique game genres, such as JRPG1 and visual novels. This book outlines the history of computer games in Japan from the perspective of industrial history. The English translation was based on the expanded and revised edition published in 2020, which differs in several respects. • As a prehistory of the history of the Japanese game industry, Chapter 2 in the Japanese edition covers the period from the birth of computer games to the collapse of the US market (Crash of 1983, often referred to as Atari Shock2 in Japan). However, since this information is not new and is well-known in Englishspeaking countries, it was deleted. Therefore, the chapters after Chap. 3 are one chapter different between the Japanese and English versions. • Statistics within the last chapter were added up to the latest possible date. Minimal additions were made to the PS5 and Xbox Series X, which could not\n\nOn the birth of JRPG, see Koyama “Evolution of a Genre: Dragon Quest and the JRPG”, RACHAEL HUTCHINSON AND JÉRÉMIE PELLETIER-GAGNON (ed), Japanese Role-Playing Games Genre, Representation, and Liminality in the JRPG, Lexington Books, p19– 38,22022. 2 In Japan, when some major event occurs that has a signiﬁcant impact on industry, it is often named XX shock. Past examples include the Nixon Shock, when the U.S. stopped exchanging gold for dollars in 1971; the Oil Shock, the oil crisis that accompanied the Fourth Middle East War in 1973; and the Lehman Shock, the ﬁnancial crisis from 2007 to 2010. 1\n\nv\n\nvi\n\nPreface\n\nbe described because the situation was in ﬂux at the time of the expanded and revised edition in Japan. • The supplemental discussion in the expanded and revised edition was removed. The six topics discussed in the supplemental essay were cloud gaming, VR, disease recognition of gaming disorders, the root box issue, the development of e-sports, and the expansion of video game viewing and distribution. We hope that you will read this article with an understanding of these differences.

It also classiﬁes the companies that are the players in the history of the game industry and describes their principles of action. The chapter then outlines the characteristics of the three markets discussed in the ﬁrst half of the book (PC, arcade, and home video game consoles) and the path of performance growth for each platform up to the 1990s. Keywords History of Video Game Industry · Dawn · 2Dera · 3D era · Handheld era · Smartphone era\n\n1.1\n\nWhat Is the History of the Game Industry?\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear the words “history of games1“? It may be the history of hit titles such as Space Invaders, Dragon Quest, and Final Fantasy, or home video game console such as the Famicom (Nintendo Entertainment System), Super Famicom (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), and PlayStation. It could be game companies such as Nintendo, Sega, Namco, and Konami. In any case, if the title “history” is used, it is important to present the events of the past in an organized manner from a clear perspective, rather than simply listing past events or talking about the past. The following are some of the ways to look at the history of games. • The history of technology, which describes the development and changes in the technology used in games. • The history of game design or game genres, which describes the birth and differentiation of game genres and their development within each genre. • Social history, which describes the way games are accepted and consumed in society.\n\n1 Strictly speaking, the term “game” includes so-called “non-powered games” such as card games and board games, but in this book, unless otherwise speciﬁed, it refers to digital games.\n\n© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023 Y. Koyama, History of the Japanese Video Game Industry, Translational Systems Sciences 35, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-1342-8_1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\nHistory of the Game Industry\n\n• Industrial history, which describes the development of industries related to games and the nature of competition. This book deals with the history of the part of the industrial history of games in Japan. In other words, it focuses on the activities of various companies that aimed to make continuous proﬁts and keep their business entities alive, how consumers responded to these activities, and what results they continued to produce. Game titles themselves and the fun of games will be discussed only when they relate to the core of the industry. Therefore, readers who like games may often ﬁnd that “that title is not covered.” Of course, in order to describe the industrial history, it is not enough to simply follow the activities of the companies. The game industry itself was born from the accidental success of a game called PONG developed by Atari. Since then, the industry structure has undergone major changes triggered by blockbuster titles. The industry has also experienced changes in business styles and product (i.e., game) trends due to legal restrictions and social opposition. Like other industries, it has also been affected by the improvement of computer performance and the expansion of the Internet. The history of the game industry is not completely independent of the history of games from other perspectives. The relationship with game history from other perspectives is as follows: 1. When looking at games from the perspective of industrial history, the perspectives of technological history, management history, and social history are indispensable in addition to the perspective of game history. 2. From the perspective of business history, “coevolution among multiple markets,” “establishment of intellectual property rights,” “struggle for de facto standards,” and “changes in the external environment” are important. 3. From the perspective of technological history, the transition and application of technological paradigms are important. These include the shift from electric to electronic, and electronic to computerized machines at the dawn of time, the shift from 2D to 3D, from CISC to RISC, and from machine language (assembler) to high-level language in the late 1990s, and the shift to online and the use of middleware in the twenty-ﬁrst century. 4. The game industry has been viewed as a problem by society many times, and each time it has made efforts to recover its image. From the viewpoint of social history, the acceptance, tolerance, and establishment of games in society are very important. This includes “juvenile delinquency and the application of Act on Control and Improvement of Amusement Business,” “the gambling machine problem,” “the Saori Incident,” “game addiction,” and “the problem of excessive charges in social games.” Some of the contents listed here will be discussed in later chapters, but “coevolution among multiple markets” needs to be explained in this chapter as a viewpoint for looking at the entire history of the game industry. There are many studies on the game industry that focus only on the home video game industry. However, Space Invaders, which established the game industry in Japan, was an arcade game, and\n\n1.2\n\nHistorical Classiﬁcation of the Game Industry: Overview of Industry History\n\n3\n\nRPGs (role playing games), a hot-selling genre of home console games, were originally created as games for PCs. In the early days, the home game market was a market for arcade games or PC games that were ported and sold to make another proﬁt with the same title. As time progressed, the home video game market became more independent and unique, but the situation where experimental titles were ﬁrst released in arcades and PCs, and home video game consoles were inﬂuenced by them, continued for a long time. The mutual inﬂuence and coevolution among the three markets continued until the late 1990s, when online games and mobile phone games emerged as new markets with the spread of the Internet. Since then, the relationship between the ﬁve markets has been one of mutual inﬂuence.\n\n1.2\n\nHistorical Classiﬁcation of the Game Industry: Overview of Industry History\n\nAs is common in any industry, when an industry is launched, it is not known what the target will be, and all sorts of companies (or individuals) ﬂock to it because they see a business opportunity. Eventually, the standard form of the industry (business model) begins to form. If we call the period until the standard form of an industry is established the dawn period, then each market has its own dawn period. For arcades, Taito’s Space Invaders appeared in 1978 (Chap. 2); for PCs, the “8-bit trinities” (NEC’s PC-8801, Fujitsu’s FM-7, and Sharp’s X1), which enjoyed a large share of the domestic market, came out in 1982 (Chap. 3); and for home video game consoles, Nintendo’s Family Computer was released in 1983 (Chap. 4). As for online games, Pre-Internet online communication gradually spread from the latter half of the 1980s, but it did not connect well with the game business and did not take root as a business. In the end, online games could not escape the dawn of the Pre-Internet online communication era and ﬁnally took root in the Internet era (Chap. 10). As for mobile phone games, the dawn of mobile phone games started in 1999 when NTT DoCoMo launched its i-mode service and continued until 2003 when applications could be launched directly on the mobile phone OS and QVGA (320 × 200 pixels) or higher resolution became the standard for mobile phone LCDs (Chap. 14). As an indication of the structure of this book, Fig. 1.1 shows the time period classiﬁcation of the game industry. Each period is named after the market (platform) that had a central position at that time. The ﬁrst period, the arcade era, lasted until 1983, when three markets were established. The other two markets appeared at the end of the twentieth century and in the twenty-ﬁrst century. The following terms are used to symbolize each era: 2D era, 3D era, handheld era and smartphone era.\n\n4\n\n1 1971\n\nArcade era 1983\n\n2D era 1994\n\n3D era 2006\n\nHandheld era 2012\n\nSmartphone era\n\nHistory of the Game Industry\n\nBusiness Basics Confirmed • First in the USA, Japan took the lead after the Crash of 1983 • Rougly up to the early 1980s (birth of Famicom) Market Expansion Period • The heyday of 2D graphics • The transition from 8 -bit to 16-bit occurred during this period. Drastic change in industrial structure • The peak of the Japanese game industry & the start of its downfall • Coincided with the spread and establishment of 3D graphics Handheld game consoles become mainstream for home use • Reasons: Soaring development costs and aging users • Social games on mobile phones become a social issue. Changes in the competitive environment • Center of the market: from home use to smartphones • Market relationship: from co -evolution to competition\n\nFig. 1.1 Period classiﬁcation of the game industry\n\nAs in the USA, Japan’s game industry started with arcade games, but the arcade game market weakened due to issues of youth protection and gambling regulations, and the center of the market shifted to home video game consoles. After that, the industry structure remained relatively stable until the major changes in the mid-1990s. In the middle of the 2D era, the mainstream computer architecture shifted from 8- to 16-bit, but the basic structure of the business remained unchanged. In the ﬁrst half of the 1990s, the next generation of technology, 3D graphics (threedimensional graphics), gradually began to be adopted in various markets.2 Although it is difﬁcult to clearly deﬁne the time period, this book deﬁnes the 2D era as the period up to 1994, when PlayStation was released (Chaps 2–7). In the mid-1990s, the game industry underwent major changes in both technology and business environment, and home video game consoles became the center of the industry more than ever. In this book, the period from 1994 onward is named the 3D era (3D graphics era) because of the way game screens are created. During this period, not only was game development made more sophisticated by the spread of 3D graphics, but also the business model of games was greatly changed by the spread of disk media (CD-ROM, DVD-ROM) (Chap. 8). This period also coincided with the spread of Internet access and the launch of the online game market. With the As for arcade games, the ﬁrst 3D graphics game board appeared at the Amusement Machine Show (AM Show) in 1992. As for home video game machines, 3DO (1993 in the USA, 1994 in Japan) was released by Matsushita Electric (Panasonic) before PlayStation (1994). For PCs, it is difﬁcult to determine the timing, but a rough estimate is around 1995, when Windows95 was introduced and DirectX technology was installed.\n\n2\n\n1.2\n\nHistorical Classiﬁcation of the Game Industry: Overview of Industry History\n\n5\n\nrelease of PlayStation 3 in 2006, development costs for both hardware and software soared, and the business model came to a standstill. At the same time, the average age of users increased due to the declining birthrate and aging population in Japan, and the majority of users were working adults. As a result, the “long hours in the living room” play style of home game consoles no longer ﬁt the lifestyle of the users. The Nintendo DS and PSP, released in 2004, saved the struggling game industry. In this book, we deﬁne the period up to 2006 as the 3D era. 2006 was also the year when PlayStation 3 was released and also the year when software sales for handheld game consoles exceeded those for stationary game consoles (Chaps. 9–12). Next was the handheld era. The handheld era was short, only a few years, when Nintendo DS and PSP were leading the market. In 2011, the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita were released, however, the shift to smartphones was just around the corner. In the following year, 2012, Puzzle & Dragons, released for smartphones, drastically changed the game market (Chaps. 13 and 14). The period from 2012 to the present is the smartphone era. The most signiﬁcant feature of this period is that the intermarket competition became severe; for PCs, Steam, an online sales platform, became widespread and completely competed with home game consoles. As for handheld devices, smartphones have overwhelmed handheld game consoles (Chap. 15). In addition, there are different generations of home video game consoles depending on the era in which they were released and their technical level. In Japan, because home video games were a form of entertainment imported from overseas, generations of video game consoles prior to the 1983 Family Computer were released in a mixed manner (see Chap. 5). In the USA, on the other hand, there is a clear distinction. Table 1.1 shows the author’s additions to the time classiﬁcation and characteristics in the Encyclopedia of Video Games (2012). Each generation of game consoles was inﬂuenced by computer technology, communication technology, and the business environment. The eighth generation PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have been released with upward compatibility for 4 K (3820 × 2160) screen output; the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One S were released in 2016, and the Xbox One X in 2017. For the sake of convenience, we refer to these as 8.5th generation. Nintendo Switch released in 2017 is a type of game console that can be played both as home and handheld console, while the Switch Lite, a specialized handheld game console, was released in 2019. It is difﬁcult to decide where to classify this as well, but for the time being, it is placed in the ninth generation. The eighth and subsequent generations are still in ﬂux.\n\n6\n\n1\n\nHistory of the Game Industry\n\nTable 1.1 Generation classiﬁcation of home game consoles Epocs Dawn\n\nQuite different between Japan and USA\n\nGeneration 1st 1972–1977\n\n2nd 1976–1984\n\n2D era\n\n8-bit era\n\n3rd 1983–1995\n\n16-bit era\n\n4th 1987–1999\n\n3D era and after\n\n5th 1993–2002 6th 1998–2004\n\n7th 2005–\n\n8th 2012–\n\n8.5th 2016–\n\n9th 2017–\n\nMain model Magnavox Odyssey (1972) Home PONG (1975) Fairchild Channel F (1976) Atari Video Computer System (1977) Family Computer (1983) SG-1000(1983), MarkIII (1985) PC-Engine (1987) Megadrive (1988) Super Famicom (1990) Saturn (1994) PlayStation (1994) Nintendo 64 (1996) Dreamcast (1998) PlayStation 2 (2000) GameCube (2001) Xbox (2002) Xbox 360 (2005) PlayStation 3 (2006) Wii (2006) WiiU (2012) PlayStation 4 (2014) Xbox One (2014) PlayStation4 Pro (2016) Xbox Ons S (2016) Xbox One X (2017) Nintendo Switch (2017) PlayStation 5 (2020) Xbox Series X/S (2020)\n\nCharacteristic Hardware implementation of game with logic circuit\n\nSoftware–Hardware separation CPU + ROM\n\nHardware Scrolling Sprite function\n\n16 bit CPU Increase the number of simultaneous colors Multiple defeated console CD-ROM 3D Graphics Internet connection DVD playback\n\nDownload sales Home server Motion controller HD screen GPU computing Support for streaming game play 4 K compatible\n\nRay tracing\n\n1.3\n\nMarkets in the 2D Era\n\n7\n\nTable 1.2 Characteristics of the market (around the late 1980s)\n\nGraphic Solution Graphic Device Colors Sprite Function Wellplayed Game genre Play Time\n\nSales Form Platform innovation speed\n\n1.3 1.3.1\n\nArcade (Sega System16) 320 × 224\n\nHome console (Family computer) 256 × 240\n\nPC (PC-9801VM) 640 × 400\n\nDedicated CRT\n\nTV\n\nDedicated CRT\n\n4096 colors Up to 128 objects in a screen Can be scaled Genre satisﬁed with short playtime such as action or mahjong\n\n25 in 52 colors Up to 64 objects in a screen and 8 objects in a line Compromise between arcade and PC, but close to arcade\n\n16 in 4096 colors No Sprite Function\n\nExtremely short (3 min per play)\n\nCompromise between arcade and PC\n\nCoin Operation (100 yen per play) Very fast\n\nPackage Sales (About 5000 yen) Signiﬁcant innovation once in a few years\n\nGenre playing for a long time such as simulation, adventure, and role playing Long time Using a recording device (ﬂoppy disk) Package Sales (Up to 10,000 yen) Stagnation for game technology\n\nMarkets in the 2D Era Characteristics of the Three Markets\n\nThe overall characteristics of the game industry in the 2D era are described below. Table 1.23 summarizes the characteristics of the three markets in the latter half of the 1980s, when the differences between them were clear. In the 1980s, computer performance was still low. It was impossible to provide a computer at a realistic price that satisﬁed the requirements of both the PCs, whose primary role was to perform ofﬁce work and scientiﬁc and technical calculations, and the arcade board, whose most important function was to draw beautiful screens for games at high speed. Therefore, each was specialized hardware for its own use. This hardware characteristic determined the characteristics of the games produced. The arcade game is characterized by a short playing time (3 min per play as a rough guide for the ﬁrst play) due to the requirement of the business model to have players pay 100 yen for each play. Therefore, in terms of game design (product characteristics), it is necessary to be able to obtain strong satisfaction in a very short 3 For arcades, we assume Sega’s System 16 (released in 1985), a standard board using Motorola’s MC68000 CPU, which was the mainstream at the time. For home console, we assume Nintendo’s Family Computer (1983), and for PCs, we assume the PC-9801VM (1985), which became the de facto standard after the 8-bit trinities.\n\n8\n\n1\n\nHistory of the Game Industry\n\ntime. This principle has remained unchanged up to now. For this reason, games that require reﬂexes, such as action (ACT), shooting (STG), and ﬁghting games (FTG), have developed. These genres are of the type that requires players to concentrate for a short period of time to defeat enemies or clear stages.4 To meet these requirements, it was important for the computer to be able to (1) draw the screen at high speed and (2) move many characters at the same time. If the screen resolution was too high, the amount of data to be processed at once would increase, so the resolution was about the same as that of analog TV monitors at the time. Instead, the barometer of performance was the number of simultaneous colors on the screen, which was important for drawing characters, and the number of sprites5 that could be displayed on the screen at the same time. The computing performance was not so important. PCs, on the other hand, are used for ofﬁce work such as word processing, programming, and scientiﬁc and technical calculations.6 For this reason, computing performance was important, but high-speed drawing and the number of simultaneous colors on the screen were not so important for normal use. What was important in the PC was the screen resolution, which was necessary to increase the number of characters that could be displayed on the screen. High-resolution display was achieved by using a special monitor with a higher resolution than a TV monitor. Another feature of the PC was that it was equipped with a ﬂoppy disk drive as standard to record daily work.7 PC games and the game market are characterized by the following three points: 1. High-resolution screen, although high-speed rendering is not possible. 2. Data can be recorded. 3. High cost and high user age. These characteristics have led to the development of games for enthusiasts and adults, such as games that allow players to play for a long time while recording the progress of the game, games that display many characters on the screen during the game, games that allow players to appreciate high-resolution still images, and games that take advantage of high-speed computing functions and where the opponent’s\n\n4\n\nLater, table games such as mahjong were added to the game center for businessmen who came to take a break or to adjust their time, but the game design was the same as before: if the player did not win in the ﬁrst round, the game was over. 5 In those days, game consoles used to display small characters superimposed on the background screen that covered the entire screen. The function to do this is called the sprite function. 6 The PCs discussed here are the image of the 8-bit trinities and NEC’s PC-9801 (VM and later), which later became the mainstream of PC games. We exclude inexpensive PCs designed for games, such as MSX, and machines that focus on AV functions rather than corporate ofﬁce processing, such as the X68000 (Sharp) and FM TOWNS (Fujitsu), which appeared at the end of the 2D era. 7 At the beginning of the popularization of PCs, ﬂoppy disk drives were very expensive and were treated as peripherals, but because of their convenience, they came to be built into PCs. Instead of a ﬂoppy disk drive, an analog cassette tape is used to store data. Games for PCs were sold with the game program data recorded on cassette tapes until the early 2D era.\n\n1.3\n\nMarkets in the 2D Era\n\n9\n\nthinking routine is important. The game genres include role playing (RPG), adventure (ADV), and simulation (SLG). Games were sold as packages containing ﬂoppy disks (or cassette tapes) containing game data, and were quite expensive, ranging from about 8000 yen to 10,000 yen per game, reﬂecting the age and income of the purchaser. In the case of home consoles, the launch titles (titles released at the same time as the console) were ports of titles that had become hits in the arcades several years earlier. Home video game consoles are equipped with sprite functions and are similar to the hardware of arcade game machines of 2–3 years ago, which were made cheaper by thoroughly cutting costs through mass production effects. As a result, it was superior to the PC in terms of rendering performance, but inferior in terms of screen resolution, computing power, and memory capacity. In the beginning, most of the games released were of the genres found in arcade games, such as action games, but RPGs and ADV were also released in response to user demand. Games were supplied in the form of ROM cartridges,8 which were characterized by (1) ease of handling even by children, (2) high data transfer speed, and (3) inability to be easily copied. As home video game consoles were positioned as “toys for children,” and the price per game was less than 4000 yen in the 1980s. However, in the 1990s, the production cost of games increased due to the increase in the size of games and the sharp rise in the price of semiconductors at that time, and some games began to be sold for more than 10,000 yen per game.9\n\n1.3.2\n\nCharacteristics of Each Market by Platform Performance\n\nFigure 1.2 shows the performance image of a computer in the 2D period. The horizontal axis shows the computing power and the scale of data that can be handled simultaneously, and the vertical axis shows the drawing performance. An arcade is a machine that specializes in drawing performance and does not have high computing power. On the other hand, the PC specializes in computing power. Since home video 8 In many cases, other control signals also ﬂow through the terminal for the ROM cartridge. Therefore, it is possible to connect peripheral devices through the cartridge terminal, as in the case of the Family Computer disk system. In addition, there were many cases where a dedicated chip was inserted into the game ROM cartridge to expand its functions, such as Konami’s integration of a sound chip (SCC) into the ROM cartridge of the Family Computer. Since the design allows for additional hardware to be installed depending on the game, it cannot be said that the strict separation of software/hardware has been achieved for home game consoles that supplied games in the form of ROM cartridges during the 2D era. 9 As the amount of game data increases, it is necessary to install a larger capacity ROM (or install multiple low-capacity ROMs). Since high-capacity ROMs are expensive, the manufacturing cost will increase. On the other hand, in the case of disk media, such as ﬂoppy disks and CD-ROMs, the cost of a single piece of media is quite low, so the increase in the data size of games has little impact on the manufacturing cost.\n\n10 Fig. 1.2 Performance of game consoles in 2D era\n\n1\n\nHistory of the Game Industry\n\nGraphic performance\n\nArcade\n\nHome Console PC Computational power and data size\n\ngame machines are following the performance of arcades for several years, they are the lowest in computing power but exceed PCs in drawing power. Figure 1.3 shows the increase in performance of game machines during the 2D era. Since arcades do not require consumers to purchase a game machine, it is easy to introduce the most advanced technology in hardware, and they functioned as a testing ground for new technology. Therefore, boards equipped with new technology were actively released. In the case of Sega, which is engaged in both arcade and home video game business, 5 types of home video game consoles10 and 16 types of system boards11 were released between 1983 and 1998. Therefore, it is shown as a straight line in the graph. The performance of home game consoles increases in a 5–7 year cycle, which is the replacement of hardware, because consumers cannot be required to replace their game machines frequently. The range of performance increase at that time is relatively large, but the performance is lower than that of arcades. In Fig. 1.3, performance was increased at three points in time: Family Computer (1983), Super\n\nThe ﬁve types of hardware are SG-1000 (1983), Sega Mark III (1985), Mega Drive (1988), Sega Saturn (1994), and Dreamcast (1998). Note that hardware with minor changes such as SG-1000 II (1984, a cheaper version of SG-1000) and Master System (1987, Mark III with FM sound unit) are not counted. 11 These are SYSTEM I (1983), SYSTEM II (1985), SYSTEM E (1986), SYSTEM 16 (1986), X-Bord (1987), SYSTEM 24 (1988), Y-Bord (1988), SYSTEM 18 (1989), C-Bord (1990), SYSTEM 32 (1991), SYSTEM MULTI 32 (1992), MODEL 1 (1992), MODEL 2 (1994), ST-V (1994), MODEL 3 (1996), and NAOMI (1998). 10\n\n1.4\n\nBehavioral Principles of Market Participants\n\n11\n\nTotal Performance\n\nArcade Home Console PC\n\n78\n\n81\n\n83\n\n85\n\n90\n\n93\n\n94\n\nFig. 1.3 Path of performance increase in 2D era\n\nFamicom (1990), and PlayStation (1994), which had the highest number of sales in each generation. As for PCs, the performance required for games was ﬁxed with the PC-9801VM, which was released in 1985. The reason why the performance did not increase for 8 years is that (1) PCs are basically for business use and compatibility with old hardware was emphasized even when new hardware was released to run business software, (2) the increase in graphics performance for games was not emphasized in the increase in PC performance, and (3) the penetration rate of PCs in general households was low and compatibility with old machines was necessary to increase the number of games sold.\n\n1.4\n\nBehavioral Principles of Market Participants\n\nCompanies from various ﬁelds are entering the game industry. Therefore, there are signiﬁcant differences in the motivations and behavioral principles of each company. Each company is aware of its surrounding environment and makes decisions to increase its chances of winning and survival in the competition as much as possible within its limited resources. The history of industry is an accumulation of such decisions. These decisions reﬂect the corporate culture or identity core of each company, and the “main principles” and “principles of action” when making decisions.\n\n12\n\n1\n\nHistory of the Game Industry\n\nBefore entering the main part of this book, I would like to describe the image that the author had of the behavioral principles of the leading players in the game industry when writing this book. Speciﬁcally, I would like to describe the behavioral principles common to the four companies (Sega, Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft) that have developed more than three generations of home video game consoles in the past, as well as to PC game companies, online game companies, and social game companies, and also the behavioral principles of individual developers, called “indies ” or “doujin,” who develop games on an individual or group basis. This is a kind of intuition of the author, and it is not something that can be demonstrated in an academic sense. Therefore, I hesitate to include it in the ﬁrst chapter, but I hope it will help readers understand the complex history of the game industry. In the case of Sega, it was “arcades” that were at the core of their actions. Sega, which has many hit arcade games, has created game consoles with a strong awareness of arcade game portability in order to utilize its overwhelming assets in the home game market. Both the Mega Drive (Genesis) and Saturn had an arcade game board as a performance reference during development. Having arcades at the core of the Mega Drive was a success. However, the failure of the Saturn was that it was designed with the porting of arcade 2D games in mind, even though it could produce some of the world’s best 3D games at the time. Although the Dreamcast did not have a base arcade board, it was designed to be highly compatible with arcade games, as evidenced by the long-lasting success of the Dreamcast-compatible NAOMI board. As the hardware evolution accompanied by the shift to 3D games shifted the focus of the game industry from arcade games to PCs and home consoles, Sega was forced to exit the hardware business. In the case of Nintendo, the core of its activities has always been toys. To put it simply, Nintendo’s game consoles and games have innovative interfaces that are fun to touch, and the content is safe for children. They are truly toys. Nintendo has been very particular about the user interface of its game consoles. In the Family Computer (NES), they adopted the cross buttons that were popular in the Game & Watch, and in the Super Famicom (SNES), they created a novel controller with four buttons on the right-hand side plus L and R buttons on the top of the controller. The Nintendo 64 adopted an analog stick for intuitive operation of the “depth” of 3D games, and the Wii adopted a TV remote control-type controller for intuitive and sensory operation. Portable game consoles also adopted touch panels for the DS and naked-eye stereoscopic vision for the 3DS. Although it failed to become popular, the Virtual Boy is a forerunner of today’s VR (Virtual Reality). On the other hand, as is typical of the Mario series, Nintendo emphasizes the importance of game content that can be enjoyed by the whole family and that parents can buy for their children with peace of mind. In the case of Sony, the core of its activities is audio-visual (AV). As symbolized by the fact that the company Sony established when it entered the game industry chose the name Sony “Computer” Entertainment instead of Sony “Game” Entertainment, Sony has a strong awareness of the need for a new type of entertainment\n\n1.4\n\nBehavioral Principles of Market Participants\n\n13\n\nthat integrates computers and video. It is recognized that games are one of the ways to achieve this. The PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 were the pacesetters for the spread of DVD and Blu-Ray, respectively, and the PSP was called “the Walkman of the twenty-ﬁrst century” in early advertisements, clearly demonstrating the company’s commitment to AV. The launch of PlayStation VR, a peripheral device for PlayStation 4, is also easy to understand in this context. In the case of Microsoft, the core of its actions is the “operating system (Windows),” and it is easy to understand the principle of Microsoft’s actions when one considers that it is acting with the intention of making its OS the standard in all areas, not only PCs but also embedded devices, game consoles, music players, and mobile phones. From the perspective of Japanese people who are insensitive to the rigors of global-level business of ICT companies, Microsoft’s actions seem somewhat imperialistic and paranoid. However, as the main role of computers has shifted from PCs to smartphones, Microsoft has been overtaken in terms of market capitalization by Apple, which even helped the company during its past ﬁnancial crisis. Considering this, Microsoft’s actions were not excessive. Since Sony had also dreamed of becoming a home server in every home with the PlayStation 3 and using that as a foothold to expand into consumer electronics and beyond, Microsoft’s move into games was partly a defensive move. The core of the behavior shared by PC game companies, online game companies, and social game companies is that the game business is a means to an end. A typical example of this is Enix’s entry into the PC game business from the housing information magazine business. Many of the companies in this category did not start a game company or become a game company because they wanted to make games but entered the game business because they could make a proﬁt and survive as a company. Some companies, such as Enix, Koei, and Nihon Falcom, became established in the game industry, but when the game business became difﬁcult, other companies withdrew from the game ﬁeld to avoid bankruptcy and started other businesses to survive. This is evident in the companies participating in Project EGG, a service to reprint old PC games through emulation.12 In addition, online games that plagiarize pictures, 3D models, and sometimes even game designs from other games are created on a regular basis. In this way, there are some companies that behave in a morally problematic manner, considering games as a means to make money in a short period of time. On the other hand, the core of the behavior of those who develop games individually or in groups of several people can be described as “game development as an end,” if we use the phrase as a counterpart to the “means” mentioned earlier. Individual developers are not a homogeneous group. They range from those who develop games as a complete hobby to those who dream of making a fortune as entrepreneurs. Among those who develop games as a hobby, there are those who release their games as freeware for free, and those who distribute their games at Comiket for a very small fee. The former group (freeware) is from the so-called\n\n12\n\nhttps://www.amusement-center.com/project/egg/\n\n14\n\n1 History of the Game Industry\n\n“hacker” culture, and their principles of action are different from those of the latter (Comiket) “doujin” culture, but they produce similar results in terms of supplying games at very low prices. The same is true for the birth of what is called independent (indie) companies to develop games as an ongoing business from among both groups. Among the companies that became successful from indies and became small or medium-sized companies, game development became a means to an end as mentioned earlier. However, in the case of companies that survive at the level of studios with only a few members, they stick to game development until the end and often go bankrupt or dissolve when they fail.\n\n1.5\n\nSummary\n\nIn this chapter, after deﬁning what the history of the game industry is, I described the classiﬁcation of the game industry into periods. The game industry is characterized by the coevolution of multiple markets with mutual inﬂuence, and after describing the overall characteristics up to the 2D era for home consoles, I described the characteristics of the behavioral principles of players on the supplier side. In this era, arcades led the innovation in terms of performance, and PCs had a strong presence in RPGs, ADVs, and SLGs, which are game genres for adults and enthusiasts. Home video game consoles occupied a position somewhere in between. The development of each market will be gradually unraveled in later chapters.\n\nChapter 2\n\nArcade Games (1): From Elemecha to Video Games The Birth of Space Invaders and the Establishment of the Arcade Game Industry\n\nAbstract This chapter outlines the arcade game market from the post-World War II period to the early 1980s. During this period, arcade games have shifted from elemechanical to computer games in terms of installed machines. Computer games have also undergone a transition from undifferentiated hardware and software, in which game programs are implemented directly on the base as logic circuits, to the same format as today, in which the CPU executes programs stored in memory. In the early years of their appearance, computer games, including PONG, were not as expressive as the elemechanical machines. Space Invaders overturned this situation, followed by Galaxian and Pac-Man. This was achieved only after the hardware and software were separated, and the programs were loaded in memory and executed by the CPU, the same system used in today's computers. Keywords Elemecha · PONG · TTL · F1(namco) · Space Invaders · CPU · Two transitions As in other industrial ﬁelds, Japan’s game industry began by learning from overseas, and then followed a development path of developing and producing its own similar products (import substitution) and then producing its own original products. This was the same in the pre-computer era of entertainment machines and in the era of computer games.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Dawn of Japan’s Entertainment Machine Industry: The Prehistory of Arcade Game Companies1\n\nAn entertainment machine that produces motion when a coin is inserted is now called an elemecha. Elemec has have existed since the beginning of the twentieth century, and the most famous example is the stationary automatic wooden horse, in\n\n1\n\nThis section draws heavily on Nakafuji (1997) and Akagi (2005).\n\n© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023 Y.

Endo established Nihon Gorakuki2 (Japan Amusement Machine) Co., Ltd. and was involved in the operation of various department store rooftop amusement parks in addition to the manufacture and sale of amusement machines. Among them, Sports Land, which was established in 1931 on the roof of Matsuya Asakusa Department Store, was equipped with not only amusement facilities but also many game machines and rides. This was the forerunner of game arcades in Japan. However, with the start of World War II, the manufacture of entertainment machines was banned, and the once existing trend was over. The entertainment machine industry after World War II started from the outﬂow of goods from PXs of the Occupation Forces. PX (Post eXchange) usually means a store in a US military base, but in Japan after World War II, a few large commercial facilities were conﬁscated as stores of the Occupation Forces, and they were also called PXs. Game machines, such as pinball machines and slot machines, and jukeboxes were sold there, and the postwar entertainment machine industry in Japan started with the sale of these machines (Photo 2.1). In the postwar period, Service Games (1952), Rosen Enterprises (1954),3 and Taito Trading (1953) (Later Taito), which were established in the 1950s, were 2\n\nThe company name was later changed to Nichigo, and it continues to operate a rooftop amusement park. 3 Service Games was dissolved and its business was taken over by Nihon Amusements Bussan (sales division) and Nihon Kikai Seisakusho (manufacturing division) in 1960, and Nihon Amusements Bussan merged with Nihon Kikai Seisakusho in 1964. Nippon Entertainment Bussan merged with Rosen Enterprises to form Sega Enterprises in 1965.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Importation of PONG and the Emergence of Computer Games\n\n17\n\namong the pioneers of the entertainment machine industry. These companies not only sold machines paid for by the Occupation Forces, but also maintained the machines in the stores where they were installed. Eventually, the machines supplied by the Occupation Forces ran out, and under the economic conditions of the time, it was difﬁcult to import entertainment machines from the USA. Therefore, the companies started manufacturing their own machines. The main customers were department store rooftops, movie theaters, amusement parks, etc. In the 1960s, bowling alleys, which boomed during the period of rapid economic growth, were added to the list. In addition to the construction of amusement machine corners in large facilities, single-location facilities, in which wooden horses, jukeboxes, and amusement machines are installed in restaurants and retail stores, also came to be used. The ﬁrst single-location facility in Japan was opened by Taito Trading in front of Kintetsu Ueroku Station in 1960. This was 18 years before the birth of Space Invaders and 12 years before PONG. The games installed were pinball, shooting games, driving games, and other elemechas. At the same time, Nakamura Manufacturing (later Namco) and Kansai Seiki Manufacturing were established in 1955. Both companies started their business by manufacturing amusement machines for amusement parks and playgrounds, the same as the three companies mentioned above. Kansai Seiki has produced several hit products under the brand name Casco. Among them, Mini-Drive (1959), a type of electromechanical machine in which the player drives a car along a driving course drawn on a belt-like cloth, was a big hit. However, in the 1980s, when computer games became mainstream, they could not keep up with the changing times and were left behind.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Importation of PONG and the Emergence of Computer Games\n\nWhen PONG was released in the USA in 1972, several Japanese companies imported samples of the console. Tomohiro Nishikado, a developer at Taito (renamed Taito Trading in 1972), was amazed at the technical capabilities of PONG, but the response from the sales team selling the machine was not so positive. At that time, elemechas were very heavy because they were crammed with mechanical parts and relay circuits used to calculate the number of points. The weight of the device was proof of its elaborate gimmickry. PONG, on the other hand, contained only a TTL board in which the application logic was expressed as a circuit of transistors. This lightness was disliked. PONG realizes the game program in hardware by combining TTL. Therefore, although it is an “electronic” game using\n\n18\n\n2\n\nArcade Games (1): From Elemecha to Video Games\n\nsemiconductors, it is not a “computer” game in the current sense of the word, where the program is loaded into the CPU.4 Finally, Taito released and shipped the game in 1973 under the name Elepon without any license from Atari.5 It is estimated that nearly 100,000 units of PONG and its similar products were made worldwide, but all of them were dead copies or close to dead copies except for Midway’s Winner which was licensed by Atari. During this period, the concept of intellectual property rights was not yet conscious in the industry. After that, several computer games were released, but the next real hit was “Block Kuzushi” in 1977. Block Kuzushi is not the ofﬁcial title of the game, but a generic name given to a copy of Breakout released by Atari in April 1976. At that time, the Nakamura Manufacturing had a Japanese agency contract with Atari, and Breakout was shipped in May, the month following the US launch. The market response was muted at that time. However, over the next 2 years, the popularity of the product gradually increased, and in 1977, the Scratch of Universal and the TT Block of Taito were sold. Later, by the end of 1978, companies such as Hoei Sangyo, Data East, Nihon Bussan(Nichibutsu), Leijac (later Konami), IPM (later Irem), Jatre, Shin Nihon Kikaku (later SNK), Nintendo, Sun Electronics, and Sigma released Block Kuzushi games. As a matter of fact, Block Kuzushi (Breakout imitations) laid the groundwork for the arcade game industry in Japan. However, these Block Kuzushi games did not differ in base, although they added a few variations from the original. These companies did not have the resources to create new and innovative games. Nakamura Manufacturing, which sold the original version of Atari, asked Atari to take countermeasures, but Atari did not have the capacity to do so and there was nothing they could do. In the meantime, Taito developed a table-type chassis that could be installed in a coffee shop, Block Kuzushi further expanded the market for the arcade game machine. When pong and Block Kuzushi were sold, this was a time when both electronic and computer games coexisted. The processing and expressive power of the computer was not yet very high, and the expressive power was higher in the case of the elemecha, which combined various devices. For example, in 1976, electronic components were used for peripheral parts such as the score display and effect sound in 4\n\nThe Intel i4040, a 4-bit microprocessor, was released in November 1971. Although CPUs already existed at the time of the development of Pong, TTL was used in PONG to reduce the cost, and the appearance of games using CPUs can be traced back to Midway’s development of the 8080 board equipped with Intel’s 8-bit processor i8080. In November 1975, Gunﬁght, a computer game based on WesternGun (September 1975) developed by Mr. Nishikado using TTL, was released. There is a time lag of about 3 years from PONG. 5 According to Mr. Nishikado’s lecture at the Digital Game Research Association of Japan, “The PONG board had been lying under my desk for almost half a year, but when Sega started the PONG location ﬁrst and it was well received, we (Taito) started it in a hurry.” Eventually, both Sega’s Pontron and Taito’s Elepon were presented at the 12th Amusement Machine Show (AM Show) in September 1973. Other computer games were also exhibited, and the 12th AM Show was the ﬁrst time that computer games other than elemecha were exhibited in Japan.\n\n2.3\n\nFirst Intellectual Property Infringement Issue: Namco F1\n\n19\n\nF1 released by Nakamura Manufacturing.6 The new technology, called computer games, was not superior from the start and took over elemecha’s position.\n\n2.3\n\nFirst Intellectual Property Infringement Issue: Namco F1\n\nThe game industry has been plagued by copying problems up to the present, but copying problems also occur in the analog era of elemecha. The F1 was a big hit, and Atari received permission from the Nakamura Manufacturing to launch it the month after the Japanese launch, and it became an international hit. Soon after its launch, at the end of 1976, Ushio Sangyo made an unannounced copy of the machine as Z-Machine, and it became a controversial product when Taito, who had been unable to purchase the popular machine F1, purchased Z-machine for their directly operated game centers. F1 is a type of magic lantern machine that projects a racing course onto a screen. Z-machine copied these parts as they were. However, only the custom-made electric bulbs with right-angle bent frames7 could be copied, and it was not possible to project the F1 course of the original (Photos 2.2 and 2.3). In June 1977, Namco (renamed from Nakamura Manufacturing in 1977) ﬁled a provisional injunction against Ushio Sangyo to prohibit the manufacture and sale of Z-machine, and the Tokyo District Court approved it in August. Taito, which stocked the copiers, reached a settlement with Namco in October 1977, and both jointly announced that they had reached an agreement to eliminate discontinued copiers from the industry. This was the ﬁrst case in which a dispute over the copying of arcade game machines was resolved.\n\n6 In a lecture at the Japan Digital Gaming Association Conference, Shigeichi Ishimura, who later became the president of Bandai Namco Games Inc. said as follows: “Electronic circuits are not used to control the game machine from the time you deposit money to the time you play, and then to the time the game is sold. This was achieved by a relay, which is a mechanical mechanism. The core of the game in F1 was also in such a form. Therefore, as Mr. Nishikado just mentioned, the running sound was made by an electronic circuit. The scoring part was also made by an electronic circuit. It was a very hybrid or unbalanced era.” 7 Toru Iwatani, who was working at Nakamura Manufacturing at the time, stated in a lecture at the Japan Digital Game Association Conference as follows: “The reason why we used this special bulb is that the player’s view of the screen in the table is wider in the foreground and narrower in the distance, creating a sense of urgency. In short, the idea is to make it look as if the driver’s point of view is lowered. However, since they could not use a custom-made lump for the copied product, it comes right in the middle of the glass, so the image seen from the front is as if it were viewed with a camera at a very high position. This means that in order to make the game more compelling, the driver’s eyes have to be lowered. That’s what led to the current racing game.”\n\n20\n\n2\n\nArcade Games (1): From Elemecha to Video Games\n\nPhoto 2.2 F1. http://www. arcade-museum.com/game_ detail.php?game_id=7743\n\nPhoto 2.3 The custommade bulb used in F1. The ﬁlament is bent (Taken from Iwatani’s lecture materials)\n\n2.4\n\nSpace Invaders and Its Social Impact\n\nIf the Breakout copier shot the industrial base of the game machine development side, it was Taito’s Space Invaders (1978) that started the industrial base of the game center side. In the history of the Japanese game industry, the importance of Space invaders lies not only in its historical sales, but also in the fact that it was the ﬁrst\n\n2.4\n\nSpace Invaders and Its Social Impact\n\n21\n\ngame developed in Japan based on the use of CPU. It was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado using 8080 board of Midway with which Taito had technical exchanges. At that time, the necessary tools for game development did not exist, so the development process started with the creation of the development tools, which took about 10 months, including the 6 months required for the creation of the development tools. In terms of game design, the Space Invaders were inﬂuenced by Breakout, which they greatly expanded upon. Speciﬁcally, the game design is such that in Breakout, the area that was a square block becomes an enemy with a concrete shape and moves to the bottom of the screen while shooting bullets. In terms of computer performance, the processing performance of the 8080 board was not very high, and there was no room for performance in Japan’s ﬁrst CPU game, the Spaces Invaders. The background was all black, and there was no room to draw stars with dots as a direction, so the screen output was all white, and the color cellophane was placed on the screen for shipment. The drawing was done in a bitmap format, where all the changing areas, including a player’s battleship, enemies, and bullets, were redrawn each time. It did not have a line buffer to change only the character parts. As the number of enemies decreased, the enemy invader’s lateral movement speed increased, but this was possible because there was more room in the hardware due to the reduction in the number of replacement parts. The Space Invaders became an unprecedented boom in history. Launched in July 1978, the Spaces Invaders was extremely popular from the very beginning. The price of the ﬁrst monochrome version of the table cabinet was 460,000 yen (580,000 yen for the color version released later), but in a single day, it generated 20,000–30,000 yen. In less than a month, game center can make their investment money back, and the rest will be all cash income. It was impossible for Taito alone to fulﬁll the orders that kept coming in. Therefore, the company decided to break with the current industry practice of licensing game production only to foreign companies and to license production to other domestic game companies at the end of 1978. The number of units shipped in July 1979, when the Space Invaders’ boom reached its peak, was 200,000. In addition to the 100,000 units shipped from Taito, 100,000 units which contained licensed production by domestic companies that had agreed to produce and imported on consignment to Midway. It is said, however, that there were far more than 200,000 units, at least 300,000 units, and as many as 500,000 units of the product on the market. The difference is that all of them were illegal copies. There was a great deal of opposition to the game in the ﬁeld of education. The school teachers’ association of Sapporo pointed out that (1) most of the students who are enthusiastic about the games stop by the amusement facilities on their way out of school, (2) money lending and borrowing among friends occurs, and (3) recently there has been a tendency to put money on scores. They decided to prohibit all junior and senior high school students from entering the game center. Similar decisions have been made in other prefectures. In response to this social outcry, the Japan Amusement Park Association issued the “Invader Type Game Machine Operation Restraint Statement” on June 2, 1979. The contents are as follows: (1) Do not set up games in an unsupervised area,\n\n22\n\n2 Arcade Games (1): From Elemecha to Video Games\n\n(2) Children under 15 years of age must be accompanied by a parent or guardian, (3) Children under 18 years of age are not allowed to enter after 11:00 p.m., and (4) no prizes should be given away based on the results of the game. The reason for the fourth was that offering drink tickets or prizes based on game scores was a violation of Item 7 of the Act on Control and Improvement of Amusement Business which was mainly for pachinko. Following these self-regulations, the National Police Agency conducted a nationwide survey in July. As these were reported in the press, the image of Space Invaders worsened, and the number of customers in the game centers declined drastically. The end of the invader game boom is described in the white paper on police in 1980 as follows: Invader games became popular among young people around October 1978, and quickly created a boom throughout Japan. However, some young people who did not have money to pay for the game but wanted to play it, used coins tied with strings to play the game for free and collected them after they were thrown in, used the ignition part of electronic lighters for electric shocks that malfunctioned, and stole for money to play the game. Therefore, in July, the police conducted a nationwide survey of the situation and requested related industries to impose voluntary regulations. By the end of the year, most of the game machines, which numbered about 300,000 at their peak, had disappeared from the streets as if they had never existed.\n\nAs a result of the Space Invaders, Taito ranked 53rd among Japanese corporations in terms of income reported to the corporate sector (and seventh among non-listed corporations) in 1979, but the following year it dropped off the rankings. It was truly a 1-year boom.\n\n2.5\n\nEstablishment of Intellectual Property Rights\n\nUnlike elemechas, computer games can be copied by assembling electronic components to create a base system board and then mounting ROMs with coded game data on them. Since it is easy to copy without any knowledge of mechanical parts, the problem of copying games has become more serious. However, since the computer game was a very brand-new thing that had never existed before, it took a long time for the creator’s rights to be established. Atari, a pioneer in the ﬁeld, had not taken adequate measures to address the piracy problem. However, in Japan, with the big hit of the Space Invaders, measures against copying became serious. First, between 1979 and 1980, a series of injunction proceedings and applications for provisional disposition were ﬁled by major companies such as Taito, Namco, and Sega to stop the manufacture and sale of copiers and licensed products manufactured more than the contracted number, based on the Copyright Act and the Unfair Competition Prevention Act. In 1982, a series of copy lawsuits were ﬁled against Spaces Invaders. In the ﬁrst case (September 1982), the court ruled that “it is well known to society that the game of Space Invaders is a product of Taito, and the fact that the copier\n\n2.6\n\nPost-Space Invaders: Galaxian and Beyond\n\n23\n\nmakes the same representation as the display function of the Space Invaders (i.e., the function of transforming the image of the game and its display) violates the Unfair Competition Prevention Act.” However, this decision did not mention the violation of copyright. In the second decision (December 1982), the copyright was recognized as a computer program, but it was not recognized that the game itself was a work of authorship. The ﬁrst decision to protect a game as a visual or auditory work was issued in 1984. This was a case involving an unlicenced copy of Namco’s Pac-Man (1981), in which Namco sued a coffee shop that set up an unlicenced copy of the game for violating its right to show the game as a work of art. In the decision, it was recognized that the Pac-Man had a copyrightness and that it was a work that produces visual and auditory effects similar to the effects of a movie. The defendant was ordered to pay damages for infringement of the right of reproduction of the work of art by the commercial use of the uncut copy product. Thus, even if the programs were different, infringement of copyright was recognized as long as the visual and auditory effects (effects on the eyes) were the same. The lawsuits continued and the number of illegally copied products decreased from the arcade games in Japan.8\n\n2.6\n\nPost-Space Invaders: Galaxian and Beyond\n\nAfter the big boom of the Space Invaders, it was Namco that delivered the game that was required by the game centers that were looking for a hit. Namco also started basic research to develop a computer game using a CPU at the same time as Taito, but the ﬁrst computer game, Gee Bee, was not released until October 1978, after the launch of the Space Invaders. It was followed by “Bomb Bee” (July 1979), but it was overshadowed by the boom of Space Invaders. Amid all this, Galaxian (November 1979) was created with the explicit goal of creating a game that could surpass the Space Invaders. The Z809 was used as CPU, and it was equipped with the10 sprite function as a dedicated circuit to quickly replace characters in the screen. In addition, a\n\n8 When a big hit is released, the copy boards start to appear again. Later, during boom of the ﬁghting game, there was a large amount of copy boards for Street Fighter II, Capcon, 1991, which was called Street Fighter II Rainbow by gamers. 9 Later, this CPU became the standard of the 8-bit era gaming CPU, which was used for both arcade and home console. 10 The sprite function is an extension of the technology called line-puffer, which Atari introduced in the Night Driver (1976). In Night Driver, to represent the speed of a car, the two ends of the road are expressed as squares that resemble streetlights in the dark. In order to quickly move this rectangle to the left or right for drawing, the horizontal coordinates of the place to be drawn are recorded in a memory with a horn, and the line buffer is interrupted in accordance with the timing of the running\n\n24\n\n2\n\nArcade Games (1): From Elemecha to Video Games\n\nbackground image display circuit was also specially designed and installed to display the ﬂowing stars to create an atmosphere of space. With the sprite function, it was possible for multiple enemies to ﬂy in a curvilinear arc and attack the ship, whereas in Space Invaders, enemy characters could only advance sideways in a line (descending one step when they reached the edge of the screen). The Galaxian surpassed the level of the Space Invaders subspecies and reached a completely new level of expression. Namco also hit its sequel, Galaga (1981). This series of hits established the shooting11genre as one of the most popular arcades. Following Galaxian, Namco produced hit products such as Pac-Man12 and Rally X (both in 1980), which came to occupy a major position in the game center at that time. In addition to Namco, there were many other products such as Sega’s Monaco GP (1979), Nichibutsu’s Moon Cresta (1980) and Crazy Climber (1980), Scramble (1981) of Konami Industry (Rejak), Denki Onkyo’s Heiankyo Alien (1979), and Alpha Electronics’ Jumputer (1981), and many other titles were released, and even in the age of post-Space Invaders, the game center was established as a form of entertainment.\n\n2.7\n\nSummary: Two Technological Shifts\n\nIn this chapter, I have described the Japanese arcade game industry from its prehistory to the post-industrial era. In the 35-year period from the end of World War II to around 1980, the entertainment industry at that time and the current arcade game industry experienced two major technological shifts. These are the following two: 1. Transfer from elemecha to computer. 2. Separation of the hardware and software of the game machine: From the TTL substrate that was implemented in hardware with the game program as the logic circuit, to the system that reads data from the ROM that recorded the game program and executes it on the CPU.\n\nline to be drawn on the screen by the plane tube. The sprite function is a mechanism that extends the line-puffer to two dimensions so that the game-character image can be displayed at a desired location on the screen instead of in a horizontal row. 11 It was not until the scrolling screen type of shooting games (where the background moves), rather than the ﬁxed screen type such as Galaxian and Galaga, hit the scene that shooting was fully established as a genre. Speciﬁcally, after Xevious (Namco, 1983), a large hit of the vertical scrolling type, and Gradius (Konami, 1985), a large hit of the horizontal scrolling type. A shooting game requires a lot of processing to move many objects quickly at the same time, and it was the best way for game companies to show their technological capabilities. 12 Pac-Man has had several sequels, but Ms. Pac-Man (1982) has not been shipped in Japan.\n\n2.7\n\nSummary: Two Technological Shifts\n\n25\n\nThe ﬁrst migration was not intermittent, but was gradual with large overlapping parts. In the middle stage of the migration, the older technology, elemecha, had much higher expressive power and entertainment value than computer games. Therefore, the ﬁnal migration proceeded along with the second migration, the separation of hardware and software. With the method of representing the game program in a hard form on the TTL board, not only was trial and error difﬁcult during game development, but it was also impossible to implement a more complex program in hardware. It was only when hardware and software were separated, and the expression and performance of the game were handled software-based, that games such as Space Invaders, Galaxian, and Pac-Man were created, and computer games were able to surpass the expressive power of elemecha. The fact that the two migrations were completed in the 1980s can be seen from the specialization of the game developers employed at that time. The developer of the Space Invaders, Nishikado, was an elemecha designer and also developed the famous elemecha, Skyﬁghter (Taito 1973). Shigeichi Ishimura (later president of Bandai Namco Games, Inc.), who was a main member to develop Galaxian, was involved in the development of electronic components for the F1, and was also involved in the development of the CPU-equipped motherboard for Galaxian. In Nishikado’s case, he was involved in electronics and computers, while in Ishimura’s case, he was involved in computer hardware and software, and although the areas covered were different, it was a time when skills in multiple ﬁelds were necessary. It was not until the 1980s that computer system developers were clearly separated into those in charge of hardware design and those in charge of software (game design and programming) at the time of hiring.\n\nChapter 3\n\nPC Game (1): Establishing the 8-Bit Trinities\n\nAbstract This chapter describes the birth of PC games in Japan and the probability of the market. Only a few years after Apple in the USA, the personal computer wave that began in Japan spawned many PC enthusiasts and a myriad of software companies. Three models with a good balance of price and performance survived in the crowded market, creating a unique game culture that differed from that of the USA and arcades. Keywords 8-bit trinities · PC-8801 · PC-9801 · FM-7 · X1 · MSX\n\n3.1\n\nBirth of the Personal Computer\n\nIn the late 1970s to early 1980s, computers for individual hobbyists were called micoms.1 The TK-80, released by NEC on August 3, 1970, is called the originator of the Japanese microcomputer. However, the TK-80 was sold as a study kit (the TK in the model number means a training kit) to master the 8080 compatible CPU manufactured by NEC and was not a computer made for individual use. The product was a semi-completed product that consisted of a motherboard with a semiconductor, a decimal keypad for direct input of mechine language programs, a LED for displaying results, and an I/O port. The MB-6880(nickname: Basic Master) from Hitachi was released in 1978, and the PC-8001 from NEC and the MZ-80K from Sharp were released in 1979 as complete PCs with the main unit stored in a case and connected to a keypad. Table 3.1 shows the speciﬁcations of the ﬁrst 8-bit PCs. The CPU is not much different from the next generation of PCs and game-dedicated machines, but the graphics function was weak.

For these people, it is natural that there will be a business that sells the completed programs. In the radio shops and wireless communication equipment shops2 that were selling PCs at the time, programs developed by the store workers or brought in by customers hanging out in the stores were sold in the form of recorded data on a cassette tape. This is exempliﬁed by companies such as Tsukumo Electric and Fuji Audio, both of which have stores in Akihabara. The games were sold in stores, but\n\n2\n\nIn the days before computers, many young people and adults who were interested in science and crafts were into electronic engineering and amateur radio. They were also interested in PCs, and stores that sold wireless naturally began to sell PCs.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Early Days of the PC Game Industry\n\n29\n\nthey also sold them by placing a mail order advertisement in the computer magazines that the users read and sending the payment by registered mail. Many of these PC games were sold at the level of “made in one night by a shopkeeper who knows a lot about PCs or a young man who hangs out in a store,” and most of them were simple at best, or cheap and lacking in depth at worst.3 Because of the lack of game-oriented performance (especially graphics performance), there was a clear difference when compared to arcade games such as Space Invaders (Taito), which had been released a year earlier in 1978. Even so, when there were no other options, the games sold well.4 As the 1980s progressed, the graphics capabilities of PCs improved, and the game content became more sophisticated. As the game programs sold became more sophisticated, the production and sales of programs in shops were naturally eliminated. One of the companies that survived by focusing on software development was Hudson, a wireless communication equipment store in Sapporo. Another source of game software in the early days was personal computer magazines. I/O (Kohgaku-sha, October 1976-present), Gekkan maikon (Monthly MyCom) (Dempa Publications, October 1977–April 1995), and other PC magazines published at the time contained lists of programs, some of which were games. PC users played with the programs published in the magazines by typing them in with their own hands. However, the published programs were long, and it was necessary to enter decimal machine language program printed over several pages. Therefore, there was a demand for cassette tapes with the programs already recorded, and these became available for sale.5 In the 1980s, the ﬁrst issue of Maikon BASIC Magazine (Mycom BASIC Magazine) (Dempa Publications, July 1982–May 2003—known as Bê-Maga) was published, which publishes short (up to two-pages) programs in BASIC language submitted by readers. The magazine received submissions from a wide range of people, from junior high and high school students to adults, and was appreciated by junior high and high school students who could not afford to buy game software frequently and served as a model for live programming. In addition, the magazine was very popular because it included programs for minor computers for which no game software was available on the market. Some of the people who submitted excellent works were scouted by the editorial department and were in charge of transferring arcade games for sale at the Dempa Publications. In the early days of the game industry, many developers were scouted from magazines.\n\nSome enthusiasts play the old games, calling them “retro games,” but even then, they are played only after the launch of Family Computer for home console or arcade games after Space Invaders, and PC games from this period are rarely played. 4 Hudson, who was a radio store in Hokkaido at that time, put an advertisement in Gekkan maikon (Monthly MyCom) and started receiving 300,000 to 400,000 yen a day from all over Japan by registered mail. (Aida & Otsubo, 1997, p237) 5 These tapes were duplicated in a music studio. In some cases, the number of copies in hit game titles was greater than the number of music tapes of hit singers at the time. 3\n\n30\n\n3.2.2\n\n3\n\nPC Game (1): Establishing the 8-Bit Trinities\n\nThe Birth of Software Companies\n\nAs the spread of PCs has progressed, companies from other ﬁelds have joined the development and sales of games or have started new businesses. Although there are many companies that have already withdrawn from the game industry, the following section describes those companies that are still in the game industry. KOEI was founded in 1978 as a sales company of dyes and industrial chemicals unrelated to games, but it also started out as a rental record store. In 1980, Yoichi Erikawa, the founder of the company and famous for his designer name Kō Shibusawa, purchased a PC, which led to the start of PC sales and business software business. In 1981, at the dawn of the company, KOEI released Kawanakajima no Kassen (The Battle of Kawanakajima) for the PC-8001, indicating its orientation toward historical simulations from that time. KOEI established its position with the hit Nobunaga no Yabou (Nobunaga's Ambition) in 1983, selling many types of machines, from hobby PCs for home use such as the PC-8801 and the FM-7 to business PCs such as the FM-16β and the IBM-JX,6 and later to Family Computer. In 1985, he released Aoki ookami to Shiroki Mejika (The Blue Wolf and the White Stag) and Sangokushi(The Romance of the Three Kingdoms) to establish his position as a leading historical simulator. SystemSoft (the game division was taken over by Nippon Ichi Software in January 2020) was established in 1979. Initially, the company sold games as well as utility software for PCs. The Lode Runner (1983), a transfer from Apple II, became a big hit. In 1986, the company launched Gendai Dai-Senryaku (Modern Grand Strategy) and in 1989, Tenka Touitsu (Uniﬁcation of the Whole Country), which were both successful in establishing its position in the simulation game market. When Enix was founded in 1975 by its founder Yasuhiro Fukushima, it was a completely different business and had a different name. Fukuyama turned his attention to the booming PC market and changed the business model to PC cams in 1982, at which time the company name was changed to Enix. What differentiated Enix from other PC game companies was that it did not develop games on its own but focused on the business of ﬁnding and selling excellent games as a publisher. In September 1982, Enix held the ﬁrst Game Hobby program contest. Although similar attempts had been made by other companies such as PC shops and PC magazines, the prize money for the contest was as high as 1 million yen for the winner and 3 million yen in total, and many excellent programs were submitted. In the end, a total of 13 titles were commercialized by adding the best program award Morita's Battle Field (Kazuo Morita7), the good program award Door Door (Koichi\n\n6\n\nBecause the target age of the games released by KOEI was older, KOEI actively transferred games to PCs that were used by ofﬁce workers and home business owners to manage their business affairs. 7 He is a game programmer who specializes in thoughtful routines, and his representative work is Morita Shogi. He died in 2012.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Early Days of the PC Game Industry\n\n31\n\nNakamura8), the best program award Marichan Kiki Ippatsu (Marichan's Clutch) (Tadashi Makimura9), and other prize-winning works.10 Nihon Falcom was established in 1981 as a PC introduction advisor company. From the very beginning, the company was involved in game development, releasing games in various ﬁelds, and experimenting in the market. After the hit Dragon Slayer in 1984, Nihon Falcom established its position in action RPG. In 1985, Xanadu shipped a total of 400,000 copies. In 1987 and the following year, with the release of Ys and Ys2, the company made a bold shift from a focus on solving difﬁcult riddles to a focus on storytelling,11 which had a signiﬁcant impact on subsequent games, making it one of the top game companies of the time. Square was founded in 1983 as the software development division of an electrical engineering company owned by founder Masashi Miyamoto's father. Masashi Miyamoto set up a salon in Hiyoshi, Yokohama, with the latest PCs of the time, and gathered students there. One of the students who came was Hisashi Suzuki, who had started working as an assistant at a record rental store run by KOEI, and was now helping with the PC gaming business. Square developed adventure games such as Will: Death Trap II (1985) and Alpha (1986), as well as the RPG Cruse Chaser Blasty (1986), for which the character design and animation were handled by Sunrise. The company placed emphasis on graphics from the time it was established, as evidenced by the fact that part of the screen was animated. Square was established relatively late, and after its ﬁrst entry into the Family Computer market, THEXDAR (a port of a PC game released by Game Arts in 1985), it quickly migrated to home\n\n8 Nakamura was a bit of a celebrity among the younger generation of PC enthusiasts, having contributed to various magazines even before the Enix program was commissioned. He was a high school student when he participated in the contest and founded Chunsoft (now Spike Chunsoft) in 1984 after entering the Junior College of The University of Electro-Communications. In the early days of the company, he was closely associated with Enix and developed the ﬁrst ﬁve Dragon Quest, a national RPG. His representative works are Kamaitachi no Yoru (Banshee's Last Cry) and Furai no Shiren (Shiren The Wanderer) series. 9 He later became active as a manga and illusionist as a pen name Doronpa. Other works developed as a game designer including Eldorado Denki (1985, Enix), and Gundhara (1987, Enix). 10 Among the prize-winning works is Yuji Horii’s Lovematch Tennis. After the trilogy of adventurer games, Portpia Renzoku Satsujinjiken (Portpia Serial Murder Case), Okhotsk ni Kiyu (Disappear in Okhotsk), and Karuizawa Yukai-Annai (Karuizawa Kidnapper), Yuji Horii designed Dragon Quest, which has now become a national RPG. He is also a game designer who has created hits in a variety of ﬁelds, such as the hit board game Itadaki Street (Fortune Street). 11 In terms of volume, compared to today’s games, the games of the early 1980s are less voluminous. In an adventure game, it takes less than an hour to ﬁgure out the solution. For this reason, many games were designed to extend the playing time by forcing the player to solve extremely difﬁcult riddles without any tips, or by setting up many traps in which the player has to play again from the beginning. A classic example of Nihon Falcom’s game is Romancia (1986), which is full of unreasonable mysteries. Ys did not have extremely difﬁcult riddles and could be completed in about 8 h by a casual player who was not too bad at action games. Although the cost per playtime was relatively higher for a game at that time, it was a big hit due to its high quality, and it was ported to many types of machines, including home game machines.\n\n32\n\n3\n\nPC Game"
