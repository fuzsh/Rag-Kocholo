        "text": "Japanese publisher and developer, founded on May 18, 1973. Although it already started to sell PC-related products in 1975 it wasn't until 1984 when Hudson began to produce videogames for the Famicom (NES) that the company enjoyed notable success. hudson's first Famicom title, Lode Runner, sold 12 million units. After a long history of producing games for Nintendo's consoles, Hudson teamed up with NCL and founded the joint venture Manegi Corporation in May of 1998. In 2005, after a series of monetary losses, Hudson found financial aid in Konami, which spent more than $13 million to become Hudson's majority shareholder.\n\nHudson Entertainment was the North American publishing arm of Hudson Soft. This arm of the company focused on three key business: Console Games, Mobile Games, and Music. Beginning 2000, Hudson's mobile division was a leading supplier of games and personalized content. Hudson Entertainment was closed in February of 2011 as part of a downturn in the Hudson business and an absorption of the company by majority shareholder Konami.\n\nAfter a continuing slide of priority and business for Hudson, parent company Konami announced the dissolution/absorption of Hudson Soft, finalizing in March of 2012.\n\nHudson's best-known game franchise to date is the Bomerman series, which has appeared on all major platforms."
