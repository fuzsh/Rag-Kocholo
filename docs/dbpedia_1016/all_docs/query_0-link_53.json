Expertise: Juggling a gorgeous wife, two beautiful girls and an award-winning magazine, all under one roof! Currently playing: Dead Space Favourite game of all time: OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast\n\nI recently bought The A500 Mini for my brother’s birthday, of course I had to test it before I handed it over. Well, either that, or it was so I could get a go on Super Cars II… Expertise: Finishing Game Pass games before they go Currently playing: Exoprimal Favourite game of all time: God Hand\n\nI’m rather partial to N2O, a Tempest-style PlayStation shoot-’em-up with a soundtrack by The Crystal Method. Deﬂektor is great too. Expertise: Owning five Master Systems and a Mark III Currently playing: Tomb Raider: Legend Favourite game of all time: Sonic The Hedgehog\n\nANDY SALTER\n\nRORY MILNE\n\nNot exactly a game I played, but it was interesting to see Gremlin try to take on EA with the release of Actua Soccer. Expertise: Modding games, no ‘vanilla’ versions for me, thanks! Currently modding: Kenshi Universal Wasteland Expansion Mod Favourite game of all time: Rome: Total War although I guess it’s the Remastered edition now.\n\nKids’ comics are a staple of many British childhoods, and Jack The Nipper brings them to riotous life. As well as rewarding naughty pranks, it’s just a great arcade adventure. Expertise: The game that I’m writing about at the time of writing Currently playing: Star Wars: Starﬁghter Favourite game of all time: Tempest\n\nGRAEME MASON Jack The Nipper, such fun causing havoc with a peashooter and superglue! Expertise: Adjusting the tape azimuth with a screwdriver Currently playing: The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim Favourite game of all time: Resident Evil 4\n\nPAUL DRURY From the 8-bit days, it’s the brilliant Bounder. From its later releases, I have a very soft spot for N2O, which is basically Tony Crowther covering Jeff Minter – two of my heroes in one. Expertise: Compton’s classic penny pushers Currently playing: Ray’z Arcade Chronology Favourite game of all time: Sheep In Space\n\nANDREW FISHER\n\nPAUL ROSE\n\nWest Bank (C64) – inspired by the arcade game Bank Panic, it’s a great test of reactions. Expertise: Forty years of gaming, from Commodore 64 to Switch Currently playing: Space Taxi Favourite game of all time: Wizball\n\nI’ve got a bit of a soft spot for Bounder. The C64 version though. The lack of colour makes it next to unplayable on the Speccy. Expertise: Winging’ it Currently playing: The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Favourite game of all time: Half-Life 2\n\ncan still remember the first time I played Sonic 3. I’d visited my friend Brady’s house and he had it on his Mega Drive and eagerly showed it to me. I remember being impressed by its slick visuals and excellent music, but completely missed its Sonic & Knuckles sequel, despite seeing adverts for it at the time. It’s great then to hear about the creation of both games via Takashi Iizuka as it’s a pair of Sonic classics that I only recently got seriously stuck into thanks to Sonic Origins. Speaking of which, Nick’s taken time from writing our main feature to list all the Game Gear games that are included in the new DLC update for Sonic Origins. If going fast isn’t your thing there’s plenty more to enjoy this issue. We quiz Ian Stewart about the games of Gremlin Graphics, look at the impact of System Shock and its impressive new remaster and chat to Mike Tucker about the excellent Xeno Crisis. We also explore Mike Singleton’s The Lords Of Midnight, take Rockstar’s Midnight Club series for a spin, go behind the scenes of the excellent RoboCop 3 and much more besides.

The shows have been a big success for Nintendo and they’re routinely used to reveal new games or give gamers an in-depth look at titles that they can expect to play soon. Nintendo’s most-recent show took place on 21 June and featured a varied selection of games, but no news of the long-rumoured Switch 2 that so many fans want. Remakes and remasters have become a bread-and-butter staple of Nintendo’s Switch and several interesting offerings were announced. The biggest by far was a brand-new remake of the SNES Holy Grail Super Mario RPG. It looks absolutely superb with completely overhauled visuals, while the game’s music is being\n\nI\n\nrevisited by Yoko Shimomura who composed the original soundtrack. Super Mario RPG wasn’t the only RPG to receive an update as a remake of Star Ocean 2 is on the way and combines 3D visuals with the distinctive 2D-HD visuals that appear in games like Octopath Traveler. It’s heading to all systems and, like Super Mario RPG, is planned for a November release. Another remaster heading to all systems is Konami’s Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1, which will include Metal Gear Solid 1, 2 and 3, the original Metal Gear MSX games as well as the NES games, including Snake’s Revenge. Finally, a remaster of Luigi’s Mansion 2 was announced, which last appeared on Nintendo’s 3DS, and Nintendo also stealthily dropped HD remasters of Pikmin 1 and 2. Both titles are available to enjoy right now with a physical set of the two games being planned for later in the year. The new HD updates of the first two Pikmin games made a lot of sense when you consider the Direct’s focus on Pikmin 4, which will be available by the time you read this. You can expect a review\n\nNintendo’s Switch may well be in its twilight years now, but it’s clearly going out with a bang in our 250th issue, but it’s looking like another enjoyable addition to the series. Nintendo also used its Direct to announce several new games and virtually all of them will be available this year. The only title planned for 2024 is a new game starring Princess Peach. Peach hasn’t starred in her own game since 2005’s Super Princess Peach, so we’re interested to see what direction Nintendo will take with the new, currently untitled game. The new Peach game may be a while away, but Nintendo has several big hitters to kill time while you wait. WarioWare: Move It! is due November and sounds like\n\nPERSONA GOES BIG lthough Microsoft’s Showcase event was largely focussed on new IP, it did announce its Fable remake and revealed that the latest Forza Motorsport would drop in October. Both games will appear on Game Pass and they’ll be eventually joined by Persona 3 Reload, a remake that will arrive in 2024. Persona 5 Tactica will also debut on Game Pass and looks to be a Fire Emblem-styled strategy game, which makes Darran very happy indeed.\n\nA\n\n» [Switch] Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 is looking like an essential purchase for Snake fans.\n\n» [Switch] What’s the bet that the original Luigi’s Mansion will eventually make its way to Switch as well?\n\na spiritual successor to the Wii’s WarioWare: Smooth Moves. Over 200 minigames will be included, with many of them focussing on using two controllers. A second Detective Pikachu game is also on the way and will drop in October. The mystery-based sequel was first announced back in 2019, so it will be interesting to see what enhancements it offers over the original 3DS adventure. The biggest news of the show by far (at least for us) was the confirmation of a brand-new 2D Mario game which had been rumoured beforehand alongside a remake of Chrono Trigger (which remains a rumour). Like Detective\n\n» [Switch] We enjoyed Super Princess Peach, so we’ll certainly be keeping an eye on this.\n\nAIR TWISTER UPGRADES » [Switch] With this and Super Mario Bros Wonder, it’s certainly a good time for classic platformers.\n\nPikachu 2, Super Mario Bros Wonder is due October and looks like it’s going to be tremendous fun. It features a very distinctive aesthetic which allows for some tremendous expressions on Mario and the rest of the team and the levels and abilities we’ve seen so far look really inventive, including a new elephant-themed power-up. There also seems to be a focus on combo-based gameplay, so it will be interesting to see how integral to the game that ends up being. We’re also keen to see more of the Wonder Flower, a new mechanic which will alter aspects of the game whenever it is collected. Like more-recent Super Mario Bros games there will be a focus on multiplayer, with Luigi, Peach and Daisy being just a few of the playable characters available. Other highlights of the Direct focussed on games that would mainly be appearing across all\n\nformats and included more news on the incoming Sonic Superstars, which is being co-developed with Arzest, a studio cofounded by Sonic’s co-creator Naoto Ohshima. It looks to be a modernisation of the classic Mega Drive Sonic games, so we’re interested to see if it will be able to better Sonic Mania. Other games included Penny’s Big Breakaway, a 3D platformer by the team that made Sonic Mania and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince from Square, which is currently looking like a Switch exclusive. Nintendo’s Switch may well be in its twilight years now, but it’s clearly going out with a bang. It’s a little concerning that Nintendo seems to be cramming most of these titles into a two-month window, but at least it means gamers are going to have plenty of choice by the year’s end.\n\nhe latest game from Yu Suzuki is finally due to appear on other systems after starting life on Apple Arcade. Air Twister is an entertaining into-the-screen shooter that feels like a spiritual successor to Space Harrier and features a princess who rides a giant swan. It also has a truly bonkers soundtrack that sounds like a missing Queen album and will hopefully include all the additional upgrades found in the Apple Arcade release.\n\nT\n\nRETRO GAMER | 7\n\nCOLUMN\n\nFEATURING IAIN LEE\n\nWho is Iain Lee? Iain Lee is a freelance counsellor who loves gaming, particularly retro gaming. You can get more information about Iain by visiting iainleecounselling.com or heading over to patreon.com/iainandKatherine\n\nNowhere man he world of retro gaming can be very lonely. Modern gaming is great. You can pop online and play a round of Walkabout Mini Golf or Call Of Duty with any number of friends. Sadly, my BBC or GameCube can’t do that. OK, I know you technically CAN get the GameCube online, but stop being pedantic. I’m a member of a Dragon 32 Facebook group. I don’t contribute, instead choosing to sit back and read posts about processors and clocks and loads of other stuff I have absolutely zero understanding of. However, whilst on there an ad popped up for RetCon – an event celebrating the world of retro that was only 40 minutes away from me. Some people may find it hard to believe but beneath this rather brash exterior I am an incredibly shy man. The thought of going to an event like this on my own fills me with dread. I hummed and hawed about going and decided I wouldn’t. Then I saw a tweet from a guy called Matthew Harold. He was going to be there and would be displaying a BBC that could connect with other gamers via a ham radio setup. That totally swung it for me. I went. I’m so glad I did. Magic happened that day. I met up with Matthew and he very graciously explained to me how the system worked. It was lovely just having a nerdy chat with this guy who explained everything and answered my rather dumb questions.\n\nT\n\nI bumped into Retro Faith, she of this RG parish. We’d met on Twitch a lot over the last couple of years and seeing her in the flesh was a real joy. The main thing I did was sit and watch some talks by absolute legends. I caught the end of the Oliver twins. Can I let you into a secret? It never occurred to me, and this will sound silly, that they would be actual twins. I know, I know. Hang my head in shame. I just thought it was a cool nickname for them. My favourite talk was Kevin Toms about Football Manager. This was not a game I ever played but of course I grew up seeing his beardy face on the cover of those games when I went round to friend’s houses or was perusing the tapes in Boots. He explained why he put his face on there – we knew what pop stars and movie actors looked like, why not game designers? And his plan worked. I got a real rush listening to him. I bumped into him a bit later. He was sitting on his own and I just had to go and say something. Unfortunately, shy me kicked in. Me, “Hey Kevin, I really enjoyed your talk.” Kevin, “Thanks.” End of conversation. I didn’t talk to too many people, but those I did were absolutely lovely. A very kind guy came up and told me how my Twitch streams had helped him through lockdown. Stuff like that is really humbling. I am so glad I went. It was a very powerful and moving experience. I am totally going back next year.\n\nThe main thing I did was sit and watch some talks by absolute legends Do you agree with Iain’s thoughts?

Paul is probably better known as Mr Biffo – the creator of legendary teletext games magazine Digitiser. These days, he mostly writes his videogame ramblings over at Digitiser2000.com. If you want more Biffo in your eyes, you can catch him as the host of Digitizer The Show at www.bit.ly/biffo2000\n\nForgotten systems ne of the unexpected positive consequences of accidentally becoming a games journalist during the Nineties – arguably the most exciting time in gaming ever – was getting to play everything. It came with the territory that we’d either be given, or be bought, review hardware. Not just the heavy-hitters, of course, but the ones that got away. The almost-rans, who made a play for glory. Those games systems that promised so much, and fizzled away with barely a sputter. Had I been just a punter, like most of Digitiser’s readers, I doubtless would’ve stuck with my Mega Drive, Game Boy and Super NES, and looked upon the 3DO, the Jaguar and CD32 with the disdain that they maybe semi-deserved. I say only semi-deserved, because even the worst systems had things to recommend them. I don’t recall us ever actually being given a Jaguar review machine, but I believe Atari loaned one to us – which then had to be given back when the company choked on its own misfortune. Though it had few must-play games during its brief existence, the Jaguar was so clearly a powerful machine that who knows what it could’ve achieved, if there’d been an incentive for more studios to develop for it? Alien Vs Predator was obviously the must-play title, with Tempest 2000 a close second. Go back to either now, and the untapped potential of the system is self-evident.\n\nO\n\nThe 3DO I remember being extremely excited about. I’m not sure why looking back, but whatever message it was selling had certainly chimed with me. Ironically, its best games – Star Control 2, Cannon Fodder, Out Of This World – were ports, and didn’t stretch the hardware. Nevertheless, Need For Speed, Road Rash, Return Fire, Space Hulk: Vengeance Of The Blood Angels, all demonstrated the huge potential for a second generation of 3DO games that never really materialised. Admittedly, there was never much about the CD32 to get excited about. It always had a whiff of desperation about it – a panicked last roll of the Amiga dice. It had very few exclusives, it felt cheaply put together, the controller was a back-to-front lump of rattly nonsense, and yet… there was still that frisson of playing something new. The buzz of hope. Any time I laid hands on a new system there was always the chance that this was maybe, possibly, perhaps, the next big thing. So it was also with the CD-i, the Nokia N-Gage, the Virtual Boy, the Ouya, Gizmondo, Vita and countless others. They were all punching above their weight. I honestly don’t think there’s any such thing as a bad games machine. With the right level of support, the right timing, or the right luck, any one of them could’ve been a contender. Maybe that’s not the case now we’re in an era where the hardware companies are behemoths. There’s no room for anyone smaller to sweep in and upset the status quo. And, frankly, the games industry is so much less interesting as a result.\n\nEven the worst systems had things to recommend them Do you agree with Paul’s thoughts?

You’ll be able to contact him at [email protected]\n\n» You can experience lovingly recreated Herne Bay arcades, with Alan as virtual tour guide, at arcadebritannia.com\n\nArcade Britannia Author Dr Alan Meades tells Paul Drury all about the beautiful British arcade ver wondered about the roots of our beloved arcades? Dr Alan Meades, principal lecturer in game design at Canterbury Christ Church University, has written a comprehensive, entertaining and accessible book, investigating their long history, their place in British society and, of course, the myriad of games which populated them.\n\nE\n\nWas the motivation for writing the book a misspent youth playing Out Run in arcades, Alan? I grew up in the English seaside resort of Broadstairs. There was a great little arcade by the beach that became my hangout for much\n\n12 | RETRO GAMER\n\nof my childhood and adolescence, and then there was the massive arcades at Margate and Ramsgate a few miles either way. I grew up with a great love of arcades and arcade games but it wasn’t until I finished my PhD, where I spent a few years alongside hackers, glitchers and modders on the Xbox scene, that I realised there was a whole untold history of the origins and development of the British arcade to be told. Why is the arcade something worthy of study? I think that the test of something being worthy of study is how big an influence it has upon people and culture – how big a mark it\n\nBritish arcades were as much a space for the old dears playing bingo, the pinball or fruit machine fans, or families on penny pushers, as my generation playing videogames DR ALAN MEADES\n\nleaves on your soul. For me, the arcade was absolutely intrinsic to my relationship with technology, games and other game players and it has influenced how I’ve grown up and see the world – I now run a games design degree, for instance. I’ve met so many people that say similar things. Our readers probably associate ‘the arcade’ as the place they went to in the Seventies, Eighties and Nineties to play videogames but British arcades have a much longer history than that, don’t they? The amusement arcade can be directly linked to the travelling fairgrounds that were\n\ncommon across the country, as the showmen who ran them always kept a look out for novel entertainment technologies. In the late-1800s, coin-operated machines became popular including amusements and gambling devices, and showmen incorporated them into their travelling fairs. In the off-season months, showmen would rent buildings and workshops where they’d store and fix their amusements and they’d welcome visitors inside to pay and play the machines. Some showmen decided to keep these ‘gaff shops’ open permanently and high-traffic entertainment areas and seaside resorts were perfect\n\n» Arcades existed long before videogames arrived, as this pre-WWII photo of Merrie England arcade in Ramsgate proves. » Alan took the unusual route of producing a comic to reach out to the arcade community. And it worked!\n\n» The very first coin-operated videogame produced in the UK was ALCA’s PingPong, a knock off of Atari’s Pong. How very British.\n\n» Alan’s fascinating book is a great read for anyone interested in arcades, videogames and social history.\n\nfor them. After the First World War, many travelling showmen decided to set up arcades, and this accelerated after the Second World War as fairgrounds were systematically closed down during urban regeneration. You talk about the ‘mythic arcade’ in your book. What is it and how is it different to what we had in the UK? The mythic arcade is that, the imaginary, stereotypical, North American influenced arcade idea: neon, videogames, adolescent boys, pop music. It’s a strange mix of Tron, The Last Starfighter, and almost every retro videogame compilation, and is probably best seen in Stranger Things’ Palace Arcade. It has become the dominant way of thinking\n\n» Those were the days – Alan’s book has many evocative photos. (Images © George Wilson.)\n\nand talking about arcades, and it steamrollers all over the memories of actual arcades, with all their distinct national differences. My British childhood arcades were as much a space for the old dears playing bingo, the pinball or fruit machine fans, or indeed the families on penny pushers, as my generation playing videogames. You have interviewed many people from this oftendemonised industry for your book. Was it hard to get them to trust you and talk? It was slow going at first, simply because arcade owners and people in the industry had often been treated poorly by journalists who misrepresented them or went for the easy stories. So instead of phoning or emailing people, I\n\nproduced comics that explained what I thought [about arcades], what I wanted to know, and which illustrated some of the great stories I’d already heard. I printed loads of these comics and gave them to anyone I could. After doing this for a year or two, I got a phone call from a chap called Phil Silver who is high up in the British Amusement Trade Body Organisation (BACTA), who said that he’d seen the comic and thought that BACTA’s members, who make up almost all arcades in Britain, would be interested in talking. He gave me a list of names and numbers and that was where it all began. Your book is being published by MIT Press. Will our readers enjoy it even if they are not doing a PhD?\n\n» Arcade Britannia was part of this year’s London Design Biennale at Somerset House and included an interactive arcade inside an Electrocoin Xenon arcade cabinet.\n\nMIT Press might be an academic publisher, but they really don’t like boring books! It’s written in an engaging way, and I’ve spent a huge amount of time working through the archives, interviewing people, and finding the most interesting and important stories. If you’ve ever wondered about how arcades came to be, about the people who brokered the deals that meant we got to play the games we played, and if the arcade is stamped on your very soul – then it’s a book for you.

Nick Thorpe hops into his trusty time machine to bring you all the exciting action from this heavyweight holiday season\n\nNEWS DECEMBER 2006 Between 2-12 December, the bodies of Tania Nicol, Gemma Adams, Anneli Alderton, Annette Nicholls and Paula Clennell were found in the Ipswich area. On 19 December, forklift driver Steve Wright was charged with murdering the five women, all of whom were sex workers. He was convicted at trial in 2008 and sentenced to a whole life tariff, and was later arrested in 2021 on suspicion of the 1999 murder of Victoria Hall. Stars In Their Eyes concluded its 16-year run on ITV on 23 December, hosted by Cat Deeley who had taken over from Matthew Kelly in 2004. The show’s future was reported to be under consideration in the summer, but an ITV spokesperson had denied that the show would be axed. The final show was a celebrity special, won by BBC Radio 2 presenter Mark Radcliffe performing as Shane McGowan of The Pogues. On 30 December, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was executed by hanging, having been convicted of crimes against humanity by the Iraqi High Tribunal. The occasion was marked with controversy – Saudi Arabia criticised the Iraqi government for proceeding with the execution during an Islamic holy day, and footage of the execution soon appeared online.\n\n14 | RETRO GAMER\n\n» Excited German gamers queue up to buy Wii consoles on launch day.\n\nTHE LATEST NEWS FROM DECEMBER 2006\n\nT\n\nhe Wii launched in Japan, Europe and Australia this month and got off to a very strong start. Japanese customers snapped up 371,936 consoles in the system’s first two days on sale, with Wii Sports being the most popular game with 176,880 copies sold. Nintendo announced that the Wii had sold out after just two days in Europe, setting a new record for the region’s fastest-selling\n\nconsole with 325,000 sales. The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess shifted 240,000 copies, making it the region’s most-popular game. 32,901 Wii consoles were sold in the first four days in Australia, narrowly beating the national record of 30,000 set by the Xbox 360 earlier in 2006. The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess unsurprisingly took the top honours critically. Giving the game 9/10, Edge felt that\n\n» [Wii] Magazines weren’t impressed by Wii Sports, but families loved it.\n\nNintendo had attempted to create the definitive Zelda game, and that “the results not only display most of the strengths of previous games, but also provide pitch-perfect cast studies of their occasional flaws”, with examples including “some familiar padding”. The game scored 97% in Nintendo: The Ofﬁcial Magazine, which praised the “hardcore” difficulty level, whereas the 9.5/10 review in nRevolution claimed that it “offers as much to newcomers as it does long-time fans” – a point games™ echoed in its 9/10 review. Pack-in game Wii Sports received a mixed reception, with ONM’s 90% review praising it as a demonstration of the Wii technology, and games™ giving it 6/10 because of a lack of substance. The game also scored 7.0/10 in nRevolution and 7/10 in Edge. Other notable Wii releases included the motion-controlled party package Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz (8.4/10 nRev, 81% ONM, 7/10 Edge, 7/10 games™) and the\n\nBACK TO THE NOUGHTIES: DECEMBER 2006\n\nheavily hyped but underwhelming first-person shooter Red Steel (91% ONM, 6.1/10 nRev, 5/10 Edge, 5/10 games™). If Nintendo’s low-powered, family friendly vision of the future didn’t entice you, Gears Of War on the Xbox 360 likely did. The game scored 10/10 in X-360 and 9/10 in games™, with the latter saying that it “invigorates tactical shooting in the same way Resident Evil 4 did survival horror” and claiming that its co-operative play “could finally usurp Master Chief as the king of Xbox Live”. It also scored 9/10 in the Ofﬁcial Xbox 360 Magazine, and though Edge complained of an “uninspiring story arc” and a “strikingly anticlimactic finale”, it was still sufficiently impressed to give the game 8/10. Anyone sticking with the PS2 had some fine games to keep them occupied. Rockstar shone a light on the ugly reality of secondary school life with Canis Canem Edit, formerly known as Bully. Edge said that it was “utterly relentless in its provision of new activities and distractions to the point that it’s hard not to become absorbed”, giving it 8/10. Ofﬁcial PlayStation 2 Magazine felt that “in almost every way, this is an antibullying game” and gave it 9/10. It also scored 8/10 in games™ and 87% in Play. The minigame-laden\n\nDECEMBER 2006\n\n» [PSP] A private portable retreat into the Eighties via Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories does sound like a pretty good time.\n\ntheme park sim Thrillville also scored well, earning 8/10 from Ofﬁcial PS2 and 82% from Play, which felt it to be “one of the most diverse games on PS2”. PSP owners had plenty to enjoy too. Shooter Killzone Liberation opted for an overhead view rather than the first-person perspective of its PS2 progenitor, and scored 9/10 in Ofﬁcial PS2, 83% in Play, 7/10 in games™ and 7/10 in Edge. Openworld crime sequel Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories earned 10/10 from Ofﬁcial PS2, 97% in Go Play, 96% in Play, 8/10 in games™ and 7/10 in Edge. The DS suffered a lack of focus, likely due to the Wii launch, with Grasshopper’s action RPG Contact earning 5/10 in games™ and 82% in ONM.

If you give me a game that combines both, there’s a good chance that I will stay up until the early hours of the morning – and that makes Zenji a very dangerous game. Originally designed for the Atari 8-bit range by Matthew Hubbard, Activision had the game converted to a variety of systems and it’s the ColecoVision one that I first came across. The basic goal of the game is to ensure that every piece of the maze is connected to a central point, which you’ll achieve by moving around the maze and rotating sections one at a time. It’s easy to see which ones aren’t yet connected because they’re shown in grey, in contrast to the green ones that are connected, but it’s not so easy to actually connect them because you’ve got to reach them first. Changing the layout to gain access to disconnected sections can inadvertently cause more disconnections, and that’s without even considering the marauding enemies that inhabit the maze. If that all wasn’t enough, there’s also a time limit to contend with. It’s all fairly easy to manage in the early stages of the game, but the mazes start to increase in size as you make progress through the game and the action naturally becomes ever more frantic. Zenji is one of those games that doesn’t seem to get a ton of love these days, despite having been well received in its time. That might partially be down to the ColecoVision game’s release during the decline of the North American console market, but that doesn’t account for the other versions. It’s not the most spectacular-looking game, but if you’re looking for a fun and challenging maze game to try, this is one that is easy to recommend.\n\nTHE F MAKING O\n\nIN THE KNOW PUBLISHER: SEGA DEVELOPER: SEGA TECHNICAL INSTITUTE RELEASED: 1994 PLATFORM: MEGA DRIVE GENRE: PLATFORMER\n\n18 | RETRO GAMER\n\nTHE MAKING OF: SONIC 3 AND SONIC & KNUCKLES\n\nIN 1993, SEGA HAD A PROBLEM – EVEN WITH SONIC SPEED, IT COULDN’T FINISH ITS STAR’S MOST AMBITIOUS ADVENTURE ON TIME. THE SOLUTION? A PROJECT SO AMBITIOUS THAT IT HAS NEVER BEEN REPLICATED. SONIC TEAM’S TAKASHI IIZUKA TELLS US HOW IT WAS DONE\n\n» [Mega Drive] This infamous object requires you to move the d-pad to move it, but that’s not obvious.\n\nDEVELOPER HIGHLIGHTS SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2 SYSTEM: MEGA DRIVE YEAR: 1992 SONIC SPINBALL SYSTEM: MEGA DRIVE YEAR: 1993 COMIX ZONE PICTURED SYSTEM: MEGA DRIVE YEAR: 1995\n\n» Takashi Iizuka, Sonic series producer at Sonic Team.\n\nonic The Hedgehog 2 was a game that really redefined the standards for a blockbuster videogame release – its extravagant hype campaign and co-ordinated international release were very uncommon at the time, but they paid dividends for Sega as the game sold millions of copies worldwide. But the creation of that game was fraught – a large number of concepts were scrapped outright, a prototype cartridge was stolen from a toy fair in New York and major changes were still being made during the final week of development. One of the big problems was the choice to develop the game at Sega Technical Institute in the USA, with a mixed Japanese and American development team – in Retro Gamer 175, game designer Hirokazu Yasuhara told us that, “Trying to establish a multicultural development team was meaningful, but it should not be done for a project with a very tight schedule.” The result was that while Sonic development continued at STI, the American developers would split off to work on Sonic Spinball, while Sonic The Hedgehog 3 was developed at Sega Technical Institute in the USA with almost exclusively Japanese staff. Key returning staff from Sonic 2 included Yuji Naka, now a producer as well as lead programmer, Hirokazu Yasuhara, credited as director as well as senior game designer, and senior programmer Masanobu Yamamoto. Takashi Iizuka, today the Sonic series producer at Sonic Team,\n\ncame on board as a senior game designer having previously worked on Golden Axe III. “I was living outside of Japan for the first time during Sonic 3’s development, so it was one culture shock after another on a daily basis for me,” he recalls. “I hadn’t even heard of Halloween before, so it was really surprising to see everyone at STI sitting down for serious meetings while dressed up in costumes.” Just like Sonic 2, the third main game was also subject to major time pressures – in part because of experimental work that the team did during early development. Feeling that the previous game had already come close to the limits of the Mega Drive, Sonic 3 was originally slated to use the same enhancement chip as Virtua Racing. Speaking to Japan’s Sega Magazine in 1997, with translation from shmuplations.com, Yuji Naka said, “Up till about June of 1993, the Sonic 3 development included the SVP. It featured isometric 3D graphics, and you could rotate and turn the game field.” Of course, this design was scrapped, with Naka continuing, “Unfortunately, in June we realised that development of the SVP chip probably wouldn’t be finished by the end of the year. So we abandoned all the programming and » [Mega Drive] The burning of Angel Island Zone makes for a dramatic transition in the game’s opening moments.\n\n» [Mega Drive] Here comes Knuckles, in one of his trademark ambushes on Sonic and Tails.\n\nRETRO GAMER | 19\n\n“SONIC’S PLAYSTYLE WAS HORIZONTAL, WHILE KNUCKLES’ CLIMBING AND GLIDING ALLOWED US TO BRING IN VERTICAL PLAY”\n\nwork we’d done up to then. In the remaining six months we had for Sonic 3, we had to start entirely from zero and re-do everything.” Virtua Racing ultimately launched just six weeks after Sonic The Hedgehog 3, but in that interview, Naka claimed that meeting a February 1994 release date was crucial because Sega had entered into a $20 million promotional deal with McDonald’s for that month. Takashi Iizuka confirms that “it wasn’t realistic to change that” promotion to coincide with a slightly later release, but also he offers a different reason for the abandonment of the enhancement chip, telling us, “Support for the SVP chip was nothing more than a research experiment to see if we could get Sonic moving in 3D. In the end we found that it could only handle a polygon count similar to Virtua Racing, so we decided that it wasn’t a good fit for a Sonic game.” egardless of the precise reasoning for abandoning the SVP chip, the result was the same – by June 1993, there was a tight deadline to meet and no substantial work done. The team would settle on revisiting the tried-andtrue platform design. “We wanted to make Sonic 3 more epic than Sonic 2,” says Iizuka. “Specifically, that meant strengthening the story elements, adding uniqueness to the Act 1 and 2 pairs, adding a new playable character,\n\n» Some shield concepts, like Magnet and Lightning, ended up being merged together.\n\n20 | RETRO GAMER\n\n» [Mega Drive] An aerial boss battle in which Tails carries Sonic was a brand-new concept for Sonic 3.\n\nexpanding each stage, adding new routes for each character and enhancing 2P versus play.” Some of these enhancements were very straightforward. Distinct musical arrangements and subtle background changes helped to differentiate Act 1 from Act 2 of each stage, as did the addition of more bosses. “We didn’t want Act 1 and Act 2 to feel too repetitive, but rather have each reach its own peak. Act 2 featured battles with Dr Eggman [Robotnik], so for Act 1 we created battles against just his robots, spicing up the fun when it came to boss battles,” Iizuka recalls. The new playable character was Knuckles, designed by Takashi Yuda. “We wanted to create a character of a similar size and stature to rival Sonic beyond the Mecha Sonic and Metal Sonic characters of the previous games. Those characters were very cool, but Knuckles let us create an antagonist where we could really shape his personality and take on the journey that we did,” says Iizuka. “As for his abilities, we were always keen to explore how alternative gameplay mechanics\n\n» Here’s a concept document showing various attack patterns that Mecha Sonic could potentially use.\n\n» [Mega Drive] Swimming is very helpful to Tails – that Robotnik monitor rather less so.\n\nand traversal could make an impact on Sonic’s traditional level design, and we felt that his ability to glide and climb gave players new ways and reasons to play each zone.” Those abilities actually gave Sonic 3’s level designs a whole new shape. “Knuckles’ ability to punch through rocks allowed us to create routes that only he could use,” Iizuka explains. “Sonic’s playstyle was horizontal, while Knuckles’ climbing and gliding allowed us to bring in vertical play. He allows for different experiences from Sonic, such as climbing walls to find secret areas or gliding between walls to navigate a way upward.” Even if you’re not playing as Knuckles, this is apparent. Sonic 3’s stages are massive, sprawling things compared to those of previous games, with designs that are up to twice as tall as those featured in Sonic 2. Sonic 3 increased the use of vertical wrap-around in its stages compared to Sonic 2, allowing for more stages with a feeling of even greater height. Adding Knuckles also aided the storytelling aspect of the game, giving an extra dimension to the plot. “We had the idea from the beginning that Knuckles would first be an enemy but later become playable. So we worked Knuckles into the story and had him appear as an enemy from the outset,” Iizuka recalls. The first two games had used short in-engine scenes to depict key events and that technique was expanded here – Knuckles managed to dispossess Sonic of the Chaos Emeralds in the game’s intro, and showed » This drawing shows the game flow, including Carnival Night Zone’s lost transition to Flying Battery Zone. up frequently in scripted\n\nTHE MAKING OF: SONIC 3 AND SONIC & KNUCKLES\n\nTAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT SONIC’S FEISTY FOE-TURNED-FRIEND Q Knuckles takes guarding Angel Island and the Chaos Emeralds seriously, but being the last survivor of his civilisation, he’s socially naive and has been easily misled by Robotnik a few times.\n\nKnuckles is one of the most popular characters in the Sonic cast, as fans instantly took to his roughand-ready demeanour and cool abilities.

Boss battles required more strategy, including some encounters in which the enemies needed to be tricked into hurting themselves. Sonic and Tails had redesigned sprites to go with a refreshed graphical direction, and the game was even set to feature music from Michael Jackson as well as Sega’s highly capable composers – read more about that in The Jackson Factor. Best of all, Sega had managed to keep everything highly secret in a way that it hadn’t for Sonic 2. ut as the autumn of 1993 wore on, it became clear that it simply wasn’t going to be possible to finish the game as planned while meeting that all-important February release date. In the Sega Magazine interview, Naka stated that conversations about splitting Sonic 3 across two cartridges came “at the very end of development” and that the method to combine cartridges was figured out “at the very, very last minute”, with the game’s programming revised to take the Lock-On cartridge into account. “It was a very difficult decision to split the game into two cartridges. One major issue was how to make a cohesive product when it came to the second half of the game,” says Iizuka. “Data couldn’t be carried over if we used two separate cartridges, making the Knuckles routes we had built into the Sonic 3 stages unplayable. That’s where the idea came for the Lock-On cartridge, allowing the two cartridges to work together. I remember thinking it was an insane idea! I was very impressed with Sega being able to make it a reality.” The Sonic 3 prototype found in 2019 suggests that the process of splitting the games started about a month before the final build.\n\nQ Here’s that “helper mechanic” in action – Tails is scripted to fly down early in the stage, giving Sonic the opportunity to catch a lift to higher ground. It’s a little clunky in action.\n\nJUST HOW DID SEGA WORK KNUCKLES INTO SONIC 2? Q “Even I was surprised by the idea to use Lock-On cartridges to make Knuckles appear in Sonic 2,” says Takashi Iizuka. “Nowadays it’s easy to update older games with a patch, but you obviously can’t change the code on a game contained in a ROM cartridge. The programmers who made it happen were just amazing.” Indeed, the inclusion of Knuckles in Sonic 2 seems technologically miraculous – Sonic 3 had been created with the Lock-On cartridge in mind, but Sonic 2 was completed well before it was conceived. The truth is that the game was essentially rewritten to take Knuckles into account. When Sonic & Knuckles boots up, the first thing it does is to check the header data of the lockedon cartridge. If Sonic 2 is detected, control is passed to a secondary 256KB chip in the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge, which contains the vast majority of program data required for Knuckles\n\nin Sonic The Hedgehog 2 – level layouts, programming for Knuckles’ moves and more. The Sonic 2 cartridge mostly provides art assets, although the sound driver is run directly from the Sonic 2 cartridge as well. So if that was possible for Sonic 2, what about the original game? “I’m not a programmer so I don’t know the details, but I heard that it wasn’t possible because the data was structured differently in Sonic 1. That’s why the new concept for Blue Sphere was created,” replies Iizuka. When Sonic 1 is detected, a special mode is activated with thousands of bonus stages to try. Any Mega Drive game under 16 Mbit will also trigger a limited version of this, generating a stage based on the ROM header data, but those over 16 Mbit won’t because the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge doesn’t map the area of data including the header.\n\n» [Mega Drive] New power-ups rewarded players for using Knuckles to explore previously inaccessible areas.\n\n» [Mega Drive] Knuckles replaces Sonic on the Casino Night Zone reels in a neat little touch.\n\nQ The background for Hydrocity Zone Act 1 was initially green and grey with plenty of plant life, but it was completely redrawn for the final game.\n\nRETRO GAMER | 23\n\nIS THE KING OF POP’S MUSIC REALLY IN SONIC 3? Q Michael Jackson had a long-standing association with Sega during his life, from the Moonwalker games to Michael Jackson In Scramble Training and Space Channel 5. It is also pretty well established that for some time, the pop icon was involved in creating music for Sonic 3 – Sega figures including Yuji Naka, Naoto Ohshima and Roger Hector have all confirmed that he was linked with the project, as have Brad Buxer, Doug Grigsby III and Cirocco Jones, songwriters credited on both Sonic 3 and Michael Jackson’s music. What remains contentious is whether or not any of Jackson’s music actually made it to the finished product. Michael Jackson’s name does not appear in the game’s credits list, though this is no surprise – Sega would have wanted to distance itself from him due to allegations of child sexual abuse that arose during the game’s development, which were only settled days before release. Roger Hector stated in issue 244 of Retro Gamer that it was hastily removed at the request of Sega’s Japanese headquarters, with Howard Drossin replacing “basically 16 weeks’ worth of work, in a week and a half”. In a 2016 interview with the Huffington Post, Brad Buxer offered an alternative explanation, claiming that Jackson “wanted his name taken off the credits if they couldn’t get it to sound better”. However, in a 2022 interview with the Abbey Road Institute Paris, Buxer stated,\n\n“I’d been doing all the Sega Sonic The Hedgehog cues » The 2020 vinyl pressing of The because the way Jetzons’ Hard Times used Ice Michael works is, Cap Zone artwork on the sleeve. he’ll tell Sega he’ll do it and then he says, ‘Brad, you do it.’ Right? So I think we did one cue together with Michael. One. And the rest, I had to do it myself.” Buxer goes on to say that 41 musical cues had been created. He also says that for Stranger In Moscow, the song closely linked to Sonic 3’s credits tune, he had played the verse and subsequently written the chorus in half an hour during a phone call with Jackson, who had “nothing in mind for that, nothing”. One tune that Jackson definitely had no involvement in was Ice Cap Zone’s theme, which was based on the song Hard Times by Brad Buxer’s old band The Jetzons. So is Michael Jackson’s music really in Sonic 3? If you think of Michael Jackson as a collective creative enterprise which covers the songwriters, session musicians and others that he worked with, then it’s hard to deny that claim. But as for the man himself, the chances seem slim. We know that only a relatively small number of Sonic 3’s tracks were replaced in the Jackson-less versions of the game, so if he really did contribute to just one of 41 tunes, there’s every chance it was never used to begin with.\n\n» [Mega Drive] Carnival Night Zone is one of the three zones that had its music replaced in Sonic Origins.\n\n24 | RETRO GAMER\n\n» [Mega Drive] You can lead this buffoonish rock monster into defeating itself, if you like.\n\nThe decision to split the game had some knock-on effects in the game design. Flying Battery Zone was originally positioned between Carnival Night Zone and Ice Cap Zone, but was moved to become the second stage of Sonic & Knuckles instead. “I don’t think there were any other stages that were added or moved, but we did make some spec changes,” says Iizuka. “The Launch Base boss was an Eggman boss as usual, but splitting the game made it the last stage of Sonic 3, so we added Big Arms. Mushroom Hill became the first stage of Sonic & Knuckles, so we readjusted the difficulty to make it easier than originally planned.” Two bonus stages were left unused to be finished later on, and most significantly Knuckles was held back as a playable character and appeared solely as an antagonist outside of Competition Mode. onic 3 released on 2 February 1994 in North America, and followed to the UK on 24 February, with some European countries and Australia following in March. In Japan, where the Mega Drive was less popular, the game finally released on 27 May. Despite its truncated nature, the game was very wellreceived by the majority of gaming magazines. Mean Machines Sega gave it 94%, with Radion Automatic saying, “The whole game is packed with new ideas and the levels, whilst few in number, are absolutely huge.” Mega also noted the size of the levels and praised the “new and bizarre power-ups” and concluded by saying that “this is probably about as good as Sonic can possibly get”. By this point, critics had developed a fatigue for platform games in general and Sonic in specific, but Sonic 3 proved good enough to overcome it. Computer & Video Games awarded the game 94%, with reviewer Deniz Ahmet admitting that he was “all set to be highly critical of Sonic 3 after hearing that it was more of the same”, but found “there are so many new and imaginative ideas that I have no complaints”. Likewise, Sega Zone’s Jonathan Nash “tried to hate it”, but found that “my pre-prepared words of disapproval were forgotten” upon playing it, and gave it 93%. Where complaints arose, they were mostly\n\nTHE MAKING OF: SONIC 3 AND SONIC & KNUCKLES\n\n» [Mega Drive] In this cutscene, Knuckles is made aware of Robotnik’s shocking betrayal.

Mean Machines Sega said that “completing the game without the Emeralds is not very difficult at all”, while Sega Zone felt that you could “quite easily storm through the game in an afternoon”.

That play Sonic 3 & Knuckles seems a little unwieldy. on modern consoles, the only way to do it is as part of Sonic Origins, which was released in 2022. The compilation also includes Sonic 1, 2 and CD, and all of them are presented in remastered form via the Retro Engine, with FMV intros, widescreen display, the ability to retry special stages and a brand-new Mission Mode. There are plenty of goodies to unlock too, including concept art, music and videos. We reviewed the compilation in issue 235 and gave it 80%, saying that while the new versions are “mostly very good” a variety of changes and minor bugs meant that “Mega Drive purists may wish to consider other options”. Sonic Origins has recently been upgraded with the Plus Expansion Pack DLC, for £8.99. This gives you access to Knuckles in Sonic CD, Amy Rose as a new playable character in all of the main games, and 12 extra games from the Game Gear – and unlike the main games, these aren’t enhanced ports. They play fine, but there are some oddities with the sound emulation and none of the visual options you might hope for. Here’s a look at all of the additional games.\n\n26 | RETRO GAMER\n\nSONIC THE HEDGEHOG\n\nSONIC CHAOS\n\nSONIC THE HEDGEHOG 2\n\nSONIC TRIPLE TROUBLE\n\nQ Sonic’s 8-bit debut is like a remix of the Mega Drive game with a mixture of familiar and new stages, all with unique layouts and bosses. It doesn’t have spectacular loops, but it’s more challenging and has unique level designs including a vertical climb, a maze and an autoscrolling stage.\n\nQ This is totally different to the Mega Drive’s Sonic 2, with Tails not being a playable character. The Game Gear version is notoriously tough, with many players failing to pass the first boss. Even then, you’ll need all the Chaos Emeralds to take on Robotnik in Crystal Egg Zone.\n\nQ Tails joins Sonic for this adventure, complete with his ability to fly. For the first time in the 8-bit games, Chaos Emeralds are earned in special stages rather than found in regular gameplay. This is a good starting point, as it’s a relatively easy game compared to its predecessors.\n\nQ New antagonists ahoy, as Sonic and Tails are pursued by Knuckles and Nack The Weasel – or Fang The Sniper in Japan, where he is a jerboa. There’s some great music here and Sonic gets to go snowboarding again, and the level of challenge is on the easier side.\n\nTHE MAKING OF: SONIC 3 AND SONIC & KNUCKLES\n\nLeadbetter called it “the perfect buy if you already own all the other Sonic games”, Radion Automatic recommended that those “looking for something to renew your faith in the genre” try Dynamite Headdy instead. In Mean Machines Sega, Steve Merrett felt it was “just more of the same and, consequently, is likely to be usurped by Sega’s new hero, Dynamite Headdy”, and offered a review score of 85%. Likewise, in Games World’s 83% review, Dave Perry felt that “our once plucky blue hero is starting to look tired”. The brilliance of Sonic & Knuckles was that while it was substantial enough to work as a stand-alone game, the Lock-On cartridge made it a unique offering at a time when expansion packs were typically a technical impossibility in the console market. What had started off as a problem ended up being a creative and commercial triumph. Both halves of the project were fine games taken alone, but elevated when joined together – Sonic 3 owners got a great reason to revisit the game, and got benefits like Tails and the save game feature that didn’t exist in Sonic & Knuckles alone. Add the other benefits of the Lock-On cartridge – see Locked And Loaded for those – and Sonic & Knuckles was the perfect addition to a Sonic collection. For Sega, it provided not only a key game for the holiday season of 1994, but a way of shifting more copies of back-catalogue games. Overall, Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles combined sold four million copies.\n\n“THE IDEA WAS TO ADD KNUCKLES AS A PLAYABLE CHARACTER AFTER THE PLAYER COMPLETED SONIC’S STORYLINE”\n\nonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles later made their way to PC in 1997 as part of Sonic & Knuckles Collection, which offers the ability to play either game individually or both together. This version features MIDI music and replaces some of the tracks attributed to Michael Jackson’s team with tunes that were present in a prototype build of the Mega Drive game. The games arrived on the Saturn as part of Sonic Jam the same year with no substantial changes, and emulated Mega Drive versions were a staple of Sega’s compilations until 2010, when re-releases dried up. Sonic 3 & Knuckles finally returned in combined and remastered form as part of the Sonic Origins compilation in 2022. This version featured new arrangements of the music found in the Sonic 3 prototype and Sonic & Knuckles Collection, suggesting that while no legal action has ever been made public, music rights were at the heart of that lengthy absence. Looking back at Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, Iizuka’s only quibble with the end\n\n» [Mega Drive] Here’s a game with gacha mechanics that we’re actually happy to play.\n\nproduct has been resolved. “I do wish we had been able to sell Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles as one complete game. So I was happy that we were able to accomplish that with Sonic Origins last year,” he tells us. But the split release has done nothing to damage the standing of the game among fans – while Sonic 2 is arguably the classic Sonic game that has the most appeal among the general gaming population, Sonic fans tend to hold Sonic 3 & Knuckles as the best of the classics. “It makes me truly happy to hear that,” Iizuka says. “Many of the people on the development team were veterans who had worked on Sonic 1 and Sonic 2, and I think it’s the result of everyone’s determination to make a game that outshines the previous two. I’m proud that I was able to be a part of Sonic 3’s development.”\n\nSONIC BLAST\n\nSONIC SPINBALL\n\nQ This handheld version of Sonic’s pinball spin-off uses the same game structure and level themes as the Mega Drive game, but with new stage layouts and completely different bonus stages. It’s a surprisingly good rendition of the game and adds welcome variety to the compilation.\n\nSONIC DRIFT 2\n\nQ The second attempt at doing a Sonic racing game on the Game Gear turned out considerably better than the first, thanks to more tracks, more racers and a better handling model. Banked corners, tunnels and point-to-point races help to set it apart from other 8-bit racing games.\n\nTAILS’ SKY PATROL\n\nSONIC LABYRINTH\n\nSONIC DRIFT\n\nTAILS ADVENTURES\n\nDR ROBOTNIK’S MEAN BEAN MACHINE\n\nQ Sonic and Knuckles star in this platformer, one of the very last Game Gear games to be released. The choice to use pre-rendered 3D sprites for this was a bold one, and realistically probably not the wisest one. The gameplay also fails to live up to the standards set by its 8-bit predecessors.\n\nQ This isometric action game has Sonic hunting for keys against the clock, in order to escape to the next stage. Many fans dislike it for its slow pace, but it’s not too bad – the only major issue being the utterly obtuse method of obtaining the final Chaos Emerald required for the good ending.\n\nQ Sonic’s racing debut takes the zones from the original game and repurposes them as racing circuits. If you’re familiar with the Game Gear’s take on Super Monaco GP you’ll feel at home here, but this one wasn’t particularly brilliant, and the original Game Gear release never left Japan.\n\nQ Don’t write off Tails’ star turn for its slow pace, as it’s a rather absorbing puzzle platformer and something of a forgotten gem. Tails can pick up various items as he explores the world, allowing him to open new paths ahead and in previously completed stages that he revisits.\n\nQ Originally released in Japan only, this game has you flying Tails around obstacle courses pursuing the evil Witchcart, using a ring to destroy enemies and use items. There aren’t many levels to beat but you’ll struggle to see them all due to the game’s unexpectedly brutal difficulty level.\n\nQ Here’s the Sonicflavoured version of Puyo Puyo, and it’s a mighty fine puzzle game. Match four beans of the same colour to pop them, then create combos to attack your opponent. This version has a Puzzle Mode with 30 challenges, which the Mega Drive version lacks.\n\nRETRO GAMER | 27\n\nSUBSCRIBE TODAY AND RECEIVE A FREE SAGA LAPTOP BACKPACK\n\nThe best elements and amenities passed down from the industryleading STM family tree of functional laptop bags Suspended tech cells & ample storage space\n\nGIFT WORTH\n\n£55\n\nPockets, pockets, pockets!

One of my favourites is Moon Patrol and I’ve been playing it a lot lately thanks to its inclusion on Blaze Entertainment’s Irem Arcade 1 (which also features the aforementioned R-Type). While I can’t recall the year I first encountered Moon Patrol, I do remember the location – the annual funfair at King’s Park. Every year it would turn up like clockwork and every year my dear grandparents would take me along so I could experience the dodgems, try and win a goldfish and play the many arcade games that were there. One of the reasons that Moon Patrol stood out so appealingly, was because it was situated next to a Space Invaders cabinet. As much as I enjoyed Taito’s game, it looked utterly ancient next to Moon Patrol, even though only four years separated them. I begged my nan for ten pence and hastily shoved it into the coin slot. Trundling across the moon’s surface, taking down overhead enemies and jumping over craters was great fun and when my lives were spent I hassled my nan for another ten pence so I could play again. I really enjoyed playing Moon Patrol and would always seek it out at arcades, particularly when I went on my yearly trips to Porthcawl in South Wales with my grandparents. In fact, when I was much older, I took my future wife to the seaside resort and made her visit every seafront arcade that was still there in the hopes of finding both Moon Patrol and Star Wars. We didn’t find Irem’s game, but we did find Atari’s, not that she was interested. I still enjoy Moon Patrol’s mechanics today and while it’s not the fast-paced thrill ride I remember from my youth it’s still an exceptionally solid shooter. And thankfully, I no longer have to go on pilgrimages to find it, as I can take it wherever I go.\n\nULTIMATE GUIDE\n\n» The game’s venerable creator, Mike Singleton, sadly passed away in 2012, aged 61.\n\nTHE LATE MIKE SINGLETON WAS PEERLESS WHEN IT CAME TO CREATING WHOLE WORLDS ON JUST A SPOOL OF TAPE, AND THE LORDS OF MIDNIGHT REMAINS ONE OF HIS BEST-LOVED WORKS.

Your imagination does the rest.\n\n32 | RETRO GAMER\n\nWORDS BY MARTYN CARROLL emember in the early Eighties when developers invented fantastic names for the technical advances that set their games apart? We had Sandy White’s Softsolid 3D, Ultimate’s Filmation and Melbourne House even coined the term ‘4D graphics’ around 25 years before Sony had the same silly idea. And then there was Mike Singleton’s The Lords Of Midnight, which was billed as “the world’s first Epic game”. Elsewhere, publisher Beyond described it as a “living fantasy novel”. When the game was released for the ZX Spectrum in summer 1984, players quickly discovered that this was no case of hyperbole – The Lords Of Midnight was indeed epic. It featured a huge game map consisting of 3,904 locations, and at each location the\n\nplayer could turn in eight directions, resulting in almost 32,000 first-person views. The game also featured 32 controllable characters and 16 different terrain types, and Mike somehow crammed all this content into around 41KB of available memory. As for the “living fantasy novel” claim, this too was borne out. Mike was heavily inspired by Tolkien’s The Lord Of The Rings, of course, and the game featured a similar narrative structure. In Mike’s version, the once lush land of Midnight had been forever frozen by an evil sorcerer named Doomdark and it was up to the lords of the free people, led by Luxor The Moonprince and his son Morkin, to rally together and defeat the enemy. There were actually three ways to secure victory. The quickest way was to complete Morkin’s\n\nULTIMATE GUIDE: THE LORDS OF MIDNIGHT\n\n“TO HELP IMMERSE PLAYERS, MIKE DEVISED A TECHNIQUE CALLED ‘LANDSCAPING’ WHICH CONSTRUCTED EACH VIEW USING A COMBINATION OF TERRAIN ELEMENTS”\n\nHOW THE VARIOUS VERSIONS STACK UP\n\nZX SPECTRUM\n\nQ The original version was a revelation on release, cramming so much game into the machine’s meagre memory. The graphics were also cleverly designed and presented to overcome attribute issues. Mike had real affection for the Spectrum and it shows.\n\n» A broad map to the land of Midnight was printed on the back of the enclosed booklet.\n\nAMSTRAD CPC\n\nQ This is a straight port by Rick Brown that suffers from slow screen updates (looking around and moving takes a smidge too long compared to the original). The use of Mode 1 graphics results in some unfortunate colour choices too, but it plays well and that’s what counts.\n\nC64\n\nQ Credited to Tag and The Kid (Anthony Taglione and Malcolm Hellon), this is a poorly optimised port that’s even slower than the CPC version. It does introduce one neat feature – the sun is shown in the sky, giving players a visual indicator of how much daylight is left.\n\n» [ZX Spectrum] A warm welcome awaits when you finally reach Doomdark’s stronghold.\n\nquest, where a small fellowship ventured north to the Tower Of Doom to destroy a powerful ring – sorry, a crown, a powerful crown that’s the source of Doomdark’s power. With some luck (rudimentary AI meant skirmishes with enemies varied on each attempt) it was possible to complete the quest in as little as nine game days. Taking far longer was the war scenario. Here, as Luxor, you ignored the quest and instead plotted to overthrow Doomdark’s evil lair, the Citadel Of Ushgarak in the north. Obviously Doomdark controlled a huge army of foul folk and one did not simply walk into his backyard. Instead you first had to travel around the southern region and recruit the lords with the largest armies before tactically pushing north, picking off Doomdark’s hoard as they\n\nIOS/ANDROID\n\nQ Chris Wild’s mobile version is a wonderful way to revisit Midnight on touch-screen devices.

Everything here is bigger – there are now 6,144 locations and 128 playable characters. It’s also cleverer, with updated AI giving characters more freedom and intelligence. Unfortunately this also makes the game more random, preventing some of the strategic planning that you could do in the original.\n\nTHE EYE OF THE MOON\n\nQ The trilogy capper was planned from the beginning but it sadly never materialised. Mike did some work on the game and it was to feature the biggest map yet with more than 16,000 locations split into 12 kingdoms, with a challenge to complete in each one. This is the only screenshot ever published, showing a new system Mike developed for giving each of the proposed 256 lords different facial features.\n\nTHE CITADEL\n\nQ Developed by Mike’s Maelstrom team and released for PC in 1995, the third game is a radical update that features 3D graphics and real-time movement. For fans of the original games it was perhaps too radical – and too buggy. Mike was adamant of two things: the game needed an extra six months of development, and it was NOT The Eye Of The Moon. That was a separate, as yet unrealised project.\n\n34 | RETRO GAMER\n\n» [ZX Spectrum] Night has fallen and the foul are abroad! Time to take shelter ‘till dawn.\n\nmarched south to greet you. The third way was known as a ‘complete epic’, where you combined both the micro and macro approaches by first seizing the crown, but not destroying it, and then defeating Doomdark in battle. For the ultimate victory you could complete the above while also attempting to recruit all 32 lords and take control of every keep and citadel in the land. Good luck with that one. he Lords Of Midnight combined elements of adventure, strategy and simulation to excellent effect, with it all taking place in a world » Author Drew Wager has released that felt very real and dangerous. novels based on The Lords Of To help immerse players in the setting, Mike Midnight and Doomdark’s Revenge, devised a technique called ‘Landscaping’ which with The Citadel and The Eye Of The Moon currently in planning. constructed each view using a combination of terrain elements and places of interest – mountains, forests, villages, towers, citadels and so on. For Landscaping Mike was driven by two principles. Firstly, it needed to be functional, so that the views provided the player with the visual information they needed to plan their next “FOR THE VARIOUS PLACE move. They were not just pretty pictures, there to decorate the NAMES, MIKE TACKED scene. Secondly, it needed to RANDOM SYLLABLES be fast.

In fact, Mike once revealed that his main impetus for Landscaping was Melbourne House’s The Hobbit adventure game. He couldn’t believe how long it took to draw the location images on the screen and knew he could do better. aving dabbled in BASIC for a few days to make sure Landscaping was feasible, Mike then drew the map of Midnight, using Tolkien’s Middle-earth maps as an inspiration. For the various place names, he simply tacked random syllables together until he came up with combinations that sounded right. He then spent three weeks writing the short, fivechapter story – the Midnight Chronicles – that established the scenario and would be included inside the lavish game package. Finally, with the map drawn up and the backstory in place, Mike spent the next seven months programming the game and bringing his world to life. As he finessed the game, Mike’s friend at Beyond, Terry Pratt, began generating excitement with a series of teaser ads. “Who are The Lords Of Midnight?” asked the first, in February 1984. A follow-up ad mentioned “Landscaping”, another dropped that “Epic game” claim. The first review appeared in the 7 June 1984 issue of Popular Computing Weekly where it was\n\nCITADEL OF USHGARAK\n\nQ If you’re looking to win the War Of The Solstice then your priority is to capture Doomdark’s stronghold, which lies to the far north of Midnight in the Plains Of Despair.

To avoid detection, Morkin must approach the tower alone.\n\nKEEP OF BLOOD\n\nQ Situated in the Plains Of Blood, in the middle of the map, this is a strategic location for anyone attempting the popular ‘Blood defence’ strategy, where you attempt to repel Doomdark’s forces as they pour south between the Mountains of Dodrak and Gorgrath.\n\nRETRO GAMER | 35\n\nCORLETH THE FEY FAWKRIN THE SKULKRIN\n\nFARFLAME THE DRAGON LORD\n\n» [iOS] The mobile version features a considered visual style that respects Mike’s original 8-bit graphics.\n\nDEVELOPER Q&A CHRIS WILD HAS CONVERTED THE GAME TO MULTIPLE PLATFORMS\n\nWHAT’S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SERIES AND HOW DID YOU FIRST CONNECT WITH MIKE SINGLETON? I used to play Lords and Doomdark when I was about 14, and a few years later, around 1990, I became interested in how they worked. I reverse engineered them and got them running on a 286 PC. I was going to make them available for people to play via FTP or some such, but I wanted Mike’s permission. I was using some of the Usenet newsgroups and asked if anyone knew how I could contact him. Jon Ritman got in touch and passed on my request to Mike, who agreed. Then about 1994 I was working at SCi and a producer from Domark contacted me saying they were releasing The Citadel and that Mike thought it would be a great idea to include the DOS games to allow people to play them. MOVING FORWARD, HOW DID THE MOBILE VERSION COME ABOUT? When the iPhone was first released, I knew it was a game-changer. The first thing that came to mind was developing Lords for it, so I contacted Mike and made the suggestion. Unfortunately, that suggestion lay dormant until Mike revisited the issue in 2011 and asked if I would like to collaborate on the game. WAS THE PLAN TO FAITHFULLY RECREATE THE ORIGINAL GAME,\n\n» Programmer Chris Wild first ported Lords to the PC back in 1991 as a curiosity project.\n\nJUST WITH IMPROVED VISUALS AND UPDATED CONTROLS? It was important to me that the game retained the iconic 2D Landscaping style and remained turn-based. The Citadel ultimately fails because of the bad transition to 3D and real-time gameplay. Once Mike and I had agreed on those two core requirements, we then started thinking about many aspects of the game that could or should be changed. After Mike died in 2012, none of those goals seemed to matter anymore, and I felt that it would be difficult for me to justify some of the design changes that we might have implemented, without Mike being there to help back them up. It was at this stage that I decided to release the game in the format that you now see it in, more of a tribute to Mike.\n\n» [ZX Spectrum] Flinging the Ice Crown into Lake Mirrow is one way to end Doomdark’s reign of tyranny.\n\nYOU PREVIOUSLY TOLD US THAT YOU WERE CONSIDERING AN UPDATE OF THE CITADEL, TO BRING IT MORE IN LINE WITH THE FIRST TWO GAMES… I still am. I’ve been working on the water Landscaping routines but the process is slow. I’ve also been adding new features to Lords and Doomdark at the moment. This is the problem with doing this for fun and not for profit. If I could give up work things would be a lot quicker! Right now I’m thinking about next year being the 40th anniversary and how best to mark that.

This you on your quest and fare thee well!\n\nRETRO GAMER | 37\n\nOn one recent rainy night, we found a frog on our front path. We left it to enjoy the weather, and instead got to thinking – there must be some brilliant frogs in the gaming world, right? So here are some of our favourites…\n\nSCOOTER’S FROG\n\nQ Players of Ribbit King, or its Japan-only predecessor Kero Kero King, will be familiar with the brilliant golf-like sport of Frolf, in which your goal is to launch frogs into holes. The main character Scooter has a little green frog, who is subjected to snake attacks, whirlpools, lightning strikes and more during games, so we can’t help but admire his toughness.\n\nFROGGER\n\nQ Let’s start with the big guy on the scene – the amphibian antics of Konami’s arcade game were hugely entertaining in the Eighties, and home computers were inundated with direct clones. In fact, a conversion of Frogger was the final Genesis release in North America. A late-Nineties revival saw Frogger hop into millions of homes once again, proving that this frog’s got some legs.\n\nCOSMIC WARTOAD\n\nQ All toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads. Only one toad can claim the title of Cosmic Wartoad though, and it’s this guy from Denton Designs, whose goal is to rescue his queen from the Slime King. If you want to try it, we’ve learned that this ZX Spectrum favourite was released on Steam for a fairly low price.\n\nRASH, PIMPLE AND ZITZ\n\nQ They may not be Cosmic Wartoads, but the Battletoads are well-known for tackling some of the toughest tasks of any NES action heroes. They hung around for a few years, crossing over with the Double Dragon lads and even making their way to the arcade, before starring in a genuinely funny comeback game that hit the Xbox One in 2020.\n\n38 | RETRO GAMER\n\nRETRO GAMER’S FAVOURITE… FROGS\n\nPRINCE FLEASWALLOW Q After PaRappa smashes up his dad’s car, he needs to earn some money to replace it. Enter his new mentor Prince Fleaswallow, a laid-back frog who runs a stall at the flea market. Towards the end of the song he tells PaRappa that, “Money money money, is all you need,” revealing his hardcore capitalist nature.\n\nSLIPPY\n\nQ You may think that the perpetually imperilled member of the Star Fox team is a hindrance, what with him needing to be rescued all the time. Think about it this way – you’re the star of an action film, and Slippy has been specifically cast to make you look good. Make sure you get around to thanking him after the credits roll.\n\nSUPERFROG\n\nQ Team17’s Amiga platform hero is an easy guy to relate to. He drinks Lucozade, wears a cape, runs really fast and has green skin, which basically describes all of Nick’s weekend activities once he’s taken off his human disguise. He had a brief HD comeback and the original game was on GOG for a bit, but he’s disappeared again as of late.\n\nFROGGY\n\nQ If there’s one thing we love about Sonic Adventure, it’s Big The Cat’s story. The confused cat must fish for his woefully wayward companion Froggy, a little guy who just wants to swim around all day but keeps getting accosted on account of having swallowed a Chaos Emerald. Because of this, he’s grown a tail – no, we don’t know either.\n\nRETRO GAMER | 39\n\nA TRIBUTE TO\n\nLATER KNOWN AS GREMLIN INTERACTIVE, SHEFFIELD’S FINEST SOFTWARE HOUSE QUICKLY ESTABLISHED ITSELF WITH A STRING OF 8-BIT HITS. JOIN RETRO GAMER AS WE CELEBRATE THE MOST NOTABLE GAMES FROM GREMLIN THROUGHOUT THE EIGHTIES AND INTO THE NINETIES\n\nWords by Graeme Mason\n\nArtwork by Wil Overton\n\nH\n\n40 | RETRO GAMER\n\naving met as colleagues at the electrical distributor Laskys, Ian Stewart and Kevin Norburn decided there was enough momentum in the home-computer industry to set up their own shop, Just Micro. The store became a magnet for young programming talent, and soon Ian and Kevin’s ambitions exceeded the small building in Sheffield city centre. Their dream began in 1984 with Gremlin Graphics. Having already secured the services of Monty Mole creator Peter Harrap, Gremlin moved swiftly in gaining a second programmer, Commodore 64 whiz Tony Crowther, as an independent developer. Tony’s first game, Percy The Potty Pigeon, became Gremlin’s debut before mega-hit Wanted! Monty Mole cemented the publisher’s reputation. A conveyor belt of high-quality 8-bit hits followed as Gremlin recognised (and often employed) the talent behind some of its best\n\nIAN STEWART » Ian Stewart cofounded Gremlin Graphics in the early Eighties. He now runs Urbanscan, which specialises in mobile games.\n\ngames, many curiously British in their themes and gameplay. Monty Mole embraced the politics of the time (albeit with its star as an innocent bystander, well, not entirely innocent) while games such as Grumpy Gumphrey Supersleuth and Jack The Nipper, revelled in the roles of a jobsworth security guard and naughty toddler, respectively. As the inevitable licensed games crept in, Gremlin continued its role as a high-quality publisher, seldom releasing genuine clunkers. The new decade arrived, and a dedication to the established 16-bit formats, particularly the Amiga, strengthened Gremlin’s position further, and it subsequently embraced the 32-bit era with trailblazing titles such as Loaded and Actua Soccer. The company grew as it acquired outside developers, such as Imagitec Design and DMA Design, before being bought by Infogrames in 1999. But it all kicked off in 1984 with that little mole.\n\nA TRIBUTE TO: GREMLIN GRAPHICS\n\nWANTED! MONTY MOLE VARIOUS • 1984\n\nFOR A GOOD CAUSE\n"
