        "text": "Star Force is a vertical scrolling shooter by Tehkan (Tecmo). Released in 1984, it's the first entry in the Star Force series. While the arcade original was a moderate success, the 1,000,000+ unit sales of the Hudson Soft Famicom port resulted in the game gaining a substantial audience and high praise in Japan.\n\nPredating the likes of 1942 and Tiger-Heli, the game was among the first to feature many mechanics and gameplay elements that would become standard in the genre, including modern auto-fire, agile ship movement, hidden bonuses, and pre-planned enemy patterns. In addition the promotional \"Caravan\" high score competition hosted by Hudson for the Japanese Famicom port served as one of the earliest examples of a competitive shmup event.\n\nGameplay Overview\n\nStar Force is a single-button shooter. The game is comprised of 24 areas, each named after a letter of the Greek alphabet. At the end of each level is a Alpha Target, which acts as a end of level boss and is represented by the level's Greek letter. Failing to destroy it will force the player to replay the current stage. Upon completion the game loops infinitely.\n\nControls\n\nA: Fire\n\nA (Hold): Auto-fire\n\nJoystick: Movement\n\nCharacters / Ships / Styles\n\nThere is only one ship in Star Force: Final Star. Final Star is noticeably small and agile, being about the same size if not smaller than even basic enemies. This is in contrast to early shmups like Xevious, Super Xevious, or Scramble, and even later contemporaries like Tiger-Heli and 1942.\n\nFinal Star\n\nPlayer's ship\n\nWeapons\n\nFinal Star's only weapon is two different rates of basic fire. The default rate of fire is slow, but after obtaining the Purser the rate of auto-fire is significantly increased.\n\nItems\n\nItem Desciption Bonus Targets Targets marked with either \"B\" or \"b\" that award bonus points. Cleopatra A very rare ground target found only in the Nu Area. Destroying it will earn the player a bonus of 1000000 points. Hidden Rectangular hidden ground targets. They are initially hidden on the ground, appearing when shot. Each is worth 2000 points. Magikka Small \"?\" ground targets. Once shot they are overturned, showing either a angry face or a happy face (Kera). Revealing a Kera will earn the player a extra life. Purser A small external ship attachment that serves as Star Force's primary power-up, increasing fire-rate and the vertical size of the player's hit-box.\n\nScoring\n\nMajority of enemies and ground targets total between 200-500 points each.\n\nStrategy\n\nDue to the school of shmup design prominent at the time still being rather basic, there's no complex shot patterns in Star Force. Instead, the primary threat comes from the sheer quantity of enemies and shots on screen. Nearly all shots fired by enemies are aimed rather than patterned and several enemies directly pursue the player, meaning evasion requires much more awareness and focus than modern STGs.\n\nIf you are playing the Hudson Soft Famicom version, there are a number of exploits that can be abused to make the game somewhat easier at the cost of score. Most famously, you can avoid more complex and difficult enemies spawning in by simply not firing at whatever wave is currently on screen. On larger displays it is also possible to see enemies spawn position a frame in advance through the vertical overscan.\n\nStory\n\nIn the year 2010 of Dimension Almanac, there was a mysterious planet named Gordess which was moving in the darkness of the cosmos for the purpose of mass murder and plunder. Everyone gave up fighting against Gordess because of its awesome power. One day a brave soldier riding a space patroller challenged Gordess to fight. People called this space patroller \"Final Star\", wishing to be saved. You must bring an end to the murders which have been committees for the past 2000 years.\n\nVersion Differences\n\nSome North American variants of the arcade cabinet published by Video Ware are titled \"Mega Force\". Later Tehkan published units use the original title.\n\nThere are two different versions for the NES/Famicom: the Hudson Soft-developed Famicom version released in Japan in 1985, and a Tehkan developed NES version released in North America and Europe in 1987. Despite the obvious surface-level similarities, the Famicom and NES version were developed entirely separately, and feature totally unique assets and code from each other.\n\nHudson released an MSX version in 1985\n\nSega ported Star Force to the SG-1000\n\nDempa Shimbunsha ported Star Force to the X68000\n\nTrivia"
