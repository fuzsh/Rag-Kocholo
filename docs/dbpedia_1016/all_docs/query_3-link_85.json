        "text": "Updated August 05, 2024 at 12:30 PM ET\n\nHurricane Debby’s center made landfall near Steinhatchee, Fla., Monday morning, bringing not only sustained winds of 80 mph but also a dire threat of flooding to the Gulf Coast and beyond, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,\" the NHC said in a morning advisory note, warning of heavy rainfall from southeast Georgia through South Carolina and up to southeast North Carolina.\n\nDebby came ashore about 5 miles west of Steinhatchee, which sits along the state's Big Bend region — where Florida's panhandle and peninsula meet. As of 2 p.m. ET, the storm’s center was about 10 miles northwest of Live Oak, Florida.\n\n“Now that Hurricane Debby is making landfall, the most important thing to do is to just protect yourself and protect your family,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a Monday morning press conference. “Don’t go out into this storm. Don’t drive on the roads, particularly when they’re flooded”\n\nDeSantis said the state began to feel the impacts from Debby on Sunday evening and throughout Monday morning. The storm has produced flooding along Florida’s west coast from Sarasota to the northern part of the state.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center called it a \"life-threatening situation\" and urged people in the area to \"take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\"\n\nAccording to DeSantis, flooding had led to some “traffic mishaps” over the past 12 hours and prompted temporary road closures in certain areas.\n\nIn Taylor County, where the hurricane made landfall, the sheriff's office warned Monday morning that downed trees and power lines had made roadways treacherous.\n\nMore than 215,000 utility customers in Florida were without power Monday afternoon, according to the website poweroutage.us.\n\nAs of 2 p.m. ET Monday, the hurricane was moving north-northeast at around 7 mph. Maximum sustained winds were near 65 mph.\n\nThe NHC upgraded Debby to a Category 1 hurricane late Sunday night; just two days earlier it had been identified as a \"disturbance\" over eastern Cuba with the potential to develop into a tropical storm.\n\nDebby gained strength over abnormally warm water in the Gulf of Mexico before it made landfall in Florida. The water just off the west coast of Florida is about 5 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than usual for this time of year. Average sea surface temperatures across the North Atlantic have been in record-breaking territory for more than a year. Human-caused climate change is primarily to blame.\n\nLoading...\n\nWarm water helps storms gain strength, as Debby did in the 24 hours before hitting land. And warmer water also causes storms suck up more moisture, which subsequently falls as heavy rain and can cause dangerous flash flooding.\n\nForecasters had warned of a potentially deadly storm surge in Florida. And as Debby moves slowly over land, it is also dropping heavy rain and causing both urban and river flooding in the southeastern U.S.\n\nStorm surge warnings and tropical storm warnings were in effect for parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nDebby's path after Florida\n\nRainfall amounts could reach between 6 and 18 inches in pockets of central and northern Florida, up to North Carolina through Saturday morning.\n\nAfter leaving Florida, the center of Debby is forecasted to begin moving through southeastern Georgia Monday night and reach South Carolina by Tuesday. Parts of those states could receive at least 10 inches of rain — and certain areas may see up to 30 inches of rain through Friday morning, a potentially record-setting amount. The governors of both states have already issued states of emergency.\n\nThe Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency said in a Monday afternoon post on X that the state was already beginning to feel the effects of the storm, and posted photos of downed trees damaging homes and blocking roads.\n\nCopyright 2024 NPR"
