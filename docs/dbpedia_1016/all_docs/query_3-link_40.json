        "text": "Partly to mostly sunny skies today with highs in the 80s and 90s.\n\nIsolated strong to severe storms will be possible after 1PM today. The Storm Prediction Center has placed western Montana under a marginal risk for damaging wind gusts of 58 mph or greater and large hail of 1 inch or greater in diameter. Any recently damaged or weakened trees may be susceptible to additional damage and pose safety risks. Avoid parking under trees and securing any loose outdoor items before the storms arrive.\n\nA cold front will bring a break from the heat for the second half of the week. Daytime highs will be in the 70s to low 80s through the weekend. Showers and storms will be possible Friday and Saturday."
