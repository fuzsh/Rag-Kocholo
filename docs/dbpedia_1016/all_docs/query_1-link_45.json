The move was agreed upon by members of the Hudson board of directors during a meeting held last week. Komani purchased a majority stake in the Bomberman firm during early 2011, and it is still unclear if any of the firm's classic titles will continue development under the Komani brand. Additional information can be found via Andriasang. Thanks, Eurogamer."
