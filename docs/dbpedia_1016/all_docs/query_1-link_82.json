        "text": "Sapporo â€“ The pandemic proved a boon for the video game industry, sparking a frenzy of investment to keep up with demand. But this gold rush met its reckoning when normality returned in 2023, a banner year for quality games but a bleak one for overseas developers hit by mass layoffs as studios downsized or closed, something that continues into 2024.\n\nHome to world-leading gaming companies, Japan has been a bright spot among the turmoil, not only avoiding widespread job cuts but hiring new graduates as usual. An example can be found in the capital of Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido. Here, Sega has opened Sapporo Studio, its first domestic development base outside Tokyo. Established in December 2021 in the middle of the pandemic-fuelled gaming craze, the young studio is remarkable for growing amid a recent slump in the industry.\n\nAside from these quality-of-life benefits, Sapporo also has a history of game development. The now-defunct Hudson Soft, the studio behind Bomberman, was founded here. After Konami absorbed it in 2012, many former Hudson employees went over to Nintendo subsidiary NDcube, which still develops the Mario Party series in the city. Local developer H.a.n.d. is known for collaborating with major studios, including with Sega on the tile match series Puyo Puyo.\n\nThis ingrained environment of active video game development gave Sapporo an edge over other cities Sega was considering for expansion. And as Sapporo Studio hit its stride, it found unexpected enthusiasm from job seekers.\n\nSega developers say new Sapporo studios lead to better lives\n\nAside from quality-of-life benefits that come from living outside a major metropolis, Sapporo also has a history of game development.\n\nPlease read the article, as it's very informative.
