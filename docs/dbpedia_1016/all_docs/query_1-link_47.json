        "text": "ND Cube sort of had an odd identity crisis for much of its prior life. It began as a \"2nd-party\" studio formed between Nintendo and Dentsu, with Nintendo apparently owning 78% according to IGN? Swore it was 40% Nintendo and 60% Dentsu. This was also born using Yamauchi's Q-Fund, the same money that formed Genius Sonority and Game Designers Studio, the creators of FF Chrystal Chronicles.\n\nAnyway, they started out making F-Zero Maximum Velocity on the GBA and would not long after create a new IP; Tube Slider for GC, which seemed to be eerily F-Zero like, possibly being intended as one, but maybe F-Zero GX was made instead so ND Cube's game had to be changed to an original one, who knows. Hell the game was localized by... NEC of all companies!?\n\nAnyway again. After that, after some billiards GC game and some small GBA games that never left Japan in the mid 2000's, things went awfully quiet. From what research I did, I recall some former Square folks being there (like FF8 folks) and maybe some folks from other random places? Can't remember. But that was sort of ND Cube in a nut shell. Actually apparently back in 2008/2009 before their present form, they were headed by Makoto Tokugawa, the former CEO of Quest!? O_o Oh man... Anyway, back to the topic, they just were a very minor footnote and were clearly more or less irrelevant to Nintendo at that point throughout those years...\n\n... until 2010.\n\nFrom what can be observed, seemingly, Hidetoshi Endo, who ran Hudson Soft for many years (as far back as the N64 era) left the developer (I think his last work there was in 2008 including Bomberman Blast on WiiWare, so likely then), so my guess is, he went to Iwata for maybe a team up. After all, Hudson and Nintendo were BFFs for many years, most specifically on the Mario Party series, with 8 and DS being fairly new at that point. This is speculation, but it's very realistic in my eyes.\n\nAnyway, this seemingly resulted in Nintendo finding ND Cube in an old sock drawer and then realizing \"oh hey, we can use this\", and then the great transformation began. Nintendo bought Dentsu's shares in the team, and then Hidetoshi Endo would become president of ND Cube in the same way he was at Hudson Soft. And with that, he likely held a giant sign calling all interested Hudson folks to flock over, and that's what a huge amount did. This likely being because the writing was on the wall about Konami's imminent absorption of Hudson in late 2011/early 2012. Most prominently coming over to ND Cube was seemingly all of the Mario Party team. Hell Nintendo originally had the team as its own joint company between the two known as Monegi, but seemingly after Mario Party... 5(?) they were simply merged into Hudson anyway.\n\nSo it felt like everything was falling into place. Hudson was no more and Nintendo basically had a safe haven for the team during those first couple of years of ND Cube's rebirth. So what came of this anyway? First was Wii Party in 2010. Then Wii Play Motion in 2011. Not terrible for something to get things started and their feet wet.\n\n2012 finally saw the return of Mario Party with Mario Party 9, and became a franchise officially inherited by ND Cube from Hudson Soft. This was when the series was turned on its head with the whole car mechanic and other changes. At the time from observing I was fine with the fresh take, since we were already 8+ entries with nothing really done to \"freshen\" things up, plus with it being under a new dev now in-house at Nintendo, it looked like a fine time to do some experimenting. And at the time it paid off as it did well commercially, and I think it reviewed fairly well also. Trouble is, the veteran fans weren't keen on the changes.\n\nNext on the plate I think was Mario Party Island Tour on 3DS. This time they tried a more traditional set up, but I think there was a new card system? Either way, this didn't resonate with folks either? I'm curious as to why as I never played this either. I only played Mario Party 1, 2, 4, and barely of 5 because my rental disc was trash! LOL\n\nEventually on Wii U they made Wii Party U. Again, this was mostly harmless and an alright way to get their feet wet with HD development, and was a first year Wii U title so they were quick to jump in. We knew Mario Party 10 was coming anyway. And it did... except it was much worse than even MP9. MP10 looked like it was pretty content starved with a much smaller amount of modes. It did looked very pretty though (DK had actual fur-shading, something not even seen in Super Mario Party. Still my fav in-game model for DK to date).\n\nBy this point, ND Cube were clearly looking to be a one trick pony and it was concerning. It was like the one thing they were doing, they just couldn't hit one out of the ball park. Not that long after they did Animal Crossing amiibo Festival, arguably their worst game to date. They also did Mario Party Star Rush and afterward Mario Party: The Top 100, which was actually a compilation of \"The Top 100\" mini-games in the 10 main games. This was very cool as they got to tackle some classics from the golden era. But everyone wanted this on Switch so... not many got to really celebrate this concept...\n\nSo FINALLY we come to Switch and Super Mario Party, their second attempt at a reboot, this time finally making something more resembling the original Hudson-era games. Problem again was, a lack of content, plus the pretty bland boards. But at least they nailed arguably the most important part; the mini-games. 80 brand-new mini-games and I think most were well received? That's something to be proud of I think.\n\nBut the problem still stands; ND Cube are stuck in an infinite party game loop, or they would be, except they shockingly developed Animal Crossing Pocket Camp, their first non-party game, go figure. Still, they need to truly break from this near non-stop party output. For the longest time I wanted Nintendo to put them on new IPs or at least allow Konami to license out Hudson's IPs for ND Cube to make new entries of. Well we almost got that when Nintendo licensed Momotaro on 3DS back in 2017... only was was developed by Valhalla Game Studios (wat). Nintendo managed to get a Switch-exclusive Bomberman game made, but that was all by Konami and developer Hexadrive, without any actual ex-Hudson employee input that I saw at all (despite what Konami told Siliconera).\n\nDespite all that, I feel they have tons of potential to be the Hudson 2.0 they can be. If you look through the credits of their output, you'll find folks not just from the Mario Party team, but from other Hudson games across the gens. I remember finding like 7-9 folks who worked on Bomberman 64 for instance. But even if they don't touch a Hudson IP, they need to create a brand new, non-party game IP based on a new world with new characters. They've more than earned that privilege IMO, I just wish Nintendo would allow that. Something to note; Super Mario Party was made using Nintendo's NintendoWare Bezel engine. So they could just use that to make something fairly cheap and easy with minimal risk, hopefully.\n\nThe other thing I want to bring up and as more of a question as to where they are now, is Over Fence. Over Fence were the creators of Flip Wars on Switch that Nintendo localized. This is important because they were formed by apparently ex-Hudson folks who worked on the Bomberman franchise... we just never found out who. No-one's bothered transcribing the credits in the game... if it even has credits. Anyway, sadly they went bankrupt early last year and no-one's heard about where the team went. My hope is that their connection with Nintendo might have allowed Nintendo to lead the employees towards ND Cube. If anyone's heard anything at all, please let me know!\n\nSo that's kind of it really. I adored Hudson and always felt they were perfectly at home with Nintendo and they sort of became so. It's just they became a party game factory and not a terribly good one at that. Super Mario Party was finally a \"good\" one but it still came with a host of issues. Hopefully Super Mario Party 2 (I assume now it'll hit next year) will finally be the true big comeback the series and ND Cube needs.\n\nThoughts?"
