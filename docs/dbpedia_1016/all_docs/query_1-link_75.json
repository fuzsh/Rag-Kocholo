        "text": "Momotaro Dentetsu (Momotarou Electric Railway) (also known by the abbreviated name Momotetsu) is a long-running board game-style video game series in Japan; in which players travel by rail, ship, and airplane; attempting to acquire wealth through business transactions buying properties; and dealing with rival entrepreneurs and nemeses such as the God of Poverty. The game mechanics are often compared to the board games sugoroku and Monopoly.\n\nStarted in 1988, the series was initially produced by Hudson Soft. The rights to the series are now owned by Konami Corporation, who absorbed Hudson in 2012. The title is commonly thought of as a play on the title for another video game series by Hudson Soft, Momotaro Densetsu, with which it is sometimes confused. The project supervisor for the series is Akira Sakuma, with illustration by Takayuki Doi and main music production by Kazuyuki Sekiguchi of Southern All Stars.\n\nThe series is very popular in Japan, with 10 million units sold in the series by 1998. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the series, Hudson collaborated with the financially troubled Choshi Electric Railway Line, operating a train on the railway decorated with a Momotaro Dentetsu motif. Opening on April 25, 2007, the train ran until its third anniversary. In June 2009, two Momotetsu-themed restaurants opened at Japanese railway stations: one at Haijima Station, and another at Kami-Nagaya Station.\n\nMomotarou Densetsu 12 - West Japan Hen is a video game in the Momotaro Dentetsu series of board game-style video games, genre released in 2003 by Hudson Soft for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube.
