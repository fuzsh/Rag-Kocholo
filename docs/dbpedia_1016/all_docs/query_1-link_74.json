        "text": "Every now and again, I’ll do a quick web search of GemuBaka to see what kind of reach the site may have on the internet. Toward the end of 2023, I got a search hit I don’t think I would have ever expected: The official website of Kinuyo Yamashita.\n\nWhat followed was me retracing steps from 15 years ago and starting out 2024 with a game that hasn’t crossed my mind since I was still attending college: Walk It Out! on the Nintendo Wii by Konami.\n\nBuckle in, because this is the tale of how Kinuyo Yamashita convinced me to try Walk it Out!\n\n**The title of the game has the exclamation point included. I promise I’m not yelling at you every time the game is mentioned.\n\nWho is Kinuyo Yamashita?\n\nThe official website of Kinuyo Yamashita\n\nKinuyo Yamashita got involved with the gaming industry around 1986, composing music for a variety of Konami projects before becoming a contracted musician in the overall video game industry. If you need a reference point of where you’ve heard her work, she produced songs such as “Wicked Child” and “Heart of Fire” in the original releases of Castlevania along with contributions from Satoe Terashima.\n\nWhile at Konami, Kinuyo Yamashita also worked on games including Gradius II, King Kong 2 Ikari no Megaton Punch and Parodius, before moving on to compose for games such as Power Blade, Pocky and Rocky, Ghost Sweeper Mikami Joreishi wa Nice Body, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers (SNES), Medarot/Medabots, the Game Boy version of WWF WrestleMania 2000 and the Game Boy version of Croc 2.\n\nAnother of her standout compositions comes from her work with Capcom on Mega Man X3, producing “Zero’s Theme” and the stage theme for Blizzard Buffalo.\n\nHer biography notes an unfortunate break in her music career in 1998, as she experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, she was able to make a full recovery from this and continue as a freelance composer in the aughts.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the online information – at least in English – about Kinuyo Yamashita drops off around 2010-2011. This was around the time she began collaborating for performances for the Video Games Live show. Her biography states she had moved to the United States and continued to compose music independently.\n\nShe had a couple of updates that included her work on the “Super-RareTrax” CD to benefit the Japanese Red Cross following the earthquakes in Japan in 2011, a new year’s message for 2012 and a YouTube video featuring a piano arrangement of the Blizzard Buffalo music from Mega Man X3. I haven’t been able to find any updates on her as of this time frame, but she has multiple sources still available where you can sample her works over the years.\n\nThe GemuBaka connection\n\nOne of the later works on the biography of Kinuyo Yamashita comes when she would reconnect with Konami for Walk it Out! on the Nintendo Wii.\n\nI’ve mentioned a couple of times the GemuBaka YouTube channel was initially created to host game trailers and other promotional materials so I could use them on a variety of web sites I was working with at the time. One of these promotional trailers just happens to be Konami’s Walk it Out!, as my work with Bemanistyle at the time had me seeking out all manner of rhythm-based video games.\n\nKinuyo Yamashita’s website features a newsfeed, and one of her announcements from Dec. 2, 2009, details the upcoming release of Walk it Out! on the Nintendo Wii. Her comment is, “I composed two songs for this game, this game has a lot of music!” She writes about this work having her come full circle at Konami, as one of the songs included in Walk it Out! is “Belmont’s Destiny” in a nod to the Castlevania series.\n\nNow, the reason there is a connection here is that Kinuyo Yamashita has the Walk it Out! announcement trailer embedded on her website as part of this news announcement. The source of the trailer chosen to be included on her website: GemuBaka.\n\nI remember Walk it Out! being announced by Konami in 2009 and I put up a blurb about the game on Bemanistyle. While the game is based around walking, it was heavily advertised as being music-based and had elements akin to traditional rhythm games.\n\nIt seemed like the game got this initial announcement, it released, and then it got forgotten to time. Or did it?\n\nThis game left my mind for the better part of 15 years, and I was left at my computer in 2023, pouring over the contents of Kinuyo Yamashita’s website. I found notes that Walk It Out! had 120 songs, which is a lot for a music-based game around this time, and it furthermore had a listing of artists notable to Konami’s Bemani line of games such as DanceDanceRevolution and beatmania.\n\nMy mind then began racing with questions from the rhythm gaming perspective. Is Walk it Out! secretly a hidden gem “Bemani” game? Is this disc an unearthed list of banger music hits from notable artists that had worked with Konami? Is Walk it Out! really as unremarkable as it seemed from the perspective of someone in 2009 when the rhythm genre was white-hot in the United States and this was the “game du jour” in the category?\n\nI had to know. I had to play Walk it Out! and connect these pieces together to find out if the game was truly deserving of the hidden gem status. I saw the game could be purchased online from $5-10, so I made it my mission to cover every inch of this video game so it could be archived on GemuBaka.\n\nThe ebbs and flows of Konami\n\nForgive me for this long-winded approach, but I feel it will take approximately 10 years of history to properly set up the release of Walk it Out! and why it likely received the mainstream media reception it did in 2010 …\n\nMany people have fond memories of Konami’s output on the NES/Famicom, and that is perfectly understandable when you consider the track record of titles such as Castlevania, Gradius, Contra, Metal Gear, Blades of Steel and more. Konami also really caught a lot of attention going into the 1990s in arcades and in the transition to the Super Nintendo, with the meticulous care it put into licensed video games that featured Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tiny Toon Adventures, The Simpsons, X-Men and Batman.\n\nHowever, if you want my opinion on what “peak Konami” was – the time it was firing on all cylinders to produce the most unique content possible – that would be the end of the 1990s, rolling into the new millennium. The original PlayStation and arcades were Konami’s canvas, and it took that opportunity to take chances to paint the most outside-the-box creations seen by fans of video games.\n\nSome of this would trickle into the next generation of consoles, but Konami definitely had a hand in the wave of developers making the new batch of fifth-generation consoles at the time truly seem like an evolution in video gaming. With consoles quickly catching up to the base technology offered in arcade games at the time, Konami doubled down in arcades by offering interactive experiences that were more difficult to replicate in homes – a sort of “dawning” of the deluxe cabinet age of arcades.\n\nPart of this was a series of releases in the arcades that saw beatmania, DanceDanceRevolution and pop’n music hit the scene between 1997 and 1998. By streamlining and “gamifying” music with rhythmic inputs, Konami had pushed forward into a genre that would be closely associated with the company for nearly a decade. GemuBaka currently has loose features on beatmania (The Birth of Bemani: Beatmania turns 25) and pop’n music (ポップン25周年: 25 Years of pop’n music), but DanceDanceRevolution is a whole different beast.\n\nBeatmania did receive a U.S. release under the name HipHopMania, and the first Bemani game I ever played was actually Guitar Freaks. Despite Konami’s attempt to roll out all other manner of rhythm games from Para Para Paradise, KeyboardMania, Martial Beat to Mambo a Go Go, only one game truly stuck a successful landing in the United States: DanceDanceRevolution. Don’t get me wrong – the full lineup of Bemani games certainly has an audience and community in the United States, but DDR eventually became a cultural phenomenon for a hot minute in North America.\n\nAgain, people in the U.S. were obviously playing and enjoying DDR early in its life – I had my first shot at the game in the 1999/2000 area with the 1.5 version on the Cedar Point midway – but this was largely relegated to certain regions. Oddly, it virtually took the entirety of DDR’s “original lifespan” for it to truly break through in this territory.\n\nKonami released DanceDanceRevolution Extreme to Japanese arcades on Christmas Day in 2002, marking the eighth release in the main line of DDR games. DDR MAX 2 (7th Mix) had actually released earlier in the year, and Extreme changed the color scheme of this version and injected a beefy number of songs into the game, largely consisting of transplant songs from other Bemani titles.\n\nAt this point, Konami was giving off weird vibes about the series, leading people to believe the company was ready to leave it behind for good – or in a best-case scenario, giving it a rest before completely refreshing it such as the transition from Beatmania to Beatmania IIDX. The arcade-to-console home release of DDR Extreme in Japan even featured an exclusive song titled “MAX.” (MAX period) which features strange voice clips reciting “Why do you need Konami original songs?” and “Thank you for playing” and inserting audio clips from the original iteration of DDR. Being on internet communities for DDR at the time, I can tell you people truly believed this series was finished.\n\nHowever, at this point DDR was receiving more attention and notoriety in the United States as more and more arcades were giving the machine a chance. At least in my area, virtually all arcades got their feet wet with (probably not legit) 3rdMix cabinets, moving to a mix somewhere between 5-7 and then ultimately settling on an Extreme cabinet. There was a time where DDR Extreme was a staple of a U.S. arcade, and that’s when it happened: DDR had finally caught fire popularity-wise in the U.S.\n\nSeriously, there were Burger King promotions with toys, V-Rare OST soundtracks were finally popping up here as game pre-order bonuses of the PlayStation 2 games and there was even a short-lived DanceDanceRevolution television series featuring dance crew competitions (one season, 13 episodes in 2007). I am unclear if this surge forced Konami’s hand, but the series then got its “second life” with the introduction of DDR SuperNOVA in 2006 – nearly four years after the previous arcade release.\n\nWasn’t this feature supposed to be about Walk it Out!?\n\nYes. But, Walk it Out! comes into play as Konami’s dominance in the rhythm genre in the U.S. started to slip through the cracks. The absolute height of DDR in the United States in the area of 2007 was met with something that would completely shake the genre to its core in this territory: The rise of Guitar Hero and Rock Band.\n\nIt’s largely lost today that Guitar Hero started back in 2005 under the direction of a new publishing company – RedOctane. Up to this point, people knew this company as a third-party producer of console dance mats, more specifically for its foam-style Ignition pads that provided more durability than the standard-issue vinyl pads packed in with the DDR games. RedOctane broke into game publishing by bringing DDR competitor In the Groove to the PlayStation 2 (you can read a 2006 interview with Kyle Ward on the In the Groove series on GemuBaka) – a concept that eventually evolved into today’s StepManiaX.\n\nGuitar Hero was one of those games that was largely ignored by the masses up to its release, but then once it was finally in the hands of gamers and word of mouth spread, it quickly catapulted into being a best-seller. This obviously led to the development of a sequel (you can read a 2006 interview with Ted Lange of RedOctane on Guitar Hero II on GemuBaka), and the series found itself snatched up by Activision leading into the third installment and beyond. With the marketing muscle of Activision and MTV putting its support behind Harmonix’s/EA’s Rock Band, this new wave of rhythm games chipped away at Konami’s foothold on the genre until it completely washed away DDR’s mainstream appeal in the U.S.\n\nThe key element in the success of Guitar Hero and Rock Band was that they were the games that finally bucked the belief that U.S. video gamers were not willing to invest in gimmick controllers and peripherals. Magazines and websites for years would point out all manner of specialized controllers that could be paired with video games in Japan – most notably the Virtual On twin sticks that would never release in the U.S. despite the games releasing here. Even outside of Konami’s long list of Bemani entries (even Martial Beat and Para Para Paradise had sensor controllers for PlayStation 2), there were cool controllers such as the lever controllers for the Power Shovel construction excavator on PlayStation, and there is a lineage of controllers for Japan’s Densha de Go train simulation series.\n\nStill, the only bone we were typically ever thrown in the U.S. was the vinyl dance mat along with DDR. To bring all of this to its point, here is where Konami comes into play during the “peripheral era” spurred by the Nintendo Wii and these very successful games. While Konami was actually a pioneer in this field, it waited far too long to take these chances in the U.S., and the company looked like a lame copycat in the eyes of the typical U.S. video game consumer when it joined the “me too” crowd of publishers scrambling to catch a piece of the U.S. rhythm gaming pie.\n\nDespite having the long-running franchise of GitaDora (“Guitar” + “Drum” combined from the Guitar Freaks and DrumMania games), Konami saw fit to release Rock Revolution instead. After years of begging from fans, Konami finally gave Beatmania an official home release in the U.S., but it largely collected songs from older entries of the franchise – songs these fans had long been playing in imported versions. Pop’n music finally got its chance in the U.S., but these were in the completely modified Beat’n Groovy on the Xbox LIVE Marketplace and drastically-redeveloped Nintendo Wii version. All the while, DDR titles continued to squeeze out periodically, but it got to the point of the DanceDanceRevolution reboot that implemented mechanics similar to the “star power” found in Guitar Hero.\n\nMany of these released on the concept of continually adding DLC support, especially the DDR games that were said to eventually have large numbers of legacy songs as long-term support. However, most of this never panned out, and in cases such as Beat’n Groovy, it never received one lick of post-release support (I really need to feature this game one day).\n\nStill, even on the successful end of the spectrum, Guitar Hero and Rock Band ran its course by the end of the decade. Activision was Activision and ran the series into the ground with multiple releases within a few years, and with a big injection of rhythm games, people were feeling the fatigue. The Nintendo Wii alone was ripe with such games thanks to the motion controls, seeing games such as Battle of the Bands, Boogie, Drum King, American Idol, Wii Music, Zumba and Ultimate Band on the system, among a variety of games based entirely on single music acts.\n\nAs far as I can tell, Walk it Out! was the final non-DanceDanceRevolution rhythm game Konami released on a Nintendo system – DanceMasters for Xbox 360, and by extension the downloadable Rhythm Party, may be the final non-DDR console rhythm game to officially release from Konami in the U.S.\n\nWalk it Out! was announced on July 9, 2009, and released on Jan. 12, 2010. Since the mid-2010s, Konami has largely retreated to focusing solely on the Japanese market, only resurfacing in North America to release the occasional game compilation or having an outside developer work on a Konami license. While Konami is still fairly active producing arcade games, these are Japanese releases that are granted use by officially-approved locations such as Round One in the United States.\n\nWhat is Walk it Out!?\n\nWalk it Out! is billed by Konami as a music and fitness game for the Nintendo Wii. This title did also release in Europe in March 2010, but under the title Step to the Beat (no exclamation point – no shouting this title). There is no Japanese release for this game despite the Konami connection.\n\nWalk it Out! can be controlled with the standard Nintendo Wii remote and nunchuk, but players can also use a DanceDanceRevolution mat or the Nintendo Wii Balance Board if they choose. Leveraging the popularity of music gaming and combining it with the newer trends of fitness gaming launched by Nintendo’s Wii Fit, Walk it Out! mimics the vibe of the Nintendo Mii avatars and puts players on an island that is intractable as they walk along to music.\n\nThe game was originally billed to include more than 120 music tracks, which was heavily advertised to include “Boom Boom Pow” by The Black Eyed Peas, “La La Land” by Demi Lovato and “How Do You Sleep?” by Jesse McCartney. However, the big focus at this time was put on getting people off the couch – the hot phrase launched by the fitness gaming craze of the late aughts – and being able to track calories burned, distance traveled and steps taken.\n\nKonami largely went quiet on Walk it Out! for the remainder of 2009, stepping in on Dec. 16, 2009, to pin down the exact launch date and provide a couple more details.\n\nWhile the original press release only discussed the three licensed songs, this updated release finally states the game is filled with original songs “from some of the same artists who created music for the legendary DanceDanceRevolution series.” Out of 120 songs, it was noted 20 were licensed tracks, meaning the Bemani artists were putting in some serious work to form a track list for Walk it Out!\n\nIn new mechanics described by this update, it was revealed the game can be played in a two-player mode, and the title will feature three different mini-games.\n\nThe game’s developer: A.I.\n\nOne item of note I actually found quite interesting is the developer of the game. I have mentioned Konami quite a bit, being the publisher marketing the game and probably arranging for the music, but Walk it Out! has a share of Hudson Soft being branded into it.\n\nHudson Soft remained its own entity until the area of 2011/12 before becoming fully absorbed by Konami, but Walk it Out! released in a time when Konami was its majority shareholder and becoming its parent company. As a fun sidenote, the GemuBaka YouTube channel features a teaser trailer for an unreleased Bonk game subtitled Brink of Extinction. This game was supposed to release in the rough time frame when a lot of this merger was approaching.\n\nCombing through the credits of Walk it Out!, I noticed a listing for A.I. Co., Ltd. I admit this is the first I’d ever heard of this company, and given the current technology trends, I had a lot of “fun” searching for anything relevant to my goal for “AI.” Still, GameFAQs and Moby Games were able to come through with a few of the breadcrumbs that gave me a trail to follow.\n\nI was beginning to think maybe A.I. was a subsidiary of Hudson Soft, but it was noted the company contracted with other companies such as Banpresto, which explained the multiple Super Robot Taisen credits to the company. The games listings for A.I. on both of those websites unfortunately cut off in 2013, but, shockingly, the company’s website remains live to this day.\n\nThe website’s final update came in March 2014, but it still features a listing of the company’s works, a message from CEO Kenichi Arai from the end of 2012 and general information about the company that had put 20 years into the industry at that point. Konami’s Walk it Out! is included in the company’s listing, confirming the Jan. 12, 2010, release date and also confirming this title never released in Japan. This official company listing only features seven games releasing after Walk it Out!, but it had in the past worked on titles such as the NES/Famicom port of Bonk’s Adventure (FC原人) and Bomberman GB3 for Game Boy, and even pumping out mini-games included in Mario Party 2 and Mario Party 3 on Nintendo 64 and Mario Party Advance on Game Boy Advance.\n\nThe real eye-catcher for me on the company release list was two games for the Xavix/XaviXPORT. This unlocks memories I haven’t thought about in decades.\n\nI only remember this console because of its sports-shaped controllers, but I never once saw it in person nor played it. The Xavix was billed as an active gaming system, and sort of made an early attempt at what the Nintendo Wii eventually brought to the table. A.I. developed a boxing game and a golf game for the format, so perhaps the developer wasn’t the strangest choice for the Walk it Out! project after all.\n\nWhat’s strange is, while A.I.’s company website has gone without updates since 2014, it operated a Twitter account that posted into 2021. It made multiple mentions of B.B. Studio as it developed more recent Super Robot Taisen titles, as well as mentions of recruitment. Its final tweet came on Jan. 4, 2021, mentioning it has resumed operations for the year, and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, it wished to continue developing games.\n\nWith my searches and the knowledge I can piece together, I unfortunately can’t trace the company any further than this point. It’s possible the developer was unfortunately shuttered by the pandemic, but I can’t seem to find any actual confirmation – in English – that the company is defunct. I suppose it is possible the team provides support to other studios, given its mentions of B.B. Studio, but anything beyond what I’ve typed prior to this paragraph is a merely a guess.\n\nThe website listed Kenichi Arai as the CEO of A.I. in 2012, but I actually don’t see his name included in the credits of Walk it Out! The game has Michio Sato and Hideki Watanuki as directors, Testuma Yoshida as lead programmer and Akira Katagi as lead artist.\n\nThe music and sound is billed as an important part of Walk it Out!, and it looks like this was handled by Hudson Soft Co., Ltd., with Osamu Narita as sound producer and Hiroyuki Tsuboguchi as sound director, and audio direction credited to Kaiju Audio.\n\nSo, it’s entirely possible that, similar to how it worked with Mario Party, A.I. developed the base gameplay bits and then other teams inserted the audio that drove these mechanics. With the way the game mechanics ultimately break down, I could see how this is definitely within the realm of possibility.\n\nThe release of Walk it Out!\n\nSo here we are in 2009, with the fatigue largely there on rhythm games and the fatigue starting to set in on fitness games. I upload the Walk it Out! announcement trailer for Konami on the GemuBaka YouTube channel on July 9, 2009, the exact date of the announcement, for Bemanistyle … and you can probably guess how well an announcement of a game suggestively about walking in place went over at that time.\n\nThe Bemanistyle coverage is unfortunately lost to time, but here are some comment quotes from 14 years ago that are still on this YouTube upload:\n\n“why would you use a wii with an hdtv thats a waste of about $1600 and i’m not even going to comment on the product advertised not worth my time…”\n\n“I think i have never seen something so useless before.. thats amazing…….”\n\n“what. the. hell.”\n\n“you can torture persons with it… force them to watch it for hours…”\n\n“A WALKING SIMULATOR?! what the f— is the world coming to…”\n\n“OMG a walk sim… Konami plumb the depths.”\n\nAgain, much of this comes from a niche community that had been “wronged” by Konami over a period of years. If a person spent years longing for the Bemani games to have an official presence in the United States, they probably weren’t going to be very pleased by the announcement of Walk it Out! The angst is unnecessary, but this announcement did not light the world on fire for those following music gaming closely during this time.\n\nAll of this largely drowned out the voices of the more casual game players, which was what the ecosystem of the Nintendo Wii was based on, and what Walk it Out! wisely attempted to capitalize on.\n\nCoincidentally, the original Just Dance video game from Ubisoft released exclusively on the Nintendo Wii on Nov. 17, 2009. In another facet that people today might not realize – this game got TRASHED in media when it released. Centered around spotty input recognition and no real game progression featured in the title, reviewers seemed to have a field day with shoveling dirt on Just Dance, which placed it at a 49 Metacritic score … and then this game ended up selling more than 4 million copies worldwide.\n\nJust Dance has released in an annual iteration on multiple formats every single year afterward as a staple of Ubisoft’s game portfolio, and at the end of 2023, a behind-the-scenes feature on Just Dance 2024 done by Dance Magazine reported the series has sold more than 80 million copies in its lifetime. This is a textbook case of the casual user base that doesn’t comb over everything video gaming online stepping up to bat and speaking with sales numbers, versus launching negativity into the online void.\n\nSo, surely, the same could possibly happen to Walk it Out!, right? On top of this, while the game received rhythm gamer ire in 2009, that tune was changing a tiny bit once a full song list for Walk it Out! was made available. With 100 songs being poured into this title coming from notable artists that have worked on Bemani games over the years, could Walk it Out! potentially get those curiosity buys from people who essentially just want to use it as a Bemani jukebox?\n\nEmbarking on the quest to Walk it Out!\n\nI’d had my mind made up – 2023/24 was definitely the year I would finally sample this game for myself and definitively form my own opinion on the matter. At worst, the disc would have 120 songs that I could dig into, featuring Kinuyo Yamashita and Bemani-centric artists I greatly enjoy such as Sampling masters AYA, kors k, DJ Simon and Ryu☆.\n\nThe world supposedly hated this game and Amazon sells it for only a few bucks, so it couldn’t be all that hard to track this game down in the wild … right? Right?!?\n\nOver a period of approximately four months, I scoured every shop that sells games second-hand in the Toledo area, visited shops in Indianapolis, searched through a couple of flea markets and went to events such as the Classic Console and Arcade Game show, Cleveland Gaming Classic and Detroit Retro Video Game Show. Not one, single Walk it Out! sighting was had over these efforts.\n\nI was attending prime swap meet-style events centered specifically around video game sales, and I was that guy digging through chunks of Nintendo Wii games looking for a title no one had ever heard of. Then again, I approach booths with 3D0 games, and when I tell the person I’m interested in 3D0 games, they laugh and think I am joking until it sinks in that I’m completely serious. I definitely stick out like a sore thumb when it comes to these events.\n\nThe Amazon option had been sitting there the entire time, but it got to the point where I was 100% stubborn and wanted the satisfaction of seeing Walk it Out! on a shelf. The thrill is in the chase, as they say in collecting, and Walk it Out! bizarrely started becoming the “white whale” I would start shouting about, scaring away any normal person within a 10-feet radius.\n\nMe: “I swear! There is a game called Walk it Out! on the Nintendo Wii! You walk in place, but your in-game character walks around! And there is MUSIC!!”\n\nNormal person: “Okay, grandpa. Let’s get you back to bed.”\n\nAnything I had seen up to this point would suggest this game didn’t sell, and it was virtually stacked on top of each other on Amazon at common prices. It was maddening that I could not find this game in a physical location. But time was ticking down on the release date anniversary of this game in the United States.\n\nI had to admit defeat, and I begrudgingly made my way to Amazon in early January. I opted for the $10 purchase to ensure I got a game, case and instructions in good condition. I spent months and traveled maybe 1,000 miles looking for this cursed game – and in three clicks of a mouse and two minutes tops, it was all over. The game was finally in my weary hands, and this process could see an official start.\n\nIn my post-gameplay research, I found something I would have never expected months ago: The Gamer.com has a list of “The 19 Rarest Wii Games and How Much They’re Worth.” Walk it Out! is ranked as #12 on this list – for real, it gets placed in the company of games such as Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, Ju-on: The Grudge, The Last Story and Dokapon Kingdom.\n\nIGN in 2017 posted about someone who collected every game on the Nintendo Wii that released in North America, and the article places this at 1,262 video games. This suggests Walk it Out! is more rare than roughly 1,250 of the video games ever released on the console. Walk it Out! is insinuated to be rarer than 99% of the Nintendo Wii’s overall U.S. game library.\n\nUnfortunately, the Gamer.com entry on Walk it Out! is void of any real explanation of why it ranks on the list – it’s essentially just a description of what the game is. At the time of the feature’s posting, Walk it Out! was placed at having a pre-owned value of $12+ and a new value of $36+. Just remember, “rare” doesn’t always mean a video game is in demand or valuable. It’s just harder to find.\n\nBut, take it from me: I’m placing Walk it Out! on the list of rarest Nintendo Wii games based purely on the fact it was hell for me to track down without an online marketplace to back me up.\n\nNow, the next obstacle came when I realized I haven’t hooked up my Nintendo Wii in at least 10 years. I had to remember where I stored it, and had to dig through bins to assemble a set of remotes and nunchuks. After all this effort, I press the power button and … no video.\n\nThankfully, I do own the Nintendo Wii U. I had actually never used the backward compatibility on this system, so this was another new-to-me experience. Perhaps the setup of the Nintendo Wii functionality isn’t as direct as it could possibly be on the Wii U, but it works. As a sidenote for this feature, any in-game screenshots taken by me will be in the Wii U’s aspect ratio, while any from the game’s originally-intended ratio are preview screenshots marketed by Konami.\n\nWe were finally in! Now we could start this journey that was nearly 15 years in the making!\n\nHow does Walk it Out! work?\n\nWalk it Out! is predominantly billed as a music and walking game, and this primary action is actually quite simple. A stepping guide is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen, and this is a bar that slides to the left at a speed that matches the beats per minute (BPM) of the song currently being played. When a song first starts, a song tracker will pop in at the bottom of the screen to display that song’s title and artist, and the number next to the musical note in the tracker is the song’s BPM.\n\nOn the game’s default settings, a block slides to the left in the stepping guide on every beat, and the player is tasked with triggering this beat when it matches the white line toward the left of the stepping guide. The player chooses one of three input methods that determine how they trigger the beats in a song – placing a Nintendo Wii nunchuk in the player’s pocket triggers input motions as they step, the Nintendo Wii balance board can trigger inputs as the player shifts weight from the left and right sides and a DanceDanceRevolution dance mat recognizes step inputs when the player steps on any of the mat’s buttons.\n\nSo, while at face value the game makes it seem like the player only walks in place, if the player uses the DDR mat, they can walk all over the pad, and if the player uses the nunchuk input, they can actually walk wherever they please around the living room or such as long as it is within a range the console can recognize the wireless controller connection.\n\nWith each beat, the game responds with a rating of PERFECT, GREAT or MISS. The PERFECT or GREAT ratings add one chip to the player’s counter. To allow for the player to adjust to a new song BPM, the beats are displayed as blue blocks at the beginning and end of songs, as well as in between songs. There is no penalty assessed for missing these notes. However, mid-song these change to gold blocks, and missing these notes on the default settings results in losing one chip as a penalty.\n\nEven though the game is based around a premise akin to a rhythm game, Walk it Out! doesn’t give you an overall rating per song, it doesn’t track personal best scores in songs and it isn’t possible to fail out of a song. The rhythm element is strictly in place for maneuverability and accumulating overall chips.\n\nThere is no real reward for achieving a PERFECT rating for every step in a song outside of personal satisfaction. Instead of going this route, the real feedback in Walk it Out! is in exploring the game’s world and unlocking its content with the chips. In this way, the true focus is in being physically active instead of obsessing over the standard rhythm game feedback.\n\nThe game does track your ratings over time, but it is mostly to provide you with a wrap-up of how many of each rating you had in the session, distance traveled and calories burned. It is actually a plus that the game will notify you when you surpass these data points compared to your previous session, and it tracks personal bests.\n\nStill, if a player wants to narrow the rhythm game elements even further, there are settings in place to remove the miss penalty, they can widen the timing window or enter a HALF mode that displays every other beat instead of the full four beats per song measure. And, I mean, if you want to try and be a flexing Bemani sicko in Walk it Out!, you can go the other way and narrow the timing window or elect to lose 10 or ALL of your chips on a missed step.\n\nIn a nutshell, that is everything running under the hood of Walk it Out! when you consider only the rhythm gaming element of this title. If you are only watching the announcement trailer for the game or reading preview materials, these mechanics and the music are the points that are really hammered into the viewer. However, this largely ignores the real meat of Walk it Out! If you take in the game as a whole, you start to realize the world building is the real “steak” of Walk it Out!, and the rhythm and music aspects of the game are the “sizzle” that comes off it.\n\nDiving into the world of Walk it Out!\n\nStarting Walk it Out! for the first time, the player will need to create a new profile. When considering Walk it Out! is an active game that encourages family members to play together, it is actually commendable the title allows for up to six different profiles to be created, with options to allow a guest to join as well.\n\nWalk it Out! features a choice of two avatar partners to accompany the player, providing them advice and encouragement – Nancy and Warren. Getting into the game, the player creates an avatar, with extremely basic settings of “masculine” and “feminine,” and toggles to change the colors of your hair, skin tone and clothing. The player then enters some personal information to decide on a display name, as well as basic statistics of age, height and weight so the game can keep tabs on data such as estimated calories burned.\n\nGoing through these profile features, I can actually see the Hudson Soft connection in Walk It Out!\n\nIn 2008, Hudson developed Deca Sports for the Nintendo Wii. I’ve already touched on a couple of the “me-too” trends on the Nintendo Wii, and from jump street Nintendo launched one of these trends with the console’s pack-in game Wii Sports.\n\nThis is probably another element that is lost on people who weren’t there for when it happened, but Wii Sports was a pretty big deal when it released in 2006. One could argue it is a mere collection of “tech demos” assembled on a mini-game disc, but it was the marquee game that echoed Nintendo’s stance on assembling a casual playerbase on the Nintendo Wii – you could put a controller in any person’s hand, and they could instinctively play Wii Sports by imitating the real-world sport. (Curious on my thoughts from my first time ever touching the Nintendo Wii and Wii Sports while at a preview event in 2006?)\n\nThe Deca Sports series is likely something lost to time since Hudson got absorbed into Konami, but, similar to Just Dance, the original Deca Sports on Nintendo Wii was reviewed poorly, yet it sold a couple million copies – this is very much a trend for the Nintendo Wii. When you compare the character models between Deca Sports and Walk it Out!, there is definitely a resemblance between the two.\n\nDeca Sports would go on to become a small series of games, and it eventually got an Xbox 360 version in 2010 to leverage the introduction of the Kinect camera. This version of the game was called Deca Sports Freedom, and its mini-game developer? A.I. Co., Ltd.!\n\nOnce the player confirms all of their details in the Walk it Out! profile, the game places the character in a stadium that can be used for practice. This segment provides a tutorial for the rhythm elements as explained above, but once the player gets walking, it then rolls into controls necessary to explore Rhythm Island.\n\nWhile I’ve talked about the use of a nunchuk, balance board or dance mat, the game also simultaneously utilizes a standard Nintendo Wii remote in order to navigate the game’s environment. At a base level, as the player walks, they will eventually need to choose between different walking paths. This is done by pointing the Wii remote at the arrows and pressing the A button, or by cycling between the different choices with the remote’s directional pad.\n\nThe player can also point and use the remote to manipulate the camera view by holding down the B trigger (or if the player is using a balance board or dance mat, a nunchuk analog stick can then adjust the camera), and they can also hover over their character and press the A button in order to turn around 180 degrees and walk in the opposite direction.\n\nOnce the player feels they have the basics down in the stadium, they can toggle the alternate path by traveling off to the side and through the exit when they are presented with the choice of arrows.\n\nOutside of the stadium is where the key aspect that really makes Walk it Out! a game kicks in: its world building mechanics that center around the collection of the chips the player receives from the rhythm gameplay. Rhythm Island is littered with icons that are deemed “event capsules,” and this is what expands the game over time and ultimately encourages the player to return to Walk it Out! on a regular basis.\n\nEach capsule has a designated number of chips it requires to actually activate the content, and they can be triggered in one of two ways. If the player outright has the number of chips required to activate the capsule, they can use the remote to point at the capsule and press the A button, and then that capsule immediately activates and that number of chips is deducted from the player’s total.\n\nHowever, the player can also “bank” up to three capsules if they do not have enough chips. Because the capsules are spread out in specific locations all over the island, this allows players to hold on to desired capsules without the need to track them down again once they have enough chips.\n\nBanked capsules are automatically triggered from left to right once the player accumulates the necessary number of chips. But players need to keep in mind that if a fourth capsule is banked, it pushes the first capsule out of the rotation, and the player will then need to return to its original location to find it again. Likewise, if a player picks up a capsule requiring a smaller number of chips, the game will deduct that number of chips from the player’s total and activate it immediately. Thus, the player will have to continue accumulating more chips to get back to the amount required for that banked chip at the higher requirement.\n\nThe majority of these capsules are “development capsules.” They are cosmetic “world building” items that place plants, light poles, buildings and fountains into the environment. They largely do nothing for the actual gameplay, with the exception of a few that build bridges so the player can cross bodies of water and explore even more segments of Rhythm Island.\n\nWhile they also don’t directly impact gameplay, the player can track down seven rainbow capsules that do not require chips to pick up. Doing so spreads a rainbow over Rhythm Island. Again, there is no direct reward for doing so, but these capsules are spread over the island each day as designated by the Nintendo Wii’s system calendar. They are intended to be a sort of a daily “hide and seek” element to the game to encourage players to explore the island and stick with walking and being active in order to meet a goal.\n\nTo encourage players to walk during the late afternoon/evening hours, player can also track down constellation capsules. These require a little more footwork than the rainbow capsules, as there are more to collect and they require chips to activate. However, once the player assembles a full set of a zodiac constellation, it is permanently displayed in the night sky.\n\nThere are then three types of capsules that more directly impact the gameplay of Walk it Out! The first is a route capsule. While the game offers the player a choice of routes as they walk around the island, there are a number that are locked behind capsules that require the player to build up a number of chips. However, much like the bridges, they are necessary for exploring the entirety of Rhythm Island. Once a route capsule is activated, it remains permanently unlocked, but the route option is only unlocked one way: although the player can unlock one side of a path with a capsule, the route may still be locked with a second capsule on the other side of the path.\n\nAs alluded to earlier, the game makes use of the Nintendo Wii’s clock to determine whether the environment is experienced in a morning, afternoon or evening setting. A number of the game’s capsules can only be found at certain times of the day, so to assist players in being able to play during these times, players can collect magical clocks that allow them to change the time of day in-game. By collecting four clock capsules of the same hour, the player can then use a menu to change to this time at any point they wish.\n\nBut, perhaps most importantly, the game has a number of CD capsules to discover. When the player starts Walk it Out!, they only have access to 15 of the game’s 120 music tracks, providing approximately 36 minutes’ worth of tunes. Similar to the magic clock capsules, if a player collects four capsules of the same CD, that then unlocks a new music track the player can listen to from that point forward. This tasks the player with tracking down more than 400 CD capsules in order to have the complete track list, and similar to other hidden items, there are certain CD capsules that can only be found at specific times of the day.\n\nThe music might lean on the side of being repetitive at first, but when the player is aware of how unlocking the content works, they should be able to unlock new content at a decent pace. There is a wide variety of music genres included in Walk it Out!, and when more music is available, the player can take more advantage of the playlist functions to tailor the music to their liking.\n\nStill, from the get-go, players can edit the default playlist to toggle out songs they do not care for. When all 120 tracks are available, this results in nearly four hours of music being available – not bad for a music game from this time frame.\n\nIn one last note relating to capsules, there are also settings options that allow you to alter how many chips are required to unlock them. The capsule value option can be set all the way down to very easy to adjust the costs down to 1/4 of normal, while an adjustment can be made to very hard in order to double the costs.\n\nSo, overall, Walk it Out! does give the player a wide range of small goals to work toward as they build a world and make it more vibrant over time. And as the player unlocks more routes, they can leave the main city area and move toward other varied terrain that includes beaches and piers, rural areas and mountain paths. While nothing on its own may seem overwhelmingly rewarding, I feel like the game does meet the goal of finding small ways to encourage players to return to it repeatedly and stick with it over time.\n\nMy personal experience with Walk it Out!\n\nI should have known better with Walk it Out! being an active/exercise game, but my real goal going into it was to merely sample it enough to get a taste of what the game was about and unlock all of the music content so I could enjoy the original tracks. On top of the process of just getting the game, the work required to unlock all of the music was more than I had bargained for, and that’s why I am here about a month and a half after the release date anniversary of Walk it Out! still typing about it.\n\nTo soak in the original design intent of Walk it Out!, I played it for one full week legitimately on its default settings. My only available control option at this time was the Nintendo Wii nunchuk setting, so I put on my workout shorts, placed the nunchuk in my pocket and got to work.\n\nThe game is just looking for a waggle input on the nunchuk, and placing it in my pocket and walking, Walk it Out! did a serviceable job of recognizing my inputs. It wasn’t perfect, but, overall, its mistimings were more of recognizing an input earlier than intended and giving me a great rating instead of a perfect rating. Again, the focus in this game should be the activity, and it isn’t intended to be played as a traditional rhythm game – I absolutely got some miss ratings I didn’t feel I deserved, but, overall, Walk it Out! does a fine job of getting its intended basics correct.\n\nI did the lap around the track of the stadium, and then I was set free onto Rhythm Island. My copy of the game came complete with the instruction manual, but there isn’t a lot of detail to it (more on this later). As a result, I began by wandering around and clicking on random capsules. I didn’t have a lot of direction at first, but that was fine. The game was unfolding organically for me, and when you start out, there is something new to see around every corner.\n\nThankfully, the nunchuk input is based only on motion, so I was able to walk around in small paths around my room instead of trying to march in place. This helped my walking motions out a lot when my only focus at the moment was in collecting chips.\n\nI’ve sampled a lot of exercise-based video games, and while Walk it Out! got me active and I’m sure it burnt a few calories, I can’t say I felt like it ever gave me a full workout. Walk it Out! surely isn’t as intense as other video games are intended to be, so I suppose the practicality of the exercise is based on what level of activity you are looking for. If you’re looking for a low-impact game that will at most clam up your skin with sweat, Walk it Out! might be a game for you.\n\nAfter the first week, I needed to step things up and get the content unlocked. It was at this point I toggled some of the settings to eliminate any penalties and reduce the costs of the capsules. There were still times where I did the intended activity and walked to the game, but I’ll fully admit there were other times when I would hold the nunchuk in my hand and shake it while doing other things on my computer. Also, instead of aimlessly wandering around, I started making full use of the map to specifically track down the CD pieces.\n\nObviously, this isn’t the intended play methodology if you are playing the game as an activity, but I had reached a point where I needed to accelerate the unlock process, and the music in the game had become my full-blown priority.\n\nI uncovered 100% of the game’s map in 4 hours and 44 minutes of in-game time, and unlocked all of the game’s routes in a play time of 7 hours and 46 minutes. Remember, I had set the game to have capsules unlock at 1/4 of their original costs, so if you are trying to play through this legit, these times would probably at least double.\n\nWith everything in play, including all routes and a majority of the magic clocks, I managed to unlock every music track in Walk it Out! in 8 hours and 52 minutes of in-game time. I didn’t expect to have to unlock so much of the content, but, again, it makes sense in developing the game so players return to it. And while the final few capsules were a bit of a slog to discover, for the majority of the time, I was actually engaged with the gameplay and didn’t mind the exploration aspects.\n\nFor a game that never released in Japan, I have to say Walk it Out! largely hits the notes you would expect from a rhythm game coming out of that territory for the time. You obviously need those licensed tracks to pull in the casual crowd in the U.S., but Walk it Out! is still loaded with songs coming from genres such as J-pop complete with Japanese lyrics, eurobeat, trance and happy hardcore. You also get a variety of other niche genres that include disco, swing and mambo. It’s a great mix, and it actually largely suits my tastes, seemingly being pulled from a DanceDanceRevolution title such as DDR Universe 3. (GemuBaka happens to feature an archived interview done with Hiro Chiwata on Konami’s DanceDanceRevolution Universe 3)\n\nSo, what do I think of Walk it Out!? My personal opinion is the game is serviceable, and not deserving of the knee-jerk backlash it received when it was announced in 2009. I understand the development decisions made to craft a very basic concept that unfolds in multiple ways over a period of time, so on paper, the mechanics of Walk it Out! are indeed very solid.\n\nI would largely just say that Walk it Out! isn’t so much a game for me, as the actual rhythm elements are fairly shallow. The music list is definitely very intriguing to me, but if I judged Walk it Out! solely on its rhythm mechanics, it does fall short. Also, I very much enjoy walking outside on nature trails, so I would choose to do that instead of firing up a game like Walk it Out!\n\nBut, again, the rhythm element is only a small piece of the overall whole at play in Walk it Out! I would more so say Walk it Out! isn’t a game for me as opposed to trying to call it bad. I definitely understand other people would find the world building to be interesting, and other people would be attracted to simpler, lower-impact exercises, especially when you consider the casual audience of the Nintendo Wii. It was certainly worth it for me to experience Walk it Out! in 2024 at the low cost of $10, so I can’t say I would discourage someone from checking it out when it typically costs $5-10 these days … if you can find the thing.\n\nThe Walk it Out! songlist\n\nFor reference, here is the full songlist of Walk it Out!, ordered by the number the music track is assigned in the game:\n\n1 Ripin’ 2 Tripin’ by Fracus – Rock – 80BPM\n\n2 One Night Gig by oo39.com – House – 130BPM\n\n3 Outta My Way by Smashtrax – Rock – 150BPM (default)\n\n4 Return My Heart by Walt Gaisford – Latin – 120BPM\n\n5 Kiss Me Through the Phone by Soulja Boy – Hip Hop – 150BPM\n\n6 Sunny Afternoon by Studio Bongo Mango feat. chico – House – 130BPM\n\n7 Situation Critical by Tino Saiki – Pop – 106BPM\n\n8 polychrome by FAT*MAN – Trance – 140BPM\n\n9 Still Shine … – Suzuyo Miyamoto (Produced by kors k) – J Pop – 170BPM\n\n10 Encore! – oo39.com – Pop – 125BPM\n\n11 Psychoanalysis by nc ft.

HIYORI – Dancehall – 115BPM\n\n120 Sakura in the Galaxy by Takuya Hanaoka – J Pop – 145BPM\n\nThe game indicates it has licensed tracks, but these are divided into master recordings (the originals from the artists as you would hear on the radio) and cover recordings (notable songs not performed by the original artist).\n\nThe master recordings include “Boom Boom Pow” by The Black Eyed Peas, “Closer” by Ne-Yo, “Clumsy” by Fergie, “Get Ur Freak On” by Missy Elliot, “Hot N Cold” by Katy Perry, “How Do You Sleep?” by Jesse McCartney, “Kiss Me Through the Phone” by Soulja Boy, “La La Land” by Demi Lovato and “When I Grow Up” by The Pussycat Dolls. The cover recordings include “Crazy in Love,” “Holiday,” “September,” “Vacation,” “Walking on Sunshine” and “What is Love?”\n\nWalk it Out! features these licensed tracks, plus some of the Konami in-house music artists, but there are also a number of tracks licensed in from independent labels as well. This includes big idea studios (Tino Saiki, Walt Gaisford), reload co., ltd. (a wide variety of artists providing songs such as Everybody (Nufoundation Remix) and Ripin’ 2 Trippin’), Studio Bongo Mango (which also includes the apostrophe fish song Aria on G-Strings on top of everything containing the Studio Bongo Mango credit), noisycroak Co., Ltd. (from artist nc), Smashtrax Music LLC and oo39.com.\n\nI’ll get to more information later, but I don’t have a listing of where all of the music tracks can be located. Overall, though, you can use the map in the menu to see any of the nearby capsules, and if you specifically target the CD capsules, you’ll be able to scoop them up. The map even tells you what number the capsule is tied to, so you can use the music listing to see how many pieces of a track you already have and target individual numbers if you wish.\n\nThe post-game research\n\nTo wrap up the feature, I waited until I had my personal experience with Walk it Out! and then did a small dive into what can still be found online about the game today.\n\nI’ve already gone over the negative responses the game received when it was announced and just released in 2010. This is normally when I would say something to the degree of “I don’t think this game is nearly as bad as the internet would have you believe,” but, goodness, did this game have a positive community behind it after it released.\n\nWalk it Out! had an official community page on Facebook, and it routinely made posts through March 30, 2012, which was more than two years after the game first released. A lot of this was simple posting encouraging people to share their results and fitness goals, but it managed to collect nearly 4,500 followers over its time. I am certainly not a Facebook person, or really for social media period, but I’m kind of taken aback that this page serves as the remaining true look at how players viewed Walk it Out! that is still available online.\n\nThe page starts out slow with basic game announcements and photos, and there are a few funny comments such as a discussion about someone looking for the game because their son was photographed for the game’s cover and comments about how he didn’t get a free copy of the game for it. Walk it Out! doesn’t even register on Metacritic because it only received two reviews designated as “critical reviews” – but these weighed in at 30 and 55 out of 100.\n\nHowever, shortly after release the Facebook page notes Amazon user reviewers were trickling in and keeping the game at a 4 out of 5 average. To my best guess, this is how the casual gaming snowball started rolling for Walk it Out!\n\nI hesitate to call early 2010 as part of the end-life of the Nintendo Wii, but with the Nintendo Wii U on the horizon, I’m guessing Konami didn’t exactly press millions of copies of this game. And, to further complicate matters, video game sales in the United States have a history of being extremely difficult to accurately trace unless a company directly tells you … which probably won’t happen unless it sells well.\n\nOn Feb. 2, 2010, though, the Walk It Out! Facebook page proudly announced it was hearing reports the initial Amazon stock of the game was completely sold out. USA Today was shared as giving the game 4 out of 4 stars (unfortunately it appears the USA Today digital archives cut off in 2012), and the restocking of the game at Amazon placed it as a Gold Box Deal of the Day – the game initially shipped at a retail price of $29.99, and the sale cut it to $19.98. The page started posting other online reviews of the game that shared the positivity, and TVScreeners.com was noted as adding Walk it Out! to its 2010 Mother’s Day gift guide (oddly enough, I checked this feature out, and it only specifically mentions DanceDanceRevolution Hottest Party 3 among other active Nintendo Wii video games).\n\nA user on the page had commented Walk it Out! had broken into the top-50 best-selling video games in late March, being noted as #49 on the list on March 21, 2010. People began helping and encouraging each other on the page, and Konami was continually adding more maps and links to fleshed-out FAQs that were once available on Konami’s support page on its official website.\n\nWe’ll never know exactly how much Walk it Out! sold or if it was financially successful, but given historical posting, it is suggested Konami had managed to hook a dedicated following for this game title. Multiple people had posts detailing how they had completed the game and reset the island to make second and third trips through the game, and there were multiple requests for a sequel or at least an expansion to the original game with different places to walk and new music.\n\nOf course, a sequel never ended up happening, but the online attitudes AFTER the game released compared to the attitudes before the game released absolutely blindsided me. Even to this day, Amazon’s listing for Walk it Out! has it holding strong at a rating of 4.2 out of 5 after 785 ratings (and whatever this would ultimately mean: it sat as the #428 best-selling Nintendo Wii game on March 1, 2024).\n\nAgain, video game sales in the United States tend to be very poorly tracked, so a site such as VGChartz is the best guess we can take on the subject matter. According to VGChartz, Walk it Out! sold approximately 350,000 copies in North America, and it suggests other territories added nearly 100,000 copies to the sales total. Giving these figures some wiggle room, it is in the realm of possibility Walk it Out! could have sold as high as 500,000 copies worldwide.\n\nMultiple message boards that are still accessible have users talking positively about the game, mostly stemming from someone originally asking about it in 2010 or 2011 and having others weigh in. There are also multiple post-release reviews, some even coming as late as 2016, that bill Walk it Out! as an encouraging and fun experience.\n\nSo, I suppose I don’t need to step in and defend Walk it Out! against those who haven’t touched it and consider it a “dumb idea.” Walk it Out! might actually be a secret success that was covered up over time, but you actually don’t have to look very hard with online searches to find people speaking very positively about this game title.\n\nThe surge in interest in Walk it Out! also resulted in Konami developing multiple maps to help people around the island. I’m sure this was the intention from the beginning based on the instruction booklet included with the game, but to save on printing costs since this was a time frame where general “North American” copies of games were pressed and had instructions in English, French and Spanish, there was a “full” version of the instruction booklet online.\n\nIt’s also been noted Konami at one time had a full support section on the game to answer a lot basic questions, but it also supposedly had a full listing of every item location in the game. However, these listings were added when Konami moved over to the Parature support system, and I can find no way to access these in 2024, even with the Wayback Machine. I’ll be perfectly honest and say I don’t have it in me to go back and create such a listing from scratch.\n\nKonami also started finding a foothold in education around this time, and a press release from the company stated it would provide STARS Classified Schools with copies of DanceDanceRevolution and Walk it Out! I’ll make the note that Konami, in its own words, states both titles are “widely-successful fitness games,” so there is another vague feather we can put into the cap of Walk it Out!\n\nThis educational program was a partnership with the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, presenting copies of both games to newly-distinguished STARS Schools at a national convention held March 19, 2010.\n\nDirectly from this Konami press release: “DanceDanceRevolution and Walk It Out! have been proven to be extremely effective ways of promoting weight loss among today’s young people and the games fit in perfectly as part of the physical education curriculum in our nation’s schools,” said Shinji Hirano, President of Konami Digital Entertainment Inc., “DanceDanceRevolution and Walk It Out! are not only innovative fitness games, but they are fun and entertaining ways for kids and adults to develop healthy habits and a fitness-oriented lifestyle.”\n\nOn the topic of education, it’s also worth noting it was beginning to look like the songs made original to Walk it Out! might have at one time been completely trapped exclusively to that game. However, Konami eventually released a “classroom edition” of DanceDanceRevolution that featured an impressive number of songs. Padding out this song list are the songs that were added to Walk it Out! It’s extremely unlikely someone will be able to experience this DDR edition now, but it’s good to know something else came of the efforts of these music artists.\n\nSo, on that note, that’s Konami’s Walk it Out! in more than 10,000 words. That’s at least 5,000 more words than I ever expected to be able to type out about this game. Still, experiencing Walk it Out! was a complete journey – from finding the website of Kinuyo Yamashita, to tracking down the game, to combing through it for its music contents and learning more about things such as A.I. Co., Ltd., and remembering the Xavix existed, this was one of the more personally-fulfilling features I’ve ever written for GemuBaka. It was a nearly six-month journey for something maybe 10 people tops will ever read … but that’s what GemuBaka is all about – filling in those online blanks about video games.\n\nThank you Kinuyo Yamashita! I’m a fan of your songs in Walk it Out! I hope you are well and still making music out there in some capacity. And to sum the game up for the entire reason I sought it out in the first place: the music is pretty good; not quite a Bemani hidden gem, but I definitely got my $10 value."
