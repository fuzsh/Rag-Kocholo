As I became president of WWS, Kaz Hirai, the president of SCE at that time, asked me to base in Tokyo to be able to work closely with PlayStation’s hardware team. SCE was just starting the development of PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4, and Kaz wanted to change SCE so that new platform development would be done in collaboration between the hardware and game development teams. I was afraid that by moving to Japan, I might become detached from the new developments in the Western video game market. So I started to listen to podcasts while I commuted to the ofﬁce every day. I quickly became a fan of Chris Kohler, the host of the Game|Life Podcast for WIRED. His deep understanding of how the video game industry works, shown in his commentary on the news and delivered in his radio voice, made my train commute entertaining and informative every week. It had become such a part of my life that once when he was busy and skipped a couple of episodes, I tweeted to him demanding that he not skip any more! Oftentimes on the podcast, he showed his love of Japanese games and culture and his almost obsessive level of collector mentality for classic video game cartridges. It was well beyond a typical geek American video game journalist. I only recently learned about his experience living in Japan as a student and his Japanese language skills when we had a dinner in a Tokyo restaurant during Tokyo Game Show week in 2015. So when he asked me to write a foreword for the re-release of his ﬁrst book, I was very happy and excited, as he offered me a copy of both the original English version and the Japanese localized version to read. No need to mention that both copies were kept in mint condition! This book, written from 2001 to 2004, analyzes classic Japanese games released during the NES-SNES-PS1 era, focusing on the innovation that games like Donkey Kong, Super Mario Brothers, Dragon Quest, and the Final Fantasy series have brought to the game industry. Rich in data and\n\nmeticulously dissecting the game design of some of the early games (who would have thought Donkey Kong was the start of video game narrative!), the book is full of his respect and affection for these Japanese games and the game developers who were the pioneers of the time. The year 2016 is looking like a potential resurgence of Japanese games, seen in the passionate reactions to the E3 announcements of Final Fantasy VII Remake, Shenmue III, and The Last Guardian. This book will provide a compelling explanation why the classic Japanese games still ﬁll a special place in the hearts of Western gamers today. In the future, I would like to see Chris write about Japanese games’ “decline” and potential “resurgence” that followed the periods covered in this book, and I would be very happy to write a foreword again. SHUHEI YOSHIDA President Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios\n\n• • • • Introduction to the 2016 Edition • • •• Over the past ten years, I’ve consistently ﬁelded a single question from readers who’ve found me through my writing at WIRED or elsewhere: When will Power-Up be back in print? Or, as is usually the case in the last few years, when will it be available as an ebook? Spoiler: Thanks to the enthusiastic people at Dover Publications, you are now holding it. Now, what will you ask me for? Probably nothing else ever again. I hope that the actual book Power-Up measures up to whatever expectations that you may have built up in your head about it. It was written by a 24-year-old kid who bears little resemblance to the person writing this introduction. When I wrote Power-Up, the ﬁrst book written in English speciﬁcally about Japanese games, it was because I wanted to show how Japan’s unlikely dominance of the new storytelling medium of the video game had stemmed from the country’s unusually rich history of visual storytelling culture, and give a variety of views onto just how robust and unique Japan’s culture of video games was even from its earliest days. When I was researching this book, scraping together whatever information I could ﬁnd, some of the interviewees had rarely, if ever, been interviewed at all before. Since then, a staggering amount of in-depth research has been undertaken, and continues to be undertaken, on Japanese game development and culture, past and present. I certainly hope even a little bit of this was inspired in one way or another by Power-Up. All this is to say that we do not present Power-Up today as any sort of deﬁnitive guide to Japanese games, but as something of a historical artifact of its own, a snapshot of what things looked like from my perspective in 2004. Besides ﬁxing a few minor errors that snuck into the original version, we haven’t altered the structure. In the new chapter for this edition, rather than attempt to encapsulate a decade-plus of Japanese game history into a few thousand words, I’ve\n\nhoned in on what I believe to be the most important story of the last decade, one that I think will be told time and time again in the years to come. Thanks for reading, then and now.\n\n• • • • Introduction to the 2004 Edition Video Games Are Good For You • • • • Like Nintendo’s Mario, this book has had many lives. The ﬁrst and oldest bits were written right around Christmas of 2001, the ﬁrst chapters of my graduation thesis at Tufts University. I submitted it under the title The Cinematic Japanese Video Game that spring. It received highest honors and I graduated with a BA in Japanese. Months later I was off to Kyoto, Japan on a one-year Fulbright fellowship to turn The Cinematic Japanese Video Game into Power-Up. That’s the version I tell at parties. The truth is that I have been writing this book in my head since I was eleven years old in sixth grade, and I decided that I wanted to be a video game journalist when I grew up. (I still do.) I was born after video games, and I’m not exaggerating when I say that I don’t remember a time in my life without them. One of my earliest memories is of my father programming a Blackjack game on our then state-of-the-art TRS-80 home computer with its 4K of RAM and cassette tape drive storage. Two years later our whole family would gather around our Atari 800XE to play Frogger and the hundreds of other games we had on ﬂoppy disk. At the same time, my father tooled around with an Atari VCS video game system at work and got it to play copies of games that they had burned onto rewriteable chips, just to see if they could do it. And then came the Nintendo Entertainment System. We got it on Easter morning, 1988. The Action Set with the Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt cartridge, two controllers, and a Zapper light pistol. Super Mario Bros. ﬁlled our days until we’d saved the Princess. This was something we’d never experienced with any of our drawer full of Atari games. This was a symphony of colors and music. The game play control was sublime. The characters leapt off the screen. At eight, then nine, then ten years old I was ﬁnally old enough to really start to appreciate what I was experiencing. By then, video games had\n\noutgrown the simple shooting and jumping contests that were popular in arcades when I was a toddler. They were vast, open-ended worlds like The Legend of Zelda, ﬁlled with exploration and storylines. What I loved about video games at that age was the same thing that I loved about books. At school, I would draw Mario and the rest of the characters from the games in my notebooks, ﬁrst just pictures with a few words and then full-blown comics, ﬁrst imitations of the ones I’d read in Nintendo Power magazine and then original stories. And at some point, probably through ‘behind-the-scenes’ articles in Nintendo Power, I realized that all these games that I loved came from Japan. So my eyes opened to the other forms of Japanese popular culture that had begun to trickle into suburban Connecticut by the early nineties: manga comic books in translation, usually on a tiny out-of-the-way rack in the comic book store in the mall, and whatever anime was on television at the time, mostly heavily edited and English-dubbed shows like Sailor Moon. I chose Tufts University in large part because of the school’s wide selection of Japanese language and culture offerings. Immersing myself into innovative courses like Japanese Visual Culture and Japanese Film opened my eyes, because I was beginning to realize that so many of the theories about Japanese art that I was learning applied directly to video games. It started to become clear why Japanese video games had become so popular and commercially successful worldwide. My struggle to explain this phenomenon culminated in the chapters that follow. I am pleased and humbled that you have decided to read this book. Before we begin, some brief words on the research and quotes. Since Power-Up began as a thesis paper long before I had any access to face-toface interviews with developers, many of the quotes came from interviews published in other books, magazines, and websites. In general I have kept the best quotes obtained in this early research, sometimes because I was not granted a face-to-face interview with the designer and sometimes because my time with them was limited, and I did not wish to retread ground that had already been covered in interviews. I was fortunate enough while living in Kyoto to come across many interviews with game designers published in Japanese. In the cases where I felt sure that I could preserve the original meaning of the designer’s words, I have printed them in quotation form. In cases where I could not, I used the\n\ninterviews as a basis for narrating a series of events in my own words. I have footnoted the texts accordingly, especially in cases where a fact might not be considered common knowledge or may indeed be in dispute. In cases where the quote comes from an outside source, I have used the past tense (…he said). If the quote is from a personal interview, present tense (…he says) is used. I have tried my best to avoid the use of the ﬁrst person throughout except where absolutely necessary—for although I want to put Power-Up into context, I want the stories of the developers to come through with minimal editorializing by yours truly. And yet, just as in previous books on video game culture, it is impossible to escape the fact that my own childhood, adolescent, and adult tastes, experiences, and preferences have highly inﬂuenced the format and content of this one. I would like to see more recent games like Final Fantasy VII dissected and analyzed as I have examined the earlier NES versions. But just as authors before me wrote their books about Asteroids and Defender, and I am writing mine about Mario and Final Fantasy, it is up to the next generation to analyze the games they grow up with. With that out of the way, “Let’s-a-go.”\n\n1 • • • • Super Mario Nation • • • • Games are popular art, collective, social reactions to the main drive or action of any culture. [They]...are extensions of social man and of the body politic... As extensions of the popular response to the workaday stress, games become faithful models of a culture. They incorporate both the action and the reaction of whole populations in a single dynamic image... The games of a people reveal a great deal about them. —Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man\n\nThe preceding quote served as the epigraph to David Sheff’s seminal 1993 book Game Over, a riveting, novelesque portrait of the people behind the rise of Nintendo, the world’s largest video game software publisher and, at the time, the dominant force in the video game industry. Ultimately, Game Over was a journalistic chronicle of international business intrigue and courtroom drama, but the choice of quote revealed that Sheff was thinking, too, about the cultural aspects of Nintendo video games—backed up by later admissions that it was his son’s love for the games that initially drew him to the topic. There’s only one problem: Sheff was writing about video game culture solely as it pertained to America. And although there is much to say about Japanese video games in American culture, the fact is that the games Sheff was writing about are not products or models of our culture. They are products and models of Japanese culture, the “action and the reaction” of the Japanese population, presented nearly unaltered for our consumption. And what consumers we are. Video game sales in the US have skyrocketed from a decade ago—3.2 billion dollars in 1995 to 6.9 billion in\n\n2002, and Japanese-developed games have historically made up a large part of that sum. Many Japanese games, particularly those developed by Kyotobased Nintendo Co., Ltd., top bestseller lists worldwide. Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros. (1985) remains the single best-selling video game of all time, although other Nintendo titles like The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time and of course the various iterations of Pokémon have been no slouches. Throughout the brief history of video games, Japanese-developed titles have set the world on ﬁre—Space Invaders in the seventies, Pac-Man in the early eighties, Super Mario Bros. in 1985, Street Fighter II in 1991, Final Fantasy VII in 1997. And even when a non-Japanese game becomes a breakout hit in the US or elsewhere, it is often heavily based on elements pioneered in Japanese software and released for a Japanese-developed hardware system: Tomb Raider on the Sega Saturn in 1995, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City on the Sony PlayStation 2 in 2002. So the question is, why? Why were Japanese video games so popular worldwide, from the earliest days, with little to no modiﬁcation necessary? After all, the same thing has not been true for, say, Japanese ﬁlms. And while Japanese animation and comics are quickly attaining mainstream popularity in the Western world, this is a very recent phenomenon. Only a handful of Americans knew about manga in 1980. Meanwhile, the rest of the country had Pac-Man fever. And it was a fever brought on in part by the infectious, manga-style Japanese design sense of that video game. Why, indeed? Well, to ﬁnd the answer we should ﬁrst ask: what separates the ﬁrst video games from the video games of today? The immediate answer would seem to be that advances in computer processing power over the past four decades have produced video game hardware capable of superior graphics, and that the advent of the compact disc allows for more complex game designs thanks to its high memory storage capacity. But this is not the entire answer. It is indeed true that the video games of today are far more technologically advanced than the ﬁrst commercial home video game system. That was called Odyssey, which was released by the television company Magnavox in 1972 and sold for $99.99. Odyssey could, at best, generate a white line running down the blank television screen and three white dots: two “paddles” and one “ball” that bounced between them, a television tennis game. Odyssey played other types of games as well, but all of them featured only a few small, monochrome dots appearing onscreen at once.\n\nOdyssey and later home video games of the time were looked upon as disposable playthings and not permanent additions to one’s home television set. This was, in part, because the earliest game systems were what are called dedicated hardware. New games could not be added to the system; only the games built into the hardware could be played. Furthermore, these games were simplistic, repetitive, and, after a short time, boring. This sort of mentality—that video game hardware would quickly become boring to the consumer—started to shift with the availability of programmable hardware, consoles that featured no built-in games but allowed the user to play new ones stored on separate media. Programmable hardware helped begin the evolution of a video game machine from a simple plaything to a staple of the home entertainment center, the difference between a music box and a phonograph. Programmable systems also made it possible for game designers to create their work and sell software without having to supply the hardware as well. Michael Katz, formerly of the video game company Sega, remembered this from the days when more and more video game publishers were starting to pop up in Silicon Valley: “There were so many cartridges already available to Atari players from Atari, that we couldn’t imagine that any consumer needed more cartridges. Nobody thought that they [consumers] would perceive any kind of difference in the graphics...and we couldn’t conceive of anyone paying $3 to $5 more at retail for cartridges from a company that no one had ever heard of.”1\n\nImagine such a comment being applied to another medium: There were so many books available to readers that we couldn’t imagine that any reader needed more books. Nobody thought that readers would perceive any kind of difference in the words, and we couldn’t conceive of anyone paying $3 to $5 more for books from a company that no one had ever heard of. Nonsense, right? But this made perfect sense when talking about the video games of the time, because a game was a game was a game. Most every video game being sold was a simple shooting or driving contest and there was little to differentiate, in the mind of the consumer, one cartridge from another. Games in the 1970s and early 1980s had no clear ending, but instead just continued with repetitive action for a few minutes until the player lost his last spaceship or crashed his tiny, monochrome car. Today, game players spend hours immersed in role-playing games like Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy, puzzling over plot details, intricacies of the worlds they explore, the powers of their characters, and their relationships. So it is not, in fact, simply that today’s video games are larger and more graphically intricate: it is that the actual content and design—the very makeup of the games—has changed. ••• Henry Jenkins, director of the Comparative Media Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called today’s video games “virtual play spaces which allow home-bound children...to extend their reach, to explore, manipulate, and interact with a more diverse range of imaginary places than constitute the often drab, predictable, and overlyfamiliar spaces of their everyday lives.”2 Jenkins elaborates, showing the various ways that modern-day video game play echoes nineteenth-century boy culture. He writes that nineteenth-century boys would draw on the adventure stories of the day as a template for their own play—reading a book about pirates and then playing as pirates, for example.3 Jenkins then noted that today’s video games depend heavily on “fantasy role-playing, with different genres of games allowing children to imagine themselves in alternative...roles or situations.”4 This description is not restricted to the genre known as “role-playing games,” which are elaborate story-based strategy games. Even today’s simpler, action-oriented games feature speciﬁc characters and unique situations. The characters and\n\nscenarios in all of these video games are, therefore, serving the same imagination-igniting function as the adventure books. Thus, perhaps the most important difference between the earliest video games and today’s games is the insertion of what could be called cinematic elements. Rather than stick ﬁgures or spaceships representing the player, today’s games star fully ﬂeshed-out characters with backgrounds, motivation, and perhaps development throughout the story. Games incorporate narrative; they are built around a story line. And most games today include what are referred to as cut scenes or cinematics—sometimes non-interactive, often ﬁlm-like sequences that set up or advance the story, which is typically a complex, lengthy affair. Cinematic elements are appealing to game players because they can enhance the game experience. Game designers quickly learned the value of ﬂashy reward screens for a job well done, of giving players concrete goals with set rewards to strive for. If a game has likeable characters, players can become attached to those characters and more deeply involved in the game. And if a game has a storyline, players have a concrete incentive to “beat” the game: they want to complete the story, to bring closure to the narrative. This revolution came about as a result of Japanese inﬂuence on this American pastime: these cinematic game elements that are so common today originated in Japanese video games of the early eighties. In one of the ﬁrst books ever written on video games, a 1982 volume called Video Invaders, author Steve Bloom wrote that “the Japanese have a ‘comical sense,’ and are great fans of comic books, sitcoms, and cartoons. Taito America’s president, Jack Mittel, explained: ‘They [the Japanese] want more of a story line, more of a Walter Mitty experience that’s like a whole movie...’ ”5 Even the name of Bloom’s book illustrates the huge impact that Japanese games had on American game culture from the ﬁrst: the name Bloom chose for his volume, Video Invaders, is a play on the name of a video game developed by the Japanese company Taito, Space Invaders. Bloom goes on to describe the then-new Japanese game Donkey Kong (which would spawn the world-famous Mario series, although Bloom did not know it at the time) as “another bizarre cartoon game, courtesy of Japan.”6\n\nWhy Japan? “Japan,” wrote Alex Kerr in his provocative book Dogs And Demons: The Fall Of Modern Japan, “while maintaining a competent standard in\n\nmany industries, and intellectual or artistic pursuits, does not lead the way in any single ﬁeld.”7 This is not entirely the case. Though Kerr lays out a wellresearched case on the decline of Japanese traditional art, architecture, cinema, and technology, perhaps the Japanese video game is the exception that proves the rule. These “bizarre cartoon games” were coming from a country and a people in love with cartoons and comics. Frederik L. Schodt, who has written two books and countless articles on Japanese comics, wrote in 1983 that the Japanese consider them to be “an effective...way of transmitting information, and they use them everywhere... Aiding in this explosion in the use of cartoons is the fact that so many people learn how to draw them... For younger generations comics are the common language... [They] live in an age that emphasizes the image...[and] naturally have no bias against comics. They are, appropriately, referred to in Japan as the shikaku sedai, the ‘visual generation.’ ”8 Not only that, but there were aspects of Japanese design sense that lent themselves speciﬁcally to the medium of the video game. Japanese anime characters, heavily inﬂuenced by the style of manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka, are cartoonish and unrealistically proportioned, even when the stories they tell are deadly serious. In his book Understanding Comics, Scott McCloud noted that Japanese manga artists prize abstract, iconic characters, and that abstraction in general is key to identiﬁcation with the characters in a story. In the book, which is presented in comic form, he draws himself, the narrator, in an abstract style for this very purpose of engaging the reader.9 “This way of drawing characters,” noted J.C. Herz in her book Joystick Nation, “translated easily into early video games, which didn’t have the graphic resolution to represent characters with adult proportions. Small, cute characters had fewer pixels per inch and were easier to use, and so video games borrowed, for reasons of expediency, what manga had developed as a matter of convention.”10 The Japanese believe this style to be mukokuseki, a word that literally means “lacking nationality” but is used mainly to refer to the “erasure of racial or ethnic characteristics and contexts from a cultural product.”11 Indeed, though Japanese anime character designs lack any ethnically Japanese features, the style itself can hardly be said to “lack nationality” when it is a unique creation of Japanese artists, completely different from American or European comic artwork. *\n\n*Sometimes, of course, Japanese video games do have certain Japanese ethnic or cultural context. These are usually removed or replaced if the game comes to the US—see chapters 8 and 9.\n\nMore generally, the Japanese have a centuries-old tradition of visual culture. One might go so far as to say that the image, rather than the word, has always been at the forefront of Japanese culture. From the ukiyo-e woodblock prints of the “ﬂoating world” to the highly stylized visual experiences that comprise the traditional Noh and kabuki theater, from the sexually charged shunga prints that gave way to vivid and chilling gekiga “ﬁlm books” that were the precursors to modern manga comics, in every era of Japanese history we ﬁnd that the most popular art forms were visual in nature. One might even say that haiku—short Japanese poems that present, in as few words as possible, a vivid image of a seasonal nature scene—are visually oriented. Even the Japanese written language is made up of pictographs that come from representational drawings. The notion of the image grew up differently in the Western world, where picture books, comic books, and chapter books with illustrations are looked down upon as children’s entertainment. A child who reads books without illustrations is said to be reading on an adult level; an adult who avidly reads comic books would be thought strange. But the shikaku sedai (a phrase that now describes even today’s middle-aged Japanese) privilege the image as a method of communication and so have a love for comics and animation. “One result” of this outlook, wrote Schodt, “is that many talented young people—who in other times might have become novelists or painters—are becoming professional comic artists.”12 And in the early ’80s, as Schodt was writing these words, many of these young people were becoming video game designers. Their American contemporaries, meanwhile, seemed to have no idea what was going on. In Video Invaders, American game designer Tim Skelly, then of Cinematronics, attacked the Japanese game design philosophy, calling them “horrible copiers” and adding, “most of their games don’t cut it here anyway. I foresee them losing a lot of business here in the States.”13 In less than one year’s time, however, Cinematronics—and many companies like it—would be the ones losing a lot of business, as the video game market dried up in the United States. It was Japanese companies that would revive the US industry.\n\nWrote video game historian Leonard Herman, “At one time the United States had been the leader in all forms of manufacturing from automobiles to television and radios. As time passed, Japan...eventually took them over... [but] the only markets that they couldn’t take over were computers and video games. Computers appeared to be the only true American product remaining. Because they were small scale computers, video games were also an American phenomenon...until 1978 when Taito released Space Invaders and Japan quickly took over with an attack all of its own.”14 In 1983, the US video game market crashed. Video games still thrived in Japan, but American companies like Atari, Coleco, and Mattel were not able to keep the industry aﬂoat in the US. Many video game publishers went bankrupt by 1984. In 1985, Nintendo introduced its Famicom video game system in the United States, and along with it a full library of Japanese video games translated into English. In a year’s time, Nintendo had resurrected the dead video game market. American companies like Atari tried to compete but American video games could not stand up to games like Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros. Even today, thanks mostly to the early inﬂuence of Japanese “bizarre cartoon games,” a great many successful games in the US are Japanese. In their January 2002 issue, editors of the popular video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly voted for their favorite 100 games of all time. Of the 100 games listed: 86 had recognizable, distinct characters. 78 had a full story or story elements. 38 were role-playing games built entirely around a story progression. 93 were Japanese in origin.\n\nWhy it Matters: Video Games as Multicultural Gateway This book is intended to be a celebration of the art form of video games with an eye toward the positive aspects of the games. Other such books examining video games have not been so kind to the medium. Academic and journalistic books have attacked video games for being sexist, racist, violent, and ultimately harmful to children. The book that most typiﬁed this sense of\n\nhysteria was called Video Kids: Making Sense of Nintendo, written by University of Miami professor Eugene F. Provenzo, Jr. in 1991. In his book, Provenzo concluded that society had to “eliminate the violence, destruction, xenophobia, racism, and sexism that are so much a part of the world of Nintendo.”15 At the 1993 joint Congressional hearings on video game violence, Provenzo was called upon to testify as an expert witness. He repeated his ﬁndings at the hearings, testifying, “video games are overwhelmingly violent, sexist, and racist.”16 After his presentation, Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), the primary architect of the hearings, asked Provenzo to elaborate on his charge that Nintendo’s video games were racist. “In interviews with children,” replied Provenzo, “what I found was that they talked about the ninjas [enemy characters in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games] as being bad. Then [I] asked them about who ninjas were, and they [said they were]...the Japs and the Chinese. It turns out that they perceive Asians, any Asians, as being extremely violent, as being dangerous, as being evil.”17 Taken at face value, this provocative statement seems damning. But the text of his book tells a somewhat different story. In the chapter titled “Aggression and Video Games,” Provenzo described children’s involvement with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games: “One child presented a detailed description of weapons such as throwing stars and katangas [sic]. Signiﬁcantly, despite detailed knowledge of Ninja weaponry, most of the children interviewed seemed to have little understanding of where the Ninja came from or what they signiﬁed. A fourth grade boy explained, for example, that he wasn’t sure if the Ninja were Chinese or Japanese, but that the Chinese and Japanese were the enemies because “just because they are from Japan they might want to do something different from you. And they are dangerous because they might want to ﬁght with you.”18 Note that this one utterance from one fourth-grade child serves as Video Kids’ prima facie evidence of racism; the only ﬁnding that Provenzo offered in the entire book to back up his conclusion that Nintendo games were overwhelmingly racist. Confusingly, Provenzo even noted in his book that for the most part the children he interviewed had “little understanding” of\n\nwhat race ninja are. What the children did know was that the Ninja Turtles were turtles, and the enemy ninja were robots. It’s far-fetched to imagine that children might even consider robots and sea creatures to be of any particular race. Regardless of the hysteria that earlier books typiﬁed, later research—on the growing manga and anime boom in the US—started to tell a very different story about the perceptions of Asians, and Japanese in particular, that are held by American youth. Dr. Antonia Levi wrote in 1996 that, due to the proliferation of anime in American popular culture, “America’s Generation X and Japan’s shin jinrui will never again be complete strangers to one another.”19 “There we were, happily debating whether to focus education on multiculturalism or Western Civilization, and the kids made their own choice with anime and manga.”20 Academics like Levi and Susan J. Napier seem to be generally excited about the prospect of anime creating a generation of American young people who are culturally in tune with their Japanese counterparts. But do Japanese video games count? Napier explicitly made this connection in her book Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation, stating in her chapter on American anime fans that many of them “often [ﬁrst] come across anime in computer or video games” which would make an interest in anime “quite natural.” She did not cite examples of video games with anime inﬂuences or those based on anime series, but many of them made their way to the United States long before the manga or anime did: a game based on the adult-oriented spy thriller manga Golgo 13, for example, was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the US in 1988, well before the manga or anime. Frederik Schodt predicted this in 1983: “In the years to come, the sheer size and momentum of Japanese comics culture will make itself felt around the world indirectly, through the commercial spin-offs of toys, animation, picture books, video games...”21 Super Mario Bros. and Final Fantasy were not “spin-offs” of any particular anime, but the style of the games came out of a country whose booming comics and animation culture gave birth to them. So whether American children—or any of these researchers—knew it or not, Super Mario was a warm-up, an introduction to the unique visual style of the Japanese such that when a generation that had grown up on Nintendo was introduced to Akira or Princess Mononoke, there was something familiar about these cultural imports.\n\nOr, as game designer Keiichi Yano puts it, “Video games were the big can-opener.” Yano has a unique perspective on this phenomenon: born in Tokyo, he lived in Los Angeles until he was 20, moving back to his native Japan to design new and inventive video games like the critically acclaimed music game Gitaroo-Man. (He is interviewed in Chapter 5 of this volume.) Comics were for kids, animation was for kids to drag their parents to see, but video games were high technology, an exciting new form of entertainment that Mom and Dad enjoyed too. And there were no major barriers to the enjoyment of Japanese games by Americans. Early Japanese-developed games did not require language translation beyond a few simple sentences. Sometimes they were written entirely in English to begin with. Video games in general were a contemporary American invention, and there was nothing that clearly labeled newcomer Nintendo as Japanese. Early video games themselves were not acquainting American children with the full scope of Japanese culture in any signiﬁcant way, but they opened the doors. The results are evident. Many of today’s schoolchildren perceive Japan not as the anonymous enemy but as a great place to be; they want to live there, speak Japanese, and play the latest games without waiting for them to be released in the US. The younger ones love the anime version of the Pokémon video game, the older ones have moved up to Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball, and every day another middle-schooler discovers the postapocalyptic movie masterpiece Akira. Off to college, they enroll in courses on Japanese ﬁlm and discover Kurosawa. And they want to understand what they’re watching, so enrollment in Japanese language and culture courses has skyrocketed from pre-Nintendo levels. “What exactly is the cultural status of a Nintendo game,” asked Henry Jenkins, “based partially on American generic traditions or adopted from speciﬁc Western texts, drawing some of its most compelling iconography from Japanese graphic art, licensed by Japanese corporations, manufactured and designed by corporations in both the Americas and Asia, and for sale to both Japanese and American marketplaces?”22 It is difﬁcult to know if this question can ever be satisfactorily answered. In any case, the time is right to look at these games and the people who make them. For indeed, the games of a people reveal a great deal about them.\n\n2 • • • • An Early History of Cinematic Elements in Video Games • • • • Until the serious study and recording of the history of video games began in the early 1990s, most people were under the impression that the ﬁrst video game was Pong, the simple monochrome table tennis game that Atari released in late 1972. Pong was the simplest of games even by earlyseventies standards. Its only moving graphics were two white vertical “paddles” that moved up and down on either side of the screen and a square “ball” that bounced between them, and its lone sound effect was the eponymous “pong” that sounded when a ball bounced off the paddle. Pong’s simplicity certainly made it seem, especially in hindsight, like it must have been the ﬁrst video game. But it came chronologically after Magnavox’s Odyssey system, which was available in May 1972. Its high price ($99.99) kept it from success, along with the fact that it was available only in Magnavox stores, where salespeople hoping to make an extra sale gave the impression that it only worked on Magnavox TV sets. As an arcade game that could be enjoyed by anyone for a quarter, Pong was far better received. And in fact, it was greatly improved over the tennis game that Odyssey played; the graphics were higher-resolution, the sound was satisfying, the score was displayed onscreen, and the game play made more sense. * But it was still not the ﬁrst video tennis game. * Incredible as it is to believe, Odyssey’s tennis game required that players keep score on a piece of paper. Another way that the game play was enhanced is that the angle of rebound would change depending on where the ball hit the paddle, and the speed of rebound depended on how long the ball had been in play. With Odyssey, the player could put “English” on the ball after it had been hit by using a separate dial.\n\nNor was Pong the ﬁrst coin-operated arcade game. That was called Computer Space, and Nutting Associates, the company where Atari founder Nolan Bushnell was originally employed, produced it in 1971. Computer Space was a game for two players: each controlled a spaceship on the screen and tried to shoot down the other player. Although it was ﬁrst sold in 1971, it was in fact almost an exact copy of a game called Spacewar written by members of MIT’s Tech Model Railroad Club in 1961 for the PDP-1 computer.1 And although Spacewar and, later, Computer Space were popular with technology-savvy college students, the public shied away from the complexities of the game itself. Far from being simple and inviting, Computer Space featured complex physics and a lengthy instruction booklet attached to the machine, which explained how to use the various buttons that ﬁlled the front of the futuristic-looking cabinet. * This is all to say that the main reason Pong is often considered the ﬁrst video game is because it was the ﬁrst successful video game. Learning from his mistakes, Bushnell asked one of his ﬁrst employees at Atari, an engineer named Al Alcorn, to create as simple a game as possible. Two paddles, one ball, one line of impeccably succinct directions printed on the cabinet: “Avoid missing ball for high score.” The prototype Pong machine was placed in a Sunnyvale, California bar called Andy Capp’s Tavern—which also had a handful of pinball machines, jukeboxes, and a Computer Space2 —and was an instant success. By 1974, Atari-made Pong machines and many imitation versions could be found in bars and pool halls across the country, and home versions were popular Christmas gifts starting in 1975.\n\n* Ironically, Computer Space was almost exactly like a two-player version of Asteroids, which would become hugely popular in the US less than a decade later.\n\nPong crossed the Paciﬁc to Japan as early as 1973. Bushnell attempted to open a Japanese ofﬁce, but found—as most American companies do—that he could not make substantial inroads into the Japanese market without allying himself with an existing Japanese company. So he sold the Atari Japan operation to Masaya Nakamura, the head of a Tokyo-based amusement company called Nakamura Manufacturing Company, later shortened to Namco. Nakamura was a self-made businessman who started his company by operating and maintaining two coin-operated mechanical kiddie-horse rides that he had purchased second-hand. He set them up in one of the only locations he could, the roof of a Tokyo department store. By the time he was contacted by Bushnell, Nakamura was manufacturing and distributing his own rides and other amusement machines, and saw the acquisition of Atari Japan as the perfect way to expand his operations. His already-established connections gave Nakamura the distribution channels necessary to get arcade games into Japanese businesses. Still, though, Namco was lagging behind competitors like Taito. Taito, which is Japanese for “far east,” was a company established in 1953 by Michael Kogan, a Russian Jew who had moved to Tokyo. Taito’s original business was in importing coin-operated amusement machines like peanut vending devices. Later, Kogan began to brew and sell Japan’s ﬁrst domestic vodka. By 1954 Kogan was importing jukeboxes into the country; soon Taito was manufacturing its own. As Pong clones became big in America, the company started importing used Pong units, refurbishing them, and distributing them in Japan. Taito engineer Tomohiro Nishikado was with the company since these early days, and recalled later Taito’s ﬁrst experience with imported games. “When we ﬁrst started looking at these games, it was the opinion of management that it wouldn’t work. The price was too high—for one unit, they wanted from six to eight hundred thousand yen. And to look at it, it was just a box with a television and a dial. But we wanted to see if it would actually sell like they said it would, and so for the time being we bought just one.3 “We set it up in a test location, and it was surprisingly popular. Instantly, we realized: ‘This is going to be the era of video games.’ Management told\n\nus that we should be able to make our own, original games. And since there was nobody else in the company with experience in electrical circuits, this job fell to me. Just like that.” The ﬁrst “original” games that Nishikado designed were similar to the games that Nakamura was importing. Namco had Pong and the four-player Pong Doubles, Taito had Soccer and the four-player Davis Cup. In 1974 Taito released Speed Race, Japan’s ﬁrst driving video game, which used a realistic steering wheel as its controller instead of the off-the-shelf volumecontrol dials that were standard on Pong machines. Speed Race became the ﬁrst Japanese game imported into the US when an American pinball and video game distributor called Midway licensed it. The same year, Atari released its own driving game called Gran Trak 10, and driving became another important genre of arcade game. ••• A few years later, as “the era of video games” was bringing forth new ideas one after another, two games that proved highly popular in both countries began to add tiny elements of character and story into the arcade game formula. In Breakout (1976), developed by Atari, the player had to bounce a ball back to the top of the screen and “break” a wall of blocks one by one. Western Gun (1975), developed by Taito, featured two cowboys that shot at each other. These two games were still very limited by the technology of the time, which allowed only a few small, black-and-white images to be displayed. But Breakout and Western Gun illustrate the emerging difference between American and Japanese game design. Breakout was originally conceived as a one-player Pong variant (Pong and all its clones were two-players only). It was designed by a twenty-yearold Atari employee named Steve Jobs, who at the time was building the prototype of the Apple II personal computer in his garage with his partner Steve Wozniak, who worked for Hewlett-Packard but would come in to Atari to help his friend. The game that Jobs and Wozniak built for Atari had graphics even more abstract than Pong. At least Pong’s graphics were supposed to represent tennis rackets; Breakout’s lines and blocks were simply lines and blocks. The cabinet artwork on the ﬁnished game showed a cartoonish drawing of a prison convict breaking through a brick wall, but neither the imagery within the game itself nor the game play action suggested a prison-break theme.\n\nTo illustrate how Japanese game designers, even ones with a background in engineering, were thinking about video games at the time, this is what Tomohiro Nishikado had to say about Breakout: “Even though Breakout had simple graphics, it was interesting. At the time when we were thinking about how to add characters to the games, they were going in the total opposite direction... The Taito management guys were half-jokingly saying, ‘What is this? Taito is losing to America, aren’t we?’ but in actuality, they were embarrassed.”4 Breakout was perhaps even more successful in Japan than in the US. Atari had granted Masaya Nakamura an exclusive license to distribute Breakout in Japan under the name Burokku-kuzushi (literally, “blockbusting”). But Atari insisted that they manufacture each system and send it to Nakamura. Unfortunately for Nakamura, the yakuza—Japanese organized crime gangs—began producing counterfeit Burokku-kuzushi machines by the truckful, and Nakamura was stuck. Without telling Atari, he decided to start producing the machines himself, and they were huge sellers. Atari later sued and won.\n\nMeanwhile, Nishikado at Taito was developing character-based games like Western Gun, which was released in the US, by Midway, as Gunﬁght. Few American players knew at the time that they were playing a Japanese game, but the difference was clear. Taito was adding characters and fragments of story. This is not to say that Western Gun had story sequences or ﬂeshed-out character designs, but it had artwork of wild west cowboys on\n\nthe cabinet, and the in-game graphics, with cacti, covered wagons, rocks, and player-characters that were identiﬁably human, matched the out-of-game artwork. Gunﬁght became Midway’s ﬁrst major video game hit.5 Its popularity could certainly be attributed to its originality amongst a ﬁeld of identical games. What made it original was its use of human characters in a modern setting. Rather than miniature shapes that represented either spaceships or abstract blocks, Gunﬁght featured almost cartoonish humans. The original Japanese advertisement ﬂyers for Western Gun showed that these were video game versions of Japanese manga characters. Of course, these manga-style drawings were not used in the US, and even if they were, nobody would know they were Japanese—how could cowboys be Japanese, anyway? And although Gunﬁght had no story sequences, nor its gunmen any personalities, besides yelling “GOT ME!” when they were shot, it at least drew upon the existing store of American ‘western’ ﬁlms and cowboy stories. And its characters, should the player choose, could easily be given personalities, because people know what cowboys look like, act like, and the reasons for which they might start shooting at each other.\n\nGunﬁght was important for another reason: an engineer named Dave Nutting reprogrammed the version that Midway released. The reprogrammed version was the ﬁrst arcade game to use a microprocessor. Taito’s original version, like every other game prior, had used integrated\n\ncircuits. The point was not lost on Nishikado: “As a game, I thought our version of Western Gun was more fun. But just from using a microprocessor, the walking animation became much smoother and prettier in Midway’s version. As a technology person, I thought, ‘I’ve got to use microprocessors from now on.’ And so, I used a microprocessor for my very next game, Space Invaders.”6 ••• For a time, in 1978, ‘video games’ meant only one thing the whole world over: Space Invaders had shaken up a slumping industry to become “the ﬁrst blockbuster video game.”7 By the end of its life cycle, there were more than 100,000 Space Invaders machines in Japan alone. Bowling alleys, pachinko parlors, and even small vegetable stores actually cleared away all of their inventory and devoted all of their store space to rows upon rows of sit-down, tabletop Space Invaders games. A severe shortage of the 100-yen coins required to play the game temporarily forced the Japanese government to quadruple its production. Within one year of its US release, an additional 60,000 machines had been sold. One arcade owner said of Space Invaders that it was the ﬁrst arcade game whose intake “represented a signiﬁcant portion of the cost of [buying] the game in any one week.” That is, it was the ﬁrst video game that paid for itself within about a month.8 As for game play, Space Invaders was like a more frantic version of Breakout. The player controlled a laser gun at the bottom of the screen and ﬁred at a gauntlet of enemy alien creatures. But rather than standing still, the aliens moved left to right and dropped one row each time the group reached the end of the screen. As their numbers became smaller, the invaders moved faster, becoming much harder to shoot.\n\nAt this stage in his career as a game designer, Nishikado appreciated the game play formula that Atari pioneered with Breakout: the goal of ‘clearing’ one screen and proceeding to the next, which would be a crucial, almost reﬂexive game-design element from then on. In 1982, Taito import manager S. Ikawa described what Nishikado added to the game play as “a feeling of tension. A little neglect might breed great mischief.”9 The invaders’ death march made the game singularly fast-paced and heart pounding, and Space Invaders was one of the ﬁrst games where elaborate strategies and secret shooting methods became crucial to victory. This exciting game play transcended any cultural boundaries, succeeding in Japan and the US, where the game industry was in a slump after Atari had released its ﬁrst home system with interchangeable cartridges, the Atari Video Computer System, later known as the 2600 VCS. In his 1984 book Zap!: The Rise And Fall of Atari, Scott Cohen argued that the success of the VCS, and perhaps the US video game industry in general, was all thanks to Space Invaders: It wasn’t until Space Invaders that video games began to utilize the full potential of the technology that went into creating them. Pong wasn’t as exciting as Ping-Pong, but Space Invaders was more exciting than bowling, which is very much what Space Invaders was like, except Space Invaders was about twenty times faster... Space Invaders was a new form of entertainment... It also created a new craze in home video games. Atari VCS sales went through the roof.10\n\nOn a larger scale, Space Invaders represented the next step in the evolution of the cinematic Japanese video game. Again, although it had no story sequences, the outer space alien battle drew upon popular space action movies, books, and comics, such as the ﬁlm Star Wars that Nishikado knew was popular in America at the time, but also anime ﬁlms that had begun to gain popularity in Japan at that time, like Uchuu Senkan Yamato (Space Battleship Yamato). What’s more, when he decided to set his game in space with alien creatures, Nishikado ﬁrst opened his sketchbook and ﬁlled a few pages with nearly professional-quality drawings of aliens that looked like squid and octopi. A member of the shikaku sedai ‘visual generation,’ it is evident from looking at Nishikado’s sketchbook that he grew up practicing manga art. Even in the actual game, the little aliens that appeared on screen had decidedly cartoon-like qualities: animated faces with eyes and mouths, and tentacles that dangled below. Here, again, was the Japanese ‘comical sense’ invading video game design, and causing dramatic impact. ••• And yet Space Invaders’ phenomenal worldwide success turned out to be nothing compared to Pac-Man’s. Pac-Man became the quintessential, iconic video game character. Even people who didn’t know anything else about video games knew Pac’s round, yellow face. The game itself was a huge moneymaker, selling over 100,000 machines in the US alone. Many publishers sold Pac-Man strategy guides, four of which appeared— simultaneously—on the New York Times bestseller list in 1981.11 The PacMan character appeared on the cover of Time. The song “Pac-Man Fever” reached number nine on the Billboard charts in 1982.12 Pac-Man was the creation of Toru Iwatani, who graduated from Tokai University in 1977 with a degree in electrical engineering and entered Namco that same year. “I didn’t want to make anything in particular. But after I entered the company, I thought, well, I like pinball, so I guess I could make pinball games... But when I told them, they said ‘We do not make pinball.’ I guess I really should have done my homework before I decided to work here.”13 But Namco, fresh from its fallout with Atari over the Breakout machines, did want to begin making its own original arcade games. Iwatani mixed his\n\nfavorite elements of pinball and Breakout to design the ﬁrst ‘video pinball’ game called Gee-Bee (1978). The game play was essentially like Breakout, but there were far more things to do onscreen. You could hit bumpers and roll over lit-up markers to score points, like pinball tables. Gee-Bee had a black-and-white monitor, but a piece of multicolored cellophane, like those used in later editions of Space Invaders, was put over the monitor such that the play-ﬁeld was separated into different colors. In 1979, Iwatani followed up with Bomb-Bee and Cutie-Q, two more video pinball games. Bomb-Bee featured similar simple graphics, this time with a full-color monitor. CutieQ’s improvements were not technological but stylistic. Improving on the ﬁrst two games’ simple, block-based graphics, Cutie-Q featured colorful targets in the shapes of smiling faces, animated monsters, and ghosts. One character that waddled around was called “Walk-Man.” Iwatani did this to appeal to a more general audience, one that he hoped would include women. “If you went to the game centers [the Japanese term for video arcades] at that time, you’d see nothing but guys. I thought what would make the games more attractive to women would be cute character design. So I designed cute characters for Cutie-Q.”14 Iwatani confessed to not being very skilled at drawing, but also that he ﬁlled up his school textbooks with scattered manga. In any case, in 1980 he began work on Pac-Man and inadvertently created one of the world’s most instantly recognizable icons. In fact, however, “rather than develop the character ﬁrst,” said Iwatani, “I started out with the concept of taberu.”15 He set the Japanese word taberu—“eat”—as his key word and began to create a game around that concept. This choice of key word was tuned toward making a game that girls would enjoy as well: “Women seem to like eating,” said Iwatani.16 (Fun foods in Japan, like elaborate ice-cream desserts, frosted doughnuts, and crepes, would seem to be most popular with young women.) “The games of the time were mostly games where you shot and killed aliens, and I wanted to go in the opposite direction.”17 Before creating the rules of his new game, Iwatani came up with the main character. As the story goes, Iwatani was eating pizza for lunch, took one slice out of the pie, and saw below him the ﬁgure of Pac-Man. This story is probably mythical, but it has more or less passed into legend by this point. * * I asked video game historian Steven Kent about this via email, and he told me that in his ﬁrst interview with Iwatani, he told the story as truth...but that in a later interview, his comments were\n\ntranslated as something like “I wish I could say that this is how it happened.” And in Shida and Matsui, volume 1, page 43, he is quoted as saying: “It’s already passed into legend, so I’m going to stick with this: I took one slice out of a pizza and saw Pac-Man” (my translation).\n\nPac-Man’s game play was not, like most other games, a simulation of something that had come before, whether a table tennis match or a spaceship ﬂight, a cowboy shootout or a pinball table. Pac-Man, in which players moved Iwatani’s yellow, chomping face through a maze ﬁlled with energy pills and deadly (yet comical) ghosts, was an experience that was only possible in the world of video games—a completely original concept.\n\nPac-Man featured no real narrative, for neither the main character nor the ghosts had any sort of motivation or goals. But Pac-Man was the ﬁrst game to make copious use of cinematic scenes. The game’s introductory ‘attract mode’ featured a display like a theater marquee that introduced the four ghosts by name and gave some clues as to their personality, which showed through in the way they chased Pac-Man in the maze. And, upon clearing certain screens, the player was treated to some brief, humorous interludes “acted out” by Pac-Man and the characters. These served not only as a way of attracting new players over to the game machine, but also as a reward for skilled players. Pac-Man was brought to the US by Midway, where it was just as popular, perhaps more so, than in Japan. But like most every other character-\n\nbased game that was to follow, some textual changes were in order for the US market. One was to rework names of the ghosts, from Oikake, Machibuse, Kimagure, and Otoboke to Shadow, Speedy, Bashful, and Pokey, and their nicknames from Akabei, Pinky, Aosuke, and Guzuta to Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. * The name of the main character, or the Romanized version of that name anyway, also had to be changed. Paku-paku taberu is a Japanese expression meaning “to munch.” So, similarly to “Walk-Man” from Cutie-Q, the character was called pakku-man after this onomatopoeic phrase. † The original Romanization of pakku-man, which was actually used on some arcade machines and merchandise in Japan, was Puck-Man. When Midway brought it to America, they asked to change the name to Pac-Man out of the (entirely rational) fear that vandals would erase a small part of the P so that it appeared to be an F. * As near as I can ﬁgure, the names of the ghosts mean Pursue, Ambush, Capricious, and Slow, and three of their nicknames play off of their colors; aka means red and ao is blue. Guzuta probably comes from guzutsuku—to linger or languish. † Not, as far as I can discern, a reference to the hockey puck-like shape of the main character.\n\nLike they did with Space Invaders, Atari licensed Pac-Man for their VCS home video game system. But since the home system’s computer processor was so weak compared to the arcade machine, and also because American Atari employee Tod Frye had hastily reprogrammed the game itself in a matter of weeks, VCS Pac-Man was a pale imitation of the real thing. The cut scenes were gone, the paku-paku sound effect was no more, and Iwatani’s colorful, appealing graphic design was butchered. It was the beginning of the end for Pac-Mania, and the beginning of the crash that would cripple the American video game industry, making it ripe for takeover at the hands of Japanese companies. But even in the earliest days, in an industry dominated by American companies, the huge, smash-success games in both countries were coming from Japan. Wherever you went, Pac-Man was a smash hit and a merchandising gold mine (Pac-Man lunchboxes, board games, ﬁgurines, etc.), and other video games followed in the wake of its popularity. Pac-Man also became a hit Saturday morning cartoon show in America. In fact, the three video games that had thus far been turned into American Saturday\n\nmorning cartoons were all Japanese in origin: Pac-Man, Sega’s Frogger, and a game called Donkey Kong, which was designed by a young artist named Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\n3 • • • • The Play Control of Power Fantasies: Nintendo, Super Mario, and Shigeru Miyamoto • • • • Genius is a word that should be kept behind glass, reserved for the truly exceptional. But no one who’s ever been entranced by one of Shigeru Miyamoto’s games can question his brilliance. Constantly imitated, but never equaled, he is without question the most inspirational video game designer in the world. —“Why Are Shigeru Miyamoto’s Games So Damn Good?” Next Generation, February 1995\n\nThe development of the Japanese video game made a quantum leap the day that Shigeru Miyamoto began to design his ﬁrst one. Born in 1952 in the town of Sonobe, on the outskirts of Kyoto, where his family had lived for three generations, young Shigeru’s wild imagination was stimulated by comics and animation. The Miyamoto family had no car or television, but every few months they would take a train into the city to shop and see movies. Miyamoto especially remembers Peter Pan and Snow White. At home, he “lived in books, and he drew and painted and made elaborate puppets, which he presented in fanciful shows.”1 “When I was a little boy, I liked to play pretend,” said Miyamoto in a 1995 interview. “It was a lot like a computer simulation. When we played with friends, some games ended with a winner and a loser, and a friend played as a judge. When you have a friend play the judge, he can just change the rules as he likes. When I play through the computer, the computer judges very correctly... I found that difference interesting.”2\n\nIn 1964, when Miyamoto was 11, his father Hideo brought home a television. Shigeru became “obsessed with animation” and “hooked on Japanese superheroes.”3 His favorites were some of the ﬁrst animated shows on the NHK broadcasting network: Chirorin-mura to kurumi no ki (“Chirorin Village and the Walnut Tree”) and Hyokkori Hyoutan-jima (“Accidental Gourd Island”). In middle school, his “eyes opened to manga” and he began to devour the popular artists of the day. “I liked gag manga, story manga—as long as it was manga, I liked it.”4\n\nShigeru Miyamoto\n\nMiyamoto loved to explore the countryside, “investigating hillsides and creek beds and small canyons,” climbing through caves, wandering without a map and marveling at his discoveries.5 He would take paper and pencils with him and draw the places he found. He “took cartoon-making seriously,” inventing lives and personalities for his original characters and then making them into ﬂipbooks. In high school he started a manga club.6 Miyamoto entered Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts and Crafts in 1970. He graduated ﬁve years later (he skipped class often)7 with a degree in industrial design.8 He didn’t feel like he could cut it as a professional manga artist, which is why he decided to go to college. But by majoring in industrial design, he was able to continue drawing.9 At school, he played the earliest video games and developed eclectic musical interests: The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Doc Watson,10 The Beatles. He taught himself to\n\nplay bluegrass on the guitar and banjo, and most of all he loved designing toys.11\n\nAn Interesting Company Miyamoto envisioned himself perhaps designing telephones or other consumer goods. He wanted to work somewhere where he could “make a hit product.”12 But he knew he wasn’t cut out for the rigid corporate world of Japan, and had no idea where to go. His father called an old family friend: Hiroshi Yamauchi, the president of Kyoto-based Nintendo Co., Ltd. As Miyamoto recalled, “At that time, Nintendo made not only amusement machines but also kiddie-cars and batting machines. I thought, what an interesting company. They’ll let me do what I want to.”13 Nintendo had been an “interesting company” long before Shigeru Miyamoto’s father was born. Founded in 1889, the 22nd year of the Meiji era, by Kyoto businessman Fusajiro Yamauchi as Nintendo Koppai, the company was originally a small operation devoted to the manufacture of hanafuda, Japanese playing cards. Hanafuda, which Nintendo still manufactures today, * are small cards about the size of a cracker (or a Game Boy Advance cartridge) with beautiful seasonal imagery—nightingales, cherry blossoms. The forty-eight cards in the deck are printed on thick, highquality cardboard, so the deck is more than twice as tall as a standard deck of toranpu (Western playing cards) and about three times as expensive.\n\nThe oldest surviving Nintendo building, on Rokujou in Kyoto, and detail of signs.\n\nThe original Nintendo building, all of two stories high, stands near the intersection of Rokujou (6th St.) and Kiyamachi, near the Kamogawa River in Kyoto. The area is only a few minutes south of the hustle and bustle of downtown Kyoto, but it is drowsy today with a few small stores still open for business, a few nondescript bars and restaurants, and a virtually empty, nearly abandoned concrete building with wrought iron signs on the front that read, right-to-left in the prewar style, Yamauchi Nintendo Playing Cards. Kiyamachi was and is a seedy part of town. In 1899 it was ﬁlled with\n\ngambling dens and brothels; today you ﬁnd pachinko halls and “massage parlors.” * Although they represent an ever-shrinking side business, Nintendo’s playing cards are still the high-quality gold standard in Japan. The hanafuda package is now made of strong plastic and features both kanji characters and the now-familiar English logo, but the designs of the cards and package are virtually identical. Nintendo is still so well-known as a card maker that the recent Xbox vs. PlayStation vs. GameCube console war is called “Bill vs. Aibo vs. Hanafuda-ya.”\n\nAnother invention of Yokoi’s was marketed in 1973 as Ele-Conga. Capitalizing on the popularity of Latin music in Japan at that time, the Ele-Conga was really a high-quality drum synthesizer that let the user play electronic drum beats by pushing buttons. An optional attachment (shown right) used paper “records” with holes punched in them to play drum beats automatically.\n\nNintendo ﬁt perfectly with this atmosphere, as hanafuda were used for very serious gambling. Yamauchi’s cards, hand-pressed from the bark of mulberry trees, were unmatched. The high-rolling gamblers demanded the quality Nintendo cards, and Nintendo’s Daitoryou (President) brand quickly became the most popular cards in Kyoto and neighboring Osaka. Proﬁts surged when the yakuza, Japan’s equivalent of the Maﬁa, operated highstakes games of hanafuda in casino-like parlors. Nintendo proﬁted handsomely, because professional players would begin each game with a fresh deck, discarding the old one.14 In 1907, Yamauchi began the manufacture of toranpu, making Nintendo the ﬁrst Japanese company to do so. The company grew and grew, but remained strictly in the playing-card business until 1949, when Hiroshi Yamauchi, Fusajiro’s great-grandson, became the third president of Nintendo at all of twenty-one years old. Yamauchi ﬁred every manager left over from\n\nhis father’s and grandfather’s days. He had his cousin ﬁred. He wanted it clear that he was the one in charge. He moved the plant and he modernized techniques. In 1953 Nintendo became the ﬁrst company in Japan to manufacture modern plastic-coated playing cards. In 1959 he licensed Disney characters and put them on the backs of his cards. Sales skyrocketed.15 Yamauchi took Nintendo public, listing his family’s company on the Osaka Stock Exchange. He branched off new products and services: instant rice, a taxi company, love hotels that rented rooms by the hour. But by 1969 Yamauchi was unhappy with the performance of these ventures, and decided to play to Nintendo’s strength, namely its reputation in the toys and games business. Two Kyoto natives were the heart and soul of his new Games department: Hiroshi Imanishi, who was the company’s general affairs manager, and Gunpei Yokoi, an electronics graduate who was working as the maintenance man on the hanafuda printers. Yokoi’s inventions deﬁned the new Games division and became the popular Ultra series of toys. The series included a plastic latticework hand that extended and grasped, a pitching machine that lobbed soft baseballs for safe indoor use, and a toy periscope. Nintendo’s ﬁrst major hit, however, was the Beam Gun series, created through a partnership with Sharp,* who was working with solar cell technology. Yokoi worked with a Sharp employee named Masayuki Uemura to develop a toy gun that “shot” a thin beam of light. If the player hit the tiny solar-cell target, it would trigger an electrical circuit and, for example, a plastic “beer bottle” held together by magnets would break into pieces. The two men worked well together, and Yokoi hired Uemura away from his sales position at Sharp. The Beam Gun series sold millions of units, which convinced Yamauchi and Yokoi to build the concept into a grander-scale operation. The bowling fad that took over Japan in the 1960s had died out, and Nintendo swooped in to convert old closed-down bowling alleys into Laser Clay Ranges. Players stood at one end of the alley holding large riﬂes with Beam Gun technology inside, ﬁring at “clay pigeons” projected onto screens at the far end, where the bowling pins used to sit. The ranges were a big hit, but soon the economy slipped and the fad ended shortly afterward.† Regardless, Nintendo was an established name in high-tech entertainment, with a brilliant staff that knew how to design and market hit products. Running with this image, Yamauchi moved to get in early on a\n\ngrowing trend: video games that were played on home television sets. In 1977, he licensed Magnavox’s Odyssey video game hardware for sale in Japan. The systems that Nintendo released were not based on the original 1972 Odyssey system; they were based on the more reﬁned hardware that Magnavox had developed in the wake of Pong’s popularity. Atari’s Home Pong was the runaway hit Christmas present of 1975, and by 1976 seventyﬁve companies, including Magnavox, had announced imitation versions.16 A Japanese company called Epoch had already broken into the market with TV Tennis, a black-and-white tennis machine that was so primitive it could not even keep score on screen; players had to click plastic dials on the machine’s front. At Yamauchi’s insistence, Nintendo forged ahead technologically and licensed Magnavox’s newer color Odyssey systems, releasing the Color TV Game 6 in 1977. * This partnership continues to this day. Sharp designed and sold the Twin Famicom in the 1980s, a system that combined Nintendo’s Famicom with the optional Disk System add-on; sold television sets with Famicom and Super Famicom systems built inside; and most recently in 2003 supplied the new LCD screens for Nintendo’s handheld Game Boy Advance SP systems. † Irony rating: ﬁve stars. The ﬁrst bowling center for the Japanese public (the only other bowling alleys in Japan were for American military use) was an early project of a company called Service Games-or Sega for short.\n\nIn sharp stylistic contrast to the futuristic, black- or metal-colored machines that other Japanese companies released, the CTVG6 was bright orange and had rounded edges. It had a toy-like design sensibility about it. Inside the box, as the name implied, it featured full-color graphics and six\n\nvariations on the tennis game. At 9,800 yen, it was a pricey plaything, but the risk paid off. It was a smash hit, and a higher-end sequel released that year, the Color TV Game 15, which featured a few improvements: ﬁfteen games, of course, and removable controllers. CTVG6, like every other Japanese TV-tennis game at the time, had plastic dials that were permanently attached to the machine’s face. These were used to move the paddles onscreen. But the CTVG15’s controllers were attached to the back of the system by long wires, so players could sit comfortably away from each other and from the TV. When the system was not in use, the controllers sat in indentations on the face of the machine. Sleek and stylish, the CTVG15 was just as popular as its little brother. Nintendo sold over one million units between the two systems, and was beginning to carve out a nice place in the budding video game industry. And then, Shigeru Miyamoto walked into Hiroshi Yamauchi’s ofﬁce for a job interview.\n\nThe Early Period He was 24 years old with a goofy, freckled face and shaggy hair. He brought a recent invention of his to show Yamauchi. It was a clothes hanger designed for children, with soft edges and colorful animal designs—an elephant, a bird, a chicken. Miyamoto was hired as Nintendo’s ﬁrst staff artist17 and assigned to the planning department. “I was hired as an apprentice planner,” he recalled in a later interview, “but basically, I could do design, so I ended up doing a lot of design work.”18\n\nNintendo’s new headquarters, a shimmering white cubic structure, dominates the southern Kyoto skyline.\n\nIt is July 14, 2003, and we are sitting in an austere conference room on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of Nintendo’s new headquarters south of Kyoto Station. This new compound is pure white and shaped almost like a cube. It is clearly visible from the roof of Kyoto Station, especially if you can read kanji characters that spell out nin-ten-dou; the company name means, approximately, “the place where luck is left in heaven’s hands,” appropriate for a company that got its start making cards used in gambling halls. The meeting room’s walls are as white as the building’s exterior. Eight leather chairs sit low to the ﬂoor, around a long table. A gigantic widescreen TV and DVD player occupy one corner of the otherwise sparsely decorated room. Two young women, dressed identically in GameCube-blue, place iced green tea in front of us. I ask Shigeru Miyamoto what his very ﬁrst job at Nintendo was, and he thinks silently for a long while before answering. It was a long time ago, after all. Finally, he speaks: “The ﬁrst thing they had me do, the ﬁrst project I worked on, was to do the outer housing designs for two dedicated home game machines we were\n\nmaking, called Racing 112 and Burokku-kuzushi. The designers of the actual game hardware would tell me about the insides of the machine, and then from that I would design the outside.”19 This was actually quite close to what Miyamoto had originally envisioned, except that instead of designing comfortable telephones, it was video game consoles and controllers. Immediately, Miyamoto knew that he wanted to improve on the designs of the CTVG6 and 15. “They were bad,” he said, uncomfortable and difﬁcult to understand. “I tried to make my designs more fun for the player to interface with. For example, with Blockbuster, I designed the console so you could play it either right-handed or left-handed. For Racing 112, I thought it was important that there be a gear shift handle, because it’s fun to shift gears with a controller like that.”\n\nComparing Miyamoto’s designs to the earlier games, more differences emerge. Blockbuster’s casing was even more rounded and toy-like than those of the previous consoles,* and Racing 112 featured a large, comfortable steering wheel controller for the one-player mode and two removable paddle controllers for the two-player version. In fact, Racing 112 contained 112 possible variations on the game; switches on the front of the machine let the player control the speed and number of cars, the weave of the road, guardrails, slipperiness, and so on. These switches were typical of this type of console, but Miyamoto added picture labels for each switch in place of the text-only labels on the ﬁrst two games. This was his design training coming into play; icon-based labels help\n\nusers instantly comprehend the device’s functions without having to read the instruction book or interpret cryptically short text labels. This sort of design sense became so important to Miyamoto’s creations at Nintendo that he eventually considered it his main job. “It’s ningen kougaku,” he says—“human engineering,” the art and science of creating a smooth, natural interface between the machine and the user. From the ﬁrst, Miyamoto’s designs reﬂected this philosophy. Although the actual computer programs in Nintendo’s machines were nearly identical to the many other video game consoles, the controller design set Nintendo’s machines apart. When Miyamoto was ﬁnally allowed to design the game programs themselves, things really took off for Nintendo. * It was also the ﬁrst Nintendo game console to feature the Nintendo logo displayed prominently across the front of the machine. Nintendo had obviously built up a positive brand identity in the video game business by this time.\n\nBut by 1978, he was still an assistant in the planning department, and so his next few jobs were relatively mundane. Having made a name in the home video game business, Nintendo turned to the emerging arcade-game market. This was more or less motivated by the huge success of Space Invaders. With demand for Space Invaders climbing higher and higher, and more potential spaces for machines than machines to ﬁll them, numerous companies, Nintendo included, turned out Invaders clones by the roomful. Nintendo’s entry was called Space Fever, and Miyamoto drew the in-game characters. Nintendo apparently liked his work; he went on to draw the characters for Sheriff (1979) and Space Firebird (1980), and he designed the cabinet and marquee artwork for Sheriff and another game called Radarscope.20 Nintendo was going through a few major changes during these years. Yamauchi, looking for a more innovative product, asked Gunpei Yokoi to develop a unique way of playing video games.* Yokoi came up with the Game and Watch series, tiny hand-held games slightly larger than a credit card with screens that used liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). Other portable games had been released by companies like Epoch, but these mostly used light-emitting diode (LED) technology. LEDs were tiny red lights that could be turned on or off, so the “graphics” of these early games were, well, tiny red lights. LCD technology allowed screens to display relatively detailed\n\ncartoon pictures, although these graphics could only blink on or off to create the illusion of movement. Nintendo’s designers were so adept, however, that the onscreen action looked quite good. The Game and Watch series became incredibly popular.† * Yamauchi essentially stopped development of the home game consoles, but Nintendo released one more the same year as the Game and Watch. It was based on an arcade game that played a monochrome version of the game go, with the white and black chips replaced by crosses and squares. The graphics of the arcade and home versions were extremely simplistic for 1980 (by this time, color games were the norm) but the rules of go are so complicated that the computer processors inside the machine had to be very powerful. The home version, called simply “Computer TV Game,” cost a whopping ¥50,000 in 1980 and is an extremely rare collector’s item today. † The Game and Watch games were very simplistic contests, but a mascot character began to emerge in even the earliest ones: a stick ﬁgure with a Charlie-Brown-style round head and big nose called Mr. Game and Watch. The character is so recognized in Japan even today that a 2001 Nintendo GameCube title, Dai-Rantou Smash Brothers DX (Super Smash Bros. Melee in the US) featured Mr. Game and Watch as a hidden character. His ﬁghting techniques were made up of the different actions from the early Game and Watch games, like Fireman and Chef.\n\nAnother major change for Nintendo at this time was the establishment of an American branch. Yamauchi tapped his son-in-law, Minoru Arakawa, to head up the division in New York, with the sole initial intent of distributing Nintendo arcade games in the US. The ﬁrst few games met with failure. The black-and-white Sheriff and Space Fever—imitation versions of Western Gun and Space Invaders, respectively—were old news by 1980. Radarscope also was very similar to all the other spaceship-shooting games in the American and Japanese arcades of 1980. But despite Radarscope’s unoriginal gameplay (“like Galaxian from Namco but more sophisticated,” recalled Arakawa21), it became one of the most popular games in Tokyo.22 It was, at the time, the second most popular game in Japan after Pac-Man. Pac-Man was creating a sensation in America as well, and Arakawa believed that Radarscope would be Nintendo of America’s big hit. He asked Japan for 3,000 units, which took up NOA’s entire budget and took nearly four months to arrive by boat. By that time, Radarscope’s popularity in Tokyo had waned and the prototype units that had been set up in the United States were sitting idle, unplayed. Even more to their disadvantage, Radarscope was one of the most expensive arcade games on the market, and it came from a foreign country with a tiny American subsidiary. NOA was\n\nable to sell 1,000 games, but had 2,000 left over.23 Arakawa needed a new game that he could insert into the Radarscope cabinets and sell, so he asked Yamauchi to have his staff create one. The only available designer was Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\nDonkey Kong Video game design prior to Miyamoto’s ﬁrst effort had been a largely hit-and-miss process. Games were often designed and programmed by a single person. This meant that a successful game designer had to have a creative left brain from which he could pull new and interesting design concepts, and have a mathematically adept right brain that would allow him to translate his designs into a ones-and-zeroes computer program. Of course, at this time, the ability to program was far more important than the ability to design. A good program that ran an average design was sellable. An amazing design with a lousy program to back it up was useless. Giving the keynote speech at the 1999 Game Developers Conference in San Jose, Miyamoto displayed pictures of Space Invaders and said, “Until Donkey Kong, which I directed, programmers and engineers were responsible for game design. These were the days when the engineers were even drawing the pictures and composing the music themselves. They were terrible, weren’t they?”24 This was especially true because the video screens of the time couldn’t display sharp images. In fact, color screens had only come into wide use a year or two prior. The hottest game of 1978, Space Invaders, was black and white. And so even in 1980, as graphics got better, most games were still being developed around very simple, basic ideas: shoot asteroids, shoot bugs, shoot missiles. Games with standout design quality were the exceptions that proved Miyamoto’s point. Miyamoto was adept at design. But he had never designed a game before and did not know how to program a computer. He would never have been given a job designing games at Atari. So how did Yamauchi sense that Miyamoto would come up with such a revolutionary game? Looking back on his childhood and college experiences, it seems that Miyamoto was always developing the two interests that would make him such an inﬂuential game designer. His love for exploration and fascination with new, unexplored territory extended into his college years: “When I went to the university at Kanazawa, it was a totally strange city for me. I liked\n\nwalking very much, and whenever I did, something would happen. I would pass through a tunnel and the scene was quite changed when I came out.”25 This sort of exploration and discovery would become a deﬁning aspect of Miyamoto’s games once the hardware became powerful enough to bring the worlds in his imagination to life. But his gift for character designs and his love for epic stories are the factors that made his ﬁrst game a success. The story of Donkey Kong was a combination of Beauty and the Beast and King Kong, two of his favorites. He made it a point to note that his ape, Donkey Kong,* wasn’t evil but simply misunderstood—“nothing too evil or repulsive.” The gorilla’s keeper was “a funny, hang-loose kind of guy” but, as Miyamoto made clear, he wasn’t very kind to the gorilla. “It was humiliating! How miserable it was to belong to such a mean, small man!”26 So Donkey Kong, mistreated and confused, escaped and took his keeper’s girlfriend along. * Miyamoto wanted to title the game (and the ape) something that meant “stubborn monkey.” The old English-Japanese dictionary yielded “donkey,” as in a stubborn mule. “Kong” had been a generic Japanese word for “large, menacing ape” ever since the 1933 movie King Kong.\n\nDonkey Kong’s master was drawn from a combination of Miyamoto’s ingenuity and the technical constraints of the time. “I didn’t know how to make a really cool character,” said Miyamoto in 1993, “so I made Mario.”27 Mario, or Jump-Man, as Miyamoto originally called him, was “neither handsome nor heroic... someone anyone could relate to.” Miyamoto described Mario as “a short, indomitable, mustached man in a red cap... a kind of Everyman who rises to heroism in the face of adversity” and whose “insigniﬁcance... makes him so appealing.”28 The idea of the unassuming guy who succeeds against the odds is a common theme in Japanese storytelling. To name a popular example from Miyamoto’s day, take the main character Nobita from the ubiquitous manga and anime series Doraemon. Nobita is a middle school boy who is not any good at anything; he’s not very smart or athletic or popular, but he wins in the face of adversity (with help from his alien robot cat). Mario doesn’t have an alien robot cat, but the comparison is otherwise valid. Other popular Japanese entertainment features a similar “neither handsome nor heroic” main character, but who is always “someone anyone could relate to.” To illustrate this, Ian Buruma uses examples from manga,\n\nlike the often-abused father ﬁgure from a popular strip Dame Oyaji (“Stupid Dad”), and from ﬁlm, like the “most beloved character in the history of Japanese cinema,” the lonely vagabond Tora-san, who is deﬁned by his tragic failings and misadventures.29 This is not to say that Mario is a sad sack, an unlucky vagabond, or a fool. He is actually presented as hard working and heroic, but the Japanese preference for these sorts of characters is also clearly present in Mario’s design. Mario is accessible—he is our father, or uncle or mailman, or little brother, or us—he is an average Joe. He’s no superhero and yet we enjoy identifying with him. To suggest this slightly dumpy, antihero image, Miyamoto drew a large nose and big, round eyes. Mario got a mustache because video game animation of the time couldn’t render a deﬁned mouth. He wore gloves and overalls to distinguish the movement of his arms when he walked. And his red cap was there so his hair wouldn’t have to ﬂy around when he jumped. In other words, Mario was created to look as much like a vibrant, animated cartoon character as video game screens of the time would allow, and the effect was singularly impressive. Had anything been different about Mario—his arms frozen, his hair stiff, his face incomplete—he would have looked unnatural. Instead, he looked and moved more realistically, more like a human being than any video game character before him. Donkey Kong was the ﬁrst game project in which the design process began with a story. There were other games that had basic storylines, such as the jailbreak artwork from Breakout, but the stories were contrived to conform to the game after it was completed. With Donkey Kong, the original characters, their looks, and their motivations were created ﬁrst, and the game play was crafted with them in mind. In 1980, as in the early days of ﬁlm, new video game genres were being invented constantly. “Block” games like Pong and Breakout gave way to “Space” games like Asteroids and Space Invaders. Pac-Man was the ﬁrst “Maze Chase” game, spawning imitations from both countries. Donkey Kong was something entirely new, a genre that would consume the video game industry throughout the late eighties and early nineties: what Miyamoto called “running/jumping/climbing.” Later on, this would be dubbed the “Platform” game, named after the platforms that the main character jumped and climbed.\n\nOriginally, Miyamoto recalled in a 2000 interview, the game he started to make wasn’t a “running/jumping/climbing” game at all. “At ﬁrst it was more of an athletic game—the character would ride up and down on a seesaw—it would be a game that used contrivances like that.”30 This was the invention of Game and Watch creator Gunpei Yokoi, but it didn’t work with the technology of the time. “He wanted a game where you bounce on the seesaw and bounce up off of it. But,” he laughs, “we couldn’t ﬁgure out how to do it; it was really difﬁcult. With a seesaw, if you get on one end, the other end goes up. If you hit one end real hard, the other end goes up just as hard. It was interesting to think about this, but we couldn’t do it.” Another concept that didn’t work out was Popeye. Originally, Miyamoto wasn’t going to design characters at all for his ﬁrst game. Instead, Nintendo was working on obtaining the Popeye license from King Features Syndicate. Miyamoto envisioned a game where Bluto took Olive Oyl away from Popeye, who made his way over obstacles, acquired his spinach—and BAM! —knocked Bluto out to end the round. But Nintendo was unable to get the license after all, and Miyamoto set to work on his original characters. Since Gunpei Yokoi’s seesaw idea wasn’t working out, Miyamoto changed the design, instead creating a design prototype with barrels rolling down slopes, and the main character having to climb up and down ladders to avoid them. But looking at this design, Miyamoto felt it would be more fun to have a character that could jump on his own, and so “Jump-Man” (Mario’s original name, drawing on Iwatani’s “Walk-Man” and “Pac-Man”) was born. The story ﬂeshed out from there, and his characters were born. Miyamoto admits that he was still thinking about Popeye when he created his own characters, especially in the sense that Mario and Donkey Kong were not truly enemies. “Even after the Popeye license fell through, I was still thinking about the relationship between Popeye, Bluto, and Olive Oyl. Their relationship is somewhat friendly. They’re not enemies, they’re friendly rivals. “But I needed different characters. The main character, the big, strong guy, and the beautiful woman... well, uh, Olive really isn’t a beautiful woman. I ﬁgured I’d make mine beautiful instead [laughs]. “What’s kind of a mystery is, why did I title the game Donkey Kong? The main character, the player, was Mario. That much was decided. But Donkey Kong, his personality was the most ﬂeshed-out of all of them. I think it’s best to name the game after the strongest character.”\n\nDonkey Kong actually featured more gameplay than other games of the time. This also stemmed from Miyamoto’s love of Japanese manga: “Thinking back, I would say that although it wasn’t done consciously, I ended up designing Donkey Kong like a traditional Japanese four-panel manga comic strip. That way of telling a story in four distinct parts seemed natural to me, so I created four separate screens from the opening to the conclusion. The programmers were able to do this, but they told me at the time that I was essentially asking them to make four separate games!” In the game’s ﬁrst stage (or perhaps “panel”), Mario starts at the bottom of an unﬁnished building site. Steel girders and ladders crisscross the screen, and Mario has to climb to the top, where Donkey Kong holds Mario’s girlfriend Pauline imprisoned. Mario must jump rolling barrels, ﬁre, and other obstacles that Donkey Kong throws at him. He can grab a hammer for temporary invincibility against the barrels (much like Popeye’s spinach). In the ﬁnal stage, Mario must remove all the rivets from a similar-looking structure, causing it to collapse, thus sending the monkey plummeting to his doom and reuniting Mario with his girlfriend. The bright, animated cartoon characters and fresh game play alone would have been enough to make Donkey Kong stand out. But Miyamoto did something more with Donkey Kong. To understand what that was, ﬁrst note that Miyamoto still calls the original Pac-Man his favorite game. In one interview, he said that Pac-Man was “the ﬁrst game where I recognized an actual effort in design. You didn’t have designers at the time, so most games didn’t really have any design sense. When someone with a background in design like me saw that, I felt like this was my true calling in life.”31 “Back then, I would boast to myself that I was one of the ﬁve best game designers in the world. This is because there were very few artists involved in game design at that time.”32 Pac-Man was innovative in its design and its use of cinematic cutscenes, but there was no story being told. Pac-Man’s non-interactive, movielike sequences simply showed humorous interludes featuring the game characters, but Donkey Kong was the very ﬁrst game to tell a whole story, from beginning to end. ••• Rather than take this for granted, perhaps we should ask, what is a narrative? And how, exactly, does Donkey Kong show it?\n\nFig. 1-1\n\nFig. 1-2\n\nFig. 1-3\n\nFilm scholars David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson called narrative “a chain of events in cause-effect relationship occurring in time and space.”33 In her book Art In Motion: Animation Aesthetics, Maureen Furniss quotes Bordwell as explaining that in the classical model of cinema, this cause-andeffect relationship had to “lead toward a uniﬁed conclusion, or closure of the plot.” Furniss then quotes Dwight V. Swain, who elaborates: “The beginning establishes your character within the framework of his predicament... The middle reveals the various steps of the character’s struggle to defeat the danger that threatens him... The end sees the character win or lose the battle. Remember, in this regard, the story doesn’t truly end until the struggle between desire and danger is resolved, with some kind of clear-cut triumph.” Swain argued that every ﬁlm story must have these three elements. These same principles, argues Furniss, can be applied to commercial animation.34 You can see each of these elements beginning to emerge in the early “cartoon” video games, starting with Donkey Kong. Most arcade games of the early 1980s not only lacked a story, they also had no cinematic scenes. When you dropped a quarter (or 100 yen) into Space Invaders, you weren’t treated to a scene of the ship ﬂying into battle or of the aliens departing their home planet. When you pressed the Start button, you were immediately thrust into the action with no buildup.\n\nFig. 1-4\n\nFig. 1-5\n\nFig. 1-6\n\nBut Donkey Kong was different: upon pressing the Start button, we ﬁrst see Donkey Kong ascend the building site on a pair of ladders, with Pauline slung over his shoulder (Fig. 1-1). Reaching the top, he places Pauline on the top girder and stomps up and down, causing the girders below him to bend and warp (Fig. 1-2). Reaching his ﬁnal position in the top left of the playﬁeld, he leers at the player (Fig. 1-3). This scene of only a few seconds accomplishes several things all at once. First and foremost, it establishes the game’s real-world setting: rather than the abstract star ﬁeld of Space Invaders or the surreal maze of Pac-Man, this is an unﬁnished skyscraper. Much like the design of Mario himself, this setting is carefully chosen to show realism within the conﬁnes of technology. A ﬁnished ofﬁce building would have required too much detail. But it was actually possible to display a series of girders, straight out of real life, on the game screen.\n\nFig. 1-7\n\nFig. 1-8\n\nAnother important aspect of this scene is that it gives the player time to reﬂect on the setting, on the graphics, and on the characters’ mannerisms: Donkey Kong’s maniacal grin suggests that he will be a tricky enemy. The player doesn’t have time to look at the designs and think about the character traits while actually playing the game; the action is too involving. After the introductory scene, an interstitial screen alerts the player that the game is about to start, and it also communicates the game’s objective: get as high on the screen as possible (Fig. 1-4). The game begins, and although\n\nthe large double ladders of the introduction are now split up into fragments, the game takes place in the same virtual space as the opening “movies” did. Mario (bottom left) must ﬁght his way up the girders, jumping over the barrels that Donkey Kong rolls down the structure (Fig. 1-5). While he does this, Pauline runs around the top girder, yelling “Help!” (Fig. 1-6). To look away from Mario means death, complete with a halo (Fig. 1-7), so the player probably cannot concentrate on these background elements. But anyone watching another person play the game has the luxury of observing the various animations of the three distinct “actors” in the “scene”: Donkey Kong’s grin when Mario dies, Mario’s determined face, Pauline’s exclamations.
