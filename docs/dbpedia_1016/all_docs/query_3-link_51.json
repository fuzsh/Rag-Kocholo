        "text": "Date: July 26\n\nSnoop and his “Drop It Like It’s Hot” collaborator Pharrell served as torchbearers, parading through a stretch of Seine-Saint-Denis. Snoop hit the Crip Walk, mingled with fans and seemed to have a blast in his role.\n\n“I felt like Muhammad Ali. I found out that when you hold the torch, you’re a peace messenger,” he told NBC. “I was waving, shaking hands, kissing the babies — doing what I do, you understand me? Putting my foot in the pavement, letting the people know that we’re here. We’re here for peace, love, unity and great sportsmanship.”\n\nDate: July 28\n\nAmerican gymnasts Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles saw someone dancing in the stands at a qualification round on July 28 and quickly realized it was Snoop Dogg, who hit a few moves and showed off his Biles T-shirt, before the two athletes joined in the moves from the floor. “Does anybody have more fun than Snoop?” one of the announcers asked.\n\nDate: July 26\n\nSnoop Dogg might not remember this, but Simone Biles’ mother definitely does. Nellie Biles took the chance during an interview with Snoop and Today show host Hoda Kotb at the Opening Ceremony to remind him of the time in 2010 when he blew her and Simone off for a photo opportunity in Times Square, which the rapper laughed off.\n\nDate: July 29\n\nSnoop Dogg put his lung power and aquatics to the test when he jumped in the pool with Michael Phelps and got some swimming tips from the 23-time Olympic gold medalist.\n\n“You said wingspan, lung power — I definitely have lung power,” Snoop said. “Our bodies are similar, Mike, we could be twins!”\n\nDate: July 29\n\nPin trading is an Olympic athlete tradition, and Snoop brought a few custom pins featuring him blowing smoke into the shape of the signature Olympic rings. One of the lucky people to get their hands on the rare Snoop pin was young tennis sensation Coco Gauff.\n\n“Hey, Mr. Snoop, thank you for this pin,” she said in an Instagram video thanking Snoop Dogg. “This is the best pin that I’ve ever gotten. I hope to see you at the U.S. Open or maybe, I hear, you’ll come [watch us] play on Wednesday? Thank you for the pin and I’ll see you at the next one.”\n\nDate: July 29\n\nSnoop and Team USA gymnast Suni Lee participated in a spiritual cleansing round of affirmations. “I have trained my entire life for the Olympics. I look great wearing gold,” Snoop said.\n\nHe then botched a French phrase, which made the gold medalist laugh: “Mon saut de main arrière est plus haut que la Tour Eiffel,” attempted the rapper, which translates to “My somersault is higher than the Eiffel Tower.”\n\nDate: Aug. 1\n\nWith his lanky frame, Snoop Dogg could’ve made some noise as a volleyball player in his athletic prime if he didn’t follow through with the music route. The rapper met up with the ladies on the beach volleyball team and referred to himself as their “coach” during an interview with NBC.\n\n“I gotta represent USA all day. I had a chance to meet these ladies and fell in love with them,” he said. “The whole strategic approach of how they teach teamwork and how they keep family and sisterhood [central], that’s just so important to me. I love supporting that.”\n\nDate: Aug. 2\n\nSnoop spent some time checking out the Louvre and got a private tour of the famed museum, where he saw the “Mona Lisa” for the first time. “We’re finna be snooping around,” he said. “I just found out I was Mona Lisa’s twin brother, Tony Lisa.”\n\nDate: Aug. 3\n\nSnoop learned some Spanish when heading to the pitch and invading the announcer’s booth. He even joined in on a thunderous “GOOOOAL” call with Andres Cantor, which the rap icon nailed thanks to years behind the mic, before being gifted with a custom U.S. soccer jersey.\n\nDate: Aug. 4\n\nMartha Stewart helped her good friend Snoop Dogg confront his fear of horses in Paris while they pulled up to the Dressage Team Grand Prix Special. Snoop even fed some of the horses competing, as there was one named Gin & Juice after his Doggystyle anthem. “This is one of my new favorite sports,” he told sports commentator Mike Tirico.\n\nDate: Aug. 5\n\nIt ain’t a party without Snoop Dogg in the building. He pulled up to Team USA Basketball’s celebration of its 50th anniversary ahead of the hoops squads’ knockout round games on Monday night (Aug. 5). The Doggfather hit the stage to perform his Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Drop It like It’s Hot” and a cover of Next’s “Too Close.” From LeBron James to Kevin Durant and Tom Brady, there was plenty of star power in attendance."
