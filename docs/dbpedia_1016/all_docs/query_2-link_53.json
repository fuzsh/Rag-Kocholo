The last time he teated me we were in the A Shau Valley where we spent a lot of our time. I had sores and swelling up and down both legs so he sent me ba...\n\nI was younger, but I remember my uncle very well. He was the kind of man who was always respectful, and heart of gold. I remember him always telling weird funny stories, my favorite was about a angry moose when he was living in Alaska with my aunt Missy and cousins. He showed me the world still h...\n\nFor a long time there were four little girls in the family. My mother had two girls and her brother had two girls. One day, surprise! A little boy showed up.

It is almost impossible to describe the Respect...\n\nI'm actually Nookie's second cousin and I never met him, but heard so much about him from my father. I wanted to pay tribute to \"Nookie\" for his service and because he was an only child, to let him know family still thinks of him.\n\nNot a day goes by that I do not think of Tim and the rest of Hot Rod 5 Bravo. Dearly missed and never forgotten. Love you"
