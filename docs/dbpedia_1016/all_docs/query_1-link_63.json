        "text": "It's always sad to see a game company shut down, and most game companies don't have the history, the potential, and the parade of memorable characters that Hudson Soft does. And on March 1, Hudson ended its run. It'll soldier on as part of Konami, and its logo will endure with Konami's name beneath that little Hudson Bee. The two companies have collaborated many times before (Hudson even co-developed Suikoden V), but this truly ends Hudson's 38 years of business.\n\nHudson was never a major force as far as most American kids were concerned. We knew of Adventure Island, we might've owned Milon's Secret Castle, and we sure liked Bomberman when enough people joined in. But Hudson didn't catch us in the same way as Capcom and Konami and the red elliptical aegis of Nintendo. Perhaps this stemmed from Hudson being yet another company that was much more prominent in Japan than it ever was overseas. Hudson was Nintendo's first third-party publisher in Japan, and the company quickly established itself with Star Soldier, specialized controllers, and the button-slamming skills of Takahashi Meijin. Hudson even pioneered game-related anime with the 1986 film (and shameless product spotlight) Running Boy Star Soldier no Himitsu, which premiered on a double bill with Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. anime flick. Meanwhile, kids in North America and Europe only knew Takahashi Meijin as that goofy-mouthed “Master Higgins” from Adventure Island. And the only Hudson-backed anime they saw were the commercials for Mendel Palace and Xexyz.\n\nSo it went with other Hudson Soft hits. The PC Engine, a joint venture of NEC and Hudson, was a success in Japan but a marginalized third-placer in the U.S., despite the appeal of Hudson's Bonk games. A similar fate befell Tengai Makyo, an RPG series set in a medieval Japan cleverly and bizarrely distorted by the perspective of a completely fictional Western author. It was nearly the equal of Final Fantasy and Lunar in the 1990s, but cultural barriers and ridiculous stereotypes kept Tengai Makyo from coming West, especially when the fourth game in the series was based in a hilariously improper vision of 19th-century America. At most, these shores might've seen the Tengai Makyo fighting game Kabuki Klash in arcades.\n\nAnd so Hudson Soft drifts into history, much like some used CD store two towns over. You went there maybe once or twice, but the only thing you ever bought was a Belly album because it was two dollars and you hadn't heard “Feed the Tree” in years. Then one day you drove by and noticed that the store was gone. And it didn't feel right.\n\nIt's too late to save Hudson now, but it's not too late to appreciate what they did. So go gather your friends for some Bomberman. Pick up a Bonk game. Survive The Adventures of Dino-Riki as long as you can. Try to beat Xexyz without skipping any levels. Hunt down Adventure Island IV, an explorative and Japan-only installment of the series. Trudge into a Tengai Makyo game, even if it's not in English. Grab a copy of Lost in Shadow, an Ico-ish Wii title that was Hudson's last notable release. That'll feel right.\n\nNEWS\n\nSTREET FIGHTER X TEKKEN UPSETS PLAYERS BEFORE IT'S EVEN OUT\n\nSo what's getting us all mad this week? Capcom. There was already a bit of resentment brewing over the company's announcement that Street Fighter X Tekken, arriving for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week, would hit the PS Vita in the fall with twelve extra characters. Many people assumed that Capcom would later release those characters as downloads for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. Some copies of Street Fighter X Tekken shipped (or leaked) early, and fans soon discovered that the bonus characters are already in the game. Curiously, Pac-Man and a tubby Mega Man are locked away in the Xbox 360 game as well as the PS3 one, even though they were said to be exclusive to the latter.\n\nGranted, some of the characters don't look finished yet—Elena seems just a little off, being the game's only bonus Street Fighter character who wasn't ported over from Street Fighter IV. This hasn't stopped fans from complaining long and loud about the temerity of a company charging extra to unlock content that's already in a game. Capcom's official statement confirms that the characters will be downloadable in the fall, and mentions that they're on the disc to “ensure for a smooth transition.” Capcom notably doesn't say how much the twelve extra characters will cost, and they may be thinking carefully on that point. We've already seen that players tolerate bonus material that's…well, a bonus, but they're less forgiving when they have to pay to unlock something they already own.\n\nCapcom incurred more spite when it was revealed that the Xbox 360 version of Street Fighter X Tekken doesn't allow two local players to take part in tag-team matches online. The PlayStation 3 version lets you sit down with a friend in person and use one PSN account to fight online, but XBox Live apparently doesn't permit that. According to Capcom, this won't be fixed with a patch.\n\nTo end this on a lighter note, it's good to see references aplenty in Street Fighter X Tekken. Yet it's also a little mean-spirited for Dan, who's only the tutorial mode instructor here, to mock SNK's Terry Bogard now. Sure, Capcom, make fun of SNK. You had your fun with your SNK-Capcom crossovers, and now you think that you can just throw out SNK like an old controller now that you've got Tekken to cuddle up with. Hmph.\n\nAN ALLEGEDLY POPULAR VIRTUA FIGHTER STEPS INTO DEAD OR ALIVE 5\n\nDead or Alive 5 director Yosuke Hayashi was a tad vague about mixing the series with another fighter (see the interview below), but now the secret's out. While not a full-blown crossover, the next Dead or Alive will feature Akira Yūki, Virtua Fighter's lead. While some may consider Akira a pretty bland choice and others may be shocked that Tecmo didn't borrow one of Virtua Fighter's female characters, he could be only the first of several Virtua Fighter loans. At the least, it gives Sega some extra push for Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown's arrival on XBox Live and the PlayStation Network this year.\n\nAs for Dead or Alive 5, it shows off Tecmo's new emphasis on dynamic stages, whether it's a rooftop brawl interrupted by a crashing helicopter or a raft ride that hits a waterfall while two characters are hashing it out. Ryu, Ayane, Hitomi, Kasumi, and Hayate (and Akira) are the only characters shown so far, however. When other characters do emerge, Hayashi has said that Dead or Alive 5's visual style will tone down the ridiculously pneumatic sex-bomb designs the series is known for, opting instead for something “more high class.” Still, this doesn't keep Kasumi's skirt from flapping around in her exhibition match against Akira.\n\nPERSONA 4 FIGHTER GETS AN ALL-NEW, ALL-MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER\n\nSince this column's already overloaded with fighting-game news, here's something from Persona 4: Arena. All of the game's previously unveiled characters came from Persona 3 or 4, though many of their outfits were redesigned for this upcoming fighter from Atlus and Arc System Works. However, the latest addition is a woman named Labrys, and she's largely new to Persona.\n\nDescribed as a self-appointed student-council leader, Labrys appears to be the same brand of footless android as Persona 3's Aigis, and her origins reportedly lie in a radio drama based on Persona 3. She wields a huge and unorthodoxly high-tech axe in battle, and she's wearing the uniform of Yasogami High, the same school attended by the cast of Persona 4. So who is she? And will she appear in the upcoming Persona 4: The Golden? Right now she's in the arcade version of Persona 4: Arena (or The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena, as it's called in Japan), and she'll be playable in the game's Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports this summer. And then she'll probably raise even more questions.\n\nIN BRIEF: SOL TRIGGER IS ANNOUNCED, DARKSTALKERS 4 IS RUMORED\n\nImageepoch, developer of Luminous Arc and 7th Dragon, has another RPG in store for the PSP. It's called Sol Trigger, it's written by Final Fantasy's Kazushige Nojima, and it's apparently all about revolutionaries. The characters, designed by manga artist Shuji Sogabe, all use magi-mechanized Sol Arms as their weapons: protagonist Farrell has a sword, his friend Emma has a gun, and his other friend Walter has a sickle. Other details are scarce, but Sol Trigger's deep enough in development to have a summertime release date in Japan.\n\nRumors of new Darkstalkers games inevitably let me down, but I'm compelled to report every one of them. The latest comes from Venture Beat, and it suggests that a fourth Darkstalkers started development last year under the guidance of Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono, who's utilizing the same engine that powers Street Fighter X Tekken. Tales of Darkstalkers 4 have emerged many times in the 12 years since Darkstalkers 3, but Venture Beat reports that this news comes from the same source that leaked entirely accurate details about Resident Evil 6.\n\nINTERVIEW: NINJA GAIDEN 3'S YOSUKE HAYASHI\n\nNinja Gaiden 3 might surprise you shortly into its first stage. After diving into a London block infested with terrorists, franchise hero Ryu Hayabusa carves up dozens of enemies with merciless, bloody abandon. Then he's faced with an uncommon sight in the Ninja Gaiden games: one terrorist stands with his hands in the air, begging Ryu to spare his life. His pleas and mentions of his family do not a bit of good, though. Whether the player likes it or not, Ryu has to kill this unarmed man to move forward in the game.\n\nIt's all part of Ninja Gaiden 3's attempt to answer a question that director Yosuke Hayashi saw posed by the previous games in the series—and by many of today's gruesome crowd-pleasers. Is Ryu really justified in murdering hundreds of semi-competent foot soldiers in his fight against an international demon cabal? And if so, just what sort of morality is a game like this endorsing? Naturally, these themes are tested in an action game honed with the same care as the two previous Ninja Gaidens, balancing on that ridge between a satisfying challenge and pure frustration. Aside from the narrative, Ninja Gaiden 3 also plays with Ryu's powers by having him absorb his Dragon Sword into his arm, awakening all sorts of strange possibilities.\n\nWe'll find out if Ninja Gaiden 3's attempt at drama pays off very shortly, as the game arrives on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in two weeks. But we still couldn't resist tossing a few questions at Hayashi. First joining Tecmo with Dead or Alive 4, he directed Ninja Gaiden Sigma as well as the DS spin-off Dragon Sword, and he's currently at the helm of the company's two biggest franchises.\n\nWhere did you get the idea to take a more dramatic approach with Ninja Gaiden 3?\n\nYosuke Hayashi: From the get-go with Ninja Gaiden, we've been making games where the controllability was really good, but there wasn't much of an emotional connection with the player. Looking at this generation and the games that are out there, the standard for what's required is an emotional connection. In that regard, we felt that we should take what we've had and make it emotionally deeper.\n\nHow did you start working with Masato Kato, the writer of the original Ninja Gaiden NES games? Is he including any references to the original trilogy?\n\nWhen we started development for Ninja Gaiden 3 and thought about reinventing Ryu Hayabusa for the game, we decided “Who better to do it than the writer of the original game?” We spoke to him and he was very positive about the project and he helped us out a lot. Ninja Gaiden 3 can be enjoyed as a stand-alone game, but of course for our fans who've played the old games, we've put a few little touches in there.\n\nNinja Gaiden has a reputation for being challenging. How do you refine the game without driving away casual players?\n\nWell, we've made it difficult for a reason. For this game, we have high and low difficulties matched to different play styles. We don't so much measure if a game is too hard or too easy. We understand that there's a wide spectrum of players that get into the game, and they have different skill levels.\n\nIn the NES versions, we saw them as cinematic action games at the time. But with the new Xbox games, they've been more about the challenge. With Ninja Gaiden 3, it involves the whole sphere of Ninja Gaiden games, from the NES up until now.\n\nHow did your work on Metroid: Other M influence Ninja Gaiden 3?\n\nIn Metroid Other M, we worked with [Yoshio] Sakamoto from Nintendo. One of the biggest things we learned from him was in the way he always used to say “There is emotion in every human being.” He is always aware that there are fine and complex emotions in each human character. Up to now, we've made games that are mostly about sex and violence—easily understood emotions that are at two extreme ends of a scale. But the things we learned with Other M, about human emotion and human complexity, we'll try to explore that.\n\nWhat sort of character mix will Dead or Alive 5 have? Are you planning to add new characters?\n\nWe can't give an exact number, but we'll have enough characters to keep players satisfied, and we'll have new characters as well.\n\nYou mentioned that you're making Dead or Alive's stages resemble a big action-movie climax. What films in particular inspired this?\n\nWe haven't been inspired by a certain film or director. It's more a blending of different kinds of entertainment.\n\nIf you had to cross Dead or Alive over with another fighting series, which would you want to take on?\n\nI think it's interesting to look into pairing it up with another 3-D fighter.\n\nHow has your perspective on games changed since you became a developer?\n\nI was aware of Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden. I played the old Ninja Gaiden games on the NES, and I obviously liked them. But when you get into making the games and developing the engines, you really get to love your franchises and they become a part of you.\n\nOf the original 8-Bit Ninja Gaiden games, which was your favorite?\n\nThe first one was my favorite. I think it was the opening scene that did it for me, where the two ninja leap and slice at each other in mid-air.\n\nNEXT WEEK'S RELEASES"
