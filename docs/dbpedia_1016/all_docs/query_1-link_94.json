        "text": "March 1st marks the last day for Hudson Soft who will be closing their doors that day. They’ve been making games since 1978, including some greats like Milon’s Secret Castle, Bomberman, and a slew of Mario Party games. Just the other day, Hudson board members agreed for the company to be absorbed into Konami Digital Entertainment.\n\nSo thanks for all the fun memories and all the great multiplayer games that brought us together with our friends."
