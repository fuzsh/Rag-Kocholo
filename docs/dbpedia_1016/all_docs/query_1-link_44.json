        "text": "Background\n\nNDCube Co., Ltd. is a Japanese video game developer formed as a joint venture between Nintendo and the Japanese advertising company Dentsu on March 1, 2000, with the former currently holding a majority stake since 2010. Many of its employees moved from Hudson Soft during its absorption into Konami in 2012. The studio is best known for developing games in the Mario Party series since Mario Party 9.\n\nLogo (April 18, 2003)\n\nVisuals: Over a black background is the then-current NDCube logo (consisting of \"Nd\" in the corporate Nintendo logo font, and \"CUBE\" below in the same font used for the Nintendo GameCube logo, all in a blue outline) bounce down before settling in the middle of the screen, with holes where the letters would be. The white letters of the logo then drop down one by one into their holes (the logo slightly jolts back as each letter falls onto it), and the logo becomes 2D as copyright reading \"Â© 2003 NDCUBE Co.,Ltd.\" appears below.\n\nTechnique: 2D digital animation.\n\nAudio: None."
