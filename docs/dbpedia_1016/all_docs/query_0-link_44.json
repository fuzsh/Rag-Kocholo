        "text": "Let's go!\n\n01. Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled (2019, Switch) ★☆☆☆☆\n\nWhew, been a while since I disliked a game this instantly! The Crash Team Racing remake opens with no less than 84 pages of EULA/privacy policy, and demands you to always be online to interact with several of its modes. All this occurs before you're even let into the main menu and can be repelled by the game on its own terms. Luckily it wastes no time to catch up to its terrible first impression, as you're slowly being fed tutorials by a sentient Tiki mask (not the only vaguely reductive colonialist imagery in the game, you also race a stereotypical \"bushman\"), and the game insists on quickly becoming the worst Saturday morning cartoon you've ever seen. With absolutely hideous characters, all of whom constantly make repulsive noises, Crash Team Racing makes it difficult to root for anyone in its flimsy adventure mode.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game inadvertently makes the best case yet for kart racers to step away from these hub worlds which make players drive to level entrances. All it seems to facilitate here is an excuse to fill the overworld with useless extra padding - which in turn powers the customization engine and its microtransactions (which Activision sneaked into the game a while after reviews went up). For what it's worth, the game runs well (barring loadtimes), looks polished (despite the repugnant art style), and while I don't like its finicky drifting there's at least skill involved. There's a high skill ceiling, and tons of content for fans to collect. But as a non-fan without nostalgia for the property I wasn't swayed by the kernels of good kart racing found under this avalanche of dross. CTRNF was free on Switch Online for a week, and I still regret finishing it.\n\n02. Final Fantasy IX (2000/2019, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nOne of the oldest denizens of my backlog, which I've restarted at least thrice over the years before the most recent attempt almost melted my elderly PS1. Some time-saving cheats on Switch got me over the hill after routinely stranding at the end of Disc 1. At this point I might need to accept Final Fantasy as a series may not be for me, but FF IX shines undeniably bright in many areas.\n\nThis entry is built on Shakespearean traditions, with its play-within-play opening scene, comedic asides, disguised identities, and the misplaced love letter scene which feels straight out of Twelfth Night. More broadly, a European folklore/fantasy setting underpins it all: from locations (with names like Lindblum, Burmecia, and Alexandria), to fashion, music (waltzes and comedic jaunts), and its creature designs (anthropomorphic rats, dogs, hippopotami). This historical shorthand allows the steampunk elements to slot right in; it sells the notion of Gaia's own impending industrial revolution.\n\nBy establishing a coherent fantasy setting, characters are free to interact rather than explain the world, and that's when the game is at its best. The class system assigns rigid roles to characters, in contrast to more flexible Job Systems of earlier Final Fantasies. It's done purposefully however: pre-determined classes allow the characters to fulfill archetypal stage roles (the disguised princess, mad queen, the rogue, a pompous knight, two malevolent jesters, etc.). The already large cast is supplemented with many ancillary figures, which has the unfortunate side effect of short-changing several characters' development.\n\nLate addition Amarant completes only the barest of arcs, for example. Young Eiko is saddled with a lot of exposition which seems at odds with her immaturity, while Freya (in a cruel twist of irony) gets somewhat forgotten by the plot midway through. The jesters' side switching feels perfunctory, and while some characters with mysterious backgrounds receive early foreshadowing, protagonist Zidane gets almost none, meaning the revelation of his origin feels like a cheap twist rather than an earned surprise.\n\nConversely however, Vivi, Dagger, Steiner, (and Freya early on) successfully carry a lot of the core themes. Vivi is the stand-out, his adorable design pairs well with tragedy for emotional gut punches. Meanwhile comic relief Steiner is an initially frustrating presence, since the audience already knows conclusions he takes ages to reach. However, he grows in lockstep along the running theme of personal identity and choice vs. externally determined fate. Dagger undergoes the most transformations of all, and while she is saddled with damsel tropes and a weak (and frankly, creepy) co-lead, her character has the most range of all. Lastly, delightful agent of chaos Quina, who learns nothing, and has almost no internal struggle, serves as a funhouse mirror to the rest of the cast.\n\nThe strength of this ensemble is most evident in contrast to the rocky story. While thematically cohesive, its pacing is wonky at best. The plot initially takes a flying start, and strings a veritable D&D campaign's worth of individual scenarios together (evil forest, ice cave, festival arc, treetop city), but also has no qualms at all about cratering its pacing after pivotal events. Most egregious is when the principal antagonist is sidelined, only to be followed by a card game tournament of all things; what is this, Yu-Gi-Oh!? These distracting plot cul-de-sacs leave the late game swerve poorly foreshadowed. Suddenly the player is buried in an avalanche of destined fates, interdimensional planetary conflict, and man-behind-the-curtain reveals. These twists barely convince, and come at the expense of grinding everyone's character arcs to a halt. The result is a story which feels entirely too long (did we really need the dwarf village, or the empty mole people town?) and simultaneously rushed (the 4 mirrors quest reeks of cut content, and towards the end everyone just teleports from place to place).\n\nNone of this Bizarro-world pacing is aided either by the slow dialogues and glacial combat. It's not a bad turn-based system, with easily understood front/back row mechanics, and stats and skills tied to gear. But the Trance system is too scattershot to strategise around, and party composition is hindered by Zidane's mandatory presence and two white mages whose healing quickly becomes obsolete. Particularly miserable are encounter loading times and the combat's sluggishness. Few things are worse than your entire party getting hit and watching a slow-motion conga line of auto-potions trigger, while you twiddle your thumbs. The Fast Forward and No Encounters cheats are essential additions in this port - use them liberally.\n\nFinal Fantasy IX misses quite a few of the swings it takes, but has the liberty to take them thanks to a very solid foundation. Yes, Zidane is a skeevy lead, there's a curious amount of silence despite its sizable score, the card game is a step down, the story is awkwardly paced at times, and without cheats the battles are too slow. But there are ample successful elements to fall back on; a testament to its strong worldbuilding, cohesive gear/battle system, and endearing characters. Lastly, the modern port allows players to sand off some rough edges, while letting the truly impressive production values sing, too.\n\n03. Aleste a.k.a. Power Strike (1988/2020, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nThis spiritual sequel to Zanac kicked off a new franchise starting on the Sega Mark III and MSX. Similar to Hudson's Star Soldier, this was made for a home audience, rather than arcades. Aleste blows its competitor out the water however: the level progression conveys a storyline, bosses are smartly assembled from smaller enemies, and there's FM sound support. It's tricky how power-ups float up, rather than down the screen. M2's port includes both regional releases, the FM and chiptune soundtracks, and adds an Easy mode to address the issue of losing power-ups upon death. Very impressive even today.\n\n04. Power Strike II (1993/2020, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nPreviously exclusive to the Master System in Brazil and PAL regions, this one's a curious entry. A 1930s alt-future gives them license to depart from Aleste's space setting and instead use Medieval castles, WW1 tanks, trains, and air pirates. Bosses are now complete sprites rather than segmented, the whole game is faster, and it looks a lot sharper.\n\nLesser addition is the charge shot, which is mapped to the same button as regular fire and is thus easy to forget about. Meanwhile button #2 is wasted on a speed adjustment, which you'll use for two bosses tops. Palette-swapped boss sprites also recycle, which is a bummer, and the final boss is a real meat grinder. Worth noting too how the aspect ratio on Switch Lite is absolutely miniscule. Perhaps this can be fixed in the options, but I can't read Japanese.\n\n05. Seirei Senshi Spriggan (1991, TG-16 Mini) ★★★★★\n\nFirst of two Spriggan shooters on PC Engine-CD by Compile, unrelated to the manga of the same name. Supposedly conceived as Seirei Senshi Aleste, the sequel to MUSHA Aleste (Sega Genesis), before the publisher wanted their own franchise. As per usual the CD technology is mostly used for voice samples, and stilted animations between the levels. Can't comment on the story due to a language barrier, but based purely on gameplay this is a delight. It avoids the Gradius problem of de-powering players upon death, by making you scramble to pick up your power-ups, and bringing in new ones at a steady pace. This also does the Final Soldier thing where you can blow up your power-ups, albeit with different results, since mixing & matching various powers leads to different shot patterns. During boss fights you'll likely cycle through several patterns in quick succession, lending the feel of a powerful, adaptable mech.\n\nThe ending of this game is hype as hell by the way, it goes on for 2 stages longer than you'd think, and has at least 6 multi-phase bosses, all of whom could make a satisfying final boss. I feared this would be a weak work-for-hire affair, but it's quietly one of the best shooters on the PC Engine, a system already loaded with good ones. Highly recommended!\n\n06. Spriggan Mark 2: Re-Terraform Project (1992, TG-16 Mini) ★★☆☆☆\n\nThe only horizontal scroller in this batch, and the lack of experience shows. Bosses all have appendages to reach across the screen, and your sprite's hitbox is huge, making shots harder to dodge. The game attempts to balance this with a big shield meter and by upping your damage output from the jump, rather than relying on grabbing power-ups. This shortcut works, but feels obviously compromised given the usual precision of enemy and pick-up placements in Aleste games.\n\nSpriggan Mark 2 has more cinematic ambitions however: there's minutes-long cut-scenes and boatloads of conversations. Since this is the PC Engine-CD, scenes don't layer over gameplay, meaning the game constantly freezes to play Japanese dialogue. Luckily these can be turned off, so the game is at least continually playable.\n\nIt's not all bad: graphically this is a real showcase, with several layers of parallax, Gundam-esque detailed mech designs, and while the cut-scenes feel endless they're impressive for the time. The move to ammo counters for most weapons feels like a daring choice too given the genre, and results in needing to carefully pick which to use when.\n\nSpriggan got one more sequel on Super Famicom without Compile's involvement, called Spriggan Powered, but a modern take on this might honestly be Astebreed (cinematic, lots of dialogue during gameplay, sword to cancel bullets - it's all there).\n\n07. GG Aleste (1991/2020, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nFirst of two Aleste titles on Game Gear. A run-of-the-mill shooter, with oddly easy and unmemorable bosses (outside the final MoonChild). Has that problem where some power-ups are better than others, meaning you're dodging objects meant to help you after finding the Homing or Napalm lasers. This port eliminates the slowdown of the original, so playing on hard (where enemies will fire another shot at you upon being hit) injects some challenge in an otherwise breezy game.\n\n08. GG Aleste II a.k.a. Power Strike II GG (1993/2020, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nThe second Game Gear entry (both regional versions are included!) is an improvement, with creative bosses attempting some storytelling, better weapon balance, and faster, impressive levels. Not all additions are improvements though. The Bombs feels like an afterthought as you rarely get any, while extra lives and your shield are tied to your actions through score and pick-ups. The bonus stages attempt Space Harrier-esque Super Scaler 3D, but without obvious ways to invert controls I found these frustrating. On balance this is the better of the two, but it's a bit harder from the jump, so the bar to entry is slightly higher.\n\n09. GG Aleste 3 (2020, Switch) ★★★★★\n\nA quarter of a century passes without an Aleste game in sight, and the minute someone hands M2 the keys to the kingdom they blow the doors off their hinges! Theoretically built for the Game Gear Micro of all consoles, they far exceed the limits of the hardware here; this feels like a PC-Engine release. The stereo (!) score is catchy, bullets fly at you fast, and graphically it far exceeds the first two GG Aleste outings.\n\nLevels cleverly tell stories, with bosses hidden in terrain, and gravity affects you in the stratosphere level. The devious routing subtly forces you to constantly swap weapons and take advantage of micro-invincibilities upon pickup. M2 are on a creative peak here: one boss steals your power-up, another is easier if you allow yourself to be hit by certain shots, and a third one cribs its signature move from Battle Garegga (no accident; there's some developer crossover here). A commanding display of mastery, worth importing despite its difficult final stage.\n\n10. Super Bomberman R (2017, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nOne of the earliest Switch games, which I recall catching some heat at the time. Nowadays it's a mostly fixed game: I had no issues with controls, framerate, unbalanced difficulty, and other frequent complaints. Sadly the camera remains an issue: while the angle was fixed, this game will never reach that immediate overhead readability, since you need a slanted view to discern the inclines. I'm not convinced it was worth sacrificing that clarity to include height variations, as they don't lead to many interesting ideas outside a map or two.\n\nThe in-game art style is a departure from the franchise's cartoony origins, but it looks nice, and enemies retained funny animations. Bossfights are a highlight here (fun to see TwinBee represented!), even if they're quite formulaic. There's also a story mode with Flash-style animated cut-scenes which closer match the franchise's Saturday Morning Cartoon vibe, but they're extremely annoying due to shrill voice overs and weak writing. Overall nothing special, but a good enough return for the series to consoles.\n\n11. Bomberman '93 (1992, TG-16 Mini) ★★★☆☆\n\nEarly Bomberman entry, with a 7 world story mode. The levels are anemic and samey, but the enemy variety and their funny animations keep it from going stale. Bosses are really tough since one hit usually kills you. Also, the music is surprisingly bad for a Hudson release of this era. This entire game was soundly outclassed by its sequel Mega Bomberman and is thus functionally obsolete, but worth a go if you crave more Bomberman and have exhausted all the better ones.\n\n12. Air Zonk (1992, TG-16 Mini) ★★★☆☆\n\nDid the TurboGrafx-CD really need another horizontal shooter? No, but maybe the Bonk series is better served in this direction. Air Zonk is a visual showcase, with cartoon influences everywhere. The highlight is a cat laser which pummels foes with onomatopoeia. The other weapons and helper animals are wildly unbalanced; Mini Zonk is obviously superior with his reduced hitbox and tracking fire, leaving the rest languishing in disuse. The entire game strikes me as curiously forgettable, despite a strong soundtrack and varied environments (the last Bonk throwback level is particularly cathartic).\n\n13. Crimzon Clover: World EXplosion (2020, Switch) ★★★★★\n\nThe third major Crimzon Clover revision is currently exclusive to Switch, and I wonder if that's to blame for the lack of buzz on this one. More fully-featured than ever, you effectively have 10 subtly different modes to tackle its perfectly paced 30 minute campaign. The new Arranged mode adds Gradius-esque upgrades into the mix, there are extensive leaderboards, a training mode, and a full replay system. All this content looks great with the new paintjob, and there's multiple soundtracks now too.\n\nUnfortunately Crimzon Clover is not the easiest game to get into, despite giving you endless continues. An auto-bomb upon being hit could really go a long way in making the Novice mode actually accessible to novices. Another thing I would have liked to see improved is adding the sliver of a story here. At least make it clear if we're the aggressor or a lone defender, and against who. Danmaku Unlimited 3 is similarly sparse in story, but much more effective at providing player motivation thanks to three sentences throughout its campaign. Overall though, an incredible display of craft, easily the best shooter on Switch.\n\n14. Raiden V: Director's Cut (2019, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nFirst released on Xbox One in 2016, Raiden V correctly identifies a lot of problems shoot 'em ups face in the current market, but the effectiveness of its solutions varies. The genre struggles with a lack of content, low production values, and a lack of narrative to hook players. MOSS address this by producing a slick game with 3D models, 20+ stages locked behind various routes, and a story with constant voice acting while you play. The latter is a neat idea, and sometimes comments are made about your performance, but while you're trying to dodge ten gazillion bullets you tend to either zone out or be distracted by it. Unfortunately the story is cookie cutter shonen anime nonsense too, so your incentive to listen to it is low.\n\nSimilarly, the genre often eschews trends towards online play: lag would be disruptive, so these games usually restrict themselves to a leaderboard at most. Raiden V 's innovation is the 'Cheer' system: if players reach milestones (50 kills, find a collectable, beat a boss, etc.) others can Cheer for them at the press of a button. Receiving Cheers fills up your special, so there's incentive to play well and receive Cheers, as well as send them out to help out others. It's simple, but effective, and it's cool to see at the end how you and a few others were basically trading cheers for an hour.\n\nUltimately however, all these additions (story, Cheer system, and other sidebar gizmos) are a tad distracting from what is a very demanding shooter. You can opt out of them, but the sidebars remain there eating up screen real estate. This is a problem since the camera zooms out quite far sometimes, making some miniscule bullets hard to see on Switch Lite. It doesn't help how the most common pick-ups and incoming shots are both yellow, which feels like a rookie error despite MOSS' decades of experience. I definitely applaud the efforts here, and I'm glad Raiden is headed in this direction rather than the creepy waifu angle in MOSS' other series Caladrius Blaze, but it's not the home-run it could've been.\n\n15. G-MODE Archives29 Zanac (1986/2021, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nHaving played about half the Aleste games earlier this year, seeing their predecessor Zanac arrive on Switch was a welcome surprise. All of the Aleste 1 DNA is already here: numbered power-ups which float away from you, segmented bosses, and shot levels separated from weapon types. It seems like an impressive game for the time.\n\nHowever, I'm having trouble figuring out which version this one's based on. It looks like the G-MODE Archives are re-releases of Japanese Java phone games. The clunky menu translation claims they are faithful ports of classic games. However, the MSX, NES, and Famicom Disk System versions all look very different, with much more detailed backgrounds and a bright, garish colour palette. This version also has just a single song looping throughout. If anyone knows the missing link I'd love to hear it!\n\n16. Sapphire a.k.a. Ginga Fukei Densetsu Sapphire (1995, TG-16 Mini) ★★☆☆☆\n\nThis rare vertical shooter was long hidden behind a series of obstacles: it's a Japan-only release, arriving late in the life of the already uncommon PC-Engine Super CD-Rom², wouldn't function without an additional Arcade RAM expansion, and saw only a small print run. Now more widely available on the PSP and TurboGrafx-16 Mini, I have to draw the unfortunate conclusion its reputation is... largely derived from its rarity.\n\nSapphire is visually impressive, with art design from a Gundam veteran, and achieving way larger faux-polygonal sprites than Vectorman and Donkey Kong Country ever did, but on older hardware. It leverages CD audio by the Lords of Thunder team for a typical pre-grunge '90ies buttrock soundtrack, and everything runs fast without slowdown.\n\nUnfortunately, the selectable ships did not receive that memo. While your firepower is substantial, with wide beams covering half the screen, all but one of the playable ships move glacially slow. This is obviously by design, as slow ships give access to more powerful shot types, but since enemies and their fire don't wait around, you'll even feel sluggish in the default ship. It's cool to use the more powerful, slower ships on replays, but some situations feel impossible without resorting to Bombs. Sapphire looks slick, but I wonder if the collectors forking over $1000+ for the original will be disappointed.\n\n17. Armed 7DX (2020, Wii U) ★★★☆☆\n\nContains both 2009's Armed Seven, and the updated 2019 DreamCast homebrew version, Armed 7DX. This is a horizontally scrolling mech shooter, in which you zoom through a ravaged Earth and blast foes with weighty weapons. There's not much visual storytelling, but they do foreshadow some bosses in the background, and the space level flips some enemies upside down and has them hurling space shuttles at you. Otherwise it's standard genre fare, with minor wrinkles thrown in: your fire angle adjusts to your movement slightly, and you've got an auto-recharging Special beam to manage. Astro Port's obsession with encouraging replays is already noticeable here, with 4 difficulty modes and several weapon combinations you can't switch mid-run (unlike their later games Satazius and Wolflame).\n\nThe version differences are mostly cosmetic: Armed Seven has a drab, military camo look with crunchy pixels and rather cheap MIDI instrumentation (particularly the Stage 3 guitars, yuck). Armed 7DX smooths out the pixels, adds a lot more colour, and swaps out the OST for a bass-boosted Eurodance affair. It sounds less cheap, but not necessarily better. Similarly, the visual upgrade makes the HUD more instantly readable, but the garish colours mesh poorly with the original assets. On the whole I prefer the original slightly, so it's nice both versions are included.\n\n18. Wolflame (2020, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nRe-release of Astro Port's 2016 vertical shooter, Wolflame is a solid traditional outing. Dodge shots, blow up tanks, collect extra turrets to increase firepower, and an upbeat OST. It lets you mix & match turrets on the fly to some degree which means repeat runs can differ dynamically, and for you FlipGrippers - yes it runs in vertical orientation too.\n\nThat said, I also feel this is a bit barebones. No online leaderboards, or alternate ships to unlock. Combined with the samey backdrops, and the relatively long 10-stage campaign, it gets dull after a few runs. It's not quite as entry-level as Armed 7, but for beginner-to-intermediate players of the genre this has a well-paced difficulty curve, and its simplicity might be a boon rather than a detriment. It rarely feels cheap, except for the super fast pink bullets tanks can spit out and which require lightning-fast reflexes.\n\n19. Shikhondo: Soul Eater (2018, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nGorgeous bullet hell shooter from a tiny Korean developer. Lush monsters and demons from Chinese, Korean, and Japanese folkloric traditions feature against scroll painted backdrops, and barf billions of bullets in your direction. Intricate shot patterns blossom open in floral patterns, while breakbeats and drum & bass try to catch you off-guard. Shikhondo is dedicated to its style, but on Switch Lite some bullets look microscopic. One other thing I dislike is when previously seen enemies return in later stages with different fire patterns. Just palette-swap them to clue players in!\n\n20. Military Madness a.k.a. Nectaris (1989, TG-16 Mini) ★★★☆☆\n\nAllied and Axis troops duke it out on the Moon in this rudimentary turn-based tactics game. Lacks the sophistication the genre would later develop, but frankly it's not bad, just missing convenience features we've come to take for granted. You can't see enemies' exact movement range like in Fire Emblem, so better learn their ranges by heart! Precise attack/defense stats are a guessing game too (since terrain, support, luck, and battle experience affect units' performances).\n\nThis game also suffers the Advance Wars problem where missions are effectively won 3 turns in, but continue as battles of attrition unless someone captures the other base. It's visually bland, with samey maps and units throughout, but none of the personality of the aforementioned franchises. With just ~6 music tracks this quickly became a mute-and-podcast affair, especially when levels stretched into the hour per mission mark. Good for its time though, I pulled off some surprisingly tense, narrow victories which felt rewarding.\n\n21. Super Mario Maker (2015, Wii U) ★★★★☆\n\nFast-tracked this from the backlog, due to inbound changes. It's a polished, user-friendly level editor, with funny touches (costumes, visual puns in the boot screen). There's a sense of existing on life support, now that MiiVerse is gone and loadtimes can exceed level playtimes. But I was surprised by how vibrant the community still seemed. All my shoddy levels got played within days, and some top creators were still releasing giant new levels.\n\nUnfortunately I'm bad at 2D Mario, and not creative enough to make compelling, cohesive levels. In addition to my own ineptitude, Mario Maker suffers from a compounding quantity over quality problem: half the levels are absurd garbage with purposely obscured insta-kills or 10,000 enemy gauntlets, and there's no way to force the 100 Life challenge to only pick top ranked levels. From March 31st onwards this game will continue without an influx of new levels, and someday the party will end entirely, but I'm glad I got to partake in one of its last dances before everyone is quietly ushered out the door.\n\n22. Habroxia 2 (2021, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nRetro-styled twin-stick space shooter with similarities to Darius, but without the ludicrous difficulty. Zoom through space caves, take on bosses with unique behavioural patterns, upgrade your ship between the branching levels, and rescue astronauts like in Defender or Resogun. It's quite fully-featured given the small scope of the project: Habroxia 2 has a (perfunctory) story, 3 unlockable modes, and levels switch back and forth between horizontal/vertical directions.\n\nMinor complaints: due to the twin-stick setup, it uses the analog stick, no D-pad option. Homing shots chase you perhaps a tad too long, and it's a bummer the story conceit does not inform the gameplay (especially since you can save other astronauts). If I remember correctly onpoint worked on this, so I hope fellow shmup fans support this release.\n\n23. Axiom Verge (2016, Wii U) ★★★★☆\n\nHomage to Metroid, which tries to carve out its own identity by focusing on varied weapons and story, to mixed results. I don't dislike the story, but it suffers from a boring protagonist, and a lot of purposefully mysterious technobabble is thrown around in attempt to imbue the project with more depth than its world appears to support. That said, the world itself is a joy to traverse once your movement options open up, and Axiom Verge has an S-tier soundtrack, so finding new areas is worth it just for more songs.\n\nOne chestnut it doesn't crack is how to scale difficulty alongside the player's growth. Besides the first boss, few of the later ones gave me trouble, and I blew through the last three in one go. Most of my deaths were just from carelessly overextending rather than doubling back to savepoints. Difficulty isn't required, but this inverted curve feels unintended.\n\n24. Shakedown: Hawaii (2019, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nWhat if Scrooge McDuck made GTA 2? Find out in this spiritual sequel to Retro City Rampage. Unlike its predecessor, which often got bogged down in half-baked homages to retro games, Shakedown: Hawaii dials back the variety in sections, meaning you're no longer playing bootleg OutRun, or Smash TV. In return however, it's able to further develop its own strengths.\n\nChief new addition is the addictive business management aspect lifted from later GTA games. Cruise around town, shake down new stores, expand your business empire through illegal means, and try duping consumers. Want to collect rent through gift cards? Upsell phone insurance by making people slip on banana peels so they drop their phones & crack their screens? Rebrand candlewax as recycled chocolate? It's all possible. The loop gets a bit repetitive (your guy gets scammed by something, tries to copy the scam, fails somehow, repeat), but the game has enough jokes to coast on.\n\n25. Teslapunk (2016, Wii U) ★★★☆☆\n\nI've come around to really liking this fairly average, entry-level bullet hell shooter, despite its subpar presentation. The art style, using pre-Space Age sci-fi blueprints is certainly unique, but occasionally veers into garish or downright ugly territory. Combined with the trolling, cringey, early noughties sense of humour, and the incohesive soundtrack (please stop using kickdrums as basslines, Eurodance producers), first impressions were bad.\n\nFortunately the gameplay is solid. The simple, precise controls, easily readable shot patterns, and genuinely welcoming novice mode make Teslapunk a good starting point for people who want to get into bullet hell games, but are scared off by DoDonpachi. Once you understand the basics, you'll find a lot of depth in stacking multipliers by firing off Bombs to cancel enemy bullets, rather than using them as defensive measures. The game encourages replays and trying different approaches through its Mission Mode. Sadly the endless Survival Mode is undercooked, feeling divorced from the Arcade Mode thanks to truncated controls, and by not contributing to the Missions. Lastly, an epilepsy warning: photosensitive people should not play this game. You can disable some flashing, but not all of it.\n\n26. Warriors Orochi 3: Hyper (2012, Wii U) ★★☆☆☆\n\nBig crossover of Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors, with other Koei-Tecmo franchises like Ninja Gaiden, Dead Or Alive, and even Bladestorm represented too. Thanks to a time travel plot, other historical characters like Joan of Arc, Hattori Hanzo, and Achilles are roped in too. The result is the epitome of a quantity over quality approach.\n\nWhy make ~120 subtly different, colourful characters, but set them in dim, dark environments you can hardly see at times? Why create almost no memorable scenarios? The Lord of the Rings games on PS2 had more unique levels. Orochi 3 feels very shallow despite containing mountains of stats to grind out. At least the framerate is mostly stable (at a cost of copious amounts of environmental and enemy pop-in), so it's smooth enough to play while listening to podcasts/audiobooks.\n\n27. Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge (2012, Wii U) ★★★☆☆\n\nMaking my first foray into modern Ninja Gaiden right after a musou game was a mistake, as mindless button mashing gets you absolutely nowhere here. It's a gleefully violent action game, demanding fast reflexes and a grasp on how to manage crowds of enemies. Visually it impresses with slick cut-scenes, buckets of blood, and detailed, varied environments. Team Ninja aren't known for their storytelling chops, and while this has the usual early 2010s shadow government conspiracy premise, it does occasionally imbue smaller scenes with some gravitas.\n\nUnfortunately it also includes the usual, embarrassing Team Ninja obsession with cleavage shots, which undercut the impact of some scenes. And while the game's levels are varied, enemy variety basically dries up half-way through. Coupled with a dearth of meaningful interactions between fights, and a lack of brevity everywhere, leaves the game feeling a bit too long in the tooth. Sometimes less is more: shortening levels by reducing the amount of fights, making fights shorter by having less opponents, and cutting everyone's health bar in half would go a long way towards making the pacing more palatable.\n\n28. One Piece: Unlimited World Red (2014, Wii U) ★☆☆☆☆\n\nDeeply disappointing how Ganbarion have slid back into licensed game hell after the flawed but ambitious Pandora's Tower. Checked this out on the merits of that game, and there are structural similarities: you leave a home base to beat up punks in bespoke levels, gain spoils, and use those for base improvement. As a non-fan, there's very little to latch onto: it feels like a greatest hits filler arc. There are obviously pre-existing relationships with various antagonists, but barring two serviceable late-game bossfights, the stakes aren't personal enough to make anything feel consequential. Characterisation seems shallow too: the women in particular are just walking cleavages for Sanji to drool over. Perhaps fans will be won over by the decent presentation (including original voice cast). There are lots of things to grind for, but unfortunately this episodic beat 'em up with boring combat doesn't make a strong enough case to warrant doing so.\n\n29. Undertale (2018, Switch) ★★☆☆☆\n\nA game I admire, but don't really like. Perhaps due to inflated expectations, I initially found the visuals quite soulless, and dismissed the humour as kooky 2010s Internet randomness. I've since come around on those early impressions: some areas feature genuinely beautiful bioluminescence, and there are tender moments behind its mask of irony. Unfortunately such interactions were too fleeting for me to connect with most characters, which are meant to be the highlights amongst its otherwise (intentionally) predictable A-plot.\n\nDespite the game's brevity, its script tested my patience with its constant interruptions, the purposefully undercutting of potentially poignant moments, and by doubling down on long-winded anti-jokes. My impatience with the writing also extends to the broader meta-structure of the game: there's a clear emphasis on (not) doing multiple runs to discover its deconstructionist underpinnings. Turns out I almost reached the pacifist ending, but would have to replay the whole game because I missed one piece of sidequesting..\n\nI expect to appreciate Undertale more in retrospect: it made me smile at times, has a varied soundtrack, and the bullet hell aspects of the combat are a personal highlight. It's also admirable how it delivers a compelling message of non-violence to a wide audience, while daring them to stray from that path and critically examine their relationship to video games.\n\n30. Return of the Obra Dinn (2019, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nA master class in designing around limitations, Obra Dinn feels action-packed despite presenting still dioramas. You move through the remains of a doomed East India Company ship and try to ascertain the fate of everyone listed in the manifest. Aided with a mysterious artifact you see the moments when people perish, but putting names to faces requires more sleuthing. Clearly this draws on pulp adventure stories which saw the Far East as exotic. There is some mild critique here (the high-ranked officers are the greedy aggressors), and it goes to lengths to represent different languages and cultures, but the story does not escape reproduction of some dated Asian mysticism tropes.\n\nIt's rewarding to trace crewmembers' movements through the timeline, but depending on how adept you are at reasoning by elimination, the game's epiphanies are quite front-loaded. You discover new information for 3 hours, but may spend another 6 to 9 re-examining the same intel. Thus, the density of new insights stretches thinner the further you become removed from the initial one-more-discovery rush. I suspect this complaint will fade with time, but in the moment the game can drag towards the end. Very impressive production relative to its budget though; lots of different voice actors were needed to condense 60 interlocking murder mysteries to a ~10 hour game.\n\n31. Hypnospace Outlaw (2020, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nHidden content\n\nYou need to reply to this thread in order to see this content.\n\n32. Call of Duty: Black Ops II (2012, Wii U) ★☆☆☆☆\n\nThe modern Call of Duties are sometimes accused of being military propaganda. However, if this is propaganda for the Special Forces, it does a spectacularly poor job of convincing us they are even remotely competent. You'd think black ops suggest unseen shadow operations, but in this campaign the average covert mission results in bombed out cities, the loss of aircraft carriers, mass civilian casualties, and hundreds of traumatised witnesses to blow the lid off these supposedly secret missions.\n\nThe incompetence extends to how most of your soldiers are nigh-incapable of basic conversations, opting instead for communication through macho grunts and one-liners. In addition, many of them have unaddressed personal vendettas which run directly counter to mission objectives: they're easily angered, often lose composure, routinely defy orders, breach protocols, and violate rules of engagement. Yes, they have neat, highly situational gadgets, but most of those are used just once and promptly forgotten. A few vehicle and stealth sections are meant to punctuate all the shooting, as does a half-baked RTS/tower defence mode which is at odds with the otherwise highly character-centric campaign.\n\nGiven the mass audience this series attracts, I was surprised by the amount of friction during the firefights: death by unseen sniper or grenade comes quick. Granted, checkpoints are generously doled out, but it does help sell the notion of chaotic battlefields where it's difficult to tell friend from foe. Unfortunately the illusion shatters once you discover the A.I. has no retort to flanking.\n\nIt's at times unclear just what Black Ops II wants to say about the world. Most non-white operatives inevitably betray you or function as dual-agents, but it wants to portray antagonist Menendez as somewhat sympathetic too. The game has some class awareness, and troops overtly comment how they're serving \"the 1%\" in a dubstep-chic nightclub. However, this realisation does not stop your dudes from mowing down poor people armed with baseball bats.\n\nIt wants to draw allusions to modern wars, even making David Petraeus a pivotal character. But I'm not sure if the loss of the U.S. drone fleet stemming from the fictional \"USS Barack Obama\" is meant to comment on that President's role in proliferating drone warfare, to paint him as incompetent, or even as a mole undermining the U.S. military. Frankly, there's some seemingly unintended irony to constantly dropping these shouting dudes into war zones, half-failing all their objectives, causing mass escalation, leaving a trace of now-homeless civilians, and accomplishing nothing but a continued need for more black ops.\n\nA charitable reading would say the game is interested in portraying shades of gray, but its unquestioned military primacy, the jumbled, contradictory storytelling, and the unexamined deferral of sweeping geopolitical decisions from the President to a single soldier reveal enormous blind spots. It's a paranoid, barely cohesive, deeply cynical vision which identifies several key symptoms of a hegemonic military industrial complex, but fails to identify root causes, because it's too busy reducing warfare to individual revenge stories.\n\n33. Umurangi Generation Special Edition (2021, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nIn a just world, this becomes known as the quintessential 2020 game. Umurangi exudes urgency, is unapologetically loud, and exists on the knife's edge between clamouring for a better future, and resigned to already eulogising the present.\n\nIt's a neon-drenched first person photography game (think Pokémon Snap but remove the rails), set to a banger Vaporwave-meets-Big Beat soundtrack. You move through mostly fairly static environments, tasked with lining up somewhat mundane pictures within an optional timer. This way you document a particularly fraught time in human existence. Palatable shots are worth money, but the world doesn't want to see everything, so keep evidence of the impending disaster out of frame if you want to get paid. The game cleverly tricks you into staging familiar photos we see from (foreign) disaster sites and war zones. It has also learned environmental storytelling from Jet Set Radio Future: graffiti, (propaganda) posters, billboards, and newspapers inform you about the world. Become too preoccupied with fulfilling the distracting goals the game sets, and you may miss the end of the world just outside of your frame. The game also takes the opportunity to teach players basic photography, shot composition, and not to photograph faces of protesters.\n\nNot everything is a success: the timer is optional, but its sheer presence still stresses me out, so I wouldn't go through levels at a slower pace until it ran out and disappeared. There's also a static, almost diorama feel to the game: it's not until the last level in the (included) Macro DLC where you truly feel like an active participant, rather than an ethereal observer like in Return of the Obra Dinn. Presumably this is due to technical limitations, which also rear their head as slowdown in 2 or 3 levels, along with the usual Switch+Unity jank of getting stuck behind objects.\n\nOverall though, a highly relevant game which doesn't shy away from wearing its Neon Genesis Evangelion influences and radical politics on its sleeve. Umurangi isn't interested in touching nerves, it wants to stomp on them. Highly recommended.\n\n34. Secret Files: Tunguska (2016, Wii U) ★★☆☆☆\n\nFirst entry in the Secret Files point & click adventure series, released on PC in 2006 and ported to everything with a touch/pointer interface. You mostly control Nina Kalenkov, in search of her missing father, an investigator of the Tunguska event. There's heaps of (occasionally stilted) voice acting of varying audio quality, and some decent cut-scenes to slightly elevate presentation to PS2 levels, at the cost of long loading times. Mercifully there's a convenient interface: it's always clear what you can interact with, Moon logic puzzles are rare (although who duct tapes phones to cats?!), and if they occur there's a full walkthrough included if you're stuck.\n\nThe game suffers a wildly uneven script: exoticism permeates throughout, and conversations flip from sarcastic observational comedy to urgent drama on a dime. It's also a classic case of men-writing-women: male NPCs routinely creep on Nina or other women, and are easily swayed by flirting. In a genre about puzzles and story, Secret Files' puzzles can't pull their weight to balance its weak story story which struggles to hold an unremarkable pulp thriller together.\n\n35. Firewatch (2018, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nTells the story of two fire lookouts overseeing some hiking trails during a dry 1989 Summer. Most of the job boils down to doing occasional maintenance, and reporting any observed smoke plumes. Meanwhile, characters chat about their lives over walkie-talkies, which lets the game lean heavily on its strongest aspects: the selectable dialogue and natural voice acting. There are some mystery elements which feel tense in the moment, but this is primarily a game about avoiding problems by seeking out new ones.\n\nThe actual wilderness exploration feels a bit railroaded, with (in)visible walls funneling you down routes. You'll get lost without learning to navigate using a mixture of map, compass, and memorisation. Environments are nicely stylised, and survive the somewhat rickety, frequently stuttering Switch port job. A strong ending wraps up most of its themes nicely.\n\n36. Triggerheart Exelica (2008, X360) ★★★☆☆\n\nPort of an expensive Sega Naomi/DreamCast vertical shooter to XBLA. Not very interesting besides its central harpoon idea, which lets you grab incoming foes, and fling them into incoming fire and/or other enemies. It's a neat idea, heavily contributing to score through bonuses for swinging heavier ships around, and ploughing your way through heavy incoming fire. Unfortunately there's not enough variety to the types of swings you'll be doing, which leaves it feeling gimmicky.\n\nThe game does clean up nicely in HD, and has a decent soundtrack accompanying its otherwise bog-standard mecha anime premise. I think this is a decent introduction into bullet hell, but quickly lost interest after a few replays.\n\n37. Rayman Legends (2013, Wii U) ★★★☆☆\n\nVisual stunner built in the curiously underutilised UbiArts framework. Legends is a good-to-great 2D platformer, with a better balanced difficulty curve, and more varied levels than its predecessor Rayman Origins. Sometimes you guide AI characters by influencing level elements with the touchscreen, other times you're using the gyroscope to rotate stages, and there are even stealth sections now. The Bit.Trip Runner2-esque music stages in particular are a sight to behold, although Rayman doesn't auto-run.\n\nUnfortunately the glue keeping these varied stages together feels less convincing than in the previous game, now that you enter levels through portraits in a hallway, rather than progressing on a world map. The plot is similarly undercooked, and suffers from a poorly defined antagonist: the story provides little motivation to clear stages beyond years of gaming having trained you to complete levels. Origins had a simple hook too, but felt more cohesive.\n\nAs a sequel released just 2 years later, the amount of content here is impressive: 50+ new stages, tons of characters and creatures to collect, and 40 levels of the previous game return for those who missed out. I'm not a fan of all new modes however: there are weekly and even daily challenges now (which still keep ~300ish people occupied daily) to imbue live-service elements into the game. Furthermore, creatures, and stages from Origins are exclusively unlocked through virtual scratch-off tickets.\n\nWithout meaning to sound pearl-clutching, I'm noticing a push towards randomised rewards, and incentives for daily play, even in Ubisoft's more child-friendly games (see also: Just Dance's gumball machine). Granted, Rayman has no microtransactions or paid lootboxes, and you can ignore all these elements, but it feels like a foundation for daily (habitual) play, and gambling-adjacent reward systems is being pushed in a game rated age 10 and up. Nowadays I'm more skeptical of the motivations behind such inclusions than I was 8 years ago.\n\n38. Resident Evil: Revelations (2013, Wii U) ★★☆☆☆\n\nAn action game dressed in horror attire in effort to mask how limited your interactions with it truly are. Yes, you do a bit more than shooting zombies, but puzzles and exploration are absolutely trivial, and the game has nothing to reward you with besides guns and bullets. Revelations is at its best when exploring the Queen Zenobia, a rudderless cruise ship, which allows for swaying, slanted camera angles, and metallic noises to induce unease. Anytime the game leaves her narrow enclosures however, all tension disappears while the plot rushes to elevate the stakes way beyond what the story can support.\n\nThe short episodic structure allows for decent pacing, but the game is highly reliant on fake-outs and predictable twists. Besides Jill there's a dearth of likable characters, and the shallow villainous motivations make the whole thing feel perfunctory.\n\nThe game gets more exciting in the last third, thanks to a series of escalating events and the jettisoning of the uninteresting C- and D-plots. But it never manages to be scary or tell a joke, and its attempts at flirty banter wind up feeling creepy in the context of a game with lecherous camera angles ogling its protagonist, and jokes about following women home.\n\n39. Cosmic Express (2021, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nPort of a cute 2017 puzzle game which sees you assembling railroads inside little space stations. The various alien passengers check their phones with their eight eyes while waiting, or will not want to ride in carriages previously used by slimy aliens. Rails can't cross over/under themselves, but later it introduces crossroads, and even portals. A nice touch is how some levels have multiple exits to unlock different levels on the map, but this isn't maintained throughout - sometimes one exit will just unlock two levels, which is a bummer.\n\nThe difficulty resets at the start of every zone, so if you diligently complete zones in order you'll occasionally snap from a very hard to a very easy level when starting the next zone. In general I had a lot of trouble towards the end and looked a bunch of late level solutions up, but suspect that might just be my own ineptitude. Overall a cute execution of a strong concept, and a surprising amount of levels for its low price.\n\n40. Mushihimesama (2021, Switch) ★★★★★\n\nEvery millisecond feels deliberately balanced in this Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind inspired shoot-em-up. You control a beetle-riding Bug Princess who wants to rid the forest of corrupting pollution which is turning insects hostile. A seemingly effortlessly paced ballet of bullets follows: stages 1 and 5 mirror their enemy placement, stages 2 and 4 both emphasise weaving patterns to anticipate incoming foes, and stage 3 is a unique inflection point. Enemies announce their impending arrival by scuttling in from the sides, below, or by casting shadows from above - you're never surprised by sudden incoming foes. Bright pink incoming fire ensures legibility, which in turns eases memorisation of sections.\n\nMushihimesama has the reputation of an absurd bullet hell thanks to videos of its Ultra difficulty mode, but I don't think it's entirely warranted. All 4 versions of the game included in this compilation (including a special Novice version) come with 3 difficulty modes, continues are infinite, and the harder Arrange and V1.5 versions let you slip through tinier gaps between shot patterns. It's not a perfect release, with some wonky translations, and an unwieldy menu interface. But this is the type of light-touch, expertly measured action which can easily induce a trance/flow state, sitting closer to Tetris than Raiden.\n\n41. Carrion (2020, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nHorror game where you play the monster: in this case a crimson amorphous blob of condensed rage looking to escape the facility it was created in. With obvious allusions to films like The Blob and The Thing, it's most successful in the visual and audio design. Your monster spreads its tendrils across the facilities, staining the pixel art surroundings in blood, tentacles and slime. Meanwhile the sound effects present your movements alongside sloshing noises, and sell the body horror with enough blood-curdling screams and crunches. A fitting, classic sci-fi soundtrack with swelling synths and pulsing noises is another highlight in the presentation.\n\nPraise aside, I think the game fails to escalate in the last third: cutting the entire Bunker area might have led to tighter pacing and lets the game end in a nuclear power plant, which feels like a more high-stakes environment anyway. While it's a joy to steer the monster through areas and wreck everything in its path, or stealthily pick off squads of soldiers one by one through the air ducts, repetition did set in for me. Good game to start Shocktober with though!\n\n42. Metroid Dread (2021, Switch) ★★★★★\n\nNot the most original entry in the series (in some ways even the maligned Other M introduced more fresh ideas), but a sublime display as to why this formula remains compelling. Dread does so much right, it reduces all my complaints to nitpicks. Yes, early on the pacing feels slow, only to ramp up and pump the brakes again mid-way through for 2 back-to-back slow sections with water and stealth. Yes, it's a bummer you can't remap controls. Yes, environments look too clean, and the music is less bombastic than Metroid often gets. No, it's never scary because the chasing EMMI are neatly contained to zones they never leave.\n\nBut all these points feel minor compared to how fantastic Samus controls. She hasn't felt this powerful since the end of Super Metroid, and yet the game delivers multiple memorable, challenging bossfights. Environments are recontextualised as you loop back around, and you're cleverly boxed into the critical path without making the world feel cramped like in Fusion. Rounding this all out are high production values, great cut-scenes, adrenaline filled sequences, and a very strong finale. As someone who liked, but didn't love Samus Returns, I was worried the team at Mercury Steam would have a difficult time scaling up for this project. They've proven me absolutely wrong: Dread earns its place in the upper echelons of the series.\n\n43. GleyLancer a.k.a. Advanced Busterhawk GleyLancer (1992/2021, Switch) ★★☆☆☆\n\nBog-standard horizontal shoot 'em up, mostly notable as a long-time Japan-only release. With wide open landscapes, a welcoming difficulty, and few innovations besides adjustable turret aiming, it feels like a decent entry level shmup. This one clearly aimed to sell on presentation values primarily: terrific box art, some voice samples, a clean soundtrack without the usual Genesis scratchiness, and cut-scenes between stages like in Image Fight II.\n\nUnfortunately the cut-scenes feel like a detriment through modern eyes, as they slow an already too long game (11 stages!) further down and have nothing to add but cookie cutter shonen anime tropes.\n\n44. SturmFront: The Mutant War (Übel Edition) (2021, Wii U) ★★★☆☆\n\nLate port of this twin stick shooter to Wii U. You play an Arnold type 80s action anti-hero, and run through 11 Ikari Warriors style demon-infested stages. Nothing revolutionary, but there are a few okay bossfights. It tries to combine DOOM's splatter violence with jokes at times, but almost nothing lands. The writing is simultaneously eye-rollingly toothless, as it is overly crass: one of the cities is casually referred to as Earth's forced brothel for the mutant demons - an entirely superfluous aside implying mass rape just thrown out there. This unexamined misogyny, combined with some Nazi-adjacent terminology, and the Black Metal style nicknames the developers give themselves in the credits lends the project an uneasy feel. I'm going to assume satirical intent, but the sheer fact I'm uncertain already indicates the satire wasn't executed very well.\n\n45. Sagaia GB (1991/2021, Switch) ★★☆☆☆\n\nApparently fairly sought-after version of Darius II for the original Gameboy. It's a serviceable, if entirely forgettable little shooter. The slow procession through 8 horizontal stages gets dull once it runs out of new enemies by the mid-point, and resorts to reusing enemies, patterns, and even cycling in previous bosses as mid-bosses. Luckily every stage has a unique, detailed, ocean-themed boss of its own, which you tear apart slowly. Probably one of the better Gameboy shmups (no slowdown or shimmering sprites), but admittedly that's a low bar to clear.\n\n46. G-Darius HD (1997/2021, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nAn interesting look at where shoot-em-ups could have gone, had their popularity scaled up alongside the push for higher production values. The early polygonal style meshes quite well with the eclectic music selection, and cleans up nicely in HD. There's a real emphasis on stretching value-for-money, so levels and bosses are all way too long, and feature multiple routes (even within stages) to prolong playtime. The mechanic from Darius Gaiden which let you capture mid-bosses returns, but this time you can capture almost any enemy and let them fight for you, or serve as shields for incoming fire. Unfortunately the difficulty is absurdly high, to the point of detriment since it feels intended purely to milk quarters in the arcade and/or prolong playtime of the home console release.\n\n47. Dariusburst: Another Chronicle EX+ (2021, Switch) ★★☆☆☆\n\nAt least the sixth iteration on 2009's Dariusburst, with this one built on top of the arcade version's foundation. The result is a poor fit for Switch Lite: while the 3-stage sessions are perfect for short play, the 32:9 aspect ratio is comically miniscule on the console's screen. A baffling decision since Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours already exists in 16:9 and is a more recent release, too. Furthermore, if you're on the go without Internet access, the game keeps begging for a Wi-fi connection since much of its appeal is rooted in setting high scores with other players.\n\nIf you get over these humps there's an absolute avalanche of content here: dozens of stages and bosses which further fan out into hundreds of very slightly differently assembled challenges. The game looks shiny (albeit deeply generic outside of bosses) and has a really varied soundtrack, ranging from ethereal vocals to literal circus tunes. Unfortunately, presentation and volume of content are its primary assets, but the core methods of interaction never really grabbed me.\n\nIt flirts with bullet hell trappings, but rarely gives you the firepower needed to respond in kind. Bosses don't seem to care at all where you are: if you die they'll keep firing at nothing, and if you hide behind them they'll fire their giant beam attacks forwards anyway. The game could sell this as them being giant monsters who don't even register your existence, but the level design makes zero attempt at storytelling to explain what they're up to if not trying to block the player's progress.\n\nPerhaps this experience works better in arcades, and I'll concede I played this in sub-optimal conditions on the smallest screen with the least Wi-fi. If you love Dariusburst, this is a basically endless source for more. But after trying 4 Darius games and loving none, I think I have to conclude the series just is not for me.\n\n48. R-Type (1987/1989, TG-16 Mini) ★★★★☆\n\nVery impressive horizontal shooter for its time. An ominous soundtrack compliments the dripping H.R. Giger art style, and your weapons feel excellent. This blows Gradius out of the water, despite having the same punishing loss of power-ups upon death. R-Type isn't just mercilessly difficult; this game hates its players. I used savestates to keep up. Stage 6 in particular is a meat grinder and has an extra boss in this port. This and other bosses start relying on tricks to beat them, which I've never been a fan of. Deserves its reputation, but my God, this might be the hardest game I've played in years.\n\n49. R-Type Dimensions EX (2018, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nAn upcycled X360 dual release of the first two R-Type games. It lets you toggle between original art & music, and a glossy paintjob with trance remixes. The new style is a poor fit at times: the music is too upbeat, incoming shots can blend into the background, and some enemies lose a lot of menace or look outright goofy in this plastic sheen.\n\nThis was my first time playing R-Type II, and it's really impressive for 1989. Controls are great, it attempts some cinematic flair, and the shorter overall lengths makes it less of a gauntlet despite some wildly difficult bosses.\n\nThe real reasons to get this are the co-op mode, or as an easier introduction into these deviously hard games. You can induce slowdown at will which greatly helps, and the Infinite Mode removes the checkpoints upon death in favour of endless instant respawns. It's a fairly basic package altogether, but these games remain eminently playable. I wish I'd played this first, instead of bashing my head against the wall of R-Type I for a week.\n\n50. R-Type Final 2 (2021, Switch) ★★★★☆\n\nA giantess awakens from her 17 year slumber. During her hibernation, the space shooter genre receded to smaller developers, and niche audiences. Smaller hitboxes, higher movement speeds, instant respawns, and bullet hell became the norm. R-Type Final 2 rejects these developments and remains focused on painstaking memorisation. Your hitbox is massive, death sets you back to a checkpoint, there are power-ups, and you will lose them often.\n\nOlder design sensibilities are fine, but being explicit about hitbox size should be a QOL feature at this point. Other decisions also impede your precision at times: Stage 3 has a slowly swaying camera, which affects your ship's position. I've definitely crashed into the boss because the camera slightly shifted, which is frustrating, because it injects unpredictability into a game about repetition.\n\nWhere Final 2 chiefly impresses, is in its presentation and amount of content. The shiny, metallic look set to a trance soundtrack is a departure from the organic, Alien-inspired biomes, and does cost the series some sense of identity, but looks slick in isolation. The series' emphasis on replaying is better justified with 11 stages divided over 3 branching paths, 7 difficulty levels, dozens of unlockable customisable ships, and loads of varied enemies. Despite all their variety though, several bosses are just boring machines which don't even have the decency to perish in spectacular fashion. Another bummer is when all those enemies appear in clusters, it can cause slowdown on Switch, particularly in Stage 7.1.\n\nOverall this is a welcome return, but it's an acquired taste, and its best levels are weirdly all back-loaded. At its best moments the game manages environmental storytelling (Stage 7.0's implies hundreds of failed previous missions, while 7.1 envisions a dark future), which clearly set it a cut above the genre competition. To get there however, you'll encounter some nasty difficulty spikes which force you to play on the game's terms.\n\nUnfortunately few shmups receive this level of production values nowadays (only Resogun comes close), so I wonder if I'm being too generous and mistaking a snack for a feast here. But once I got over the hump and could reliably clear the lesser first three stages, the game began to come alive for me.\n\n51. R-Type Final 2: Stage Pass 1 (2021, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nDespite rejecting much of modernity, R-Type Final 2 cannot withstand the siren song of live services (and recurrent user spending). Thus, here we are: the first Stage Pass (another of which is planned). Containing 3 sets of DLC, this is basically a collection of 7 stages from past franchise entries, remade in the Final 2 framework, and with new musical renditions of past songs.\n\nIt runs the gamut, remaking iconic stages from the first R-Type (truncated versions of both \"Encounter\", and the battleship are here), the absurdly difficult factory chase from R-Type II, a fire corridor from R-Type III: The Third Lightning (I hate the boss in this one), the ruins from R-Type Leo, an impressive city level from R-Type Delta, and even the marsh from the first R-Type Final on PS2. The selection includes a few too many cramped corridors with moving stage hazards, but feels like an appropriate vertical slice of almost the entire series.\n\nBy pulling from all these sources, going forward the game can cement itself as a unified platform for the franchise. All the disparate art styles and musical directions are realigned under the Final 2 umbrella. In some ways that's disappointing, since the cleaner look with trance music continues the shift away from the dark H.R. Giger influences, and papers over the rich series history by homogenising everything.\n\nAnother worrying sign is the technical performance on Switch. I was pretty forgiving of the base game, but Stage X5 in particular routinely chugs at every difficulty level. This package is meant to keep getting updates over months or years, and already the Switch version is pushing up against its technical ceiling. However, with market realities being what they are, perhaps this live service model will prove to be the silver bullet solution to keeping space shooters viable without sacrificing on production values, unlockables, or features.\n\n52. Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories (2019/2020, Switch) ★☆☆☆☆\n\nA bit of a cursed game about definitely-not-Tokyo getting hit by a major earthquake. Once intended for PS3, it was cancelled after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake & tsunami, but finished under a new publisher. The end result is a baffling hodgepodge of never-coalescing ideas ranging from compelling to terrible, and frequently displaying that range back-to-back.\n\nFundamentally this is an adventure/survival game: you traipse around stricken disaster zones, help people in need, and haul items from A to B. It stumbles right out the gate however: early on you're really lacking in any sort of guidance, resulting in the typical adventure game annoyance of talking to everyone just to see what will advance the plot. The survival aspects are similarly aimless. Yes, you can go hungry, thirsty, or need the bathroom, but you'll never soil yourself or starve. There are zero consequences for ignoring most of the survival mechanics besides idle animations indicating discomfort. Another system left lying fallow is the binary morality system, which is unpredictable and inconsistently applied, and appears to inadvertently argue against rigid binary morality.\n\nIts directionless handling of interactions feels congruent with its meandering script, which is what truly sinks the game. It's a fairly simple string of scenarios, but the tone varies wildly: one second you're handing toilet paper to a particularly gassy bathroom stall occupant, the next second the game is drowning a mother and child in front of you.\n\nWithin 10 minutes you'll go from getting recruited into a cult led by a creepy Waluigi lookalike, to taking his position as new cult leader (at which point you can \"pray for the world\" for an easy +100 morality points). This comedic(?) interlude segues immediately into a refugee camp, where a foreigner gets stoned to death by racists.\n\nSimilar whiplash-inducing shifts happen constantly: one minute you deliver flowers to commemorate perished orphans, the next a Hitler-moustached landlord comes stomp on the bouquet. Sometimes the game cuts to moody, minutes-long montages set to Japanese ballads, but instantly ruins them by letting your character wear some absurd outfit.\n\nIt is perhaps admirable how Disaster Report 4 wants to speak on heavy topics, but the game lacks the ability to approach such topics tactfully. Bullying resulting in attempted suicide is repeatedly brought up, but the game won't let you intervene or even empathise much with the victim. Racism is present throughout: in the refugee camp, but also in a Romeo & Juliet pastiche set in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nThere are multiple allusions and threats of sexual violence, and later on an outright rape occurs while your character stops to exchange restaurant ownership papers next door. Most of its attempts to speak on gender issues fall flat, since it feels like the script was written for a male protagonist, with the female option existing mostly as an alternative costume. It's especially noticeable in the pick-up lines you can choose to flirt with other women, and the fact your female avatar can use urinals, but not bathroom stalls in the men's room.\n\nThe scenarios almost never connect beyond appealing to your base empathy for victims of all kinds of injustices. Ostensibly the game wants to explore how people respond differently to disasters: when does cooperation occur? When do people make selfish choices and exploit others at their weakest? Heady questions it can never answer thanks to a cast of cartoonishly flat caricatures of people.\n\nAt times it feels like the tropey characters must have been a conscious choice, since the game frequently pelts rocks at the fourth wall. If a character passes away you can \"mourn their absence in the sequel\". NPCs will scoff at billboards for Disaster Report 4 within the game, noting it'll \"probably never come out\". I sold fake mysterious water to a mayor and in return he renamed the game to Disaster Report 5 for me. None of these metatextual musings amount to anything: they only highlight the unnatural and awkward character interactions in this supposedly grounded setting, at the cost of taking you even further out of the story.\n\nNone of this is even mentioning the technical issues either. I had to reload previous saves multiple times because events wouldn't trigger as intended. Controls are stiff across the board, particularly in vehicle sections. The PS2 era camera cannot handle interior spaces, and crowded exteriors tank the frame rate to slideshow speeds. (Granted, you rarely need quick reflexes, and the pacing is glacial even at a consistent frame rate.)\n\nDisaster Report 4 is an astounding game. It's too self-aware to earn comparisons to The Room or contend with some of the all-time worst games, and I do appreciate the earnest attempts at storytelling (despite poor results). But woof, if you plan to play this, set your expectations at janky PSP import levels, and prepare to still be disappointed.\n\n53. Tetris Effect: Connected (2021, Switch) ★★★☆☆\n\nA lot of the chatter on this game makes it sound transcendental, or a good approximation of synesthesia. Presumably those elements are more pronounced in VR or on a big screen, but in handheld format a lot of the pizzazz feels muted. Yes, it's still an exceedingly competent version of Tetris, but the visual flair and soothing soundtrack, while stylish, never really transported me out of this world. It would probably help if the Journey mode could be played without interruptions by score menus.\n\nI'm a bit jealous of the experience others appear to be having with this game, so I hope to try it on a different platform one day.\n\n54. Super Toy Cars (2014, Wii U) ★★☆☆☆\n\nAs they say: don't judge a book by its cover. This looks like cheap shovelware, but is an okay little kart racer. It aims for the feeling of small toy cars racing through courses built in a kid's bedroom, and succeeds fairly well at it. It's a little janky, particular when you get stuck in walls or obstacles, menus are a little soulless, and its career mode lacks a strong ending while simultaneously highlighting the limited amount of tracks. But there are things to like here, particularly the time trials, the Micro Machines camera option, and the surprisingly solid track editor which uses the Wii U Gamepad. Sadly tracks can't be shared online, but for a budget title this still punches well above it weight.\n\n55. Mario Party 10 (2015, Wii U) ★★☆☆☆\n\nEverything feels slow in this game, despite their efforts to streamline the affair. Piling the players into a single train cuts down waiting times and keeps everyone moving, but make your dice rolls feel less impactful (outside of rare instances where you try to game the rolls to screw someone else over). Mini-games are easier to understand than ever, but are no longer guaranteed to occur every round. There's not enough different random occurrences, animation cycles, and vocals on the soundboard to avoid repetition quickly setting in. Combined with the cheap, slow music, and the lack of an announcer injecting some much-needed punch to ostensibly pivotal moments, few moments have some weight to them.\n\nIt's not all bad: keeping players on the same square allows for 4-on-1 boss fights, there's a nice board or two, and newcomer Spike is surprisingly cute. The asynchronous Bowser Mode, which pits the Gamepad player against the rest cleverly leverages the Wii U hardware, and would be the game's highlight if its mini-game pool had more than 10 entries. In the end though, it's still up to your couch of players to pick up the slack and provide laughs whenever the game is failing too.\n\nTotal: 55!\n\nLet's Go! 2021 CHALLENGE STATUS: 30/52\n\nGames Completed\n\n1. Mega Man 5\n\nPlatform: Nintendo Switch (via Mega Man Legacy Collection)\n\nAs far as I know people don't really care much about Mega Man 4 through 6, but I was honestly surprised when playing 5: it tries really hard to make some memorable mechanics in stages, and since I played 1 through 4 in a Week, it is really hard to ignore how smoother the games play (both in performance and in general gameplay and level design polish). However, those games are pretty much the same anyway, which is why I'm excited to get to the Non-NES Mega Man games ASAP.\n\n2. Moss\n\nPlatform: PC (playing with HTC Vive)\n\nVery, very refreshing to play a non-first person VR game. Controlling the main character in the diorama-like stages is super charming, and even though the puzzles are simple, in the end it is a really confortable, cozy game to play. Not sure if I need to blame the game or the Vive controller (which has a trackpad instead of a proper analogue stick) , but my main frustration with the game is that the jump is super imprecise, which is a bummer since it is your main action aside from walking. I fell off the stages several times just because the game required more precision of my Jump than I could perform. I must confess that I disliked how much story exposition there is, specially considering that the game does not conclude it's own story and promises to continue it in a (stil unnanounced) sequel.\n\n3. Psychonauts\n\nPlatform: PC\n\nI wasn't expecting to like a 2005 game so much. I usually lower my expectations for older games, but Psychonauts is ageing astonishingly well. Excelent 3D platform game. I'm also not someone who cares much for stories in videogames, but somehow this game made me care a lot about the characters and what was going on with them. The game is a bit slow at first, but I think this is one of the rare examples where a game keeps getting better the more you play it. Can't recommend it enough. I never thought I would be hyped for the sequel of a game that was sitting in my backlog for almost a decade.\n\n4. Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin\n\nPlatform: PC (playing with HTC Vive)\n\nAmazing! Was expecting a simple Psychonauts themed half-hour experience, and it ended up almost looking like a missing chapter from the first game! Of course, it is not a platformer or anything, but mechanics, characters and exciting story are all there. So glad I made myself play the first game before this, otherwise I wound't have enjoyed it as much. Brilliant use of sitting-VR (specially considering it does not use motion controls). Couldn't be happier with it.\n\n5. Doc Louis's Punch-out!!\n\nPlatform: Wii\n\nSince there was this sudden disappearing of DSi games from the eShop this week, I got myself thinking about all those download only exclusive games in my consoles, and that's when I remembered about this game, which I was so happy for getting on Club Nintendo but never played throughly. Very fun! This stand-alone DLC reminded me why I liked the Punch-out!! Wii so much. Kudos for the possibility of punching Doc's chocolate bar out of his hand and everything that happens after this. I laughed so hard when that happened, hahaha!\n\n6. Half-Life 2\n\nPlatform: PC\n\nStarted the game last year, but dropped after the first unnecessarily long vehicle sequence. Picked up again and almost dropped at a second unnecessarily long vehicle sequence. Aside from that, great game, great shooter, and cool story. Every chapter it is trying to do something different, and I love it. Aside from 3 or 4 chapters, the gameplay and story are smooth as using a hot knife in a piece of butter. The original Half-Life now is something that people might enjoy only for historical curiosity, but HL2 is ageing very well.\n\n7. Half-Life 2: Episode 1\n\nPlatform: PC\n\nThe middle chapter kinda drags out a little bit, but aside from that, really enjoyed the game. Even without new proper mechanics/tools for the player, they managed to make something really fresh and enjoyable. In the future I might play it again with the Developer Commentary mode, in order to learn more about how it was made. Tested it for 10 minutes and it was super interesting!\n\n8. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast\n\nPlatform: PC\n\nIt turns out it IS just a tech demo. I heard someone saying that there was some story in it, but it is actually not true. Bummer. Oh well, for a single level, it is pretty fun.\n\n9. Half-Life 2: Episode 2\n\nPlatform: PC\n\nThe perfect Half-Life game for me. I really enjoyed the series, but the main games are bit longer than what I usually wanted to play them, which is why I enjoyed playing the episodes/side-stories more. These, on the other hand, never amazed me regarding gameplay or story. But Episode 2 combines both: great gameplay, great story, everything mixed in a short lenght game. However, damn, the cliff-hanger in this game is insane. What a terrible way to send the series to a decade long hiatus, haha!\n\n10. WarioWare Gold\n\nPlatform: 3DS\n\nBeing basically a retrospective of the whole series, I was surprised to be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the game is excellent, but I played every single other entry in the series (even Wii U and DSi), and, because of that, the Surprise Factor is basically gone, which I something I value a lot. The humor is always amazing, but knowing it beforehand obviously weakens the experience. I would guess that 1/5 of the games are original (or at least it was modified to the point that I didn't remember it anymore), but still. Either way, some microgames are gourgously remastered and tweaked, and the Toy Section looks bigger than ever. I heard that somewhere in this game they even ported the GAMER mode from the Wii U, so I'll definitely search for it right now.\n\n11. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker\n\nPlatform: Switch\n\nEven though I have just beaten the game, it is one of those very, very rare instances where I want to make 100%, so I don't think I'll be putting down anytime soon. I played the original game on Wii U, and I'm now playing on the Switch. My main motivation was just to try the extra content + DLC, but I ended up playing the whole game again. This game is Nintendo magic in its raw form, can't recommend it enough. I think it is fair to register the extra content (Odyssey stages + VR + DLC) in a separete entry, and that's what I'll be playing after 100% the rest of the content.\n\n12. The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages\n\nPlatform: 3DS\n\nStarted playing this because there was a small chance that Nintendo announces a remake of this in the same Link's Awakening engine. I didn't want to admit that I wasted money buying this on 3DS, so I was kinda trying to finish it before the series 35th anniversary. :P This game has the same issues as Link's Awakening (managing items is cumbersome, screens are too small, etc.), but I really, really enjoyed it. Very fun to play, dungeon design is amazing. Really curious to link it to Oracle of Seasons and finish the proper story.\n\n13. Panzer Dragoon Remake\n\nPlatform: Switch\n\nCan't say I liked this game, really. I mean, I really, really love the multi-lock-on system, but nothing else on the gameplay stands out. Shooting things feel like doesn't have any impact. The games levels aren't particularly fun either. Definitely not bad, but nothing near great either.\n\n14. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker - VR Stages + Special Episode DLC\n\nPlatform: Switch\n\nRegarding the VR stages, the Captain Toad concept fits perfectly. Too bad those stages aren't new, but nevertheless, the concept of playing a third person game in a diorama-like world works super well. As for the DLC, very cool stages, both the originals and the remixes. Super hard too!\n\n15. Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land\n\nPlatform: 3DS\n\nI'm pretty disappointed with this game, honestly. It is all about collecting coins, but there aren't much to collect on stages, and the fact that enemies drop coins only if you shoulder-dash them is a pretty weird choice because it limits the way you challenge enemies on the level. Based on other Wario Land games I played, this looks almost like a lost link between the Mario gameplay and Wario Land gameplay. I'm sure I'm going to enjoy the other entries better.\n\n16: Half-Life: Alyx\n\nPlatform: PC (playing with HTC Vive)\n\nDaaaaamn, by far the best VR experience on the market. The new combat system is amazing. Setting up your weapons using your hands is much more fun than what I was remotely expecting. And also, surprised how it actually is an amazing Half-Life game as well. Even though it is a prequel, wasn't expecting to like the ending so much.\n\n17. Bowser's Fury\n\nPlatform: Switch\n\nAt first, I was not 100% ok with the game: Bowser was more of an inconvenient than something cool to amp up the difficulty, and taking the wrong jump in a level always meant that you would fall on the water, so it took quite sometime to go back at the start of the level. But, after while, the frequency of Bowser changes, and stages no more are above water, and then the game sky rockets in quality. Really, really liked it. Hoping the next installment is at least an expanded version of this. :)\n\n18. 1943: Battle of Midway\n\nPlatform: Switch (via Capcom Arcade Stadium)\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is amazing. Loved the power-up system, fighting against vertical warships, etc. However, I was expecting a short yet varied game. What I got, however, are 4 stages worth of content spread through 16 stages of pure repetition. In the end, I had a positive experience with the game, and now I'm curious enough to play the rest of the series. Also, it is a freebie. And I'm now totally in on buying more games in the Capcom Arcade Stadium. :)\n\n19. Donkey Kong Country\n\nPlatform: Switch (via SNES Switch Online)\n\nNot the first time I have played it. My main motivation to replay it was because I just realized that I have never beaten the Donkey Kong Country games. In order to properly see what makes the second and third ones stand out, I thought it would be fun to revisit this one. It is a very well polished game. Amazing how something so experimental at the time (3D pre-rendered graphics, DK redesign, etc.) is amazing on every aspect (level design, soundtrack, etc.).\n\n20. Gnosia\n\nPlatform: Switch\n\nSomething in this game clicked with me since it was announced, to the point that I even pre-ordered it, something I don't usually do. When I started playing, was disappointed that it was not the 999-like I was expecting, since it is not exactly a standard visual novel. However, it is one of the best games I played in a while. The ending is a bit underwhelming since you gather so much info during the game and it is basically not used on anything but, aside from that, it has been years since I so strongly hooked to a game. Just an amazing game, everyone should play this.\n\n21. Time Crisis 4\n\nPlatform: PS3 (via Time Crisis: Razing Storm)\n\nThis game has some cheap-shots that I consider a bit unfair, since it is really hard to avoid without replaying the game several times. Aside from that, great game. Works super well with the PS Move, the gameplay itself feels really, really good, and had a good laugh with the over-the-top story. I'm now excited to play the other games available in the collection and, also a bit saddened that there is almost no games like that in the last generation and I don't see this changing for the current generation as well.\n\n22. SUPERHOT\n\nPlatform: PC\n\nIt is not that the game is bad, but so far it is my biggest disappointment this year. Loved the original gamejam version, and in general I really like the gameplay, but I have three issues with the game: 1) I tend to prefer shorter games, but I'll definitely say that in this case this is a problem: I was still very hungry for playing more of this concept at the end. The game spends too much of its 2h lenght with story exposition. 2) I honestly felt that the story was pretty cringe, and 3) I have some issues with the gameplay, even though I consider the gameplay itself great. Your own hitbox is not always clear; and in general I believe that, since the enemies spawn out of nowhere for no clear reason, I have no clear way to view my progress on the stage, which usually led to me thinking that there were still enemies in the room, and then \"oh, that was the last one. Ok.\".\n\n23. SUPERHOT VR\n\nPlatform: PC (via HTC Vive)\n\nEveryone with a VR headset should play this, although I'm not fan of the high difficulty. I get that by being forced to play all the mini-levels every time you die eventually makes you flow through them in spectacular ways, but I died way too many times to the point that I felt frustrated here and there. But the story exposition is very light (which I believe it is a good thing) and the game in general feels amazingly good to play. Dodging bullets, picking guns in the air. Very very nice.\n\n24. X-BLAZE: Code Embryo\n\nPlatform: Playstation Vita\n\nThat's a visual novel prequel to the Blazblue series (happening 150 years befor the games). I never played BB before, I purchased this because 1) It was super cheap on the Vita, and 2) It does a few cool things regarding sprite position on screen, which, with the full-voice over dialogue, make this feel less like a standard VN and more like a static anime, which I thought was really cool. The game itself is a bit underwhelming: very slow paced with a bit shallow characters, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Might even go get the sequel to it.\n\n25. Echochrome\n\nPlatform: PS3\n\nFantastic game. People draw the comparison with Monument Valley, but in Echochrome, you have a lot o freedom on how to tackle the challenges, which I loved: there was not a single level that didn't make me feel smart by finishing it. At the end of the game I was a bit tired of it but, considering that no new mechanics are presented during the whole experience, I consider this a great achievement. Wanna try Echochrome 2 now, that took a different direction.\n\n26. Malicious Rebirth\n\nPlatform: Vita\n\nAlthough there are some performance issues that are hard to ignore, I actually liked this game a lot! It is basically boss-rush game with a little bit of Musou, and I don't think I have played anything similar before. It has really cool moves and upgrades, and a perfect lenght (just shy of 7 hours for me). Something funny is that this is a re-release of a PS3 game with twice the content. And there is also a PS4 version with even more content. Might get PS4 version in the future. :)\n\n27. WILL: A Wonderful World\n\nPlatform: Switch\n\nEven though it is not a traditional visual novel, I recommend this game to everyone that enjoys the genre. I was playing it half-hour everyday before sleep, so I know I'll miss it. One cool thing worth mentioning is that it this is a chinese game: I don't have a great eye to differentiate between chinese and japanese anime-style art, but it was really easy to spot differences regarding the story themes and cultural differences (also, most of the game happens in China and Korea), so that is something that felt really fresh to me.\n\n28. Takeshi & Hiroshi\n\nPlatform: iPhone (via Apple Arcade)\n\nI'm in love with this game. As a Game Designer myself, I can't help but enjoy a lot about the main character and his development through the story. I would already be super satisfied with the game if it was just a short movie, but I actually really enjoy the spawning-monster mechanic. It is super simple, but I think that it was super effective here considering the short lenght of the game. Definitely recommend it. :)\n\n29. The Cave\n\nPlatform: PC\n\nI really enjoyed the puzzle side of the game. However, the experience was undermined by weird decisions on the 2D platformer aspect. It is fair for this kind of experience to have backtracking, but the levels are enormous, stairs are kind of a drag to use, and characters have fall damage. All those aspects make the puzzle solving less enjoyable, since exploring the game is kinda cumbersome. But again, the puzzle solving is great, and the writing is spot-on, had good laughts here and there.\n\n30. Tangle Tower\n\nPlatform: iPhone (via Apple Arcade)\n\nThe game is really fun, dialogue is great, super charming but... the ending is super unsatisfying, to the point that it kinda ruins the experience a little bit. One of the main drivers for me to play a detective game is to solve every little mystery, and, even though here the main mystery is solved, there are way too many loose ends in the story to feel that I actually accomplished something. Found out that the Devs are working on sequel (a direct sequel as far as I know), but to start the game without knowing that things wouldn't be completely solved is kind of a bummer. If i knew it beforehand, I wouldn't be so disappointed when I reached the end.\n\n31. Chrono Trigger\n\nPlatform: PS Vita (via PS1 Classics)\n\nI'll never forgive myself for not playing this game before. Its just so good! There is that Dragon Quest-esque simplicity and humor on everything, and the experience is super streamlined, which I appreciate a lot. Now I'm just sad that there isn't anything quite like it on the market. Even Chrono Cross went in a really different direction.\n\nCurrently Playing: Castlevania: Rondo of Blood\n\nCurret Objective: Beating the Wario Land series\n\nNext Game: Fantasian\n\nNext Objective: Beating the Luigi's Mansion series\n\n1.

See you folks in 2022!\n\n1. Rockman X2 (SNES) | Jan. 27 - 5hrs |\n\nMega Man X2 is an excellent sequel - it doesn't stray from what made the first game so outstanding, but there's a little bit of experimentation there, beyond just new levels and enemies. The structure is largely the same, with eight bosses playable in any order, with weaknesses to discover and hidden powerups in their levels. New are three optional bosses, the X-Hunters, who move about the map randomly - each stage has a hidden locked room, and if you pick a stage occupied by one of those bosses the room unlocks and you can fight them there. Defeating them only nets a slightly different outcome to the final stage, but it's a fun challenge, and the kind of dynamic element I would've liked to see expanded as the series progressed. X2 really doesn't shake things up much, but I'm happy to have more of the same at this quality.\n\n2. Cyber Shadow (Game Pass PC) | Feb. 7 - 12hrs |\n\nCyber Shadow borrows a lot from Ninja games of the past, merging those with some contemporary ideas to create a comfortable mixture of new and old. While you as Shadow start out weak, having access to only the most basic abilities, you earn a variety of ninja tricks: shiruken, double jumps, wall jumps, upwards and downwards attacks, and the ability to parry enemy projectiles. The parry becomes an important abilities in the game, triggered like Street Fighter 3 with a quick push in the direction of a nearby projectile to freeze it, where it can be sent back at the enemy with a hit of your sword. The levels are clever and demanding - while it's not quite a metroidvania, the level design is close, layout tailored to your newest abilities or hinting at abilities you'll eventually get. You can revisit those levels later to explore newly reachable places. Even the level checkpoints are interesting - they're usually spaced little too far apart for comfort, forcing you to both play cautiously and master that segment before you can earn a rest. You can invest a little currency there to permanently enhance that checkpoint to recharge your health, your SP (ability ammo), or give you one of the game's ephemeral powerups to help with the next section. The level bosses are mostly clever and tough, demanding careful observation and practice to navigate their patterns. I had an excellent time with Cyber Shadow - the art is gorgeous, the soundtrack is one of the best of the year, and it plays well enough to stand its ground against the best in the genre.\n\n3. Katana Zero (Game Pass PC) | Feb. 10 - 6hrs |\n\nSet in the dystopic near-future of the city of New Mecca, you play as the amnesiac assassin Zero, a veteran of the recent \"Cromag War\" where he was the member of an elite unit called NULL. He's tasked by his psychiatrist to perform assassinations in exchange for treatment, which really isn't how therapy is supposed to work! Nightmare flashes of his past and encounters with other former NULL members have him questioning who he was, who he is, and what his place should be in what's happening now. The game's presentation is astounding: beautifully detailed artwork and animation, impactful sound design, pulse-pounding synthwave music to drive the action and softer, more emotional compositions for poignant story moments. The gameplay is almost puzzle-like - much like Hotline Miami the action is unforgiving and impossibly quick, but here Zero has the ability to slow down time for a few moments. You still have to carefully play your attacks to avoid being overwhelmed, but with this ability you can reflect enemies' bullets back to them with your sword. This is also used to great effect in the narrative when facing NULL opponents who have similar precognition, forcing you to fight without it. I enjoyed the story conceit that all your deaths (there were *many*) are a mental planning phase, with the bonus that you're treated to a unbroken full-speed replay of the full mission after eventual success. The storytelling is fairly organic, with the narrative told both as cutscenes and woven into the action at various points, and at several times you're given dialogue choices which have a true impact on both the story and the gameplay. The only complaint I have at all is that much of the overarching story is left untold or vague - but there's a great chance much of that will be explained in with the planned expansion content currently being worked on.\n\n4. Lycanthorn (itch.io, Steam) | Feb. 11 - 1hr |\n\nLycanthorn is a Castlevania-themed GZDoom conversion, impressively true to NES game's flavour visually and musically (both are excellent here) with much originality added to make it unique. It's played in the first person, your main weapon is an axe instead of a whip, and you only have access to a couple of sub-weapons, but you're still busting down candles for hearts-as-ammo, killing zombies and fishmen and skeleton knights (as well as a host of new enemies) and fighting weird bosses for orbs. Also, you're a werewolf lady. It's short, free (packaged with Lycanthorn II on Steam), and a great way to spend an hour or so.\n\n5. Hebereke (NES) | Feb. 11 - 5hrs |\n\nAlso known as Ufouria: The Saga to folks in Europe, this is kind of a proto-metroidvania platformer where you assemble a team of four characters who all have different abilities, swapping between them as necessary to traverse the world and its obstacles. Lots to explore here, full of Japanese weirdness and Sunsoft creativity. One worth replaying again sometime for sure - the European version had sprite and story changes that'd make a good excuse for a replay.\n\n6. Rebel Galaxy Outlaw (Steam) | Feb. 12 - 52hrs |\n\nA prequel to Rebel Galaxy, following the early exploits of former space pirate Juno Markev, the aunt of the player character in the first game. She's set out for revenge following the news of the death of her husband, which leaves her full of fury and deep in debt after a failed attempt at the killer. Where the first game was novel for its large-ship combat on a flat galactic plane, sequel is a throwback/love letter to Wing Commander: Privateer, returning to small ship combat in 3D space. It follows that template very closely, mixing free-form exploration and story missions to build your wealth and improve your capabilities while feeding you plot goals to accomplish. I really appreciate what they did with Outlaw, being a huge fan of Privateer, and while there's a lot of repetition with the scale of the universe vs. the size of the development team, I never really felt bored at any point, always interested in the next turn of the story. Great performances in the game, too, particularly the lead.\n\n7. Batman: Arkham City (Steam) | Feb. 20 - 44hrs |\n\nI went into Arkham City"
