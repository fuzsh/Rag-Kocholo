        "text": "Hudson Soft Co., Ltd.[a] was a Japanese video game company that released numerous games for video game consoles, home computers and mobile phones, mainly from the 1980s to the 2000s. It was headquartered in the Midtown Tower in Tokyo, with an additional office in the Hudson Building in Sapporo.[5]\n\nHudson Soft was founded on May 18, 1973. Initially, it dealt with personal computer products, but later expanded to the development and publishing of video games, mobile content, video game peripherals and music recording. Primarily a video game publisher, it internally developed many of the video games it released while outsourcing others to external companies. It is known for series such as Bomberman, Adventure Island, Star Soldier, Bonk and Bloody Roar.[6] Hudson also developed video games released by other publishers such as the Mario Party series from Nintendo. The mascot of the company is a bee named Hachisuke.\n\nHudson Soft made the TurboGrafx-16 in association with NEC, to compete against Nintendo, Sega, and SNK, while continuing making games on other platforms, as a third-party developer.\n\nHudson Soft ceased to exist as a company on March 1, 2012, and merged with Konami, which was the surviving entity.[7] Konami owns the assets of Hudson and has since rereleased its video game back catalogue on different occasions.[8][9]\n\nHudson Soft Ltd. was founded in Toyohira-ku, Sapporo, Japan on May 18, 1973 by brothers Yuji and Hiroshi Kudo. The founders grew up admiring trains, and named the business after their favourite, the Hudson locomotives (called the \"4-6-4\", and especially Japanese C62).\n\nHudson began as an amateur radio shop called CQ Hudson (CQハドソン), selling radio telecommunications devices and art photographs. Yuji Kudo had originally planned to start a coffee shop, but there was already one in the same building, resulting in the decision to change to a wireless radio shop at the eleventh hour. Although the Kudo brothers had university education, neither had studied in business management. That factor, combined with the difficulty to find trustworthy people to accompany the Kudos in their venture, meant that Hudson was almost always in the red each month during its era exclusively as a radio shop.\n\nIn September 1975, Hudson began selling personal computer-related products and in March 1978 started developing and selling video game packages.[10] At that time, many amateur radio shops were switching to the sales of personal computers because they deal with the same electronic equipment. CQ Hudson would continue to operate for decades in Sapporo until Hudson Soft closed the shop in May 2001.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hudson Soft favoured a quantity-over-quality approach for the marketing of video games.[11] At one point, the company released up to 30 different computer software titles per month; none of which were hugely successful.[11] Things changed in late 1983, when Hudson started to prioritise quality-over-quantity.[11] Hudson became Nintendo's first third-party software vendor for the Family Computer and its title for this console, Lode Runner, sold 1.2 million units after its 1984 release.[12]\n\nThe business continued developing video games on the Famicom and computer platforms (MSX, NEC PC-8801 and ZX Spectrum, among others). Bomberman was released in December of this year on the Famicom and was considered a \"big hit\" by Hudson Soft.[13]\n\nIn July 1987, Hudson developed the \"C62 System\" and collaborated with NEC to develop the PC Engine video game console. It achieved a second-best success to Famicom in Japan, but its release as the TurboGrafx-16 in North America had less market share than Nintendo's new Super NES or Sega's new Genesis. In 1990, Hudson Soft developed and published video games for an array of systems. In 1994, the 32-bit semiconductor chip \"HuC62\" was independently developed by Hudson and used in NEC's PC-FX video game console.\n\nIn 2004, Hudson started a joint venture with Flying Tiger Entertainment for 25 titles.[14]\n\nHudson Soft relocated its main office to Tokyo in 2005, although the Sapporo headquarters remained in operation as a secondary office.\n\nHudson Soft lost several key people starting in the mid-2000s. Co-founder Hiroshi Kudo left the company in November 2004 following financial losses.[15] Shinichi Nakamoto, who was with the company since 1978 and creator of the Bomberman series, followed suit in 2006. Veteran Takahashi Meijin resigned in May 2011; he had joined Hudson Soft in 1982.[16] Around 2010–2011, many employees migrated to Nintendo's restructured NDCube studio which was headed by Hidetoshi Endo, himself a former Hudson Soft president.\n\nRelation with Konami\n\nedit\n\nThe relation between Hudson Soft and Konami can be traced to at least as early as 1985, when Hudson ported Konami's arcade game Pooyan to the MSX and Famicom. But the acquisition process of Hudson Soft by Konami would only begin in 2001.\n\nHudson Soft was severely hit by the collapse of its main bank Hokkaido Takushoku.[17] Seeking new financing alternatives, Hudson Soft entered the stock market for the first time in December 2000, listing on the NASDAQ Japan Exchange.[18] This led to Konami purchasing a stock allocation of 5.6 million shares in August 2001, becoming the company's largest shareholder. Within the terms of this purchase, Hudson acquired the Sapporo division of Konami Computer Entertainment Studio, renaming it Hudson Studio.[19]\n\nIn April 2005, capital was increased via an allocation of 3 million shares from a third party. Konami Corporation, holding 53.99% of all Hudson stock, became Hudson's majority shareholder and parent company.[15] Hudson Soft continued to publish video games while working closely with Konami, who became Hudson's distributor in Japan.[20]\n\nIn April 2011, Hudson Soft became a wholly owned subsidiary of Konami.[21][22] Its American division, Hudson Entertainment, was liquidated in the process.[23]\n\nOn March 1, 2012, Hudson Soft officially ceased to exist following a merger with Konami Digital Entertainment, with its music business being absorbed into KME Corporation.[7][24] The move was not a unilateral decision from Konami, but rather a voluntary merger agreed by the two companies during a board meeting held on January 12, 2012.[21][25] The main reason for the dissolution of Hudson Soft was the consolidation of the operations of Hudson and Konami into a single company.[24][26]\n\nDespite the demise of Hudson Soft, Konami had planned for products to continue being developed and offered under the Hudson brand.[24][26] The Hudson website was even initially retained and maintained by Konami.[27] By early 2014 however, Konami had retired the website.[28] The pre-2005 headquarters of Hudson Soft in Sapporo continued to operate as a branch of Konami well after the absorption until it closed in 2014.[29] In 2015, Konami sold the Sapporo building that had long been the headquarters of Hudson Soft.[30]"
