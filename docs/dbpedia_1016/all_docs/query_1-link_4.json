Founded in 1973, it was headquartered in the Midtown Tower in Tokyo Midtown, Akasaka, Minato, Tokyo, Japan, with an additional office in the Hudson Building in Sapporo. Hudson Soft was taken over by Konami in January 2011 and absorbed into the latter in March 2012.\n\nLogo (1988-March 2012)\n\nVisuals: On a white or black background, there is a bee (Hachisuke). Next to the bee is the word \"HUDSON\" in a Playbill font.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, it's superimposed.\n\nThere is an animated variant introduced in 2001, where the bee zooms with orange trailing light on a black background. The letters zoom from various angles with green trailing light. Then the background changes to white.\n\nAnother animated version has the logo changing its colors to rusty brown after a sudden stonefall.\n\nTechnique: A still graphic.\n\nAudio: For the still version, the opening theme of the game or silence. Sometimes, there is a Japanese accented voice shouting \"By Hudson!\".\n\nThe first animated version has a synthesized chime with sparkles.\n\nAvailability: Seen on many games, such as the Bomberman, Adventure Island, Bloody Roar, and Mario Party series."
