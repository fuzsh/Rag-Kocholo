        "text": "Post by Discoalucard on\n\nwww.hardcoregaming101.net/soldierforce/soldierforce.htm\n\nThis should be the last doujin game for this particular update batch. This is actually a remake of the original NES Star Soldier, done by Studio Siesta, the guys who did Air Rade and Troubles Witches (the latter of which will be in the next update.) I was originally a bit disappointed when I purchased this, since it's VERY old school in its design, but it's kinda fun, and the score attack levels blow away any other official Star Soldier game.\n\nPost by Smithee on\n\nYeah, I've played it, its okay. Not the greatest, but a pretty nice homage to days gone by.\n\nCannot wait for the TW article. I've been deciding if I want that game for a while.\n\nPost by justjustin on\n\nGreat article, glad I know about this now. It looks pretty slick. It reminds me of Compile's series overhaul with Zanac Neo, except this time it was up to fans to do the job. I also really enjoy Hudson shooters (one of the main reasons I own a PC Engine), so I'll be checking this one out. I'm glad Soldier Force focuses on the Caravan modes.\n\nPost by johnh on\n\nThanks for this article. I actually just played Starship Hector for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and was struck by the music. It's very atypical for a shooter, not a driving soundtrack, but very good. (It's very similar to the music from Bomber King/Robowarrior, actually.)\n\nPost by splatter on\n\nIf Starship Hector was a little more forgiving I think it'd be a lot more fun. And you have to love the name.\n\nI also got a Zanac Neo vibe from the screenshot. Has anyone had luck getting it to run on English versions of Windows? I tried changing the regional settings like the doujin article suggested, but no dice.\n\nPost by Discoalucard on\n\nIf Starship Hector was a little more forgiving I think it'd be a lot more fun.

I tried changing the regional settings like the doujin article suggested, but no dice.\n\nHmmm what kind of error are you getting? I never had any problems getting it up and running...do other doujin games work OK?\n\nPost by splatter on\n\nOops, I've just been clicking on the box as soon as it came up. That must be the usual \"preparing to install\" dialog with a button to cancel. Sorry for the dumb question.\n\nThe hiding under scenery also gives me a little of a Vertical Force vibe. Have you ever thought of adding that game to your Star Soldier article? There are technical obstacles, of course; you can't really emulate a Virtual Boy, and I don't know how magazines got decent screenshots back in the day. It's a nice game, though.\n\nPost by Discoalucard on\n\nThere are Virtual Boy emulators out there...I remember trying one for Snow Bros. I don't think Vertical Force worked though.\n\nI've been told that it's kinda a spinoff of the Star Soldier games...but not technically related? It's not part of the official series per Wikipedia, anyway."
