        "text": "People will see Star Soldier R in one of two ways. Most people will see that it's just a five-minute high score contest with two levels and no other meaningful content, and brush it off as a waste of money. Even people who are fans of shoot-'em-up games will realize there's better value in similar Virtual Console games.\n\nHowever, once you actually sit down and dig into Hudson's little shooter, the game shows its true colors. For only being five minutes long at its maximum, Star Soldier R is extremely addicting, highly replayable, and good fun. Those that can drop the assumptions about the game's length and relative value will see a well-designed experience.\n\nThe idea behind the R version of the Star Soldier series is that you're up against the clock, simply pushing to get the highest score possible. It's almost impossible to not reach the end of the game's one-level, two-minute mode. Fighting through two levels, over five minutes isn't much harder, although you can still get busted for being lazy or sloppy. The point of the game isn't to beat it, since doing that is a foregone conclusion.\n\nInstead, the idea is to push yourself as far as you dare and squeeze out the highest score possible. The game's risk-reward system makes this a real test of skill and nerves. You can make your ship move around the screen faster by retracting its wings, making it much easier to blow stuff up and snag pickups. In doing so, however, you'll risk being destroyed more easily. Additionally, up to five option ships can act as additional shielding by hovering around your ship. If you're feeling brave, you can send the options astray and use them as free-moving sentry guns for more offensive power, which is sometimes necessary to take down enemies quickly.\n\nThe game's stages are filled with stuff to destroy. Along with the usual barrage of enemies, you'll fly over a grid of structures which can be taken out by your main guns. As you destroy these objects, your combo counter will increase. The higher your combo at the end of the stage, the bigger your bonus score. Special yellow orbs, which break free when shot and lazily oscillate across the screen, can give you additional points.\n\nRed and blue containers upgrade your main gun and your option ships, respectively. Besides having the obvious benefit of six-way fire when you've maxed out your guns, collecting additional containers will net you 10,000 additional points. Plus, having maxed out weaponry will help you take out the boss of each level more quickly. There's a time bonus added on to your ending score, and since the levels always scroll by at the same rate, the time difference is how quickly you can take down the bosses. This will make you try to figure out the best boss-killing strategies.\n\nThere are even lots of secret bonus scoring opportunities hidden through the levels. Hidden icons will sometimes pop up and get you 3,000 points for free. Blowing up a donut-shaped structure, while you're inside of it (without getting hit by it), will net you 50,000 points. Destroying two floaty sphere things simultaneously is worth a cool 80,000 points. These last two especially are significant bonuses which you'll want to get if you want to beat your own high score.\n\nTrying to beat your high score is what makes Star Soldier R so addictive. When you play through the game and start understanding when and why you need to throttle up (or down) the speed or toggle the option ships, you'll see where you can pick up more points and jump back in to fight for them because you know you can do just a little better the next time. You don't need the online leaderboards, broken down into region, country, and worldwide rankings, to do that. They can help you chase that carrot just a little more, though.\n\nOf course, the fact doesn't change that Star Soldier R doesn't have much going for it in the way of content. It's surprisingly addictive, but you can only get so much out of so little. One really big piece that's missing is friend-only leaderboards, which would have made going for a new high score just a little bit sweeter. Also, a two-player co-op mode would have been nice to have.\n\nI've seen enough WiiWare games to realize that you need to check your expectations for what you're paying for. If you decide to get Star Soldier R, you're not going to get the same stuff you'll find from the other Star Soldier games on Virtual Console. The WiiWare game is a different experience, and a rewarding one at that, provided you understand what it is you're getting into beforehand. You'll find R to be a pretty fun game if you do.\n\nQuote:\n\nWeighing price versus value is something that's up to the consumer, not the reviewer, because they're ultimately the one buying the games. All we as reviewers can do is independently tell them whether or not it's any good.\n\nFair enough, thought that attitude isn't consistent. As DAaaMan64 mentioned the \"buy vs rent\" opinion often comes up. I remember back on the Gamecube Resident Evil 2 and 3 got raked over the coals for being straight last-gen ports with no new features sold at full price. Not saying NWR was doing it (can't remember if they did) but that stuff isn't uncommon. Those games are definitely good but the price affected reviews. Ditto with stuff like the Splinter Cell games on the Cube frequently getting lower scores because they lacked the online modes that other versions had. Again that isn't really an independent review of quality. The Gamecube version is still good, even if the Xbox version is better. That's kind of in the realm of letting the consumer decide what matters to them.\n\nStuff like Consumer Report does take into account price. But then that is a bit different. Movie and album reviews don't take into account price but then the price is rarely an issue in those cases.\n\nI really don't care if someone wants to pay $8 for this, though if their actions spawn a trend I'll be upset. I didn't care if Gamecube owners bought a brand new Wii specifically for a Zelda game that was going to be available on the console they already owned. I was worried about the message that would send however and sure enough I was dead on, as last-gen ports are very common on the Wii. I had similar concerns over people buying individual Mario Advance games on the GBA. Nintendo had years earlier established the precedence of a Mario compilation in Super Mario All-Stars and buying those same games for effectively four times the price could undo that precedence, which it did. I also was concerned that if Nintendo felt they could get by with just re-releasing old Mario games they wouldn't have to make a new 2D Mario for the GBA. If you want to get ripped off I don't care, but I didn't get a new Mario side-scroller until the DS because of that.\n\nSo if over-priced Wii Ware games that come across as unfinished product become the norm I'm going to be a tad peaved if those that bought Star Soldier R helped make that happen. So I think price vs value is pretty important. Reckless spenders just make things more expensive for responsible people. It happens at all levels of consumerism, not just videogames."
