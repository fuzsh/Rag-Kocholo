Isaac Bashevis Singer (1903 - 1991) was a Polish-born Jewish American author of short stories, novels, essays, cultural criticism, memoirs, plays and stories for children. In a career spanning nearly seven decades, he wrote in Yiddish and translated his work into English with collaborators and editors. Singer published widely during his lifetime, including nearly 60 stories in The New Yorker, and received numerous awards and prizes, including two Newberry Honor Book Awards, two National Book Awards and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1978.

Singer was also an accomplished playwright, and his plays, including Yentl; Enemies, A Love Story; Gimpel the Fool; Shlemiel the First; Teibele and Her Demon and Zlateh the Goat, were all adapted by Singer from his own writings. Known for fiction that portrayed 19th-century Polish Jewry, modern Jewish life before and after the Second World War, and supernatural tales that combined Jewish mysticism with demonology, Singer was a master storyteller whose sights were set squarely on the tension between human nature and the human spirit.
