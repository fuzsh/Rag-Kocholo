        "text": "Carbondale and Edwardsville, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1969. First edition. Hardcover. First printing. An anthology of essays edited by and with an essay by Allentuch and with additional contributions by William H. Gass, Eli Katz, Morris Golden and others. A close to near fine copy with some minor wear and Allentuck's ownership signature on the front free endpaper in an about very good dust jacket that has some chips, tears and a small faint stain to the rear panel and with a laid in order form. Signed and inscribed by Singer on the front free endpaper to Allentuck: \"To Marsha Allentuck with love and gratitude for what she did (and will do) for me. Isaac B. Singer Feb 21 1970 (Pasadena, Callifornia).\" Singer's inscription is perhaps prescient of the importance of this book in that he went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978.\n\nItem #153882"
