        "text": "Is went to MIT as a Moore In­struct­or, a pro­gram with out­side sup­port be­gun un­der Ted Mar­tin in 1948 which al­lowed for a lower teach­ing load.2\n\nThe day Is ar­rived at MIT and met War­ren Am­brose is an oft-told story, nowhere bet­ter than in this trib­ute to Am­brose writ­ten by Is him­self in 1966 [15].\n\nI have not for­got­ten my first day at MIT. In 1950 Moore in­struct­ors had to teach sum­mer school. On a sunny af­ter­noon early in Ju­ly, I crossed the bridge in search of Build­ing 2. Math headquar­ters was on the second floor; it still is. I in­tro­duced my­self to Ruth Good­win, who handled all sec­ret­ari­al ser­vices, and I asked to see the chair­man. When I gave Ruth my name, a chap sit­ting across from her, head bur­ied in the Bo­ston Globe lowered his pa­per and said: “Sing­er, I’m Am­brose. There is a sem­in­ar in Lie groups in five minutes. You can see Mar­tin later. Come.”\n\nI did, and met John Moore, Bar­rett O’Neill, and George White­head, who be­came lifelong friends. After get­ting my teach­ing as­sign­ment from Ted Mar­tin, Am­brose told me the sem­in­ar met at mid­night in the Hayes-Bick­ford cof­fee shop. He would pick me up at 11:45. Kay White­head joined us for these even­ing ses­sions; the cof­fee was deadly, the con­ver­sa­tion lively. Am­brose gave me a tour of Bo­ston that first night and by the time he dropped me off, we were close friends.\n\nOne day Am­brose said, “Sing­er, you listened to Chern’s lec­tures. What did he say?” At Chica­go, I had pass­ively taken notes of S. S. Chern’s course, while writ­ing a dis­ser­ta­tion in an­oth­er sub­ject. What with in­ter­pret­ing my notes, read­ing Chern’s pa­pers, pour­ing over Élie Cartan, and Am­brose in­sist­ing on ab­so­lute clar­ity in every de­tail, we learned dif­fer­en­tial geo­metry to­geth­er.\n\nAm­brose de­signed the Geo­metry of Man­i­folds course, and we taught it in al­tern­ate years. It is pretty much the same today as it was then: stand­ard man­i­fold the­ory the first term and in­struct­or’s choice of top­ics the second. Our stu­dents wrote some well-known gradu­ate texts based on this course: Bish­op–Crit­tenden, Hicks, and Warner.\n\nWith cus­tom­ary zeal, Am­brose changed the un­der­gradu­ate pro­gram in pure math­em­at­ics. Where­as in 1948 An­dré Weil ex­plained dif­fer­en­tial forms to the fac­ulty at the Uni­versity of Chica­go, less than a dec­ade later we were us­ing them in un­der­gradu­ate dif­fer­en­tial geo­metry.\n\nAm­brose taught the Le­besgue in­teg­ral in the ana­lys­is course for ju­ni­ors and seni­ors “be­cause it’s sim­pler than the Riemann in­teg­ral.” For al­most twenty years Am­brose was the guid­ing spir­it of pure math­em­at­ics at MIT. His ef­forts were key in mak­ing it a great de­part­ment. Am­brose and I reg­u­larly drove around Bo­ston late at night talk­ing about math­em­at­ics and life. We knew every street; and to this day, with the in­ev­it­able traffic jam, I’ll re­mem­ber an al­tern­ate route and, of­ten enough, a spe­cial mo­ment: yes, here is where we fi­nally un­der­stood holonomy.\n\nAm­brose taught me jazz. I had been an en­thu­si­ast of Dixie­land and swing. But by 1950 bop was dom­in­ant. Charlie Park­er was king, and every­one else his stu­dent. We heard all the great jazz mu­si­cians at all the jazz joints. There was a cas­u­al­ness and dir­ect­ness then that makes it dif­fi­cult for me to hear jazz live today. It’s too ri­gid and form­al now. Ima­gine watch­ing Bird take on a long line of young sax play­ers, listen­ing to each in­tently and then play­ing their vari­ation as it should be played. Teach­ing at its best, I felt. Ima­gine hav­ing cof­fee between sets with Bil­lie and thank­ing her for her early re­cords that meant so much to many of us. Dick Kadis­on and I used to hear Ella night after night at Bird­land when we took a break from work. Am­brose ex­plained jazz to me and talked about it in the fifties the way Wyn­ton Mar­s­al­is does now.\n\nThough math­em­at­ics was won­der­ful, I was heav­ily burdened. My old­est son was blinded at birth and, as I learned later, brain dam­aged. I could not have sur­vived as a math­em­atician without Am­brose’s steady sup­port and the steady sup­port of my very good friend, Dick Kadis­on. Those who knew Am­brose know that ex­press­ing grat­it­ude was for­bid­den. He walked rap­idly away the one time I tried. Oc­ca­sion­ally, I can provide spe­cial help to a young math­em­atician. I think of Am­brose and feel that by the time I have helped a hun­dred, I’ll have be­gun to pay my debt to him.\n\nI loved Am­brose for his ab­so­lute hon­esty, his gen­er­os­ity, his wit, his en­ergy, and above all for his ten­der­ness, which he tried so hard to hide. I am sad that so few math­em­aticians knew what a great man he was. But I was happy for him when he found his wife, Jean­nette, with whom he could be him­self for twenty years.\n\nRe­flect­ing on the biggest dif­fer­ence between the Uni­versity of Chica­go and MIT, Is has said that at Chica­go teach­ing of un­der­gradu­ates was done by a des­ig­nated fac­ulty hired for the pur­pose. So Is saw very little of the un­der­grads. At MIT, by con­trast, the teach­ing of un­der­gradu­ates was shared by all fac­ulty.\n\nAm­brose and a few oth­ers were very eager to re­vital­ize the cur­riculum, and they called upon Is to teach the fac­ulty, and then the stu­dents, the latest math­em­at­ics from Chica­go, es­pe­cially the per­spect­ives on dif­fer­en­tial geo­metry that Is learned from Chern [15].\n\nOut of this in­tense work in geo­metry came the fam­ous Am­brose–Sing­er the­or­em re­lat­ing holonomy to curvature. For a nice de­scrip­tion of this the­or­em, see Hung-Hsi Wu’s trib­ute in the same No­tices [15].\n\nAfter two years at MIT, Is went to UCLA for 1952–54, where he was wont to tease Ted Mar­tin, then chair at UCLA, by say­ing that MIT had sent him out to the minor leagues for fur­ther train­ing. Is then spent a year at Columbia Uni­versity, fol­lowed by a mo­ment­ous year at IAS with Atiyah, Raoul Bott, Fritz Hirzebruch, J.-P. Serre and Arnold Sha­piro, be­fore he even­tu­ally re­turned to MIT in 1956.\n\nThe Kadis­on–Sing­er prob­lem, posed in 1959 by Dick Kadis­on and Is [1], was mo­tiv­ated by Dir­ac’s work in quantum mech­an­ics. It was a prob­lem in func­tion­al ana­lys­is about wheth­er cer­tain ex­ten­sions of cer­tain lin­ear func­tion­als on cer­tain \\( \\operatorname{C}^* \\)-al­geb­ras were unique. The unique­ness was proven in 2013 [e12], al­though the proof was greeted skep­tic­ally by Dick and Is.\n\nIs got to know Mi­chael Atiyah at IAS in 1955, and when he wished to go to Eng­land on a sab­bat­ic­al, he asked Mi­chael, who had just ar­rived in Ox­ford, if there was a spot for him. Mi­chael im­me­di­ately said yes.\n\nAfter ar­riv­ing in Ox­ford in Janu­ary 1962, and while warm­ing him­self at a little heat­er, Is looked up to see Mi­chael in the door­way. An im­mor­tal three-line con­ver­sa­tion fol­lowed:\n\nMi­chael: Why is the \\( A \\)-roof genus an in­teger for spin man­i­folds?\n\nIs: Mi­chael, why are you ask­ing me that, you know the an­swer?\n\nMi­chael: Yes, I do know the an­swer, but I feel there is a deep­er reas­on.\n\nIs had oth­er work on his mind (a joint pro­ject with Shlomo Stern­berg on the in­fin­ite groups of Élie Cartan [3], but Atiyah’s ques­tion in­trigued him. He spent the early spring, sit­ting on garden benches, think­ing about the prob­lem. By March he un­der­stood the is­sues and went to Mi­chael’s of­fice and said that in­tegers arise as the count of the num­ber of solu­tions of the Dir­ac op­er­at­or gen­er­al­ized to spin man­i­folds. And in fact in all the oth­er cases where in­tegers oc­cur (e.g., the sig­na­ture of a man­i­fold or the arith­met­ic genus), it is be­cause of count­ing solu­tions of geo­met­ric op­er­at­ors.\n\nMi­chael ran with that, pro­posed some for­mu­las, and their col­lab­or­a­tion began in earn­est. Nine months later they had a com­plete proof of the Atiyah–Sing­er in­dex the­or­em!\n\nAtiyah gives his per­spect­ive on the in­dex the­or­em in his com­ment­ary be­gin­ning in the third volume of his col­lec­ted works [e8], ex­cerp­ted here:\n\nIn the Spring of 1962, my first year at Ox­ford, Sing­er de­cided to spend part of his sab­bat­ic­al there. This turned out to be par­tic­u­larly for­tu­nate for both of us and led to our long col­lab­or­a­tion on the in­dex the­ory of el­lipt­ic op­er­at­ors. This had its ori­gins in my work on \\( K \\)-the­ory with Hirzebruch and the at­tempt to ex­tend the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch the­or­em in­to dif­fer­en­tial geo­metry. We had already shown that the in­teg­ral­ity of the Todd genus of an al­most com­plex man­i­fold and the \\( \\hat{A} \\)-genus of a spin-man­i­fold could be el­eg­antly ex­plained in terms of \\( K \\)-the­ory. For an al­geb­ra­ic vari­ety the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch the­or­em went one step fur­ther and iden­ti­fied the Todd genus with the arith­met­ic genus or Euler char­ac­ter­ist­ic of the sheaf co­hom­mo­logy. Also the \\( L \\)-genus of a dif­fer­en­tial man­i­fold, as proved by Hirzebruch, gave the sig­na­ture of the quad­rat­ic form of middle di­men­sion­al co­homo­logy and, by Hodge the­ory, this was the dif­fer­ence between the di­men­sions of the rel­ev­ant spaces of har­mon­ic forms. As Hirzebruch him­self had real­ized it was nat­ur­al there­fore to look for a sim­il­ar ana­lyt­ic­al in­ter­pret­a­tion of the \\( \\hat{A} \\)-genus. The co­homo­lo­gic­al for­mula and the as­so­ci­ated char­ac­ter for­mula clearly in­dic­ated that one should use the spin rep­res­ent­a­tions. I was strug­gling with this prob­lem when Sing­er ar­rived. For­tu­nately Sing­er’s strengths were pre­cisely in dif­fer­en­tial geo­metry and ana­lys­is, the areas where I was weak­est. With his help we soon re­dis­covered the Dir­ac op­er­at­or! […]\n\nOnce we had grasped the sig­ni­fic­ance of spinors and the Dir­ac equa­tion it be­came evid­ent that the \\( \\hat{A} \\)-genus had to be the dif­fer­ence of the di­men­sions of pos­it­ive and neg­at­ive har­mon­ic spinors. Prov­ing this then be­came our main ob­ject­ive. By good for­tune Smale passed through Ox­ford at this time and, when we ex­plained our ideas to him, he drew our at­ten­tion to a pa­per of Gel’fand on the gen­er­al prob­lem of com­put­ing the in­dex of el­lipt­ic op­er­at­ors. […]\n\nSing­er and I had some great ad­vant­ages over the ana­lysts in­vest­ig­at­ing the prob­lem. We were in­vest­ig­at­ing a par­tic­u­lar case, the Dir­ac op­er­at­or, and we already ‘knew’ the an­swer. Also this case…en­com­passed all the glob­al to­po­lo­gic­al com­plic­a­tions. Moreover, we had ar­rived at the prob­lem start­ing from \\( K \\)-the­ory and this turned out to be just the right tool to study the in­dex prob­lem. Fi­nally the Dir­ac op­er­at­or was in a sense the most gen­er­al case, all oth­ers be­ing es­sen­tially de­form­able to it. […]\n\n[…] Sing­er and I even­tu­ally pro­duced a proof of the gen­er­al in­dex the­or­em dur­ing my stay at Har­vard in the Fall in 1962. […] I real­ized at the time the sig­ni­fic­ance of the in­dex the­or­em and that it rep­res­en­ted the high-point of my work, but it would have been hard to pre­dict that the sub­ject would con­tin­ue to oc­cupy me in vari­ous forms for the next twenty years. I would also have been ex­tremely sur­prised if I had been told that this work would in due course be­come im­port­ant in the­or­et­ic­al phys­ics.\n\nThe proof of the in­dex the­or­em was presen­ted in de­tail in an Atiyah–Bott–Sing­er sem­in­ar at Har­vard in Fall 1962, was an­nounced in the Bul­let­in in 1963 [2], and was writ­ten up in de­tail in the Borel–Pal­ais sem­in­ar at the In­sti­tute for Ad­vanced Study in 1963 [e1]. This ver­sion was a proof us­ing cobor­d­isms, where one showed that both the ana­lyt­ic and to­po­lo­gic­al in­dex are in­vari­ant un­der cobor­d­isms, and then check­ing that both in­dices are equal on the gen­er­at­ors of the rel­ev­ant cobor­d­ism groups, as had been done by Hirzebruch in his proof of the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch the­or­em.\n\nBott ex­plains this in his math re­view:\n\nThe au­thors here de­scribe their solu­tion to the in­dex prob­lem for el­lipt­ic op­er­at­ors on closed man­i­folds. Their res­ult may also be thought of as a beau­ti­ful and far-reach­ing gen­er­al­iz­a­tion of Hirzebruch’s Riemann–Roch the­or­em — both in state­ment and in the spir­it of the proof.\n\nThe au­thors for­mu­late the in­dex prob­lem in the fol­low­ing gen­er­al set­ting. Let \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) be vec­tor-bundles over the com­pact man­i­fold \\( X \\), where everything is \\( C^{\\infty} \\) throughout. It then makes sense to speak of a dif­fer­en­tial op­er­at­or \\( D \\) from \\( E \\) to \\( F \\), and such an op­er­at­or in­duces a lin­ear map \\[ D:\\Gamma(E)\\to \\Gamma(F) \\] from the sec­tions of \\( E \\) to those of \\( F \\). When \\( D \\) is el­lipt­ic, both the ker­nel and the coker­nel of \\( D \\) are fi­nite-di­men­sion­al, and the dif­fer­ence of these di­men­sions is by defin­i­tion the in­dex of \\( D \\). Al­tern­ately, one has the equal­ity in­dex \\[ \\sigma(D)=\\sum (-1)^i\\operatorname{dim}H^i(X;K), \\] where \\( K \\) is the ker­nel sheaf of \\( D \\), as fol­lows from rudi­ment­ary sheaf the­ory, and the loc­al “onto” prop­erty of el­lipt­ic op­er­at­ors: \\begin{align*} H^0 (X;K) &\\simeq \\operatorname{ker}D,\\\\ H^1(X;K) &\\simeq \\operatorname{coker}D,\\\\ H^i(X;K) &=0,\\quad i\\geq2. \\end{align*}\n\nThe “in­dex prob­lem” is to give a de­scrip­tion of this in­teger in terms of the to­po­lo­gic­al data im­pli­cit in the el­lipt­ic op­er­at­or. To de­scribe these one needs the fol­low­ing in­ter­pret­a­tion of the highest-or­der terms in \\( D \\). Let \\( T(X) \\) be the co­tan­gent bundle of \\( X \\), and let \\( T_0(X) \\) be the sub­set of nonzero vec­tors in \\( T(X) \\). The pro­jec­tion \\( T(X)\\to X \\) will be de­noted by \\( \\pi \\). With this un­der­stood, the highest-or­der terms of \\( D \\) are seen to define a def­in­ite ho­mo­morph­ism \\[ \\sigma(D):\\pi^{\\ast} E\\to \\pi^{\\ast}F \\] of the pulled-back bundles on \\( T(X) \\). Fur­ther, \\( D \\) is el­lipt­ic if and only if this ho­mo­morph­ism, called the sym­bol of \\( D \\), is an iso­morph­ism on \\( T_0(X) \\). This iso­morph­ism — or rather its stable ho­mo­topy class \\( [\\sigma (D)] \\) — is to be thought of as the to­po­lo­gic­al “twist” of the el­lipt­ic op­er­at­or \\( D \\).\n\nOne may re­late \\( [\\sigma (D)] \\) in vari­ous ways to more stand­ard to­po­lo­gic­al ob­jects. Maybe the simplest con­struc­tion is the fol­low­ing one. Let \\( B(X) \\) and \\( S(X) \\), re­spect­ively, stand for the unit ball and unit sphere bundle of \\( T(X) \\) en­dowed with some fixed Rieman­ni­an struc­ture. Let \\[ W(X)=B(X)\\cup^{}_{S(X)} B(X) \\] be the man­i­fold ob­tained by glue­ing two cop­ies of\\( B(X) \\) to­geth­er along their bound­ary, i.e., \\( W(X) \\) is the doubled man­i­fold con­struc­ted from \\( B(X) \\). Now one uses \\( \\sigma(D) \\) to con­struct a bundle \\( E \\cup_{\\sigma(D)} F \\) on \\( W(X) \\) by tak­ing \\( \\pi^*E \\) on one copy of \\( B(X) \\), \\( \\pi^*F \\) on the oth­er, and glue­ing them to­geth­er over \\( S(X) \\) by means of the iso­morph­ism \\( \\sigma(D) \\). (Al­tern­at­ively and really equi­val­ently, one may use \\( \\sigma(D) \\) to con­struct a dif­fer­ence ele­ment in \\( K(B(X),S(X)) \\) and that is the point of view taken in the pa­per un­der re­view.)\n\nA for­mula quite equi­val­ent to the in­dex for­mula of the pa­per now is of the form \\[\\operatorname{index}(D)=\\int_{W(X)} \\operatorname{ch}(E \\cup^{}_{\\sigma(D)} F)\\wedge \\pi^*A(X). \\] Here \\( \\operatorname{ch} \\) de­notes the Chern char­ac­ter and \\( A(X) \\) is a dif­fer­en­tial form on \\( X \\) which we will not spe­cify here, but which is an ex­pli­cit poly­no­mi­al in the char­ac­ter­ist­ic classes of \\( X \\).\n\nThe in­dex for­mula eas­ily yields the res­ults of the pi­on­eers in this field such as Agran­ovič, Dyn­in, Gel’fand, See­ley, Vol’pert, etc. The for­mula is also seen to gen­er­al­ize the Riemann–Roch the­or­em of Hirzebruch to (not ne­ces­sar­ily) al­geb­ra­ic com­plex man­i­folds and bundles. (To this one need only fol­low up our earli­er ex­pres­sion for in­dex \\( (D) \\) as an Euler char­ac­ter­ist­ic.)\n\nThe proof of the in­dex for­mula, as well as its vari­ous con­sequences in spe­cial cases, is clearly sum­mar­ized in the note. For the sake of ana­lysts we re­mark only that the gen­er­al set­ting of op­er­at­ors on vec­tor-bundles — as op­posed to sys­tems — is es­sen­tial for the proof.\n\nThe proof us­ing cobor­d­ism the­ory suffered be­cause it did not work in the equivari­ant case, as the rel­ev­ant equivari­ant cobor­d­ism groups were not all known. Atiyah writes [e9]:\n\nFor some years Sing­er and I searched for a bet­ter proof mod­elled more on Grothen­dieck’s proof of the gen­er­al­ized Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch the­or­em. Even­tu­ally we found such a proof, based on em­bed­ding a man­i­fold in Eu­c­lidean space and then trans­fer­ring the prob­lem to one on the Eu­c­lidean space by a suit­able ‘dir­ect im­age’ con­struc­tion. This proof [4] worked purely in a \\( K \\)-the­ory con­text and avoided ra­tion­al co­homo­logy. It there­fore lent it­self to vari­ous sig­ni­fic­ant gen­er­al­iz­a­tions de­veloped in the re­main­ing pa­pers of the series [e2], [5], [6], [7]. One gen­er­al­iz­a­tion, the ‘equivari­ant’ in­dex the­or­em, dealt with com­pact group ac­tions pre­serving an el­lipt­ic op­er­at­or. This ex­ten­ded the Lef­schetz for­mula of my pa­pers with Bott to the case of non­isol­ated fixed points (of iso­met­ries), and res­ted on the pri­or de­vel­op­ment of equivari­ant the­ory. This had been car­ried out by Graeme Segal in his thes­is and the rel­ev­ant ap­plic­a­tions to in­dex the­ory were de­veloped in [e2].\n\nAn In­di­an math­em­atician, V. K. Pat­odi, ob­tained re­mark­able res­ults ap­ply­ing the heat equa­tion to the in­dex the­or­em. Pat­odi joined Is and Atiyah in a sig­ni­fic­ant series of pa­pers [8], [9], [10], [11], es­tab­lish­ing a sig­na­ture the­or­em for man­i­folds with bound­ary, lead­ing to the \\( \\eta \\)-in­vari­ant. In [e8] Atiyah re­marked:\n\nThe prob­lem of gen­er­al­iz­ing the Hirzebruch sig­na­ture the­or­em to man­i­folds with bound­ary had long been an in­triguing ques­tion. There had been many clues, not­ably the work of Hirzebruch on sig­na­ture de­fects of cusps of Hil­bert mod­u­lar sur­faces…. Sing­er and I there­fore tried to ana­lyse the prob­lem in its more gen­er­al form. Even­tu­ally we saw that the nat­ur­al for­mu­la­tion was that of an in­dex prob­lem with a ‘glob­al’ bound­ary con­di­tion. This was con­cep­tu­ally a ma­jor break­through.\n\nIn many ways the pa­pers on spec­tral asym­metry were per­haps the most sat­is­fy­ing ones I was in­volved with. The way they stretched over dif­fer­en­tial geo­metry, to­po­logy, and ana­lys­is with a nod in the dir­ec­tion of num­ber the­ory ap­pealed greatly to me. At the time these pa­pers had only a mod­est im­pact but, a few years later when con­tact was made with the­or­et­ic­al phys­ics, they be­came ex­tremely pop­u­lar. In par­tic­u­lar Wit­ten’s work on glob­al an­om­alies brought our \\( \\eta \\)-in­vari­ant in­to prom­in­ence, in a way which we could nev­er have fore­seen.\n\nVic­tor Guille­min’s re­view of [8] gives a clear state­ment:\n\nThis pa­per an­nounces some very ex­cit­ing res­ults con­cern­ing the so-called \\( \\eta \\)-in­vari­ant of a self-ad­joint (not ne­ces­sar­ily pos­it­ive) el­lipt­ic op­er­at­or. For such an op­er­at­or one can form: \\[ \\eta_A(s)=\\sum_{\\lambda \\neq 0} \\operatorname{sign}\\lambda \\, |\\lambda|^{-s}, \\] with the sum taken over all ei­gen­val­ues in the spec­trum of \\( A \\). This turns out to be a well defined mero­morph­ic func­tion of \\( s \\). One of the main res­ults an­nounced here is that \\( \\eta_A(s) \\) is fi­nite at the ori­gin; hence the \\( \\eta \\)-in­vari­ant of \\( A \\), \\[ \\eta (A) =\\eta_A(0), \\] is defined. In par­tic­u­lar take \\( X \\) to be a com­pact ori­ented Rieman­ni­an man­i­fold of di­men­sion \\( 4k-1 \\) and let \\( A \\) be the op­er­at­or act­ing on ex­ter­i­or dif­fer­en­tial forms of even de­gree giv­en by \\[ A(\\phi)=(-1)^{p+1}d* \\phi +(-1)^p *d \\phi, \\] “\\( * \\)” be­ing the usu­al Hodge star op­er­at­or. Sup­pose that \\( X \\) is the bound­ary of an ori­ented Rieman­ni­an man­i­fold \\( Y \\) that is iso­met­ric near the bound­ary to the cyl­in­der \\( X \\times [0,1] \\). Let \\( p_i(Y) \\) de­note the \\( i \\)-th Pon­trja­gin form of \\( Y \\). Then the au­thors link the \\( \\eta \\)-in­vari­ant of \\( A \\) to the sig­na­ture of \\( Y \\) by the for­mula \\[ \\operatorname{sign}(Y)-\\int_Y L(p) = (-1)^{k+1} \\eta (A), \\] where \\( L \\) is the Hirzebruch \\( L \\)-poly­no­mi­al. For \\( Y \\) bound­ary­less, the right-hand side is zero, and one re­trieves the usu­al Hirzebruch sig­na­ture for­mula. The au­thors also an­nounce an in­dex for­mula with bound­ary term for the Dir­ac op­er­at­or in­volving an \\( \\eta \\)-in­vari­ant. They con­clude by giv­ing a brief out­line of the proof.\n\nThe \\( \\eta \\)-in­vari­ant was partly mo­tiv­ated by Hirzebruch’s res­ult ex­press­ing the sig­na­ture de­fect in terms of val­ues of \\( L \\)-func­tions of real quad­rat­ic fields. Is and Atiyah with Har­old Don­nelly ex­ten­ded Hirzebruch’s for­mula to the case of totally real fields of any de­gree [14].\n\nIn 1977, with Atiyah and Nigel Hitchin, Is showed that the mod­uli space of \\( \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\) in­stan­tons (with Pontry­agin in­dex equal to one) over \\( X^4 \\) is hy­per­bol­ic 5-space [12], [13]. Then Clif­ford Taubes [e5] ex­ten­ded this res­ult to the case of 4-man­i­folds \\( X^4 \\) with pos­it­ive def­in­ite in­ter­sec­tion forms; he showed that the 5-di­men­sion­al mod­uli space has as its com­pac­ti­fic­a­tion \\( X^4 \\) con­sist­ing of sin­gu­lar in­stan­tons at each point of \\( X \\). This, to­geth­er with work of Kar­en Uh­len­beck paved the way for Si­mon Don­ald­son’s spec­tac­u­lar in­vari­ants [e7] dis­tin­guish­ing many smooth 4-man­i­folds which are ho­mo­topy equi­val­ent and thus homeo­morph­ic by Freed­man’s work [e6]. A re­mark­able co­rol­lary (first ob­served by Freed­man and the au­thor ([e10], Chapter 10) is that \\( \\mathbb{R}^4 \\) has un­count­ably many smooth struc­tures, some which em­bed smoothly in stand­ard \\( \\mathbb{R}^4 \\) and some which do not. The 1977 pa­per was the fore­run­ner of these start­ling res­ults.\n\nFor per­son­al reas­ons Is went to Berke­ley in 1977. MIT was not happy about this de­cision, so they ar­ranged for Is to re­tire but to be brought back eas­ily if he was will­ing. Every year MIT would call and in 1984 he fi­nally said yes, for they caught him at a time when he was par­tic­u­larly an­noyed at de­part­ment­al polit­ics at Berke­ley (in­ter­view with au­thor, Decem­ber 1, 2017).\n\nIs’ wife Rose­marie and daugh­ters Emily and An­na­belle did not want to leave Berke­ley, but things worked out well for both daugh­ters: Emily is now bi­otech ed­it­or of MIT Tech­no­logy Re­view and An­na­belle got her Ph.D. at UC­SF in brain and cog­nit­ive sci­ences and is now a postdoc at MIT.\n\nIs was elec­ted to the Na­tion­al Academy of Sci­ences in 1968, and served as Chair of their Com­mit­tee on Sci­ence, En­gin­eer­ing and Pub­lic Policy (COSEPUP). One of the first is­sues he tackled was what to do with nuc­le­ar waste. An­oth­er is­sue he brought up to the com­mit­tee was the threat to pri­vacy from the com­ing com­puter/in­ter­net re­volu­tion, but Is was way ahead of his time in this re­spect, and the rest of the com­mit­tee was less in­ter­ested.\n\nWhile serving on the com­mit­tee, Is went to see Jerry Weis­ner, then pres­id­ent of MIT, who con­grat­u­lated him on be­ing Chair of COSEPUP. Is ex­pressed doubt about his com­mit­tee role, aver­ring that it would take away from his re­search. Jerry replied that the ex­per­i­ence would be valu­able and would give Is a dif­fer­ent and much broad­er view of what he (Is) would want to do. Is real­ized that Jerry was right, and in­stead of fo­cus­ing merely on the par­tic­u­lar tech­nic­al as­pects of his work, he learned to step back and ask, Do I want to do this? Why do I want to do this? Where does it fit in­to my view of math­em­at­ics? — and this re­flec­tion of­ten changed things.\n\nIs also served on the Dav­id Com­mit­tee, or­gan­ized by Ken Hoff­man (the then-re­cent chair of the MIT math de­part­ment) who per­suaded Ed Dav­id, Nix­on’s Sci­ence Ad­viser (who had resigned in 1973 out of frus­tra­tion), to be chair.\n\nIs was a mem­ber of the White House Sci­ence Coun­cil from 1982–88. His ex­per­i­ence in Wash­ing­ton left him with a fa­vor­able im­pres­sion of the sci­entif­ic tal­ent summoned to duty in the cap­it­ol. For ex­ample, he stated that the choice of ex­perts for sci­ence policy re­flec­ted great­er sound­ness of judg­ment, in many cases, than did ten­ure de­cisions in aca­demia. He also had great re­spect for the mil­it­ary, arising from his ser­vice in World War II.\n\nThough Is later served on the Gov­ern­ing Board of the Na­tion­al Re­search Coun­cil (1995–99), it must be said that math­em­aticians are not fre­quently called to serve in policy-mak­ing roles in DC. Is re­mem­bers the White House Sci­ence Ad­viser, Jay Keyworth, com­ing in one morn­ing after a long meet­ing the night be­fore re­gard­ing some par­tic­u­larly in­tract­able prob­lem and say­ing (with a smile, one as­sumes): “Is, your sug­ges­tion solves the prob­lem. How can you be so smart, you’re just a math­em­atician!”."
