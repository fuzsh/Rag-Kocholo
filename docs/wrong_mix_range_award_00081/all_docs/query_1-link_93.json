        "text": "July 22, 2021\n\nMeshugah is a Yiddish word which I think means crazy. And there is craziness in the tale of a 27 yo woman who is love with two men - one 20 years older and the other 40 years older. They and a cast of characters are trying to make sense of life in the USA early 1950s, some being holocaust survivors, some who fled prior to WWII and some who experienced being Jewish under Communism.\n\nThe narrator seems to have much in common with the author as he also deals with his sense of morality, the meaning of religion and what is God.\n\nJune 27, 2023\n\nBu kitapla ilgili hislerim çok karışık. Öncelikle arka kapağında söylendiği gibi \"New York'tan Paris'e oradan da Tel Aviv'e uzanan\" bir hikaye değil. Kitabın 2/3'ü New York'ta, son kısmı Tel Aviv'de bir evde geçiyor, Paris göz açıp kapayana kadar geçen bir durak sadece.\n\nKahramanımız Aaron, herkesin hayran olduğu bir yazar, Holokost sırasında ailesini kaybetmiş ve Polonya'dan Amerika'ya göç etmiş. Yidiş dilinde tefrika ettiği romanları var ama aynı zamanda \"Güzin Abla\"msı bir köşesi ya da radyo programı da var - hangisi, net değil. Gayet sıradan bir gün, toplama kamplarında öldüğünü düşündüğü arkadaşı çıkageliyor ve tüm çılgınlık, yani Meşuga, başlıyor.\n\nŞimdi buraya kadar benim çok seveceğim ve çok ilgimi çekecek bir hikaye gibi duruyordu. Ama yani okudukça gördüm ki pek de bir çılgınlık yok? Büyük acılar, kayıplar yaşanmış olduğu için akabinde hippiliğin çıkmasına benzer bir yer-içer-gezer-sevişiriz durumu var gibi ama aynı zamanda herkes yokluk içinde, olduğu yerde duruyor, ama bir yandan da çok zenginler de söz konusu. Şunu da not edeyim, nedense tüm ama TÜM kadın karakterler anında Aaron’a aşık oluyor, “benim olacaksın” minvalinden şeyler söylüyor adama daha tanışır tanışmaz neredeyse. Herkes kendisine ve yazarlığına hayran ama kimse de onu tanımıyor bir yandan. Bu yüzden de karakter bana inandırıcı gelmedi açıkçası okudukça.\n\nEn \"çılgın\" olması istenen karakter Miriam olmuş, kendinden yaşça çok büyük iki adama aynı anda “aşık”, birinin metresi olmayı kabul etmiş, bir yandan da çocuk sahibi olmak istiyor... Ee, en büyük çılgınlık bir karakterin iki adama \"ait olmayı\" kabul etmesi mi yani? Ara ara anlaşılıyor ki Miriam, Hitler döneminde bazı karanlık şeyler yapmış, fakat bunlar pek açıklanmıyor; öte yandan kendisinin de deli bir kocası var ama aslında yok gibi... Anlaşılan ortada bir \"açık ilişki\" isteme durumu var, bu güzelce inşa edilse ve karakterlerin yaşadıkları üzerinden bize aktarılsa tamam ama o da yok. Sonra hem evlilik istemeyip ama bir yandan da bir Yahudilik ritüeli gerçekleştirip yazarımıza \"şimdi seninle evlendim\" diyen de, bunun akabinde metresliğe seve isteye devam eden, hatta \"o benim hem babam hem kocam\" diyen de Miriam? Ama bütün bunların nedeni ne? Holokost sırasında yaşadıkları mı? Kötü biri olması, insanlarla eğlenmek istemesi, kendini kaybetmiş olması, hiçbir şeyin umrunda olmaması mı? Bilmiyoruz.\n\nKitapta aynı gün ya da gecede çok şey oluyor ama bir yandan hiçbir şey de olmuyor. Bir sürü Yahudi geleneği, kitabı, kuralı, örfü, adeti araya serpiştirilmiş ama o kültürü çok az bilen biri olarak benim aklında hemen hemen hiçbir şey kalmadı. Bir de herkes birbiriyle neden bağırarak konuşuyor çözemedim.\n\nKitabın sonlarına kadar bence iki boyutlu kalmış Miriam karakteri tam ilginçleşiyor, evet bir twist geliyor ve hikaye böylece açılıp tadından yenmez olacak derken olay birdenbire çok alakasız bir yere bağlanıyor. Yine bolca Yahudilere ve Yahudiliğe ait bilgiler var bu arada, sadece bazısına dipnot verilmiş; bir sürü Yidişçe kelime var, sadece bazısının açıklaması yapılmış. Yidişçenin ne menem bir dil olduğuna, nasıl bir kültürü temsil ettiğine dair sadece bir cümlelik bir açıklama var ama o da en sonlarda. E bizim yazarımız inatla bu dili yaşatarak, bu dilde eserler vermiyor muydu?\n\nHiçbir karakterini sevmediğim, hele Miriam'ı adeta boğazlamak istediğim, kimin neyi neden yaptığının anlaşılmadığı, çok şey oluyormuş gibi görünürken gerçekten hiçbir şeyin olmadığı bir kitap Meşuga. Ve bence maalesef meşugalığı buradan da gelmiyor.\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\nMeshugah, or insane in Yiddish, was the title given by the author to this edited novel after it was originally called “Lost souls”.\n\nAaron Greidinger is a Jewish writer who left Poland to America before the Second World War. He writes in Yiddish to the New York newspaper. In his mid-forties he meets a long forgotten acquaintance, Max Aberden, who brings him back to the community of Holocaust survivors living in New York, re-establishes old lost connection to women who once were Aaron’s lovers, and introduces to a 27-years old Miriam and involves in the relationship triangle.\n\nBook has many references to the pre-war Warsaw and Jews who lived there and perished. Yiddish and Polish words and traditions are a natural part of the plot and make it authentic, although also nostalgic.\n\nMay 4, 2018\n\nTre stelle perche' Singer scrive benissimo come sempre, ma devo dire che il significato di questo libro stavolta mi sfugge: il mondo e' un grande circo? Non a caso Singer cambio' il titolo \"Anime perdute\" in Meshugah, che in yiddish significa pazzo...\n\nAmbientato negli anni 50, ovviamente e' pieno di riferimenti all'Olocausto appena successo, e nonostante la leggerezza della conversazioni, e' sempre presente il dolore, lo sgomento ed i pensieri suicidi dei sopravvissuti.\n\nSono contenta di averlo letto ma sinceramente sono ancora perplessa: forse non c'e' un significato recondito, forse Singer voleva solo dirci che ormai tutto il mondo e' \" Meshugah\".\n\nOhibo'.\n\nApril 26, 2010\n\nThe opening line is fantastic--\"It happened more than once that someone I thought had died in Hitler's camps suddenly turned up alive and well.\"\n\nI just wasn't feeling the rest of it, though. I've read a number of his short stories and really liked them, but this story is not really very interesting to me. It also seems to have lost something in translation, which I suppose is to be expected, but disappointing all the same. There's one part in particular where Max chides Aaron for addressing him by the formal 'you' when he should be using 'thou', but since we don't speak that way in English anymore, Aaron continues using 'you' and I suppose we're meant to understand that he is now addressing Max informally. I would probably like this better if I could read it in Yiddish.\n\nAugust 29, 2021\n\nVery interesting as are all Singer's books. The name of the serialized version of this book is Lost Souls. This name fits the story better than Meshugah which means crazy, senseless, or insane. The sorrow of the holocaust is everywhere throughout this book.\n\nDecember 15, 2017\n\nNem mondom, hogy életem legnagyobb olvasmányélménye volt, de biztosan gyakran eszembe fog jutni ez a könyv.\n\nMeg az is, hogy milyen hülye vége van.\n\nJanuary 2, 2019\n\nRedakteur einer jiddischen Zeitung teilt sich Geliebte mit einen älteren Herrn.

Bütün bunların rastlantı olduğuna inanıyor musun?\"\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nAugust 22, 2011\n\nMeshugah is a Yiddish word that can mean crazy, senseless, insane. And that is exactly the right title for this work by the late Issac Bashevis Singer. For what we have here is several links between friend and family relations of outrageous craziness, a comedy of post-war, post-holocaust, semi-religious/Jewish/atheistic muddled vision of life. And it circles around an even more muddled love triangle of a young woman, Miriam, who already has a husband, one she can't stand, who is having an affair with an older man, one Max Aberdam, whose friendship with Aaron Greidinger, a 47 year old writer for a magazine, 'Forward', gets more complicated as Miriam starts to eye him and loves him “equally” with Max.\n\nAaron has his own muddled life. A Jew turned atheist. Aaron bounces between a serial novel he's trying to complete on time at his New York Newspaper (3; 123), and a radio advice show which he does not always give heartfelt and true convicted answers to (181). His life is the runaway train that we ride though the maze of other characters who weave in and out of the novel. One of the ways Singer peppers and shapes our impressions of his story is through the ingenious use of dialogue. The dialogues dance their way across the pages, and his sense of that Jewishness, that old world, come to New York familiarity comes through very strongly. In fact, while Singer employs narration as much as he gives to his dialogues, I felt that if I only had the dialogues between the many characters that Aaron comes in contact with, the result would be much more stunning.\n\nFrom Max's grumblings about an unjust God (which he claims not to believe in due to his experience of the pogroms in his native Poland. See example pgs. 37-38), to the outrageous Priva, whose being a hypochondriac is alchemically mixed with her claims of being a clairvoyant medium who, “receives vibrations from the spirits.” (6, ), and to the almost incidental character, to the young son, Edek, the child of Irka Shmelkes, who also holds contradictory beliefs and ideas, and yet, shares a sort of philosophy about life that the adults seem to possess throughout the novel. At his introduction, he exclaims, “I belong to an organization which denies that the earth is round...There are only about forty of us, but we have been discussing the question thoroughly.” (22).\n\nBut later on in the same conversation, he seems quite rational when he discusses the dichotomy between the treatment of Jews during the holocaust, and the non-reaction by the Jews, which is a dichotomy itself of his world view:\n\n“Mama, one day you'll learn the truth, but it will be too late. How did it happen that six million Jews went like sheep to the slaughter? How did it happen that the very same nations who during the Holocaust did not even raise a hint of a protest are the nations that later voted to establish Jewish state?” (24)\n\nHe ends his argument by returning to his fascination with things the other people in the room think is nonsense, “Mama, may I tell Mr. Greidinger about the wristwatch?”\n\nNo, Edek.” [Irka said].\n\n“Mr. Greidinger writes about demons. He may find the story useful.” (ibid.)\n\nEdik's attempt to piece two competing, one logical, the other, seemingly illogical to the point of ridiculousness, is a common theme, or, “Meshugah”, of the novel. I say seemingly because while going through the novel, there is almost a sense to everything that comes out in the end. Note this very funny exchange between Tzlova, one of Priva's friends, and Max. It's a perfect example how Singer's dialogue ingeniously wraps a true sense of the world through the eyes of those infected with “Meshugah”:\n\n“Tzlova is the best cook in existence,” Priva said approvingly. “Whatever she eats tastes as if it were made in Paradise.”\n\n“There's nothing to it”Tzlova said. “All you need is browned flour and fried onions, and I add a carrot, parsley, and dill. Browned-lour soup is good served with klops [meat loaf: brackets. By translator].”\n\n“Stop talking, Tzlova. Listening to you makes my mouth water,” Max shouted. “The doctor told me to lose twenty pounds. How can I think of losing when you bring up all these delicacies?”\n\n“What did people eat in China?” Tzlova asked.\n\n“Ah, who knows what they ate-fried cockroaches with duck sauce. I spoke to a Galician recently, and when the talk turned around to food, he said that in his shetl they used to eat kilishr and pompeches.”\n\n“What kind of plague is this?” Priva asked.\n\n“I have no idea,” Max answered. (15-16)\n\nWhile Miriam and Aaron's love affair against his best friend, Max, is supposed to be the center of the story, I happen to believe that Singer's intent and the actual product, are at odds with each other. Rather than concentrating on the love triangle, all of the peripheral elements of he story, especially the dialogue, which I can't praise enough, are in themselves such a commentary as to the emotional, mental, religious (or lack thereof), constitutes to me the notion that the love triangle, which does take more prominent form by end of the first half, as Max leaves America for Poland, in order to get away from investors who are convinced he has been cheating him (91), the construct is firmly set in this reader's mind, as I got caught in the whirlpool of even more of the wayward bopping about, looking for meaning and truth. This is not to suggest a flaw, in fact, by the end o the novel one can say that there has been an honest attempt by the players to find some solace in the friendships ans bonds that surround our main characters. As to whether or not they will abandon their type of meshugah, it is hard to say, and only the reader is left to decide for themselves. This is not a drawback, nor does it change my rating of the work. It is a quest for some sign of certitude in meaning that these individuals find themselves, grabbing at their own meshugahs, tossing it around, and finding out what comes out in the end.\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\nMeshugah is another book I discovered at yet another used bookstore, going out of business sale. It sat on my shelf for a while and I am so glad I finally read it. It is not Singer’s best work, but it does capture you and pull you along.. While I was surprised at how many Yiddish words I know (thanks to my dear parents z’’l) and how many references to Jewish history and the Torah and Talmud I understood, it could use a glossary. It’s another book that makes me grab my phone to look up things.\n\nBut what I really wish, is that it had an accompanying recipe book!\n\nSeptember 3, 2020\n\nНеплохая история. В ней много шарма и обаяния. Порочная, игривая молодая девушка, два старика-интеллигента, еврейская тусовка в Америке.\n\nИ все было бы хорошо, если бы не чудовищные диалоги. Особенно реплики главной героини - Мириам. Меня не покидало ощущение, что в ироничный фильм Вуди Аллена вдруг ворвалась Рената Литвинова и начала заламывать руки, ахать и охать, и говорить так, будто вот-вот упадет в обморок.\n\nЯ готова поверить, что дело в переводе. И когда представляю себе эти же реплики на идиш, то мне кажется, они звучат вполне естественно и мило. Но на русском это пытка.\n\nAugust 8, 2017\n\nMás que la historia, es ese Nueva York lleno de refugiados, con personas tan diversas pero que a la vez tienen un pasado en común. Un Hitler.\n\nSiempre es interesante aprender sobre una comunidad tan particular como la judía, que ha sido encasillada y juzgada y pocas veces comprendida.\n\nAugust 8, 2017\n\nDisfrutamos con las obras de literatura precisamente porque no nos exigen ninguna responsabilidad. Podemos abrir y cerrar los libros cuando queramos. No estamos llamados a consolar al que sufre ni a tenderle una mano.\n\nSeptember 27, 2020\n\nI enjoyed this book about Jewish immigrants.\n\nOctober 17, 2021\n\nWow! I hadn't read IB Singer in decades and had no idea what I'd been missing.\n\nDecember 18, 2021\n\ncomfort book. picked this up on a whim from strand and do not regret it for a second\n\nMarch 3, 2024\n\nMaybe I’ll try this book again when I’m older, just to hard for me still I guess\n\nSeptember 15, 2017\n\nUg. No. I love books with Jewish culture but this one confused and bored me to death.\n\nAugust 21, 2021\n\nI was very surprised that this book won the Nobel prize for literature. While I liked the world view of the main character, Aaron, who is fixated on telling stories about the ghetto existence and Jewish culture of the areas wiped out by the Nazis, the overall pace of the characters was very frantic- almost always-- and it was hard to believe that every one in his life moved at that pace.\n\nJuly 26, 2016\n\nTitle: Isaac Bashevis Singer Meshugah\n\nTranslated by: the author and Nili Wachtel\n\nPages: 240\n\nPublisher: June 16th 2003 by Farrar Straus Giroux (first published April 1994)\n\nIsbn: 0374529094 (ISBN13: 9780374529093)\n\n“MESHUGAH (me-shug-a) ---Yiddish word meaning crazy, senseless, insane.”\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer Meshugah tells an insane story of a triangular love relationship of a married man Max, Aaron, a popular writer and a woman name Miriam. They were the Jewish of whom survived the Holocaust in Warsaw, Poland. However the plot does not take place in Warsaw, but at Upper East Side of New York City in the 1900s. This novel expressively focuses on Miriam’s experiences in the past mingled with modern life in New York City. Interestingly, the story is told from the first person’s point of view from Aaron, the writer.\n\nThis book is a great book not only did it shows a writer’s mind-set after a horrifying life experience at age of sixty, but also roars with a vigorous voice in doubting his religion, and his belief in God. Singer explicitly challenges his faith in God, whereby he implies a lot of philosophical questions such that “If one does not believe in a personal God or in sexual morality, how can there be any repentance?...What has really changed from ancient times? The idol worshippers are still with us and so are the idols. What was Hitler if not an idol? and Stalin? ...Could God cause some sort of renewal in the world? But why would it be any different when the people were people as before?” Singer also utilizes many quotations from Spinoza in suspicions of God’s existence, “there were no lies, only distorted truths. Even a worm has its own small truth. it is born, it lives briefly, then it is trampled under someone’s foot.” (Wachtel, 95-97). When one has experienced unbearable pain in the past, one will question their faith because one has lost his or her trust in God.\n\nTo my curiosity, I was wondering who Isaac Bashevis Singer was and I did some research on him. I found out that Singer indeed was a survivor during the Holocaust period in which he escaped Warsaw and immigrated to New York. He became a famous writer in writing Yikkish literature, and short stories. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature and Meshugah is one of the novel that has been translated in English. Similarly, Elie Wiesel at Night had been through the same journey that Singer encountered during Holocaust. Parallelly, Wiesel was a religious man when he was a child at the beginning of the novel Night; however after he was tortured through Holocaust, he lost his faith in his God. He questioned God’s justice in giving an evil leader the privilege to entirely swipe out another human race. These survivors from the Holocausts send out a strong message of that every man has the capacity to be an evil leader, and nothing will stop tragedies from happening despite one self’s vigorous faith in God.\n\nI think that this book is perfect for atheists and people who question what they believe in. They might find answers or they can find connections. This book is a little bit senseless in which it contains humongous concepts mixed with religion, the Holocaust, and the lifestyle of Jewish people in New York City back in the 1900s just to name a few. This is another book in replacement of Night by Elie Wiesel because both book corresponds in particular themes in either religion or experiences in general. I would recommend this book for young adults or adults only.\n\nAugust 29, 2016\n\nYou'd think he'd have a more cohesive message than, \"The world is just crazy.\" You're 79. You came though the Holocaust. You were living in post-post diaspora New York. Can you write something more meaningful than this book? The narrator goes around with a lot of girls enamoured of his writing. He has an affair with a lady who worked the oldest profession to save herself from Nazi atrocities. He goes to Israel. He returns to New York.\n\nEven if there are no answers to the big question post-Holocaust of WTF, there are no answers here to any of the smaller questions either. Why all the affairs with married women? What is it with Jewish anarchists?\n\nMaybe it's asking a lot, but this guy won the Nobel Prize for Literature, ok? A Jewish thought leader in his time. Who better to tackle a big, sensitive subject? I felt this story was lazy. Strange, even exciting things happened, but there was no real punchline, no payoff pitch. You get that with Stephen King, for example. Even in Barkskins, an amazing book, you get a larger realization that the earth itself is the only character that matters in human history. What a revelation. You don't have anything like that here.\n\nThere was more emotional payoff in Everything is Illuminated. I think Foer is trying to be this generation's Singer. Both are vegetarians!\n\nI think I will try Gimpel the Fool next, or Yentl. I'm bummed because I grew up in Surfside, FL, and remember what a big deal it was when I.B. Singer came to town.\n\nDecember 29, 2014\n\nThis was my first Singer novel, and I must say I was mildly disappointed. Some of the flaws were probably unavoidable due to the serialized nature of the original novel, but more importantly I didn't find many of the characters interesting.\n\nIn particular, the narrator was infuriatingly passive throughout the novel. Everyone else spoke to him in paragraphs, and he barely got a word in edgewise. I realize that this was an intentional character trait, but ultimately I didn't care much about this ephemeral character.\n\nThe other male protagonist started off as a very strong character, but he got sick halfway through the story and didn't contribute much from that point onward.\n\nThe female protagonist was truly a unique character and by far the most interesting of the lot. I didn't always find her motivations or actions believable, but nevertheless I enjoyed her presence in the book.\n\nThis novel certainly wasn't bad, and I do want to take another stab at reading Singer. I would really like to read something of his that did not start out as a serialized novel, because Meshugah demonstrated to me the value of a re-write.\n\nJanuary 12, 2016\n\nIl libro narra la storia un po’ strampalata di un ambiguo intreccio di amicizia/amore tra tre individui molto diversi tra loro: una ragazza di 27 anni con un oscuro passato, un vecchio gaudente di 70 anni e uno scrittore di mezza età con il cuore legato al mondo perduto della Polonia ebraica e la mente immersa nella vita newyorchese.\n\nLa storia si svolge tra New York ed Israele nell’ambito della comunità degli ebrei polacchi sfuggiti ai campi di concentramento e rifugiatisi negli Stati Uniti. Dalle pagine del libro traspare il conflitto tra il senso di colpa per essere stati i pochi fortunati a sopravvivere allo sterminio nazista e la bramosia di godere il massimo della vita. Colpisce soprattutto la follia e l’assoluta mancanza di senso morale della maggior parte dei protagonisti.\n\nDi certo non è il miglior libro di Singer.\n\nApril 6, 2008\n\nWhat a strange book...I'm not really sure what I thought of it.It was about a Jewish writer of serialised novels who gets involved with an older friend and his younger mistress, who has been in concentration camps and may have some very dark things in her past. Well written, obviously, but it had a hysterical edge that was a bit unnerving. I was slightly unsure whether some bits were meant to be funny or not. The central female character's bizarre masochism and the male character's cowardice and misogyny would be easier for me to assess if I could guess whether Singer is intending the reader to see them like that. Still, the ambiguity could well be intentional, and there's a lot to think about in this book."
