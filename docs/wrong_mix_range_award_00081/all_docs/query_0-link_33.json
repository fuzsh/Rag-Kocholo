        "text": "March 3, 2023\n\nRead with the Short Story Club\n\nThe short story Gimpel The Fool Was written by Isaac Bashevis Singer, a Polish-born Jewish writer. It was originally written in Yiddish and the version I read was translated in English by Saul Bellow.\n\nGimpel is a simple minded baker who is mocked by the people in the Polish village where he lives. ‚ÄúI am Gimpel the fool. I don‚Äôt think myself a fool. On the contrary. But that‚Äôs what folks call me. \" Despite the ordeal, he keeps his faith in human beings and in God. He continues to believe everything he is told, even raising the clearly illegitimate child of his wife as his own.\n\nTo me, Gimpel knows that he is fooled and he chooses to believe the lies because he prefers the outcome. He wants to see the good in people and he chooses to live as a good person. An idea which was raised in the club is that he might also see himself as a ‚Äúsacrificial lamb‚Äù who will be rewarded in Heaven.\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\n‚úçüèª Isaac Bashevis Singer is a great writer. He used to be much better known and more widely read. Just like Saul Bellow and Philip Roth and John Cheevers and Walker Percy, etcetera, who all used to be much better known and widely read. Literature marches on and readers‚Äô tastes and inclinations march on with it.\n\nBut the books remain. The stories remain. He won the Nobel for Literature in 1978. I‚Äôve read a lot of Singer in the past and I‚Äôm going to return to some of his novels and short stories this August and fall.\n\nHe wrote his fiction in Yiddish. And you certainly pick up on that spirit when you read his works. This is especially so when his stories are rendered by as consummate a narrator as I enjoyed with these audio versions, Theodore Bikel. Yes, it‚Äôs like Tevye relating his tangles and woes and hopes in Fiddler on the Roof, himself a creation of the author Sholem Aleichem in his novel Tevye‚Äôs Daughters.\n\nAll but one of the tales in this short collection are magical realism - ghosts, and visions of the talking dead while characters are awake or dreaming, are important. One of the stories is outright macabre horror from which, for the hapless protagonists, there is no escape or redemption. But for The Black Wedding the stories are HEA in their own unique and unusual ways.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt dipped into Singer‚Äôs works yet, I urge you to treat yourself. He‚Äôs a master storyteller.\n\nGIMPEL THE FOOL\n\nEveryone deceives Gimpel. His wife, the devil, his apprentice, everyone. Yet he plows on without rancor, grudges or bitterness, though he has plenty of reasons to harbor all of that. Well read and well-written in very much a ‚ÄúTevye Yiddishy\" kind of way.\n\nESTHER KREINDEL THE SECOND\n\nWhen a well-loved wife and mother dies she returns in the body of a fourteen-year-old girl, with the girl‚Äôs consent, the girl maturing in a rapid fashion, mentally and physically. She goes to the grieving husband and children of the woman who died and takes her place, an identical copy in every way, baffling all. In this manner, the original and deceased Esther Kreindel becomes Esther Kreindel the Second and brings peace, joy and love back to her husband and children.\n\nTHE SPINOZA OF MARKET STREET\n\nA shriveled old loner, who holds a doctorate in philosophy, hides away in an attic room reading Spinoza's ethics, cutting himself off from society. But when a woman steps into his world, marries him, then appears in a silk nightgown on their wedding night, the natural laws of cause and effect Spinoza espoused take dynamic effect and the old man rises from the dead.\n\nTHE BLACK WEDDING\n\nThe most astonishing story. A deep dark midnight story.\n\nA horror story. When a daughter's parents are taken by dybbuks her marriage to a rabbi's son is arranged. But when she first sees him under the wedding canopy she realizes immediately that he is a monster. She cannot escape. His entire family is composed of demons. And they maliciously and gleefully prevail over her. She is doomed.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJanuary 20, 2023\n\nI can‚Äôt work out what to make of this tragi-comic Jewish fable, originally written in Yiddish. It opens:\n\n‚ÄúI am Gimpel the fool. I don‚Äôt think myself a fool. On the contrary. But that‚Äôs what folks call me.‚Äù\n\nGimpel tells his story: an orphan raised by bakers who is always a target of pranksters and leg-pullers. The pranks and lies are a mix of comic and cruel.\n\n‚ÄúI like a golem believed everyone.‚Äù\n\nEventually, he vows to believe nothing, but that‚Äôs just as confusing, so he goes to the rabbi, who tells him:\n\n‚ÄúIt is written, better to be a fool all your days than for one hour to be evil. You are not a fool. They are the fools.‚Äù\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt seem very helpful either.\n\nImage: A golem (Source)\n\nAnd then the meat of the story begins. Apparently willingly and happily, Gimpel goes along with a huge lie - and the smaller ones that spring from it. Year after year. Is he a fool, ludicrously devout and kind, or just telling a tale?\n\n‚ÄúThe rabbi recently said to me, ‚ÄòBelief in itself is beneficial. It is written that a good man lives by his faith‚Äô.‚Äù\n\nGimpel evolves his own philosophy:\n\n‚ÄúThe longer I lived the more I understood that there were really no lies. Whatever doesn‚Äôt really happen is dreamed at night. It happens to one if it doesn‚Äôt happen to another, tomorrow if not today, or a century hence if not next year. What difference can it make? Often I heard tales of which I said, ‚ÄòNow this is a thing that cannot happen.‚Äô But before a year had elapsed I heard that it actually had come to pass somewhere.‚Äù\n\nIt reminded me of this, from The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy:\n\n‚ÄúA solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying.‚Äù\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nGimpel is so relentlessly optimistic and forgiving - if we're to believe what he tells us - that I find him frustrating. But his fluctuating philosophy about the meaning of truth is more interesting.\n\nSinger left Poland for the US shortly before the start of WW2 and wrote this in 1957, set in Poland. As it happens entirely within a Jewish community, I‚Äôm not convinced it‚Äôs an allegory of persecution and murder of Jews in Europe during that war. But it probably references many aspects of Jewish folklore and the Torah that I didn‚Äôt notice.\n\nImage: Challah loaf, sprinkled with caraway (and sesame) seeds (Source)\n\nShort story club\n\nI read this as one of the stories in The Art of the Short Story, by Dana Gioia, from which I'm aiming to read one story a week with The Short Story Club, starting 2 May 2022.\n\nYou can read this story here.\n\nYou can join the group here.\n\nJanuary 12, 2023\n\nGimpel the baker is known in his Jewish village in Poland for his gullible nature. He had been an orphan with no one to protect him, and he is tricked by the townspeople because he is a trusting person. One gets the impression that he knows he's being deceived, but deliberately chooses to go along with it in the way a jester or fool would in a king's court. His trusting nature often worked to his advantage. Gimpel the Fool seems to represent a schlemiel, one who has goodness and innocence, in this Yiddish parable.\n\nThe rabbi told him, \"It is written, better to be a fool all your days than for one hour to be evil. You are not a fool. They are the fools. For he who causes his neighbor to feel shame loses Paradise himself.\"\n\nAfter Gimpel's wife dies, he travels as a storyteller and makes up his own fiction about the world. He feels that everything, even improbable events, will eventually happen somewhere. Gimpel is a kind man who is open to all possibilities. The truth is not as important to him as the effect of an event on people's hearts.\n\nOn his deathbed, Gimpel has a moment of deep faith:\n\n\"No doubt the world is entirely an imaginary world, but it is only once removed from the true world. . . When the time comes, I will go joyfully. Whatever may be there, it will be real, without complication, without ridicule, without deception. God be praised: there even Gimpel cannot be deceived.\"\n\nJanuary 24, 2023\n\n3.5‚òÖ\n\n‚ÄúAnd I like a golem* believed everyone. In the Ô¨Årst place, everything is possible, as it is written in the Wisdom of the Fathers. I‚Äôve forgotten just how. Second, I had to believe when the whole town came down on me! If I ever dared to say, ‚ÄòAh, you‚Äô re kidding!‚Äô there was trouble. People got angry. ‚ÄòWhat do you mean! You want to call everyone a liar?‚Äô What was I to do? I believed them, and I hope at least that did them some good. [golem=simpleton]‚Äù\n\nBoth the author and the translator won the Nobel Prize for Literature, Singer in 1978, and Bellow in 1976. Singer preferred to write in Yiddish and later translated his own work, but this one was translated by Saul Bellow (who was talked into it). But I digress.\n\nIt is disguised as a folktale about a simple baker, a man who is easily fooled by outrageous lies and jokes and pranks. I‚Äôm sure there are studies and theses written about Gimpel, the woman with the ‚Äúlittle brother‚Äù whom he is convinced to marry, and the townsfolk, sneering and laughing behind their hands as more children are added to the family.\n\n‚ÄúI went to the rabbi to get some advice. He said, ‚ÄòIt is written, better to be a fool all your days than for one hour to be evil. You are not a fool. They are the fools. For he who causes his neighbor to feel shame loses Paradise himself.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nI am sure there are theses and dissertations written about various aspects of this story, since it‚Äôs a kind of parable. There is a lot of information online. I found it interesting, but not a favourite.\n\nAnother from the Short Story Club Group. You can find a PDF of the story here: https://images.shulcloud.com/4182/upl...\n\nJanuary 14, 2023\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶he who causes his neighbor to feel shame loses Paradise himself.‚Äù\n\nLike all good fables, this story is simple on the surface. A bullied boy gets manipulated into decisions and is seen as a fool throughout his life. But is he really a fool? And what is the best approach to take when we have been duped? How much of our life is impacted by the ‚Äútruth,‚Äù and how much by our imagination? Lots to think about with this one.\n\nAugust 15, 2019\n\nI've been reading a lot of mediocre short stories for this class.\n\nPoor Gimpel. He really is abused by the max by so many people here. And the ending just felt... incredibly dissatisfying for all the abuse and struggles he faces at these cruel people's hands.\n\nNot sure what I make of the ending, or what to really take away from this story after everything that happens?\n\nSo I here I sit. Not really making much of this other than it was okay, and the message... uh. I need to think on it some more I guess?\n\nJanuary 18, 2023\n\n‚Ä¶the longer I lived the more I understood that there were really no lies. Whatever doesn‚Äôt really happen is dreamed at night. It happens to no one if it doesn‚Äôt happen to another, tomorrow if not today, or a century hence if not next year. What difference can it make? Often I heard tales of which I said, ‚ÄúNow this is a thing which cannot happen.‚Äù But before a year had elapsed I heard that it actually had come to pass somewhere.\n\nNo doubt the world is entirely an imaginary world, but is only once removed from the true world.\n\nI loved this short story about Gimpel. (Originally written in Yiddish) Is Gimpel a fool? Or does he open his mind to more possibilities than the other residents of their small town?\n\nWhat is true and what is not? Spirituality? Dreams? Stories?\n\nSo many layers, humor, and a strong MC.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 5, 2023\n\n7/10\n\nThis felt like a too-contrived folktale. All the bigger issues become submersed in the \"foolish-ery\".\n\nJanuary 20, 2023\n\nAlthough I enjoyed this classic story translated from Yiddish to English, I must admit to wondering what exactly was the moral of this fable-like short story.\n\nWhile I could suggest a number of answers, the always familiar of ‚Äúgood triumphs evil‚Äù is applicable in so many ways here. But like so many classics I think the author intended the reader to take from it any of your own interpretations of good over evil.\n\nGimpel was a fool and yet knowingly so he continues to serve his family and community. He loves his children despite that they are not of him. In his own way he loves and takes care of his wife despite that she continues to be unfaithful. While he considers his options for revenge, he comes to realize that is not who he really is or wants to be. He is rewarded, of sorts, with a successful business and a long life, and he remains true to himself regardless of what others say or think.\n\nTruly a parable, the lessons of which in many ways remain applicable today.\n\nThis was read as part of the GR Short Story Club .\n\nNovember 4, 2018\n\nI enjoyed having this story read to me. Gimpel, ever sanguine, demonstrates the concept of acceptance of fate, or a faith of elephantine proportions.\n\nSlept through this short tale three times before I heard the story in its entirety. Not boring, just soothing narration!\n\nNovember 14, 2018\n\ndepressing. Gimpel is passive and so am I.\n\nbut also no excuse for others to be so mean to him\n\nhe dies w/ clear conscience praising God i guess idk hard to know what to make of him.\n\nboring\n\nJanuary 11, 2019\n\nGimpel didn't ask for any of this.\n\nApril 17, 2022\n\nFour stories by Isaac Bashevis Singer. I listened to the book on audible.com with the great actor Theodore Bikel narrating. It was fabulous!!!!\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nI will defend Gimpel till I die I love him\n\nMarch 2, 2022\n\nIt probably loses something contextually in translation. The story is also a little out of time for a 21st century reading.\n\n3.5/5\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\nIt is a pleasure to read the three versions of Simple Gimpl, a short tale by the Noble Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer (1902-1991): the original in Yiddish by Singer., the translation into English by Singer and David Stromberg, and the translation by Noble Prize-winning author Saul Bellow (1915-2005). Each of the three has subtle differences from the other two. The book includes Liana Finck's fanciful drawings and David Stromberg's Afterword. This 2022 tale edition was first published in 1945 as Gimpl tam.\n\nI disagree with David Stromberg‚Äôs analysis of the tale. He compares Gimpl with a story by the famous Hassidic Rebbe Nahman of Bratslav (1772-1810), where the Rebbe‚Äôs protagonist lost faith. Stromberg sees Singer‚Äôs character, who is a fool, according to Bellow‚Äôs translation, or a simpleton in Singer‚Äôs, as a man who has faith. He is continually dupped because he is either a fool or simple. There is no indication that he has faith.\n\nGimpl is a baker with a low level of intelligence. He recognizes that he is continually fooled and that people laugh at his foolishness. They play tricks on him frequently. The story focuses on the worst trick. People persuade Gimpl that the town‚Äôs pregnant prostitute is a virgin who is in love with him and wants to marry him. They claim that a youngster living with her is not her child but her brother. He believes them, goes to her, and proposes marriage.\n\nShe tells him she would only agree if she is given a dowry. When Gimpl says he understands that the bride‚Äôs family provides the groom with the dowry, she persuades him that her situation is different. The town jokers gather enough money to satisfy the prostitute, and the two marry. However, whenever Gimpl tries to consummate their relationship, she finds an excuse, such as an illness. So, Gimpl has to sleep at the bakery.\n\nFour months pass, she gives birth, insisting the child is Gimpl‚Äôs. When Gimpl wonders how it is possible to bear a child after four months, she persuades him that it is possible. As time passes, Gimpl sees a man lying with her in her bed. She convinces him that he did not see what he thinks he saw. Later, she has another child. Gimpl sees his assistant baker in bed with her and is fooled again.\n\nIf David Stromberg is correct in saying that Singer‚Äôs tale is teaching us about faith, Singer must say that having faith, relying on and acting on ideas that are contrary or not proven by logic, is foolish. People should not rely on faith. They should seek to improve their knowledge and intelligence. He would say that people who rely on faith are fools, and Soren Kierkegaard, who advised people to take a ‚Äúleap of faith‚Äù whenever they face situations they cannot understand, are being duped. Rationalists would say this is sound philosophy.\n\nStromberg may be right in giving this tale this interpretation. But I doubt it.\n\nRather than comparing Gimpl with Nahman‚Äôs tale, it should be compared with Isaac Leybush Peretz‚Äôs (also known as I. L. Peretz, 1852-1915) magnificent Yiddish short story Bontshe Shveig, in English Bontshe the Silent. It is a sad story about a poor man and what happens to him after death. It is like Gimpl, a tale about people who suffer tragedies they cannot understand. It is a masterpiece. Bontshe did not understand what was happening to him. Even when he died, was in heaven, and was offered a reward for living a good life, he only asked for bread. The angels were embarrassed, and the devil roared with laughter. Peretz and not Singer should have been given the Noble Prize for literature for Bontshe the Silent, If Not Higher, and all the many others.\n\nGimpl should also be compared to Gustave Flaubert‚Äôs A Simple Soul (1821-1880). Flaubert is widely recognized as a brilliant classical writer known for his masterpiece, Madam Bovary. Like Peretz, he can capture the essence of people and describe it interestingly. People should read classics such as Madam Bovary and this story; they are considered classics because they have withstood time and are enjoyed even today.\n\nA Simple Soul is filled with pathos. Flaubert explores the tragic and sad situation of many simple people who lack sufficient intelligence to participate fully in life around them. They are ignored and secluded. They live an unrewarded life. Theologians address the issue: Why would God create such people? How does God relate to them?\n\nIt is about Felicite, a simple, uneducated woman with a low IQ, who is, like many simple people, perfect at what she does; she is the ideal maid, highly respected for her work, a maid everyone would be happy to have. We read about her first love and sympathize with her, how she saves her mistress but is then exploited, and her reactions to religion, upon which she relies but doesn‚Äôt understand, like Gimpl and Bontshe. Flaubert describes her yearnings, fears, reactions to death, sublimated and highly unusual love for a parrot, and final unfortunate years.\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nIt's A Gift To Be Gimpl\n\nIn 1935, the Yiddish writer Issac Bashevis Singer (1903 -- 1991) immigrated from Poland to New York City; his writing received little notice until 1953 when Saul Bellow (1915 -- 2005) translated Singer's 1945 story \"Gimpel the Fool\". The translation established Singer as a writer in America at last. Both Bellow and Singer would enjoy extraordinary careers with Bellow receiving the Nobel Prize in 1976 and Singer receiving it in 1978.\n\n\"Gimpel\" has remained one of Singer's best-known works, and it has provoked different views about its meaning. Issues have been raised about Bellow's translation and about, perhaps, whether it masks some possible readings of the story. Late in his life, Singer was working on his own translation of \"Gimpel\"; his draft was found by David Stromberg, a writer and the editor of the Isaac Bashevis Singer Literary Trust. Stromberg also was working on a translation of \"Gimpel\" and he combined his efforts with those of the incomplete draft of Singer.\n\nThis delightful little book \"Simple Gimpl: The Definitive Bilingual Edition\" (2023) includes the translations of \"Gimpel\" by Singer/Stromberg and the translation by Bellow. It also includes the original Yiddish text of the story for those who read the language (I am not among them) and perhaps to remind those who don't know Yiddish of the foreign character of the story. The book also includes color illustrations by artist Liana Finck, an introductory note by Ilan Stavans, and an Afterword by Stromberg. The book offers much to think about.\n\nIn addition to focusing on Singer's story, the book captures the difficulty of translation and interpretation in the two English versions. Stromberg's version explains what he sees as the difference as Bellow's version, titled \"Gimpel the Fool\" seems to suggest that the story, narrated by Gimpel is a \"fool's tale\" while Singer/Stromberg's version is titled \"Simple Gimpl\" suggesting the layers of complexity and meaning in the story and in the narrator's character. It is valuable to read both versions of the short story several times and to compare them. There are differences between the two translations, but I found Stromberg may go too far in separating them as the irony and complexity he finds in the story is also, I found, largely captured in Bellow's translation. Still, the book does not say that one translation is more faithful than the other or that Bellow's celebrated translation is outdated. The two translations tell essentially the same tale with different emphases. This is as it must be with translation.\n\nStromberg's Afterword points out the great influence of the Hassidic Rebbe Nahman of Bratslav upon Singer and upon \"Gimpel\". Rebbe Nahman wrote a profound collection of stories in 1815 one of which is titled \"The Hakham and the Tam\" (\"The Clever Man and the Ordinary Man\") The story contrasts the life of the enlighteed non-believing Jew of Rebbe Nahman's time with the simple Jew who retained his faith. The word \"Tam\" is Singer's word for Gimpel, translated better as \"simple\" or as \"ordinary\" rather than as \"fool\". Still there is warrant for the use of \"fool\" in Bellow's translation. Rebbe Nahman's story tells of the lack of faith, and Stromberg draws a convincing parallel with \"Gimpel\" as this theme is brought forward to post-WWII America.\n\n\"Simple Gimple\" is published by Restless Books, a small, independent non-profit publisher which describes its mission as \"championing essential voices from around the world whose stories speak to us across linguistic and cultural borders. We seek extraordinary international literature for adults and young readers that feeds our restlessness: our hunger for new perspectives, passion for other cultures and languages, and eagerness to explore beyond the confines of the familiar.\" The book fulfills this mission in a most commendable way.\n\nRobin Friedman\n\nAugust 11, 2023\n\nThis whimsically illustrated ‚Äúdefinitive bilingual edition‚Äù of one of Isaac Bashevis Singer‚Äôs first stories is a small, lovely treasure for his fans. Singer‚Äôs own translation is presented first, even though he wrote it after Saul Bellow‚Äôs translation. It was interesting to read of the animus between the two authors. Illuminating anecdotes about Singer‚Äôs literary life appear in the editor‚Äôs note and the afterword. The book is presented in the original Yiddish at the end as well.\n\nSimple Gimpl is the stereotypical simpleton of many folktales who is subject to endless bullying from the people of the village where he lives. Although the village Rabbi treats Gimpl with respect and gives him advice, he is the only one who is the least bit sympathetic (unless you count his mean wife after her death). Gimpl just shrugs his shoulders at most of the abuse, saying to the reader, ‚ÄúWhat can you do?‚Äù It‚Äôs as if he is telling us to have a Zen attitude to the trials and tribulations of life.\n\nFinck‚Äôs colored line drawings offer literal and comical interpretations of the text, and with the feel of New Yorker cartoons.\n\nDue to the bullying, ableism and sexism, I found it hard to read.\n\nJanuary 18, 2023\n\nfool me once, oh the hell with it\n\nMay 23, 2023\n\nI originally thought of Gimpl as autistic but considering the time during which it was written, it does make more sense as his standing in for the Jews in the diaspora.\n\nAugust 21, 2023\n\nFunny short read! I like it! Good!\n\nSeptember 1, 2023\n\nAt first a delightfully childish tale, but one that ends in a surprising twist that left me feeling quite moved‚Ä¶and then pensive. Both translations offer a treasure of narrative.\n\nDecember 14, 2023\n\nüñãÔ∏è An enjoyable short story.\n\nüèÆ Kindle Unlimited.\n\nJuly 5, 2023\n\nWhat makes this book so interesting is that the reader has the opportunity to read two translations from the Yiddish of Singer‚Äôs short story and, if able, to read the original Yiddish version. I knew immediately upon reading the Bellow translation that it would not be as accurate. In the Singer translation I laughed out loud at his saying ‚ÄúHe should rest in pieces‚Äù. That form of Yiddish insult was lost on Bellow.\n\nJune 19, 2012\n\nA story of a simple man who everyone thinks is a fool, but he proves them all wrong. Moving story."
