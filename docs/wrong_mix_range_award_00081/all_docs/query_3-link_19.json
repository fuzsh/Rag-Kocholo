        "text": "There is some doubt as to the actual date of birth - July 14 or July 21, 1902\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5780/isaac-bashevis-singer\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer (Yiddish: יצחק באַשעװיס זינגער; November 21, 1902 (see notes below) – July 24, 1991) was a Polish Jewish American author noted for his short stories. He was one of the leading figures in the Yiddish literary movement, and received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer was born in 1902 in Leoncin village near Warsaw, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. A few years later, the family moved to a nearby Polish town of Radzymin, which is often and erroneously given as his birthplace. The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but most probably it was November 21, 1902, a date that Singer gave both to his official biographer Paul Kresh, and his secretary Dvorah Telushkin. It is also consistent with the historical events he and his brother refer to in their childhood memoirs. The often quoted birth date, July 14, 1904 was made up by the author in his youth, most probably to make himself younger to avoid the draft.\n\nHis father was a Hasidic rabbi and his mother, Bathsheba, was the daughter of the rabbi of Biłgoraj. Singer later used her name in his pen name \"Bashevis\" (Bathsheba's). His elder siblings—brother Israel Joshua Singer (1893–1944) and sister Esther Kreitman (1891–1954)--were also writers. Esther was the first in the family to write stories.\n\nThe family moved to the court of the Rabbi of Radzymin in 1907, where his father became head of the Yeshiva. After the Yeshiva building burned down in 1908, the family moved to Krochmalna Street in the Yiddish-speaking poor Jewish quarter of Warsaw, where Singer grew up. There his father acted as a rabbi — i.e., judge, arbitrator, religious authority and spiritual leader.\n\nWorld War I\n\nIn 1917, because of the hardships of World War I, the family split up. Singer moved with his mother and younger brother Moshe to his mother's hometown of Biłgoraj, a traditional Jewish town or shtetl, where his mother's brothers had followed his grandfather as rabbis. When his father became a village rabbi again in 1921, Singer went back to Warsaw, where he entered the Tachkemoni Rabbinical Seminary and soon decided that neither the school nor the profession suited him. He returned to Biłgoraj, where he tried to support himself by giving Hebrew lessons, but soon gave up and joined his parents, considering himself a failure. In 1923 his older brother Israel Joshua arranged for him to move to Warsaw to work as a proofreader for the Literarische Bleter, of which he was an editor.\n\nUnited States\n\nIn 1935, four years before the German invasion and the Holocaust, Singer emigrated from Poland to the United States due to the growing Nazi threat in neighboring Germany. The move separated the author from his common-law first wife Runia Pontsch and son Israel Zamir (b.1929), who instead went to Moscow and then Palestine (they would meet in 1955). Singer settled in New York, where he took up work as a journalist and columnist for The Forward (פֿאָרװערטס), a Yiddish-language newspaper. After a promising start, he became despondent and felt for some years \"Lost in America\" (title of a Singer novel, in Yiddish from 1974 onward, in English 1981). In 1938, he met Alma Wassermann (born Haimann) {b.1907-d.1996}, a German-Jewish refugee from Munich whom he married in 1940. After the marriage he returned to prolific writing and to contributing to the Forward, using, besides \"Bashevis,\" the pen names \"Varshavsky\" and \"D. Segal.\" They lived for many years in the Belnord on Manhattan's Upper West Side. In 1981, Singer delivered a commencement address at the University at Albany, and was presented with an honorary doctorate.\n\nSinger died on July 24, 1991 in Surfside, Florida, after suffering a series of strokes. He was buried in Cedar Park Cemetery, Emerson. A street in Surfside, Florida is named Isaac Bashevis Singer Boulevard in his honor. The full academic scholarship for undergraduate students at the University of Miami is named in his honor.\n\nWriting\n\nSinger's first published story won the literary competition of the \"literarishe bletter\" and garnered him a reputation as a promising talent. A reflection of his formative years in \"the kitchen of literature\" can be found in many of his later works. I. B. Singer published his first novel Satan in Goray in installments in the literary magazine Globus, which he cofounded with his life-long friend, the Yiddish poet Aaron Zeitlin in 1935. It tells the story of events in 1648 in the village of Goraj (close to Biłgoraj), where the Jews of Poland lost a third of their population in a cruel uprising by Cossacks, and details the effects of the seventeenth-century faraway false messiah Shabbatai Zvi on the local population. Its last chapter imitates the style of medieval Yiddish chronicle. With a stark depiction of innocence crushed by circumstance, the novel appears to foreshadow coming danger. In his later work The Slave (1962), Singer returns to the aftermath of 1648, in a love story between a Jewish man and a Gentile woman, where he depicts the traumatized and desperate survivors of the historic catastrophe with even deeper understanding.\n\nThe Family Moskat\n\nSinger became an actual literary contributor to the Forward only following his older brother's death in 1945, when he published The Family Moskat in his honor. But his own style showed in the daring turns of his action and characters, with (and this in the Jewish family-newspaper in 1945) double adultery in the holiest of nights of Judaism, the evening of Yom Kippur. He was almost forced to stop writing the novel by his legendary editor-in-chief, Abraham Cahan, but was saved by readers who wanted the story to go on. After this, his stories—which he had published in Yiddish literary newspapers before—were printed in the Forward as well. Throughout the 1940s, Singer's reputation grew. After World War II and the near destruction of the Yiddish-speaking peoples, Yiddish seemed to be a dead language. Though Singer had moved to the United States, he believed in the power of his native language and maintained that there was still a large audience that longed to read in Yiddish. In an interview in Encounter (Feb. 1979), he claimed that although the Jews of Poland had died, \"something—call it spirit or whatever—is still somewhere in the universe. This is a mystical kind of feeling, but I feel there is truth in it.\"\n\nSome of his colleagues and readers were shocked by this all-encompassing view of human nature. He wrote about female homosexuality (\"Zeitl and Rickel\" (\"Tseytl un Rikl\") in \"The Seance and Other Stories\"), transvestitism (\"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\" in \"Short Friday\"), and of rabbis corrupted by demons (\"Zeidlus the Pope\" in \"Short Friday\"). In those novels and stories which seem to recount his own life, he portrays himself unflatteringly (with some degree of accuracy) as an artist who is self-centered yet has a keen eye for the sufferings and tribulations of others.\n\nLiterary influences\n\nSinger had many literary influences; besides the religious texts he studied there were the folktales he grew up with and worldly Yiddish detective-stories about \"Max Spitzkopf\" and his assistant \"Fuchs\"; there was Dostoyevsky, whose Crime and Punishment he read when he was fourteen; and he writes about the importance of the Yiddish translations donated in book-crates from America, which he studied as a teenager in Bilgoraj: \"I read everything: Stories, novels, plays, essays...I read Rajsen, Strindberg, Don Kaplanowitsch, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Maupassant and Chekhov.\" He studied many philosophers, among them Spinoza, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Otto Weininger. Among his Yiddish contemporaries Singer himself considered his older brother to be his greatest artistic example; he was a life-long friend and admirer of the author and poet Aaron Zeitlin. Of his non-Yiddish-contemporaries he was strongly influenced by the writings of Knut Hamsun, many of whose works he later translated, while he had more critical attitude towards Thomas Mann, whose approach to writing he considered opposed to his own. Contrary to Hamsun's approach, Singer shaped his world not only with the egos of his characters, but also using the moral commitments of the Jewish tradition that he grew up with and that his father embodies in the stories about his youth. This led to the dichotomy between the life his heroes lead and the life they feel they should lead - which gives his art a modernity his predecessors do not evince. His themes of witchcraft, mystery and legend draw on traditional sources, but they are contrasted with a modern and ironic consciousness. They are also concerned with the bizarre and the grotesque.\n\nAnother important strand of his art is intra-familial strife - which he experienced firsthand when taking refuge with his mother and younger brother at his uncles home in Biłgoraj. This is the central theme in Singer's big family chronicles - like The Family Moskat (1950), The Manor (1967), and The Estate (1969). Some are reminded by them of Thomas Mann's novel Buddenbrooks; Singer had translated Mann's Der Zauberberg (The Magic Mountain) into Yiddish as a young writer.\n\nLanguage\n\nSinger always wrote and published in Yiddish – almost all of it in newspapers – and then edited his novels and stories for their American versions, which became the basis for all other translations; he referred to the English version as his \"second original\". This has led to an ongoing controversy whereby the \"real Singer\" can be found in the Yiddish original, with its finely tuned language and sometimes rambling construction, or in the more tightly edited American version, where the language is usually simpler and more direct. Many of Singer's stories and novels have not yet been translated.\n\nIn the short story form, in which many critics feel he made his most lasting contributions, his greatest influences were Chekhov and Maupassant. From Maupassant, Singer developed a finely grained sense of drama. Like the French master, Singer's stories can pack enormous visceral excitement in the space of a few pages. From Chekhov, Singer developed his ability to draw characters of enormous complexity and dignity in the briefest of spaces. In the foreword to his personally selected volume of his finest short stories he describes the two aforementioned writers as the greatest masters of the short story form,\n\nIllustrators\n\nSeveral respected artists have illustrated Singer’s novels, short stories, and children’s books including Raphael Soyer, Maurice Sendak, Larry Rivers, and Irene Lieblich. Singer personally selected Lieblich to illustrate some of his books for children, including A Tale of Three Wishes and The Power of Light: Eight Stories for Hanukkah after seeing her work in an exhibition at an Artists Equity exhibit in New York. A Holocaust survivor, Lieblich was from Zamosc, Poland, a town adjacent to the area where Singer grew up. As their memories of shtetl life were so similar, Singer found Lieblich’s images ideally suited to illustrate his texts. Of her style, Singer wrote that “her works are rooted in Jewish folklore and are faithful to Jewish life and the Jewish spirit.”\n\nSummary\n\nSinger published at least 18 novels, 14 children's books, a number of memoirs, essays and articles, but is best known as a writer of short stories, which have appeared in over a dozen collections. The first collection of Singer's short stories in English, Gimpel the Fool, was published in 1957. The title story was translated by Saul Bellow and published in May 1953 in the Partisan Review. Selections from Singer's \"Varshavsky-stories\" in the Daily Forward were later published in anthologies such as My Father's Court (1966). Later collections include A Crown of Feathers (1973), with notable masterpieces in between, such as The Spinoza of Market Street (1961) and A Friend of Kafka (1970). His stories and novels reflect the world of the East European Jewry he grew up in. And, after his many years in America, his stories concerned the world of the immigrants and how their American dream proves elusive, sometimes even after they seemed to obtain it.\n\nPrior to winning the Nobel Prize, translations of dozens of his stories were frequently published in popular magazines such as Playboy and Esquire, which attempted to raise their literary reputation by publishing Singer, and he in turn found them to be appropriate outlets for his work.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Singer continued to write on questions of personal morality, and was the target of scathing criticism from many quarters, some of it for not being \"moral\" enough, some for writing stories that no one wanted to hear. To his critics he replied, \"Literature must spring from the past, from the love of the uniform force that wrote it, and not from the uncertainty of the future.\"\n\nSinger was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978.\n\nOne of his most famous novels, due to a popular movie adaptation, was Enemies, a Love Story, in which a Holocaust survivor deals with his own desires, complex family relationships, and a loss of faith. Singer's feminist story \"Yentl\" has had a wide impact on culture since its conversion into popular movie starring Barbra Streisand. Perhaps the most fascinating Singer-inspired film is 1974's Mr. Singer's Nightmare or Mrs. Pupkos Beard by Bruce Davidson, a renowned photographer who became Singer's neighbor. This unique film is a half-hour mixture of documentary and fantasy for which Singer not only wrote the script but played the leading role.\n\nThe 2007 film Love Comes Lately, starring Otto Tausig, was adapted from Singer's stories.\n\nBeliefs\n\nJudaism\n\nSinger's relationship to Judaism was complex and unconventional. He regarded himself as a skeptic and a loner, though he felt a connection to his orthodox roots. Ultimately, he developed a view of religion and philosophy, which he called \"private mysticism: Since God was completely unknown and eternally silent, He could be endowed with whatever traits one elected to hang upon Him.\"\n\nSinger was raised Orthodox and learned all the Jewish prayers, studied Hebrew, and learned Torah and Talmud. As he recounted in the autobiographical \"In My Father's Court\", he broke away from his parents in his early twenties and, influenced by his older brother, who had done the same, began spending time with non-religious Bohemian artists in Warsaw. Although he clearly believed in a monotheistic God, as in traditional Judaism, he stopped attending Jewish religious services of any kind, even on the High Holy Days. He struggled throughout his life with the feeling that a kind and compassionate God would never support the great suffering he saw around him, especially the Holocaust deaths of the Polish Jews he grew up with. In one interview with the photographer Richard Kaplan, he said, \"I am angry at God because of what happened to my brother\": Singer's older brother died suddenly in February 1944, in New York, of a thrombosis, his younger brother perished in Soviet Russia around 1945, after being deported with his mother and wife to Southern Kazakhstan. But his anger did not appear to become atheism. In one story his narrator tells a woman, \"If you believe in God, then he exists.\"\n\nDespite all the complexities of his religious outlook, Singer lived in the midst of the Jewish community throughout his life. He did not seem to be comfortable unless he was surrounded by Jews; particularly Jews born in Europe. Although he spoke English, Hebrew, and Polish quite fluently, he always considered Yiddish his natural tongue, he always wrote in Yiddish and he was the last famous American author writing in this language. After he had achieved success as a writer in New York, Singer and his wife began spending time during the winters with the Jewish community in Miami. Eventually, as senior citizens, they moved to Miami and identified closely with the European Jewish community: a street was named after him long before he died. Singer was buried in a traditional Jewish ceremony in a Jewish cemetery.\n\nEspecially in his short fiction, he often wrote about various Jews having religious struggles; sometimes these struggles became violent, bringing death or mental illness. In one story he meets a young woman in New York whom he knew from an Orthodox family in Poland. She has become a kind of hippie, sings American folk music with a guitar, and rejects Judaism, although the narrator comments that in many ways she seems typically Jewish. The narrator says that he often meets Jews who think they are anything but Jewish, and yet still are.\n\nIn the end, Singer remains an unquestionably Jewish writer, yet his precise views about Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish God are open to interpretation. Whatever they were, they lay at the center of his literary art. [edit] Vegetarianism\n\nSinger was a prominent vegetarian for the last 35 years of his life and often included vegetarian themes in his works. In his short story, The Slaughterer, he described the anguish of an appointed slaughterer trying to reconcile his compassion for animals with his job of killing them. He felt that the ingestion of meat was a denial of all ideals and all religions: \"How can we speak of right and justice if we take an innocent creature and shed its blood?\" When asked if he had become a vegetarian for health reasons, he replied: \"I did it for the health of the chickens.\"\n\nIn The Letter Writer, he wrote \"In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka.\" which became a classical reference in the discussions about the legitimacy of the compararison of animal exploitation with the holocaust.\n\nIn the preface to Steven Rosen's \"Food for Spirit: Vegetarianism and the World Religions\" (1986), Singer wrote, \"When a human kills an animal for food, he is neglecting his own hunger for justice. Man prays for mercy, but is unwilling to extend it to others. Why should man then expect mercy from God? It's unfair to expect something that you are not willing to give. It is inconsistent. I can never accept inconsistency or injustice. Even if it comes from God. If there would come a voice from God saying, \"I'm against vegetarianism!\" I would say, \"Well, I am for it!\" This is how strongly I feel in this regard.\"\n\nPolitics\n\nSinger described himself as \"conservative,\" adding that \"I don't believe by flattering the masses all the time we really achieve much.\" His conservative side was most apparent in his Yiddish writing and journalism, where he was openly hostile to Marxist sociopolitical agendas. In Forverts he once wrote, \"It may seem like terrible apikorses [heresy], but conservative governments in America, England, France, have handled Jews no worse than liberal governments...The Jew's worst enemies were always those elements that the modern Jew convinced himself (really hypnotized himself) were his friends.\"\n\nPublished works\n\nNote: Publication dates here refer to English translations, not the Yiddish originals, which often predate their translations by ten or twenty years.\n\n* Eulogy to a Shoelace\n\n* The Family Moskat (1950)\n\n* Satan in Goray (1955)\n\n* The Magician of Lublin (Novel) (1960)\n\n* The Slave (1962)\n\n* Zlateh the Goat (1966)\n\n* The Fearsome Inn (1967)\n\n* Mazel and Shlimazel (1967)\n\n* The Manor (1967)\n\n* Zeitl and Rickel (1968) [13]\n\n* Utzel and his Daughter, Poverty (1968)\n\n* The Estate (1969)\n\n* The Golem (1969)\n\n* A Day of Pleasure, Stories of a Boy Growing Up In Warsaw (1969)\n\n* A Friend of Kafka, and Other Stories (1970)\n\n* Elijah The Slave (1970)\n\n* Joseph and Koza: or the Sacrifice to the Vistula (1970)\n\n* The Topsy-Turvy Emperor of China (1971)\n\n* Enemies, a Love Story (1972)\n\n* The Wicked City (1972)\n\n* The Hasidim (1973)\n\n* The Fools of Chelm and Their History (1973)\n\n* A Crown of Feathers, and Other Stories (1974)\n\n* Naftali and the Storyteller and His Horse, Sus (1976)\n\n* A Little Boy in Search of God (1976)\n\n* Shosha (1978)\n\n* A Young Man in Search of Love (1978)\n\n* Old Love (1979)\n\n* Reaches of Heaven.

The Polish form of his birth name was Izaak Zynger and he used his mother's first name in an initial pseudonym, Izaak Baszewis, which he later expanded to the form under which he is now known. He was a leading figure in the Yiddish literary movement, writing and publishing only in Yiddish, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978. He also was awarded two U.S. National Book Awards, one in Children's Literature for his memoir A Day of Pleasure: Stories of a Boy Growing Up in Warsaw (1970) and one in Fiction for his collection, A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories (1974).\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nEarly Years\n\nBorn to a family of religious Jews in Radzymin, Poland, on July 14, 1904, Isaac Bashevis Singer was raised in an overcrowded, poor Jewish quarter of Warsaw. Singer's father was a Hasidic rabbi, while his mother came from a long line of Mitnagdic rabbis. His older brother, Israel Joshua (also known as I.J.), grew up to become a novelist, and his sister, Esther Kreitman, also became a known writer.\n\nAs a youngster, Singer was a voracious reader. Benedict de Spinoza, Nikolai Gogol and Fyodor Dostoyevsky all ranked among his earliest influences.\n\nBeginning in 1921, Singer attended the Warsaw Rabbinical Seminary, where he was provided a traditional Jewish education. Although he was being groomed to become a Hasidic rabbi like his father, Singer followed in his older brother's footsteps instead—expressing a preference to become a writer rather than a religious leader.\n\nJournalist\n\nTwo years after enrolling at the seminary, Singer left to pursue a job in journalism. After a year spent working as a journalist, proofreader and translator in Warsaw, Singer emigrated from Poland to the United States, where his brother, I.J., awaited him. Isaac took a job in New York, writing for The Jewish Daily Forward, a Yiddish newspaper with an immigrant readership. The paper published his articles in serial format. Singer's journalistic pieces were also published in numerous journals.\n\nAuthor\n\nDespite his success in journalism, Singer's passion for literature would not be suppressed. Soon, he started writing short stories on the side. In 1925, he debuted as a fiction writer with the short story \"In Old Age.\" In 1935, Singer's first novel, Satan in Goray, was published.\n\n1950 marked the publication of his first major work, a novel about a family of Jews living in the ghettos of pre–World War II Poland, entitled The Family Moskat. Following its publication, Singer wrote a string of acclaimed short stories. Among them was one of his best-known works, \"Gimpel The Fool.\"\n\nDuring the 1960s, Singer's work continued to touch on questions of morality. One of his most recognized works from the time was Enemies: A Love Story, about the emotional struggle of a Holocaust survivor. His other important novels during that era included The Manor, The Estate and his memoir, In My Father's Court. His beloved story \"The Spinoza of Market Street\" also stemmed from this period.\n\nBy then a major writer known worldwide, Singer turned toward more contemporary topics in the 1970s. In addition to writing memoirs and his first children's books, he produced the novels The Penitent and Shosha. In 1978, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nIn the 1980s, Singer published The King of the Fields and Scum. He continued writing until he suffered a series of strokes, dying on July 24, 1991, in Surfside, Florida.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nיצחק באשעוויס (בת שבע'ס) זינגער (21סטן נאוועמבער 1902 - 24סטן יולי 1991) איז געווען א יודישער נאבעל פריז געווינער אויף ליטעראטור\n\nער איז געװען געװינער פֿון דער נאָבעל-פּרעמיע פֿאַר ליטעראַטור אינעם יאָר 1978. ער האָט געשריבן עטלעכע לאַנגע ביכער, װאָס זענען דערשינען אין דער צײַטונג פֿאָרװערטס\n\nער איז געווען א זון פון א רב און אן אייניקל פונ דער בארימטער נגידה טעמערל\n\nער איז געווען דער יונגערער ברודער פונעם יודישיסטישן שריטפטשטעלער ישראל יהושע זינגער\n\nער איז געשטאָרבן דעם 24סטן יולי 1991 אין מיאמי, פלארידא). י\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nIsaac_Bashevis_Singer\n\n'\n\nThere is some doubt as to the actual date of birth - July 14 or July 21, 1902\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer (Yiddish: יצחק באַשעװיס זינגער; November 21, 1902 (see notes below) – July 24, 1991) was a Polish Jewish American author noted for his short stories. He was one of the leading figures in the Yiddish literary movement, and received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nIsaac Bashevis Singer was born in 1902 in Leoncin village near Warsaw, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. A few years later, the family moved to a nearby Polish town of Radzymin, which is often and erroneously given as his birthplace. The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but most probably it was November 21, 1902, a date that Singer gave both to his official biographer Paul Kresh, and his secretary Dvorah Telushkin. It is also consistent with the historical events he and his brother refer to in their childhood memoirs. The often quoted birth date, July 14, 1904 was made up by the author in his youth, most probably to make himself younger to avoid the draft.\n\nHis father was a Hasidic rabbi and his mother, Bathsheba, was the daughter of the rabbi of Biłgoraj. Singer later used her name in his pen name \"Bashevis\" (Bathsheba's). His elder siblings—brother Israel Joshua Singer (1893–1944) and sister Esther Kreitman (1891–1954)--were also writers. Esther was the first in the family to write stories.\n\nThe family moved to the court of the Rabbi of Radzymin in 1907, where his father became head of the Yeshiva. After the Yeshiva building burned down in 1908, the family moved to Krochmalna Street in the Yiddish-speaking poor Jewish quarter of Warsaw, where Singer grew up. There his father acted as a rabbi — i.e., judge, arbitrator, religious authority and spiritual leader.\n\nWorld War I\n\nIn 1917, because of the hardships of World War I, the family split up. Singer moved with his mother and younger brother Moshe to his mother's hometown of Biłgoraj, a traditional Jewish town or shtetl, where his mother's brothers had followed his grandfather as rabbis. When his father became a village rabbi again in 1921, Singer went back to Warsaw, where he entered the Tachkemoni Rabbinical Seminary and soon decided that neither the school nor the profession suited him. He returned to Biłgoraj, where he tried to support himself by giving Hebrew lessons, but soon gave up and joined his parents, considering himself a failure. In 1923 his older brother Israel Joshua arranged for him to move to Warsaw to work as a proofreader for the Literarische Bleter, of which he was an editor.\n\nUnited States\n\nIn 1935, four years before the German invasion and the Holocaust, Singer emigrated from Poland to the United States due to the growing Nazi threat in neighboring Germany. The move separated the author from his common-law first wife Runia Pontsch and son Israel Zamir (b.1929), who instead went to Moscow and then Palestine (they would meet in 1955). Singer settled in New York, where he took up work as a journalist and columnist for The Forward (פֿאָרװערטס), a Yiddish-language newspaper. After a promising start, he became despondent and felt for some years \"Lost in America\" (title of a Singer novel, in Yiddish from 1974 onward, in English 1981). In 1938, he met Alma Wassermann (born Haimann) {b.1907-d.1996}, a German-Jewish refugee from Munich whom he married in 1940. After the marriage he returned to prolific writing and to contributing to the Forward, using, besides \"Bashevis,\" the pen names \"Varshavsky\" and \"D. Segal.\" They lived for many years in the Belnord on Manhattan's Upper West Side. In 1981, Singer delivered a commencement address at the University at Albany, and was presented with an honorary doctorate.\n\nSinger died on July 24, 1991 in Surfside, Florida, after suffering a series of strokes. He was buried in Cedar Park Cemetery, Emerson. A street in Surfside, Florida is named Isaac Bashevis Singer Boulevard in his honor. The full academic scholarship for undergraduate students at the University of Miami is named in his honor.\n\nWriting\n\nSinger's first published story won the literary competition of the \"literarishe bletter\" and garnered him a reputation as a promising talent. A reflection of his formative years in \"the kitchen of literature\" can be found in many of his later works. I. B. Singer published his first novel Satan in Goray in installments in the literary magazine Globus, which he cofounded with his life-long friend, the Yiddish poet Aaron Zeitlin in 1935. It tells the story of events in 1648 in the village of Goraj (close to Biłgoraj), where the Jews of Poland lost a third of their population in a cruel uprising by Cossacks, and details the effects of the seventeenth-century faraway false messiah Shabbatai Zvi on the local population. Its last chapter imitates the style of medieval Yiddish chronicle. With a stark depiction of innocence crushed by circumstance, the novel appears to foreshadow coming danger. In his later work The Slave (1962), Singer returns to the aftermath of 1648, in a love story between a Jewish man and a Gentile woman, where he depicts the traumatized and desperate survivors of the historic catastrophe with even deeper understanding.\n\nThe Family Moskat\n\nSinger became an actual literary contributor to the Forward only following his older brother's death in 1945, when he published The Family Moskat in his honor. But his own style showed in the daring turns of his action and characters, with (and this in the Jewish family-newspaper in 1945) double adultery in the holiest of nights of Judaism, the evening of Yom Kippur. He was almost forced to stop writing the novel by his legendary editor-in-chief, Abraham Cahan, but was saved by readers who wanted the story to go on. After this, his stories—which he had published in Yiddish literary newspapers before—were printed in the Forward as well. Throughout the 1940s, Singer's reputation grew. After World War II and the near destruction of the Yiddish-speaking peoples, Yiddish seemed to be a dead language. Though Singer had moved to the United States, he believed in the power of his native language and maintained that there was still a large audience that longed to read in Yiddish. In an interview in Encounter (Feb. 1979), he claimed that although the Jews of Poland had died, \"something—call it spirit or whatever—is still somewhere in the universe. This is a mystical kind of feeling, but I feel there is truth in it.\"\n\nSome of his colleagues and readers were shocked by this all-encompassing view of human nature. He wrote about female homosexuality (\"Zeitl and Rickel\" (\"Tseytl un Rikl\") in \"The Seance and Other Stories\"), transvestitism (\"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\" in \"Short Friday\"), and of rabbis corrupted by demons (\"Zeidlus the Pope\" in \"Short Friday\"). In those novels and stories which seem to recount his own life, he portrays himself unflatteringly (with some degree of accuracy) as an artist who is self-centered yet has a keen eye for the sufferings and tribulations of others.\n\nLiterary influences\n\nSinger had many literary influences; besides the religious texts he studied there were the folktales he grew up with and worldly Yiddish detective-stories about \"Max Spitzkopf\" and his assistant \"Fuchs\"; there was Dostoyevsky, whose Crime and Punishment he read when he was fourteen; and he writes about the importance of the Yiddish translations donated in book-crates from America, which he studied as a teenager in Bilgoraj: \"I read everything: Stories, novels, plays, essays...I read Rajsen, Strindberg, Don Kaplanowitsch, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Maupassant and Chekhov.\" He studied many philosophers, among them Spinoza, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Otto Weininger. Among his Yiddish contemporaries Singer himself considered his older brother to be his greatest artistic example; he was a life-long friend and admirer of the author and poet Aaron Zeitlin. Of his non-Yiddish-contemporaries he was strongly influenced by the writings of Knut Hamsun, many of whose works he later translated, while he had more critical attitude towards Thomas Mann, whose approach to writing he considered opposed to his own. Contrary to Hamsun's approach, Singer shaped his world not only with the egos of his characters, but also using the moral commitments of the Jewish tradition that he grew up with and that his father embodies in the stories about his youth. This led to the dichotomy between the life his heroes lead and the life they feel they should lead - which gives his art a modernity his predecessors do not evince. His themes of witchcraft, mystery and legend draw on traditional sources, but they are contrasted with a modern and ironic consciousness. They are also concerned with the bizarre and the grotesque.\n\nAnother important strand of his art is intra-familial strife - which he experienced firsthand when taking refuge with his mother and younger brother at his uncles home in Biłgoraj. This is the central theme in Singer's big family chronicles - like The Family Moskat (1950), The Manor (1967), and The Estate (1969). Some are reminded by them of Thomas Mann's novel Buddenbrooks; Singer had translated Mann's Der Zauberberg (The Magic Mountain) into Yiddish as a young writer.\n\nLanguage\n\nSinger always wrote and published in Yiddish – almost all of it in newspapers – and then edited his novels and stories for their American versions, which became the basis for all other translations; he referred to the English version as his \"second original\". This has led to an ongoing controversy whereby the \"real Singer\" can be found in the Yiddish original, with its finely tuned language and sometimes rambling construction, or in the more tightly edited American version, where the language is usually simpler and more direct. Many of Singer's stories and novels have not yet been translated.\n\nIn the short story form, in which many critics feel he made his most lasting contributions, his greatest influences were Chekhov and Maupassant. From Maupassant, Singer developed a finely grained sense of drama. Like the French master, Singer's stories can pack enormous visceral excitement in the space of a few pages. From Chekhov, Singer developed his ability to draw characters of enormous complexity and dignity in the briefest of spaces. In the foreword to his personally selected volume of his finest short stories he describes the two aforementioned writers as the greatest masters of the short story form,\n\nIllustrators\n\nSeveral respected artists have illustrated Singer’s novels, short stories, and children’s books including Raphael Soyer, Maurice Sendak, Larry Rivers, and Irene Lieblich. Singer personally selected Lieblich to illustrate some of his books for children, including A Tale of Three Wishes and The Power of Light: Eight Stories for Hanukkah after seeing her work in an exhibition at an Artists Equity exhibit in New York. A Holocaust survivor, Lieblich was from Zamosc, Poland, a town adjacent to the area where Singer grew up. As their memories of shtetl life were so similar, Singer found Lieblich’s images ideally suited to illustrate his texts. Of her style, Singer wrote that “her works are rooted in Jewish folklore and are faithful to Jewish life and the Jewish spirit.”\n\nSummary\n\nSinger published at least 18 novels, 14 children's books, a number of memoirs, essays and articles, but is best known as a writer of short stories, which have appeared in over a dozen collections. The first collection of Singer's short stories in English, Gimpel the Fool, was published in 1957. The title story was translated by Saul Bellow and published in May 1953 in the Partisan Review. Selections from Singer's \"Varshavsky-stories\" in the Daily Forward were later published in anthologies such as My Father's Court (1966). Later collections include A Crown of Feathers (1973), with notable masterpieces in between, such as The Spinoza of Market Street (1961) and A Friend of Kafka (1970). His stories and novels reflect the world of the East European Jewry he grew up in. And, after his many years in America, his stories concerned the world of the immigrants and how their American dream proves elusive, sometimes even after they seemed to obtain it.\n\nPrior to winning the Nobel Prize, translations of dozens of his stories were frequently published in popular magazines such as Playboy and Esquire, which attempted to raise their literary reputation by publishing Singer, and he in turn found them to be appropriate outlets for his work.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Singer continued to write on questions of personal morality, and was the target of scathing criticism from many quarters, some of it for not being \"moral\" enough, some for writing stories that no one wanted to hear. To his critics he replied, \"Literature must spring from the past, from the love of the uniform force that wrote it, and not from the uncertainty of the future.\"\n\nSinger was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978.\n\nOne of his most famous novels, due to a popular movie adaptation, was Enemies, a Love Story, in which a Holocaust survivor deals with his own desires, complex family relationships, and a loss of faith. Singer's feminist story \"Yentl\" has had a wide impact on culture since its conversion into popular movie starring Barbra Streisand. Perhaps the most fascinating Singer-inspired film is 1974's Mr. Singer's Nightmare or Mrs. Pupkos Beard by Bruce Davidson, a renowned photographer who became Singer's neighbor. This unique film is a half-hour mixture of documentary and fantasy for which Singer not only wrote the script but played the leading role.\n\nThe 2007 film Love Comes Lately, starring Otto Tausig, was adapted from Singer's stories.\n\nBeliefs\n\nJudaism\n\nSinger's relationship to Judaism was complex and unconventional. He regarded himself as a skeptic and a loner, though he felt a connection to his orthodox roots. Ultimately, he developed a view of religion and philosophy, which he called \"private mysticism: Since God was completely unknown and eternally silent, He could be endowed with whatever traits one elected to hang upon Him.\"\n\nSinger was raised Orthodox and learned all the Jewish prayers, studied Hebrew, and learned Torah and Talmud. As he recounted in the autobiographical \"In My Father's Court\", he broke away from his parents in his early twenties and, influenced by his older brother, who had done the same, began spending time with non-religious Bohemian artists in Warsaw. Although he clearly believed in a monotheistic God, as in traditional Judaism, he stopped attending Jewish religious services of any kind, even on the High Holy Days. He struggled throughout his life with the feeling that a kind and compassionate God would never support the great suffering he saw around him, especially the Holocaust deaths of the Polish Jews he grew up with. In one interview with the photographer Richard Kaplan, he said, \"I am angry at God because of what happened to my brother\": Singer's older brother died suddenly in February 1944, in New York, of a thrombosis, his younger brother perished in Soviet Russia around 1945, after being deported with his mother and wife to Southern Kazakhstan. But his anger did not appear to become atheism. In one story his narrator tells a woman, \"If you believe in God, then he exists.\"\n\nDespite all the complexities of his religious outlook, Singer lived in the midst of the Jewish community throughout his life. He did not seem to be comfortable unless he was surrounded by Jews; particularly Jews born in Europe. Although he spoke English, Hebrew, and Polish quite fluently, he always considered Yiddish his natural tongue, he always wrote in Yiddish and he was the last famous American author writing in this language. After he had achieved success as a writer in New York, Singer and his wife began spending time during the winters with the Jewish community in Miami. Eventually, as senior citizens, they moved to Miami and identified closely with the European Jewish community: a street was named after him long before he died. Singer was buried in a traditional Jewish ceremony in a Jewish cemetery.\n\nEspecially in his short fiction, he often wrote about various Jews having religious struggles; sometimes these struggles became violent, bringing death or mental illness. In one story he meets a young woman in New York whom he knew from an Orthodox family in Poland. She has become a kind of hippie, sings American folk music with a guitar, and rejects Judaism, although the narrator comments that in many ways she seems typically Jewish. The narrator says that he often meets Jews who think they are anything but Jewish, and yet still are.\n\nIn the end, Singer remains an unquestionably Jewish writer, yet his precise views about Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish God are open to interpretation. Whatever they were, they lay at the center of his literary art. [edit] Vegetarianism\n\nSinger was a prominent vegetarian for the last 35 years of his life and often included vegetarian themes in his works. In his short story, The Slaughterer, he described the anguish of an appointed slaughterer trying to reconcile his compassion for animals with his job of killing them. He felt that the ingestion of meat was a denial of all ideals and all religions: \"How can we speak of right and justice if we take an innocent creature and shed its blood?\" When asked if he had become a vegetarian for health reasons, he replied: \"I did it for the health of the chickens.\"\n\nIn The Letter Writer, he wrote \"In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka.\" which became a classical reference in the discussions about the legitimacy of the compararison of animal exploitation with the holocaust.\n\nIn the preface to Steven Rosen's \"Food for Spirit: Vegetarianism and the World Religions\" (1986), Singer wrote, \"When a human kills an animal for food, he is neglecting his own hunger for justice. Man prays for mercy, but is unwilling to extend it to others. Why should man then expect mercy from God? It's unfair to expect something that you are not willing to give. It is inconsistent. I can never accept inconsistency or injustice. Even if it comes from God. If there would come a voice from God saying, \"I'm against vegetarianism!\" I would say, \"Well, I am for it!\" This is how strongly I feel in this regard.\"\n\nPolitics\n\nSinger described himself as \"conservative,\" adding that \"I don't believe by flattering the masses all the time we really achieve much.\" His conservative side was most apparent in his Yiddish writing and journalism, where he was openly hostile to Marxist sociopolitical agendas. In Forverts he once wrote, \"It may seem like terrible apikorses [heresy], but conservative governments in America, England, France, have handled Jews no worse than liberal governments...The Jew's worst enemies were always those elements that the modern Jew convinced himself (really hypnotized himself) were his friends.\"\n\nPublished works\n\nNote: Publication dates here refer to English translations, not the Yiddish originals, which often predate their translations by ten or twenty years.\n\n* Eulogy to a Shoelace\n\n* The Family Moskat (1950)\n\n* Satan in Goray (1955)\n\n* The Magician of Lublin (Novel) (1960)\n\n* The Slave (1962)\n\n* Zlateh the Goat (1966)\n\n* The Fearsome Inn (1967)\n\n* Mazel and Shlimazel (1967)\n\n* The Manor (1967)\n\n* Zeitl and Rickel (1968) [13]\n\n* Utzel and his Daughter, Poverty (1968)\n\n* The Estate (1969)\n\n* The Golem (1969)\n\n* A Day of Pleasure, Stories of a Boy Growing Up In Warsaw (1969)\n\n* A Friend of Kafka, and Other Stories (1970)\n\n* Elijah The Slave (1970)\n\n* Joseph and Koza: or the Sacrifice to the Vistula (1970)\n\n* The Topsy-Turvy Emperor of China (1971)\n\n* Enemies, a Love Story (1972)\n\n* The Wicked City (1972)\n\n* The Hasidim (1973)\n\n* The Fools of Chelm and Their History (1973)\n\n* A Crown of Feathers, and Other Stories (1974)\n\n* Naftali and the Storyteller and His Horse, Sus (1976)\n\n* A Little Boy in Search of God (1976)\n\n* Shosha (1978)\n\n* A Young Man in Search of Love (1978)\n\n* Old Love (1979)\n\n* Reaches of Heaven.

The Polish form of his birth name was Izaak Zynger and he used his mother's first name in an initial pseudonym, Izaak Baszewis, which he later expanded to the form under which he is now known. He was a leading figure in the Yiddish literary movement, writing and publishing only in Yiddish, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978. He also was awarded two U.S. National Book Awards, one in Children's Literature for his memoir A Day of Pleasure: Stories of a Boy Growing Up in Warsaw (1970) and one in Fiction for his collection, A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories (1974).\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nEarly Years\n\nBorn to a family of religious Jews in Radzymin, Poland, on July 14, 1904, Isaac Bashevis Singer was raised in an overcrowded, poor Jewish quarter of Warsaw. Singer's father was a Hasidic rabbi, while his mother came from a long line of Mitnagdic rabbis. His older brother, Israel Joshua (also known as I.J.), grew up to become a novelist, and his sister, Esther Kreitman, also became a known writer.\n\nAs a youngster, Singer was a voracious reader. Benedict de Spinoza, Nikolai Gogol and Fyodor Dostoyevsky all ranked among his earliest influences.\n\nBeginning in 1921, Singer attended the Warsaw Rabbinical Seminary, where he was provided a traditional Jewish education. Although he was being groomed to become a Hasidic rabbi like his father, Singer followed in his older brother's footsteps instead—expressing a preference to become a writer rather than a religious leader.\n\nJournalist\n\nTwo years after enrolling at the seminary, Singer left to pursue a job in journalism. After a year spent working as a journalist, proofreader and translator in Warsaw, Singer emigrated from Poland to the United States, where his brother, I.J., awaited him. Isaac took a job in New York, writing for The Jewish Daily Forward, a Yiddish newspaper with an immigrant readership. The paper published his articles in serial format. Singer's journalistic pieces were also published in numerous journals.\n\nAuthor\n\nDespite his success in journalism, Singer's passion for literature would not be suppressed. Soon, he started writing short stories on the side. In 1925, he debuted as a fiction writer with the short story \"In Old Age.\" In 1935, Singer's first novel, Satan in Goray, was published.\n\n1950 marked the publication of his first major work, a novel about a family of Jews living in the ghettos of pre–World War II Poland, entitled The Family Moskat. Following its publication, Singer wrote a string of acclaimed short stories. Among them was one of his best-known works, \"Gimpel The Fool.\"\n\nDuring the 1960s, Singer's work continued to touch on questions of morality. One of his most recognized works from the time was Enemies: A Love Story, about the emotional struggle of a Holocaust survivor. His other important novels during that era included The Manor, The Estate and his memoir, In My Father's Court. His beloved story \"The Spinoza of Market Street\" also stemmed from this period.\n\nBy then a major writer known worldwide, Singer turned toward more contemporary topics in the 1970s. In addition to writing memoirs and his first children's books, he produced the novels The Penitent and Shosha. In 1978, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nIn the 1980s, Singer published The King of the Fields and Scum. He continued writing until he suffered a series of strokes, dying on July 24, 1991, in Surfside, Florida.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________"
