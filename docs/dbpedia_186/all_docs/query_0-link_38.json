        "text": "1. Aibak is written as Aybek in Turkish.\n\n2. S.T. Wasti, ‘The Political Aspirations of Indian Muslims and the Ottoman Nexus’, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.42, No.5 (Sept. 2006), pp.709–22.\n\n3. Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938), wrote poetry of the highest quality in Urdu and Persian. His philosophical writings include The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam (Lahore: Kapur Art Printing Works, 1930), which has been translated into many languages. He is credited with putting forward a concrete proposal for the establishment of an independent Muslim state in India.\n\n4. The son of Maulvi Sirajuddin Ahmad, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan (1873–1956) was a poet, writer, journalist and political activist. His newspaper called Zamindar (literally land-owner) was issued from Lahore and had a decidedly pan-Islamic tone without being anti-British. Maulana Zafar Ali Khan was one of the many seconders of the Lahore Resolution of 23 March 1940 which was passed at a meeting of the Muslim League presided over by Mohamed Ali Jinnah. This resolution incorporated the Muslim demand for a separate state.\n\n5. Mohamed Ali (1878–1931) edited the Comrade in English first from Calcutta and then from Delhi, as well as the Hamdard in Urdu. Further information on Maulana Mohamed Ali (and his elder brother Shaukat Ali) may be found in S.T. Wasti, ‘The Circles of Maulana Mohamed Ali’, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.38, No.4 (Oct. 2002), pp.51–62.\n\n6. Abul Kalam Azad (1888–1958) was a poet, scholar and politician who rose to become Minister of Education in India after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947. Earlier, he was the editor of the influential paper Al-Hilal issued from Calcutta. He was a friend of Nehru and Gandhi and was a prominent member of the Khilafat Movement. However, he was opposed to the political aspirations of the Indian Muslims for a separate state.\n\n7. The universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were founded in 1857, Aligarh Muslim University was established as an educational institution in 1875, The University of the Punjab was founded in Lahore in 1882 and Allahabad University in 1887.\n\n8. After a visit to Britain in 1869–70, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan (1817–98), started a residential educational institution in 1875 patterned on Oxford and Cambridge. This institution developed into the Mohammedan Anglo Oriental College and, in 1920, into the Aligarh Muslim University.\n\n9. Maulana Shaukat Ali (1873–1938) was the elder brother of Maulana Mohamed Ali and financed his education at Oxford. He studied at Aligarh and became Captain of the University cricket team. Later, he worked as a civil servant. He took an active part in the Khilafat Movement and suffered imprisonment along with Mohamed Ali.\n\n10. Sir Theodore Morison (1863–1936), joined the staff of Aligarh College in 1889, serving as Principal of the College between 1899 and 1905. He was Member of the Secretary of State's Council of India between 1906 and 1916.\n\n11. F. Robinson, Separatism Among Indian Muslims (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1993), p.207.\n\n12. Quoted in M. Hasan, A Nationalist Conscience – M.A. Ansari, the Congress and the Raj (New Delhi: Manohar, 1987), pp.42–3.\n\n13. Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari (1880–1936) was a prominent political figure in India before his relatively early death, becoming President of the Indian National Congress in 1927. Born in the United Provinces, he studied medicine at Madras and in Edinburgh, becoming House Surgeon at the Charing Cross Hospital, London where, according to several sources, e.g. Wikipedia, there is an Ansari Ward named after him. In an essay on Ansari in his book Azmat-e Rafta[The Departed Glory] (Karachi: Idara-e Ilm-o Funn, undated), Ziauddin Barni (see note 22), mentions that the appointment of Dr Ansari to the position in the Charing Cross Hospital caused a minor furore at the time, with a London evening paper publishing an item entitled: ‘Grave Injustice to British Doctors’. The Governing Council of the Hospital issued a reply stating that the appointment of Dr Ansari had been made entirely on the basis of his qualifications and abilities, and it would be tragic for British hospitals if any criteria other than ability were invoked in making such appointments.\n\n14. P.G. Robb, ‘Muslim Identity and Separatism in India: The Significance of M.A. Ansari’, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol.54, No.1 (1991), pp.104–25. This is a thoughtful and well-written essay, which correctly suggests that Hindu–Muslim political cooperation against the British really took flight only during the Khilafat Movement (1919–22) and around 1935. M.A. Ansari had excellent relations both with members of the Congress Party and the Muslim League. Most of Ansari's later family members have continued to live in India. Had he lived beyond 1936 it is possible to speculate that he might well have lost hope and changed tack to pursue the path of Pakistan like many of his Muslim colleagues.\n\n15. Hasan, A Nationalist Conscience.\n\n16. Ibid., pp.43–4.\n\n17. According to Barni, q.v., Dr Fyzee moved to Britain in 1920 to practise medicine and died there in 1962 at the age of 81.\n\n18. Abdur Rahman Siddiqi (1887–1953), student leader at Aligarh, later took a degree at Oxford and was called to the Bar. He had a long journalistic career as Editor of the Morning News, Calcutta. He became Mayor of Calcutta and subsequently rose to become Governor of East Pakistan. The name Abdur Rahman is sometimes (as in Turkish) written in the form of one word, but Abdur Rahman Siddiqi along with a large number of people with the same name preferred to divide it into two words.\n\n19. Shoaib Qureshi (1892–1962), studied at Aligarh, later took a degree at Oxford and was called to the Bar. He served as a Minister in the State of Bhopal, and in ambassadorial and ministerial posts in Pakistan. His first name is also quoted sometimes as Shuaib.\n\n20. Choudhry Khaliquzzaman (1889–1973) was educated at Aligarh, and was a lifelong supporter of the Muslim League. He served as Governor of East Pakistan and in ambassadorial assignments.\n\n21. Syed Ismail Husain Shirazi (1880–1931) came from Sirajganj, Pabna District, in East Bengal. He was a prolific writer of novels and poetry in Bengali and a political activist. In Sufia Ahmed's article entitled ‘Tribute to Kamal Ataturk’ published in The Daily Star of Dacca (Vol.5, No.169, 10 November 2004) on the 66th anniversary of the death of Ataturk, the following information on Shirazi is of interest:\n\n22. Z. Barni, Hayat-e Maulana Mohamed Ali Jauhar[Life of Maulana Mohamed Ali Jauhar] (Karachi: Urdu Academy Sind, 2001), pp.99–100. Barni gives the place of domicile for each of the members of the delegation.\n\n23. In his prologue to the book by Shahjahanpuri (Ghazi Abdurrahman Peshawari Shaheed), Dr Reyazul Hasan gives the initial number of members of the delegation as 24. However, he mentions that the numbers rose to 27 or 28. He mentions that the Mission used the services of one Ghulam Jilani as interpreter. He also writes that both Hamid Rasul and Qazi Bashiruddin had experience of working as compounders. No comprehensive official list of all names is available.\n\n24. K.K. Aziz, An Historical Handbook of Muslim India 1700–1947, Vol.2 (Lahore: Vanguard Books Pvt., 1995), pp.335–6.\n\n25.

On a point of minor interest, Manzur Mahmud [also spelt Manzoor Mahmood and given in some lists as Manzur Ali] was the father of the well-known Indian ghazal singer Talat Mahmood.\n\n28. Minor differences in the spelling of the names occur in virtually every reference.\n\n29. A.

Shahjahanpuri, Ghazi Abdurrahman Peshawari Shaheed[in Urdu] (Karachi: North Western Hotel, 1979).\n\n31. It will be observed that apart from Özcan, only Khaliquzzaman gives this name as that of one of the members of the Medical Mission.\n\n32. A.S. Shahjahanpuri, Ghazi Abdurrahman Peshawari Shaheed[in Urdu] (Karachi: North Western Hotel, 1979).\n\n33. 1925 is the year given by Zafer Hasan Aybek, who visited Abdurrahman Peshawari even on the day of his death in hospital. However, Halide Edib gives 1927 and Dr Reyazul Hasan gives 1926. Khaliquzzaman's memoirs (Pathway to Pakistan) contain the following:\n\n34. Haji Ghulam Samdani (died 1926) came from a family of Kashmiri origin and was a very successful businessman in Peshawar. He spent a lot of his wealth for the welfare of his community. Haji Samdani was married several times and had a large family.\n\n35. Hüseyin Rauf Orbay (1881–1964) was a naval hero as a result of his daring exploits with the cruiser Hamidiye in the Balkan Wars. In 1915, as one of the core members of the Teşkilâtı Mahsusa (the Turkish Intelligence ‘Special Force’) he led a Turkish expedition (coordinated with a similar German military and diplomatic venture known as the von Hentig–Niedermayer expedition) the objective of which was to persuade Afghanistan to take up an active anti-British stance. In the event, Rauf Orbay and his men (who included Abdurrahman Peshawari) could get no further than Kirmanshah, but the German expedition eventually reached Kabul where it established contact with local Turkish officials as well as with Raja Mahendra Pratap and Maulana Obaidullah Sindhi. See Wasti, ‘The Political Aspirations of Indian Muslims and the Ottoman Nexus’.\n\n36. See note 5.\n\n37. Sir Sheikh Abdul Qadir (1874–1950) was a writer of prose and poetry and the editor of the Urdu literary magazine Makhzan (storehouse of valuable goods). He visited Turkey with Mushir Hosain Kidwai in 1906. He became a High Court judge in 1921 and Minister for Education in the Punjab Government in 1925. He was made a Member of the Secretary of State's Advisory Council of India in 1934.\n\n38. Hafeez Hoshiarpuri (1912–73) was a poet, prose writer, journalist and broadcaster. His real name was Abdul Hafeez Saleem. He served in several civil administrative positions in Pakistan, and retired as Deputy Director-General, Radio Pakistan.\n\n39. A celebrated academic institution in Lahore, Pakistan which is now a University. Over the years, it has produced large numbers of graduates from the Punjab and beyond, including major poets, writers, journalists, diplomats and politicians.\n\n40. Werner Otto von Hentig (1886–1984) joined the German diplomatic service in 1909 and served in Beijing. He was later posted to Constantinopole and Tehran. In 1915, along with Oskar Niedermayer, he led the German mission to Kabul via Iran. The objective of this mission was to enlist the Afghan Amir's support for the Central Powers and to create political unrest in British India. See also note 35.\n\n41. This highly coveted medal (called the İstiklâl Madalyası in Turkish) was awarded only in the early years of the Republic to those who had taken an active part in the Turkish War of Independence. The right to wear the medal is hereditary.\n\n42. Shibli Nu'mani (1857–1914), scholar of Urdu, Persian and Arabic, poet and biographer. Further information on Shibli and his trip to Istanbul may be found in S.T. Wasti, ‘Two Muslim Travelogues: To and from Istanbul’, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.27, No.3 (July 1991), pp.457–76.\n\n43. Khaliquzzaman, Pathway to Pakistan, incorrectly gives 6 November as the departure date.\n\n44. Peshawari mentions this in a letter to one of his sister posted from Bombay two days before the departure of the ship carrying the Medical Mission. See Shahjahanpuri, Ghazi Abdurrahman Peshawari Shaheed, pp.122–4.\n\n45. Besim Ömer Pasha (1862–1940) took the surname Akalın in 1934 after the Surname Law was passed in Turkey. He was born in Istanbul and graduated from the Military School of Medicine in 1885. He specialized in Obstetrics in France and later joined Istanbul University. The Ottoman Red Crescent Society, founded in 1877, where he lectured, and which he supported and represented, was only finally allowed to use its red crescent ‘logo’ officially in 1897 due to the efforts of Besim Ömer Pasha at the VIII International Conference of the Red Cross in London. He authored dozens of books, and was Rector of Istanbul University between 1919 and 1923.\n\n46. Kadırga means ‘nautical galley’ in Turkish and is the name of a district in the historical European part of Istanbul.\n\n47. Eyüp is the Turkish name for the district with the mosque and cemetery surrounding the tomb of Abu Ayyub b. Zayd al-Ansari, a Companion of the Prophet, who died while on a military mission to Constantinople during the rule of the Caliph Mu'awiya in the late 7th century. Eyüp covers a very large area and ranks first among the very many graveyards of historical interest in Istanbul.\n\n48. Sultan Mehmed Reşad, otherwise Mehmed V (1844–1918), Ottoman Turkey's penultimate sovereign during whose reign political power lay with the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). Refer to S.T. Wasti, ‘The Last Chroniclers of the Mabeyn’, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.32, No.2 (April 1996), pp.1–29.\n\n49. Pera is now called Beyoğlu.\n\n50. Ahmed İzzet Pasha (1864–1937), was a distinguished Ottoman Army Commander and later Sadrazam (Grand Vizier). He took the surname Furgaç in 1934. His memoirs, in two volumes, are entitled: Feryadım[My Lament].\n\n51. A photograph of Enver Pasha alone and another with the Mission members appear between pages 134 and 135 in Shahjahanpuri, Ghazi Abdurrahman Peshawari Shaheed.\n\n52. Some Mission members were in the area at the time of the raid on the Sublime Porte as they used to rendezvous in the house of the old political activist Abdülaziz Çavuş (1876–1929). They heard the populace shouting: ‘Long Live Enver Bey!’\n\n53. See S.T. Wasti, ‘The 1912–13 Balkan Wars and the Siege of Edirne’, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.40, No.4 (July 2004), pp.59–78.\n\n54. Letters of Abdurrahman Peshawari to his siblings were generally written in Persian. They are quoted in Urdu translation in Shahjahanpuri, Ghazi Abdurrahman Peshawari Shaheed.\n\n55. According to Dr Reyazul Hasan, Jafri interrupted his studies at Oxford University to join the Mission to give first aid as a male nurse.\n\n56. Khaliquzzaman transliterates Turkish names into English inaccurately.\n\n57. Tevfik Rüştü Aras (1883–1972) qualified as a doctor at the French Medical Faculty in Beirut. He was elected to the first Parliament of the Republic from Izmir and served as Foreign Minister of the Republic of Turkey between 1923 and 1939. Reyazul Hasan also met him in 1954 when stationed in Ankara.\n\n58. Khaliquzzaman, Pathway to Pakistan, p. 23.\n\n59. Khaliquzzaman is quoted as follows in Shahjahanpuri, p.153:\n\n60. The Turkish expression means: Sir, the Indian Hospital is very good indeed.\n\n61. Halide Edib (1884–1964), was a Turkish novelist, professor and political worker. She was equally fluent in English and Turkish and had a working knowledge of several other languages. She was first married to the mathematician Salih Zeki and later to Dr Adnan Adıvar. She visited India in 1936 to give lectures at the Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi at the invitation of Dr Mukhtar Ansari, who was the Chancellor of this University. She mentions that in the hall where she delivered the lectures, there was a framed photograph of Abdurrahman Peshawari.\n\n62. Edib, Inside India.\n\n63. She calls Khaliquzzaman by his Turkified name Haliq Zaman and presciently describes him as ‘a man with a political future’.\n\n64. She describes the house located in Peshawar – with the plan of which, she says, she was quite familiar because Abdurrahman use to refer to it with nostalgia. In her book (Inside India), Halide Edib attaches the surname Qureshi to Abdurrahman's name for reasons not entirely clear.\n\n65. A letter from Abdur Rahman Siddiqi indicates that this group went to visit Edirne shortly after its relief and recapture by Turkish forces on 22 July 1913.\n\n66. Shibli Nu‘mani was at the quayside in Bombay to greet Dr Ansari and the Mission with a long poem in Urdu in praise of their humanitarian work.\n\n67. Sent to the Comrade by Qazi Bashiruddin.\n\n68. Khaliquzzaman and his comrades, who returned to India a few months later, also met up with Rauf Pasha and his destroyer Hamidiye in Alexandria. See Khaliquzzaman, Pathway to Pakistan, p.25.\n\n69. Kırkkilise is now called Kırklareli.\n\n70. He began his regular military training in Istanbul and later in Beirut. When the First World War broke out in 1914, he was commissioned as a lieutenant and sent to the Gallipoli front, where he fought in several engagements and (according to Shahjahanpuri) was said by Rauf Pasha to have been wounded three times.\n\n71. There is a minor confusion in the sense that the second name Nihat is used for Abdurrahman by Rauf Orbay, whereas Halide Edib gives Qureshi and other accounts give Peshawari (i.e., from Peshawar). Surnames as such were not in vogue at the time, but it is clear that the references are to the same person. Furthermore, Aybek mentions that Abdurrahman Peshawari's dislike of British rule in India was so great that he preferred to identify with the Afghans, whose languages (Persian and Pashto) he spoke and who were at least independent as a state.\n\n72. Rauf Orbay, Siyasî Hatıralar[Political Memoirs] (Istanbul: Örgün Yayınevi, 2003), pp.41–2.\n\n73. The travails of war meant that Abdurrahman – like most Turks in their beleaguered country – had virtually forgotten what real milk tasted like. In Germany in 1916, he was delighted to find large supplies of milk bottles, but on guzzling them down he was shattered to discover that their contents were only water that had been artificially given the colour of milk. ‘My disappointment was unimaginable’ is the quote attributed to him in Shahjahanpuri, p.179. It also mentions a trip to Baghdad by Abdurrahman during the War but no substantiating details are given.\n\n74. For Aybek, see note 33.\n\n75. Thus, in his Introduction to Shahjahanpuri's book (Ghazi Abdurrahman Peshawari Shaheed), Reyazul Hasan mentions that when Rauf Orbay visited Aligarh on his trip to India in 1933, he unveiled a plaque in Abdurrahman's memory in the room on campus where the latter had stayed while a student. He also met a younger brother of Abdurrahman at Aligarh with much emotion, and later travelled to Peshawar to visit Abdurrahman's family at their ancestral home.\n\n76. On 19 May 1919.\n\n77. See explanation to List of those who accompanied Mustafa Kemal Pasha to Samsun in İ. Görgülü, On Yıllık Harbin Kadrosu 1912–1922[The Cadres of the Ten Year War 1912–1922] (Ankara: Türk Tarih Kurumu Yayınları, 1993), p.201.\n\n78. Orbay, Siyasî Hatıralar, pp.298–9.\n\n79. Ömer Fahreddin Pasha (1868–1948) is famous as the Defender of Medina at the end of the First World War. He took the surname Türkkan in 1934. See S.T. Wasti, ‘The Defence of Medina, 1916–19’, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.27, No.4 (Oct. 1991), pp.642–53.\n\n80. As an example, Reyazul Hasan writes (having heard it from Maulana Mohamed Ali at a public gathering) that Abdurrahman Peshawari as one of the officers of the Turkish general Halil Pasha (who was also an uncle of Enver Pasha) also took part in the famous Kut al Amara battles in 1915–16. In one engagement, it would appear that Abdurrahman seriously risked harm and capture by a company of Indian soldiers, whereupon he discarded his Turkish uniform and – in vest and underwear – convinced the soldiers in Punjabi that he was not an enemy combatant, and so made good his escape back to the Turkish lines.\n\n81. Websites related to the establishment of the Turkish news agency called Anadolu Ajansı[Anatolian Agency] in April 1920 in Ankara mention Halide Edib describing early days as follows: The news was typed on a borrowed typewriter with one finger by Abdurrahman the Afghan.\n\n82. Z. Özaydınlı, ‘The Indian Muslims Red Crescent Society's Aid to the Ottoman State during the Balkan War in 1912’, Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine[JISHIM], Vol.2, No.8 (Oct. 2003), pp.12–18.\n\n83. Although the volunteers came in three separate groups, this does not indicate that they were uncoordinated. Özaydınlı mentions that the first group came from the United Kingdom, and comprised generally well-to-do Oxford students (the names given may be transliterated as Abdul Haq, Aale Imran, Mohammad Hussain and Hasan Abid Jafri). She suggests that a Dr Selim from Egypt was with this group. The second group was under the direction of Dr Fyzee, and the names given for this group may be rendered as follows: Dr Mohammad Hussain, Dr Nimkar, Dr Mulkehn, Dr Nizar Ahmed, Dr Salim, a pharmacist Roshan, with Abdul Wajid, Sharif Mashhadi, Hakeem Sirajuddin and Abdul Latif in various other capacities (nurses, assistants, secretary, cashier, etc.). The names given for Dr Ansari's team, i.e. the third and main group, are as follows: Dr M.A. Ansari, Dr Ali Azhar Fyzee, Dr Mohammad Naim Ansari, Dr Abdurrahman, Dr Shamsul Bari, Dr Mahmudullah, Dr Mirza Raza Khan and in other capacities, Ghulam Ahmad Khan, Nurul Shams, Abdul Wahid Khan, Hamid Rasul and Syed Tawangar Hussain. Özaydınlı quotes these names from the Red Crescent publications of the time and from other references.\n\n84. These include A.Z. İzgöer, Paris Sulh Konferansı ve Osmanlı'nın Çöküşü: Şeyh Müşir Hüseyin Kidwai[The Paris Peace Conference and the Collapse of the Ottoman Empire: Mushir Hosain Kidwai] (Istanbul: Nehir Yayınları, 1991), and A.Z.

For more information on Kidwai, see S.T. Wasti, ‘Mushir Hosain Kidwai and the Ottoman Cause’, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.30, No.2 (April 1994), pp.252–61.\n\n87. The speech was made in Bombay – in the presence of the Turkish Consul-General Halil Halid.\n\n88. S.M. Tevfik was a prolific Turkish journalist who wrote on many Islamic subjects. His dates of birth and death have not been traced. He was well-known by educated Indian Muslims and served as the special Indian correspondent for the journal Sebîlürreşad (The Straight Path). See Wasti, ‘The Political Aspirations of Indian Muslims and the Ottoman Nexus’, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.42, No.5 (Sept. 2006), pp.709–22.\n\n89. The waters when consumed are claimed locally to ease the passage of kidney stones."
