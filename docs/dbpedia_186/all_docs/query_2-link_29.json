An informal portrait of Jemal Pacha (rear seat, left side of car, with beard) and Musir (Field Marshal) Ahmet Izzet Pasha (rear seat, right side of car), seated in the back seat of a motor car, possibly leaving Damascus prior to the entry of the British. The soldier in the front passenger seat is Jemal Pacha's Circassian bodyguard. Jemal (or Djemal) [Ahmet Cemal Pasa] was one of three Pashas, the others being Enver and Talat, who ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to the end of the First World War. Jemal was in charge of the Ottoman Army in Egypt. With the defeat of the Empire in 1918 he, along with seven other leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), fled to Germany then Switzerland. In his absence, he was charged with persecuting Arab subjects of the Ottoman Empire and was found guilty in absentia. He was assassinated, by an Armenian in Tbilisi on 21 July 1922, due to his imvolvement in the Armenian genocide. Ahmed Izzet Pasha, born in 1864, had been commander on the Caucasus front. He was appointed Grand Vizir, replacing Enver and Talat, when the new Sultan Mehmet VI came to the throne on 3 July 1918. He negotiated the Armistice which ended the war in the Middle East, and took a major role in the Turkish War of Independence. He took the family name Furgac following the abolition of the Caliphate. He died in 1937. This is one of a series of photographs, probably taken by a Turkish official photographer, collected by 2120 Private (Pte) Murtie Cecil Carlian, 14th Light Horse.. Dated: 01.04.1917.
