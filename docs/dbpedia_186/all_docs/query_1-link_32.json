        "text": "The long nineteenth century started with ominous signs for the Ottoman Empire and with it the Kurdish emirates. Alarmed by Napoleon Bonaparte’s short foray into Egypt, its losses against the Russians, the outbreak of the Serbian and Greek uprisings and various local revolts led by provincial strongmen (ayan), Istanbul settled on a course of administrative reorganization and centralization that could not tolerate indirect forms of administration. One of the longest surviving forms of local, indirect administration that actually predated the Ottomans was the Kurdish emirates. In most parts of the empire, the Ottomans, like the European governments, for example, relied on a system of indirect rule whereby the local magnates recognized the ruler’s suzerainty. Those magnates ‘collaborated with the government without becoming officials in any strong sense of the term, had some access to government-backed force, and exercised wide discretion within their own territories’ (Reference Tilly, Evans, Rueschemeyer and SkocpolTilly, 1985: 170). The rise of the modern state and its institutions diminished the need for what might be called a symbiosis with the peripheral power holders. This practice of ending local autonomies, whereby central states abandoned their ‘confederal organization’ during widespread civil wars, allowed them to replace decentralized structures of politics with administratively and territorially cohesive regimes (Reference Maier, Janz, Conrad and BuddeMaier, 2006: 43). In Ottoman Kurdistan, the process of centralization was made possible by a parallel development: the formation of the Ottoman–Iranian boundaries and the permanent division of Kurdistan that had been evolving for quite some time. The elimination of Kurdish dynasts, who hitherto held power at the borderland, facilitated the making of the boundary even though it facilitated their elimination.\n\nThe hereditary Kurdish dynasties made their first appearance in Ottoman history the moment the empire expanded into Kurdistan to take advantage of post-Akkoyunlu disintegration and prevent the expansion of the nascent Safavid state. The deal they struck with Sultan Selim I, with some changes, lasted until the early nineteenth century. It is to be noted that the Kurdish dynasts did not originate with the order of Selim I; they were already there and made a mutual pact with the sultan. The symbiotic and flexible relationship between Istanbul and the Kurdish aristocracy was mutually beneficial. The geographic distance from the imperial capital, the limits of transportation technology, the difficulty of penetrating the ragged topography of Kurdistan, the pre-existing administrative structures and military power of the Kurdish dynasties and the rise of the Safavid state and the Anatolian masses that were sympathetic to the Safavids provided an opportunity for the parties to enter into an alliance.\n\nIndeed, as Suleiman the Magnificent himself came to note, the Kurdish principalities formed a crucial buffer zone between the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Iran (Reference Aziz Efendi and MurpheyAziz Efendi, 1985: 14). It could be argued that it was mostly due to this buffer that the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire, and by extension modern Turkey, started at the Zagros Mountains and not somewhere in Central Anatolia where the Turkish masses were sympathetic to the Safavids. Despite their significant autonomy, except the Babans, the Ottoman Kurdish nobility did not control wholesale provinces that were under the authority of the Ottoman governor-generals. Due mostly to the zeal of the governors to extend their authority and extract more resources, and abetted by interfamily and inter-emirate rivalries, the Kurdish nobility increasingly lost to the governors. Still, despite the overall control of the Ottoman state, the stronger Kurdish emirates remained in almost complete control of their own internal affairs up to the early nineteenth century (Reference MehmedMehmed, 1997: 241).\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, the Ottoman state began a reform and centralization process that would thereafter evolve into what would be called the Tanzimat period. Istanbul’s relentless drive for centralization effectively started with Mahmud II’s (r. 1808–39) ascension to the throne. Set out to eliminate the indirect rule of the local elite throughout the empire with the direct rule of the centrally appointed bureaucrats, change landholding patterns, introduce new taxes and enforce conscription, the Ottoman state pressed hard to eliminate any local contenders in front of its drive to bring uniformity to its governmental structure. As Nilay Ö. Gündoğan noted, with an eye to the confiscation and division of the lands of the Kurdish emirs and transferring their revenues directly to the treasury, and standardizing the land tenure system, Istanbul developed strategies from negotiation and incorporation of former beys as salaried administrators (mudir of nahiye or kaimmakam of a kaza), to outright violent suppression of the remnants of the Kurdish rule (Reference GündoğanGündoğan, 2014: 160–75). However, the main goal of the Tanzimat state was to break the autonomy of the Kurdish aristocracy by confiscating the base of their power, land (Reference GündoğanGündoğan, 2014: 164).\n\nThe fundamental change came to Kurdistan with the governor of Egypt Mehmed Ali Pasha’s challenge to the Ottoman sultan. As it is well known, it was only with the help of the British and the Russians that Istanbul was able to overcome this most serious threat to the Ottoman throne. Appointing Mehmed Ali the hereditary governor of Egypt and hence officially recognizing what could possibly be considered the second Kurdish dynasty of Egypt (after the Ayyubids), Istanbul turned against the other hereditary Kurdish aristocrats. In the meantime, as a result of their increasingly tense competition over the Baban principality and the migration of tribes like Zilan to the Ottoman side, the Ottomans and Iranians were on the brink of another war. As the tension increased, Britain and Russia intervened and persuaded the parties to withdraw their troops and agree to resolve their differences, especially the disputes over the frontier, through an international conference. Six months later, in mid-May 1843, Russian, British, Ottoman and Iranian diplomats started deliberating on and negotiating the limits of the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Iran. Great Powers’ intervention in the Egyptian crisis, and their mediation in the Ottoman–Iranian frontier dispute, thus, facilitated Istanbul’s efforts to increase its capacity where it was markedly low: Kurdistan."
