        "text": "In this thesis, I attempted to address three interconnected issues. First, I questioned the validity of using imagined dichotomies as analytical tools to understand the Late Ottoman Empire, with specific emphasis on one of the leading figures of the period, Ahmet Cevdet Pasha. Second, I examined Cevdet Pasha’s attitude toward change. Third, I engaged with controversies on the definition of conservatism and conservatives. Accordingly, I have done the empirical study on Cevdet Pasha within the context of the Ottoman Empire and the theoretical discussion on conservative attitude toward change simultaneously. That is, I suggested a more nuanced understanding of the Late Ottoman Empire and its figures rather than simplifying the complexities of the period by examining them with dichotomous frameworks of ‘reactionary/conservative,’ progressive; secular, religious; and Western-oriented, Eastern-oriented. Also, I proposed a three-tiered framework (nature of change, nature of challenge and nature of current constraints) to have a better understanding of the attitude of conservatives toward change, and to elucidate some seemingly contradictory attitudes of conservatives in the person of Ahmet Cevdet Pasha. I argued that ‘conservative’ Ahmet Cevdet’s attitude toward change can be better understood within a three-tiered framework according to which, Ahmet Cevdet does not repudiate change, but attempts to differentiate acceptable and unacceptable change; adjusts his stance and gives concessions by considering the intellectual and ideational environment; and further to that even accepts radical change and revolutions due to requirements of time and his concerns about the current natures of institutions, and how they come into existence.\n\nAhmet Cevdet Pasha, who had been in important positions in the Ottoman Empire in the 19 th century, is a historian, jurist, educator, linguist and poet as well as a statesman. There are very few people in Ottoman history who carry all of these features together. In this respect, many researches have been done about Ahmet Cevdet Pasha up to the present day. Studies carried out in different fields with each passing day about him, are showing that these investigations are not yet completed. Ahmet Cevdet Pasha, who carries on many features, is one of the most important chronicler and historian of the Ottoman Empire in 19 th century. Due to a great number of Ottoman historians are state chronicler, they usually deal with events in chronological order. Ahmet Cevdet Pasha is one of the few Ottoman historians who can go beyond this, use his own opinions about the causes and consequences of the events and take criticism as a method while deciding upon the sources. Ahmet Cevdet Pasha's studies and publishings in various fields affected his titles as historiographer and history educator positively. Having a multidisciplinary approach, Ahmet Cevdet Pasha brought a new understanding to Ottoman historiography and was in the struggle to deliver a philosophy of history and methodology. In this study, Ahmet Cevdet Pasha's historiography and his opinions on history education and history teaching will be discussed.\n\nThis study aims to interpret the organizational structure, the determination of the students, the curriculums and the content of all by associating them with the educational conditions of today's gifted students and taking the general approaches into consideration. The Enderun school in the Ottoman period is the first systematic approach when considering the education of talented people. Enderun schools are a system based on the recruitment of non-Muslim children regarded as superior in body and mind. In this study, Enderun education was compared with today's gifted education by examining the Enderun Schools' history, theoretical and practical approaches in accordance with the aims stated above. The method of this study is the literature review. Primary and secondary sources were used in the literature search. The summary, synthesis, and examination of the information about the Enderun with the support of the literature have been influential in the selection of this method. The result of the literature study shows that Enderun Schools have similar characteristics in terms of cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors when compared to subsequent and today's high talent education institutions and practices. Applications in Enderun education system were not based on only academic skills, the system was established taking into consideration interests, abilities, and values of the students."
