        "text": "Not to be confused with [[:{{{1}}}]].\n\nIzzet Ahmed Pasha (1798 – 20 February 1876), also known as Ahmed Izzet Pasha or Hacı Izzet Pasha or Hakkı Paşazâde Izzet Pasha,[1] was an Ottoman statesman who held a lengthy series of provincial governorships from 1841 to 1870. He was also a vizier (made on 20 September 1845).\n\nEarly in his career, Izzet Ahmed Pasha was first kapıcıbaşı (master of ceremonies) at the imperial palace in Constantinople (modern Istanbul) and later the voivode of the Sanjak of Sivas. He was then made a ferik (Lieutenant General) in the Ottoman army. After this, he served as the Ottoman governor of:[2][3]\n\nSidon Eyalet (December 1841 – July 1842)\n\nAdana Eyalet (March 1843 – March 1844)\n\nBolu Sanjak (March 1844 – September 1845)\n\nDiyarbekir Eyalet (September 1845 – October 1846)\n\nErzurum Eyalet (November 1846 – November 1847)\n\nIoannina Eyalet (March–September 1848, January 1855 – January 1856)\n\nTripolitania (September 1848 – August 1852)\n\nDamascus Eyalet (1856–1857)\n\nTrabzon Eyalet (August 1858 – August 1860)\n\nJeddah Eyalet (October 1861 – September 1864)\n\nKonya Vilayet (August 1865 – June 1867)\n\nHüdavendigâr Vilayet (November 1868 – April 1870)\n\nIzzet Ahmed Pasha was the son of Hakkı Mehmed Pasha (1747–1811), a prominent bureaucrat, vizier, and statesman of the time,[2] and reportedly counted the 16th-century statesman Sokollu Mehmed Pasha as among his ancestors.[4] While posted in Baghdad, he married the daughter of Ali Rıza Pasha, Baghdad's governor.[2] When his father-in-law was dismissed from the governorship of Baghdad, the decree that dismissed him cited Izzet Ahmed Pasha as a source of complaints against alleged abuses of his father-in-law's administration, most likely pointing to a fallout or disagreement between the two, or a political plot against Ali Rıza Pasha by his son-in-law.[5]\n\nWith his wife, Izzet Ahmed Pasha himself had three sons: Aziz Pasha (1835–1903), also a serial provincial governor;[6] Hakkı Pasha (died 1877), a mutasarrıf of Bihać; and Süleyman Bey.[2]\n\nIzzet Ahmed Pasha retired from public office in 1870. He died six years later on 20 February 1876 and was buried in Haydarpaşa Cemetery in Istanbul.[2]\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of governors of Sidon Eyalet\n\nList of Ottoman governors of Tripolitania\n\nList of Ottoman governors of Damascus"
