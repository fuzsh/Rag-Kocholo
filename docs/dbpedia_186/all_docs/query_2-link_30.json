        "text": "Ahmed Tevfik Paşa (born Feb. 11, 1845, Üsqüdar, near Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Tur.]—died 1936, Istanbul) was the last Ottoman grand vizier (chief minister); he was sympathetic to the nationalist movement of Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk), which resisted the Allied occupation of Anatolia after World War I.\n\nHe served in a number of advisory and diplomatic posts, including the ambassadorship in Berlin and the foreign ministry. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Ahmed Tevfik became grand vizier, but he resigned following Sultan Abdulhamid II’s deposition (1909) and was appointed ambassador to London. In 1918 he was again made grand vizier, and again he resigned, becoming a member of the Ottoman Senate. In 1919 he headed the Ottoman delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, where he refused to sign the Treaty of Sèvres (May 1920), which aimed at total dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nUnderstanding the Ottoman Empire"
