This document provides an introduction and first chapter of a study examining the Ottoman Empire's alliance with Germany in 1914 that led to their entry into World War I. The introduction discusses how the alliance prolonged the war and had far-reaching consequences. The first chapter provides historical context on the declining Ottoman Empire's relations with European powers from the 19th century, including growing German involvement and the rise of the Young Turks seeking reform amid international isolation. It sets up how the Ottoman Empire increasingly sought alliances to counter Russian influence.",
