        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Mb-Me\n\nM'ba\n\nM'ba (Minko), (Gabriel) Léon (b. February 1902, Libreville, French Congo [now in Gabon] - d. Nov. 28, 1967, Paris, France), president of Gabon (1961-64, 1964-67). In his youth he served as local administrator for the French. His nationalistic tendencies disturbed the French colonial administration in the early 1930s and they exiled him from 1933 to 1946 to Oubangui-Chari (now the Central African Republic). Shortly after his return he formed the Mouvement Mixte Gabonais. In 1952 he was elected to the Territorial Assembly, and in 1956 he became mayor of the Gabon capital, Libreville. After the victory of his party (reorganized as the Bloc Démocratique Gabonais) in the 1957 elections, he was made vice president of the Government Council (the highest post then held by an African). In 1958 he became president of the council and in 1959 prime minister of the Republic of Gabon, which had opted to remain within the French community in the referendum of September 1958. When Gabon gained full independence in 1960 he became head of state. He imprisoned several members of his party who attacked him as being too pro-French. He was elected president in 1961 (his slogan was \"The French elect de Gaulle and the Gabonese elect M'ba\") and became increasingly paternalistic and authoritarian. In early 1964, just before an election, he unilaterally decided to establish a one-party regime; in the resulting military uprising he was momentarily captured by the Gabonese army. Invoking a military assistance treaty, he obtained the intervention of a French paratrooper detachment that restored him to power; in return, France was assured of continued access to Gabon's rich uranium deposits. He remained president until his death in Paris, where he had been under medical treatment since August 1966.\n\nMba Ekua Mikó, Benjamín (b. 1948), foreign minister of Equatorial Guinea (1992-93).

He was also active in the ANC after it was banned in South Africa in 1960. He served (1961) as secretary of the African Students Association, left South Africa illegally in 1962, and worked for the ANC in London (1967-70). He moved rapidly up in the ANC hierarchy, becoming assistant secretary to its Revolutionary Council in Lusaka, Zambia (1971), the youngest member of the national executive (1975), and political secretary to ANC president Oliver Tambo (1978). Though he once wrote that \"modern capitalism has outlived its usefulness,\" he became identified with a more moderate position. During the 1970s he undertook missions for the ANC in Botswana, Swaziland, and Nigeria in order to work with black youth who had left South Africa. In the 1980s he played a key role in the discussions with South African businessmen in Lusaka in September 1985 and with other leading white South Africans in Dakar, Senegal, in July 1987, which paved the way toward South African president F.W. de Klerk's initiation of negotiations with the ANC in 1990. From 1990 Mbeki participated in those negotiations, which led to the adoption of a new interim constitution. In 1993 he was elected to succeed the ailing Tambo as ANC chairman. In 1994 he became first deputy president in the first democratically elected government of South Africa. He succeeded Nelson Mandela as ANC leader in 1997 and as president of South Africa in 1999 (reelected in 2004). In 2002-03 he was president of the African Union. In 2007 he lost the ANC leadership to Jacob Zuma. In 2008 he acceded to a request by the party to resign as president.\n\nMbella\n\nMbella Mbella, Lejeune (b. July 9, 1949, Ebone, near Nkongsamba, French Cameroons [now in Cameroon]), foreign minister of Cameroon (2015- ).

June 28, 1937, Bangui, Oubangui-Chari [now Central African Republic] - d. March 5, 1974, Bangui), Central African Republic politician. He was minister of public works (1967, 1968-70, 1970-73), electric power (1967-68), energy, transport, posts, and telecommunications (1968), and water, forestry, hunting, and fisheries (1970). He was arrested in 1973, accused of a conspiracy to overthrow the government, and died in prison.\n\nMbonimpa, Cyprien (b. Dec. 26, 1946, Bwatemba, Burundi), foreign minister of Burundi (1987-92). He was also chargé d'affaires in the Soviet Union (1975-76) and ambassador to Belgium (1980-85) and France (1985-87).\n\nMbonyumutwa, Dominique (b. 1921 - d. July 26, 1986, Brussels, Belgium), president of Rwanda (1961).\n\nM'Boua, Christophe (Valentino) (b. April 7, 1942, Addah, Abidjan département, Ivory Coast - d. Oct. 23, 2013, Paris, France), foreign minister of Côte d'Ivoire (2000).\n\nM'Bow\n\nM'Bow, Amadou-Mahtar (b. March 20, 1921, Dakar, Senegal), director-general (1974-87) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). During World War II he became the first black technical sergeant in the history of the French Air Force. By 1950 he had established himself as a Marxist student leader, becoming president of the Federation of Black African Students in France. After Senegal achieved independence in 1960, M'Bow served under Pres. Léopold Senghor as minister of education (1966-68) and youth and culture (1968-70) and was a member of the National Assembly. In UNESCO M'Bow emerged as an outspoken critic of what he termed Eurocentrism. In the late 1960s he twice headed his country's delegations to UNESCO general conferences and was a member of the body's executive board, chairman of the group of African members, and head of the caucus of its 77 third world members. He was appointed in 1970 to the post of assistant director-general for education by then director-general René Maheu, whom he succeeded in 1974. His direct but conciliatory leadership style was affirmed by unanimous reelection in 1980. Under M'Bow's stewardship, power alignments within UNESCO shifted to reflect more closely the interests of the many third world and Soviet-satellite nations that had become members in the 1960s and 1970s. Alienated and angry Western nations - whose governments contributed most of the agency's total budget - leveled charges of mismanagement, centralization of power, and Communist bias, to an important degree against M'Bow himself. By late 1984, his ability to mend cracks in UNESCO's foundations appeared tenuous at best; the U.S. withdrew from the organization, and the U.K. threatened to withdraw a year later.\n\nMboweni, Tito (Titus) (b. March 16, 1959, Tzaneen, Transvaal [now in Limpopo province], South Africa), finance minister of South Africa (2018-21). He was also minister of labour (1994-99) and governor of the South African Reserve Bank (1999-2009).\n\nMboya, Tom, byname of Thomas Joseph Odhiambo Mboya (b. Aug. 15, 1930, Kilima Mbogo, near Nairobi, Kenya - d. [assassinated] July 5, 1969, Nairobi), Kenyan politician. He was minister of labour (1962-63), justice and constitutional affairs (1963-64), and economic planning and development (1964-69).\n\nMbu\n\nMbuende\n\nMbu, Matthew (Tawo) (b. Nov. 20, 1929, Okundi [now in Cross River state], Nigeria - d. Feb. 6, 2012, London, England), foreign minister of Biafra (1967-70) and Nigeria (1993). He was also commissioner for Nigeria in the United Kingdom (1955-58), minister of navy (1961-65) and transport and aviation (1966), and ambassador to Germany (1998-99).\n\nMbuende, Kaire (Munionganda) (b. Nov. 28, 1953, Windhoek, South West Africa [now Namibia]), executive secretary of the Southern African Development Community (1994-99).

He was also minister of agriculture, water, and rural development (1993-96), information and broadcasting (2003-05), education (2005-10), and safety and security (2010-12).\n\nMbusa\n\nMbusa Nyamwisi, Antipas (b. Nov. 15, 1959, Mutwanga, Belgian Congo [now Congo (Kinshasa)]), foreign minister of Congo (Kinshasa) (2007-08). He was also minister of regional cooperation (2003-07) and decentralization and regional planning (2008-11).\n\nMbuyu Kabango Mukolwe, Célestin (b. Dec. 30, 1949, Mwala, Belgian Congo [now Congo (Kinshasa)]), governor of Haut-Lomami (2016-17). He was also minister of interior, decentralization, and security (2008-10) and hydrocarbons (2010-12) of Congo (Kinshasa).\n\nMbye, Lamin Abdou (b. March 3, 1934, Bathurst [now Banjul], Gambia - d. July 30, 2004, Salisbury, Md.), Gambian diplomat. He was ambassador to the United States (1982-87) and permanent representative to the United Nations (1984-87).\n\nMcAdoo, William G(ibbs) (b. Oct. 31, 1863, Marietta, Ga. - d. Feb. 1, 1941, Washington, D.C.), U.S. secretary of the treasury (1913-18); son-in-law (1914-34) of Woodrow Wilson. He was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1920 and 1924.\n\nMcAleese\n\nMcAleese, Mary (Patricia), née Leneghan, Irish Máire (Pádraigín) Mhic Giolla Íosa, née Ní Lionnacháin (b. June 27, 1951, Ardoyne, Belfast, Northern Ireland), president of Ireland (1997-2011). She was the surprise presidential nominee of the strongly nationalist governing party Fianna Fáil and its centre-right coalition partner, the Progressive Democrats. She swept to victory by a record margin to become the first Northern Irish citizen to fill the largely ceremonial position. A respected academic with a firm legal training, she won the election on a promise to carry on the high-profile crusading job begun by former president Mary Robinson, who swept away the old image of the presidency as a preserve of retired male politicians. McAleese is not easily pigeon-holed, being a curious mix of old-fashioned Catholicism and forward-looking feminism. She came out publicly on the Catholic Church's side in the Republic's abortion amendment and divorce referenda. Yet she has also supported a liberalization of the laws regarding homosexuality and has argued vociferously for a stronger role for women in the Church. She pledged at her inauguration to work for a \"millennium gift\" of harmony in the divided island. She said the country would \"insist that we have seen the last of violence.\" More than 3,200 people had been killed in 28 years of conflict in Northern Ireland, where the British and Irish governments were co-sponsoring peace talks. Leaked Irish foreign office memos during the campaign suggested she was sympathetic to Northern Irish Republican and anti-British politics. This fuelled many a media talk-show but did little to diminish her widespread appeal. She was entitled to run for the presidency because the Irish constitution claims jurisdiction over Northern Ireland, but ironically she was not allowed a vote herself. In 2004 she was reelected unopposed.\n\nMcAlister, (Harry) Hill (b. July 15, 1875, Nashville, Tenn. - d. Oct. 30, 1959, Nashville), governor of Tennessee (1933-37); great-grandson of Aaron V.

Feb. 20, 1934, Gardone Riviera, Italy), British resident in Brunei (1906-07, 1908) and adviser in Kedah (1919-23).\n\nMcAuliffe\n\nMcAuliffe, Terry, byname of Terence Richard McAuliffe (b. Feb. 9, 1957, Syracuse, N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic National Committee (2001-05) and governor of Virginia (2014-18).\n\nMcBride, Henry (b. Feb. 7, 1856, Farmington, Utah - d. Oct. 7, 1937, Seattle, Wash.), governor of Washington (1901-05).\n\nMcBride, John (b. 1854, Wayne county, Ohio - d. [struck by a runaway horse] Oct. 9, 1917, Globe, Ariz.), president of the American Federation of Labor (1894-95).\n\nMcBride, Sir Philip (Albert Martin) (b. June 18, 1892, Kooringa, Burra, S.Aus. - d. July 14, 1982, Medindie, S.Aus.), defence minister of Australia (1950-58); knighted 1953. He was also minister of the army (1940), repatriation (1940), munitions (1940-41), supply and development (1940-41), interior (1949-50), air (1951), and navy (1951).\n\nR. McBride\n\nMcBride, Sir Richard (b. Dec. 15, 1870, New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada - d. Aug. 6, 1917, London, England), premier of British Columbia (1903-15). After making an unsuccessful run for the Canadian parliament in 1896, he entered the British Columbian legislature in 1898 and was appointed minister of mines in 1900. Differing from his colleagues on a matter of policy, he resigned from the government in the autumn of 1901. In 1902 he was chosen leader of the opposition, and he became premier of the province in June 1903 - \"the youngest premier in the Empire.\" The introduction of party lines in provincial politics followed, McBride becoming the head of the first Conservative government of British Columbia. He was returned in the general election of October 1903, and again in 1907, 1909, and 1912. As premier he coped with the rapid growth of population and industry in British Columbia. His commitment to extending the Pacific Great Eastern Railway put the province considerably in debt. He resigned in 1915 because of ill health and served as agent general for British Columbia in London until his death. He was knighted in 1912.\n\nMcCabe, Thomas B(ayard) (b. July 11, 1893, Whaleyville, Md. - d. May 27, 1982, Swarthmore, Pa.), chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1948-51).\n\nJ. McCain\n\nMcCain, John (Sidney, III) (b. Aug. 29, 1936, Coco Solo Air Base, Panama Canal Zone [now in Panama] - d. Aug. 25, 2018, near Cornville, Ariz.), U.S. politician. Serving in the Vietnam War, his plane was shot down over Hanoi in 1967 and he remained a prisoner until 1973. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 and 1984 and then to the Senate in 1986, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2010, and 2016. Known as a maverick, he first ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 but lost to George W. Bush. Running again in 2008, he practically sealed the nomination in February by taking a clear lead in the \"Super Tuesday\" contests and by the subsequent withdrawal of his chief rival Mitt Romney. He reached the necessary number of delegates in March. In the November election, however, he lost to Democrat Barack Obama. In 2015 he was famously disparaged by Donald Trump who during his presidential campaign denied McCain was a war hero: \"He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\" In 2017 McCain, without mentioning Trump by name, noted that at the time of the Vietnam war \"we drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur.\" In another thinly-veiled dig at Trump, he condemned \"half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.\" The same year he cast a critical vote against the repeal of \"Obamacare,\" which led to further attacks by Trump, even after McCain's death.\n\nM.N. McCain\n\nS. McCallum\n\nMcCain, Margaret Norrie, née Norrie (b. Oct. 1, 1934, Amos, Quebec), lieutenant governor of New Brunswick (1994-97).\n\nMcCall, Samuel W(alker) (b.

April 9, 1950, Montreal, Que.), defence minister of Canada (2002-03). He was also minister of veterans affairs (2003-04), national revenue (2004-06), natural resources (2005-06, acting), and immigration, refugees and citizenship (2015-17) and ambassador to China (2017-19).\n\nMcCallum, Scott (b. May 2, 1950, Fond du Lac, Wis.), governor of Wisconsin (2001-03).\n\nMcCarthy, Charles (Henry Florence) D'Arcy (b. June 29, 1899, Madras province, India - d.

Nov. 26, 1929, Honolulu, Hawaii), governor of Hawaii (1918-21).\n\nE.J. McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy, Eugene J(oseph), byname Gene McCarthy (b. March 29, 1916, Watkins, Minn. - d. Dec. 10, 2005, Washington, D.C.), U.S. politician. In 1948 he was elected on Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party ticket to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he remained for 10 years. He was elected to the Senate in 1958 and reelected in 1964. He established a liberal voting record but, despite his service on the Senate's Finance and Foreign Relations committees, remained a relatively unknown figure nationally until Nov. 30, 1967, when he announced his intention to challenge Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson in the Democratic state presidential primaries. Although in 1964 he had supported the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which gave the president broad powers to wage war in Vietnam, McCarthy had become an outspoken critic of the war. At first his challenge was not taken seriously, but he made an unexpectedly strong showing in the New Hampshire primary on March 12, 1968, and Johnson announced his withdrawal from the race on March 31. McCarthy went on to sweep three primaries but then lost four of the next five to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Following Kennedy's assassination, McCarthy lost the nomination at the convention in Chicago to Vice Pres. Hubert H. Humphrey. In 1970 McCarthy did not seek reelection to the Senate. He conducted a lacklustre campaign for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination, which was won by Sen. George S. McGovern. Four years later he made a much more vigorous attempt to win the presidency as an independent, but he won only about 1% of the vote. In 1980 he endorsed Ronald Reagan for the presidency, and in 1982 he made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for senator from Minnesota. He ran for president on the Consumer Party ticket in 1988, winning some 30,000 votes (0.03%), and made another quixotic attempt at the Democratic nomination for president in 1992.\n\nMcCarthy, George (A.), acting governor of the Cayman Islands (2005). He was financial secretary (1992-2004) and chief secretary (2004-09).\n\nJ.R. McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy, Joseph R(aymond), byname Joe McCarthy (b. Nov. 14, 1908, Grand Chute, near Appleton, Wis. - d. May 2, 1957, Bethesda, Md.), U.S. politician. In 1946 he was elected to the Senate following a stunning upset victory over Sen. Robert M. La Follette, Jr., in the Republican primary. He was an undistinguished senator until Feb. 9, 1950, when he charged, in a speech at Wheeling, W.Va., that 205 Communists had infiltrated the State Department. Upon subsequently testifying before a special subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, he proved unable to produce the name of a single \"card-carrying Communist\" in any government department. Nevertheless, he instigated a nationwide, militant anti-Communist \"crusade.\" He was reelected in 1952 and obtained the chairmanship of the Government Committee on Operations of the Senate and of its permanent subcommittee on investigations. He questioned innumerable witnesses about their suspected Communist affiliations, though he failed to make a plausible case against anyone. His increasingly irresponsible attacks came to include Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower and other Republican and Democratic leaders. His influence waned in 1954 as a result of the sensational, nationally televised hearing on his charges of subversion by Army officers and civilian officials. This exposure of his brutal and truculent interrogative tactics discredited him in the public eye. The Republicans lost control of the Senate in the midterm elections that November, and he was replaced as chairman of the investigating committee. On December 2, the Senate formally condemned him on a vote of 67-22 for conduct \"contrary to Senate traditions,\" and he was largely ignored by his colleagues and by the media thereafter, though some of the atmosphere of forced conformity which marked the era of McCarthyism continued to be felt.\n\nMcCarthy, Kevin (Owen) (b. Jan. 26, 1965, Bakersfield, Calif.), speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives (2023). Reflecting the dysfunctionality of the Republican Party radicalized by Donald Trump, he required the most rounds of voting (15) to be elected speaker since 1860, only to end up as the shortest-serving speaker since 1876, as, after nine months, he became the first speaker in U.S. history to be voted out of office.\n\nMcCartney, J(ames) A(lexander) G(eorge) S(mith) (b.

Jan. 4, 1831, Hopewell, New Brunswick - d. Jan. 30, 1917, Moncton, N.B.), lieutenant governor of New Brunswick (1896-1902).\n\nMcClellan\n\nMcClellan, George B(rinton) (b. Dec. 3, 1826, Philadelphia, Pa. - d. Oct. 29, 1885, Orange, N.J.), U.S. politician. Although a states' rights Democrat, he was nevertheless a staunch Unionist, and, a month after the outbreak of the American Civil War (April 1861), he was commissioned in the regular army and placed in command of the Department of the Ohio. By July 13 the Confederate forces in western Virginia were defeated under his direction, and he had established a reputation as the \"Young Napoleon of the West.\" After the Union reverse at the First Battle of Bull Run the same month, he was placed in command of the troops protecting the capital, a force that became known as the Army of the Potomac, and also charged with the destruction of the enemy's forces in northern and eastern Virginia. In November he succeeded Gen. Winfield Scott as commanding general of the U.S. Army. But despite his remarkable organizing abilities and brilliant success in whipping the army into a fighting unit with high morale, he refused to take the offensive against the enemy that fall, insisting that he could not advance until he had properly trained and organized a large army. In March 1862 he was relieved as commanding general. In the Peninsular Campaign (April 4-July 1), he was again reluctant to pursue the enemy, overestimating the number of troops opposing him. The exasperated Pres. Abraham Lincoln finally removed him from his command in November. In 1864 McClellan was nominated for the presidency by the Democratic Party, though he repudiated its platform, which denounced the war as a failure. He resigned his army commission on election day. Lincoln won by 212 electoral votes to 21 for McClellan. After spending some years in Europe, he served as chief engineer of the New York City Department of Docks (1870-72) and one term as governor of New Jersey (1878-81).\n\nMcClellan, George B(rinton), Jr. (b.

March 11, 1989, Stamford, Conn.), U.S. diplomat. He served in World War I and in the occupation forces in Germany after that war. In October 1940 he was appointed expert consultant to the secretary of war, and in April 1941, assistant secretary of war (until November 1945). In the latter position, McCloy helped to secure congressional approval of the Lend-Lease Act and oversaw the internment of Japanese-Americans following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. He was also one of the few civilians privy to the knowledge that the government intended to use the atomic bomb against Japan to end World War II; he argued that the Japanese should receive an advance warning, but was overruled. From 1947 to 1949 he was president of the World Bank. In 1949, he was appointed first civilian U.S. high commissioner for occupied West Germany, his most visible post, which he held until 1952. He also acted as chief Economic Cooperation Administration representative for Germany and U.S. representative on the three-power Allied Council. McCloy was instrumental in creating a civilian government following a four-year military rule and in overseeing the contractual agreements that ended the U.S. occupation in 1955. He was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations (1953-70), served as chief disarmament adviser to Pres. John F. Kennedy (1961), and was a member of the Warren Commission appointed in 1963 to investigate Kennedy's assassination. In 1979 he advised Pres. Jimmy Carter to admit the shah of Iran into the U.S. for medical treatment, a move that sparked the Tehran hostage crisis. Because of his longtime government service he was dubbed the \"unofficial chairman of the Establishment.\"\n\nMcClure, Herbert Joseph (b. Dec. 29, 1917 - d.

The following year he was named a special deputy to James V. Forrestal, the secretary of defense, and in 1950-51 he was undersecretary of the Air Force. During his tenure as head of the Atomic Energy Commission (1958-61) under Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower, McCone initiated the \"Atoms for Peace\" program and sought to reach agreement with the U.S.S.R. on a nuclear test-ban treaty. Although a Republican, McCone was drafted by Pres. John F. Kennedy to head the CIA after the departure of Allen Dulles, who had engineered the abortive 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by U.S.-backed opponents of Fidel Castro. In this post McCone was credited with being the first to provide vital information that the Soviet Union was planning to place nuclear offensive missiles in Cuba. Shortly thereafter, his prediction was confirmed by photographs taken during a U-2 reconnaissance mission, and a confrontation between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. - termed the Cuban missile crisis - emerged (October 1962). After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, McCone served under Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson, but he felt undervalued and returned to the private sector. He strongly opposed the Vietnam war, considering it one the U.S. could not win. In 1987 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nMcConnell, Mitch, byname of Addison Mitchell McConnell (b. Feb. 20, 1942, Tuscumbia, Ala.), U.S. politician.

His firm loyalty to the Democratic Party won him election as a delegate to the Massachusetts constitutional convention at the age of 25; he then served for two years in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and three years in the Senate. After losing his 1926 bid to become a member of the U.S. House, he won in 1928 and for the next 42 years remained a permanent fixture in Congress. His strong party allegiance cemented his friendship with two powerful Texas Democrats, John N. Garner and Sam Rayburn, and with very little seniority, McCormack was appointed to the Ways and Means Committee. Although he was approached on several occasions to run for mayor of Boston or for the U.S. Senate, McCormack always declined, saying \"I have loved the House.\" In 1940 he became House majority leader, remaining in that post (except for two intervals in 1947-49 and 1953-55 when the Republicans controlled the House, during which he was minority whip) until 1962 when he succeeded Rayburn as speaker of the House. During his tenure, McCormack earned a reputation as a skillful debater who opposed Communism, defended the war in Vietnam, and backed such social legislation as civil rights bills, antipoverty programs, housing laws, Social Security, job safety regulations, and wage-and-hour laws. When Lyndon Johnson became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, McCormack, as speaker, stood next in the line of succession to the presidency. In 1970 he came under fire when two of his closest associates, Martin Sweig and Nathan Voloshen, were indicted for influence peddling. He was the first House speaker in more than a century to retire voluntarily (1971).\n\nMcCormick, Richard C(unningham) (b. May 23, 1832, New York City - d.

Rockefeller and Richard M. Nixon. She was the last high commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands before it was dissolved in 1987.

Nov. 30, 1972, Cincinnati, Ohio), U.S. secretary of defense (1957-59). On Aug. 7, 1957, he was nominated to succeed Charles E. Wilson upon the latter's retirement from Dwight D. Eisenhower's cabinet. He announced his opinion that the first problem of the Defense Department was \"budgetary.\" He was sworn into office on Oct. 9, 1957, and within three weeks had restored many of his predecessor's \"economy cuts\" in defense spending. On October 18, in the face of mounting national concern over Soviet launching of the first Earth satellite October 4, McElroy assumed direct control over the three armed services' separate missiles programs. In 1958 McElroy wholly supported President Eisenhower's plan to reorganize and streamline the U.S. Defense Department but denied that the proposal would in any manner make him a \"czar.\" The Pentagon reform bill was later passed by Congress. On Sept. 2, 1958, McElroy flatly asserted that the U.S. led the U.S.S.R. in \"overall comparative military strength.\" However, in January 1959 he became the first official to proclaim the \"missile gap,\" disclosing that the Soviet Union was expected to develop a 3-to-1 superiority over the U.S. in intercontinental ballistic missiles in the early 1960s. The issue was to preoccupy national debate for years to come. McElroy resigned in December 1959 to return to private business (he was president of the Procter & Gamble company).\n\nMcEnery, John (b. March 31, 1833, Petersburg, Va. - d. March 28, 1891, New Orleans, La.), governor of Louisiana (1873, in opposition).\n\nMcEnery, Samuel D(ouglas) (b. May 28, 1837, Monroe, La. - d.

Nov. 21, 1980, Melbourne, Vic.), prime minister of Australia (1967-68). He entered politics in 1932 as an unsuccessful candidate for the Victoria state parliament. McEwen rapidly advanced to membership in the federal parliament (1934-71) and to the post of minister of the interior (1937-39). In 1940 he was successively external affairs minister and air minister. Three years later he became deputy leader of the Country Party, and he was its leader from 1958 to 1971. Although his party remained a minority in government, he was for many years (1958-71) deputy prime minister (an official post from 1968) and held the vital ministerial portfolios of commerce and agriculture (1949-56) and trade (1956-63); in the latter post he was recognized as a statesman of great ability and integrity. He was also a noted opponent of British entry into the European Economic Community. He was prime minister for three weeks in the interim following the death of Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967. McEwen was knighted in 1971.\n\nMcFarland, Ernest W(illiam) (b. Oct. 9, 1894, near Earlsboro, Okla. - d. June 8, 1984, Phoenix, Ariz.), governor of Arizona (1955-59). He was also a U.S. senator from Arizona (1941-53).\n\nMcFarlane, Robert C(arl), byname Bud McFarlane (b. July 12, 1937, Washington, D.C. - d. May 12, 2022, Lansing, Mich.), U.S. politician. As a promising young officer in the Marines, he was sent to study international relations at the prestigious Institut de Hautes Études in Geneva. That was a springboard to a White House fellowship in 1971-72, and he soon caught the eye of two important mentors, Henry Kissinger and Lt.Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who served successively as national security advisors to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Kissinger, impressed by McFarlane's capacity for long working hours and quiet but adroit dealings with Congress, kept him on until 1975 as his military assistant. But after two more years in Washington as special assistant to Scowcroft, McFarlane's career came momentarily unstuck; he was thought to have strayed too far from strictly military concerns, and the Marines reassigned him to Okinawa. Bored, and unhappy with Pres. Jimmy Carter's foreign policies, he resigned his commission. By then, however, he was a firmly established figure in the power network, and he soon joined the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In 1981, with the Republicans back in the White House, McFarlane reentered the mainstream, serving as counselor at the State Department and then from January 1982 as Pres. Ronald Reagan's deputy assistant for national security affairs until he was named chief U.S. negotiator in the Middle East in July 1983. Three months later, in October, Reagan made him his national security advisor. He resigned his post in 1985. Involved in the Iran-contra scandal, he pleaded guilty in 1988 to withholding information from Congress and in 1989 was sentenced to two years' probation and 200 hours of community service and fined $20,000. He was pardoned by Pres. George Bush on Dec. 24, 1992.\n\nMcGarvie\n\nMcGarvie, Richard (Elgin) (b. May 21, 1926, Colac, Vic. - d. May 24, 2003, Melbourne, Vic.), governor of Victoria (1992-97). He joined the Australian navy in 1944 and trained at HMAS Cerberus, but did not see active service before the war ended. After his discharge he studied law, becoming a Queen's Counsel at the age of 37. He also became an author, an active member of the Labor Party, university lecturer, and the chancellor of Latrobe University for more than a decade. He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1976 by Rupert Hamer's Liberal government and served as a judge until he was appointed governor of Victoria in 1992 by Labor premier Joan Kirner. In later years he was known for his support of an Australian republic.\n\nMcGibbon\n\nMcGonigal\n\nMcGibbon, Pauline Mills, née Mills (b. Oct. 20, 1910, Sarnia, Ont. - d.

May 16, 1946, Milwaukee, Wis.), governor of Wisconsin (1911-15).\n\nG.S. McGovern\n\nMcGovern, George S(tanley) (b. July 19, 1922, Avon, S.D. - d. Oct. 21, 2012, Sioux Falls, S.D.), U.S. politician. He was active in Democratic politics, beginning in 1948, becoming executive secretary of the South Dakota Democratic Party in 1953. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1956 but was defeated for a Senate seat in 1960. He served for two years as the director of the Food for Peace Program under Pres. John F. Kennedy. In 1962 he ran again for the Senate and won; he was reelected in 1968. He was one of the leading opponents to the United States' military involvement in Indochina, though his principal legislative effort in the late 1960s was devoted to eliminating hunger and malnutrition in America. As chairman of a Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection prior to the Democratic National Convention in 1972, McGovern helped enact party reforms that gave increased representation to minority groups at the convention. Supported by these groups, he won the presidential nomination but alienated many of the more traditional elements in the party. McGovern, whose campaign got off to a bad start with the decision to drop his vice-presidential running mate Sen. Thomas Eagleton and to name Sargent Shriver in his place, advocated an immediate end to the Vietnam War and a broad program of liberal social and economic reforms at home, but he was unable to unify the party sufficiently to offer an effective challenge to the incumbent Republican president, Richard M. Nixon; with 38% of the vote, he carried only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. He was reelected to the Senate in 1974, but lost his seat in 1980 to Republican James Abdnor. He declared himself a candidate for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination, but withdrew early after a third-place finish in the Massachusetts primary.\n\nMcGowan\n\nMcGowan, Mark (b. July 13, 1967, Newcastle, N.S.W.), premier of Western Australia (2017-23).\n\nMcGranery, James P(atrick) (b. July 8, 1895, Philadelphia, Pa. - d. Dec. 23, 1962, Palm Beach, Fla.), U.S. attorney general (1952-53).\n\nJ.H. McGrath\n\nMcGrath, J(ames) Howard (b. Nov. 28, 1903, Woonsocket, R.I. - d. Sept. 2, 1966, Narragansett, R.I.), U.S. politician. He was governor of Rhode Island from 1941 to 1945. Appointed U.S. solicitor general in 1945, he served until the next year, when he was elected U.S. senator from Rhode Island. From 1947 to 1949 he was chairman of the Democratic National Committee. From 1949 to 1952, he was attorney general of the U.S. In 1950 he figured prominently in government moves against Communists in the U.S. In March, he spoke against the release of the government's loyalty files to the Senate committee investigating Communism in the U.S., on the grounds that innocent persons might be injured. Later in the year he declared that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had adequate knowledge of all important Communists in the U.S., and criticized Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin for the latter's charges of Communism in government offices, declaring McCarthy's \"witch hunts and frantic name-calling\" endangered American liberties. Pres. Harry Truman asked for McGrath's resignation in 1952 after McGrath had dismissed the administration's special investigator of corruption, Newbold Morris, when Morris insisted on circulating a detailed financial questionnaire among top federal officials. A month earlier, Harold E. Stassen, who was attempting to get the Republican presidential nomination, had charged that McGrath had made himself \"a millionaire\" since taking office. In 1956 he was campaign manager for Sen. Estes Kefauver who was making what turned out to be an unsuccessful try for the presidential nomination. In 1960 he made a vain attempt to get the Democratic nomination for senator from Rhode Island.\n\nMcGrath, James A(loysius) (b. Jan. 11, 1932, Buchans, Newfoundland [now Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada] - d. Feb. 28, 2017), lieutenant governor of Newfoundland (1986-91).

June 23, 1910, Seattle, Wash.), governor of Washington (1893-97).\n\nMcGreevey\n\nMcGreevey, Jim, byname of James Edward McGreevey (b. Aug. 6, 1957, Jersey City, N.J.), governor of New Jersey (2002-04). He served as a Middlesex County assistant prosecutor (1982-83) and was appointed by Gov. Thomas Kean as executive director of the State Parole Board (1985-87). In 1989 he was elected to the Assembly, where he voted for Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990; he lost his Assembly seat in a 1991 primary challenge from Woodbridge Mayor Joseph DeMarino. But McGreevey then challenged DeMarino's mayoral reelection bid that same year; he won and then easily won reelection in 1995 and 1999. In 1993 he was elected state senator; in New Jersey, as in France, politicians can and often do serve as mayors and legislators at the same time. As mayor, he was elected to his last term in 1999 with 80% of the vote. In the state Senate he sponsored a budget cap, changes in ethical standards, a pollution prevention law, and a requirement that health insurance cover mammograms. In 1997 he first ran for governor. He beat Rob Andrews in the Democratic primary 39%-37%. In the general election he came up just short against Christine Todd Whitman, who won 47%-46%. That showing made him the natural nominee four years later, when he won the primary against Elliot Greenspan 96%-4% and then defeated Republican Bret Schundler 56%-42%. He was embarrassed when two of his appointees, state police superintendent Joseph Santiago and homeland security adviser Golan Cipel, were forced to resign and also when Amiri Baraka, whom he named as state poet laureate, published a poem in which he suggested that Jews were behind the World Trade Center attack. On Aug. 12, 2004, he announced his resignation, effective November 15, after disclosing he was a \"gay American\" who had an extramarital affair with another man. The resignation was apparently prompted when Cipel threatened him with a sexual harassment lawsuit.\n\nMcGregor, Ian (Kerr), New Zealand representative in Niue (1977-79).\n\nMcGregor, James Drummond (b. Sept. 1, 1838, New Glasgow, Nova Scotia - d. March 4, 1918, New Glasgow), lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia (1910-15).\n\nMcGregor, James Duncan (b.

She was permanent representative to the United Nations (2016-22).\n\nD.F. McHenry\n\nMcHenry, Donald F(ranchot) (b. Oct. 13, 1936, St. Louis, Mo.), U.S. ambassador to the United Nations (1979-81). He joined the State Department in 1963 as a junior officer at the Office of United Nations Political Affairs. Ten years later he left government service, following the U.S. invasion of Cambodia and Pres. Richard Nixon's decision to make Henry Kissinger secretary of state. With Jimmy Carter's election as president, McHenry returned to the State Department and the UN. He was given a number of delicate and highly visible assignments, including acting as a U.S. troubleshooter in Namibia and Angola. When UN ambassador Andrew Young resigned in August 1979, Carter chose McHenry, who was Young's deputy, as successor. While Young and McHenry shared certain basic political attitudes, their personalities could hardly be more dissimilar. Where Young tended to a certain flamboyance of style and rhetoric, McHenry was a quiet professional, a diplomat with a diplomat's patience. As ambassador, he pressed the U.S. case against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan before the Security Council and helped push through a General Assembly resolution condemning the Soviet action. Despite his solid reputation as a professional, McHenry was unable to avoid controversy. In March 1980 the vote he cast for a UN resolution opposing Israel's policy of creating Jewish settlements in the West Bank raised a storm of protest in the U.S. and Israel. The administration was on record as opposing the policy but, out of consideration for Israeli sensibilities, had never before voted in favour of such a resolution. In the aftermath, Carter blamed poor communications within the administration for the \"mistake.\" However that may have been, some critics charged that McHenry's vote was in keeping with his personal attitude.\n\nMcHenry, James (b.

Labor governments of 1925-27 and 1930-32 and was elected party leader in 1939 during Labor's seven years in opposition. He became premier when Labor won the 1941 election and remained in office when his government was returned in 1944. McKell's appointment as governor-general in 1947 while an active politician was controversial, but he always maintained the strict impartiality that befitted the monarch's representative in Australia. He was knighted in 1951.\n\nMcKelvie, Samuel Roy (b. April 15, 1881, near Fairfield, Neb. - d. Jan. 6, 1956, near Mesa, Ariz.), governor of Nebraska (1919-23).\n\nMcKenna, Joseph (b.

Sept. 14, 1901, Buffalo, N.Y.), president of the United States (1897-1901). During the U.S. Civil War (1861-65) he served under Col. Rutherford B. Hayes, who made him his aide-de-camp and subsequently encouraged his political career. In 1869 he entered public life as county prosecuting attorney. Elected to Congress, where he served for 14 years (1877-91), he became particularly well known for his support of high tariffs to protect U.S. industry from foreign competition. He was defeated for reelection in 1890, but he had won the admiration of Mark Hanna, a wealthy Ohio industrialist who was active in the Republican Party. With the support of Hanna he was elected governor of Ohio and served two terms (1892-96), while Hanna laid plans to win the Republican presidential nomination for him in 1896. McKinley won the nomination easily on a platform stressing high protective tariffs and the maintenance of the gold standard. He defeated the Democratic candidate William Jennings Bryan by an electoral vote of 271 to 176. After the mysterious sinking of the U.S. battleship Maine in the harbour at Havana (Feb. 15, 1898), sentiment in the U.S. increasingly demanded armed intervention against Spain. Despite evidence that Spain was prepared to make major concessions, McKinley referred the issue to Congress, which authorized him (April 20, 1898) to intervene with armed force to drive the Spanish out of Cuba. In the short war that followed, the U.S. defeated Spanish forces in Cuba and on the seas. He was renominated by the Republicans without opposition and, in a period of prosperity, was returned to office by a large majority in the election of 1900. He was fatally shot on Sept. 6, 1901, by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist.\n\nMcKinly, John (b. Feb. 24, 1721, northern Ireland - d.

Sept. 6, 1961, George Town, Cayman Islands), premier of the Cayman Islands (2013-21); knighted 2021.\n\nAudrey McLaughlin\n\nMcLaughlin, Audrey (Marlene), née Brown (b. Nov. 7, 1936, Dutton, Ont.), Canadian politician. In Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, she became a political organizer for the New Democratic Party (NDP) and managed the election campaign of Roger Kimmerly for justice minister of the Yukon Territory. Well known as a backroom political organizer, she ran for the Whitehorse City Council but lost (1982). In 1987 she was elected MP for the Yukon in a by-election called to fill a vacated seat. In the House of Commons she was her party's critic for Northern Development, Tourism, the constitution, and Revenue Canada. On Dec. 2, 1989, she was elected leader of the federal NDP. She thus became the first woman in Canada to lead a major political party. Her spirited and conciliatory acceptance speech signaled her leadership style. Unpretentious and not bombastic, McLaughlin defined her leadership in terms of consensus making and team building. For the next six years she led the party through a tumultuous time during which the NDP formed the provincial governments in Ontario in 1990, under the leadership of Bob Rae, and in British Columbia in 1991, under Michael Harcourt. The NDP returned to government under Roy Romanow in Saskatchewan. But Canadians, distressed by nine years of government under Conservative Brian Mulroney, turned to the Liberals in the 1993 general election. As a result, only nine NDP MPs were elected, three less than that required for official party status in the House of Commons. She stepped down as leader in October 1995 and did not seek reelection as MP in 1997. She went on to become president of the Socialist International Women and special representative for the government of the Yukon on circumpolar affairs.\n\nMcLaughlin, John (Edward) (b.

Dec. 1, 2002, Alexandria, Va.), U.S. administrator. His career in aviation and space spanned many years in both government and the private sector. He worked at the Defense Department in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and was named assistant secretary-general for scientific affairs at NATO headquarters in Paris.

Appointed as undersecretary of the Air Force in 1969, he served during the Nixon and Ford administrations as Air Force secretary (1973-75) and then as head of the Federal Aviation Administration (1975-77). He also held various senior positions at Communications Satellite Corp., which was created by Congress in 1962 and later was acquired by Lockheed Martin. He retired in 1985 as executive vice president. Lastly, he was board chairman of the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation, which develops communications projects and gives grants to scholars in space-related sciences.\n\nMcMahon, Sir (Arthur) Henry (b. Nov. 28, 1862, Simla [now Shimla, Himachal Pradesh], India - d. Dec. 29, 1949, London, England), chief commissioner of Baluchistan (1907-11) and high commissioner of Egypt (1915-17); knighted 1906.\n\nMcMahon, Sir Richard (James) (b. May 1, 1962), bailiff of Guernsey (2020- ); knighted 2023. He was deputy bailiff in 2012-20.\n\nW. McMahon\n\nMcMahon, Sir William (b. Feb. 23, 1908, Sydney, N.S.W. - d. March 31, 1988, Sydney), prime minister of Australia (1971-72). He served in the House of Representatives for Lowe (New South Wales) from 1949 to 1982. A member of every cabinet from 1951 to 1972, he was minister of labour and national service (1958-66), treasurer (1966-69), and foreign minister (1969-71). He served as deputy leader of the Liberal Party from 1966 to 1971. In 1968 he lost his bid to become party leader and, therefore, prime minister, in part because of opposition from the Country Party (the coalition's junior partner). He became party leader and prime minister in March 1971 after an internal shake-up forced John Gorton to step down. As prime minister, McMahon supported the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), withdrew Australian troops from Vietnam, and advocated stronger ties with other Southeast Asian nations. His criticism of the Labor Party's sending a delegation to China was undercut by news of U.S. president Richard Nixon's coming trip. Labor accused him of following the lead of the U.S. too closely in foreign policy. He was unable to overcome opposition from the Country Party leadership and from rivals within his own party, and in the elections of late 1972 the crumbling coalition was defeated by the Labor Party led by Gough Whitlam. McMahon was replaced as party leader immediately after the election, and he did not hold cabinet office after the Liberals regained power in 1975, although he remained in parliament until his retirement in 1982. He was knighted in 1977.\n\nMcMahon-Box, Joseph Patrick (b. 1891 - d. April 15, 1944), resident commissioner of Niue (1942-43).\n\nMcManus, Charles (b. Aug. 21, 1925 - d.

He was also a U.S. senator from South Dakota (1925-31).\n\nMcMath, Sidney S(anders), byname Sid McMath (b. June 14, 1912, near Magnolia, Ark. - d. Oct. 4, 2003, Little Rock, Ark.), governor of Arkansas (1949-53). He became a prosecutor in Hot Springs and won election to his first of two terms as governor in 1948. \"He was a young, progressive governor who had cleaned up Hot Springs and done real good things for Arkansas, real tolerant in race, and tried to do a lot for education and roads,\" said Cal Ledbetter, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. The year McMath left office, however, a commission was investigating allegations of scandals in the state Highway Department during the McMath administration. Grand juries returned indictments against three members of McMath's administration. Juries acquitted two of them, and a judge threw out the charges against the third. Nothing ever directly linked McMath to any wrongdoing, but McMath spent 50 years living down the allegations. In his book Promises Kept, released in 2003, he chronicled a dozen years of public service that began with his World War II military service in the South Pacific and ended with his 1952 defeat for a third term as governor in the midst of the scandal. \"The public remembers the charges, but the exonerations are forgotten,\" he said in a 2002 interview. In 1954, he made an unsuccessful attempt to oust Sen. John L. McClellan, a Democrat. Eight years later, he ran again for governor but lost to Gov. Orval E. Faubus.\n\nMcMillan, Sir Daniel Hunter (b.

A Democrat, he was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1951 and served as lieutenant governor from 1963 until he became governor after the resignation of Donald Russell. Known as one of the first \"New South\" governors who helped bring business and industry to the state, he also was known for his help in smoothing the path to integration in the state. However, one of the most tragic chapters in South Carolina's civil rights movement happened during his governorship, when three black students were killed protesting a segregated bowling alley in Orangeburg, an event known as the \"Orangeburg Massacre\" (Feb. 8, 1968). At the time, McNair called it one of the saddest days in the state's history. He was also heavily involved in education opportunities and helped develop Francis Marion University.\n\nMcNamara, Robert S(trange) (b. June 9, 1916, San Francisco, Calif. - d.

He served as regent (1968-71) before Zwelithini was crowned king, and remained highly influential until 1994, when South Africa elected its first democratic government. Since then his public profile diminished considerably. The prince's support for the African National Congress made him many enemies among the Zulus, the majority of whom support the nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. There were several reports of attempts on Mcwayizeni's life since he joined the ANC in 1990. The ANC and Inkatha were at loggerheads for years and their ongoing conflict in KwaZulu-Natal province claimed thousands of lives.\n\nMcWherter, Ned Ray (b. Oct. 15, 1930, Palmersville, Tenn. - d.

Jan. 10, 1980, Washington, D.C.), U.S. labour leader. He became secretary-treasurer of the New York Building Trades Council in 1923, president of the New York State Federation of Labor in 1934, and served (1940-52) as secretary-treasurer of the national American Federation of Labor (AFL) before becoming its president in 1952. Meany's greatest accomplishment was the 1955 merger of two competitive and dissimilar organizations: the AFL, which organized crafts, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which organized workers by industry. As president of the unified AFL-CIO (1955-79), Meany never hesitated to promote his conservative views: he criticized a succession of presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Jimmy Carter for their economic and foreign policies; he adamantly opposed Communism and helped lead (1977) the U.S. out of the International Labour Organization when it refused to criticize repressive labour policies in Communist countries; and he hawkishly supported U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam when it was not in vogue to do so. In 1957 he expelled the Teamsters Union from the AFL-CIO on the grounds that its leaders, notably Dave Beck and Jimmy Hoffa, were corrupt, but critics asserted that Meany took action only when the public was aroused. Meany was also taken to task for his foot-dragging on racial integration, but he supported a provision for equal job opportunities that was included in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. His later disputes with Walter Reuther, former CIO president and president of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), resulted in the withdrawal (1968) of the UAW from the AFL-CIO. On Nov. 15, 1979, the nation's grand old man of organized labour retired after 12 successive terms as AFL-CIO president.\n\nMebazaa\n\nMebazaa, Fouad, Arabic in full Muhammad Fu´ad al-Mibaza` (b.
