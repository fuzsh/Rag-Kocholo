        "text": "The Tanzimat Edict (Imperial Edict of Reorganisation) is a turning point in the history of the Ottoman Empire. It is considered to be the first official step of the attempts to become a modern state. A formal process was initiated with this edict and, within this context, the empire started to change the imperial structures and institutions and devoted considerable efforts to create a Western-style organisation. On the other hand, turning towards the West with the declaration of the edict, the Ottoman Empire ultimately found itself in a structural and cultural dilemma. It can be stated that actions for modernisation within the Empire were not a grassroots internal dynamic; rather, they were results of the insistence of the Sultan along with the pressure and encouragement by external dynamics. Developments in Western societies proved fatal for the traditional state with a chain of industrial, political and philosophical revolutions. Afterwards, replacing the traditional state, the concept and practice of the “modern state” were imitated by many other states including the Ottoman Empire. In this respect, with the dynamics of modernisation, traditional values acting as the sources of legitimacy in the traditional state were supplanted by modern ones. God is no longer the source of legitimacy; subjects have been replaced by citizens and law has been the cornerstone of the modern state. Mahmud II laid the social and structural foundations of the Tanzimat Edict, but the edict itself was declared during the reign of Abdülmecit I. The edict occupies a significant position within the theory of the modern state because it is a product of a period in which the Ottoman Empire shifted towards the axis of a modern state. The present study examines the historical and sociological conditions setting the scene for the Tanzimat Edict, the social and political structure altered by the edict and the impacts on the social and political context of the Empire.\n\nThis article deals with analysis of publication of Gülhane noble decree (3 November 1839) which is an eminent event in the modern history of the Ottoman Empire. Promises of sultan Abdülmecid I contained in this document in fact opened the door for a reform period called tanzimat, which is mostly put between years 1839‒1876. This article also focuses on earlier attempts of reorganization and modernization of the empire, especially on reforms of sultan Selim III and sultan Mahmut II. Knowledge of these reforms is necessary for understanding the events of 1839. An important part of this article is formed by analysing circumstances of Gülhane decree origins and the English version of its text.\n\nDemocratic organisations and elected councils are vital to embody the democratic regimes shaped by the \" rule of law principle \" of the modern times. The initial traces of democratic change can be found in the moments when the elected organs and elected representatives started to become effective. Such organisations and councils have started to emerge during the modernization periods such as the Tanzimat Era in the last century of the Ottoman Empire and played a significant role in political and administrative structuring. When considered from this point of view, modernization of Ottoman administration was not only a movement initiated and handled by the central authority, but a time period where the organisations and councils were the determinants shaped by the genuine conditions of the periphery. These reformist and representative structures were the most important milestones of the modernization process until the establishment of Turkish Republic.\n\nParallel to Arab Nahḍah, Ottoman modernization program is associated with the Tanzimat, a period of drastic social, political and institutional transformation. The word tanẓīmāt itself, however, merely means “regulations” or “reorganization” and very little has been done in investigating the conceptual or ideational foundations of Tanzimat reforms. The question at stake here is how these series of reforms were justified and legitimized within the Ottoman political culture. Accordingly, this paper focuses on reform debates among Ottoman bureaucrats and statesmen in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and proposes the concept and doctrine of taǧdīd (renewal) as a key to understanding Ottoman reform and religious transformation. Ottoman reformers at the turn of 19th century resorted to the doctrine of centennial renewal in order to both criticize the moral shortcomings of Ottoman political system and legitimize innovation. Within this logic, Ottoman reformist sultans and politicians have frequently been referred to as muǧaddids, that is restorers. This paper will present an account of the concept of taǧdīd based on Ottoman political and historical writing from the period. I argue that Ottoman reform was inseparable from the logic of religious revival and that Ottoman debates should be considered as part of and discussed in relation to the 18th-century Muslim revivalism which has attracted growing attention in the last decade."
