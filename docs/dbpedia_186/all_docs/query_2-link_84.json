        "text": "Mehmet Şerif Pasha (1865, Üsküdar, Istanbul - December 22, 1951; Catanzaro, Italy), a founding member of Kurd Society for Cooperation and Progress and representative of the Society for the Elevation of Kurdistan to the Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920). He was a leading Kurdish nationalist. He was the son of Said Pasha Kurd, nephew of Kurd Ahmet Izzet Pasha and Mustafa Yamulki, brother of Kurd Fuad Pasha and brother in law of Said Halim Pasha, and cousin of Abdul Aziz Yamulki. He was descended from a noble Kurdish family of the Emirate of Baban. Sherif Pasha was the Ottoman Ambassador to Stockholm between 1898 and 1908 and the second documented Kurd in Sweden, Sherif Pasha lived in Sweden for ten years. The first documented Kurd in Sweden was the physician Mirza Seid from east Kurdistan (Iran) who came 1893. Before 1908 Sherif Pasha was a supporter of the Young Turk movement and provided economic support to Ahmed Riza, a young Turk leader in Paris. After the 1908 Revolution he returned to the Ottoman Empire and headed up the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) branch in the Istanbul district of Pangaltı. However, he soon fell out with the CUP. The reasons for this are debated. According to Sherif Pasha and his supporters, he was concerned with the role of the military in politics. However, his detractors claim that he had been angered by the fact that he had not been appointed the Porte's Representative London. He exposed and opposed the CUP's Turkist programme and its desire to mobilise all available means to assimilate or Turkify the empire's non Turkish nations. Günter Behrendt states that he was a follower of Sultan Abdülhamid II. After the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the CUP actually wanted to sentence to death for his opposition to their views, but Şerif Pasha was aware that the situation was difficult for him and he fled into exile abroad before he could be apprehended. In 1908, he co-founded the Kurd Society for Cooperation and Progress in Constantinople together with Emin Ali Bedir Khan and Abdulkadir Ubeydullah."
