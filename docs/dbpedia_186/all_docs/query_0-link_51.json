        "text": "The initial aim was to provide education to apprentices working in the Grand Bazaar and its surroundings. Classes started after the old Valide School in Beyazıt was renovated. The school had only one classroom.\n\nAll lesson materials were provided by the Daruşşafaka Society to those who were attending the classes, and teachers were working as volunteers. Considered the first public school in Turkey, this “apprentice school” continued giving education to its students until 1873.\n\nAccording to the 26 March 172 regulations of the Society, it is stated that ‘’The Society will be grounded on the devotion to the nation and nation efforts, and its members will consist of people, who will work for these devotions.’’\n\nThe same regulation envisaged that, the building they were constructing would, ‘’accept children younger than 9-10 years of age, the community would cover every expense of the students, form an administration and institution for the education, and appoint a director.’’ (Nazıma Antel, who served from 1965-73, could not become the director of the school, as the school did not accept female students until 1971.)\n\nDarüşşafakat’ül İslamiye was established on 25 June 1873 as a no-fee boarding school with special status and started its first academic term on 28 June with its 54 students along with a first lecture given by Captain Mustafa Effendi. The curriculum comprised the programs of primary, secondary, and high schools and was of higher quality than the education implemented in schools under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. The syllabi of the last 2 years of the 8-year school were prepared in accordance with the Turkish university education program. Darüşşafaka graduates were therefore deemed as college graduates until 1894. Additionally, the last year was called “Telegraphy School”, and the school was known as a “telegraphy school” between the years 1873 and 1894.\n\nKnown as “the ’93 War”, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 during the time of the Ottoman Empire had an impact on education at Darüşşafaka. Thousands of people from the occupied territories migrated to Istanbul. More than a thousand male and female children were quartered in the Darüşşafaka building by the Society. In time, some of them were sent to be sheltered in other places whereas male orphans were enrolled at Darüşşafaka. Thereafter, the school functioned as before. However, some classes were canceled for about six months (as the instructors, who were mostly military officers, had left for the war).\n\nUntil this date, there had been no high schools in the country other than Darüşşafaka, Galatasaray, and the military high schools. Many elite and prominent figures of the time served as voluntary instructors at Darüşşafaka during the 1880s and up until the mid-1990s. Among them were national poet Namık Kemal, state chronicler Abdurrahman Şeref Beg, Manyasizade Mustafa Refik Beg, Babanzade Naim Beg, composer Zekai Effendi, Ahmet Mithat Effendi, painter Agah Effendi, Selim Sırrı Tarcan, poet Yahya Kemal Beyatlı, historian Yusuf Akçura, Tahir Olgun, and painter Hoca Ali Rıza. Additionally, lots of important artists, scientists, and scholars such as mathematicians Salih Zeki and Mehmet İzzet, financier Hasan Ferit, litterateurs Ahmet Rasim and İsmail Safa, historian Osman Nuri Ergin, educator Ali Kami Akyüz, who served as the headmaster of the school from 1920 to 1940, and painter Mahmut Cûda were Darüşşafaka alumni; most of them served as instructors at Darüşşafaka for many years. The presentation of paintings by Darüşşafaka graduates, along with their names, to the Sultan became a tradition.\n\nDarüşşafaka stood up with the financial help of society. Visiting the school in 1884, being very content, Sadrazam Küçük Said Paşa and his venture, some of the missing things for Darüşşafaka were covered by the government’s own treasure. Abdulhamid the second, that year received six graduates, who gave their handmade paintings to the Sultan, in order to thank him and show their gratitude. After this, it has become a tradition that graduates, present their names and paintings to the Sultan.\n\nDue to a resistance movement that arose among students, the School was seized by the state, and eventually, the administrative authority was given to the Ministry of Education. Consequently, it put an end to the practice of intellectuals volunteering as instructors. Cemiyet-i Tedrisiye-i İslamiye disbanded. Turned into a public school, Darüşşafaka deviated from its original purpose. Non-orphans as well as some children of Turkiye’s notable families were accepted to the school. It continued as such until the second constitutional period in 1908.\n\nWith the start of the second constitutional era, former members of the Society and Darüşşafaka graduates came together. They formed an alumni association, Darüşşafaka Mezunin Cemiyeti, and decided to work to sustain the School. In 1909, the members of Cemiyet-i Tedrisiye-i İslamiye convened under the chairmanship of the Grand Vizier, who was the titular chair, by also inviting the famous politicians of the time. Being back on track, the Society firstly applied to the Ministry of Education to resume administration of the school. The return of administrative authority occurred within the same year.\n\nDarüşşafaka had a rough time during the period of World War I and the following Turkish War of Independence; however, the very same period also signifies very active, as well as meaningful years for the School for many reasons:\n\nThe expenses of the School were partially covered by the government from 1914 to 1916. Although financial difficulties increased towards the end of the war, the School persevered with the help of donations. In the meantime, the period of study was decided to be increased from eight to ten years, and courses on the teaching profession in the last two years of school were added to the curriculum, Darüşşafaka was thus identified as a teaching college. In 1919, the period of study was reduced back to eight years.\n\nThe Society admitted women as members for the first time.\n\nDarüşşafaka Sports Club was established (1914).\n\nThe number of members of the Society, which was only 150 at the time of the reestablishment in 1909, increased to 700 in 1916, and to 1,400 in 1917.\n\nDarüşşafaka admitted no new students in 1919 and 1920. As a result, the number of students dropped to 200.\n\nStudent admission through an entrance exam was reinstated in the 1921-1922 academic year.\n\nZübeyde Hanım, the mother of the great leader Atatürk, supported the education of Darüşşafaka students by donating 20,000 kurush on 28 November 1921. Zübeyde Hanım, who chose Darüşşafaka to give donations to during the days of the War of Independence, was described, in the certificate issued for her donation, as the “Mother of His Highness Ghazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha, the Grand National Assembly President for the Ankara Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the Turkish Revolutionaries for Anatolia”. Having always been a strict follower of what Zübeyde Hanım’s donation required, the Darüşşafaka Society organized Qur’an and Mawlid recitations, along with after-recitation prayers, every year on the day coinciding with the Night of Qadr for the beloved souls of its deceased donors including, in particular, Zübeyde Hanım, as well as the great leader Atatürk and his fellow fighters, Darüşşafaka founders, those who served for the Society, and all of our soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the nation.\n\nThe tradition of providing Darüşşafaka students the opportunity to eat seasonal fruits at any time is also an invaluable legacy of Zübeyde Hanım. The school honors this legacy by always keeping the fruit baskets placed in the school corridors full and available to all of the students. To train primary school teachers, a separate “teachers class”, equivalent to the level of the senior class of the teaching colleges, was opened. The first group graduated in 1929. However, the class was closed in 1930, upon the request of the Ministry.\n\nAfter the Proclamation of the Republic, releasing the Tevhid-i Tedrisat Laws (Educational Unity) in 1924, they planned on uniting education, secularizing, and bringing nationality up forwards in history and religion. The Board of Management of the Society decided to make extensive changes in the educational program. Darüşşafa became a ‘’Complete Circuit High School,’’ in positions of private high school, they started using the program of state schools, for middle and high schoolers and getting the name ‘’Darüşşafaka High School.’’ These regulations were approved by the Board of Education and the graduates were admitted to schools like Istanbul University and other colleges without an exam.\n\nIn parallel with state high schools, Darüşşafaka students had the right to repeat a year. However, the Society adopted a new decision to cancel this practice in order to make sure that students were more qualified and aware of how much money and time were invested in their education. As of 1940, students that fail any class are expelled from the school.\n\nRecep Peker, Hasan Saka (also a member of the Society), and Şemseddin Günaltay, who were prime ministers holding office during the 40s, were closely interested in Darüşşafaka; they focused mainly on the admission of female students to the School, and their governments supported Darüşşafaka.\n\nUpon the death of poet and writer Sait Faik Abasıyanık, his mother, Makbule Abasıyanık, donated the copyright of his books and some of his assets to Darüşşafaka as per his wish. In 1955, she also initiated the “Sait Faik Story Award” to be given each year on the anniversary of his death (11 May) to the favorite storybook of the previous year. The Award, given in cooperation between Darüşşafaka and Yapı Kredi Publishing House from 2003 to 2011, is presented in cooperation with İşbank as of 2012. In 1964, Darüşşafaka transformed Sait Faik’s home in Burgazada into a museum open to the public.\n\nIt was decided the School would move out of the facilities in Fatih and the Society would construct “residences” for the donors to ensure that they would spend their older ages in a safe and healthy environment. Part of the treasury’s land in Maslak Balabandere, which had been allocated to the Ministry of National Defense and was about to be transferred to Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, was assigned to the Society thanks to the close interest of Minister of National Defense Zeki Yavuztürk and the support of the then President Kenan Evren. A competition was organized to decide on the architectural project, and a jury was formed. The project by Master Architect Dr. Fatih Gorbon came first in the competition. Thereafter, the construction of the Maslak Campus began. Darüşşafaka’s 120-year-old building was sold to Ziraat Bank.\n\nFundamental changes took place regarding both the Society and the School administration:\n\nAs a result of several meetings held with the participation of the administrators of both the Society and School, teachers, representatives from among the students, the Parent-Teacher Association, and education experts, a 5-year strategic plan (2007-2012) was developed to guide the progress of the school.\n\nUrla Residence started operating in İzmir.\n\nDarüşşafaka Primary School initiated a column writing competition titled “Ahmet Rasim Is Alive” among the primary schools in Istanbul in order to honor the memory of journalist and writer Ahmet Rasim, who was both a graduate of and a teacher at Darüşşafaka.\n\nA new testing system based on intelligence, skills, and creativity instead of knowledge was adopted to advance the implementation of the principle of “Equal Opportunity in Education” and ensure that talented children living in rural areas where opportunities are more limited compared to big cities can pass the Darüşşafaka Entrance Exam. Additionally, the number of provinces where the exam was conducted was increased.\n\nThe School started the “Darüşşafaka Seeks Its Parents” program, as well as annual donation campaigns within the Darüşşafaka family.\n\nThe project “81 Students from 81 Provinces” was initiated in cooperation with İşbank, and the first students enrolled within this scope began studying at Darüşşafaka.\n\nThe Darüşşafaka Schools Regulation was converted into two separate documents titled Ministry of National Education Private Darüşşafaka Primary School Regulation and Ministry of National Education Private Darüşşafaka High School Regulation, and these two were approved by the Board of Education and Discipline of the Ministry of National Education on 13 September 2011.\n\nIn memory of Nazima Antel, the first headmistress of Darüşşafaka, the School began presenting “Nazıma Antel Awards” to students who achieved success in the field of English in extracurricular activities.\n\nOn the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the acceptance of female students to Darüşşafaka, the “40th Anniversary of Daçka Girls” campaign was initiated by female Darüşşafaka alumni to collect TL 1,000,000, which is the total amount of 10-year educational expenses for 10 female students.\n\nDarüşşafaka celebrated its 150th anniversary.\n\nSait Faik Abasıyanık Museum was opened after being renovated.\n\nThe Darüşşafaka Society received 8.4 points out of 10 in the rating that is designed by Kobirate Uluslararası Kredi Derecelendirme ve Kurumsal Yönetim Hizmetleri A.Ş. in compliance with the Corporate Governance Principles of Capital Markets Board of Turkey and performed in accordance with the Methodology of Rating of Compliance of Non-governmental Organizations, which is approved by the same regulatory authority. Darüşşafaka became the first NGO in Turkey to document its transparency, accountability, and sustainability by having an independent corporate governance rating agency conduct such work.\n\nIn order to adapt to the education system known as 4+4+4, Darüşşafaka Schools canceled the primary school classes and started accepting 5th graders instead of 4th in the 2013/14 school year. Since Darüşşafaka Secondary School had 5th-grade classes already filled with students who were accepted the previous year as 4th graders, the number of new students to be accepted in that academic year was limited to 75."
