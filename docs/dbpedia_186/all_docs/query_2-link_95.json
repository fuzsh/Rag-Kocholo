Chapelot, Paris, 1900-1908. Ahmed Izzet Pasha (1864 ? 1937), known as Ahmet Izzet Furgaç after the Turkish Surname Law of 1934, was an Ottoman general of ethnic Albanian descent during World War I. He was also one of the last Grand Viziers of the Ottoman Empire (14 October 1918 - 8 November 1918) and its last Minister of Foreign Affairs. Ahmed Izzet Pasha's decisions during the Caucasus Campaign have been criticized and regarded as one of the factors of its failure, while his subsequent high reputation in Turkey has been attributed to his successful activity during the Turkish War of Independence. #31184. - Les Occasions Perdues / Autres Occasions Perdues.
