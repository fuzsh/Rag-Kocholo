        "text": "Musir (Field Marshal) Ahmet Izzet Pasha (centre, taking the salute) and a group of Turkish officers arriving in Jerusalem at the railway station. Ahmet Izzet Pasha, born in 1864, had been commander of Turkish forces on the Caucasus front. He was appointed Grand Vizir, replacing Enver and Talat, when the new Sultan Mehmet VI came to the throne on 3 July 1918. He negotiated the Armistice which ended the war in the Middle East, and took a major role in the Turkish War of Independence. He took the family name Furgac following the abolition of the Caliphate. He died in 1937. This is one of a series of photographs, probably taken by a Turkish official photographer, collected by 2120 Private (Pte) Murtie Cecil Carlian, 14th Light Horse.\n\nOpening Hours\n\n10 am to 5 pm daily (except Christmas Day)\n\nIn preparation for the daily Last Post Ceremony,\n\ngalleries are progressively closed from 3:40 pm.\n\nPublic entrance via Fairbairn Avenue, Campbell ACT 2612\n\nBook your ticket to visit: awm.gov.au/visit"
