        "text": "The counterinsurgency campaigns in the empire’s periphery were unlike those fought in the core areas of Macedonia and Anatolia and demonstrate another side of Ottoman counterinsurgency practices. This was because, as Ottoman military strength was drawn to, and concentrated in, the core areas, it became possible in the distant provinces for traditional tribal and leader-centric rebellion to take root. Moreover, unlike the committee-led insurgencies in the core areas, which failed to engage a majority of the respective populations, insurgencies in the periphery found broad popular support. This changed the dynamic in favor of the insurgents and, in the end, made it impossible for the Ottomans to succeed. These hard-fought counterinsurgency campaigns in the periphery ended in military failure leading to negotiated settlements."
