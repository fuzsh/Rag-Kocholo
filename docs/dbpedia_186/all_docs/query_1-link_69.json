        "text": "Introduction\n\nAmong the countless instances of violence observed during the First World War, the extermination of the Armenians constitutes the bloodiest episode that affected the civilian population: around 1.5 million people lost their lives in 1915-1916âvictims of the Young Turk regime (Cf. infra, âThe Consequences of Mass Violenceâ). The context of warâwith Turkey on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungaryâcreated propitious conditions for a massive outburst of violence and allowed for the legitimization of measures that were inconceivable in times of peace. Between April and September of 1915, the 3000-year-old Armenian landâthe Armenian provinces of the East and of Asia Minorâwere methodically emptied of their populationâwiped off the mapâin the space of a few months.\n\nThe Young Turk Committee was strongly influenced by a Europe racked by extreme nationalist movements but still dominated by liberal governments. It was the first nationalist party to rise to power that would conceptualize and execute a program of extermination against a segment of its population which had previously, as a social body, been excluded as an âinternal enemy.â This destruction was carried out as a necessary condition of the formation of the Turkish Nation-State.\n\nFor decades, this crime has not been the object of any study acknowledging it as such, but has, in response, engendered a vast literature of accounts almost exclusively published in Armenian. This corpus of works shows the individual and collective experience of the victims, but has remained inexorably confined to the Armenian world. The material only took shape with the bringing to light of the contents of the archives of Germany, Austria-Hungary (States allied with Turkey), and the United States (a neutral country), as well as the instructional records prepared after the Mudros Armistice, which put an end to the war with the Ottoman Empire.\n\nOfficial documents, laws of deportation and confiscation of âabandoned propertiesâ, statistics, examinations of high-ranking officers, orders by coded telegram, and martial court archives from the years 1915-1916 constitute an invaluable collection for the documentation of the extermination procedures. We nevertheless remain dependent upon the memoirs of some high-ranking cadres of the Young Turk party (Committee of Union and ProgressâCUP) and its paramilitary wing, the Special Organization, in charge of the execution of the extermination program, in order to understand the decision-making process. Only a few documents emanating from the central Young Turk committee and its armed wing are known to this day.\n\nThe escalation of nationalist movements and the mass violence associated with them, which affected other groups (Syrian Christians, Jacobites, Chaldeans, etc.), and which included Kurds as well, will be treated in other chronological indexes.\n\nIdeological Bases of Mass Violence\n\nAlthough the subsciption of the Young Turks to Social Darwinism (the theory of the application to humans of the survival-of-the-fittest in the animal world) had convinced them that the construction of the Turkish nation would be realized through the elimination of the Armenians, the central Young Turk Committee had envisaged leaving certain groups of Armenians alive so that they could better integrate them into their program to turkify Asia Minor. Young children, particularly girls, along with younger and older women were destined to reinforce the Turkish nation upon a ritual of integration into the dominant group, which subscribed to the religion of Islam. According to the expression of one Young Turk official, young Armenian girls that had a certain level of education were to help accelerate the modernization of the family and of Turkish society. An inventory of many accounts demonstrates that the nationalist Young Turk ideology was more about a discrimination against the collective identity of a group than a rejection of individual biology as was later practiced by the Nazi regime.\n\nAnother aspect of the Young Turk project concerns the usurpation of the individual and collective property of Ottoman Armenians accompanying the attempts to form a Turkish middle-class of businessmen, practically inexistent before. This program, named MillÃ® Ä°ktisat (âNational Economyâ), theorized by the regime ideologist Ziya GÃ¶kalp, included the socio-economic element of crime, which is at the same time an instrument of justification and incitement. It appeared that this practice mostly benefited the Young Turk elite and the State-party, but also was to assist all sectors of society, particularly those engaged in the Young Turk movement, without significantly parting from the extremist ideology of its leadership. The lure of income had undoubtedly contributed to the radicalization of men who, in other circumstances, would never have participated in such acts.\n\nAn inventory of those especially accountable in this program of exterminationâcivilian and military officials or local notablesâallows us to confirm that those most heavily implicated in acts of mass violence were often marginalized groups, including minorities from the Caucasus, particularly Circassians and Chechens, along with nomadic Kurdish tribes (and less often settled villagers). The nine members of the Central Committee, and particularly the Minister of the Interior, Mehmed Talat, and the Minister of War, Ä°smail Enver, along with Dr. Ahmed NazÄ±m and Bahaeddin Åakir, were the chief instigators of the extermination of the Armenian population. They were condemned to death in abstentia in 1919 by the military tribunal in Istanbul.\n\nThe Process of the Radicalization of the Young Turks in Power (January 1914-March 1915)\n\nDuring the long reign of Sultan AbdÃ¼lhamid II (1876-1909), marked early on by the Treaty of Berlin (1878), which dispossessed the Ottomans of part of their European lands, observers witnessed widespread massacres (1894-1896). For a long time, it was supposed that a continuity between the anti-Armenian policies of the Hamidian regime and those of the Young Turks (in power from 1908 to 1918) existed. The theory that the program of systematical destruction of the Armenian population was begun under AbdÃ¼lhamid II and realized by the Young Turks was rejected once historians were able to highlight their respective ideological resilience.\n\nOne cannot compare the Hamidian efforts to decapitate part of the Armenian social bodyâwhich was aimed mainly at malesâin an attempt to reduce them to âacceptableâ demographic proportions with the policy of ethnical homogenization of Asia Minor conceived by the CUP. Today, we have a better understanding of the processes that led to the elimination of the Armenian population, which was signaled by the successive decisions that marked the radicalization of the Young Turk State-party. It is first necessary to highlight the fact that the project to turkify the Anatolian lands, entertained by the leaders of the CUP before their accession to power in July 1908, does not seem to have been initially conceived as a project of systematic extermination. The plan to deport the Greeks from the Aegean coastal areas and the Armenians from the eastern provinces elaborated by the Young Turk Central Committee in February 1914 served its desire to transform the demographic composition of Asia Minor and to create a âTurkishâ land, but was not necessarily designed to exterminate its non-Turkish elements (AkÃ§am 2004). The Armenians, initially placed after the Greeks in the partyâs priorities, were supposed to populate the Syrian and Mesopotamian deserts, considered to be spaces outside of the Turkish sanctuary. But the ambitions of the CUP were not merely confined to these population exchanges. Non-Turkish Muslims, which were classified in a hierarchy according to their capacity to assimilate to the âTurkishâ model at hand, were also to be deported (although without physically disappearing) in order to repopulate the lands emptied by the deportation of the Greek and Armenian population. This vast demographic engineering of the historic groups of the Empire, connected to a nationalist ideology, was part of a still more ambitious plan to create a contiguous geographic and demographic territory linked to the Turkish-speaking populations of the Caucasus.\n\nThe crushing defeat suffered by the Ottoman Army at SarÄ±kamÄ±Å at the end of December 1914 had not only convinced the Central Committee of the Young Turks that it would be impossible to realize their ambitions, but also undoubtedly brought them to compensate for this upsetting event with a harsher policy toward its Armenian population. (The Young Turk Central Committee consisted of Mehmed Talat, Minister of the Interior; Midhat ÅÃ¼krÃ¼, Secretary General, Dr. NÃ¢zÄ±m, member of the political wing of the Special Organization; Kara Kemal, Minister of Provisions, who was charged with creating âTurkishâ societies; Yusuf RÄ±za, Head of the Special Organization in the Trabzon region; Ziya GÃ¶kalp, an ideologue of the Committee; Eyub Sabri AkgÃ¶l, from the military; Dr. RÃ¼sÃ»hi, head of the Special Organization in the Azerbaijan and Van regions; Dr. Bahaeddin Åakir, President of the Special Organization; and Halil MenteÅe, Minister of Foreign Affairs.) This stage in the process of radicalization can be dated from March 20-25, 1915 (KÃ©vorkian, 2006: 306-308). Although there was no unanimity among the core of the Young Turk Central Committee (sources report that three of its nine membersâMidhat ÅÃ¼krÃ¼, Ziya GÃ¶kalp, and Kara Kemalâ were opposed to the decision to exterminate), at the same time they did not raise serious resistance to it (Astourian, 1990). As we observe in other cases of mass violence perpetrated by a single-party State, we do not have in our posession a formal document of the decision to exterminate. It was the witnessing of the on-the-ground policies of the State-party that convinced contemporary observersâConsuls stationed in the areas concerned along with American and German ambassadorsâof the premeditated nature of the CUP leadersâ genocidal plans.\n\nFrom the beginning of the month of April 1915, a change in tone with regards to the Armenians in the Young Turk press of Istanbul can be observed. There, the Armenians were presented as âinternal enemiesâ, as traitors who were making common cause with the Triple Entente (France/Great Britain/Russia) and especially with the Russians. Accusations launched by the press of a plot hatched against the security of the State had also undoubtedly served to sway public opinion in favor of the radical measures to be taken against the Armenian population in its entirety.\n\nIn the Ottoman system that still prevailed in 1915, each important historical group enjoyed legitimate representation before the authorities in their respective institutionsâthe Patriarchate or Grand Rabbinate. They were religious in nature but were in reality run by secular representatives. The different political sensibilities were represented by a mostly Istanbul-based elite, whose links with the Young Turk leaders were long established and close. Young Turk and Armenian opposition groups struggled together for years against the Hamidian regime, under which Armenians were not the only ones to suffer from authoritarian acts. The revolution of July 1908 reestablishing the constitution (which had been suspended after just two years of existence), announced a democratization of the regime and equal rights for all citizens regardless of their national or confessional inclination. Ottomanism was, hence, proclaimed as the unifying bond of the Ottoman Empire. The Young Turk revolutionaries and Armenians left their clandestine existence to take on a modern life. Europe was not the last to salute this breeze of freedom, blowing away the âsick man of Europe.â Often having come together in Europe, these Turkish and Armenian elites âboth francophoneâwere not without shared interests. They both advocated common âprogressiveâ values, but were additionally marked by their years of clandestine activity, which had engendered among them a taste for secrecy and the building of underground paramilitary structures. During the first years of the regime, the Young Turk leaders tended to appoint puppet governments with which they were not involved on a public level, in order to better impose their political choices. The names of the nine members of the Young Turk Central Committee were always kept secret.\n\nAn uneasy intimacy existed even between elite Armenians and Young Turks, with both considering themselves to be invested in a âsacredâ mission to save the âNationâ. The massacres in Cilicia in April 1909, which occurred before any event foreshadowing the First World War, marked a turning point in Turkish-Armenian relations. The political treatment of these crimesâapproximately 25,000 Armenian victims in the region bordering the eastern Mediterraneanâconvinced the Armenian elite that the CUP was responsible for those events, and this contributed to a crisis of confidence between the two groups (KÃ©vorkian, 1999: 106-140).\n\nThe despoliation of the Armenian peasants in the eastern provinces, the permanent insecurity in these regions, and the boycott campaigns launched by the CUP against non-Turkish merchants convinced the Armenian elite that the Young Turk government was not at all committed to introducing reforms in zones controlled by Kurdish tribal structures.\n\nIn the complicated set of Turkish-Armenian relations, the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913, which caused practically the complete loss of the Ottoman territories in Europe, heralded another turning point. After the loss of Albania, Macedonia, and a good part of Thrace, Turks and Armenians found themselves facing each other; threats of massacre were made increasingly explicit. The project of reforms in the Armenian provincesâprovided for since 1878 (Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin) but never implementedâappeared to the Armenians as the last hope for stemming the massive migratory trend that was emptying their historical land of its inhabitants. Launched at the end of 1912, this project mobilized international authorities and was based on the negotiations between the Ottoman government and the Great Powers on one side, and between Young Turk leaders and Armenians on the other. In December 1913, Halil Bey and Ahmed Cemal, two members of the Young Turk Central Committee, warned their Armenian âfriendsâ that the CUP would never stand for âinternational supervisionâ of these reforms, which were designed to devide the local power in the Armenian provinces. The single-party regime that was established in January 1914 gave the CUP full powers and led to the first decisions of the Central Committee that aimed to eradicate the Greeks and Armenians, the last two non-Turkish groups who carried some weight, particularly economic, in the Empire.\n\n1914; January 3: Nomination of Ismail Enver to the post of Minister of War by the ten members of the Central Committee (CC) of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). Opposition is eliminated. Single-party rule is established, controlled by a majority of young officers. ** (Turfan, 2000: 348).\n\n1914; January 7: 280 high-ranking officers and a total of 1,100 officers of the Ottoman Army are âimmediately dismissedâ and replaced by officers affiliated with the Young Turk party, who then take control of the army. ** (Turfan, 2000: 348)\n\n1914; January 30: The Young Turk daily Ikdam denies claims that there is a plan âwhose objective is to remove Armenians from the provinces they inhabit and to deport them to Mesopotamia [â¦] [in order to] establish Armenia Muslims who can unify with other Muslims of the Caucasus and form a serious resistance to Slavic encroachments.â ** (KÃ©vorkian, 2006: 306).\n\n1914; February-June: The Young Turk Central Committee puts in place in the course of several secret meetings a âplan to homogenizeâ Anatolia and to liquidate its ânon-Turkish concentrationsâ. This plan aimed above all the expulsion of the Greeks from Thrace and Anatolia, particularly the Aegean coastal areas or to âmove them to the interiorâ by the spring of 1914. It also recommended the transfer of the Armenian population to Syria and Mesopotamia. *** (AkÃ§am, 2004: 144-150; DÃ¼ndar, 2006: 190-220 and Kutay, 1962: 60-63).\n\n1914; July 16: Around twenty individuals along with approximately 100 Armenian militants of the Social Democratic Hentchak Party are arrested and interned in Istanbul. ** (Gidour, I, 1962; Aramiants, I-III, 1918, and La vÃ©ritÃ© sur le mouvement rÃ©volutionnaire, 1916).\n\n1914; August 2: Negotiations conducted between the German ambassador to Istanbul, Baron Wangenheim, and members of the Young Turk Central Committee lead to the signing of a secret treaty that would provide for a military alliance between Germany and the Ottoman Empire against Russia. ** (KÃ©vorkian, 2006: 223-224; Trumpener, 1967: 108-112; and Weber, 1970: 63-65).\n\n1914; August 3: Order of general mobilization and imperial decree [irade] puts the Ottoman Parliament in recess. Beginning of the conscription of Ottoman Armenians between the ages of 20 and 40. ** (KÃ©vorkian, 2006 : 225-226)\n\n1914; August 3: Meeting of the Central Committee (CC) of the CUP resulting in the formation of the Special Organization (OS) [TeÅkilat-Ä± Mahsusa], a paramilitary group that exists independently of the official State structures and charged with the struggle against âinternal enemiesâ. Its political bureau is composed of five of ten members of the CC, Dr. NÃ¢zÄ±m, Dr. Bahaeddin Åakir, Dr. RÃ¼sÃ»hi, Yusuf RÄ±za Bey, and AtÄ±f Bey KamÃ§Ä±l, along with Aziz Bey, Director of General Security in the Ministry of the Interior, and Colonel Cevad. The headquarters of the Organization are set up at the CUP premises on Nuri Osmaniye Street in Istanbul. ** (Kutay, 1962: 36; [Arif Cemil], VakÄ±t, 1933; Takvim-i Vekayi No. 3540, May 5, 1919: 5; KÃ©vorkian, 2006: 226-228).\n\n1914; August 19: Diyarbekir. Arson at the Diyarbekir bazaar, which mostly hosted Armenian entrepreneurs. ** (Agouni, 1921: 60).\n\n1914; August 26: TekirdaÄ/Rodosto (Edirne province). The Armenian quarter is entirely destroyed by an arsonist blaze. ** (KÃ©vorkian, 2006: 684).\n\n1914; September 8: The Dutch Louis-Constant Westenenk, appointed in April 1914 as Inspector of Erzerum (northern sector) to implement reforms in the Armenian provinces, is summoned by the Minister of the Interior. Minister Mehmed Talat dismisses him. ** (Andonian, 1925: 10).\n\n1914; September: The beginning of the recruitment of common criminals freed from prison by decree of the Minister of Justice, and the formation of the SO squads. Installation of the command center of the Organization at Erzerum under the jurisdiction of the 3rd Army to operate in the provinces of Erzerum, Bitlis, Van, Diyarbekir, Harput, Trabzon, Sivas, and the district of Canik. ** (Takvim-i Vekayi (T.V.) No. 3557, May 25, 1919: 97-98; T.V. No. 3540, May 5, 1919: 5, col. 2; T.V. No. 3554, May 21, 1919: 67-69).\n\n1914; October 1: Closure of foreign posts in Istanbul at the order of the Turkish authorities. ** (Andonian, 1925: 13).\n\n1914; Autumn: Pillage of Armenian and Greek merchants carried out under the pretext of military requisitions.\n\n1914; October 21: The Armenian Political Council holds a meeting with its inner circle at Galata along with a certain number of Armenian personalities from all political backgrounds in the Ottoman capital to confer about the evolution of the situation and to take appropriate measures. ** (Zaven Der YÃ©ghiayan, 1947: 72).\n\n1914; October 29: Attack on Odessa and other Russian sites along the Black Sea by the navies of Goeben and Breslau, commanded by Admiral Souchon, by order of the Minister of War, Ismail Enver. *** (Turfan, 2002: 363; Weber, 1970: 83-85; and Trumpener, 1967: 56, n. 85).\n\nThe Context of War, the Deciding Element for the Destruction of the Armenians\n\nThe entry into war on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary undeniably strengthened the most radical members of the Young Turk Central Committee. It created an environment that paved the way for the destruction of the non-Turkish elements of the Ottoman Empire and the Armenians in particular, who were suspected of âtreasonâ. This entry into war permitted the drafting from the beginning of August 1915 of Armenians from the ages of twenty to forty who had been officially disarmed since February 28, 1915, so that they could be gradually exterminated. This measure proved to be highly effective during the subsequent implementation of mass violence as the Armenian âlife forceâ could be neutralized. The entry into war served to legitimize military requisitions, which, once again, turned out to be a veritable pillage of the State primarily upon Armenians and Greeks.\n\n1914; October 30: Meeting of the Congress of Young Turk Party, the expanded direction of the CUP, which decides by voice vote (17 to 10) to enter into war with the Ottoman Empire on the side of Germany. ** (Trumpener, 1967: 56, No. 85).\n\n1914; November 2: The Ottoman Empire declares war on Russia.\n\n1914; November 2: An expanded Armenian Political Council is held at Galata in presence of the principal Armenian personalities in the capital.

According to the memoirs of some of the nine members of the Committee, three of them were in favor of deportation, but not of the extermination of the Armenian population (a point made by HÃ¼seyin Cahit YalÃ§Ä±n, Siyasal AnÄ±lar [Political Memoirs], Istanbul: 1976, and Midhat ÅÃ¼krÃ¼ Bleda, Ä°mparataroluÄun ÃÃ¶kÃ¼ÅÃ¼ [The Fall of the Empire], Istanbul: 1979, 56-59, in Astourian, 1990: 140-141). The plan to destroy was made by the Young Turk Central Committee, but the execution of orders to exterminate were entrusted to a paramilitary group, The Special Organization (TeÅkilÃ¢t-Ä± MahsÃ»sa), which was directed by a political bureau comprised of four of the nine members of the Central CommitteeâDr. Ahmed NÃ¢zÄ±m, Dr. Bahaeddin Åakir, AtÄ±f Bey, and Yusuf RÄ±za Beyâalong with Aziz Bey, the Director of the Criminal Investigations Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior. (The charge of the Ittihadist leaders, read by the President of the military court in Istanbul, during the first convocation of the Unionists trial, which took place April 27, 1919 at 13:50 [Takvim-i Vekayi, No. 3540, (May 5, 1919), p. 5; the copies of documents presented by the court; Seventh meeting of the Unionists trial, June 17, 1919], the deposition of Midhat ÅÃ¼krÃ¼ [Takvim-i Vekayi, No. 3561, May 29, 1919, pp. 115-116, and for the declaration of the Secretary-General of the CUP, p. 119)\n\nThe general headquarters of the Special Organization were based at the central office of the CUP, on Nur el-Osmaniye Street, in Istanbul. The judgments against the Young Turk criminals in 1919 clearly demonstrated the organic link that existed between the party and the Special Organization. All of the telegrams and documents addressed to the provincial networks and presented in the course of the Unionistsâ trials were signed by chiefs of the same party. They demonstrate that the heads at Nur el-Osmaniye acted as the planners and coordinators of the activities carried out on the ground, while the President of the political bureau of the Special Organization, Dr. Bahaeddin Åakir, along with Dr. RÃ¼sÃ»hi and Yusuf RÄ±za Bey, directed the operations on the ground. The Organization also had its correspondent at the heart of the Minister of War, KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼bahÃ§Ä±zÃ¢de EÅref Sencer, who oversaw the formation and equipment of the paramilitary forces of the Special Organization along with the financing of its operations. Its members were recruited from among the officers who were close to the party, and its members came from two sources: common criminals, freed upon the instruction of the Minister of Justice, and members of Circassian and Kurdish tribes. The squadrons thus established were set up either in fixed locales where they operated against the convoys of deportees. The policy of deportations and massacres that followed was overseen from the shared offices of the CUP and the Special Organization, which made use of special ethnographic maps conceived to ensure the demographic homogenization of Asia Minor.\n\nIn the clear divisions of labor, the services of the administration guaranteed the preparatory phases: the police put forth the list of men to be deported; the gendarmerie issued the order to deport the convoys and oversaw their supervision; the services of the Treasury were occupied with âmanagingâ the bank accounts of the deportees and their âabandoned propertiesâ. The local coordinators of these operations were the âSecretary- Responsiblesâ delegated by the party in all the provinces. It seemed that not a single civilian or military authority was able to oppose the orders given by the Young Turk party representatives as far as they concerned the anti-Armenian operations. They had others tasked with the mission of informing local members of the Special Organization of the arrival of the convoys. But it is also known that those civil servants who balked at the orders of deportation that came from the center were immediately relieved of their duties, and some even paid with their lives for their failure to comply.\n\nThe role of the army in this violence must be nuanced. In the 3rd Armyâs jurisdiction, which was present in the six eastern provinces, the army committed genocidal acts against the civilian populations only in the regions of Erzerum, Van, and Bitlis, where the Armenian population was significant.\n\n1915; March 20-25: Several meetings of the Young Turk Central Committee debated the solution to the Armenian question. Dr. Bahaeddin Åakir, who had returned to Istanbul after spending six months in Erzerum, presented a report concerning the Armenian âdomestic enemiesâ, upon which the final decision to exterminate the Armenian population was taken.\n\n** (Taner AkÃ§am, 1996: 43; AkÃ§am, 2004: 166-167; Cemil, 1933: VakÄ±t/Haratch 88; Astourian, 1990: 138-140, No. 116-117, 122-123; and KÃ©vorkian, 2006: 307-308).\n\n1915; March 25: Dr. Mehmed ReÅid, one of the founders of the CUP, is appointed governor of Diyarbekir. *** (Kieser, 2002: 261).\n\n1915; March 28, SÄ±vas: Governor Ahmed Muammer brings in Armenian leaders of SÄ±vas for questioning.

Krikor Zohrab and ZarÃ©h Dilber write a memo to this effect. *** (Zaven Der YÃ©ghiyan, 1947: 95-96).\n\nThe First Phase of the Destruction: Deportations and Massacres (from April to October, 1915)\n\nThe operations were structured in several phases, according to a mode of operation that was largely identical everywhere. In February 1915 (the order given by Minister Enver Pasha was dated February 25), tens of thousands of Armenian conscripts serving in the 3rd Army were disarmed and placed in labor battalions or were directly executed in isolated regions (those who originated from western Anatolia and who served in the Fourth Army based on the Palestine front, were intermittently employed in battle until 1918). After the end of April 1915, the authorities proceeded to arrest Armenian elites in Istanbul along with those in provincial towns. In May, they interned in several waves males from the ages of sixteen to sixty. In the districts most densely populated with Armenians they opted to conscript males between the age of sixteen and nineteen, while those who were forty-one to sixtee years old were released from conscription. In the six eastern provinces, these men were executed in small groups in isolated areas by Special Organization death-squads.\n\nWhen the following stageâthat of the actual deportationsâbegan in May 1915, there were practically no more adult males in the Armenian regions in the east. A region-to-region survey of the process of deportation and elimination demonstrates that the populations in these six eastern provinces, which were considered to be their historical land, were guided above all by the plan to exterminate. The operations aimed at the Armenian colonies in western Anatolia, which were initiated two months later and can be considered as the final act in the program of liquidation. In the east, the plan foresaw the immediate extermination of men, conscripts or not, or their use as a labor force, as opposed to the regions of the west where men were deported along with their families. As for the rest of the populationâwomen, children, and the elderlyâone can also discern differences in their treatment. The convoys from the eastern provinces were methodically destroyed as they traversed their route and a small minority of them actually arrived in their âplace of banishmentâ. One observes, on the other hand, that the Armenian colonies from western Anatolia or Thrace were expedited to Syria as whole families, often by train, and arrived at their deportation destinations with few losses.\n\nAmong the numerous slaughter-sites run by the Special Organization, the two most important ones were located in gorgesâthose of Kemah, to the south-west of Erzincan on the Euphrates, where tens of thousands of men were exterminated in May and June 1915 under the direct supervision of Dr. Bahaeddin Åakir, Head of the S.O.; and those of Kahta, in the mountains to the south of Malatya, through which 500,000 deportees passed.\n\n1915; Night of April 24 to 25, Istanbul: Several hundred individualsâDashnak political militants, Hentchakists, and Ramgavar, journalists, writers, lawyers, medical doctors, high-school principals, teachers, clerics, and merchantsâare arrested by the General Security services and the political police in the Ottoman Capital. *** (KÃ©vorkian, 2006: 317-318).\n\n1915; April 24 and 25, Erzerum: Two hundred locals are arrested and interned. On April 26, thirty of them are âtransferredâ to Erzincan, but executed en route. *** (Agouni, 1921: 139; Kaiser, 2002: 133-134; and KÃ©vorkian, 2006: 356).\n\n1915; April 26: Members of the Armenian elite in Istanbul are transferred under police escort to the HaydarpaÅa Station on the Asian side of the Capital, and then sent by train to Ankara.
