        "text": "THEY WANT OUR WOMEN\n\nWhat a Concept!!\n\nTHERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING UP IN SCIENCE.\n\nScientists spot two rogue planets in the outer solar system, heading toward Earth. The planets are going to enter our orbit. One planet is earth like and the other is a massive giant. The giant will hit and destroy our moon and eight months later hit and destroy Earth. At first the general public does not believe it, but they will soon find out.\n\nGIVE ME 5 CENTS FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.\n\nWritten in the early thirties this is very dated. It is also written in that style. The first couple of chapters are like, Hey we know something really important, but let's build up the suspense first, then we will tell you and not until then. Their are like two parts of the book. The science part I love, which is rogue planets, frozen atmospheres, apocalyptic events, etc...\n\nThe Other Part\n\nWhat was annoying was the main character Tony. He is a big cry baby and super melodramatic. He whines to his girlfriend constantly. His girlfriend of three years, who gives him a kiss once a year at Christmas. He is way into her, but she don't seem to be too much in to him. At one point he is upset cause their are more men then women going to colonize another planet and he may have to share her. He is very upset about that. Later they have a battle and several men die and now there are more women then men and he may have to procreate with several women. That is alright by him.\n\nI gave the story three stars because of the melodrama, but the concept of the story makes it worth listening to. I also want to listen to After Worlds Collide, when they explore the new planet.\n\nWill read again\n\nWould you consider the audio edition of When Worlds Collide to be better than the print version?\n\nNever read the printed version so I wouldn't know which is better. Audiobook is more convenient though.\n\nWho was your favorite character and why?\n\nAll the characters play a part in the story to make it a great book\n\nWhich scene was your favorite?\n\nDefinatly leaving the earth it's so suspenseful to see if they make it and how they do it\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nLaugh a few times but not cry\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nWill read this again, I know it's a older book but the story still strikes a good read and a revisit\n\nDated but Enjoyable\n\nI found this an enjoyable listen over all, however the writing style is quaint, highly embellished and somewhat stilted to 21st century ears. In fact, I can't believe people actually spoke like that in the 30's. The narrator does an excellent job of interpreting it, reflecting the formal tone but embellishing with good characterisation. The formality of the narrator's tone took some getting used to it, but once I realised it reflected the writing style, I appreciated it far more.\n\nThe science is quite outdated - pre-space travel and pre-nuclear trying to imagine both. It must have been thrilling when it was written and while even to layman's ears is obviously wrong, it doesn't detract from the story and the search for a suitable casement for the nuclear reactor adds to the tension. A novel set in the 21st century would be very different, but probably wouldn't have the same drama as technology would be at hand to overcome many of the obstacles. The 1930's, however, provides a far more challenging and thus interesting setting.\n\nI'm looking forward to the sequel.\n\nHolds up so well after four score years\n\nI have to admit I was not aware this was written in 1932/33 when I started reading. It was only a couple hours in that some clues prompted me to find out. My point being that the work holds up very well after all this time. That it was penned before even the first dalliances of mans ascent to the heavens lends more admiration.\n\nI hope that one day this book is made into a modern big blockbuster Hollywood spectacular. One that would far outshine 2012 and it's razor thin premise. The events portrayed in When Worlds Collide are as utterly plausible and real today, as they were in 1932.\n\nThe narration was excellent. I always enjoy Peter Ganim's performances.\n\nWhen Worlds Collide\n\nIf you could sum up When Worlds Collide in three words, what would they be?\n\n1.When 2.Worlds 3.Collide\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of When Worlds Collide?\n\nWhen the French spaceship [SPOILER]!\n\nWhat three words best describe Peter Ganim’s voice?\n\nDramatically Overly Dramatic\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nI didn't have any extreme reactions to it.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nThis almost eighty-five year old book is somewhat of a struggle at first because it reads like a script for an old radio program or one of those pre-television newsreels. So yes, it is dated, but once the excitement kicks in, this is a real apocalyptic joyride strong enough to remain a classic to this day.\n\nI would LOVE to see more Philip Wylie on Audible! I would love an audiobook of Generation of Vipers or his many other essays."
