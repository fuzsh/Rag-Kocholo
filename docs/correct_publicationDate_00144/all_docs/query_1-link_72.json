        "text": "Sam Moskowitz, prominent old-time fan and historian of science fiction, wrote an essay on Philip Wylie in his Studies in Science Fiction series. Titled \"Philip Wylie: The Saccharine Cynic\", it was originally published in Fantastic Science Fiction Stories, September 1960, available at the Internet Archive; it was reprinted (without the subtitle) in Science Fantasy, October 1961, also available at the Internet Archive.\n\nAccording to Moskowitz, Wylie considered himself a stickler for scientific accuracy (his collaborator Edwin Balmer not so much), and consulted some unnamed friends at Caltech about the physics of When Worlds Collide.\n\nA bug on astronomy, Balmer had roughed out a sequence of events for a novel where two planets enter our solar system from outer space. One will strike the earth with resultant mutual destruction. The only chance man has for survival is to build space ships and transfer a few thousand men and women to the second invading world — which will take up an orbit around the sun — before it moves out of range. He presented this idea to Wylie and found a kindred spirit. Like a child with a new toy, Philip Wylie assembled his physicist friends at Cal Tech and mathematically mapped out the scientific elements by which this feat of [spacial] leap frog could be accomplished. The time lost in the advancement of atomics was unquestionably science fiction's gain.\n\nThe collaboration, written as These Shall Not Die, was retitled When Worlds Collide by Donald Kennicott and opened in the September, 1932 issue of BLUE BOOK.\n\n[. . . .]\n\nThere seemed no question that a third book in the series, solving the riddle of the new planet's missing inhabitants was the next logical step, and indeed a plot was outlined by Balmer but vetoed by Wylie. Every word of When Worlds Collide had been written by Wylie and it had been published as written. Similarly, Wylie wrote all of the text of the sequel, but before press time Balmer made some alterations that affected scientific plausibility. Wylie, a purist at science fiction nurtured in the tradition of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback, was disturbed by these changes. Balmer's plot outline of the third book would have been difficult to validate on the basis of known facts. Wylie contended that the success of the first two volumes was predicated, to a large extent, upon the high degree of respect shown for scientific accuracy. Therefore, though he continued to collaborate with Balmer on adventure and detective novels, he refused to give literary substance to the projected third in the When Worlds Collide series.\n\nActually, they both get the collision itself completely wrong. Let me elaborate.\n\nIn the novel, Wylie and Balmer describe the collision of Earth and Bronson Alpha as \"decillions of tons of mass colliding in cosmic catastrophe\". A little later, they describe shattered fragments of the Earth assuming stable orbits of their own around the Sun. First of all, real planets simply do not behave in this fashion when they come within several million miles of each other, let alone on a collision course. And if it's the latter, they certainly do not still retain their original solid, pre-collision, shape.\n\nHow do I know this? Two simple words: tidal forces! Any celestial body the size of the Earth, if acted upon by the enormous gravity of another celestial body the size of Bronson Alpha, would immediately start to distend itself grotesquely in the direction of the approaching other body until it assumed an egg-shape with the pointy end in the direction of the other body. And vice versa ala Alpha. It, too, would immediately distend itself towards Earth and assume an egg-shape of its own.\n\nSo what you would have would be two giant egg-shaped planetary bodies being slowly ripped apart by unbelievably powerful tidal forces long before they ever got within even one moon orbit's distance from each other, let alone physically colliding like two intact cosmic billiard balls in space, like in the novel. Celestial physics simply will not permit this.\n\nWhich further means that no one will ever be able to save themselves from such an imminent catastrophe in time to be decisive. The entire world would have been ripped to pieces without actually colliding with the other planet at all. Worse, the Earth would have already completely melted, perhaps even been vaporized, by said tidal forces, before even being ripped apart, because of latent heat. And obviously, the other body would not be immune to these effects either.\n\nIn the end, our precious Earth (and Alpha) would be reduced by the combined effect of the two planets' tidal forces upon each other to a vast cloud of floating rock vapor in space which could conceivably re-coalesce into a brand new planet twice the size of the original Earth, given enough time. But, of course, no one would be around anymore to take advantage of this!\n\nJust thought I'd point out this little, not-so-nit-picky, detail to anyone reading this site because it's something that's always bothered me about the novel. The end of the world, if it ever does happen, won't be anywhere near as neat and orderly as Wylie and Balmer imagined. It'll actually be way, way worse! And unlike the famous REM song, we will most definitely not be feeling fine!\n\nOther than that, I actually really loved the book and consider it, sans collision, to be perhaps the single greatest sci-fi book ever written anywhere by anyone."
