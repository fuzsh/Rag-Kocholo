        "text": "A runaway planet hurtles toward the earth. As it draws near, massive tidal waves, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions wrack our planet, devastating continents, drowning cities, and wiping out millions. In central North America, a team of scientists race to build a spacecraft powerful enough to escape the doomed earth. Their greatest threat, they soon discover, comes not from the skies but from other humans. A crackling plot and sizzling, cataclysmic vision have made When Worlds Collide one of the most popular and influential end-of-the-world novels of all time. This Bison Frontiers of Imagination edition features the original story and its sequel, After Worlds Collide. Philip Wylie (1902-71) wrote several classic works of speculative fiction, including Gladiator and The Disappearance, as well as a popular work of nonfiction, A Generation of Vipers. Edwin Balmer (1883-1959), an engineer, was also a writer of detective stories and speculative fiction. Introducer John Varley is an acclaimed science fiction writer and a winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards. His books include Wizard, Demon, and Steel Beach.\n\nAuthor: Philip Wylie, Edwin Balmer\n\nPublisher: Bison\n\nPublished: 10/01/1999\n\nPages: 379\n\nBinding Type: Paperback\n\nWeight: 0.92lbs\n\nSize: 7.99h x 5.35w x 0.85d\n\nISBN13: 9780803298149\n\nISBN10: 0803298145\n\nBISAC Categories:\n\n- Fiction | Science Fiction | General"
