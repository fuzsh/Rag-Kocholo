Inevitably, Terra would die and with it most of the world's population. For a handful there was hope: the Earth's scientists laboured to prepare space craft before the cataclysm, atomic arks that would carry a chosen few to a new world. But the few would be selected for the talents they would bring with them and to win a new home planet they would have to forsake the people they loved on doomed Earth"
