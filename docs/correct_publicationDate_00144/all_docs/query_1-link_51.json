It was first published as a six-part serial between September 1932 and February 1933 in the \"King of the Pulps\", the magazine Blue Book.\n\nIn South Africa, astronomer Sven Bronson discovers a pair of rogue planets speeding towards the solar system from the depths of interstellar space. The smaller Bronson Beta will enter a stable orbit around the Sun, but the gas giant Bronson Alpha will cause apocalyptic damage to the Earth through its gravitational influence, swing around the Sun, and finish off ol' Terra by smashing into it on its way out. It looks like humanity is doomed. But if \"The League of the Last Days\" can cross the gulf of space between Earth and Bronson Beta, some small fraction of the human race might just survive...\n\n…and naturally, they do, since the sequel, After Worlds Collide, was also serialized between November 1933 and April 1934.\n\nIn 1951 producer George Pal followed up Destination Moon with an adaptation.\n\nThere was also a syndicated newspaper comic strip, Speed Spaulding, that loosely followed the plot of the first novel; it ran from January 1940 to March 1941.\n\nThe first novel included the following tropes:\n\nApocalypse How: Bronson Alpha's first approach causes planetary societal collapse through massive tidal waves, earthquakes and volcanic activity. It wipes out the planet entirely on its second pass.\n\nAmerica Saves the Day: Zig-zagged. The US government does a magnificent job of moving people and resources away from the vulnerable coasts; unfortunately, the devastation from Bronson Alpha's first pass is so comprehensive that the President can only radio his good wishes to the League from his devastated Midwestern redoubt, and wait for the second pass to finish off the planet.\n\nDisaster Scavengers: People are picking through abandoned New York City even as the streets flood due to Bronson Alpha's tidal effects.\n\nDying Like Animals: Most Americans are Sheep and follow the government's sensible (but wholly inadequate) plans. The looters who try to strip New York City while the streets are beginning to flood qualify as (very dumb) Vultures. The army of survivors that attacks the Ark are a dangerous mix of Wolves and Vultures.\n\nFighting for Survival: Being composed mostly of scientists and engineers, the League is Owl and Beaver-heavy.\n\nFrench Jerk: Professor Duquesne, although maybe that's the type of person you need to be to decide you own countrymen's efforts are doomed to failure and cross the Atlantic and half a continent in order to arrive at the Ark thirty minutes before it launches.\n\nHope Spot: As the first Ark views the impending collision of Earth with Bronson Alpha, they briefly think it may only suffer a glancing blow and survive. They quickly learn that when you're talking planets, a glancing blow is quant. suff.\n\nI Love Nuclear Power\n\nLove Triangle: Between Dave Randsell, Tony Drake, and Eve Hendron.\n\nNext Sunday A.D.: The story takes place \"in the middle third of the twentieth century\", which would qualify for a book written in 1932.\n\nNo Plans, No Prototype, No Backup: Averted; the League of the Last Days launches several test vehicles to try out their atomic engines, and when they complete the first Ark early, they immediately start work on a second, larger one for the rest of the construction team. In addition, other countries are building their own ships.\n\nPhlebotinum Breakdown: Without the Unobtanium available to the US team, the atomic engines of the French Ark melt down in mid-flight and it crashes back to Earth.\n\nThe Ark: Five of them - two American, one British, one {failed) French, and one Japanese/Russian/German cooperative effort.\n\n2-D Space: Semi-averted; the Bronson bodies approach the solar system from below the ecliptic. However, when Bronson Beta settles into its new orbit, it seems to be in more-or-less the same plane as the rest of the planets.\n\nUnobtainium: The massive tectonic disruptions from Bronson's first pass force a seam of exotic metal from the deep mantle all the way to the surface; it just happens to be exactly what the League needs to line the Ark's engine tubes.\n\nWeaponized Exhaust: When a crazed army of survivors attacks the Ark construction site, things look bleak until Randsell starts up the almost-complete first Ark, sets the engine to \"1 G\", and floats over the attacking hordes in blowtorch mode.\n\nWeird Moon: The Moon's orbit is severely altered by Bronson Alpha before it is ultimately destroyed.\n\nThe second novel included the following tropes:"
