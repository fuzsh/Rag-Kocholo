        "text": "Philip Wylie & Edwin Balmer -- When Worlds Collide\n\nChapter 1--The Amazing Errand THE secret itself was still safe. It was clear that the public not yet could have learned it. No; the nature of the tremendous and terrific Discovery remained locked in the breasts of the men who had made it. No one had broken so badly under the burden of it that he had let slip any actual details of what had been learned. But the fact that there was a secret, of incomparable importance, was out. David Ransdell received plenty of proof of it, as he stood at the liner's rail, and the radiograms from shore were brought to him. He had had seven, all of the same sort, within the hour; and here was another. He held it without opening it while he gazed across the sparkling water at the nearing shores of Long Island beyond which lay New York. Strange that, in a city which he could not yet see, men could be so excited about his errand, while the fellow-passengers, at his elbow, glanced at him with only mild curiosity at the sudden frequency of radiograms for him. They would be far less indifferent, if they had read them. The first, arriving less than an hour ago, offered him one thousand dollars for first and exclusive information--to be withheld from all others for twelve hours--of what he carried in his black box. It was signed by the most famous newspaper in New York. Hardly had the messenger started back to the radio station when a second boy appeared with a message from another newspaper: \"Two thousand dollars for first information of your business in New York.\" Within ten minutes the offer had jumped to five thousand dollars, made by another paper. Plainly, the knowledge that there was a secret of utmost importance had spread swiftly! The offer remained at five thousand for twenty minutes; indeed, it dipped once to twenty-five hundred dollars as some timid soul, on a more economical newspaper, ventured to put in his bid; but quickly it jumped again and doubled. It was ten thousand dollars, in the last radiogram which Dave had opened. Ten thousand dollars cash for first information, which now needed to be withheld from others only for six hours, regarding what he was bringing to New York. The thrilling and all-absorbing fact of it was that David Ransdell himself did not know what he carried which could become of such amazing concern. He was merely the courier who transported and guarded the secret. He could look in his box, of course; he possessed the key. But he had the key, as also he had custody of the heavy black box, because those who had entrusted it to him knew that he would never violate his word. Least of all, would he sell out to others. Moreover (if curiosity tried him beyond his strength) he had Professor Bronson's word for it that the contents of the box would be utterly meaningless to him. Only a few men, with very special training, could make out the meaning. Cole Hendron in New York--Dr. Cole Hendron, the physicist--could make it out. Indeed, he could determine it more completely than any other man alive. That was why Dave Ransdell, from South Africa, was bound for New York; he was bringing the box to Cole Hendron, who, after he had satisfied himself of the significance of its contents, would take the courier into his confidence. Dave gripped the rail with his aggravated impatience for arrival in the city. He wondered, but with secondary interest only, under the circumstances, what it would be like in America. It was the\n\nnative land of his mother; but David had never so much as seen its shores before. For he was a South African-his father an Englishman who had once ranched in Montana, had married a Montana girl and had taken her to the Transvaal. Dave had been born at Pretoria, schooled there, and had run away from school to go to war. The war had made him a flyer. He had stayed in the air afterward, and he was flying the mails when, suddenly, at the request of Capetown,--and he did not yet know from how high an official source,--he had been granted a special leave to fly a certain shipment of scientific material to America. That is, he was instructed to fly it not only the length of his ordinary route, but to continue with it the length of Africa and across to France, where he was to make connection with the first and fastest ship for New York. Of course, the commission intrigued him. He had been summoned at night to the great mansion of Lord Rhondin, near Capetown. Lord Rhondin himself, a big, calm, practical-minded man, received him; and with Lord Rhondin was a tall, wiry man of forty-odd, with a quick and nervous manner. \"Professor Bronson,\" Lord Rhondin said, introducing Ransdell. \"The astronomer?\" Dave asked as they shook hands. \"Exactly,\" said Lord Rhondin. Bronson did not speak at all then, or for several minutes. He merely grasped Dave's hand with nervous tightness and stared at him while he was thinking, patently, of something else--something, Dave guessed, which recently had allowed him too little sleep. \"Sit down,\" Lord Rhondin bade; and the three of them seated themselves; but no one spoke. They were in a big, secluded room given to trophies of the hunt. Animal skins covered the floor; and lion and buffalo and elephant heads looked down from the walls, their glass eyes glinting in the light which was reflected, also, by festoons of shining knives and spears. \"We sent for you, Ransdell,\" said Lord Rhondin, \"because a very strange discovery has been made--a discovery which, if confirmed in all details, is of incomparable consequence. Nothing conceivable can be of greater importance. I tell you that at the outset, Ransdell, because I must refrain for the present from telling you anything else about it.\" Dave felt his skin prickling with a strange, excited awe. There was no doubt that this man--Lord Rhondin, industrialist, financier and conspicuous patron of science--thoroughly believed what he said; behind the eyes which looked at David Ransdell was awe at knowledge which he dared not reveal. But Dave asked boldly: \"Why?\" \"Why can't I tell you?\" Lord Rhondin repeated, and looked at Bronson. Professor Bronson nervously jumped up. He stared at Lord Rhondin and then at Ransdell, and looked up from him at a lion's head. \"Strange to think of no more lions!\" Bronson finally muttered. The words seemed to escape him involuntarily. Lord Rhondin made no remark at this apparent irrelevance. Ransdell, inwardly more excited by this queerly oppressive silence, at last demanded: \"Why will there be no more lions?\" \"Why not tell him?\" Bronson asked. But Rhondin went abruptly to business: \"We asked leave for you, Ransdell, because I have heard that you are a particularly reliable man. It is essential that material connected with the discovery be delivered in New York City at the earliest practicable moment. You are both an expert pilot who can make the best speed, and you are dependable. If you will take it, I will put the material in your care; and-can you start to-night?\"\n\n\"Yes sir. But--what sort of material, I must ask, if I am to fly with it?\" \"Chiefly glass.\" \"Glass?\" Dave repeated. \"Yes--photographic plates.\" \"Oh. How many of them?\" Lord Rhondin threw back a leopard-skin which had covered a large black traveling-case. \"They are packed, carefully, in this. I will tell you this much more, which you may guess, from Professor Bronson's presence. They are photographic plates taken by the greatest telescopes in South Africa, of regions of the southern sky which are never visible in the Northern Hemisphere. You are to take them to Dr. Cole Hendron in New York City, and deliver them personally to him and to no one else. I would tell you more about this unusual errand, Ransdell, if the--the implications of these plates were absolutely certain.\" At this, Professor Bronson started, but again checked himself before speaking; and Lord Rhondin went on: \"The implications, I may say, are probably true; but so very much is involved that it would be most disastrous if even a rumor of what we believe we have discovered, were given out. For that reason, among others, we cannot confide it even to you; but we must charge you personally to convey this box to Dr. Hendron, who is the scientific consultant of the Universal Electric and Power Corporation in New York City. He is now in Pasadena, but will be in New York upon your arrival. Time is vital--the greatest speed, that is, consistent with reasonable safety. We are asking you, therefore, to fly the length of Africa along the established routes, with which you are familiar, and to fly, then, across the Mediterranean to France, where you will board a fast liner. You should reach Dr. Hendron not later than a week from Monday. You may return, then, if you wish. On the other hand\"--he paused as crowded considerations heaped in his mind,--\"you may be indifferent as to where you are.\" \"On the earth,\" added Professor Bronson. \"Of course--on the earth,\" Lord Rhondin accepted. \"I would go myself, Ransdell, you understand,\" Bronson then proceeded. \"But my place, for the present, certainly is here. I mean, of course, at the observatory. . . . It is possible, Ransdell, in spite of precautions which have been taken, that some word of the Bronson discovery may get out. Your errand may be suspected. If it is, you know nothing--nothing you understand? You must answer no inquiry from any source. None--none whatever!\" At the landings during the fast flight north along the length of Africa, and in France, and during the first four days aboard the transatlantic vessel, nothing had happened to recall these emphatic cautions; but now, something was out. A boy was approaching with another radiogram; and so Ransdell swiftly tore open the one he had been holding: \"Twenty thousand dollars in cash paid to you if you grant first and exclusive interview regarding the Bronson discovery to this paper.\" It was signed by the man, who, an hour ago, had opened the bidding with one thousand dollars. Dave crumpled it and tossed it overboard. If the man who had sent it had been in that trophyroom with Bronson and Lord Rhondin, he would have realized that the matter on their minds completely transcended any monetary consideration. The evening in New York was warm. It pressed back the confused uproar of the street; and the sound which ascended to the high terrace of the Hendron apartment seemed to contain heat as well as noise. Eve found that her search for a breath of fresh air was fruitless. For a moment she gazed into the mist and monotone that was Manhattan, and then stared over the city toward the channels to the sea. \"Suppose those lights are the ship's?\" she asked Tony.\n\n\"It left quarantine before seven; it's somewhere there,\" Tony said patiently. \"Let's not go back in.\" His cigarette-case clicked open. The light of his match made a brief Rubens: buff satin of her bare shoulders, green of her evening dress, stark white of his shirt-bosom, and heads bent together. Some one inside the apartment danced past the French windows, touched the door-handle, perceived that the terrace was occupied, and danced away to the accompaniment of music that came from the radio. \"Guests take possession these days,\" Eve continued. \"If you suggest bridge, they tear up the rugs and dance. If I'd asked them to dance,--and had an orchestra,--they'd have played bridge--or made fudge-\" \"Or played District Attorney. Why have guests at all, Eve? Especially to-night?\" \"Sorry, Tony.\" \"Are you, really? Then why did you have them, when for the first night in weeks the three thousand miles of this dreary continent aren't between us?\" \"I didn't have them, Tony. They just heard we were home; and they came.\" \"You could have had a headache--for them.\" \"I almost did, with the reporters this afternoon. This is really a rest; let's enjoy it, Tony.\" She leaned against the balustrade and looked down at the lights; and he, desirous of much more, bent jealously beside her. Inside the apartment, the dancing continued, making itself sensible as a procession of silhouettes that passed the window. Tony laid his hand possessively on Eve's. She turned her hand, lessening subtly the possessiveness of his, and said: \"You can kiss me. I like to be kissed. But don't propose.\" \"Why not?. . . See here, Eve, I'm through with Christmas kisses with you.\" \"Christmas kisses?\" \"You know what I mean. I've been kissing you, Christmases, for three years; and what's it got me?\" \"Cad!\" He put his hand on her shoulder, and turned her away from the panorama of the city. \"Is there some real trouble, Eve?\" he inquired gently. \"Trouble?\" \"I mean that's on your mind, and that stops making tonight what it might be for us.\" \"No; there's no trouble, Tony.\" \"Then there's somebody else ahead of me--is there? Somebody perhaps in Pasadena?\" \"Nobody in Pasadena--or anywhere else, Tony.\" \"Then what is it, to-night? What's changed you?\" \"How am I changed?\" \"You drive me mad, Eve; you know it. You're lovely in face, and beautiful in body; and besides, with a brain that your father's trained so that you're beyond any other girl--and most men too. You're way beyond me, but I love you; and you don't listen to me.\" \"I do!\" \"You're not listening to me even now. You're thinking instead.\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"Feel!\" \"Oh, I can do that, too.\" \"I know; then why don't you--and stop thinking?\" \"Wait! Not now, Tony. . . . Do you suppose that's the ship?\"\n\n\"Why do you care? See here, Eve, is there anything in that newspaper story your father and you have been denying all afternoon?\" \"What story?\" \"That something unusual is up between all the big scientific leaders.\" \"There's always something up in science,\" Eve evaded. . . . The doors were flung wide open. Music blared from the radio. In the drawing-room a half-dozen people continued to dance. Another group surrounded the punch-bowl. The butler was passing a tray of sandwiches. Some one stepped out and asked Eve to dance, and she went in with him. Tony wandered in from the terrace. The butler stopped before him. \"Sandwich, Mr. Drake?\" \"Keep three of the tongue for me, Leighton,\" Tony said solemnly. \"I want to take them home to eat in bed.\" The butler nodded indulgently. \"Certainly, Mr. Drake. Anything else?\" \"Possibly an anchovy.\" \"Very good, Mr. Drake.\" An arm encircled Tony's broad shoulders. \"Hello, Tony. Say--give me the low-down on what shot the market to hell's basement to-day.\" Tony frowned; his eyes were following Eve. \"Why do you compliment me with thinking I may know?\" \"It's something happened in Africa, I hear. Anyway, the African cables were carrying it. But what could happen down there to shoot hell out of us this way? Another discovery of gold? A mountain of gold that would make gold so cheap it would unsettle everything?\" \"Cheap gold would make stocks dear--not send them down,\" Tony objected. \"Sure; it can't be that. But what could happen in South Africa that--\" Tony returned alone to the terrace. His senses were swept by intimate thoughts of Eve: A perfume called Nuit Douce. Gold lights in her red-brown hair. Dark eyes. The sweep of a forehead behind which, in rare company, a woman's instincts and tenderness dwelt with a mind ordinarily as honest and unevasive as a man's. All the tremendous insignificances that have meaning to a man possessed by the woman he loves. He stood spellbound, staring through the night. . . . Anthony Drake was an athlete--that would have been the second observation another man would have made of him. The first, that he owned that uncounterfeitable trait which goes with what we call good birth and breeding, and generations of the like before him. With this he had the physical sureness and the gestures of suppressed power which are the result of training in sports. He had the slender waist of a boxer, with the shoulders of a discus thrower. His clothes always seemed frail in comparison with his physique. He also had intelligence. His university companions considered it a trivial side-issue when he was graduated from Harvard with a magna cum laude; but the conservative investment-house with which he afterward became affiliated appreciated the adjunct of brains to a personality so compelling. His head was large and square, and it required his big physique to give that head proportion. He was blue-eyed, sandy-haired. He possessed a remarkably deep voice. He was entirely normal. His attainments beyond the average were not unusual. He belonged more or less to that type of young American business man upon whom the older generation places its hope and trust. Eve was really a much more remarkable human being--not on account of her beauty, but because of her intellectual brilliance, and her unique training from her father.\n\nYet Eve was not the sort who preferred \"intellectual\" men; intellectualism, as such, immensely bored her. She liked the outright and vigorous and \"normal.\" She liked Tony Drake; and Tony, knowing this, was more than baffled by her attitude to-night. An emotional net seemed to have been stretched between them, through which he could not quite reach her; what the substance of the net was, he could not determine; but it balked him when, as never before, he wanted nearness to her. He believed her when she told him that her tantalizing abstraction was not because of another man. Then, what was its cause? Tony was drawn from his reverie by the appearance of Douglas Balcom, senior partner of his firm. His presence here surprised Tony. No reason why old Balcom should not drop in, if he pleased; but the rest of the guests were much younger. Balcom, halting beside Tony, reflected the general discontent of the day by waving at the city and murmuring: \"In the soup. Everything's in the soup; and now nobody cares. Why does nobody care?\" Tony disagreed, but he deferred to Balcom by saying: \"It seems to me, a lot of people care.\" \"I mean nobody who's in the know cares. I mean the four or five men who know what's going on-underneath. I mean,\" particularized old Balcom, \"John Borgan doesn't care. Did you see him to-day?\" \"Borgan? No.\" \"Did you hear of his buying anything?\" \"No.\" \"Selling anything?\" \"No.\" \"That's it.\" Balcom thought out loud for a while. Tony listened. \"Borgan's the fourth richest man in America; and normally the most active, personally. He'll be the richest, if he keeps up. He wants to be the richest. Oil-mines--rails--steel-shipping--he's in everything. He's only fifty-one. To my way of thinking, he's smarter than anyone else; and this looks like a market--superficially--which was made for Borgan. But for two weeks he's gone dead. Won't do a thing, either way; takes no position. Paralyzed. Why?\" \"He may be resting on his oars.\" \"You know damn' well he isn't. Not Borgan--now. There's only one way I can explain; he knows something damned important that the rest of us don't. There's an undertone--don't you feel it?--that's different. I met Borgan to-day, face to face; we shook hands. I don't like the look of him. I tell you he knows something he's afraid of. He did a funny thing, by the way, Tony. He asked me: 'How well do you know Cole Hendron?\" \"I said, 'Pretty well.' I said: 'Tony Drake knows him damn' well.' He said: 'You tell Hendron, or have Drake tell Hendron, he can trust me.' That's exactly what he said, Tony--tell Hendron that he can trust N. J. Borgan. Now, what the hell is that all about?\" \"I don't know,\" said Tony, and almost added, in his feeling of the moment: \"I don't care.\" For Eve was returning. She slipped away from her partner and signaled to Tony to see her alone. Together they sought the solitude of the end of the terrace. \"Tony, can you start these people home?\" \"Gladly,\" rejoiced Tony. \"But I can stay?\" \"I'm afraid not. I've got to work.\" \"Now? To-night?\" \"As soon as I possibly can. Tony, I'll tell you. The ship is in, and Ransdell was taken off at quarantine and brought here. He's in Father's study now.\" \"Who's Ransdell?\"\n\n\"Nobody I know. I haven't set eyes on him yet, Tony. He's just the messenger from Africa. You see, Tony, some--some things were being sent rush, by airplane and by messenger, to Father from Africa. Well, they've arrived; and I do his measuring for him, you know.\" \"What measuring?\" \"The delicate measuring, like--like the position and amount of movement shown by stars and other bodies on astronomical plates. For weeks--for months, in fact, Tony--the astronomers in the Southern Hemisphere have been watching something.\" \"What sort of a something, Eve?\" \"Something of a sort never seen before, Tony. A sort of body that they knew existed by the millions, probably, all through the universe-something they were sure must be, but the general existence of which has never been actually proved. It--it may be the most sensational fact for us, from the beginning to the end of time. I can't tell you more than that to-night, Tony; yet by to-morrow we may be telling it to all the world. Rumors are getting out; and so some scientist, who will be believed, must make an authoritative announcement. And the scientists of the world have selected Father to make it. \"Now, help me, Tony. You clear these people out; and then you run along. For I've measurements to make and report to Father; and he has to check over calculations made by the best men in the southern half of the world. Then, by tomorrow, we may know, for certain, what is going to happen to us all.\" Tony had his arm about her; he felt her suddenly trembling. He swept her up and held her against him; and kissing her, he met on her lips, a new, impetuous passion which exalted and amazed him. Then some one came out and he released her. \"I--I didn't mean that, Tony,\" she whispered. \"You must have.\" \"I didn't! Not all of it, Tony. It was just for that moment.\" \"We'll have a thousand more like it--thousands--thousands!\" They both were whispering; and now, though he had let her go, his hand was over hers, and he could feel her quivering again. \"You don't know, Tony. Nobody really knows yet. Come, help me send them all away.\" He helped her; and when the guests had gone, he met, at last, the man who had come from South Africa. They shook hands, and for a few moments the three of them--Eve Hendron and Tony Drake and Ransdell, the mail-flyer from under the Southern Cross-stood and chatted together. There must be presentiments; otherwise, how could the three of them always have carried, thereafter, a photographic memory of that moment of their meeting? Yet no one of the three--and least of all Eve, who on that night knew most of what was to come--could possibly have suspected the strange relation in which each was to stand to the others. None of them could have suspected, because such a relationship was, at that moment, inconceivable to them--a relationship between civilized men and women for which there then existed, indeed, no word in the language.\n\nChapter 2--The League of the Last Days THE lobby of Tony's favorite club was carpeted in red. Beyond the red carpet was a vast room paneled in oak. It usually was filled with leisurely men playing backgammon or bridge or chess, smoking and reading newspapers. Behind it, thick with gloom, was a library; and in a wing on the left, the dining-room where uniformed waiters moved swiftly between rows of small tables.\n\nAs Tony entered the club, however, he felt that it had emerged from its slumbers, its routine, its dull masculine quietude. There were only two games in progress. Few men were idling over their cigars, studying their newspapers; many were gathered around the bar. The lights seemed brighter. Voices were staccato. Men stood in groups and talked; a few even gesticulated. The surface of snobbish solitude had been dissipated. Tony knew at once why the club was alive. The rumors, spreading on the streets, had eddied in through these doors too. Some one hailed him. \"Hi! Tony!\" \"Hello, Jack! What's up?\" \"You tell us!\" \"How could I tell you?\" \"Don't you know Hendron? Haven't you seen him?\" Jack Little--a young man whose name was misleading--stepped away from a cluster of friends, who, however, soon followed him; and Tony found himself surrounded. One of the men had been one of the guests whom Tony, half an hour before, had helped clear from the Hendrons'; and so he could not deny having seen Hendron, even if he had wanted to. \"What in hell have the scientists under their hats, Tony?\" \"I don't know. Honest,\" Tony denied. \"Then what the devil is the League of the Last Days?\" \"What?\" \"The League of the Last Days--an organization of all the leading scientists in the world, as far as I can make out,\" Little informed him. \"Never heard of it,\" said Tony. \"I just did,\" Little confessed; \"but it appears to have been in existence some time. Several months, that is. They began to organize it suddenly, all over the world, in the winter.\" \"All over the world?\" asked Tony. \"In strictest and absolutely the highest scientific circles. They've been organized and communicating for half a year; and it's just leaking out.\" \"The League of the Last Days?\" repeated Tony. \"That's it.\" \"What does it mean?\" \"That's what I thought you might tell us. Hendron's a member, of course.\" \"The head of it, I hear,\" somebody else put in. \"I don't know anything about it,\" Tony protested, and tried to move away. Actually, he did not know; but this talk fitted in too well with what Eve had told him. Her father had been chosen by the scientists of the world to make some extraordinary announcement. But--the League of the Last Days! She had not mentioned that to him. League of the Last Days! It sent a strange tingle under his skin. \"How did you hear about it?\" Tony now demanded of Jack Little. \"From him,\" said Jack, jerking toward the man who had heard that Cole Hendron headed the League. \"I got it this afternoon,\" this fellow said importantly. \"I know the city editor of the Standard. He had a reporter--a smart kid named Davis--on it. I was there when the kid came back. It seems that some months ago, the scientists--the top men like Hendron--stumbled on something big. So big that it seems to have scared them. They've been having meetings about it for months.\n\n\"Nobody thought much about the meetings at first. Scientists are always barging around visiting each other and having conventions. But these were different. Very few men- and all big ones; and no real reports coming out. Only camouflage stuff-like about progress in smashing the atom. But the real business that was exciting them wasn't given out. \"Nobody knows yet what it is; but we do know there is something mighty big and mighty secret. It's so big and so secret that they only refer to it, when writing to each other, by a code. \"That's one thing definitely known. They write to each other and cable to each other about it in a code that's so damned good that the newspapers, which have got hold of some of the messages, can't break the cipher and figure it out.\" \"What's the League of the Last Days got to do with that?\" Tony asked. \"It's the League of the Last Days that's doing it all. It's the League of the Last Days that communicates with its members by the code.\" That was all any one knew; and soon Tony left the circle. He did not want to talk to men who knew even less than himself. He wanted to return to Eve; and that being impossible, he wanted to be alone. \"I need,\" he said to nobody in particular, \"a shower and a drink.\" And he pushed out of the club and started home. His cab lurched through traffic. When the vehicle stopped for a red light, he was roused from his abstractions by the hawking of an extra. He leaned out and bought one from the bawling newsboy. The headline disappointed him. SCIENTISTS FORM SECRET \"LEAGUE OF THE LAST DAYS.\" A second paper--a tabloid--told no more. SENSATIONAL SECRET DISCOVERY World Scientists Communicating in Code. When he reached his apartment, he thrust the papers under his arm. The doorman and the elevator boy spoke to him, and he did not answer. His Jap servant smiled at him. He surrendered his derby, threw himself in a deep chair, had a telephone brought, and called Eve. The telephone-company informed him that service on that number had been discontinued for the night. \"Bring me a highball, Kyto,\" Tony said. \"And hand me that damn' newspaper.\" And Tony read: \"A secret discovery of startling importance is exciting the whole world of science. \"Though denied both by American and foreign scientists, the Standard has come into possession of copies of more than a score of cablegrams in code exchanged between various physicists and astronomers in America, and Professor Ernest Heim of Heidelberg, Germany. \"This newspaper has sought out the American senders or receivers of the mysterious code messages, who include Professor Yerksen Leeming at Yale, Doctor K. Belditz of Columbia, Cole Hendron of the Universal Electric and Power Corp., and Professor Eugene Taylor at Princeton. Some of these scientists at first denied that a secret code communication was being carried on; but others, confronted with copies of messages, admitted it, but claimed that they referred to a purely scientific investigation which was being conducted by several groups in cooperation. They denied that the subjects under investigation were of public importance. \"Challenged to describe, even in general terms, the nature of the secret, each man refused.\n\n\"But matters are coming to a head. To-day it was discovered that a special courier from South Africa, sent by Lord Rhondin and Professor Bronson of Capetown, had flown the length of the Dark Continent with a mysterious black box; at Cherbourg he took the first ship for New York and upon his arrival, was taken off at quarantine and hurried to Cole Hendron's apartment. \"Dr. Cole Hendron, chief consultant of the Universal Electric and Power Corp., only to-day returned to New York from Pasadena, where he has been working with the scientists of the observatory on Mt. Wilson. \"To add to the disturbing and spectacular features of this strange scientific mystery, it is learned that the scientists associated in this secret and yet world-spanning investigation are in a group which is called the League of the Last Days. What this may mean. . . .\" There was nothing more but speculation and wild guesses. Tony tossed aside the newspapers and lay back in his chair; he could speculate for himself. The League of the Last Days! It might, of course, have been manufactured by one of the tabloids itself, and thus spread about the city. But Tony too vividly recollected Eve Hendron. Kyto appeared with his highball; and Tony sipped slowly and thoughtfully. If this which he had just read, and that which he previously had encountered to-day, had meaning, it must be that some amazing and unique menace threatened human society. And it was at a moment when, more than ever before in his life or in his dreams, Tony Drake wanted human society, with him in it--with him and Eve in it--to go on as it was. Or rather, as it would be, if things simply took their natural course. Eve in his arms; her lips on his again, as he had had them to-day! To possess her, to own her completely! He could dream of no human delight beyond her! And he would have her! Damn this League of the Last Days! What were the scientists hiding among themselves? Tony sat up vehemently. \"A hell of a thing,\" he said aloud. \"The whole world is haywire. Haywire! By the way, Kyto, you aren't a Japanese scientist, are you?\" \"How?\" \"Never mind. You don't happen to send code messages to Einstein, do you?\" \"Cold messages?\" \"Let it pass. I'm going to bed. If my mother calls from the country, Kyto, tell her I'm being a good boy and still wearing woolen socks against a cold snap. I must have sleep, to be in shape for work to-morrow. Maybe I'll sell five shares of stock in the morning, or possibly ten. It's wearing me down. I can't stand the strain.\" He drained his glass and arose. Four hours later, after twice again having attempted to phone Eve Hendron, and twice again having been informed that service for the night was discontinued, Tony got to sleep.\n\nChapter 3--The Strangers from Space IT was no tabloid but the Times--the staid, accurate, ultra-responsible New York Times--which spread the sensation before him in the morning. The headlines lay black upon the page: \"SCIENTISTS SAY WORLDS FROM ANOTHER STAR APPROACH THE EARTH\n\ndr. cole hendron makes astonishing statement in which sixty of the greatest physicists and astronomers concur.\" Tony was scarcely awake when Kyto had brought him the paper. Kyto himself, it was plain, had been puzzling over the news, and did not understand it. Kyto, however, had comprehended enough to know that something was very different to-day; so he had carried in the coffee and the newspaper a bit earlier than customary; and he delayed, busying himself with the black, clear coffee, while Tony started up and stared. \"Dr. Cole Hendron, generally acknowledged to be the leading astro-physicist of America,\" Tony read, \"early this morning gave to the press the following statement, on behalf of the sixty scientists named in an accompanying column.\" Tony's eyes flashed to the column which carried the list of distinguished names, English, German, French, Italian, Swiss, American, South African, Australian and Japanese. \"Similar statements are being given to the press of all peoples at this same time. \"'In order to allay alarms likely to rise from the increase of rumors based upon incorrect or misunderstood reports of the discovery made by Professor Bronson, of Capetown, South Africa, and in order to acquaint all people with the actual situation, as it is now viewed, we offer these facts. \"'Eleven months ago, when examining a photographic plate of the region 15 (Eridanus) in the southern skies, Professor Bronson noticed the presence of two bodies then near the star Achernar, which had not been observed before. \"'Both were exceedingly faint, and lying in the constellation Eridanus, which is one of the largest constellations in the sky, they were at first put down as probably long-period variable stars which had recently increased in brightness after having been too faint to affect the photographic plate. \"'A month later, after photographing again the same locality, Professor Bronson looked for the two new stars and found that they had moved. No object of stellar distance could show displacement in so short a space of time. It was certain, therefore, that the newly observed bodies were not stars. They must be previously unobserved and unsuspected members of our solar system, or else objects, from outside our system, now approaching us. \"They must be new planets or comets--or strangers from space. \"'All planets known to be associated with our sun move approximately in the plane described by the earth's orbit. This is true, whatever the size or distance of the planets, from Mercury to Pluto. The two Bronson bodies were moving almost at right angles to the plane of the planetary orbits. \"'Comets appear from all directions; but these two bodies did not resemble comets when viewed through the greater telescope. One of them, at the time of the second observation, showed a small but perceptible disk. Its spectrum exhibited the characteristic lines of reflected sunlight. Meanwhile, several observations of position and movement were made which made it plain that the two Bronson bodies were objects of planetary dimensions and characteristics, approaching us from out of stellar distances-that is, from space. \"The two bodies have remained associated, approaching us together and at the same speed. Both now show disks which can be measured. It can now be estimated that, when first observed, they had approached within the distance from the sun of the planet Neptune. It must be remembered, however, that they lie in an entirely different direction. \"'Since coming under observation, they have moved within the distance of the orbit of our planet Uranus, and are approaching the distance of Saturn. \"'Bronson Alpha--which is the name temporarily assigned to the larger of the two new bodies-appears in the telescope similar in size to Uranus. That is, its estimated diameter is something over forty\n\nthousand miles. Bronson Beta, which is the smaller of the two bodies, has an estimated diameter of eight thousand miles. It is similar in size, therefore, to the earth. \"'Bronson Beta at present is in advance of Alpha in their approach toward the solar system; but they do not move in parallel lines; Beta, which is the smaller, revolves about Alpha so that their positions constantly change. \"'They have both come definitely within the sphere of gravitational influence of the sun; but having arrived from interstellar space, their speeds of approach greatly exceed the velocities of our familiar planets in their orbits around the sun. \"'Such are the observed phenomena. The following is necessarily highly speculative, but it is offered as a possible explanation of the origin of the two Bronson bodies. \"'It has long been supposed that about other stars than ours--for of course our sun is only a star-are other planets like the earth and Mars and Jupiter. It is not presumed that all stars are surrounded by planets; but it has been estimated that probably at least one star in one hundred thousand has developed a planetary system. Among the many billions of stars, there are probably millions of suns with planets. It is always possible that some catastrophe would tear the planets away. It would require nothing more than the approach of another star toward the sun to destroy the gravitational control of the sun over the earth and Venus and Mars and Jupiter and other planets, and to send them all spinning into space on cold and dark careers of their own. \"This world of ours, and Venus and Mars and Jupiter and Saturn, would then wander throughout indefinite ages--some of them perhaps eternally doomed to cold and darkness; others might, after incalculable ages, find another sun. \"'It might be assumed, for purposes of explanation of the Bronson Bodies, that they once were planets like our earth and Uranus, circling about some life-giving sun. A catastrophe tore them away, together with whatever other of her planets there might have been, and sent them into the darkness of interstellar space. These two--Bronson Alpha and Bronson Beta--either were associated originally, or else established a gravitational influence upon each other in the journey through space, and probably have traveled together through an incalculable time until they arrived in a region of the heavens which brought them at last under the attraction of the sun. Their previous course, consequently, has been greatly modified by the sun, and as a result, they are now approaching us.'\" At this point, the prepared statement of Cole Hendron terminated. Tony Drake was sitting up straight in bed, holding the paper before him and trying, with his left hand and without looking away, to strike a match for the cigarette between his lips. He did not succeed, but he kept on trying while his eyes searched down the column of questions put by the reporters to Dr. Hendron-and his answers. \"'What will be the effect of this approach upon the earth?' \"'It is impossible yet to tell.' \"'But there will be effects?' \"'Certainly there will be effects.' \"'How serious?' Again Cole Hendron refused to answer. \"'It is impossible yet to say.' \"'Will the earth be endangered?' \"Answer: 'There will undoubtedly be considerable alterations of conditions of life here.' \"What sort of alterations?' \"'That will be the subject of a later statement,' Dr. Hendron replied. 'The character and degree of the disturbance which we are to undergo is now the subject of study by a responsible group. We will\n\nattempt to describe the conditions likely to confront all of us on the world as soon as they clearly define themselves.' \"'When will this supplementary statement be made?' \"'As soon as possible.' \"'To-morrow?' \"'No; by no means as soon as to-morrow.' \" Within a week? Within a month?' \"'I would say that it might be made within a month.' Tony was on his feet, and in spite of himself, trembling. There was no possible mistaking of the undertone of this astonishing announcement. It spelled doom, or some enormous alteration of all conditions of life on the world equivalent to complete disaster. The League of the Last Days! There was some reference to it in another column, but Tony scarcely caught its coherence. Where was Eve; and what, upon this morning, was she doing? How was she feeling? What was she thinking? Might she, at last, be sleeping? She had been up all night, and at work assisting her father. The statement had been released at one o'clock in the morning. There was no mention in the paper of her presence with her father; Cole Hendron apparently had received the reporters alone. How much more than this which had been told, did Eve now know? Plainly, manifestly the scientists knew more--much, much more, which they dared not yet tell the public. Dared not! That was the fact. They dared, to-day, only to issue the preliminary announcement.\n\nChapter 4--Dawn after Doomsday? KYTO, who usually effaced himself, did not do so this morning. Kyto, having the untasted coffee for an excuse, called attention to himself and ventured: \"Mister, of course, comprehends the news?\" \"Yes, Kyto; I understand it--partly, at any rate.\" \"I may inquire, please, perhaps the significance?\" Tony stared at the little Jap. He had always liked him; but suddenly he was assailed with a surge of fellow-feeling for this small brown man trapped like himself on the rim of the world. Trapped! That was it. Trapped was the word for this strange feeling. \"Kyto, we're in for something.\" \"What?\" \"Something rather--extensive, Kyto. One thing is sure, we're all in for it together.\" \"General-destruction?\" Kyto asked. Tony shook his head, and his reply surprised himself. \"No; if it were just that, they'd say it. It would be easy to say--general destruction, the end of everything. People after all in a way are prepared for that, Kyto.\" Tony was reasoning to himself as much as talking to Kyto. \"No; this can't be just-destruction. It doesn't feel like it, Kyto.\" \"What else could it be?\" questioned the Jap practically. Tony, having no answer, gulped his coffee; and Kyto had to attend to the telephone, which was ringing. It was Balcom.\n\n\"Hey! Tony! Tony, have you seen the paper? I told you Hendron had something, but I admit this runs considerably beyond expectations. . . . Staggers one, doesn't it, Tony? . . . Now, see here, it's perfectly plain that Hendron knows much more than he's giving out. . . . Tony, he probably knows it all now! . . . I want you to get to him as soon as you can.\" As soon as possible, Tony got rid of Balcom--another rider on the rim of the world, trapped with Tony and Kyto and all the rest of these people who could be heard, if you went to the open window, ringing one another to talk over this consternation. Tony commanded, from before the bathroom mirror, where he was hastily shaving: \"Kyto, make sure that anybody else that calls up isn't Miss Hendron, and then say I'm out.\" Within five minutes Kyto was telling the truth. Tony, in less than five more, was at the Hendrons'. The place was policed. Men, women and children from Park Avenue, from Third and Second avenues crowded the sidewalks; sound-film trucks and photographers obstructed the street. Radio people and reporters, refused admittance, picked up what they could from the throng. Tony, at last, made contact with a police officer, and he did not make the mistake of asserting his right to pass the police-lines or of claiming, too publicly, that he was a personal friend of the family. \"There is a possibility that Dr. Hendron or perhaps Miss Hendron might have left word that I might see them,\" Tony said. \"My name is Tony Drake.\" The officer escorted him in. The elevator lifted him high to the penthouse on the roof, where the street noises were vague and far away, where the sun was shining, and blossoms, in their boxes, were red and yellow and blue. No one was about but the servants. Impassive people! Did they know and understand? Or were they dulled to it? Miss Eve, they said, was in the breakfast-room; Dr. Hendron still was asleep. \"Hello, Tony! Come in!\" Eve rose from the pretty little green table in the gay chintz-curtained nook which they called the breakfast-room. Her eyes were bright, her face flushed the slightest bit with her excitement. Her hands grasped his tightly. Lovely hands, she had, slender and soft and strong. How gentle she was to hold, but also how strong! Longing for her leaped in Tony. Damn everything else! He pulled her within his arms and kissed her; and her lips, as they had last night, clung to his. They both drew breath, deeply, as they parted-stared into each other's eyes. Their hands held to each other a moment more; then Tony stepped back. She had dressed but for her frock itself; she was in negligée, with her slim lovely arms in loose lace-decked silk, her white neck and bosom half exposed. He bent and kissed her neck. \"You've breakfasted, Tony?\" \"Yes--no. Can I sit with you here? I scarcely dreamed you'd be up, Eve, after your night.\" \"You've seen the papers? We were through with them before three. That is, Father then absolutely refused to say any more or see any one else. He went to sleep.\" \"You didn't.\" \"No; I kept thinking--thinking--\" \"Of the end of everything, Eve?\" \"Part of the time, I did; of course I did; but more of the time of you.\" \"Of me--last night?\"\n\n\"I hoped you'd come first thing to-day. I thought you would. . . . It's funny what difference the formal announcement of it makes. I knew it all last night, Tony. I've known the general truth of it for weeks. But when it was a secret thing--something shared just with my father and his friends--it wasn't the same as now. One knew it but still didn't admit it, even to one's self. It was theoretical--in one's head, like a dream, not reality. We didn't really do much, Father and I, last night. I mean do much in proving up the facts and figures. Father had them all before from other men. Professor Bronson's plates and calculations simply confirmed what really was certain; Father checked them over. Then we gave it out. \"That's what's made everything so changed.\" \"Yet you didn't give out everything you know, Eve.\" \"No, not everything, Tony.\" \"You know exactly what's going to happen, don't you, Eve?\" \"Yes. We know--we think we know, that is, exactly what's going to happen.\" \"It's going to be doomsday, isn't it?\" \"No, Tony--more than doomsday.\" \"What can be more than that?\" \"Dawn after doomsday, Tony. The world is going to be destroyed. Tony, oh, Tony, the world is going to be most thoroughly destroyed; yet some of us here on this world, which most surely will come to an end, some of us will not die! Or we need not die--if we accept the strange challenge that God is casting at us from the skies!\" \"The challenge that God casts at us--what challenge? What do you mean? Exactly what is it that is going to happen, Eve--and how?\" \"I'll try to tell you, Tony: There are two worlds coming toward us--two worlds torn, millions of years ago perhaps, from another star. For millions of years, probably, they've been wandering, utterly dark and utterly frozen, through space; and now they've found our sun; and they're going to attach themselves to it-at our expense. For they are coming into the solar system on a course which will carry them close--oh, very close indeed, Tony, to the orbit of the earth. They're not cutting in out on the edge where Neptune and Uranus are, or inside near Venus and Mercury. No; they're going to join up at the same distance from the sun as we are. Do you understand?\" In spite of himself, Tony blanched. \"They're going to hit the earth, you mean? I thought so.\" \"They're not going to hit the earth, Tony, the first time around. The first time they circle the sun, they're going to pass us close, to be sure; but they're going to pass us--both of them. But the second time they pass us--well, one of them is going to pass us a second time too, but the other one isn't, Tony. The smaller one--Bronson Beta, the one about the same size as the earth and, so far as we can tell, very much like the earth--is going to pass us safely; but the big one, Bronson Alpha, is going to take out the world!\" \"You know that, Eve?\" \"We know it! There must be a margin of error, we know. There may not be a direct head-on collision, Tony; but any sort of encounter--even a glancing blow--would be enough and much more than enough to finish this globe. And an encounter is certain. Every single calculation that has been made shows it. \"You know what an exact thing astronomy is to-day, Tony. If we have three different observations of a moving body, we can plot its path; and we've hundreds of determinations of these bodies. More than a thousand altogether! We know now what they are; we know their dimensions and the speed with which they are traveling. We know, of course, almost precisely the forces and attractions which will influence them--the gravitational power of the sun. Tony, you remember how precise the forecast was in the last eclipse that darkened New England. The astronomers not only foretold to a\n\nsecond when it would begin and end, but they described the blocks and even the sides of the streets in towns that would be in shadow. And their error was less than twenty feet. \"It's the same with these Bronson bodies, Tony. They're falling toward the sun, and their path can be plotted like the path of Newton's apple dropping from the bough. Gravity is the surest and most constant force in all creation. One of those worlds, which is seeking our sun, is going to wipe us out, Tony--all of us, every soul of us that remains on the world when it collides. But the other world--the world so much like this--will pass us close and go on, safe and sound, around the sun again. . . . \"Tony do you believe in God?\" \"What's that to do with this?\" \"So much that this has got me thinking about God again, Tony. God--the God of our fathers--the God of the Old Testament, Tony; the God who did things and meant something, the God of wrath and vengeance, but the God who also could be merciful to men. For He's sending two worlds to us, Tony, not one--not just the one that will destroy us. He's sending the world that may save us, too!\" \"Save us? What do you mean?\" \"That's what the League of the Last Days is working on, Tony--the chance of escape that's offered by the world like ours, which will pass so close and go on. We may transfer to it, Tony, if we have the will and the skill and the nerve! We could send a rocket to the moon to-day, if it would do us any good, if any one could possibly live on the moon after he got there. Well, Bronson Beta will pass us closer than the moon. Bronson Beta is the size of the earth, and therefore can have an atmosphere. It is perfectly possible that people-who are able to reach it--can live there. \"It's a world, perhaps very like ours, which has been in immutable cold and dark for millions of years, probably, and which now will be coming to life again. \"Think of it, Tony! The tremendous, magnificent adventure of making a try for it! It was a world once like ours, circling around some sun. People lived on it; and animals and plants and trees. Evolution had occurred there too, and progress. Civilization had come. Thousands of years of it, maybe. Tens of thousands of years--perhaps much more than we have yet known. Perhaps, also, much less. It's the purest speculation to guess in what stage that world was when it was torn from its sun and sent spinning into space. \"But in whatever stage it was in, you may be sure it is in exactly that stage now; for when it left its sun, life became extinct. The rivers, the lakes, the seas, the very air, froze and became solid, encasing and keeping everything just as it was, though it wandered through space for ten million years. \"But as it approaches the sun, the air and then the seas will thaw. The people cannot possibly come to life, nor the animals or birds or other things; but the cities will stand there unchanged, the implements, the monuments, their homes--all will remain and be uncovered again. \"If this world were not doomed, what an adventure to try for that one, Tony! And a possible adventure-a perfectly possible adventure, with the powers at our disposal to-day!\" Tony recollected, after a while, that Balcom had bid him to learn from Hendron, as definitely as possible, the date and nature of the next announcement. How would it affect stocks? Would the Stock Exchange open at all? He remembered, at last, it was a business day; downtown he had duties--contracts to buy and orders to sell stocks, which he must execute, if the Exchange opened to-day. He did not venture to ask to have Hendron awakened to speak to him but, before ten o'clock, he did leave Eve. He walked to the subway. His eyes stared at the myriad faces passing him. His body was jolted by innumerable brief contacts. \"Gimme five cents for a cup of coffee?\" Tony stopped, stared. This panhandler too was trapped, with him and Kyto and Eve and all the rest, on the rim of the world which was coming to its end. Did he have an inkling of it? Whether or not, obviously to-day he must eat. Tony's hand went into his pocket.\n\nSpeculation about the masses assailed him. What did they think this morning? What did they want? How differently would they do to-day? Near the subway, the newsboys were having a sell-out; a truck was dumping on the walk fresh piles of papers. Everybody had a paper; everybody was reading to himself or talking to somebody else. The man with the half inch of cigar-stub, the boy without a hat, the fat woman with packages under her arm, the slim stenographer in green, the actor with the beaver collar; they all read, stared, feared, planned, hoped, denied. Some of them smirked or giggled, almost childishly delighted at something different even if it suggested destruction. It was something novel, exciting. Some of them seemed to be scheming.\n\nChapter 5--A World Can End AT ten o'clock the gong rang and the market opened. There had been no addition to public knowledge in the newspapers. The news-ticker carried, as additional information, only the effect of the announcement on the markets in Europe, which already had been open for hours. It was plain that the wild eyes of terror looked across the oceans and the land--across rice-fields and prairies, out of the smoke of cities everywhere. The stock market opened promptly at ten with the familiar resonant clang of the big gong. One man dropped dead at his first glance upon the racing ticker. On the floor of the Exchange itself, there was relative quiet. When the market is most busy, it is most silent. Phones were choked with regular, crowded speech. Boys ran. The men stood and spoke in careful tones at the posts. Millions of shares began to change hands at prices-down. The ticker lagged as never in the wildest days of the boom. And at noon, in patent admission of the obvious necessity, New York followed the example already set by London, Paris and Berlin. The great metals doors boomed shut. There would be no more trading for an indeterminate time. Until \"the scientific situation became cleared up.\" Cleared up! What a phrase for the situation! But the Street had to have one. It always had one. Tony hung on the telephone for half an hour after the shutting of the mighty doors. His empire-the kingdom of his accustomed beliefs, his job-lay at his feet. When he hung up, he thought vaguely that only foresight during the depression had placed his and his mother's funds where they were still comparatively safe in spite of this threat of world-cataclysm. Comparatively safe-what did that mean? What did anything mean, to-day? Balcom came into his office; he put his head on Tony's desk and sobbed. Tony opened a drawer, took out a whisky-bottle which had reposed in it unopened for a year, and poured a stiff dose into a drinking-cup. Balcom swallowed it as if it were milk, took another, and walked out dazedly. Tony went out in the customers' room. He was in time to see the removal of one of the firm's clients-a shaky old miser who had boasted that he had beaten the depression without a loss--on a stretcher. The telephone-girl sat at her desk in the empty anteroom. Clerks still stayed at their places, furiously struggling with the abnormal mass of figures. Tony procured his hat and walked out. Everyone else was on the street-people in herds and throngs never seen on Wall Street or Broad Street or on this stretch of Broadway, but who now were sucked in by this unparalleled excitement from the East Side, the river front, the Bowery and likewise down from upper Fifth and from Park Avenues. Women with babies, peddlers, elderly gentlemen,\n\ndowagers, proud mistresses, wives, schoolchildren and working-people, clerks, stenographers-everywhere. All trapped--thought Tony--all trapped together on the rim of the world. Did they know it? Did they feel it? No parade ever produced such a crowd. The buildings had drained themselves into the streets; and avenues and alleys alike had added to the throng. The deluge of humanity was possessed of a single insatiable passion for newspapers. A boy with an armful of papers would not move from where he appeared before he sold his load. News-trucks, which might have the very latest word, were almost mobbed. But the newspapers told nothing more. Their contents, following the repetition of the announcement of the morning, were of a wholly secondary nature, reflecting only the effect of the statement itself. A hundred cranks found their opinions in big type as fast as they were uttered--absurd opinions, pitiful opinions; but they were seized upon. There were religious revivals starting in the land. But the scientists--those banded together who had worked faithfully first to learn the nature of the discovery and then to keep it secret until today--they had nothing more to say. Tony dropped into a restaurant, where, though it was only afternoon, an evening hilarity already had arrived. The Exchange was closed! No one knew exactly why or what was to happen. Why care? That was the air here. Two men of Tony's age, acquaintances in school and friends in Wall Street, stopped at his table. \"We're going the rounds. Come along.\" Tony returned with them to the warm, sunlit street where the exhilaration of night--the irresponsibility of after-hours with offices closed and work done-denied the day. . . . Their taxi squeezed through, Broadway in which frantic policemen wrestled vainly with overwhelming crowds. It stopped at a brownstone house in the West Forties. A night-club, and it was crowded, though the sun was still shining. The three floors of the house were filled with people in business clothes drinking and dancing. On the top floor two roulette-wheels were surrounded by players. Tony saw heaps of chips, the piles of bills. He looked at the faces of the players and recognized two or three of them. They were hectic faces. The market had closed. This was a real smash,--not merely a money smash,--a smash of the whole world ahead. Naturally money was losing its value, but men played for it--cheered when they won, groaned when they lost, and staked again. The limit had been taken off the game. Downstairs, at the bar, were three girls to whom Tony's two friends immediately attached themselves. They were pretty girls of the kind that Broadway produces by an overnight incubation: Girls who had been born far from the Great White Way. Girls whose country and small-town attitudes had vanished. All of them had hair transformed from its original shade to ashen blonde. Around their eyes were beaded lashes; their voices were high; their silk clothes adhered to their bodies. They drank and laughed. \"Here's to old Bronson!\" they toasted. \"Here's to the ol' world coming to an end!\" Tony sat with them: Clarissa, Jacqueline, Bettina. He gazed at them, laughed with them, drank with them; but he thought of Eve, asleep at last, he hoped. Eve, slender as they, young as they, far, far lovelier than they; and bearing within her mind and soul the frightful burden of the full knowledge of this day. The room was hazy with smoke. People moved through it incessantly. After a while Tony looked again at the motley crowd; and across the room he saw a friend sitting alone in a booth. Tony rose and went toward the man. He was a person--a personage--worthy of notice. He was lean, gray-haired, immaculate, smooth. His dark eyes were remote and unseeing. First nights knew him. Mothers of very\n\nrich daughters, mothers of daughters of impeccable lineage, sought him. Wherever the gayest of the gay world went, he could be found. Southampton, Newport, Biarritz, Cannes, Nice, Deauville, Palm Beach. He was like old silver--yet he was not old. Forty, perhaps. A bachelor. He would have liked it if some one of authority had called him a connoisseur of life and living-an arbiter eleganti?, a Petronius transferred from Nero's Rome to our day. He would have been pleased, but he would not have revealed his pleasure. His name was Peter Vanderbilt. And he was trapped too,--Tony was thinking as he saw him,--trapped with him and Eve and Kyto and the panhandler and Bettina and Jacqueline and all the rest on the rim of the world which was going to collide with another world sent from space for that errand; but a world with still another spinning before it, which would pass close to our world--close and spin on, safe. Tony cleared his brain. \"Hello,\" he said to Peter Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt looked up and his face showed welcome. \"Tony! Jove! Of all people. Glad to see you. Sit. Sit and contemplate.\" He beckoned a waiter and ordered. \"You're a bit on the inside, I take it.\" \"Inside?\" \"Friend of the Hendrons, I remember. You know a bit more of what's going on.\" \"Yes,\" admitted Tony; it was senseless to deny it to this man. \"Don't tell me. Don't break confidences for my sake. I'm not one that has to have details ahead of others. The general trend of events is clear enough. Funny. Delicious, isn't it, to think of the end of all this? I feel stimulated, don't you? All of it-going to pieces! I feel like saying, \"Thank God!' I was sick of it. Every one was. Civilization's a wretched parody. Evidently there was a just and judging God, after all. \"Democracy! Look at it, lad. Here are the best people, breaking the newest laws they made themselves. Imagine the fool who invented democracy! But what's better on this world anywhere? So there is a God after all, and He's taking us in hand again-the way He did in Noah's time. . . . Good thing, I say. \"But Hendron and his scientists aren't doing so well. They're making a big mistake. They've done splendidly--hardly could have done better up to to-day. I mean, keeping it under cover and not letting it out at all until they had some real information. They had luck in the fact that these Bronson bodies were sighted in the south, and have been only visible from the Southern Hemisphere. Not many observatories down there--just South Africa, South America and Australia. That was a break--gave them much more of a chance to keep it to themselves; and I say, they did well up to now. But they're not well advised if they hold anything back much longer; they'd better tell anything--no matter how bad it is. They'll have to, as they'll soon see. Nothing can be as bad as uncertainty. \"It proves that all those names signed to this morning's manifesto are top-notch scientists. The human element is the one thing they can't analyze and reduce to figures. What they need is a counsel in public relations. Tell Cole Hendron I recommend Ivy Lee.\" Rising, he left Tony and vanished in the throng. Tony started to pay the check, and saw Vanderbilt's ten-dollar bill on the table. He rose, secured his hat and went out. The latest newspaper contained a statement from the White House. The President requested that on the morrow every one return to work. It promised that the Government would maintain stability in the country, and inveighed violently against the exaggerated reaction of the American people to the scientists' statement. Tony smiled. \"Business as usual! Business going on, as usual, during alterations,\" he thought. He realized more than ever how much his countrymen lived for and believed in business. He wondered how much of the entire truth had been told to the President, and what the political angle on it would be. Amusing to think of the end of the world having a political angle; but of course, it had. Everything had.\n\nHe took a taxi to the Hendrons' apartment. More than a block away from the building, he had to abandon the cab. The crowd and the police cordon about the apartment both had increased; but certain persons could pass; and Tony learned that he still was one of them. Several men, whose voices he could overhear in loud argument, were with Cole Hendron behind the closed doors of the big study on the roof. No one was with Eve. She awaited him, alone. She was dressed carefully, charmingly, as she always was, her lovely hair brushed back, her lips cool to look at, but so warm upon his own! He pressed her to him for a moment; and for that instant when he kissed her and held her close, all wonder and terror was sent away. What matter the end of everything, if first he had her! He had never dreamed of such delight in possession as he felt, holding her; he had never dared dream of such response from her--or from any one. He had won her, and she him, utterly. As he thought of the cataclysm destroying them, he thought of it coming to them together, in each other's arms; and he could not care. She felt it, fully as he. Her fingers touched his face with a passionate tenderness which tore him. \"What's done it for us so suddenly and so completely, Tony?\" \"'The shadow of the sword,' I suppose, my dear--oh, my dear! I remember reading it in Kipling when I was a boy, but never understanding it. Remember the two in love when they knew that one would surely die? 'There is no happiness like that snatched under the shadow of the sword.'\" \"But we both shall die, if either does, Tony. That's so much better.\" The voices beyond the closed door shouted louder, and Tony released her. \"Who's here?\" \"Six men: the Secretary of State, the Governor, Mr. Borgan, the chief of a newspaper chain, two more.\" She was not flunking about them. \"Sit down, but don't sit near me, Tony; we've got to think things out.\" \"Your father's told them?\" he asked. \"He's told them what will happen first. I mean, when the Bronson bodies--both of them--just pass close to the world and go on around the sun. That's more than enough for them now. It's not time yet to tell them of the encounter. You see, the mere passing close will be terrible enough.\" \"Why?\" \"Because of the tides, for one thing. You know the tides, Tony; you know the moon makes them. The moon, which is hardly an eightieth of the world in mass; but it raises tides that run forty to sixty feet, in places like the Bay of Fundy.\" \"Of course--the tides,\" Tony realized aloud. \"Bronson Beta is the size of the earth, Tony; Bronson Alpha is estimated to have eleven or twelve times that mass. That sphere will pass, the first time, within the orbit of the moon. Bronson Beta will raise tides many times as high; and Bronson Alpha--you can't express it by mere multiplication, Tony. New York will be under water to the tops of its towers--a tidal wave beyond all imaginations! The seacoasts of all the world will be swept by the seas, sucked up toward the sky and washed back and forth. The waves will wash back to the Appalachians; and it will be the same in Europe and Asia. Holland, Belgium, half of France and Germany, half of India and China, will be under the wave of water. There'll be an earth tide, too.\" \"Earth tide?\" \"Earthquakes from the pull on the crust of the earth. Some of the men writing to Father think that the earth will be torn to pieces just by the first passing of Branson Alpha; but some of them think it will survive that strain.\" \"What does your father think?\" \"He thinks the earth will survive the first stress--and that it is possible that a fifth of the population may live through it, too. Of course that's only a guess.\"\n\n\"A fifth,\" repeated Tony. \"A fifth of all on the earth.\" He gazed at her, sober, painless, without a sense of time. Here he was in a penthouse drawing-room on the top of a New York apartment, with a lovely girl whose father believed, and had told her, that four-fifths of all beings alive on the earth would be slain by the passing of the planets seen in the sky. A few months more, and all the rest--unless they could escape from the earth and live--would be obliterated. Such words could stir no adequate feeling; they were beyond ordinary meanings, like statements of distance expressed in light years. They were beyond conscious conception; yet what they told could occur. His mind warned him of this. What was coming was a cosmic process, common enough, undoubtedly, if one considered the billions of stars with their worlds scattered through all space, and if one counted in eternities of endless time. Common enough, this encounter which was coming. What egotism, what stupid vanity, to suppose that a thing could not happen because you could not conceive it! Eve was watching him. Through the years of their friendship and fondness, she had seen Tony as a normal man, to whom everything that happened was happy, felicitous and unbizarre. The only crises in which she observed him were emergencies on the football-field, and alarms in the stock-market, which in the first case represented mere sport, and in the second, money which he did not properly understand, because all his life he had possessed money enough, and more. Now, as she watched him, she thought that she would meet with him--and she exulted that it would be with him--the most terrific reality that man had ever faced. So far as he had yet been called upon, he had met it without attempting to evade it; his effort had been solely for more complete understanding. A contrast to some of those men--among them men who were called the greatest in the nation-whose voices rose loud again behind the closed doors. Some one--she could not identify him from his voice, which ranted in a strange, shrill rageevidently was battling her father, shouting him down, denying what had been laid before them all. Eve did not hear her father's reply. Probably he made none; he had no knack for argument or dialectics. But the ranting and shouting offended her; she knew how helpless her father was before it. She wanted to go to him; not being able to, she went to Tony. \"Somebody,\" said Tony, \"seems not to like what he has to hear.\" \"Who is he, Tony?\" \"Somebody who isn't very used to hearing what he doesn't like. . . . Oh, Eve, Eve! My dear, my dear! For the first time in my life, I'd like to be a poet; I wish for words to say what I feel. I can't make a poem, but at least I can change one: \"Yesterday this day's madness did prepare; To-morrow's silence, triumph, or despair; Love! For you know not whence you came, nor why; Love! For you know not why you go, nor where.\" The sudden unmuffling of the voices warned them that a door from the study had opened. Instantly the voices were dulled again; but they turned, aware that some one had come out. It was her father. For a few moments he stood regarding them, debating what he should say. Beyond the closed door behind him, the men whom he had left increased their quarrel among themselves. He succeeded in clearing his mind of it. \"Father,\" Eve said, \"Tony and I--Tony and I--\" Her father nodded. \"I saw you for a few seconds before you realized I was here, Eve--and Tony.\"\n\nTony flushed. \"We mean what you saw, sir,\" he said. \"We more than mean it. We're going to be married as soon as we can--aren't we, Eve?\" \"Can we, Father?\" Cole Hendron shook his head. \"There can't be marrying or love for either of you. No time to tell you why now; only--there can't.\" \"Why can't there be, sir?\" \"There's going to be altogether too much else. In a few months, you'll know. Meanwhile, don't spoil my plans for you by eloping or marrying in the Church Around the Corner. And don't go on doing-what I just saw. It'll only make it harder for both of you--as you'll see when you figure out what's before you. Tony, there's nothing personal in that. I like you, and you know it. If the world were going to remain, I'd not say a word; but the world cannot possibly remain. We can talk of this later.\" The study door again opened; some one called him, and he returned to the argument in the next room. \"Now,\" demanded Tony of Eve, \"what in the world, which cannot possibly remain, does he mean by that? That we shouldn't love and marry because we're going to die? All the more reason for it--and quicker, too,\" \"Neither of us can possibly guess what he means, Tony; we'd be months behind him in thinking; for he's done nothing else, really, for half a year but plan what we--what all the human race--will have to do. He means, I think, that he's put us in some scheme of things that won't let us marry.\" The argument in the room broke up and the arguers emerged. In a few minutes they all were gone; and Tony sought Cole Hendron in his big study, where the plates which had come from South Africa were spread upon the table. There were squares of stars, usually the same square of stars repeated over and over again. There seemed to be a score of exposures of the identical plate of close-clustered stars. \"You were downtown to-day, Tony?\" \"To-day they took it, didn't they? They took it and closed the Exchange, I hear; and half the businesses in town had a holiday. For they've known for quite some time that something has been hanging over them, hanging over the market. This morning we half told them what it is; and they thought they believed it. Just now I told six men the other half--or most of it--and--and you heard them, Tony; didn't you?\" \"Yes; I heard them.\" \"They won't have it. The world won't come to an end; it can't possibly collide with another world, because--well, for one thing, it never has done such a thing before, and for another, they won't have it. Not when you dwell upon the details. They won't have it. To-morrow there'll be a great swing-back in feeling, Tony. The Exchange will open again; business is going on. That's a good thing; I'm glad of it. But there are certain drawbacks. \"The trouble is, men aren't really educated up to the telescope yet, as they are to the microscope. Every one of those men who were just here would believe what the microscope tells them, whether or not they could see it or understand it for themselves. I mean, if a doctor took a bit of cell-tissue from any one of them, and put it under the microscope, and said, 'Sorry, but that means you will die,' there isn't a man of them who wouldn't promptly put his affairs in shape. \"None of them would ask to look through the microscope himself; he'd know it would mean nothing to him. \"But they asked for Bronson's plates. I showed them; here they are, Tony. Look here. See this field of stars. All those fixed points, those round specks, every single one of them are stars. But see here; there is a slight--a very slight--streak, but still a streak. There, right beside it, is another one. Something\n\nhas moved, Tony! Two points of light have moved in a star-field where nothing ought to move! A mistake, perhaps? A flaw in the coating of the plate? Bronson considered this, and other possibilities. He photographed the star-field again and again, night after night; and each time, you see, Tony, the same two points of light make a bit of streak. No chance of mistake; down there, where nothing ought to be moving, two objects have moved. But all we have to show for it are two tiny streaks on a photographic plate. \"What do they mean? 'Gentlemen, the time has come to put your affairs in order!' The affairs of all the world, the affairs of every one living in the world--Naturally, they can't really believe it. \"Bronson himself, though he watched those planets himself night after night for months, couldn't really believe it; nor could the other men who watched, in other observatories south of the equator. \"But they searched back over old plates of the same patch of sky; and they found, in that same star-field, what they had missed before--those same two specks always making tiny streaks. Two objects that weren't stars where only stars ought to be; two strange objects that always were moving, where nothing 'ought' to move. \"We need only three good observations of an object to plot the course of a moving body; and already Bronson succeeded in obtaining a score of observations of these. He worked out the result, and it was so sensational, that from the very first, he swore to secrecy every one who worked with him and with whom he corresponded. They obtained, altogether, hundreds of observations; and the result always worked out the same. They all checked. . . . \"Eve says she has told you what that result is to be.\" \"Yes,\" said Tony, \"she told me.\" \"And I told these men who demanded--ordered me--to explain to them everything we had. I told them that those specks were moving so that they would enter our solar system, and one of them would then come into collision with our world. They said, all right. \"You see, it really meant nothing to them originally; it stirred only a sort of excitement to close the Exchange and give everybody a hilarious holiday. \"Then I told them that, before the encounter, both of these moving bodies--Bronson Alpha and Bronson Beta--would first pass us close by and cause tides that would rise six hundred feet over us, from New York to San Francisco--and, of course, London and Paris and all sea-coasts everywhere. \"They began to oppose that, because they could understand it. I told them that the passing of the Bronson bodies would cause earthquakes on a scale unimaginable; half the inland cities would be shaken down, and the effect below the crust would set volcanoes into activity everywhere, and as never since the world began. I said, perhaps a fifth of the people would survive the first passing of the Bronson bodies. I tried to point out some of the areas on the surface of the earth which would be completely safe. \"I could not designate New York or Philadelphia or Boston. . . . They told me that to-morrow I must make a more reassuring statement.\" Cole Hendron gazed down again at his plates. \"I suppose, after all, it doesn't make much difference whether or not we succeed in moving a few million more people into the safer areas. They will be safe for only eight months more, in any case. For eight months later, we meet Bronson Alpha on the other side of the sun. And no one on earth will escape. \"But there is a chance that a few individuals may leave the earth and live. I am not a religious man, as you know, Tony; but as Eve said to you, it seems that it cannot be mere chance that there comes to us, out of space, not merely the sphere that will destroy us, but that ahead of it there spins a world like our own which some of us--some of us--may reach and be safe.\"\n\nChapter 6--First Effects TONY took Dave Ransdell home with him. The South African wanted to \"see\" New York. They awoke late; or at least Tony did, and for a few moments lay contentedly lazy, without recollection of the amazing developments of the day that was past. Only a vague uneasiness warned him that, when he finally roused, it would be to some sort of trouble. Tony, being a healthy and highly vigorous young man, had drowsed through such semirecollections before. . . . He had fought with and \"put out\" another policeman, perhaps? Tony became able to recollect \"showing\" some one the city; but who? Now Tony could visualize him--a tanned, quiet-humored, solid chap who could look out for himself anywhere. And girls liked him; but he was wary, even if he hadn't been to New York before. Even if he did come from South Africa! There, Tony had it! Dave Ransdell, the Pretoria flyer, who had brought the plates of the sky from Capetown to New York. Why? Because there were two little specks on those plates of the southern skies, which meant that two strange planetary bodies were approaching the earth--to wipe it out! That was the trouble Tony had to remember when he fully awoke. It wasn't that he'd knocked another policeman for a goal. It was that--that this room, and the bed, and the chair, everything outside, everywhere and every one, including you yourself, were simply going to cease to exist after a while. After a very definite and limited time, indeed, though the exact period he did not know. Eve had refused to tell him; and so had Dr. Hendron. No; the exact amount of time left for every one on the world, the members of the League of the Last Days would not yet impart. Tony stirred; and Kyto, hearing him, came in and began to draw his bath. \"All right, Kyto; never mind,\" Tony greeted him. \"I'll take a shower this morning. Is Mr. Ransdell up?\" \"Oh, entirely!\" \"Has he had breakfast yet, Kyto?\" \"Only one.\" \"You mean?\" \"He said he would have a little now--that was an hour ago--and finish breakfast with you.\" \"Oh. All right. I'll hurry.\" And Tony did so, but forgetting Ransdell, mostly, for his thinking of Eve. To have held her close to him, to have caught her against him while she clung to him, her lips on his--and then to be forbidden her! To be finally and completely forbidden to love her! Tony arose defiantly. Last night he had been rebellious; this morning he was only more so. Never had he known or dreamed of such dear delight as when he had claimed her lithe body with his arms, and she had clung to him; the two of them together against all the world--even against the end of all the world, against the utter annihilation! It was, he realized now, the terror of the approaching destruction which had thrown her so unquestioningly info his arms. Who could stand alone and look at doom? All nature, every instinct and impulse, opposed loneliness in danger. The first law of living things is self-perpetuation. Save yourself; and when you cannot, preserve your kind! Mate and beget--or give birth--before you die! Nothing less elemental, less overwhelming, than this threw Eve Hendron and Tony Drake together; and no joy compared with the result. What had he heard said, that he understood now: \"There is no happiness like that snatched under the shadow of the sword!\"\n\nBut her father forbade that joy. He not only forbade it, but denied its further possibility for them. And her father controlled her, not merely as her father, but as a leader of this strange society, the uncanny power of which Tony Drake was just beginning to feel: The League of the Last Days! A pledged and sworn circle of men, first in science all over the world, who devoted themselves to their purposes with a sternness and a discipline that recalled the steadfastness of the early Christians, who submitted to any martyrdom to found the Church. They demanded and commanded a complete allegiance. To this tyrannical society Eve was sworn; and when Cole Hendron had spoken to her, he commanded her and forbade not only as her father but as her captain in the League of the Last Days. . . . Tony found Ransdell at a window of the living-room. The morning paper was spread over a table. \"Hello,\" said Tony. \"Hear you've been up awhile. You've altogether too many good habits.\" The South African smiled pleasantly. \"I'll need more than I have for a starter, if I'm joining the League of the Last Days,\" he observed. \"Then you've decided to?\" asked Tony. It was one of the topics they'd discussed last night. \"Yes. The New York chapter, for choice.\" \"You're not going back to Capetown?\" \"No. Headquarters will be here--or wherever Dr. Hendron is.\" \"That's good,\" said Tony, and glanced toward the paper, but did not pick it up. \"Any special developments anywhere?\" \"Apparently a rather unanimous opinion that yesterday's announcement may be wrong.\" \"Hendron said there'd be general reaction. When you think of yesterday, you'd see there'd have to be.\" And Tony took the paper to the breakfast-table, where Ransdell joined him for another cup of coffee. The two young men, of widely differing natures and background and training, sipped their coffee and glanced at each other across the table. \"Well,\" questioned Tony at last, \"want to tell me how you really feel?\" \"Funny,\" confessed the South African. \"I bring up the final proof that the world's going to end; and on the trip find the dear old footstool a pleasanter place for me than I ever figured before it might be. . . . \"To mention the minor matters first,\" Ransdell continued in his engagingly frank and outright way, \"I've never lived like this even for a day. I've never been valeted before.\" Tony smiled. \"That reminds me; wonder if they'll let Kyto into the League?\" \"Not as our valet, I'm afraid,\" the South African said. \"I hope you permit me the 'our' for the duration of my stay. I do fancy living like this, I must admit. I'll also tell you that I appreciate very much just being around where Miss Hendron is. I didn't know there really was a girl like her anywhere in the world.\" \"Which is going to end, we must remember,\" Tony warned him. \"Every time we mention the world, we must remember it is going to end.\" \"Will you permit me, then, a particularly personal remark?\" inquired the South African. \"Shoot,\" said Tony. \"It is--that if I were in your place, I wouldn't particularly care what happened.\" \"My place, you mean, with--\" \"With Miss Hendron. In other words, I heartily congratulate you.\" \"You don't know what you're talking about,\" said Tony--too brusquely, and realized it. \"I beg your pardon. I mean, I thank you. . . . The Stock Exchange, I see, is going to be open to-day. In fact, it\n\nundoubtedly is open now; and I am not at my office watching the ticker and buying A. T. and T. on a scale down, and selling X-that's United States Steel--whenever it rises half a point, for somebody who wants to go short from lack of faith in the future. What am I talking about? Where is the future? What's happened to it?\" \"It seems to have regained its feet a bit to-day.\" \"Yes. The stock market is open. . . . There's the phone--probably my office. Mr. Balcom wants my personal advice after my last talk with Cole Hendron. I'm out or asleep, and you won't disturb me. You have my permission to put me into a coma--anything. . . . I ought to have said to you, Ransdell, I'm glad you're staying on. Stay on right here with me, if you like. \"There's no sense in my going to the office. There's no sense in anything on the world, now, but preparing and perfecting the Space Ship which--besides watching the stars--has been the business of the best brains in the League of the Last Days.\" \"How far have they got?\" \"Not far enough; but of course there's no mother to invention like necessity. And necessity seems to be distinctly visible--at least through a telescope--now.\" Tony went downtown; he visited his office. Habit held him, as it was holding most of the hundreds of millions of humans in the world this day. Habit--and reaction. What was threatened, could not be! If Cole Hendron and his brother-scientists refused, there were plenty of other people to put out reassuring statements; and the dwellers on the rim of the world regained much of their assurance. The President of the United States pointed out that, at worst, the sixty scientists had merely suggested disturbances of importance; and he predicted that if they occurred, they would be less than was now feared. Professor Copley, known to Tony as a friend of Cole Hendron's, called at the office. \"I've some things to sell,\" he said, plucking the pince-nez from the center of his ruddy, cheerful face. \"When do you think you can get me the most for them?\" And he laid down upon Tony's desk an envelope full of stock certificates. \"I'm just back from Peru,\" he explained, \"where I have been watching the progress of the Bronson bodies. Hendron tells me that you know the whole truth about them.\" \"It is the truth, then?\" asked Tony. \"Do you mean, do I agree? Do you agree that the sun will rise to-morrow morning?\" Professor Copley returned. \"My dear friend, the Bronson bodies move from the effect of the same forces.\" \"But,\" pursued Tony, \"exactly what do you think will happen to us?\" \"What will happen,\" retorted Professor Copley, cheerfully enough, \"if you toss a walnut in front of an eighteen-inch gun at the instant the shell comes out? The result, I should say, would be quite decisive and entirely final. So, I say, sell my stocks. My family, and my personal responsibilities, consist of only my wife and myself; there are many things we have desired to do which we have sacrificed in exchange for a certain security in the future. There being no future, why not start doing what we want immediately?--if now is the day to sell.\" \"Your guess on that,\" said Tony, \"will be as good as mine. To-day is better than yesterday; tomorrow the market may be nearer normal again--or there may be none at all. How do you find that people are taking it?\" \"Superficially, to-day they deny; but they have had a terrible shock. Shock--that's the first effect. Bound to be. Afterward--they'll behave according to their separate natures. But now they react in denials because they cannot bear the shock. \"All over the world! Some are standing in the Place de l'Opéra in Paris, hour after hour, I hear, silent for the most part, incredulous, numb.\n\nThese are the few that are too intelligent merely to deny and reject, too stunned to substitute a sudden end of everything for the prospect of years ahead for which they scrimped and saved. \"In Berlin there are similar groups. And imagine the reaction in Red Square, my friend! Imagine the Russians trying to realize that their revolution, their savage effort to remodel themselves and their inner nature, has gone for nothing. All wasted! It will be knocked aside by a mere pebble--a grain of sand sifting through the cosmos on an errand of its own. Knocked aside and annihilated, as if no Russian had ever lived! It is stupendous! Imagine being Stalin to-night, my friend. What horror! What humor! What merciless depths of tragedy! \"Imagine the haughty Mussolini, when he finds that the secret he could not exhort from his ironsouled men of learning is the secret of Fascism's vanity. Vanity of vanities! All, in the end, is vanity! Dust! \"He has jutted out his chin and lifted his hand in salute to his Black Shirts, mouthed his ringing sentences, and defied any one or anything to stay him; and behold! Ten billion, billion, billion miles away some trifling approach of stars made unstable the orbits of a couple of planets and sent them out into space so long ago that Mussolini's ancestors were not yet hairy apes--and now they appear to confound him. Imagine our President trying to decry, now, this! Ah, I could weep. But I do not. Instead-I laugh. I laugh because few men--but some--some--some, my friend--even in the face of this colossal ignominy of fate, go on and on through the night, burning out their brains yet in the endeavor to guide their own destinies. What a gesture! But to-day--what appalling shock! And afterward--what a scene! When the world--the fifteen hundred millions of human beings realize, all of them, that nothing can save them, and they cannot possibly save themselves. What a scene! I hope to be spared for it. Meanwhile, sell my stocks for the best prices you can obtain, please; for my wife and I--we have saved for a long time, and denied ourselves too much.\" In a taxi later in the day, Tony found the street suddenly blocked by a delirious group of men with locked arms, who charged out of a door singing-drunk, senseless. Tony was on his way to the Newark Airport, where a certain pilot, for whom he was to inquire, would fly him to the estate in the Adirondacks which had been turned over to Cole Hendron.\n\nChapter 7--Some Demands of Destiny EVE awaited him in a garden surrounded by trees. In the air was the scent of blossoms, the fragrance of the forest, the song of birds. It bore new qualities, a new interpretation of the external world, distinct from the tumultuous cacophony of the city. She was in white, with her shoulders and arms bare, her slender body sheathed close in silk. All feminine, she was, too feminine, indeed, in her feeling for the task she set for herself. Would she succeed better at it if she had garbed herself like a nun. An airplane droned in the twilight sky and dropped to its cleared and clipped landing-field. Eve arose from the bench beside the little pool, which was beginning to glint with the reflection of Venus, the evening star. She trembled, impatient; she circled the pool and sat down again. Here he came at last and alone, as she hoped. \"Hello, Tony!\" She tried to make it cool. \"Eve, my dear!\" \"We mustn't say even that! No--don't kiss me or hold me so!\"\n\n\"Why? . . . I know your father said not to. It's discipline of the League of the Last Days. But why is it? Why must they ask it? And why must you obey?\" \"There, Tony. Just touch my hands, like this--and I'll try to explain to you. But first, how was it in the city to-day?\" Tony told her. \"I see. Now, Tony, let's sit here side by side--but not your arm around me. I want it so much, I can't have it. That's why, don't you see? \"We're in a very solemn time, Tony. I spent a lot of to-day doing a queer thing--for me. I got to reading the Book of Daniel again--especially Belshazzar's feast. I read that over and over. I can remember it, Tony. \"'Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. \"'They brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God; and the king, and his princes, his wives and his concubines, drank in them. \"'They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.' \"Isn't that a good deal like what we've-most of us-been doing, Tony?\" \"'Now in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace; and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. \"'Then the king's countenance was changed; his knees smote together. The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans and the soothsayers.' \"And Daniel, you may remember, interpreted the writing on the wall. 'Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin. God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it. Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting. And in that night was Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldeans, slain.' \"It is something very like that which is happening to us now, Tony; only the Finger, instead of writing again on the wall, this time has taken to writing in the sky--over our heads. The Finger of God, Tony, has traced two little streaks in the sky--two objects moving toward us, where nothing ought to move; and the message of one of them is perfectly plain. \"'Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting,' that one says to us on this world. 'God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it.' But what does the other streak say? \"That is the strange one, Tony--the one that gives you the creeps and the thrills when you think of it. For that is the afterthought of God--the chance He is sending us! \"Remember how the Old Testament showed God to us, stern and merciless. 'God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth!' it said. 'And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth. And the Lord said, I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth; both man, and beast and the creeping things, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.' And then, God thought it over and softened a little; and He warned Noah to build the ark to save himself and some of the beasts, so that they could start all over again. \"Well, Tony, it seemed to me the second streak in the sky says that God is doing the same thing once more. He hasn't changed His nature since Genesis; not in that short time. Why should He? It seemed to me, Tony, He looked us all over again and got disgusted. \"Evolution, you know, has been going on upon this world for maybe five hundred million years; and I guess God thought that, if all we'd reached in all that time was what we have now, He'd wipe us out forever. So He started that streak toward us to meet us, and destroy us utterly. That's Bronson Alpha.\n\nBut before He sent it too far on its way, maybe He thought it all over again and decided to send Bronson Beta along too. \"You see, after all, God had been working on the world for five hundred millions of years; and that must be an appreciable time, even to God. So I think He said, 'I'll wipe them out; but I'll give some of them a chance. If they're good enough to take the chance and transfer to the other world I'm sending them, maybe they're worth another trial. And I'll save five hundred millions of years.' For we'll start on the other world, Tony, where we left off here.\" \"I see that,\" Tony said. \"What's in that to forbid my loving you now, my taking you in my arms, my--\" \"I wish we could, Tony!\" \"Then why not?\" \"No reason not, if we were surely to die here, Tony--with all the rest of the world; but every reason not to, if we go on the Space Ship.\" \"I don't see that!\" \"Don't you? Do you suppose, Tony, that the second streak in the sky--the streak that we call Bronson Beta which will come close to this world, and possibly receive us safe, before Bronson Alpha wipes out all the rest--do you suppose, Tony, that it was sent just for you and me?\" \"I don't suppose it was sent at all,\" objected Tony impatiently. \"I don't believe in a God Who plans and repents and wipes out worlds He made.\" \"I do. A few months ago, I wouldn't have believed in Him; but since this has happened, I do. What is coming is altogether too precise and exact to be unplanned by Intelligence somewhere, or to be purposeless. For those two streaks--the Bronson bodies--aren't cutting in on our little system out by Neptune or Jupiter, where they'd find no living thing. They've chosen, out of all space near us, the single sphere that's inhabited--they're directed for us. Directed--sent, that is, Tony. And if the big one is sent to wipe out the world, I don't believe the other is sent just to let me go on loving you and you go on loving me.\" \"What is your idea, then?\" \"It's sent to save, perhaps, some of the results of five hundred million years of life on this world; but not you and me, Tony.\" \"Why not? What are we?\" Eve smiled faintly. \"We're some of the results, of course. As such, we may go on the Space Ship. But if we go, we cease to be ourselves, don't you see?\" \"I don't,\" persisted Tony stubbornly. \"I mean, when we arrive on that strange empty world,--if we do,--we can't possibly arrive as Tony Drake and Eve Hendron, to continue a love and a marriage started here. How insane that would be!\" \"Insane?\" \"Yes. Suppose one Space Ship got across with, say, thirty in its crew. We land and begin to live-thirty alone on an empty world as large as this. What, on that world, would we be? Individuals paired and set off, each from the others, as here? No; we become bits of biology, bearing within us seeds far more important than ourselves--far more important than our prejudices and loves and hates. We cannot then think of ourselves, only to preserve ourselves while we establish our kind.\" \"Exactly what do you mean by that, Eve?\" \"I mean that marriage on Bronson Beta-if we reach it--cannot possibly be what it is here, especially if only a few, a very few of us, reach it. It will be all--"
