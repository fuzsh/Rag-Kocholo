        "text": "Great art deserves to be seen.\n\nI mean all kinds of art. From prose to poetry to paintings to plays, these things must be experienced, appreciated, and felt. Creative work deserves an audience. Art cries out to move someone and the better it is the louder it cries.\n\nMany things can never be experienced again. The original performance of Hamlet at the Globe theater, the Colossus of Rhodes, and the missing paintings of DaVinci have been lost to the mists of time. Other things are ephemeral; used and then discarded. The BBC production of The Caves of Steel from 1964, for example, was shown and then erased. As far as anyone knows it no longer exists. Imagine Michaelangelo’s David as an ice sculpture.\n\nStill, the sheer amount of stuff that deserves to be seen to which we could call attention must be mindboggling. It’s probably being produced faster than it can be consumed. Getting it all out there is likely an impossibility; that isn’t a reason not to try.\n\nAnd so, we come to the point. A body of work that deserves to be seen exists in my little corner of the universe. This small part of the unfathomable mass of art-worth-seeing is a piece I can do something about.\n\nThe gentleman pictured below is my grandfather, Joseph Franké.\n\nHe was a nationally known pen-and-ink illustrator whose work appeared in Boy’s Life, Women’s World, Blue Book, Red Book, and more. He illustrated significant novels like When Worlds Collide, by Phillip Wylie and Edwin Balmer, Why Didn’t They Ask Evans by Agatha Christie, and The Thin Man by Dashiell Hammett when each originally appeared in Blue or Red Book. According to a newspaper account of his memorial service, he was “considered by many art critics the finest in his field”\n\nThe point of this website is to put his work somewhere it can be found, seen, and enjoyed. There’s an excellent biography that can be found at A Field Guide to Wild American Pulp Artists. I wish I could remember more stories about my grandfather but sadly, he passed away about 30 years before I was born. I remember the story that David Saunders relates in that bio where he would leave in the morning with paintings to sell and return, having sold them, with candy for his children. I recall stories about building his studio attached to the back of the house and about the jubilation that followed getting a contract from Red Book Magazine to be the regular illustrator of their novels. My mom loved a story involving a litter of kittens; her dad baptized each one with a drop of something from the liquor cabinet, awarding each with an appropriate name. Growing up we had two cats, each named Wooski, in honor of the Whisky from that story. Mostly I remember the admiration that the family felt for his legacy. That admiration has been passed on to me.\n\nAnd, so, here we have it: a website dedicated to the art and legacy of Joseph Franké. I hope you’ll enjoy.\n\nThe final installment of When Worlds Collide by Phillip Wylie and Edwin Balmer ran in the January 1933 issue of Blue Book Magazine.\n\nThe Editor’s introductory column does not appear in this issue so there is no advance praise for the novel this time, but there are a lot more illustrations for this final installment, 12 in all. That matches the number of illustrations in the opening installment but when you consider the relative sizes of the pictures this is the most heavily illustrated section of the novel. A number of the illustrations are combined into stunning two-page or three-column spreads.\n\nThe layout of the initial two pages is interesting in that it not only evokes an upward journey away from the earth, foreshadowing the trip to Bronson Beta, but it uses the placement of the images to emphasize that motion. It also drives home the notion of a Space Ark.\n\nThe sweeping upward motion of the opening images is echoed here as the ship departs Earth. As earthbound creatures inhabit the lower-left portion of that previous image, the ultimate destination of Bronson Beta is featured in the upper-right here alongside its primary Bronson Alpha.\n\nIn one of the most dramatic images from the novel, travelers in the rocket ship look on as Bronson Alpha collides with Earth, destroying both.\n\nThe culminating image is reminiscent of Apollo 11 as Tony descends from the ship to become the first human on Bronson Beta.\n\nDawn breaks over a new world in the final image as a metaphorical Adam and Eve look on.\n\nThere’s no preview of course, but After Worlds Collide starts in just nine months!\n\nIn the January 1933 issue of Blue Book Magazine, we get the penultimate installment of When Worlds Collide by Phillip Wylie and Edwin Balmer.\n\nAs in the last issue, the editor didn’t single out this novel for special praise, it’s an example of the theme among many. The point though remains complementary,\n\n“Writing,” observed an acute commentator, “is not literature unless it gives to the reader a pleasure which arises not only from the things said, but from the way in which they are said; and that pleasure is only given when the words are carefully or curiously or beautifully put together.”\n\nIn the choice of material for this magazine we are governed first by what is said: by the power and pace and originality of the story; by the reality and human appeal of the people in it; by the interest of its background. But we must also be governed by the manner in which a story is told; for our readers are entitled to the best in this respect also.\n\nConsider… “When Worlds Collide” —a daring idea, set forth with purpose and conviction; people who are real and deserving of your friendship; added to these, a fine quality in the telling that makes it a novel among a thousand.\n\nThe Editor of Blue Book\n\nHere are the illustrations. The layout of the initial two pages is different once again.\n\nHere’s a closer look at the opening image.\n\nThis installment has only a single two-page spread.\n\nThe final image, below, looks distinctly different from the rest of the illustrations. Could this be a different artist? What do you think?\n\nThe American Girl was the official magazine of the Girl Scouts of the USA. Originally titled The Rally, it was founded, in 1917, about 5 years after the organization itself. It lasted until 1979.\n\nThe early issues contained the kind of content familiar to anyone who has received a newsletter from a national organization: chapter news, national campaigns, motivational articles, and the like.\n\nThe title change came in June 1920 and with it an increased page count and additional material beyond just scouting news. This also began a transformation from a newsletter to a magazine that doubled as a recruiting tool. In 1923 the publishers announced their intention to create “a magazine that will appeal more and more to our friends who are not Scouts — or, not yet Scouts, shall we say?” “It will be a great day for us when The American Girl takes her place proudly on the newsstands with all the other big grown-up magazines,” they proclaimed.\n\nFiction arrived as part of the additional materials, both as short stories and serials. With the fiction came illustrations, usually just one or two for each story or installment. Franké was a regular contributor for about three years starting with the January 1921 issue.\n\nResources\n\nGirl Scouts of the USA accessed 10 August 2022\n\n“Our New Name,” The American Girl, June 1920, National Headquarters Girl Scouts, Inc.\n\n“New Year Resolutions,” The American Girl, January 1923, National Headquarters Girl Scouts, Inc.\n\nIn contrast to the other things we’ve posted lately, this comes from the early part of Joseph Franké’s career.\n\nIn 1921 Earnest Clark Hartwell published a series of grade school readers for students, one for each of the first through eighth grades. Joseph Franké contributed to most of them.\n\nThat includes the fourth-year reader. Franké is explicitly mentioned on the title page for many of them but this one reads “Illustrations by E. A. Furman, B. Westmacott, E. B. Comstock, and others.” Franké is definitely one of the others.\n\nHere are his illustrations that I was able to identify in this volume, separated by the stories that they illustrate.\n\nThe Magic Bowl\n\nThe Thanksgiving Gifts\n\nThe Miller of the Dee\n\nHow Crusoe Made Pottery\n\nTry Again\n\nHarry and the Guidepost\n\nUncertain Images\n\nThere are a number of unsigned images that could be Franké’s work. Here are the two most likely.\n\nThis one is unsigned, but it is also an illustration for “The Magic Bowl.” The rest of the volume has stories that are illustrated by a single artist; that may also be the case here.\n\nThe second picture appears with a story called “The Prudent Farmer.”\n\nThere’s a signature in the lower right-hand corner and it could say “Franké” but it’s hard to be sure.\n\nThe resolution here isn’t teriffic but for the moment we can at least see the images. Eventually I’ll have to buy a hard copy of this book so that I can get a better look at this signature and maybe find more. If the quality of the hard copy is good enough I’ll try to get better scans of these.\n\nIn the mean time you can check it out for yourself at the link below. The best way to see the pictures appears to be to download the pdf.\n\nStory Hour Readings — Fourth Year (1921)\n\nWhat do you think? Are these last two images his work? How about the other unsigned images? Did I miss any? Please tell us in the comments!"
