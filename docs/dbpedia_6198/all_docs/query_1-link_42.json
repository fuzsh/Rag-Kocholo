        "text": "Platinum Equity and Existing Investor Bain Capital to Have Equal Ownership and Shared Commitment to Support Company’s Evolution as the Most Trusted Partner to Builders Across the Country\n\nLOS ANGELES (October 16, 2023) – Platinum Equity announced today the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a co-controlling stake in US LBM, a leading distributor of specialty building materials in the United States, from Bain Capital Private Equity (“Bain Capital”). Bain Capital and Platinum Equity will have equal ownership stakes and joint Board governance. Financial terms of the private transaction were not disclosed.\n\nFounded in 2009 with 16 locations in three states, US LBM has grown into one of the nation’s leading distributors of specialty building materials, operating more than 450 locations throughout the country. The company offers a comprehensive portfolio of specialty products, including windows, doors, millwork, wallboard, roofing, siding, engineered components and cabinetry.\n\nPlatinum Equity Co-President Jacob Kotzubei said he believes in the company’s short and long-term prospects.\n\n“US LBM has built an impressive, diversified business with scale while preserving a vibrant, entrepreneurial spirit,” said Kotzubei. “In the near term, we think the company’s footprint, financial profile, and operating model will allow it to continue growing and strengthening its operations as it navigates the complexities of the current environment. We are optimistic about the outlook for new housing over the long term given the nationwide shortage stemming from years of underbuilding that has created an imbalance in supply and demand. We look forward to working with the company’s leadership group and our partners at Bain Capital to put our financial and operational resources to work.”\n\nUS LBM will continue under the leadership of Founder, President and CEO L.T. Gibson and the current management team.\n\n“US LBM’s national platform, strong supplier relationships, commitment to operational excellence and boosting organic in-market growth continue to make us an acquirer of choice in the building materials industry,” said Gibson. “We look forward to working with Platinum and our ongoing partnership with Bain Capital. Their combined operational expertise and experience in the building products space will be a significant asset in driving the growth and expansion of our business.”\n\n“There are meaningful opportunities to continue building scale nationally and at the local level,” said Platinum Equity Managing Director Nathan Eldridge. “Our plan is to continue investing in core markets with new product offerings or capabilities, while further expanding the company’s reach geographically. We have a lot of experience investing in building products businesses and believe we are well positioned to support US LBM’s growth.”\n\nPlatinum Equity recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire Cook & Boardman, a leading specialty distributor of commercial door and security integration solutions. Other building products companies in the firm’s current portfolio include: JELD-WEN’s Australasia business; Cabinetworks, a leading US manufacturer and distributor of kitchen and bath cabinets; and PGS, a provider of hard surface floor coverings.\n\nThe US LBM transaction is expected to close by the end of Q1 2024 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nRBC Capital Markets LLC, Jefferies and Barclays are serving as financial advisors, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is serving as legal advisor, to US LBM and Bain Capital. Moelis & Company LLC is serving as financial advisor, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP is providing legal counsel, and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP is providing debt structuring counsel to Platinum Equity on the investment in US LBM.\n\nAbout US LBM\n\nUS LBM is the largest privately owned, full-line distributor of specialty building materials in the United States. Offering a comprehensive portfolio of specialty products, including windows, doors, millwork, wallboard, roofing, siding, engineered components and cabinetry, US LBM combines the scale and operational advantages of a national platform with a local go-to-market strategy through its national network of locations across the country.
