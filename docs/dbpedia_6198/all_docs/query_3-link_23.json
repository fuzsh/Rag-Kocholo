        "text": "A continuation from yesterday's post. The pressure to return capital is real, and it's impacting fund raising for PE. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôre seeing LPs being so straightforward and linking a distribution from one fund to a new commitment in another. They‚Äôve never been so precise with their asks.....However, fund managers have been slow to sell fund assets into the current uncertain markets, indicating a reluctance to crystallize asset values that may be lower than expected. Instead, many are using leverage to release funds.\" #privateequity #privatecredit https://lnkd.in/eF7DVMsf\n\nThe US private equity group Warburg Pincus LLC has raised $17.3bn for the largest fund in its 57-year history, joining a handful of peers in that have beat their targets as others struggle to bring in cash. The firm began soliciting investments for the new fund about two years ago with a $16bn target. The fund will focus on Warburg‚Äôs core business of corporate buyouts and equity stakes in companies, aiming to make between 75 and 90 investments averaging about $175mn apiece. Warburg chief executive Chip Kaye said the group‚Äôs measured approach had appealed to investors, citing its plans to ‚Äúremain disciplined about investment pacing‚Äù. #peinsider #privateequity #us #fundraising #investments #funds\n\nThe access to wealth management and the mass-market retail investor base for private markets fund managers is not just an opportunity in the future - it's happening in real-time, and mega private markets fund manager and fundraising machine Blackstone raises $1.3 billion for an evergreen fund providing investors access to the firm's various private equity investments. Investors will pay 1.25% on net asset value and 12.5% of total returns as long as it notches 5% gains. And of course, there are separate potential fees that the investment adviser intermediary (ie a Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS) may/likely will take on top of Blackstone's fees. The fund will take in money continuously and have no deadline to exit bets, with a goal of gaining as much as tens of billions of dollars. Another great source of recurring annual fees for private markets fund managers, with the shiny forecast of future premium returns for limited partners. But what if those returns don't happen? The traditional lag in distributions and returns of the private equity model leave investors hoping for the next over a 5-10 year time frame after their initial capital contribution. #fundraising #wealthmanagement #retailinvestors #fundmanagers #privateequity #privatemarkets #alternativeinvestments #netreturns #distributions https://lnkd.in/esNHZpkh\n\nIn recent years, private capital managers began a push beyond family offices into the wealthy individual channel. In early January, Blackstone raised $1.3 billion for its first PE fund for high-net-worth individuals. Last year, Apollo Global Management, Inc. launched two semi-liquid products for wealthy investors‚Äîone focused on PE and the other on private credit. The growing relevance of these #evergreen, semi-liquid products has sparked some concerns for individual and institutional investors alike. 1. My first story looks at the risk of cherry-picking--‚Äîwhen asset managers select more profitable deals for larger institutional funds and leave the ‚Äúleftovers‚Äù to individual investors. Read the full story here: https://lnkd.in/ebZJFC42 2. The second and most recent story looks at a potential \"crowding-out effect\" that could push institutional investors out of co-investment opportunities. Read it here: https://lnkd.in/eWq72dMH\n\nPantheon is pleased to announce the successful closing of Pantheon Global Secondaries Fund VII and associated vehicles (PGSF VII), its latest flagship global private equity secondaries offering, with commitments totalling $3.25bn. The total aggregate fundraising substantially exceeded the initial target of $2.0bn. Amyn Hassanally, Partner and Global Head of Private Equity Secondaries at Pantheon, commented: ‚ÄúWe are grateful for the strong support of our investors across the world who have entrusted us with their capital. Raising our largest-ever pool of capital reflects increasing interest from a growing range of investors in our strategy and focus on mid-market secondaries, where we can leverage Pantheon‚Äôs extensive relationships, data and insights.‚Äù PGSF VII follows Pantheon's proven secondaries strategy, investing in both traditional LP stake secondaries and GP-led secondaries opportunities. This approach offers the potential for discounts, early distributions, and premium returns, while mitigating risk through mature portfolio assets and established managers. #PEInsights #privateequity #fundraise #secondaries\n\nFour of the twenty largest private equity firms are now making their way back into the market with flagship funds this year. What will this mean for the hoped for uptick in deal volume in the second half of 2024 and into 2025? #deals #flagshipfunds #privateequity #investment #officeofthecfo #pe"
