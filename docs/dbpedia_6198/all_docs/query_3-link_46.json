Globally, ports are continuing to clear backlogs, but additional scope for efficiency gains remain. Further digitalization of port processes and modernization of port infrastructure would improve productivity, customer service and emissions reductions, the data suggests.\n\nDeveloped by the World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence, the fourth edition of the CPPI is a data-based comparable index that ranks 405 global container ports according to their efficiency, which is measured by the elapsed time between when a ship reaches a port to its departure from the berth having completed its cargo exchange. The CPPI ranking is intended to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement for the benefit of the key stakeholders in global trade, including government, shipping lines, port and terminal operators, shippers, logistics companies, business, and consumers.\n\nBased on the CPPI 2023 report and cross referenced with other sources, the Best Performing Ports ranking highlights the Port of Philadelphia (PA) in the No. 1 spot. This is followed by the Port of Charleston (SC); Port Everglades (FL); Port of Wilmington (NC); Port of Boston (MA); Port of Miami (FL); Port of Jacksonville (FL); Port of New York & New Jersey; Port of New Orleans (LA); and Port of Mobile, AL.\n\nTo rank Top Container Ports (by TEUs), the “2024 Port Performance Freight Statistics Program: Annual Report to Congress,” was referenced.

Supporting the life sciences industry in the state is MassBio (Massachusetts Biotechnology Council), a group with a mission to grow the industry, add value to the healthcare system, and improve patient lives. Founded in 1985, MassBio works to advance policy and promote education, while providing member programs, events, industry information, and services for the state’s life sciences cluster—#1 in the world.\n\nMassBio has developed a rating system to determine a municipality’s readiness to host biotechnology facilities based on the community’s zoning practices and infrastructure capacity. BioReady® rates communities in four tiers from Bronze up to Platinum. Through these ratings, MassBio seeks to provide cities and towns a platform to tell their stories that will ultimately help biotechnology companies find the most favorable destinations to locate. There are currently 90 BioReady communities across the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Life Sciences Leaders at the N0. 2 and No. 3 spots, respectively are San Francisco Bay Area, CA and Washington, DC/Baltimore, MD.\n\nRounding out the Life Sciences ranking are: New York City/New Jersey; Los Angeles/Orange County, CA; Raleigh/Durham, NC; San Diego/Carlsbad, CA; Philadelphia/Reading/Camden, PA-NJ; Seattle/Tacoma/Bellevue, WA; and Denver/Boulder, CO.\n\nThe life sciences sector in the U.S. has shown strong growth across various cities, despite some economic challenges.
