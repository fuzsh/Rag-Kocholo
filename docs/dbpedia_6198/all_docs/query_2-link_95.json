        "text": "Private Equity describes a broad range of investment strategies, investment structures, and underlying assets linked by several common characteristics. These investments are accessed through long-term commitments to funds managed by our investment partners and, where and when it will complement the activity of our partners, through targeted, direct investments into operating companies.\n\nInvestments in private markets are typically characterized by very long investment horizons and limited liquidity but bring to the Fund increased diversification and superior returns. The Fund’s scale, patience, and structural flexibility provide a comparative advantage in private markets and have allowed the fund to contribute to and benefit from the growth of more than 7,000 underlying investments.\n\nAPFC's private equity program seeks to build a diversified, global private equity portfolio, focusing on buyout, venture capital, real asset, and distressed credit opportunities through primary partnerships, secondary acquisitions, co-investments, and targeted direct investments in operating companies. We seek diversification across stage, industry, geography, and other factors.\n\nOur mandate also includes the ability to seek longer-term, high-conviction, potentially more concentrated, theme-driven investments across asset classes, sectors, and geographies. Such investments may include direct investments in venture capital and buyout deals, co-investments alongside general partners, and strategic stakes in promising investment firms.\n\nAPFC’s fund strategy emphasizes robust, long-term partnerships with exceptional investors applying specialized skills and unique insights to the companies or assets which they invest. Fund commitments represent the largest portion of our investing activities.\n\nIdentifying exceptional managers and succeeding with them over time is the key determinant of our long-term investment success.\n\nThe team evaluates and pursues targeted transactions alongside leading general partners. Co-investments enable the team to execute on APFC’s thematic areas and also identify targeted exposures to certain geographies, investment types and sectors as we build a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nAPFC engages in both pre-bid and post-bid syndication processes and can execute on tight timelines.\n\nWe target exceptional themes and unique opportunities through co-investments alongside our investment partners and — when our investment horizon, scale, and structural flexibility provide an advantage — direct investments into promising growth companies and undervalued assets.\n\nWe concentrate our investments behind exceptional themes and talented managers while maintaining a risk framework that ensures resilience if outcomes fall short of expectations."
