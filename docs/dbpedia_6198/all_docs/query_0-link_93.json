        "text": "The table is updated quarterly and provides information on the status of all active CalPERS private equity commitments; it doesn't include any exited partnership investments.\n\nThe Fund column lists the names of all active partnership investments.\n\nVintage Year is the year in which CalPERS’ first cash flow for the investment occurred.\n\nCapital Committed identifies the original amount CalPERS committed to each fund.\n\nCash In represents capital contributed for investments and management fees.\n\nCash Out represents distributions CalPERS has received back from the fund.\n\nCash Out & Remaining Value represents the distributions CalPERS has received plus the reported value of the invested capital.\n\nNet IRR is the Net Internal Rate of Return based on CalPERS’ actual cash flows and the reported value of the invested capital.\n\nInvestment Multiple is the Cash Out & Remaining Value divided by the Cash In.\n\nIn evaluating private equity performance, CalPERS emphasizes using both the realized Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Investment Multiple. Interim IRRs by themselves are not the best indicators of current or future fund performance.\n\nThe IRR is calculated based on CalPERS records of cash flows and financial statements from the investment managers."
