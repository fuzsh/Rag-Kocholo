        "text": "Public markets have continued to shrink over several decades and we are seeing high-quality companies stay private for longer, growing the PE universe to around 9,958 PE-backed companies and 6,452 growth-backed businesses in 2021, according to recent data from PitchBook.\n\nIn 2000, this combined figure was fewer than 3,000 companies, a clear signal for the direction this trend is continuing to progress, particularly when compared against listed equities – in the US, for example, there were about 7,000 domestic companies listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq in 2000; however, this figure dropped to 4,805 in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, more than 20 per cent of the S&P 500 market cap is concentrated in five companies, the newly anointed “Mamaa” stocks (Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet).\n\nThe investment case for PE has long been established and private capital is now abundant, enabling mature and high-quality companies to stay private for longer as there is more funding to support businesses on a larger scale.\n\nThis improved “menu” of funding choices has inevitably led to fewer companies choosing to list publicly, avoiding the reporting and regulatory obligations that accompany public listings but also recognising that an active PE partner can add a great deal of value to a business.\n\nA good recent example of this in Europe is Visma, the largest privately owned software company in Europe and one of our underlying portfolio companies. Towards the end of 2023, Visma completed a transaction led by its lead investor Hg, with a valuation of €19bn – a staggering amount, which just a few years ago would have prompted an initial public offering rather than a deal in the private market.\n\nOpportunities and challenges\n\nThat is not to say that the sector has not faced challenges. PE is not as strongly correlated with public equity markets as many think, but both experience their ups and downs. The past 12 months saw fewer PE deals being struck despite managers having healthy levels of capital available, largely due to the sharp rise in interest rates causing a larger-than-normal spread between what buyers and sellers were willing to settle for.\n\nMarket conditions have changed materially and the cost of debt is much more salient than it has been compared with the previous decade. Exacerbating this is the trend over the past 18 months of banks retrenching from leveraged buyouts, leaving private credit as the main source of funding to help finance these deals.\n\nThe value creation capabilities of PE managers will come even more to the fore during the next few years as interest rates stabilise at more “normal” levels, relative to the long term.\n\nStill, 2024 is shaping up into a more eventful PE landscape than 2023, with activity likely to increase, albeit cautiously. A recent report from Bain & Company indicated that around three-quarters of buyout dry powder was raised during the past three years – this funding will have to find a home sooner or later.\n\nPE managers typically have an investment period of five to six years to deploy dry powder, allowing them to ride out market bumps in a disciplined manner, but equally they cannot sit on their hands forever.\n\nThere are risks in waiting too long as it is human nature that once a manager is behind pace in an investment period, mistakes can creep in due to decisions made in haste. The most recent destination for a lot of funding has been slightly skewed, with big names raising large sums of capital – albeit generally more slowly than in the recent past – while many smaller companies have struggled to hit fundraising targets.\n\nThe root of this has been the slowing of merger and acquisition activity. When exits do not happen, money is not returned to investors and cannot be redeployed. This bottleneck could clear somewhat this year as we are hearing a lot of positive noise from pipeline activity, which is encouraging, and if just some of this converts successfully it will be a year that sees the market come back. There is much talk of sellers of private businesses becoming more realistic around pricing expectations.\n\nMore ways to exit\n\nA common misconception often cast at PE investors is that they simply sell to each other, often derisively dubbed “passing the parcel”. While a PE company selling to another PE firm is indeed a popular exit route, it is important to understand that there is a great deal of diversity within the PE sphere and different PE firms are different sizes with different roles to fulfil.\n\nFor example, a small PE company might buy out a founder of a business, deal with the succession issues and professionalise the company, making it more attractive and relevant to larger PE players.\n\nIt may then sell on to a bigger PE manager, who can bring expertise around internationalisation or a buy-and-build strategy. In turn, this manager might carry out its value creation plan and then sell to large sector-specialist PE company that can bring deeper industry knowledge and then sell to a trade buyer.\n\nIn fact, selling to trade is typically the most common exit route in the industry. Within our own portfolio we have seen trade buyers become more prevalent in recent times, taking advantage of this period when PE managers have been more cautious.\n\nAn exit to a trade buyer is almost always the goal of PE companies, because trade players can bring synergies with their existing business and therefore place a strategic value on a target, allowing them, in theory, to pay a higher price than a PE business.\n\nAny transaction has to make sense for the specific circumstances at hand. IPOs in general are a relatively small part of the market (typically between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of PE exits, over the long term) and tend to be relevant mainly for the biggest PE players.\n\nThe lack of reliance on IPOs is actually a strength for PE, as a lull in listings – such as the one seen recently – does not necessarily stop PE managers from exiting investments.\n\nThe pension fund question\n\nLooking more broadly at the political side, chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s Mansion House speech definitely stirred debate last year when he suggested pension funds should be allocating a minimum of 5 per cent capital to PE by 2030. Given the clear maturation of PE markets globally, it is a positive move for the government to seek ways for PE to function better as part of the pensions investment universe.\n\nDepending on risk tolerance and liquidity requirements, PE should have a place in any portfolio due to its diversifying properties, large universe of private companies – which are often niche market leaders and disruptive businesses – and track record of outperformance compared with listed markets.\n\nThe reality is that pension funds today face real challenges in meeting the growth and income needs of their investors, and will undoubtedly be looking ahead to where returns will come from over the next two decades anyway.\n\nThe investible universe for PE is expected to broadly double in size from a level of around $5tn assets under management over the next 10 years.\n\nIf listed equity markets also continue to shrink, pension funds may have no choice but to invest meaningfully in PE or risk shutting themselves and their members off from a different and lucrative source of growth and income.\n\nAlan Gauld is a fund manager at Abrdn Private Equity Opportunities Trust"
