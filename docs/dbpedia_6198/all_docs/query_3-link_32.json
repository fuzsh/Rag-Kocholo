        "text": "As of June 30, 2023\n\nReturn since inception\n\n13.39% as of June 30, 2023\n\nMeasuring portfolio performance\n\nCalSTRS uses the dollar-weighted internal rate of return (IRR) to measure portfolio performance, as recommended by the Association of Investment Management and Research.\n\nThe CalSTRS IRR calculation method may differ from the methods used by the General Partner or other Limited Partners.\n\nCalSTRS maintains records, including the IRR, for each limited partnership.\n\nFactors influencing IRR calculations\n\nThere is no industry-standardized method for valuation or reporting, which makes comparisons of these numbers difficult. All of the following can create differences in IRR calculations:\n\nCash-flow timing\n\nThe accounting treatment of carried interest\n\nPartnership management fees\n\nAdvisory fees\n\nOrganization fees\n\nOther partnership expenses\n\nSale of distributed stock\n\nValuations\n\nIn addition, the purchase of secondary interests makes for unique comparison problems due to the specific pricing and timing characteristics of the transaction when contrasted with the Limited Partners Investment.\n\nIRR over time\n\nThe actual IRR performance of any limited partnership is not known until the final liquidation of the partnership, typically over 10 to 12 years. Until the liquidation takes place, the IRR is only an interim estimated return.\n\nThe IRR calculated for a partnership in the first three years of its life are relatively meaningless given the “J-curve effect.” The J-curve phenomenon is the effect of the cash-flow behavior of a partnership. It can be summarized as the first year’s investment expenses of investing in a fund that has yet to harvest its capital gains in the future. This normally translates into a negative IRR in the early years of the fund. The plot of the partnership values over time generally resembles a letter J.\n\nPerformance report disclaimer\n\nPlease note that none of the information contained in the Private Equity Portfolio Performance Report has been reviewed or approved by the General Partners of the funds."
