The private equity firm could invest an additional 25% of the fund's final size, or roughly $19 billion in total, including coinvestments, sources said.\n\nPlatinum's new credit strategy will seek to invest in businesses experiencing operating or financial troubles, according to the report.\n\nA Platinum Equity representative declined Bloomberg's request for comment."
