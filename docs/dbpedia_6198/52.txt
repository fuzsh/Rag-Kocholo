Platinum Equity LLC is hitting the fundraising markets for its first-ever credit investment vehicle to raise up to $1 billion and for its sixth flagship buyout fund to raise as much as $15 billion, Bloomberg Markets reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The buyout fund has a $12 billion initial target, but depending on investor demand, the total reportedly could be expanded by $3 billion. The private equity firm could invest an additional 25% of the fund's final size, or roughly $19 billion in total, including coinvestments, sources said.

Platinum's new credit strategy will seek to invest in businesses experiencing operating or financial troubles, according to the report.

A Platinum Equity representative declined Bloomberg's request for comment.
