Platinum Equity is a global private equity firm. Along the way to growing its AUM to more than $19B, Platinum needed to maintain its most powerful competitive edge - its trademarked M&A&O™ strategy. So, here was our challenge: deepen the firm's bench of operational leaders.

Platinum Equity is a global private equity firm. The firm has earned its reputation through its specialization in mergers, acquisitions, and operations, with its large in-house operations team aggressively managing the firm’s portfolio by implementing custom playbooks at every operating company, and with its M&A team actively pursuing transactions.
