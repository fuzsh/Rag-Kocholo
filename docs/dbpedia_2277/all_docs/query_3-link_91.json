        "text": "About FJK Foundation\n\nFr John Kolkman (FJK) Foundation is a United States based non-profit organization, endorsed by the competent authorities in Cameroon to carry out prescribed services as a non-Governmental Organization.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to the prevention, early detection and management of sickle cell disease in the Rural Health Districts of Cameroon. It is the first structured organization to: 1) raise public awareness and education in the region; 2) introduce and implement intervention measures; 3) promote health activities for SCD control and management.\n\nFJK Foundation was founded in 2010 by Deacon and Mrs. Neba to assist families with sickle cell disease in Bafut. The Foundation has since stretched its circumference of operation and services to over 1,000 families in and beyond Cameroon’s North West Region. FJK’s operations and services to those in need regardless of creed, ethnicity and culture are based on Catholic Social teachings.\n\nOur Definition\n\nCollaborations\n\nOur Name\n\nCommunity Impact\n\nOur Genesis\n\nVision\n\nRestore wholeness to the sickle cell person and family to live a normal and productive life.\n\nMission\n\nEnsure the early detection, prevention of SCD, proper management and treatment of SCD related complications; promote and improve the quality of life of sickle cell patients through targeted services; provide outreach, awareness, case management, screening, nutrition and counseling services.\n\n“we believe in measurable success and accountability.”\n\nValues\n\nAll humans have a right to health care and to secure the basic necessities of healthcare.\n\nOur expressed concern is the well-being of person and family.\n\nOur full potentials are realized when we share our lives with others and cooperate on projects that hold the promise of mutual benefit.\n\nWe have a moral obligation to health care initiatives.\n\nOur experience, environment and those we encounter shape our decisions.\n\nWe take responsibility for our every action.\n\nWe recognize the family as the primary caregiver, center of strength and support for the human being.\n\nOur Goals\n\nImplement strategies to assist SCD affected individuals and families.\n\nProvide accurate, valuable, and current SCD information to healthcare providers, patients and their families, schools, social service agencies and the general public.\n\nProvide leadership in raising awareness, establishing standard protocols for patient services and supporting basic research initiatives.\n\nOffer opportunities to advance the sickle cell cause and focus on health promotion activities.\n\nAdvocate for the implementation of preventive interventions that include sickle cell testing and screening (for new born babies, expecting mothers and engaged couples).\n\nOur Creed\n\nWe take to heart and strive to maintain our creed and values as stated:\n\nHuman life is a precious gift from God; we are stewards of this gift.\n\nWe enter into a mutual respect, trust, and honest relationship with our clients.\n\nHuman wholeness constitutes the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions.\n\nWe have an opportunity to share in the suffering and healing ministry of Christ.\n\nWe are not capable of curing sickle cell disease; we are capable of caring for each sick person.\n\nRotary Club | Ventura South\n\nHospital Sisters\n\nMission Outreach\n\nThe English Speaking International Roman Catholic Church, The Hague\n\nFrans & Ely Kolkman and Friends\n\nArchdiocese of Bamenda\n\nPredestined, Inc\n\nFr John Kolkman\n\nIn Brief\n\nOctober 11 the anniversary day of passing to eternal life of Fr John Kolkman, a Dutch Mill Hill Missionary, in whose memorial the FJK Sickle Cell Foundation is created.\n\nFather Kolkman died in harness… on his way to a Christian community doing the work for which he had conscrated his life. He believed in his priest hood and God gave hime the grace never to waver or doubt about it. … extremely hard working… nothing was too much for him. His fellow priests and laity expressed concern at the heavy apostolic work load he imposed on himself…and feared he might work himself to an early death…'” [extract from funeral Homily by Archbishop Paul Verdzekov (RIP) – Oct 12, 1985].\n\nPrayer\n\nAlmighty and Merciful God, we thank you for the priesthood of Fr John Kolkman, his dedicated service and the lifes he touched and continue to do so through his foundation. Bring his soul to your Light. Bless his family, the Mill Hill Missionaries and all those who helped him to the altar of priesthood. Bless the sponsors and Benefactors of his Foundation. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nJK Foundation has impacted many families and affected persons. Public awareness and sensitization levels have increased through organized conferences, family and community workshops, seminars, media coverage and presentations. Hospitalization rates for children in the FJK SCD management program have reduced or been eliminated in some cases. School attendance for affected children has improved.\n\nInterventions as screening, counseling, nutritional supplementation have been well received in the communities and the impact is visibly significant. Self-esteem for affected teenagers and even parents has changed for the better. The perception of sickle cell affected families in the community is changing. There is a developed interest among young people and parent-teacher-associations in learning about the disease. The expansion of sickle cell services is a long term goal.\n\nIn 2006, the Neba Family planned to return to Cameroon for a Thanksgiving Celebration following the Deacon’s ordination in 2004. Part of the plan was to raise money during the occasion to construct a public hall – the proceeds from its usage would be used to assist sickle cell patients. On discussing with Christian Cardinal Tumi, he suggested a clinic would better serve the needs of the patients than a hall. Thus, the foundation was\n\nconceived on January 1, 2007, and launched in Bamenda over a two day period: January 27th at the St Joseph’s metropolitan Cathedral and St Joseph’s Parish, Bafut. Over 5,000 people were in attendance and the\n\nsum of CFA 1.2 million was raised. Christian Cardinal Tumi – Archbishop Emeritus of Douala, Archbishop Cornelius Fontem Esua of Bamenda, and Archbishop Simon-Victor Tonye Bakot of Yaoundé were principal celebrants of the historic launching ceremony amidst royal and honorable\n\ndignitaries: Fon Abumbi II of Bafut, Fon FOZO II of Awing, Chief Wanki of Mambu; Hon Martin Chungong Ayafor; Mrs. Grace Mba of EDUCARE. In 2008 HR Chief Ntoh of Bawum commissioned the Quifor of Bawum to designate a site for the construction of a Sickle Cell Center and Clinic. The Chumgom family was generous enough to offer the site where the center is under construction."
