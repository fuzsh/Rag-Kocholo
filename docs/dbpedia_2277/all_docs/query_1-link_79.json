        "text": "Vatican City, Sep 7, 2005 / 22:00 pm\n\nThis morning the Holy See Press room announced the names of the bishops apointed by Pope Benedict XVI to the 11th general assembly of the Synodf of Bishops.\n\nPope Benedict XVI has named 36 participants to join in the deliberations of the Synod of Bishops, which will meet in October to discuss the Eucharist. .\n\nThe Pope's list included 4 bishops from mainland China, including 2 bishops of the \"underground\" Church there-- although one of the \"underground\" bishops is also recognized by the Beijing government. Vatican sources indicated that they are hopeful the Chinese bishops will be allowed to attend the October sessions in Rome. The invitation to the \"underground\" bishops was the first such gesture since the Communist takeover in China, and a clear sign of the Vatican's desire to improve relations with that regime.\n\nThe list includes several prelates from the Roman Curia; and representatives of the episcopal conferences that unite the bishops of Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. The priests who lead two lay movements-- Opus Dei and Communion and Liberation-- are included, as is the head of the Jesuit order. And the Eastern Catholic communities are represented, with prelates from the Syro-Malabar, Maronite, Ukrainian, and Melkite churches. A full list appears below.\n\nThe 11th general assembly of the Synod of Bishops will be held from October 2 to 23.
