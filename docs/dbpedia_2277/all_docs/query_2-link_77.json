        "text": "‘’In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground, for out of it weast thou taken from dust taken: for dust thou are and unto dust shall thou return’’. This is biblical quotation, announced the appearance of death to the earth from God the creator. Death has remained one of the greatest mysteries surrounding humanity from the beginning of times and cutting through all ages of humanity. Death is one of the most questioned phenomenons, augured, complained feared amongst humanity. People ask questions like what are the cause of death, where does the deaths go to, what is the relationship between the death and the living. It is important to note that this questioning and the mysteries that surround death have cause people of different, ages, periods cultural, religious and geographical regions to develop different interpretations and perception of death and the issues surrounding it. It is worth noting that it is thus the different interpretations and perceptions given to death that analyst call the social representation of death and we must note that, no community is free from the issue of social representation especially in Africa.\n\nThe article describes a new mortuary in Cameroon, which has been constructed in a government hospital by the Bali-Nyonga Development and Cultural Association (BANDECA). The history and character of this hometown association is analysed and the article then argues that the mortuary has changed the temporality of death celebrations, and that this change is largely driven by the needs of national and international migrants. It claims that the association and the traditional authorities are attempting to steer recent changes within a longer historical process of ‘modernizing’ burial. The construction of the mortuary reveals some of the tensions within the community and the challenges these present to the association&#39;s leadership.

Finally, the article shows that, despite the increased mobility of the...\n\nThis paper investigates the effects of cremation on African traditional celebrations of the living dead in Kenya. The study examines bereavement and mourning practices in communities, with a particular focus on traditional modes of mourning, grieving, and remembering the living dead. According to the study, African traditions, the spread of Christianity, the influence of the Hindu culture, and Islamic beliefs all conflict with the changing culture that is slowly embracing cremation. The methodology for this study involved secondary data. The conclusion drawn from the study is that even as the scarcity of land pushes societies to consider the option of cremation, cultural and religious perceptions have painted the practice unethical and term it “un-African.” In Kenya, the majority of the population still opts to bury their dead in their ancestral homes in order to perform ritual and religious burial rites."
