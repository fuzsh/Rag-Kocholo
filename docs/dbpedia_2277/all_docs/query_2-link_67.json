He was a scholar, a poet, a politician, a philosopher, a man of action and a man of courage. He was never too busy to see someone who was troubled, never too tired to take up the case of the oppressed or the downtrodden.

We could use a lot of words and still not get to the heart of the matter because ordinary words are for ordinary men and Bernard Fonlon was unique.

It occurred to me that “Socrates in Cameroon” should be the title not only of an interview but also of a book that would demonstrate in some small measure Dr Fonlon’s great wisdom. Grateful acknowledgement is made to Professor Bjornson for his insight. It would have taken a long time for this book to appear were it not for the commitment of one of Dr Fonlon’s most devoted friends, Professor Loreto Todd of the University of Leeds. I am indebted to Professor Todd for undertaking all printing arrangements and ensuring that a fitting volume be published in memory of our honoured friend. I am grateful to all the contributors, and also to those whose tributes sadly could not be included for logistical reasons. They include: Siga Asanga, Jean Paul Ayina, Nouck Thomas Bibum, Elizabeth Cockburn (University of Guelph), Nsaikimo Killian Fai, Fai Henry Fonye, Myles R.R. Frechette (US Ambassador to Cameroon), Victor Anomah Ngu, Mabel M. Smythe-Haith (US Ambassador to Cameroon, 1977-80), Godfrey B. Tangwa, Isaac Celestin Tcheho and Barrie R. Walkley (US Cultural Attache, 1982-86). I hereby acknowledge the support of my University, which has funded the book exclusively. I wish to thank the current Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Professor Jean-Louis Ndongmo, for his enthusiastic support in encouraging funding of the project. I salute the current Vice-Chancellor, Professor Jacob Lifange Ngu, Chairman of Yaounde University’s Book Publications Committee, for his commitment to its publication.\n\nxiii\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

He was a scholar, a poet, a politician, a philosopher, a man of action and a man of courage. He was never too busy to see someone who was troubled, never too tired to take up the case of the oppressed or the downtrodden. He was a man who could communicate, with style, in half a dozen world languages but who could also use Pidgin English if it meant putting his listeners at ease. He was a man who moved in opulent circles but who collected for himself not money but the hearts of those who got to know him. It is easy to use superlatives of someone like Bernard Fonlon, easy to make him sound like a sage or a saint; it is less easy to describe the humour and the courtesy and the gentleness that irradiated all that he said and did. Our initial purpose in writing this introduction was to describe briefly the life and times of a man whose story incorporates the history of a young nation and whose autobiography, The Pathfinder, has all the excitement of an adventure novel. We could use a lot of words and still not get to the heart of the matter because ordinary words are for ordinary men and Bernard Fonlon was unique. He was fond of quoting a Latin tag, Verbum sat sapienti est, meaning that to the wise, a word is sufficient, and it is perhaps fitting that we should take our cue from this. To those who knew him, no introduction is necessary; to those who did not know him, no short introduction is enough. Bernard Fonlon did not leave a worldly legacy to his family and friends and country. He left much more. He left ideas that can never be buried and ideals that will challenge new generations. He was, as we have said, unique, but at the same time, he is in a line of people who gave their lives to serve their people. He lived in happier times than the freedom xv\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

L’Ouverture inspired both Blacks and Whites and was commemorated in a sonnet by Wordsworth. The last lines of the poem could have been written for Bernard Fonlon: Though fallen thyself, never to rise again, Live and take comfort. Thou hast left behind Powers that will work for thee; air, earth and skies; There’s not a breathing of the common wind That will forget thee; thou hast great allies; Thy friends are exultations, agonies, And love, and man’s unconquerable mind.\n\nCopyright © 2010.

All rights reserved.\n\nDaniel Noni Lantum Dr Bernard N. Fonlon trod this earth for 62 years, that is, from 24 November, 1924, to 26 August, 1986. From the time he took over the role of interpreter at the historic Foumban Constitutional Conference in July, 1961, he became a Cameroonian public figure. However, the years between 1924 and 1961, the period of his youth and maturity, during which he was being prepared or trained for his future mission, are, as would be expected, less well known to the public and even to most of his close relatives. While they led an ordinary village life, the Spirit led their kinsman to strange frontiers, moulding him into an iron-willed man destined to make an impact on the moral, cultural, academic and political life of the young Cameroon nation, which seemed to have awaited his arrival before its birth in 1961. It is this early period that I will attempt to treat here, from rust-hand knowledge of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, who was not only my townsman but my very close and special friend. This claim to a special relationship can be supported by the careful choice of words he used in his letters to me, terms which ranged from “your devoted friend” (1951) to “your affectionate Brother, Ben” (1955). And so we lived in friendship till I followed him on his last journey, behind the Kumbo Cathedral, where he was laid to rest as a priest, on Sunday, 1 September, 1986, near Rev. Father Aloysius Balon Wankuy and Father Jacob. Even with this intimacy, I cannot claim that I knew the man completely. The present account is at best a rough summary of my impressions of him, as well as some events that we lived through together. If my story of the epoch 1\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nserves as a dependable outline of the personality of Bernard N sokika Fonlon, the details could be supplied by friends, members of the “inner circle”, as he sometimes called us, and by close relatives who lived with him. The special friends include Paul Verdzekov (Archbishop of Bamenda), Omar Birshu Banye Sendze and Bridget Biybe, now Mrs B.B. Wirnkar. Furthermore, it is quite possible that in The Pathfinder, his memoirs, which the Lord permitted him to compile and edit with his traditional rigour but never allowed him to see in print, Dr Fonlon may have written in greater detail. If this version differs from his in any point of fact, The Pathfinder should be taken as authoritative. As for me, Ben was nine years my senior and so was my mentor as well as my friend. By 1950, the academic gap between him and me was so tremendous that I saw him as a special person, a luminary, a pace-setter, a specially blessed and gifted person, a highly educated person, a philosopher in short, a senior brother with so many virtues and attributes that before him I felt like a dwarf. Hence he not only attracted my deep respect and admiration but won my friendship (“brotherhood” would be a more appropriate term) and thus became an object of my profound love and emulation. 1 Background Papa Joseph Fonlon was born in the mountain village of Banten, where the clouds never let the Kumbo people see the hilltops. He had brothers, including Baba Kong of Nkambe and Baba Kong of Djottin, father of Bernard Ngoran.1 Pa Fonlon’s father was Shwaaiy and his mother was Binyuy of Mbiim compound in Meluv village. From his birth, Papa Fonlon inherited the social rights and privileges of the Nchelavsi social group in Nso polity. These are sometimes called “retainers” or the Fon’s servants. So Dr 2\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nBernard Fonlon was of the Nchelav by inheritance from his father’s line. History has it that before his father’s conversion, he took part in the pagan raids which resisted the installation of the Catholic religion in N so land between 1913 and 1918. From the mother’s line, the story is told that the lineage head of Jem (in Kumbo town) had given a daughter in marriage to Boh compound in the village of Dzeng. There, she who was later to be known as Yesum Kibver-wo-Jem,2 married a great warrior and hunter called N gwang N gaafin. Boh people are related to Kitukela Dzeng and Ntenyuy lineages. Of this marriage Naa (Dr Fonlon’s mother) was born. Fortunately or unfortunately for Naa, her brother William of Jakiri and her sister Regina, who is Singeh’s mother, they were not well looked after, and so they decided to return to Jem, their mother’s home. For some strange reason, the Fon of N so seized them and entrusted them to the care of Shey Dzeni of Taba, where they were well received. An enduring quarrel arose between the Jem lineage head and the Fon on this account. While at Kumbo, Naa was caught up in the surging movement called “Christianity” and after due instruction she was baptised Agatha. The Boh people were so angry at her conversion that they disowned her and “burnt her bag” (a symbol of ostracism in N so culture). She resisted and kept her faith in Christianity, and so became an outcast to her Jem and Dzeng families, who could no longer control her and give her out in marriage according to custom. Thus liberated and assimilated into the Christian movement, she could, as was the practice, select a man of her choice within the Christian community. After an unsuccessful attempt with Mr Marcus of Ndzendzev - a relationship which brought forth her first daughter (now Mama Elizabeth Feter) Agatha married Mr Joseph Fonlon, probably in 1923. By November 1924, a son was born to them and was 3\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nnamed N sokika, becoming Bernard N sokika after his baptism in his parents’ religion. That is how N sokika became a Catholic. It was much later, in 1941-42, when Bernard N sokika, as he was commonly known in Nso society, enrolled in Christ the King’s College, Onitsha, that he was asked to answer to his father’s family name. And he became Bernard N sokika Fonlon, much later to be called, for short, Dr Fonlon. He had four other sisters: Agatha Ngwveh Kemjeei, Susanna Kongla (Mrs Ndzelen), Emerentia Fonlon and Mary Leeiyen (Mrs Fanka). 2 Early Years For his primary school, Bernard Nsokika attended the Native Administration! Authority (N .A.) school at Taa Bamfen. Kumbo, for one year and then in 1932 transferred to the Sacred Heart School, Shisong, about three kilometres from his mother’s compound in Kumbo town. From the early years he proved to be a brilliant pupil, so that when he completed Standard IV, the highest class then available in Shisong, he was one of the few to go to St Anthony’s School, Njinikom, where he completed Standards V and VI by 1940. By then he was 16 years old, a handsome son of Mama Agatha Naa, who was then one of the older members of the Christian Women’s Society called “Chong”, which met every Sunday in the mission compound at Mbivtinmbang to socialize, eat, drink their nkang (corn-brewed drink), dance and strengthen their solidarity and Christian moral force. Other influential women of this society were: Maria Bongayi (wife of Paul Tangwa), Rosina Kibong, Theresia Yikum of Dzeng, Monica Bati, Anna Langoiy, Maria Wirkpu and Angela Wirnsungrin. At Njinikom, Bernard Nsokika came under the influence of the Reverend Father Thomas Burke Kennedy, a proud 4\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

Dr Fonlon reported with affection that Fr Burke’s moral impact on him as his spiritual father (chaplain) was such that Dr Fonlon loved him till the end of his days. Till 1986 he even posted on his wall a newspaper cutting carrying Fr Burke’s photograph and announcing his death. Fr Burke found Nsokika to be intelligent, bright, honest and pious, and he advised him to aspire to the priesthood - a special privilege, because it was then seen to be exclusively a white missionary profession. It required more than average intelligence, hard work, obedience, a prayerful spirit, and willingness to sacrifice wealth and marriage to serve the Lord all through one’s life. Bernard Fonlon adapted his youthful life to denying much of the world and to trying to grow up according to the severe discipline of the priestly calling. On leaving Njinikom in 1939-40, he returned to Kumbo already different _ a potential seminarian. He was recruited by the Catholic Mission to teach in his Alma Mater, the Sacred Heart School at Shisong. There he taught Paul Verdzekov (now Archbishop of Bamenda), who remained a life-long friend. For his priestly drill he was assigned to catechise twice weekly at Kikai-kelaki, about eight kilometres from Shisong. There he taught young Christian Wiyghan Tumi, who is now the Archbishop of Garoua. He made the catechetical trips on foot and in the cold - a necessary toughening-up in the missionary spirit of self-sacrifice to preach the Good News. As well as this vocation, Bernard Fonlon loved music, and he always carried a flute which he blew at will on his way to school. In later years, I recall very well that he even acquired a mouth organ which he very much enjoyed. Because of his love of music, Teacher N sokika joined the Shisong School Band. I recollect vividly going down to the 5\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG.

There was teacher Vincent Lainjo marching in front with his curved stick, and there was Bernard N sokika in the ranks smiling and blowing his flute. The band was a beautiful glittering brass band with a bass drum, two side-drums, cymbals, triangles, 24 flutes, four bugles and four trombones, with smart band-boys marching in four rows to exciting music and wearing blue berets and red double sashes across their chests. It was said to be the special gift of Father Thomas Burke Kennedy, who had also been transferred to the Sacred Heart School. Thus Ben and his Irish mentor were again together! By 1941, Bernard Fonlon, with Maurice Mbu Bayena, had left for Christ the King’s College (CKC), Onitsha. Both combined their minor seminary studies and priestly training with their general education. Dr Fonlon often gleefully recounted their long trek through the countryside of the savage tribes of Ogoja land as an example of triumph in a dangerous adventure. Their vocation and departure were widely known in the Christian community they were the people’s hope. From 1941 to 1946 Bernard Fonlon quietly pursued his secondary education in Nigeria, which to ordinary N so folk was tantamount to being abroad. In 1946 he visited home briefly after leaving CKC with his Senior Cambridge in Grade I and Exemption from London Matriculation. His brief visit was like the passage of an angel. Christians were proud of him. At that time I was in Standard III, quite bright and alert. Bernard then went down to St Joseph’s College, Sasse, to teach, and then met Mr. Victor Anomah Ngu. They became good friends, and this friendship grew and blossomed until Bernard died in 1986. Each time Bernard came on holidays, 6\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

All rights reserved.\n\nhe spent a lot of time visiting Christian parents, especially the mothers who were friends of hi mother. In Nso land, where fathers are usually away from home children grow up mostly in the company of their mothers. M mother was one of those regularly visited. Apart from being very active members in the Christian Women’s Society and thereby knowing one another, my mother Catharine Yuwun and Agatha Naa both hailed from Dzeng village and recognized some kinship. In 1947, Bishop Peter Rogan, the Vicar Apostolic of Buea, permitted Bernard Fonlon to leave Sasse College and to join Aloysius B. Wankuy in the Major Seminary at Okpuala Owerrinta, Nigeria. He was in Okpuala for barely one year before the Major Seminary was transferred to the new centre at the Bigard Memorial Major Seminary, Enugu. There he continued his studies in Philosophy till 1950, when he came home on holiday. His success was evident in his confidence and determination to continue, and he was a great inspiration to many of us. The arrival of this son of Agatha Naa and Papa Joseph Fonlon was news in Kumbo town. If you wanted to see him, you had to attend morning Mass. During that holiday, we became firm friends, indeed brothers, never to separate. He was 26 years old, a philosopher and Seminarian, while I was just turning 17, a bright second-year student at St Joseph’s College, Sasse, a College Scholar with strong attachments to the Church. In my absence, Anthony Mapry, my friend and College mate in Sasse and a minor seminarian, would serve Bernard, cleaning his rooms and fetching food and water. Before long, I was familiar with Bernard’s simple and humble life style. Every night we had to read a chapter or two ofthe New Testament. Our conversation ranged from the everyday events of Kumbo town to school subjects such as geography and history; and we sometimes discussed the lives of the 7\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

All rights reserved.\n\nSaints, particularly the Doctors of the Church, St Augustine, St Thomas Aquinas, St Albertus Magnus and St Bonaventure. He told us about the Greek philosophers, Plato, Socrates and Aristotle. Living, moving and chatting with Bernard was like attending a roving university. When the holiday was half-spent, Bernard suggested that Mapry and I should spend the rest of it on a long journey that would take us to French Cameroon. We agreed with glee, particularly as he was to foot the bills. Our parents also agreed, so we prepared our luggage for the journey. We were told that at journey’s end we would not return to N so, but continue straight to Sasse College, while Bernard would go on to Enugu via Mamfe. The day of the journey finally arrived and we set out together in a lorry to Bamenda. Next day we started out early and reached Mamfe late at night. There we lodged with Mr and Mrs J .B. Chilla, N so people and Bernard’s good friends, for two days. Bernard was very watchful over us and always made sure that we had had enough to eat. Seeing that our baggage was giving way due to rough handling and the shaking of the lorry on rough roads, he admonished us as would-be travellers. He said, “When travelling, always buy a good rope and tie your things properly. If you economise and save on the rope, you may lose all your baggage and whatever little wealth there is in it. Always keep a spare rope when you go on long journeys.” I listened with keen attention and obeyed him, but my friend Mapry did not take heed. On the morrow, as we were hurrying to catch a vehicle bound for Kumba, Mapry’s luggage burst open and his small amount of garri poured onto the sandy road. The thin ties which he had mended and tied his box with had given way. ] ran to the front of the vehicle and reported that Mapry was having a problem with his 8\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nluggage and pleaded with the driver to stop jus for a few minutes. Bernard, who was sitting in the front seat, carrx down, walked to the rear of the lorry and saw Mary struggling to tie things together. For once Nsokika’s temper was stretched to the limit and he los it. He severely chided us, “You headstrong fellows! You won’ learn anything. How often do I tell you to do something and yo do the very opposite! Why do you sometimes behave like mules With this kind of behaviour we may as well call off our journey from the outset! French Cameroon is rather a risky place, and you can’t get away with this kind of stubbornness. I may reconsider and do the journey alone, and leave you dead weights at Kumba.” This was bad, and our kind master had been badly wronged! He had been proved right beyond all doubt. Mapry had saved three pence through economy or stinginess (or disobedience) and paid for it with the loss of his precious garri and beans in the Mamfe sands, besides courting his kind master’s anger and rage, the resultant show-down and his own depression. I joined in to help him put things together, but took the opportunity to chide him too, as I might lose the expected exciting journey. At last we managed to get on the hooting vehicle again, having lost the safety and peace of the more comfortable inner seats and now being forced to share the last boot rank with the wedge-heaver. In such discomfort we travelled the 120 miles to Kumba speechless, though my heart kept pleading that the kind master should rediscover his lost goodness, forgive us once again, and take us along with him to French Cameroon, particularly to Douala city, whose electric lights we had been viewing periodically from the Buea mountain slopes and Mutengene hills on clear, starry nights. At Kumba, we lodged at the police station with the Yubins. Next morning, we got up still panicky and set out to 9\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nget new strings or ropes to bind our fragile boxes. Bernard saw the renewed effort, forgave us, and procured the required Laissez-passer for us all to continue together. It was great joy, as we drove in a Kitcar past Mukonje-Laduma German plantation settlement and reached the River Mungo - the famous frontier river. Bernard cautioned us to take courage and cross in the pontoon without trepidation, for the hungry hippopotamus and man-eating fish would not spare any human flesh found in that dangerous river. And so we were emboldened to try, and we were soon across. The French customs were ready on the other side to search our thin luggage down to the last dirty sock, and to verify the validity of our Laissez-passer. This first assault over, we climbed slowly towards the Gare Mundeck. Fortunately, as we approached the station, the Nkongsamba - Douala passenger train could be heard puff-puffing in the distance; then the bells sounded and shrieking brakes were heard grinding on, and all passengers ahead of us began to scamper to find a place in any wagon as soon as it came to a stop. We followed suit, but following in the steps of our master. Soon we were in a Second Class compartment. Fierce-looking khaki-wearing men were soon round to check our tickets. We were now on our way to Douala, and Bernard told us a bit about the important stations we came across, such as Mbanga and Souza. At Bonaberi we were well received by the Nso community, and everyone sought to have us lodged in their house. Bernard decided that we should stay with elderly Mama Philomena, who had plenty of spare space, and there we took the opportunity of being initiated into the French language, thanks to the co-operation of young Henri, who was attending primary school and often did his homework, “dessin et calcul”, at home. We helped him to do his 10\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\narithmetic as well as teach him English, and he in tum taught us how to count in French and some French expressions of common usage. Occasionally we visited the Felix Miwayo (the famous tailor) family. At the first weekend, Papa Jacob Linjo, President of the Banana Association of Loum Paris, came down in a goods train with loads of bananas for shipment from the Bonaberi wharf. He was one of the elderly Nso men who had emigrated in the 20s and 30s, had settled down in French Cameroon and frenchified himself. He was happy to meet us at the Miwayo’s (Mrs Miwayo-Domtila was his first daughter). It was a big feast with Menjunga (red wine) flowing in abundance. Having ensured that we were well settled, the thoughtful Nsokika took leave of us and travelled alone in a risky engineboat up to Yabassi, where he spent a few days with his old friend Abbe Maurice Foungang. After Dr Fonlon’s death in 1986, I discovered old photographs of Father Maurice in a carefully labelled envelope in the flies. He too had died, I gather, in the Parish of New Bell (Douala) some years ago. Nsokika’s friends were friends forever. When he finally returned from Yabassi, he took us to see the Seat of Government in the Quartier Bonanjo of Douala city. And there we saw the Palais de Justice, the statue of General Le Clerc and the 1939-45 World War IT monuments, the giant Post Office and the Commissariat Central. From there we visited the Akwa Cathedral and drove to see Lagos market. We visited the Quartier Congo where dwelt the N so community, consisting of Mr Boniface Fonkika, a N so prince who was a professional blacksmith, Papa Philip Vidjim, the famous Djottin drummer and expert Mbaya dancer, Papa Leonard Veye of Mbingiy, and Mama Yekwa, my relative from my mother’s line, indeed her second cousin. Sylvester Kongnyuy and Cornelius Mantanin, our former primary schoolmates, had also recently 11\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nsettled here and were working at the Douala Quays. A memorable and happy reception was mounted for Nsokika and our humble selves. In the evening we returned to Bonaberi, crossed on a launch jammed with passengers. We had seen Douala; the wise N sokika had been kind enough to show us new lands and experiences and peoples. As he had always said, “We learn more from travel than by reading books.” We endorsed his wise saying. The day of the beginning of our return journey was on the morrow. We packed our paper boxes well, and secured them with new ropes. We said au revoir to all our newly acquired friends during the evening, as we had to leave early. Next morning we passed through a Librairie et Papeterie and Bernard spent some minutes looking for the Beginner’s French Grammar Book, by Dundo. As the stock was exhausted, he left some money there and requested the bookseller to order two copies from France and mail them direct to him at Bigard Memorial Seminary, Enugu. At that time we were told that one French Equatorial African franc was equivalent to two French francs. Bernard told us that he was determined to learn French on his own and that he would start as soon as the books arrived. He proposed to do that during his spare moments at the Seminary. The books eventually reached him and he did put them to good use, I was told years afterwards. This was an initiative which, as history later proved, made Nsokika a bridge-builder between two leaders, Mr John Ngu Foncha and Al Hadji Ahmadou Ahidjo, and two states, the English-speaking Southern Cameroons and the French-speaking Republic of Cameroun. In other words, this was the beginning of the construction of the vital channel for the Cameroon Reunification process: from 1961 to 1964 Bernard Fonlon was the direct medium of communication between President Ahidjo and the rest of the 12\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

Between 1951 and 1954 we corresponded often. Then a great and surprising event took place. My friend Bernard Fonlon was sent away from the Major Seminary. This was to me incredible. At one moment the scene of our visit to Simon Fuhnjem at Penja, during our holiday journey, came to mind, and I recalled the words of Bernard Fonlon himself: “The priestly vocation is a very risky affair. Many are called, but few are chosen.” It turned out that Bernard Fonlon’s apparently shocking send-down from the Seminary was perhaps more profoundly inspired by the deep wish and hope of the Seminary professors that the talent exhibited by this young man stood to serve the Church better from the lay Christian world than from the constrictions of the pulpit and altar. Bernard was not being excommunicated: the Church was rather enriching the lay front of evangelization by the service of a man of sound Christian philosophy and theology, for they knew that he was well trained and ever a priest at heart without the priestly robes. Indeed, he was so acclaimed posthumously and given the burial of a priest, thanks to the pronouncement of the Bishop of Kumbo, Dr Cornelius Fontem Esua. Bernard Fonlon accepted the new role that he had been destined to play in his society. He left it all in the hands of God. While at Onitsha, on Monday, 6 September, 1954, he wrote in his diary: When I look at my life, at the course it has taken, at the shaping it has received, I feel ... that, perhaps, I am headed for a share in the leadership of my people... These, therefore, are the hallmarks of leadership that I must bear, should that role fall to my lot, namely - Comprehensive Learning, Death to the World, Moral Energy, Love of my People, Economic 13\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nIndependence, Assiduous Industry, Concord with Co-Workers, Union with God. (Cameroon Panorama, 190, October 1977, pp. 22-23.) 3 Dr Bernard Goes to Europe for Further Studies As the Lord would have it, the former rector at the Minor Seminary in Christ the King’s College offered Bernard a Scholarship to study classics at Cork University, Ireland, on the condition that, on the completion of his studies, he would return to teach at CKC for at least three years. Whatever the terms, it was for Dr Fonlon a welcome opportunity to pursue further studies, something for which he thirsted to the marrow of his bones. By January, 1955, he was in Cork. In a letter to me he wrote:\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nThat I am in a University today is one of the most wonderful things of my life: to me it teaches one lesson that has been deep nto the substance of my soul: That God never let down those who put their trust in Him. (30 January) On 2 October of that year, Ben wrote again, this time from London, to congratulate me for success at the Ibadan Entrance Examination, in which he had encouraged me; and also to tell me that he had spent a good holiday attending a Summer University Course in France: “It was a most exciting experience; of course, everything was done in French. Next I came to England, and spent seven weeks working on the Isle of Wight to earn my keep. Finally, I came to London where I have been spending a very happy time with Layu and others.” He continued: Well Dan, this is a time for rejoicing so I will leave off preaching for next time. Yet son, there are just two things I’ll want you to bear in mind right from the start. No.1: Take your studies as it were by storm; 14\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nI have learnt from very personal experience that when you study like mad at the beginning of a course, the later work is made easier: try it and tell me a year or two after. No.2: In this hour of victory remember that humility is the only attitude that shall bring greater victories; don’t give it any chance to go to your head, and remember that this is not the end but the beginning of the end. From this date, Ben laid off correspondence for some time. In 1957 a Mr Bassey, a contemporary of Bernard Fonlon at Cork, visited Ibadan University and I happened to meet him by chance at a party. Hearing that I was a Cameroonian, he began to speak about a Bernard Fonlon who had made the Black race at Cork exceedingly proud and happy by his good academic performance. He said that Bernard was so good that he baffled all his teachers, and that at the B.A. Honours examination they were forced to award him the degree in the Upper Division of the Second Class, which is scarcely awarded even to their own brilliant sons. Bernard’s professors were so pleased with him that they invited him to do a Master’s degree. A year and a half later he passed it with First Class Honours. He was then again invited by his professors to pursue the Ph.D. degree of the National University of Ireland (Cork). During this programme, he also completed a Diploma in Education at Oxford University and studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. However, he returned to Ireland to write up his Ph.D. thesis. He was not called upon to defend it, and upon submission he was simply asked to leave his home address and go home. This was in January, 1961. Writing about Bernard Fonlon in 1970, Professor William McCausland Stewart, M.A., D.Litt., Professor of Literature at Bristol University, England, said: 15\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

He held his peace and continued to work silently in the Office of the then Prime Minister (Dr John Ngu Foncha) while waiting for the results of his Ph.D. thesis. Later he was raised to the rank of Assistant Administrative Officer, Those were difficult times, a transitional period demanding the spirit of willingness to 16\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

All rights reserved.\n\nserve with dedication, and top intellectuals were often suspected of communism and vilified. Bernard Fonlon was a victim of such gossip. During the days following the plebiscite, I came home from Ibadan University. Rev. Father Ivo Ndichida had informed me by letter that Bernard Fonlon had returned to Cameroon, so I hurried down to Buea to meet him. It was then exactly ten years since we had parted at Kumba after the Douala journey. Our meeting was a joyful one. We discussed at length such a wide range of issues and subjects that we often stayed up till the small hours of the morning. Yet, though the share of the discipline was his, we would end the talks with the holy rosary. I accompanied him to his office once and never went again, for it was embarrassing to witness that his daily assignment was to read French papers, extract news and summarise it for the bosses in the Prime Minister’s Office. After work, we would go out together and visit his only friends, Mrs Prudencia He-en Chilla and Mrs Paddy Epie, the beautiful Irish widow of the late Epie. One day, Bernard Fonlon showed me a letter sent by airmail from Ireland. It simply stated: “I am pleased to inform you that your doctoral thesis has been examined and accepted by the jury and the Senate has conferred on you the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Signed (Registrar).” Dr Bernard Fonlon was profoundly pleased and proud of his success, but in his usual manner he kept quiet and made no fuss about it. He told only very few friends. Eventually the news spread, however, and several people came to behold and congratulate this first Cameroonian holder of a Ph.D. At this time, there was a need to prepare a common national anthem for the imminent Federal Republic of Cameroon, and the task was assigned to Dr Fonlon, the only 17\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nperfectly bilingual English-speaking Cameroonian at Buea. He worked with Mr Manfred Epoh, the first Federal Administrator for West Cameroon, who was of Douala origin and, though a francophone, read English very well and spoke Pidgin eloquently. They had copies of the French version of the old anthem which needed to be revised and then rendered in English and French. The final versions would have to be approved by the respective Cameroon Houses of Assembly (East and West) and then presented at the Foumban Constitutional Conference (17-21 July, 1961) for ratification and inclusion in the Revised Constitution before the historic Reunification Day of 1 October, 1961.\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nThis delicate task called for the complete commitment of a citizen who knew and loved his country.’ Dr Bernard Fonlon proved himself to be the right man at the right time, polishing and perfecting the English version. Some expatriate Englishmen in the Buea administration produced literal translations for an open and fair competition, but Dr Fonlon’s version so outclassed these that only his was adopted, debated and approved by the Southern Cameroons Assembly without an alteration in word or punctuation. This is the Cameroon National Anthem as Dr Bernard Fonlon, the seasoned poet, rendered it. O Cameroon, thou Cradle of our fathers, Holy Shrine where in our midst they now repose, Their tears and blood and sweat thy soil did water, On thy hills and valleys once their tillage rose. Dear fatherland, thy worth no tongue can tell! How can we ever pay thy due, Thy welfare we will win in toil and LOVE AND PEACE, will be to thy name ever true! 18\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

Instil in them the love of gentle ways, Regret for errors of the past; Foster, for Mother Africa a loyalty That true shall remain to the last.3 This work has stood the test of time, carrying the profound and genuine aspirations of Cameroonian nationhood in a style that is as new today as it ever was a quarter of a century ago. Dr Fonlon made his first major contribution to Cameroon nation building in the following way. During the Foumban Constitutional Conference, the problem of questionable interpretation and communication arose, and both President A. Ahidjo and Dr J.N. Foncha were notified. William Eteki Mbomoua, a contemporary of Dr Fonlon in Paris, indicated Dr Fonlon’ s bilingual abilities to President Ahidjo, who summoned him urgently, interviewed him and requested that he take over the interpreting. Dr Foncha was in full agreement. Dr Fonlon dutifully accepted and did a good job to the satisfaction of all parties. The constitution of the Federal Republic of Cameroon was signed in Yaoundé on 19\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\n1 September, 1961. From then on, during the various preliminary meetings in preparation for the 1 October Reunification event, Dr Fonlon served as interpreter and translator. He was thus playing the role of bridge-builder between the two major cultural groups. Afterwards, the President summoned Dr Fonlon to Yaounde and appointed him as his first Cameroonian Chief of Mission, responsible for the Translation Service at the Presidency of the Federal Republic of Cameroon. Sounding out Dr Fonlon and finding him to be a man of great trust, a simple, honest and loyal yet talented man, President Ahidjo (a ruler of very sound common sense and intuition) not only offered him a public office but assimilated him into his own personal family. They remained intimate friends ever after. To ensure that Dr Fonlon’s status was secure, the President advised him to enrol in the Professional Corps of the Civil Service. So by 1962, when the Federal University of Cameroon, Yaounde, was established, Dr Fonlon was one of the first to be recruited as Associate Professor (Maitre de Conference), a rank merited because of his Doctorate. Having moved to Yaoundé for good, having quickly adapted and settled down, and having the privilege of being involved in shaping state matters of the highest concern to present and future generations, Dr Fonlon addressed the West Cameroonians in his powerful foreword to the Statement on General Policy to the Ebolowa Congress of the Union Camerounaise by the President General, His Excellency Ahmadou Ahidjo, President of the Federal Republic of Cameroon, 4-8 July, 1962. In a forceful appeal to his countrymen, he maintained that “decolonisation and nation building are a Herculean task.” (p. xii) The lion was now unleashed and began to charge and roar. Perhaps the Professors who had released 20\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nBernard from the priestly bonds were right. Bernard N sokika Fonlon had thus come of age, had begun his public mission, and soon emerged as a public figure on the Cameroon political scene. 5 Conclusion This outline of the man Fonlon in his formative days reveals a powerful personality developing his skills to emerge in the fullness of time as a multi-talented adult with special gifts to put at the service of his people. We have no doubt about his Cameroonian roots, his upbringing and profound Christian commitment from extreme youth, his intellectual brilliance and lofty academic credentials, his wide cultural exposure in Africa and Europe, his unusual devotion and dedication to work, his priestly training which moulded him into a philosopher and theologian, his love of music, poetry and the classical arts, his thorough grounding in Latin and ancient classics, his early commitment and preparation as a teacher, his mastery of the French language with the aim of being truly bilingual, and his profound love and loyalty to his friends. Much as he was talented, was he not equally virtuous because of his warmth and humanity, his shunning of wealth and adoption of poverty as a way of life, his simplicity, frankness, boldness and extreme humility, his love and perpetual disposition to serve others? And more epithets could still be proffered of this saintly celibate. Bernard Fenlon was already 38 years old by 1962, a welleducated and polished intellectual of high integrity, prepared to serve his country and mankind, and he used whatever opportunity came his way to teach and to serve. When he passed away, it was rightly said that Dr Fonlon came to this world apparently with a mission whose attainment remained his perpetual concern; he was well schooled for it and he fulfilled his calling.

The man who, more than anybody else, aroused that aspiration in Bernard’s heart, in the middle of the 1930s, was an Irish Mill Hill missionary, Father Thomas Burke Kennedy. As Bernard himself testifies, “It was from him [Father Burke Kennedy] that I really first began to admire the Roman Catholic Priesthood, and to aspire after it. He was largely responsible for my endeavour to achieve that goal; an effort which took fifteen years, of labour and study. I failed.” l In January 1948, at the age of 23, Bernard entered St Paul’s Major Seminary, Okpuala, Nigeria, to commence the seven-year course of Higher Studies for the Catholic Priesthood. The first three years were given over completely to an intensive and extensive study of Philosophy. As defined in Charles Boyer’s Cursus Philosophiae ad Usum Seminariorum, which Bernard was to cherish and to carry about with him for the rest of his life, philosophy is said to be the “Scientia rerum per ultimas causas naturali rationis lumine comparata”. It is a knowledge of things that exist, grasped either directly or through an analysis and demonstration of their ultimate causes, knowledge that is attained through human reason alone. In the History of Philosophy, Bernard was guided to 28\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nmake a critical study of the formation and development of philosophy and its associated concepts from their first ascertainable appearance to the present time. This study was far from being a mere account or presentation of what philosophers have said in the course of history. Rather it was a study carried out in such a way that by “coming to grasp the basic principles of the various [philosophical] systems, students will hold what is shown to be true among them, and be able to detect the roots of errors and disprove them”.2 In Systematic Philosophy, Bernard’s studies followed the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition. These studies, “based on a philosophical heritage which is perennially valid”,3 engage the student in an intense effort to gain an insight into the nature of reality by induction from the facts of experience. The content of Scholastic Philosophy comprises several sciences: Logic, Cosmology and Psychology; Ethics or Moral Philosophy; and Metaphysics. It seems that it was metaphysics, the philosophical science having as its object Being as being, which had the most profound influence on Bernard’s life and work. So thoroughly did he absorb and assimilate this discipline, and so profoundly was his mind shaped by its principles, that he was able to apply to the commonest everyday problems, with admirable clarity of exposition and cogency of argument, such metaphysical principles and notions as Act and Potency, the Transcendentals (Unum, Verum, Bonum and Pulchrum), the Categories of Aristotle, and Causality. In Bernard’s own words: It is Metaphysics that is Philosophy in the strictest sense of the term. Philosophy, therefore, is the science of Being as being, the science which treats of the principles and causes and qualities, inherent in all things, whatever they may be, merely from this alone that they are, that they 29\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nexist. Since Being is the final, most universal property of things, it follows, consequently, that philosophy is the science which concerns itself with the final, ultimate, most universal, all-embracing, principles or causes of the total Universe.4\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nThe study of Metaphysics enabled Bernard to understand that the human mind is capable of discovering, by means of a realistic ontology, transcendental values and ends, and that it can arrive at an affirmation of a personal Absolute and Creator of the Universe. The purpose of these philosophical studies was to equip the future priest with the intellectual tools and principles with which to grapple with those fundamental problems that confront mankind in every age: the meaning of life and death; the meaning of good and evil; the basis of true values; the dignity and rights of the human person; the confrontation between culture and a spiritual heritage; the scandal of suffering, injustice, oppression and violence; the nature and law of love; the order and disorder in nature; the problems of education, authority and freedom; the meaning of history and progress; the mystery of the transcendant; and finally, at the depth of all these problems, God, His existence, His personal characteristics and His providence. . . . Such questions as these pertain to the specific sphere of philosophy, which, transcending all merely exterior and partial aspects of phenomena, addresses itself to the whole of reality, seeking to comprehend and to explain it in the light of ultimate causes.S I am persuaded that Bernard’s life and work, his view of reality and personal attitude to life, cannot be properly understood without an awareness of the philosophical studies that he pursued between January 1948 and December 1950. Philosophy, coupled with the theological studies in which he 30\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nwas deeply engaged for a further three years, gave his mind, as he himself testifies, “a turn and bent and discipline which few other studies are able to instil.” 2 Public life In November, 1953, Bernard went through the greatest crisis of his life. On the threshhold of Major Orders, and only six or eight months to the fmal goal of Priesthood, he was asked to leave the Seminary. The palm of victory eluded him, forever, at the very moment when he thought it was within his grasp. But it was without any rancour or bitterness that he left the Seminary. The next obvious thing for him was to find out what to do with his life. On Monday, 6 September, 1954, nine months after leaving the Seminary, he noted in his diary that perhaps he was headed for a share in the leadership of the people of Cameroon. If that were to be the case, he noted, then he must strive to acquire the qualities that he listed as: Comprehensive Learning, Death to the World, Moral Energy, Love of People, Economic Independence, Assiduous Industry, Concord with Co-workers, and Union with God. The following month, he was admitted to University College, Cork, at the beginning of a long university career that took him from the National University of Ireland to the Sorbonne in Paris and to the University of Oxford. Those were the years during which Cameroonians were agitating for Reunification, and Bernard’s chief obsession “was on getting myself as good and as thorough a training as I could, in order to help in building the re-united country - if it came”. That in fact was the advice which his Spiritual Director, Father Thomas Ronayne, C.S.Sp., gave him on the day he left the Seminary: “Get yourself an education such that when you speak, people will listen.” Very soon after his return home in 1961, Bernard was in 31\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nfact called upon to participate in the leadership of the emerging nation. He served successively as Charge de Mission in the President’s Office, Member of the Federal Parliament, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Transport, Post and Telecommunications, and finally as Minister of Health. Until his death, he was a member of the Central Committee of the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement, the nation’s only political party. In his role as a leader and as a public servant, Bernard, who was no ivory tower intellectual, never failed to recognise the value of technical competence and empirical accuracy in issues of public policy. Quite evidently, these are prerequisites for the formulation and execution of just and effective decisions in the life of a nation. But he argued, in season and out of season, that technical competence and empirical accuracy are not enough. Moral judgement, based upon sound philosophy, is an essential element. The formulation of laws, the elaboration of social reforms, and many political and economic decisions “carry within themselves philosophical pre-suppositions and consequences which need to be clearly and critically evaluated...”6 Since political and economic decisions affect human beings, those issues must also be seen as moral issues, whose adequate solution cannot exclude the philosophical values that are inherent in them. Consequently, Bernard argued that public policy cannot be left to technicians alone, or to special interest groups. In the Government Ministries entrusted to him, he endeavoured to prove that “even Politics and Government can be philosophical, that administration is best when it is subject to reason and principle and not when it is based on scheming and expediency.” To bring home to his fellow Cameroonians the truth of the fact that a sound philosophical approach is needed in the running of public\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\n.\n\n32\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\naffairs, Bernard frequently quoted Plato’s dictum that either philosophers must be kings or kings philosophers:\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nUnless, philosophers bear kingly rule in cities, or those who are now called kings and princes become genuine and adequate philosophers, and political power and philosophy are brought together, and unless the numerous natures who at present pursue either politics or philosophy, the one to the exclusion of the other, are forcibly debarred from this behaviour, there will be no respite from evil, my dear Glaucon, for cities, nor, I fancy, for humanity. 7 3 Concrete Examples One or two examples might help to illustrate how Bernard constantly brought his philosophical studies to bear upon the search for solutions to issues of public policy and welfare. In 1964, the transitional period of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Cameroon was drawing to a close. “The top leaders of the Kamerun National Democratic Party (KNDP) were undergoing pressure from their followers and West Cameroon intellectuals to define a set of goals not only for the West Cameroon regime, but for the whole country”. 8 It was in response to the questions raised by those who were “dissatisfied with the seeming lack of direction and influence of the Buea regime in national politics” that Bernard drew up a document entitled Presentation of the KNDP Memorandum of 1st August 1964.9 This document, though ultimately rejected, is an illustration of how the metaphysical principles of causality could be applied to the problems facing the KNDP in its relation to the other main political party, the Union Camerounaise (UC). The absence of proper discussion and agreement, Bernard maintained, would lead to confusion or imbalance. The particular purpose was the welding into unity of the 33\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\npeoples and cultures of Cameroon, thus giving the country the role of pilot in the struggle for African unity. The material cause was concrete (the two entities, East and West Cameroon, with their populations and resources) and spiritual (the principal cultures that had met in the Federation). The formal cause, that is, the form and shape that the makers chose to give to the matter in hand, was to be the Constitution of the Federation. “Arbitrary absorption has been declared anathema. We have decided that whatever is true and good and beautiful shall live and move and have its being and work in concert with the rest within this federal framework. We have chosen Diversity in Unity, Unity in Diversity.” At the end of these philosophical considerations, Bernard drew from them six precise practical proposals clearly stating the aims of the KNDP. The main claims revolved around the questions of institutionalised discussion, negotiation and agreement between the two parties in the Government Coalition. In addition, since the transitional period of the Federal Constitution was coming to a close, one proposal called for the revision of that constitution to provide for a Council of Ministers in which all Government projects would be freely, frankly and fully debated before their adoption by the Head of State or by the Government. If, in the task of nation-building, he concluded, the inherent laws addressed to all builders in the Sermon on the Mount were observed, the UC-KNDP Coalition would be: like a wise man who built his house upon a rock; and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house but it did not fall; for it was founded upon a rock. However, all these proposals came to nought, for they 34\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nwere rejected outright by the Union Camerounaise. In 1966, Bernard wrote “The Task of Today”, a serial which appeared in the Cameroon Times newspaper. Drawing upon the accumulated wisdom of thinkers, ancient and modem, and upon his own studies, he explored such topics as the objectives that should be pursued by the Government of the then Federated State of West Cameroon, the meaning of Democracy, of Right, Equality and Liberty, the meaning of full, free and frank debate, the meaning of the Separation of Powers, and, finally, the meaning and need for Compromise in the conduct of public affairs. If this article was read with avidity and universal enthusiasm by the Cameroon public, it was because Bernard had the rare knack of putting his principles into clear language, and making their relevance and practical application to our political, economic and social situation very plain for all to see. It was Bernard’s firm conviction, a conviction that he strove to put into practice in his own life, that the thinkerscholar should participate in public affairs and that, in so doing, he should endeavour to be the Keeper of the Public Conscience. To fulfil such a lofty role, the thinker-scholar would have to be integer vitae scelerisque purus - pure of life and free from sin (Horace) - and, at the same time, should be fearless, like Socrates, never betraying truth, goodness and justice for any reason whatsoever. That was the role that Bernard endeavoured to play in Government and in the Central Committee of the Cameroon National Union (CNU), later the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM). As can be expected, not everyone agreed with the principles for which he stood, and which he continued to proclaim, welcome or unwelcome, until his death. Writing about Bernard’s role in the Central Committee of the CNU, an informed observer commented: 35\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

All rights reserved.\n\nAn entry in Bernard’s Diary for 14 November, 1953, shows that he had trained himself to face such reactions. He resolved to follow the noble lead of Abraham Lincoln who, having been called “a damned fool” by Stanton, his Secretary for War, for signing a certain order, replied with great composure: “If Stanton says that I am a damned fool, then I must be, for he is nearly always right.” Elsewhere, Bernard maintained that “those who mock me, those who make me hang my head in shame, those who slash me with pen and tongue, those who see no good in what I do, shall be . counted my best benefactors; they are offering me invaluable chances for the growth of my soul” (Diary, 8 December, 1952). 4 Philosophy and University Studies About October, 1971, Bernard was dismissed from the Government. He then returned, as he put it, no doubt paraphrasing his revered master, Cardinal Newman, “to the peaceful groves of academe”. Four years earlier, on 1 0 December 1967, Bernard had given an important Address to the Association of Christian Students of the University of Yaounde on the participation of Christian students in national development. He used the occasion to argue forcefully in favour of the prominence of 36\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nPhilosophy in university studies. The university, according to Newman, should be:\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\na sort of ideal land, where the archetypes of the great and the fair are found in substantial being, and all departments of truth are explored, and all diversities of intellectual power exhibited, where taste and philosophy are majestically enthroned as in a royal court, where there is no sovereignty but that of mind, and no nobility but that of genius, where professors are rulers and princes do homage.12 The participation of Christian university students in national development, he maintained, consists in preparing themselves for their future role in the nation. The acquisition of solid competence in one’s specific area of studies must be combined with a scientific and philosophical spirit. In order to make a genuine contribution to national development, however, the university formation of the Christian student must include an equally intense moral education, because the most highly qualified expert who lacks a sense of duty will be an obstacle rather than a promoter of national development. These ideas were expanded in a major study, To Every African Freshman or The Nature, End and purpose of University Studies, a work carried out over nearly five years, 1965-69. If life were not so brief, he argued, or the period for study not so short, the ideal would be that all university education would include a thorough study of the philosophical disciplines. Since such an approach is impossible, the next best thing is that training in each science should include the branch of philosophy on which that science is based, or which has a particular relevance to it. Thus, for example, the study of Moral Philosophy or Ethics would provide a firm foundation for disciplines such as Law or Political Science. In 1979, this issue was taken up again in a study entitled, To 37\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nEvery African Freshman Ten Years After: An Academic Testament (Abbia, 34-35-36-37, June 1979). There the author reiterated his conviction that “if the University does not teach a student to think, it has taught him nothing of genuine worth, has failed wide of its mark.” Without denying the merits of the case so strongly made by Professor Fonlon, one may ask whether he sufficiently addressed some of the difficulties in the way of his programme. The modern tendency to reduce homo sapiens to homo faber, and all knowledge to the methods of the positive sciences; the complex and contradictory nature of philosophical pluralism that makes synthesis for the benefit of students extremely difficult; and the cultural climate which attunes the young more to images than reflection 13 all stand in the way. However, in the Department of African Literature of the University of Yaounde, Bernard made certain that his students did not overlook the philosophical aspects of their chosen discipline, in particular the qualities that confer beauty on a piece of literature, “the Beautiful being one of the expressions, or one of the Metaphysical properties of being. “ Both in Government and in the University, Bernard made it very plain that while he was a convinced votary of Secularity, he was an implacable foe of Secularism. Secularity means that the Church, or organised religion, keeps out of the exercise of temporal power, while the State for its part respects the independence of the Church and refrains from any interference in her life. As Pope John Paul II declared at the Unity Palace, Yaounde, on Monday 12 August, 1985, the Church “desires that its religious purpose, methods and doctrine - which is a message of spiritual life before entailing the consequence of morality - be not confused with those of the State. It always remains free in its judgement on moral 38\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nrealities.” Secularity therefore also means that there is no “State Religion”, that the State does not favour one religion to the detriment of others, but promotes the common good by assuring, in an impartial manner, and for all the citizens, the social conditions for the full exercise of religious freedom. Secularism, in contrast, is a philosophy or attitude which, both in theory and in practice, rejects faith and all that proceeds therefrom. Its purpose is the complete unhallowing of life and of the world, the elimination of any manifestation of religious faith in public and social life, and its relegation “to the sacristy”. It is a philosophy that Bernard rejected completely. It deeply saddened and alarmed him to notice how secularistic tendencies were making steady inroads into Cameroonian society, especially “education policies which not only ignore, or flout” the primacy of Morality and of Religious Studies at all levels of Education, but which even have the insolence to jeer at the idea of granting a place to such studies in the educational system. In his last article published in Abbia in May, 1982, four years and three months before his death, Bernard denounced one of the aspects of secularism thus: If anyone in charge of education, forgetful of Sophocles’ warning that Of happiness the crown And chiefest part is wisdom And to hold the gods in awe. shall declare that no certificate, diploma or degree gained in religious studies of Coran or Bible or Tradition (supreme studies) shall be recognized by the state under the misguided and spurious argument that the state is lay.forgetfui of this that a lay state is not an atheist state, let him be anathema. For, he inculcates into the minds of the young that, if 39\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nreligion counts for nothing in their studies, it counts for nothing in their lives - an extremely dangerous mentality that spells the bane of the Republic, the woe of the Commonwealth, the doom of the Common-weal.\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\n5 Spirituality I believe many of his past students would readily agree that Bernard succeeded in operating a solid synthesis between his intellectual and spiritual life. He was a believer in God, and would have shrunk back in horror at any suggestion that he should ever put his Catholic faith in a separate compartment of his life. The principles of Moral Philosophy (Ethics) which maintain that man’s Summum Bonum, or highest good, consists in happiness, and that this happiness consists in God alone, made a very deep and lasting impression on Professor Fonlon. From his Major Seminary days until his death, the conviction that Summum Bonum is God, and God alone, exercised the most powerful grip on his mind and heart, and manifested itself in every aspect of his life, even in the smallest details. St Augustine’s celebrated saying on this point was ever on his lips, and he quoted it countless times in his writings: Fecisti nos ad te, Domine, et inquietum est cor nostrum donee requiescat in teo (Thou hast made us for Thyself, 0 Lord, and our hearts are restless until they restin Thee.) In addition to the Word of God, the Sacraments and Prayer as the obligatory means of attaining union with God, Bernard considered the study of the lives of saintly men, and the imitation of their example, as one of the best means to make progress in virtue. Such lives, he wrote, must become 40\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nthe warp and woof of his daily thoughts, and the subject of constant study and perennial meditation; they must grip his mind so that whenever an occasion arose for the practice of these virtues, he would naturally and spontaneously do so. The Great Lives which he chose as the special models for his own spiritual life were those of S t Augustine, John Henry Cardinal Newman and the Mahatma Gandhi. For a Catholic such as Bernard was, the choice of St Augustine and Cardinal Newman can be taken as normal. What probably needs explanation is the inclusion of Gandhi, a Hindu. An entry in his Diary (20 February, 1953) gives an idea: I take a deep interest in the lives of great men, and this has sometimes been frowned upon, when the heroes were not saints in the Church’s sense. Once, during my Philosophy Course, I had to read a paper before the class in which paper I discussed, according to the philosophical principles of the beautiful, a character, a personality, which I considered sublime. I shall not forget the reaction of the class and of the professor, when I announced that I had chosen, as my hero, the celebrated Indian leader, Mahatma Gandhi. The fellows looked up surprised, almost stunned; and the professor wore a disapproving pout. But, before I was halfway through, it was evident that their sentiments were completely changed; and, when I finished reading, the professor remarked, “I have learned something today.” What Bernard admired most in the Mahatma was his austere asceticism, his life of poverty, and, in particular, his “influence” in the sense in which Newman uses that word. It was a great joy to him to learn that Pope John Paul IT began his Pastoral Visit to India in February, 1986, with a pilgrimage to Raj Ghat, dedicated to the illustrious Mahatma Gandhi, a man of God who manifested in his life the sublime teachings 41\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nof the Sermon on the Mount. In the early 1950s, while looking forward to his expected ordination which never came, Bernard adopted and recorded in his Diary certain laws and guidelines for his spiritual life. These were laws of simplicity of lifestyle, of ruthless detachment from wealth, ease and pleasure, of drastic discipline of the appetites, of kindness, of humility and acceptance of humiliations, of submission to God’s will, and of self-effacement. Those who knew him at close hand can testify that he held on to those principles and truly lived them for the rest of his life. I am persuaded that one of Bernard’s deep spiritual qualities lies in the manner in which he took his dismissal from the Seminary, an experience that brought him close to a nervous breakdown. On that occasion, he wrote in his Diary (27 November, 1953): The things that are happening to me, at present, are making one idea clearer and clearer to my mind,from day to day - the immense value of humiliation. A man left to himself - with everything as his heart desires, with success wherever he puts his hand - will end up in pride as surely as a bubble swells and rises; and rises but to burst; for, when a man gets drunk with a sense of his own importance, his fall is inevitable; and the higher he has risen, the greater the force with which he comes crashing to the ground. Humiliation brings you down on your knees. brings you back to yourself. and deflates you like men deflate a balloon: you see your own misery; and it dawns upon you that you are nothing; and. if you respond to the touch of grace. and bow under your humiliation in silence and gratitude; it is then you will hear the voice of God. Moved by these thoughts, I submit myself wholeheartedly to my present lot. Indeed. it is with sentiments of deep gratitude that I do so. 42\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

I will feel like dancing in the very street. that I had the experience I am going through today. And being so certain of this. I hasten to give thanks in the very throes of my agony; I hasten to give thanks to God before the benefits arrive.\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nBernard was the first to recognize that Father James O’Neil, C.S.Sp., the ReclOr who dismissed him. acted with the utmost sincerity. Coram Domino. Utissima conscientia. His esteem and affection for Father O’Neill never once foundered or wavered. And after Father O’Neill’s death, Bemard mourned him with unalloyed piety, writing in his memory a poem entitled “Larnent for Jaroes O’Neill”, full of sincere love for his fonner teacher and Rector. 6 Formation of Future Priests Bemard’s dismissal from the SeminarY in no way diminished his deep attachment 10 the ideals of the Catholic Priesthoood, for whose attainment he had consecrated so many years of his youth. His interest in Seminary Studies remained as keen as ever, and he never lost a chance of encouraging young Seminarians 10 strive 10 reach that sublime goal which he himself had failed to attain. When he learnt that the Bishops of Buea and Baroenda had obtained the authorisation of the Holy See to erect a Major Seminary at Bambui, Bernard felt that it was his sacred duty to make a contribution. This took the form of an Open Letter to the Bishops of Buea and Bamenda (16 September, 1973). He was persuaded that his right and duty were full justified by the following words of the Second Vatican Council: An individual layman, by reason of the knowledge, competence, or outstanding ability which he may enjoy, is permitted and sometimes even obliged to express his opinion on things which concern the good of the 43\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

Let it always be done in truth, in courage, and in prudence, with reverence and charity toward those who by reason of their sacred office represent the person ofChrist.14 In his Open Letter, Bernard pleaded for two essential qualities in all those who would pass through the new Major Seminary, namely saintliness and learning. As to the first requirement, saintliness, he argued forcefully for discipline and poverty in the life of every priest:\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nIn a world that is rank and rotten with materialism, when hedonism is the principal philosophy, where luxury is the summum bonum; there is the crying need for dedicated souls who would go to the other extreme and espouse the spirit of genuine religion, th spirit of poverty, the spirit of austere abstemiousness, in order t wage war against the onslaught of materialist godlessness. For this, one thing is absolutely necessary – Discipline; discipline of the mind, discipline of the heart, discipline of the will discipline not imposed from without by fear, but a free and willit discipline, welling from within, stemming from deep a, unshakable convictions! Coming from Bernard, these ideas carried enormous weight, since he was already considered, in his own right, the very epitome of discipline, self-restraint and abstemiousness. As to the second requirement, learning, Bernard argued that the motto of the Seminary, as regards philosophical and theological studies, should be a single word: “Thorough; no superficiality should be given quarter.” The Open Letter generated heated discussion in the Church and in society at large; it evoked wide interest and controversy far beyond the borders of Cameroon. Reactions, some laudatory, others critical, poured in to Cameroon 44\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\nCopyright © 2010. Langaa RPCIG. All rights reserved.\n\nPanorama (Buea), the magazine that had published the Letter. No one remained indifferent. Laudatory comments came from Bishops in Cameroon and Nigeria. The five Bishops of the Governing Board of the Major Seminary of Peramiho (Tanzania) expressed complete agreement with the essential contents of the Open Letter, and asked for more copies for their Clergy and Seminarians. TheRector of the Pontifical College of St Peter me Apostle in Rome, Father Mathias Schneider, S.V.D., declared that there was a lot in the letter “which should be listened to by rectors of Seminaries or by Bishops of other countries”. Favourable and sometimes critical comments came from the University of Lagos, Nigeria; from St Joseph’s College, Mill Hill, London; from the Benedictine Monastery of Mount Febe, Yaounde; and from the then rector of the Major Seminary, Bambui, Dr Christian Wiyghan Tumi, now Archbishop of Garoua. Few challenged Bernard’s credentials for expressing his mind on the subject, though there was no lack of those who challenged the right of the Laity to make such an address. However, it is no exaggeration to say that the Open Letter is a document of priceless and perennial value, one that can always be profitably consulted by those who have responsibility for the formation of the future priests of Cameroon. 7 Culture As everyone knows, Professor Fonlon was one of the founders of Abbia, the Cameroon Cultural Review, whose maiden issue appeared in 1963. He was the first Director of the prestigious review, and held the position until his death. To his role as Director of Abbia, as to everything else, Bernard brought the principles of philosophy that had moulded his entire life. This is clearly illustrated in the six45\n\nLyonga, Nalova. Socrates in Cameroon : The Life and Works of Bernard Nsokika Fonlon, Langaa RPCIG,\n\npage” A Word of Introduction” in the first issue (pp. 19-24), where he spelled out with remarkable simplicity the philosophical principles that should constitute the guiding star of the Review: Were I asked to suggest a motto for this Review, to lay down the principles that should guide those who undertake to contribute to its columns, I would have no hesitation whatsoever; I have already made these principles the burden of this article, namely, the transcendental principles of being: Verum, Bonum, pulchrum . the True, the Good and the Beautiful.\n\nCopyright © 2010.

The purpose of Culture, Bernard maintained, was to help man to achieve the fullness of his being and thereby real happiness. The genuine seeker after the true, the good and the beautiful, which together make up a people’s culture, will probably arrive ultimately at an acknowledgement of Him who is Truth, Goodness an Beauty. Bernard’s understanding of Beauty was essentially that ( the philosopher St Augustine, who finally discovered the meaningof the beautiful things of this world: Ea me tenebant longe a te, quae si in te non essent. Vocasti et clamasti et rupisti surditatem meam; coruscasti, splenduisti et fugasti caecitatem meam ... (The beautiful things of this world kept me far from you and yet, if they had not been in you, they would have had no being at all. You called me; you cried aloud to me; you broke my barrier of 15 deafness ...) 46\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

Cultural rehabilitation, he said, should steer clear of two extremes: “on the one hand, the imperialist arrogance which declared everything African as only fit for the scrap-heap and the dust-bin, and, on the other hand, the overly enthusiastic and rather naive tendency to laud every aspect of African culture as if it were the quintessence of human achievement.” He felt that the Sequence of the Mass in the Catholic Liturgy for Pentecost Sunday aptly expresses what our policy should be:\n\nCopyright © 2010.

(Cleanse the sordid, water the arid, heal the wounded; render the rigid pliant, make the frigid warm, and the crooked straight.) On Tuesday, 13 August, 1985, just one year before his death, Bernard listened, with consummate joy and delight, to the Address which Pope John Paul II delivered to Cameroon’s intellectuals, university teachers and students at Yaounde, an address in which the Pontiff stressed the supreme importance of Philosophy in all university studies, and at the same time called upon Christian intellectuals to make their own contribution towards the urgent and necessary task of the “inculturation” of Christianity in Cameroon. Bernard was extremely happy and grateful to hear the Supreme Pontiff underscoring, on Cameroon soil and to the nation’s elite, the cherished ideas that he had been 47\n\nLyonga, Nalova.

What is the truth about death, judgement, and retribution beyond the grave? What, finally, is the ultimate and unutterable mystery which engulfs our beinr, and whence we take our rise, and whither our journey leads us?” Bernard, too, often thought about these questions. It is with his attempt to answer them, an attempt which sums up his philosophy of human life, that we shall conclude. At Enugu, on Friday, I0 July, 1953, looking ahead to his own death, Bernard made"
