The SCIAMA supercomputer is at the heart of the University of Portsmouth’s Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (ICG) – a research institute devoted to cosmology, galaxy evolution and gravitation.

SCIAMA is a High Performance Compute Cluster (HPCC) which is supported by ICG, SEPnet and the University of Portsmouth. It was built in 2011 to provide computational resources for scientific research carried out at the ICG. The supercomputer was named after Dennis Sciama, a leading figure in the development of astrophysics and cosmology, but it's also an acronym that stands for SEPnet Computing Infrastructure for Astrophysical Modelling and Analysis.

The facility is used by postgraduate and undergraduate students, researchers and external partners. The supercomputer is able to complete a billion calculations per second, simulate vast regions of the Universe, investigate the properties of hundreds of millions of galaxies, and has been used to run complex cosmological experiments and simulations, such as:
