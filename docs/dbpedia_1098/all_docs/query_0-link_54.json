        "text": "Autumn is around the corner, and the Northern Lights season is about to begin. I shared my thoughts with Forbes about why this autumn will be a fantastic time for aurora-chasing, just one of five excellent reasons to join Hurtigruten for a voyage along Norway's astonishing coastline. Celebrating its tenth year, the Northern Lights Promise has been extended to mid-September!\n\nThoroughly looking forward to joining the National Space Centre for this year's UK in Space Festival, alongside some fantastic speakers and organisations. I'll be launching my upcoming Children's Guide to the Night Sky, and introducing young stargazers to the Universe. You can find out more and get tickets here: https://lnkd.in/ekEe7RiS\n\nEver since the historic geomagnetic storm of May 2024, we've been wondering when the next one will occur. This week, a moderate G2 storm raised hopes of more auroral activity but failed to emerge as can often happen. Nevertheless, the next big storm is a matter of when, not if, and I shared some evergreen advice for US aurora-chasers with Parade Magazine. https://lnkd.in/e83Zfcht\n\nThank you to Bradford Literature Festival for inviting me to take part in 2024‚Äôs education programme! I spoke to hundreds of primary school students at BLF about the stories and science we draw from the night sky. It was wonderful to meet so many bright and brilliant students - tomorrow‚Äôs space professionals and storytellers.\n\nI'm looking forward to joining the 10th annual Bradford Literature Festival to take part in the Primary Education Programme and inspire young readers to discover the cosmos! I'll be sharing the storied history of the sky from the Children's Picture Atlas of the Stars, and exploring the practical ways that budding astronomers can hone their skills as revealed in the Children's Guide to the Night Sky (publishing 12 September.) Teachers can book the session on 28 June as part of the 'You are Stardust' programme. https://lnkd.in/eStPvFt9\n\nAlmost a month has passed since the incredible geomagnetic storms that brought visible auroras to the tropics, and I'm still regularly answering questions about it. I'm delighted to be featured in Smithsonian Magazine this week to share my insights alongside other experts! It's going to be a great season to join Hurtigruten in Norway and come aurora-chasing with me. https://lnkd.in/e47RswEV\n\nIt was nice to make my NPR debut, with an interview on affiliate station WOSU (Ohio) about why the approaching solar maximum will bring us more sightings of the Northern Lights.\n\nAfter last weekend's historic global aurora storm, triggered by intense solar activity, and with perhaps more activity on the way, I joined Sky News to explore the prospects for UK aurora-hunters. I also had a chance to share some insight into my role as Chief Aurora Chaser at Hurtigruten\n\nChances are you‚Äôve never seen these images from the James Webb Space Telescope before. That‚Äôs because I processed these myself using data from the NIRCam instrument, and none have appeared in press releases before. These and more from my own processing projects will be included, alongside many stunning official images, in my upcoming book Unknown Universe. It‚Äôs due to be published by HarperCollins in October, ahead of Webb‚Äôs third anniversary in space this Christmas!\n\nIt‚Äôs official: A Hurtigruten Astronomy Voyage is ùòµùò©ùò¶ way to experience the Northern Lights during the upcoming solar maximum, not least because there is so much more to Norway than its unique nightlife. It was such a pleasure to be joined by Cosmopolitan‚Äôs Sophie Leen for the trip of a lifetime, from the cute shops in Troms√∏ to the adorable huskies in Kirkenes."
