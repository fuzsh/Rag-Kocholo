Available for downloading, free of charge, at\n\nhttp://www.sfu.ca/~swartz/beyond_experience.\n\n{page 145}\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nSpace and Time\n\nIn our conversation, no word is more familiarly used or more easily recognized than \"time\". We certainly understand what is meant by the word both when we use it ourselves and when we hear it used by others.\n\nWhat, then, is time? I know well enough what it is, provided that nobody asks me; but if I am asked what it is and try to explain, I am baffled. – St Augustine (AD 354-430), Confessions ([15], 264)\n\nAugustine's dilemma is one all of us have experienced frequently in our lives, not only about time, but space, morality, justice, education, art, etc. We are perfectly capable of using these concepts in our ordinary affairs; but we seem unable to give an explication, or – better – a theoretical reconstruction, of these concepts. All of us understand the concept of time well enough to schedule meetings, to set alarm clocks, to time a cake's baking, and the like. But if asked \"What is time?\", most persons – like Augustine – would not know how to answer.\n\n8.1 Is it possible to explain what space and time are?\n\nTime and again when I was a student in public school, my teachers solemnly insisted: \"In spite of everything we know about electricity, we do not know what electricity is.\" This verdict about electricity can be found, too, in many books of the period. To use Popper's phrase (he {page 146} was speaking of objections to Einstein's relativity theories; [159], 34), this was – in the end – just a piece of \"popular nonsense\".\n\nThe first page of chapter one in The Boy Electrician, which I read countless times as a youngster, reads, in part:\n\nElectrical science ... has brought us the telephone, radio, electric lights, motors, sound pictures, television, new materials, medicines, and a host of other things. And all of these wonders have been invented and perfected by men who did not know what electricity is. No one knows what electricity is. There have been many theories or attempts to explain what this mysterious force may actually be, but all of them have been mere guesses and cannot be proven. (p. 13) —The Boy Electrician, by Alfred P. Morgan (Boston: Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co.) 1940. Reprinted by Lindsay Publications Inc., Bradley IL, 1995.\n\nWhat made that slogan nonsense stemmed from a certain presupposition that prompted it. When asked to explain what it meant to say \"We do not know what electricity is\", my teachers would often reply with something of the sort, \"We know that electrical phenomena arise out of the movement of charged particles, and we know many of the physical laws involved, but however much knowledge we gain of this sort, it will never tell us what electricity is.\" I have no doubt that my teachers were well-intentioned, that they honestly believed that this was a legitimate thing to say and to impart to their students. But in the end, it is nonsense nonetheless.\n\nIt is nonsense because as a general principle it would deny that we know of anything at all what it is. There is nothing special in this regard about electricity. What my teachers alleged to be a peculiar problem with electricity could just as well have been said about glass, the wind, your nose, profit, or freedom. And quite contrary to their argument, we know what things are precisely by knowing what their makeup is, what sorts of physical laws describe their behavior, how they typically act, and how we make use of them. We know, for example, a great deal about the wind. We understand that the wind is not the exhalation of a god but is movement within the atmosphere in which we live. We have learned, too, that air is made up of a mixture of various gases, that air moves because of differential heating (due to the Sun's heat, ocean currents, concentrated burning of fossil fuels, etc.) and because of the Coriolis force (due to the rotation of the Earth), and that air may move in laminar or turbulent ways. And we have learned, over a period of centuries by trial and error and more recently with the greater efficiency conferred by having mathematical theories of gas dynamics, to harness the wind (in windmills, for example). Once we know these sorts of things, even if our knowledge is incomplete, even if, for example, we cannot predict or explain the behavior of the wind as precisely as we might like, we know what the wind is. And the same may be said for electricity: once we know the atomic nature of electrical phenomena, have discovered a great many of the physical laws of those phenomena, have harnessed electricity in our generators, machines, radios, computers, and the like, we may perfectly reasonably say, \"For the most {page 147} part, we know what electricity is.\" Of course we cannot sum up this extensive knowledge in a brief paragraph. A good understanding of electricity comes about only after several weeks or months of study. But it is something attainable with effort. It is certainly nothing unknowable in principle.\n\nThe moral should also be applied for space and for time. Just as in the case of electricity, many persons have, like Augustine, convinced themselves that there is something deeply mysterious about space and time and that space and time are so inscrutable as to be unknowable. \"In spite of everything we know about space and time, we really do not know what space and time are\", I think many persons are inclined to think to themselves. Certainly there are problems about space and time, but the pessimistic belief that space and time are somehow so enigmatic as to be fundamentally unknowable strikes me as a piece of popular nonsense which ought to be excised just like the nonsense about electricity.\n\nWhat does coming to know what space and time are consist in? The answer, I suggest, is perfectly straightforward: it consists, simply, in our having an account which is, first of all, free of internal inconsistency, and, secondly, robust enough both to make sense of our ordinary uses of these concepts and to allow us to do physics. Common, everyday notions of space and time, as Augustine noted seventeen centuries ago, are in quite good enough shape for ordinary affairs. But they are not in particularly good shape for sophisticated thinking about the universe writ large.\n\nBuber, we have earlier seen, had tried to imagine an edge of space and a beginning and end to time and found that he was unable to imagine that there could be such things and (unfortunately for him) was unable to imagine that there could not be such things. Recall (from p. 10 above): \"A necessity I could not understand swept over me: I had to try again and again to imagine the edge of space, or its edgelessness, time with a beginning and an end or a time without beginning or end, and both were equally impossible, equally hopeless – yet there seemed to be only the choice between the one or the other absurdity\" ([37], 135-6).\n\nIn this passage, Buber, writing years later, correctly – but unwittingly – diagnoses the source of the problem: the very ideas at play are 'absurd'. But he never clearly plumbed the absurdity, either as a teenager or as a mature philosopher relating his youthful experience.\n\nThe source of Buber's difficulty is an untenable concept of space. It is deeply and irremediably flawed, for it leads, as we see explicitly in Buber's narrative, to incoherence. In Kant's terminology, this particular concept of space was beset by 'antinomies'. In modern terminology we would deem it 'paradoxical'.\n\n{page 148}\n\nLeibniz, in contrast, had a significantly different concept of space. In spite of certain difficulties1 in his theory of space, I am tempted to say that in the fundamental insight which informed his theory, Leibniz 'got it right'. However, if I were to put my praise in just that way, I would undercut what I said earlier about philosophical reconstructions, viz. that they cannot be judged to be true or false. So, forgoing the claim that Leibniz 'got it right', I am inclined to say that Leibniz's account is vastly superior to the common view and, with some repairs, can be made to work reasonably well. (Hereafter, I will refer to the theory being offered below as the \"neo-Leibnizian\" theory. The qualification \"neo\" connotes that what follows adopts the core of Leibniz's original theory, but is not to be thought to preserve the whole of that historical theory.) Let me state the essential element in the neo-Leibnizian theory of space in an initially provocative manner, using a form of words only slightly different from Leibniz's own: Space does not exist.\n\n1. For instance, Leibniz denied both that spatial relations are 'real' and that a vacuum is a possibility. Both of these claims are, however, peripheral to his main thesis, and I wish only to pursue his main thesis.\n\nThe neo-Leibnizian theory can equally be characterized as being the 'negative' theory of space. It argues, in effect, that there is nothing more to the concept of space than that places are dependent on the existence of physical objects.2 Take away those objects and there are no 'places'. In imagination annihilate all the matter of the universe. Having done so, in no intelligible sense can you then go on to say: \"This is the place where the Andromeda galaxy used to be.\" Without physical things, there are no places. To say of a world devoid of physical objects that one place might be distinguished from another would be of the same order of nonsense as to say that someone might vacate a room and leave her lap behind. Just as a lap is a spatial feature of one physical object, places are spatial features of two (or more) physical objects. In the absence of physical objects, there are no places. Still less is there a 'physical space' which might be thought to be the conglomeration of all places.\n\n2. On some contemporary interpretations of modern physics, some writers suggest that physical objects are best conceived of as clumps or distributions of energy. That refinement is inessential for our purposes.\n\nBut having now stated the thesis – that space does not exist, that there are only things and their places – in a deliberately provocative way, let me try now both to explain what I mean by this and to defend (what must surely appear at the outset to be) an outrageous claim.\n\n{page 149}\n\n8.2 A neo-Leibnizian theory of space\n\nIt is a truth of logic that any class of things can be divided, without remainder, into two mutually exclusive subclasses. Roses, for example, may be divided into all those that are red and all those that are not red. Mammals, for example, may be divided into those that are marsupials and those that are not. And similarly for theories of space, which may be divided into those theories which posit space as a subtle (ethereal) kind of 'stuff' permeating the universe and those theories which do not so regard space.\n\nIsaac Newton, like most persons, subscribed to a theory of the first kind, although Newton's theory, as we would expect, was considerably more robust than most persons'. Motivated in part by a Cartesian* theory of perception and in part by certain theological beliefs, he posited that space was, in his words, 'the sensorium of God', a kind of 'sense organ' by which God was able immediately to know the place (whereabouts) of anything in the universe. We will not concern ourselves with these latter sorts of subsidiary features of Newton's theory. What is essential in his theory was that it was one of the kind which regarded space as a 'container' of the physical objects in the universe.\n\nMost persons, I am quite sure, subscribe to a 'container' theory of space. When they say such a thing as \"There are many galaxies scattered about in space\", they will often imagine a picture, just on a grander scale, similar to that imagined when they say, for example, \"The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris.\" Just as the Eiffel Tower and Paris may each be regarded as a kind of spatial object (although of course the latter is a rather large spatial object, occupying some 106 square kilometers), the common view would have it that galaxies, too, are physical objects (very big ones) and that they are located in space, viz. a yet larger container (a kind of 'super-Paris' as it were) which is, nonetheless, a 'somewhat physical' sort of thing. The reasoning is by analogy: the Eiffel Tower (a physical thing having spatial properties) is in Paris (also a physical thing having spatial properties), and thus galaxies (physical things having physical properties), being in space, must be in a thing (i.e. space) which in its turn is a physical thing having spatial properties.\n\nThis 'container' model of space is unquestionably the one presupposed by Buber. He conceived of space as a kind of stuff of which it was appropriate (meaningful) to speculate where its edge might lie. For containers, whether they be something as small as jam jars or as large as Paris, have outer bounds: there clearly are places which lie on the 'inside' (i.e. are within) and there are other places which lie on the {page 150} 'outside' (i.e. are without). But, as we have seen (p. 10 above), Buber nearly went insane trying to reconcile himself to operating with this model of space.\n\nLeibniz strongly attacked the 'container' model of space. His particular challenge was to Newton's particular version, but it need not be regarded as so restricted. His objections, and his alternative theory, can be read as applying to any version of the 'container' theory.\n\n§2. ... real absolute space ... is an idol of some modern Englishmen. I call it an idol, not in a theological sense, but in a philosophical one. ... §3. These gentlemen maintain ... that space is a real absolute being. But this involves them in great difficulties; for such a being must needs be eternal and infinite. Hence some have believed it to be God himself, or, one of his attributes, his immensity. But since space consists of parts, it is not a thing which can belong to God. §4. As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is; that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions. For space denotes, in terms of possibility, an order of things which exist at the same time, considered as existing together. ([5], Third paper, 25-6)\n\nAnd in the following paragraph Leibniz talks of the \"chimerical [fictitious] supposition of the reality of space in itself\" (26). What all of this comes down to is Leibniz's arguing that space does not exist; that there are physical objects which, as we say, are 'in space', but space does not exist as a distinct further kind of thing which 'contains' these objects.\n\nIn reading Leibniz's characterization of Newton's theory as one of an \"absolute\" space, and his own as one of a \"relative\" space, one must recall that these terms did not mean quite the same to seventeenth-century writers as they have come to mean in the period since Einstein proposed his theories of the relativity of space. When Einstein wrote, early in the twentieth century, that space is \"relative\", he was advancing a thesis which clearly presupposed the neo-Leibnizian concept of space, but which advanced – at the same time – claims about the universe, and in particular about mass, energy, gravity, and the transmission of light, which were never dreamed of by Leibniz. It is no part of my concern here to review Einstein's theories. What I am attempting to do is to propose a theory of space and time which is consistent with modern physical theory and which {page 151} provides a suitable base on which to erect current theories in physics. I will content myself, that is, with arguing against a common, but woefully confused concept of space and time, a concept totally inappropriate for the doing of modern physics.\n\nWhen Leibniz contrasts his own theory with that of Newton, saying that Newton hypothesizes that space is 'absolute' and that he, instead, hypothesizes that space is 'relative', we must understand that Leibniz is not saying that each of them is arguing that space is a kind of stuff and that they are arguing about whether it is one sort of stuff or another. Quite the contrary, in his saying that Newton subscribes to a theory of absolute space, Leibniz is arguing that Newton believes that space is a kind of stuff. In contrast, when he himself argues that space is relative, Leibniz is arguing that space is nonexistent, in his own words, that the reality of space is \"chimerical\".\n\nIn the Newtonian world-view, space and its contents are two different sorts of things; each exists. And although physical things could not exist except by being (at some determinate point or other) in space, space could exist even if it were devoid (empty) of all physical things whatsoever. This view, as I have said, is more or less the commonly held view of space.\n\nLeibniz's view is far more economical, but distinctly at variance with common, popular views. In Leibniz's view, physical objects do not 'inhabit' space. Physical objects exist; some touch one another; others are separated by various distances from one another; but there is no further kind of 'stuff' (space) filling up the places where there are no physical objects.\n\nThere is, of course, one immediate benefit from adopting the neo-Leibnizian theory: it solves Buber's problem at a stroke. If space does not exist, then it neither has nor lacks an edge. If space does not exist, then there is no place which lies 'within' space and some other point which lies 'without'.3\n\n3. Note too that Lucretius's imagined spear thrower stationed at (in his words) \"the last limits\" (see above p. 9) simply could not exist, and he could not exist for the same sorts of reasons that a person who factored the largest odd number could not exist. Just as there is no largest odd number and hence there could not be anyone who factored it, there is no space and hence there could not be anyone who stood at its \"last limits\".\n\nMany persons find this particular manner of solving philosophical puzzles deeply disturbing and find themselves resisting the proposal. {page 152} To them it seems something of a cheat to attempt to solve a puzzle by undercutting its presuppositions. Thus, for example, some persons have balked at Russell's solution to the famous Barber paradox. Russell described a male, adult barber, who himself had whiskers, who shaved all and only those persons in his village who did not shave themselves ([179], 261). The question arises: Who shaves the barber? Whether one answers that he is unshaved, that he shaves himself, or that someone else shaves him, the answer immediately contradicts one of the explicit claims made in the description of the barber. Russell's solution – and indeed the only solution possible to the puzzle – is to recognize that the very description given of the barber is internally incoherent, i.e. it is logically impossible that there should be such a barber. The puzzle can be solved, in effect, only by 'backing up', as it were, and challenging one of the presuppositions of the very problem itself. One 'solves' such a problem, not by answering it, but by rejecting the problem, by showing that it harbors an untenable presupposition.4\n\n4. For more on the Barber paradox, see [163] and [34], 117-18.\n\nBuber could not solve his problem. That either answer led immediately, in Buber's own words, to \"absurdity\" is evidence not of the profundity of the problem itself, not of the need for ingenious solutions, but of something fundamentally incoherent in the very problem itself. And what that incoherence consisted in, I suggest, is the popularly held, but ultimately untenable, view that space is a kind of 'stuff' of which it is appropriate to imagine that it has a boundary and of which it is appropriate to ask what lies within it and what lies outside it. This 'absolute' (or 'container') notion of space cannot be freed of incoherence.\n\nThere is an altogether different sort of argument which may also be brought to bear against the concept of space as being a kind of 'stuff', an argument from English grammar. Consider the two English sentences,\n\n(S1) There is water between the chair and the wall.\n\nand\n\n(S2) There is space between the chair and the wall.\n\nFrom a point of view of English grammar, these two sentences are identical. From a grammatical point of view, they match word for {page 153} word, phrase for phrase. But in spite of that, there is something profoundly different about these two sentences. The concepts water and space which occur in them behave unexpectedly differently from a logical point of view. The remarkable dissimilarity is revealed when we try to paraphrase these two sentences. For the latter can be given a paraphrase which is anything but possible for the former. (S2) may be paraphrased this way:\n\n(S2') There is nothing between the chair and the wall, and the chair is not touching the wall.\n\nIn this paraphrase, only two sorts of 'things' (or stuff) are referred to: the chair and the wall. Talk of space has dropped out altogether. No such paraphrase is possible for (S1). For in (S1), there really are three sorts of things involved: chairs, water, and walls. But space is not a sort of thing, and this is revealed by the remarkable paraphrase possible for (S2). Two points need to be made about this maneuver.\n\nFirst, and foremost, is the need to address the objection that the paraphrase does not genuinely eliminate talk of space as a kind of stuff, it merely substitutes a synonym, viz. \"nothing\", in its place. For some persons, in reflecting on the paraphrase (S2'), will believe that they detect in it a reference to three kinds of things: chairs, walls, and nothingness. Indeed, some persons quite explicitly regard \"empty space\" and \"nothingness\" as (near-)synonyms.\n\nWe have, it seems, offered a solution to one philosophical problem, only to have it replaced by another. Is \"nothing\", when used in a sentence such as \"There is nothing between the chair and the wall\", to be regarded as referring to a thing in the way in which \"the chair\" and \"the wall\" refer to things? What role does \"nothing\" play in such a sentence?\n\nThe debate over the question what, if anything, \"nothing\" denotes has a long and checkered history in philosophy.5 Philosophers are split into two camps: those that regard \"nothing\" as denoting something (viz. the nothingness) and those that regard \"nothing\" as playing a non-denoting role in our sentences.\n\n5. P.L. Heath's article, \"Nothing\", in the Encyclopedia of Philosophy ([67], vol. 5, 524-5), exhibits two virtues: it is informative and, at the same time, it is one of the few intentionally humorous writings in modern philosophy.\n\nLewis Carroll (1832-98), the author of Through the Looking-Glass (who was by profession a mathematician and by avocation a philosopher), {page 154} spoofs the view which would make of \"nothing\" (and \"nobody\") the name of something (or someone).6\n\n6. It comes as no surprise that the same person, P.L. Heath, has written both the articles \"Lewis Carroll\" and \"Nothing\" in the Encyclopedia of Philosophy ([67]).\n\n\"Who did you pass on the road?\" the King went on, holding out his hand to the Messenger for some more hay. \"Nobody,\" said the Messenger. \"Quite right,\" said the King: \"this young lady saw him too. So of course Nobody walks slower than you.\" \"I do my best,\" the Messenger said in a sullen tone. \"I'm sure nobody walks much faster than I do!\" \"He can't do that,\" said the King, \"or else he'd have been here first.\" ([46], 196)\n\nMany twentieth-century philosophers, especially those among the Continental schools and the Existential schools, have written of Nothingness, treating it – as the King regards \"Nobody\" in Carroll's fable – as referring to some actually existent thing. They have talked of the fear of Nothingness and of the anxiety caused by the prospects of Nothingness. Some of these philosophers identify Nothingness with death; and others with 'the void'.\n\nBut other philosophers will have nothing (!) of that kind of theorizing. These latter philosophers (myself among them) regard \"nothing\" as playing a different kind of role in our sentences. \"Nothing\", according to this theory, is just one among several so-called quantifiers, words which, in effect, serve to indicate the size of the classes one is talking about. Thus, for example, we might say, \"Everything troubles me today\", or \"Practically everything is troubling me today\", or \"Something is troubling me today\", or – finally – \"There is nothing troubling me today\". What this latter sentence says, I would urge, is that there is not anything that is troubling me, i.e. that I am free of troubles. \"There is nothing troubling me today\" ought not, I suggest, be thought to be saying that I am being troubled and what is doing that troubling is Nothing.7\n\n7. Strawson has written of the tendency of certain descriptive phrases, e.g. \"the round table\", 'to grow capital letters' and become converted into names, e.g. \"the Round Table\". One might notice that there is a tendency, too, in the writings of certain philosophers for quantifiers similarly 'to grow capital letters'. If we are not careful to resist the temptation, we may find the innocent, familiar \"nothing\" mysteriously transmogrifying into a name for the (dreaded) Nothing. Arguments which adopt this latter sort of linguistic fraud fall among what have come to be called 'fallacies of reification'. As a sidelight, I might mention that Strawson's clever phrase occurs in a reply (1950), \"On Referring\" ([199]), which was directed against Bertrand Russell's \"On Denoting\" ([177]) written some forty-five years earlier, in 1905. As a matter of fact, at the time Russell wrote \"On Denoting\", Strawson's birth lay fourteen years in the future. Russell's eventual reply to Strawson was published in 1957 ([181]). There must be few other instances in the history of thought where an author may be found to be defending one of his/ her writings fifty-two years after having penned it.\n\n{page 155}\n\nAlong perfectly similar lines, when we offer a paraphrase of \"There is space between the chair and the wall\" which reads \"There is nothing between the chair and the wall and the chair is not touching the wall\", the latter ought to be understood as saying \"There is no (third) thing between the chair and the wall\" rather than as saying \"There is some third thing between the chair and the wall, namely, Nothing.\" If \"Nothing\" named a kind of thing in the world, then – by parallel reasoning, it seems to me – so too would \"something\", \"practically everything\", \"hardly anything\", \"most\", and \"a few\", etc. None of these, I suggest, names anything in the world. No more so than does \"it\" in \"It is raining\" or \"there\" in \"There is a car in the driveway.\"\n\nIf one identifies space with The Nothing, then one immediately invites back Buber's conundrum, only it now reads: \"Where does the Nothingness leave off, and what is on the other side?\"\n\nThe second concern arising over the maneuver of 'paraphrasing-away', as it were, the reference to space as a kind of thing does not so much question the results of applying that technique, but challenges the very technique itself. Some persons are deeply suspicious and troubled over the technique of solving philosophical problems by grammatical or linguistic means. Even cheerfully admitting the correctness of the paraphrase, some persons will resist seeing it as a genuine solution to the original problem. The objection they make is to the alleged relevance of the paraphrase to solving the problem.\n\nAgain, just as in the case of Russell's proposed solution of the Barber paradox, persons will have differing attitudes about the philosophical methodology involved. Persons come to philosophy with different expectations. What one person sees as a perfectly cogent solution to a {page 156} problem, another person may fail to regard as even being relevant. For some persons, the demonstration that \"space\" has a quite different 'logical grammar' from ordinary substantive terms, such as \"water\", \"wall\", and \"chair\", does nothing to address the problem of sorting out the concept of space. Linguistic maneuvers, of the sort we have just gone through paraphrasing away \"space\" in (S2), are regarded as mere 'word-chopping' or 'hairsplitting', but not as grappling with the deep conceptual problems afoot.\n\nOther persons, in being presented with precisely the same paraphrase and the accompanying discussion of how \"space\" and \"nothing\" do not behave grammatically like (incontrovertible) substantive terms such as \"water\", \"wall\", and the like, experience something of a 'Eureka'-flash, and come to regard problems like Buber's as having their source in thinking of space as if it were an (ethereal) kind of thing. In my own classroom, I often see the different attitudes persons have toward these methods. On encountering the method of paraphrase and the claim that it can sometimes reveal important distinctions among our concepts, some of my students will embrace it with zeal and regard it as revelatory while others of them will reject it with open contempt.\n\nWho is right? How does one adjudicate when fundamental conceptions about the very practice itself of philosophy are at stake? How does one argue in support of, or against, the method of paraphrasing as a means of solving some philosophical problems? Certainly great numbers of modern philosophers use such techniques: if not every day, then at least on some occasions. One can hardly pick up a current philosophical journal without finding within it some article in which the writer has utilized it or a kindred technique. But for the person unfamiliar with, or unused to, such techniques, to whom such techniques seem linguistic sleights of hand, who initially regards them as being some sort of cheat, how is one to recommend and justify the adoption of such a technique?\n\nThere can, of course, be no definitive answer. There can be no answer which is ultimately assured of winning converts to a methodology which some persons view with suspicion or disfavor. It is no more possible to find a way to convince one's opponents of the rightness or utility of a philosophical methodology than it is to find a way to convince one's opponents of the profit of looking at the world through the eyes of a new scientific theory or adopting a new technology. In spite of the commonly held view that there is some one canonical 'scientific method', its existence is, when all is said and done, mythical. Similarly, {page 157} there is nothing that can be called 'the' philosophical method, either. Philosophers are bound to disagree among themselves about philosophical methods, just as scientists are bound to disagree over scientific methods.\n\nThere is no argument in support of the method of paraphrasing which will be convincing to all doubters. One can do no more than apply that method to various cases, display the results, and invite one's readers to decide for themselves whether they regard the method and its results as acceptable. My own attitude has been to adopt the method as one tool among several to be used in struggling to explicate our concepts. I am happy to utilize it in the present case because its results cohere with the results of other approaches and because its results offer a solution to Buber's problem and because the method offers a concept of space suitable for erecting modern physical theories. This is not to say that I believe that the method of paraphrase is the touchstone for doing philosophy. Quite the contrary, I believe that in some instances it has been used in a jawbone fashion, for example in the analysis of the concept of causation where it has been applied – in the hands of some philosophers – to too few examples, and thus been used to advance an overly restricted explication of \"cause\". In short, I do not rest my case, of arguing that space is nonexistent, simply on the basis of a paraphrase of (S2). I build the argument on that paraphrase, to be sure, but on much else besides, e.g. that such an explication solves Buber's problem and that such an explication coheres with modern physical theories whereas a 'container' notion of space does not.\n\n8.3 Objections and replies to the neo-Leibnizian theory\n\nIt has been my own experience that most persons relish a lavish ontology*. By this I mean that most persons prefer a conceptual scheme in which there figure a great number of kinds of things. The term \"things\" here is meant in a very broad, inclusive sense. On this interpretation, \"things\" will include, of course, the most familiar things of all, namely physical objects, but will include as well all sorts of nonphysical things, e.g. minds (if indeed they are nonphysical), supernatural beings, numbers, classes, colors, pains, mathematical theorems, places, and events. In short, \"things\" is being used here as a general name for any sort of thing (!) whatsoever that can be named or described.\n\nMost persons, it seems to me, are willing to prune their ontologies {page 158} only with reluctance. Few persons cheerfully or readily are willing to discard items from their stock-in-trade ontology. Every philosopher who has ever argued that some item or other in the popularly held ontology is expendable insofar as it is mythical or incoherent has, I am sure, met with resistance from persons arguing that the suggestion is a patent offense against common sense.\n\nThere is much to be said for the commonsense view of the world. Foremost is the fact that it works extremely well. One tampers with it only gingerly and always at some risk of damaging it. But commonsensical views of the world are not perfect and are not immune to change and improvement. One can sometimes improve on common sense, but one must take care in trying to do so. For a good deal of suggested repair – e.g. that disease is a myth – is downright dangerous.\n\nThe neo-Leibnizian theory I have described above, the theory that space does not exist, i.e. that there is no such thing as space, is guaranteed to elicit from many persons the objection that it does so much violence to common sense that it is simply fantastic. The concept of space as being a kind of thing is so pervasive in our commonsense view of the world that any suggestion that space does not really exist is regarded as a philosopher's fancy not to be seriously credited.\n\nLet me try, somewhat further, to undo this sort of resistance. Let me try both to show how the theory works, and how it succeeds in preserving what is valuable in common sense and how it discards what is problematic in the commonsensical view.\n\nObjection 1: Lord Kelvin once extolled the virtues of measurement this way: \"... when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind\" ([109] 80). Probably he overstated the negative side of the case. There are doubtless all sorts of things – such as beauty in music and nobility of character – which have not succumbed to precise measurement but about which our knowledge cannot, reasonably, be judged to be 'unsatisfactory'.8 On the positive side, however, Kelvin's point is well taken. Measurement, especially if it is reproducible, public, accurate, and utilizable in {page 159} a well-established scientific theory, does provide us with valuable knowledge.9 More particularly, it provides us with knowledge of real features of the world. If something is measurable, then it exists. Nonexistent things cannot be measured. Now space surely can be measured. We need not, for example, content ourselves merely with noting that there is some space between the chair and the wall, we can proceed to measure quantitatively that amount of space. Using a steel tape measure, we may find that the shortest distance between the two is 55.6 cm. Using more refined laboratory instruments, we can measure space with an accuracy of better than one part in ten million. Surely it must be a mistake, then, given the acknowledged possibility of performing such public, reproducible, and accurate measurements, to argue that space itself is a fiction.\n\n8. Abraham Kaplan's views on measurement are even stronger than Kelvin's: \"No problem is a purely qualitative one in its own nature; we may always approach it in quantitative terms. We may; but can we always do so? Are there not some things which are intrinsically unmeasurable ... ? For my part, I answer these questions with an unequivocal 'No' \" ([108], 176).\n\n9. See also Cassirer: \"A fact is understood when it is measured\" ([47], 140).\n\nReply to Objection 1: The theory of space being proposed here must not be thought to deny the possibility of our performing such measurements. Any theory which said that it is impossible to measure the distance between chairs and walls would be at such gross variance with simple physical facts as to be worthy of rejection immediately. The neo-Leibnizian theory, obviously, cannot deny such 'hard facts' if it is to be seriously entertained. And indeed it does not. Quite the contrary, Leibniz implicitly allows that such measurements are possible ([5], Fifth paper, §54, 75).\n\nCertainly it is possible to measure the distances between many physical objects. For ordinary-sized physical things, close at hand, we can use calipers and meter sticks; for greater distances, surveyors' transit theodolites; and for still greater distances, radar, parallax measurements, and Doppler red-shift measurements. All of this simply must be admitted, and indeed all of it is left perfectly intact in the neo-Leibnizian theory.\n\nEven more to the point, this theory makes the picture of physical objects standing in various spatial relationships to one another its fundamental notion. According to the neo-Leibnizian theory, it is precisely physical objects and their spatial relationships which are real. What {page 160} is denied to be real is some sort of pervasive 'stuff' (i.e. space) of which these relations are somehow to be thought of as properties.\n\nIn this neo-Leibnizian theory, from the point of view of physics, what exists are physical bodies, persisting through time, some very small (including the molecules of the gaseous mixture air), others immense, some touching one another, others at various distances, some at relative rest, i.e. not moving with respect to some object conventionally chosen as the 'fixed point', and yet others in motion with respect to that 'fixed point'. But that's it. There is no further ethereal soup (space) in which all these objects 'float', as it were, like fish in the sea. But if there is no ethereal 'stuff' between objects, then Buber's peculiar views of the world cannot arise. What we have in this theory is what is worth preserving, viz. physical objects of various sizes moving about with respect to one another. What falls away is precisely, and only, that part of the picture which was problematic: the idea that space was a further kind of 'thing' of which it was appropriate to imagine that it, too, had an 'inside' and an 'outside'.\n\nObjection 2: It is not simply that we are able to measure the distance between non-contiguous objects. It goes well beyond that. Physicists, astronomers, cosmologists, and geometers attribute geometrical properties to space, e.g. they are wont to talk of space being \"curved\" and of space having \"three dimensions\". Surely only an existent thing can have such physical properties. If there is curvature, then there must exist something to be curved; if there are three dimensions, then there must exist something to be three-dimensional.\n\nReply to Objection 2: The definition of \"curvature\", as a mathematically calculable measure, was invented by Gauss (1777-1855) in two papers of 1825 and 1827 on the geometry of two-dimensional10 surfaces ([76], 15, 97). The Gaussian measure of the curvature at any {page 161} point is the reciprocal* of the products of the greatest and least radii of curvature at that point. For example, consider the curvature at a point on the 'equator' of a perfect sphere. The surface curves equally in all directions, e.g. along the equator itself and along the line of longitude through that point; i.e. both these circles have the same radius. Let us call that radius \"R\". The measure of the curvature, then, according to the Gaussian formula would be 1/(R x R). Note that it makes no matter whether \"R\" is regarded as positive or negative: in being multiplied by itself, the result must be positive. Thus, for a (perfect) sphere, the measure of curvature is at every point the same and is always positive.\n\n10. With the advent, c. 1975, of fractal geometry (launched by Benoit Mandelbrot; see [131], chap. XII, for a history) and its talk of 'fractal dimensions', it is becoming common among mathematicians to replace this historical, unqualified use of \"dimension\" with \"topological* dimension\". But since there is no discussion in this book of fractal geometry, I have felt no particular need to adopt the reformed terminology. When I speak of spatial dimensions, I will be referring to the historically familiar dimensions of width, height, and depth.\n\nImagine now the sphere growing to infinite size: the surface is (effectively) flat, and the radius is infinite (i.e. ). The Gaussian formula tells us that the curvature is 1/( x ), i.e. zero. That is, a plane surface, a flat two-dimensional 'space', has a curvature of zero.\n\nThirdly, imagine a doughnut-shaped surface, or as mathematicians call it, a torus (pl. tori). Imagine it to be oriented as if lying on a tabletop. (See figure 8.1, p. 162) Choose a point on the inner surface, i.e. on the perimeter of the hole in the middle. (In figure 8.1, see the left-hand side of the lower diagram.) There are two circles here, at right angles: a horizontal circle (whose radius is labeled \"R\") comprising that inner perimeter; and a vertical circle (whose radius is labeled \"r\"), that of the cross-section through the dough of the pastry. (If you prefer, imagine two interlocked key rings, touching at right angles.) What makes this case importantly different from the preceding two is that the two radii of curvature are in opposite directions. If one is assigned a positive value, the other must be assigned a negative value. Assume one is +r and the other is –R. Then the Gaussian formula gives a negative value for the curvature, i.e. 1/(–R x +r), which is, of course, equal to –1/(|R| x |r|). Such negatively curved surfaces are exhibited along the inner surfaces of tori, on saddles, and on the bells (flares) of hunting horns, trumpets, etc. (Incidentally, you might notice that the curvature of the surface of tori changes from place to place. While the curvature is negative on the perimeter of the hole, it is positive on the points farthest from the hole [see the right-hand half of the diagram in figure 8.1]. There the two radii, and r, point in the same direction, and hence the curvature is positive.11)\n\n11. For more on the concept of curvature, see [3], esp. 261-86 and 356-70.\n\nAs Gauss originally introduced the concept, to apply to features of\n\n{page 162}\n\nFigure 8.1\n\ntwo-dimensional surfaces, curvature is readily grasped. But it was not long before the concept was extended in 1854, by Riemann (1826-66), to apply, not to two-dimensional surfaces, but to three-dimensional space ([173]).\n\nFor a mathematician, a 'space' may be of any number of dimensions. Indeed, a 'space' need not refer to anything physical whatever: it is just a measure of the number of 'dimensions' needed to specify the 'location' of something of interest. For example, Helmholtz cites the case of the three-dimensional 'space' of colors: any given color may be located in the (finite) three-dimensional space of red, green, and blue, by specifying for each of these 'dimensions' (primary colors) what percentage occurs in the given color. (He omits intensity; had he included that parameter, he would have needed a four-dimensional 'space' {page 163} which was finite in three of its dimensions, and infinite in the fourth.) If someone offered a theory of intelligence, for example, in which there were five independent parameters to be measured – e.g. verbal skills, mathematical skills, physical skills, creative skills, and social skills – then one would have to posit a 'space' of these five dimensions in which to locate any given person. From the mathematical point of view, there is utterly no difference between the 'spaces' of geometry, of color spectra, and of intelligence. All of these, and countless other 'manifolds', are called \"spaces\". Even philosophers have adopted the concept and sometimes talk (perhaps a bit pretentiously) of such esoterica as \"logical\" space.\n\nWhen Riemann extended Gauss's original concept of the curvature of two-dimensional surfaces to a three-dimensional space, we must understand that he was proceeding by mathematical analogy. He was, in effect, arguing that certain features of three-dimensional geometry (and by extension, four-, five-, six-, indeed any n-dimensional geometry) would be extensions of features of two-dimensional geometry. In any analogy, certain features are preserved and others discarded. And in extending Gauss's original notion, devised for two-dimensional geometry, to three-, four-, or higher-dimensional geometries, we must take care to understand exactly what may be carried over and what is to be discarded.\n\nRiemann discovered that in a 'positively curved' space, many of the familiar theorems of Euclidean geometry do not hold. For example, in such a space, there are no parallel lines and the sum of the angles of triangles always exceeds 180°. But what, exactly, is one to make of this notion of a 'positively curved' space? The intellectual puzzle arises because of the difficulty we have in trying to extend the familiar notions of curvature which were introduced, in the first instance, to apply to two-dimensional surfaces: of the sphere, of the torus, etc. To be sure, the sphere and the torus are three-dimensional objects; but their surfaces are two-dimensional 'spaces'. We can intuitively grasp the sense of \"curvature\" operative in these familiar cases because we can visualize that the curved surfaces are the two-dimensional surfaces of a three-dimensional figure. But when we are then told that our own physical space is (or might be) curved, and we try by analogy to visualize it as being the surface of some four-dimensional solid, our imaginations fail us. The analogy becomes more hindrance than help.\n\nMathematicians are practiced enough to know how to handle the analogy correctly. Mathematicians, that is, know how to abstract the essential mathematical features from such examples – the plane, the {page 164} sphere, the torus, etc. Non-mathematicians, however, are done a disservice by these models, for they are not practiced in focusing in on just the relevant mathematical features at play, and are far too likely, virtually inevitably likely, to be distracted by the robust reality of the physical objects (the Earth, the hunting horn) which 'sport' these curved surfaces. What the mathematician wants to focus on in these models are the surfaces themselves, divorced from the things of which they happen to be the surfaces, i.e. the mathematician is concerned solely with the mathematical, not the physical, properties of these surfaces. But all of this is usually lost in most popular presentations of modern geometry.\n\nAlready in the nineteenth century, Hermann Helmholtz recognized non-mathematicians' inability to handle the concept of curvature in the manner of physicists and mathematicians, i.e. he recognized that non-mathematicians tried to conceive of the curvature which was said to characterize physical space after the model of curvature which was familiar in the case of the two-dimensional surfaces of three-dimensional objects. Helmholtz advises that one abandon any attempt to conceive of curvature in that manner. Instead we should conceive of curvature as the result of a certain kind of calculation we perform on quantities we measure with our instruments.\n\nAll known space-relations are measurable, that is, they may be brought to determination of magnitudes (lines, angles, surfaces, volumes). Problems in geometry can therefore be solved, by finding methods of calculation for arriving at unknown magnitudes from known ones. ... Now we may start with this view of space, according to which the position of a point may be determined by measurements in relation to any given figure (system of co-ordinates), taken as fixed, and then inquire what are the special characteristics [e.g. the curvature] of our space as manifested in the measurements that have to be made. This path was first entered by ... Riemann of Göttingen. It has the peculiar advantage that all its operations consist in pure calculation of quantities which quite obviates the danger of habitual perceptions being taken for necessities of thought. ... To prevent misunderstanding, I will once more observe that this so-called measure of space-curvature is a quantity obtained by purely analytical [mathematical] calculation, and that its introduction involves no suggestion of relations that would {page 165} have a meaning only for sense-perception. ([89], 44-7)\n\nHelmholtz, like Riemann himself, regards this 'new talk' of curvature, not as describing perceivable, or even imaginable, properties of space, but rather as a result to be obtained by mathematical calculation on measured quantities.\n\nIn modern science, too, many writers repeat the advice, cautioning readers explicitly about the potentially misleading use of the word \"curved\". The astronomer Dennis Sciama, for example, writes that it is misleading to talk of non-Euclidean space as \"curved\". But his point is perfectly general, and does not apply only to non-Euclidean space, for it is, in a way, just as misleading to describe Euclidean space as \"flat\". I will bracket certain phrases in quoting him, so as to make his point more general. In this instance, bracketing indicates not my insertions, but rather my suggested deletions from the original: \"We can easily understand what it means to say that a two-dimensional surface is curved, because we can see this surface lying in three-dimensional [Euclidean] space, and the meaning of the word 'curvature' is quite obvious. But when this same name 'curvature' is also given to a three-dimensional [non-Euclidean] space (footnote: let alone four-dimensional space-time!) it becomes rather misleading. ... All that is meant by the curvature of space, then, is that gravitation affects the motion of bodies\" ([186], 146). The essential point is Sciama's last sentence: \"All that is meant by the curvature of space, then, is that gravitation affects the motion of bodies.\" And he might have added, \"and affects the path of light rays.\"12 (A minor matter: {page 166} The so-called curvature of space varies from place to place. The curvature is more marked, i.e. light rays are more affected, in the vicinity of massive bodies than at places remote from them. And the overall curvature of the entire universe is a function of both the amount and the distribution of mass within the universe.)\n\n12. The mathematician-astronomer I.W. Roxburgh makes much the same point, but writes at somewhat greater length: \"... what is this stuff called space whose curvature is to be determined – how do we measure it? We can, like Gauss, set up a triangulation experiment and measure the angles of a triangle – the answer will not be 180° – but this does not mean space is curved. The experiment is done with light rays and theodolites – the empirical result is a statement about the behaviour of light rays – not about space. It is, as it must be, an experiment about the relationship between objects in space not about space itself. The same is necessarily true about any experiment; from it we learn of the relationship between objects not of the background we call space. ... Space ... is an intermediary that we bring into the formalism [of relativity theory] for ease of representation, but in any empirical statement about the world the representation [i.e. space itself] is eliminated\" ([175], 87; italics added).\n\nTalk of space itself being curved has become commonplace within physics. But one must beware not to interpret such talk too literally, or at least not with the common meanings we assign to the word \"curvature\". We should no more want to regard the physicist's use of the term \"curvature\" as being akin to the ordinary use than we should want to regard the physicist's use of the word \"field\" as being akin to the farmer's.\n\nIn suggesting that we should deliberately and consciously try to resist the temptation to conceive of space as a kind of subtle, tenuous, ethereal, or subliminal kind of 'stuff', the sort of thing which begs us to try to imagine where its boundaries might be or what its curvature or geometry might be, I am not suggesting that we reform our language so as to purge it of the word \"space\" or that we cease altogether to talk of space. To try to avoid talking of space strikes me as futile and as foolhardy an enterprise as some have attempted with certain other terms. History provides us with the spectacle of a number of linguistic cultists who have trained themselves to speak without ever uttering words which they regarded as 'corrupt' – not barbarisms like \"priorize\", \"irregardless\" and \"de-hire\", but perfectly ordinary nuts-and-bolts words such as \"but\" or \"not\" and even (incredibly) \"is\".13 (I have had students, bamboozled by bizarre linguistic theories, try to explain to me that every time one uses the word \"but\" in describing the behavior of another person, one has insulted that person.14)\n\n13. For example, this sort of linguistic nonsense was occasionally peddled in the 1930s by some of the more extreme of the disciples of Alfred Korzybski, founder of the school of General Semantics. General Semantics must not be confused with the modern science of semantics*. Indeed Korzybski himself wrote, \"My work in General Semantics has nothing to do with the above-mentioned disciplines [pragmatics, semantics, and logic]\" ([113], 282).\n\n14. Counterexamples which refute the theory are easy to find. It is no insult, but rather a compliment, to say, \"She had missed a day of work because of an airline strike, but still managed to break all sales records for July.\"\n\nSome proposals to reform language are grounded in good reasons; some are not. Certain proposals – e.g. to use nonsexist pronouns and {page 167} nonsexist descriptive terms or to eliminate offensive racist and ethnic labels – have powerful ethical warrant. However, there are no similarly good reasons – either on ethical or on any other grounds – for eliminating such words as \"is\", \"but\", and \"space\". These latter sorts of terms, or equivalents, are enormously useful, being well-suited for most contexts. It would be pointless and counterproductive to abstain from using the word \"space\". All of us, myself included, will surely continue to say such perfectly intelligible and correct things as \"There is not enough space on the shelf for this book\" or \"There is too much space in the garden to conceal with a single rosebush.\" My suggestion is only that, even though we use the word \"space\" often and with propriety, we not allow ourselves to think that the term designates some sort of tenuous 'stuff'. When we find ourselves lapsing into the kinds of speculations which so befuddled Buber, and perhaps ourselves earlier, it is at that point that we should remind ourselves that \"space\" does not function in our language like \"water\", that any sentence containing the word \"space\" can be paraphrased so that talk of \"space\" drops out. (\"There's not enough space on the shelf for this book\" might become, for example, \"If all the objects on the shelf were to be shoved to the left end of the shelf, then the distance at the right end, between the last object and the right edge of the shelf, would be less than the width of this book.\")\n\nGeorge Berkeley (1685-1753), perhaps paraphrasing Francis Bacon, wrote: \"... we ought to 'think with the learned and speak with the vulgar [ordinary persons]' \" (A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, [27], 45-6). Although I certainly do not share the views he was advancing in the context in which the quotation appears (he was arguing against the reality of material objects), the maxim, divorced from that particular application, remains good advice. The word \"space\" is here to stay. Nonetheless, there is nothing to prevent our adopting a refined understanding of the concept invoked by that word. Although we persist in using the word, we can certainly adopt the sort of conception counseled by the learned: by Leibniz, by Helmholtz, and by modern cosmologists. We are free to abandon the incoherent notion of space which would make space a kind of 'stuff', or, even worse, a kind of 'curved stuff'.\n\nObjection 3: The idea that space exists derives not just from common sense, or even, for that matter, from physics, but from perception. Space is not a theoretical posit, or hypothetical entity, in the way in which the 'collective unconscious' might be thought to be. Quite the {page 168} contrary, space is every bit as perceivable as are physical objects. For I do not see only physical objects, I can also see the space between them. On clear moonless nights, I can look up at the sky and see the very blackness of space itself. In short, I can see space. Since I can see space, and since I am experiencing neither an illusion nor a delusion, space must, then, exist.\n\nReply to Objection 3: It is perfectly clear what the reply must be to this last objection. Someone holding to a neo-Leibnizian theory of space, who thereby wishes to deny the reality of space, must counterargue that space is not visible. But can one reasonably do this? Is not space visible in just the same sort of way, for example, that my hand is visible when held up before my eyes in a well-lighted room? There are, I think, two different sorts of cases where one might think one is perceiving space itself, and we would do well to examine both of them.\n\nThe first sort of case involves ordinary, daylight perception, the kind you and I regularly experience as we look about ourselves in well-lighted places. What do we see? Typically, all sorts of physical objects – tables, chairs, pictures on the walls, carpets, human beings, etc. (if we are indoors); buildings, trees, roads, flowers, clouds, human beings, etc. (if we are outdoors) – lying at different distances from our vantage point. These many things are scattered about in different places, and often there are few if any other things occupying the places between them. About this we can all agree, and up to this point we give identical reports. But is there something more to be seen? Is there, in addition to the sorts of things just mentioned, space as well? Do we see space between the objects?\n\nTo be sure, we say such things as \"I can see space between the wall and the chair\" or \"I can see that there is a space between the wall and the chair.\" But – as before – we must treat such locutions very carefully. If you could really (or genuinely or authentically) see space, then you ought to be able to answer the question, \"What color is that space?\" Immediately, you are brought up short. What color is the space between the chair and the wall? If you try to answer that it is colorless, then you might rightly be asked how you could possibly see something which is colorless. In more familiar cases where we use the term \"colorless\", we can talk of seeing the colorless item, a liter of distilled water for example, because the object refracts light (other objects look distorted in various ways when viewed through the {page 169} object) or because the colorless object exhibits reflections on its surface. But space is supposed to be even more colorless than the most perfectly distilled water. Locally, in our living rooms and on the street in front of our homes, space does not refract the images of objects and space does not boast a surface which sports reflections. Space is thought to be non-refractive and non-reflective. If so, then it must be perfectly invisible. What 'seeing space' amounts to, then, is looking at the places between visible things and failing to see anything there. 'Seeing space' is not the successful seeing of something which exists, but is instead the looking at a place and the failure to see anything there. We do not see space; what we see – and describe in a slightly misleading way – are places devoid of things.\n\nThis leaves the other case which I mentioned a moment ago. Can't we see space when we look up at the sky on a moonless night? Can't we see the inky blackness of space itself? \"Space is not colorless after all; phenomenologically space is black, and can be seen,\" our critic might object.\n\nOften, persons who hold to the theory that space is a kind of thing are not consciously aware that they hold two inconsistent views about space: both that space in our living rooms is colorless and space between galaxies is black. But they cannot have it both ways. And they must be challenged: \"Well, which is it, colorless or black, and why the difference?\"\n\nThe simple answer is that it is neither. The tension between the conflicting answers arises out of a misbegotten concept of space. The places between objects, where there are no other objects, are not 'things' of which one can ask, \"Are they colored or colorless?\" Empty places are not things: they are neither colored nor colorless; they are not black, and they are not any other color either.\n\n\"Why, then, is the space between the chair and the table, unlike the space between Mars and Venus, not black?\" This way of putting the question persists with the confusion. The 'space' between Mars and Venus is not black. We do not see blackness between the chair and the table, not because the space 'there' is some other color, but because we can see, by looking through that place, the illuminated wall beyond. If space existed and were colored, then I could not see my hand when held up a few inches from my nose: the intervening space would block my view. The sky is black between Mars and Venus, not because (interplanetary) 'space' is black, but rather because there is nothing to be seen there (between the planets) and nothing (except for {page 170} an occasional distant star) to be seen further on, either.15\n\n15. From a phenomenological point of view, i.e. from the point of view of the sensory quality of the experience rather than the physics of its cause, we should realize that black is a color, on an equal footing with red, blue, yellow, etc. The often-heard slogan \"black is not a color\" is an article of physics, not of the phenomenology of sense perception. Black happens to be the color we perceive within our visual fields in those areas which are negligibly illuminated. It is possible, of course, to imagine that such minimally illuminated areas might have been perceived as red or yellow, or some other color. That we perceive such areas as black just happens to be a product of the way we are wired. It is not surprising, then, that when at first robbed of illumination, our visual sense offers up to us a visual field which is black. But, as we know, after a while, the blackness 'fades' from our consciousness. When seated in a darkened room for several minutes, most of us become oblivious to the black visual field in just the way that we become oblivious to the kinesthetic sensations of our body pressing against our chair. We come gradually not to see anything: there is no color sensation at all, not even of blackness. What is it like to be born blind? Is it to experience an infinite, black featureless visual field? I think not. I sometimes try to imagine blindness by moving my hand from clear view in front of my face around to the back of my head. At no point does my hand enter 'the inky blackness'. It simply disappears from view. That is what, I imagine, it must be like to be blind: just what it is like for me not to be able to see something positioned directly behind my head. I am, like everybody, blind in that direction. To be completely blind is to be unseeing, not as we all are in some directions, but to be unseeing in all directions. It is not to perceive an inky blackness.\n\nWhen we look up at the sky on a moonless night and get an impression of black, we are not seeing a black 'thing'. We are not seeing anything at all, and our nervous system fools us, by presenting it to our consciousness as if it were a gigantic piece of coal. Sometimes we get an impression of black from genuinely black physical objects, e.g. lumps of coal and the like. But our nervous system presents (much) the same visual impression when there is nothing there whatsoever. We must take care not to think that if there is a visual impression of black, then there is something there which is black.\n\nThe ancients used to think that the (night) sky was the interior of a hollow black globe and the stars were tiny holes in that globe through which light shone. We should not want to replace that defective notion with one which would substitute for the black globe an infinite, tenuous, subtle 'container', either black or colorless. Physical things exist, {page 171} and because there are physical things, and only because there are physical things, there are also places. There is no need to posit an antecedently and independently existing physical space, a container, as it were, in which to imbed these physical objects. Neither physics nor our logic requires such a posit. Indeed, the very idea itself is, ultimately, internally incoherent.\n\n8.4 Interlude: The expression \"x does not exist\"\n\nDoubtless one of the things which bemuses, indeed even baffles, persons new to philosophy is metaphysicians' proclivity to pronounce of all sorts of things which non-philosophers regard as relatively familiar that they are, in the end, nonexistent. Metaphysicians have often been known to deny the very existence of such (seemingly) obvious things as space, time, minds, material objects, superegos, evil, miracles, causes, physical laws, free will, and objective truth. Sometimes their negative pronouncements have the result of inducing great curiosity in their hearers, but sometimes the effect is entirely opposite to that intended, inducing, instead, great impatience, even outright alienation. The audience for such claims may find themselves initially protesting: \"But surely that cannot be right. It is patently obvious that such a thing really does exist.\" Such persons may come to regard metaphysics as the wholesale rejection of common sense.\n\nGenerally metaphysicians know very well that in denying the existence of certain things we are bucking common sense. Metaphysicians are not a species apart. Virtually all of us grow up among the very persons to whom we direct our writings and speak (more or less) the same language as the proverbial 'man in the street'. What explains our talk about \"x does not really exist\" is our indulging in a kind of literary license, a minor – but possibly potentially misleading – piece of professional hyperbole. Usually such locutions are meant as attention-getters, as a means of highlighting dramatically and forcefully the focus of our concerns. In most cases (but certainly not quite all), the metaphysician who writes \"x does not exist\" may be found to be advancing a rather more complicated theory, viz. \"x does not exist, if by 'x' one means 'y'; and while y does not exist, something else, viz. z does; and taking the latter to be what is denoted by 'x' is a better theory.\" Put less formally, generally what is involved in the metaphysician's denying that x exists is really the offering of an alternative theory, to be substituted in place of the prevailing, and allegedly defective, theory about the nature of x.\n\n{page 172}\n\nIn denying, as I have just done in the previous section, that space exists, I did not stop simply with making that denial. What was involved in denying that space exists was the elaboration that what was being challenged was a particular concept of space, a concept which would portray space as being itself something like a spatial object. And it is that particular concept, I argued, which is incoherent and in need of replacement. What was not being challenged, indeed what was being insisted upon, is most of what occurs in the ordinary concept, e.g. that there are physical objects, that they are strewn about the universe in different places at varying, and indeed measurable, distances, and that physics can tell us a very great deal about how material objects can interact gravitationally and can tell us the geometry of the path of radiation in the vicinity of massive bodies. In denying that space exists, not only was none of this latter denied, it was positively insisted upon. The claim that space does not exist is my (and several other philosophers') way of calling attention to the fact that space conceived after the fashion of a quasi-physical object is an untenable notion.\n\nAnd thus it goes. Typically when metaphysicians deny that something exists, we do not just leave it at that. What we are in fact doing is offering an alternative theory; we are trying to show that there is something defective in the ordinary notion and are offering a repair. Only rarely, if ever, do we suggest that a concept should be discarded without being replaced by anything at all.\n\nIn the following section, we will, for the first and only time in this book, encounter a theory, McTaggart's theory of time, which is of the latter sort. McTaggart argued that neither of the two principal theories of time is tenable, and that time does not exist. Few other metaphysicians are disposed to accept his arguments.\n\n8.5 Positive and negative theories of time\n\nJust as there are two major theories of space – the 'container' theory and the relational (or Leibnizian) theory – there are two major theories of time. Indeed, I regard it as one of the most important successes of modern metaphysics to have discovered just how much similarity there is, in their formal aspects, between space and time. (We will devote sections 8.7 through 8.10 to the topic of spatial and temporal analogies.)\n\nThere is a certain problem in what we are to call each of these theories. The first is sometimes called the \"absolute\", \"dynamic\", \"Augustinian\", {page 173} or, simply, the \"A-theory\". The latter name, \"A-theory\", does not stand either for \"absolute\" or for \"Augustinian\", but derives from J.M.E. McTaggart (1866-1925), who distinguished two sets of temporal terms, one he designated the \"A-series\" and the other, the \"B-series\". The second, opposing, theory is sometimes known as the \"relative\", \"static\", or \"B-theory\" of time.\n\nIn its way, the Augustinian theory of time is the temporal analog of the 'container theory' of space and, not surprisingly, it prompted in Augustine himself much the same sort of bewilderment that we have already seen in Buber: \"Time ... is never all present at once. The past is always driven on by the future, the future always follows on the heels of the past, and both the past and the future have their beginning and their end in the eternal present\" ([15], §11). Hardly are these words down on paper than Augustine has second thoughts and retracts, or contradicts, what he has just said about the present being 'eternal': \"Of these three divisions of time ... how can two, the past and the future, be, when the past no longer is and the future is not yet? As for the present, if it were always present and never moved on to become the past, it would not be time but eternity\" (§14). But this is only the start of his problems. For now he goes on to write:\n\nIf the future and past do exist, I want to know what they are. I may not yet be capable of such knowledge, but at least I know that wherever they are, they are not there as future or past, but as present. For if, wherever they are, they are future, they do not yet exist; if past, they no longer exist. So wherever they are and whatever they are, it is only by being present that they are. (§18) ... it is abundantly clear that neither the future nor the past exist, and therefore it is not strictly correct to say that there are three times, past, present, and future. It might be correct to say that there are three times, a present of past things, a present of present things, and a present of future things. Some such different times do exist in the mind, but nowhere else that I can see. (§20)\n\nWhat Augustine is finally driven to, we see, is a 'psychological' theory of time: the past and the future exist (mysteriously) 'in the mind', but not in objective reality. Any such theory must immediately face the problem how it is possible to measure time. This would be an {page 174} especially acute problem in modern physics where it is commonplace, using exquisitely crafted instruments, to resolve time intervals into million-millionths of seconds. Such remarkable precision seems orders of magnitude beyond what any of us is capable of by psychological reckoning. But even in the far cruder physics of the fourth century AD, a psychological theory of time faced a hopeless uphill battle. Augustine's claim – \"It is in my own mind, then, that I measure time. I must not allow my mind to insist that time is something objective\" (§27) – is a virtual non-starter when it comes to explaining several persons' common measurements of time. Augustine would have us believe that memories and expectations are the actual objects of our temporal measurements: \"... it is not future time that is long, but a long future is a long expectation of the future; and past time is not long, because it does not exist, but a long past is a long remembrance of the past\" (§28). Memories of the past and expectations of the future are no substitute for actual physical measurements of temporal intervals as they occur. My memory of my son's birthday celebration, for example, may last only a fleeting moment, although the celebration may have gone on for hours. Presently held memories and expectations simply do not have the temporal extents of the events remembered or expected and cannot be used as their proxies in our trying to determine their durations.\n\nHow can we summarize the core of Augustine's theory? Augustine, himself, provides a useful characterization: \"[Time] can only be coming from the future, passing through the present, and going into the past. In other words, it is coming out of what does not yet exist, passing through what has no duration, and moving into what no longer exists\" (§21). You can see here why Augustine's theory has sometimes been called the \"dynamic\" theory. He posits, not things or events evolving through time, but time itself as moving from the future, through the present, to the past. And you can also see why one might regard such a theory as the temporal analog of the spatial theory which regards space as a 'container'. For just as the absolute theory of space treats space itself (as we have seen) as a quasi-spatial thing, Augustine's theory of time treats time itself as a quasi-temporal thing, i.e. as a sort of thing which \"passes\" and \"moves\". And you can see, too, why Augustine's is sometimes regarded as a 'positive' theory of time: because it asserts that there is more to time than just events standing in temporal relations. It may be contrasted with so-called 'negative' theories which assert that there is nothing more to time than events standing in temporal relationships.\n\n{page 175}\n\nAugustine, to be sure, is not wholly happy with his own theory, and seems constantly to be troubling himself with peculiar questions – ones which arise naturally for a positive theory – such as \"While we are measuring it, where is it coming from, what is it passing through, and where is it going?\" (§21). But where Buber was driven to despair, Augustine – cleric that he was – was driven to prayer. Throughout his chapter on time, Augustine beseeches God for divine illumination on these mysteries.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, McTaggart may be found to be promoting arguments virtually identical to Augustine's. But where Augustine confessed his bewilderment at the results of his own researches and seemed distressed by them, McTaggart unabashedly concludes that time is, in his words, \"unreal\".\n\nIt may seem strange that I will take McTaggart to task for this latter conclusion. After all, have I not just finished a moment ago, in this very chapter, a lengthy argument to the effect that space is nonexistent? Why should I be sanguine about my own denial that space exists, and then take exception to McTaggart's claim that time does not exist?\n\nThere is an important distinction between the sort of theory about space which I have just advanced and the sort of theory about time which McTaggart advances. In denying that space exists, I tried to explain that what that short proposition was to be understood to be asserting was that there is nothing in Nature like what is described by the theory of absolute space. I was denying one particular theory of space, only to be offering what I take to be a better theory, that of relative space, in its stead. And what makes the foregoing enterprise so different from McTaggart's theory of time is that McTaggart, in arguing for the unreality of time, is not offering a theory of relative time to replace or supersede a theory of absolute time, but is arguing against the viability of either theory. McTaggart is not saying, \"Time does not exist, if you mean by 'time' y\"; he is saying, \"Time does not exist, period.\"16\n\n16. A certain qualification is in order. In the latter half of The Nature of Existence ([130]), McTaggart makes a concerted effort to explain how, if time does not exist, then there is at least the appearance of time. So while it is strictly correct to say that McTaggart argues that time does not exist, he at least tries to preserve something of our ordinary account, viz., if not the actuality, then at least the appearance, of temporality.\n\nMcTaggart begins by directing attention to two different ways we {page 176} commonly refer to positions in time. Right at the outset, he qualifies his introduction to this topic by writing \"as time appears to us prima facie\". He can hardly begin by saying that time is one way or another, for he is setting out to prove that time does not exist. Hence he talks of the \"appearance\" of time, so as not to admit that time does in fact exist: \"Positions in time, as time appears to us prima facie, are distinguished in two ways. Each position is Earlier than some and Later than some of the other positions. ... In the second place, each position is either Past, Present, or Future.17 The distinctions of the former class are permanent, while those of the latter are not. If M [some event] is ever earlier than N [some other event], it is always earlier. But an event, which is now present, was future, and will be past\" ([130], §305).\n\n17. Later, in a footnote to §329, McTaggart qualifies these statements a bit. On the supposition that there is a first moment of time, then there is no moment Earlier than that moment and there is nothing Past to that moment. Similarly, if there is a last moment of time, there is nothing Later than that moment, nor is there anything Future to that moment. So when he writes that each \"position is Earlier than ... some other position\", etc., he wants to be understood as making this claim for all positions in time except for the first and last moments, if such exist at all. This minor correction is inessential for his ensuing arguments.\n\nThe latter of these series, McTaggart calls the \"A-series\", the former, the \"B-series\": \"For the sake of brevity I shall give the name of the A series to that series of positions which runs from the far past through the near past to the present, and then from the present through the near future to the far future, or conversely. The series of positions which runs from earlier to later, or conversely, I shall call the B series\" ([130], §306).\n\nMcTaggart then proceeds to argue that it is the A-series which is metaphysically more fundamental, for it is the A-series alone which can account for change, not the B-series. The B-series is, in a certain sense, static: it cannot account for an event's changing from having been future, to becoming present, and, finally, becoming past.\n\nTake any event – the death of Queen Anne, for example – and consider what changes can take place in its characteristics. That it is a death, that it is the death of Anne Stuart, that it has such causes, that it has such effects – every characteristic of this sort {page 177} never changes. ... At the last moment of time – if time has a last moment – it will still be the death of a Queen. And in every respect but one, it is equally devoid of change. But in one respect it does change. It was once an event in the far future. It became every moment an event in the nearer future. At last it was present. Then it became past, and will always remain past, though every moment it becomes further and further past.\n\nSuch characteristics as these are the only characteristics which can change. And, therefore, if there is any change, it must be looked for in the A series, and in the A series alone. If there is no real A series, there is no real change. The B series, therefore, is not by itself sufficient to constitute time, since time involves change. ([130], §311)\n\nNotice how McTaggart's account of time is reminiscent of Augustine's: the future 'changes' into the present, and the present 'changes' into the past. Once an event is past, then it 'recedes' further and further from the present. According to this account, it is time itself, or positions in time, which undergo change.\n\nVarious critics have strenuously objected to this account, since it seems to temporalize time itself. Time itself seems to be moving through time: the future 'becomes' the present, and the present 'becomes' the past. The picture seems to presuppose a kind of super-time, against which the flow of 'ordinary' time might be measured. Needless to say, many philosophers have attempted to create theories of time in which such an awkward, and probably unintelligible, notion is not introduced at all. In chapter 11, we will examine a totally different sort of theory, one in which time itself does not change, but it is objects, or things, which change in time. (McTaggart, in §315, explicitly rejects this alternative theory.) But this is to get ahead of ourselves. For the moment, we must see what McTaggart concludes from his argument that the A-series is metaphysically more fundamental than the B-series.\n\nHe continues by arguing that time itself can exist only if there is something in reality which has the properties of the A-series. That is, he argues that time is real only if there are events which are future, become present, and recede into the past. But there can be no such events. For nothing whatever can have these properties since they are, as he attempts to show, logically inconsistent with one another, and no real (existent) thing can have logically inconsistent properties. Just as a five-sided square would have logically inconsistent properties and {page 178} hence could not possibly exist, McTaggart tries to demonstrate that a time which was future, became present, and receded into the past would have logically inconsistent properties and hence could not possibly exist:\n\nPast, present and future are incompatible determinations. Every event must be one or the other, but no event can be more than one. ... But every event [except the first and the last, if there are first and last events] has them all. If M is past, it has been present and future. If it is future, it will be present and past. Thus all three characteristics belong to each event. ([130], §329)\n\nIn short, every event has incompatible determinations: it is past, present, and future. The case is analogous to a figure having exactly four and having exactly five sides. The characteristics are incompatible, and no such figure could possibly exist.\n\nMcTaggart anticipates the obvious objection that he has neglected the tenses of the various verbs.\n\nIt may seem that this [claim that there is an incompatibility of determinations] can easily be explained [i.e. exposed to be an error]. Indeed, it has been impossible to state the difficulty without almost giving the explanation, since our language has verb-forms for the past, present and future, but no form that is common to all three. It is never true, the answer will run, that M is present, past and future. It is present, will be past, and has been future. Or it is past, and has been future and present, or again is future, and will be present and past. The characteristics are only incompatible when they are simultaneous, and there is no contradiction to this in the fact that each term has all of them successively. ([130], §330)\n\nBut McTaggart has raised this objection only, in turn, to dispute it. His ensuing counterobjection, i.e. his defense of his theory, lies in his asserting that every moment of time \"is both past, present, and future\" ([130], §331). As I reconstruct his rebuttal (§331), it seems to me to be something of the following sort. Consider the present moment: it is of course present; but equally, if we were to pick a past {page 179} moment, then the present moment is future; and equally, if we were to pick a future moment, then the present moment is past. Thus, the present moment is not only present, but past and future as well.\n\nThis reply in defense of his theory strikes me as wrongheaded in the extreme. It strikes me as analogous to, and as unacceptable as, the following argument (where Carol plays the role of Future, Betty of Present, and Alice of Past).\n\nCarol is taller than Betty, who in turn is taller than Alice. Focus your attention on Betty. Now, pick someone who is shorter than Betty, e.g. Alice. Compared to Alice, Betty is tall. Now pick someone who is taller than Betty, e.g. Carol. Compared to Carol, Betty is short. Betty is thus both short and tall. But being short and being tall are incompatible determinations. Thus Betty could not possibly exist.\n\nI suggest that McTaggart has made the equivalent error. That any moment of time may be present, and equally may – relative to some other moments of time – be future, and equally may – relative to still other moments of time – be past, does nothing to show that any moment of time is both past, present, and future. No more than does your being taller than some persons and shorter than still others establish that you are both tall and short. One need not, then, conclude – as did McTaggart – that time is self-contradictory, and hence, that its very existence is logically impossible.\n\nMcTaggart's theory of time, which virtually all commentators have subsequently found curious, unorthodox, and – in the end – quite unacceptable, was not just an isolated or insignificant fragment of his philosophizing. It stemmed in large measure from his inability to shake off the Augustinian concept of time, in which time was conceived as something 'moving' from the future, through the present, and into the past. McTaggart marked the culmination, if not quite the end, of a long era of conceiving of time in this familiar, even though confused, manner. The modern approach is, in a way, the very antithesis of McTaggart's.\n\nMcTaggart's theory, like Augustine's, was a positive theory: it argued that there was something more to time than merely events standing in temporal relations. (Other writers have called this additional feature 'becoming', and argued that becoming could not be accounted for within a negative theory, e.g. within a bare B-series.) Negative theorists propose, in contrast, that temporal relations can be {page 180} treated analogously to spatial relations and that adequate theories of time can be constructed by regarding time as nothing over and above the temporal relations events have to one another.\n\nWhat is currently regarded as being needed, both for metaphysics and for science, is a theory of time which is free of internal inconsistency and which is able to accommodate a variety of facts: (1) that temporal events form a series, i.e. that events may be earlier than, simultaneous with, or later than other events; (2) that there is a present, a future, and a past; (3) that things change, evolve, grow, degenerate, etc.; and (4) that temporal relations – as attested to by the fact that they can be measured by scientific instruments with accuracies far beyond what are psychologically possible – are not 'just in the mind', but are objective facts of Nature.\n\n8.6 The generalized concept of space\n\nDescartes and a number of subsequent philosophers, e.g. Locke, have argued that it is of the essence of material objects to be extended in space, i.e. to 'take up room' as we might say more colloquially. Descartes wrote: \"... nothing whatever belongs to the concept of body [i.e. material object] except the fact that it is something which has length, breadth and depth and is capable of various shapes and motions\" (Replies to the Sixth Set of Objections in [55], vol. II, 297). Nothing is a material object, we are inclined to assert, if it is not 'extended' in these three dimensions. Shadows cast by our bodies and images projected on movie screens, while extended in two spatial dimensions, specifically, while having width and height, lack the third spatial dimension, viz. depth, and are thus not accorded the status of materiality, are not, that is, regarded as being material objects.\n\nBeing extended in three dimensions is not, however, a sufficient condition for being a physical object. It is merely a necessary condition. Reflections in mirrors are three dimensional; so are well-crafted projected holographic images. And yet neither reflections in mirrors nor projected holographic images are material objects. Clearly something more, besides being extended in three spatial dimensions, is required for something to count as being a bona fide material object.\n\nWhat is the difference between – let us use as our example – a real (physical or material) chair and its reflection, both of which are extended in three dimensions? The crucial difference is that although the real chair and its reflection in a mirror are both visible, only the former is tangible. Put another way, we can say that although both the {page 181} real chair and its reflection exist in visual space, only the real chair, not its reflection, exists in tactile space. There are in this example two conceptually distinct spaces: that of sight and that of touch. There are, to be sure, remarkable correlations between the two, but the two spaces remain, nonetheless, conceptually distinct. Indeed each and every sensory mode may be regarded as giving us access to a 'space': there is the space of sight; of touch; of hearing; of temperature; etc.18\n\n18. \"Older babies live more and more in a world in which the information from the senses is separated into a visual world [i.e. a visual space], an auditory world [space], and a tactual world [space]\" ([32], 47).\n\nWhatever correlations there are in the data across sensory spaces (visual-auditory; visual-tactile; etc.) are both contingent and knowable only by experience (i.e. knowable only a posteriori*). As infants we had to learn by trial and error the connection between the visual and the tactile.19 We had to learn that if something felt a certain way, then it would (probably) look a certain way, and that if something looked a certain way, then it would (probably) feel a certain way. Persons born blind who, by surgery, have acquired sight as adults find that it takes them some months before they are able, using their eyes, to recognize objects which are perfectly familiar to their hands.20 As adults, they have had to learn over a period of months, as the rest of us did as {page 182} infants, how to map the data of the visual and the tactile sensory modes back and forth.\n\n19. One of the most surprising findings of experimental psychology is that newborns, in contrast to six-month-old infants, have an ability to reach directly for objects in their visual and auditory fields. Even blind newborns \"stare at their hands, tracking them with their unseeing eyes\" ([32], 69). But these sorts of innate abilities, strangely, seem to fade as the child grows during the first year, and come to be replaced in the second half-year after birth by learned hand movements guided initially by eye, and later, kinesthetically. These totally unexpected findings provide a good object lesson against trying to do science in an a priori manner. Once again, we see how the world often frustrates our naive anticipations of its manner of working.\n\n20. In 1693, William Molyneux (1656-98) wrote to John Locke posing the following question (which has since come to be known as \"Molyneux's problem\"): \"Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere. ... Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man made to see. ... [I pose the following question:] whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?\" ([124], book II, chap. IX, §8). Molyneux and Locke both agreed the newly sighted adult would not be able immediately to make the connection between his visual and tactile data. Their scientific instincts were to prove correct. Modern empirical research has confirmed their prediction (see, e.g. [218], 204, and [83]).\n\nIn talking and writing uncritically of space, we habitually overlook the differences between visual space and tactile space. But occasional exceptions remind us that there really is not just a theoretical difference between these two spaces, but a real one. Persons born blind have no experience of the features of visual space. But they can detect the features of tactile space. They can tell, by feeling physical things, what their shapes are, how large they are, whether they are rough or smooth, hard or soft, and where they are positioned in relation to other physical objects.21 For the sighted, shadows and holographic images occur in visual space but not in tactile space. And for all of us – sighted and sightless alike – there is at least the logical possibility, as is so often featured in fiction, of invisible objects: things which are detectable tactilely but not visually.\n\n21. They can also tell, with their fingers, whether something is hot or cold. But the temperature of things is not usually considered to be a tactile property, even though the nerve endings which are sensitive to temperature are located within our skins alongside our organs of touch.\n\nNonetheless, in spite of the real differences between visual and tactile space, there is – for the normally sighted among us – such a good mapping between the contents of these two spaces that we tend naively to regard these two spaces as one, real, unified, objective public space. We operate with the assumption that if something appears in visual space, then it occurs in tactile space as well, and conversely.\n\nBut it must be understood that this assumption of a single, unified space of sight and touch, handy as it is, is warranted by contingent facts about this particular possible world. It is not especially difficult to imagine how those facts could be otherwise. With a little ingenuity, we can invent possible-worlds tales in which the enormously useful correlation we find between the visual and tactile in this world simply does not exist. We can describe possible worlds in which your visual data bear little if any detectable correlation with the data furnished by your tactile senses. We can imagine a world, for example, where your hands inform you that you are feeling a teakettle in the cupboard beside the stove, but where your eyes, at that very moment, tell you that you are looking at a distant catamaran hauled up onto the sand of {page 183} a windswept beach. Such a tale is merely an extension of the sorts of stories which are actually true of our visual and auditory senses. I am now looking through an open window and can see rain falling outside. At the same time, I am also hearing Beethoven's Archduke Trio (there is a recording playing in the adjoining room). I – like you – have no difficulty living simultaneously in the two, often disparate, sensory spaces of sight and sound. The correlation between the two is often exceedingly poor. And from such an example, we can see how it could be (i.e. how it is logically possible) that the correlation between the visual and the tactile might be equally poor.\n\nThe things we standardly regard as being material objects typically exist in (at least) two sensory spaces: the visual and the tactile. Is one of these two spaces more fundamental in our attributing materiality to a thing? Would we be inclined to attribute materiality to something which was visible but not (even in principle) tangible? Would we be inclined to attribute materiality to something tangible but which was invisible? I think the answer is fairly clear. 'Merely visible' things, e.g. shadows, reflections in mirrors, projected holographic images, are standardly regarded as nonphysical.22 In contrast, were we to find a region of space where our hands, sonar, etc. told us there was an object, but where our eyes were unable to detect anything, we would come, especially if the same results were obtained by other persons as well, to regard that place as being occupied by an invisible physical object.\n\n22. The list of my examples may be contested. Some writers place reflections in mirrors in a different category than shadows and holograms. They argue that in viewing a reflection in a mirror, e.g. of a chair, one is seeing a material object, viz. the chair, only one is seeing it in a somewhat misleading way, i.e. as if it were in a place where it is not in fact. Nothing I am saying depends on how we choose to describe reflections in mirrors. Reflected images are merely presented as a putative example of intangible visual data. If reflections are not to be accorded this status, then – for the purposes of illustration – there are others: holograms and afterimages might serve nicely.\n\nGranted, I may be misjudging the pre-analytic inclinations of other persons. I am, to be sure, depending heavily on assessments of how I actually use the concept of material object in typical cases and of how I would use that concept in unusual cases. I am assuming, as a speaker and writer of a commonly shared language and of a more-or-less commonly shared conceptual scheme, that my own use is fairly typical and that my own leanings in this matter are reasonably representative of {page 184} those of most other persons. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that I have diagnosed correctly both my own and other persons' weighting of the various criteria for invoking the concept of material object: that most of us, if it came to having to choose between the tactile and the visual as being more fundamental to the concept of materiality, would choose the former. If this is in fact true, might there be any explanation for it? Or, is"
