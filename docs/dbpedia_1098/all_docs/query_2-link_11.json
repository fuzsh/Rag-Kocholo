He is known for the huge role he played in the renaissance of British physics in the post-WWII era, both through his own work and that of his extremely influential school of students which he created.\n\nHe mentored and supervised over 70 PhD students, of whom were: Stephen Hawking; George F. R. Ellis; Brandon Carter (formulator of the Anthropic Principle in cosmology); and David Deutch (the founding father of quantum computing).\n\nJerrier A. Haddad (1922-2017)\n\nCo-developer of IBM’s First Commercial Scientific Computer\n\nThe son of the prominent Syrian writer Abd al-Masih Haddad, Jerrier was a US-born pioneer computer engineer at the multinational technology company of IBM, he co-developed and designed IBM’s first commercial scientific computer, the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which was also its first mass-produced mainframe computer.\n\nHe was also the co-developer of IBM 604, the world’s first mass-produced programmable electronic calculator. During his journey, he secured 19 patents in the computer and electronics fields.\n\nFrank Harary (1921-2005)\n\nThe Father of Modern Graph Theory\n\nBorn in the US to a Jewish family originally from Syria, Frank was widely recognized as the father of Modern Graph Theory, a theory he helped found and popularize through the 700 academic papers he wrote and/or contributed to, in addition to 8 books he wrote or co-authored.\n\nAmong other things, Harary is credited with the invention of the signed graph, a type of mathematical structure in which each edge is assigned a positive or negative sign. This concept has proved to be a useful tool for sociological and psychological research, in addition to being useful for the fields of physics and chemistry.\n\nJorge Sahade (1915–2012)\n\nFirst Latin American to Become President of the IAU\n\nAn Argentine-born internationally recognized astronomer who was the first Latin American to become the president of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) from 1985 to 1988, a union in which he had held many other prestigious positions. In the Argentinian Capital, he established the Institute of Astronomy and Physics of Space within the University of Buenos Aires and was its first director.\n\nSahade was extremely dedicated to the promotion and development of astronomy in Argentina and Latin America, his efforts eventually led to the establishment of the Latin American League of Astronomy.\n\nAyah Bdeir (born in 1982)\n\nOne of the World’s Leaders of the Open Source Hardware Movement\n\nBorn in Lebanon to a Syrian family, Ayah is an entrepreneur, inventor, and interactive artist.
