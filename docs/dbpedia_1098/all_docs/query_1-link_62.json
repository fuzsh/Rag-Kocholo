        "text": "Cells send messages to their neighbours through ‘junctional complexes’, which link molecules on the cell surface to the cytoskeleton beneath. One of the proteins that forms these complexes, CASK, is now shown to travel from the cell surface to the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression by binding to DNA.\n\nThis week Daedalus extends his idea of teleomere-depleted ova, which produce pets with predictable life spans, to animal husbandry. He sees the humane possibilities of meat production which uses such animals — instead of having to be slaughtered, they will drop dead at a predetermined time.\n\nMale long-tailed dance flies (Rhamphomyia longicauda) prefer to mate with females with swollen abdomens, possibly because they relate large abdomen size to egg maturity. But the females cheat the males into picking them for mating: they puff up their abdomens with air, presumably making the males think that their eggs are more mature than they really are.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between quantum and classical ignorance. We take it for granted that we can erase classical information, but deletion of unknown quantum states is not possible. This result complements the ‘no-cloning’ rule that says it is impossible to copy an unknown quantum state perfectly.\n\nWhat happens in the brain when we pay attention to one stimulus — say tactile or visual — and ignore the others that are bombarding our senses? Individual neurons can fire at different rates, and thereby convey information to other neurons. But the degree of synchrony in the firing of groups of neurons may also matter, and this principle is implicated in the process of attention.\n\nThere are two parts to Antarctica, East and West. A central question in reconstructing global plate-tectonic history has been what amount of movement there has been between them in the past 80 million years or so. New data from geophysical surveys allows firm bounds to be put upon the extent of motion, and thereby more rigorous estimates to be incorporated into the ‘plate-motion circuit’ used to calculate the Earth's tectonic history.\n\nThe peak in recovery of biodiversity seems to lag the peak of anextinction by about ten million years. This pattern is independent of theseverity of extinction, implying that recoveries create new ecological opportunities.\n\nMelting is a familiar process not expected to show surprises: the melting of ice in a cocktail is expected to produce cooling not heating. Yet just such an effect — inverse melting — has been seen during a study of phase transitions in a polymeric system. As a result the crystalline phase appears to be more disordered than the glassy phase.\n\nCertain white blood cells home in on pathogens attacking the body by following gradients of chemoattractant to their targets. Cell movement in this chemotactic process requires extension of the cell's leading edge. That, it now emerges, stems from generation of lipid signals by an enzyme called phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase. The result is a highly polarized signalling cascade which leads to directed movement.\n\nThe use of molecules in electronic devices is expected to play a role in the future miniaturization of electronics. A device that uses molecular layers (rather than individual molecules) to control electrical behaviour represents a new approach to ‘molecular electronics’, because control is achieved indirectly without any electrons passing through the molecules.\n\nFemale mallards find some males more attractive than others. If they mate with 'preferred' males, female ducks seem to produce more surviving offspring. It appears that this may occur not because the attractive males have better genes, but because the females invest more in their offspring, producing bigger eggs than if they had mated with less attractive males.\n\nThe DREADCO team is attempting to create pets with a short shelf life. The idea is to shorten the teleomeres at the ends of the pets' chromosomes, thereby encouraging a shorter life span. This would be the answer to all those pets bought as Christmas presents, but who are unwanted by Easter.\n\nThe surface of Mars is abnormally rich in sulphur, but where it came from has been something of a mystery. Work on the isotopic composition of sulphur in martian meteorites now implicates atmospheric processes in the surface sulphur enrichment. The evidence for this conclusion has a further edge to it. It implies that the large shifts in isotopic ratios produced by living organisms are not necessarily characteristic of life.\n\nWhat caused the great ice ages? Accurate dating of the end of one of these ice ages makes us reconsider which part of the climate system drives severe glaciation.\n\nWe live in a world with four observable dimensions (three of space and one of time). Physicists have long proposed extra dimensions as a way of unifying particle physics with gravity. It may now be possible to have an extra dimension of infinite extent (rather than a compact one as previously thought), provided that space–time is curved in a certain way.\n\nMutations in the p53 protein or components of the pathway that regulates it are one of the main causes of cancer – normally, p53 prevents cells that have been damaged from contributing to tumour formation. Now another function of p53 emerges. It seems that the protein also participates in the process of DNA repair itself.\n\nMost animals and plants show circadian rhythms – behavioural or physiological cycles tied to a 24-hour clock. These cycles are controlled by internal clocks that are 'entrained' to external time by daylight. It has now been shown that the circadian clocks in the heart or kidney cells of zebrafish can respond directly to light, without any input from the visual system.\n\nImages of the brain taken using scanning techniques are usually static – they represent activity at a single moment in time. But neurons in the brain show temporal patterns of activity, as well as spatial patterns. Now the dynamics of neural activity have been studied in people listening to sequences of musical notes. The technique shows that different brain areas fire more synchronously in response to melodic sequences than they do in response to random notes."
