        "text": "This regional symposium will convene legal experts, space scientists and engineers, industry and policy makers to discuss issues around space use and regulation in a time of rapid expansion in the space sector. As a thriving sector, the space industry has seen extraordinary growth over the last decade, trebling in size. The industry currently generates an income of £16.5bn annually and employs over 47,000 people. This growth has in turn raised regulatory challenges for the industry, and the UK has ambitions to lead in this field.\n\nThe symposium is a collaboration between the University of Portsmouth’s Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation and the Faculty of Business and Law and will be co-hosted by Space South Central Enterprise Network (SSC). The SSC is the largest regional space cluster in the UK between industry and academics, designed to accelerate space business growth, foster an environment of innovation, grow the reputation of the south-central region, and contribute to national prosperity. The symposium will address a range of space-related themes including rights and responsibilities, debris and infrastructural resilience and safety.\n\nThis is an in-person event and free of charge. Lunch and refreshments will be included.\n\nConfirmed speakers are:\n\n- Dr Colin Baldwin (UK Space Trade Association)\n\n- Prof Marco Pedrazzi (University of Milan; Space Law Committee of the International Law Association)\n\n- Dr Thomas Cheney (Northumbria University)\n\n- Prof Chris Newman (Northumbria University)\n\n- Dr Damian Bielicki (Kingston University)\n\n- Dr Inesa Kostenko (University of Leicester)\n\nIf you have any further questions or queries please contact daniel.smith@port.ac.uk or info@spacesouthcentral.com."
