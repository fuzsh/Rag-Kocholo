        "text": "Professor Eiichiro Komatsu\n\nEichiro Komatsu is a theoretical and observational cosmologist and Director of the Physical Cosmology division at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany. He studies cosmic inflation, the cosmic microwave background, the large-scale structure of the Universe, and why its expansion is accelerating. Professor Komatsu became fascinated by astronomy while at school and went on to study astronomy at the Tohoku University in Japan, graduating with his PhD thesis on “The Pursuit of Non-Gaussian Fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background” in 2001. While working on his thesis, he joined the WMAP science team at Princeton, and then became an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Texas. In 2010 he became director of the Texas Cosmology Center, an interdisciplinary centre to study the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the origin of matter in the universe and how structures formed and evolved. He moved to the Max Planck Institute in 2012.\n\nHe has received many awards, particularly recognising his leading work on the WMAP satellite project. From the Astronomical Society of Japan, he received the Young Astronomers Award in 2004 and the Chushiro Hayashi Prize in 2014. He received the Nishinomiya-Yukawa Memorial Prize for physics for his studies of the early universe in 2010 and he was awarded the American Astronomical Society Berkeley Prize in 2013. Together with the WMAP team, he shared the Gruber Prize in 2012 and the Breakthrough Prize in 2017.\n\nProfessor Sir Roger Penrose FRS OM\n\nAfter achieving a first-class degree in mathematics from University College London, Roger Penrose undertook a PhD at Cambridge, while at St John’s College, finishing in 1958. He subsequently became a Research Fellow at St John’s. His work in algebraic geometry led him to positions at Princeton, Syracuse, King's College London and, in 1964, to a Readership at Birkbeck College. Two years later he became Professor of Applied Mathematics there. In 1973 he was appointed Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford.\n\nAfter making outstanding achievements in pure mathematics, in the 1960s he started applying his ideas to astrophysics, influenced by Denis Sciama. In 1964, he was the first person to show that the formation of black holes was unavoidable in Einstein’s general theory of relativity. In 1969, with Stephen Hawking, he proved that all matter within a black hole collapses to a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume. He went on to postulate the cosmic censorship conjecture and the theory of twistors."
