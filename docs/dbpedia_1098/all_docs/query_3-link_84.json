        "text": "To start the new year, I provide a link to a discussion I had with Simon White on Phil Halper’s YouTube channel:\n\nIn this post I’ll say little that we don’t talk about, but will add some background and mildly amusing anecdotes. I’ll also try addressing the one point of factual disagreement. For the most part, Simon & I entirely agree about the relevant facts; what we’re discussing is the interpretation of those facts. It was a perfectly civil conversation, and I hope it can provide an example for how it is possible to have a positive discussion about a controversial topic+ without personal animus.\n\nFirst, I’ll comment on the title, in particular the “vs.” This is not really Simon vs. me. This is a discussion between two scientists who are trying to understand how the universe works (no small ask!). We’ve been asked to advocate for different viewpoints, so one might call it “Dark Matter vs. MOND.” I expect Simon and I could swap sides and have an equally interesting discussion. One needs to be able to do that in order to not simply be a partisan hack. It’s not like MOND is my theory – I falsified my own hypothesis long ago, and got dragged reluctantly into this business for honestly reporting that Milgrom got right what I got wrong.\n\nFor those who don’t know, Simon White is one of the preeminent scholars working on cosmological computer simulations, having done important work on galaxy formation and structure formation, the baryon fraction in clusters, and the structure of dark matter halos (Simon is the W in NFW halos). He was a Reader at the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge where we overlapped (it was my first postdoc) before he moved on to become the director of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics where he was mentor to many people now working in the field.\n\nThat’s a very short summary of a long and distinguished career; Simon has done lots of other things. I highlight these works because they came up at some point in our discussion. Davis, Efstathiou, Frenk, & White are the “gang of four” that was mentioned; around Cambridge I also occasionally heard them referred to as the Cold Dark Mafia. The baryon fraction of clusters was one of the key observations that led from SCDM to LCDM.\n\nThe subject of galaxy formation runs throughout our discussion. It is always a fraught issue how things form in astronomy. It is one thing to understand how stars evolve, once made; making them in the first place is another matter. Hard as that is to do in simulations, galaxy formation involves the extra element of dark matter in an expanding universe. Understanding how galaxies come to be is essential to predicting anything about what they are now, at least in the context of LCDM*. Both Simon and I have worked on this subject our entire careers, in very much the same framework if from different perspectives – by which I mean he is a theorist who does some observational work while I’m an observer who does some theory, not LCDM vs. MOND.\n\nWhen Simon moved to Max Planck, the center of galaxy formation work moved as well – it seemed like he took half of Cambridge astronomy with him. This included my then-office mate, Houjun Mo. At one point I refer to the paper Mo & I wrote on the clustering of low surface brightness galaxies and how I expected them to reside in late-forming dark matter halos**. I often cite Mo, Mao, & White as a touchstone of galaxy formation theory in LCDM; they subsequently wrote an entire textbook about it. (I was already warning them then that I didn’t think their explanations of the Tully-Fisher relation were viable, at least not when combined with the effect we have subsequently named the diversity of rotation curve shapes.)\n\nWhen I first began to worry that we were barking up the wrong tree with dark matter, I asked myself what could falsify it. It was hard to come up with good answers, and I worried it wasn’t falsifiable. So I started asking other people what would falsify cold dark matter. Most did not answer. They often had a shocked look like they’d never thought about it, and would rather not***. It’s a bind: no one wants it to be false, but most everyone accepts that for it to qualify as physical science it should be falsifiable. So it was a question that always provoked a record-scratch moment in which most scientists simply freeze up.\n\nSimon was one of the first to give a straight answer to this question without hesitation, circa 1999. At that point it was clear that dark matter halos formed central density cusps in simulations; so those “cusps had to exist” in the centers of galaxies. At that point, we believed that to mean all galaxies. The question was complicated by the large dynamical contribution of stars in high surface brightness galaxies, but low surface brightness galaxies were dark matter dominated down to small radii. So we thought these were the ideal place to test the cusp hypothesis.\n\nWe no longer believe that. After many attempts at evasion, cold dark matter failed this test; feedback was invoked, and the goalposts started to move. There is now a consensus among simulators that feedback in intermediate mass galaxies can alter the inner mass distribution of dark matter halos. Exactly how this happens depends on who you ask, but it is at least possible to explain the absence of the predicted cusps. This goes in the right direction to explain some data, but by itself does not suffice to address the thornier question of why the distribution of baryons is predictive of the kinematics even when the mass is dominated by dark matter. This is why the discussion focused on the lowest mass galaxies where there hasn’t been enough star formation to drive the feedback necessary to alter cusps. Some of these galaxies can be described as having cusps, but probably not all. Thinking only in those terms elides the fact that MOND has a better record of predictive success. I want to know why this happens; it must surely be telling us something important about how the universe works.\n\nThe one point of factual disagreement we encountered had to do with the mass profile of galaxies at large radii as traced by gravitational lensing. It is always necessary to agree on the facts before debating their interpretation, so we didn’t press this far. Afterwards, Simon sent a citation to what he was talking about: this paper by Wang et al. (2016). In particular, look at their Fig. 4:\n\nThis plot quantifies the mass distribution around isolated galaxies to very large scales. There is good agreement between the lensing observations and the mock observations made within a simulation. Indeed, one can see an initial downward bend corresponding to the outer part of an NFW halo (the “one-halo term”), then an inflection to different behavior due to the presence of surrounding dark matter halos (the “two-halo term”). This is what Simon was talking about when he said gravitational lensing was in good agreement with LCDM.\n\nI was thinking of a different, closely related result. I had in mind the work of Brouwer et al. (2021), which I discussed previously. Very recently, Dr. Tobias Mistele has made a revised analysis of these data. That’s worthy its own post, so I’ll leave out the details, which can be found in this preprint. The bottom line is in Fig. 2, which shows the radial acceleration relation derived from gravitational lensing around isolated galaxies:\n\nThis plot quantifies the radial acceleration due to the gravitational potential of isolated galaxies to very low accelerations. There is good agreement between the lensing observations and the extrapolation of the radial acceleration relation predicted by MOND. There are no features until extremely low acceleration where there may be a hint of the external field effect. This is what I was talking about when I said gravitational lensing was in good agreement with MOND, and that the data indicated a single halo with an r-2 density profile that extends far out where we ought to see the r-3 behavior of NFW.\n\nThe two plots above use the same method applied to the same kind of data. They should be consistent, yet they seem to tell a different story. This is the point of factual disagreement Simon and I had, so we let it be. No point in arguing about the interpretation when you can’t agree on the facts.\n\nI do not know why these results differ, and I’m not going to attempt to solve it here. I suspect it has something to do with sample selection. Both studies rely on isolated galaxies, but how do we define that? How well do we achieve the goal of identifying isolated galaxies? No galaxy is an island; at some level, there is always a neighbor. But is it massive enough to perturb the lensing signal, or can we successfully define samples of galaxies that are effectively isolated, so that we’re only looking at the gravitational potential of that galaxy and not that of it plus some neighbors? Looks like there is some work left to do to sort this out.\n\nStepping back from that, we agreed on pretty much everything else. MOND as a fundamental theory remains incomplete. LCDM requires us to believe that 95% of the mass-energy content of the universe is something unknown and perhaps unknowable. Dark matter has become familiar as a term but remains a mystery so long as it goes undetected in the laboratory. Perhaps it exists and cannot be detected – this is a logical possibility – but that would be the least satisfactory result possible: we might as well resume counting angels on the head of a pin.\n\nThe community has been working on these issues for a long time. I have been working on this for a long time. It is a big problem. There is lots left to do.\n\n+I get a lot of kill the messenger from people who are not capable of discussing controversial topics without personal animus. A lot – inevitably from people who know assume they know more about the subject than I do but actually know much less. It is really amazing how many scientists equate me as a person with MOND as a theory without bothering to do any fact-checking. This is logical fallacy 101.\n\n*The predictions of MOND are insensitive to the details of galaxy formation. Though of course an interesting question, we don’t need that in order to make predictions. All we need is the mass distribution that the kinematics respond to – we don’t need to know how it got that way. This is like the solar system, where it suffices to know Newton’s laws to compute orbits; we don’t need to know how the sun and planets formed. In contrast, one needs to know how a galaxy was assembled in LCDM to have any hope of predicting what its distribution of dark matter is and then using that to predict kinematics.\n\n**The ideas Mo & I discussed thirty years ago have reappeared in the literature under the designation “assembly bias.”"
