        "text": "Latest News\n\nJanuary/February\n\nIS are upgrading the Cisco network switches that SCIAMA uses to connect to the outside world. This upgrade will temporarily disrupt connection to SCIAMA's login nodes and Jupyterhub server for a few minutes. Actual date to be confirmed.\n\n5th September\n\nWe have a critical hardware failure on SCIAMA which requires urgent replacement. This requires us to stop lustre and take the users' home directories offline. We have scheduled this for Monday 5th September. During the outage you will not be able to log on to SCIAMA or read/write any data to /mnt/lustre so we suggest you hold off running any further jobs until afterwards.\n\n6th May 2022\n\nNew Lustre storage has been installed and ready to use, please check the storage policy and contact sciama support to request disk space. The new compute and GPU nodes have also been installed, check the Using GPUs section for Slurm config.\n\nWe will be carrying out maintenance on SCIAMA in June and schedule regular maintenance windows in the future so please keep an look out for any updates/news for details. Read more\n\nNew SCIAMA hardware, comprising Lustre storage, CPU and GPU compute nodes, are being installed. SCIAMA will need to be updated to be able to use the new hardware.

It was built in 2011 and is currently in its fourth iteration. The cluster was named after Dennis Sciama, a leading figure in the development of astrophysics and cosmology, but it is also an acronym that stands for SEPnet Computing Infrastructure for Astrophysical Modelling and Analysis. It comprises:\n\n4672 cores\n\n1.8PB Lustre storage\n\n8 login nodes\n\n182 compute nodes\n\n8 A100 GPUs\n\n1 application (JupyterHub) node.\n\nPlease remember to acknowledge your usage of SCIAMA in your research. Details can be found here.\n\nCabinets housing Sciama hardware"
