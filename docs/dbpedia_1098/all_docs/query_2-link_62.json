        "text": "The Planetary Lunch Seminar Series (PLunch) is an informal seminar series with talks that are relevant to everybody with an interest in planetary science. Speakers include both members of the Cornell community and visitors. Talks are aimed to appeal to and presented by faculty members, research associates, and both graduate and undergraduate students from various academic departments. The seminars will be on every other Monday listed below at 12:15 pm in the Terzian Conference Room (Rm 622 Space Sciences Bldg). For a Zoom link, please contact Alexia Kubas (ak2248@cornell.edu).\n\nNOTE:\n\nAttendance is restricted to Cornell students, staff and faculty.\n\nAll Cornell community members should take personal responsibility and demonstrate COVID-19 etiquette.\n\nDate\n\nTopic\n\nSpeaker\n\nAug 26, 2024 Sep 9, 2024 Sep 23, 2024 Oct 7, 2024 Oct 21, 2024 Nov 4, 2024 Nov 18, 2024 Dec 2, 2024 Dec 9, 2024\n\nAstrophysics Lunch is a series of informal talks on topics related to theoretical astrophysics, gravitational physics, and cosmology. Speakers are free to present their own research or present papers that they find of particular interest. The audience consists of faculty members, research staff, as well as graduate and undergraduate students, so talks should be at a level accessible to most. Astrophysics Lunch is open to talks from all members of the Cornell community, as well as to visiting scientists. We will reschedule a local speaker in order to accommodate visitors.\n\nAstrophysics Lunch will be held on Wednesdays at 12:10 PM in the Terzian Conference Room (Rm 622). For a Zoom link, please contact Larry Kidder (kidder@astro.cornell.edu).\n\nNOTE:\n\nAttendance is restricted to Cornell students, staff and faculty.\n\nAll Cornell community members should take personal responsibility and demonstrate COVID-19 etiquette.\n\nDate Topic Speaker Aug 28, 2024 Sep 4, 2024 Sep 11, 2024 Sep 18, 2024 Sep 25, 2024 TBA Prof. Xing Wei (Beijing Normal U.)

Salpeter, one of the most important astrophysicists of the 20th century. Under the auspices of the lectureship, distinguished astronomers and astrophysicists are invited to visit Cornell for one to two weeks.\n\nFormer Salpeter Lecturers:\n\n1999 Sterl Phinney (CalTech)\n\n2000 Lars Bildsten (Univ.

Gordon, then professor of electrical engineering at Cornell, proposed the construction of the Arecibo telescope in 1958 to study the Earth's ionosphere via the incoherent scatter of powerful radio waves from the individual electrons in the ionospheric plasma. He also understood that the telescope would be able to make significant contributions to planetary science and the then relatively new field of radio astronomy. Gordon raised the funding for the telescope and organized its construction. Completed in 1963, the 305m (1000ft) diameter telescope and its powerful radar systems were continuously upgraded over the intervening years and were used to made major advances in the areas of ionospheric physics, radio astronomy and planetary science. Sadly, after fifty-seven years of ground-breaking contributions to astronomy, planetary science and ionospheric physics the telescope collapsed on December 1, 2020.\n\nThe Gordon Lectures are made possible by an endowment by Tom and Betty Talpey. Tom and Betty Talpey were one of the families that moved with the Gordon's to Arecibo in the summer of 1960 to supervise the telescope's construction and build the observing instrumentation.\n\nFormer Gordon Lecturers:\n\n2002 Harold Ewen (University of Massachusetts)\n\n2003 Tor Hagfors (Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy)\n\n2005 Gordon Pettengill (MIT)\n\n2006 Jocelyn Bell Burnell (University of Oxford)\n\n2008 Lewis Duncan (Rollins College)\n\n2009 Shri Kulkarni (Caltech)\n\n2011 Joint Lecture & Arecibo Observatory Staff Event:\n\nDonald Farley (Cornell University)\n\nMiguel Feyjoo (Engineer)\n\nHerbert Carlson (Utah State University)\n\nCarl Heiles (UC Berkeley)\n\nDonald B.
