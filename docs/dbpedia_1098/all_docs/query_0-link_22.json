        "text": "\"However bad life may seem, where there is life there is hope...\"\n\n—Stephen Hawking\n\nTHE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, directed by James Marsh, is the extraordinary and uplifting story of one of the world’s greatest living minds, the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, and of two people defying the steepest of odds through love…\n\nIn 1963, as a physics-cosmology student at the storied U.K. university Cambridge, Stephen [Eddie Redmayne] is making great strides and is determined to find a “simple, eloquent explanation” for the universe. His own world opens up when he falls deeply in love with an arts major, fellow Cambridge student Jane Wilde [Felicity Jones]. But, at 21 years of age, he receives an earth-shattering diagnosis: motor neuron disease will attack his limbs and his abilities, leaving him with limited speech and movement, and will likely take his life within two years.\n\nYet Jane’s love, fierce support and determination are unwavering, and they wed. With his new wife fighting tirelessly by his side, Stephen refuses to accept his diagnosis. Jane encourages Stephen to finish his doctorate, which includes his initial theory of the creation of the universe. They start a family and Stephen embarks on his most ambitious scientific work, studying the very thing he now has precious little of—time.\n\nAs his body faces more limits, his mind continues to explore the outer limits of theoretical physics. Together, he and Jane defy impossible odds, breaking new ground in medicine and science, and achieving more than they could ever have dreamed...\n\nDirector James Marsh talks with SET DECOR about the making of this beautiful film about two extraordinary people, the love they shared and the lives they led…"
