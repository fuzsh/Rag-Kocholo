        "text": "Family life\n\nBorn in Oxford, Stephen Hawking was the eldest of four children born to Frank and Isobel Hawking, both graduates of Oxford University in medicine and Philosophy, Politics and Economics respectively. The family later moved to St. Albans in Hertfordshire. From an early age, Hawking showed a passion for science and cosmology and was considered a bright, though a not an exceptional student, preferring to spend time on leisure activities.\n\nFrank wanted Stephen to study medicine at University College, Oxford, where he had got his own degree, seeing no career for Stephen in mathematics, his preferred choice. In 1959, at the age of 17, Hawking won a scholarship to study physics and chemistry at University College, since University College did not offer mathematics as an option at the time. He was considered a popular, witty, daredevil character who was keen on classical music, science fiction and was cox of the college rowing crew.\n\nHawking first met Jane Wilde in St Albans; she was a friend to his sister. Soon after Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) and though both Hawking and his father advised her to leave, the couple were married in 1965 and went on to have three children, the youngest adopted. It was only after the wedding that it became clear that Hawkingâs disease would not kill him within two years as initially suspected.\n\nCaring for her children and husband put huge pressure on Jane, particularly with Hawking travelling so much for work, including a year at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974. In 1977, Jane met Jonathan Hellyer JonesÂ at a choir she had joined. They developed romantic feelings for each other but were determined that the Hawking family would not be broken up. Jane is reported to have said that Hawking accepted the situation.\n\nIn 1985, Hawking had to have a tracheotomy to save his life after contracting pneumonia, but it cost him his voice. One of his first achievements after losing his voice was to draft A Brief History of Time for the general public. Published in 1988, the book sold around 10 million copies globally, introducing the concept of a universe made of strings, black holes, extra-dimensions and time travel. He became a household name, with his work made into a biographical movie, a television series and a number of other books for non-academics.\n\nIn February 1990 Hawking told his wife that he was leaving her to live with Mason, one of his nurses who had been caring for him since his tracheotomy, whom he married after his divorce from Jane in 1995. He and Mason divorced in 2006.\n\nHawking died in 2018, on the same date that Albert Einstein was born, 14 March.\n\nAcademic life\n\nHawking was awarded a first-class honours degree in 1962, despite being an unfocused student. This led to him being offered a place at Trinity Hall at Cambridge University for a PhD in cosmology in the autumn of that year where his supervisor was the little-known Dennis Sciama, who was to become one of the founders of modern cosmology. Sciamaâs knowledge and enthusiasm enabled Hawking to meet and work closely with others in the field.\n\nHawking became a member of the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge in 1968 and The Large-Scale Structure of Space-Time, written with G.F.R. Ellis, was published in 1973. In 1974, the announcement of Hawkingâs radiation theory led to him becoming a fellow of the Royal Society at the age of 32. He later received the Albert Einstein Award, among other honours. In 1977 he was appointed a professor in gravitational physics and two years later became Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University.\n\nWhen Cambridge University posted Hawking's 1965 doctoral thesis, \"Properties of Expanding Universes,\" to its website in October 2017, demand for access was so high that it crashed the university server.\n\nResearch on the Universe and Black Holes\n\nWhen Hawking was in his second year at Cambridge. Roger Penrose, another cosmologist, was also researching the creation of black holes (an object from which nothing can escape, not even light). Initially, Hawking and George Ellis, another PhD student at Cambridge, had worked together on a âsingularity theoremâ, but linking with Penrose, whose mathematical theorem of relevance, incorporating âcentral singularityâ suggested that the collapse of an over-massive star would result in a âblack holeâ.\n\nHawking also applied this thinking to the entire universe and ran time backwards, predicting that the Universe itself had originated from a singularity. The theory was the basis of his thesis, accepted in 1996. In 1970, Penrose and Hawking published an even more powerful theorem which incorporated almost all previous work in this area."
