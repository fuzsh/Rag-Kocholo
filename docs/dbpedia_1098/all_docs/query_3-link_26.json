        "text": "LETTERFrom Adrian L Melott The Theory of Everything is a well-acted film (a Hawking biography, for those who may have managed not to hear about it) which portrays scientists in a more realistic light than most films do. It is based on a memoir written by his first wife, and highlights her role in the struggle with his disability.\n\nIt does, however, severely minimize and distort the role of Dennis Sciama, Hawking's doctoral supervisor. Dennis is portrayed as a cartoon character, at first a kind of authoritarian gatekeeper, who gradually develops affection for Stephen as he begins to regard him as a colleague. It is understandable that his role would not be portrayed realistically by people who were not involved in research.\n\nDennis was much more than that portrayal suggests: he was a superb mentor who brought out the best from his students. He cleverly never directly tried to motivate them, but rather responded masterfully and encouragingly when they moved forward. As was relayed to me, after Stephen's diagnosis and some time in depression, he said to him words like, “Well, you're not dead yet. So, are you ready to work on that problem I suggested?” The rest is history. I believe the history could not have been the same without the constant interaction and feedback typical of Dennis.\n\nI am not alone in this regret. Arnold Wolfendale told me: “I'm glad that you have set the record straight about Dennis Sciama. He, Dennis, was a great help to me in the 1970s when I was endeavouring to change the direction of Durham's research towards astronomy and astrophysics. I found him to be very co-operative, friendly, unassuming and clever.”\n\nIn the film he merely sits and waits for the equations to appear. In real life, Dennis was all about conversation and encouragement about the ideas. I wish that his legacy would have been strengthened by the film.\n\nAdrian L Melott, Dept of Physics and Astronomy, University of Kansas, USA\n\n© 2015 Royal Astronomical Society"
