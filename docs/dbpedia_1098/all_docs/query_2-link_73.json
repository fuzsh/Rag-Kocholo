        "text": "The Theory of Everything tells the true story of when famous physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) met his first wife Jane (Felicity Jones), fell in love, and dealt with a devastating medical condition. This ranked list article features the best quotes from the film that beautifully capture the essence of this remarkable true story. Released in 2014 and directed by James Marsh, the movie was a biographical drama based on Jane Hawking's memoir, Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, and was a critical and commercial success. The film follows the journey of Stephen Hawking, a young doctoral student at Cambridge University, who meets Jane Wilde and falls in love, eventually leading to marriage alongside a number of major obstacles. As Stephen delves into his research on space and time, he faces challenges with his motor skills, leading to a life-altering diagnosis of a motor neuron disease. Despite being told he has only two years to live, Jane stands by his side, showcasing their resilience, love in the face of adversity, and commitment to sticking together through thick and thin.\n\nAudiences witness the budding relationship, as the pair discuss theories of space and time with Stephen posing, “Wind back the clock until you get a universe born from a black hole exploding\" and quipping, “It is a kind of religion for intelligent atheists,” as he explains the science of cosmology. The dialogue through the film also provides insight into Stephen's humor (saying “I was stopped recently by a tourist at Cambridge who asked if I was the real Stephen Hawking. I replied I was not, and said the real one was much better looking,” as he speaks to a crowd) and allows others, like Dennis Sciama, to reflect on his accomplishments and defiance of expectations: \"It has been a great joy to watch this man defy every expectation both scientific and personal.”\n\nSome of the most memorable and inspirational quotes from the movie are about moments of love, perseverance, and hope. Each quote showcases the emotional depth and complexity of the characters, making them stand out as some of the best in cinematic history. From declarations of love to profound reflections on life, these quotes have a strong impact and resonate with audiences long after the credits roll.\n\nAs you read through the list of the best quotes from The Theory of Everything, take a moment to reflect on the powerful messages and themes portrayed in the film. Vote for your favorite quotes and relive the magic of this touching and inspiring story."
