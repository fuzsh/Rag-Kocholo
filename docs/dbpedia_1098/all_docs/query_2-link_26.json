        "text": "Sir Roger Penrose finally won the Nobel prize in 2020, at the ripe old age of 89 after an illustrious and varied research career. Given his phenomenal accomplishments, it may come as a surprise to many to know that this brilliant mathematician and physicist had difficulty with math classes in school. A math teacher in a lower grade had even decided to demote him because he was having trouble with mental arithmetic. Penrose says that it was not that he was bad at math; he just had trouble memorizing the tables. But he could do multiplications in other ways that invariably took more time. Later, an insightful teacher figured out that Penrose was bright but slow. So then he started giving him as much time as he needed in his exams and Penrose did really well.\n\nLater in his life, Penrose ran into another great mentor who changed the course of his life. Dennis Sciama, a physicist at Cambridge and a friend of his elder brother, encouraged him to shift from mathematics to physics: “What are you doing with this pure mathematics nonsense. Come and work on physics and cosmology.”. The name Sciama might not sound familiar, but you must have heard of a student who completed his PhD under him: Stephen Hawking. Penrose himself completed his PhD under mathematician John Todd, but it was his interactions with Sciama that set him up for a future Nobel prize.\n\nSciama was one of the three great mentors of the golden age of black hole research, as described by Kip Thorne in his book Black Holes and Time Warps. The three mentors were Dennis Sciama from Cambridge, UK; John Wheeler from Princeton, USA and Yakov Zeldovich from Moscow, USSR. Thorne, Nobel laureate for his work on the LIGO gravitational detectors and the scientific brain behind the blockbuster Interstellar, calls them “master teachers”. But they were teachers with three very different styles: “Wheeler was a charismatic, inspirational visionary. Zel’dovich was the hard-driving player/coach of a tightly knit team. Sciama was a self-sacrificing catalyst.”\n\nSciama proved to be a very effective catalyst. Penrose says, “Sciama seemed to know everything that was going on in physics at the time, especially in cosmology, and he conveyed an infectious excitement to all who encountered him. He was also very effective in bringing together people who might have things of significance to communicate with one another.” According to Thorne, Sciama “had exquisitely good sense about what ideas were interesting, what issues were worth pursuing, what one should read in order to get started on any research project, and whom one should go to for technical advice.” He also notes how Sciama devoted two decades to developing an optimal research environment in his Cambridge research group, during which time his personal research was of second concern. As a result, Sciama never became a full Professor. But two of his students, Stephen Hawking and Martin Rees (Lord Martin Rees, the current Astronomer Royal of England), had become full Professors at Cambridge by the end of that period.\n\nThe second great mentor of the era was John Wheeler of Princeton, Thorne’s own PhD advisor. The name Wheeler might be familiar to physics students for his role in developing the liquid drop model of the nucleus. But not many know that he was the PhD advisor of celebrated physicist Richard Feynman. Later, during the golden age of black hole physics, he supervised many students who comprise the who’s who of the experts in general relativity and black hole thermodynamics of that generation. Wheeler was an inspirational teacher and a courageous explorer of outlandish ideas. He encouraged ideas that other scientists thought were pure nonsense, and many of these ideas have since become very fruitful. The prime example is the whole area of black hole thermodynamics. Wheeler posed the question of the fate of a cup of tea thrown down a black hole to Jacob Bekenstein, which led to Bekenstein developing the idea of black hole entropy. This was at a time when talking about the entropy and temperature of black holes was considered meaningless because nothing comes out of black holes. But Hawking proved within a couple of years that black holes could radiate, and the field of black hole thermodynamics was established. Thorne writes on Wheeler’s style of mentoring his students, “Wheeler offered his fledglings a philosophical ambience, a sense that there were exciting ideas all around, ready for the plucking; but he rarely pressed an idea, in concrete form, onto a student, and he absolutely never joined his students in exploiting their ideas. Wheeler’s paramount goal was the education of his fledglings, even if that slowed the pace of discovery… Wheeler seemed to us, his fledglings, the busiest man in the world; far too busy with his own projects to demand our attention. Yet he was always available at our request, to give advice, wisdom, encouragement.”\n\nThe third great mentor, Yakov Zeldovich, had wide interests and worked in a surprising variety of fields. As Varun Sahni, an Indian cosmologist who had been trained in Zeldovich’s group, notes, his career included “major contributions in fields as diverse as chemical physics (adsorption & catalysis), the theory of shock waves, thermal explosions, the theory of flame propagation, the theory of combustion & detonation, nuclear & particle physics, and, during the latter part of his life: gravitation,\n\nastrophysics and cosmology.” The story goes that Hawking, on meeting Zeldovich for the first time, is supposed to have remarked, “Now I know that you are a real person and not a group of scientists like the Bourbaki.” Perhaps Zeldovich is best known in the scientific community for his contributions in the area of astrophysics and cosmology, with his name immortalized through the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum, the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect, etc. The scientists Zeldovich mentored may not be familiar to the average science enthusiast, partly due to the difficulty in their earlier work permeating through to the west due to the iron curtain and the difference in language. Notable names are Igor Novikov, whom Thorne mentions extensively in his book, Rashid Sunyaev of the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect and Alexei Starobinsky, who may yet win a Nobel for his work on the theory of inflation in cosmology. Zeldovich had a mentoring style that differed from the patient pedagogy of the previous two, probably a natural style for someone who worked extensively on military projects in the Soviet system. Thorne contrasts his style with that of Wheeler, “Zeldovich whipped his team into shape with a firm hand, a constant barrage of his own ideas, and joint exploitation of his team’s ideas… [he] was on the telephone at ungodly hours of the morning, demanding attention, demanding interaction, demanding progress.” Lest Zeldovich be mistaken for an authoritarian, let me also provide here the first-hand view provided by Sahni. While Zeldovich often demolished silly ideas of senior scientists in a matter of minutes, Sahni remembers the many times he had blundered in Zeldovich’s presence only for Zeldovich to smile and patiently explain the mistakes. Sahni also notes how the students of Zeldovich developed varying styles, ranging from the rigorously mathematical to the highly intuitive. Zeldovich’s influence on his students is perhaps best captured by the statement of Andrei Sakharov, another great Russian physicist, that Zeldovich’s “effect on his pupils was remarkable; he often discovered in them a capacity for scientific creativity which without him would not have been realized or could have been realized only in part...” .\n\nAs in any other field, mentorship is a valuable resource in the field of science. It is a soft skill that is not easily measured. Further, the effects of mentorship may not be immediate and may be felt only years later. Thus, it is a challenge to not neglect this aspect of science in today’s world of impact factors and citation counts. On the other hand, the strength of mentorship lies in the fact that its effect can have a significant and persistent effect over long timescales and at large distances. As Claudio Bunster (Teitelboim), a protégé of Wheeler and the ‘T’ in BTZ black holes, writes about the institute he founded in Chile, “At latitude 40S there is a science institute where one can find the footprints of Wheeler in every corner.”"
