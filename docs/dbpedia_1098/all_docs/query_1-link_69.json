        "text": "The Critical Rationalist Vol. 03 No. 02 ISSN: 1393-3809 23-Sep-1998\n\nCopyright\n\nBibliography\n\nAuthor Information\n\nFrank J. Tipler is Professor of Mathematical Physics at Tulane University in New Orleans. He is the co-author of the acclaimed book The Anthropic Cosmological Principle, about the relationship between cosmology and intelligent life. He does research in two areas of physics: global general relativity, and the physics of computation. Global general relativity deals with the structure of the cosmos on the largest scales, and computation physics is concerned with the limits on computers imposed by the laws of physics. Tipler's conclusion that there are no ultimate limits to computation (or to the biosphere) is discussed in his recent book The Physics of Immortality, which was on the German best seller list for 15 weeks. Selected by the New York Times as one of the Notable Books of 1994, The Physics of Immortality has been translated into four languages in addition to English, and more than 200,000 copies are in print world wide.\n\nTipler was the post-doctoral student of four scholars: Abraham Taub, Ranier Sachs, Dennis Sciama, and John Wheeler. Taub was the post-doc of John von Neumann, who made the first American digital computer. Sachs was the Ph.D. student of P.G. Bergmann, who was the post-doc of Albert Einstein. Sciama's Ph.D. students include Stephen Hawking, and also Sir Martin Rees, the current Astronomer Royal of England. Wheeler, the man who named the \"black hole\", was the post-doc of Niels Bohr (Nobel Prize for the Bohr model of the atom), who was the post-doc of Ernest Rutherford (Nobel Prize for discovering the atomic nucleus), who was the student of J.J. Thompson (Nobel Prize for discovering the electron), who was the student of Lord Rayleigh (Nobel Prize for discovering Argon), who was the student of James Clerk Maxwell (Maxwell's equations). Wheeler's other students include Richard Feynman (Nobel Prize for quantum electrodynamics).\n\nTipler's web site, selected by USA Today as a Hot Web Site for the week of May 11, 1998, is:\n\nhttp://www.math.tulane.edu/faculty_html/tipler.html\n\nAddress: Frank J.
