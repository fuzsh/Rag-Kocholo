        "text": "More info:&nbsp external linkContact:&nbsp David WandsLocation:&nbsp Portsmouth, UK\n\nThe Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation (ICG) invites applications for a postdoctoral research fellowship in theoretical cosmology named in honour of the pioneering British cosmologist Dennis Sciama (1926-1999). We seek an outstanding postdoctoral scientist to work in collaboration with existing staff in the ICG. Applicants should have a record of high-quality research in theoretical cosmology and propose an original programme of research, complementary to existing research expertise in the ICG. A PhD and relevant research expertise is required. The post is for three years, starting on 1st October 2012.\n\nThe ICG consists of 12 academic staff, 13 postdoctoral researchers and 18 PhD students, and is a member of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III), the Dark Energy Survey, and the UK Low Frequency Array Consortium (LOFAR:UK). ICG researchers have access to the new 1000-core SCIAMA supercomputer at Portsmouth, as well as the UK National Cosmology Supercomputer Consortium (COSMOS). Many staff are also involved in many other on-going and planned astrophysical surveys. More information is available at http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/\n\nApplications (Application Form, CV, 3-page research proposal, names of 3 referees) should be sent by email to jobs[AT]port.ac.uk and copied to icg-admin[AT]port.ac.uk. Applicants should also arrange for up to three letters of reference to be sent by email to icg-admin[AT]port.ac.uk, to arrive by the closing date, 30th December 2011. Late applications may be considered until the post has been filled.\n\nInformal enquiries about this post can be made to david.wands[AT]port.ac.uk\n\nTo find out more about the University of Portsmouth and this role, visit www.port.ac.uk/vacancies and apply on-line.
