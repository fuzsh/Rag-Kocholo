My work utilises numerical simulations, novel statistical methods and artifical intelligence.\n\nBiography\n\nI joined the University of Portsmouth as a Dennis Sciama postdoctoral fellow in October 2022. Before this I completed a postdoctoral appointment at the University of Hertfordshire with Prof. James Geach, and a JSPS short-term fellowship at the University of Tokyo with Prof. Masami Ouchi.\n\nI completed my Ph.D. at the University of Sussex in July 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Peter Thomas and Prof. Stephen Wilkins.\n\nResearch interests\n\nMy research interests span a broad range of topics in galaxy evolution, though I am particularly focused on early galaxy formation in the first billion years after the big bang. This nascent period in the Universe's history is now being probed in unprecedented detail by a number of state of the art observatories, such as the James Webb Space telescope.\n\nI run and analyse large numerical cosmological simulations, creating mock observations of the real Universe to better understand the data, and understand the physical processes driving galaxy transformation. I also employ artifical intelligence techniques, using these to improve the performance of the simulations and reveal new insights."
