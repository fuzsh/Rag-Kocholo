Dennis Sciama was a British physicist. He is considered one of the fathers of modern cosmology.

His father, Abraham Sciama, was a textile businessperson, also from Manchester. His mother, Nelly Ades, was born in Cairo, Egypt. Both of them traced their roots to Aleppo, Syria.

The surname Sciama was originally spelled Shama, but the later spelling was adopted to conform better to the Latin alphabet.

Emanuel was the son of Abraham/Aaron Henriques Valentine and Julia/Judith Mordechai Mendoza. Frances was the daughter of Abraham Woolf and Elizabeth Samuel.
