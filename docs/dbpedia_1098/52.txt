Biography

Dennis Sciama is Notable.

Dennis was born in 1926. He passed away in 1999.[1] was an English physicist who, through his own work and that of his students, played a major role in developing British physics after the Second World War. He was the PhD supervisor to many famous physicists and astrophysicists, including John D. Barrow, David Deutsch, George F. R. Ellis, Stephen Hawking, Adrian Melott and Martin Rees, among others; he is considered one of the fathers of modern cosmology.

Sciama earned his PhD in 1953 at the University of Cambridge supervised by Paul Dirac, with a dissertation on Mach's principle and inertia. His work later influenced the formulation of scalar-tensor theories of gravity.

In 1959, Sciama married Lidia Dina, a social anthropologist, who survived him, along with their two daughters.

Sciama was a warm person with a love for the civilized things in life. He enjoyed good company, music, and opera, in the later part of his life often retreating to his flat in Venice where, with his wife Lydia, he enjoyed the Venetian lifestyle.
