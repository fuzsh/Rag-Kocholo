        "text": "The different types of suspension system in automobiles are as follows:\n\n1. Leaf Spring Suspension\n\nLeaf springs act as dampers, supporting an extensive weight. These are made of steel and can flex when a vehicle’s axle exerts pressure on them. Additionally, it can easily nullify the bumps that a vehicle encounters on the road. This, along with their high load-bearing capacity, makes leaf spring suspension ideally suited for in commercial vehicles.\n\n2. Trailing Arm Suspension\n\nOne end of this suspension type adheres to a damper and a rear axle, and the other end connects to the chassis of a vehicle. These are not at all suitable for supporting heavy-weight vehicles and are ideal for motorcycles.\n\n3. Non-Independent Suspension\n\nThere is a rigid axle connecting the left and right wheels. These are present in heavy vehicles such as SUVs and trucks.\n\n4. Independent Suspension\n\nIn this type, the left and right wheels are not connected and can move independently. Although their structure is complex, they offer a more damping effect. The arrangement of springs and dampers varies significantly with different types of independent suspensions.\n\n5. Double-Wishbone Suspension\n\nIt is so named because of its \"A\" – shaped wishbone-looking arms. These are only found with independent suspension. Double Wishbone Suspension maintain the stability of the vehicle and offer its passengers a comfortable ride because of greater control even at extreme speeds. An upgraded version of this suspension type is mainly used in sports cars and luxury cars.\n\n6. MacPherson Strut Suspension\n\nThese are low-cost and widely used suspension types in cars. The main reason behind its wide usage is that it is simple in design, easy to control, and provides extreme comfort to its passengers. Additionally, MacPherson Strut Suspension has a steering pivot, which is used as a front suspension. This type can be easily modified as per the need of the vehicle.\n\n7. Air Suspension\n\nIn place of conventional coils, this type of suspension uses bellows as dampers to compress air. It can easily support vehicles of a larger height. They can bear extreme loads and ensure a comfortable ride for their passengers and are extremely suitable for luxury cars.\n\n8. Multi-Link Suspension\n\nThe main reason behind the popularity of this suspension is its quality grip which makes it a preferred choice for vehicles travelling off-road. Multi-Link Suspension have the ability to balance almost every shock they encounter during their journey. Additionally, they aid a car in taking turns immensely by increasing its friction with the ground. They are generally found in premium quality cars as maintaining them is expensive."
