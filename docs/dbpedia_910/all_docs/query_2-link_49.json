        "text": "The evolutionary frontier of the four-wheel world is fuel economy. This is achieved by reducing the weight of vehicles, thanks in part to sandwich panels.\n\nWith a view to reducing fuel consumption for both the production of higher-performance, more sustainable electric vehicles and conventional cars, the use of lightweight panels helps to reduce the weight of the vehicle.\n\nCel produces customised shaped panels for the automotive market.\n\nWorking for the automotive industry, CEL can supply, subject to verification with the raw material supplier, MDS datasheets if requested by the customer.\n\nRVs, motorhomes and any home on wheels\n\nSandwich panels, available in a variety of materials, are used in the outfitting of imposing motorhomes and luxury motorhomes, which need to combine rigidity, lightness and safety.\n\nCEL offers services such as shaping, edging and insertion of the panels themselves, to produce elements as finished and ready for assembly as possible."
