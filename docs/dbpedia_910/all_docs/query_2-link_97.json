        "text": "2.4 . Experimental design\n\nAfter an individual fitting, all participants received one pair of each study shoe and were obliged to wear each type of shoe for at least two weeks at their workplaces prior to the respective measurements (habituation phase).\n\nAfter fitting the CUELA motion sensors and the associated shoe insoles, the insoles were calibrated in compliance with the manufacturer's guidelines, and the CUELA system was initialized. Standing upright (relaxed) was used as the reference posture and all angles in this position were defined as 0°. Insole calibrations and initializations of the CUELA system were made before each measurement.\n\nMotion and plantar pressure measurements were conducted on participants, who were equipped with the CUELA system and instructed to walk at a defined speed of 1.5 m/s (controlled by a metronome) along a 10 m level walkway (according to the protocol of Perry and Burnfield16)). Each participant performed one trial per pair of shoes and hence was measured altogether three times (in-between time intervals: approximately four weeks, because of the prior habituation phase (as described above) ). The level walkway was typical industrial concrete and made of magnesite screed.\n\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 200017).\n\nMotion analysis - gait\n\nWinter et al.18) measured RoMs during a completed stride cycle while walking with a natural cadence and reported a RoM of 32.79° for the hip joint and a RoM of 64.86° for the knee joint. This study found a slightly lower RoM of the hip joint and knee joint when wearing \"normal\" shoe 1, which could be associated with the fact that the participants were supposed to adapt their cadence to a predefined speed of 1.5 m/s. Surprisingly, the RoM of trunk inclination of the male participants in \"normal\" shoe 1 (19°) was more than twice as high as the RoM of female participants walking at approximately the same speed in normal sports shoes (9°) in a study of Li and Hong19). This suggests that the movement of the upper body was more pronounced in our cohort of male workers. This difference might be due to the shoes, due to a gender difference or, eventually, due to a selection bias. Unfortunately, our cohort did not include women, while the cohort of Li and Hong did not include men. Therefore, the question of gender differences needs to be addressed in future examinations.\n\nIn comparison to \"normal\" shoe 1, \"cushioned\" shoe 2 and rocker-bottom shoe 3 led to a relative backward tilt of the upper body (when regarding the mean value of the 50th percentile of trunk inclination). Li and Hong19) also reported a backward shift of trunk orientation when wearing negative-heeled shoes, a finding that is reflected in our results, as shoe 3 can be roughly described as having a negative heel. Similarly, other authors20) have found a backward shift of the trunk when participants wore rocker-bottom shoes. Surprisingly though, the cushioned shoe (shoe 2) showed approximately the same backwards shift of trunk inclination. In ergonomic workplace evaluation, trunk inclination is often used to characterize back loading21,22). While a forward lean of the trunk is believed to lead to postural strain and to be associated with back problems23,24), the backward shift while wearing shoes 2 or 3 might be beneficial for preventing back problems at the workplace.\n\nThe alterations in trunk inclination were accompanied by a decreased median hip flexion for shoes 2 and 3. The findings with regard to shoe 3 are in accordance with findings of Romkes et al.25) and Nigg et al.26), who examined rocker-bottom shoes in general and found a reduction of peak hip flexion and peak hip extension when compared with walking in shoes with a normal sole geometry. In contrast to the present study, subjects in the study of Romkes et al. were free to choose their own walking speed and therefore walked significantly slower due to a smaller stride length as well as a slight reduction in cadence. Again, the cushioned shoe 2 showed a similar influence on the gait pattern to shoe 3. Measurements have shown that lumbar vertebral posture is largely secondary to the postural relationship between the trunk and the hips27); therefore, a reclined trunk combined with decreased median hip flexion might also be able to prevent the occurrence of back complaints, as the angle between hip and trunk might be more stable.\n\nParticipants wearing \"normal\" shoe 1 showed a smaller RoM of the knee joint (62.3°) than the participants in the study of Winter (64.9°)18), but also compared to the participants in the study of Li and Hong19), who wore sports shoes (66.0°). Though the cushioned shoe 2 led to a significantly larger RoM of knee flexion (RoM shoe 2=64.0°), it was still slightly lower than the RoM found by Li and Hong. Larger RoMs of the knee joint are believed to be associated with an increased stride length28,29), and increased stride lengths increase ground reaction forces30). Nigg und Denoth (1980) showed for running subjects that these forces that function along the leg-axis are, in part, dependent on body mass and knee angle at contact31), which might be why persons with lower back problems avoid increased stride lengths32,33). Apart from ground reaction forces, stride length was also found to be associated with larger spinal rotations, a larger thorax-pelvis relative phase, and a lower pelvis-leg relative phase, while the thorax continues to counter-rotate with respect to the leg33). As cushioned shoes allow for increased stride length in healthy subjects, one could argue that cushioned shoes might also be beneficial for employees with episodes of back pain because they seem to reduce ground reaction forces and spinal rotation at normal stride length. However to the knowledge of the authors, this assumption has not yet been proven right. Furthermore, recent studies contradict the association between RoM of the knee and stride length and claim that stride length is rather associated with shoe weight, hip RoM, and rotational movements of the pelvis35).\n\nPlantar pressure distribution\n\nDifferent shoes led to differences in the distribution of peak plantar pressures. The highest peak pressures in the rear and forefoot area were measured when wearing shoe 1, which lacks additional cushioning elements; alternatively, these differences are associated with the differences in gait. Nevertheless, comparative studies have demonstrated that cushioning materials in safety shoes are advantageous when trying to reduce plantar pressure2,9,36). Due to a forefoot and rear foot cushioning element, shoe 2 showed lower pressure values with the exception of zone 6. In this area there was a transition area of the insole where a low shaped pad and a graphite point for electric static discharge were placed. This construction of the insole might have caused the high pressure values at a critical point, where the metatarsophalangeal joint is positioned. As higher pressure in the metatarsal region was found to be associated with foot/ankle disorders37), this finding is dissatisfying and the shoe construction should be altered. Additionally shoe 2 was associated with an increase in the RoM of the knee, which might in turn lead to longer steps. An increase in stride length was found to be associated with an increase in plantar pressure38); therefore, the cushioning effect of shoe 2 might have been even more pronounced when controlling for the step length. Plantar pressure distributions in shoe 3 were more equally distributed to the three foot regions (rear, middle, and forefoot), with the exception of zone 8 (toes), where maximum pressure values were significantly higher in shoe 3 (rocker-bottom shoe) than in the other shoes. These results are explained by the findings of Stewart et al.39) that the sloping design of the shoe base displaces the weight away from the heel. The lower pressure values under the midfoot and heel were a result of the shift in weight towards the front end of the foot. Accordingly, the CoP in posterior-anterior direction was clearly shorter when walking in shoe 3 (rocker-bottom shoe), and the first heel contact was closer to midfoot. This suggests that the rear foot is only briefly in contact with the surface26,39). Shoe 3 also showed the shortest distance with regard to the medial-lateral CoP. As patients with knee osteoarthritis were found to have more lateral loading when compared with the CoP patterns of healthy subjects40), it would be expected that longer medial-lateral CoPs might not be beneficial for employees suffering from knee problems. In this context, Nigg et al.41) reported pain reduction in patients with moderate knee osteoarthritis when wearing MTB shoes, which showed the shortest medial-lateral CoP in this study. The effects of an increase in medial-lateral direction are unclear from a preventive point of view though.\n\nA limitation of the present study is the small pool of participants, whose results have to be interpreted carefully and do not yet allow for generalization. Another issue which needs to be discussed is the weight of the measuring system, as it might influence gait and plantar pressures. The CUELA system weighs three kilograms, which is a small weight compared to the body weight of the participants (approx. 3%-5% of the body weight). Furthermore, the weight of the system is distributed around extremities, with the main weight gathered around the waist (data logger). Therefore, the center of mass of the system is close to the center of mass of the body and therefore is not prone to influence body movements and particularly gait, as well as the distribution of plantar pressures, though the maximum plantar pressure might be slightly higher than in experiments with optical measurement systems. Future comparisons might be beneficial to prove this opinion.\n\nAll our measurements were carried out at the workplace, where the gold standard of gait analysis (three-dimensional infrared measuring systems) was not available, and we had to fall back to the mobile, robust CUELA system. The calibration of the insoles was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions and the initialization of the CUELA system was carried out in a neutral body posture with no further means to control for the different shoes (e.g., stabilometers). Although this approach was similar to that of other authors42), some doubt remains about the absoluteness of this initial \"calibration,\" particularly with regard to the rocker-bottom shoe. Nevertheless, we assume that our initialization is sufficient for the comparisons conducted in this study, as our results are in accordance with the results of other researchers42) and in accordance with a recent systematic review43).\n\nYet another aspect should be discussed, namely that this study about safety shoes bases on a \"standardized\" movement, i.e., walking on a plane surface at a given speed. Safety shoes should be examined at the workplace, where differences between the shoes might be more noticeable compared to measurements in standardized situations. Here lies the advantage of \"field systems,\" e.g., the CUELA systems, which can be used in standardized situations as well as in laboratory settings. Note though that future examinations at the workplace should be adjusted for age, weight, foot size, and step length."
