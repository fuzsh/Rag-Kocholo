        "text": "1. The Emerging Threat\n\nIncreased Risk and Widespread Threat\n\nWhile the proliferation and beneficial applications for drone use increases, this growth equally increases the opportunities for bad actors to leverage these capabilities to carry out less than desirable operations.\n\nCounter-UAS technology is still a relatively new industry and has only emerged with sophisticated offerings in the past few years. In less than a decade, just as with the UAS industry itself, the need for Counter-UAS capabilities has expanded to essentially every industry. Military, law enforcement and prisons might be obvious markets for C-UAS, however increased activity and threats have demonstrated the vulnerability that airports, critical infrastructure, and large public venues worldwide now face as well.\n\nPerhaps no technology with military or “dual-use” application has evolved as quickly than the use of inexpensive drones, illustrated by their game-changing impacts on the battlespace during the Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria and Ukraine conflicts. State actors such as Russia, China, and Iran as well as non-state actors and terrorist groups like ISIS have developed and or demonstrated drone capabilities leveraging small UAS for military application. As the advances in drone technology and doctrine continue apace, the need to protect personnel and critical assets with layered and integrated counterdrone systems grows more urgent.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war is quickly becoming a textbook case study for the military application of drones. With all the tragedy, devastation, loss, and the high stakes of the conflict, it has also become a testbed for new military technologies.\n\nThe drone threat on the battlefield is here and quickly evolving, as currently seen in Ukraine and the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, and previously across the Middle East. Military and Border Security forces confront an escalating number of nefarious drones from both near-peer adversaries and asymmetric combatants, boasting increasingly lethal capabilities as technologies advance. UAS serve as a new platform and delivery method for conventional threats such as payloads and surveillance.\n\nThe speed of capability advancement for even modest Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) drones provides a sobering example. In 2006 DJI was founded in a dorm room at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. A mere 16 years later, COTS drones, like DJI, today provide ISR, contraband delivery, direct attack, and fully autonomous flight against personnel and strategic assets. Russian Army General Yuri Baluyevsky said in August 2022 that the DJI Mavic’s capability to spot for accurate indirect artillery fire proved “revolutionary” in Ukraine.\n\nCommercial technology advancements will continue to increase the threat level by incorporating swarming, thermal imaging, LiDAR, GPS-denied navigation, and more—with continuing performance enhancements in range (20km range is not unusual today), speed (close to 300km/hour recorded) and payload capacity (up to 20-30kg is routine for heavy-lift small drones).\n\nThese rapid advancements in COTS and nation-state drone capabilities have fueled the recent rise of counterdrone solutions as an adjacent solution requirement from the broader universe of Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities. The ecosystem of counterdrone concepts and capabilities has grown rapidly, mirroring the advancements in drones themselves.\n\nModern warfare and tactics will continue to evolve. With two recent, full-scale wars, and the current fight in Ukraine, we now see asymmetric warfare tactics being adopted quickly by conventional forces.\n\nAnother recent drone innovation deployed in Ukraine is the small loitering munition, in this case the AeroVironment Switchblade, a low-cost flying smart bomb launched from a man-portable tube in the field and capable of destroying a tank.\n\nUkraine’s deployment of drones has been acknowledged as one key enabler of their asymmetric successes in defending against Russia’s overwhelming advantages in men and materiel. Open-source intelligence confirms Ukrainian drones dropping charges on Russian armored vehicles and scouting enemy positions with great success.\n\nRussia expected a short war won through a lightning special forces leadership decapitation rather than an extended combined-arms conflict. This provided time for drone operators to learn how to maximize their destructive potential.\n\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the Ukraine war demonstrated that drones (large and small) will be an integral and growing part of warfare in the near future however drones alone cannot win a war. Rather, drones have proven themselves as effective force-multipliers within combined-arms warfare, increasing the impact of infantry, artillery, and heavy armor—along air, sea, space, and even cyber domains.\n\nCounterdrone in Ukraine\n\nDrones in a military conflict setting have proven challenging to defeat kinetically, either because of ineffectiveness of kinetic systems against swarms of small, fast moving drone targets, or due to cost asymmetry on ammunition or the actual system cost, vs cost of the drones.\n\nEarly counterdrone efforts fell into two categories at either end of a price/complexity spectrum. Low end systems solved only a tiny fraction of the overall counterdrone problem or compromised performance unacceptably to achieve cost-effectiveness. High end systems offered by traditional defense firms, frequently designed originally for broader purposes such as Electronic Warfare, were too expensive to be widely fielded (as well as being attractive targets to hit) and too complex for intuitive use by nontechnical end users.\n\nThis divide was on display in Ukraine, where the Russians deployed full-scale EW such as their vehicle-based systems, which are vulnerable targets and too expensive to field in quantities sufficient to provide ubiquitous protection.\n\nOn the other hand, the hand-held and portable units appearing in public reports seemed almost ‘homemade’. Such basic jammers likely jeopardize operator safety. Effectiveness is also in question; while signal jamming has been around since WWII, maximizing drone neutralization in the real-world today demands advanced intellectual property in waveform/antenna design, jamming signal effectiveness and effective heat dissipation.\n\nHow effective are Western counterdrone systems against Russian drones?\n\nDue to numerous factors, including the degradation and compromise of the Russian military-industrial base, there is widespread use of imported commercial components in Russian military systems. As an example, key Orlan-10 hardware is comprised of commercially available components from China, Europe, and the U.S. Counterdrone systems like DroneShield’s, which focus on commercial drones and components, are likely to be highly effective against threats like these for both detection and defeat.\n\nDrone Use in The Armenia/Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict\n\nBoth adversaries invested heavily in various drone types, from surveillance to direct-attack and loitering munitions. The results on the battlefield were described as game-changing, with doctrinal lessons for all armed forces.\n\nArmored Vehicles were often unaware they had been geolocated until being attacked without warning. Azerbaijani forces relied heavily on Turkish-supplied drones (the same TB2 models used later by Ukraine), taking out vast numbers of Armenian combat vehicles. The drones were integrated with other assets, such as manned aircraft and artillery.\n\nThe use of affordable drones on the battlefield enabled effective payload delivery (either via the drone’s arsenal or by calling in precision strikes), with combat vehicles and Command and Control platforms seen as high value targets on the battlefield.\n\nDrone/UAS Types\n\n“Unmanned Aerial Systems” UAS is a broad term including everything from a $100 off-the-shelf UAS to a $1B military platform. It’s important to distinguish between the different types of UAS. The United States Department of Defense has created the following classification system for UAS:\n\nCounterdrone 101\n\nEffective Counter-UAS Solutions typically offer one or a combination of the following capabilities: Detect, Identify, Track, and Defeat.\n\nThe primary objective of any C-UAS operation is to have situational awareness and protect their airspace. Depending on the risk or threat a drone poses and the authority of the user, the need to mitigate the drone may also be a mission objective. This can be achieved by stopping the drone (via hacking/takeover, jamming or kinetic means) or by locating and disrupting the operator (pilot).\n\nThe first step toward UAS protection is knowing when the threat appears, where it is located (or in the event of a swarm of UAS, where the multiple threats are located), and ideally where the source (or pilot) is located. While tracking the UAS in real-time, an appropriate response can be taken based on its location, e.g. apprehend the UAS pilot.\n\nIdentification of a drone, sometimes called classification is essential. Within Group 1 UAS, there is a considerable range of models—from under 100g (with short flight times and negligible payload capability) to UAS such as the DJI Matrice 600 which can lift over 6 kg. Determining whether the UAS carries a camera and/or additional payload is also relevant and can help assess the threat.\n\nPotentially valuable features of the drone include communications protocol and frequency, vendor/manufacturer, model, size/weight, speed and Radar Cross Section (RCS). The figure below depicts some of the larger Group 1 UAS examples. Although initially designed for agricultural use or large camera payloads, these UAS can easily be adapted to carry out warfighting.\n\n1. RF Jamming Technology\n\nRF jammers transmit on the same frequency as a UAS uses to communicate with the controller or operator. When the jamming signal is stronger at the UAS than the controller’s signal to the drone, the UAS loses its connection and is forced into a pre-set emergency protocol to fly back to its starting point, hover or land.\n\nGroup 1 and 2 UAS communicate within known, unallocated frequency bands such as 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz. The UAS uses these frequencies to communicate with its controller and for First-Person View (FPV) video. UAS manufacturers are required to remain within the unallocated spectrum. Other less-common commercially used RF frequency bands include 433 MHz and 915 MHz ISM.\n\nJammer design may be directional or omni-directional (360-degree). Omni-directional jamming provides broader defeat coverage, while directional or sector-based solutions offer more precision and mitigate unintended interference.\n\nSafety certifications are critical for jamming equipment. Cheaper equipment may expose the operator to sufficient RF energy to risk health over time (similar to some early C-IED equipment). Always insist on receiving safety certifications from accredited lab testing providers for any jamming equipment.\n\nJammers can integrate with the RF detection device—as one single device sharing the same antennas—producing a compact fully integrated detect-and-defeat solution.\n\nWhile not a panacea for all possible drone-types, jamming is by far the most economical means of countering UAS. This means it is able to be fielded in much larger numbers to tactical level units, rather than being limited to specialist organizations.\n\n2. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Jamming\n\nAmerican GPS may be the most known GNSS, but the GNSS systems of other nation-states also require attention: GLONASS (Russian), Galileo (European), BeiDou (Chinese), QZSS (Japanese) and NavIC (Indian). Commercial and consumer UAS frequently come with multiple GNSS capabilities.\n\nIf jamming a drone’s RF frequency, it may still utilize GNSS to fly back to its point of origin or continue along a pre-programmed navigation path. By jamming both the RF and GNSS, the UAS is severed from its communication and navigation links and cannot fly home or continue its pre-programmed flight path. Based on the drone’s capability, it may attempt to land once jammed or hover until it’s batteries drain.\n\n3. Spoofing, Protocol Manipulation and Cyber\n\nSpoofing or “hacking” involves a form of protocol manipulation. This method includes mimicking the controller and gaining control of the drone while acting as the controller. When successful, this defeat method allows the system to direct or reroute the UAS, which can be beneficial, especially for specific use cases. Spoofing can also include spoofing the GNSS signal, effectively misguiding the direction of the UAS.\n\nA significant limitation of this approach is that the same or similar spoofing techniques are ineffective against all UAS, so there is always a risk of having a “hole” in the protection system. Even effective strategies are susceptible to software updates made by the UAS manufacturer or sophisticated UAS operators.\n\nNotably, there have been false claims that protocol manipulation is legal for use. This is untrue, as it runs against the U.S. Wiretapping Act and other related legislation in the U.S. and globally.\n\nProtocol manipulation/cyber and jamming are treated similarly under regulatory bodies insofar as they can be used only by Federal Government agencies under permissible circumstances.\n\n4. Directed Energy\n\nDirected energy counterdrone methods include laser and high-power microwave systems. These methods are emerging, for use against Group 1 and 2 drones. Use of directed energy for counterdrone is still in its early stages and is currently being evaluated for military applications. They are generally more expensive systems.\n\n7. Layered Defeat\n\nAs with detection methods, layered defeat provides robustness and resilience against varied threats. Layered approaches can include soft- and hard-kill options or multiple strategies so the user can employ the ideal countermeasure based on real-time changes within the operational environment or objective. Layered defeat solutions may be impractical for the cost-conscious (or commercial) organization as many methods involve cost-prohibited or restricted technologies.\n\n8. Deployment Methods\n\nC-UAS systems are generally deployed in three ways:\n\nDismounted and Handheld\n\nVehicle, Ship and Aircraft Based\n\nFixed Site, Base Protection\n\nIt is important to select the right type of equipment for the job, as one size does not fit all – for example, a compact form factor is a priority for dismounted operations, while long range performance is a priority for fixed site systems.\n\n9. Counter-Drone Countermeasures\n\nWith the continuous rise of UAS and C-UAS in military applications, there is an increasing focus on stealthy UAS that can resist defeat. Drones achieve RF stealth by neither taking instructions from the pilot nor sending any information back (such as location or sensor feeds). This is uncommon and sacrifices material capabilities (such as the inability to share recorded data or control payload release).\n\nTo achieve radar stealth, the UAS would need to remain motionless (as the radar is a motion tracker), without spinning blades while hovering (as radar can pick on the micro-doppler effect of the blades). This makes “radar stealth” very challenging for COTS UAS within commercial price brackets.\n\nRegarding resisting defeat, designing a jammer-resistant UAS is challenging because of the need for control by the pilot or via satellite/GNSS. With both jammed, the UAS would need to rely on other technologies such as inertial navigation, which are at very early stages today for the requirements of UAS flights.\n\nCounterdrone for Heavy Armor and Vehicles\n\nHeavy armored vehicles require supporting forward-deployed infrastructure such as fuel depots and field repair kits. However, much like many systems hardened against conventional attacks, they have vulnerabilities against small drones, as demonstrated in Nagorno-Karabakh and Ukraine.\n\nTraditional small-caliber rounds have proven ineffective for counter-drone. A manually aimed attack will expend thousands of rounds while likely failing to neutralize a small, highly maneuverable drone further than a few hundred meters away, while tunnel-visioning on the drone and percussively divulging location to everyone nearby. A burst of well-aimed 30mm proximity rounds could be an effective, albeit expensive, answer, but it assumes that the crew detects the drone before it is above their firing arcs.\n\nLarge, armored vehicles are often unaware they have been geo-located until being hit without warning. A near-peer enemy will attack with Close Air Support or artillery; an asymmetric actor might swarm with DJI Phantoms armed with shaped charges or similar munitions. Commercial drones have many options for attack, but they typically come in very high and stay above the firing arcs. While DJI software limits the very affordable “Phantom 4” to 500 meters, the limit is easily disabled to capitalize on its service ceiling of 6,000 meters (or higher, with aftermarket communication range extenders such as DragonLink and RMILEC).\n\nCounter-drone systems are beginning to appear more frequently on the battlefield for their ability to ‘listen out’ around the clock and identify expected or unexpected threats before reaching dangerous proximity. These systems—compact and sparing of precious vehicle real estate—are built with sensors that sweep the airspace around a vehicle to detect, classify and locate drones; then use either jamming defeat (especially overhead), or, when needed, kinetic defeat to mitigate the drone.\n\nOne such system is the DroneSentry-X, a fully integrated AI-based detect-identify-locate solution (with optional defeat).\n\n3 - Established Small Businesses\n\nIn the middle are companies that have survived their startup growing pains, have industry expertise in a relevant area, and can offer the agility of a dynamic team. At this stage, these companies should have evolved from a single-product company and have proven ability to scale production to meet the demand of larger customers. They typically have a funding base and or source of revenue that provides stability for their on-going development and support for their customers.\n\nCounter-UAS is not a one-size-fits-all solution, so it’s beneficial to seek a company that is committed to continued development and has demonstrated success with rapid product development to address evolving commercial technologies. Capable companies in this space should offer that desired balance of counterdrone focus and agility, which are both needed to field superior solutions.\n\nGrowth looks different for every company, therefore, established small businesses present various levels of product maturity, quality control, customer support, and most importantly, in-house counterdrone development expertise. Things to consider when evaluating counter-UAS providers are; their engineering team and capability, more than a single product or solution, and vision and evidence of future product development. The company’s ability to scale production, support deployed solutions, and meet customers’ unique requirements are also imperative for a successful solution and the success of your counterdrone operations.\n\n5. Legal and Compliance Considerations\n\nLaws surrounding purchase and use of counterdrone equipment are continuing to evolve, attempting to keep up with the developments of the drone technology. There are various laws and regulations to consider around drones, drone use and counterdrone technology. The applicable laws vary significantly between different locations and organizations and are subject to change and evolution. In the US, the most relevant restrictions are around FCC and FAA.\n\nThe FCC regulations stipulate how much energy can be emitted from various equipment at various frequency bands, and generally radars and jammers (as well as cyber/protocol manipulation) falls within their coverage. This means either a license is needed (the common approach with radars), or the FCC regulations need not to apply to a particular user in a given situation – such as military, DOJ or FBI in certain situations. As a basic rule, jammers (or protocol manipulation/cyber) are off-limits to individuals, corporations, state and local Government agencies (however drone detection equipment can still be used by them). Outside of the US, similar rules are in place by Ofcom (UK) and ACMA (Australia).\n\nThe FAA regulations essentially treat a drone like any full-size aircraft, and prohibit ‘downing’ of the drones by private citizens, in the same way as downing of the full size aircraft is not allowed- therefore limiting the defeat to military and federal Government agencies.\n\nExport and import provisions may also apply, depending on where the equipment is made, where it’s going to, and whether it’s considered for military-civilian dual use or military-grade article. In the US, the relevant restrictions are around USML (Munitions List) classifications, whether the products are ITAR-grade, ECCN, EAR99 or other classification. An experienced counterdrone manufacturer can work with the customer to ensure compliance with the export control laws.\n\n6. What Next?\n\nLayered counterdrone systems will become a critical component for many assets, such as tanks, supply depots and other infrastructure. Defense will benefit by forming a long-term relationship with an experienced sovereign partner to manage the current and future drone threat. DroneShield offers the proven capability and expertise for this key role, to work collaboratively with industry partners and academia—while leading the delivery of counterdrone solutions.\n\nDroneShield offers to build on the foundation of our ongoing commercial successes by sharing development risk with Defense, relying in part on an internal funding model, having raised over $50 million in private funds over last 7 years. DroneShield engages with dozens of subcontractors, ranging from the manufacture of complex parts to finished product assembly and testing (in addition to in-house manufacturing capabilities).\n\nThere are many considerations to make when evaluating counterdrone options. Identifying the right solution for your organization requires a clear understanding of your objectives, due diligence, and the right solution provider.\n\nDemos are a common way to get a feel for the solution and ask any questions, both on the setup/integration with the existing security systems, and on the operations. Given the nascent stage of the industry, there is a need to ensure integrity of the demos and doing setup in representative conditions, including:\n\nSupplying own drones where possible (there have been reports of unscrupulous vendors attaching transponder beacons to drones to falsely improve the performance of their detection systems)\n\nSet up demos in the environments where the products will be deployed, as opposed to an ideal setup (an open field is more forgiving than a city environment)"
