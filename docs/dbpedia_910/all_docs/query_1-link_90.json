Cruise Control allows the driver to set their preferred speed and then remove their foot from the accelerator. This gives the driver more opportunity to concentrate on the prevailing road conditions and the other traffic.\n\nA light steep on the brake pedal and Cruise Control is cancelled immediately, returning full control of the car to the driver. The previous set speed can be resumed by pressing the switch, or selecting a new speed that is more appropriate to the conditions.\n\nCruise Control can be overridden at any time to increase speed, for example when overtaking. Releasing the accelerator pedal allows the vehicle to return to the speed that was previously set.\n\nDynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC) takes cruise control one step further. It controls the accelerator & the brakes allowing the driver to maintain a pre-set following distance behind the vehicle ahead.\n\nDynamic Radar Cruise Control uses a radar sensor to track vehicles in the lane ahead. If the system picks up a vehicle that is slower than the pre-set speed, or is closer than the pre-set following distance, it will automatically reduce the cruising speed to match that of the vehicle ahead and if necessary, will apply the brakes and activate the brake lights.\n\nOnce the road ahead clears or the vehicle ahead speeds up, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control will smoothly accelerate your vehicle to the previously selected cruising speed.\n\nDynamic Torque Control AWD is a further development of Active Torque Control 4WD.\n\nActive Torque Control uses an electronically controlled coupling system to transfer power to the rear wheels only when needed, helping to improve fuel economy.\n\nDynamic Torque Control adds two new functions, Yaw Control & SPORT mode.\n\nIt also uses the fuel efficient electronically controlled coupling system, however torque transfer to the rear wheels now takes place not only when wheel slip is detected (as with Active Torque Control) but also when the system senses a possible loss of control such as understeer during cornering on-road (Yaw Control).\n\nDynamic Torque Control also features a SPORT mode. When selected, torque transfer to the rear wheels will start from the moment the steering wheel is turned.\n\nAs a result of these new functions, the overall agility and driving performance of the vehicle is enhanced during both on and off-road driving.\n\nHigh Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control helps make driving safer by keeping a constant pre-set distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead enabling you to pay more attention to the road conditions and the vehicles surroundings.\n\nHigh Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control operates when the vehicle speed exceeds approximately 40km/h and maintains an adjustable vehicle-to-vehicle distance by automatically accelerating up to a set speed or decelerating your vehicle to match the speed changes of the vehicle ahead without having to use the accelerator or brakes.\n\nToyota Safety Sense (TSS) is not available for all models and grades.

Child seats are rigidly secured to the vehicle with two attachments at the base of each side of the seat.\n\nISOFIX is easy & quick to use and reduces the high occurrence of incorrectly installed child seats.\n\nNote: If the child restraint has a top tether strap, the top tether strap should be latched onto the top tether strap anchor. If the child seat has a support leg, this should be firmly located on the floor.\n\nLane Departure Alert is designed to reduce the possibility of an accident due to your vehicle unintentionally drifting out of its lane.\n\nThe system recognises visible white and yellow lane markings and if it detects the possibility of lane departure, will urge you to steer back into the lane using a warning buzzer and a visual display.\n\nToyota Safety Sense (TSS) is not available for all models and grades.

The system recognises visible white and yellow lane markings and if it detects the possibility of lane departure, will urge you to steer back into the lane using a warning buzzer and a visual display. The system can also provide assistance by applying a small force to the steering wheel for a short time to help the driver keep the vehicle in its lane. If the system detects the vehicle is swaying (or wandering) within its lane, which is often the result of a driver who is tired, distracted or not looking ahead, a warning buzzer sounds and the decrease in attention is shown using a display on the dash.\n\nToyota Safety Sense (TSS) is not available for all models and grades.

The luggage space is filled with as many of these blocks as possible, then they are counted and the result is the luggage capacity in litres.\n\nTherefore if a vehicle has a VDA luggage capacity of 195 litres (3rd row up - to top of seat back), it means that 195, 1 litre blocks (measuring 200x50x100mm) can fit in that particular luggage space.\n\nWhen comparing vehicles, it is very important to note both the measurement standard and the actual area that is being measured. Unless otherwise stated, Toyota & Lexus both use the VDA standard and the measurement area is up to the top of the seat back. Some manufactures measure up to the roof, however it is not safe to load a vehicle in this manner unless a cargo barrier is fitted.\n\nA measurement up to the top of the seat back gives a customer the best idea of the load they can safely carry in normal day-to-day use.\n\nThis is the minimum distance in which a vehicle can make a turn.\n\nThere are two measurements commonly used-\n\n'Minimum Turning Circle (Body)' or 'Wall-to-Wall Turning Circle '\n\n'Minimum Turning Circle (Tyre)' or 'Kerb-to-Kerb Turning Circle'.\n\nKerb-to-kerb turning circle is the smallest circle the vehicle can turn without having the front wheels go over the kerbs on either side of a street.\n\nWall-to-wall turning circle is the smallest circle the vehicle can turn without the forward corners of the front bumper touching the walls on either side of an alley. The wall-to-wall turning circle is always greater than the kerb-to-kerb turning circle.\n\nOf the two, the kerb-to-kerb turning circle is the most commonly used because vehicles usually have to manoeuvre in open streets more often than in confined alleys.\n\nBe aware that sometimes it's the radius, not the diameter that is being quoted. Thus, a vehicle with a 5.2 metre kerb-to-kerb turning radius can turn around in a 10.4 metre wide street without the front wheels going over the kerbs.\n\nThe minimum turning circle is dependent on several factors including the steering specifications, the length & width of the vehicle and its wheelbase. All other things being equal, a smaller vehicle will offer a smaller turning circle.\n\nThe Pre-Crash Safety system uses sensors to determine whether a frontal collision with another vehicle is imminent and if necessary, will warn you with an audio and visual alert to urge you to take evasive action.\n\nIt then readies the Brake Assist system to provide maximum braking assistance and if you do not brake in time, it may also automatically apply the brakes to help you avoid the collision or help reduce the speed of the impact.\n\nToyota Safety Sense (TSS) is not available for all models and grades.

The vehicles navigation system will automatically connect to the SUNA broadcast and continually update as soon as new traffic messages are received.\n\nSUNA traffic is a specially broadcast service and requires no mobile phone to operate, so no phone charges are incurred in accessing the service.\n\nThe driver does not have to tune the vehicles radio to an FM frequency to receive SUNA traffic updates as the navigation system has a separate built-in FM receiver. This also means that SUNA traffic updates will not interfere with the vehicles radio reception or operation.\n\nThere are no set-up charges or procedures for SUNA. It will work as soon as the navigation system is operating. In addition, the vehicle is entitled to lifetime access to SUNA traffic updates with no on-going costs or subscriptions.\n\nReal-time traffic updates for navigation systems\n\nProvides an alternative route if a delay is detected\n\nOperates 24 / 7\n\nNo set-up or additional costs\n\nNo phone data usage\n\nAn instrument usually mounted next to the speedometer that indicates the engine’s crankshaft rotation speed in revolutions per minute (RPM).\n\nOn vehicles with a manual transmission, the tachometer can assist the driver in selecting the appropriate gear for the existing conditions.\n\nWith most tachometers, speeds above the safe operating limit are typically indicated by a red mark. This is why the maximum safe operating speed of an engine is called the “redline.”\n\nBecause not all drivers are created equal, this feature allows the driver to move the steering wheel forward or back, up or down, to find the most comfortable driving position.\n\nSome models feature a power adjustable tilt and telescoping steering column.\n\nThis system uses two motors in the steering column to adjust the steering wheel position, controlled by a small joystick mounted on the lower steering column or dashboard: one to tilt the wheel, the other to telescope the steering column moving it closer/farther away from the driver.\n\nQ. What is Toyota Link?\n\nA. Toyota Link is a multi-media system that works with compatible smartphones to access a suite of apps. Providing real-time information through your vehicle’s touchscreen display, the apps can perform useful functions such as weather forecasts, finding petrol station locations, or searching for local accommodation, restaurants and businesses. Unfortunately Toyota Link is currently not available to New Zealand drivers.\n\nQ. Which vehicles have Toyota Link?\n\nA. Some models produced from mid-2013 have the Toyota Link icon on the audio screen, however this service is not currently operational in New Zealand.\n\nQ. When will Toyota Link be available in NZ?\n\nA. We are constantly reviewing products to check their suitability for Toyota customers here in New Zealand – so the suite of Toyota Link apps is under study, however this service will not be available in the short term. At the moment while you are out and about, mobile devices offer the fastest and cheapest way to access information with a myriad of useful apps available. Smartphones can be paired to your vehicle’s audio via Bluetooth to access some functions, complimenting existing multi-media features in your vehicle. As new technology becomes available, we will be sure and let our customers know.\n\nQ. What multi-media features do Toyota vehicles have?\n\nA. In addition to common features like a CD player, touchscreen and USB connection, some Toyota vehicles are also equipped with satellite navigation with SUNA traffic to aid you in getting to your destination while avoiding traffic congestion and road hazards. To make communication easier there is Bluetooth for hands-free phone calls and audio streaming, plus voice recognition, SMS and email capability to mention a few.\n\nVSC helps the driver correct a loss of control if it detects that the vehicle is starting to skid or slide due to factors like an abrupt steering input or a slippery road surface.\n\nVehicle Stability Control (VSC) compares the vehicle's direction of travel with the driver's steering, acceleration and braking inputs.\n\nIf the vehicle is deviating from the intended direction, VSC is designed to warn the driver, reduce engine power and control the brakes to help the driver to correct the situation.\n\nNote: Depending on the vehicle manufacturer, this system may also be known as Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Dynamic Stability Control (DSC),Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC), Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), Active Stability Control (ASC) etc.\n\nThe maximum depth of water a vehicle may safely cross -\n\nMaximum Speed: 10km/h\n\nStill water\n\nIf this is exceeded the vehicle could suck water into the air filter and then into the engine. This can cause serious (& expensive) damage.\n\nCrossing water is one of the most difficult things to do in a 4WD, but can be made much easier if the basics are understood. The following list provides some of these but water crossings are not recommended for novice drivers without an experienced off-roader to assist:\n\nCheck the water for all conditions BEFORE attempting a crossing e.g. depth, current, debris, obstacles, river bed condition\n\nCheck the entry & exit points\n\nThe use of seat belts is not recommended (in case a quick exit is necessary)\n\nKnow where the engines air intake is located and ensure it will not become submerged during the crossing\n\nUse four wheel drive, low range, second gear\n\nSteady and consistent accelerator pedal operation\n\nApproach at a shallow angle and at low speed\n\nOnce in the water, gently accelerate to form a bow wave in front of the vehicle as it pushes through the water\n\nDo not stop in the water, stall or turn off the engine\n\nTest the operation of the brakes immediately after the crossing"
