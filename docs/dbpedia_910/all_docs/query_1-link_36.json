        "text": "By SEMA News Editors\n\nThird-Generation Audi Q5 Sportback Shows Off New Look\n\nThe third generation of the Audi Q5 will introduce significant design changes compared to the second-generation model, according to new images provided by SEMA News sources. While the overall proportions remain similar, the redesigned SUV features a more striking front and rear design. This applies to the Q5 Sportback as well, which was recently spotted in Germany for the first time.\n\nThe new Audi Q5 lineup will feature a shorter octagonal Singleframe grille, slimmer and more technical-looking headlights, a taller, lower air intake and side-air inlets. At the rear, the SUV is expected to have a more distinctive appearance with sleeker rear combination lamps that incorporate Audi's second-generation digital OLED technology, along with a full-width narrow LED light band.\n\nThe prototype of the next-generation Q5 Sportback, even through its swirly camouflage, reveals the Singleframe grille and vertical air intakes. Audi is testing the Sportback with its final exterior design, which includes production-ready headlights and taillights. The Sportback will also feature unique bumpers and wheels to differentiate it from the standard Q5.\n\nInside, Audi is aiming for a more streamlined design that reduces the number of physical controls. The front of the cabin is expected to include three screens: an 11.9-in. OLED Audi virtual cockpit, a 14.5-in. OLED MMI touch display and an optional 10.9-in. MMI passenger touch display. Additionally, sources said a new head-up display (HUD) is likely to be included.\n\nHyundai Ioniq 9 Spotted Fully Camouflaged\n\nInsiders recently managed to snap new photos of Hyundai's upcoming all-electric seven-seat SUV, expected to be named the Ioniq 9.\n\nThe new flagship EV is set to carry over much of the design language from the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6, while its technical specs are likely to be similar to those of the Kia EV9, sources said.\n\nWhile Hyundai hasn't announced an exact date for the Ioniq 9's reveal, rumors suggest that the global debut could take place in November at the Los Angeles Auto Show.\n\nThe upcoming electric SUV appears to feature a blunt front end, complete with vertical running lights integrated into the bumper and horizontal headlights above, which insiders expect to feature the pixel-style LED design.\n\nThe side profile of the Ioniq 9 features a steeply raked windshield and a roofline that slopes gently toward the rear. This sleeker design cues more from the Ioniq 6 sedan and could enhance aerodynamics and range, though it may compromise headroom for passengers in the third row.\n\nInside, the Ioniq 9 borrows heavily from the all-new Santa Fe's dashboard layout, sources said. It boasts a digital instrument cluster that flows into the infotainment display. The HVAC and infotainment system controls offer a blend of physical knobs and touch-sensitive buttons.\n\nBy SEMA News Editors\n\nAttendees can make history at the 2024 SEMA Show, November 5-8 in Las Vegas, which will once again offer an attendee experience like no other trade event on the planet, with thousands of the newest automotive performance products from new and iconic exhibitors, the latest vehicle trends and dozens of education sessions led by top industry professionals.

I absolutely love what I do. As an owner and one-woman show, it surely gets busy at times, but truthfully, I thrive in my craft. As a motorsports enthusiast, working with people in the automotive industry is my passion.\n\nSN: What is the most challenging part of your business or job?\n\nAB: In the racing industry, owners and teams want to use every dollar to improve their program. That sounds all-encompassing, but it really isn't. Owners and teams often choose modifications to their vehicle (i.e., performance-based mods, aftermarket additions, etc.) over photography or marketing.\n\nAs a racer and crew member, I completely understand this mentality. However, as a marketing professional, I know having quality imagery of your vehicle, team and driver are necessary assets and bring immense value when attracting sponsors.\n\nWe'd all like to race on someone else's dime, right? I mean, do what you love and help support a business you align with. That is the ultimate goal for many.\n\nSN: What was your first industry job?\n\nAB: I was born into the industry. My father was a gearhead, and from a very young age, I was taught to wrench on cars and respect horsepower. So, without aging myself, we'll just say I've been here awhile!\n\nMy first job was working with my dad at a gas station he managed. At the tender age of 13, I was helping to do little stuff around the shop. You know, sweep, clean windows, retrieve parts, etc. I didn't care what it was, as long as I got to learn and help my dad.\n\nSN: What three qualities got you to where you are today?\n\nAB: As I have gotten older, my ideals have, of course, changed. My experiences have altered the value of various qualities, but I'd have to say the three that have stuck with me are:\n\n1. Be true to myself.\n\n2. Be good to your word.\n\n3. Stay determined.\n\nIn my business, I have seen a lot of people change to accommodate their clients, to become what they thought the client wanted to earn or retain the business. I am who I am because of my experiences. I am not for everyone and that is okay. There are billions of people in the world, I am bound to rub on--or several--the wrong way.\n\nWe used to be able to shake on an agreement and that was good enough, but in today's society, you need contracts for everything (it seems). I value being good to my word; if I say I will do something, I'm good for it. It may not be a simple handshake anymore, but the importance of this quality still remains that simple.\n\nLast but definitely not least, staying determined or hungry. There is always someone out there doing it differently. That's a fact. The question is--in my business--no one else is going to show up and do it for me. I spent a great deal of time building other people's empires, thinking I wasn't good enough. I am good enough; I just wasn't determined enough then. That is not who I am now.\n\nSN: Being a woman in the industry, what have been your biggest challenges and accomplishments?\n\nAB: As both a racer, crew and businesswoman in the industry, I've heard and seen it all. Some guys want to dismiss your experience or knowledge based on the fact that you have female anatomy. I don't necessarily believe that is sexist, I simply think those men lack experience with a female who knows her way around the industry (well at least most). If men based knowledge on anatomy, I hate to be the whistleblower, but I know men with the so-called \"knowledgeable anatomy\" that know way less than me, and I learn every day in this industry.\n\nI've been involved in racing for more than 20 years and the best example that comes to mind was as a driver. I had driven a short-wheelbase car for roughly two years and after one of my passes (drag racing), I advised the owner of a problem in the transmission. He retorted, \"that's not the problem, you don't know. You don't have the experience.\"\n\nI tried explaining why I felt there was an issue with the transmission with the same response, so I let it go (not my car). The car sat in the trailer over the off-season without the owner so much as pulling it out to check anything. He put a new driver in the seat at the start of the new season (mutual decision) and upon that new driver doing the very first burnout of the season, broke the transmission. There was no need for comment, I simply said, \"get it fixed and get back out there.\"\n\nThe point of my story is that just because I am a woman does not mean I do not know.\n\nSN: Who are your role models or mentors in the industry?\n\nAB: I am a huge Stevie Fast Jackson fan. The man is incredibly knowledgeable and has a magnetic personality. I had the opportunity to meet him in Ferris, Texas, at Xtreme Raceway Park in 2020. To have a tenth of his knowledge would be a game-changer!\n\nAs far as the person who has helped me the most, I'd say my husband. He has taught me a lot, shows patience (when I probably don't deserve it) and supports me in every facet of my passion. He is very knowledgeable and I'm literally just trying to figure out how to absorb that information through osmosis or mind transfer (while we sleep). It's a work in progress.\n\nI am of course a big fan of women in general in the automotive/motorsports industry. We have a place here and I support all women who want to get involved.\n\nSN: What is the best career advice you have received?\n\nAB: Best career advice was \"do what scares you most, first.\" It sounds easy, but in truth, it's actually very hard. We are programmed to do what is safe. Get a degree, get a 9-5 job, work to live, etc. All those things are great and yes, they are perfect for most people. Just not me. I don't want to work to live, I want to enjoy this amazing and short life and share my passion with the industry that I am so incredibly passionate about. So that means I need to do what scares me most, first. It doesn't mean be careless or reckless. It just means have faith in what you keep coming back to--it's there for a reason.\n\nSN: Have you always wanted to work in the automotive industry? What keeps you here?\n\nAB: Yes! Although I didn't as a profession, I have always been involved in the automotive/motorsports industry since I was young. My unyielding passion is what keeps me here. I love the people, the experiences, the hard work, the thrash, the wins and losses; you name it, I'm all in.\n\nSN: Who was the most influential person on your career goals?\n\nAB: My husband. With him having faith in me and giving me the confidence that I am good enough, I can make a living doing what I love! He truly has been my rock and my number-one fan.\n\nFill out a #SheIsSEMA spotlight form to submit a self-nomination or nominate a colleague and highlight how you or she is contributing to the specialty-equipment industry.
