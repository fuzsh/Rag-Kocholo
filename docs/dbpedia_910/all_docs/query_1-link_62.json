        "text": "How Does Welding Work?\n\nJoining Metals\n\nAs opposed to brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal, welding is a high heat process which melts the base material. Typically with the addition of a filler material.\n\nHeat at a high temperature causes a weld pool of molten material which cools to form the join, which can be stronger than the parent metal. Pressure can also be used to produce a weld, either alongside the heat or by itself.\n\nIt can also use a shielding gas to protect the melted and filler metals from becoming contaminated or oxidised.\n\nJoining Plastics\n\nPlastics welding also uses heat to join the materials (although not in the case of solvent welding) and is achieved in three stages.\n\nFirstly, the surfaces are prepared before heat and pressure is applied and, finally, the materials are allowed to cool to create fusion. Joining methods for plastics can be separated into external or internal heating methods, depending on the exact process used.\n\nJoining Wood\n\nWood welding uses heat generated from friction to join the materials. The materials to be joined are subjected to a great deal of pressure before a linear friction movement creates heat to bond the workpieces together.\n\nThis is a fast process which allows wood to be joined without adhesives or nails in a matter of seconds.\n\nCommon Joint Configurations\n\nButt Joint\n\nA connection between the ends or edges of two parts making an angle to one another of 135-180° inclusive in the region of the joint.\n\nT Joint\n\nA connection between the end or edge of one part and the face of the other part, the parts making an angle to one another of more than 5 up to and including 90° in the region of the joint.\n\nCorner Joint\n\nA connection between the ends or edges of two parts making an angle to one another of more than 30 but less than 135° in the region of the joint.\n\nEdge Joint\n\nA connection between the edges of two parts making an angle to one another of 0 to 30° inclusive in the region of the joint.\n\nCruciform Joint\n\nA connection in which two flat plates or two bars are welded to another flat plate at right angles and on the same axis.\n\nLap Joint\n\nA connection between two overlapping parts making an angle to one another of 0-5° inclusive in the region of the weld or welds.\n\nTypes of Welding Joints\n\nWelds Based on Configuration\n\nSlot weld\n\nJoint between two overlapping components made by depositing a fillet weld around the periphery of a hole in one component so as to join it to the surface of the other component exposed through the hole.\n\nPlug weld\n\nWeld made by filling a hole in one component of a workpiece with filler metal so as to join it to the surface of an overlapping component exposed through the hole (the hole can be circular or oval).\n\nBased on Penetration\n\nFull penetration weld\n\nWelded joint where the weld metal fully penetrates the joint with complete root fusion. In US the preferred term is complete joint penetration weld (CJP, see AWS D1.1).\n\nPartial penetration weld\n\nWeld in which the fusion penetration is intentionally less than full penetration. In the US the preferred term is partial joint penetration weld (PJP).\n\nWelds Based on Accessibility\n\nFeatures of Completed Welds\n\nButt weld\n\nFillet weld\n\nParent Metal\n\nMetal to be joined or surfaced by welding, braze welding or brazing.\n\nFiller Metal\n\nMetal added during welding, braze welding, brazing or surfacing.\n\nWeld Metal\n\nAll metal melted during the making of a weld and retained in the weld.\n\nHeat Affected Zone (HAZ)\n\nThe part of the parent metal metallurgically affected by the weld or thermal cutting heat, but not melted.\n\nFusion Line\n\nBoundary between the weld metal and the HAZ in a fusion weld. This is a non-standard term for weld junction.\n\nWeld Zone\n\nZone containing the weld metal and the HAZ.\n\nWeld Face\n\nThe surface of a fusion weld exposed on the side from which the weld has been made.\n\nWeld Root\n\nZone on the side of the first run furthest from the welder.\n\nWeld Toe\n\nBoundary between a weld face and the parent metal or between runs. This is a very important feature of a weld since toes are points of high stress concentration and often they are initiation points for different types of cracks (eg fatigue cracks, cold cracks).\n\nIn order to reduce the stress concentration, toes must blend smoothly into the parent metal surface.\n\nExcess Weld Metal\n\nWeld metal lying outside the plane joining the toes. Other non-standard terms for this feature: reinforcement, overfill.\n\nNote: the term reinforcement, although commonly used, is inappropriate because any excess weld metal over and above the surface of the parent metal does not make the joint stronger.\n\nIn fact, the thickness considered when designing a welded component is the design throat thickness, which does not include the excess weld metal.\n\nRun (pass)\n\nThe metal melted or deposited during one passage of an electrode, torch or blowpipe.\n\nLayer\n\nStratum of weld metal consisting of one or more runs.\n\nEnergy Sources\n\nDifferent processes are determined by the energy source used, with a variety of different techniques available.\n\nUntil the end of the 19th century, forge welding was the only method used, but later processes, such as arc welding, have since been developed. Modern methods use gas flame, electric arc, lasers, electron beam, friction and even ultrasound to join materials.\n\nCare needs to be taken with these processes as they can lead to burns, electric shock, damaged vision, exposure to radiation or inhaling of poisonous welding fumes and gases.\n\nWhat are the Different Types of Welding and What are They Used for?\n\nThere are a variety of different welding process types with their own techniques and applications for industry, these include:\n\n1. Arc\n\nThis category includes a number of common manual, semi-automatic and automatic processes. These include metal inert gas (MIG) welding, stick welding, tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding also know as gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), gas welding, metal active gas (MAG) welding, flux cored arc welding (FCAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), submerged arc welding (SAW), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) and plasma arc welding.\n\nThese techniques usually use a filler material and are primarily used for joining metals including stainless steel, aluminium, nickel and copper alloys, cobalt and titanium. Arc welding processes are widely used across industries such as oil and gas, power, aerospace, automotive, and more.\n\n2. Friction\n\nFriction welding techniques join materials using mechanical friction. This can be performed in a variety of ways on different welding materials including steel, aluminium or even wood.\n\nThe mechanical friction generates heat which softens the materials which mix to create a bond as they cool. The manner in which the joining occurs is dependant on the exact process used, for example, friction stir welding (FSW), friction stir spot welding (FSSW), linear friction welding (LFW) and rotary friction welding (RFW).\n\nFriction welding doesn't require the use of filler metals, flux or shielding gas.\n\nFriction is frequently used in aerospace applications as it is ideal for joining otherwise 'non-weldable' light-weight aluminium alloys.\n\nFriction processes are used across industry and are also being explored as a method to bond wood without the use of adhesives or nails.\n\n3. Electron Beam\n\nThis fusion joining process uses a beam of high velocity electrons to join materials. The kinetic energy of the electrons transforms into heat upon impact with the workpieces causing the materials to melt together.\n\nElectron beam welding (EBW) is performed in a vacuum (with the use of a vacuum chamber) to prevent the beam from dissipating.\n\nThere are many common applications for EBW, as can be used to join thick sections. This means it can be applied across a number of industries from aerospace to nuclear power and automotive to rail.\n\n4. Laser\n\nUsed to join thermoplastics or pieces of metal, this process uses a laser to provide a concentrated heat ideal for barrow, deep welds and high joining rates. Being easily automated, the high welding speed at which this process can be performed makes it perfect for high volume applications, such as within the automotive industry.\n\nLaser beam welding can be performed in air rather than in a vacuum such as with electron beam joining.\n\n5. Resistance\n\nThis is a fast process which is commonly used in the automotive industry. This process can be split into two types, resistance spot welding and resistance seam welding.\n\nSpot welding uses heat delivered between two electrodes which is applied to a small area as the workpieces are clamped together.\n\nSeam welding is similar to spot welding except it replaces the electrodes with rotating wheels to deliver a continuous leak-free weld.\n\nServices\n\nTWI has one of the most definitive ranges of services."
