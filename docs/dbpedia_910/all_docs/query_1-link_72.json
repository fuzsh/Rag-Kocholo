        "text": "AT a reunion a while back, a former classmate rushed up excitedly to say hello. But the fellow had put on so many pounds I had to shoot a furtive glance at his “Hello! My Name Is...” tag.\n\n“Of course,” I stammered. “So good to see you again.”\n\nThis encounter came back to me last year when I laid eyes on the redesigned Toyota Land Cruiser. Here’s another old friend who seems to have ballooned to almost unrecognizable dimensions.\n\nToyota’s new temple of tumescence is nearly three feet longer, two feet wider and a ton heavier than the original Land Cruiser of 1954-55. But just like my esteemed but portly old friend, the two versions are still about the same height.\n\nTheir girth notwithstanding, I retain fond feelings for both the classmate and the Cruiser.\n\nThe Land Cruiser will always have an honored place in Toyota history, because it is perhaps the vehicle that saved the company. When Toyota began exporting cars to the United States a half-century ago, its first model, the crummy Toyopet sedan, was such a failure that the company almost retreated home. It took Toyota years to design better cars, but in the interim it kept a tenuous toehold in the American market by selling a few of its sturdy Land Cruisers  the Jeep of Japan. Through the decades since, the Land Cruiser has survived as many competitors have faded  because it has built a cult following and because it has proved as durable as a cast-iron skillet.\n\nInterestingly, sales of the new Land Cruiser increased 16.5 percent last year, even in a dismal auto market that was especially hostile to large S.U.V.’s. Indeed, Land Cruiser sales had jumped a whopping 82 percent through October before the bottom fell out in the final two months.\n\nResale values are legendarily high. For instance, in 1958 a new Land Cruiser sold for about $3,000. Nowadays, if you could find one, a pristine example might fetch 20 times as much. And, yes, that’s about what the 2009 model costs.\n\nToday’s platinum-priced model, part of the seventh generation that made its debut last year, starts at $65,500 and tops out around $73,000. If you’re wondering, the similar Lexus LX 570 starts at $76,530; fully loaded, it’s $84,000 and change.\n\nIf pricing is figured on a per-pound basis, maybe the new Land Cruiser’s price increase adds up. Between generations six and seven, as the exterior dimensions grew by an inch or two here and there, its curb weight gained an entire Charles Barkley. Officially, the Land Cruiser weighs 5,690 pounds, but it tipped the scales at 5,900 when Car and Driver magazine weighed it.\n\nThe increased bulk can be traced to a sturdier hydroformed frame, larger axles, heavy-duty brakes and the upgrading of its powerplant to a massive 5.7-liter V-8 truck engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission. A lot more insulation and road-isolation technology have been designed in, giving the S.U.V. a quieter ride worthy of a Lexus.\n\nWhile only a privileged few can afford this plus-size sport utility, they can surely appreciate that it runs on regular unleaded even while producing 381 horsepower and 401 pound-feet of torque.\n\nAlthough that is 44 percent more horsepower than its pallid predecessor offered, fuel economy is marginally better. But the federal rating of 13 miles a gallon in city driving is nothing to brag about (although its ULEV-II emissions rating is). I managed to get around 15 m.p.g., in 300 miles of mostly highway motoring out to Southern California’s deserts and back to the beach. At a steady 55 m.p.h., the 18 m.p.g. highway rating might be achievable, but I couldn’t keep the thing moving that slowly.\n\nHigh speeds are expected of Land Cruisers in parts of the world where the vehicle is popular and prestigious  think of Africa, Australia and the Middle East  and where the sticker price and mileage may matter less. Owners in countries with dodgy highway infrastructures also demand unexcelled off-road abilities to go with the Land Cruiser’s best-in-class power and reliability.\n\nSo why did Toyota reduce the new model’s ground clearance, and the approach, departure and break-over angles that are so crucial in hard-core off-roading? A height-adjustable suspension might have compensated for those losses, but one is not offered.\n\nAnother head-scratcher: Why is the housing of the rear differential made of lightweight (and relatively fragile) aluminum?\n\nGone, at least, is the old torsion bar suspension. In its place is a double-wishbone independent front suspension with inboard coilover gas-pressure shock absorbers; the setup is carlike, yet thoroughly capable. In back, there’s a more robust four-link coil spring and Panhard bar setup controlling the industrial-strength solid axle from the Tundra pickup.\n\nThe full-time four-wheel-drive system, with selectable 2.62:1 low-range gearing, is enhanced by Crawl Control and Downhill Assist Control; both functions maintain slow but constant speed during the gnarliest trail-busting.\n\nA Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System, which made its debut on the 2004 Lexus GX, is also new here; it enables the front and rear antiroll bars to stiffen or relax automatically as sensors determine changes in traction. This lets the Land Cruiser corner flatter and provides four more inches of up-and-down movement for the wheels. When back on pavement, the kinetic system automatically disengages.\n\nFor hard-duty off-roading, Dunlop Grandtreks are the best of three 280/60 series tires available. The wheels are 18-inch alloys.\n\nOff road, the Land Cruiser ably deflected my best efforts to unsettle it. But an advanced degree in engineering would be helpful in figuring out its trickiest features, like Crawl Control. To activate it, the transmission must be in Drive, although you need to be in Neutral to engage the center diff-lock. The transmission’s Snow Mode must be switched off, although the stability and traction controls need to be on.\n\nDon’t forget to turn off the side curtain air bags; you could get an up-close demonstration of their pyrotechnic deployment if the vehicle’s lean angle becomes too extreme. Toggle between the three speed modes (1, 2 or 3 m.p.h.) on the fly (so to speak), but don’t step on the brake pedal or throttle. (Touching the brakes turns the system off.)\n\nIt is best not to experiment with this while aimed nearly vertical on a hillside.\n\nOperator errors with Land Rover’s similar Terrain Response System, and the expensive repairs that may result, are one reason that brand’s reliability ratings consistently circle the drain. Time will tell whether Land Cruiser newbies are savvy enough to avoid similar gaffes.\n\nShould you find yourself pin-balling down some boulder-strewn ravine, however, you’ll be relieved to know that the Land Cruiser has full skid plates underneath. There’s also four-wheel multiterrain antilock brakes, electronic brake-force distribution and brake assist that works in conjunction with the traction and stability-control systems. Inside, there are more air bags than a Bouncy Castle.\n\nStandard comforts include 12 cup holders, 28 air vents and a premium audio system with 14 speakers. There’s a power moonroof, leather seats (heated in front), a tilt-telescoping steering column, four-zone air-conditioning and three rows of seats for up to eight adventure-seekers. Children only in the back, please."
