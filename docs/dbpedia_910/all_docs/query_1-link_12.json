        "text": "From hybrid drivetrains, adaptive suspension, and even the buttons on your steering wheel, Formula One technology has revolutionised how we drive.\n\nThe World Drivers' Championship officially kicked off with the British Grand Prix in 1950.\n\nFactory racing teams and grands prix-titled events had, however, existed since the late 19th century and that era marked the start of a series of genius mechanical and technological advances that continue to this day.\n\nSome were so far ahead of their time they were banned almost overnight and never evolved as a production technology.\n\nThe 1978 Brabham “fan car” is a case in point. It was a radical interpretation to generate “ground effects” where the car is sucked to the road at high speeds to improve downforce and therefore tyre grip.\n\nThe FIA regulations stated that moveable devices providing an aerodynamic advantage were not permitted.\n\nDesigner Gordon Murray got around the problem by mounting a fan on the rear of the engine. Ostensibly it was used to cool the engine, but it had a “fortuitous side effect” of generating downforce because the area around the cockpit and engine were effectively sealed areas, making the fan the only avenue for the air to flow.\n\nNiki Lauda won the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix using the device, but the other teams complained so much that Brabham abandoned the innovation despite it being deemed legal.\n\nIt was a similar story with Mercedes-AMG’s brilliant dual-axis steering system seen in the 2020 season.\n\nIt allowed the driver to push and pull on the steering wheel to change the alignment, or toe, of the front wheels. If the steering wheel was pushed forward, the front wheels adopted a toe-out attitude which improved cornering stability.\n\nAs the driver accelerated, G-forces naturally saw him pull the wheel back, which returned the front tyres to a more aerodynamic neutral profile. The FIA modified the regulations in 2021 to state the wheels could only be turned left and right, not adjusted for toe.\n\nMany other innovations did make the track-to-road transfer.\n\nDOHC engines\n\nRenault debuted the double overhead camshaft in 1912 at the French Grand Prix.\n\nSimply put, the camshaft is responsible for operating the intake and exhaust valves that bring in fresh air and expel exhaust gases respectively.\n\nA double camshaft lets car makers add multiple valves to each cylinder and to optimally configure their placement around the cylinder to improve efficiency.\n\nThe vast majority of road cars now use this technology, though F1 teams are experimenting with operating the valves by electromagnetic and electrohydraulic actuators.\n\nThis system can already be found in the Koenigsegg Gemera’s “Freevalve” engine.\n\nCarbon fibre\n\nMcLaren was the first to introduce a carbon fibre chassis in F1 with its MP4/1 chassis in 1981.\n\nCarbon fibre has previously been used in small components where its light weight and strength were valued, but McLaren expanded on the concept.\n\nThat innovation then translated to the world’s first series production road car to use a carbon fibre chassis in the shape of the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren.\n\nCarbon fibre is now used in many high-end road cars, including Porsche, BMW and Aston Martin.\n\nPaddle shifters\n\nPaddle shifters were invented around the start of the 19th century, but it wasn’t until the 1989 F1 season that Ferrari felt confident enough in a semi-automatic gearbox to launch the John Barnard-designed version. An electro-hydraulic system used two paddles mounted behind the steering wheel to shift gears up and down.\n\nThe rationale was that shifts were faster and caused less wear on the components than a conventional manual gear change. Unlike a full automatic, the drivers still had control over when and where to change gears.\n\nIt took just eight years for paddle shifters to appear in Ferrari’s road-going F355.\n\nToday, small SUVs and people-movers are fitted with paddle shifters, as much a style statement as having any real benefit.\n\nSteering-wheel buttons\n\nThose buttons to change the volume and radio station, the driver’s display and even set the cruise control are all derived from F1 machines.\n\nThe trend started in the 1970s but took off in the ’80s and ’90s as the cars adopted more technology. Drivers travelling at 300km/h didn’t want to be looking for a button, so they were located on the steering wheel.\n\nModern machines have up to 25 switches and dials operating everything from the brake bias to the opening the DRS system and the all-important overtaking button to extract maximum power from the engine and motors"
