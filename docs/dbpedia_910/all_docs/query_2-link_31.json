        "text": "Automotive Shock Absorber Market size was valued at US$ 10.59 Bn. in 2022 and the total revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.2% through 2022 to 2029, reaching nearly US$ 17.23 Bn.\n\nAutomotive Shock Absorber Market Overview:\n\nA shock absorber is essentially an oil pump, a device that smooth out the abrupt and rough push or shake and distributes it as kinetic energy. Landing gear is a part of the support systems for industrial equipment, and shock absorbers are essential in every motorcycle and automotive suspension. Shock absorbers are typically cylinders with a sliding piston that is cushioned by hydraulic fluid or air. Hydraulic Type, and Gas-filled Type are the product types of the automotive shock absorber. OEMs, and Aftermarket are the sales channel of the automotive shock absorber. Twin Tube Design, and Mono-Tube Design are the design types of the automotive shock absorber.To know about the Research Methodology :- Request Free Sample Report\n\nAutomotive Shock Absorber Market Dynamics:\n\nShock absorbers on machines considerably minimise shock and vibration. Damage to machinery, downtime, and maintenance costs are reduced as a result. Shock absorbers allow machines to run at higher speeds because they control or gently stop moving things. As a result, manufacturing rates can be raised. Motions negative side effects, such as noise, vibration, and destructive impacts, are reduced or eliminated, resulting in higher output quality. Tolerances and fittings are also more manageable. To alleviate operational concerns and supply end users with high-quality shock absorbers, leading manufacturers are employing revolutionary production technologies and procedures. Shock absorbers for electric vehicles are in high demand, which presents several prospects for manufacturers and suppliers. Increasing urbanisation and smart cities, as well as increasing daily commuting distances, are some of the key drivers boosting demand for new automobiles, which has a positive indirect impact on the automotive shock absorbers industry. As the number of vehicles on the road grows, so drive demand for automotive shock absorbers around the world. Besides, the global automotive shock absorbers market is expected to see significant growth due to increased vehicle production and demand. The employment of cutting-edge technology in electric vehicles, such as regenerative shock absorbers, has resulted in a major increase in demand for automotive shock absorbers. Increased demand from automobile owners for improved ride quality and vehicle safety are driving market growth. Shock absorbers should be replaced every 50,000 miles, according to many manufacturers.\n\nAutomotive Shock Absorber Market Segment Analysis:\n\nBased on the Vehicle, the market is segmented into Passenger Cars, LCVs, HCVs, and Two Wheelers. Two Wheelers segment is expected to hold the largest market share of xx% by 2029. Manufacturers are expected to get benefit from the increased focus on electric and hybrid automobiles. Automotive shock absorbers are available from companies including KYB Corporation, Tenneco Inc., ZF Friedrichshafen AG, and Hitachi Automotive Systems for a variety of vehicle types and designs. During the forecast period 2023-2029, sales and production of two-wheelers are expected to have a direct impact on demand for shock absorbers for two-wheelers. Two-wheelers are adopting new technology to reduce weight and improve durability, which is a key factor driving the development of light weight shock absorbers. Based on the Design, the market is segmented into Twin Tube Design, and Mono-Tube Design. Twin Tube Design and Mono-Tube Design segments are expected to grow rapidly at a CAGR of xx% and xx% during the forecast period 2023-2029. In shock absorbers, twin tube and mono tube designs are commonly utilised. Twin tube shocks are made up of two cylinders with oil flowing between them to produce a dampening force. Mono tube twin shocks have a single cylinder filled with oil that is separated from the other by a piston valve. Mono tube shocks have a higher damping ability and provide a better ride quality than twin tube shocks. However, because mono tube shocks are more expensive, many manufacturers favour twin tube shocks. Based on the Sales Channel, the market is segmented into OEMs, and Aftermarket. OEMs sales channel segment is expected to grow rapidly at a CAGR of xx% during the forecast period 2023-2029. OEMs have a strong demand for shock absorbers, as millions of new vehicles are equipped with them every year. OEM demand for shock absorbers is consistent, and demand in the replacement market is stable; yet, it accounts for one-third of overall shock absorber sales.\n\nAutomotive Shock Absorber Market Regional Insights:\n\nNorth America region is expected to dominate the Global Automotive Shock Absorber market during the forecast period 2023-2029. North America region is expected to hold the largest market share of xx% by 2029.
