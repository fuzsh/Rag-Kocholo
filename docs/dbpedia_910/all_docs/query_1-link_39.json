        "text": "When designing an electric vehicle, engineers need to balance performance and energy efficiency by selecting the right energy storage technology and minimizing powertrain losses. These and other critical tasks require simulation of the physical system throughout development, from selecting a powertrain architecture to testing the embedded software.\n\nThis article shows how MATLAB®, Simulink®, and Simscape™ support the seven most common use cases for electric vehicle simulation:\n\nExplore electric powertrain architectures\n\nTune regenerative braking algorithms\n\nModify a suspension design\n\nOptimize vehicle performance\n\nDevelop active chassis controls\n\nValidate ADAS algorithms\n\nTest using hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)\n\nThe example model used in this article is available for download.\n\n1. Explore Electric Powertrain Architectures\n\nSelecting the right architecture for an electric vehicle design is challenging because of the many options and tradeoffs that must be considered. Architectures can include one, two, or multiple electrical motors; a combustion engine; and various sources of power. Each architecture must be evaluated against criteria such as range, acceleration, performance, and price. Simulation enables you to complete these evaluations by testing candidate architectures on hills and racing circuits and in stop-and-go traffic.\n\nIn Simscape, the interfaces between subsystems are physical connections representing mechanical shafts, electrical wires, or fluid in a pipe. The model of the physical system is a schematic that visually communicates how the systems are connected. You can try out various configurations—for example, exchanging a powertrain containing three motors and a battery for a powertrain with a single motor powered by a battery and a fuel cell—and compare the effect of each configuration on vehicle-level performance (Figure 1).\n\n2. Tune Regenerative Braking Algorithms\n\nA huge advantage of electric vehicles is their ability to recapture kinetic energy and store it in the battery. To maximize the efficiency of this process, the driveline, power converters, and battery design need to be coordinated with the battery management algorithm. In serial regenerative braking, both the regenerative brakes and the conventional brakes are active at the same time, and a control algorithm is required to ensure smooth deceleration.\n\nSimulink models of control algorithms can be connected to Simscape models of brake-by-wire systems that include the hydraulic system and electric motors that generate torque during braking. You can tune both systems to balance requirements for passenger safety and comfort and to maximize the vehicle’s range.\n\nFigure 3 shows a vehicle model configured to use regenerative braking. An algorithm implemented in Simulink determines how much braking torque the electric motors can provide and commands the conventional brakes to provide the remaining required brake torque.\n\n3. Modify Suspension Design\n\nSuspension design involves a tradeoff between passenger comfort and vehicle handling. Suspension behavior depends on a staggering number of parameters, including hardpoint locations, bushing stiffnesses, and spring rates. Simulation helps you tune new designs and test the integration of your component with an existing suspension.\n\nIn a Simscape model you can define all these parameters with MATLAB variables and use MATLAB to calculate performance metrics, such as the toe angle of the wheel and the roll center of the vehicle. These parameters can be adjusted automatically until the design meets the requirements.\n\nFigure 5 shows a Simscape model of a vehicle with a multibody suspension. The red spheres represent the hardpoints. These are usually obtained from mechanical designers via the CAD assembly, but can also be measured from an actual vehicle.\n\n4. Optimize Vehicle-Level Performance\n\nElectric vehicle systems are often developed by several different teams. For example, the mechanical drivetrain and electrical motors are selected by separate teams of engineers and produced by different manufacturers. Braking system algorithms are developed by controls engineers, while the master cylinder, valves, and pumps are selected by hydraulics engineers. For optimal vehicle performance, there must be consistency across these independently developed systems.\n\nSimulation lets you verify that brake caliper pressure, battery capacity, and motor power requirements are in ranges that permit smooth acceleration and deceleration. For example, you can use optimization algorithms in MATLAB to tune the values of these components and to balance lap time and vehicle range.\n\nThe plot in Figure 7 shows the result of lap-time optimization. The color of the path around the racetrack indicates the vehicle going faster in the straight sections and slower in the curves, reducing lap time.\n\n6. Validate ADAS Algorithms\n\nADAS algorithms must always meet safety requirements, but the market differentiator might be the quality of the passenger experience. For example, when the vehicle is overtaking, the algorithm may use harsh steering and braking maneuvers that throw the passengers off balance. Subjective qualities like passenger comfort are difficult to evaluate. But a simulation model can produce measurements that let you quantify passenger discomfort levels.\n\nYou can model passengers as 3D mechanical humanoids with joints and instrument them with accelerometers to capture the acceleration and jerk that passengers feel as the vehicle moves through a maneuver guided by an ADAS algorithm. You can then postprocess the accelerometer data in MATLAB to derive an index of discomfort.\n\nFigure 11 shows a vehicle model with 3D mechanical models of the passengers. In the simulation we test an ADAS algorithm by following a path through a test facility."
