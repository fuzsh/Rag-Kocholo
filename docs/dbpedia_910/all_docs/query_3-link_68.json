        "text": "The previous chapter was about active and passive safety, and explained how an airbag works. The duration of a crash is very short, and it is over in much less than one second. During this time, airbags are inflating to cushion the occupants, but other features have a role to play in the occupant protection. What are these features, when do they come into play and how they are working? This is the subject of this chapter.\n\nFront car crash timeline. During a car crash, both active and passive safety features come into play to mitigate occupant injuries.\n\nTo understand how car safety features work, let’s consider a front impact at 40 mph (64 km/h). In a car crash, it is in fact possible to distinguish between three separate impacts: a primary impact between the car and the obstacle, a secondary impact between the occupants and the car interiors, and a tertiary impact between the occupants’ internal organs and the inner walls of their body cavities. The latter is the more dangerous type of impact because it can lead to severe internal injuries. To prevent this, the accelerations imposed on the occupants’ bodies must be kept below human load tolerance limits. By improving the energy absorption capability of the car, it is possible to protect the occupants. It is important to keep in mind that in a typical car crash the deceleration of the vehicle takes about 90 to 100 ms. Therefore, the event is over in — literally — less than the blink of an eye. During this short period of time, both active and passive restraint features come into play to save the car occupants’ lives.\n\n0 ms: the first impact\n\nDuring crash tests, the time is measured from the initial impact. Therefore, at 0 ms the car is impacting the wall.\n\n0 to 100 ms: the crumple zones\n\nThe front of the car starts to collapse. The collision generates an acceleration pulse. In order to avoid an acceleration overshoot in the occupant area (which could cause severe injuries to the occupants), car engineers use a crumple zone, also known as a crush initiation zone. These zones are designed to collapse first with the aim of absorbing and redistributing the energy of the collision. To understand crumple zones, let us have a look at the cardboard boxes used in movie stunts to break a fall. As the stuntman falls he gains kinetic energy. If his motion was stopped too quickly, most of that energy would be absorbed by his body in a very short time, which could lead to fatal injuries. To break his fall, a stack of cardboard boxes is often used. As the stuntman lands on the boxes, they will collapse under the impact load and thus protect the stuntman. In fact, the cardboard boxes absorb part of the impact energy and provide extra space for the stuntman to decelerate, therefore limiting the peak acceleration load. Similarly, the purpose of car crumple zones is to control acceleration levels and minimise intrusions to allow occupant restraints to limit loads transferred to the occupant to tolerable levels.\n\nTruck models designed by Simpact. The model on the left does not have a crumple zone, while the model on the right does.\n\n20 ms to 150+ ms: the occupants’ protection\n\nEven if the car has impacted the wall and is losing speed, the occupants are still travelling forwards at 40 mph (initial velocity). It is now that seatbelts and airbags come into play. To stop the occupants, their bodies are coupled with the vehicle by three-point seatbelts, which also prevent them from impacting an object such as the windshield, the steering wheel, the dashboard or the front seat. Three-point seatbelts were introduced by Volvo in 1959. Before this date only two-point seatbelts (such as those still used in airplanes) were available in the automotive industry. However, in high-speed crashes, two-point seatbelts had been known to cause serious internal injuries. Indeed, many improperly belted children have suffered from spinal cord injuries because of lap belts. A review of 10 years of published studies has shown that among these children, 40% had abdominal wall bruising and 46% had internal abdominal injuries. Therefore, three-point seatbelts — which are much safer, as they restrain both the upper and the lower body — took over. In the interests of safety, Volvo made the new seatbelt design available to other car manufacturers. Nevertheless, the early days of seatbelts were complicated. This safety feature was optional in most cars and was not popular among the general public. Even today, some people still do not wear seatbelts. Wearing seatbelts is mandatory in the European Union but in other places laws can differ. For example, in 16 states of the USA, like Dakota and Nebraska, seatbelt use is a “secondary enforcement” priority. This means that police can only charge drivers for not wearing seat belts if they have already pulled them over for another reason (e.g. high speed). But why do some Americans still not wear seatbelts? Some of them are afraid to be trapped in their car, or they just forget. Others have “pseudo-rules”, e.g. they will only wear a seatbelt if the weather is bad, or when they set off for a long journey.\n\nEmergency hammer.\n\nPeople are not trusting safety features and are afraid to be trapped in their car.\n\nBut let’s go back to the car crash scenario, and in particular to the moment when the three-point seatbelt keeps the occupants positioned in their seat. At the same time, the front airbag inflates to cushion the driver and the passenger with a gas-filled pillow. These pillows, as mentioned in the previous chapter, help in energy dissipation by having little holes that allow them to deflate as the occupants impact them.\n\nMoreover, to prevent the driver’s chest from being crushed by the steering wheel, in the 1930s several car manufacturers introduced collapsible steering columns. Various designs were created, including springs, a scissors mechanism, or a hydraulic piston. Nevertheless, these ideas were not developed at this time because of carmakers’ lack of interest in impact protection. It was only in 1967 that General Motors began installing steering columns with a kind of “wire mesh” geometry that compacted under pressure. Chrysler and Ford introduced their first collapsible steering column a year later.\n\nThe entire car interior is also covered with padding to reduce head and chest injuries. In the 1930s cars were equipped with steel dashboards. It was only in 1948 that Preston Tucker built the first car with a padded dashboard. His car, the “Tucker Torpedo” had the ambition to be a “truly great automobile” with additional ahead-of-its-time safety features besides the padded dashboard, such as “pop-out” safety glass windshields. A fun fact is that the car was supposed to have seatbelts, but the final model did not have them because Tucker’s assistants convinced him that they would make the car appear less sturdy and less safe than it actually was.\n\nTucker Torpedo and its padded interiors. Only 51 cars were made before the company ceased operations.\n\nBut seatbelts, airbags, dashboard padding and collapsible steering columns are just some elements of crash mitigation features. Even the seats are designed to meet a safety requirement. Head restraints are designed to prevent whiplash (i.e. neck sprains and strains) during rear-end collision. In this particular impact scenario, the occupant’s torso and head are propelled backwards. The seat cushions the torso, but if the head is unsupported it continues to move back while the torso bounces on the seat and moves forward. This can result in neck injuries. The head restraint keeps the occupant’s head and body aligned throughout the collision.\n\nComparison between a poor (top) and good (bottom) rated head restraint. Properly adjusted head restraints protect your neck by keeping your head and body aligned throughout the collision.\n\nIn fact, the entire vehicle compartment is designed to protect the occupant. As explained before, the way the front of the car collapses is controlled. That is also the case for the whole frame (i.e. the car’s body), which is designed to maintain a survival space and to dissipate collision forces that otherwise the occupants would be exposed to. The part of the vehicle that is designed to not collapse under crash loads is called the safety cage. This cage is made out of materials with different strengths in order to find a compromise between the safety performance of the vehicle and its weight. Indeed, it is not necessary for the car to be made entirely out of extremely strong materials. As shown with the cardboard example, compliance can also be a strength. Moreover, the limits of human tolerance are already known, thanks to empirical experiences led by Colonel Stapp and other safety pioneers. By using these results and by predicting maximum accelerative forces experienced in the vehicle, the engineers working on a vehicle can design devices to absorb much of the energy of the impact before injurious load levels reach the occupants.\n\nGoing back to the front crash scenario, the occupant’s body is thrown forward during a frontal collision. Even if the seatbelt and the front airbag constrain the upper body, the legs are still flinging forward and could hit something. If this happens, it could result in severe leg fracture or damage to the hips or pelvis. A fracture of the femur could also result in a laceration of the femoral artery, potentially causing death by exsanguination. In order to prevent this, a knee bolster is installed at the front of the dashboard, so that the loads acting on the occupant’s knee upon impact are diminished. Nowadays, new cars are equipped with knee airbags that cushion the occupants' knees and help restrain the pelvis, thus keeping the occupant safely in place.\n\nDummies after a side crash test (left) and a front crash test (right). Smeared greasepaint shows where the driver dummy's head and knees were protected from being hit by hard structures.\n\nMany other types of airbag do exist, such as side airbags, seatbelt airbags and even pedestrian airbags. The driver’s and passenger’s front airbags only inflate in case of a front crash. Conversely, in case of a side-crash – which causess the second highest frequency of death and serious injuries – it is the side and curtain airbags that are inflated. Unlike the front airbags, curtain airbags remain inflated after impact to reduce the risk of an unbelted occupant being thrown out of the vehicle in a rollover crash. This also protects the occupants from glass projection.\n\nIn a car crash, glass projections are typically made of tempered glass fragments. This is the most used type of glass. It is also used in public transport (side and rear windows of trains and buses), in buildings (as it meets fire code regulations) and to make drinking glasses. Tempered glass is obtained by subjecting glass to very high temperatures and then cooling it quickly. It has many attractive properties such as a high strength in compression and bending, high temperature resistance, and its ability to break into circular and small pieces instead of sharp, jagged shards. The side and rear windows in cars are made with tempered glass, while the windshield is made from laminated glass. Indeed, studies have shown that tempered glass is inferior to laminated glass. Unlike tempered glass, laminated glazing may be cracked without leading to glass projection, due to its structure. It consists of two layers of glass sandwiching a sheet of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) that provides a superior impact toughness that cannot be achieved by tempered glass. The plastic interlayer holds the glass pieces together and keeps the window closed. Laminated glass is desirable for its comfort and convenience properties. The advantages offered by laminated glass include reduced ultraviolet transmission and improved noise attenuation. But first and foremost, laminated glass is recognised for its safety advantages. In addition to not leading to glass projection, laminated glass has the ability to prevent the penetration into the occupant compartment by an object that would shatter tempered glass (a blunt impactor requires approximately three times the kinetic energy to penetrate laminated glass when compared to tempered glass). It also prevents the ejection of car occupants through the windshield. The injury resulting from this kind of event, commonly referred to as a “glass necklace”, was very frequent in the early days of the automobile industry, when windshields were made of plate glass. Laminated glass was invented before tempered glass but was replaced by the latter because of economic reasons in the 1960s. Nowadays, due to the rise of popularity of sport utility vehicles (SUV), carmakers tend to equip side and rear windows with laminated glass, to avoid occupant ejection. In fact, because of their high centre of gravity, SUVs are mostly subject to rollover crashes. During a highway speed rollover, even belted occupants can be partially or fully ejected, due to the chaotic motion ensuing.\n\nComparison between laminated (left) and tempered (right) glass. The laminated glass fragments stay together and create a spide’s web, while tempered glass breaks into small circular pieces\n\nWithout the combination of all these features, the car occupants would be exposed to greater dangers during car crash. Nowadays, it seems normal to have ABS, airbags, etc., but all these things are quite new. In fact, if you remember the Ralf Nader story that took place in the 1960s, cars were not equipped with most of the basic safety features fifty years ago. It is only during the last few decades that the majority of the improvements have been implemented, mostly because of the introduction of a new tool, which has revolutionised crashworthiness work: Computer-Aided Engineering.\n\n\"Vehicle safety: a life-saving success story\" was written by Melanie Tran during her internship at Simpact Engineering Ltd. in 2018.
