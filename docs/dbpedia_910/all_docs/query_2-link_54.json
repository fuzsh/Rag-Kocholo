        "text": "The flexible foam system Elastoflex® W decisively contributes to car comfort and improves the sound impression in the driver’s cabin. In comparison to other acoustic solutions, Elastoflex® W performs not only as sound absorber, but also dampens sound from outside the car by visco-elastic energy dissipation. Especially designed foams resist also high temperatures and media contact. These foams are widely used in direct contact to the engine as NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) and heat management solution. Engine covers with this open cell foam structure lead to weight reduction with a density on only 15g/L.\n\nLearn more about Elastoflex® W\n\nAlthough invisible, Elastoflex® E semi-rigid foams contribute extensively to the valuable appearance in car interiors, since the foam can be found behind most skin surfaces and causes a pleasant, soft and elastic touch. It needs to fill even smallest gaps between carrier and skin, e.g. in instrument and door panels as well as in armrests. Elastoflex® E has excellent mold-filling and very robust processing properties. The semi rigid foam systems offer fast demolding times and can be combined with all skin types, individually designed for all special OEM requirements. Although applications are diverse, it is BASF’s goal to provide one system for many parts in order to reduce customers’ complexity and cost structure.\n\nLearn more about Elastoflex® E\n\nThe low-density Elastoflex® E and Elastolit® D semi-structural foams are designed for producing very light and stiff composite as well as sandwich structures for various interior and exterior applications such as load floors, interior lining parts, roof modules and engine hoods. Reinforced with long-glass fibers in state-of-the-art composite processes, thin-walled parts with good mechanical properties and light in weight can be realized. Such composite substrates can be combined with various surface materials like textiles or thermoplastic films, either by back-foaming or adhering.\n\nLearn more about Elastoflex® E and Elastolit®\n\nElastocoat® is a high-tech spraying system for the reliable and lasting protection of all surfaces. As a quick, efficient and lasting seal, it is ideal for chassis and body in white requirements. Also its rapid application in comparison to other materials is an advantage.\n\nElastocoat® is also the tradename of BASF’s polyurethane matrix system used in continuous fiber pultrusion or resin transfer molding for components requiring the highest to strength ratio and excellent energy management.\n\nLearn more about Elastocoat®"
