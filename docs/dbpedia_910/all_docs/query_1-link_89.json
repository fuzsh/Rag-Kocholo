        "text": "The Australian arrival of the entry-level Porsche Taycan expands the local range to five versions of the all-electric sports sedan, and joins the recently released Taycan Cross Turismo variants.\n\nThe arrival of the Taycan also adds further weight to Porsche’s systematic drive towards sustainable mobility.\n\nAustralian model range\n\nThe Australian Taycan model range is summarised below.\n\nTaycan\n\nTaycan 4S\n\nTaycan GTS\n\nTaycan Turbo\n\nTaycan Turbo S\n\nProduct Highlights: Taycan Cross Turismo\n\nThe Australian Product Highlights of Porsche's first Cross Utility Vehcile.\n\nPowertrain: Porsche E-Performance\n\nA key difference in the new Taycan is its powertrain. It’s fitted with a single electric motor at the rear axle and uses rear-wheel drive.\n\nAll other model variants in the current Taycan range are fitted with dual electric motors (one at the front axle, one at the rear axle) and all-wheel drive.\n\nThe Taycan’s compact power module (which comprises its electric motor, pulse-controlled inverter, and two-speed transmission – each detailed below) is fitted parallel to the rear axle, ensuring maximum space capacity for the rear luggage compartment.\n\nAll in all, this power module has one of the highest power densities of any electric vehicle powertrain on the market today.\n\n800-volt system architecture:\n\nAs with all Taycan models, this new rear-wheel-drive variant uses Porsche’s innovative 800-volt electric drive system which provides impressive driving range, fast recharging, and Porsche sportscar performance.\n\nThe Taycan was the first production car to use a voltage system of 800 volts (the voltage range is 610-835 volts) instead of the usual 400 volts for electric cars.\n\nPorsche’s 800-volt system allows consistently high performance, reduced battery recharging times, decreased weight, and requires less space for cabling.\n\nChoice of two batteries:\n\nThe new Taycan is fitted with Porsche’s Performance Battery as standard equipment. It has a gross capacity of 79.2 kWh. This highly efficient unit delivers impressive performance in the new Taycan:\n\nMaximum power: 240 kW / 326 PS*\n\nOverboost power for Launch Control: 300 kW / 408 PS*\n\nMaximum torque: 345 Nm\n\nElectric range**: 369 km\n\nRecharging time^ (AC, 11 kW, 0% to up to 100%): 8.0 h (Performance Battery)\n\nRecharging time^ (DC, 50 kW, 5% up to 80%): 93 min\n\nRechanging time^ (DC, maximum charging power, 5% up to 80%): 22.5 min\n\nPorsche’s Performance Battery Plus package is available as an option. It increases gross battery capacity to 93.4 kWh, delivering even greater performance:\n\nMaximum power: 280 kW / 380 PS*\n\nOverboost power for Launch Control: 350 kW / 476 PS*\n\nMaximum torque: 357 Nm\n\nElectric range**: 434 km\n\nRecharging time^ (AC, 11 kW, 0% up to 100%): 9.0 hours\n\nRecharging time^ (DC, 50 kW, 5% up to 80%): 93 minutes\n\nRechanging time^ (DC, maximum charging power, 5% up to 80%): 22.5 minutes\n\nThe battery, whichever is specified in the Taycan, is located in the vehicle’s underbody, providing a low centre of gravity for agile handling.\n\nThe battery is also a load-bearing structure in the Taycan and accommodates cooling and electronic components. It sits in a waterproof housing and uses sophisticated thermal management to maintain it at an optimum temperature range.\n\nInnovative electric motor:\n\nA key part of the new Taycan‘s Porsche E-Performance powertrain is its exceptionally efficient permanently excited synchronous electric motor, which is located at the rear axle.\n\nPermanently excited synchronous motors use a rotor of high-quality permanent magnets that generate a natural magnetic field. The rotor moves synchronously with the magnetic rotating field of the stator, which is why it’s called a permanently excited synchronous motor.\n\nThe frequency of the rotating field inside the stator is determined by the pulse-controlled inverter (see next section), which helps ensure high levels of motor performance.\n\nAnother feature behind the electric motor’s exceptional performance is its hairpin winding design. The stator coil’s copper wires are rectangular, rather than round, and they’re bent into the shape of a hairpin before they’re inserted into the stator’s laminated core, hence their name.\n\nThis hairpin design means the wires can be packed in more densely, increasing the amount of copper in the stator.\n\nConventional electric motor winding processes have a copper filling factor of 45 to 50 per cent. Porsche’s hairpin winding design is just under 70 per cent in the Taycan. This means greater power and torque outputs for the same volume and more efficient cooling.\n\nThe power-dense electric motor on the Taycan’s rear axle is extremely compact: it’s 130 mm long and has a diameter of 245 mm.\n\nPulse-controlled inverter:\n\nThe Taycan’s electric motor is controlled by a pulse-controlled inverter.\n\nThis unit it mounted with the electric motor and converts the direct current (DC) supplied by the battery to alternating current (AC) to drive the electric motor.\n\nThis high-performance inverter has a maximum current of 600 amps and has an exceptional efficiency of 98 per cent.\n\nTwo-speed transmission:\n\nMounted to the rear axle is a two-speed transmission, a special innovation by Porsche fitted to all versions in the current Taycan range.\n\nFirst gear gives the Taycan breathtaking acceleration from a standing start. In this gear, around 15 revolutions of the electric motor represents on wheel revolution, which means a very high wheel torque.\n\nFirst gear is used mainly in Sport and Sport Plus driving modes (where Launch Control is available to use).\n\nSecond gear delivers high efficiency and power reserves, even at high speeds. It has a gear ratio of around 8:1 (eight electric motor revolutions for one wheel revolution). This means the Taycan has a top speed typical of a Porsche sport car and acceleration reserves at higher speeds.\n\nRecuperation: replenishing battery charge on the move:\n\nVehicles with internal combustion engines (powered by petrol, diesel, gas) convert their kinetic energy into heat when their brakes are used during driving.\n\nAn electric vehicle, however, can recover a large part of its kinetic energy. It can do this by using its electric motor as a generator during deceleration and then sending this newly generated electrical power to its onboard battery. This is known as recuperation.\n\nThe Taycan uses the Porsche Recuperation Management (PRM) system, a high-performance design that uses its own approach:\n\nThe Taycan’s maximum possible recuperation capacity is 265 kW, significantly more than its competitors.\n\nMaximum deceleration during recuperation is 3.8 m/s2.\n\nThe Taycan’s available kinetic energy is reserved for keeping the car moving on the road; when the driver releases the accelerator pedal, the Taycan is designed to always roll and coast as far as possible, which means it doesn’t suddenly feel like the brakes have been applied as soon as the driver lifts their right foot.\n\nOnly when the driver presses the brake pedal does recuperation occur, and it does so with a very high level of energy recovery.\n\nThe Taycan’s Porsche Recuperation Management (PRM) means the driver experiences predictable and reproducible deceleration behaviour regardless of battery charge level or temperature.\n\nDriving tests have shown that up to 90 per cent of everyday braking activities in the Taycan are done by its electric motors, not its brakes – leading to less brake pad wear. Because of this, the Taycan’s brake pad replacement schedule is now time-specified: they need to be replaced every six years.\n\nDriving modes\n\nFour separate driving modes are available in this new Taycan model variant: Range, Normal, Sport, Sport Plus. There is also an individual mode, where individual system options can be configured by the driver.\n\nEach Drive Mode applies different vehicle settings to make optimum use of the Taycan.\n\nPlease note: the Sport Plus and Individual drive modes are available only with the optional Sport Chrono Package, which includes the GT multifunction sports steering wheel and an integrated driving mode rotary switch.\n\nRange:\n\nThis driving mode is about maximising the Taycan’s efficiency to obtain the longest permissible driving range available from the battery’s state of charge.\n\nVarious functions within the car, such as the air conditioning, hydraulic pumps, and headlights, operate in their most efficient configurations.\n\nTop speed is limited to be between 90 and 140 km/h but can be over-ridden by depressing the accelerator pedal.\n\nNormal:\n\nThis is the Taycan’s basic setting. Power is delivered in a linear manner and the vehicle’s functions operate without restriction.\n\nSport:\n\nThe Sport and Sport Plus driving modes deliver the highest performance from the Taycan’s powertrain.\n\nSport mode applies driver requests more dynamically. The optionally available adaptive air suspension (which is fitted with Porsche Active Suspension Management, PASM) lowers the Taycan depending on speed. And the chassis, including the optional rear-axle steering – if specified – is adjusted to a sporty setup. The adaptive cruise control is also more dynamic, allowing more powerful acceleration.\n\nSport Plus:\n\nDriver requests are delivered even more dynamically. The Taycan’s battery cooling and heating strategies are tailored for maximum performance. The chassis’ various systems, depending on the options fitted, are optimised for maximum racetrack performance. For example, when the adaptive air suspension (optional feature) is fitted, the chassis remains in its lowest position.\n\nLaunch control\n\nLaunch control is standard fitment on the Taycan. When engaged, it delivers maximum acceleration from a standstill by using an overboost function for 2.5 seconds, which supplies extra power to the electric motor.\n\nThis results in a 0-100 km/h time of 5.4 seconds in the new rear-wheel-drive Taycan.\n\nChassis\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive Taycan sports sedan delivers the precise handling of a sports car with long-distance comfort.\n\nThe Taycan’s chassis includes a suspension layout typical in sports cars:\n\nFront: a double-wishbone suspension design (that uses forged aluminium wishbones and hollow-cast lightweight swivel bearings)\n\nRear: multi-link rear axle with forged upper aluminium wishbones and hollow-cast lower aluminium wishbones.\n\nThe suspension design uses steel coil springs with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM, see below). Adaptive air suspension with PASM is available as an option.\n\nPorsche 4D Chassis Control:\n\nThis is the centrally networked control system for the Taycan chassis. It analyses the current driving situation in all three acceleration dimensions (longitudinal, lateral, and vertical) and calculates the vehicle’s status. The fourth dimension comes about by the real-time sharing of these data with the Taycan’s chassis systems. This means the Taycan’s systems can respond to the imminent driving situation.\n\nPorsche Active Suspension Management (PASM):\n\nPorsche’s electronic shock absorber control system is fitted as standard to the Taycan. The system makes lightning-fast adjustments to each single-tube damper at each individual wheel by monitoring road-surface conditions and the current driving style. PASM ensures improved driving stability, performance and comfort.\n\nAdaptive air suspension (optional):\n\nThree-chamber adaptive air suspension is optionally available on the rear-wheel-drive Taycan.\n\nIts design allows a wide variety of spring rates in a fraction of a second, from optimum comfort to maximum sports performance. It also has a self-levelling function.\n\nThe system’s Smart Lift function automatically adjusts the Taycan’s ride height on motorways to give the best compromise between efficiency and driving comfort.\n\nThe Smart Lift function can also be programmed to lift the suspension at recurring locations, such as garage driveways.\n\nPorsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus):\n\nThis optional feature comprises an electronically controlled differential lock on the rear axle to vary the drive torque between the rear wheels.\n\nIt controls the torque applied to each wheel by selectively braking each rear wheel (such as the inner wheel on the bend to enhance agility) and by selectively locking the differential to improve traction when accelerating out of corners.\n\nRear axle steering:\n\nThe optional rear axle steering feature enhances the Taycan’s steering precision and maneuverability.\n\nAt speeds up to about 50 km/h, the rear wheels steer up to 2.8 degrees in the opposite direction to the front wheels. This has the effect of shortening the wheelbase, making steering response more dynamic and lower-speed maneuvering much easier.\n\nAt speeds above approximately 50 km/h, the rear wheels steer in the same direction as the front wheels, virtually lengthening the wheelbase and increasing stability when, for example, changing lanes on a motorway.\n\nPower Steering Plus:\n\nPower steering Plus is fitted as standard equipment to the Taycan.\n\nIt provides firm steering feel and good feedback on road surfaces and driving conditions at higher speeds\n\nIt also provides greater steering forces at lower speeds, making parking and low-speed maneuvering easier.\n\nBrakes\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive Taycan uses cast-iron brake discs front and rear. The braking system’s key dimensions are:\n\nFront brakes:\n\n360 mm diameter discs (36 mm thickness)\n\n6-piston aluminium fixed monobloc calipers\n\nRear brakes:\n\n358 mm diameter discs (28 mm thickness)\n\n4-piston aluminium fixed monobloc calipers\n\nThe brakes calipers are black in colour.\n\nWheels and tyres\n\nThe Taycan is fitted with 19-inch Taycan Aero Wheels. Their dimensions are:\n\nFront: 8.0 J x 19 ET50 with 225/55 R19 tyres\n\nRear: 10.0 J x 19 ET47 with 275/45 R19 tyres\n\nOptionally available are 20-inch Taycan Aero Wheels and 21-inch Mission E Design wheels.\n\nDriving performance\n\nThe rear-wheel drive Taycan’s performance figures underline the capabilities of Porsche E-Performance. Its key figures are:\n\n0 – 100 km/h: 5.4 seconds\n\nTop speed: 230 km/h\n\nStanding-start quarter mile: 13.7 seconds\n\nElectric range**: 369 km (434 km with Performance Battery Plus)\n\nRecharging the Taycan in Australia\n\nTwo recharging ports are fitted to the Taycan: one on each side of the car, just forward of the front doors.\n\nThe Mobile Charger Connect, which provides intelligent charging functions, including wall mount and 2.5-metre cable, are included as standard.\n\nA 150 kW onboard DC charger for recharging at public stations with a voltage of 400 volts is also included as standard.\n\nThe following recharging cable connections are also included:\n\nSupply cable for domestic electrical sockets\n\nSupply cable for red industrial electrical outlets (400 V, 32 A, 5 pin)\n\nSupply cable for blue industrial electrical outlets (230 V, 32 A, 3 pin)\n\nCharging cable (mode 3) for charging at public AC charging pedestals with 4.5-metre length\n\nThe Porsche charging dock and Home Energy Manager are also included.\n\nTaycan owners in Australia have several ways to recharge. They include High Performance Charging, Home Charging, and Porsche Destination Charging.\n\n-- High Performance Charging:\n\nTaycan buyers receive a complimentary three-year subscription to Australia’s Chargefox& Ultra-Rapid DC charging network (with recharging units up to 350 kW) and selected Chargefox&-managed Fast DC charging sites (mostly 50 kW).\n\nTheir subscription starts on the day they take delivery of their new Taycan.\n\nOwners can download the Chargefox& app via Google Play or the Apple App Store.\n\nHome charging:\n\nTaycan buyers can have their home recharging installation requirements assessed by Jet Charge. This can be arranged by Porsche Centre sales consultants at time of purchase.\n\nThe Home Energy Manager (standard inclusion) can optimise vehicle recharging in terms of performance, time and costs by continually monitoring the available power output supply and the power requirements of the Taycan.\n\nPorsche Destination Charging:\n\nThe Porsche Destination Charging Network in Australia continues to grow across metropolitan and regional sites. Taycan owners can use these complimentary charging facilities when they’re on the road. Porsche owners can find charging locations by visiting the Porsche Destination Charging network online.\n\nCharging the Taycan\n\nCharging an electric car, such as the Porsche Taycan, is simple. But some of the numbers and terms involved will be new to many people. Watch Kate Reid explain what it all means.\n\nPorsche Electric sport sound\n\nEvery fan knows the unmistakable sound of a Porsche flat-six-cylinder engine. But electric cars have their own quiet soundtrack.\n\nThe optional Porsche Electric Sport Sound for the Taycan has been skillfully composed to produce a sportscar sound to match the Taycan’s personality and driving status. It emits a vehicle driving sound that’s more emotionally charged and richer, with an innovative character inside and outside the car.\n\nWhen fitted, the optional Porsche Electric Sport Sound can be activated and deactivated by the driver.\n\nThe Taycan’s inbuilt Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS), however, cannot be switched off at low speeds. This system emits sound for the safety of other road users, such as pedestrians.\n\nExterior design\n\nBecause the Taycan sports sedan was designed as a fully electric vehicle from the outset, it opened up new freedoms for Porsche’s designers.\n\nDespite breaking new ground both technically and aesthetically, it’s still immediately recognisable as a Porsche.\n\nThe Taycan’s silhouette is defined by Porsche’s signature ‘fly line’, its sporty roofline that slopes downward to the rear.\n\nOther signature Porsche styling features include its sleek cabin, the drawn-in C-pillar, and the pronounced shoulders of the wings. They produce a sharply emphasised rear, typical of Porsche sportscars.\n\nThe Taycan’s pure and clean design approach features various innovative elements, such as the glass-effect rear light bar, which contains the Porshe logo. Together they signal a new era is underway.\n\nThe Taycan’s stance appears low and wide thanks in part to its compact technical components. They allow a sloping bonnet, giving the signature Porsche frontal styling.\n\nThey also allow space for two luggage compartments: one in the rear and one at the front (under the bonnet.)\n\nThe cooling air intakes are smaller than those used in a vehicle with a similar-output combustion engine. They direct air for the cooling and air conditioning systems as well as the brakes in a targeted manner.\n\nShort overhangs front and rear emphasise the sedan’s sporty proportions with a lean and muscular look.\n\nTaycan - Interior\n\nInterior design\n\nThe cleanly styled dashboard of the original 1963 911 was the inspiration behind the Taycan’s cockpit. Its design is clear and driver-focused and signals the start of a new era.\n\nThe innovative instrument cluster consists of a 16.8-inch curved display using the rounded form made famous by Porsche. Its style resembles the slim and modern appearance of high-quality smartphones and tablets.\n\nFive different display modes can be chosen for the instrument cluster: “Power Meter”, “Map”, “Extended Map”, “Reduced”, and “Night View”.\n\nThe instrument panel includes external touchscreen control panels for operating the light and chassis functions.\n\nThe wing-shaped upper and lower sections of the dashboard stretch across the entire width of the car.\n\nA central 10.9-inch infotainment display and an optional passenger display are combined to form an integrated glass band in a black-panel look, which blends in visually with the interior.\n\nAll vehicle configurations for the Taycan, such as Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), can easily be set up on the central screen via direct access.\n\nThe driver can quickly access all apps via a clearly structured and customisable home screen. Apps include navigation, telephone, media, comfort and Porsche Connect. With the optimised voice control function, drivers can access the required function even faster.\n\nThe elevated centre console in the partial-leather interior intensifies the feeling of a low, sporty seating position, as you would expect from a Porsche. It features a large 8.4-inch touch panel with haptic feedback.\n\n14-way electric Comfort seats with memory package (including steering wheel with electric height and fore/aft adjustment) are standard fitment, as is the advanced two-zone climate control system.\n\nThermally insulated privacy glass is also fitted.\n\nEvery detail of the Taycan’s interior has been reduced to the essentials. Like the Porsche 918 Spyder, the Taycan has a compact direction selector switch in the instrument panel instead of the classic gear lever. This gives the centre console a tidy look and creates storage space.\n\nPorsche Communication Management (PCM)\n\nThe entry-level Taycan is fitted with the latest Porsche Communication Management (PCM) and Porsche Connect.\n\nPorsche infotainment system update\n\nThe sixth generation of Porsche Communication Management (PCM) now has many new functions.\n\nThey’re operated via the Taycan’s inbuilt high-resolution 10.9-inch full HD touchscreen.\n\nThe Taycan’s audio and communication system includes an LTE communication module with embedded SIM card and internet access.\n\nThey Taycan’s Porsche Connect services include:\n\nOnline navigation\n\nMobile phone preparation\n\nAudio interface\n\nVoice control\n\nMusic streaming2\n\nNative Spotify\n\nOnline radio\n\nAccess to remote services\n\nE-mobility services including charge management, control of vehicle parking pre-climatisation, or range management\n\nPlus others1.\n\nThe Porsche Connect system in the Taycan supports both Apple® CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nThe Sound Package Plus is fitted as standard (a BOSE Surround Sound-System with 14 speakers (including subwoofer) and 710 Watts of output is optionally available).\n\nBy the numbers\n\n300 kW / 408 PS* (horsepower) overboost power with launch control (350 kW / 476 PS* with Performance Battery Plus)\n\n345 Nm maximum torque (357 Nm with Performance Battery Plus)\n\nPermanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PSM)\n\nTwo-speed transmission\n\n230 km/h top speed\n\n5.4 seconds 0 – 100 km/h\n\n369 km electric range** (434 km with Performance Battery Plus)\n\nIn summary: The new Taycan, the first rear-wheel drive variant of Porsche’s all-electric sportscar, offers sustainable high performance in a package that’s perfect for every day driving.\n\nDriving comfort and dynamics\n\nPorsche Stability Management (PSM)\n\nPorsche Active Suspension Management (PASM)\n\nIntegrated Porsche 4D Chassis Control\n\nRear-axle steering (optional)\n\nPorsche Torque Vectoring Plus (optional)\n\nAdaptive Air Suspension (optional)\n\nCross Road Assist\n\nLane Change Assist\n\nWarn and Brake Assist, including Pedestrian protection\n\nAudio and communication\n\nPorsche Communication Management (PCM) with 10.9-inch HD touch display including navigation, mobile phone preparation, audio interface and voice control\n\nPorsche Connect with Apple Car Play and Android Auto\n\nMusic streaming2\n\nSpotify integration\n\nOnline radio\n\nAccess to remote services\n\nE-mobility services including charge management, control of vehicle parking pre-climatisation, or range management\n\nSound package Plus\n\nBOSE® Surround-Sound system (optional)\n\nAustralian standard specifcations\n\nLED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Light System Plus (PDLS Plus)\n\n14-way Comfort seats with memory package\n\nSteering wheel heating\n\nAutomatically dimming mirrors\n\nElectrically-folding exterior mirrors\n\nWindscreen with Grey top tint\n\nPrivacy glazing\n\nTyre sealant with electric air compressor\n\nPower steering Plus\n\nComfort Access\n\nParkAssist (front and rear) including Surround View\n\nHead-Up Display\n\nActive Lane Keeping including Traffic Jam Assist and Emergency Assist\n\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nSide airbags in rear compartment\n\nDigital radio\n\nPublic charging cable (Mode 3)\n\n150 kW On-board DC Charger\n\nMobile Charger Connect\n\nPorsche Charging Dock\n\nHome Energy Manager\n\nWarranty and Service Pricing\n\n3-year / unlimited kilometre warranty\n\n2-year, 30,000 kilometre service intervals\n\nService pricing varies from state to state due to different labour rates.

But now there’s an entry-level variant that lowers the entry price, putting it within striking range of arguably the reason for it’s being: the pioneering Tesla Model S.\"\n\nFeann Torr, Carsales.com.au (Full review here)\n\n\"A new version of the this luxury brand’s electric car has just hit the road and surprisingly it trumps its siblings. Rear-wheel drive means a purer sporting drive experience, and for most, it has all the performance you need.\"\n\nIain Curry, news.com.au (Full review here)\n\n\"Porsche’s most affordable Taycan contrasts its older siblings but shines as brightly.Spending some time in the new entry-level Taycan has enabled me to better understand its more capable and more expensive siblings and perhaps explore a little more of their bountiful breadth, but now I’m ready for the training wheels to come off, I don’t think I want to graduate after all.\"\n\nDaniel Gardner, Wheels (Full review here)\n\n\"The new Taycan looks and drives like a 21st century Porsche. It has the looks, the dynamism, and the style you’d expect. And I reckon it’s better value than the 4S, once outfitted with a few well-chosen options.\"\n\nGlenn Butler, DRIVE.com.au (Full review here)\n\n\"Porsche is one of the most iconic car manufacturers in the world, however what it’s often not given enough credit for is the amazing product planning. If you want an awesome electric vehicle for daily use that carries all the essential credentials of what is arguably Germany’s best automaker, the rear-wheel drive Taycan will absolutely not disappoint.\"\n\nAlborz Fallah, CarExpert.com.au (Full review here)\n\n\"The new Taycan variant is designed to appeal to people that like the characteristics of a rear-wheel drive vehicle. It retains all that is great about the Taycan but just adds a playfulness to the drive experience that's very appealing.\"\n\nTim Nicholson, CarsGuide.com.au (Full review here)\n\n\"Our first impression as we thread our way through Noosa’s many multi-lane roundabouts is that like all entry-level Porsches, the base Taycan has more than enough power and plenty of dynamic appeal.\"\n\nHaitham Razagui, GoAuto.com.au (Full review here)\n\n\"It feels more playful and engaging than its more powerful siblings on a twisty country road. I’d say the Taycan RWD might just be the pick of the range.\"\n\nStephen Ottley, Speedcafe.com (Full review here)\n\n\"Unlike traditional large sedans the Taycan showcases a sporty profile. It’s an ideal cocktail for those looking to immerse themselves in the Porsche experience for the first time.\"\n\nBrett Davis, PerformanceDrive.com.au (Full review here)\n\nInfo\n\nMore information for consumers: here.\n\nMore information for media: here or contact press@porsche.com.au\n\n** The published consumption (l/100km and Wh/km), emissions (g/km) and kilometre (km) range figures are determined by Porsche AG testing in accordance with ADR 81/02 on test vehicles. Actual figures will vary as they are dependent on many factors, including without limitation: individual driving style, road and traffic conditions, environmental conditions, fuel quality, a vehicle’s or battery’s condition, load and use. Extra features and accessories (eg: equipment, wheels or tyres used etc.) can change relevant vehicle parameters such as weight, rolling resistance and aerodynamics and can also affect the consumption, emission, range and performance values of a vehicle. CO₂ emissions can also be generated at the power source when vehicles are being recharged, unless 100% renewable energy is used. Generally, consumption, emissions, kilometre range and charging times will vary from the published figures in real world Australian driving and charging conditions.\n\n^The specified charging outputs and times (hour/minutes) are dependent on various factors: in general, the charging output and time can vary due to physical and chemical limits, depending on factors such as the available output of the country-specific energy infrastructure, the customer's own domestic installation, the temperature, interior pre-conditioning and charging status, as well as the age of the battery. Charging times may therefore be significantly higher than those specified. To achieve the optimum value of the specified DC charging time (DC = direct current) for a charge status increase from 5 to 80%, a CCS (combined charging system) fast-charging pedestal with > 270kW and > 850V is required, as well as a battery temperature of 30°–35°C. The charging status when commencing charging must not exceed 5%. For physical and chemical reasons, the charging speed decreases as the battery approaches its full capacity. Therefore, it usually makes sense to use fast DC charging to charge the battery up to 80% or up to the required range. The predominant use of CCS fast charging pedestals leads to a long-term increase in charging times. For regular fast DC charging, we recommend a maximum charging output of 50kW. When charging in a domestic environment, AC charging (AC = alternating current) is recommended. Using an (AC) industrial electrical outlet will result in improved efficiency and a much shorter charging time compared to using a household socket.\n\nPublished figures should only be used for the purpose of comparison between vehicles.
