        "text": "Good that you have done your research on down side of KDSS.\n\nKDSS is a nice system. One of my buddies got his 4Runner with KDSS before I started 4Runners and like it till date. He loves the on road feeling and occasional camp ground / gravel roads. He hasn't lift his and join us with offroad drives no matter what we say. He just love on road feel driving fast on mountain roads. (I know its a 4Runner not a sports car but that's his way.)\n\nYou will not get KDSS lean if you install a lift with a knowledgeable 4x4 shop.\n\nWhen you get KDSS leaks or failure as far as I can remember the part was $1500 or something here in Colorado (based on the post I see on my FB group). Or $4,256.00 as per one of the members in this forum.\n\nIf you want to go with out KDSS going to SR5 is not the right direction. You can get TRD Offroad with out KDSS and TRD Pro.\n\nNo you cannot remove KDSS after you get your TRD ORP with KDSS when it fails. It will show warnings on dash (from what I see online) unless you find a way to fix the sway bar in.\n\nWhen you want to lift search what kits goes well with the KDSS as it has some limitations. A good kit will solve the common problems of KDSS.\n\nWhen you are ready for sliders and skids buy the ones that support KDSS. Else it would be a pain, like trimming TRD Pro front skid for KDSS. Also look for KDSS skid plate as that is as a vulnerable place for trail damage. If you do snow driving make sure you clean properly to avoid corrosion problems with KDSS.\n\nAgain KDSS is a good system made by a company called Kinetic Pvt Ldt in Australia (hence got the name Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System) loved by some owners including my buddy.\n\nJust reaching out because I see you live in Canada.... Just wanted to give you my 2 cents on KDSS.\n\nI have a 2013 Trail that my KDSS light has just come on because of a leak in my lines.\n\nAre you hoping to keep this truck for a long time? Reason I ask, here in Ontario, Toyota has quoted me 9700.00 parts and labour to replace. (8165.00 for the parts with tax)\n\nKDSS has been amazing, but Toyota made it easy for me to say no to that bill!\n\nI reached out to Toyota corporate as well to inquire and they will not help. Fair enough, it’s a 7 year old truck.\n\nThe ride quality with KDSS was amazing, but for my situation, knowing I wanted to keep this till it dies, obviously I now wish I never bought the KDSS option living in an area where roads get salted.\n\nToyota gets so much business because of their reputation in regards to being reliable, but I do think people should be aware that although KDSS is great, it can break down and it’s costly to fix.\n\nIt definitely rides better with it. No question. I’m not trying to sway you against it, I just always see people on forums talking about it as if it’s indestructible and clearly it is not.. Especially if you live in an area with salt on the roads ... I was shocked to find out a 1700 option becomes almost a 10k repair bill 7 years later here in Canada.\n\nIf you get the KDSS option, keep it clean and oiled!! (FYI though, I thought I did a good job at this over the years. It wasn’t as if this truck was neglected)\n\nGood luck with your purchase. Other than buying the KDSS option, I have zero regrets.\n\nWhere is it leaking? At the cylinders, or at the accumulator? I have heard of issues where the accumulator had issues due to dirt and debris building up in the little skid plate under it.\n\nThanks for sharing you experience. I was lucky when I buy my TRD ORP there were plenty of information available on KDSS problems, I bet which wasn't in your case in 2013. Even I would have jumped on a KDSS seeing the benefits.\n\nAs for the cost I bet it would change where the failure is and I see low as $1500 for parts in one of the groups I'm in. I say it would be a good idea if you check with a different dealership to see how much they would quote to fix.\n\nI guess another option would be a total KDSS remove. I thought I saw somewhere where the owner compress the piston and remove kdss. Not sure where I saw that, may be on the other 4runner forum (the .org one) i guess.\n\nHope you will solve it with out too much damage on your pocket.."
