        "text": "Quoted in Go-Auto E-News, designer Mike Simcoe had this to say about the exterior:\n\n“It’s good, confident design. It’s well proportioned and it pushes quality to a level that we’ve never seen before. The interior package for VT was king of that in the market here – and this car continues that. The volume efficiency of the package – that’s the exterior volume to interior size – is just as aggressive as VT was. We made a big song and dance back then about that. And this car is the same.\n\n“The track is a little bit wider with this new architecture, so from the ground up we’ve been able to put the wheels wider on the car.\n\n“It’s an international design. You can’t say ‘European’ any more, because there’s no ‘European design’, or ‘Japanese design’ – it’s a truly international design in its form language. It’s genuinely a rear-wheel drive proportioned car which is something we hadn’t been able to push as hard in the past. And it’s much more formal. The form language that’s on the car is internal Holden. We’ve been trying to do something like this seriously for a long time.”\n\nI mean, WTF does all that mean? Where are the important details on the body? What’s the coefficient of aerodynamic drag? What are the coefficients of front and rear lift? How has the exterior been optimised for frontal pedestrian impact safety? How do the shapes of the doors help in side impacts? Was the wider track (I assume that’s what “we’ve been able to put the wheels wider on the car” means) done only for appearance?! How can you apparently justify no improvement in interior packaging after nearly 10 years of automotive development?\n\nWhat came first – the exterior stylists’ wet dream or the functionality of the car?\n\nAnd what if other industrial designers behaved like this?\n\n“Here’s your new Nikon digital SLR, sir. Note how the lens mount combines with the form language of the body and how we’ve pushed the corners out in an aggressively positive volume efficiency design language to give formal non-Japanese proportions…”\n\nYou really have to wonder."
