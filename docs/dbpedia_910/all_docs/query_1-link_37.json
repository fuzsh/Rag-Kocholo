To calculate roll rates, it uses the following formula: \nRoll rate= WH / (desired total roll gradient) \n \nHowever, in the first example, W is the full weight of the car, but in the second one, it's only the sprung weight. Also, in this paper from OptimumG it uses the full weight too http://www.optimumg.com/docs/Springs%26Dampers_Tech_Tip_2.pdf \n \nYou get quite different",
