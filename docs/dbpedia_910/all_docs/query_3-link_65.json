With its compact size, lightweight, and small engine capacity, the Swift is an excellent choice for navigating city streets. The five-door hatchback offers front-wheel drive and is perfect for urban commuting.

The Mazda2 mini-car exemplifies this reputation.\n\nAlthough the Mazda2's entry model underwent its last generational change in 2014, its core features have remained unchanged. It offers various grades, including five-door hatch and four-door sedan options, powered by a reliable 1.5-litre naturally-aspirated four-cylinder petrol engine. The engine, which honestly is not super exciting with a modest power output, can be paired with either a manual or automatic transmission, delivering power to the front wheels.\n\nKey Features of Mazda2:\n\n360-degree view monitor\n\nAdvanced keyless entry\n\nFront parking sensors\n\nRear cross traffic alert (RCTA)\n\nSmart city brake support (SCBS) with pedestrian recognition\n\nWhat’s good about it?\n\nFront grille options\n\nClimate control air conditioning\n\nWell-equipped starter package\n\nWhat’s not so good about it?\n\nNeed to strain the engine to make it enjoyable\n\nNoisy on the highway\n\nBoot space\n\n4.

Notably, in 2015, it transitioned from a 3.0-litre to a more powerful 2.8-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine (which received further power enhancements in 2021). While the basic body design remains unchanged, the Prado offers a spacious wagon configuration with the option for up to eight seats and a focus on off-road capability.\n\nAs a proper off-roader, the Prado boasts features such as dual fuel tanks (for models with the spare tyre mounted on the tailgate), enhancing its suitability for the outback. When considering a used Prado, it's important to investigate its history and usage. For instance, the presence of a heavy-duty towbar may indicate extensive towing of large caravans, while underbody scars may suggest challenging off-road adventures. Conduct thorough research to understand the vehicle's previous experiences and make an informed decision.\n\nKey Features of Toyota Prado:\n\nToyota’s Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System\n\nAdaptive Variable Suspension system\n\nCrawl Control\n\nMulti-Terrain Select system\n\nActive cruise control - High speeds\n\nWhat’s good about it?\n\nPowerful off-road capabilities\n\nExtended warranty\n\nLong list of standard features\n\nWhat’s not so good about it?\n\nEngine noise\n\nDashboard plastic seems cheap\n\nHeadroom for taller adults\n\n5.

Despite enduring various extreme stunts, including being dropped off a demolished 23-storey building, the Hilux proved resilient and ready for more. While luck may have played a role, the Hilux's solid foundation is undeniable. The car is extensively engineered in Australia, catering to the demands of local roads. While it's not indestructible, as the marketing suggests (no car is), the Hilux has a track record of enduring significant punishment before meeting its end.\n\nIt's important to note potential issues with diesel particulate filters (DPF). Toyota faced significant problems with DPF failures but has since implemented manual override options for cleaning the system and improved support in case of malfunctions.

The boxer engine layout ensures smooth and refined performance, while the all-wheel drive system enhances handling confidence, especially on slippery surfaces.\n\nThe Forester doesn't compromise on interior space, offering generous cabin room for occupants. The equipment levels are also commendable, with a particular emphasis on safety features. Overall, the Forester proves itself as a worthy vehicle, combining practicality, versatility, and high safety standards.\n\nKey Features of Subaru Forester:\n\nDriver monitoring system\n\n18-inch alloy wheels\n\nReverse automatic braking\n\nHeated seats\n\nPremium upholstery\n\nWhat’s good about it?\n\nSymmetrical AWD\n\nSpacious and practical interior\n\nStrong safety record\n\nWhat’s not so good about it?\n\nPick-up acceleration is slow\n\nInterior design and materials could be more premium\n\nInfotainment system interface is laggy\n\n8.
