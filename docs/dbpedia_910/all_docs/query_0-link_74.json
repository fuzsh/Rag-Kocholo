Although a mix of small spacecraft propulsion devices have established flight heritage, the market for new propulsion products continues to prove dynamic and evolving. In some instances, systems and components with past flight heritage are being reconsidered to meet the needs of smaller spacecraft. This approach minimizes new product development risk and time to market by creating devices similar to those with existing spaceflight heritage, although accounting for small spacecraft volume, mass, power, safety and cost considerations. Such incremental advancement benefits from existing spaceflight data, physics-based models, and customer acceptance of the heritage technologies, which eases mission infusion. In other instances, novel technologies are being conceived specifically for small spacecraft using innovative approaches to propulsion system design, manufacturing, and integration. While the development of novel technologies typically carries a higher risk and slower time to market, these new technologies strive to offer small spacecraft a level of propulsive capability not easily matched through the miniaturization of heritage technologies. Such novel devices are often highly integrated and optimized to minimize the use of a small spacecraft’s limited resources, lower the product cost, and simplify integration. Regardless of the development approach, the extensive investments by commercial industry, academia, and government to develop new propulsion products for small spacecraft suggests long-term growth in the availability of propulsion devices with increasingly diverse capabilities.\n\nIn the near-term, the surge in public and private investments in small spacecraft propulsion technologies, combined with the immaturity of the overall small spacecraft market, has resulted in an abundance of confusing, unverified, sometimes conflicting, and otherwise incomplete technical literature. Furthermore, the rush by many device developers to secure market share has resulted in some confusion surrounding the true readiness of these devices for mission infusion. As third parties independently verify device performance, and end-users demonstrate these new devices in their target environments, the true maturity, capability, and flight readiness of these devices will become evident. In the meantime, this report will attempt to reduce confusion by compiling a list of publicly described small spacecraft propulsion devices, identifying publicly available technical literature for further consideration, recognizing missions of potential significance, and organizing the data to improve comprehension for both neophytes and subject matter experts.\n\nThis chapter avoids a direct technology maturity assessment (TMA) based on the NASA Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale, recognizing insufficient in-depth technical insight into current propulsion devices to perform such an assessment accurately and uniformly. An accurate TRL assessment requires a high degree of technical knowledge on a subject device as well as an understanding of the intended spacecraft bus and target environment. While the authors strongly encourage a TMA that is well-supported with technical data prior to infusing technologies into programs, the authors believe TRLs are most accurately assessed within the context of a program’s unique requirements. Rather than attempting to assess TRL in the absence of sufficient data, this chapter introduces a novel classification system that simply recognizes Progress toward Mission Infusion (PMI) as an indicator of the efficacy of the manufacturers’ approach to system maturation and mission infusion. PMI should not be confused with TRL as PMI does not directly assess technology maturity. However, PMI may prove insightful in early trade studies. The PMI classification system used herein is described in detail in Section 4.4.2.\n\n4.1.1 Document Organization\n\nThis chapter organizes the state-of-the-art in small spacecraft propulsion into the following categories:\n\nIn-Space Chemical Propulsion (4.6.1)\n\nIn-Space Electric Propulsion (4.6.2)\n\nIn-Space Propellant-less Propulsion (4.6.3)\n\nEach of these categories is further subdivided by the prevailing technology types. The subsections organize data on each prevailing technology type as follows:\n\nTechnology Description\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nCurrent & Planned Missions\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nNotable Advancements\n\nThe organizational approach introduces newcomers to each technology, presents technology-specific integration and operation concerns for the reader’s awareness, highlights recent or planned missions that may raise the TRL of specific devices, and tabulates procurable devices of each technology. Some sections also include an incomplete list of notable advancements. While the key integration and operational considerations are not comprehensive, they provide initial insights that may influence propulsion system selection. In the cases where a device has a long history of spaceflight, this chapter reviews only select missions.\n\n4.2 Public Data Sources and Disclaimers\n\nThis chapter is a survey of small spacecraft propulsion technologies as discussed in open literature and does not endeavor to be an original source. As such, this chapter only considers literature found in the public domain to identify and classify devices. Commonly used sources for public data include manufacturer datasheets, press releases, conference papers, journal papers, public filings with government agencies, and news articles.\n\nThis chapter summarizes device performance, capabilities, and flight history, as presented in publicly available literature. Data not appropriate for public dissemination, such as proprietary, export controlled, or otherwise restricted data, are not considered. As such, actual device maturity and flight history may be more or less extensive than what is documented herein. Device manufacturers should be consulted for the most up-to-date and relevant data before performing a TMA.\n\nThis chapter’s primary data source is literature produced by device manufacturers. Unless otherwise published, do not assume independent verification of device performance and capabilities. Performance and capabilities described may be speculative or otherwise based on limited data.\n\nThe information presented is not intended to be exhaustive but to provide a general overview of current state-of-the-art technologies and their development status. It should be noted that technology maturity designations may vary with change to payload, mission requirements, reliability considerations, and/or the environment in which performance was demonstrated. Readers are highly encouraged to reach out to companies for further information regarding the performance and maturity of the described technology. There is no intention of mentioning certain companies and omitting others based on their technologies or relationship with NASA.\n\nSuggestions or corrections for this document should be submitted to the NASA Small Spacecraft Virtual Institute Agency-SmallSat-Institute@mail.nasa.gov for consideration prior to the publication of future issues. When submitting comments, please cite appropriate publicly accessible references. Private correspondence is not considered an adequate reference.\n\n4.3 Definitions\n\nDevice refers to a component, subsystem, or system, depending on the context.\n\nTechnology refers to a broad category of devices or intangible materials, such as processes.\n\n4.4 Technology Maturity\n\n4.4.1 Application of the TRL Scale to Small Spacecraft Propulsion Systems\n\nNASA has a well-established guideline for performing TMAs, described in detail in the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (1). A TMA determines a device’s technological maturity, which is usually communicated according to the NASA TRL scale. The TRL scale is defined in NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 7123 (2). The NASA Systems Engineering Handbook and NPR 7123 can be accessed through the NASA Online Directives Information System (NODIS) library. Assessment of TRLs for components, systems, or software allows for coherent communication between technologists, program managers, and other stakeholders regarding the maturity of a technology. Furthermore, TRL is a valuable tool to communicate the potential risk associated with the infusion of technologies into programs. For TRLs to be applied across all technology categories, the NASA TRL definitions are written broadly and rely on subject matter experts (SME) in each discipline to interpret appropriately.\n\nRecently, U.S. Government propulsion SMEs suggested an interpretation of the TRL scale specifically for micro-propulsion. The Micro-Propulsion Panel of the JANNAF Spacecraft Propulsion Subcommittee in 2019 published the JANNAF Guidelines for the Application of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) to Micro-Propulsion Systems (3). The guideline was recently updated in 2022 to reflect the latest community input (4). This guideline suggests an interpretation of TRL for micro-propulsion and reflects both NASA and DOD definitions for TRL. The JANNAF panel consists of participants from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Glenn Research Center (GRC), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The panel further receives feedback from the non-Government propulsion community. While this JANNAF guideline focuses on micro-propulsion (e.g., CubeSats), the guideline still has relevance to rigorously assessing TRLs for the more general category of small spacecraft in-space propulsion. By establishing a common interpretation of TRL for small spacecraft propulsion, a more coherent and consistent communication of technology maturity can occur between small spacecraft propulsion providers and stakeholders. The JANNAF guideline is open to unlimited distribution and may be requested from the Johns Hopkins University Energetics Research Group (JHU ERG). Ensure the use of the latest JANNAF guideline, as the guideline may continue to evolve with further community input.\n\nA fundamental limitation of the JANNAF guideline for TRL assessment, and TMA in general, is an assumption of in-depth technical knowledge of the subject device. In the absence of detailed technical knowledge, especially in a broad technology survey as presented herein, a TMA may be conducted inaccurately or inconsistently. Furthermore, assessment of TRL assumes an understanding of the end-user application. The same device may be concluded to be at different TRLs for infusion into different missions. For example, a device may be assessed at a high TRL for application to low-cost small spacecraft in low-Earth orbits, while assessed at a lower TRL for application to geosynchronous communication satellites or NASA interplanetary missions due to different mission requirements. Differences in TRL assessment based on the operating environment may result from considerations such as thermal environment, mechanical loads, mission duration, or radiation exposure. Propulsion-specific variances between missions might include propellant type, total propellant throughput, throttle set-points, burn durations, and the total number of on/off cycles. As such, an accurate TRL assessment not only requires an in-depth technical understanding of a device’s development history, including specifics on past flight-qualification activities, but also an understanding of mission-specific environments and interfaces. The challenge of assessing an accurate TRL in a broad technology survey poses a significant burden for data collection, organization, and presentation. Such activities are better suited for programs seeking to infuse new technologies into their missions.\n\nGiven the rapid evolution of small spacecraft propulsion technologies and the variety of mission environments, as well as generally limited device technical details in open literature, the propulsion chapter implements a novel system to classify technical maturity according to Progress toward Mission Infusion (PMI). This novel classification system is not intended to replace TRL but is a complementary tool to provide initial insight into device maturity when it is not yet feasible to accurately and consistently apply the TRL scale. This novel classification system is discussed in detail below.\n\nReaders are strongly encouraged to perform more in-depth technical research on candidate devices based on the most up-to-date information available, as well as to assess risk within the context of their specific mission(s). A thoughtful TMA based on the examination of detailed technical data through consultation with device manufactures can reduce program risk and increase the likelihood of program success. This survey is not intended to replace the readers’ own due diligence. Rather, this survey and PMI seek to provide early insights that may assist in propulsion system down-select to a number of devices where an in-depth TMA becomes feasible.\n\n4.4.2 Progress Toward Mission Infusion (PMI)\n\nRather than directly assessing a device’s technical maturity via TRL, propulsion devices described herein are classified according to evidence of progress toward mission infusion. This is a novel classification system first introduced in this survey. Assessing the PMI of devices in a broad survey, where minimal technical insight is available, may assist with down-selecting propulsion devices early in mission concept development. Once a handful of devices are identified as possible solutions for a specific mission concept, a detailed TMA and rigorous TRL assessment should be conducted. The PMI classification system sort devices into one of four broad technology development categories: Concept, In-Development, Engineering-to-Flight, and Flight-Demonstrated. The following sections describe the PMI classification system in-detail. Furthermore, figure 4.1 summarizes the PMI classifications.\n\nConcept, ‘C’\n\nThe Concept classification reflects devices in an early stage of development, characterized by feasibility studies and the demonstration of fundamental physics. Concept devices typically align with the NASA TRL range of 1 to 3. At a minimum, these devices are established as scientifically feasible, perhaps through a review of relevant literature and/or analytical analysis. These devices may even include experimental verification that supports the validity of the underlying physics. These devices may even include notional designs. While Concept devices are generally not reviewed herein, particularly promising Concept devices will be classified in tables with a ‘C’.\n\nIn-Development, ‘D’\n\nThe In-Development classification reflects the bulk of devices being actively matured and covered in this survey, where only a modest number of devices may progress to regular spaceflight. In-Development devices typically align with the NASA TRL range of 4 to 5. While In-Development devices may have specific applications attributed by their developers, no selection for a specific mission has been publicly announced. In the absence of a specific mission, device development activities typically lack rigorous system requirements and a process for independent requirement validation. Furthermore, qualification activities conducted in the absence of a specific mission typically require a delta-qualification to address mission-specific requirements. At a minimum, In-Development devices are low-fidelity devices that have been operated in an appropriate environment to demonstrate basic functionality and support prediction of the device’s ultimate capabilities. They may even be medium- or high-fidelity devices operated in a simulated final environment, but lacking a specific mission pull to define requirements and a qualification program. They may even be medium- or high-fidelity devices operated in a spaceflight demonstration but lacking sufficient fidelity or demonstrated capability to reflect the anticipated final product. These devices are typically described as a technology push, rather than a mission pull. In-Development devices will be classified in tables with a ‘D’.\n\nEngineering-to-Flight, ‘E’\n\nThe Engineering-to-Flight classification reflects devices with a publicly announced spaceflight opportunity. This classification does not necessarily imply greater technical maturity than the In-Development classification, but it does assume the propulsion device developer is receiving mission-specific requirements to guide final development and qualification activities. Furthermore, the Engineering-to-Flight classification assumes a mission team performed due diligence in the selection of a propulsion device, and the mission team is performing regular activities to validate that the propulsion system requirements are met. Thus, while the PMI classification system does not directly assess technical maturity, there is an underlying assumption of independent validation of mission-specific requirements, where a mission team does directly consider technical maturity in the process of device selection and mission infusion. Engineering-to-Flight devices typically align with the NASA TRL range of 5 to 6. At a minimum, these are medium-fidelity devices that have been operated in a simulated final environment and demonstrate key capabilities relative to the requirements of a specific mission. These devices may even be actively undergoing or have completed a flight qualification program. These devices may even include a spaceflight, but in which key capabilities failed to be demonstrated or further engineering is required. These devices may even include a previously successful spaceflight, but the devices are now being applied in new environments or platforms that necessitate design modifications and/or delta-qualification. These devices must have a specific mission pull documented in open literature. A design reference mission (DRM) may be considered in place of a specific mission pull, given detailed documentation in open literature, which includes a description of the DRM, well-defined propulsion system requirements, maturation consistent with the DRM requirements, and evidence of future mission need consistent with the DRM. Engineering-to-Flight devices will be classified in tables with an ‘E’.\n\nFlight-Demonstrated, ‘F’\n\nThe Flight-Demonstrated classification reflects devices where a successful technology demonstration or genuine mission has been conducted and described in open literature. Flight-Demonstrated devices typically align with the NASA TRL range of 7 to 9. These devices are high-fidelity components or systems (in fit, form, and function) that have been operated in the target in-space environment (e.g., low-Earth orbit, GEO, deep space) on an appropriate platform, where all key capabilities were successfully demonstrated. These devices may even be final products, which have completed genuine missions (not simply flight demonstrations). These devices may even be in repeat production and routine use for several missions. The devices must be described in open literature as successfully demonstrating key capabilities in the target environment to be considered Flight-Demonstrated. If a device has flown, but the outcome is not publicly known, the classification will remain Engineering-to-Flight. Flight-Demonstrated devices will be classified in tables with an ‘F’.\n\n4.5 Overview of In-Space Propulsion Technology Types\n\nIn-space small spacecraft propulsion technologies are generally categorized as (i) chemical, (ii) electric, or (iii) propellant-less. This chapter surveys propulsion devices within each technology category. Additionally, liquid-propellant acquisition and management devices are reviewed as an important component of in-space propulsion systems. Although other key subsystems have not yet been reviewed, such as small spacecraft propulsion power processing units, they may be included in future updates of this publication. Table 4-1 lists the in-space propulsion technologies reviewed. Figure 4.2 graphically illustrates the range of thrust and specific impulse for these small spacecraft propulsion devices. The thrust and specific impulse ranges provided in table 4-1 and figure 4.1 only summarize the performance of small spacecraft devices covered in this survey and may not reflect the broader capability of the technologies beyond small spacecraft or the limits of what is physically possible with further technology advancement. Furthermore, propulsion systems are often highly throttleable, and the devices surveyed herein may in many cases be capable of offering performance beyond the ranges presented in table 4-1.\n\nChemical systems have enabled in-space maneuvering since the onset of the space age, proving highly capable and reliable. These include hydrazine-based systems, other mono- or bipropellant systems, hybrids, cold gas systems, and solid propellants. Typically, these systems are sought when high thrust or rapid maneuvers are required. As such, chemical systems continue to be the in-space propulsion technology of choice when their total impulse capability is sufficient to meet mission requirements.\n\nOn the other hand, the application of electric propulsion devices has been historically far more limited. While electric propulsion can provide an order of magnitude greater total impulse than chemical systems, research and development costs have typically eclipsed that of comparable chemical systems. Furthermore, electric propulsion generally provides thrust-to-power levels below 75 mN/kW. Thus, a small spacecraft capable of delivering 500 W to an electric propulsion system may generate no more than 38 mN of thrust. Therefore, while the total impulse capability of electric propulsion is generally considerable, these systems may need to operate for hundreds or thousands of hours, compared to the seconds or minutes that chemical systems necessitate for a similar impulse. That said, the high total impulse and low thrust requirements of specific applications, such as station keeping, have maintained steady investment in electric propulsion over the decades. Only in recent years has the mission pull for electric propulsion reached a tipping point where electric propulsion may overtake chemical for specific in-space applications. Electric propulsion system types considered herein include electrothermal, electrospray, gridded ion, Hall-effect, pulsed plasma and vacuum arc, and ambipolar.\n\nPropellant-less propulsion technologies such as solar sails, tethers, electric sails (and plasma brakes), and aerodynamic drag devices have long been investigated, but they have yet to move beyond small-scale demonstrations. However, growing needs such as orbital debris removal may offer compelling future applications.\n\nSome notable categories are not covered in this survey, such as nuclear in-space propulsion technologies. While substantial investment continues in such areas for deep space science and human exploration, such technologies are generally at lower TRL and typically aim to propel spacecraft substantially larger than the 180 kg wet mass limit covered by this report.\n\nWhenever possible, this survey considers complete propulsion systems, which are composed of thrusters, feed systems, pressurization systems, propellant management and storage, and power processing units, but not the electrical power supply. However, for some categories, components (e.g., thruster heads) are mentioned without consideration of the remaining subsystems necessary for their implementation. Depending on the device’s intended platform (i.e., NanoSat, MicroSat, SmallSat), the propulsion system may be either highly integrated or distributed within the spacecraft. As such, it is logical to describe highly integrated propulsion units at the system level, whereas components of distributed propulsion systems may be logically treated at the sub-system level, where components from a multitude of manufacturers may be mixed-and-matched to create a unique mission-appropriate propulsion solution.\n\n4.6 State-of-the-Art in Small Spacecraft Propulsion\n\n4.6.1 In-Space Chemical Propulsion\n\nChemical propulsion systems are designed to satisfy high-thrust impulsive maneuvers. They offer lower specific impulse compared to their electric propulsion counterparts but have significantly higher thrust to power ratios.\n\nHydrazine Monopropellant\n\nTechnology Description\n\nHydrazine monopropellant systems use catalyst structures (such as S-405 granular catalyst) to decompose hydrazine to produce hot gases. Hydrazine thrusters and systems have been in extensive use since the 1960’s. The low mass and volume of a significant number of heritage hydrazine propulsion systems makes them suitable for small spacecraft buses, and some hydrazine thrusters used on large spacecraft may be appropriate as the main propulsion system for small spacecraft. Hydrazine thrusters typically achieve a specific impulse between 200 – 235 seconds for 1-N class or larger thrusters.\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nExtensive Flight Heritage: Since hydrazine has been used extensively in spaceflight applications, the technology’s traits are well understood (4).\n\nExtensive Component Ecosystem: A robust ecosystem of components and experience exists because hydrazine systems are widely used. As such, hydrazine propulsion systems are frequently customized for specific applications using the available components.\n\nQualified for Multiple Cold Restarts: These systems have the advantage of typically being qualified for multiple cold starts.\n\nExtensive Safety and Handling Requirements: Hydrazine and its derivatives are corrosive, toxic, and potentially carcinogenic. Its vapor requires the use of Self Contained Atmospheric Protective Ensemble (SCAPE) suits. This overhead must be considered when planning ground processing workflow for spacecraft and may impose undesirable constraints on the spacecraft, the launch provider, or other spacecraft participating in the same launch opportunity. Hydrazine propulsion systems typically incorporate redundant serial valves to prevent spills or leaking vapor, which might harm ground personnel or hardware.\n\nCurrent & Planned Missions\n\nArianeGroup has developed a 1-N class hydrazine thruster that has extensive flight heritage, including use on the ALSAT-2 small spacecraft (6) (7). The company also offers a 20-N hydrazine thruster with extensive flight history, although not with small spacecraft.\n\nAerojet-Rocketdyne (L3 Harris company) has several small hydrazine thrusters with extensive flight histories. The 0.09-N MR-401, 1-N MR-103 series, 4-N MR-111G, and the 22-N MR-106L hydrazine thrusters are flight proven (8) (9) (10). In addition to four MR-107S 222-N thrusters, the OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft propulsion system has six MR-106L, sixteen MR-111G, and two MR-401 thrusters (11).\n\nMoog has the 1-N MONARC-1, 5-N MONARC-5, and 22-N MONARC-22 series hydrazine thrusters (12). These thrusters have decades-long flight histories, although primarily as attitude control thrusters in larger satellites. NASA JPL’s Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) spacecraft (a small satellite) used eight MONARC-5 thrusters (13).\n\nNorthrop Grumman has a line of hydrazine thrusters with long flight histories as attitude control thrusters for larger satellites. The thrust lines include the 1-N MRE-0.1, 5-N MRE-1.0, and 18-N MRE 4.0 (14).\n\nRafael offers 1-N, 5-N, and 25-N flight proven hydrazine thrusters (15).\n\nIHI Aerospace offers the 1-N MT-9, 4-N MT-8A, and 20-N MT-2 flight proven hydrazine thrusters (17).\n\nStellar Exploration supplied their Monopropellant CubeSat System for an EchoStar spacecraft and the CAPSTONE spacecraft. The EchoStar nanosatellite built by Tyvak has been successfully commissioned and placed in the altitude prescribed in EchoStar’s license for its S-band frequency (18). The CAPSTONE spacecraft was similarly built by Tyvak and launched on a Rocket Lab Electron from New Zealand on 28 June 2022. The CAPSTONE spacecraft is a 12U, 25 kg CubeSat that will help reduce risk for future lunar spacecraft by validating navigation technologies and verifying the dynamics of a halo-shaped orbit as planned for Gateway, the Moon-orbiting outpost that is part of NASA’s Artemis program. Although CAPSTONE experienced communication and propulsion challenges along the way, the spacecraft achieved the expected lunar orbit (19) (20) (21).\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nSee table 4-2 for current state-of-the-art hydrazine monopropellant devices applicable to small spacecraft.\n\nNotable Advances\n\nAerojet-Rocketdyne, in work sponsored by NASA GSFC, is developing a hybridization of ionic liquid and conventional hydrazine constituents to form the green hydrazine propellant blend (GHPB). “Green hydrazine” would provide the low vapor toxicity and high-density specific impulse of ionic liquids while retaining the low combustion and preheat temperatures of conventional hydrazine. This approach would provide a direct drop-in replacement for hydrazine propulsion systems. In testing completed to date, green hydrazine blends have demonstrated long-term thermal stability/storability, low shock/impact sensitivity, and good operational stability. Furthermore, they have demonstrated a 100-fold reduction in vapor pressure/toxicity and a similar low-temperature start capability as compared to pure hydrazine (22).\n\nAlternative Monopropellants and Bipropellants\n\nTechnology Description\n\nFor the past several decades, Earth storable propellants (i.e., storable at room temperature) have dominated in-space chemical propulsion systems, hydrazine for monopropellants and nitrogen tetroxide with either monomethylhydrazine or hydrazine for bipropellants. These propellants have the advantages of being ambient-temperature liquids (thus not requiring extensive thermal management) and easily ignited (catalyst for hydrazine, hypergolic for bipropellants). However, due to the extensive handling and toxicity concerns of the conventional chemical propellants, more propulsion systems using alternate propellants have been developed and adopted. Often described as “green” propellants, these alternative propellants are not necessarily benign, but are not vapor hazards like the conventional Earth storables and thus do not require specialized suits and breathing apparatus for handling.\n\nAlternative monopropellants based on ionic liquids have received extensive technology development in recent years and have been matured to flight status. Ionic liquid monopropellants are ionic salts dissolved in water and blended with a fuel. Catalysts react the aqueous ionic salt and fuel blend for combustion. Thus, these formulations are not true monopropellants, since they have fuel and oxidizer components, but functionally they are no different than monopropellants.\n\nThe two matured ionic liquid monopropellant blends are LMP-103S, which is based on ammonium dinitramide (ADN) or ASCENT (Advanced Spacecraft Energetic Non-Toxic), formally referred to as AF-M315E, which is based on Hydroxylammonium Nitrate (HAN). These monopropellants do not present a vapor hazard and can be handled with conventional personal protection equipment (gloves, face shield). Depending on the formulations, they also can offer higher specific impulse and higher density-specific impulse than monopropellant hydrazine. The challenges with ionic liquid monopropellants are that their catalysts require more preheating than hydrazine and their higher combustion temperatures require higher-temperature, with more expensive catalyst and chamber materials. The ionic liquid monopropellants are not drop-in replacements for hydrazine, although their propulsion system components are similar.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is a high-density liquid that can be catalytically decomposed exothermically like hydrazine. Hydrogen peroxide does not present a vapor hazard, although high concentrations (> 90%) can rapidly react with impurities in storage containers. Hydrogen peroxide was used extensively in the early days of space propulsion before losing favor to the higher performing hydrazine. It is now being examined again as a nontoxic alternative to hydrazine. Development efforts have focused on high-test peroxide (HTP) which have concentrations from 85 to 98%.\n\nGreen bipropellant combinations have also been developed, particularly for small satellite applications. Hydrogen peroxide and nitrous oxide have been explored as the oxidizer options with an alcohol as the fuel. A water electrolysis system breaks water down to gaseous hydrogen and gaseous oxygen, which serve as propellants for the engine. An electrolysis system, using water as the source of propellant, could enable the use of in-situ resources.\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nImproved Hazard Safety Classifications: Air Force Range Safety AFSPCMAN91-710 (23) requirements state that if a propellant is less prone to external leakage, which is often seen with the ionic liquid ‘green’ propellant systems due to higher viscosity of the propellant, then the hazardous classification is reduced. External hydrazine leakage is considered “catastrophic,” whereas using ionic liquid green propellants reduces the hazard severity classification to “critical” and possibly “marginal” per MIL-STD-882E (Standard Practice for System Safety) (24). A classification of “critical” or less only requires two-seals to inhibit external leakage, meaning no additional latch valves or other isolation devices are required in the feed system (24). While these propellants are not safe for consumption, they have been shown to be less toxic compared to hydrazine. This is primarily due to green propellants having lower vapor pressures, being less flammable, and producing more benign constituent product gases (such as water vapor, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide) when combusted.\n\nSimplified Safety and Handling Requirements: Fueling spacecraft with green propellants, generally permitted as a parallel operation, may require a smaller exclusionary zone, allowing for accelerated launch readiness operations (25). These green propellants are also generally less likely to exothermically decompose at room temperature due to higher ignition thresholds. Therefore, they require fewer inhibit requirements, fewer valve seats for power, and less stringent temperature storage requirements. The reduced hazard associated with some of these propellants may enable projects to take a Design for Minimum Risk (DFMR) approach to address some propulsion system safety concerns, but only with the support of associated range and payload safety entities.\n\nImmature Component Ecosystem: While there are thrusters that are relatively mature (PMI E/F), incorporating them into integrated propulsion systems is challenging, and the maturity of stand-alone propulsion systems has lagged the pace of component development. Historically, research and development efforts, like Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) efforts, have focused on component development, and not the entire system. Efforts are now being made to focus on the development of system solutions. Most of these non-toxic propellants are still in some phase of development. Additionally, data on the propellants is widely restricted. Therefore, a comprehensive, public, peer-reviewed databased of compatible materials does not currently exist, and would-be system developers using these propellants may have difficultly accessing such data to guide their efforts.\n\nOther Considerations for Green Propellants: Other ‘green propellants’ such as Hydrogen Peroxide, High Test Peroxide (HTP), and HTP/Alcohol bipropellants also have their own unique handling considerations. For instance, HTP is a strong oxidizer and can exothermically decompose rapidly if improperly stored or handled. Hydrogen Peroxide, however, has been used as a rocket propellant for many decades, and there is a lot of information on safe handling, materials selection, and best practices. Electrolyzed water is another propellant option, wherein water is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen and combusted as a traditional bi-propellant thruster. However, generating and managing the power required to electrolyze the water in a compact spacecraft presents its own unique challenges. Yet it does provide a safe-to-launch system with very benign constituents.\n\nCurrent & Planned Missions\n\nECAPS offers a range of High Performance Green Propulsion (HPGP) thrusters, including the LMP-103S (figure 4.3), at 100-mN, 1-N, 5-N, and 22-N thrust levels. The 1-N HPGP thrusters were first demonstrated on orbit in the Prototype Research Instruments and Space Mission technology Advancement (PRISMA) mission completed in June 2011. PRISMA consisted of two small satellites, each carrying hydrazine and HPGP systems to show off a side-by-side comparison of their performance (26).\n\nECAPS developed an LMP-103S based propulsion system for a constellation of Earth observing satellites, called SkySat. SkySat has a propulsion system that uses four 1-N HPGP thrusters. Thirteen SkySat satellites with the ECAPS propulsion system have been launched and are fully operational (27).\n\nECAPS LMP-103S propulsion system is also used on the Autoscale demonstration of rendezvous technologies called ELSA-d, which launched in March 2021. ELSA-d has eight 1-N ECAPS HPGP thrusters to provide re-orbiting and de-orbiting capability. A system issue impacted three of eight ECAPS thrusters and an unresolved root cause resulted in the loss of a fourth thruster. Nevertheless, many mission goals were successfully accomplished, improving the providers readiness for offering a commercial deorbit service (28).\n\nVACCO provided a hybrid Micro Propulsion System (MiPS) for the ArgoMoon 6U CubeSat built for the Italian Space Agency. The ArgoMoon MiPS, figure 4.4, has an ECAPS 100mN LMP-103S thruster with four VACCO 25 mN R134a cold gas thrusters. ArgoMoon was successfully deployed in the Artemis I mission in November 2022 (29) (30) (31).\n\nAerojet-Rocketdyne built the ASCENT-based propulsion system for the NASA Green Propellant Infusion Mission (GPIM). GPIM was an on-orbit demonstration of the ASCENT (then called AF-M315E) propulsion system, using five 1-N thrusters (figure 4.5) for small attitude control maneuvers (32). GPIM was integrated on a small spacecraft bus (Ball Aerospace’s BCP-100) and launched in June 2019 as a secondary payload on a Falcon Heavy. The five thrusters were successfully fired in space, across a range of operating modes, testing their ability to control the satellite’s attitude, and demonstrating their effectiveness at changing its orbital inclination (33).\n\nAn ASCENT propulsion system, the Lunar Flashlight Propulsion System (LFPS) was developed for the JPL Lunar Flashlight mission (34). Lunar Flashlight (figure 4.6) was launched as a secondary payload in a December 2022 Falcon 9 launch, to map the lunar south pole for volatiles. LFPS was a pump-fed monopropellant system, using four 0.1-N ASCENT thrusters (figure 4.7) built by Rubicon Space Systems (a division of Plasma Processes) and a micro-pump built by Flight Works Inc. The propellant management system was fabricated using additive manufacturing. During the first few days of flight, it was found that 3 of the 4 thrusters were underperforming. Based on ground testing it was thought the underperformance might have been caused by obstructions in the fuel lines that limited propellant flow to the thrusters. Improvements were seen by increasing fuel pump pressure to clear the suspected obstructions. However, the effort was not sufficient to keep the spacecraft in the vicinity of the Moon and the mission was terminated in May 2023 (35).\n\nBenchmark Space Systems offers thrusters that can be used with High Test Peroxide (HTP) as a monopropellant or as an oxidizer in a bipropellant combination with a fuel. Benchmark provided a bipropellant Halcyon Avant propulsion system that uses four 22-N thrusters using HTP and isopropyl alcohol for the Sherpa-LTC2 orbital transfer vehicle (OTV) (36). The Sherpa-LTC2 was launched on a Falcon 9 in September 2022. The OTV was used to elevate the orbit of the Varuna Technology Demonstration Mission satellite (37). In June 2021, three monopropellant HTP Halcyon systems launched aboard the SpaceX Transporter 2 rideshare mission. One of the systems debuted Orbit Fab’s RAFTI refueling kit as part of their Tenzing mission. The other two missions supported an undisclosed mission partner (38).\n\nCisLunar Explorer, part of a NASA Centennial Challenges program will use a water electrolysis propulsion system developed by Cornell University’s Space Systems Design Studio on a pair of 3U CubeSat. In this system, the water is electrolyzed in the propellant tank. The gaseous hydrogen/gaseous oxygen mixture is flowed through a flame arrestor into the combustion chamber where it is ignited by a glow plug (39). The CubeSat was originally intended to be launched on Artemis I but difficulties during integration bumped it from the mission (40) (41).\n\nNASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology (SST) program at Ames Research Center (ARC) launched the first Pathfinder Technology Demonstration (PTD) mission in January 2021 (42)(43)(44). PTD-1 (figure 4.9) tested the HYDROS-C water electrolysis propulsion system, developed by Tethers Unlimited Inc. With a volume less than 2.4U, the HYDROS-C uses water as propellant. In-orbit, water was electrolyzed into oxygen and hydrogen, then combusted like a traditional bi-propellant thruster. Limited performance data has been evaluated and made public (45). The system requires 10 – 15 minutes of recharge time between pulses. A variant of the HYDROS-C system is the HYDROS-M system, which is intended to be sized for MicroSats. Tethers Unlimited became a subsidiary of ARKA Group LP in 2020.\n\nNanoAvionics developed an ADN-based monopropellant propulsion system under the Enabling Propulsion System for Small Satellites (EPSS) program. The EPSS monopropellant system was demonstrated on LituanicaSAT-2, a 3U CubeSat, to correct orientation and attitude, avoid collisions, and extend orbital lifetime. LituanicaSAT-2 was launched in June 2017 and successfully separated from the primary payload (Cartosat-2) as part of the European QB50 initiative. According to product literature, multiple missions have since launched, with the latest being in April 2019 (46) (47).\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nSee table 4-3 for the current state-of-the-art in other mono- and bipropellant devices applicable to small spacecraft.\n\nNotable Advances\n\nAerojet Rocketdyne continues to develop its GR-M1 Advanced Green Monopropellant CubeSat Thruster. It employs the same advanced techniques, ultra-high-temperature catalyst, and refractory metal manufacture as the GPIM GR-1 thruster, but on a nanosat scale (48). To partially mitigate thermal management challenges exacerbated at the miniature scale, the GR-M1 is designed to operate on a reduced-flame-temperature variant of the ASCENT propellant containing 10% added water. The heat transfer to surrounding spacecraft structure both during heat up and operation are comparable to conventional hydrazine thrusters.\n\nRubicon Space Systems (a division of Plasma Processes) is maturing 1N and 5N ASCENT thrusters (49), intended for SmallSat applications. Both offerings are built using the same materials and processes as those used on the 0.1-N thrusters delivered for the Lunar Flashlight Mission. Additionally, Rubicon Space Systems intends to engineer a short-life, lower cost version of the 5N thruster. The prototype thruster accumulated > 1-kg throughput and over 500 seconds before the end of the NASA Phase I SBIR. The Phase II effort will continue to develop the 5N thruster.\n\nCU Aerospace LLC (CUA) has developed the Monopropellant Propulsion Unit for CubeSats (MPUC) system, figure 4.10 (50). The monopropellant is an H2O2-ethanol blend denoted as CMP-X. Tests on a thrust stand with a bladder-fed propellant tank have demonstrated continuous constant thrust for >50 minutes at a thrust level of 250 mN at ISP of 179 s with an average input power of ~6 W during catalyst warmup. 1.5U and 2U system designs have an estimated 1400 N-s and 2120 N-s total impulse, respectively. A ~900°C flame temperature allows the thrust chamber to use non-refractory construction materials. CMP-X has low toxicity and was subjected to UN Series 1, 2, 3, and 6 testing; CMP-X demonstrated no detonation propagation when confined under a charge of high explosive, it exhibited thermal stability with no explosion or detonation during bonfire testing, and was not sensitive to drop impact or friction. CMP-X passed the criteria for either a 1.4S or a “Not Class 1” determination and may be excluded from the explosive class. Long-term storage testing shows no degradation over > 1200 days with testing ongoing. This flight-like, additively-manufactured, thruster passed environmental (vibration and thermal vacuum) testing and post-environmental thrust data were within experimental error of the pre-environmental data (51).\n\nDawn Aerospace has developed the CubeDrive bipropellant (nitrous oxide and propylene) system that consists of a single B1 thruster, propellant tank, valves, and electronics. The thruster can also be operated in cold gas mode (for smaller impulse bits) by not engaging the spark igniter. The 0.8U (figure 4.11) to 4U configurations provide 425 to 3,500 N-s of total impulse, respectively (52).\n\nVACCO has integrated four ECAPS 1-N LMP-103S thrusters into their Integrated Propulsion System (IPS) (figure 4.12), a bolt-on propulsion module for delta-V and attitude control applications (53) (54).\n\nHybrids\n\nTechnology Description\n\nHybrid propulsion is a mix of both solid and liquid/gas forms of propulsion. In a hybrid rocket, the fuel is typically a solid grain, and the oxidizer (often gaseous oxygen) is stored separately. The rocket is then ignited by injecting the oxidizer into the solid motor and igniting it with a spark or torch system. Since combustion can only occur while the oxidizer is flowing, these systems can readily be started or shut down by controlling the oxidizer flow.\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nImproved Safety and Handling: Hybrid systems are inherently safer to handle than solid motor systems because there is no oxidizer pre-mixed into the solid motor, which reduces the risk of pre-mature ignition.\n\nIntegrates Attributes of Solids and Liquids: Hybrids achieve many positive attributes of both solid motors (storability & handling) and liquid engines (restart & throttling).\n\nCombustion Efficiency: Combustion efficiency tends to be lower than either solid motors or liquid engines.\n\nOther Drawbacks: Regression rate control and fuel residuals tend to be more problematic in hybrid designs.\n\nCurrent & Planned Missions\n\nAn arc-ignition ’green’ CubeSat hybrid thruster system prototype was developed at Utah State University and demonstrated in flight under the Undergraduate Student Instrument Project (USIP). The hybrid rocket design used a 3D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic as the fuel and high-pressure gaseous oxygen (GOX) as the oxidizer. For safety considerations the oxidizer was diluted to 60% nitrogen and 40% oxygen for the demonstration. On March 25, 2018, the system was successfully tested aboard a sounding rocket launched from NASA Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) into space and the motor was successfully re-fired 5 times. During the tests, 8 N of thrust and a specific impulse of 215 s were achieved as predicted (55) (56). The Space Dynamics Lab has miniaturized this technology to be better suited for CubeSat applications (0.25 – 0.5 N). A qualification unit is currently in development for the miniaturized system.\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nSee table 4-4 for current state-of-the-art hybrid devices applicable to small spacecraft.\n\nNotable Advances\n\nUtah State University has an ongoing test series with Nytrox, a blend of nitrous oxide and oxygen, and ABS. This testing is focused on a 25-50 N system for a 12U sized vehicle. Investigating different nozzle materials for low erosion in long duration burns is a key concern (57) (58).\n\nJPL is developing a hybrid propulsion system for a 12U CubeSat and a 100 kg SmallSat. Testing included regression rate characterization of clear and black Poly (Methyl MethAcrylate) fuels with GOX to be included in propulsion system sizing. Later vacuum testing included an improvement of the ignition system to a laser operated system that eliminates the need for a separate ignition fuel gas (59) (60) (61) (62).\n\nNASA ARC developed a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and nitrous oxide hybrid system that had ethylene and nitrous oxide thrusters. The ethylene and nitrous oxide also function as the hybrid ignition source. The hybrid system had a demonstrated efficiency of 91% and calculated ISP of 247 sec, making it competitive with current small satellite propulsion systems (63) (64).\n\nAerospace Corporation and Penn State University developed an “Advanced Hybrid Rocket Motor Propulsion Unit for CubeSats (PUC)”. The design used additive manufacturing techniques for the carbon filled polyamide structure including the nitrous oxide tank and a paraffin grain within an acrylic shell, with acrylic diaphragms 3-D printed in-situ in the grain for enhanced performance. This design fits in a 1U space, for a 3 to 6U spacecraft (65).\n\nParabilis Space Technologies has developed two small satellite propulsion systems. Rapid Orbital Mobility Bus (ROMBUS) is a hybrid rocket-based system with nitrous oxide as the oxidizer and the attitude control system/reaction control system thruster propellant. It provides high-impulse thrust for satellite translational maneuvers which can be used for initial orbit insertion, rapid orbit rephasing, threat/collision avoidance, and targeted re-entry at the satellite’s mission end of life (66).Nano Orbital Transfer System (OTS) is a Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and nitrous oxide (N2O) hybrid system, with N2O based ACS thrusters. Nano OTS leverages Parabilis’ proven hybrid engine and small satellite technologies for low-cost, high-performance maneuvers using non-toxic green propellants. The OTS has a modular design, enabling rapid and low-cost configuration of stages to accommodate 3U size NanoSats up to >50 kg MicroSat-size vehicles (67).\n\nCold Gas\n\nTechnology Description\n\nCold gas propulsion systems are simple, mature, and safe, although they provide relatively limited total impulse. There is no combustion in cold gas systems, with thrust produced by the expulsion of a gaseous propellant through a diverging nozzle. Propellants can be stored as compressed gases, saturated liquids, or solids. Gaseous nitrogen is a commonly used propellant for cold gas systems, although many other gases have been used in the long history of cold gas propulsion. For gases the tradeoff is between performance and storage; lower molecular weight gases offer higher specific impulse but require more voluminous storage. Saturated liquids are stored at low pressure and vaporized when flowed into a low-pressure chamber. The dense storage of saturated liquids and their property of self-pressurization has made them popular as a propellant for CubeSat missions. The liquid propellants may require a pressurant or are self-pressurized, if stored in a two-phase liquid-gas state. Solid propellants can be used in a cold gas system by subliming the solid propellant with adequate heat.\n\nA derivative of cold gas systems is electrothermal or ‘warm gas’ systems, in which the propellant is somewhat heated without chemical reaction and accelerated through a nozzle. The additional heating results in a modest improvement in thrust and specific impulse compared to a pure cold gas system, but typically burdens the spacecraft with increased power consumption. Electrothermal systems are described in more detail in the Electric Propulsion section.\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nLow Cost and Complexity: Cold gas thrusters are often attractive and suitable for small buses due to their relatively low cost and complexity.\n\nSafe: Most cold gas thrusters use inert, non-toxic propellants, which are an advantage for secondary payloads that must adopt “do no harm” approaches to primary payloads.\n\nSmall Impulse Bit: Cold gas systems are often well suited to provide attitude control since they can provide very small minimum impulse bits for precise maneuvering.\n\nSmall Total Impulse: The low specific impulse of these systems limits them from providing large orbital correction maneuvers.\n\nIntegrated Systems Optimized for CubeSats: Designs optimized around a CubeSat’s limited resources have improved the capability of these systems for nanosatellite buses.\n\nMissions\n\nThe Micro-Electromechanical-based PICOSAT Satellite Inspector, or MEPSI, built by the Aerospace Corporation flew aboard STS-113 in 2002 and STS-116 in 2006. The spacecraft included both target and imaging/inspector vehicles connected via a tether. The two vehicles were each 4 x 4 x 5 in3 in volume and had five cold-gas thrusters, producing approximately 20 mN. The MEPSI propulsion system was produced using stereo-lithography. It was suited as a propulsion research unit for PicoSats (68).\n\nMarotta developed a cold gas micro-thruster, CGMT-000-9, for fine attitude adjustment maneuvers that flew on the NASA ST-5 mission in 2006. The thruster operated in blowdown mode with gaseous nitrogen, starting at 2.4 N and ending at 0.05 N (69) (70).\n\nIn June 2014, Space Flight Laboratory at University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Research (UTIAS) launched two 15 kg small spacecraft (CanX-4 and CanX-5) to demonstrate formation flying. The Canadian Nanosatellite Advanced Propulsion System (CNAPS), shown in figure 4.13, consisted of four thrusters fueled with liquid sulfur hexafluoride. This propulsion module is a novel version of the previous NanoPS that flew on the CanX-2 mission in 2008. The non-toxic sulfur hexafluoride propellant was selected because it has a high vapor pressure and density, which are important properties for making a compact self-pressurizing system. The propulsion system was successfully used for drift recovery and autonomously maintaining a formation from 1-km range down to 50-m separation (71) (72) (73) (74).\n\nMicrospace Rapid Pte Ltd of Singapore developed a cold gas propulsion system for the POPSAT-HIP1 CubeSat demonstration mission that launched June 2014. It consists of eight micro-nozzles that provide control for three rotational axes with a single thrust axis for translational applications. The total delta-v was estimated from laboratory data to between 2.25 and 3.05 ms-1. Each thruster has 1 mN of nominal thrust using argon propellant. An electromagnetic microvalve with a very short opening time of 1 m-s operates each thruster (75).\n\nGomSpace (acquired NanoSpace in 2016) has developed two related propulsion systems called the NanoProp CGP3 and NanoProp 6U. Both use proportional thrust control of four nozzles to control spacecraft attitude and provide delta-v. The CGP3 was flown on the TW-1 3U CubeSat launched in 2015. The 6U configuration was flown on GOMX-4B in 2018 as a formation flight demonstration (76) (77) (78) (79).\n\nAn ACS cold gas propulsion system using R-236fa was produced and tested by Lightsey Space Research for the NASA ARC BioSentinel mission, a 6U CubeSat that launched on Artemis I in November 2022. The propulsion system enables detumbling and pointing for communication back to Earth. The propulsion system uses a 3D-printed propellant tank to reduce part count and make efficient use of the available volume. The system contains six RCS thrusters and one delta-v thruster. The delta-v thruster was included to allow for collision avoidance but was ultimately not needed. One of the RCS thruster valves failed closed during RCS checkout. Rather than further attempting to actuate the valve, and risk the valve failing open, a workaround was identified to perform momentum unloading with the remaining five RCS thrusters. As of May 2023, the propulsion system has accumulated 408 firings and continues to operate as expected. The initial phase of the mission was completed in April 2023. NASA has extended the mission by up to an additional 18 months, or as late as November 2024 (80) (81) (82) (83).\n\nThe ThrustMe I2T5 subliming iodine cold gas module, figure 4.14, was the first iodine propulsion system to be spaceflight tested, flown on the Xiaoxiang 1-08 satellite in 2019 (84) (85). Since then, the system was also launched on RTAF’s NAPA-2 in June 2021 and on Spire’s L3C in January 2023. Additional I2T5 are anticipated to launch on the Robusta-3A satellite, developed by CSUM, which will carry various scientific payloads related to meteorology and technology demonstration (86) (87).\n\nThe CubeSat Proximity Operations Demonstration (CPOD) is a mission led by Terra Orbital (88) to demonstrate autonomous on-orbit rendezvous and proximity operations using two identical 3U CubeSats. Each spacecraft incorporates a cold gas propulsion system built by VACCO Industries that provides up to 186 N-s of total impulse. This module uses the self-pressurizing refrigerant R236fa propellant, which is exhausted through a total of eight thrusters distributed in pairs at the four corners of the module. CPOD launched in May 2022 as part of SpaceX’s Transporter-5 mission. The CPOD mission demonstrated rendezvous of the CubeSats with intersatellite distances closing from 997 km to a minimum of 0.36 km. On-orbit limitations on experimentation were attributed to multiple factors as the launch date slipped due to many years of delay, including obsolete hardware, partial failure in the solar panels, and a propulsion system anomaly suspected to be a plenum leak (89) (90).\n\nThe Mars Cube One (MarCO) technology demonstration mission consisted of two identical CubeSats that followed the InSight spacecraft to Mars in loose formation in 2018. The MarCO spacecraft performed five trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) during the mission to Mars. The TCMs were conducted using an R236fa cold gas propulsion system developed by VACCO Industries, which contains four thrusters for attitude control and another four for the TCMs. MarCO-B developed a propulsion system leak which required constant maintenance. A tank to plenum leak was identified prior to launch, which the mission accepted. However, a second leak through a MarCO-B thruster valve developed during flight. The combination of both leaks resulted in a continuous moment on the MarCO-B spacecraft. The MarCO spacecraft succeeded in their mission to relay telemetry from the InSight lander during its descent to Mars (91) (92) (93) (94).\n\nNear-Earth Asteroid Scout (NEA Scout) was a joint MSFC and JPL mission that had a VACCO cold gas MiPS (R236FA propellant), with six 25-mN thrusters, to assist the main propulsion system, a solar sail. However, after deployment from Artemis I in November 2022, the project team was not able to communicate with the spacecraft (95) (96) (97).\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nSee table 4-5 for the current state-of-the-art cold gas devices applicable to small spacecraft.\n\nSolid Motors\n\nTechnology Description\n\nSolid rocket motors have an oxidizer and fuel mechanical mixture stored in solid form (propellant grain). For small satellites, solid rocket motors may be used for impulsive maneuvers such as orbit insertion or quick de-orbiting. They achieve moderate specific impulses and high thrust magnitudes. There are some electrically controlled solid thrusters that operate in the milli-newton (mN) range that are restartable and have steering capabilities. Solid rocket arrays can be compact and suitable for small buses. Composed of several miniature solid rockets, individual units can be fired, alone or together, as needed.\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nThrust Vector Control: Thrust vector control systems can be coupled with existing solid rocket motors to provide controllable high delta-v maneuvering.\n\nUsually Single-Burn: In general, solid motors are considered a single-burn event system. To achieve multiple burns, the system must be either electrically restartable (aka electric solid propellants), or several small units must be matrixed into an array configuration. Because electrically controlled solid propellant (ESPs) are electrically ignited, they are considered safer than traditional solid energetic propellants.\n\nCurrent & Planned Missions\n\nNorthrop Grumman offers the STAR 3 motor which has a maximum thrust of 2050 N. The STAR 3 motor was used as the Transverse Impulse Rocket System for the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) program, and was used in 2004 to reduce the lateral velocity of the MER Spirit Lander. The STAR 4G motor was developed and tested by NASA GSFC as an orbit adjust motor for deploying nanosatellite constellations but was not flown, although it is still offered by Northrop Grumman along wth other, higher total impulse motors in the STAR line (98).\n\nThe Pacific Scientific Energetic Materials Company (PacSci EMC) Modular Architecture Propulsion System (MAPS) array (figure 4.15) has a 10-plus year in-orbit lifespan. The MAPS system provides three axes capability to control attitude control, deorbit, drag makeup, and plane and attitude changes with a delta-v greater than 50 m s-1. The capability of MAPS “plug-and-play” bolt-on design and clean-burning propellant array is scalable and can be custom fit for a range of interfaces. MAPS was flown in 2017 aboard PacSciSat, which successfully completed all mission objectives (99) (100).\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nSee table 4-6 for the current state-of-the-art solid motor devices applicable to small spacecraft.\n\nPropellant Management Devices\n\nTechnology Description\n\nWhile not directly a thrust producing device, propellant management devices (PMDs) are frequently used in liquid propulsion systems to reliably deliver propellant to thruster units. PMDs are commonly a critical part of in-space liquid propulsion systems that do not use bellows or membrane type tanks. As small spacecraft look toward more complex propulsion system requirements, PMDs will undoubtedly play an integral role. Historically, small spacecraft have used bellows or membrane tanks to ensure propellant delivery and expulsion. However, there is the potential to incorporate PMD structures into additively manufactured tanks and propulsion systems, permitting more conformal structures to be created and optimized for small spacecraft missions. As such, PMDs are briefly covered here for awareness. A more detailed treatment and explanation can be found in literature. A comprehensive, up-to-date list of the types of PMDs, as well as missions employing PMDs, is available in Hartwig (101).\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nThe purpose of PMDs is to separate liquid and vapor phases within the propellant storage tank upstream of the thruster, and to transfer vapor-free propellant in any gravitational or thermal environment. PMDs have flight heritage with all classical storage systems, have been flown once with LMP-103S, have no flight heritage with cryogenic propellants, and have been implemented in electric propulsion systems. Multiple PMDs are often required to meet the demands of a particular mission, whether using storable or cryogenic propellants.\n\nCurrent & Planned Missions\n\nThe Lunar Flashlight Propulsion System used a PMD sponge and ribbon vane. The sponge was additively manufactured, while the ribbon vane was cut from sheet metal and bent to conform to the required dimensions. Surface tension properties, a necessary parameter for PMD sizing, were determined for the ASCENT propellant by Kent State University, funded and managed by NASA. The design and modelling was a joint effort between MSFC and GRC.\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nNo summary table is included for propellant management devices in this report edition.\n\nNotable Advances\n\nNorthrop Grumman has made advances in the development of SmallSat and CubeSat scale diaphragm propellant tanks using materials that are compatible with hydrazine and some green monopropellant fuels (102), and demonstrated the utility of additive manufacturing in producing tank shells.\n\n4.6.2 In-Space Electric Propulsion\n\nIn-space electric propulsion (EP) is any in-space propulsion technology wherein a propellant is accelerated through the conversion of electrical energy into kinetic energy. The electrical energy source powering in-space EP is historically solar, therefore these technologies are often referred to as solar electric propulsion (SEP), although other energy sources such as nuclear reactors or beamed energy are conceivable. The energy conversion occurs by one of three mechanisms: electrothermal, electrostatic, or electromagnetic acceleration (133) (134). Each of these technologies are covered herein.\n\nThis survey of the state-of-the-art in EP does not attempt to review all known devices but focuses on those devices that can be commercially procured or devices that appear on a path toward commercial availability. The intent is to aid mission design groups and other in-space propulsion end-users by improving their awareness of the full breadth of potentially procurable EP devices that may meet their mission requirements.\n\nInstead of detailing the complete operating range for each propulsion device, the authors decided to provide only the metrics associated with the nominal operating condition to improve comprehension of the data and make initial device comparisons more straightforward. When a manufacturer does not specifically state a nominal operating condition in literature, the manufacturer may have been contacted to determine a preferred nominal operating condition, otherwise a nominal operating condition was assumed based on similarity to other devices. For those metrics not specifically found in published literature, approximations have been made when calculable from the available data. Readers are strongly encouraged to follow the references cited to the literature describing each device’s full performance range and capabilities.\n\nElectrothermal\n\nTechnology Description\n\nElectrothermal technologies use electrical energy to increase the enthalpy of a propellant, whereas chemical technologies rely on exothermal chemical reactions. Once heated, the propellant is accelerated and expelled through a conventional converging-diverging nozzle to convert the acquired energy into kinetic energy, like chemical propulsion systems. The specific impulse achieved with electrothermal devices is typically of similar magnitude as chemical devices given that both electrothermal and chemical devices are fundamentally limited by the working temperature limits of materials. However, electrothermal technologies can achieve somewhat higher specific impulses than chemical systems since they are not subject to the limits of chemical energy storage.\n\nElectrothermal devices are typically subclassified within one of the following three categories.\n\nResistojet devices employ an electrical heater to raise the temperature of a surface that in turn increases the temperature of a gaseous propellant.\n\nArcjet devices sustain an electrical arc through an ionized gaseous propellant, resulting in ohmic heating.\n\nElectrodeless thrusters heat a gaseous propellant through an inductively or capacitively coupled discharge or by radiation.\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nPropellant Selection: Electrothermal technologies offer some of the most lenient restrictions on propellant selection for in-space propulsion. Whereas chemical systems require propellants with both the right chemical and physical properties to achieve the desired performance, electrothermal systems primarily depend on acceptable physical properties. For example, electrothermal devices can often employ inert gases or even waste products such as water and carbon dioxide. They also allow use of novel propellants such as high storage density refrigerants or in-situ resources. That said, not all propellants can be electrothermally heated without negative consequences. Thermal decomposition of complex molecules may result in the formation of polymers and other inconvenient byproducts. These byproducts may result in clogging of the propulsion system and/or spacecraft contamination.\n\nPropellant Storage: Electrothermal devices may require that propellants be maintained at a high plenum pressure to operate efficiently. This may require a high-pressure propellant storage and delivery system.\n\nHigh Temperature Materials: The working temperature limit of propellant wetted surfaces in the thruster head is a key limitation on the performance of electrothermal devices. As such, very high temperature materials, such as tungsten and molybdenum alloys, are often employed to maximize performance. The total mass and shape of these high temperature materials are a safety consideration during spacecraft disposal. While most spacecraft materials burnup on re-entry, the re-entry behavior of devices using these high temperature materials will be scrutinized when assessing the danger of debris to life and property.\n\nPower Processing: While some simple resistojet devices may operate directly from spacecraft bus power, other electrothermal devices may require a relatively complex power processing unit (PPU). For example, a radio-frequency electrodeless thruster requires circuitry to convert the direct current bus power to a high-frequency alternating current. In some cases, the cost and integration challenges of the PPU can greatly exceed those of the thruster.\n\nThermal Soak-back: Given the high operating temperatures of electrothermal devices, any reliance on the spacecraft for thermal management of the thruster head should be assessed. While the ideal propulsion system would apply no thermal load on the spacecraft, some thermal soak-back to the spacecraft is inevitable, whether through the mounting structure, propellant lines, cable harness, or radiation.\n\nMissions\n\nThe Bradford (formerly Deep Space Industries) Comet water-based electrothermal propulsion system (figure 4.16) has been implemented by multiple customers operating in low-Earth orbit, including HawkEye 360, Capella Space, and BlackSky Global (135). All missions use the same Comet thruster head, while the BlackSky Global satellites use a larger tank to provide a greater total impulse capability. The HawkEye 360 Pathfinder mission is a constellation of three small microsatellites built by Space Flight Laboratory (SFL) based on its 15-kg NEMO platform; each spacecraft measures 20 x 20 x 44 cm3 with a mass of 13.4 kg (136) (137). The Comet provides each HawkEye 360 pathfinder a total delta-v capability of 96 ms-1. The approximate dimensions of the BlackSky Global spacecraft are 55 x 67 x 86 cm3 with a mass of 56 kg (139).\n\nThe Propulsion Unit for CubeSats (PUC) system (140), figure 4.17, was designed and fabricated by CU Aerospace LLC (Champaign, IL) and VACCO Industries under contract with the U.S. Air Force to supply two government missions (141). The system was acquired for drag makeup capability to extend asset lifetime in low-Earth orbit. The system uses SO2 as a self-pressurizing liquid propellant. The propulsion system electrothermally heats the propellant using a micro-cavity discharge (MCD) and expels the propellant through a single nozzle (142). It can alternatively use R134a or R236fa propellants, but only in a cold-gas mode with reduced performance. Eight (8) flight units were delivered to the Air Force in 2014, although it remains unknown if any of the units have flown.\n\nIn 2019, CU Aerospace was selected for a NASA STMD Tipping Point award to design, fabricate, integrate, and perform mission operations for the Dual Propulsion Experiment (DUPLEX) 6U CubeSat. DUPLEX has two of CU Aerospace’s micro-propulsion systems onboard, one Monofilament Vaporization Propulsion (MVP) system (143) (144) (145), figure 4.18, and one Fiber-Fed Pulsed Plasma Thruster (FPPT) system (149) (150) (151) (152) (153), figure 4.43. The MVP is an electrothermal device that vaporizes and heats an inert solid polymer propellant fiber to 725 K. The coiled solid filament approach for propellant storage and delivery addresses common propellant safety concerns, which often limit the application of propulsion on low-cost CubeSats. In-orbit operations will demonstrate multiple mission capabilities including inclination change, orbit raising and lowering, drag makeup, and deorbit burns. Launch is manifested in early-2024 (155).\n\nAuroraSat-1 is a technology demonstration 1.5U CubeSat that is demonstrating multiple propulsion devices by Aurora Propulsion Technologies. AuroraSat-1 carries Aurora’s smallest version of Aurora Resistojet Module for Attitude control (ARM-A) (156), figure 4.19, and a demonstration unit of their Plasma Brake Module (PBM) (157). The ARM-A system integrated into AuroraSat-1 has six resistojet thrusters for full 3-axis attitude control and 70 grams of water propellant, providing a total impulse of 70 N-s. AuroraSat-1 is built by SatRevolution with Aurora providing the payloads. The satellite was launched by Rocket Lab in May 2022. (158) (159). See section 4.6.3 for discussion of the PBM module.\n\nThe OPTIMAL-1 technology demonstration 3U nanosatellite by ArkEdge Space Inc. launched in late 2022 and was deployed from the International Space Station in early 2023. Among other technology demonstration devices, OPTIMAL-1 contains a Pale Blue water resistojet thruster (160).\n\nSPHERE-1 EYE, a 6U CubeSat developed by Sony Group Corporation, includes a Pale Blue Water Resistojet Thruster. The satellite was launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 on January 3rd, 2023, and has been orbiting Earth with an altitude between 500 km to 600 km. The water propulsion system is expected to prolong the satellite’s life by 2.5 years. The propulsion system operated for approximately 2 minutes on March 3rd, 2023, and the company confirmed the successful generation of thrust from the obtained flight telemetry (161).\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nSee table 4-7 for current state-of-the-art electrothermal devices applicable to small spacecraft.\n\nElectrosprays\n\nTechnology Description\n\nElectrospray propulsion systems generate thrust by electrostatically extracting and accelerating ions or droplets from a low-vapor-pressure, electrically conductive, liquid propellant (figure 4.20). This technology can be generally classified into the following types according to the propellant used:\n\nIonic-Liquid Electrosprays: These technologies use ionic liquids (i.e., salts in a liquid phase at room conditions) as the propellant. The propellant is stored as a liquid, and onboard heaters may be present to maintain propellant properties within the desired operational temperature range. Commonly used propellants include 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI-BF4) and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI-Im). Thrusters that principally emit droplets are also referred to as colloid thrusters.\n\nField Emission Electric Propulsion (FEEP): These technologies use low-melting-point metals as the propellant. The propellant is typically stored as a solid, and onboard heaters are used to liquefy the propellant prior to thruster operations. Common propellants include indium and gallium.\n\nFeed systems for electrospray technologies can be actively fed via pressurant gas or passively fed via capillary forces. The ion (high-ISP) or droplet (moderate-ISP) emission can be controlled by modulation of the high-voltage (i.e., >1 kV) input in a closed-loop feedback system with current measurements. Stable operations in either emission mode can provide very precise impulse bits.\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nCharge Balance: Ionic liquid propellants can support electrospray operations with just cation (i.e., positively charged) emission or bi-polar emission (i.e., both anions and cations). For cation-only emission, as with FEEP thrusters, a separate cathode neutralizer is needed to maintain overall charge balance; such neutralizers do not necessarily need to be tightly integrated with the thruster heads, with resultant mass, volume, and power impacts that must be understood for spacecraft integration. For electrospray technologies using bi-polar emission, reliable high-voltage switching in the power electronics becomes a critical consideration.\n\nPlume Contamination: Because propellants for electrospray propulsion systems are electrically conductive and condensable as liquids or solids, impingement of the thruster plume on spacecraft surfaces may lead to electrical shorting and surface contamination of solar panels and sensitive spacecraft components. Consideration of only the primary beam plume may not be sufficient, as droplet emission and molecular fragmentation within the plume can generate off-axis species. Plume shields are frequently employed on spacecraft to protect sensitive surfaces in the absence of high-fidelity electrospray plume models or characterization data.\n\nPropellant Handling and Thruster Contamination: Ionic liquids and metallic propellants can be sensitive to humidity and oxidation, so care is needed if extended storage is required prior to flight. Electrospray technologies can also be sensitive to contamination of the thruster head during propellant loading, ground testing (e.g., backsputter or outgassed materials from the test facility), and handling (i.e., foreign object debris). Precautions should be taken to minimize contamination risks from manufacturing, through test, and to launch. Post-launch, ionic liquids can outgas (e.g., water vapor) when exposed to the space environment, and such behavior should be accounted for in the mission operations. Due to environmental factors such as spacecraft outgassing and atomic oxygen levels, thruster operations following spacecraft deployment may need a conditioning or burn-in period before achieving full propulsive performance.\n\nPerformance Stability and Lifetime: As an electrospray propulsion system operates over time, the propulsive performance can degrade as the plume impinges upon and deposits condensable propellant on thruster head surfaces; in time, sufficiently deposited propellant buildup can electrically short out the thruster electrodes and terminate thruster operation. Especially for missions with large total impulse requirements, lifetime testing or validated life models of the electrospray propulsion system in a relevant environment is important for understanding end-of-life behavior.\n\nSpecific Impulse: Even for electrosprays that principally emit ions, operational thruster modes and instabilities can result in droplet emission that degrade the specific impulse and thrust efficiency. Caution is advised when considering claimed specific impulse or other propulsive properties (e.g., thrust vector and beam divergence) derived from plume characteristics; verification test data in a relevant environment is important for properly assessing these claims.\n\nPrecision Thrust: Electrospray devices have the potential to provide very precise thrust during continuous operations. For devices that can operate in pulsed mode via pulsed modulation of the high-voltage input, fine impulse bits (i.e., <10 μN-s) may be achievable. Such operations can permit precise control over spacecraft attitude and maneuvering. Verification test data in a relevant environment should be used to properly assess the degree of thrust precision.\n\nMissions\n\nThe ESA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Pathfinder spacecraft was launched in December 2015 on Vega flight VV06. Onboard were two integrated propulsion modules associated with the NASA Space Technology 7 Disturbance Reduction System (ST7 DRS). Each propulsion module contained four independent Busek Colloid MicroNewton Thrusters (CMNT), propellant-less cathode neutralizers, power processing units, digital control electronics, and low-pressure propellant tanks. The propulsion system was successfully commissioned in-orbit in January 2016 after having been fully fueled and stored for almost eight years. The electrospray modules (figure 4.21) were operated at the Earth-Sun Lagrange Point 1 for 90 days to counteract solar disturbance forces on the spacecraft; seven of the eight thrusters demonstrated performance consistent with ground test results, and the full propulsion system met mission-level performance requirements (163).\n\nThe Enpulsion Nano FEEP (figure 4.22), formerly the IFM Nano, was first integrated onboard a 3U Planet Labs Flock 3P CubeSat and launched via PSLV-C40 in January 2018. The indium-propellant propulsion system (with integrated thruster head, propellant storage, and power processing unit) was demonstrated in a 491-km by 510-km orbit. Two thruster firing sequences were reported, with the first a 15-minute firing in non-eclipse and the second a 30-minute firing in eclipse. Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry data onboard the spacecraft indicated good agreement with the ~220 µN commanded thrust (164). Since this initial demonstration, the Enpulsion Nano has flown onboard other spacecraft, but limited on-orbit data is publicly available. These missions include the ICEYE-X2 (launched onboard Falcon-9 flight F9-64 in December 2018) to provide low-Earth orbit interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations (165) (166) and the DOD-funded Harbinger technology demonstrator (launched onboard Electron flight STP-27RD in May 2019) (167) (168). The Enpulsion Nano was also integrated onboard the Zentrum für Telematik (Würzburg) NetSat formation-flying demonstrator mission, which launched as a Soyuz-2 rideshare in September 2020 (169) (170). A summary of available on-orbit statistics, anomalies, and lessons learned for the Enpulsion Nano family (Nano, Nano R3, and Nano AR3) is available (171).\n\nAn Enpulsion Micro R3 (figure 4.23) was housed onboard the GMS-T mission, which launched in January 2021 onboard a Rocket Lab Electron. The telecommunications satellite uses an OHB Sweden Innosat platform with propulsive capability for collision avoidance. Inaugural on-orbit commissioning of the propulsion system was confirmed in March 2021 (173).\n\nThe University Würzburg Experimental Satellite 4 (UWE-4) was launched as a secondary payload onboard the Soyuz Kanopus-V 5 and 6 mission in December 2018. This 1U spacecraft housed two Morpheus Space NanoFEEP systems, with each system consisting of two gallium-propellant thrusters, a power processing unit board for the UNISEC Europe bus, and a propellant-less cathode neutralizer. An experiment using one thruster as an attitude control actuator was reported, with the increased spacecraft rotation rate corresponding to a derived thrust magnitude of ~5 µN; anomalous torque was attributed to unexpected impingement of the thruster plume upon the spacecraft antenna (174) (175). Orbit lowering capability was demonstrated in 2020; of the four individual thrusters, three experienced anomalous behavior during the UWE-4 mission (176). A 3U-Cubsat implementation of the same NanoFEEP technology is shown in figure 4.24.\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nSee table 4-8 for current state-of-the-art electrospray devices applicable to small spacecraft.\n\nGridded-Ion\n\nTechnology Description\n\nGridded-ion propulsion systems ionize gaseous propellant via a plasma discharge, and the resultant ions are subsequently accelerated via electrostatic grids (i.e., ion optics). This technology can be generally classified according to the type of plasma discharge employed:\n\nDirect-Current (DC) Discharge: The propellant is ionized via electron bombardment from an internal discharge cathode (figure 4.25).\n\nRadio-Frequency (RF) Discharge: No internal discharge cathode is present. Instead, the propellant is ionized via RF or microwave excitation from an RF generator (figure 4.26).\n\nGridded-ion thrusters typically operate at high voltages and include an external neutralizer cathode to maintain plume charge neutrality. High specific impulses can be achieved, but the thrust density is fundamentally limited by space-charge effects. While the earliest thruster technologies used metallic propellants (i.e., mercury and cesium), modern gridded-ion thrusters use noble gases (e.g., xenon, krypton) or iodine.\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nPerformance Prediction: Due to the enclosed region of ion generation and acceleration, gridded ion thrusters tend to be less sensitive to test-facility backpressure effects than other devices such as Hall thrusters. This allows for more reliable prediction of in-flight performance based on ground measurements. Furthermore, the separation between ion generation and acceleration mechanisms within the device tend to make calculations of thrust and ion velocity (or ISP) more straightforward.\n\nGrid Erosion: Charge-exchange ions formed in between and downstream of the ion optics can impinge upon and erode the grids. Over time, this erosion can lead to a variety of failure modes, including grid structural failure, an inability to prevent electrons from back streaming into the discharge chamber, or the generation of an inter-grid electrical short due to the deposition of electrically conductive grid material. Proper grid alignment must be maintained during thruster assembly, transport, launch, and operations to minimize grid erosion. Random vibration tests at the protoflight level should be conducted to verify the survivability of the ion optics against launch loads. Validated thermal modeling may be needed to assess the impact of grid thermal expansion during thruster operations.\n\nForeign Object Debris: The grids are separated by a small gap, typically less than 1 mm, to maximize the electric field and thrust capability of the device. As a result, gridded-ion thrusters tend to be sensitive to foreign object debris, which can bridge the inter-grid gap and cause electrical shorting. Precautions should be taken to minimize such contamination risks from manufacturing, through test, and to launch.\n\nCathode Lifetime: Cathodes for plasma discharge or plume neutralization may be sensitive to propellant purity and pre-launch environmental exposure. Feed system cleanliness, bake-out, and use of a high-purity propellant are key factors in maximizing cathode lifetime. The technology provider may recommend maximum cumulative atmospheric exposure and humidity to reduce risk.\n\nRoll Torque: Misalignments in the ion optics can lead to disturbances in the thrust vector, resulting in a torque around the roll axis that cannot be addressed by the mounting gimbal. For missions requiring extended thruster operations, a secondary propulsion system or reaction wheels may be needed to counter the torque buildup (177).\n\nElectromagnetic Interactions: For RF-discharge thrusters, electromagnetic interference and compatibility (EMI/EMC) testing may be critical to assess the impact of thruster operations on spacecraft communications and payload functionality.\n\nPower Electronics: Operation of gridded-ion thrusters requires multiple high-voltage power supplies for discharge operation (ion generation), ion acceleration, and neutralization, leading to potentially complex and expensive power electronics.\n\nIodine Propellant: To address the volume constraints of small spacecraft, iodine is an attractive propellant. Compared to xenon, iodine’s storage density is three times greater. Furthermore, iodine stores as a solid with a low vapor pressure, which addresses spacecraft integration concerns associated with high-pressure propellant storage. However, iodine is a strong oxidizer, and long-duration impact on the thruster and potential spacecraft interactions and the long-term reliability of feed system and thruster components exposed to iodine.\n\nMissions\n\nThe ESA Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) was launched in March 2009 onboard a Rokot / Briz-KM to provide detailed mapping of Earth’s gravitational field and ocean dynamics from an altitude of ~220-260 km. Two QinetiQ T5 DC-discharge gridded-ion thrusters (figure 4.27), with one serving as a redundant backup, successfully provided drag-free control of the 1000-kg satellite until xenon propellant exhaustion in October 2013 (178) (179) (180) (181).\n\nThrustMe’s NPT30-I2 1U or 1.5U (figure 4.28), an integrated, RF-discharge gridded-ion propulsion system, has at least two units in space as of July 2023. The Beihangkongshi-1 satellite was launched in November 2020 onboard a Long March 6 rocket. As part of the first on-orbit demonstration of iodine-propellant electric propulsion, two 90-minute burns provided an orbit altitude change of 700 m (182) as described in a Nature publication (183). In April 2023, the 1.5U flew onboard a Space Flight Laboratory of the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) 35-kg DEFIANT bus for the Norwegian Space Agency’s NorSat-TD mission (184), which included a demonstration of satellite collision avoidance maneuvers (185). With more than 100 systems ordered by clients (186) as of July 2023, upcoming launches include the NPT30-I2 onboard a GomSpace 12U CubeSat for the ESA GOMX-5 technology demonstration mission, NTU Singapore’s INSPIRESAT-4, and Turion Space’s DROID.002 (187).\n\nThe Lunar IceCube and LunarH-Map missions both included a Busek BIT-3 propulsion system (figure 4.29) with solid iodine propellant. The BIT-3 system was the primary propulsion for each spacecraft’s lunar transfer, orbit capture, orbit lowering, and spacecraft disposal. Each integrated BIT-3 system includes a low-pressure propellant tank with heated propellant-feed system components, a power processing unit to control the RF thruster and RF cathode, and a two-axis gimbal assembly.\n\nThe Lunar IceCube mission, led by Morehead State University, aimed to characterize the distribution of water and other volatiles on the Moon from a highly inclined lunar orbit with a perilune less than 100 km. The 6U spacecraft was launched as a secondary payload onboard Artemis I (188) (189). Communication issues with the CubeSat were reported shortly after launch (190).\n\nThe Lunar Polar Hydrogen Mapper (LunaH-Map) mission, led by Arizona State University, aimed to map hydrogen distributions at the lunar south pole from a lunar orbit with a perilune less than 20 km. The 6U spacecraft was launched as a secondary payload onboard Artemis I (191). The mission ended in late-2023 as the BIT-3 was inoperable and unable to perform the required mission maneuvers. The mission team concluded that the propulsion system’s tank valve was stuck closed (192) (193).\n\nSummary Table of Devices\n\nSee table 4-9 for current state-of-the-art gridded-ion devices applicable to small spacecraft.\n\nHall-Effect\n\nTechnology Description\n\nThe Hall-effect thruster (HET) is arguably the most successful in-space EP technology by quantity of units flown. The Soviet Union first flew a pair of EDB Fakel SPT-60 HETs on the Meteor-1-10 spacecraft in 1971. Between 1971 and 2018, over 300 additional HETs flew internationally, although EDB Fakel produced the vast majority. The first flight of a non-Russian HET was on board the European Space Agency (ESA) Small Missions for Advanced Research in Technology (SMART-1) spacecraft in 2003. SMART-1 employed the French PPS-1350 HET, produced by Safran (194). The first flight of a U.S. manufactured HET, the Busek BHT-200, was onboard the TacSat-2 spacecraft (195), a U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) experimental satellite in 2006. In 2010, Aerojet, another U.S. entity, began commercially delivering their 4.5 kW XR5 HET (196), formerly BPT-4000. Launches of HETs greatly accelerated in 2019 with the launch of 120 SpaceX Starlink and 6 OneWeb spacecraft (197), each using an HET. As of November 2023, SpaceX has launched over 5,500 Starlink satellites, and OneWeb has launched over 600 satellites. Suffice to say that HETs have become a mainstream in-space propulsion technology.\n\nThe rapid growth in demand for HETs can be attributed to their simple design, historically well-demonstrated reliability, good efficiency, high specific impulse, and high thrust-to-power ratio. Although, the higher voltage gridded-ion thrusters (GIT) can achieve even higher specific impulse, HETs can achieve higher thrust-to-power ratios because the HET’s higher density quasi-neutral plasma is not subject to space-charge limitations. The HET’s higher thrust-to-power ratio will typically shorten spacecraft transit time. On the other end of the spectrum, arcjets provide significantly higher thrust than HETs, however material limitations prevent arcjets from matching the HET’s electrical efficiency and specific impulse. For many missions, HETs provide a good balance of specific impulse, thrust, cost, and reliability.\n\nHETs are a form of ion propulsion, ionizing and electrostatically accelerating the propellant. Historically, all HETs flown in space have relied on xenon propellant, given its high molecular weight, low ionization energy, and ease of handling. The recent exception is the SpaceX Starlink spacecraft using krypton propellant. While HETs typically operate less efficiently with krypton propellant, and krypton has more challenging storage requirements, krypton gas is considerably lower cost than xenon gas. Lower cost is a compelling attribute when the potential number of spacecraft are projected in the thousands, as with constellations. While xenon is generally a superior propellant, krypton fed Hall thrusters will likely become more common in the future, especially for large constellations. SpaceX’s 2nd Generation Starlink spacecraft made another first using argon as a Hall thruster propellant. While argon has been commonly tested with lab HETs due to its low cost and good availability, argon is not generally considered a good choice for spaceflight due to its challenging storage requirements. However, given SpaceX’s need for such large volumes of propellant for the thousands of satellites planned, supply chain challenges may provide good justification for their use of this generally non-ideal propellant. Many other propellants have been considered and ground tested for Hall-effect thrusters, but to date only Hall-effect thrusters using xenon, krypton, or argon have flown.\n\nAs schematically shown in figure 4.30, HETs apply a strong axial electric field and radial magnetic field near the discharge chamber exit plane. The E x B force greatly slows the mean axial velocity of electrons and results in an azimuthal electron current many times greater than the beam current. This azimuthal current provides the means by which the incoming neutral propellant is collisionally ionized. These ions are electrostatically accelerated and only weakly affected by the magnetic field. The electron source is a low work function material typically housed in a refractory metal structure (i.e., hollow cathode), historically located external to the HET body. Many recent thruster designs have begun centrally mounting the cathode in the HET body as shown in figure 4.30. The cathode feeds electrons to the HET plasma and neutralizes the plasma plume ejected from the thruster. The high voltage annular anode sits at the rear of the discharge chamber and typically functions as the propellant distribution manifold.\n\nKey Integration and Operational Considerations\n\nGround Facility Effects: Ground facility effects may result in inconsistencies between ground and flight performance. The significance of the inconsistencies depends on factors such as test facility scale, test facility pumping speed, intrusiveness of diagnostics, and thruster electrical configuration.\n\nContamination: Plume ions of an HET can affect spacecraft surfaces by erosion or contamination, even at large plume angles. Ground facility measurement of ion density at large angles may under predict flight conditions.\n\nThermal Soak-Back: HET core temperature may exceed 400°C with the cathode exceeding 1000°C. Most HET waste heat radiates directly from the HET surfaces. However, some thermal soak-back to the spacecraft will occur through the mounting structure, propellant feed lines, electrical harness, and radiation.\n\nSurvival Heaters: Given the thermal isolation between the HET and spacecraft, the HET may require a survival heater depending on the qualification temperature and flight environments.\n\nPerformance: HET performance may vary over the life of the device due to erosion and contamination of the plasma wetted HET surfaces. Magnetically shielded thrusters demonstrate less time dependency to their performance than classical HETs.\n\nThruster Lifetime: Classical HETs are primarily life-limited by erosion of the discharge chamber wall. Magnetically shielded HETs are primarily life-limited by erosion of the front pole covers.\n\nCathode Lifetime: Cathode lifetime may be sensitive to propellant purity and pre-launch environmental exposure. Feed system cleanliness, bake-out, and use of a high purity propellant are key factors in maximizing cathode lifetime. The HET manufacturer may recommend a maximum cumulative atmospheric exposure and humidity. Some cathode emitter formulations are less sensitive to propellant impurities and atmospheric exposure, but these formulations may require other trades such as a higher operating temperature.\n\nRoll Torque: The E x B force results in a slight swirl torque. For missions requiring extended thruster operations, a secondary propulsion system or reaction wheels may be needed to counter the torque buildup. The roll torque may largely be countered by periodically reversing the direction of the magnetic field. Field reversal requires switching the polarity of current to the magnet coils. Field reversal is only possible with HETs using electromagnets.\n\nThrust Vector: Non-uniformity of the azimuthal plasma, magnetic field, or propellant flow may result in slight variations of the thrust vector relative to the HET physical centerline. Temperature variation of the HET, such as during startup, may result in a slight walking of the thrust vector.\n\nHeaterless Cathodes: Heaterless cathode technologies continue to mature. The benefit of a heaterless cathode is elimination of the cathode heater, typically an expensive component due to rigorous manufacturing and acceptance processes. However, the physics of heaterless cathode life-limiting processes require further understanding. Nevertheless, heaterless cathode demonstrations have empirically shown significant promise. Heaterless cathode requirements on the EP system differ from an HET with a cathode heater. Impacts on the power processing unit and feed system should be well understood when trading a heaterless versus heated cathode.\n\nThrottling Range: HETs typically throttle stably over a wide range of power and discharge voltage. This makes an HET attractive for missions requiring multiple throttle set-points. However, an HET operates most efficiently at specific throttle conditions. O"
