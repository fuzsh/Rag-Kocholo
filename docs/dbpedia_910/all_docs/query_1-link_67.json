        "text": "Two hydraulic systems connected by cross-link hydraulic pipes to the 4-wheel independent suspension's hydraulic cylinders absorb road bumps and help reduce body lean when cornering. This helps minimize fluctuation of view of those on board and provides a more comfortable ride. Unlike other similar systems, this does not need a power source, so there is no trade-off with fuel economy."
