        "text": "The much-anticipated Toyota LandCruiser 300 Series has been spied on Australian soil ahead of its imminent launch.\n\nThe redesigned full-sized SUV will arrive in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nInstagram user benjamin.foon spied this example in Melbourne traffic, with his photos shared by the account land.cruiser.300.\n\nIt looks to be the GR Sport model, judging by the unique wheels and rear bumper. The badging has been taped over.\n\nThere are no shots of the front, however we can see this example is fitted with a bullbar.\n\nToyota has yet to officially confirm the model line-up coming to Australia, though the 300 Series model page on the Toyota website makes note of only one engine.\n\nThatâs Toyotaâs new 3.3-litre twin-turbo V6 diesel, producing 227kW of power and 700Nm of torque. Itâs mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe 300 Series range in markets like the Middle East will be topped by a new 3.5-litre twin-turbo petrol V6, which makes 305kW and 650Nm. A hybrid petrol V6 is also expected in due course.\n\nThe new GR Sport trim level has more of an off-road focus, and features black lower body trim, wheels, wing mirrors and wheel arch linings.\n\nIt also has a unique front apron, including a grille featuring the Toyota word mark for a retro look.\n\nThe 300 Series LandCruiser is the first vehicle from Toyota to use the TNGA-F body-on-frame architecture, which is expected to underpin the next Tundra, Prado and Sequoia among others.\n\nItâs also the first all-new LandCruiser in 14 years.\n\nToyota claims the 300 Series is up to 200 kilograms lighter than the 200 Series and has received numerous enhancements to its off-road performance, with a lowered centre of gravity, altered weight distribution, and improved wheel articulation.\n\nTop-spec models will be available with a new electronic version of the companyâs Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System, which can achieve a longer suspension stroke by âeffectively disabling the front and rear stabiliser barsâ.\n\nOther off-road aids include a Multi Terrain Select system that automatically chooses the best driving mode for the current road surface, and a new Multi-Terrain Monitor, which uses the central display to show otherwise obscured obstacles from the driverâs point of view.\n\nThere are plenty of new items on the LandCruiserâs safety roster, such as emergency steering assistance for evasive steering manoeuvres, as well as daytime cyclist detection, and day- and night-time pedestrian detection.\n\nThe four-wheel drive can also detect on-coming vehicles, as well as pedestrians crossing the street, when the vehicle is making a turn at an intersection."
