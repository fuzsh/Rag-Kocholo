        "meta_description": "This paper presents an overall review on the historical concept development and research advancement of passive hydraulically interconnected suspension (HIS) systems. It starts with an introduction to passive HIS systems and their various incarnations developed over many decades. Next, a description is provided of a recently proposed multidisciplinary approach for the frequency-domain analysis of vehicles fitted with an HIS. The experimental validation and applications of the method to both free and forced vibration analysis are discussed based on a simplified, roll-plane half-car model. A finite-element-method-based approddach for modelling the transient dynamics of an HIS vehicle is also briefly outlined. In addition, recent work on the investigation of NVH associated with HIS-equipped vehicles is mentioned. Discussion is then provided on future work to the further understanding of HIS and its applications. The paper concludes that interconnected suspension schemes can provide much greater flexibility to independently specify modal stiffness and damping parameters &#8211; a characteristic unique among passive suspensions. It points out that there is a need for system optimisation, and there are troublesome NVH issues that require solutions. It suggests that further research attention and effort be paid to NVH issues and system level optimisation to gain a greater understanding of HIS and to broaden its applications.",
