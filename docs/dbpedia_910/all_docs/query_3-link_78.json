But i found info back in 2008 on the LC 200 release.\n\nSeveral posts.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOYOTA LAUNCHES NEW LANDCRUISER 200 SERIES WAGON\n\nToyota Australia today launched the latest generation of the LandCruiser wagon - the vehicle that helped Toyota establish its foothold in the world and Australian automotive markets.\n\nNew LandCruiser 200 Series has a stronger body, improved suspension, more powerful V8 engines that use less fuel and new technology that makes it even more capable in all conditions.\n\nLandCruiser 200 also has the world's first Crawl Control (on petrol models), multi-terrain anti-skid brakes and up to 10 airbags.\n\nToyota Australia's senior executive director sales and marketing, David Buttner, said LandCruiser had evolved over almost 50 years from a basic four-wheel-drive utility vehicle into an upmarket SUV.\n\n\"Everything Toyota has learnt in half a century of building four-wheel drives has gone into the design, development and manufacturing of the new LandCruiser 200,\" Mr Buttner said.\n\n\"It has retained the capability of the original LandCruiser, and added the comfort and convenience of a luxury sedan.\n\n\"New LandCruiser is more than a step forward; it's a giant leap ahead in technology, performance, specification and value.\"\n\nLandCruiser 200 is available in three grades - GXL, VX and Sahara - with two engine choices, both of them V8s.\n\nThe new 4.5-litre twin-turbo, multi-valve direct-injection V8 diesel lifts power to 195kW and produces a massive 650Nm of torque.\n\nThis is 30 per cent extra power and more than 50 per cent additional torque than the previous six-cylinder turbo-diesel engine.\n\nFuel consumption has been improved by 6.3 per cent and is just 10.3 litres/100km1 based on the official ADR 81/01 combined cycle.\n\nFor the Euro IV-compliant petrol V8 engine, now with variable valve timing (inlet), power is up 18 per cent while fuel use is down almost 10 per cent.\n\n\"It really is amazing what Toyota is achieving with the latest generation of engines,\" Mr Buttner said.\n\nThe updated petrol V8 is matched to a five-speed automatic transmission while the diesel engine is mated to a new six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nBoth have sequential shift that allows the driver to select gears manually.\n\nThe transmissions have artificial intelligence control, which allows their computers to select the appropriate gear ratio by estimating road conditions and predicting the driver's intention.\n\nNew LandCruiser 200 will tow up to 3500kg and the towbar is now integrated into the chassis for maximum strength.\n\nEngineers developed an all-new chassis structure that offers superior strength and rigidity by maintaining a separate frame and body.\n\nTorsional strength has been increased by 40 per cent and bending strength by 20 per cent.\n\nNew LandCruiser 200 incorporates styling changes that add to its adventurous, rugged image.\n\nIt is 60mm longer and 30mm wider, contributing to greater interior space without sacrificing off-road manoeuvrability.\n\nLandCruiser's coefficient of drag has been significantly improved from 0.39 in 100 Series to 0.35 in new 200 Series.\n\nThe interior is all about space, comfort, security and safety for the driver and up to seven passengers.\n\nWith the adoption of shorter-format V8 engines, the bonnet length has been reduced for improved visibility.\n\nThe front pillars have been pushed forward to increase interior length by 130mm.\n\nThe front seats adjust over 240mm longitudinally and the second row also adjusts 105mm, which means more legroom in the third row.\n\nFor security against theft, all models have an engine immobiliser.\n\nLandCruiser VX and Sahara also have an alarm.\n\nA newly developed transfer case employs a Torsen® limited-slip centre differential with a dial-actuated locking function.\n\nLandCruiser engineers designed all-new suspension hardware for dramatically increased wheel articulation.\n\nKDSS enables new LandCruiser 200 to enjoy two previously contradictory benefits - longer wheel articulation for the most challenging off-road driving and the roll control needed for confident on-road driving.\n\nKDSS is optional on GXL turbo-diesel and standard on the other five models.\n\nLandCruiser's chassis now employs high-mount double-wishbone suspension at the front with a hollow stabiliser bar and coil springs, replacing the torsion-bar set-up of the previous model.\n\nAt the rear, the reliable and trusted four-link with lateral rod, coil-spring system is further refined, delivering a longer suspension stroke for improved performance and better handling, ride comfort and stability.\n\nThe Crawl Control system on petrol models aids driving in extreme off-road situations, such as over rocks, sand or steep hills.\n\nIt automatically controls the engine and brakes to maintain very low speeds - in forward or reverse - with minimal spinning or locking of the wheels.\n\nMulti-terrain ABS reads the available road grip to provide the correct brake strategy on dirt, gravel, sand and bitumen.\n\nAll models have Hill-Start Assist Control, which minimises vehicle roll-back when starting on steep hills or climbing slippery surfaces.\n\nTurbo-diesel models also feature Downhill Assist Control, which controls speed on steep descents.\n\nNew LandCruiser features Vehicle Stability Control and active Traction Control across the range and up to 10 airbags - the most in any Toyota vehicle.\n\nRecommended retail prices for the LandCruiser 200 range start at $69,9902.\n\nNEW LANDCRUISER 200 RANGE HAS SIX MODELS\n\nThe new LandCruiser 200 range has six models, with the choice of two engines and three model grades.\n\nThe two engines are 4.7-litre petrol V8 equipped with VVT-i and 4.5-litre twin-turbo direct-injection diesel.\n\nThe petrol engine is matched to a five-speed automatic transmission and the diesel engine to a six-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe model grades are GXL, VX and Sahara.\n\nAll are highly specified.\n\nAll LandCruiser 200 models have automatic transmission, full-time 4WD, 17-inch alloy wheels including spare wheel, factory climate-controlled air conditioning with pollen filter, dual front SRS airbags, front side airbags, full-length three-row side curtain-shield airbags, second-row seat outboard seatbelt pretensioners, multi-terrain ABS (with EBD and Brake Assist), Vehicle Stability Control, Active Traction Control, Hill-start Assist Control, Smart Entry and Smart Start, second-row seatbelt anchorage height adjusters, third-row seatbelt automatic locking retractors, key reminder warning, in-glass radio antenna and rear spoiler.\n\nIn addition, LandCruiser 200 GXL has Crawl Control (petrol model only), Downhill Assist Control (diesel model only), a sub fuel tank, power windows, a six-speaker audio system and dual-zone front air conditioning.\n\nGXL petrol has KDSS suspension, while GXL diesel has the option of KDSS suspension.\n\nVX grade has the additional features over GXL grade of driver and front passenger knee airbags, second-row seat side airbags, privacy glass, front foglamps, matt metallic-look side steps, remote power windows and moonroof, door courtesy lamps, small overhead console, multi-information display (trip computer), Optitron combination meter, leather seat trim, leather-bound steering wheel and gearshift lever, power-adjustable front seats, 40:20:40 split-fold second-row seat (in lieu of 60:40 split) with twin cupholders in the centre armrest, front seat-back pockets, rear map lamps, alarm system and woodgrain interior dashboard trim. VX petrol has the addition features of a sub fuel tank and Crawl Control, while VX diesel has the additional feature of Downhill Assist Control.\n\nVX has KDSS suspension on petrol and diesel.\n\nTop-of-the-range Sahara has the additional features over VX grade of Back Guide Monitor (reversing camera), satellite DVD navigation with six CD/DVD/MP3 changer and nine-speaker audio, four-zone climate-controlled air conditioning, cool box, electric tilt and telescopic steering column, electric folding exterior mirrors, headlamp cleaning system, wood and leather gear shift lever and steering wheel which also has audio controls and electro-chromatic interior mirror.\n\nSahara has KDSS suspension on petrol and diesel.\n\nThe Sahara petrol model also has a sub fuel tank and Crawl Control, while Sahara diesel has Downhill Assist Control.\n\nThe Standard Van model has been discontinued, replaced by LandCruiser 70 Workmate Wagon and new Prado Standard grade.\n\nMORE TECHNOLOGY, FEATURES AND VALUE IN LANDCRUISER 200\n\nToyota Australia has added substantially more technology, features and value to new LandCruiser 200.\n\nThe biggest-seller in the range will be the 195kW, 650Nm twin turbo-diesel GXL, with a new six-speed automatic transmission and fuel use of just 10.3 litres/100km1.\n\nCompared with the outgoing model it gains $6390 of specification, yet the price has risen less than $4550 from the previous model to $79,990 RRP2.\n\nIn addition to the new powertrain, turbo-diesel GXL gains the technology of a Torsen® centre differential, Hill-start Assist Control, Downhill Assist Control, Smart Entry and Smart Start.\n\nSafety improvements include Vehicle Stability Control, Traction Control, Multi-Terrain ABS and front side and three-row curtain airbags.\n\nKinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) is a $2500 RRP2 option on turbo-diesel GXL and standard on all other grades.\n\nVX adds more features, more safety and more comfort than the GXL grade, including KDSS, leather seats plus knee and rear side airbags.\n\nVX turbo-diesel will retail for $10,000 more than GXL at $89,990 RRP2.\n\nSahara is the ultimate four-wheel-drive experience with extra equipment including satellite navigation, four-zone climate-control air conditioning, steering wheel controls, reverse camera and a cool box.\n\nThe price for Sahara turbo-diesel is $104,990 RRP2.\n\nThe maximum price difference from petrol to turbo-diesel in LandCruiser 100 Series used to be almost $13,000. Now with LandCruiser 200 Series it is only $10,000.\n\nAll petrol models have Crawl Control instead of Downhill Assist Control.\n\nPetrol models have the improved VVT-i engine mated to a five-speed auto transmission, and KDSS as standard equipment.\n\nOther specification upgrades in the petrol range moving from GXL to VX and Sahara are virtually identical to the turbo-diesel range.\n\nLandCruiser 200 Series owners will benefit from a fixed-price service plan offering Toyota Genuine services at a competitive price3.\n\nToyota Service Advantage for LandCruiser 200 covers up to six standard scheduled services during the warranty period.\n\nEach of these services costs just $180 during the first three years or 60,000km, whichever comes first.\n\nThe total cost of just $1080 in the first three years represents significant value and peace of mind compared with using independent service centres.\n\nLANDCRUISER HAS HIGHEST LOYALTY IN TOYOTA'S RANGE\n\nLandCruiser has the greatest customer loyalty among all Toyota vehicles, said the company's senior executive director sales and marketing, David Buttner.\n\nMr Buttner said almost two out of every three sales of the new 200 Series were expected to be customers upgrading from an existing LandCruiser.\n\n\"They are mainly affluent men in their 40s and 50s,\" Mr Buttner said.\n\n\"Many of them are entrepreneurs or private business owners who are looking to make a statement with their vehicle.\n\n\"They are successful businessmen, including farmers, with an average household income of around $120,000 a year.\"\n\nMr Buttner said most potential customers for the new 200 Series already had an affinity for LandCruiser and its history.\n\n\"These are people who actually use their four-wheel drive for four-wheel-driving, with 83 per cent of LandCruiser owners using the 4WD capability of their vehicle,\" he said.\n\n\"They don't want to feel confined or restricted in what they do - and they will appreciate the premium features of LandCruiser.\n\n\"At the same time, they won't mind getting dusty in their effort to keep exploring the next phase of their lives.\"\n\nMr Buttner said the new twin-turbo-diesel models were expected to account for around two-thirds of sales, and petrol one-third.\n\nThe private market will represent close to 39 per cent and business 54 per cent of sales.\n\n\"With the new LandCruiser, we anticipate a solid lift in turbo-diesel sales to private and fleet buyers,\" Mr Buttner said.\n\n'STANDARD' BUYERS REMAIN IN TOYOTA FAMILY\n\nToyota Australia has expanded the LandCruiser Prado and 70 Series ranges to replace the LandCruiser 100 Standard, which has been discontinued.\n\nThe LandCruiser Prado line-up now has an entry-level Standard grade with a powerful turbo-diesel engine, twin front airbags and the choice of manual or automatic transmission.\n\nEarlier this year, Toyota added wagon variants for the first time to the LandCruiser 70 Series range, including a Workmate wagon model.\n\nDavid Buttner, Toyota Australia's senior executive director sales and marketing, said the LandCruiser 100 Series Standard grade represented about 200 sales per month.\n\n\"We are confident of keeping those customers in the Toyota family - and attracting new buyers - by offering the Prado Standard and 70 Series Workmate wagon,\" Mr Buttner said.\n\n\"These new variants are aimed at buyers who require a vehicle for both work and recreational driving.\n\n\"Primary targets are government, rental and business customers, including tool-of-trade buyers and large numbers from the mining sector.\n\n\"In addition, we are expecting strong fleet interest in the new LandCruiser 200 Series.\n\n\"It is still the best vehicle - and probably the only vehicle - for the real heavy-duty fleet applications.\"\n\nLandCruiser Prado Standard models retail substantially below the price of the discontinued 100 Series Standard wagon, which last sold for $53,990.\n\nPrado Standard with manual transmission has a recommended retail price (RRP) of $44,6001 while the automatic variant has an RRP of $47,6001.\n\nThese are more than $3000 below the GX Prado turbo-diesel models.\n\nOther safety and security equipment fitted to Prado Standard includes power steering, pretensioners and force-limiters for the driver and front-passengers seatbelts, engine immobiliser, central locking, ventilated disc brakes and variable intermittent wipers.\n\nPrado Standard also features a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, 17-inch steel wheels, 180-litre fuel-tank capacity, 2500kg towing capacity (with trailer brakes), six-speaker audio with AM/FM stereo and MP3-compatible CD, power mirrors and windows.\n\nThere are two option packs. The first offers Active Braking with intelligence (ABS anti-skid Brakes, Brake Assist and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution), cruise control and a leather gearshift lever.\n\nThe second option pack for the manual variant includes front side and curtain shield airbags, while the auto pack comprises stability and traction control, climate-control air conditioning and an exterior chrome package.\n\nPower comes from a 3.0-litre multi-valve four-cylinder intercooled and turbocharged direct-injection diesel engine.\n\nMaximum power is 127kW at 3400rpm while peak torque of 410Nm is delivered from 1600 to 2800rpm.\n\nFuel economy on the ADR 81/01 combined cycle is 9.2 litres/100km2.\n\nThe LandCruiser 70 Series wagon, in Workmate and GXL grades, comes with two front bucket seats and a three-seat rear bench.\n\nLandCruiser 70 Series is powered by a 4.5-litre V8 turbo-diesel engine, featuring direct injection and an intercooler.\n\nThe Euro IV-compliant, 32-valve V8 delivers 151kW of power at 3400rpm.\n\nIt has the flattest torque curve of all Toyota engines with the peak of 430Nm being held from 1200rpm all the way to 3200rpm.\n\nIt is mated to a five-speed manual transmission with two-speed transfer case and a part-time 4WD system with manual free-wheeling front hubs.\n\nFuel economy is 11.9 litres/100km2 on the ADR 81/01 combined cycle.\n\nThe Workmate wagon includes vinyl seat trim and floor covering, 16-inch steel wheels, aluminium sidesteps, four-speaker audio (instead of two-speaker), intermittent wipers and five-person seating capacity.\n\nGXL wagon adds chrome exterior highlights, 16-inch alloy wheels, loop-pile carpet, front-door armrest, power radio antenna, cloth seat trim, keyless central locking, power windows and front foglamps.\n\nThe Workmate wagon is priced from $53,9901 and the GXL wagon from $57,4901.\n\nTOYOTA GENUINE ALLOY ACCESSORIES ADD STYLE TO LANDCRUISER 200\n\nA range of strong, lightweight and stylish Toyota Genuine alloy accessories will help protect and enhance the latest incarnation of LandCruiser.\n\nThe Toyota Genuine alloy bumper replacement bullbar is highly polished to seamlessly integrate with LandCruiser 200.\n\nThe alloy bullbar is engineered from rolled alloy extrusions and pressed lower panels, making it extremely strong and durable.\n\n\"Designed in conjunction with Toyota Motor Corporation using the latest 3D simulation modelling technology, the alloy bullbar combines function and style along with airbag compatibility,\" said Matthew Callachor, Divisional Manager of Toyota's Customer Service Division.\n\n\"In addition to laboratory testing, Toyota Motor Corporation took LandCruiser 200, fitted with an alloy bullbar, off-road for testing to ensure its structural performance in real-world conditions,\" Mr Callachor said.\n\nThe alloy bullbar can accommodate Toyota Genuine driving lights via dedicated installation points1.\n\nA heavy-duty steel bumper-replacement bullbar and winch2 is also available for LandCruiser 200.\n\nOther accessories include 18-inch alloy wheels featuring a rugged five-spoke design.\n\nTailored specifically to LandCruiser 200, the alloy wheels are painted metallic silver with a clear corrosion-resistant top coat.\n\n\"With the many and varied tasks LandCruiser is assigned to, heavy-duty Toyota Genuine accessories are essential to ensure the vehicle's versatility,\" Mr Callachor said.\n\n\"The Toyota Genuine three-bar heavy-duty roof rack set is made from extruded aluminium with a square-profiled cross bar.\n\n\"Each bar is silver-anodised for increased corrosion resistance and features tamper-resistant fasteners and rubber cushioning strips on the cross-bars.\"\n\nThe three-bar heavy-duty roof rack set is rated to 150kg when cargo weight is evenly distributed across all three bars.\n\nA new alloy roof luggage tray, compatible with the three-bar heavy-duty roof rack set, provides a stylish way to transport cargo.\n\nThe alloy luggage tray, made from extruded aluminium profiles for extra strength, is silver-anodised for corrosion resistance and features six internal tie-down eyelets for securing loads of varied size.\n\nThe Toyota Genuine alloy luggage tray is rated to 170kg capacity when fitted in conjunction with the three-bar heavy-duty roof rack set, and cargo weight is evenly distributed.\n\nA dash-mounted tyre-pressure monitoring system, available for the first time for LandCruiser owners, displays the temperature and pressure of all five tyres (including the spare).\n\nThe sophisticated and compact device uses wireless technology to receive data from small sensors mounted inside each wheel and can be programmed to alert the driver to low tyre pressure, tyre overheating and when the sensor battery requires replacement.\n\nAUSTRALIA MOST POPULAR DESTINATION FOR LANDCRUISER\n\nAustralians have bought more than one in 10 of all LandCruisers ever built, making this country the largest single market for the iconic off-roader.\n\nMore than 540,000 LandCruisers have been sold in Australia since the model's introduction here in 1958.\n\nSales of LandCruiser started in Japan in 1951 and had reached a global total of 5,117,304 by the end of 2006.\n\nA small Melbourne-based importer called B&D Motors sold the first LandCruisers in Australia - FJ25 models.\n\nAmong Australia's first LandCruiser customers in 1958 was construction magnate Sir Leslie Theiss, who bought several for use on the rugged construction site trails of a hydroelectric tunnel in the Snowy Mountains.\n\nImpressed by the vehicle, Sir Leslie became the Queensland and later New South Wales distributor for the Toyota brand.\n\nThanks to his business acumen, there were almost 4000 Toyota vehicles in Australia by 1964, half of them LandCruisers.\n\nThe original FJ25 short-wheelbase model and its FJ28 long-wheelbase variant featured a canvas hood, a 3.6-litre six-cylinder engine and a single-range four-speed transmission driving the rear wheels.\n\nAn additional lever allowed front-wheel drive to be engaged as required.\n\nIn 1962 FJ25/28 was superseded by the FJ43/45 series, featuring for the first time Toyota lettering across the radiator grille and a three-speed, dual-range transmission.\n\nThe following year saw the introduction of a military-style wagon variant.\n\nIn 1965, the FJ40 was introduced in both soft-top and hardtop forms powered by a 3.9-litre engine, its arrival boosting LandCruiser sales to 150 a month.\n\nLandCruiser's popularity grew further with the introduction in 1969 of the FJ55 series - the first LandCruiser designed specifically for civilian rather than military use.\n\nThe first LandCruiser Wagon subsequently arrived, then in 1972 the four-speed six-cylinder HJ45 diesel-powered LandCruiser ute was introduced to appeal to rural buyers.\n\nIn 1975 new engines in the form of a 4.0-litre petrol and a 3.0-litre diesel were introduced, the diesel providing a huge boost to rural sales.\n\nIn 1981 the FJ60 wagon and variants made their appearance here, including a 4.0-litre diesel.\n\nIn that same year the 100,000th LandCruiser arrived in Australia.\n\nAn entirely new generation appeared in 1985 with the 70, 73 and 75 Series models, as well as the four-cylinder petrol-engined Bundera.\n\nIn 1989 the military-style 70 Series received new overhead-cam 4.2-litre diesel engines.\n\nIn 1990 LandCruiser 80 Series was launched with constant four-wheel drive and marked the debut of both the 4.2-litre overhead camshaft 1HZ diesel and 1HDT turbo-diesel engines.\n\nThe 80 Series also had an injected version of 3F, becoming the 3F-E.\n\nIn 1992 LandCruiser 80 Series was upgraded with the 4.5-litre Twin Cam Multi-valve 1FZ-FE petrol engine.\n\nIn 1994, Australian sales of LandCruiser passed the 300,000 mark, the 350,000 mark being reached just two years later.\n\nIn 1998 LandCruiser celebrated the model's 40th year in Australia with the introduction of the new-generation 100 Series range that continues, in improved form, to this day.\n\nIn 2002 the 100 Series received an all-new quad-cam V8 engine and five-speed transmission along with numerous further refinements through to 2006.\n\nThese include the introduction of Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS), Active Height Control (AHC) and Toyota's semi-active Electronic Modulated Suspension (TEMS) for Sahara.\n\nLANDCRUISER 200 SERIES HAS ALL-NEW BODY\n\nToyota's new LandCruiser 200 has an all-new full-frame body structure.\n\nThe new body design provides improved styling, interior space, pedestrian safety and durability, and lower interior noise levels.\n\nThe combination of new stronger frame and new reinforced upper body structure improves passive safety and durability.\n\nLandCruiser 200 meets its interior space, styling and safety goals while maintaining its trademark off-road ability.\n\nClever packaging means the new 200 Series body provides greater space efficiency, while retaining the 2850mm wheelbase of 100 Series.\n\nThe new LandCruiser 200 has 130mm more interior length than the vehicle it supersedes, within a body that is 60mm longer overall.\n\nExterior width has been increased by 30mm.\n\nLandCruiser 200 was designed and built to meet the highest durability targets in Toyota's overall range - several times higher than those of a road-going passenger vehicle.\n\nCLEVER PACKAGING INCREASES INTERIOR LENGTH\n\nToyota's new LandCruiser 200 has increased interior space, while retaining the key ground clearance dimensions of its predecessor.\n\nClever packaging has allowed Toyota to increase LandCruiser's interior length by 130mm, while retaining a 2850mm wheelbase and limiting the overall length increase to 60mm.\n\nOne of the keys to increasing interior length was making more efficient use of engine-bay space in view of the new all-V8 engine line-up.\n\nExterior width has been increased by 30mm.\n\nThe increased interior length has been devoted to increases in couple distance (hip point to hip point measurement) in both first-row to second-row seat and second-row to third-row seat, and increased cargo space.\n\nThe couple distance increase first row to second row is 35mm and the increase second row to third row is 45mm, with an additional 50mm in cargo area length behind the third-row seat.\n\nThe new vehicle has 240mm of front-seat slide length and 105mm of second-row seat slide length.\n\nThe key ground clearance angles are:\n\napproach angle: 30 degrees;\n\nramp-over angle: 25 degrees;\n\ndeparture angle: 20 degrees.\n\nADVENTUROUS STYLING FOR LANDCRUISER 200\n\nToyota LandCruiser 200 Series has fresh, new styling, while retaining recognisable styling cues of its predecessors.\n\nThree design themes - \"adventurous, prestigious and trustful 4x4\" - were used to create the exterior design for the vehicle dubbed the King of Four Wheel Drives.\n\nToyota defined \"adventurous\" as a new rugged image that projects dynamic manoeuvrability.\n\n\"Prestigious\" reflects the role of LandCruiser as a premium 4WD.\n\n\"Trustful 4x4\" refers to a well thought-out design for off-road driving, backed by functionality.\n\nLandCruiser 200 was styled under the Toyota brand theme of Vibrant Clarity.\n\nThe coefficient of drag has been reduced from 0.39 to 0.35.\n\nThe designers enhanced and enlarged the front and rear fender overhangs.\n\nA thick, rectangular grille and headlamps add to LandCruiser's strength while the bonnet flows smoothly into the grille.\n\nThe height of the belt line has been raised to give the vehicle a more contemporary look without compromising driver and passenger visibility.\n\nCharacter lines are fresh, especially in the front and in the area around the rear door and handles.\n\nLandCruiser 200's new exterior includes transparent-lens, multi-reflector, dual-pocket headlamps and LED (Light Emitting Diode) tail lamps and high-mount stop lamp.\n\nSahara has the additional feature of headlamp washers, while VX and Sahara have front fog lamps.\n\nEach tail lamp has 12 LEDs for the tail lamp and 21 LEDs for the stop lamps, with faster light uptime for improved safety.\n\nThe centre high-mount stop lamp (CHMSL) is located inside the vehicle.\n\nLandCruiser GXL has four LEDs in its CHMSL, while VX and Sahara have six LEDs in their CHMSLs.\n\nAll LandCruiser models have a body-coloured rear spoiler.\n\nThe rear bumper incorporates a towing hitch cover to improve the visual appeal of the vehicle when the tow bar is not in use.\n\nNine exterior colours are offered, including four newly available and one newly developed colour.\n\nThe nine colours are: Glacier White, Crystal Pearl, Silver Pearl, Graphite, Ebony, Merlot Red, Gold Metallic, Goldrush and Blue Storm.\n\nNEW BODY STRUCTURE INCREASES RIGIDITY\n\nToyota LandCruiser 200 Series has increased body strength and rigidity - for improved crashworthiness and durability, as well as lower interior noise levels.\n\nIt also provides a stable platform for LandCruiser's improved suspension.\n\nComputer-aided design and extensive use of lightweight high-strength steel, backed up with a punishing worldwide testing schedule, have resulted in a high-strength, high-rigidity body structure.\n\nToyota engineers have retained the LandCruiser body structure hallmark of a separate frame and body.\n\nThey have developed an all-new frame structure that offers superior strength and rigidity.\n\nTorsional strength has been increased by 40 per cent and bending strength by 20 per cent.\n\nEngineers also worked on insulation and bushings to reduce road noise, suppress vibration and enhance comfort.\n\nLandCruiser 200 is designed and built to meet the highest durability targets in the Toyota range, several times higher than those of a road-going passenger vehicle.\n\nThe body has been reinforced at all four pillars and in the rocker panels, for maximum endurance - as well as rollover protection.\n\nLandCruiser's body structure also features pedestrian protection structures and design elements to improve aesthetics, with reduced front parting line gaps and a concealment cover in the engine bay.\n\nThe windscreen surround was designed for reduced wind noise, with a flush glass to roof structure, optimised moulding gaps and a redesigned cowl louvre.\n\nLandCruiser 200's frame has been redesigned and new manufacturing methods introduced.\n\nIt uses larger box sections and thicker gauge steel, including high-tensile sheet steel.\n\nThe front section of the frame has been designed to optimise impact absorption.\n\nThe frame has three hydro-formed cross-members, with increased connection rigidity to the side rails.\n\nToyota has continued to develop hydro-forming since Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan began using the process to manufacture rear suspension torsion beams.\n\nThe rear of the frame is a high-strength cross-member with a built-in towing hitch.\n\nThe evaluation regime for LandCruiser 200's new frame included bench tests for deformation and fatigue durability, four-post durability, road-road durability and a road contact test on a rocky road.\n\nTWO NEW V8 ENGINES FOR LANDCRUISER 200 SERIES\n\nToyota LandCruiser 200 has two new V8 engines for go-anywhere performance.\n\nThe two engines are a 4.5-litre twin-turbo high-pressure direct-injection (common-rail) diesel with 650Nm of torque and a 4.7-litre quad-cam multi-valve petrol with intelligent variable inlet valve timing.\n\nBoth are matched to automatic transmissions only, with artificial intelligence shift control and a sequential shift feature.\n\nLandCruiser's new 4461cc twin-turbo V8 diesel engine has 220Nm more torque and 45kW more power than the 4.2-litre inline turbocharged direct-injection straight six it replaces.\n\nThe all-new 1VD-FTV engine delivers 195kW of power at 3400rpm and 650Nm of torque from 1600 to 2600rpm.\n\nIt is matched to a new six-speed automatic transmission\n\nThe 4664cc petrol engine has the additional new features of Toyota's Acoustic Control Induction System (ACIS) for improved performance across the revolution range and air injection to reduce emissions.\n\nThe re-engineered Toyota 2UZ-FE engine delivers 32kW more power than the engine it supersedes.\n\nIt has 202kW of power at 5400rpm and 410Nm of torque at 3400rpm, and is matched to a five-speed transmission.\n\nFUEL-EFFICIENT ENGINES CHALLENGE V8 BANS\n\nThe fuel efficiency of Toyota's LandCruiser 200 Series engines should prompt company and government fleets to reassess bans on buying V8 engines.\n\nToyota's senior executive director sales and marketing, David Buttner, said LandCruiser 200's V8 petrol and turbo-diesel engines are more efficient than previous-generation six-cylinder engines.\n\nMr Buttner said the new engines combined improved performance with better fuel economy and lower emissions.\n\n\"These new engines demolish the argument that having a V8 engine is the same as having a gas guzzler,\" Mr Buttner said.\n\n\"Modern engine technology has advanced in leaps and bounds - certainly at Toyota.\"\n\nThe fuel economy of Toyota's new twin-turbo diesel V8 has been improved by 6.3 per cent, compared with LandCruiser's superseded straight-six engine.\n\nFuel use is 10.3 litres/100km*, based on the ADR 81/01 combined cycle.\n\nAt the same time, power is up almost one-third and torque is up by more than 50 per cent.\n\nIn fact, Toyota's V8 engine uses 1.5 litres/100km less fuel than a 3.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine offered by another company.\n\nYet LandCruiser 200's V8 engine has 65 per cent more power and 58 per cent more torque.\n\nLandCruiser's new petrol V8 engine, now with VVT-i, provides 18 per cent more power yet uses 9.9 per cent less fuel than the engine it supersedes.\n\nIts fuel economy of 14.5 litres/100km* is also 0.3 litres/100km lower than the six-cylinder engine fitted to another vehicle in the large SUV segment.\n\nVVT-i FOR LANDCRUISER 200 PETROL ENGINE\n\nLandCruiser's quad-cam V8 petrol engine has a range of new features to improve power and fuel economy and reduce emissions.\n\nThe 4.7-litre 2UZ-FE has the added features of intelligent variable inlet valve timing (VVT-i), Acoustic Control Induction System (ACIS) and air injection.\n\nToyota developed VVT-i to optimise driveability and fuel efficiency.\n\nIt is now standard equipment on all Toyota motor vehicles with petrol engines sold in Australia.\n\nVVT-i gives the LandCruiser 2UZ-FE engine a combination of driveability, performance, fuel efficiency and low emissions.\n\nIt provides continual variations of the intake and overlap to provide optimum valve engine characteristics for the full range of driving conditions.\n\nInlet camshaft timing is varied according to engine revolutions, throttle position, inlet camshaft angle, engine coolant temperature and intake air volume.\n\nLandCruiser's VVT-i system can vary inlet valve timing (and hence valve overlap) over a range of 40 degrees, relative to crankshaft angle.\n\nMaximum valve overlap (the period when both exhaust and inlet valves are open) for the 2UZ-FE engine is 28 degrees for maximum power, and minimum overlap is minus 12 degrees for optimum economy.\n\nToyota's electronically controlled ACIS varies the effective length of the inlet runners to make maximum use of the inlet pulsation effect for increased breathing efficiency.\n\nBased on information on engine revolutions and throttle position, it creates a long manifold effect to boost torque in the low-to-medium engine speed range and a short manifold effect to boost power at high rpm.\n\nThe new air injection system on the 2UZ-FE engine is designed to reduce emissions.\n\nThe system injects secondary air into the exhaust manifolds, to improve catalyst warm-up efficiency during cold starts.\n\nDIESEL V8 BUILT TO LAST\n\nLandCruiser 200 Series' new twin-turbo V8 diesel engine was designed for performance, economy, low emissions and durability.\n\nIt has the highest torque of any Toyota-badged motor vehicle ever sold in Australia and is Toyota's first twin-turbo diesel.\n\nThe twin-turbo LandCruiser 200 engine is based on the single turbo LandCruiser 70 Series engine launched in Australia in March 2007.\n\nThe turbocharged and intercooled Quad Cam 32-valve Toyota 1VD-FTV engine uses electronic high-pressure (common-rail) D-4D direct injection.\n\nThe two turbochargers have variable nozzle vanes to ensure high engine output, low fuel consumption and low emissions.\n\nThe two compact, lightweight, low-inertia RHV4 turbochargers provide high response and high output.\n\nThe 1VD-FTV engine also has an air-to-air intercooler and dual electronic throttle valves.\n\nThe intercooler is mounted directly to the engine to save space under the bonnet.\n\nThe cylinder block for the LandCruiser diesel is cast from nodular graphite iron for low weight and a compact size while resisting the high cylinder pressures of a turbocharged diesel design.\n\nThe 4461cc engine has a 90-degree V angle, undersquare (long stroke) bore and stroke dimensions of 86.0 by 96.0mm to maximise torque and a compression ratio of 16.8:1.\n\nThe bank offset is 22mm and the bore pitch is 97mm to create a compact block relative to the engine's displacement.\n\nThe forged steel crankshaft has five journals and seven balance weights.\n\nAll pins and induction journals' fillets are hardened to ensure optimum strength.\n\nThe base of the cylinder block has substantial stiffening plates to minimise vibration, and four plastic-region tightening bolts for each bearing cap.\n\nThe connecting rods are made of high-strength steel and the big-end bearings are secured with nut-less plastic-region tightening bolts.\n\nKnock pins are used at the mating surfaces of the bearing caps to ensure correct alignment during assembly.\n\nThe 1VD-FTV engine has aluminium-alloy pistons with combustion chambers in the piston crown.\n\nThe pistons have an internal cooling channel, a Ni-resist cast-iron top ring carrier to improve wear resistance and resin coating on the skirt to reduce friction loss.\n\nOil jets at the bottom of the cylinder bores spray oil on the underside of the pistons to improve piston cooling and lubrication.\n\nThe cylinder heads are made of aluminium alloy, with two-stage water-jacket construction to improve cooling.\n\nAn exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) passage reduces emissions.\n\nThe combustion chamber design includes four valves with a central solenoid-type high-pressure injector nozzle to improve performance and minimise emissions.\n\nThe injection system includes pilot injection control to improve performance and fuel economy and reduce emissions.\n\nA glow plug located between the inlet valves improves engine starting.\n\nFour camshafts are used to ensure accurate valve timing.\n\nCamshaft drive is by a gear train to an idler gear, by chain to the inlet camshafts and by gears from each inlet camshaft to its partner exhaust camshaft.\n\nIndividual cam lobes activate the valves via roller rockers with built-in needle bearings to reduce friction and optimise fuel economy.\n\nIn addition to roller rockers, the new engine has maintenance-free hydraulic valve clearance adjusters to maintain constant zero valve clearance between the rocker arm and valve stem.\n\nThe 1VD-FTV engine's twin turbochargers have water-cooled bearing housings for increased reliability.\n\nThe inlet air passes through an air-cooled intercooler and separate throttle valves for each cylinder bank, before reaching the inlet ports.\n\nOther features of the 1VD-FTV engine include a linear temperature-controlled coupling for the cooling fan, a fuel cooler, a fuel filter with a warning switch, a segment-conductor-type alternator and an oxidation catalytic converter.\n\nThe Australia-specification LandCruiser 200 diesel engine has an air pre-cleaner to suit harsh local conditions.\n\nLANDCRUISER 200 HAS NEW TRANSMISSIONS\n\nLandCruiser 200's two new engines are matched to specific automatic transmissions, both with artificial intelligence and sequential shift.\n\nBoth engine/transmission combinations combine the benefits of electronic throttle and electronic transmission control to optimise driveability, acceleration feel, shift quality and fuel economy.\n\nBoth transmissions have gated shift levers.\n\nLandCruiser 200's V8 twin-turbo diesel is matched to the new Toyota six-speed AB60F transmission.\n\nIt has ratios of: first, 3.333; second, 1.960; third, 1.353; fourth, 1.000; fifth, 0.728; sixth, 0.588 and reverse, 3.061; and is matched to a 3.909:1 final drive ratio.\n\nLandCruiser 200's new electric-motor activated full-time four-wheel-drive transfer has ratios of 1.000 (high range) and 2.618 (low range).\n\nToyota engineers used triple planetary gears and state-of-the-art hydraulic technology to produce a lightweight, compact transmission with high torque capacity and smooth shift feel - coupled with high levels of driveability and fuel efficiency, and low noise.\n\nRefining the transmission electronics, hydraulic servo units and clutch control has ensured a high-quality shift feel.\n\nSpecial features of the new Toyota AB60F transmission include torque-converter lock-up on fifth and sixth gears for increased fuel economy and a flex-lock-up system to expand the lock-up actuation range and further increase economy.\n\nThe AB60F transmission also has a deceleration downshift control to maximise the continuation of fuel cut and increase economy.\n\nThe five-speed Toyota A750F transmission in LandCruiser petrol models has the added features of flex lock-up and Toyota artificial intelligence (AI Shift).\n\nIt has ratios of first, 3.520; second, 2.042; third, 1.400; fourth, 1.000; fifth, 0.716 and reverse, 3.224.\n\nIt is matched to a 4.110:1 final drive ratio.\n\nToyota AI shift control\n\nThe Toyota artificial intelligence (AI Shift) transmission algorithm is designed to manage the shift regime of both LandCruiser 200 transmissions, taking into account road conditions and driver behaviour.\n\nIt uses data on throttle valve opening angle, engine revolutions, vehicle speed, vehicle acceleration and the brake-lamp signal to control the basic shift pattern, as well as providing road-condition support control and driver intention support control.\n\nThe AI Shift control can adjust the shift pattern to suit different drivers and provide engine braking for hill descents.\n\nThe system works in conjunction with the 2UZ-FE and 1VD-FTV engines' intelligent electronic throttles.\n\nThe AI Shift system has a 'downshift and hold' mode to provide improved driveability on hill descents.\n\nLANDCRUISER 200 HAS INCREASED ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLINESS\n\nToyota's new LandCruiser 200 has increased environmental friendliness, with both engines meeting Euro IV emission standards and delivering better fuel economy than their predecessors.\n\nLandCruiser 200 is the latest vehicle to benefit from a 21st Century Toyota whole-of-life environmental assessment program.\n\nToyota's Eco-Vehicle Assessment System (EcoVAS) is a comprehensive system that measures a vehicle's life-cycle development process, including the environmental impact it will have as a result of its production, use and disposal.\n\nThe new diesel engine has a thermoplastic resin head cover to ease recycling.\n\nIt also has lead-free bearings and a separable cap and element oil filter - so less material is wasted during filter changes.\n\nThe vehicle makes extensive use of Toyota Plastic Olefin (TPO) and Toyota Super Olefin Polymer (TSOP) in place of vinyl-chloride materials to decrease vinyl-chloride use and increase the ease of recycling.\n\nHighly recyclable TPO is used for the roof lining.\n\nEasily recyclable TSOP is used for the bumpers, with the material specification engraved on the inner face of the bumpers for easy recognition during disassembly.\n\nBoth TSOP and TPO are used in the instrument panel and console for ease of recyclability.\n\nThe instrument panel has slits integrated into the panel joints, to improve ease of disassembly.\n\nLANDCRUISER 200 CHASSIS AND ELECTRONIC AIDS PROVIDE GO-ANYWHERE PERFORMANCE\n\nToyota LandCruiser 200 has new suspension hardware and a range of advanced Driver Assist Technology (DAT) electronic driving aids to optimise on- and off-road driving performance.\n\nLandCruiser 200 has all-new double-wishbone, coil-spring front suspension with increased wheel articulation and improved rear suspension.\n\nIn addition, LandCruiser has the breakthrough feature of the Australian-invented Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) standard on all models except the GXL Turbo-diesel, where it is available as an option. KDSS provides maximum wheel articulation off road and a comfortable 'flat' ride on road.\n\nLandCruiser 200's brake package is all new, with 340mm by 32mm ventilated front discs with four-piston fixed calipers and 345mm by 18mm ventilated rear discs with single-piston floating calipers.\n\nThe brake control system features newly developed Toyota All-Terrain ABS, which literally reads the road to establish the ideal brake slip ratio curve for the traction conditions.\n\nAll-Terrain ABS includes Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist (BA).\n\nAll six LandCruiser 200 models have as standard equipment the electronic DAT package of All-Terrain ABS, Active Traction Control (A-TRC), Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill-start Assist Control (HAC).\n\nLandCruiser 200 petrol has the additional feature of Toyota's breakthrough Crawl Control.\n\nLandCruiser 200 diesel has the additional feature of Downhill Assist Control (DAC).\n\nLANDCRUISER 200 HAS ALL-NEW FRONT SUSPENSION\n\nToyota LandCruiser 200 has all-new front suspension for improved wheel articulation, handling, ride comfort and steering feel.\n\nThe new independent double-wishbone front suspension has coil springs in place of torsion bar springs, to increase suspension stroke and stability, and reduce harshness.\n\nWheel stroke has been increased by 15 per cent for enhanced off-road performance.\n\nThe suspension lower arm has been significantly reinforced.\n\nToyota has also redesigned LandCruiser 200's coil-spring rear suspension to improve handling, ride comfort and off-road performance.\n\nThe long wheel stroke of the 100 Series' rear suspension has been maintained.\n\nLandCruiser's proven rear-suspension layout is a solid rear axle, with four links and a lateral Panhard rod.\n\nThe improved design includes repositioned control arms to improve handling performance.\n\nThe repositioned control arms in conjunction with new suspension bushing characteristics improve ride comfort and handling stability.\n\nThe rear axle has been completely redesigned with a bilaterally symmetrical structure to optimise reliability and increase rear track while reducing weight.\n\nLANDCRUISER 200 HAS KINETIC DYNAMIC SUSPENSION SYSTEM\n\nToyota LandCruiser 200 is available with Kinetic Dynamic Suspension (KDSS) which gives new LandCruiser two previously contradictory benefits: long wheel articulation for challenging off-road driving and the high roll rigidity required for on-road roll control.\n\nIt improves both off-road capability and on-road driving comfort and confidence.\n\nThe system has the added benefits of improving active safety and environmental performance, as it requires no power source.\n\nKDSS comes as standard on all LandCruiser 200 models except GXL turbo-diesel.\n\nToyota purchased the rights to use KDSS from Kinetic Suspension Technology in Western Australia and designed a system to suit LandCruiser.\n\nKDSS in new LandCruiser 200 acts by adjusting front and rear stabiliser resistance; based on the movement of hydraulic cylinders installed on both the front and rear stabiliser bars and connected by a pair of hydraulic lines.\n\nA link mechanism is used to suppress the range of vertical movement of the stabiliser bars to ensure ground clearance.\n\nWhen vehicle roll occurs, the hydraulic pressure in the front and rear cylinders collide and the cylinders do not stroke.\n\nThis causes the stabiliser bars to twist - as they do in conventional suspension - to suppress further roll.\n\nThe action of the stabiliser bars ensures excellent turning performance and smooth steering feel.\n\nHowever, when the wheels on one side of the vehicle are raised, the cylinders installed on the front and rear stroke in opposite directions.\n\nThe effect is similar to loosening the stabiliser bars, allowing full suspension stroke.\n\nKDSS therefore provides flat ride comfort on road, good stability and improved ground contact for the tyres off-road.\n\nCRAWL CONTROL IS A TOYOTA FIRST\n\nToyota's new LandCruiser 200 petrol models have a breakthrough control system for rugged off-road conditions.\n\nToyota Crawl Control is a feet-off control system to take the vehicle over rugged rocky terrain, moguls, rubble, snow, mud, gravel and sand.\n\nIt only operates in L4 (low-range) and at speeds below 10km/h.\n\nThe system uses the vehicle's existing hardware, including electronic throttle, wheel-speed sensors, G-sensor and ABS actuator.\n\nA speed-selector dial on the centre console provides the choice of three speeds.\n\nThe system automatically maintains a low uniform vehicle speed uphill and downhill by controlling both engine output and brake hydraulic pressure, allowing the driver to concentrate fully on steering the vehicle.\n\nIt increases vehicle stability in extreme 4WD conditions by minimising wheel spin and tyre lock-up.\n\nThe system has the added benefit of reducing potential damage to the vehicle, by smoothly controlling vehicle speed over rugged terrain.\n\nIt reduces load on the drivetrain by smoothly controlling engine output and brake application.\n\nThe system can only be engaged under these conditions: transfer gear position switch in L4; shift lever in any position except P or N; vehicle stopped; foot brake on; parking brake off; doors closed; VSC system in normal setting; second-gear start system switched off; Crawl Control switch on.\n\nA CRAWL indicator in the instrument panel/multi-information display lets the driver know the system has been activated and the SLIP indicator will blink.\n\nThe system will deactivate if any one of the following conditions occurs: Crawl Control switch pushed; transfer shifted to H4 (high range); gear lever shifted to N or P; speed exceeds 10km/h; brake pedal pressed hard; parking brake activated; any door opened; VSC system detects abnormal conditions; transmission oil temperature increases to warning level; second-gear start switch is pushed.\n\nWhen the system is deactivated, a warning buzzer sounds and the CRAWL indicator will change from lit to blinking.\n\nOnce Crawl Control is completely finished, the indicator light will turn off.\n\nOn VX and Sahara, the multi-information display will message that Crawl Control has finished operation."
