The technology cost is expected to reduce as the market becomes matured with time. High level of innovation in terms of material science and module integration is likely to keep the costing slightly on the higher side during the forecast period 2018-2028.\n\nGlobally, the transportation industry is undergoing a restructuring, driving technology research, innovative mobility options, and collaborative company network.The competition in the automotive industry has scaled to such a dramatic level that collaboration of companies is the most sought out option for mutual co-existence.\n\nA high investment is directed for research and development by OEM, energy management companies, and venture capital firms to fuel the value chain of supercapacitor market.Regionally, the world is divided into Americas, EMEA, and APAC.\n\nEach region varies in terms of environmental conditions, governments regulation, and demography pressure.\n\nThe supercapacitor ecosystem has the presence of dominant energy management solution companies, pureplay companies, and startups.There are both private and public companies operating in the domain.\n\nA strong growth is expected for the emergence of private startup companies in the market during the period 2018-2028.\n\nThe report answers the following key questions in the context of the global automotive supercapacitor market:\n\n• What is automotive supercapacitor technology?\n\n• What is the cost structure of automotive supercapacitor product?\n\n• What major factors are expected to impact the market positively and negatively during 2018-2028?\n\n• What are the potential applications of supercapacitors in automotive technology?\n\n• What factors have influenced the market penetration of supercapacitor technology in key countries?\n\n• What is the role of autonomous vehicles and electric vehicle in the growth of supercapacitors?\n\n• What are the key materials that are utilized as supercapacitor electrodes?\n\n• What are the future opportunities for supercapacitor manufacturers?\n\n• What is the forecast global market value for the period 2018-2028?\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe transportation industry is an interconnected network of different transportation modes which create a value network for tire-1 and tire-2 suppliers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is an economically sensitive industry, it is highly driven by the current trends such as environmental degradation, growing urban population, and rising disposable income, among others. Government regulations of a specific region play a vital role in determining the success of the initiatives and trends in the industry. Some of the important criterions which influencing the policy regulation are be regional socio-economic conditions, acceptance of technology, demographic conditions, infrastructure availability, and global economic conditions (such as fossil fuel prices, international trade agreements, environmental challenges, and financial health). The supercapacitors have multiple applications within the automotive supply chain.\n\nA supercapacitor is an advance form of capacitor, which is capable of holding large amount of electric charge at a time.There are several qualities, such as long shelf life, high power density and fast charging function, which make automotive application feasible.\n\nThese key characteristics of a supercapacitor enables automotive applications in systems such as start-stop, light, ignition, kinetic energy recovery, adaptive suspension, electric, and hybrid vehicle drive support, among others.The automotive industry is currently focused on developing supercapacitor solution to be used as a mainstream electric power option in future vehicles.\n\nMajor drivers for supercapacitor application within the automotive industry are electrification of vehicle, advance self-driving technology, and smart connected vehicles.\n\nThe supply chain for automotive supercapacitors is categorized into six levels; component production, supercapacitor assembly, module assembly, package assembly, vehicle integration, and recycle.Component production includes raw material procurement and design and manufacturing process.\n\nThe most dominant cost head is the raw material.Further, a supercapacitor technology manufacturer and developer might procure components partially or fully from outsourced vendor for assembly of a supercapacitor cell.\n\nThese cells are arranged and modified to fit into a unit as per application requirements.Package Assembly level from an automotive OEM perspective has involvement of: tire-1 system supplier that integrates supercapacitor into a subsystem and supercapacitor module assembly that integrates supercapacitor cells and other components into a functional system for direct installation in the vehicle.\n\nDuring the final assembly of the vehicle, the sub-system or supercapacitor module is installed based upon the vehicle requirement.\n\nElectrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) has a major share in the automotive supercapacitor market.EDLC construction comprises two carbon-based capacitors, an electrolyte and a separator.\n\nFurther, the advancement in the automated automotive systems has led the implementation of other types of supercapacitor categories such as hybrid type and pseudocapacitor type.The future scope for hybrid type supercapacitors is high for electric vehicles and autonomous vehicle applications.\n\nThe growth in research and development of autonomous vehicle technology is led by tech giants such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nThe transportation ecosystem is undergoing transformation driven by technology research, innovative mobility options, and collaborative company network.
