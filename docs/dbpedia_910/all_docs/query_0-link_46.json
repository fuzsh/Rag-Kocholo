Authors submitting extended abstracts are encouraged to include as many details about their work as possible to help reviewers make informed evaluations.\n\nAt each conference, members of the Modeling and Simulation Technical Committee sit in the audience and judge all presentations as the first step of their selection of a best paper at the conference. The papers associated with the best presentations in each session will be evaluated further. The best overall paper will be awarded at the conference the following year and winners receive a cash award.\n\nPlease click Additional Details for more information.\n\nAdapting New Technology to Modeling and Simulation Infrastructure for Aerospace\n\nDesign, Development, Testing, and Validation of X-in-the-Loop Simulation and LVC\n\nHuman Factors, Perception, and Cueing\n\nModel and Simulation Integration\n\nModeling and Simulation for Aerospace Cybersecurity\n\nModeling and Simulation for Autonomous Guidance, Navigation and Control (joint GNC/MST)\n\nModeling and Simulation for Certification and Qualification\n\nModeling and Simulation of Air Vehicle Dynamics, Systems, and Environments\n\nModeling and Simulation of Space Vehicle Dynamics, Systems, and Environments\n\nSimulation of Air Traffic Management (ATM)\n\nSimulation-Based Software Development and Verification\n\nSimulator Hardware and Facilities\n\nOther Modeling and Simulation Topics\n\nMultidisciplinary Design Optimization\n\nPlease direct questions to:\n\nKai James, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nGiuseppe Cataldo, NASA\n\nThe Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) Technical Committee has brought together industry practitioners, government employees, and academics to present and discuss the latest developments in multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization for decades.\n\nMultidisciplinary optimization has been successfully carried out for problems ranging from the design of individual components to complex systems.
