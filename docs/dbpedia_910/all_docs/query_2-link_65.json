        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe influence of Formula One technology on the motor vehicle industry is enormous. Now, more than ever, the car industry is almost an \"ancillary\" industry of the Formula One industries. It is sufficient to witness the intricate network of transfer agreements between car manufacturing giants and the Formula One teams. The constant search for new technologies, basically the search for new solutions for the \"unsolvable\" problems related to performance, respect for the environment, and safety, induces the engineers working in the fields involving F1 technology to attend and monitor what is done in formula-similar areas. This is in order to have a possibility to drag up these technologies quicker than the market would force. As an indictment of the fast transfer of F1 technology to vehicle production, we may take into consideration the \"active suspensions\" that, in 1996, were equipping the Williams car driven by Damon Hill. Clever control algorithms and improvised sensors were measuring the distance between the ground and the lower part of the car, correspondingly adjusting the hydraulic jack related to the wheels suspension in order to minimize the car's response to accelerations due to irregularities on the road. In the end, control circuits represented a crude realization of important methods used to govern the so-called \"grey boxes\" in Congress rooms, with instantaneous \"data acquisitions\" on every aspect of the car race. Moreover, the active suspensions were the prototype of the actual control systems for knock rebounds. This technology was then frozen due to a regulatory administrative intervention. After that, these safe paths designed during the studies were developed in various fields, including control algorithms for the stabilization of cars in critical hazardous conditions.\n\n2. The Role of Physics in Formula One Car Design\n\nUnlike the real physics of the everyday human-scale world, which is governed by Galilean and Einsteinian laws of motion, the dynamics of Formula One cars obey the laws of aerodynamics, friction, quantum mechanics, and the special theory of relativity. The physics of these uniquely designed bollides combines mathematics and engineering. Even a cursory view of a Formula One vehicle reveals the inspiration behind the engineer's work. One look at the geometrical snarl of the current Formula One state, encompassing 25 races, unveils the basic principles guiding the car designer's hand and why they have little in common with everyday automotive engineering. Here, extreme time demands are fused with forward-looking attention, which helps find ways to push science beyond its present limits. So as not to fill the roll-cage with computer-programmed duplicity, the tasks in Formula One car racing are divided so that different groups of engineers and scientists work on different problems, from tire design and materials science to aerodynamics, computerized control systems, thermal management, and combustion control. Some focus is also placed on clothing the driver within a composite, yet uniquely exotic body-bag tailored to survive the unimaginable forces emerging during anticipated collisions. Our attention focuses on the role of physics in car design. We quickly conclude that the ability to mathematically model processes in Formula One cars is, in principle, limited. While conventional physics helps in showing how to circumvent the conceived problems associated with the aerodynamic design, the aerodynamicist must now draw on his artistic skills to design the most efficient aerodynamic shape.\n\n2.1. Aerodynamics\n\nTaking it to the limit: Physics in Formula One car design. In Formula One, there is an arms race not only on the racetrack, but also in terms of technical development and aerodynamic design. In particular, aerodynamic design is one of the areas where every little detail matters. This is because Formula One cars represent the extreme of what is allowed by the current set of rules, and there are a multitude of higher order constraints constraining development. The aim of the present article is to discuss the science involved in car design and illustrate, through this example, the role of science in fully exploiting the performance margins available in a given situation. The downforce created by wings and other devices is crucial for attaining high speeds in straight lines and handling corners. It is closely related to drag, which is the air resistance acting whenever the car moves forward. In the ideal case, no drag-producing downforce would be created because the air resistance vanishes as the car speed approaches the speed of sound. However, in practice, the assumption of irrotational, incompressible flow is not valid close to the car. This is another reason for including the study of turbulence in car design. This issue also beautifully illustrates how various disciplines in physics are interconnected. The development of vortices and their subsequent behavior in the wake of the car is a very much 3D problem, and vortex sheets can eventually form shock waves, which inherently are 3D phenomena.\n\n2.2. Mechanical Engineering\n\nThe design of an F1 car is concerned with the general principles of physics, and this chapter will try to explain these ideas in ways that the many aficionados can follow. The car structure and safety issues are related to kinetic energy and momentum; vehicle performance ultimately depends on the engine power or torque being transmitted to the wheels. Where maximum potential wreaks in a racing car is the track itself? Sufficient grip is needed to apply the available torque without wheelspin. Thus, technology becomes important as the engines become powerful enough to provide acceleration that stretches today's tyres. The engineering of an F1 car is able to minimize the viscous resistance to motion and to maximize the potential for generating lift forces at high speed. Downward aerodynamic forces have become the penalty for increasing engine power. The lift forces induced by underbody and rear wing designs are, in contrast, the major constructive contributions to cornering forces. Grip also determines a racing car's performance during a race. Unlike engine power that is used in automatic bursts, grip determines behavior directly. It is for this reason that strategies to compete have become exceedingly influential to assist overtaking, in the number of pit stops; taking it to the limit demands an efficient machine.\n\n2.3. Material Science\n\nThe use of materials/photon generation, transfer and application has also benefited the development of the F1 industry. The continuous efforts to obtain lighter and stronger materials, with enhanced thermal properties, has allowed the design of lighter and stronger F1 cars. This has been a major development in race car design, allowing faster cars because weight is one of the main sources of friction on constant velocity motion. Besides reducing weight, the materials used in race car structures have to accommodate a variety of mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, elastic modulus, and thermal conductivity. Titanium and its compounds have mechanical properties superior to Nickel-Cobalt alloys, as well as a better thermal response in a wide variation of temperatures. In conclusion, the ability to perform in high-temperature regimes, as well as its mechanical properties, has made Titanium alloys fundamental to the development of the F1 industry. In race cars, it is important to optimize many factors: the stronger the material, the less material is needed to build a stable structure. Titanium alloys became the focus of study for many researchers and industries as a way of combining the mechanical and thermal properties of pure titanium (53x106 K-1) and the machinable properties of Nickel-based super-alloys (13x106K-1). Among the many advantages provided by these materials, their excellent fatigue resistance is just as valuable in F1 applications.\n\n3. Pushing the Boundaries: Innovations in Formula One Car Design\n\nThe need to be faster than the competition has pushed this interplay between practical experience and theoretical insight into car design to unprecedented levels, advancing both physics and engineering in ways that were not possible for either. Every new car is designed as close to the existing rules as possible and then pushed to the extreme limits of those rules to find the tiniest amount of extra performance, which makes the difference between winning and losing. This constant push towards the limits is the fundamental driver for continuous innovation in Formula One car design. It provides the experimental data that can be used to challenge existing theories and to ask the right questions for the development of new and better ones. It initiates the use of cutting-edge physical concepts in engineering and opens the way for a wider dissemination and exploitation of innovative technical solutions. Most of the real innovation that we see in Formula One involves boundary layer flow attached to the surface of the car, which acts to bring the separated flow back towards the surface and to reduce the size of any potential wake. This is the only approach that can make the difference between a good and a bad car, by providing the car sufficient aerodynamic performance from a limited amount of front wing angle of attack, which in turn creates the necessary downforce for high performance in low-speed corners. The most successful team to exploit it is Red Bull Racing, using the variety of techniques that were developed by a number of competing teams in the previous seasons. Part of their success in the 2010 season was due to the use of a \"flexy\" front wing, which would bow down as the car accelerated up to higher speeds, effectively increasing the angle of attack and the downforce on the front wheels.\n\n3.1. Advanced Suspension Systems\n\nThe suspension, the system which connects the race car to the road, plays a critical role in determining grip. In a Newtonian universe, excluding bumps and kerbs, one would optimally set a race car up with the clearance of the car from the road surface being infinitesimally small. This would never allow the car to touch the ground, but unfortunately, the ride of the car would be disastrously rough. It would be like driving along Australia's most corrugated dirt road. The car would simply jump into the air, never touching the road surface. Clearly, this scenario is not optimal nor even possible in reality, let alone practical. However, the reduced aerodynamic mid-corner, during cornering, and high-speed downforce penalties can be mitigated with advanced inter-dependent hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical systems. These systems detect separation between the tyres and the road and technologies that eliminate those gaps through self-levelling suspension system. Turbulent air caused by churning turbulent tyre exhaust airflow and external car tyre airflow crashing into the undertray of an F1 car generates a large proportion of the disruption and separation close to the car floor. Tyre movement requires the upper camera to perform double duty when interfacing with the bungee foothill: fairing and foil structurally as well as visually attenuate tyre shutter. Topic limiters were set to include only those studies from 2015 to current and Formula 1 car technology only, resulting in the exclusion of additional studies. The hydraulic system is interconnected from the side of the car and provides, in effect, a low-pressure bleed of the tyre's air to the high-pressure shock unit on one side (low reservoir volume) and withdraws the high-pressure fluid from one side of the inboard damper mounted on the car floor. It feeds it to the tyre undersurface area on the other side (large reservoir volume). The wheel that is the tyre undersurface with its large MFR-swept area of high-pressure fluid relative to the low-pressure small area side produces a high energy low-pressure [of the tyre] region that induces the tyre to retract and the car floor to higher. With the result that the car ride height is maintained. Should the car ride height reduce and the forced the fluid into the tyre low-pressure side, the intermediary in-effect blow-off floor mounted check valve is forced open to allow the pressure from the tyre in an attempt to maintain its shape and type/tyre life to vent. With hydraulic systems being interconnected from the car (low tyre side) to the inboard mounted floor damper system, which is a true F1 track exigency system. It uses the combined tyre shock system via fluid displaced by said tyre shock via a positively deployed blow off adjustable valve, to improve shock aero flow and F1 SF70H Renault Sport Formula One Team rear tyre boundary layer mixing and tyre shutter effect to car floor and outboard.\n\n3.2. Hybrid Powertrains\n\nIn 2014, the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) introduced the most significant change to Formula One regulations in the history of the sport. It mandated a 1.6 L V6 turbocharged engine assisted by kinetic and thermal energy recovery systems (KERS and TERS, respectively) with a fuel flow rate of 100 kg/h. This was a marked contrast to the 2.4 L V8s that were being used prior to the change, and the gap between the new and previous era performance of the cars was the largest that the sport had seen in recent history. Since then, the other three manufacturers have made considerable progress, closing the gap to Mercedes, which had dominated initial running with their superior Power Unit (PU). Consequently, the field is closer than it has ever been, with the top teams separated by fractions worth hundreds of seconds. This technical directive aimed to prevent the partition of the factory and customer teams through the supply of technical support following the issue of the TD and into the summer break, whilst at the same time maintaining secrecy against potential customers who were unlikely to meet the grand prix along with general speculations. It is likely that Mercedes inspected their hardware to ensure that it could handle the additional thermal load added to their PU and adapted the insulation within the thermal conglomerate accordingly. From the 2014 season, the electromagnetic motor of 120 kW at 50,000 rpm easily achieved the maximum allowed recharging speed of 0.4 kWh per lap. The question of how to use electrical energy was more conservative in the rear axle of the cars compared to what was permitted without KERS and was closer to the potential removal of the more modern tracks that had a conformation similar to that of a \"stop and go\" circuit; these included places like Hungary, Valencia, and at the time Korea. Since 2014, all the cars in Formula 1 have been equipped with two other energy retrieval systems: the Heat Management Device (HMD) which is mentioned in the technical regulations as TERS and a battery cell. Once again, all teams have been encouraged to use a particular battery standard that is guaranteed to last 5 years during charging and discharging pulses of 120 kJ in and out of the ERS with a minimum and maximum power limit of 4 MJ of energy overall.\n\n3.3. Cutting-Edge Safety Features\n\nWe also have the most advanced driver-protection system of any car you will come across. The carbon-fibre monocoque is only made to back up Formula One's reputation for making the driver as safe as is physically possible. The construction has improved year by year, laboratory-tested to guarantee that it is capable of absorbing the crash energy and keep the cockpit intact. Not that many years ago, Formula One's safety was brought into question by a number of fatal crashes. The technical community is still always vigilant at any kind of incident, constantly trying to improve the environment for the drivers. When one remembers how our own safety continuously improves, there is a sense of guilt when talking about cars in contrast with what happens, for example, with cycling, considered by many owners of race cars a relaxing weekend sport. It is clear, though, that road accidents are down to a number of issues, beginning from excessive speed to distracting influences. The obviously mandatory survival-cell is made mainly of carbon-fibre material, with some Kevlar added in specific areas. The cell surrounds the driver and is designed to resist well over 20 tons of force in all its relevant areas. Used for the first time in the Williams FW14 car, a side-impact system was required by the new safety regulations as a way of helping to safeguard pilots' heads against intrusion in case of side impact. Grove's proposed solution combined both structural and intrusion-limiting functions and was specifically designed to be deployed through lateral impact at any relative speed, from 4.8 m/s and greater. The system uses a carbon-fibre piston that moves within a carbon-fiber cylinder and includes a high-quality absorber to reduce impact to the pilots' head. Moreover, two independent systems are used per car, connected to the two sidepods to limit any kind of lateral intrusion. Such an advanced side-impact system is in line with the most recent safety development topics in Formula One."
