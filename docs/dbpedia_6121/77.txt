I eventually got Double Dragon II running at full speed (or something

close to it), but I haven't had much luck with the first Double Dragon.

I've done everything from using multiple emulators to hardware upgrades

to increasing the frameskip and overclock CPU settings. Nothing has had

much of an effect on it.

It makes me wonder if this game has been poorly emulated. Can anyone

run this game at full speed? What emulator did you use? What does

your machine look like?

Slow downs in Double Dragon are normal. The original arcade machine had

them, too.

I wouldn't classify the trouble I have had as slowdowns. The whole game

is just running slow the whole way. Even when my guy is standing there

by himself with no enemies to fight, it is still struggling with the

music.

I have really got to get me to a DD cab and see this for myself.

Playing it under MAME is so slow in spots it's painful, and I really

don't remember it being like that in the arcade.

Wouldn't be the first game I've come across that's not nearly as good as

I remember it being.

I tried both Double Dragon and Double Dragon 2 on MAME32 0.106 and

they both run at 100% on my ***@2.8 with 2GB RAM running Win2k.

What hardware are you trying to run MAME on, and what version / build

of MAME are you using?

My computer is admittedly slow. It is 400mhz processor. I put in an ati

128 mb agp card. It has 128 megs of ram. I'm trying to get more (and

perhaps faster) ram this weekend.

Despite this, I've been able to get almost all the games I want to play

to run at or near full speed. Sometimes, it took a while and a lot of

experimentation. For instance, star wars the arcade game wouldn't run

on mame, but it runs perfectly with dmame without my having to do

anything to help it. And side-scrollers similar to double dragon

(double dragon 2, xmen tag, rastan, crime fighters, forgotten worlds,

etc.) run well with some tweaking on my part.

I've tried running DD with various windows versions of Mame and various

versions of DMAME. It hasn't worked.

Mine runs at full whack on a P4 1.6GHz machine.

Computer in an old cabinet sort of look.

Try FastMAME. That should do the trick.
