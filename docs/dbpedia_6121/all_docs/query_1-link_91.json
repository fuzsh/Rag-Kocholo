        "text": "Over the last year or so, I’ve found my childhood love for comic books reignited somethin’ fierce. Not that I ever stopped liking them, mind you, but for something that was one of my primary hobbies as a youngster, a long, long stretch went by where I would only pick issues up here and there, if they really struck my fancy. That has since flipped considerably, to heights previously unseen since my formative years. Actually, since I’ve got real money to goof around with now (even when I probably shouldn’t), I can and do exceed whatever constituted said previous heights. ‘Course, now collecting comes with the caveat of my general rule of thumb of “’94 and before,” which applies to pretty much anything I collect (though there are always exceptions), which wasn’t the case back in the day, since it was, uh, already before 1994.\n\nNowadays, stops at my longtime local comic shop are a regular thing again – and I always purchase something. And what’s double-cool is that this probably isn’t a bad investment, either; much of the 1960s and 1970s stuff I’ve been snapping up is still fairly affordable, but when you think about it, those comics are now over the 60 & 50 years (!) old marks – it’s not hard to imagine them going up even more in price as the years roll on. (Indeed, some of them are already pretty pricey online, though luckily the in-person buys at my local spot are, for the most part, still entirely reasonable, while still being fair to the proprietor – which makes sense, since the dude’s the one pricing them and he’s been doing this sort of thing for decades.)\n\nSome things never change though: my interests, as in superheroes of choice, are largely the same as they were back in the day. Namely, Superman, Batman and Spider-Man, in that order. Not that I wasn’t fond of others, I was and am, but those were the main guys for me. Said order was probably a little different during my earlier years; as I recall it, it was mostly Supes and Batguy battling for supremacy in my lil’ mind, but with the Tim Burton films, the Kenner toy lines and the animated series all coming at me full force, I’d say Bats probably got the ultimate nod back then. Today, I’m still a Batman Batfan, but when it comes to this sort of thing, I’m more of a Superman, uh, man.\n\nAdmittedly I’m more DC than Marvel, but I like Marvel, and Spidey, plenty. In fact, what we’re going to look at today, it’s something that had been on my mental want list for years, well before this full-fledged comic love resurgence, and it’s firmly Marvel/Spider-Man. (Also, I’m well aware that my tastes are considerably mainstream. I also don’t care. If preferring some ‘extreme’ underground comic inked by a homeless guy in an alley that only sold three copies would give me more street cred, well, I think I’m good with where I’m at.)\n\nDig this: it’s The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game handheld! Put out by Bandai America way back in 1980 (a whopping 44 years ago as of this writing!), this may very well be the first electronic Spider-Man handheld ever released. Don’t quote me on that, I’m not positive, but I’ve certainly never seen an earlier one. I mean, there were handheld pinball and slide puzzle games beforehand, but as far as I know, there was nothing electric and/or electronic about those. Not unless you count the kinetic energy created by the sheer force of my slamming a slide puzzle against the wall, that is. (I’ll buy old slide puzzles as advertisement/promotional pieces, but the idea of actually playing with one is… not entrancing.)\n\nYes, I totally used a disposable plate as my background for these pics; hey, it was clean and clear and readily available. You call it silly; I call it ingenuity.\n\nLike I said, I’ve wanted one of these for quite some time; I’m not gonna bother linking to any of the posts, but longtime readers should know I love me some old handhelds. And this one has legitimate pop culture clout to boot! Cool winnins! So why did it take me so long to obtain one? Because, given its age, it tends to be relatively obscure, and when you factor in the licensed superhero aspect, sometimes pricey as well. And of course, since these things were primarily owned by kids and are now a thousand years old, condition, both cosmetic and functioning, also comes into play.\n\nFinally, one popped up with a price that didn’t make me turn to an imaginary camera and shed a single tear, and while I wasn’t quite sure if it was fully tested and working, the price was right enough that I decided to take a chance. Did I ultimately prevail? Read on! (Hint: I wasn’t unhappy. Not about this, anyway.)\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game is certainly electronic, but in practice, the best way I can describe it is as a battery-powered, handheld board game. The idea is to push the play button, which will set a red LED light in motion, eventually stopping on one of the spots on the board. It’s a real “two steps forward, one step back” kinda deal; you want to land on spots that’ll move you upward (“Leaps +4” and so on), but since there needs to be some kind of challenge, there are also spots that’ll move you backwards, or keep you in place. After each turn, you move your little Spidey-Guy token backwards or forwards (or no-wards) accordingly. It’s sort of like Press Your Luck, except after hitting the play button the game itself randomly picks what you land on.\n\nThe goal is for you, as Spider-Man DUH, to reach the top of the burning building and rescue J. Jonah Jameson. Of course, he’ll probably just find a way to blame Spidey for the whole mess, but no one ever said being a superhero was easy. Talk about a Whammy!\n\nHere’s a closer look at the controls at your disposal. There, uh, ain’t much – but then, you don’t really need much.\n\nAs you can see, there’s the expected on/off switch, the play button that sets everything in motion (naturally once the game is powered and on of course HAW HAW HAW), up top you’ve got your little Spider-Man levers that keep track of how far you’ve progressed up the building, and at the bottom, the scoring dials.\n\nThe scoring dials bring up an important point: you can play this by yourself, but it’s a sad, lonely, yet fast-moving, existence. I know this from experience; it’s not like I could get anyone over here to play this thing with me. (Aw shucks, I just gave away the answer as to whether the game works or not, didn’t I?) The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game is really meant for two players, as the set-up on the game here, not to mention the old TV commercial for it (more on that in a bit), made abundantly clear. As a single player, there simply aren’t enough negative/neutral spots to land on to keep you from advancing up the building in short order. With two players though, I can see this all being competitive, albeit mildly\n\nHere’s the back of the game, providing handy instructions and a battery compartment for your required battery. See how that works?\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game demands one 9-volt battery of the user, which was a bit of an issue for yours truly, since I rarely have the need and/or use for a 9-volt battery. I did find one, but it was pretty old, and pretty much the opposite of a name brand. I’m not even sure why it was here, but I figured if it kept me from having to obtain a new 9-volt battery I’ll never ever use again, hey, I’ll give it a try.\n\nIn short, it didn’t work. Not really, anyway. It did power the game up, as far as giving me an LED to gawk at, but it wouldn’t actually play. This was undesirable, to say the least. FINE, guess I’ll be a responsible blogger and get a brand-new name brand battery to try my little Spider game out.\n\nLuckily, that did the trick. The game fired right up and allowed me to play. Victory is mine! There I was, playing The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game, all by myself, on a disposable plate. You know, when I word it like that, my unwarranted ego sounds even more unwarranted.\n\nAs for the instructions, I’ve already given you the gist of the game, though I’m a little unclear on the “shots you’ve taken” part. Do they just mean turns? Or, like, punches, when a two-player game naturally devolved into fisticuffs? Spider-Man wouldn’t approve of that.\n\nOkay, let’s play!\n\nIt works! It works! I know I’ve already established that, but now you can see the bright red flashin’ LED, thus proving my honesty. Did you think I was laying? I wasn’t.\n\nThe revelation that this thing worked just fine was cause for celebration, so much so that I had to fight the urge to march around my neighborhood shouting “Spider-Guy! Spider-Guy! The amazincredible Spider-Guy! Yo man, that there’s the Spider-Guy!” whilst obnoxiously pumping my fists.\n\n(That’s how the song went, right?)\n\nAnyway, I was off to a good start! +1! Sure, I can do that!\n\nD’oh! Two steps back! Never before had I so truly known the sadness and heartache of Bruce Springsteen’s “One Step Up.” I’m not positive, but I think he just may have written that song after a fast, furious round of The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game. I’ll be sure to ask him when/if I’m ever granted an interview.\n\nBy the way, did I mention this game is LOUD? It’s pretty loud. The game emits a high-pitched tone upon powering up and darting around the board, and when it lands on a spot, it doesn’t stop. Until you press play again, it just ‘sits’ there, driving your dog nuts. And guess what, plucky? Ain’t no way to turn the volume down, neither! Kids hoping to quietly sneak out of bed late at night to give this game a quick play without alerting their parents were in for a rude awakening! So were their parents, come to think of it.\n\nContinuous play saw my lil’ Spido-Mang steadily make his way towards to the top. Hold tight Jonah, I’m-a comin’! I wonder if his ever-present cigar is what caused the building to catch fire in the first place? He’d probably find a way to blame that on Spider-Man, too.\n\nYou know, for as simplistic as the game is, for the time, it really did give kids the option to ‘be’ Spider-Man. After all, you can only run around outside in a sad, homemade Spider-Man costume for so long before you start getting concerned looks from the neighbors. Do I know that from recent experience? I’m not tellin’!\n\nThat reminds me: one time I was in a thrift store, and some little kid was in the toy section. Evidently he had just found a Spider-Man mask (unless he wore his in, who knows), and at one point, I looked over, and he was standing completely silent and still, doing that web-slinging gesture at me. It was strange, and I can’t help but feel such shenanigans could have been avoided if he had had his own Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game to keep him occupied. Luckily, the tale now serves me well as filler this very moment.\n\nI did it! I did it! You’re safe, Jonah! I await your accolades! Hey, why are you calling the cops?\n\nI wasn’t jivin’ before; it didn’t take me very long to reach the top at all. You can play this by yourself, but since there’s really no way to lose, this pretty much has to be a two-player game. Otherwise, it’s all just kinda pointless. And loud.\n\nIt’s a pretty simple game, and obviously not much graphically, but given the time period, you couldn’t reasonably expect a whole lot more. LCD handhelds were just beginning to make the scene, namely with Nintendo’s Game & Watch titles, but LED was still the order of the day where this sort of thing was concerned.\n\nI will say this though, the game certainly looks cool. The bright shiny red LED, sure, but also just the molding and sticker and red-and-blue color scheme. It’s cosmetically attractive, is what I’m saying.\n\nBy the way, you may have noticed that I’ve referred to this as The Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game throughout, yet the sticker on the game merely calls it Spider-Man Rescue. So what’s the deal? Well, the sticker may say otherwise, but the packaging indeed identified this by the full title I’ve been going with.\n\nIn fact, so did the advertising. Not so much the comic book ad, which I can’t find a decent scan of to link to right now (it refers to J. Jonah Jameson as Spidey’s friend, which I hope was just them being sarcastic), but the television commercial certainly did. Here, see for yourself if you don’t believe me!\n\nIt was kind of a goofy spot, again noting Jameson simply as “friend” while a jingle + voiceover briefly gave the run down on how the thing operated. Like any good commercial, they made the game look a whole lot more exciting than it actually was, but then, it was a simpler time; maybe it was genuinely exciting back then?\n\nThe ad also made a point of showing two kids (see, told you it’s ideally two-player!) battling for Spider-Man supremacy, before one raises his arms enthusiastically and then starts annoyingly doing victory clasps while his (now former?) friend exaggeratedly displays his crushing defeat. It’s the kind of behavior that could potentially result in punches being thrown in real life, but like I said, it was a simpler time; maybe this was how kids genuinely reacted back then?\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man Rescue Game is a neat artifact on several fronts. As a piece of comic book/superhero paraphernalia, as a handheld video game (well, maybe not technically the video part…), even just as an example of late-70s/early-80s kid-based pop culture in general. I’m not sure how well it has held up gameplay-wise, but then, I was playing by my lonesome; maybe some good-natured trash talk whilst playing against a buddy would change my perception. Or maybe you had to be 10 years old in 1980 to get the most out of this, I dunno. At any rate, I’m certainly happy to have finally obtained this one after too many years of wanting it. I like it!\n\nBy the way, if you’re a Marvel fan but Spider-Man isn’t your cup o’ tea, there was also an Incredible Hulk-branded version! I don’t have it, but apparently it plays exactly the same; only the stickers and color scheme are different. Maybe I’ll go after that one at some point. Provided I can find it cheap enough, that is.\n\nFor the time being, I’m just wondering how long it’d take me to get kicked out of the comic shop by loudly playing this in there, whilst standing in everybody’s way and not buying anything. Worth a try? Maybe if I was dressed up as Spider-Man while doing so?\n\nNahhhhhh….\n\nNow gang, believe me when I say I’ve been wanting to showcase this retro video game oddity for quite awhile, and today is the day. Folks into vintage electronics and/or thrifting will almost certainly be at least vaguely familiar with the portable black & white TVs put out by Bentley in the 1980s. They were (and are) cheap and ubiquitous, and while I can’t find a scan online right now, I recall seeing ads giving them away free when you bought RVs back in the day. I would guess you could get them free any number of ways; buying cars, opening a bank account, and so on and so forth. That’s just a guess on my part, but considering how common they are and have been for many, many years, it makes sense.\n\nOr maybe they were just incredibly cheap to purchase from the beginning. They weren’t exactly high end, but they did their job and looked (look) cool enough. I’ve related this anecdote before, but I still recall taking mine on a camping trip back in like 1999, and staying up late watching Terminator 2 on Big Chuck & lil’ John with it (by the end of the broadcast, the power of the gigantic size D batteries had been sapped sufficiently enough to basically render the film a silent). Granted, there’s not much you can do with these TVs nowadays, not without jumping through some hoops at least, but the point is anyone who has been into vintage electronics for some period of time should have a passing familiarity with ’em, even if only by sight.\n\nWELL, it turns out lil’ itty bitty televisions weren’t the only things Bentley (not to be confused with the car company, near as I can tell) put out back in the 1980s. The most well-known and common, sure, but in addition to that, they also put out a similar-looking portable all-in-one Super 8 projector, which was, if nothing else, cool in concept; some of the reviews I’ve seen online don’t exactly give it high marks. (I have one of these, but it’s still new-in-the-box and I never had the heart to crack it open – especially since I don’t do much, or anything really, with Super 8.)\n\nAlso put out by Bentley back in the 1980s? A video game console!\n\n“Oooh, what does it play?!”\n\nThe Bentley Compu-Vision (though it’s often spelled “Compuvision,” no dash, online – which is my preferred personal spelling, though I’ll be technically correct here in hopes of staving off snotty comments) was released at some point in 1983, and is a compact, elegant little beast. The black casing with woodgrain trim (which extends along the sides) obviously recalls the Atari 2600, while the built-in controller bays and usage of “vision” in the name puts it on the same turf as the Intellivision and ColecoVision (plus, hey, ColecoVision, Compu-Vision, CV – coincidence???).\n\nWoodgrain was probably a little passé by 1983, even the then-current iteration of the 2600 had dropped it by then, but nevertheless, this thing just looks cool. From the onset it comes off like a 2600/ColecoVision hybrid. It’s a relatively small, lightweight console, attractively designed and with the shiny gold lettering of “Bentley Compu-Vision” lending it an additional touch of, I don’t know, techy class or something.\n\n“That’s all well and good, but what does it play?!“\n\nWhat’s more, the usage of “compu” in the name unmistakably plays into the then-emerging popularity of home computers. Computers were still a relatively-new thing to consumers – in a general, widespread sense – at the time, but their popularity was increasingly growing. Spearheaded by the Atari 8-bits and Commodore 64, and with the video game crash of 1983/1984 hitting consoles – and retailers – hard, the emergence of home computers as an ever present part of daily life (which continues to this day, right down to the smart phones we have in our pockets) can probably best be traced to the era we’re talking about right here. They certainly existed before, but it was at that point that their popularity with the general public really started taking off. Or at least that’s how I see it.\n\nOf course, where the Compu-Vision is concerned, that’s just fancy-namin’; this thing is a computer in only the barest of senses. Oh sure, it’s electronic and does electronic things, technically you could call it a computer, but functionality-wise, it was hardly a substitute for an Atari 800XL.\n\nNevertheless, from name to design, there’s little doubt as to what era this hails from. From outside appearances alone, it’s tough to imagine this thing coming from anywhere but the 1982-1984 timeframe.\n\n“SO WHAT DOES IT PLAY ALREADY?!?!”\n\nSo what does the Compu-Vision play, you ask? Pong. It plays Pong. And variations of, say it with me, Pong.\n\nQuick background: in the 1970s, General Instruments produced the AY-3-8500 chip. Easily acquired, this chip led to a glut of Pong-based consoles from a variety of manufacturers in the late-70s. Of course, since the chip played the same set of Pong variations across the board, this meant there was little difference between the consoles beyond outside cosmetics. Indeed, we’ve already seen one such example with the Wonder Wizard a few years back.\n\nWith so many consoles being basically identical beyond their case design, not to mention the emergence of cartridge-based systems (and yes, even home computers were beginning to make the scene), it stands to reason Pong-based units had sorta petered out by 1978/1979, though in retrospect they still remain interesting examples of video gaming, based solely on how they look (unless you just really, really like Pong).\n\nThe Compu-Vision here plays four Pong-based games. In order of my screenshots, there’s handball (called “practice” on the console itself), squash (often called jai alai on these consoles, which I wish was the case here cause then I could reference the “Killshot” episode of Miami Vice, which I guess I just did anyway), soccer (also often called hockey), and tennis, which is just your standard, classic Pong.\n\nBesides the expected power, reset and game variations, switches on the console also let you adjust the angle of the ball, the speed of the ball, and the size of the paddles, so these could all be made quite a bit tougher than you may first expect. The ball really zips on the fast speed, for example. This could make for some really fun, competitive matches, though I’m just surmisin’ here cause it’s not like I can ever get anyone over to play this stuff with me. Except for practice, these are all two-player only; my superfluousness has come back to haunt me!\n\nBecause this Bentley came out so much later than other Pong-based consoles, it shares some traits with other contemporary machines: sound is piped through the TV rather than the console itself, and unlike the Wonder Wizard nonsense I had to deal with, the Bentley uses a standard RF cord and switchbox. It also takes a 6V DC adapter, which I didn’t have available (or maybe I did and just wasn’t aware of it; I’ve got enough junk laying around to where that’s a distinct possibility). In a nod to Pong past, the console also uses batteries, though in this case it’s not several hundred (loose approximation) behemoth batteries, but only four AAs. Cheap and readily available, the convenience factor was/is off the charts!\n\nAll of this meant that getting the console to display on my PC and taking real, actual video/ screenshots was pretty easy. Yes indeed, those screencaps above were taken by yours truly, from this very console. Of course, given the AY-3-8500 used, the graphics (such as they are) are identical to any number of other Pong units, but I promise you, these here are from the Bentley. I mean, why would I lie about that?\n\nSome (but not all) Pong consoles had the paddle controls built right into unit, meaning players had to sit right up on the machine and hunch over it for the duration. But since the Compu-Vision wanted you to think it was more than it really was, the controllers, while ultimately hardwired in (always a danger: remember the Arcadia 2001?), are at least removable from the unit. The cords aren’t super duper long, you still need to sit pretty close to the console, but at least you can lean back on the couch some.\n\nHere’s the deal with the controls on these old Pong systems: decades of dust and dirt accumulate in them, resulting in them being pretty jittery on-screen. This is generally an easy fix, the potentiometers simply need cleaned. This is common enough that I automatically assume the paddles will be jittery whenever I bring a new old one of these things into the collection.\n\nBut you know what? This is actually the second Compu-Vision I’ve added to the collection (the first, my “collectible one” as it were, is boxed away safely), and in both cases, I’ve found the controllers to be excellent. Not only are they pretty comfortable, but they performed wonderfully without my attempting to clean them in any way whatsoever. Now you could argue that because this thing was so obsolete upon arrival (something we’re going to talk more about in just a moment), no one played it enough to get the controllers dirty, but I really think they’re just well-made in general. My first Compu-Vision, the controls were silky smooth, and with this one here, while they could probably use a bit of a cleaning, things are still entirely playable as it is. (Looking at the picture, you may be tempted to think there’s a bunch of grime in the base there; while there’s a tiny bit of debris, that’s actually the color of the nut used that makes things look uglier than they are.)\n\nI never would have guessed it beforehand, but the controllers on this are some of the best I’ve found on a Pong console. Whoda thunk?!\n\nWanna know the most interesting thing about the Bentley Compu-Vision to me? It’s not the name, or the design, or the controllers. Rather, it’s the fact that it was even released when it was. I mean, 1983! 1983!! It may not mean much now, but it’s unbelievable just how antiquated this thing was upon arrival in ’83. I’ve seen more than one reference to it retailing at $25, a ridiculously cheap amount even in 1983 dollars (if accurate), but even if you could get it free with the purchase of a car or whatever, as I’m surmising, no kid was going to really want this in any serious gamin’ capacity. Video games, both at home and in the arcades, had hugely evolved by that point.\n\nWhat’s more, the first flowerings on what we now consider the 8-bit era proper were in play. The Japanese versions of the Nintendo Entertainment System (as the Famicom) and Sega Master System (the Mark III) came out that year, and the Atari 7800 was in development here and slated for a 1984 release (which ultimately didn’t really happen, aside from a test market that year; we’d get that, along with wide releases of the NES and SMS, in ’86), but even the stuff already on shelves here in the U.S. was just miles ahead of this thing. Heck, it would have been outdated in 1979, never mind 1983! The fact that it was cosmetically made to ‘fit in’ just makes it all the more intriguing.\n\nIn a way, it makes a weird bit of sense though. I imagine the AY-3-8500 was still readily available, and video games were big business, so why not try to get in on the gravy train with an uber-cheap offering? Plus, it’s one thing to look at the console itself, but it’s not like the box (which I don’t have) made false promises. Aside from ignoring the fact it played wildly obsolete games, there was little doubt you were getting Pong with this thing. And aesthetically it fit in with home entertainment set-ups of the time, so I guess for a kid just trying to get the most consoles he could, it worked as filler if nothing else.\n\nPlus, Pong may have been old hat by 1983, but don’t underestimate how fun and competitive a simple oldie like it could, and can, be. Indeed, when this came in, I had to unhook the Atari Video Pinball unit I’ve been noodling with, the versions of Breakout and attempts at basketball on it having kept me fairly occupied lately. There’s something to be said for twitch, hand/eye coordination type games. So while it may have been ancient even in 1983, believe it or not there was still some fun to be had.\n\nNowadays, the Bentley Compu-Vision isn’t exactly unknown; there’s plenty of info on it out there in internet land. But conversely, it’s also not that well-known, either. The Atari/Sears Pongs and the Coleco Telstars and the Magnavox Odysseys will continue to get more press in retro gaming circles, and rightfully so. That said, I think I’d say the Bentley is my favorite *proper* Pong console; the games are tried and true, and cosmetically it’s attractive, but the fact that it’s so ‘wrong’ is what puts it over the top for me. (Though when it comes to Pong consoles in general, I think the Telstar Arcade still tops it for me, even though that one was quite a bit more advanced and played shooting and racing games in addition. Although, while it doesn’t play any Pong variants at all, I think I like the Atari Video Pinball more than any of them, at least where U.S. consoles in this particular ‘dedicated unit’ genre are concerned.)\n\nThe Bentley Compu-Vision isn’t particularly valuable; you can find them relatively cheap and plentiful online. The first one I bought was entirely affordable, and you know how much this one was? $5! Five bucks!! There was shipping on top of that, but even that was incredibly reasonable. I’ve spent more total on old VHS tapes than I did this Bentley! Now granted, it wasn’t perfect; the battery cover was missing, and it was sold as untested, but at that price, I could afford to take chances. At worst, it’d become a neat display piece. The untested part didn’t even concern me all that much; while that’s sometimes seen as dishonest code for “broken,” in my experience these old consoles were built like tanks; I tend to give the benefit of the doubt and figure the seller just doesn’t have the switchbox or adapter or TV or whatever to fully test these. And while there’s a few machines I’ve bought simply for collecting purposes (that is, I never seriously intended to bother hooking them up – and still haven’t to this day), for ones I picked up wanting to at least give a try, I don’t think I’ve ever gotten one that hasn’t worked to some degree.\n\nOf course, that’s just my experience; you shouldn’t use it as your personal guideline. But for me, I’ve had good luck with these oldies. Things back then were built to last.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for a Pong console to add to your collection, the Bentley isn’t a bad choice. It plays the same games as so many others, but it has enough then-modern attributes, both in looks and in connections, to make it a better option than some. Plus, it’s got that whole super-late release thing going for it. If this wasn’t the last Pong console released in the U.S., it’s certainly one of the very last. So if you’re only adding one Pong and don’t want to break the bank, hey, you could do worse!\n\nFriends, believe it or not, this blog is now 10 years old. 10 years old?! It’s true; I started it in March 2013. Back then, I was able to post a whole lot more frequently than I am now, but hey, I’ve stuck with it, and you know what? I WANT ACCOLADES! Gimme my accolades! Now! I mean, if you want. Please?\n\nThe earliest post here is this terrible old article from March 30, 2013 (don’t bother reading it), but there were a few posts before it that I no longer have up (I do that sometimes). As with anything else, the more you work at something, the better you become at it, and frankly, I don’t think I found whatever constitutes my groove here until, I don’t know, 2015 or 2016. Even then, there were things I did then that I’d do different now, but none of this really matters, so who cares?\n\nANYWAY, I don’t really have a big 10th anniversary extravaganza update planned, I guess I could have done one, but as previously stated, none of this really matters, so who cares? Nevertheless, our subject today harkens back, somewhat, to an article from those early, unformed days. Perhaps you’ll recall (though I doubt it) this old, old post from August 1, 2013, in which I detailed an uber-obscure old video game console by the name of the APF M1000. Despite the rough nature of that early effort (that one would look quite different if written nowadays), it’s done pretty well views-wise. Probably because no one had one of those things back in the day.\n\nSo what say we go back to the same wheelhouse, with another obscure video game console no one had back in the day, either. Although comparatively, fewer people didn’t have it than they didn’t have the APF. (In other words, it’s not as obscure.) Ladies and gennelmen, dig the Emerson Arcadia 2001!\n\nActually, design-wise the Arcadia isn’t dissimilar to the APF – right down to the uncomfortable, hard-wired controllers! But whereas the APF featured mostly rudimentary, first-generation type games, the Arcadia’s library was much more in line with the arcade scene of the early 1980s. There were a few actual ports of coin-op games, albeit mostly obscure ones, but don’t worry; much of the rest of the library was made up of shameless rip-offs of popular arcade games! Don’t think for a minute this doesn’t appeal to me.\n\nReleased in 1982, Emerson’s Arcadia 2001 was pretty much a flop. Ostensibly it was competing with the era-defining Atari 2600 and the 2600’s arch enemy, Mattel’s Intellivision. If those were its only two adversaries, it still wouldn’t have won the war, but it may well have made more of a splash than it did (especially with an introductory price of, supposedly, only $99, which even in 1982 dollars was still a pretty decent price for a video game console – if true, that is).\n\nUnfortunately, the Arcadia launched not long before the ColecoVision, which promised to bring the arcade experience home and did a pretty good job of doing so. Furthermore, Atari also dropped the 5200 in 1982, which was supposed to fight the Intellivison but ended up going head-to-head with ColecoVision, and beyond even that, home computers – no slouches at playing games themselves – were gaining in popularity as well. Released into this climate, the Arcadia just never stood a chance.\n\nNevertheless, while it never made much of a dent in the U.S., an impressive number of officially-licensed clone consoles exist throughout the world. And, even though the library wasn’t exactly gigantic or, you know, great, there’s still a sizable number of titles aping real, big time arcade hits. While it’s more of a curio than something you’d give more playing time to than a 2600, that doesn’t mean there isn’t still some fun to be had. Right out the gate, this thing has more vested interest in it for me than the APF ever did/does.\n\nYou’ll have to contend with some relics of video game past, though. No, I’m not talking about the cartridge format (I consider that a good thing), but rather, the antiquated, uncomfortable controllers. I’m not just talking about them being hard-wired into the console, although that’s annoying too (this is a factor that will come back to haunt me; you’ll see later in the post), but rather, the elongated shape sporting a numeric membrane keypad, a joystick and fire buttons on the sides. It’s not particularly comfortable, and certainly not suited to long play sessions, and it’s a design seen over and over again in early video game consoles. From the Intellivision to ColecoVision to, well, even the APF, manufacturers sure did love to make kids’ hands cramp up! You think you’re such hot biscuits, takin’ on galactic invaders and whatnot? That may be true, but that doesn’t mean there’s not a price to be paid for such a wild, unchecked ego. Playing this for long periods of time could have dire ramifications for yours truly. “Hey man, how’d you get carpal tunnel syndrome? 10 years of blogging?” “Naw bro, it’s from playing my Arcadia 2001 too much!” “Your what?”\n\nI will say this though: with its joystick rather than pad and still-mushy-but-not-AS-mushy fire buttons, I’d give the edge to Arcadia’s product over the Intellivison controller, anyway. Dubious honor? Well sure it is!\n\nOkay, now listen: Arcadia consoles and games tend to be pricey. I had to drop a not-unreasonable-but-still-healthy chunk of change just to get this system. And even then, it took awhile before one showed up with a price that didn’t make me turn to an imaginary camera and shed a single tear like Iron Eyes Cody. (And yet, altogether this was still way cheaper than what I’ve currently spent on getting a working Commodore 64 set up – a set up that, as of this writing, still isn’t optimal but at least I can play Ghostbusters.)\n\nAs for games, some of the rarer titles have asking prices higher than what I paid for this console itself! And while some of the more common games aren’t particularly exorbitant price-wise, very often you’ll still have to drop a decent bit to get some of the (relatively?) better ones. Don’t get me wrong, you might be able to nab an Arcadia cartridge for single digits or low double digits, but those tend to be less exciting titles – and that’s not a very wise usage of your Emerson Arcadia 2001 investment, is it?\n\n(An additional aspect to consider: the risk of buying untested cartridges is higher here because no one had an Arcadia 2001. It’s understandable a reseller isn’t going to have a console on hand to test that random copy of Funky Fish they picked up somewhere. While carts are hearty and durable – of the hundreds and hundreds I’ve owned over the years, I can literally count on one hand the number of games that have refused to work no matter how much I cleaned and/or pouted at them – the fact remains that you’re still goofing around with 40+ year old stuff here.)\n\nThis has been my longwinded way of saying I don’t have a ton of games for this thing. Oh I’ve got a handful that we’re about to look at it, but when it comes to adding titles to this particular collection, I have and will continue to pick my battles wisely. Well, as wisely as possible considering I’m talking about an obscure 1982 video game system. (We call this a first world problem.)\n\nHere’s what we’re about to see: in delightfully alphabetical order, we have Alien Invaders, Cat Trax, Escape, and Space Attack. Those are, uh, what you’re seeing here. Each game was inspired by (read: a rip-off of) a real big time arcade title. What’s aping what? See if you can guess before I reveal the contents to you! See, this is an interactive blog! To get the most out of it, you have to pay attention to whatever stupid thing I happen to be saying at any given moment!\n\nTake note that Alien Invaders is a smaller cartridge while the other three are notably taller. Arcadia games were manufactured in both cartridge styles. Why the size discrepancy? No one knows. In the end it doesn’t really matter, except that the taller carts look slightly silly when plugged into the relatively small Arcadia console.\n\nThese are the only four games I currently have for the Arcadia. Well, technically I have five: I have doubles of one of them. Which one? I’ll never tell.\n\nBefore we go game-by-game here, I just want to make special mention of the instruction sticker on the back of the cartridges. They’re amazing.\n\nThese things are pretty obviously, erm, grammatically problematic. Awkward phrasing is the order of the day here, along with really odd bullet points describing respective “features” of the game. And as you can see here, there can be flat out typos: “Be hurry,” folks! My guess is whoever put this together wasn’t a native English speaker – or at least that’s my hope. But hey, look, it’s “Fun for all the family” – well, I’m sold!\n\nAs fun as these instruction stickers can be to read, they also point to one of the, for lack of a better word, endearing aspects of Arcadia 2001 collecting: that is, the sort of strange, off-kilter feel of the whole thing. This console just wasn’t ready for prime time, but that didn’t stop it from jumping into the coin op-centric arena of early-80s gaming anyway. This may not have been ideal for some kid back in 1982, but in retrospect it’s one of the things that makes this all so, weirdly, appealing.\n\nOkay, let’s play some games! Like my adorable picture above, we’ll go in alphabetical order here. Oh, and while I could have gone through the hassle of getting screenshots up here via a video capture card, the Arcadia features RF output only; this is to be expected of a 1982 console, but the result was that the hassle of getting it hooked up for ‘proper’ screencaps was an annoyance I just wasn’t prepared to undertake. Instead, I turned the lights off and took pictures of the actual Sony Trinitron TV screen playing these games. While there are a few screen abnormalities that you would expect to see when taking pics of a CRT TV in this manner, this still had the dual benefit of 1) mimicking the dark din of an early-80s arcade and 2) keeping my frustration levels lower. Trust me, the latter is more important than the former.\n\nAlien Invaders – If you guessed this was Arcadia’s clone of Space Invaders, you were correct. Granted, this wasn’t exactly a puzzler; no respectable early-80s console would be caught dead without at least one of these. As such, the standard rules of Space Invaders apply: there are rows of marching aliens descending, fire at them with your cannon till they is all dead. Not gonna lie: I like Space Invaders, but only selectively. The arcade original was certainly revolutionary, but I’ve always found it a little too slow and clunky for my tastes; I much prefer the faster, smoother Atari 2600 port, and actually, my favorite version is the Atari 8-bit computer conversion. It added some original elements to the gameplay that not everyone may like, but it’s those very elements that make it more appealingly intense for me.\n\nArcadia’s take on the game doesn’t look bad; the white background doesn’t do it for me, but the sprite are sharp, it plays smoothly enough, and I like the city skyline in the background. Unfortunately, the game is crippled by one big, big flaw: there’s only one wave, and it’s timed. Clear all the aliens, and you’re left picking off motherships continuously until the five minute timer runs out. Man, that was a bad, bad idea; the whole point of these kinda games is to go for the highest score while seeing how many waves you can complete. Implementing a single, timed wave completely destroys those ideals. It may not be bad for a few rounds with a buddy, just seeing who can score the most points, but even then, that aspect is severely limited by the completely needless decision to make the game like this. Alien Invaders is bogus.\n\nCat Trax – In the early-80s, if a game wasn’t a Space Invaders knock-off, there was a good chance it would be a Pac-Man knock-off. That’s an over-generalization for sure, but hey, that’s just my way of saying Cat Trax is an Arcadia dot chompin’ maze game. Was that your guess??? Maybe it’s not fair to call it a rip-off; Crazy Gobbler more fit that particular bill. But like so many other games from that time, it was clearly inspired by the Pac-Guy.\n\nI tend to run hot and cold on maze games. I can get as addicted as anyone to a well-done iteration, but I can just as easily let my eyes glaze over upon playing one that isn’t up to my arbitrary standards. Fortunately, Cat Trax is a goody. In fact, it’s terrific! It doesn’t do anything too different from Pac-Man, but it plays so well that of all the games we’re seeing today, it was the one I was most addicted to.\n\nBasically, you’re a cat running through a maze, eating dots while being chased by three dogs. Occasionally a fish will appear in the middle of the maze; nab it, and your cat will turn into a dog catchin’ truck, which will allow you to chomp (well, catch) the dogs instead of the other way around. Clear all the dots from the maze, and you’ll advance to the next, ostensibly harder round. (Hear that, Alien Invaders?!)\n\nI was a little concerned at first because your cat seems to move kinda slowly, but it’s actually not so bad, and speeds up once you grab the fish besides. I don’t have a lot more to say about this one, because it really is just your standard maze game from the early-80s – but rest assured, it’s a good one!\n\nEscape – Looking at my picture of all these cartridges earlier, you might have been tempted to figure Escape was the token Pac-Man clone. After all, the character used on the artwork looks like a poor man’s Pacs, and the monsters and maze-like images in the background do little to dissuade you from that thinking. As such, you’d be forgiven for not guessing this was actually Arcadia’s take on Berzerk!\n\nActually, my understanding is that this was the Arcadia’s second take on Berzerk; the first was a game called Robot Killer, which is apparently pretty much the same as this one except with graphics that even more closely mimic those of Berzerk. Here, the robots have been replaced by monsters, and there’s a spinning…thing in the middle of the screen that occasionally speeds up and then shoots off in some random direction. But really, this is just Berzerk: run through mazes, fire at enemies, escape to the next screen.\n\nNow I can get down with some Berzerk, but there’s a glaring problem here: man, this game moves S-L-O-W. Simply moving your character across the screen is nothing less than a slog! And to make matters worse, the stiff joystick on the Arcadia controller does you no favors; it’s uncomfortable and makes it easier to die by a mistake on your part than it should be otherwise.\n\nEscape is interesting, and I like the idea behind it, simply because I like Berzerk in general, but yeah, this one is more of a clunker than it should be. Speeding your man up would have made a HUGE difference here.\n\nSpace Attack – Based on the title, you’d probably think this was another Space Invaders clone. Well, kinda sorta; it’s actually a Galaxian clone. I’m gonna tell you straight up: I loves me some Galaxian. If there’s a port of it, I want it. Despite all the reasons I shouldn’t, I even prefer it to its higher-regarded sequel, Galaga. As such, while I won’t go as far as to say this was my killer app for the Arcadia since it took me forever to get a copy (and 3D Bowling was also a big selling point, even though I still haven’t picked that one up), I will say this was my #1 most wanted title for the console for quite awhile. I just had to wait for the right deal to appear! It did, and so here we are.\n\nThe good news: the graphics are sharp and the game moves pretty fast. The aliens look appropriately Galaxian-ish and swoop down accordingly. The programmer implemented a fuel gage that progressively depletes during a round, which was kinda jive but not a deal breaker (it doesn’t totally ruin the game like Alien Invaders); it adds a sense of urgency the game didn’t really need but is okay…I guess.\n\nHere’s the bad news: I fire the game up, it looks sweet, I start hammering on the controller, and nothing really happened. Okay, a quick look reveals that, flying in the face of conventional video game wisdom, Space Attack inexplicably uses the right controller rather than the left like every other sensible game in existence. That’s okay though, I can live with that, the controllers are hard-wired in, remember. So, I grab the right controller, the game starts, my ship is moving from side to side…and not firing. What a time to discover my right controller doesn’t work correctly! Maaaaan, the one game I was anticipating most, and I can’t even really play it! Can the controller be opened and cleaned/fixed? Probably. Am I going to go through the trouble? Naw. It’s really not that big of a deal; it’s not like I was planning on keeping the Arcadia continuously hooked up anyway, and besides, I’ve got plenty of ways to play Galaxian on thousand-year-old consoles if that’s what I’m feeling. Nevertheless, that’s the danger of hard-wired controllers; if something goes bad on one, the solution isn’t always an easy one.\n\nOf course, this wouldn’t be an issue had Arcadia not gotten cute and decided to use the right controller unlike every other game ever. And yet, strangely enough, Space Attack is still more playable than Escape – even though I can’t even really play it!\n\nSee, told you those big ol’ carts sticking out of the console look sorta silly!\n\nDisheartening controller mishap aside, I really am glad I picked Emerson’s Arcadia 2001 up. I’m not really sure what I was expecting with it; I didn’t have super high “imma game all night” hopes for it – I don’t exactly do that even with good consoles. This was more about finally adding a neat, forgotten piece of early-80s gaming to my collection. It’s an era in video games I’m everlastingly fond of anyway, and to have such an arcade-centric-but-not example of it, I just find it…appealing. Considering the prices of consoles and games, not to mention the game selection, if you’re into retro gaming, you probably shouldn’t go for one of these over a 2600. But if you’re a collector, there should be enough to interest you here.\n\nAnd hey, small-ish, derivative library aside, for some kid in 1982/1983, maybe this was all his family could afford. It supposedly debuted cheap, and you have to imagine it didn’t take very long for even that price to begin dropping. For that hypothetical, game-obsessed kid, would any of the Arcadia’s faults even matter? It’s not hard to figure that scenario actually happened somewhere back then, so, I don’t know, this might be a case where the era it came from and what the console represents, even potentially, sorta outweighs what it, you know, is. Or was.\n\nI think I kinda garbled what I was going for at the end of that paragraph, but it’s been 10 years, cut me a little slack already, okay?\n\nLike everyone else, we’re still under pandemic alert here, but the majority of places have reopened, and that means thrift stores. Oh I’ve been making up for lost time with a vengeance alright – albeit with a face mask on and an antisocial social distancing attitude at the ready. (It’d be nice to think that everybody realizes we’re all in this together, but considering I’ve encountered more than one person who just doesn’t seem to “get” it, well, it kinda astounds me. I mean, is it really that important to you to stand only a foot away and incessantly babble about inconsequential nonsense to a perfect stranger? We’re not friends, I don’t know you, lea’ me alone. Though truthfully, I’d feel the same way even if there wasn’t a rampant virus afoot. Oh, do I sound cranky? GOOD.)\n\nAnyway, I’ve brought home a buncha good stuff since being back in action; lotsa new additions to my music library, some great old mugs/glassware for that particular collection, a multitude of miscellaneous items that pique my interest; plenty o’ stuff I’m happy with. BUT, as far as things that I can really get fired up enough to write about here, frankly, not as much as I’d like. Seriously; I came close with a big ol’ bag of early-to-mid-80s erasers that held several cool objet d’art within, but after some preliminary writing, I decided there probably still wasn’t enough to hold the attention of all four of my regular readers. (Though, fun fact, most of that introductory paragraph was ripped from that otherwise-cancelled article.)\n\nI don’t know if the drought has passed, but if nothing else, I was recently given a brief respite as far as blog-worthy material goes, and it’s our subject today. (“Gee, no kidding!”)\n\nBehold! It’s the incredible Wonder Wizard “Television Sports Games” console, released by General Home Products in (according to this site) June of 1976 – a whopping 44 years ago this month! What constitutes “Television Sports Games,” you ask? It’s, uh, Pong. Or rather, “tennis” because non-name brands. But really, it’s Pong. Well, that and some other games that go by the names of other sports but are really just slightly-modified Pongs.\n\nYup, this Wonder Wizard (model number 7702) is one of many, many “Pong clones” that made up the first generation of home video games. No joke; there were a ton of these that eventually saturated the market before developers figured out swappable game cartridges just might lead to a longer lifespan of console sales. (“Yeah, sure, uh huh!”)\n\n(Because I know someone will jump all over me if I don’t specifically point this out, the well-known famous Pong wasn’t really the first Pong, either; there was a ping pong game for the first-ever-console, the Magnavox Odyssey, that Pong was “inspired” by. Nevertheless, it was Pong that really gave a jump start to the video game industry. Also, I’ve now grown tired of typing the word “Pong.”)\n\nI hope you’ll agree that the 1970s aesthetics of the Wonder Wizard are just fantastic. As you can see, woodgrain was the order of the day, and as such, the console evokes its era in a way that practically reaches out and paints a leisure suit on you.\n\nHopefully this side-view pic above gives you an idea of general size of the system. Unlike many of these clones that could be on the small/cheap/etc. side, there’s some real bulk to the Wonder Wizard. Not that it’s heavy; it’s not. But size-wise, it’s decent. Hey, more real estate, more woodgrain! And like said woodgrain, the general design of the shell is very 1970s, and thus very cool. It’s hard to imagine this coming from any other decade!\n\nSo, just where did I find the wonderful Wonder Wizard 7702, you ask? Frankly, I’m hesitant to give up the location because the last thing I need is more competition, but rest assured, it was a thrift store I hit up frequently. And trust me, the Wonder Wizard really pushed the limits of the term “thrift.” That word implies something budget-conscious, and while Wonder Wizard wasn’t (alliteration) prohibitively expensive, it came a little too close for my comfort. I mean, it wasn’t like it was the equivalent of a PS4, and indeed, it cost less than the average brand new PS4 game. Still, for someone who balks at dropping more than $10 per thrift visit, the price tag wasn’t ideal, especially since I had no sure way of knowing if it worked. (More on that issue in a bit.)\n\nAs I approached the electronics section in which Wonder Wizard was residing and it became increasingly obvious that whatever I was looking at was an uber-old console, my first thoughts were of the aforementioned Magnavox Odyssey. Had I been thinking clearly I’d have recalled that the original Odyssey featured wired controllers, but obviously all questions were dispelled once I actually picked the thing up and saw the name.\n\nThough, while I didn’t know it at the time, I actually was in the Odyssey wheelhouse. See if you can follow this, because it can be a little confusing: the original Magnavox Odyssey came out in 1972 and used “game cards” to access different types of games (these weren’t ROM cartridges though; scroll back up to that Wikipedia link for a better description), and that system gave way to a line of dedicated Odyssey consoles in 1975 and which continued for a few years until the Magnavox Odyssey 2 superseded the whole lot of them. As far as the line of dedicated consoles goes though, this Wonder Wizard is internally a Magnavox Odyssey 300, and externally a modified shell of the original Magnavox Odyssey. Well, at least the base is identical; here, let this site tell you more about it.\n\nPut simply, the Wonder Wizard is a re-badged Magnavox Odyssey 300 console. Though truth be told, I think the Wonder Wizard looks much cooler. Check out the Wiki link and compare for yourself! (Also, reading that page on the dedicated console series, MAN did they have a lot of superfluous entries in the line. Minute-at-best modifications would apparently warrant a whole new console release!)\n\nThe Wonder Wizard wasn’t the most feature-heavy Pong clone ever released; there’s really not a whole lot of options at your disposal here. We’ll take a closer look at the games themselves momentarily, but for now, here’s what you get: hand ball, which is tennis played against a solid wall. Tennis, which is just Pong but not really but actually is. And hockey, which is tennis with more paddles and smaller “goalie” areas. (It’s only the sport of hockey in the most rudimentary sense.)\n\nCurious about the difficulty options seen on the right side of the panel here? Why? They’re kinda self-explanatory, aren’t they? Oh alright, I’ll explain: “beginner” is supposedly the easiest setting, with larger paddles and a somewhat slower ball – it plays pretty much how (I guess) people would expect a Pong-type game to play. “Intermediate” shortens the paddles, and “pro” puts the paddles back to their original length but speeds the ball up considerably.\n\nI probably would have changed the labeling of the difficulty settings somewhat, or at least renamed “beginner” to “normal” or something.\n\nThe underside of the Wonder Wizard is pretty barren, with only two things worth noting as far as I’m concerned. (In other words, y’all don’t need a pic of the whole bottom of the console.)\n\nFirst, there’s this label, amazingly still affixed to the beast despite the 40+ years that have elapsed since the original, uh, affixation. See, 7702. Did you think I was lying? I wasn’t. And look; FCC approved!\n\nI don’t really have much more to say about the label (what more can I say?), so I suppose now is as good a time as any to mention that this particular Wonder Wizard wasn’t the only one released by General Home Products. Nope, according to this site, there were several other machines under that name. From the little bit of research I’ve done since acquiring this machine two days ago, it seems like the 7702 gets the most “press” online due to the Magnavox connections – and I assume because it strongly looks like it should be played by someone with oversized lapels – but I’d still say it falls more on the obscure side of the Pong clone spectrum overall. (Though truth be told, beyond Atari and their Sears Telegames rebrands, the Magnavox Odyssey and the Coleco Telstar lines, the vast majority of these Pong systems seem, to me, to fall on the obscure side.)\n\nHere’s the other thing of note on the underside of the console: the battery compartment. Now, the Wonder Wizard 7702 does accept a power adapter, but such things were not included with mine. That’s okay, I’m used to it, and besides, as was common with these Pong clones, the option to use batteries was often (always?) included as an alternative. This was beneficial, because while I could have dug up or otherwise found a replacement adapter, I’m generally leery of such things, having once fried an Atari Jaguar many years back. (The subsequent ‘pop’ and wisp of smoke that arose from the Jag told me I probably did somethin’ bad to it. It was obviously my fault for not being more careful looking at the specs of the machine and the adapter, but hey, live and learn. I wound up getting a ‘good’ Jaguar later down the road anyway.)\n\nSo yes, if I was going to play this thing, it was going to be via six big ol’ size “C” batteries. Unfortunately, the sole issue regarding the condition of the Wonder Wizard – and I was cognizant of this while still at the thrift store – is in regards to that battery compartment. The problem? Look at the top right of this picture, and you’ll see that the plastic around the battery connector (is that what it’s called?) has broken. The connector itself isn’t broken, just the plastic (hey, it is over 40 years old), and as such, I knew there was a strong possibility that I’d have to play Bob Vila and do a little repair work when I got home. Fiddling with some new batteries and the connector later that first night, I did get the unmistakable beeps and boops of Pong to emanate from the system, so I had a good idea that the system worked in some fashion. So the next day (yesterday to you), I opened the whole thing up, used a roll of adhesive (that’s tape to you), and began the process of sturdily taping the connector back in place just enough to make adequate contact with the batteries.\n\nI discovered while having the Wonder Wizard opened that except for the battery compartment, the thing was in exceedingly decent, clean shape. (Same goes for the outside of the unit; it sure appears to have been well taken care of!) Due to the wiring inside, it was tougher to get a decent view and/or my big meaty paws in there than I expected, but eventually I prevailed to the point of “good enough.” Remember, this wasn’t a big time restoration job; the batteries just had to make decent contact.\n\nWe’ll get to the fruits of my labor momentarily, but long story short: I was successful. It was an achievement worthy of me stomping around the neighborhood and hollering “I is MacGyver!” over and over. I didn’t, because that would have drawn the consternation of my neighbors and I generally try to avoid them. But I could have.\n\n(This battery compartment picture was actually taken after all was said and done, and as such you can see some of my expert professional tape job in it. I had it taped into place better than it appears here; I accidentally pushed the thing back out when removing the batteries. “These pics aren’t in sequential order in regards to the story at hand?! Say it ain’t so!” That black tape to the left was there when I got the thing, and I just noticed the relatively minor cracking in the bottom left corner a moment ago. If I ever do much work with this thing again, it’ll be via an actual power adapter, lest I make things worse than they already are.)\n\nThere was one other issue regarding the hooking up of the Wonder Wizard to a TV, and though I didn’t fully quite recognize it as such at first, it was actually a far more pressing issue than the battery compartment. If I didn’t get that thing going, I’d just find an adapter. But if this other issue didn’t work out in my favor, I was in some actual trouble.\n\nThe Wonder Wizard has the RF cable hardwired right into the console, which is all fine and dandy. But, because this was actually made by Magnavox, the Wonder Wizard is subject to the same trappings as the Odysseys, and that could cause issues nowadays.\n\nHow so? Look at this RF plug here; doesn’t look like your usual RF plug, do it? Magnavox used what was, I believe (correct me if I’m wrong), a proprietary format for their Odysseys. That’s to say, unique. In other words, you need the appropriate switch box that matches with this plug before you can connect the thing to your TV. I consider this to be decidedly “whack.”\n\n(Could someone do some splicing/soldering/etc. and make this relatively more compatible, i.e. with a more common set-up? Probably, but I have no such skills, and besides, I’d be worried about messing up my one and only example of the console.)\n\nFortunately, I had just such a switch box, from a Magnavox Odyssey 2000 I got at a different thrift store many many years ago. That 2000 is in somewhat iffy condition so I never even attempted to use it, though coincidentally, that Wiki link says it’s basically an updated Odyssey 300. I just can’t get away from that thing!\n\nThe 2000 has just been floating around my basement since acquiring it, so it’s nice to see that it’s finally earning its keep by providing the original Magnavox switch box for me to use here. And in a pleasant change of pace, I didn’t have to go through a laborious search to unearth it! It was grimy enough to make me wonder if it even still functioned however, providing me with yet another “I ain’t know” in regards to whether I’d ever get the Wonder Wizard displaying on a real TV or not. But, at least I wasn’t completely out of luck. Yet?\n\nSo, everything’s hooked up, and while there was some trial and error and aforementioned battery compartment-fixin’, the results eventually yielded were…\n\n…An earthshaking success! I am the man! I. AM. THE. MAN. Time for a bizarre touchdown dance? Maybe!\n\nRemember my cool 1975 RCA portable TV seen both here and then here? It was the only relatively-accessible TV with the old school screwy RF antenna jack things in my immediate vicinity, so as you can see, out it came. Plus, playing a Pong clone on that TV feels right; the Wonder Wizard displaying on that uber-retro television set, I mean, it just looks cool. The woodgrain of the console, contrasting with the sleek, smooth 1970s-ness of the TV – the old school gaming vibes are strong with this one! Though, I did have to remove the protective face cover on the TV before taking pictures, since it was apparently made of the most reflective substance in the universe and I didn’t need y’all inadvertently seeing the look of utter awe and/or joy on mah face.\n\nLike I said earlier, when messing around with the batteries, I did get sound to emanate from the machine (this is one of those old school consoles in which all sound effects come straight out of the system and not the TV as you’d expect), so something somewhere somehow worked. Nevertheless, it was a moment of sheer exhilaration (or at least relief) to see that the money wasn’t wasted to bring the Wonder Wizard home.\n\n(I would have liked to get some actual screenshots of this console in action for this article, as opposed to mere pictures of it playing on a TV. Now that I think of it, I guess I could have screwed this unique switch box into a common, generic switch box, and then screwed that into the back of a VCR, and then plugged that into the VCR I have connected to my PC. But boy, that sure sounds like an awful lot of work for an article only three people will look at and only half will actually read.)\n\nWhat you’re seeing displayed above is tennis aka Pong aka ping pong aka still tennis. It, uh, acts exactly as you’d expect it to. It’s Pong, what more can I say? I did discover that the paddles are pretty jittery on the Wonder Wizard, so actually playing the thing isn’t really feasible. I fully expected this, such things are very common with these dedicated consoles; cleaning the knobs would solve the issue, should I so desire.\n\nThis here is hockey, or rather what is purported to be hockey. I mean, technically I guess it is. You’ve got your goalies, and, uh, other guys. I have no idea why the right side features three players while the left side only has two; maybe the right side had a power play?\n\nNo matter, cause guess what, CPU? My superior 2020 intellect and advanced game playin’ skillz are about to take you down! Let’s rumble!!!\n\n…Oh wait, the Wonder Wizard is two players only. Yep, in an annoyingly endearing trait of early video games, the option to play by your lonesome is, erm, not an option at all. Don’t have anybody to play with? Guess you’re playing you, then! First one to 15 is the victor! Hey look, I won!\n\nAnd here’s the hand ball variation. Tennis/Pong and hockey may hold more gravitas in comparison, but had the paddles not been so jittery and I felt like browbeating someone into playing with me, I could see this one being potentially pretty fun.\n\nAs it stands though, it’s, uh, hand ball. You slam a ball against the wall and, I guess, hope the other person misses it? Are those the rules? Hey look, I won again! 15 to 1!\n\nThis raises the question though: was there ever a legit Pong variant of Jai Alai? Or, dare I dream it, Bocce Ball? (Those two sports don’t really have anything to do with each other and I’m not very familiar with either one; I’m just writing filler here.)\n\nWhile taking pictures for this article, I thought turning the light off might improve the quality of the shots my phone was taking of the television screen. The difference was negligible, but I did get this really cool pic of the Wonder Wizard illuminated by the light of said screen. it evokes, I don’t know, bell-bottomed kids staying up late into the night playing this wonder of technology or something. “It’s far out, man!” Wait, were people still saying “far out” in our Bicentennial year of ’76?\n\nSo there you have it, the Wonder Wizard Television Sports Games (aka Magnavox Odyssey 300) console. Is it antiquated in both looks and gameplay? Well, yeah, I guess. But you know, I absolutely love the overt 1970s look of the console. And the gameplay? I hate the thinking that just because a game is old or graphically challenged (or another apparently popular one: pre-NES), it can’t possibly be any good. Yes, the game variants here are all primitive to the max, but I can absolutely still see some potential head-to-head fun being had here.\n\nAnd really, this is pure gaming history. Okay, sure, in comparison to other Pong systems it’s probably a relatively minor piece, but nevertheless, the Wonder Wizard is still a part of that de facto first generation of home video games. (You thought the Atari 2600 was first gen? Sorry ace; that and consoles like it are actually second gen.)\n\nIs the Wonder Wizard my new favorite Pong clone console? Well, I’m definitely fond of it (for what it cost, I better be!), and I do indeed collect these consoles in general, but it still doesn’t top my two favorite dedicated consoles from the era: the Coleco Telstar Arcade, which is so (relatively) advanced that calling it a mere “Pong clone” seems like a serious understatement, and Atari’s Video Pinball console, which isn’t even really a Pong system at all.\n\nStill, the Wonder Wizard is neato, man. You know what it sorta recalls to me? Lemme see if I can explain this: due to the look of it, it just seems like something that was bought and played, and then just sorta became ‘part of the scenery.’ Not relegated to the basement or attic exactly, but just sort of there, kind of more like a piece of furniture than something anyone ever really thought of playing by a certain point – especially once more advanced consoles started coming out. Maybe it was dusted and kept clean fairly clean (this example is still in very nice shape), but was paid little attention to otherwise.\n\nDoes that make any sense at all?\n\nI don’t know, maybe I’m putting too much thought into this. Anyway, the Wonder Wizard 7702: it looks neat and cool and strictly of its time, it plays fine (well, except for the jittery paddles), and it’s now part of my collection. What more could a vintage gaming system ask for?\n\nLook, we need to get one thing straight right up front: I’m a Double Dragon fanatic. If there’s a console with an installment of the series found on it, I want it. I don’t claim to own every release for every system and/or handheld, but Double Dragon and its sequels do take up a relatively significant amount of space in my not-inconsiderable video game collection.\n\nThe series should be immediately familiar to anyone that was into video games in the late-1980s and early-1990s; the original 1987 arcade game basically launched the beat-’em-up genre. You know, side-scrolling fighting games in which you fought numerous enemies, typically but not always on a 3-D plane (that is, a foreground and background you can walk between). It was a smash, and naturally sequels followed. The original entries were eventually ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, though they were only ports in a technical sense; they used the same street fighting motif and general plotlines, but basically did their own thing. Nevertheless, Double Dragon and its sequels, particularly those NES conversions, were seemingly ever-present on the video game scene of the early-1990s, which was when *I* was coming into my own as a young gamer.\n\nDespite popularizing the beat-’em-up genre (though it wasn’t the first such game), looking back, it’s a little surprising how quickly Double Dragon‘s style of walking around and beating up bad guys was superseded by following games in the genre, and not just graphically, either. Only four levels (called “Missions”) and a relatively low number of enemies quickly appeared quaint when compared to longer, all-out fighting extravaganzas like Capcom’s Final Fight some two years later – a template beat-’em-ups largely followed in the early-1990s before the whole idea of a “fightin’ game” was steadily replaced by Street Fighter II and the like.\n\nActually, despite being wildly unfaithful to the arcade source material, the NES Double Dragon games probably hold up better than other versions nowadays simply because they lengthened and/or added original elements to the ports – additions that help them stand up against the subsequent, more-advanced games in the same genre.\n\nStill, taken on its own, the original Double Dragon (and at least the first sequel, Double Dragon II: The Revenge) remains a lot of fun today. Aside from some ugly slowdown when too many sprites are onscreen, it’s a fantastic beat-’em-up, though those accustomed to Streets of Rage and such may have a tough time getting into it. Nevertheless, for its time Double Dragon was quite the trendsetter. I mean, simultaneous two-player street fighting action, all in an effort to rescue a kidnapped girlfriend? A bevy of combat moves you could pull off? Colorful, detailed stages to traverse? A variety of enemies to pummel? Of course people would continuously throw quarters at it!\n\n(Even if the period of revolutionary success was relatively short-lived, Double Dragon continued to be a name draw well into the 1990s, eventually spawning, besides the sequels proper, a Battletoads spin-off, a couple one-on-one fighters, an inexplicable board game, those ever-present Tiger handhelds, an animated TV series, and a terrible live-action movie that I, thankfully, only have limited experience with. The brand’s “oomph” sort of tapered off as the second half of the 1990s dawned, but there’s no denying how recognizable the franchise was in the years immediately preceding. A good deal of this popularity can probably be attributed to the series as it appeared on the NES, such was the visibility of both them and it at the time.)\n\nIt was also in this late-1980s setting that the 8-bit console wars came about. Perhaps calling it a “war” is a bit of a misnomer since, in the U.S. anyway, it was all about the NES. Seemingly every kid had Nintendo, and growing up, I initially wasn’t aware there even were other 8-bit consoles beyond it. I mean, sure, there were the home computers, but to me, it was basically those and the NES. In actuality, there were three viable 8-bit consoles at the time: besides the NES, there was the Sega Master System, and then there was the Atari 7800. Neither did much comparatively in the States, though the SMS was a force to be reckoned with in much of the rest of the world. (No kidding, the European and Brazilian SMS scene was, and is, fascinating!)\n\nThe 7800 was an interesting case; initially intended to right the wrongs that the Atari 5200 had ostensibly committed, the 7800 was meant to come out in 1984, restore Atari’s good name and blow the competition (namely the ColecoVision) out of the water. It was a pretty powerful system for the time, with terrific graphics, a sleek design, and the ability to play Atari 2600 games without an adapter right out of the box.\n\nIt didn’t quite work out as planned though. There was a brief test market in ’84, but the combined effects of the infamous early-1980s video game crash and the sale of Atari Inc. from Time Warner to Jack Tramiel put a halt on an immediate wide release. In the aftermath, Atari Inc. became Atari Corp., and the 7800 was placed on the back burner until 1986. The 7800 was still a capable console with an enormous amount of potential, but with a library of older titles and a somewhat-damaged reputation to the name “Atari,” not to mention constant cost-cutting measures regarding new titles and peripherals, well, it was an uphill battle against the Super Mario juggernaut that the NES became as the 1980s wore on. The added competition of the Sega Master System didn’t help matters, either.\n\nEven though the NES, SMS and 7800 were all originally developed around the same 1983/1984 time frame, and all eventually wide released in the U.S. in 1986, due to the specific circumstances surrounding the 7800’s debut and subsequent library, it feels like a console caught between two eras of gaming. To me, it’s like a system from both the early/mid-80s and the late-80s, if that makes any sense. ‘Course, that’s one of the reasons I love it so much; no joke, the Atari 7800 is absolutely in my personal top five favorite consoles.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to 1989. Gaming consoles are again big business, revolutionary titles are coming out left and right, and Double Dragon has already swept not only the arcades but also the NES and SMS. It was in this climate that the Atari 7800 port of Double Dragon, released by Activision, arrived.\n\nThis was amazing for a few reasons. 1) Nintendo’s licensing agreements with software developers meant that it was hard, often impossible, for the same games to come out on more than just the NES. Thanks to legal loopholes however, there were exceptions, and several titles well-known as members of the NES stable also appeared on competing consoles. 2) The 7800 was great at playing classic arcade ports such Asteroids, Centipede, Joust and Ms. Pac-Man, and had it been released in 1984 as intended, the matter would have been less egregious. But by the late-1980s, new names were needed, and the 7800 was woefully lacking in that area. Rampage, Ikari Warriors, Commando and Xenophobe were welcome exceptions, but that’s just what they were, exceptions.\n\n(The issue of original games was another sticking point with the 7800, something Atari only seemed to truly realize within the last few years of the console’s life. By then it was far too late to save it, but we did get the Super Mario Bros.-ish platformer Scrapyard Dog, the intensely-quirky Ninja Golf, and what just may be the best game on the entire system, The Legend of Zelda-esque Midnight Mutants, starring Al “Grampa Munster” Lewis himself!)\n\nThe current homebrew scene has expanded the 7800’s library considerably, but where the original run is concerned, there were less than 60 titles released, and while many of them were/are pretty good, there were few that would have truly raised eyebrows in that late-80s/early-90s video gaming climate.\n\nEnter 1989’s Double Dragon. Simply put, this was the exact type of game the 7800 needed. A modern arcade port, and a hot one at that. The 1988 home version on the NES was a massive hit, and 1989 was also the year a (very loose) port of the sequel arrived for the ol’ toaster. Furthermore, the SMS version of Double Dragon was also an extremely popular title, one which some would say was even better than the NES’.\n\nSo yes, in a library that initially only consisted of 59 games (two of which weren’t even released in the United States), Double Dragon stood, and stands, out big time. They came close, but Commando, Rampage, Ikari Warriors and Xenophobe, while more current than most of the 7800’s offerings, and with some late-80s coin-op clout to boot, just didn’t share quite the same name recognition that Double Dragon had. Could any of them touch Double Dragon as far as popularity went? Thanks mainly to the wildly successful NES port, I’d say “no.” Indeed, this release marked the only time that 7800 owners could truly partake in the same then-modern gaming experience as NES owners could. Some of the same games showed up on both systems, but Double Dragon was one of the gaming properties of the late-1980s, in both the arcades and at home. For once, 7800 owners could bask in the same glow as NES (and SMS) owners!\n\n(A cool example of this “phenomenon”: I have a comic book buried in my collection from either 1989 or 1990 – I can’t remember which year for sure – and when it comes to the advertisements found throughout the issue, not only is this 7800 game pitched, but so is the NES original and sequel! I’m going to guess that sort of thing didn’t happen very often!)\n\nDouble Dragon was a Technos Japan innovation, with the NES port released by Tradewest (in the U.S.) and the SMS’ by Sega themselves. Activision, they of River Raid and Pitfall! fame, were still riding the Atari bandwagon in the late-1980s, one of the few third parties to continue do so, and it was they that put out our game on both the Atari 7800 and still-breathing 2600. That’s right, there’s an Atari 2600 port of Double Dragon, too! Given the mega-primitive hardware and one-button limitation of the joystick, it’s actually a pretty impressive piece of programming, featuring some terrific graphics and sound given the console it’s on. It’s not the most playable version of Double Dragon ever released, the difficulty is too high and there are too many moves mapped to the single fire button, but it is recognizable as Double Dragon, and that in and of itself is amazing.\n\nThe cart you’re seeing here is, obviously, the 7800 version. The 2600 version looks very similar, with the same plain layout except the colors are reversed (white-on-black instead of black-on-white), and naturally with “for the…” altered accordingly. Considering the 7800 library is littered with dull, black & white cartridge artwork, it’s too bad a more-striking label didn’t show up, but beggars can’t be choosers – I mean, at least the 7800 got Double Dragon!\n\n(Remember, this is an article from a North American perspective; label art and the like varied in other countries.)\n\nUpon powering up the cartridge, you’re presented with the pleasant surprise that the 7800 received the most arcade-faithful port of all three 8-bit consoles. Indeed, at points it almost looks like someone took the arcade game and “7800-ized” it.\n\nSomething is evident on the title screen that’s very, very important. Look down at the bottom of the screen and see what it says: 1 or 2 players.\n\n“Yeah, okay, so what North Video guy? Everyone knows Double Dragon is a two-player game!”\n\nWell sure it is…in the arcade and on most of the home editions. There was one home edition, however, that inexplicably made it two-players alternating: the NES port. Yes, in what was perhaps the most visible version of the game out there, the biggest feature of the original coin-op, the meaning of the very title itself, was stripped out! The NES port, for all the tampering with the levels and moves it featured (more on both of those in a bit), was magnificently playable. But, there’s no doubt that removing the ability to simultaneously beat down thugs with a buddy absolutely destroyed some of the magic that made the game so popular in the first place.\n\nWell, that simultaneous two-player action is indeed present here on the Atari 7800!\n\nThe arcade-accuracy continues into the game proper. Even the (in)famous intro, in which your girlfriend is slugged in the stomach and carried away is here – a shocking and wildly uncomfortable bit of violence that I can’t believe flew even back then.\n\nThat short sequence upon the start of a new game is about all the exposition you’re going to get, because there’s really no in-game plot to speak of. Not that you necessarily need one; saving a damsel-in-distress wasn’t exactly a new innovation in video game plots by the late-1980s, but it provides sufficient motivation for fisticuffs, methinks.\n\nThe plot was expanded upon in supplementary materials, sometimes exponentially so; Japanese releases place the setting at some point in the then-near future, after a nuclear war has devastated the population and caused gang warfare to rise. I don’t like this explanation at all; it adds an added layer of science fiction to the proceedings that, in my opinion, the game just doesn’t need. U.S. story lines were more straightforward in their telling, with a much simpler tale of a rampant street gang, the two brothers that oppose them, and the kidnapping of a girlfriend by said street gang. That’s all you need; background is nice, but it’s not something generally required in a game of this nature.\n\nThe gist of the plot, in both Japan and the U.S., is this: The Black Warriors (the bad guys) have taken over the city, and are opposed by relatively few, save for the twin brothers of Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee (the good guys), who are quite proficient in the martial arts. In order to lure them on to their turf and take them out once and for all, The Black Warriors kidnap Billy Lee’s girlfriend Marian. This is unacceptable, and so Billy (and his brother Jimmy as the second-player) set out to beat down some thugs and rescue her.\n\nTo get to Marian, the titular characters must traverse four environments: the city slum, the industrial area, the woods, and finally, the enemy base.\n\nThese level layouts in 7800 Double Dragon are far closer to the arcade than either the SMS or especially the NES. The SMS mostly followed the stages found in the coin-op (and included simultaneous two-player action as well), though it diverged in a few spots. The NES port was all over the place, with levels that typically started out somewhat faithful to the coin-op and then just went nuts. Platform elements, a trip up a construction site, into some caves, and so on and so forth. It was fun, and it actually did work, but it wasn’t exactly arcade-accurate. Though as I said earlier, the additions served to lengthen the game and make it more suitable for an at-home experience, which means it has held up better in the long run (the same thing applies to the versions of Double Dragon II and Double Dragon III on the console, as well).\n\nIn the 7800’s case however, what you saw in the arcade was by and large ported over to the Atari, and there’s something to be said for faithfulness to the source material. Unfortunately, Double Dragon wasn’t an especially long game as a coin-op, and that carried over here, too.\n\nBy the way, if you’re totally bored, you may be asking yourself “hey, where’d y’all get these swell in-game screenshots, North Video Guy?” The answer to that is: I took them myself, with an actual 7800 console, cart and CRT TV. Y’see, I don’t emulate, so if these screenshots lack somewhat in the sharpness department, and I know that they do, that’s thanks to the good ol’ RF signal; no, the 7800 I used hasn’t been modded for AV output. Honestly, I actually think this gives a more accurate picture of how the game is meant to be displayed, closer to how kids playing it upon release first saw it. The harsh sharpness of emulation actually makes the game look uglier than it needs to.\n\nAnd while on that subject, let’s talk about the graphics proper. 7800 Double Dragon isn’t a bad looking game as a whole, but it is a mixed bag.\n\nThe arcade-faithful backgrounds generally look pretty nice. The first two stages have sort of a drab color-scheme, but the detail is excellent and the layout is just like the coin-op. The third and fourth levels are terrific, with a richly-detailed forest in the third and foreboding enemy fortress (complete with deadly spike pit) in the fourth. Modern day homebrew games aside, the graphical-detail in the latter stages of Double Dragon are some of the best graphics seen on the 7800.\n\nAs for the sprites in the game, well, they’re another story. Simply put, for the most part they look like something the Atari 5200, a full console generation before (and with hardware even older than that), could have pulled off. They’re awfully blocky, and with a minimal amount of detail. Except for Abobo (the big, hulking enemy that has become one of the most popular faces of Double Dragon), the characters don’t really look very good. It’s quite a contrast with the backgrounds!\n\nThey may not all look great, but did everyone from the arcade original at least make it over to the 7800? Yes and no. Billy and Jimmy are here, using the same, palette-swapped sprite. The same goes for common thugs Williams and Roper, and 2nd level boss Jeff; they all use the same sprite as Billy and Jimmy, just with different colors. Female thug Linda is here too, but shares the same image as the kidnapped Marian. Head bad guy Big Boss Willy obviously gets his own design, as naturally does Abobo. (Technically, there was Abobo and Bolo in the arcade, both nearly identical save for a few differences, but c’mon, it’s always just been Abobo to the layman).\n\nSo yeah, everyone’s here technically, but not without some caveats.\n\nAs mentioned, the NES version is one-player only, and can display two enemies at a time, albeit with some graphical break-up. The SMS has two-players simultaneously and up to three enemies, but there’s a lot of flicker throughout. With the 7800 however, one of the strengths built into the system from the get-go was the ability to move a lot of sprites at the same time, without flicker or slowdown.\n\nThis ability is readily apparent in Double Dragon. The game can have up to four bad guys onscreen, plus your one or two players. No graphical break-up, no flicker, and no slowdown either, except for some choppy scrolling when moving to a new screen. This version plays a bit more sluggish as a whole, but it’s not a deal breaker, and the relatively slower, more-deliberate pace of the game actually serves it well.\n\nWhile on the subject of sprites, one thing about the original coin-op that wore real thin, real fast was its tendency to slow down when the screen became crowded. Yep, the more sprites there were at a given moment, the more the action crawled. Honestly, if you’re able to get beyond the relatively-archaic nature of the proceedings (early beat-’em-up and all), that’s really the only downside to what is otherwise still a terrific game.\n\nThe slowdown in the original coin-op often made the use of weapons more of a chore than a pleasure, which is a shame, because the ability to grab a new beat-down implement was another one of the revolutionary aspects of the game. You never saw Thomas appropriate one of those knives from a mindless grunt in Kung-Fu Master, after all!\n\nThe arcade featured bats, whips, knives, boulders, barrels, boxes and dynamite, all of which your character could pick up and use in his quest for kidnapped-girlfriend-vengeance. (And of course, they could always be taken from you, as well.) Only the bats, whips and knives made it to the 7800 port. In contrast to the later Streets of Rage, in which a knife could be used repeatedly or thrown at once, in Double Dragon it was always a one-throw deal. The bat and whips can be used repeatedly, though unlike the arcade, they eventually disappear when moving from one section of a level to another (common for home console conversions of the period).\n\nAh, but it was the attacks, the various combos you could pull off, that really sets Double Dragon apart from other side-scrolling fighters. Not set, sets. Later beat-’em-ups simplified the amount of attacks, sometimes with only a jump and punch button, maybe a special move. Double Dragon was considerably more involved, with a style of game play that more-closely resembled actual martial arts street fighting (I assume; so rarely do I get out to street fight). From the three buttons and joystick, you could pull off punches, kicks, jump kicks, reverse jump kicks, headbutts, elbow smashes, over-the-shoulder throws, the ability to repeatedly knee an enemy in the face, and with a buddy, one player could even grapple a baddie while the other slugged him (which worked the other way around, too). Amazingly, with all of these options at your disposal and relatively few buttons, it worked really, really well.\n\nWith only two attack buttons generally available, obviously all these moves didn’t always make it to the home versions intact. The NES port fared better than most; even though you had to continuously “level-up” to earn more of them, in some odd form of RPG-ness, you could amass an impressive range of attacks, including the ability to sit on an enemy and punch them relentlessly in the face. This wasn’t found in the coin-op, but rather in Technos’ prior beat-’em-up Renegade, which was Double Dragon‘s spiritual predecessor in more ways than one.\n\nThe SMS version retained a good number of the attacks, though for me, only the punches, kicks, jump kicks and headbutts were consistently easy to pull off. (You can elbow smash and knee-in-the-face, but I could only ever trigger those attacks by mistake!)\n\nThe 7800 actually fared pretty well in the translation. The knee-in-the-face and over-the-shoulder-throw options were, disappointingly, excised. (So is the grapple technique, though no home version got that, as far as I know.) But, along with the obvious abilities to punch, kick and jump kick, the reverse jump kick, headbutt, and elbow smash all made it in. Some of the button combos to make these moves happen are a little strange (down + punch to headbutt? What was wrong with double-tapping left or right like the arcade, NES and SMS?), but mostly this all works okay.\n\nHowever, we now come to the biggest problem with the Atari 7800 version of Double Dragon, and it’s something that’s not even the game’s fault: the painful stock U.S. 7800 controller. Here in the States, we got the “ProLine Joystick,” and from start to finish, it was pretty much a holdover from the early-1980s era of controller-design. Basically an elongated grip with a joystick at the top and a fire button on each side (think ColecoVision or Atari 5200), it was a controller not suited to long sessions of any game, never mind one that requires constant movement and button-pressing like Double Dragon.\n\nOverseas, Europeans got the “ProLine Joypad,” and it’s a far, far superior controller. Basically Atari’s answer to the NES control pad, it’s a continual mystery why it never replaced the joystick here in the U.S. It’s not perfect, but considering the alternative, it’s definitely preferable, and it makes all the difference in the world when it comes to Double Dragon.\n\nY’see, this game has gotten a reputation for being overly difficult, and in many eyes, not very good. Hey, I’ve been on that side of the fence a time or two in the past, too. When I first got the 7800 port many years ago, I was by no means a novice at Double Dragon. And yet, I could barely make any headway before exhausting all my lives (you get three to start, an extra at 50,000 points, and no continues). I was probably convinced it was either the hardest or most poorly-programmed port 8-bit console port there was.\n\nFast forward several years, when I decided to get myself some of the European Joypads. After all, I loved the 7800, so why not, you know, fully enjoy it? 2600, or even Sega Genesis, controllers were fine for single-button games, but some of the best 7800 titles, like Commando or our subject today, require two. And what a revelation! A whole new appreciation for the 7800 port of Double Dragon was gained, all because I could finally properly play it! Go figure!\n\nI think 7800 Double Dragon gets a bad rap as far as difficulty is concerned. Don’t get me wrong, it’s on the challenging side; the enemies can hound you and get some cheap shots in. But, it’s really not any more difficult than any other 8-bit conversion, and in fact is probably easier as a whole than the NES port, where you can save all of your lives only to blaze through them in a hurry on the last level.\n\nThe controller, I think, is one of the issues with that difficulty perception. Seriously, get the European Joypads. Do what you gotta do to play Double Dragon comfortably, because it ain’t gonna happen using the regular ProLine Joystick. I can beat the game using it, but it’s not exactly an ergonomic experience.\n\nThe controller used isn’t the game’s fault, but another key to enjoying the beat-down frenzy is: the punch. There’s a very simple method to avoiding frustration with this game, and it’s this: just don’t punch. I know that sounds weird, but hear me out. When animating the attacks, the punch is given a “wind up.” It isn’t instant contact. As such, there’s a moment of hesitation, and this leaves you open to hits. In other words, you end up taking taking cheap shots and trading blows back and forth.\n\nSome players like to spam the elbow smash (just like the arcade!) and jump kicks here, but in my experience, you don’t necessarily need to do that. When using a normal, ground-based attack, just stick with regular kicking. There’s no animation between the button press and the result, so it’s ‘instant,’ and as such, you can hammer away at baddies without taking too many unnecessary hits back.\n\nOn top of that, the enemy A.I. is painfully stupid. Yes, they can be tough, but once you learn their patterns, you can counter them pretty easily. Same goes for most beat-’em-ups, I know, but especially here. Much like the NES version, if you get in ‘close’ to an enemy, especially when coming in from underneath, you should be able to knock them down and eventually out while saving most of your life bar. As such, even the Abobos and Big Boss Willy, traditionally the toughest enemies, can be defeated without too much trouble.\n\nSo no, 7800 Double Dragon isn’t too hard. If anything, it might be a little too easy. You just gotta learn the tricks!\n\nLastly, we come to the music of 7800 Double Dragon. One of the most celebrated aspects of the game, in both its original incarnation and in most of the ports, was the soundtrack. Double Dragon featured an absolute classic score, one that not only fit the scenes you were traversing but also absolutely got you in the mood to beat down some street punks. On the 7800, we got…some of that.\n\nY’see, the system was originally intended to include a POKEY sound chip, which would have given it the sound quality of the Atari 8-bit computers and 5200, which was pretty good. When it was eventually released however, the POKEY was omitted as a cost-saving measure. The chip could be added to individual carts, though sadly, this was only utilized twice, for Commando and Ballblazer. Both have terrific music, but aside from those exceptions, the 7800 generally features sound identical to what the 2600 could pull off.\n\nNow, it’s beyond old news to rag on the 7800’s sound quality. Compared to the NES and SMS, it sounds particularly bad, we know. It is what it is. It’s funny, I don’t even mind the sound of the 2600, but when it’s paired with the superior visuals of the 7800, well, it just kinda throws you for a loop.\n\nThat said, Double Dragon really should have utilized a POKEY sound chip. The soundtrack was so phenomenal that it absolutely, without a doubt deserved the honor. But, it didn’t. As such, we’re left with an incomplete, slightly-shrill score. Two of the mission tunes were omitted completely, meaning there’s some repetition involved. What is included is the famous title-screen track, Mission One’s theme, Mission Three’s theme (in the arcade, anyway), and the boss encounter music, plus the level-ending jingle. You’ll hear the first and third level themes repeated throughout, and not always where they should be.\n\nIncomplete though it may be, at the very least, the music is recognizably Double Dragon.\n\nSo when it comes right down to it, how does the Atari 7800 port of Double Dragon hold up? Better than it doesn’t. The music is a disappointment, and if you’re in the U.S., odds are you’ll have to contend with finding a better controller. Get over those obstacles however, and you’re treated with what I feel is one of the best games in the Atari 7800 library.\n\nTrue, it lacks the length and extra features of the famous Nintendo Entertainment Version, but it makes up for that with the arcade-accuracy and simultaneous two-player action. And, while the graphics and sound are markedly inferior, I actually prefer this port over that of the Sega Master System, based solely on the gameplay. The SMS version, don’t get me wrong, I like it, but the control has always seemed too loose for my tastes; you’re basically out there swinging fists wildly – there’s no finesse, in my opinion. The 7800 version runs a bit slower, but you can really get into a groove while playing thanks to that.\n\nPerhaps more importantly than how it stacks up against the rival 8-bit ports is what this Double Dragon represents. Think of it; you’re a kid in the late-1980s, you have an Atari 7800, while most everyone else has an NES. Maybe a few of your friends have an SMS. Now sure, there’s plenty of great classic arcade ports at your disposal, and the 2600 library, but that stuff isn’t what’s burning up the video game world at the moment. Games have evolved, become more complex, bigger worlds, better graphics.\n\nAll of sudden, here comes Double Dragon, the arcade smash, the game that’s tearing up both the NES and SMS. And now it’s available for the 7800! The series would continue to expand via sequels, spin-offs, and so on and so forth, but for this one occasion, 7800 owners could boast the same hot game as NES and SMS owners could. Not that Double Dragon was the only shared title across the three; Rampage hit all of them as well. But, Double Dragon was a trendsetting name brand that, as I’ve said, was incredibly recognizable in the late-1980s and early-1990s. It showing up on the 7800 seems special to me in a way that, frankly, Rampage doesn’t. That’s just my perception, though.\n\nFurthermore, the beat-’em-up was a genre sorely lacking on the 7800. Kung-Fu Master was fun, but simplistic and old hat by the time it came out on the system in ’89. Ninja Golf and Basketbrawl were quirky Atari originals that combined sports with fighting. And Karateka? Well, we don’t talk about Karateka. None of them could attain quite the same level that Double Dragon achieved – and achieves.\n\nDouble Dragon was something special in the Atari 7800 library, and even if it wasn’t a perfect game, that’s still to be celebrated. Even today!\n\nSometimes I have a problem where I’ve got more than enough stuff that I could write about, but, frankly, can’t really decide on any one subject. Su"
