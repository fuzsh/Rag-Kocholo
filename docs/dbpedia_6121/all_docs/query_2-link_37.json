        "text": "Ready to level up your computing knowledge? Building your own PC will help you understand how every component works and gives you the ability to customize your system for a perfect fit.\n\nWhile it’s certainly more complicated than experienced builders might tell you, if you plan carefully, read the manuals, and take your time, the reward isn’t just a new computer, it’s a new set of useful skills.\n\nWithout knowing the specifics of your build, we can’t tell you exactly how to build your new machine. What we can do is help set you up for success with planning resources, component buying tips, and valuable info about each step of the process.\n\nOnce you’ve built your shiny, new PC, it might be time to check out some other stuff to further accessorize your new partner in crime. Be sure to have a look at our guides for the Best Gaming Keyboards, Best Gaming Mice, Best Gaming Headsets, and Best Gaming Controllers.\n\nUpdated August 2024: We've expanded the details of some steps, added information on new advancements, and updated some of our recommendations.\n\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get WIRED for just $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access to WIRED.com, full Gear coverage, and subscriber-only newsletters. Subscriptions help fund the work we do every day.\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more.\n\nStart With a Plan\n\nThe worldwide chip shortage hit PC builders hard over the past few years, but component prices have begun to fall back to normal thanks to a variety of economic and technological factors. Still, we recommend shopping around a bit before buying anything, as prices fluctuate regularly.\n\nWhen you're shopping for components, make sure you're buying from a reputable vendor, like Amazon, Best Buy, or NewEgg, and make sure to check their return policies before you do. When parts arrive, make sure to physically inspect them for any damage or missing pieces, and check the labels on the parts themselves to make sure they match up with the packaging, as well as what you ordered.\n\nBefore you start, make sure you have a clear idea of your budget in mind. Building a PC can be expensive, and it’s easy to miss some costs if you don’t track everything carefully. No matter what your experience level is, you should start with PCPartPicker. Using this unique tool, you can easily plan out your build, select compatible parts, and check pricing and availability across retailers.\n\nAlso consider the goals for your new computer. Is it just for checking email and printing out occasional documents? Do you plan on playing any video games? Will the computer sit on or under a desk? Asking these questions early can help guide your planning and keep your budget on track.\n\nIf you’re feeling confident, the website Logical Increments lists example builds at different price and performance points. These common parts can act as a starting point for your build or help offer options to upgrade or downgrade to meet your budget and needs.\n\nWhat Do You Need?\n\nWhether you’re building for home office or gaming, the components you need are going to be generally the same. For the purposes of this guide you're going to see a lot of abbreviations, so let this section act as your glossary.\n\nAlmost every computer needs, at the very least, the following components:\n\nCase\n\nMotherboard\n\nCentral Processing Unit (CPU)\n\nMemory (RAM)\n\nStorage (Typically a Solid State Drive or SSD)\n\nPower Supply (PSU)\n\nIf you plan on gaming, you’ll also want to invest in a dedicated graphics card, or GPU. This extra component adds a substantial cost to your build but allows you to play video games, as well as supporting video editing, photo editing, and machine learning workloads.\n\nYou should consider a monitor in your budget, if you don’t have one already. These can range from basic options for everyday productivity to massive, ultrawide monitors with gaming-focused features and prices to match. Our monitor buying guide should give you a better idea of the best options for you.\n\nYou’ll also want a keyboard and mouse to control the system, which, like monitors, have a surprising range of functionality and aesthetics. Leave room in your budget for these, anywhere from $50 for a basic set to $200 or more at the high end.\n\nChoosing a Case\n\nFirst, consider the physical size of the case and where the computer will live. If it has to fit on a shelf, or you have limited space on your desk, those constraints should come first. You’ll want to leave some room both in front of and behind your PC for proper airflow, and make sure it’s sitting on a hard, flat surface.\n\nMotherboards come in a couple of flavors, but the most important thing to know is what kind of socket it has. There are basically two: LGA and AM. You'll always see them listed with a number after them, like “LGA1150” or “AM5.” The exact numbers after the LGA and AM portions of these socket names will change over time, to indicate which generation of Intel or AMD chips they support, but the standards as of 2024 (which will work with the latest chips from either maker) are LGA1700 for Intel and AM5 for AMD.\n\nMotherboards also come in a couple of sizes, the most common being ATX. That’s what I generally recommend, especially if this is your first build. More room inside the case means more room for your hands, which will make setup, upgrading, and maintenance easier. Your PC case will list which size motherboard it supports, so make sure they match up.\n\nBuying advice: What separates a fancy motherboard from a cheap motherboard? It tends to be a combination of three elements: advanced feature set, connectivity, and performance. These are generally indicated by the motherboard’s chipset, a code which can quickly tell advanced users basic information about the maximum memory, connectivity, and overclocking potential.\n\nThe question, though, is whether you need those extra features. Your chipset can limit the number of memory slots you have access to, which may prevent upgrades down the line. When it comes to storage drives, two M.2 slots are plenty; any more than that is kind of a luxury. The final thought is overclocking, which is available to users on the highest-end boards and requires specialized knowledge and careful stability testing to prevent damage.\n\nThis list has motherboards of varying prices, but there are way more than we can ever test and cover for you. If you see one you like, write down its specs and compare it to others to find a good fit for your budget and your vibe. We try to keep this list updated regularly with prices that aren't too much higher than MSRP, but if any of the prices here skyrocket between updates, shop around.\n\nSuggested Hardware\n\nGigabyte B650 Gaming X AX (AM5 Socket): This motherboard has a few extra ports (including Thunderbolt 3) you'll appreciate if you're building a mid to high-end gaming PC on an AMD processor.\n\nGigabyte A620M Gaming X (AM5 Socket) Micro-ATX: This one is a Micro-ATX-sized motherboard, so it's for smaller builds, but it's a great pick if you're working on an adorable little mini gaming rig.\n\nAsus Prime B760-Plus D4 (LGA 1700 Socket): This Asus board is great for a midrange gaming PC, and for the price it has quite a few (four) M.2 Ports.\n\nGigabyte Z790 Gaming X AX (LGA 1700 Socket): This is a high-performance motherboard for gaming machines. If you're picking up a 12th- or 13th-generation Intel processor, this is our recommendation.\n\nProcessor (CPU)\n\nThe brain of your computer, the processor sockets directly into the motherboard and manages basically everything your computer does. This will be the most important component for determining non-gaming performance, and likely the first or second most expensive individual item in your budget. You’ll want to make sure the socket on your CPU matches the socket on your motherboard.\n\nThe two major manufacturers right now are AMD and Nvidia. But rather than buy a GPU directly from them, they sell the processors to board partners like EVGA, Asus, and MSI, who then turn them into graphics cards. Whether you choose AMD or Nvidia will likely depend on where you can get a better deal, so make sure to keep an eye out for deals, rebates, and even free games with GPUs.\n\nBuying advice: Even though they're more available than they have been in years, graphics cards are among the most in-demand PC components, and their prices still swing a bit higher than MSRP at times. The picks on this list are generally mid- to high-end. In my opinion, it's better to put the bulk of your budget toward a graphics card. The more you spend now, the longer it's going to last—like buying a $100 pair of shoes that lasts you years instead of a $20 pair that falls apart after a few months. Cheap graphics cards are penny-wise but dollar-foolish for gaming PCs. For a regular old home-office PC, you can probably get away with your CPU’s built-in graphics.\n\nSuggested Nvidia GeForce Hardware\n\nNvidia's latest generation of graphics cards is the GeForce RTX 40-series, but there aren't any on this list. As of this writing, they are still extremely expensive, and the 30-series is a better value for performance.\n\nMSI GeForce RTX 2060: If you're looking to get into medium-end gaming, this card strikes a good balance between power and price. Also a great pick for an office computer that will do some video editing or some light gaming.\n\nAsus ROG Strix RTX 3060: Nvidia’s RTX 3060 is a killer 1080p and 1440p gaming graphics card.\n\nZotac GeForce RTX 3080: This is still one of the top-performing graphics cards, even if you're running games at 4K with ray-tracing on. Add that it's under $1,000, and it's very appealing.\n\nSuggested AMD Radeon Hardware\n\nThe latest generation of Radeon graphics cards is the 7000-series, and that's great news for anyone looking to buy a top-end graphics card but even better news for anyone looking to buy a previous-generation model and get a little discount.\n\nPowerColor Red Devil AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX: If you're looking for an absolute monster of a graphics card, this is the way to go. This thing is unbelievably powerful and lightning quick, and it makes short work of even the latest games at their tippy-top, ultra-max settings at 4K. You know it's good because of all the X’s.\n\nSapphire Pulse AMD Radeon RX 6600: The RX 6600 is a really solid pick for 1080p gaming on an AMD chip.\n\nPowerColor Red Dragon AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT: If you want to snag a powerful GPU at a discount, the previous generation’s RX 6800 XT is my top choice right now. It's a beast of a GPU that can handle anything you throw at it, even Cyberpunk 2077 at full 4K resolution.\n\nStorage\n\nEvery system needs storage, and how much will depend once again on what you plan to use the system for. We recommend at least 256 GB of storage for any system, even for light home use. If you’re gaming, you may find it beneficial to install your OS to a 256-GB main drive, then add a second 1-TB or larger drive for your games and media.\n\nWith that in mind, we recommend sticking with one of a few major manufacturers for your power supply needs. Those include Cooler Master, Corsair, EVGA, and NZXT, all of which have produced excellent power supplies and responded quickly to issues.\n\nIf you’re using PCPartPicker, it will recommend a wattage based on your selected parts. If your wattage is too low, the system will shut off randomly or not start at all. At the other end, the PSU won’t be as efficient if the wattage is too high, which is what the gold and silver ratings refer to.\n\nFinally, a modular power supply refers to the cables, which can be completely disconnected from the unit to keep down clutter and simplify installation.\n\nSuggested Hardware\n\nCorsair RM750e (2023): The updated model of Corsair’s classic PSU is a great option for basic builds. It’s frequently on sale, well-equipped, and fully modular. It also supports the new ATX 3.0 standard.\n\nEVGA 1000GT: An upgrade pick looks something like the EVGA 1000T. Still fully modular, this power supply offers a slightly higher wattage.\n\nCorsair RM1000X 1000-Watt Power Supply: For PCs with multiple graphics cards or a whole lot of storage, Corsair's 1,000-watt PSU is a good pick.\n\nOperating System\n\nWhen you build a PC, you don't automatically have Windows included. You'll have to buy a license from Microsoft or another vendor and make a USB key to install it. Here’s a little more information about what you get out of the newest version of Windows.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nThe internal layout of every gaming PC is a little different, so we're not going to get too far into the details here. Your best bet for specific instructions for your hardware will be referencing your manuals and searching for your components on YouTube. It can be super helpful to actually see a person handle and install your exact hardware, especially when you're stuck and can't quite figure out what the hell your manual is talking about. But here are some general tips for putting all these components together.\n\nFirst, prepare a clean workspace. This can be a dining room table, a cleared-off desk—just any surface big enough for your case to lay flat on its side, with ample room around it for the rest of your components. You’ll also need a Phillips-head screwdriver, which will fit most of your case screws. As a general rule, screws in cases only need to be snugly fastened; there’s no need to really tighten anything down. When you put these parts together, be sure to discharge any static buildup and work on a nonmetallic surface like a wooden table.\n\nMost of the components you bought are going to come with instruction manuals; keep them handy. You’ll mostly reference the case manual, which will walk you through setting everything up for your specific parts, and then switch to the motherboard manual when it’s time. When your manual and our guide contradict each other, go with the manual. It can be pretty intimidating—there’s a lot to look at—but think of all this as a big Lego set. Each piece fits into another. For the motherboard, your first job is going to be seating your CPU.\n\nInstalling Your CPU\n\nThis part of the process can be a little delicate, so make sure to read all the instructions and identify each piece before you start. Depending on what kind of CPU you purchased (Intel or AMD), the chip will have either little pins on one side (don’t touch them) or little golden contacts on one side (don’t touch these either). Seriously, don’t touch that side of your chip. Oils from your fingertips can damage the contacts, or you might bend a pin. Do either one and your processor becomes nothing more than an expensive hunk of silicon.\n\nSeating your processor is pretty easy. Open your motherboard box and remove any plastic wrapping, but keep the motherboard inside; we’ll be using the box as a workspace. Double-check your motherboard’s instructions and make sure you’ve unlocked the processor socket. It’ll be a big square with a bunch of little holes (or contacts), with a lever or button beside it. Your motherboard’s instructions will say explicitly how to unlock the socket so you can put your processor in without any issues.\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed that it’s unlocked and ready, find which corner of your processor has a little golden triangle and line it up with the same symbol on your motherboard’s processor socket. Gently lower the processor into the socket, then gently flip the latch or locking mechanism. You shouldn’t have to fight it. If you have to press really hard, check that the processor is socketed correctly.\n\nA note on thermal paste: Many CPU coolers ship with thermal paste pre-applied. If you see a circle or pattern of silver goo, typically covered by a plastic housing, that means you can skip the next step and go straight to installing your cooler. If your cooler doesn’t have that, it likely came with a little plastic syringe of paste, which you’ll need to apply yourself. Your CPU cooler instructions will cover this in detail as well.\n\nGo ahead and carefully squeeze a tiny ball (no bigger than a pea) of thermal paste onto the silicon square on your processor. You’ll want it as close to the center as you can get.\n\nNow line up your heat sink with the screws surrounding your processor and gently lower it into place. Gently squish the thermal paste, and the goal here is to create a thin layer covering the back of your processor. It’s OK if it oozes a little bit, but if it oozes out and over the edge of the processor, you've used too much. Get some isopropyl alcohol, dab it on a lint-free wipe, and clean the processor and heat sink. Wait till they’re thoroughly dry and try again.\n\nNow that your processor is seated, take a look at the shiny square of silicon in the center of it. That’s where your heat sink is going to sit. Your processor came with a heat sink, and on one side of it you’ll see a copper circle. You’re going to be putting the heat sink directly on top of the processor, with the silicone square and the copper circle lining up perfectly.\n\nIf it looks all right, screw your heat sink into place, making sure not to overtighten. Flip back to your motherboard instruction book and find the right place near the processor socket to plug in your heat sink’s cooling fan. It should be close to your processor socket. Once you’ve found it, plug it in—congratulations, you just installed a CPU. This was the hardest part, and it’s over. Good job!\n\nInstalling Your Storage and Memory\n\nInstalling your memory will feel like a breeze after the CPU. There will either be two or four slots right next to the processor, and your motherboard manual will let you know which to use based on your kit.\n\nAt the end of each slot you’ll find little plastic levers, either on one end or both. Press them down gently until they click open away from the slot. Line up your memory, making sure the off-center notch in the slot matches the notch on the sticks. With the stick vertical, gently apply even pressure across the top until the levers on the ends click fully into place.\n\nIf you have an M.2 drive (a tiny SSD about the size of a stick of gum), there should be a place on the motherboard where you slot it directly. Check your motherboard’s manual to see where the M.2 slot is, which may be under a heat sink. Insert the end of the drive with the contacts into the slot, then gently push down the other end and use the tiny screw to secure it in place.\n\nInstalling Your Motherboard and Power Supply\n\nNext you’ll install the motherboard into your case, making sure to reference the manual for any specific details. Start by gently lowering it into the case, placing the ports at the back into the wide slot, and be careful not to slide the motherboard around too much as you find the right spot. When the screw holes underneath line up, go around turning them slightly to set them in place, then go around and finish each. They don’t need to be super tight, just hand tighten them until they’re snug to hold everything in place.\n\nNext, you’ll want to install your power supply. There should be a spot for it near the top or bottom of the case, a big square spot that will fit your supply perfectly. If you’re having trouble finding it, look at the back of your case for a rectangular hole with three or four screw holes around it. That’s where the power supply goes and where you’ll plug in your PC when you’re all done. Once you've found its home, slot it in and screw it into place, making sure the fan is facing either an open area or a vent. Don’t plug in anything yet; we’re going to come back to the power supply in a bit.\n\nInstalling Your Graphics Card\n\nYour GPU is going to be pretty big, so installing it last makes sense. That means how it fits into your case is important. Once you put your GPU in there, space is going to start getting tight.\n\nFlip open your motherboard’s instruction book again and look for a PCIe slot. It’s going to be a horizontal slot with a little plastic latch beside it, near the middle or bottom of your motherboard. Hold the GPU up to the slot on the motherboard, and note which plates in the case need to be removed to make room. Unscrew them and set them aside.\n\nLine up the HDMI and DisplayPorts with the back of your case, and push the GPU into the horizontal slot. It should lock into place easily enough with a click; if it doesn’t, make sure you’re inserting it correctly.\n\nUse the screw or screws from the plates you removed and use them to fasten the GPU to the case. There’s a little spot for that on the same piece of metal with the HDMI ports. It should be easy to find. If you’re having trouble, take a look at this video from hardware manufacturer Asus. Some of the specifics will be different, but it’s a great look at how to install a GPU.\n\nPower Cables\n\nNow that you’ve installed the other components, it’s time to hook up the power. Making sure the PSU is unplugged and turned off using the switch on the back, connect each component that requires power one by one, making sure the plugs are facing the right direction and fully seated. If the cables are permanently attached, they’ll have labels on their plug ends. For modular power supplies with detachable cables, make sure to match the label on the cable, PSU port, and component.\n\nHow you route these power cables will depend on the specifics of your setup. Some cases have dedicated areas behind the motherboard, with gaskets at the front to minimize clutter. Searching PCPartPicker or Youtube for your case will show you how other people have managed their cables.\n\nA New PSU: The instructions below refer to the power supply cable configuration that home systems have used for years. A new standard, ATX 3.0, is in the process of rolling out. If you have a particularly cutting-edge system, make sure to check your manual for the details on the setup process.\n\nStart with the motherboard, which will have a much wider dedicated plug than the other cables. Make sure the tab on the outside edge clicks fully into place. Your motherboard may also have an extra 4- or 8-pin power port on the opposite corner, near the CPU, and a dedicated power cable for this purpose.\n\nGPUs generally require dedicated power as well, and these cables will often be labeled as PCIe or VGA. There may be multiple of these, and they come in a variety of configurations, so check your GPU manual and make sure you’ve got power plugged into any available ports on the outside corner of the card.\n\nFinishing Up\n\nFinally, connect your motherboard to the buttons and ports on the front of the case. There’s a tiny set of pins, typically near the bottom of the board, and they correspond to a set of cables hardwired into the case. Your motherboard may include a little adapter to make this process easier. Match the labels on the board or adapter to the ends of the cables, and carefully slide them on.\n\nIf this is your first build, we recommend just sticking with the fan configuration that shipped with the case. Each fan will have its own cable that provides both power and data, which may be hanging loose with each fan or plugged into a shared fan controller somewhere in the case. Either connect each fan to a port on the motherboard found in your manual, or connect the fan controller’s end to the motherboard and power supply.\n\nThis part of your build really depends on the hardware you purchased, so consult the manuals for each component to ensure you've correctly plugged them into your motherboard and the power supply. It can help to run down a mental checklist of each part you purchased and ask whether it has both a power connection and data connection, which may be shared.\n\nBoot It Up and Install Windows\n\nThe final stage of your build is a simple one: Hit your Power button. If the PC whirs to life, you probably put it together perfectly! If it doesn't, don't despair. There are a lot of potential problems that could cause a PC to fail to boot up for the first time. This video from Kingston goes over some pitfalls that might cause you some headaches, so if you're not able to boot your PC, give it a watch and retrace your steps.\n\nThere's also a chance you could have received faulty components. This video goes over some tips on how to check your parts. In general, if you’re having trouble with a specific component, YouTube is your friend. There are tons of helpful PC-building tutorials.\n\nIf it started up just fine, the next step is super easy: Turn it off. Remember that Windows flash drive you made earlier? Plug it into the PC and boot it up again. If you set it up right, your computer should just do its thing and get started installing Windows. If not, you might need to open your BIOS (check your motherboard's manual for how to do that) and set the USB drive to be a “boot device” first. Here's a brief rundown of that process (start at step 3).\n\nYou Did It!\n\nCongratulations on building your first PC. It's a bit of a pain, but it's a great way to spend an afternoon. Or a couple of days, depending on how many unforeseen headaches you run into."
