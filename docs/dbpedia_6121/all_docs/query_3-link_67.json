Every gaming pc is benchmarked and quality controlled to ensure your PC lives up to our high standards. Which begs just one question: Are you ready to enter the Forge?",

        "text": "Thank you for purchasing from Starforge! Please follow these steps if you are unsure of how to go from an open box to gaming on your new computer.\n\nStep 1: Carefully remove internal packaging from your gaming PC. Occasionally the packaging will cling to various internal connectors. If that is the case in your gaming PC, slowly pull on the packaging while gently holding connectors in place. These foam Instapak are conformed to match your computer’s internal components and come standard in every Starforge Systems gaming PC. Store ALL of your PC’s packaging for return/RMA purposes. If you do not retain these packing supplies, and need to return ship your gaming PC for any reason, please contact our customer care team. Starforge Systems will make packaging materials available.\n\nStep 2: Check for any damage that may have been done to your computer during shipping. Each gaming PC is tested and given stringent quality control before being carefully prepared for its journey to its final destination. The vast majority of gaming PCs will not have any defects even after time spent with third party couriers. However, shipping can occasionally cause components to shift, detach or even become damaged. If you notice any internal or external issues, please contact our customer care team.\n\nIn the event of broken glass panels, please do not attempt to handle or remove any glass shards from the surface of your computer, internal components or the shipping box itself without protective clothing.\n\nStep 3: Connect desired peripherals to your Input / Output ports, ensuring that any display devices are plugged into your graphics card. These ports are oriented horizontally. midway down the back of your computer’s case, and plug into your gaming PC’s Graphics Card. There are vertical ports towards the top of your gaming PC among USB and other Input / Output ports. These will connect to your Central Processor through your motherboard, which is not designed for high performance gameplay. Using these ports may result in severely hampered gaming experience, or in many cases, no display at all.\n\nStep 4: Plug your computer in via the supplied power cable. Other appliances or computers may have similar power cables. While these cables are generally interchangeable, Starforge Systems suggests using the supplied power cable for your gaming PC. Be sure that the power switch is in the ‘I’ position. Your gaming PC will not power on if the power switch on your PC’s power supply is set to ‘O’. This switch can be found at the bottom of your gaming PC tower, generally next to where the computer plugs into the wall."
