        "text": "My mouse will reconnect/disconnect (will even hear the sounds from Windows), and the light on the bottom of the mouse will turn off/turn on as it starts working again.\n\nIt really sucks to be playing a game (and happens on desktop as well) for the mouse to just die out for a few seconds and come back. Sometimes it will not happen for days and other times it will do it two or more times within 15 seconds.\n\nI tried two different wired mice, tried multiple USB ports (on the front of the computer, back of the computer, used a USB hub and plugged in a card that connects to the USB connectors on the motherboard and adds a few USB ports to the back of the computer, and I also bought a USB 2.0 PCI card and that did not help).\n\nNothing else seems to reconnect like this, my USB keyboard has never once cut out like the mouse does and neither have any of the other devices I have connected (webcam, USB hub, various devices sometimes connected through USB cables, and IR receiver for windows Media Center remote). I have disconnected all USB devices except for my keyboard and mouse and the problem still occurs.\n\nI guess it could be something wrong with my motherboard but since no other devices behave similarly I'm just hoping that it is some kind of driver conflict. Installing Logitech's drivers has had no effect. It seemed at first that if I go to Device Manager and uninstall HID-compliant mouse (that and Logitech mx518 are listed) that would fix it, but it doesn't seem to work anymore or at least not every time (it keeps re-installing).\n\nI have googled \"USB mouse disconnects and reconnects\", and it seems to be fairly common but none of those were resolved.\n\nTo stick some easy steps:\n\nIt happens with or without the drivers installed\n\nIt has happened with multiple mice on the same computer\n\nThe BIOS is the latest version (P08)\n\nMotherboard drivers are the latest version\n\nDevice Manager isn't listing any problems on any USB devices\n\nHappens with every USB port, even addon USB cards\n\nHappens when all USB devices aside from mouse and keyboard are unplugged\n\nI read that maybe it is an IRQ conflict, and I tried to look into that but did not really know what was going on, but didn't see anything obviously wrong.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nQ6600 CPU\n\nEVGA 780I SLI motherboard\n\n4 GB RAM\n\nLogitech MX-518 mouse\n\nWindows 7 64-bit\n\nEVGA GTX 260 screen card\n\n650 W power supply (single rail).\n\nSupposedly this can be caused by registry corruption:\n\nThis issue can occur when the device enumerator located at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet gets corrupted. As a result, the mouse attached to the USB controller is duplicated and the system gets confused. Periodical attemtps to remove the dupe are discarded after re-detecting the mouse attached to the controller.\n\nThat page recommends a system restore or uninstalling the USB device in Device Manager.\n\nIn addition to uninstalling the device itself, you can uninstall all the USB root hubs on your machine, and they will be reinstalled after a reboot, as recommended in this HP article USB devices are detected by Windows but are not working properly:\n\n...\n\n5.Double-click Universal Serial Bus Controllers to expand the list.\n\n6.Right-click the first USB Root Hub in the list and then select Uninstall . Continue uninstalling all USB Root Hubs.\n\n...\n\nYou can also uninstall all previous instances of the device (and the root hubs) using a tool like USBDeview. It will show you all devices that have ever been installed, even if they aren't currently plugged in, and you can uninstall them from there, so the \"detected new hardware\" thing will pop up the next time you plug it in. Sort them by vendor ID, select everything related to that product, right click, and uninstall them all.\n\nI'm not sure if the registry corruption is truly the cause, and I'm not sure if this actually fixes it, but it's worth a try. It seems to be working for my most recent experience with this problem.\n\nanswered Jul 18, 2013 at 15:54\n\nendolithendolith\n\n7,5912626 gold badges8787 silver badges124124 bronze badges"
