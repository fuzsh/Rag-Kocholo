I don't know the sciences and maths behind it but it strikes me as more of a confusion of responses between the refresh rate of the monitor, game and mouse... Or something like that. But it's more complicated than raw power, I was having this issue with a variety of games for a while until I dropped my mouse polling rate down. Sometimes it can be caused by something obtuse like too many inputs being connected at once, leading to conflicting instances of HID-Compliant device drivers in your device manager. It's one of those silly PC-centric issues where you think more is better but it doesn't shake out that way.\n\nOne thing you can do quickly is if you have a bunch of input devices connected (like extra mice, keyboards or gamepads) you could unplug them, restart your PC and give the game another go to see if that helped. It may not work, or you may be asking \"well why would I have all that extra stuff connected ya big doof?!\" And to that I would say fair enough!\n\nBut I still think it's a mouse polling/report rate issue!\n\nJust as an aside, mouse polling/report rate is separate from DPI!\n\nYou can check it using this link:\n\nhttps://zowie.benq.com/en/support/mouse-rate-checker.html\n\n(This should work with any screen, not just Benq!)\n\nSwipe your cursor around the screen as fast as possible and watch the numbers on the right side of the screen. The highest number on the list is your polling/report rate.\n\nIf it's 250 or less it's probably not be the issue, if it's 500-1000 this may be the problem.\n\nHow you would fix this depends on the brand of your mouse. For the most part it would require its software, I don't think there's an easy way to change it in Windows. If it's a Logitech mouse for instance you would need their Logitech Gaming Software (https://support.logitech.com/en_us/software/lgs) jump into settings and look for 'Report Rate.' Set it to 250. It might still work OK at a maximum of 500 but for the best overall compatibility and performance 250 is a better choice.\n\n500 should be fine for most games but a surprising amount of games recommend 250, some games may be fine with 1000 but some really don't like it.\n\nMaybe this will help, I'm sorry if it doesn't, and I hope your issue gets sorted out soon!\n\nIt does sound very much like a mouse polling/report rate issue.
