        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI am getting inconsistent stats from Logcat and Snapdragon Profiler. I am profiling the RAM usage of my application made with Unreal Engnine 4.24 and latest Oculus SDK (from the oculus branch of unreal engine). The issue is that according to snap dragon my app is using around 1.5 Gb and according to Logcat 227 mb.\n\n(I have already posted this on the Snapdragon developer forum)\n\nWho do I trust? And how do you guys profile your RAM usage?\n\nI use the Oculus OVR Metrics Tool as my first \"go to\" for performance measurement and RAM usage:\n\nI find that the numbers reported from OVR Metrics roughly match the numbers being reported from Unreal via \"stat unit\", \"stat fps\", \"stat memory\", etc.\n\nhttps://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Performance/StatCommands/index.html"
