        "text": "Boeing and Airbus post unprecedented losses throughout the year, with last quarter being the worst on record for the global aerospace industry.\n\nDefence is being used as a stimulus measure in markets with large domestic capacity, particularly the US, but there will be medium-term constraint due to fiscal pressures.\n\nThe US Department of Defense experienced delays of around three months to major defence acquisition programmes, noting specific vulnerability within aerospace, shipbuilding and small space launch markets.\n\nSupply chain security initiatives have been given additional impetus, such as for microelectronics in the US.\n\nIn most cases, immediate budget reductions in defense have been minimal and represent deferral of programs, not outright cancellations\n\nMilitary aerospace: Supply chain disruption and possible impact on low technology readiness level programmes or legacy support programmes in favour of active production lines. US Airforce modernisation strategy could be impacted.\n\nLand platforms: Little impact on programmes so far. Higher levels of domestic capability compared to naval and aerospace and less regulated supply chains means future readjustment should be easier and quicker.\n\nCyber & IT: Military cybersecurity IT subsectors well positioned in the medium terms due to demands on distributed working and secure collaboration. Logistic IT specialists also stand to benefit, with new enterprise resource planning implementations."
