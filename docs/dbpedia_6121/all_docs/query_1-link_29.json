        "text": "This was a wild ride for expectations (personally) When first announced didn't see that much excitement other than hardcore fans from the first game, so I first thought this was going to do maybe slightly better, but overall very similar launch numbers to the first one, then when more information came I saw that this more of a refinement of the first one with the same biome and mostly the same enemies and started to get worried, as I saw people disappointed that the game looked way too similar to the first one yet somehow started to se more casual interest online, so started to believe this had potential to grow beyond the initial fanbase, continued to see people worried with some of the footage and then Capcom confirming that he game was not going to be a very stable game technically, but people were still excited, then reviews came and I for sure thought this was going to have RE level of sales, even when being a not so good technically game, just to see how some of the design choices gave way to a lot of misinformation about the MTX hurting the WOM a lot.\n\nStill think this is a good success for Capcom, given that I totally saw the game doing less and also more depending on when you asked me about it, and given the first game legs, I have no trouble seeing this as a 10M seller in a few years, maybe with an expansion to address some of the complaints (enemy variety, which feels even more egregious when there is no easy way to fast travel, not even with MTX like some people tried to claim) and with hardware getting better, leading to people enjoying it with better framerates in the future.\n\nDragon's Dogma selling anywhere near a Final Fantasy game speaks more about FF than of DD, even with platform exclusivity. The game should be compared to its predecessor and other titles from the same publisher recently. DD2 more than doubled the sales of DD1 in half the time at a higher price point, and it's not that far off, relatively speaking, with far more popular titles like RE4R with its 3 million in 3 days.\n\nIts not near to either FF or RE4R.\n\nDD2 did 2.5M in 2 weeks on a 200M+ installbase\n\nFF16 did 3M in 4 days on a 40M+ installbase\n\nRER4 did 3M in 3 days on a 280M+ installbase\n\nIts not near to either FF or RE4R.\n\nDD2 did 2.5M in 2 weeks on a 200M+ installbase\n\nFF16 did 3M in 4 days on a 40M+ installbase\n\nRER4 did 3M in 3 days on a 280M+ installbase\n\nI don't understand why this is so disingenuous\n\n-we know DD2's day count is 11, so why are we rounding up to 2 weeks? That's making it 3 days slower\n\n-FFXVI never confirmed if it 4 or 6 days\n\n-Even if it was 4 days, it is very probable it was overstepped. The legs were not bad enough to not get another million milestone in the first month if they had sold a lot of their 3 million stock ... and yet ...\n\n-DD2 is mostly digital by far, so a lot of sell through in its figure\n\n-This isn't even how installbase works\n\nWhy would install base matter here? Does SE get some sort of award and bonus for not releasing on other platforms? They made a business choice. It's no one's job to make excuses and qualifiers for them now.\n\nYes, the payment they get for exclusivity factors in the installbase.\n\nIt also effects sales so making a comparison without taking it into account is not capturing the market reality.\n\nQuick question, if FF16 had access to a 280M active user base at launch, how many sales would it have made in 4 days?\n\nWe don't have the data to say exactly how much more but its definitely more.\n\nGoing from 40M to 280M is huge.\n\nIf installbase differences that big had no consequence then crossgenerational games wouldn't last so long and third parties would not be multiplatform.\n\nMust be the engine, right? Maybe it can't deal with open world. Because nothing in the game should be pushing the CPU that hard.\n\nThis is an explanation from Capcom:\n\n■Regarding Frame Rate\n\nA large amount of CPU usage is allocated to each character and calculating the impact of their physical presence in various areas. In certain situations where numerous characters appear simultaneously, the CPU usage can be very high and may affect the frame rate. We are aware that in such situations, settings that reduce GPU load may currently have a limited effect; however, we are looking into ways to improve performance in the future.\n\nThey say frame-rate improvements will be coming in future updates, so the waiting game continues.\n\nI don't know, I don't think this having fast travel and good performance (both of which would have necessitated a total rework of the design of the game as it wouldn't be as alive as it is) would helped reaching 5 million or something in the same timeframe, I think this is reaching the amount of people that would be interested in a game like this (kind of repetitive but incredibly alive and where sometimes the unexpected can happen). This seems a really good result as it seems a lot of the people who got Dark Arisen for pennies actually went an upgraded to day one, and I'm sure once it starts getting price reductions it will surpass even something like DMCV."
