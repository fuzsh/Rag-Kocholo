        "text": "Since 2007, UNIGINE benchmarks provide completely unbiased results and generate true in-game rendering workloads across multiple platforms (Windows, Linux and macOS), featuring support for both DirectX and OpenGL. There is also an interactive experience with fly-by and walk-through modes giving a chance to explore all corners of these virtual worlds powered by the cutting-edge UNIGINE Engine.\n\nUNIGINE Benchmarks can be effectively used to determine the stability of PC hardware (CPU, GPU, power supply, cooling system) under extremely stressful conditions, as well as for overclocking.\n\nAlongside a completely free Basic edition, UNIGINE benchmarks provide in-depth performance reviews and extended features in the Professional edition for hardware manufacturers, assembly and repair shops, and all commercial companies involved in hardware stability testing, component evaluation or hardware marketing activities.\n\nAlso there are special terms for the press.\n\nContact Us"
