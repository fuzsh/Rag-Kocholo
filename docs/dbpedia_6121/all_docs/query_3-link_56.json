What starts as an over-the-top inheritance dispute evolves into increasingly outlandish scenarios — including touring the world on the \"Death Queen Circuit\" and battling relentlessly conniving solicitors — in which players will slap, dodge, feint, and counter their way to victory. The slapalicious saga further comes to life through a fabulous anime-style intro and fully voiced cutscenes between each bout, which can be enjoyed in either English (featuring the talents of Cristina \"Vee\" Valenzuela, Tiana Camacho, Stephanie Sheh, Anjali Kunapaneni, and Anna Brisbin) or Japanese.
