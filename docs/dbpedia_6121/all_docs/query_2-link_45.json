        "text": "Canon offers a Stop Motion Animation Firmware addon for EOS R, EOS RP, R5, R8, R100, and EOS R6 Mark II cameras. You must purchase a camera with the special firmware, or send your camera in to get it updated. It is a paid offering. (The models that are available may vary by region.)\n\nHere is an overview of the features it provides, and the support in each version of Dragonframe:\n\nHD Live View: The live view (video assist) is doubled from 960×640 to 1920×1280.\n\nFocus Peaking: The camera shows which parts of the image are in focus with bright colored pixels. You must use an RF lens and set it to ‘MF’.\n\nAperture Lock: The camera keeps the lens closed during video assist and while capturing photos. This prevents potential flicker from the aperture opening and closing repeatedly. Requires an RF lens and Dragonframe 5 or newer. The feature is always on in Dragonframe 5. You can verify by choosing a fairly closed aperture, like f/22, and looking into the lens. Verify that it is closed during live view. Then verify that when you take a picture it does not open and close.\n\nFocus Programming: This also requires an RF lens and Dragonframe 5 or newer. Dragonframe can program the focus if you create an axis in ARC and set the Connection to ‘Digital Focus’. This feature does not work on a shot that also zooms. Changing the zoom affects the focus range. Prime lenses are best for this feature. Or set the lens to the desired zoom for the shot, and turn the camera off and on.\n\nInquire at Canon:\n\nCanon USA: https://www.usa.canon.com/explore/stop-motion-animation-firmware\n\nCanon UK: https://www.canon.co.uk/pro/services/upgrades/stop-motion-camera-firmware/\n\nFirst, make sure your camera is supported by visiting the Camera Support page, taking care to note which versions of Dragonframe support the camera (if any). Follow any setup instructions provided. Then you will want to verify that the computer itself can see the camera. If you are on a Mac, use “Image Capture”, which is an application that comes with the computer and is located in the “Applications” folder. On Windows, you can see if the camera connects when you plug it in, since Windows always pops up a message for new devices. If you have a Canon camera, you can also use “Canon EOS Utility” on either platform to detect the camera. If you have Nikon Camera Control Pro 2, you can check that as well.\n\nIf the operating system or other programs can see your camera, but Dragonframe does not, you should definitely send in a camera test (see Dragonframe Help menu) and also contact support. If nothing can see your camera, try using a different USB cable and port, and possibly try your camera with another computer.\n\nAnti-virus software blocking camera detection.\n\nIf you have anti-virus software, make sure to white-list Dragonframe so that it can access the camera.\n\nCamera Support\n\nFirst of all, it is super important to understand that the live view and high-resolution images are different. In the cinematography workspace you set up your high-resolution capture settings and take test shots to make sure that your final images will look correct. In the animation workspace you are typically working with the video assist images from your camera, although you can switch to review your high-res images.\n\nPossible Cause #1: Using a Nikon DSLR\n\nMost of the Nikon cameras do not have live view “exposure simulation”. This means that their live view exposure level auto-adjusts all the time, and does not reflect changes in camera settings. In this case, you will have to live with the difference. Make sure to check your high-resolution images early and often.\n\nPossible Cause #2: Exposure Simulation is turned off\n\nThe Canon live view DSLRs all have exposure simulation. It is either “always on”, or there is a setting to turn it on. If there is a setting, it will be called out in our setup instructions. Just make sure you’ve followed that step.\n\nPossible Cause #3: Using a manual aperture lens on a Canon body\n\nWe recommend using a manual Nikon lens on Canon body, because this avoids flicker. The downside is that this can affect the live view exposure simulation of the Canon cameras. Usually you can adjust the live view to match the high-resolution images by adjusting the “Exposure Preview Offset” in the Cinematography workspace’s Camera Settings. You can read more about the problem and see another solution here.\n\nSometimes the internal live view calculation is thrown off by the last digital lens connected.\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\nAttach a Canon digital lens to the camera.\n\nOpen the aperture as much as it can go (lowest f/stop number).\n\nTake a picture.\n\nPower down the camera and then try your Nikon lens.\n\nIf you still can’t get close with the exposure preview offset, let us know.\n\nPossible Cause #4: The sensor isn’t getting enough light.\n\nWe often get calls from people who are on a dimly lit set, with their aperture stopped down to f/22, and with “Exposure Preview Offset” set all the way to “+4”, and they want to know why the live view doesn’t match their high-resolution image. This is especially problematic for manual aperture lenses, since the aperture is always stopped down.\n\nThe reason is simple: the lens doesn’t have enough light. You have exceeded the limits of the live view exposure simulator (inside the camera).\n\nHere are some possible solutions:\n\nIncrease the lighting on your set.\n\nOpen up the aperture.\n\nUse a bash light (also called a work light). This is a light that is on for the animator and video assist, but off for the high-resolution capture.\n\nThere are a few ways to set up a bash light with Dragonframe:\n\nUse the DDMX-512 to control a bash light through DMX.\n\nUse the DDMX-512 to control a bash light through a relay.\n\nGo to Preferences : Capture and set a capture delay of several seconds. Turn a light off after you press the shoot button, and then back on after the high-resolution image is captured.\n\n[DDMX-512]\n\nIn the Animation workspace you typically are looking at the live view and stepping back to other video assist images you already captured. These should always line up perfectly. Now, you switch to view the high-resolution proxies in the animation workspace, because you want to see your “real” images. But when you step between live and the other frames, the image doesn’t line up perfectly.\n\nThere is no real solution to this problem. Dragonframe gets the live view and the high-resolution images directly from the camera. Unfortunately these are not framed exactly the same, and so they will just be off. But that’s why we have the live view, so you can animate with it.\n\nIf this is super important to you, there is something you can try. You may find that certain image sizes have framing that more closely matches the live view. You can adjust the image size in the Cinematography window’s Camera Settings, and compare to the live view. For example, the Large JPEG might use a slightly different section of the sensor than the Medium JPEG. You can experiment to see which matches the best.\n\nYou want to have a grow light on for the time between shots, then have it turn off and other lights turn on prior to capturing the image.\n\nYou can accomplish this with the bash light program.\n\nThe bash light is normally used as a way to provide extra light for the animator while setting up a shot. So it is on while using the live view, but then turns off before taking the hi-res capture. You can read about the bash program in the User Guide.\n\nSet up a bash light program that has the grow lights enabled.\n\nIf you need an extended delay between turning off the bash light and capturing the image, you can adjust the “Bash light settle time.” You can find this setting in the DMX settings window (gear near the top left of DMX).\n\nSo, the grow light is enabled, either as a DMX channel, or as a trigger/relay output, on the bash program.\n\nWhen the program goes to shoot, it captures the live view, then switches from the Bash to the main program. It waits for “Bash light settle time”, then takes the picture.\n\nWindows Only: Dragonframe 3.5+ uses OpenGL v2.1 to provide high-performance graphics processing.\n\nIf the driver for your graphics card does not support OpenGL 2.1, Dragonframe will give you a message like this:\n\n“The driver for your graphics card is too old and must be updated.”\n\n“Dragonframe requires OpenGL 2.1. Your graphics/driver card is using OpenGL 1.4.”\n\nAdditionally, if you have an Intel HD graphics card on Windows XP/7, you may get a message like this:\n\n“The driver for your graphics card is too old and must be updated.\n\n(You are running Intel 2.1.0 – Build 8.15.10.2413.)”\n\nIf this is the case, there is a good chance you can resolve the problem by updating the driver for your graphics card. (Intel HD on Windows XP/7 requires driver 8.15.10.2450 or newer).\n\nGenerally, the Device Manager’s option to check for driver updates will NOT work. It always says your graphics card driver is up to date.\n\nOne option is to check your computer manufacturer’s website for drivers specific to your model.\n\nAlternatively, you may need to visit the graphics card maker to get the latest driver:\n\nFor Intel Integrated Graphics cards, please find your latest driver here:\n\nhttp://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect/graphics\n\nFor nVidia graphics cards, you can find the drivers here:\n\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us\n\nFor ATI/AMD graphics cards, the drivers are here:\n\nhttp://support.amd.com/en-us/download\n\nAlso, if you have a laptop with both an integrated and discrete graphics cards, see if you have the option of always using the discrete card with Dragonframe. In general they perform much better than the Intel integrated cards.\n\nWe’ve had a handful of reports where OS X shows this error dialog when the user tries to open Dragonframe:\n\nIf you look at the report, it says something like this:\n\nDyld Error Message:\n\nLibrary not loaded: @executable_path/../Frameworks/libavcodec.dylib\n\nReferenced from: /Applications/Dragonframe/Dragonframe.app/Contents/MacOS/Dragonframe\n\nReason: Incompatible library version: Dragonframe requires version 55.0.0 or later, but libavcodec.dylib provides version 52.0.0\n\nThe issue is caused by some other program setting a global library path, which is a very bad thing.\n\nThere may be more than one program that does this, but we’ve found that older versions of an application called “Tracker” does this. If you installed Tracker version 4.84 or older, you should uninstall it and then install version 4.85 or newer to resolve the issue.\n\nIf you’ve never installed tracker, look for “DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH” in your environment plist file:\n\nOpen a Terminal (Applications : Utilities) and type:\n\nsudo open ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist\n\nIt will ask for your password. This is your machine password that you use to log in. It does not show it to you as you type.\n\nIn the editor that opens, remove anything that says “DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH”.\n\nNote: This might require XCode. If you don’t have it, you may alternatively need to just remove this file, like this:\n\nsudo rm ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist\n\nIf Dragonframe’s window is entirely black when you start it, or if the program gives you warning about graphics card misconfiguration, this information is for you.\n\nMany computers have two graphics cards. One that comes with the motherboard, usually an Intel integrated card. Then there may be a secondary, more advanced card, from NVidia or AMD.\n\nDragonframe needs to run using the more advanced card, and may have issues if you have set it to run on the integrated Intel card.\n\nOne way this can happen is if you plug the monitor directly into the HDMI/VGA/DVI port on the motherboard, instead of going into the separate graphics card. When you have a graphics card from NVidia or AMD, it will provide its own ports to plug into. If you plug into the wrong one, applications cannot use the better card.\n\nAnother way this can happen is if you configure your system to make Dragonframe run on the Intel card. NVidia and AMD provide software that lets you choose which graphics card to run specific applications on. You may need to look in that software and make sure Dragonframe is set to run on the proper card.\n\nIf you try to activate your license, and you get a message that says: “You have exceeded the purchased number of activations.”, then you have probably installed the software on too many machines. You are allowed to have it activated on two machines at once per serial number.\n\nNote that you are only licensed to use it on one machine at a time (per license).\n\nIf you have two machines with two cameras operating at the same time, you need two licenses.If you have the software installed on a machine that doesn’t need it any more, you can deactivate a license by using “Deactivate License…” in the Help menu.\n\nIf you cannot deactivate a license, because a machine is broken or missing, you can manually deactivate the serial number yourself. Enter your registered email address on our Find Your License page.\n\nWe will send you an email that shows which machines have been activated, and will give you the option to deactivate them.\n\nIf you do not have access to your registered email address, or cannot remember it, please write to us with any order information you have, and we will work with you to sort it out:\n\nFind Your License\n\n[email protected]\n\nWe understand that many schools have been forced to look for ways to get students working from home during the world-wide health crisis, and that some schools continue to need a solution for remote setups.\n\nWe have now developed a system for schools to manage these temporary student licenses on their own.\n\nGetting Set Up to Manage Licenses\n\nIn order to manage temporary student licenses:\n\nYou must have an account on our site. You can register for an account if you don’t have one. [Register Account]\n\nThe account must be set up as an Educational account. If you are logged in and go to your account details page, it will say at the bottom if you have Educational pricing. If not, you can request it. [Account details]\n\nThe email address of the account must match the email address of the licenses. If not, you will need to sort this out with support.\n\nOnce you have met that criteria, your account dashboard will have a Licenses area that shows your existing licenses. [Licenses]\n\nCreating Temporary Student Licenses\n\nIn the Licenses section, you will see each of your school’s licenses.\n\nEach license will show a seat count. This is how many computers can be running the software at once, according to the license agreement.\n\nThere will also be a link, Convert to Temporary Individual Licenses.\n\nIf you click this link:\n\nAny machine currently using the license will be deactivated. (You cannot use the license until you convert it back from temporary licenses.)\n\nOur server will generate temporary student licenses. It will generate 2 * seat count licenses.\n\nOnce the licenses are generated, the page will allow you to enter an email address and click Assign.\n\nThis will send an email to the student with the license and a link to download the software.\n\nAt any point, you can Revoke a license that has been assigned in the past.\n\nThis will send an email to the student to let them know their license is expired.\n\nIt will also generate a new license that you can assign to a different student.\n\nConvert License Back to Regular License\n\nWhen students can return back to on-campus labs, you may want to remove the temporary licenses and start using the original license again.\n\nAny license that has been converted to temporary individual licenses will have a link, Convert Back to Standard License.\n\nIf you click this link:\n\nAll temporary student licenses will be deactivated.\n\nThe license will be restored and ready to activate locally.\n\nPlease contact [email protected] if you need help with this.\n\nDMC-32 / DMC-16 / DMC+\n\nThe Dragonframe Master Controller is our flagship motion control coordinator. It comes in three varieties: The DMC-32, DMC-16, and the DMC+. The DMC-32 has 32 channels of step and direction that you can wire to your stepper motor drivers. The DMC-16 has 16 channels of step and direction. The DMC+ provides powered drivers for channels 1-8, and step/dir signals for channels 9-16.\n\nUse the DMC-32 or DMC-16 with your own stepper motors drivers.\n\nUse the DMC+ with your own stepper motors (or drivers for channels 9-16).\n\nAll of the DMC devices support real-time shooting. This means they are capable of shooting stop motion and video.\n\nArduino dmc-lite\n\nStarting with Dragonframe 2024, we provide an Arduino sketch that can perform many of the real-time motion controls tasks that our DMC products provide. You need an Arduino Giga R1 or Portenta H7. We provide this sketch as a convenience, for people who are comfortable working with electronics and are interested in creating a homemade, low cost, simple motion control solution. We do not offer customizations of the dmc-lite sketch (although you are free to do it yourself).\n\nThe dmc-lite sketch is installed with Dragonframe at:\n\n[Dragonframe Install folder]/Resources/Arc Motion Control/dmc\n\nWIRING THE ARDUINO FOR MOTION CONTROL\n\nAn Arduino running the dmc-lite sketch will generate step and direction signals for stepper motors.\n\nIf you already have stepper motor drivers, you can take these signals and wire them into a connector for those drivers.\n\nThe pin-out for each step and direction signal is described in the dmc-lite sketch.\n\nArduino DFMoco\n\nThis is our original, more limited Arduino motion control sketch.\n\nArduino is an inexpensive, open-source hobby computer. We provide a special program (“Sketch” in Arduino world) called “DFMoco”. It provides 4-8 channels of step and direction output (depending on the Arduino model). We provide this sketch as a convenience, for people who are comfortable working with electronics and are interested in creating a homemade, low cost, simple motion control solution. We do not offer customizations of the DFMoco sketch (although you are free to do it yourself).\n\nThe Arduino DFMoco integration is non real-time (shoot-move-shoot only). This means that it can be used to shoot stop motion, but not video.\n\nThe DFMoco sketch is installed with Dragonframe at:\n\n[Dragonframe Install folder]/Resources/Arc Motion Control/DFMoco\n\nWIRING THE ARDUINO FOR MOTION CONTROL\n\nAn Arduino running the DFMoco sketch will generate step and direction signals for stepper motors.\n\nIf you already have stepper motor drivers, you can take these signals and wire them into a connector for those drivers.\n\nIf you do not have stepper motor drivers, and need to move relatively small stepper motors, you can wire the Arduino signals to a Big Easy Driver or comparable board. You will use one Big Easy Driver for each stepper motor.\n\nThe pin-out for each step and direction signal is described in the DFMoco sketch.\n\neMotimo\n\nThe eMotimo spectrum ST4 is a full-featured 4-axis controller with integrated pan and tilt control.\n\nAdditionally it has two powered motor output typically paired with a slider and focus motors.\n\nIt is accurate, repeatable, and supports cameras weighing up to 15lbs.\n\nThe eMotimo ST4 implements our real-time protocol. This makes it faster for programming moves, performing tests, and even capturing real-time video.\n\nInquire at eMotimo.\n\nKessler Crane\n\nKessler Crane is well-known motion control company that has recently integrated some of their motion control systems with Dragonframe.\n\nThe Kessler CineShooter and Second Shooter Pro implement our real-time protocol.\n\nConnecting Dragonframe with Kessler CineShooter\n\nConnecting Dragonframe with Kessler Second Shooter Pro\n\nSlidekamera\n\nSLIDEKAMERA produces high-quality motion control equipment for filmmakers, from lightweight DSLR’s to professional, heavy cinema cameras: sliders, remote heads with lens control, turntables and many more.\n\nUsing the new SLIDELINK PRO adapter enables real-time playback for SLIDEKAMERA hardware. This means it can be used to shoot stop motion or video.\n\nYou can use it to shoot not only stop-motion animation but also live video: advanced packshots, VFX plates, greenscreens or feature film’s shots demanding advanced camera movement.\n\nInquire at Slidekamera.\n\nPerforming Rigs –– Tools for Rigging Special Effects\n\nPerforming Rigs is a brand-new company, and the first with tools for rigging special effects.\n\n“Our five Rigs create and repeat the increasingly requested complex movement of elements within the frame. We have removed the tedium and inconsistency of practicing and repeating tosses, twirls, drops and sprays. We provide tools that are ready for work, avoiding short-deadline panics and erasing development time.”\n\n“If you are using the Dragonframe DMC-32 for work with stepper motors, then be sure to check out our Run-2 and Run-4 products! These products are rack mount or case style motor drivers and 48V power supplies for stepper motors, pre-configured for use with the DMC-32.”\n\nInquire at Performing Rigs.\n\nedelkrone (no assistance available)\n\nEdelkrone does not appear to be providing support for their Dragonframe integration. It may not be the best choice.\n\nThe edelkrone Link Adapter is now available for purchase, connecting edelkrone’s innovative motion control system to Dragonframe software for flawless stop motion animations. The system works with SliderPLUS and Slide Module v3* motion control setup paired with HeadPLUS v2** (required). By integrating edelkrone Link Adapter and Dragonframe into this setup, users can set camera motions by hand, create precise and repeatable camera movements, and adjust the focus of the camera using the knob located directly on the edelkrone Link Adapter.\n\n* or previous generation Slide Module v2\n\n** or previous generation HeadPLUS v1\n\nLearn more by visiting the edelkrone website.\n\nWatch edelkrone’s Link Adapter setup for Dragonframe tutorial.\n\nThe edelkrone Link Adapter is non real-time (shoot-move-shoot only) when used with Dragonframe. This means that it can be used to shoot stop motion, but not video.\n\nNoxon\n\nNoxon’s Mod Slider is light, rugged, and a very good value. It has an interchangeable rail system from 60cm to 200cm.\n\nYou can see it in action here: YouTube: Affordable 3 axis slider for video, timelapse and stopmotion.\n\nInquire at Noxon.\n\nThe Noxon Mod Slider + Dragonframe Adapter is non real-time (shoot-move-shoot only) when used with Dragonframe. This means that it can be used to shoot stop motion, but not video.\n\nNote: You must select ‘DFMoco Arduino’ as the device type in Scene | Connections.\n\nDynamic Perception\n\nDynamic Perception produces rugged, light-weight linear sliders and pan/tilt heads.\n\nTheir NMX Digital Motion Controller (3-axis stepper controller) is now Dragonframe compatible.\n\nThe NMX Digital Motion Controller is non real-time (shoot-move-shoot only) when used with Dragonframe.

Their SmartSlider Reflex S employs a unique fluid drag system to reduce vibration.\n\nThe DigiDRIVE Portable is a Dragonframe compatible controller. It can control all of the DigiDRIVE hardware.\n\nThe DigiDRIVE Portable is non real-time (shoot-move-shoot only) when used with Dragonframe. This means that it can be used to shoot stop motion, but not video.\n\nInquire at SmartSystem.\n\nDefinitions\n\n* Performing Rigs provides hardware and drivers that are compatible with DMC-32/DMC-16 output. You must use a DMC-32/DMC-16 to interface to their hardware.\n\n** DitoGear and edelkrone do not offer support for their integrations. DitoGear is completely defunct.\n\nzDMC-16 / zDMC+ : These are the DMC-16 and DMC+ that have been upgraded with the Xilinx Zynq 7Z020 FPGA+CPU. If you have the original DE0-Nano daughterboard, you can purchase an upgrade card in our store.\n\nReal-Time: The rig can move all motors together in perfect unison along a pre-programmed path. This is required for live action shots. It is also useful for quickly testing moves.\n\nMax Axis Count: The number of motors/axes that the controller can support. In Dragonframe, you may use multiple controllers at once, in order to increase the number of total axes.\n\nVirtuals: A configuration where a non-cartesian rig is “virtualized” as a cartesian rig, so that it can be programmed in 3D space. This is described in detail in the User Guide.\n\nAim Point: Orient pan/tilt towards a point in 3D space. Requires a rig that can be configured to use virtuals. Also requires DF5 or newer.\n\nCouple Motors: Configure two stepper motor outputs to be driven by one axis in Dragonframe. Requires DF5 or newer.\n\nGo-Motion: Creates blur by moving the camera during an exposure. The rig will back up, start moving, and capture the image while moving through the target frame position. For still images, not live action.\n\nDMX Output: DMX512 output to control lights.\n\nMany devices, including our own, use a VCP (virtual COM port) chip from FTDI to communicate with a computer.The driver situation for this type of device is a little bit messy.\n\nFor Windows, you should not need to install drivers, but you can install the VCP drivers from FTDI if you want.\n\nFor Ubuntu, you do not need to install drivers.\n\nFor macOS 10.9+, you should not install drivers.\n\nOf course, if you install drivers, please restart your system before trying again.\n\nOn macOS, you may still run into issues where the device is not detected. This could be due to another driver from FTDI being present.\n\nLook for this file:\n\n/Library/Extensions/D2xxHelper.kext\n\n(Please note this is from the computer root, not your user location)\n\nIf you have that file, it means another application installed it in order to prevent the VCP drivers from loading. For example, the Kessler kOS software does this.\n\nIf that is installed, you will need to do the following before running Dragonframe:\n\nOpen a Terminal (in Applications | Utilities).\n\nType the following command to unload the D2xxHelper:\n\nsudo kextunload -b com.FTDI.driver.D2xxHelper\n\n(This will ask for your password. It is your computer password. It will not show while you type.)\n\nThen type this command:\n\nsudo kextload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI\n\nAt that point, you can plug in a device, wait about thirty seconds, and it should show in the Scene | Connections screen.\n\nIn order for Dragonframe to work with a third-party motion control system, the third-party must implement one of our communication protocols.\n\nThere are two choices, “DFMoco” and “DMC”. The DFMoco protocol is fairly simple, but it does not support real-time (video) motion control. It can only be used for shoot-move-shoot style stop motion animation or time-lapse.\n\nThe DMC protocol is much more complicated, but it can be used to provide real-time motion control.\n\nThe DFMoco protocol is described in a document that is installed with the software.\n\nThe location is: [Dragonframe Installation Folder]/Resources/Arc Motion Control/DFMoco/DFMoco_Protocol.rtf\n\nThe DMC protocol is defined in this document: DMC-Protocol-2024-08-13.pdf\n\nWe also provide a message parser you can use for the DMC protocol:\n\ndmc_msg.h\n\ndmc_msg.c\n\nYou can also look at the ‘dmc-lite’ implementation of the DMC protocol for more insight into it.\n\nThis is installed with Dragonframe 2024 and newer, at:\n\n[Dragonframe Installation Folder]/Resources/Arc Motion Control/dmc\n\nDitoGear, a motion control company, no longer exists.\n\nWe do not have the expertise to repair any of their equipment, or tell you how to repurpose it for other uses.\n\nIf you have their DMC-16 adapters, those will also work with our DMC-32 and DMC+ RJ-45 outputs.\n\nIf you are brave or knowledgable, you can try to wire your DitoGear equipment up to our DMC-32 or dmc-lite.\n\nHere is the pinout for single-axis Ditogear devices:\n\nCLK\n\nDIR\n\nSHUTTER\n\nGND\n\nGND\n\nRESERVE\n\nVCC\n\nVCC\n\nHere is the pinout for double-axis Ditogear devices:\n\nPAN CLK\n\nPAN DIR\n\nTILT CLK\n\nGND\n\nGND\n\nTILT DIR\n\nVCC\n\nVCC\n\nPlease try to confirm this information, and be careful when trying to wire things up. We think that the VCC on these pins is not just 5V TTL, but that they are ‘injecting’ a higher voltage/current signal to actually power the motors.\n\nWe recommend getting some RJ45 breakout boards and examining the signals coming out of their controller.\n\nOnce you’ve sorted out the VCC lines, you should be able to align the DMC-32 RJ45 or dmc-lite output with the DitoGear input.\n\nThe signals they are calling “CLK” are what we call “STEP+”. Their “DIR” is our “DIR+”.\n\nFirst of all, every Dragonframe license is perpetual. You are always allowed to use the version of the software that you purchased.\n\nDragonframe 3 licenses can always use any 3.x.x version of the software.\n\nDragonframe 4 licenses can always use any 4.x.x version of the software.\n\nDragonframe 5 licenses can always use any 5.x.x version of the software.\n\nStarting in 2024, we changed the way we are versioning the software and issuing license keys (serial numbers).\n\nNow, whenever you buy a license, you get three years of updates and support. This means that you will be allowed to install any of the updates we release within three years of your purchase. You are also entitled to software support during this time. This three year window of updates and support is the ‘maintenance period’.\n\nWhen the maintenance period ends, you may continue to use any version of the software that was released before the maintenance period ended.\n\nIf you have a Dragonframe account, the license page will show you which version is the latest you can install.\n\nWhat about people who recently purchased a Dragonframe 5 license?\n\nIf you own a Dragonframe 5 license, you will always be able to use any 5.x.x version of the software.\n\nAdditionally, all Dragonframe 5 license holders have a three year maintenance period, starting when they purchased the software.\n\nSo if you purchased the software on June 1, 2023 (as an example), your maintenance period will end on June 1, 2026. This means that you will be able to use Dragonframe 2024.01, for example.\n\nYou can see the maintenance period expiration date in your account’s License page, or through the Find Your License support email.\n\nWhy did we make this change?\n\nGreat question! We have a few reasons.\n\nOne reason is that we found ourselves holding back big features for a long time, in order to have something important for the next big release. For example, we had multi-camera support ready for a long time, but wanted it to be part of Dragonframe 5. The new version system gets rid of the pressure to make sure that each major version number has a certain amount of ‘big’ changes.\n\nAnother reason is support over the long haul. We are a small company. If we released a major version of the software every year, and had users on each version… that becomes a lot of versions that people expect support on, and patches. In the new model, we don’t really update old versions of the software, because everyone will have had three years of free updates.\n\nLastly, it’s actually more fair for customers. In the previous model, the amount of updates you received depended on when you bought the software. If you bought Dragonframe 4 on the day it came out, you would have received 4-5 years of free updates. If you bought it three years after it came out, you would have only received 1-2 years of updates. The new model gives everyone the same time-span for updates.\n\nTax Exemption within the US\n\nIn general, most states allow for tax exemptions for schools, resellers, and some non-profits.\n\nIf you have a tax exemption certificate, you can upload it in your account’s tax setup page. [Tax Setup]\n\nMake sure to select the appropriate state, and to provide an expiration date in the future.\n\nOnce configured, both software and hardware should then be exempt from tax for purchases in that state.\n\nTax Exemption in the EU and UK\n\nIf you have a business VAT number in the EU or the UK, you can provide it in your account’s tax setup page. [Tax Setup]\n\nDigital goods (our software) will be tax exempt if you provide a valid VAT number.\n\nAll physical goods for B2B (business to business) sales are subject to VAT at the time of arrival. They are not exempt. The VAT will be included in the purchase price during checkout.\n\nEU Zero-Rate Tax\n\nAlthough some businesses in the EU are registered for “zero-rate tax”, our store is not able to accommodate that process.\n\nYou shoot some animation, then you export it, and see your hands in the shot. They aren’t there when you play the animation in Dragonframe. What’s going on? Dragonframe always records a video assist and a hi-res separately–even if you are shooting video. So what’s happening is that your video assist frames are fine, but then you are sticking your hand in the shot while Dragonframe is capturing the “high res” frames. You can find further explanation on page 1 of the user guide.\n\nDragonframe gives you three cues to know when shooting is finished:\n\nThe “READY TO CAPTURE” sign at the top disappears while it is busy, and reappears when it is ready.\n\nThe progress bar will appear in the middle of the screen while it is busy.\n\nWhen it is done capturing an image, it plays a small beep sound.\n\nNow, when you export a movie or image sequence, you can choose the source. If you want to make one from your video assist frames, it will look how it did in the animation window.\n\nYou can also review your hi-res images at any point in the Cinematography workspace.\n\nAlso, in the Animation workspace, you can toggle between the video assist frames and the final capture images by pressing the button with four small diamonds in the shape of a larger diamond. This allows you to preview your high-res playback as you animate.\n\nOne reason there is a separate “high-res” capture source for video is that you can add frame averaging (video sources only), which greatly reduces video noise, and you can save your images in TIFF format instead of JPEG. Also, with very high-resolution cameras (such as 1920×1080 HD or 1600×1200 video cameras) the video assist will be stored at a lower resolution, and the high-resolution captures will be full size.\n\nTags: Hand in shot, Deleted images showing in Export, Export frames don’t match"
