        "text": "If you've dabbled in the world of SNES emulation lately, then you'll perhaps have heard of the term 'FastROM' and are wondering exactly how it relates to your beloved Nintendo system.\n\nThe short answer is that FastROM patches – which are created by fans in a completely unofficial capacity – dramatically improve the performance of specific SNES titles when run via emulation.\n\nThis means games that were often plagued by slowdown back in the day now run smoothly and control more responsively – so it's little wonder that a lot of SNES fans are keen to see as many patches as possible.\n\nWhat Is A FastROM Patch?\n\nIf you're wondering how these patches work, the Super Nintendo was basically created with two ROM modes in mind that took advantage of different CPU speeds. SlowROM runs the CPU at 2.68 MHz, while FastROM runs it at 3.58 Mhz instead. Hackers are therefore patching the ROMs to take advantage of the faster mode and its 33.58% quicker processing times.\n\nAs KandoWontu explains in a Reddit post on the subject, developers back in the day likely opted to ship with the slower mode enabled due to cost, as SlowROM chips were cheaper to manufacture. Because of this, it isn't unusual to find games that were originally written for FastROM banks and that were later converted down and shipped for slower chips.\n\nBut who do we have to thank for these patches? Brazilan coder Vitor Vilela did a lot of early pathfinding in the realm of FastROM patches and has been recently joined by the aforementioned KandoWontu, the talented hacker behind the Star Fox EX Exploration Showcase, who has recently been releasing a bunch of new conversion patches. This means that you can now play a wide range of classic SNES games with faster loading times, less lag, and more responsive controls.\n\nThe hacks should work on both real hardware and most SNES emulators.\n\nHow Do I Use A FastROM Patch?\n\nThe patch itself isn't the complete game and needs to be applied to the game ROM before it will work. You'll need to make sure you have the right ROM for the patch (ROM files are obtained at your own risk – we always advise that you use legal methods to get them), too.\n\nThis isn't an entirely straightforward process, but there's an excellent guide here.\n\nFastROM patched games can be used on SNES emulators, FPGA systems (like MiSTer) and on original SNES / Super Famicom hardware via a flash cartridge.\n\nFastROM Patches: The Complete List\n\nKandoWontu maintains a wonderfully complete list of FastROM games here which also includes download links, but we'll also be detailing which games have patches on this page. (Please note that we won't be hosting links to download the individual patches.)"
