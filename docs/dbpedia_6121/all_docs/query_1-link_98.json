        "text": "Requested in 2005:\n\nI am very impressed with the features integrated in Process Explorer but would like to see an option to display each process CPU affinity in the main window as a column toggle.\n\nNo response.\n\nRequested in 2007:\n\nThanks for superb utilities. My request is to add a column option to process explorer to display CPU affinity. That's it.\n\nNo response.\n\nSimilar discussed in 2013:\n\nIt would be really nice if there were a new Process Performance View Column called Core Usage that would show a sum of the usage over the core that the process is running on.\n\nBasic synopsis: It can't be done.\n\nThreads are what are sent to cores for processing, not processes. Most modern processes have multiple threads.\n\nIf you manually set the affinity for a process, then all threads for the process should stick to a single processor. Since you manually set it, you should know which CPU it's on. ;)\n\nBut if you don't specify, then the thread(s) will be controlled by the OS and underlying processing hardware, and would jump around between processors at a speed that would be unwatchable, and very likely inaccurate by the time it was displayed to you.\n\nPerhaps check out these SU question for more:\n\nHow does a process \"pick\" which core to run on?\n\nWhat are threads, and what do they do in the processor?\n\nAlso, from StackOverflow:\n\nWhat is the difference between a process and a thread?\n\nNow if you wrote the program, you could use the GetCurrentProcessorNumber, which reports the current processor in use by the thread from which the function was called.\n\nUsing this will allow you to make estimations about processor usage by your threads, as you can never be sure where the threads will be one cycle to the next (again, unless you set the affinity on purpose).\n\nMore info:"
