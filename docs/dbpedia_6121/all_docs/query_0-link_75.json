When I tried it I am getting overall cpu usage not cpu usage for one process.\n\nPdhAddCounter(hquery, TEXT(\"\\\\Processor(_Total)\\\\% Processor Time\"),0,&counter);\n\nSo what I do with this line to get cpu usage for particular process? I tried replacing _Total with process name(explorer). At that time I am getting 0 cpu usage. But I checked in resource monitor that opening many windows at a time increased cpu usage upto 20%. Still in log file cpu usage is showing 0.\n\nCan anyone help me with this?\n\nthanks in advance."
