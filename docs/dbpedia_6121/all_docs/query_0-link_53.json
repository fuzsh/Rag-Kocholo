        "text": "Ever since i built a modern PC im consistently disappointed at how every single game stutters randomly and NOTHING i do can fix it\n\nI built a pc with\n\nRyzen 2600\n\n16gb ram\n\nSome gigabyte motherboard\n\nGtx 1080\n\nNVME\n\n60hz monitor\n\nAfter trying EVERYTHING, reinstalling windows, putting games on NVME, XMP on off, countless windows tweaks etc. I figured something must be screwed up. I literally rebuilt the entire PC, Got another Asrock motherboard, got a Ryzen 5600, Got different 16gb ram sticks, different power supply -- THE SAME THING HAPPENS. Tried multiple different 60hz monitors, hdmi cables, same things. I even contacted NVIDIA for warranty to check out my 1080 and replace it, they sent me another thing. Same issue. I tried a gtx 1060, same thing happens.\n\nSo what happens exactly?\n\nMY fps will be awesome, solid 60, but every 60seconds or few minutes, the entire screen will just FREEZE/ Hitch/ stutter and it just feels like shit.\n\nIf I use MSI afterburner and look at frametime, you can see a totally solid bar, but then randomly it will just have a gigantic spike.\n\nVSync on or off, doesnt matter\n\nCap 60fps with rivatuner, doesnt matter.\n\nI'm just about ready to abandon PC gaming and just use consoles cause this shit is so annoying and it doesnt happen on consoles.\n\nPLZ HELP. WHAT DO I DO TO FIX THE STUTTERS? Im sick of throwing money at the issue thinking it will change anythign!!!!\n\nLately:\n\nThe division 2\n\nThe Forest\n\nGears 5\n\nZombie army 4\n\nSerious sam (All)\n\nElden ring\n\nBack 4 blood\n\nAliens firteam elite\n\nList goes on and on..every game..\n\nLOOK at the pic, every game is like this!!! fuck pc gaming??\n\nIs it just impossible to get solid consistent 60fps on pc games or what? Too much to ask in 2023??\n\nNOTE: EVEN IF I LOCK GAMES TO 30FPS I STILL GET THE STUPID SPIKES. What is going on??\n\nNOTE: Its not the temps theyre always way below anything bad.\n\nTHINGS TRIED:\n\nbios:\n\n-XMP on/off\n\n-amd FTPM on/off\n\n-Adding + voltage bumps to memory\n\n-Above 4g decoding on/off\n\n-Resize bar on/off\n\n-Update bios\n\nWindows:\n\n-Manually install amd chipset/windows default\n\n- HW Schedule HAGS on/off\n\n- Nvidia manually update to latest / windows default driver\n\n- Disable / unplug all usb devices except mouse keyboard\n\n- Device manager disable all unnessesary things\n\n- Nvidia shader cache 'unlimited'\n\n- MSI Afterburner disable power monitoring\n\nHardware:\n\n- Manually unplug all LED shit\n\n- Manually unplug all extra USB stuff from motherboard, usb 3.0 shti etc\n\n-Unplug everything from\n\nmotherboard except bare essentails\n\n- Unplug hard drive, all external hard drives, only use NVME with windows\n\nEven thought at one point the issue was just with the power inside my house, so I hoped that eventually when I moved it would be fixed\n\nWell I moved to a new apartment, same issue ofc.\n\nI even made a youtube channel showcasing the issue in various places, I could post way more vids now, i even have a different CPU than i did back then, same issue:\n\nwat else\n\nWhat haven't you changed yet?\n\nSomething is causing the spikes.\n\nInternet (have you tried gaming on a different connection, like 5G data hotspot?)\n\nPeripherals - perhaps you have a faulty keyboard, mouse, USB headset or similar,\n\nPower socket - are you using an old surge protector with the red neon light? They can cause instability.\n\nAre you always reinstalling Windows from the same install media, or did you just reinstall multiple times from the same, potentially corrupt source?\n\nUtilities, software etc - have you ruled out all of those by gaming with the bare minimum of installed drivers and no third-party apps or utilities?\n\nIt sounds like you're about to give up in exasperation but there is absolutely loads you haven't tried yet.\n\nYou'll hear this advice over and over on countless forums when people are troubleshooting: BREADBOARD.\n\nIn other words, start from the bare minimum needed to boot a PC - in your case the bare minimum needed to display a game you're testing. Test each time you add something, whether it's software, internal hardware, or external peripherals. If you can't get the breadboard stable, then take your haunted PC to work or a mate's house to rule out all external factors like power, peripherals, and internet connection. If it turns out you have internet, power, or environmental problems, you'll get the same shit-tastic experience with a console. FIND THE PROBLEM, rather than throwing money at new shit.\n\nok thanks i will start from scratch\n\ncan you suggest a very RELIABLE piece of software that if there are no stutters, then if i encounter stutters elsewhere its just the game?\n\nwhat is the most reliable piece of software to test?\n\nBEcause even in something like Unigen Heaven benchmark, i still see the same stutters..\n\nUnigine Heaven is perfect for benchmarking to test for stutters because it works offline and it's very quick to run. It absolutely shouldn't stutter.\n\nIMO you should clear your CMOS to reset your bios, and do a minimal build with the CPU/RAM/GPU and your boot drive ONLY.\n\nFreshly-downloaded windows onto a USB stick and install that. The only drivers you should update beyond the Windows basic drivers are the motherboard chipset drivers and the Nvidia drivers.\n\nRun heaven, unplug your keyboard, mouse, internet cable - so that literally the only things plugged in are the monitor and the power cable, and the only software you have installed are the two essential drivers and unigine heaven.\n\nIf that stutters, you definitely have a hardware issue - either with the components, your display, or your house electrical circuits. We can troubleshoot further from there by just eliminating things one at a time.\n\nIf that doesn't stutter, something you are plugging in or installing is causing the stutter. Just add things ONE AT A TIME and retest each time - presumably it's very quick to stutter and you don't have to test for long each time to discover what's causing the problem.\n\nHeaven stutters at exactly the same points in the run every time. So it's not stutter free but if it stutters at the exact same points every time then it's normal.\n\nNo, it doesn't, and it's not supposed to.\n\nIf it stutters you have a problem - even if it's a minor problem like your vsync being imperfect and skipping the odd frame (59.94Hz display being driven at 60Hz for example), you still have a problem.\n\nIntel HD graphics from a decade ago can run Heaven without any stutter at all. Sure, the framerate isn't great, but it's completely consistent even with a flawed IGP like the HD4600 on abandoned platforms with outdated drivers. I sell or donate i7 3rd and 4th gen platforms and I use Heaven to test. Even the HD2500 from 2012 is fine.\n\nNo, it doesn't, and it's not supposed to.\n\nIf it stutters you have a problem - even if it's a minor problem like your vsync being imperfect and skipping the odd frame (59.94Hz display being driven at 60Hz for example), you still have a problem.\n\nIntel HD graphics from a decade ago can run Heaven without any stutter at all.

Been using Unigine Heaven since the Nvidia 200 series and it has always stuttered at certain points. The most consistent for me is when the camera comes over the castle wall at night and points towards the village.\n\nAnyway, stutterhelps, I've watched through your videos. Only thing I can think of is that you're noticing the stutters because you're playing at 60 hz. Looks like the stutters you notice are only one frame. I wonder if you got a higher Hertz monitor with Gsync or Freesync that you wouldn't see those stutters anymore. I game at 60hz and I'm pretty sure I've always got a stutter every once in a while in every game.\n\nI absolute hate these stutters..\n\nI really noticed my stutters getting much better with the 8700K+ -Ryzen 3000 gen systems -- before that 6700k, ryzen 7 1800x, 7820x all had load in hitching like that to some extent. Before that my favorite bang around games (like far cry 5) were borderline unplayable.\n\nTo oversimplify things a bit, the stutter is fundamentally caused by the primary game thread getting blocked for a few miliseconds- this is usually done by:\n\n1. Too much asset loading and not enough bandwidth -- usually just bad coding at the game level and the game's primary thread realizes it needs things at the last milisecond and hitches( far cry 5, hogwarts legacy etc.). Throwing more bandwith and lower latency at the software can help (either through overclocking or software tuning like turning off VBS etc.)\n\n2. Something interrupting the OS -- this is usually peripherals and sometimes (though more rarely) background software -- network and usb devices that have badly coded and sometimes aggressive drivers that throw disruptive IO (like randomly waking up from suspend) at random times etc.\n\nGenerally to fix stuttering:\n\n- unplug or disable all unnecessary USB / devices in the device manager, turn off selective suspend for these (especially NICs)\n\n- tune OS by disabling as much background software and services, disabling CFG and VBS security nannies\n\n- tune Ram Timings, Speed, and power settings (gear down, timings, TRFC lowering can help -- in general more ram bandwith and lower latency = exponentially less noticeable stutters and more consistent fps)\n\n- enable software tricks like render ahead one frame and fps cap below monitors refresh rate (for high refresh systems) -- stuff like freesync and vsync can help ALOT at the expense of latency.\n\nHeaven has stuttered for me 100% every time heading into the dark area where the casks are. For a decade. I stopped using it and switched to Valley which has never stuttered and has long draw distances with more terrain and effects. However:\n\nHi,\n\nOnly gpu benchmark or testing app worth beans is\n\nUnigine Superposition\n\nHeaven is way to old to go by anymore\n\nUnigine Superposition 1.1 Download\n\nBrand new GPU stress-testing tool from UNIGINE. It also features interactive VR experience with support for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.\n\nYou could also use blender opendata and have it test cpu or gpu rendering this should be the standard for clocks stability\n\nBlender Open Data — blender.org\n\nYes, I've seen zero stutters in Superposition and it's DX12 whereas Valley is DX11 if that matters to anyone. I finally bought the damn thing recently so I can loop it for GPU stability testing. It loads a modern GPU more heavily than Valley (higher power use) and with my current 5600+6800XT setup in a 1080p window, Valley was getting CPU-bound at max settings. Not Superposition.\n\nCould be bad PSU.\n\nCheck your RAM tune too. https://github.com/integralfx/MemTestHelper/blob/oc-guide/DDR4 OC Guide.md\n\nSome games don't like Ryzen in general, or any other latency sensitive game, unless you have 3DVCache version or very good RAM setup.\n\nUse NVCP to limit your frame rate to 3 below max refresh rate, then set latency mode to ultra.\n\nIf you have reflex options in game, turn them on+boost.\n\nRegular stutters can be caused by periodic system activity, uninstall software you don't need, and check device manager for things you can disable that are redundant. E.g. onboard sound if you use a sound card.\n\nDisabling virtualization based security is also a good option if you game.\n\nStuff like 3rd party programs for FPS monitoring can cause performance issues, use the built in NVIDIA driver one, disable shadowplay if you don't use it, and consider using NVCleaninstall to disable telemetry and bloat etc. https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-nvcleanstall/\n\nhttps://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10 This is also good software for general performance and security.\n\nhttps://geekuninstaller.com/download As is this for debloating.\n\nhttps://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts using this to block ads/malware connections at root level is also a good idea.\n\nPlus, I'd suggest getting a better monitor and filling out your system specs."
