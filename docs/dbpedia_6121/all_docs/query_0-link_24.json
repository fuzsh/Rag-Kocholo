My issue is that i can't run some games at a constant 120 so i chose a lower refresh rate in game that matches what my GPU is more comfortable to maintain for whatever certain game. I know i have Freesync working but i like to hold stable FPS not have it fluctuating.\n\nExample, Far Cry 6 has the option to set 85HZ which is good, if i could i would run it at 90HZ but there is no option for 90HZ it jumps from 85 to 120, same in the Windows 10 refresh rate list it offers 85hz and the next is 120hz.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to run at 90HZ, square in the middle of 60 and 120, 85 is close and is fine but my ocd would like it to be 90.\n\nI'm trying to find a way to make 90HZ appear is the refresh rate list of Windows 10 so then games can also be set to 90HZ.\n\nIt should be possible via CRU. Although I'm not sure if your monitor won't have a problem with it, but you can always try.\n\nMy monitor is 165HZ but i run it at 120HZ because i think that is high enough for my tastes.

It's super easy and once you create it, your game should have it as an available option. Rocket League is a bit opinionated about it sometimes though the rest of my games seem to like 80 Hz or 100 Hz on my 144 Hz monitor. And RL figures it out after a restart or two. If you use dxvk for the few games that get a benefit from replacing DX11 with Vulkan, I have significant problems choosing these custom resolutions if you change them after setting up dxvk, so be aware of that for the Assassin's Creed: Ody/Ori/Uni players out there.\n\nYou don't even strictly need CRU, you can create and test custom resolutions and refresh rates through Nvidia Control Panel. Well worth a try.\n\nI can't speak for NVIDIA since I haven't used an NVIDIA GPU as my main one in a while, but I find CRU to be much more reliable and configurable than the custom resolution feature that AMD has.\n\nI also use it to adjust monitor timings, which can sort of fix the stupid VRAM downclock issue my GPU has while keeping 8-bit color and 100Hz refresh rate. I can even overclock my monitor to 120Hz with it, though the experience is worse than 60Hz.\n\nAlso, if you like non-native resolutions, the dev for CRU has another app called SRE which lets you add any scaled resolutions that you want. I'd recommend using GPU scaling and either RSR or whatever NVIDIA's equivalent is.\n\nMy monitor is 165HZ but i run it at 120HZ because i think that is high enough for my tastes. My issue is that i can't run some games at a constant 120 so i chose a lower refresh rate in game that matches what my GPU is more comfortable to maintain for whatever certain game.

Leave your monitor at 165Hz with g-sync compatible enabled. Set the fps limit to 90 fps and enable vsync. Your GPU will max out at 90 fps and your monitor will match that number"
