For all the info, see Graeme Devine's .plan file, quoted below:\n\n<font face=\"courier\"]Name: Graeme Devine\n\nEmail: zaphod@idsoftware.com\n\nDescription: Designer / Project Manager\n\nProject:\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nMac stuff.\n\nThe OS X build is looking good. On my G4 dual 800 with a GeForce 3 card I get 90fps in game, while on my P3 dual 800 with a GeForce 3 I get 30fps on the same settings.\n\nI've been running it on my machine without problem, in game and out. However, I'm using a developer build of 10.1 (5G48), and I've not tested across anything else. I'll continue to do that tomorrow before putting out a general public release.\n\nMeanwhile, if you want to play the BLEEDING edge client, you can grab it from my iTools public folder (graemedevine). You'll need to have downloaded and installed a full PC build because this is just the app, so this limits the # of you that can play it to experts and desperate types.. I've been updating the build here for people to test on since I only have a few OS X machines here to play with.\n\nPlease ONLY send bug reports on this build to me (zaphod@idsoftware.com) and try to include a clear step by step way to replicate the error you have. Please also include the OS X build you have running and what kind of video card you have installed.</font>\n\nWow, his dual G4 really leaves that dual P3 in the dust. Can't wait to give this a shot.\n\nFPS\n\nAlthough TV and movies have a framerate around 30 fps, that is only ok because of a \"blurring\" effect between frames.\n\nFluorescent lights that have a refresh rate of less than 60-ish appear to flicker. This shows how you can see more than your TV throws at you and why high refresh rates on monitors are important.\n\nThe trained eye can actually discriminate between frame rates up to around 80+ fps, consciously. I have heard rumors (and I believe them) that you can detect more sub-consciously. You detect this in the form of fatigue. Supposedly, reading text at 70 fps or less leads to fatigue while above that may not as quickly. I am not sure if this is true since low refresh rates are also characteristic of high resolution and very small text.\n\nThat is what I know about that.\n\nAlso, great results with the FPS vs the P3. Not all that surprising that we beat them but by such a degree is nice to see.\n\nCorrections.\n\nMovies are 24 fps. This is why some movies look god awful on straight lines with DVD if you don't have progressive scan. Moire patterns are created because of the odd sequencing of fields to turn 24 fps into 30 fps.\n\nTV is 60 fields per second which ends up being 30 frames (NTSC). PAL is 50 fields or 25 frame per second. However PAL has slightly higher resolution than NTSC.\n\nAnyone when spending enough time training their eyes can see framerates well in excess of 90 fps. It takes time but it can be done.\n\nWhile 30 fps is enough visual content to convey motion to the brain it isn't enough to give it the full sensation of movement. You either need a much higher framerate, roughly double... or you need motion blur.\n\nHigher refresh rates are great for your eyes and low ones will fatigue them quickly. Don't believe me? Get a good monitor and set your desktop to 1280x1024 at 60hz. Use the computer for 3 hours straight. Now do the same thing tmrw with a refresh rate set at 110 (or even 90). Its like the difference between reading text off the tv (60hz) and paper (110hz).\n\nRe: 30fps?\n\nOkay you loosers, listen up.\n\nThe human eye can only handle about roughly 60 fps, mkay. And if the TV would only show 30 fps, the whole image would appear to flicker when the frame change. That is why most TV double and tripple the refresh rate. This means that if a TV is 60Hz it first draws every second line of pixels and then draws the other half, this removes all flickering. The TV uses no blurr effects, though most TV-games do this to keep up the frame rate, since most TV-games got goofy processors. The tv is old, and **** by todays standards compared with todays high resolution computer screens. The tv uses a resolution of; 640*480 NTSC, 720*576 PAL. Also the TV-screen most offenly can display this whole area and cuts out the edges. TV-game developers uses a 50 pixel safe border around the screen, because this is how much the tv cuts out!!!\n\nI know this since I've developed TV-games myself. Playstation2 is nice and all but since the TV can only display this rotten resolutions, one will never experience as nice graphics on a tely as on a computer, unless of course they begin using other standards than PAL or NTSC.\n\nAnd higher frame rates are always good, gives you less processor hick-ups.\n\nare you braindead?\n\nIt is incredible to see, that nobody of you guys can differ between refresh rate and fps...ok, here's the real deal.\n\nrefresh rate:\n\nis a number in Hertz (like 60Hz or 85Hz). this stands for the number of times, the display draws the image that is sent to the input of the display device.\n\nfps:\n\nis frames (different images) that are generated by the computer per second when using 3d, every frame must be generated fully by the 3d engine. on 2d applications there is usually no fps, because you only change parts of an image, like the character.\n\nok, now this:\n\nwhen you hit pause on a game, there is no movement, agree?\n\nNo movement, no changes. No changes, no frames have to change. -> the frame rate is ZERO. but still, there is an image shown, with the REFRESH RATE that is set at your computer, e.g. 85Hz. so what you see is 0 fps at 85 Hz.\n\nif you watch a dvd, you will get let's say, 30fps for a NTSC movie. ok? but if you watch it on your computer with the screen set to 85Hz what will happen?\n\nthis: the dvd image is sent to the graphic adapter with a rate of 30 fps the graphics adapter sends the actual image received until a new frame arrives, with a rate of 85 cycles per second. if the frame changes while the image is displayed, the image will change after the preceeding is finished drawing. so sometimes a frame lasts for two cycles and sometimes for three. (85Hz / 30 fps = 2.83)\n\nwhat about the frame rate?\n\nyou play a 3d game at let's say 60fps and to compare also at 5fps.\n\nyou move your character from the left to the right side. this takes 2 seconds. at 60fps, 120 images will be created that are shown in these two seconds. the character will move very smoothly .\n\nthe same done with 5fps will generate 10 images!\n\nthe movement is very jumpy, more like 5 different looking pictures shown per second.\n\nif you have set your screen to 85Hz, there is no difference of the image quality overall. your eyes do not hurt at 5fps. it may look like ****, but it's only a matter of painted frames per second, like in a disney movie. every movement ocurring at over 20-25fps looks smooth to our eye. everything below that starts to look jumpy. but 15fps is still acceptable.\n\nthis is a fact.\n\ngreetings, the wizard.\n\nRe: are you braindead?\n\nAbsolutely nothing new here. I tried to explain this in my post, but obviously some did not understand. Refresh Rate and fps is two totally different thingies and got nothing to do with one another.\n\nAnd also you said that 15 fps is acceptable! Well that certainly is not true in my book. When I started playing 3D-games on macintosh I started out with a 512k-machine and a PLUS. I've been playing marathon on an fx (40Mhz), doom, wolfenstein and Duke Nukem and all that shiii. I actually thouht back then that 8 fps was acceptable. But now when I've gotten used too at least 25 fps in a game, I can not play on those old setups anymore, it just too jerky.\n\nOriginally posted by thewizard\n\nIt is incredible to see, that nobody of you guys can differ between refresh rate and fps...ok, here's the real deal.\n\nrefresh rate:\n\nis a number in Hertz (like 60Hz or 85Hz). this stands for the number of times, the display draws the image that is sent to the input of the display device.\n\nfps:\n\nis frames (different images) that are generated by the computer per second when using 3d, every frame must be generated fully by the 3d engine. on 2d applications there is usually no fps, because you only change parts of an image, like the character.\n\nok, now this:\n\nwhen you hit pause on a game, there is no movement, agree?\n\nNo movement, no changes.
