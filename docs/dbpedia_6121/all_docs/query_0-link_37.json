They didn't make it past the first round, and the tournament is now concluded.\n\nBMO (abbreviated from \"Be MOre\", phonetically spelled \"Beemo\"), also referred to as Moe Mastro \"Llabtoof\" Giovanni Jr., and called the \"King of Ooo\" in the future, is one of the main characters of Adventure Time, as well as the titular main protagonist of the Distant Lands episode of the same name. BMO is a living prototype video game console system, portable electrical outlet, computer, music player, VCR, video player, video editor, roommate, camera, alarm clock, toaster, flashlight, strobe light, skateboarder, soccer player, tape player, chef, detective and friend who is owned by Finn. They make their appearance in the title scene of the Theme Song of every episode of Adventure Time (excluding the Stakes and Elements miniseries, which have their own theme songs, and the theme song of \"Come Along With Me\") just as Finn and Jake pound their fists together. BMO is characterized as a loyal, trusting and helpful robot who is protective of Finn and Jake.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat functions does BMO serve in 'Adventure Time'?\n\nBMO, a character in 'Adventure Time', is a multifunctional entity. As a living prototype video game console system, it also serves as a portable electrical outlet, computer, music player, and video player. BMO's capabilities extend to being a video editor, roommate, camera, alarm clock, toaster, flashlight, and strobe light. It even takes on roles such as a skateboarder, soccer player, tape player, chef, detective, and friend. Owned by Finn, BMO is protective of both Finn and Jake and is featured in the title scene of every Adventure Time episode.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is the meaning behind BMO's name?\n\nThe name BMO, from Adventure Time, stands for 'Be More', reflecting the character's diverse roles and abilities. As a 'one-of-a-kind' MO bot, BMO is a living video game console and a companion to Finn.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is the significance of BMO's title 'New King of Ooo'?\n\nBMO, known as the 'New King of Ooo', is a legendary figure in the Adventure Time universe's future. Living atop Mount Cragdor, BMO is surrounded by relics from the past. This title is used by BMO to introduce himself to travelers a thousand years later. BMO also shares stories of the Gum War and the battle against GOLB with Shermy and Beth, reinforcing his legendary status.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nIs BMO a living entity or a machine?\n\nBMO, from Adventure Time, is a living video game console system with multiple functionalities. Owned by Finn, BMO serves as a portable outlet, computer, music and video player, video editor, camera, alarm clock, toaster, flashlight, skateboarder, soccer player, tape player, chef, detective, and friend. BMO is more than a machine, exhibiting traits such as pleasantness, musicality, and attentive listening.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nDoes BMO have a gender in 'Adventure Time'?\n\nIn 'Adventure Time', BMO is a genderless character. While BMO has been addressed with both male and female pronouns, these instances are part of its imaginative play, not indicative of a specific gender or multiple personality disorder.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nWhen Patrick McHale was preparing a short animation for Cartoon Network, he had a robot character named \"Raye\" (or \"R.A.Y.E.\") for that purpose, which Pendleton Ward and McHale both loved.[1] However, after Adventure Time got picked up, Raye was redesigned and became BMO.[2]\n\nBMO's voice was originally to be similar to a computer-synthesized voice, but as a result of a suggestion from Ward, Niki Yang's natural voice (who also voiced Lady Rainicorn) with some adjustments became the voice of BMO.[3] As a result, BMO speaks with a Korean accent. Earlier voice actors for the character included Dee Bradley Baker (voice of Cinnamon Bun) and Thurop Van Orman (voice of the Tree Witch).\n\nAppearance[]\n\nBMO looks like a Macintosh computer with Game Boy Color buttons and Atari 2600 controllers. He also shares some traits with a Vectrex.\n\nBMO is a medium-sized teal/blue-green gaming device, sometimes appearing with one or two controllers attached to them. When not being played, they have an 8-bit face.\n\nBMO is about 12.25 inches wide and 20.1 inches tall.[citation needed]\n\nBMO's front includes an arrow pad, a floppy disk slot, multiple different shape buttons, two controller sockets, and of course the face, or screen. There is also a compartment with a red button hidden underneath the yellow D-pad. BMO's operating system known as BMOS (abbreviated from \"Be More Operating System\")[citation needed] is somewhat similar to that of a Windows/Macintosh hybrid computer, as seen in \"Be More,\" with a graphical interface and drag-and-drop file manager.\n\nOn BMO's sides, the letters \"BMO\" are printed, indicating their name. Their arms emerge from the center of the \"O\"s. There are also what appear to be holes for speakers at the tops of BMO's sides. While given their position, they likely function as microphones as well.\n\nBMO's back contains a battery compartment which holds 2 AA batteries, first seen in \"BMO Lost.\" Normally, the battery door is shown attached with 4 screws. However, in \"BMO Lost,\" it is shown with a tab at the top instead. There is also a slot which can be used for playing videotapes as seen in \"Holly Jolly Secrets Part I.\"\n\nBMO's default controllers highly resemble Atari 2600 game console ones, as they feature a single joystick and red button. They in \"Too Young\" slightly resemble Sega Genesis controllers for their button layout and handling design. An interesting note about this is that, in reality, both the Atari 2600 and the Sega Genesis have shared an identical input device. This means that both controllers can be hooked up to the same device without issue.\n\nBMO is sometimes seen with two slots to plug in controllers and sometimes with a compartment on that spot that opens up to where controllers can be plugged in.\n\nInside BMO, there is a gold heart with a face, as shown in \"Be More.\" Pinned to the heart is a golden medal. Next to the heart is a small scroll tied with a red ribbon. This is likely a reference to the gifts given to the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, symbolizing a brain, a heart, and courage.\n\nPersonality and Character Traits[]\n\nAccording to Finn, \"BMO does weird junk when no one is around.\" This is proven in \"Five Short Graybles,\" where BMO talks to their reflection in the mirror, naming it Football, and pretended to be a \"little living boy.\" In \"BMO Noire,\" BMO acts out a film noir fantasy complete with giving names, voices, and dialogue to a number of animals and an inanimate object in the house. The way BMO interacts with their own reflection in \"Five Short Graybles,\" as well as the animals in \"BMO Noire,\" Most believe this is BMO's hyperactive imagination, though; ALLMO says positively of BMO, \"…Your imagination lets you see the world how it could be.\"\n\nBMO claims to not have emotions, but this is seemingly inaccurate. In \"Donny\", BMO says, \"I am incapable of emotion, but you are making me chafed!\" BMO shows signs of annoyance in \"Too Young\" when Jake uses BMO as an ottoman. BMO demonstrates independence when they refused to turn down the music even after Jake tells them to. Although they are both robots, BMO refuses Neptr's request to hang out more in \"BMO Noire\" by saying, \"No, Neptr, I am not like you.\" In \"Davey,\" BMO cries while Finn shaves his head to disguise himself as Davey. BMO also cries when Jake initially refuses to invite Morty Rogers, an idol of BMO's, to dinner.\n\nBMO is very protective of Finn and Jake. In \"Incendium,\" BMO says, \"If anyone tries to hurt Finn, I will kill them.\" In \"Guardians of Sunshine,\" BMO refuses to let Finn and Jake enter the video game world saying, \"No! It's a far too dangerous, incredible adventure for you! That's final!\"\n\nBMO often acts to maintain the harmony of friendship between Finn and Jake. In \"Video Makers,\" BMO edits the film Finn and Jake make in a way to resolve their dispute over the film's artistic direction, even composing a song for them. In \"Card Wars,\" BMO refuses to play such games with Jake because Jake cannot deal with losing. When Finn asks for advice on Jake's attitude, BMO recommends that Finn play to lose.\n\nBMO likes a number of games and even a few sports. BMO has been seen playing video games in \"BMO Noire.\" BMO has also been seen skateboarding in \"Card Wars (episode)\" and \"Time Sandwich.\" BMO also once had to be picked up from soccer in the episode \"In Your Footsteps.\"\n\nBMO likes scrambled eggs, as shown in \"Her Parents,\" and hot chocolate, as shown in \"Video Makers\" and \"Holly Jolly Secrets Part II.\" In \"Five More Short Graybles,\" BMO is shown to \"drink\" tea while teaching Football manners. There, BMO attempts to drink the tea with their pinkie finger up, but Football does not. BMO drinks, again and again, resulting in self-electrocution. BMO has never been seen actually consuming food. Despite this, BMO can cook, and makes dinner for Finn and Jake in \"Little Dude (episode).\" In \"The Creeps\" BMO reveals enjoyment in taking nice pictures. BMO also likes to dance.\n\nBMO is shown to be ticklish. This is seen when giggling after Princess Bubblegum plays BMO's circuits like a keyboard in \"What Was Missing.\" BMO also reacts to being tickled by a feather while sleeping in \"Guardians of Sunshine\" and when it laughs and wriggles as its foot is being nibbled by a bear in \"In Your Footsteps.\"\n\nBMO's most prized possession is their controller, as it is one of the objects the Door Lord steals in \"What Was Missing.\" In \"Furniture & Meat,\" BMO is shown to like pretend-sword fighting with Neptr at the start of the episode.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nOne of the many functions BMO has is the ability to send users into a video game through their main-brain-game-frame by pressing a button located under their d-pad. By doing this, users are able to play the game in a virtual reality where they can physically complete objectives, with the possible risk of actual death. This process can also be reversed, and things within the game can be transported into the real world. BMO also possesses several attachments which allows them to perform various tasks aside from video games. This includes the ability to put up a holographic display of their screen to support a wider audience. BMO also possesses editing software for film creation, but they have a personal choice regarding the footage that is actually used to make up their films.\n\nIn \"Conquest of Cuteness\" BMO reveals a built-in camera with the flash emerging from the top left of their head while their screen works as the lens. In \"The Creeps,\" BMO uses a built-in flash device that helps them take pictures, as well as print pictures and documents out their rear. BMO can function as an alarm clock, which is set to Finn's bath time, and is seen in \"Holly Jolly Secrets Part I.\" In this episode, BMO demonstrates that they can insert VHS tapes into their back, and display the video on their screen. In \"Incendium,\" BMO uses their BMO Cam, which records live video feed. In \"Daddy's Little Monster\" and \"What Was Missing,\" BMO is shown to be able to charge or power electronic devices such as Jake's video phone and a noodle cooker. However, this function appears to exhaust BMO, likely because they use their own energy to charge and power the devices. BMO is also able to be used as a security system as seen in \"Another Five More Short Graybles\" when Cinnamon Bun is sneaking into the Tree House to take Jake's nightlight. BMO spots the intruder, and unleashes a deafening and overwhelming alarm crying \"STRANGER!\" while producing a blinding red light. Once Jake Jr. is able to disarm them, BMO innocently says \"Excuse me.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Hug Wolf,\" BMO is shown to have a blinding \"Strobe Light Mode.\" BMO is also capable of performing the devastating Combo Move from the game \"Guardians of Sunshine\" in real life. The episode, \"In Your Footsteps,\" reveals that BMO plays soccer, and shows BMO wearing a red jersey, red cleats, and while covered in dirt and mud. In \"Card Wars\" and \"Time Sandwich,\" BMO demonstrates their skill in skateboarding and performs various tricks and jumps. BMO is also able to perform a sneak attack known as the BMO Chop, which he states to a victim of the strike, \"If this were a real attack, you would be dead.\" In \"Burning Low,\" it is seen that BMO can connect with other computers or devices for live video chat.\n\nBMO is shown to know how to use a bow and arrows in \"Furniture and Meat\" when they shoot the pipe of hot melted gold away from Finn and Jake, killing a guard and saving Finn and Jake.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFinn and Jake[]\n\nBMO lives in the Tree Fort along with Finn and Jake and is used as their game console and many other electronic devices such as their video cassette player and computer. BMO is present during Finn's performance of Best Friends In The World for the Door Lord's magic door. In the song, Finn sings \"You are my best friends in the world,\" referring to Jake, Bonnibel, Marceline, and BMO. They are loyal to Finn, as they said they will kill anyone who tries to hurt Finn, as seen in \"Incendium.\" Also seen in \"Video Makers,\" BMO does not side with either Finn or Jake. BMO cries when Finn shaves off his hair to be \"Davey,\" sobbing that his \"beauty is destroyed\". In \"The More You Moe, The Moe You Know (Part II)\" Finn states \"BMO is our (Finn and Jake's) best friend\". In \"Imaginary Resources\" Jake refers to BMO as his and Finn's \"son,\" implying he sees BMO as his adoptive child. In \"Come Along With Me,\" BMO holds a small Jake and sings Time Adventure to him, proclaiming \"I wrote this song for my son Jake!\"\n\nMarceline[]\n\nIt seems that Marceline and BMO have a fairly friendly relationship, as she is seen playing them in \"Evicted!\" and commenting on how she thinks they're cute. Also in \"What Was Missing,\" Marceline assists BMO and proceeds to call them \"baby.\" in \"Ketchup,\" Marceline and BMO hang out and tell each other stories.\n\nLorraine[]\n\nIn \"BMO Noire,\" BMO mentions that Lorraine is \"red hot like pizza supper.\" Furthermore, Lorraine also mentions that the loot is in their \"secret grown-up kissing spot\" at the end of the episode, thus implying that at one point in time they had a relationship. This might be taken as an indication that BMO finds Lorraine attractive. However, the entire episode hints that the plot of \"BMO Noire\" is nothing but a play created by BMO's imagination. So, it is possible that their relationship exists only in BMO's fantasy. It is also possible that BMO is not attracted to Lorraine and the attraction/relationship is fictional like the detective persona that BMO created for themselves.\n\nAir (Bubble)[]\n\nAir (Bubble) is a pal that BMO met in the episode \"BMO Lost.\" After an adventure to help BMO get home through hard times with a baby named Sparkle (whom BMO had named Ricky), Bubble confesses that it is in love with BMO and proposes they get married, which BMO gladly accepts. Sadly, Jake decided to pop the bubble, making it now Air. BMO cries thinking that their love is lost but then air speaks to BMO and tells them that he will always love them. BMO claps and seems to have forgotten the previous tragedy, and after some time it would seem their relationship has subsided when BMO wonders about growing and asks him but gets no reply.\n\nSparkle[]\n\nSparkle (Ricky) appears in the episode \"BMO Lost.\" This baby was lost and separated from his mother, so BMO decides to name the baby \"Ricky\" and bring him along on the adventure of all three characters, BMO, Air (Bubble), and Sparkle (Ricky), trying to find their home. Sparkle is later rediscovered by his mother and taken to his rightful home.\n\nMoe[]\n\nMoe is BMO's creator, as shown in the episode \"Be More.\" He created BMO because he wanted BMO to take care of his son, but he \"never ended up dating any women.\" Moe created BMO so they could \"Be More.\" Unlike a number of artificially created characters in the series (such as Lemongrab or Goliad), BMO is shown to be on good terms with their creator. The two embraced shortly after Moe fixed BMO's operating system informedly than revealing his creation's family in an underground civilization of happy MOs.\n\nNeptr[]\n\nIt appears that Neptr and BMO have a fairly good relationship and that Neptr is happy to be around them. In \"BMO Noire,\" Neptr suggests that the two should \"hang out more.\" BMO declines, saying, \"I'm not like you.\" This suggests that they feel coldly towards Neptr, and perhaps superior, even with their similarities in that both of them are machines. In \"Furniture and Meat,\" BMO and Neptr are seen playing \"Robin Hood\" together, with BMO as Robin Hood and Neptr as the Sheriff of Nottingham. When Neptr asks if he can be Friar Tuck, BMO says no, then draws on his face with a marker. Once again, this shows that BMO is not always kind to Neptr. However, in \"Sad Face,\" they seem to be friends.\n\n[]\n\nFootball is the shadow version of BMO when talking to themselves in the mirror. During this scene, BMO is a \"little living boy\" while Football is a robot. As seen in \"Five Short Graybles,\" BMO purposefully only plays with Football when Finn and Jake are not around. In \"Five More Short Graybles,\" Football claims to be a \"real baby girl,\" and BMO tries to teach Football manners. In \"Football,\" Football transfers to the real world by the agreement by BMO. Football likes the real world and doesn't want to go back to Football's world. This makes BMO upset. Even though BMO has been mean with Football and Football betrayed BMO, BMO still loves Football.\n\nAMO[]\n\nBMO and AMO were not on the best terms in the short time they knew each other, even to the point of violence. BMO is not friends with AMO, and held AMO's final bullet in place, pushing him off the cliff. BMO then took a moment of silence and needed to process the encounter.\n\nIn \"Orb\" when Finn, Jake and BMO are put into the nightmare from Nightmare Princess, BMO's nightmare involved AMO, implying that the events involving AMO's supposed demise were traumatic.\n\nEpisode Appearances[]\n\nMajor Appearances[]\n\nMinor Appearances[]\n\nMentioned[]\n\n\"Marceline's Closet\"\n\n\"Hot to the Touch\"\n\n\"Return to the Nightosphere\"\n\n\"Mystery Dungeon\n\n\"The Pajama War\"\n\n\"Walnuts & Rain\"\n\nHistory[]\n\nBMO, on a mission to terraform Mars, is intercepted by \"Olive\", a service droid, who takes them across the universe to the Drift, a huge failing space station. BMO meets Y4, a rabbit-like scavenger girl, and Mr M, secretly Martin Mertens, Finn's father, during which they become a local legend and foil a plot to steal the Drifts power, masterminded by a biohacked human refugee named Hugo. BMO returns to Earth on a space lard, crash landing in Ooo and meeting a young Finn and Jake, who they would live with for years to come.\n\nBMO makes a cameo in the episode \"Evicted!\" being played by Marceline while Finn and Jake are house-hunting. In \"Business Time,\" Finn and Jake play Adventure Master and Pro Football 1861 on them. They are later seen in the episode \"My Two Favorite People.\" In \"The Witch's Garden,\" Finn plays a game as they ask Jake how he got his magical powers. BMO also appears in \"What is Life?\" when Jake throws a garbage bag of butter on Finn, and in the episode \"Donny,\" one of their controllers is smashed in half. BMO claims to not have emotions, but Donny angers them by breaking a controller and throwing it at BMO. In \"Rainy Day Daydream,\" they show a bored Finn and Jake a new game, \"Conversation Parade.\"\n\nBMO appears again in \"Slow Love\" where they act like a rebellious kid, refusing to turn down their music when Jake tells them. BMO is then hit with a newspaper and told to have a timeout in a corner. BMO was then pummeled and battered when Snorlock started dancing with lady snails while the treehouse was on its back, but was apparently unharmed and returned to play music at the end of the episode when Snorlock was kissing his new girlfriend.\n\nIn \"Power Animal,\" BMO unintentionally distracts Jake with songs. They later eat lunch together and Jake tells BMO to hold his sandwich. BMO later fixes the well overhang that leads to the gnome's underground hideout that Jake had demolished while entering.\n\nIn \"Guardians of Sunshine,\" it is revealed BMO has a button hidden under their control pad that allow people to be transported into one of their games. However, they do not allow Finn and Jake inside any of their games, claiming it's too dangerous of an adventure. Despite this warning, Finn and Jake trick BMO by tickling them with a feather before pressing their button while they are sleeping. BMO later appears when Finn and Jake exit the game. While trying to tear a bomba out of the game's interface, they make a hole in it. BMO is then attacked by Sleepy Sam, Hunny Bunny, and Bouncy Bee for imprisoning them in the game. After Finn performs a combo move and destroys the monsters, BMO scolds them for going into the game and starts doing the combo move on them.\n\nIn \"Video Makers,\" BMO serves as Finn and Jake's cameraperson, filming random pieces of footage around the Land of Ooo with a video camera attached to their head at Finn and Jake's request, before they decide to make a real movie and argue about what kind of movie it will be. BMO, as their camera operator, witnesses their arguments, and instead of using the footage they captured for the movie, they make their own animation while singing a song about how Finn and Jake should forget their argument and make up. At the end of the episode, BMO says Jake's favorite line throughout the episode, \"Check, please!\"\n\nIn the episode \"Conquest of Cuteness,\" Finn and Jake call BMO over to get a camera to take pictures of the Cuties, but it turns out BMO is a camera, even though in the episode \"Video Makers,\" BMO has a video camera strapped to their head. It is possible, however, that BMO's built-in camera only takes pictures.\n\nIn the episode \"Too Young,\" BMO asks about Finn's date with Princess Bubblegum and does not tell Jake where the key is to the Wizard Tower in the video game. When Jake is trying to cheer Finn up when Princess Bubblegum jokingly \"dumped\" him, Jake puts both of his feet on BMO, using them as an ottoman, which annoys BMO.\n\nBMO makes an appearance in \"Fionna and Cake\" in the opening and is later seen being played by Cake. Their appearance remains the same, supporting that they have no gender.\n\nIn the episode \"What Was Missing,\" BMO has their controller stolen by the Door Lord and serves as a musical instrument during \"I'm Just Your Problem.\" Marceline also used them to power a stove, showing that they are also a portable electrical outlet.\n\nIn the episode \"The Creeps,\" they were in the mystery party when Finn and Jake came in the house. Their mystery name was Professor Pants. After the light went down and returned, BMO and Jake went to the basement to get some candles, but BMO was \"killed\" by the \"ghost.\" At the end of the episode, they are discovered by Finn in Lady Rainicorn's body, being in the prank with Jake and the others.\n\nBMO appears in \"Incendium\" watching over Finn while Jake was looking for another love interest for Finn.\n\nBMO reappears in \"Five Short Graybles\" under the \"Sight\" segment of the episode (see article subsection \"Football\" below for more info).\n\nBMO makes another appearance in \"Beyond this Earthly Realm\" when they amuse Finn with fart noises. They also play Finn's favorite nursery song, \"Three Baby Spiders.\" BMO plays the song in a futile attempt to bring Finn back from the Spirit World.\n\nIn \"Card Wars,\" BMO warns Finn about Jake taking the game too seriously.\n\nBMO makes an appearance in \"Burning Low.\" First, he tells Jake that he is late for a video chat with President Porpoise, and later on Jake plays an unknown game involving a rectangle punching, kicking, and jumping.\n\nIn \"BMO Noire,\" BMO goes undercover as a detective to search for Finn's missing sock. The episode is narrated by BMO and is in black and white, similar to a 1940s- and '50s-era crime film. This is BMO's first central role.\n\nBMO appears in \"James Baxter the Horse\" singing \"BMO's Pregnant Song\" and helps Finn and Jake create their routine.\n\nBMO is once again the central character in \"BMO Lost,\" where he is abducted by an eagle and has to find his way home through a forest. During his adventure, he meets Bubble and the baby Sparkle, whom he tries to help. Bubble ends up proposing to BMO but is popped by Jake.\n\nIn \"Be More,\" BMO's purpose as \"being more\" is revealed, and he reunites with their father, Moe. BMO deletes some of his files for fun, but accidentally deletes his core system drivers. Finn and Jake discover where they were created when BMO tells them that they need new drivers. When Moe tells Finn and Jake BMO's story, CMO approaches and gives the core system to Moe, who repairs BMO without erasing their memory.\n\nBMO has a pivotal part in \"Come Along With Me,\" the series finale. He spends the majority of the episode in the Tree Fort, thus sitting out of the whole battle between Gumbald and Princess Bubblegum. When GOLB appears on the battlefield and seemingly swallows Finn, Betty Grof and Ice King, Jake rushes to try stopping one of GOLB's monsters and save at least BMO and the Fort.\n\nHe fails, and BMO, now with a cracked faceplate, steps up to console a sobbing, defeated Jake reduced to a smaller size. Claiming that \"it's his time to be the papa\" he sings \"Time Adventure,\" cradling and consoling Jake in what seems to him their final moments; however, as GOLB is a being of Chaos, the Harmony of BMO's singing hurts him and his creatures.\n\nAs every inhabitant of Ooo joins BMO's song, they manage to defeat GOLB's monsters, save Finn and the restored Simon Petrikov and buy enough time for Betty to take GOLB's control and send him away.\n\nSometime later a restored and repaired BMO is seen putting Moe's Memory Disk in a rocket and sending it to space, honoring in his way the wish Moe expressed in The More You Moe, The Moe You Know (Part II), with help from Banana Man and ALLMO.\n\nMillennia later, BMO is the new King of Ooo, living at the top of Mount Cragdor surrounded by mementos of his past life, thought to be nothing but a legend. Beth and Shermy come to seek him to ask about Finn's prosthetic arm, which they found scavenging. While BMO is visibly annoyed at the duo carelessly wrecking his possessions and tries to send them away, he warms at them upon seeing the arm, showing that, despite having lost the memory of Finn's name (which now names \"Phil\"), he still remembers him and Jake fondly, and agrees to tell Beth and Shermy about the fight with GOLB, \"pretty much the End of Ooo,\" revealing them the final fate of every one of his friends before letting them go.\n\nBMO's tale inspires the duo to reclaim the Finn Sword from Fern's tree, starting a new Adventure Time in Ooo.\n\nFiles[]\n\nPlayable Games[]\n\nAdventure Master (\"Business Time\")\n\nPro Football 1861 (\"Business Time\" and \"Davey\")\n\n\"Racing game\" (\"My Two Favorite People\")\n\nBug Battle (\"Donny\")\n\nLumpy Space Invaders (\"What is Life?\")\n\nConversation Parade (\"Rainy Day Daydream\")\n\n\"Ghost game\" (\"Slow Love\")\n\nGuardians of Sunshine (\"Guardians of Sunshine\")\n\nBlok Invasion (\"What is Life?\")\n\n\"Tower climbing game\" (\"Too Young\")\n\n\"Excitebike-type game\" (\"Incendium\")\n\nPortender Defender (\"Hug Wolf\")\n\nKompy's Kastle (\"Beyond this Earthly Realm\" and \"Who Would Win\")\n\n\"Master Chen/Horse vs Two Fighters-type game\" (\"BMO Noire\")\n\nSuper Good Boys (\"Five More Short Graybles\")\n\nSumo Scootz (\"Earth & Water\")\n\n\"Buff guy game\" (\"Issue 9\")\n\nRegression Simulator (downloaded by Jake in \"The Vault\")\n\nMetaphor Temple (\"I Am a Sword\")\n\nCalling All Curlys (\"President Porpoise is Missing!\")\n\nFolder Content[]\n\nThese are some of the file names seen during the episode \"Be More,\" BMO hid under a box and trashed the files.\n\nFirst Folder[]\n\nfarerecognition.txt 72kb\n\nfilesourcescript.exe 7.8MB (trashed)\n\nfilesource.source.exe 85kb (trashed)\n\nFinnStuff — (trashed)\n\nfundament.eth.sys 1.2MB (trashed)\n\nfundament.sys 8.8 MB (trashed)\n\nGooberHunt.dmg 25MB (trashed)\n\nGooberHunt.info.txt 3kb\n\nGooberHunt.remover.exe 42kb\n\nglyph.source.exe 2MB\n\nfarerecognition.txt 28kb\n\nSecond Folder[]\n\ncommand.electricslide.exe\n\ncommand.cleanjokes.exe (trashed)\n\nconcblow.wav (trashed)\n\nCORE SYSTEM DRIVERS.sys (accidentally trashed)\n\ncontrols.bmpchop.sys (trashed)\n\ncontrols.bmokick.sys (trashed)\n\ncontrols.brownnote.sys (trashed)\n\ncontrols.forcefild.sys\n\ncontrols.frownrecognition.sys\n\nQuotes[]\n\nSee: BMO/Quotes\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBMO's voice was originally much deeper. Pendleton Ward revealed this on the animatic for \"Rainy Day Daydream\" on the Adventure Time: The Complete First Season DVD box set, which is also heard in the animatic.[4]\n\nThey want very much to understand living beings; one example is in \"All's Well That Rats Swell,\" when they think that Finn will become young forever if he plucks his beard.\n\nIn the same short, they demonstrate again their ignorance of living beings, asking Finn to kiss the wound that a rat made in their hand, eventually leaving Finn sick.\n\nIn the same short, they seem not to know that not all animals are intelligent for wanting to make a thumb wrestling with a rat and eventually being bitten.\n\nBMO can display emoticons on their screen (such as D: and -_-), as seen in \"What Was Missing.\"\n\nBMO's screen can be used as a touch screen for at least one function. Jake demonstrated this in \"James Baxter the Horse.\"\n\nWhen BMO lowers their volume in \"Holly Jolly Secrets Part I,\" they put their volume on the lowest setting but could still talk.\n\nAs seen in \"The More You Moe, The Moe You Know (Part I)\" BMO apparently uses pacifiers.\n\nMany of BMO's games are knock-offs of the games for the Atari 2600 video game platform.\n\nAccording to \"What Was Missing,\" BMO's prized possession is their controller.\n\nIn the special features section of the It Came from the Nightosphere DVD, BMO's age is shown as \"VER. 2600\" and their species kind is revealed to be \"110 VOLT-60 HERTZ SYSTEM.\"\n\nDuring Pendleton Ward's interview with Hot Topic, he stated that BMO is his favorite character.[5]\n\nBMO supposedly has \"butt circuits\" as mentioned in \"BMO Lost.\"\n\nAs seen in \"James Baxter the Horse,\" \"Davey\" and \"Imaginary Resources,\" BMO can cry, and their tears are apparently triangles.\n\nIt was revealed in \"Shh!\" that BMO's favorite song is No Wonder I by the band LAKE.\n\nBMO is completely the same in the Fionna and Cake version. This can be attributed to the fact that BMO has no set gender.\n\nBMO is Moe's favorite robot.\n\nBMO literally has a heart of gold, as seen in \"Be More.\"\n\nIt was revealed that in the episode \"In Your Footsteps\" that BMO plays soccer.\n\nBMO's BMO Chop memory (which originated from \"Card Wars\") was deleted in \"Be More\" as it implies that, unless it gets re-uploaded, we will never see it again.\n\nBMO can do a kickflip on their skateboard as shown in \"Card Wars.\"\n\nBMO loves many things about weddings, including weddings in general and flowers.\n\nAmong the relics of their past life, future BMO, as the King of Ooo, is in possession of the emptied shell of AMO.\n\nIn the comic Adventure Time: Beginning of the End, it is revealed that BMO is compatible with one of the Fire Giants, remarking \"my Infinity Port is compatible with the Fire Giant's Protocols!\" This is most likely because Moe seems to have either created or have been involved in the creation of the Fire Giants, as evident from the blueprints seen in \"The More You Moe, The Moe You Know (Part II).\"\n\nBMO enjoys to read karate magazines.\n\nCultural References[]\n\nIn \"BMO Lost,\" the crack on BMO's screen can sometimes be seen separating their face into two distinctly coloured halves and forming a pointed \"nose.\" This is very similar to the iconic Happy Mac from Mac OS 8 and possibly another one of BMO's many Macintosh references.\n\nAs seen in \"Be More,\" BMO runs on BMOS, which is a Windows/Macintosh combo-like operating system.\n\nBMO's start-up sound is the same one of a Macintosh computer.\n\nThe heart, medal and diploma scroll inside BMO may be a reference to the heart-shaped watch, medal of courage and diploma presented to the Tin Man, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow nearly at the end of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nBMO's behavior when he is alone could be a reference to Isaac Asimov's \"Catch That Rabbit,\" in which a robot acts strangely when it thinks it is not being watched.\n\nStoryline Analysis[]\n\nEven though BMO has buttons, they are rarely used to play video games. Instead, the buttons are used for various other functions, such as sucking things into BMO's mainframe or shutting off BMO's alarm. Finn and Jake mostly use controllers when playing games. In \"Evicted!,\" Marceline seems to be trying to play a game using BMO themself, but their face is still being displayed.\n\nErrors[]\n\nIn \"What Was Missing,\" Princess Bubblegum takes off BMO's template. BMO yells \"My face!\" while pointing out that the template is their face rather than their screen. However, when their screen is cracked in \"BMO Lost,\" they also refers to that as their face. It is very possible, though, that the entire front of BMO, which would be the template and the screen, is their face.\n\nAppearances in Other Media[]\n\nBMO hosted the Adventure Time New Year's Eve Marathon.\n\nBMO appears in Project Exonaut, under the alias of \"Beemo.\"\n\nThere is a BMO t-shirt in FusionFall.\n\nIn the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade for 2013, a group of people each dressed as BMO helped parade the Finn and Jake balloon.\n\nBMO is a playable character in Adventure Time Battle Party.\n\nBMO has their own app; however, it is spelled Beemo. It is available only for Mobile.\n\nBMO is featured in LEGO Dimensions.\n\nYou can purchase a BMO based design for the 3DS home menu.\n\nBMO has their own game on the Cartoon Network website, \"BMO Dreamo\"\n\nIn the Villainous episode \"The Lost Cases of Boxmore,\" BMO is shown to be a creation of Black Hat, with an arsenal of deadly weapons and is seen terrorizing Finn and Jake.\n\nVoice Actors[]\n\nLanguage Voice Actors English Niki Yang Kevin Michael Richardson (Deep Voice; Bad Jubies) Spanish (Spain) Marina García Guevara Álvaro Martínez (songs only) Spanish (Latin America) Gustavo Melgarejo (Season 1-5) Héctor Emmanuel Gómez (Season 5.2-10) Claudia Urbán (songs; Video Makers only) Marina Urbán (a dialogue loop; Davey only) French Julie Basecqz German Dalia Schmidt-Foß Japanese Kaneko Ikeda Polish Klementyna Umer Izabela Markiewicz (Rainy Day Daydream only) Other Languages Hadar Schahaf Ma'ayan (Israel) Daniel Magon (Israel; Deep Voice) Zetgi Izzati (Malaysia)\n\nGallery[]\n\nThe full image gallery for BMO may be viewed at BMO/Gallery."
