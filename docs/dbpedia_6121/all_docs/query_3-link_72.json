        "text": "One more update, now version 1.08, one more time that the problem isn't fix. It took a grand total of 15 minutes for the game to crash again. And then 5 more to crash a second time.\n\nFirst I was plagued with invisible enemies. But your CPU is old people said, and they were right. Even though people with excellent PCs also had this problem and a 300kb mod solved the issue. But it was past time I updated my PC, so I did. Now I'm over specs.\n\nAnd it did solve that issue! But now there are the crashes. It wasn't like that in the beginning, there were crashes but there were not enough to bother me. But since I reinstalled the game a few months back? Crash after crash after crash. I tried every solution that I could find, I updated my GPU several times during this time, checked the integrity of the games files three times that much, reinstalled the game, reinstalled the game in a different hd, updated windows, updated by BIOS, turned off any kind of gaming profile and overlays, and many other small solutions that I found online.\n\nNothing works.\n\nIt's always the same crash, a quick stutter and then a hard freeze. It happens when I'm walking, on a horse, fighting enemies, not fighting enemies, fighting bosses, not fighting bosses, when I'm summoned, when I'm not summoned. I do think it doesn't happen when I'm in caves, but it does happen in legacy dungeons. Malenia fight for example crashed every single time in her second phase. Every. Single. Time. Makes me feel nostalgic for that time all I had to do is dodge Waterfowl Dance.\n\nThank you for listening to my rant. Maybe the next update will fix it. ðŸ¤¡\n\nThe next time it happens check the event viewer and look for anything under Application and System at the time of the crash. Just open up the start menu and type Event Viewer and it should appear.\n\nI had odd issues where a game for some reason was triggering my machines sleep status and wake status immediately, so what I had was my display flicker and then it would come back and the game would have a black screen and need to be force closed and it was caused by ASUS power management for some reason thinking it was seeing a sleep button being triggered during the game. Only 1 game and to fix it I had to disable the sleep being enabled by button press. Dumb but it worked but event viewer gave me an idea what was happening.\n\ninteresting, can you post your specs.\n\ndid you set your correct ram speed in your bios?\n\nRyzen 5 56000x 3700mhz\n\n16gb memory 3600mhz DDR4\n\nGeForce 1070\n\nAnd I've tried with RAM speed both at default and matching the CPU speed. No difference.\n\nThe next time it happens check the event viewer and look for anything under Application and System at the time of the crash.

I've reinstalled the game so maybe I'll take, I don't know, 20 minutes for the next crash.\n\nCorrect. Once or twice the entire monitor turned off, like what happens when you upgrade the graphic drive? But it was 2 times out of 100+.\n\nOk have you tried a full GPU driver uninstall? Try uninstalling the GPU drivers, restart the computer then go directly to the manufacturers website and download and install the latest drivers available there. Sometimes the driver installers offer you the option of a \"clean install\" this does the same thing completely uninstalls the drivers before installing the new one.\n\nIf that doesn't resolve it as others have said event viewer should give you some more information that will help determine what might be the cause. Is the crash only happening in Elden Ring? Have you played other games without any issues? If so, what games have you tried to play?\n\nJudging by this and your previous posts, you pro\n\nUndetermined GPU problem. Try rerolling to a previous stable graphics driver and see if it fixes it\n\nI don't even remember when was the last stable one. How much can I go back?\n\nOk have you tried a full GPU driver uninstall?

Are you on the most recent Nvidia driver for your 1070?\n\nA DDU wipe might be in order.\n\nDisplay Driver Uninstaller (DDU) download version 18.0.7.9\n\nDownload Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) - Remove AMD/NVIDIA/INTEL Graphics Drivers Cleanly - DDU is a driver removal utility that helps you completely uninstall AMD/NVIDIA graphics card drivers and packages from your system, leaving no leftovers behind, including registry keys, folders, files...\n\nDownload and run through the steps to remove your Nvidia drivers. Then install the newest drivers (the ones from the Nvidia website).\n\nNot sure if this is still the go to but Display Driver Unistaller, DDU was always highly recomended for complete uninstall of video drivers to try and resolve problems. Used it a few times in the past.\n\nDisplay Driver Uninstaller (DDU) download version 18.0.7.9\n\nDownload Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) - Remove AMD/NVIDIA/INTEL Graphics Drivers Cleanly - DDU is a driver removal utility that helps you completely uninstall AMD/NVIDIA graphics card drivers and packages from your system, leaving no leftovers behind, including registry keys, folders, files...\n\nI'm trying a clean install now. Let's see how that goes.\n\nIt definitely sounds like a system/hardware issue rather than anything specific to Elden Ring.\n\nThe game has problems, but I don't think I had it crash on me at all in ~150 hours.\n\nWhen you 'updated' your PC, did you upgrade some components or is this a new build?\n\nIf you just replaced some parts, did you also do a clean install of Windows?\n\nWindows is usually pretty good about handling hardware upgrades these days, but if you're having issues like this I'd want to try a fresh install.\n\nAnd if it seems to be specific to the GPU, I wonder if it's getting sufficient power.\n\nUsing DDU to completely clean out old drivers and install fresh couldn't hurt either.\n\nDo you still get the crashes if you drop the game to say 720p lowest settings?\n\nI'm trying a clean install now. Let's see how that goes.\n\nOk great hopefully this resolves it for you. If not the next thing I'd check is your Power Supply\n\nIt is the curse of PC gaming. The good news is that there are often people willing to help online, as this thread very well shows. I upgraded my PC a few times just trusting what people said and I wasn't let down.\n\nYou mention here that you upgraded components. Did you also upgrade your power supply? I've seen folks slot in much more power hungry GPUs with their old power supplies and run into similar problems because the power supply isn't up to the task.\n\nOk great hopefully this resolves it for you. If not the next thing I'd check is your Power Supply\n\nYou mention here that you upgraded components. Did you also upgrade your power supply? I've seen folks slot in much more power hungry GPUs with their old power supplies and run into similar problems because the power supply isn't up to the task.\n\nIt's a 850W power supply so I don't think that's the problem. BUT it's a 10 old one, and I've seen people saying it's worth changing them after this kind of time. Yet it wasn't like this just a few months back, and besides Elden Ring I have no issues. Like, Mass Effect crashed similarly, once. There is nothing even remotely similar happening outside ER.\n\nJust a quick one, are you using a multi-display set up?\n\nNegative. Just a simple monitor.\n\nOk, I got a word from the event viewer: nvlddmkm\n\nDoes it mean anything?\n\nYeah so, Elden Ring at its current state is a very stable game. If you're suffering from crashes, it's probably your pc.\n\nNow, nvlddmkm.\n\nThere are some possibilities. First is your nvidia drivers are corrupted / in conflict with some older files. Search on the web on how to manually erase drivers because the clean option while installing geforce drivers isn't 100% cleaning.\n\nNext, this could mean your gpu isn't stable. Did you overclock your gpu? If yes, put all values by default. If it still crashes, check your gpu core temp. Is it in the 50s? The 60s? The 70s? 80s? A hot gpu tends to be less stable, especially over time. You may need to lower the power limit of your card / raise the gpu fan speed manually.\n\nIf it still crashes, swap your gpu to another and try playing with a different one and see how it goes.\n\nIt's a 850W power supply so I don't think that's the problem. BUT it's a 10 old one, and I've seen people saying it's worth changing them after this kind of time. Yet it wasn't like this just a few months back, and besides Elden Ring I have no issues. Like, Mass Effect crashed similarly, once. There is nothing even remotely similar happening outside ER.\n\nNegative. Just a simple monitor.\n\nYea at 10 years old it's definitely worth swapping it out for a newer one. Certainly conceivable that a 10 year old PSU could be having some issues with power delivery. Would probably be much more energy efficient to swap to a newer one too. Let me know if you want some PSU recommendations and I can find some for you.\n\nIt's a 850W power supply so I don't think that's the problem.

Like, Mass Effect crashed similarly, once. There is nothing even remotely similar happening outside ER.\n\nNegative. Just a simple monitor.\n\nA PSU can be 850W and still be really low quality. At 10 years old, I'd say it's very likely the culprit.\n\nI'll echo what others were saying. In my 130 hours the game ran not so good at times. The worst being the double gargoyle boss fight which dropped below 30FPS for no real reason. However I can say it never crashed of all things.\n\nAs others have already said DDU and a clean install of the GPU is definitely where I'd start first. nvlddmkm crashes are usually GPU related, be it to do with the driver, or hardware itself. Following that I'd maybe try installing MSI After burner and trying to lower the gpu core clock to see if you can get it stable. GPU's can lose their ability to keep core clocks over time if they've been used a lot, and if the core clock is unstable the game crashing out is usually what happens. You can also try lowering the power limit too, which might also show if its a power draw issue too."
