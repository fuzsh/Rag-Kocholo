It is 400mhz processor. I put in an ati\n\n128 mb agp card. It has 128 megs of ram. I'm trying to get more (and\n\nperhaps faster) ram this weekend.\n\nDespite this, I've been able to get almost all the games I want to play\n\nto run at or near full speed. Sometimes, it took a while and a lot of\n\nexperimentation. For instance, star wars the arcade game wouldn't run\n\non mame, but it runs perfectly with dmame without my having to do\n\nanything to help it. And side-scrollers similar to double dragon\n\n(double dragon 2, xmen tag, rastan, crime fighters, forgotten worlds,\n\netc.) run well with some tweaking on my part.\n\nI've tried running DD with various windows versions of Mame and various\n\nversions of DMAME. It hasn't worked.\n\ndos-man\n\nIan Rawlings\n\nPost by dos-man 64\n\nI eventually got Double Dragon II running at full speed (or something\n\nclose to it), but I haven't had much luck with the first Double Dragon.\n\nMine runs at full whack on a P4 1.6GHz machine.\n\nPost by dos-man 64\n\nWhat does your machine look like?\n\nComputer in an old cabinet sort of look.\n\n--\n\nBlast off and strike the evil Bydo empire!\n\nDeadlyDad\n\nPost by dos-man 64\n\nI eventually got Double Dragon II running at full speed (or something\n\nclose to it), but I haven't had much luck with the first Double Dragon.\n\nI've done everything from using multiple emulators to hardware upgrades\n\nto increasing the frameskip and overclock CPU settings.
