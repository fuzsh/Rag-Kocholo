        "text": "@DeepSixxxx wrote:\n\nI run BF 2042 on a Xbox series X connected via HDMI 2.1 cable to a Samsung 120 Hz 4k TV that has VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) meter shown when in fastest (9ms latency or less) game mode, and it shows 119 FPS (Frames per second) when I play BF2042 (holds 119 vs 120 as that is the safe zone as TV can't handle above 120). Therefore, it would seem I am getting 119 frames from the game per second, but not sure if the game puts out more than 60 frames per second, although I also have the game on a higher end PC and I swear it runs smoother on Series X than the choppy 90-130 fps I get on PC (2080 TI card).\n\nThat said, Xbox Series X running 4k has all enhanced graphics settings either off or lowest settings, and the game still can't handle the Hourglass map at times when playing 128 player modes. The VRR frames drop from 119 to 50-70 range, and I have to quit the game when this happens as it absolutely overheats the Xbox Series X to the point that it either crashes the game or even a few times shuts the entire Xbox down and goes into a cooling mode (fan runs while Xbox powered down). And I know it is not a connection issue as we run the PC and Xbox at the same time, in the same game on the same server and there have been no issues with the PC on the same map and server when the Xbox series X goes into literally thermal meltdown, as touching the front of the box under the power button gets extremely hot to the touch when frames start dropping 50% or more on the hourglass map...\n\nSo in summary, it seems I'm getting 119 frames as it is as smooth if not better than my PC at 90-130 frames, and my other Xbox games run at either 60 or 120 fps as indicated by the VRR Samsung frames per second meter. I've tried to get EA or Dice to confirm if the game is running at 120 fps, but no luck. Everything I read says it is not possible...can anyone from Dice or EA confirm if it is possible to run 120 fps on Xbox series X if one tweaks the setting a certain way? Or am I simply getting a fake reading of 119 fps on my Samsung TV, perhaps it is simply upscaling the 60 frames to 120 frames although that does not happen with any other Xbox games as the VRR TV indicator will max at either 60 fps or 119 fps depending on the game maximum frames per second limits..."
