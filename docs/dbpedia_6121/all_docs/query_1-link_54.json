        "text": "That's true, I have 15in Acer Triton with 45W 10875H + 90W 2070S, to keep normal fan noise I had to reduce CPU TDP to 40W and GPU to 80W (already repasted with thermalright TFX)\n\nI gave the laptop to my nephew, hopefully he can use it for a long time, probably gonna need repasting after some time.\n\nExcept that's not true.\n\nI take it you are referring to that famous AMD's TDP definition in terms of cooling required to dissipate heat. And even more famous saying: TDP ≠ POWER\n\nThis is a misconception owed both to criminally low level of public understanding what power and heat mean and to AMD's marketing Robert Hallock (the other famous example of him sowing confusion is from early FreeSync days supposedly needing vsync=on)\n\nI'll quote gamernexus:\n\nA watt is a watt. Wikipedia says a watt is “a derived unit of 1 joule per second, and is used to quantify the rate of energy transfer.” In a Reddit post, AMD’s Robert Hallock says “TDP is about thermal watts, not electrical watts. These are not the same.”\n\nIn a literal sense, that’s not true: “thermal” and “electrical” watts are the same unit, in the sense that a cup of flour is the same as a cup of water or a pound of feathers is the same as a pound of bricks. Moreover, the rate that a chip draws energy (as electricity) and releases energy (as heat) should be the same over a sufficient amount of time, since no physical “work” is being done.\" There is no translation about any axis and no emission in any other form, such as light, and so heat out will be nearly perfectly 1:1 with power in.\n\nWhat that means is: AMD might be talking about \"thermal\" watts - notice quotation marks - they are needed because there is no such thing as thermal watts. This should be your 1st hint there is something wrong with your definition: If in any technical discussion, you are compelled to use quotation marks to indicate that a term should not be taken literally, you need to come up with a better term. Technical discussion is not a Shakespeare's poem - everything SHOULD be taken literally.\n\nHallock might be talking about \"thermal\" watts - but they are just watts. No different than \"electrical\" watts.\n\nBut if you follow Hallock's mental picture of \"electrical\" watts being converted to \"thermal\" watts - such picture will work only if you remember that ALL electrical watts end up as thermal watts because:\n\nThey can't be created out of nothing or destroyed\n\nCPU is simply a 100% efficient heater - electrically and thermally no different than any coil heater or a wire\n\nAnd since total energy is conserved, so are the watts - \"thermal\" or \"electrical\"\n\nTLDR;\n\nIf your CPU is using 100 watts during a prolonged amount of time, and you want it work properly, then you can't have the heat building up - therefore you need a cooling system able to dissipate 100 watts of heat ."
