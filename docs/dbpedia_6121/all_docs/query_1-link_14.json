The CPU time is often measured in clock ticks or seconds. CPU time is also mentioned as percentage of the CPU's capacity at any given time on multi-tasking environment. That helps in figuring out how a CPUâ€™s computational power is being shared among multiple computer programs.\n\nanswered Sep 8, 2010 at 23:54\n\nBadPirateBadPirate\n\n26.1k1010 gold badges9696 silver badges126126 bronze badges"
