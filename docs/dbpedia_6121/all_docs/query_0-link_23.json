        "text": "It's not worth it upgrading from 1080P to 1440P on 27\" Monitor.\n\n27\" Monitors are perfect size for sitting regularly at a computer desk. I have three 27\" monitors. They are all 1080P. And what I'm about to say is based only on my single day experience using 1440P. Different monitors, or different people may change the overall outcome. But this is my experience.\n\nPeople kind of snubbed me for having a 4080 and only using 1080P. lol I wanted to know what 1440P was like anyhow. I planned to upgrade to 1440P but comments made me believe I was missing out on something. So I upgraded a little sooner then originally planned.\n\nI bought a $600+ 1440P monitor. While it's a good monitor. I barely noticed a quality boost in almost any game. 1080P looks basically the same. I know it's not a DLSS setting etc. I'm using DLSS quality and tried no DLSS super sampling at all.\n\nIf I view them both 1080P and 1440P side by side live. Maybe I would notice a little more but from my tests it's very minimal.\n\nI've tested several games. Sure if I know were to look I notice a slight visual appearance boost. But otherwise it's pointless. It's barely worth it even if FPS stayed the same. But FPS went from 150 to 100 and since it's still playable I will try it out longer. I can easily switch back to 1080P and move this monitor over to my other monitors. Like swap them. So my 1080P is back in the middle for gaming. And my 1440P can be my side media monitor.\n\nI just want to let people know. Sure the 1440P monitor may have other benefits too. Outside of gaming etc. But it has some downsides as well. I promise you if buy a better 1080P monitor it will do more for you at 27\" than 1440P will. If you already have a top tier 1080P monitor. Upgrade to 1440P if you want a slight boost.\n\nEven if you upgrade quality of monitor and go for 1440P. You won't likely notice any major difference. I still consider myself a 1080P gamer. I would rather have 150 FPS then the slight quality boost I got. Some people who use 1440P or 4K also lower graphic settings to pull it off.\n\nYour probably downgrading your experience if you use 1440P or 4K and lower settings to compensate for FPS. Just use a 1080P monitor with maxed settings. I'm still using max settings on 1440P and barely notice a difference in visual quality.\n\nNote: If you go above 27\" likely 32\" or higher. Sure I'm willing to say that 1440P or 4K may be more viable. Even at 32\" 4K is likely still overkill. But that's not what this discussion is about. We were only talking about 27\" are people really using 27\" 4K monitors for gaming? That's actually sad. lol I don't exactly regret this. I had to see for myself. And like I said the monitor still has it's uses."
