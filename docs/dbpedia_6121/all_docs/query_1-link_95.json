        "text": "I just ran an XTU stress test for the hell of it on my i7 5500u and when the CPU stress test was finished the highest temp reading was at 83C and this translates into 183F which is hot but not as hot as the CPU will get on the die. (100C or past boiling point of water) I do have an external fan... I did not experience any thermal throttling but I did experience power throttling which makes me think the board is not letting the electrical current through but I'm not too sure... anyway I'm not sure if IView attachment 107722 should do anything about this or not... any help will be appreciated...\n\nYou have a 5500U, that's why it power throttles. It will throttle to try to stay below TDP, and those CPUs have a pretty low TDP. You can use ThrottleStop to try to prevent that but in my experience it won't always work.\n\n83C is pretty high for a desktop, but it looks like you're on a laptop, and those normally run hotter due to cooling constraints, so I wouldn't worry. Either way it's not hot enough to kill a CPU, might have a small effect on the expected lifetime but it will probably die of other causes or simply go unused before the CPU dies.\n\nDon't worry about translating the temps into Farenhight. PC hardware has a higher tolerance then normal electronics, that's why all PC temps are in Celsius.\n\nIf your doing a Stress Test on your CPU or GPU, then the point is to see the worst case scenario of the temp of your CPU/GPU.\n\nSo 83c in a Stress Test for a CPU is actually very normal on a Air Cooled CPU.\n\nThere is a MAX temp rated for all CPU's by the manufacturer, it's called \"TJMax\".\n\nThe TJMax for most CPU's is around 95c to 100c.\n\n83c is very normal for an air cooled CPU. I would be very worried if you were getting 83c on a water cooled CPU, even in a Stress Test. But like I said, 83c is very normal for an air cooled CPU while running a Stress Test.\n\nIf your really worried, why not repaste the CPU with fresh thermal paste? Unless your on a laptop.\n\nIf this was a desktop CPU running at stock speeds then 83C would be worringly high. Not because it will damage the CPU, but because it's a sign that something is not right with the cooling. For example, my i7 920 got up to about 76C when stress testing with the stock cooler, and that's a 130W TDP CPU. Newer CPUs run cooler since they are far more efficient. Even the high-end i7 8700K only has a 95W TDP. So having those kind of temps on any recent or semi-recent Intel CPU on a desktop would be a sign that either the cooler needs to be cleaned, the fan needs to be replaced or the thermal paste needs reapplying. Or someone just did an awful job with cable management.\n\nOn a laptop like he seems to be on though, it's a lot more normal. It's hardly optimal, but decent cooling on laptops is often sacrificed for portability.\n\nYou have a 5500U, that's why it power throttles.

A stress test is designed to stress the CPU to 100% usage (depending on the test). If the CPU gets to 83c as it's max temp during a Stress test, then it's perfectly fine, and normal, even on a desktop. If it's air cooled anyway.\n\nIf he was getting 83c with normal every day use, or gaming, then that is a sign that something is wrong somewhere.\n\nBut getting 83c as a MAX temp in a stress test is perfectly normal with an air cooled CPU.\n\nTrust me, I built many gaming computers, and Overclocked a lot of i7 CPU's. To make sure the overclock is stable, I always ran a Stress test to pin the CPU at 100% for about an hour or two at a time, sometimes longer.\n\nYou have a 5500U, that's why it power throttles.

I would do a Google search on your laptop and see what other people are saying about thier idle temps.
