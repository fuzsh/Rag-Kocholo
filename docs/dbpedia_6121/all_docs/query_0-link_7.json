        "text": "The best gaming CPU is one of the most hotly contested titles in the industry, changing hands with each successive new generation of processors. Both Intel and AMD have some excellent CPU contenders in the mix, but on this hallowed page, we'll reveal the very best.\n\nAMD's mega-cache X3D CPUs offer stiff competition for Intel and the best gaming CPU is now the mighty AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D. For a much more affordable option, the best budget CPU is the Intel Core i5 13400F, although as noted below, Intel chips come with a potential caveat as things currently stand. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700X is the best mid-range chip, thanks to its excellent all-round performance and reasonable price.\n\nA note on Intel CPUs: Due to recent crashing issues with a number of Intel chips, we've changed our picks to reflect this. We've also added caveats to our remaining Intel CPU recommendations. A fix is reportedly on its way some time in mid-August, though chips already damaged may need to be replaced.\n\nThe quick list\n\nBest gaming CPU\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It's certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it's also capably outperforming Intel's top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It's also a lot less power-thirsty, too.\n\nThat's possibly one of the most intriguing things about the 3D V-Cache processors of the Zen 4 generationâ€”just how much more efficient they are than the first top-end chips of the Ryzen 7000-series. In fact, with every subsequent release of this new generation AMD has improved its latest processor range, making the previous ones almost redundant.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 7950X3D was the first of the new 3D V-Cache chips to hit our test bench, and it offers a mix of high-end gaming performance and a full 16-cores of Zen 4 processing. But its hybrid design, which offered one eight-core chiplet (or CCD) with the extra 64MB of L3 cache fused on top of it and another CCD without, demanded some extra hoops for the operating system to jump through and also sacrificed some of a standard 16-core chip's raw multithreaded performance.\n\nIt's our top AMD high-end recommendation, but if sheer gaming performance is your main concern, its the 7800X3D you should go for instead. It wears its gaming predilections on its sleeve and delivers performance that could make a Core i9 blush.\n\nAnd at it's original price of $450 it was initially a lot more than the Intel Core i5 13600K. That's a ~$300 chip that sports 14 cores and 20 threads of compute power. However, prices have dropped since then, and you can regularly pick up the 7800X3D for well under $400/Â£400. The Intel is still the better all-rounder, but given the ongoing crashing issues plaguing some Intel chips right now, it'd make a lot of sense to spend more and grab a chip that carves through games faster than everything else while still remaining rock-solid stable.\n\nThat being said, the Intel chip does provide better productivity performance, and is simply a more rounded package. Still, given those issues, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X is a more sensible choice for those not looking to spend quite as much as the 7800X3D, and to minimise any worries about potential issues with Intel chips. It's slower than the 7800X3D, sure, but a fair bit cheaper too, and still a brilliant gaming chip.\n\nBut those are the sensible facts and figures, and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is still the fastest gaming CPU we've ever tested. So, if you want the absolute highest possible frame rates the extra cache on top of this Zen 4 chiplet is going to do the business.\n\nDo you want a cool and quiet gaming PC that's capable of the absolute fastest gaming frame rates? Then grab a 7800X3D, people.\n\nRead our full AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D review.\n\nBest budget CPU for gaming\n\nFor a gaming PC, there's no better value CPU than a Core i5. For most of 2022, we recommended the Core i5 12600K as the best gaming CPU and the Core i5 12400 as the best gaming CPU on a budget. Last year, the Core i5 13600K took over the top spot. And now, the Core i5 13400F pushes Alder Lake out of the running with an even more impressive specification for the money, making it the best budget gaming CPU you can currently buy.\n\nThis recommendation comes with a caveat, however. Intel chips have been experiencing crashing issues due to voltage errors, although to the best of our knowledge the issue seems to primarily affect the higher-end models. Whereas this budget chip is much less likely to experience an issue thanks to its lower power requirements.\n\nA microcode BIOS update should be available in August to fix the issue, so if you do decide to pull the trigger on one of these, we'd highly recommend checking for BIOS updates for your particular motherboard and installing them as soon as possible to prevent potential problems. Still, given the lower power requirements here, your risk is likely to be minimal, meaning we're still comfortable recommending this chip as things stand.\n\nThe Intel Core i5 13400F is a 10-core hybrid-design processor made up of six Performance-cores (P-cores) and four Efficient-cores (E-cores), the Core i5 13400F has a total of 16 threads. Its fastest cores will run up to 4.6 GHz out of the box, a clock speed that wouldn't have seemed out of place on the box of a Core i7 only a few years back.\n\nIn our testing, neither the Core i5 13400F nor the Ryzen 5 7600X can claim an outright win across the testing suite, though when AMD's chip is faster, it is quite a bit faster. AMD's chip does come out as the clear winner on the productivity and content creation side of things, but it is that much more expensive for it.\n\nAMD-compatible motherboards have tended to fall on the expensive side versus the cheaper Intel-compatible 600-series boards, but there are now some cheaper options coming through.\n\nIntel's platform is surprisingly cheap for the inclusion of both the latest 700-series motherboards and older 600-series motherboards. Similarly, we're saving a little cash here on the 'F' designated model. The 'F' denotes the Core i5 13400F's lack of integrated graphics, which isn't a deal breaker by any stretch of the imagination. Generally, that integrated GPU isn't going to come much in handy for gaming, and even today's cheapest discrete graphics card will outperform it by a country mile.\n\nWhile the Core i5 13600K remains the pick for the best all-round gaming CPU, and AMD is very competitive in the ~$275 market, Intel's Core i5 13400F is still a shoe-in for the best budget gaming CPU in 2024. Keep your eyes peeled for that BIOS update though, just in case.\n\nRead our full Intel Core i5 13400F review.\n\nThe best mid-range CPU\n\nWhile a great CPU is definitely the heart of a fast PC for both gaming and productivity, you don't have to head straight for the high-end to get excellent performance. As a case in point, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X delivers gobs of gaming grunt, is no slouch for productivity tasks, and is available for very reasonable money. That makes it the best mid-range gaming CPU we currently recommend.\n\nAMD's AM5 platform has been out for a little while now, but it's still new enough that motherboards can be a little pricey for the feature set you receive. As a result, it makes sense to go for a more expensive motherboard and a more mid-range chip, especially when AMD's offering here is genuinely impressive in what it can deliver for the money.\n\nIt's an eight core, 16 thread CPU with a...wait, come back! While that's not the most exciting of configurations, the headline news here is that eight core is really the sweet spot for gaming right now, and this particular chip can clock itself all the way up to 5.4 GHz to really push itself to the maximum. That means seriously impressive Zen 4 performance, and eeks the Ryzen 7 7700X ahead of one of AMD's previous gaming heavyweights, the Ryzen 7 5800X3D.\n\nThat chip still comes highly recommended as an AM4 platform contender, and is by no means a slouch. In fact, it runs right at the center of many a high-performance gaming rig to this day, so to outright beat it in gaming performance without any fancy 3D V-cache shenanigans is a very impressive result.\n\nThere is a drawback, however, and that's heat. The 7700X likes to give cooling systems a workout, so you'll need a sizeable air cooler or significantly chunky water cooling system to prevent it from throttling back. Here though, the 7700X has a trick up its sleeve, and that's something called Eco Mode.\n\nRunning in 65 W Eco Mode configuration (as opposed to the full fat 105 W TDP), you'll still receive, on average, 90-95% of the performance in most scenarios. That significantly reduces the thermals, so for small form factor systems or those that don't want to buy a large cooler, you can be assured that your chip is still delivering great performance without sucking down too much juice.\n\nSo why didn't AMD simply make this a 65W chip to begin with? Well, when it runs into Intel's mid-range competition, the blue team chips do often pull slightly ahead. As a result, the 7700X has been configured to squeeze as much performance possible out of its eight cores, hence the high clock speeds and heavy power draw.\n\nIn terms of real world usage though, that matters little. While some Intel chips have been experiencing crashing issues recently, the 7700X keeps on trucking day after day. We know this for a fact, as two of our hardware team currently use PCs featuring this excellent CPU as daily drivers, and neither have had any issues to report.\n\nIt simply gets on with the job of being a fantastic eight core CPU, for a reasonable price, on a platform with plenty of upgradeability in future. It's for this reason that the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X takes our best mid-range CPU spot, as it's everything you could want from an affordable yet high-performance chip with the minimum of fuss.\n\nRead our full AMD Ryzen 7 7700X review.\n\nBest high-end CPU\n\nWell, it was a close run thing. But we've gone for the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D over the regular AMD Ryzen 9 7950X as our best high-end AMD CPU pick, for a number of reasons. While the 7950X is better for raw performance, thanks to the power of 3D V-Cache, the gaming figures of the 7950X3D cannot be ignored.\n\nThat's not to say you should discount the 3D V-Cache-less chip entirely, of course. If you're more of a content creator than a gamer, then the better raw performance of the 7950X may well be your jam. However, if you're more of a gamer than a content-cruncher, then the Ryzen 9 7950X3D is the one to pick.\n\nLet's have a run through the specifications, because there's some numbers here that'll make your jaw drop. 16 cores. 32 threads. A max boost clock of 5.7 GHz, and a simply gigantic 128 MB of L3 cache (including 64 MB of L3D). Those figures make for a chip that, on paper at the very least, should scream through any task you throw at it.\n\nAnd goodness me, does it. While the Intel Core i9 13900K still remains supreme for multi-core productivity, for many benchmarks it's a close run thing, and with the current Intel crashing issues yet to be resolved, it doesn't make this list for now. Still, coming close to that chip means results that are better than almost anything else, although the 7950X does pull ahead from its 3D V-Cache brother (and the 13900K) in our Blender 3.3.0 benchmark.\n\nIn terms of real-world gaming, however, the 7950X3D really does come into its own. It's comfortably ahead of the Intel chip in most benchmarks, dead-level in others, and often significantly faster than the 7950X. That's where the magic of that 3D V-Cache really does make a difference, and if gaming is a primary concern, that's going to be the selling point here.\n\nThat being said though, it's not our pick for the best gaming CPU. That honor belongs to the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, a chip that pips it to the post in many gaming tests, for significantly less. However, it's not the greatest at rendering and productivity tasks, meaning it's something of a specialised instrument. Sure, the 7800X3D will do fine if you push it beyond the gaming sphere, but if you want extreme aptitude in all tasks, and you're determined to be on the AM5 platform, this chip is the one we'd pick.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D is not cheap. It's chunky in every respect, from the spec sheet to the size of the hole it'll put in your pocketbook. But if you're looking for the ultimate AMD high-end chip that's not just great for gaming, but can keep up with and occasionally beat the almighty Core i9 13900K, this'll be the one to go for.\n\nIt's the best high-end AMD chip we've tested, and one of the fastest overall full stop.\n\nRead our full AMD Ryzen 9 7950X review.\n\nBest AMD AM4 CPU upgrade\n\nPreviously, this spot was occupied by the excellent AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D. And that's still a great shout for an AM4-based upgrade. But we've picked the AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D as our best AM4 upgrade pick for a reason, and it's this: it still delivers excellent performance, but it's also much cheaper.\n\nEssentially, what you're getting here is almost the same chip as the 5800X3D, just with the base and boost clocks lowered. And for those of your rubbing your hands together anticipating some overclocking to bring it back up to spec for less, I have some bad news: it doesn't support it.\n\nBut that really doesn't mean you should discount this chips performance, because it's still excellent. Minimum frame rates are often a giveaway as to how well a chip is performing in strenuous gaming tasks, and thanks to that hefty dose of 3D V-Cache, the 5700X3D does remarkably well. It might have lower clock speeds than its bigger brother, but in real-world gaming terms, it still has the goods to muscle its way into the \"serious gaming chip\" category.\n\nNot only that, but you can usually find one for around $200. That's budget CPU money, whereas the 5800X3D, thanks to its reputation, power and desirability means it's held onto its value in a remarkable way. A little too remarkably, if you ask us, as it's still often a comparable price to the AM5 platform AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, which handily beats it in most benchmarks.\n\nHere though, you'll be spending a lot less. That means that money you saved can go towards a better GPU, more RAM, or something else that's going to make a difference in your gaming PC. Remember, while CPUs are still a very important component in a gaming build, spending up on a GPU or more RAM can make more of a difference than putting it into a similar CPU with slightly higher clocks.\n\nThere's still a few things to consider here, though. For a start, like its bigger brother, it does like to run hot, which means you might need to invest in a better air cooler or water cooling solution to keep it from throttling back.\n\nThe other is AM5 itself. While AM5 motherboards are still a little on the pricey side, they have dropped, along with AM5 chips themselves. The AM5 socket is likely to be sticking around for quite a while, so spending a bit more now to get yourself on the AM5 train will provide an upgrade path for the future. That Ryzen 7 7700X is tempting as a mid-range pick, although it's still a fair bit more expensive, and of course you'll need to shell out for the motherboard and the DDR5 to go with.\n\nStill, if you're looking for something that'll drop into your AM4 machine, deliver great performance, and won't break the bank, this is where we'd put our money. The AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D is the best way to upgrade an AM4 PC right now, and a rare combination of things: a cheap component for an older spec that really makes a whole lot of sense, with very little to complain about.\n\nRead our full AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D review.\n\nBest integrated graphics in a CPU\n\nIn case you haven't noticed, graphics cards are pretty expensive. If that puts you off PC gaming, then AMD has something for you: The Ryzen 8000-series APUs include the most powerful integrated graphics ever, and the Ryzen 7 8700G is the top chip of the lot. They're positioned to challenge entry-level graphics cards, meaning you might not even need a graphics card for 1080p gaming today.\n\nIt's been over a year since AMD announced its Phoenix range of laptop processors. They took their time to come to market, but we did get a good idea of what to expect from a desktop APU by looking at devices like the Asus ROG Ally. Though ostensibly a handheld, it's capable of functioning as a desktop replacement when docked and delivers genuine gaming performance. If a power-restricted APU in a handheld can do that, its unleashed potential in a desktop form factor sounds pretty exciting to me.\n\nIt's now well over a year since the launch of AMD's Zen 4-based Ryzen 7000-series CPUs. They're generally an evolutionary upgrade over the Zen 3 5000-series models. A tweaked front end, a doubling of L2 cache, AVX-512 support and improved branch prediction helped to deliver an IPC gain of around 13%. Add to that clock speed improvements partly thanks to a shift to TSMC's 5nm process (for the Core Complex Dies) and we've got ourselves a competitive AMD CPU family.\n\nThe 8700G incorporates many of these improvements, but it is a different beast. Most especially it uses a monolithic die as opposed to the chiplet design of the regular 7000-series CPUs. It includes a dedicated XDNA AI engine, but the major selling point of the 8000-series APUs is their integrated graphics.\n\nTucked away inside the Ryzen 7 8700G's die is the top-of-the-line Radeon 780M integrated graphics. It's the most powerful integrated graphics solution ever seen on the desktop platform. Based on the RDNA 3 architecture, there are 12 Compute Units, giving it 768 shader cores in total, clocked at up to 2.9 GHz. The Vega 8 IGP of the 5700G is 3 generations behind and clocked at just 2.0 GHz. It's not even in the same ballpark.\n\nWhile we're happy to shout about the gaming performance of the 8700G, we're less impressed with its all-round CPU performance. Gamers with discrete graphics cards should look towards one of AMD's 7000-series CPUs, or the excellent Ryzen 7 5700X3D if you're sticking with AM4. That's without even mentioning the plethora of Intel 12th, 13th and 14th Gen options.\n\nRead our full AMD Ryzen 7 8700G review.\n\nPC Gamer CPU reviews\n\nProcessor FAQ\n\nHow do you test CPUs?\n\nWhile gaming resolutions run from 720p to 4K, we largely test at 1080p. This will show the most significant difference in gaming performance you're likely to see and push the CPU into the spotlight instead of the GPUâ€”an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 in this case.\n\nWe use a mix of motherboards depending on the platform, but all high-end to ensure as level a playing field as we can. These boards include the Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero, MSI MPG Z490 Carbon WiFi, ASRock X670E Taichi, and Gigabyte X570 Aorus Master.\n\nWhen it comes to memory, we use G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo DDR5-6000 CL30 2x 16GB for 13th/12th Gen Intel processors, while 11th Gen processors are tested using Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB DDR4-3600 sticks. The AMD AM5 rig uses the same DDR5 memory as the high-end Intel one, however, the AM4 rig uses a Thermaltake DDR4-3600 kit.\n\nTo further eliminate any bottlenecks, a high-speed PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD was used across each system, each loaded with Windows 11 and our suite of benchmarking applications and games.\n\nLiquid cooling is also used on all test rigs to ensure these chips are not restricted thermally.\n\nOur full benchmark suite includes 3DMark Time Spy, Civ 6's turn benchmark, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, Metro Exodus, F1 2021, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Cinebench R23, SiSoft Sandra, x264 v5, and PCMark 10.\n\nDoes your CPU matter for gaming?\n\nThe short answer is: yes. The longer answer is that it's more complicated and nuanced than that. You obviously need a CPU in your gaming PC, but the component that has the biggest impact on frame rates is your graphics card. That doesn't mean you can have a weak old processor in your rig and pair it with a high-end GPU and have no worries. You still need your processor to keep your graphics card fed with data to ensure a smooth gaming experience, without that you'll get stutters as the GPU waits for the CPU to catch up.\n\nAs with everything it's all about balance. But in modern times, a mainstream CPU won't see you losing out in terms of gaming performance compared to the top chips by anything more than single-digit frames per second.\n\nWhat motherboard is right for my CPU?\n\nRaptor Lake is the most recent Intel platform to be released, and it's compatible with any 600-series motherboard and the newer 700-series ones. These are available supporting DDR5 (new) and DDR4, so pick that side of things carefully.\n\nThe latest AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs use a new AM5 socket, and that means they only work with currently available X670, X670E, and B650 motherboards. Older AM4 motherboards, such as X570, B550, and A520 boards, are not compatible, ending a long line of compatibility there.\n\nIs Intel or AMD better?\n\nThis is a rather loaded question. AMD has held the top spot for a long time, with its Zen architecture making for some incredible leaps in performance, but Intel stole the crown with its Alder Lake family, specifically the Core i5 12600K, and made it even better with Raptor Lake and the Core i5 13600K.\n\nIt's worth remembering that most games are GPU-limited, which means the graphics card is the limiting factor in terms of performance, and you would likely see the same essential frame rates with either CPU manufacturer when a discrete graphics card is used. This is especially true as you up the resolution, with 4K having little between the top chips.\n\nShould I overclock my CPU?\n\nThe honest answer is: no. Overclocking your processor is not necessarily the risky move it once was, but equally, the benefits of doing so have drastically dropped in recent times. When we're talking about gaming performance, having a slightly higher clocked CPU can make a bit of a difference, but arguably your graphics card will be the part that limits the speed of your system.\n\nThere is also the point that overclocked CPUs create more heat, require more intensive and expensive cooling solutions, need those coolers to work harder, and are, therefore, often louder.\n\nFor us, overclocking your CPU to gain real-world performance benefits is not something we'd recommend most PC gamers do.\n\nCPU review list\n\nAMD CPU reviews:\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 8600G\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7950X\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7900\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 7700X\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 7700\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 5950X\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 5900X\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 5700G\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600X\n\nThreadripper 3970X and 3960X\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 3950X\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900XT\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 3900X\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 3800XT\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 3700X\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 3600XT\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 2700X\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 2600X\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 2400G\n\nAMD Ryzen 3 2200G\n\nAMD Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X, and 1700\n\nThreadripper 1950X and 1920X\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 1600X, 1600, 1500X, and 1500\n\nAMD Ryzen 3 1300X and 1200\n\nIntel CPU reviews:\n\nIntel Core i9 14900K\n\nIntel Core i7 14700K\n\nIntel Core i5 14600K\n\nIntel Core i9 13900K\n\nIntel Core i5 13600K\n\nIntel Core i5 13400F\n\nIntel Core i9 12900K\n\nIntel Core i5 12600K\n\nIntel Core i5 12400\n\nIntel Core i9 11900K\n\nIntel Core i5 11600K\n\nIntel Core i5 11400F\n\nIntel Core i9 10980XE\n\nIntel Core i9 10900K\n\nIntel Core i5 10600K\n\nIntel Core i9 9900K\n\nIntel Core i7 9700K\n\nIntel Core i9 7980XE\n\nIntel Core i9 7960X\n\nIntel Core i9 7900X\n\nIntel Core i7 8700K\n\nIntel Core i7 7700K and Core i5 7600K\n\nIntel Core i5 8400\n\nCPU jargon buster\n\nCache - A small segment of high-speed memory dedicated to storing and executing frequently used commands/instructions to speed up software execution. CPUs contain caches designated as Level 1, 2, and 3, with L1 being the fastest and smallest and L3 being the slowest and largest.\n\nClock speed - The speed at which a CPU can execute instructions, measured in hertz. A processor with a 3.7 GHz clock speed can process up to 3.7 billion instructions a second, per core. Clock speed is one of the most critical factors for determining performance in games and workload functions.\n\nCore - A self-contained block of circuitry that processes instructions and data. Modern CPUs can contain anywhere from two to 70+ cores (in supercomputers), though CPUs housed in most consumer machines will generally carry between four and eight, with AMD's latest CPUs sporting up to 16 cores.\n\nHeat sink - A cooling solution for PCs that utilize fans or liquid cooling (active) or aluminum radiators (passive) that rely on convection to regulate a component's temperature.\n\nHyper-Threading (SMT) - Intel terminology for a tech that allows a processor to handle two sets of instructions 'threads' simultaneously. AMD and other CPU vendors call this SMT, Simultaneous Multi-Threading.\n\nSocket type LGA (Land Grid Array), PGA (Pin Grid Array), or BGA (Ball Grid Array) - The way a CPU interfaces with the socket on a motherboard. LGA is used on Intel sockets with pins as part of the socket. AMD's AM4 solution, PGA, has the processors' pins, which fit into holes in the socket. AMD's Threadripper CPUs also use LGA sockets. A BGA socket is when the processor is permanently soldered to the motherboard, typically on a laptop.\n\nTDP - Thermal design power, the maximum amount of heat a system or chip can produce that the attendant cooling system is designed to deal with under workload. This term can apply to PCs as a whole, GPUs, CPUs, or nearly any other performance component that generates heat and is in large part an indicator of how much power a part draws.\n\nThread - A thread refers to a series of CPU instructions for a specific program. Older CPUs and SMT disabled run one thread per core, but most modern AMD and Intel CPUs can simultaneously run two threads, sharing some resources (e.g., cache)."
