The new Asetek pump does an excellent job without producing any annoyingly noticeable noise during operation. The three 120 mm ROG AF 12S fans dissipate heat quickly and due to the increased volume of the radiator, they don't even have to run at high speeds.

The new Asetek pump does an excellent job without producing any annoyingly noticeable noise during operation. The three 120 mm ROG AF 12S fans dissipate heat quickly and due to the increased volume of the radiator, they don't even have to run at high speeds. The workmanship, especially at the pump, the performance and the ARGB colors are convincing all along the line.\n\nperformance first\n\nSince Intel launched the 12th generation processor, Asetek's 7th generation cooling solution is actually a little bit powerless, but after the launch of Intel's 13th generation processor, Asetek finally launched the 8th generation water cooling solution, and ROG's new The Ryuo III series is the first batch of radiators equipped with the new solution, and there is also a newly designed Anime Matrix LED panel on the water block, which brings better performance and visual feast to players.\n\nperformance first\n\nSince Intel launched the 12th generation processor, Asetek's 7th generation cooling solution is actually a little bit powerless, but after the launch of Intel's 13th generation processor, Asetek finally launched the 8th generation water cooling solution, and ROG's new The Ryuo III series is the first batch of radiators equipped with the new solution, and there is also a newly designed Anime Matrix LED panel on the water block, which brings better performance and visual feast to players.\n\nSmartworld Score\n\nASUS ROG RYUO III 360 ARGB is a product for the few. Not so much because of the (very high) cost and its peculiar design, but because it needs to be placed in the right context to shine as it deserves. The AniMe Matrix LED display is a one-of-a-kind item that allows you to experiment with effects and animations. For this, the ROG RYUO III 360 ARGB deserves to be in a build with an aggressive look, full of other components with RGB LEDs and lots of colored lighting.\n\nSmartworld Score\n\nASUS ROG RYUO III 360 ARGB is a product for the few.
