The Bank of Jamaica, which was established in 1960, issues and manages the currency.\n\nInitially, the denominations of coins were:\n\n1 cent\n\n5 cents\n\n10 cents\n\n20 cents\n\n25 cents\n\nThe banknote denominations were:\n\n50 cents\n\nJ$1\n\nJ$2\n\nJ$10\n\nAll the Jamaican banknotes have the same design.\n\nThey have portraits of Jamaican national heroes and prime ministers on the front. But they feature images of memorable cultural scenes and landmarks on the back.\n\nThe goal of that design is to celebrate the Jamaican culture.\n\nSince its introduction, the Jamaican dollar has been devalued a few times because of the high inflation during the 80s and 90s.\n\nUsing Money in Jamaica\n\nWhen visiting Jamaica, it would be best to carry Jamaican and US dollars.\n\nYouâll be using the Jamaican dollar for:\n\nBuying items at smaller shops\n\nPurchasing meals at restaurants\n\nYou can use the US dollars in tourist hotspots and also to tip the service people you like.\n\nYouâll find a lot of ATMs in the major cities and tourist areas where you can withdraw Jamaican dollars. However, if youâre looking to get more favorable exchange rates, you should go to a bank or a licensed cambio.\n\nIn most cases, hotels and airports will have ATMs that offer you worse exchange rates compared to a bank. Make sure you speak to your bank about your trip, so they donât block your card when youâre in Jamaica.\n\nCommon methods of payment in Jamaica\n\nThe most common payment method in Jamaica is cash, especially in rural areas. A large portion of the Jamaican population is still unbanked, so cash is still king.\n\nBut if youâll be spending most of your time in tourist destinations, youâll be able to use digital payment options.\n\nYou can use debit and credit cards, both Visa and Mastercard, in most tourist areas and hotels.\n\nThere are also digital payment platforms like mobile wallets like Lynk and MyCash, which you can use to:\n\nStore funds\n\nMake payments\n\nTransfer money\n\nCan you use CAD in Jamaica?\n\nLetâs answer the most pressing question â does Jamaica accept Canadian currency?\n\nThe answer is âNo.â\n\nThey do accept US dollars, though.\n\nHowever, the Canadian dollar (CAD) is one of the four currencies you can convert in Jamaica next to the US dollar, Euro, and the British pound.\n\nSo even though Jamaica doesnât accept CAD, you can exchange your CAD for Jamaican dollars at local banks and currency bureaus known as âcambios.â\n\nAlso, some hotels and resorts will help you exchange your currency.\n\nYou might encounter large establishments like hotels or resorts that accept Canadian dollars, but you should keep in mind that the exchange rate will not be favorable to you.\n\nIf youâll be arriving with Canadian dollars in Jamaica, make sure you exchange them at a local bank, so you can more easily make purchases.\n\nHow do Canadians exchange CAD to JMD?\n\nWhen visiting Jamaica, there are a few ways you can exchange your Canadian dollars for Jamaican dollars.\n\nThe most popular (and secure way) to exchange them is to use a bank or currency exchange office in Canada before your trip. That way, youâll have access to JMD upon arrival and also take advantage of more favorable exchange rates compared to Jamaica. Here you can see the exchange rates.\n\nIf you want to, you can withdraw money from your debit card using the ATM machines in Jamaica. One of the biggest Canadian banks, Scotiabank, has its own ATMs in Jamaica. So, if youâre a customer, you can withdraw money without any additional fees.\n\nTips for exchanging\n\nThe best tip we can give you is to exchange your Canadian dollars for Jamaican dollars at your local bank in Canada before your trip.\n\nItâs the most convenient (and cheap) way to get JMD, so you can have currency on hand when you land in Jamaica.\n\nMake sure you see which Canadian bank or currency exchange offers you the best exchange rates, so you can avoid losing money before the trip.\n\nYou should avoid using places like the airport to exchange your money because youâll get less favorable rates.\n\nIf you want to exchange your CAD for JMD in Jamaica, you can use the following places:\n\nBanks\n\nCambios\n\nHotels\n\nResorts\n\nAirports\n\nThe banks and cambios you find in city centers will offer you the best rates, while hotels, resorts, and airports will offer you worse rates.\n\nKeep in mind that when youâre exchanging money in Jamaica, youâll be charged in JMD. If a local employee asks you if you want to pay in CAD, itâs best that you decline to save on the extra costs.\n\nIf you want, you can use Western Union to send CAD to Jamaica.\n\nWhat factors influence CAD to JMD exchange rate?\n\nThere are a few key factors that influence the exchange rate between Canadian dollars (CAD) and the Jamaican dollar (JMD).\n\nThese include:\n\nThe interest rates set by the Canadian central bank and the Jamaican central bank\n\nIf the Bank of Canada increases the interest rates, it would lead to more foreign investment, which will increase the demand for Canadian dollars. As a result, the Canadian dollar will become more valuable compared to the Jamaican dollar.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Bank of Jamaica raises the interest rates, it might help the JMD appreciate against the CAD.\n\nThe countriesâ inflation\n\nIf there is an increase in inflation in Canada compared to Jamaica, the Canadian dollar will lose value against the Jamaican dollar, and vice versa.\n\nEconomic growth and political stability\n\nIf the Canadian economy outperforms the Jamaican economy, the Canadian dollar will likely appreciate against the Jamaican dollar and vice versa.\n\nAlso, if thereâs political instability in either Canada or Jamaica, the currency of that nation will lose some of its value compared to the other nation.\n\nWhere can I get Jamaican Dollars in Canada?\n\nIn Canada, you can get JMD from:\n\nExchange bureaus\n\nThese are secure, but everyone will offer you different exchange rates.\n\nBanks\n\nMost Canadian banks will exchange your CAD for JMD.\n\nWestern Union\n\nOne of the best places you can use to exchange your Canadian dollars for Jamaican dollars is Western Union.
