        "text": "Language\n\nEnglish is the official language of Grenada, though most people also speak one of two creole languages, one based on English and the other on French.\n\nBoth creoles also draw on African and Indian influences, reflecting Grenada's rich cultural heritage.\n\nFood\n\nAvid foodies will find plenty of choice in Grenada, from gourmet dining to rustic local fare. The island is famous for its spices, and you'll find nutmeg used to flavor just about everything, including deliciously fragrant nutmeg ice cream.\n\nThe national dish, oil down, is a stew consisting of salted meat, breadfruit, vegetables and dumplings steamed in coconut milk, while roti, a type of wrap filled with curried meat or vegetables, is a popular snack.\n\nThe island has also become known in recent years for its production of organic cocoa, led by the pioneering Grenada Chocolate Company.\n\nThere are several rum distilleries on the island, and some of the rums produced on the island are so potent that it's illegal to transport them on a plane.\n\nTipping\n\nTipping in Grenada is discretionary and should reflect the service you have received, however a service charge of 18% is typically added to your bill in hotels and restaurants. If no service charge is added, a 10% tip is generally expected.\n\nMoney\n\nThe currency of Grenada is the Eastern Caribbean dollar (EC$ or XCD), which is pegged to the US dollar. Notes are in denominations of EC$100, 50, 20, 10 and 5. Coins are in denominations of EC$2 and EC$1, and 25, 10, 5, 2 and 1 cents.\n\nUS dollars are widely accepted on the island, though you will usually be given change in EC dollars, and at a less favorable exchange rate.\n\nCredit cards are widely accepted, and if taking travelers' checks we recommend taking them in US dollars.\n\nCommunications\n\nGrenada has a good telecommunications infrastructure, with excellent mobile coverage in St George's and the main tourist areas where high speed internet is also widely available and Wi-Fi hotspots common.\n\nThe phone code for Grenada is 473.\n\nSuggested clothing and other items\n\nGrenada is in the tropics, so cool casual cotton clothing is recommended, and if you're planning on dining in some of the more formal restaurants, men should pack a shirt, tie and jacket, and women a smart dress.\n\nIt does tend to get cooler at night, so it's also worth popping a jumper or wrap into your suitcase.\n\nPlease note that it is against the law to wear camouflage clothing in Grenada (including children) and to carry items made out of camouflage material. These will be confiscated and not returned.\n\nPublic holidays\n\nGrenada's colorful Carnival takes place in July and August, and the final two days of the festivities, which fall on the second Monday and Tuesday of August, are both public holidays.\n\nJanuary 1st - New Year's Day\n\nFebruary 7th - Independence Day\n\nGood Friday\n\nEaster Monday\n\nWhit Monday (50 days after Easter)\n\nCorpus Christi (Thursday of the week following Whit Monday)\n\nMay 1st - Labour Day\n\nFinal 2 Days of Carnival - July/August\n\nAugust 3rd - Emancipation Day\n\nOctober 25th - Thanksgiving Day *\n\nDecember 25th - Christmas Day\n\nDecember 26th - Boxing Day\n\n* Thanksgiving Day in Grenada commemorates the US invasion of 1983 and the removal of the military government."
