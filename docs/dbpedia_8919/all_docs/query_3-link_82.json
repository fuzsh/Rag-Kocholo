        "text": "So, you're curious about Puerto Rico's currency? It's simpler than you might think. Just like in any state across the U.S., Puerto Ricans use the good old American dollar. But they've got their own lingo for it, and that local flavor adds to the island vibe.\n\nKeep reading to clear all your doubts about Puerto Rico’s currency. And that’s not all: if stretching your dollar matters to you, we’ll share some tricks too, from tasty eats on a budget to savvy travel tips that'll keep more cash in your pocket. We'll also cover other essential travel recommendations to prepare you for your Puerto Rican adventure.\n\nAnd let’s not forget—the must-see spots! We’ve pinpointed top attractions that make this destination unforgettable. Get ready; we’re diving into all things Puerto Rican, currency and beyond.\n\nUnderstanding Puerto Rico's currency\n\nWhat currency does Puerto Rico use?\n\nPuerto Rico rolls with the U.S. dollar, so there's no need to play the exchange rate game when you're planning your trip. The convenience of using the same currency as mainland USA can't be overstated—no confusing conversions or pesky foreign transaction fees nipping at your wallet. Just straight-up spending just like back home.\n\nHow much is the U.S. dollar worth in Puerto Rico?\n\nYour dollars have equal power here as they do stateside because it's literally the same money. But what makes this cool for travelers is how far your buck can go on local experiences and goods compared to tourist traps.\n\nThe cost of living can vary though; some things might be cheaper than what you’re used to back home, others not so much—it all depends on where and how you spend your money. Eating where locals eat and shopping where they shop can mean more bang for fewer bucks, which translates into more empanadillas per dinero.\n\nHow do locals refer to dollars in Puerto Rico?\n\nA rose by any other name would smell as sweet—and a dollar goes by many names across different lands—but what about when strolling through San Juan and other parts of Puerto Rico? Well, many folks around these parts keep it simple: \"dólares\" if speaking Spanish or plain old “dollars” for English speakers.\n\nBut don’t be surprised if someone tosses around terms like ‘pesos’—it’s just local lingo for dollars. In more casual chats at local spots, you might also hear people calling cash “chavos”, or ‘chavitos’ when talking coins—that's local speak for a penny or 1-cent.\n\nBudget-friendly travel in Puerto Rico\n\nDreaming up ways to stretch those dólares during your tropical adventure? Smart thinking. Here are some ideas for keeping costs low without skimping on experiences:\n\nPounce on public transportation opportunities instead of renting cars daily—the guaguas (buses) will give both your wallet and sense of adventure a healthy boost. Getting around like locals do is both cheaper and more culturally enriching.\n\nTo dine cheaply but deliciously, skip fancy restaurants with their \"tourist prices.\" Instead, opt-in for comida criolla from roadside stands or small cafés known as fondas (family-owned restaurants specialized in authentic Puerto Rican comfort food).\n\nIf you've got access to a kitchenette (think hostels or some B&Bs), cooking meals using fresh produce from mercados (markets) can slash dining costs big time.\n\nKeep reading: How to plan a budget-friendly trip around the world\n\nAffordable accommodation in Puerto Rico\n\nWant to make your increase your money’s worth in Puerto Rico? Accommodation is the highest cost in most trips, so saving up in this area is going to help you a lot. Sure, hotels are nice, but they can gobble up your funds. An easy alternative are hostels, which are wallet-friendly and sociable.\n\nBut what if we told you there's an even better way? Enter Worldpackers' work exchange programs. This platform lets travelers help with anything from reception duties to mural painting or gardening in exchange for free lodging. Many hosts also throw in extra perks like meals or surfboard rentals.\n\nThere are plenty of cool work exchange opportunities in Puerto Rico. You just need to sign up for free at the Worldpackers website and use the platform’s filters to search for the tasks, benefits and locations that best suit your needs. You can even save your favorites by clicking on the little heart that shows up on top.\n\nOnce you’ve chosen one or more volunteering spot you’d like to apply for, just finish setting up your profile, pay the platform’s small annual fee and send your application to the hosts. If you have any questions about the position, feel free to ask the host or previous volunteers by using Worldpackers’ messaging system.\n\nYou might also like to read:\n\nTraveling with Worldpackers: your top questions answered\n\nHow to find volunteering opportunities around the world\n\n10 ways to learn Spanish fast and make your dreams come true\n\nLook at some of the positions for volunteering and saving money in Puerto Rico:\n\nBoutique Hostel in the heart of Old San Juan\n\nThis boutique hostel welcomes travelers from all over the world. You can help them at the reception and with the general maintenance of the hostel, and they cover your stay in a private dorm, laundry, free Wi-Fi, employee discount at their restaurant, and help planning your time in beautiful Puerto Rico (beaches, tours, trips, mountain hikes - just ask!).\n\n“I had a great time volunteering at the hostel! Everyone was extremely kind, helpful, and welcoming. The work is very fair and I enjoyed it: mostly cleaning/housekeeping work with some reception. It's well worth it for the trade of getting to live in one of the best places in San Juan! I felt very safe as a solo female. I felt comfortable walking alone as well which was important to me. Ubers are very cheap in San Juan! It's also easy to scooter to the beach and I recommend doing that if you don't want to walk. There's SO much to do in Puerto Rico and you will love it\", said previous volunteer Michelle, from the US.\n\nHelp on mountain top sustainable farm in Las Marias\n\nThis is a 25-acre permaculture farm dedicated to sustainability and permaculture practices. They accept volunteers all year round. Accommodation and meals are included for 20 hours of help exchange a week. The tasks are helping with their trees and garden, helping build ponds or pipe systems on the land, building an outdoor cabin, planting different trees/flowers, building a greenhouse... A lot to learn in this potentially life-changing experience!\n\n“The farm was a great environment for me. It forced me to push my boundaries doing some intense work, while also providing a clean and comfortable space to relax in. It was the perfect work/life balance and the views were beautiful. All meals were included, and a lot of the food is grown right on the farm. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a secluded space to reconnect with nature and yourself, learn something new, and meet some great people”, said Sedona, who recently volunteered there.\n\nOther travel information about Puerto Rico\n\nWhat language is spoken in Puerto Rico?\n\nPuerto Rico's got a linguistic rhythm as vibrant as its music, with Spanish taking the lead on this dance floor. Although English can get you through the tourist spots, it's Spanish that gives life to local conversations.\n\nBut don't worry if your \"Hola\" isn't perfect; Puerto Ricans are famously friendly and will happily chat with you using whatever mix of English and Spanish gets the point across.\n\nIf you're up for a challenge, why not try learning a few phrases in Spanish before your trip? It’s not just practical; it shows respect for the culture too. And who knows? You could find yourself haggling at markets or ordering food like a pro in no time.\n\nExtra tip: a work exchange where you get to interact with locals more intensely is an amazing way to learn Spanish without much effort.\n\nLearn more about Puerto Rico language and cultural facts.\n\nDo American citizens need a passport to visit Puerto Rico?\n\nAmerican wanderers rejoice.

But they can also bring about challenges such as flooding or traffic delays.\n\nBest things to do in Puerto Rico\n\nThe time-warped charm of Old San Juan\n\nCobblestone streets lined with pastel-colored houses take you back centuries as soon as you step into Old San Juan.
