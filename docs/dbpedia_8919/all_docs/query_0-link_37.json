It as also a court of first instance in certain cases (casos de corte), usually involving higher officials. It was divided into two chambers, one for criminal cases (sola del crimen). The judges of the audiencia (pidores) varied in number. In 1583 the audiencia of Mexico had six. The term was also applied to the area of district under the audiencia's jurisdiction. The five dignidades, who had other functions in addition to the two mentioned on page 9 were:\n\nDean. President of the cabildo and presided over its meetings in the absence of the bishop. He was usually its senior member. He was in charge of all ceremonies and divine worship and acted more or less as the pastor of the cathedral church.\n\nArchdeacon (arcediano).

In the sixteenth century this was the most powerful position on the cathedral chapter of Mexico.\n\nSchoolmaster (maestrescuelas). He was in charge of the cathedral school, if there was one.
