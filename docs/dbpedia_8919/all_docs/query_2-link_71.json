It borders the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other islands in the West Indies.\n\nDue to its tropical climate, picturesque nature with sandy beaches, Puerto Rico attracts a huge number of tourists from all over the globe every year. Tourism is the most important sector of the island's economy.\n\nThe population of Puerto Rico represents the descendants of Spanish colonizers, African slaves and natives of other Caribbean countries. The main ethnic groups are mulattos, white Puerto Ricans, and Afro-Puerto Ricans; the dominant religion is Catholicism, but Protestantism, Judaism, and Islam are also common. Despite the ethnic and religious diversity, Puerto Rico has an atmosphere of tolerance and harmonious coexistence among different peoples and cultures.\n\nPuerto Rico uses a currency called the Puerto Rican peso, its official abbreviation is PRP. The Puerto Rican peso was introduced by the Spanish colonial authorities in 1895, and from 1895 to 1947 the Puerto Rican peso was used in parallel with the U.S. dollar. In 1947, the peso was removed from circulation and the U.S. dollar became the official currency, but the Puerto Rican peso is still in limited use in Puerto Rico. Currently, peso banknotes are issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 pesos and are legal tender, which must be accepted by all commercial and service enterprises on an equal footing with the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate of the Puerto Rican peso is pegged to the United States dollar at a ratio of 1 dollar = 1 peso. Thus, the peso is actually the same monetary unit as the dollar, but has a different banknote design. The Puerto Rican peso is widely used in the daily life of the people of Puerto Rico, especially for cash payments in small stores, markets, and public transportation. Tourists can exchange U.S. dollars for pesos at banks and exchange offices in Puerto Rico. Peso banknotes are also popular with numismatists and botanical collectors.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, banks are open Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. On Saturday, they are open for two hours, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and on Sunday the banks are closed. Also, on the first Saturday of every month, all banks in Puerto Rico are closed. Currency exchange offices in Puerto Rico begin accepting and exchanging currency usually around 9-10 am. In addition to the Puerto Rican peso, VISA and Mastercard credit and debit cards are also often accepted in Puerto Rico. These cards are convenient for paying at a restaurant, hotel or shopping center, but they may charge an additional fee of 2.5 to 3%. However, care should be taken when using credit cards as they can be blocked by the automatic security system outside the country. Unlike many other countries, it is not customary to tip in Puerto Rico. The bill you get at restaurants or hotels usually already includes taxes and service charges. In case you want to say thank you for the excellent service, you can leave a small coin as a tip or round up the amount.\n\nPuerto Rico is characterized by a tropical climate and warm, sunny weather that prevails most of the year. This makes the island a great place for a comfortable year-round vacation.\n\nWinter (December-February) is characterized by dry and mild weather with air temperatures ranging from +21 to +27 degrees Celsius. The sun shines almost every day, there is very little precipitation.\n\nIn spring (March-May) the temperature rises to +27-32 degrees Celsius. The rainy season begins, humidity increases and short-term tropical showers occur.\n\nSummer (June-August) is the hottest season with temperatures of +32-35 degrees Celsius and high humidity up to 85-90%. Tropical cyclones and hurricanes are possible. Downpours last up to several hours.\n\nAutumn (September-November) is still warm and rainy. Temperatures are +29-32 degrees. Humidity is high.\n\nIn October-November, the last showers and cyclones of the season are possible. Thus, thanks to the tropical climate, Puerto Rico is warm and comfortable all year round. In summer it is the hottest and rainiest, in winter it is dry and mild. At any time of the year the island pleases tourists with sunny weather and swimming opportunities.\n\nThe choice of clothing for a vacation on this Caribbean island depends largely on the time of year and the plans of the traveler. Thanks to the tropical climate, it is warm all year round, so clothes should be light and comfortable.\n\nIn summer, when the air temperature reaches +30°C, outfits made of natural fabrics - cotton, linen or viscose - are best. The ideal choice for hot days - shorts, T-shirts, T-shirt dresses and tunics. Do not forget about protection from the scorching sun: hats, sunglasses, sunscreen. Shoes should also be light - sandals, flip-flops or sneakers.\n\nIn winter, the temperature drops to a comfortable +25°C during the day. At this time of year, pants, shirts and short-sleeved tops are suitable. For the evening, consider a light sweater or windbreaker.\n\nWhen visiting religious institutions, such as churches and cathedrals in Puerto Rico, it pays to be respectful and wear clothing that covers the shoulders and knees. For men, pants and a shirt with sleeves are preferred; for women, an opaque blouse and skirt below the knees are preferred.\n\nAlso responsibly approach the dress code when visiting museums, historical monuments, government institutions, refrain from too open or provocative outfits.\n\nOn city-wide holidays and festivals are also appropriate outfits of a medium degree of formality. Ladies should avoid miniskirts and deep cleavage.\n\nOf course, comfort and sun protection remain the main criteria for dressing for a vacation in Puerto Rico's hot tropical climate, but it is important to respect local cultural norms and traditions in certain public places.\n\nPuerto Rico's culture is a unique blend of European and Latin American traditions, strongly defined by historical Spanish influences, as well as African and Caribbean cultures. This mosaic character forms the island's unique cultural palette.\n\nOne of Puerto Rico's main traditions is the celebration of Christmas (Navidad), which is widely celebrated and includes costume parades, Christmas songs and the preparation of traditional foods. Another major event is the Festival of San Juan Batista, in honor of the birth of John the Baptist, where concerts, dance shows and carnivals are held. During Easter, picnics and music festivals are common, as well as exchanging gifts and preparing Easter treats.\n\nTraditional holidays and customs play a significant role in Puerto Rico's cultural life, adding a special flavor and atmosphere to the island. Christmas and the San Juan Batista Festival are particularly popular, with festive processions, musical performances and gourmet culinary traditions.\n\nWhen visiting the island, it is important to be mindful of local traditions and regulations, including the dress code, especially in religious places and at formal events, to show respect for local culture and customs. This helps to create a harmonious relationship with the locals and immerse yourself in the atmosphere of this amazing Caribbean island.\n\nTraffic on the island is heavy, especially in major cities like San Juan. During morning and evening rush hours, traffic jams can occur on the main highways. The average speed of traffic is 40-50 km/h due to congestion.\n\nSome rules are the same as in the US - driving on the right side, stopping at red lights, mandatory seat belt use. But there are some differences. The legal level of alcohol behind the wheel is 0.02%, not 0.08% as in most states. The penalties for drunk driving are very high. It is illegal to use a cell phone while driving, even with a headset.\n\nChildren under the age of 12 must be transported in special seats or boosters. Headlights must be on at all times. Overtaking is allowed only on the left. There is an unspoken rule not to overtake on the right, although in practice it is often violated.\n\nChildren under one year of age are transported in a car seat against the course of traffic. From 1 to 4 years old - in a seat appropriate to age and weight. From 4 to 12 use boosters until they reach a height of 145 cm. Children under 12 must not be placed in the front seat. Older than 12 are restrained with regular seat belts.\n\nSingle-digit roads with numbers like PR-1 are major highways with occasional traffic lights. Two-digit ones like PR-22 are new toll highways. Three-digit ones (PR-181, etc.) are smaller country highways. Four-digit ones are best not to use unless you know the area.\n\nBe careful and obey traffic rules, even if the locals don't. Police cars often drive with flashing lights but no sirens. Don't be frightened if you see them around, it doesn't mean you have violated the law. If you have any questions, you can ask the police officers.\n\nTransportation in Puerto Rico is represented by a variety of means of transportation, including cars, public transportation, cabs, and motorcycles.\n\nCars: Cars are the most common means of transportation in Puerto Rico. Many residents and tourists prefer to use their own cars for the convenience and flexibility of traveling around the island. The island's road infrastructure is quite developed, with well-marked road signs and traffic lights.\n\nPublic transportation: Public transportation in Puerto Rico is represented by buses and subways. The public transportation system is well developed in the capital San Juan, where there are many bus routes and metro stations. However, in some of the less populated areas of the island, access to public transportation may be limited.\n\nCabs: Taxis are mainly present in the cities and tourist areas. This is a convenient way to get around, especially if you need to get to remote places or don't want to worry about finding parking. Cab prices in Puerto Rico are usually fixed or based on a taximeter.\n\nMotorcycles: Motorcycles and scooters are also popular on the island, especially in urban areas. They can be convenient for navigating tight streets and avoiding traffic jams. However, care should be taken when riding a motorcycle, especially on steep and winding roads.\n\nOverall, the transportation network in Puerto Rico provides a variety of options for getting around both within and between cities. Your choice of means of transportation depends on your itinerary, convenience, and personal preferences.\n\nSpanish and English are the two most widely spoken languages in U.S.-administered Puerto Rico. The literacy rate here is as high as 99%. Prior to Spanish colonization, the island's population spoke Taino languages. The modern languages of Puerto Rico reflect both the cultural uniqueness and rich history of the region.\n\nSpanish was brought by the conquistadors in the 15th century. Since then, it has been the dominant, state and national language on the island. It is spoken by more than 95% of Puerto Rico's residents and is used in everyday communication, education and business. It is also the official language of the country. Over the centuries, a dialect of Spanish has been formed with borrowings from African and Taino languages, as well as English words, however, the Puerto Rican version of Spanish is understood by native speakers from other countries, and they can speak it freely.\n\nEnglish also has official language status in Puerto Rico, although it is spoken by less than 10% of the island's population. The language came into existence after the United States took the island from Spain in 1898. American authorities introduced English along with Spanish into government records and official communication. An attempt to make it the language of instruction in the 1930s met with public resistance. As a result, Spanish remained the primary language in Puerto Rican schools and English became a second language.\n\nThe islanders also use Spanglish, a mixture of Spanish and English. This hybrid language is common in tourist areas when communicating with foreigners.\n\nIn this way, Spanish and English reflect Puerto Rico's rich history, culture, and ties to Spain and the United States. Although English has official status, Spanish remains the primary official language for the vast majority of Puerto Rico's population, which people speak and communicate in everyday life.\n\nCell phone and internet services in Puerto Rico are provided by different providers and have their own characteristics:\n\nMobile carriers: Major carriers include Claro, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. They provide a wide range of services including 2G, 3G, 4G mobile services and the recently deployed 5G network.\n\nCoverage and Call Quality: Overall, the mobile penetration rate is around 98%, ensuring high availability of connectivity throughout the island. In major cities and tourist areas, the quality of connectivity is generally good, but remote areas may experience some limitation.\n\nMobile Plans: Mobile plans usually include unlimited calls, SMS and a certain amount of internet traffic. Users can choose from different plans depending on their needs.\n\nInternet Service Providers: The main internet providers on the island are Liberty Cablevision and Claro. They provide both wired and wireless internet services for individuals and businesses. The average internet speed in Puerto Rico is 10-25 Mbps, which provides acceptable quality for most users.\n\nThus, Puerto Rico's mobile and Internet infrastructure provides a high level of accessibility and allows residents and tourists to stay connected and enjoy the benefits of digital technology anywhere on the island.\n\nPuerto Rico's health care system is recognized as one of the best in the Caribbean. The level of medical care on the island meets the high standards adopted in the United States.\n\nThe backbone of the medical community is a significant number of highly qualified physicians educated at prestigious medical schools in the United States and Europe. Most of them speak both English and Spanish, which facilitates communication with patients.\n\nThe island's medical infrastructure is represented by both modern private clinics and state hospitals. Large multidisciplinary medical centers are available in major cities, where assistance is provided in various specializations. One of the leading medical facilities is the Ashford Memorial Hospital in San Juan, which is equipped with the latest technology.\n\nAlthough services at private hospitals may be more expensive, they usually provide a higher level of service. Public hospitals, on the other hand, provide more affordable health care for local residents.\n\nThere is a Mi Salud insurance program for low-income citizens. The pharmaceutical industry on the island is also well developed. Thus, the healthcare system in Puerto Rico provides quality medical care to both locals and tourists, which is one of the main advantages of the island in the Caribbean region.\n\nDespite this, it is advisable to purchase travel medical insurance that will cover the cost of medical treatment in case of emergency. This will provide foreign nationals with a sense of security and peace of mind during their stay on the island.\n\nWhen going on vacation to Puerto Rico, it is worth taking care of your own safety and comfort during the trip. One of the key points is the purchase of health insurance - it is an integral part of preparing for the trip.\n\nHealth insurance for Puerto Rico will cover the cost of treatment in the event of a sudden illness or injury while on vacation.

The cost depends on the age of the tourist, the duration of the trip and the amount of insurance. In addition to medical expenses, the insurance will also protect you from other troubles - flight cancellation or delay, lost luggage, problems with the hotel and transportation.\n\nWith health insurance, you can fully relax and enjoy your vacation in Puerto Rico without fear of financial problems due to unforeseen situations. Your trip will be comfortable and safe.\n\nPuerto Rico is rich in its national holidays and celebrations.
