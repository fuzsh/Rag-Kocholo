Right from the time of landing at the airport till the moment you board your return flight, you will need to use the local currency in Spain in order to pay for services and products you use in the region. Getting foreign currency for an international trip is one of the basic things you have to take care of during the planning process, alongside things like booking hotels, purchasing flight tickets, investing in international travel insurance, etc.\n\nFind everything you need to know about the currency in Spain by going through the contents of this page.\n\nWhat is the currency of Spain?\n\nThe official currency of Spain is the Euro, which was recognised as the legal tender by the Spanish government back in 2002. It replaced the previous currency, Spanish Peseta, in the country, which remained in the system from 1869 to 2002. The Euro is denoted by the symbol € and the code EUR and is the official currency in 20 of the 27 member states of the European Union, including Spain. The minor unit of the Euro is Cent, and the euro banknote denominations include €5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and €500. As for coins, the values available include 1c, 2, 5, 10c, 20, 5c, €1, as well as €2.\n\nAs of now, Euro is the only currency accepted across Spain, and there are no alternatives. If you are planning on visiting Spain for your holidays, you will need to acquire this currency. Do note that the higher denominations, such as the banknotes €200 and €500, are rarely used in day-to-day life in Spain. So, stack your travel inventory with €10, €20, €50 and €100, which makes managing money quite easy. As visitors, try to carry less in cash and more in cards, which is a much safer option.\n\nWhy do I need to have Spain currency?\n\nThere are tons of reasons why foreign tourists visiting Spain need to have Euro for their trip, such as;\n\nBasic medium of payment: One of the main reasons why tourists need to use the local currency in Spain is that it is the basic medium for making payments. The country doesn't accept any other currency except the Euro as the official legal tender.\n\nConvenience: No matter where you are in Spain, you can use the Euro to pay for the goods and services you purchase and utilise. It includes everything from paying for local transport fare to shopping for gifts and souvenirs. You may only find a handful of places that would accept other types of currency as opposed to the wide acceptance of the Euro across Spain.\n\nWidespread acceptance: Besides Spain, the Euro is widely accepted in 19 other countries under the European Union (EU), such as Portugal, Germany, France, Finland, Italy, etc. So, if you are planning on a multi-country visit, acquiring Euro for the trip is a must.\n\nEmergencies: Having the local currency in Spain on hand, in the form of cash, forex card, etc., can be very helpful in stressful and emergency situations.\n\nSkipping extra fees: Using the Euro as the prime currency to pay for services and goods in Spain will save you from the high additional fees.\n\nEven though cash is accepted all across Spain, some institutions may only have the option of making payments via a machine. In that case, you may have to use credit and debit cards, such as Visa and Mastercard, which are widely accepted in the country.\n\nHow to acquire Spain's currency?\n\nYou can acquire the local currency of Spain both before and after the commencement of your trip. Here are some of the methods you can use;\n\nForex dealer or travel agent: One of the most common ways travellers acquire foreign currency, like the Spanish euro, is via a trusted forex dealer or travel agent. You can find a reputed source in your home country and acquire Spanish currency at competitive rates a few days prior to the trip.\n\nOnline forex services: You can also acquire Spanish currency at home by opting for an online forex service. It is a great alternative to offline currency exchange, and you will be able to search and compare multiple options via this method. With most online forex services, you get the option to pick up your foreign country's currency from the nearest outlet or have it delivered to your doorstep.\n\nBanks: When it comes to foreign exchange services, banks tend to be one of the safest options. You can enquire about this service at your local bank branch before going on your trip. Currency exchange is also available at Spanish banks, however, some may only offer their service to their registered customers or have terrible exchange rates.\n\nAt the airport: As a last resort, you can opt for foreign currency exchange services at outlets available in Indian and Spanish airports. The exchange rate is not the best, so consider the aforementioned options first.\n\nSpanish bank ATMs: You can find several ATMs across both big and small cities in Spain. Most of them accept cards like Mastercards, Maestro, Visa, America Express, etc., and it is a great way to get some emergency cash on the go. However, note that the transaction fees can be a hefty one, considering you will be charged both by your bank and the ATM's bank.\n\nThroughout various parts of Spain, you may come across street vendors offering the services of money exchange. In most cases, they are a scam or rip-off, and using their services to unofficially exchange money is also illegal in Spain. If you need to exchange local currency quickly and safely, consider the services offered by Bureaux de Change, which has branches open at major airports, near train terminals and within cities in the country.\n\nTips to save money when in Spain?\n\nHere are some useful tips that can help you save money during your Spain trip;\n\nLocal currency: For your Spain trip, make sure to acquire and use the local currency, which is the Euro, throughout the journey. With local currency, you will be able to avoid additional transaction charges and conversion fees that one normally has to pay when using other currencies.\n\nPrepaid cards: Look for prepaid tourist cards in Spain, which will help you save a huge chunk of change when using local public transport.

A great method locals use to save a decent chunk of change on food is by ordering from the \"Menu del Dia\" during the daytime. For instance, a renowned family restaurant, La Palmera in Barcelona, offers a six-course tasting menu at noon for under €30 with a drink and some desserts, from Tuesday to Friday.

As the official legal tender in the country, Euro is the primary means to settle all financial obligations in Spain. Indian Rupees (INR) and other forms of currency are not officially accepted in the country, however, some institutions and establishments may accept United States Dollars (USD) but can charge high fees.\n\nA pro tip is that you should take care of the currency exchange aspect a few days in advance of your trip's departure day.
