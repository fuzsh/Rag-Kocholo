The Real or Reale (symbol R), also known as the Spanish real, was a unit of currency minted and used in Spain and its colonies through several centuries since the 14th century.

History[]

During the Reconquista in the 14th century, the real was Spain's most common currency.[1] The real later made its way to the New World following the Spanish Empire's expansion to create colonies, so that by the Golden Age of Piracy, it was the currency used throughout the West Indies.[2] The real is still the currency of modern Brazil.[3]
