The Tuvaluan Monarchy

Tuvalu is one of 15 independent nations, known as Commonwealth realms, which shares its sovereign with other monarchies in the Commonwealth of Nations, with the monarch's relationship with Tuvalu completely independent from his position as monarch of any other realm; despite sharing the same person as their respective monarch, each of the Commonwealth realms, including Tuvalu, is sovereign and independent of the others. The Tuvaluan monarch is represented in the country by a viceroy, the governor-general of Tuvalu.
