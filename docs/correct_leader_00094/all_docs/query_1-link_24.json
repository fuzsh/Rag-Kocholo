        "text": "Kausea Natano (born 5 July 1957) served as the Prime Minister of Tuvalu from 19 September 2019 until January 2024. He represented Funafuti as a Member of Parliament. He was first elected in the 2002 Tuvaluan general election and served as an MP until he was unseated in the 2024 Tuvaluan general election.\n\nIn his political career, Natano has also assumed significant roles, including Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Communications, during his tenure in the Cabinet led by former Prime Minister Willy Telavi.\n\nEarly life\n\nBefore he entered politics, Natano worked as the director of customs in Tuvalu. He also held the position of assistant secretary in the ministry of finance, where he contributed to economic planning.\n\nPolitical career\n\nMember of Parliament\n\nKausea Natano entered Tuvalu's Parliament in 2002, marking the start of his political career. He secured re-election in 2006 with 340 votes. He also took on the role of Minister for Public Utilities and Industries until 2010 as part of Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia's Cabinet. His continuous commitment to public service was evident as he retained his parliamentary seat in the 2010, 2015, and 2019 general elections.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister (2010–2013)\n\nFollowing the 2010 general election, Natano stood for the premiership, and received seven votes from MPs, thus being narrowly defeated by Maatia Toafa, who received eight. In December 2010, Toafa's government was ousted in a motion of no confidence, and Willy Telavi succeeded to the premiership. Natano was among those who supported Telavi, enabling his accession. Upon appointing his Cabinet on December 24, Telavi appointed Natano as Minister for Communications. He was also appointed Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nFollowing the removal of Prime Minister Willy Telavi by Governor General Sir Iakoba Italeli on 1 August 2013, prompted by a political crisis where Telavi sought to govern without Parliament's support, the subsequent day saw a parliamentary vote. In this vote, Natano and the entire Cabinet were ousted from office, as the opposition had gained a clear majority.\n\nPremiership (2019–2024)\n\nSee also: Natano Ministry\n\nFollowing the 2019 Tuvaluan general election, on 19 September 2019, the members of parliament elected Natano as prime minister with a 10–6 majority.\n\nDuring his ministry, the economy of Tuvalu experienced challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, the IMF Article IV consultation with Tuvalu concluded that a successful vaccination strategy allowed Tuvalu to lift coronavirus disease (COVID-19) containment measures at the end of 2022. However, the economic cost of the pandemic was significant, with real gross domestic product growth falling from 13.8% in 2019 to -4.3 percent in 2020, although it recovered to 1.8% in 2021. Inflation rose to 11.5% in 2022, but inflation is project to fall to 2.8% by 2028.\n\nThe increase in inflation in 2022 was due to the rapid rise in the cost of food resulting from a drought that affected food production and from rising global food prices, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (food imports represent 19 percent of Tuvalu’s GDP, while agriculture makes up for only 10 percent of GDP).\n\nOn 26 September 2023, the World Bank (WB) approved US$11.5 million (AUD$18 million) in new grant financing to Tuvalu as part of the WB’s First Climate and Disaster Resilience Development Policy Financing program. This WB support includes a development policy grant of US$7.5 million (AU$11.8 million) This grant is directed to assisting Tuvalu's National Disaster Management Office in coordinating post-disaster response activities; as well to the work of Tuvalu’s National Building Code Assessment Unit, of the Public Works Department, to develop more disaster-resilient infrastructure in Tuvalu.\n\nOn 10 November 2023, Natano signed the Falepili Union, a bilateral diplomatic relationship with Australia, under which Australia will increase its contribution to the Tuvalu Trust Fund and to TCAP. Australia will also provide an pathway for citizens of Tuvalu to migrate to Australia, to enable climate-related mobility for Tuvaluans.\n\nForeign policy and climate change initiatives\n\nDuring his ministry, Tuvalu implemented the National Adaptation Programme of Action as a response to the climate change issues facing Tuvalu, including the Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project (TCAP). The Natano Ministry continued the constitutional reform project that had commenced in 2016 in the Sopoaga Ministry. On 5 September 2023, Tuvalu’s parliament passed the Constitution of Tuvalu Act 2023, with the changes to the Constitution came into effect on 1 October 2023.\n\nThe 2023 amendments to the Constitution adopt an innovative approach to determining the boundaries of the State of Tuvalu in the event that climate change results in sea level rise that causes loss to the physical territory of Tuvalu.\n\nSection 2(1) states \"The State of Tuvalu within its historical, cultural, and legal framework shall remain in perpetuity in the future, notwithstanding the impacts of climate change or other causes resulting in loss to the physical territory of Tuvalu.\"\n\nSection 2(2) declares \"The area of Tuvalu consists of all areas bounded by baseline coordinates including maritime zones measured from such baseline coordinates declared in Schedule 6 (Declaration of Tuvalu Geographical Coordinates).\"\n\nThe government of Tuvalu recognises that there is no international conventions that it can rely on that can recognise Tuvalu's new status as the effects of climate change are not addressed in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nTuvalu, and other Pacific Ocean countries, support such a position on the impact on territorial boundaries caused by climate change. The leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum countries published a declaration on 6 August 2021 that recalling that Pacific Islands Forum Members have a long history of support for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (the \"Convention\"), and which declaration ended with a proclamation: \"that our maritime zones, as established and notified to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in accordance with the Convention, and the rights and entitlements that flow from them, shall continue to apply, without reduction, notwithstanding any physical changes connected to climate change-related sea-level rise.\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe is married to Selepa Kausea Natano.\n\nSee also\n\nIn Spanish: Kausea Natano para niños"
