        "text": "Carpetbaggers and con men regularly hit the Pacific. They are so common, and at times so ingenious, Lonely Planet could usefully consider a conman’s guide to the Pacific.\n\nNevada real estate millionaire Michael J Oliver saw Minerva Reef on a map, between Tonga and New Zealand, shipped topsoil to it and on 19 January 1972 (I had been a working journalist for a month) raised the flag of the new Republic of Minerva. He promised ‘no taxation, welfare, subsidies, or any form of economic interventionism’.\n\nKing Taufa’ahau Tupou IV responded by loading the royal yacht with 90 prisoners and a four-piece police band. They sailed south and the flag came down. The band played as the Tongan flag rose again. In 1982, Oliver’s band tried unsuccessfully again.\n\nMinerva had a curious echo for me."
