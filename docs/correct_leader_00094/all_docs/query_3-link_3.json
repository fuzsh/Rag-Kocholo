        "text": "This paper first outlines the underlying causes of instability in Nauru and Tuvalu. The problems that executive instability causes in both countries will also be explained. The third section of this paper considers various legislative and constitutional provisions from other Pacific island countries that could be used to control the problem. The first provision that will be discussed was selected from the Constitution of Kiribati, specifically s 32, concerning the way which a president is elected. This provision was selected not only because of Kiribati’s political stability but also because there have been multiple occasions where this provision has been recommended for adoption in Nauru and Tuvalu. The second provision that has been selected is from the 1963 Electoral Act of Samoa. The newly introduced s 15 F was chosen given that it controls party-hopping in Samoa. In Nauru and Tuvalu’s context such provision would address the issue of floor-crossing which is another cause of instability. The last legal control in this research paper is the 2003 Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidacy Act of Papua New Guinea, which deals with restricting the ability to vote on motions of no confidence. In conclusion, a summary of which control(s) are more suitable for Nauru and Tuvalu will be explained.\n\nThe paper analyses the Kiribati traditional and the western democratic political system and discusses how the current modern political system is adopted and accepted as a way of governing the people. It also analyses issues faced in adopting the new system of governing and suggests ways forward in making the two systems work in harmony, as well as, in trying to involve the people in the new western democratic system.\n\nThis article is a case note of Guadalcanal Provincial Assembly v The Speaker of National Parliament and the Minister for Provincial Government unreported, High Court, Solomon Islands, cc 309/96, 26 February 1997. The decision is a constitutional law case from the Solomon Islands filed by the applicant in response to the passing of the Provincial Government Act 1996. The author first introduces the political framework of the Solomon Islands, and then discusses the decision itself. The author then comments on the decision: first on the interpretation of the Constitution of the Solomon Islands, secondly on the role of Chiefs and Elders, and finally on the changes in the bench."
