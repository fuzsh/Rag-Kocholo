        "text": "Port Overview\n\nTuvalu has one port situated on Fongafale Island on the E side of Funafuti atoll.

However, this does not exempt the northern eight islands from adverse effects of tropical cyclone and extreme events.\n\nThe wet season of Tuvalu is plagued by tropical depressions that could become tropical cyclones or destructive hurricanes.\n\nNatural hazards in Tuvalu include tropical cyclones, storm surge, drought, inundation, coastal erosion and pest infestation.\n\nEach year, one or a combination of natural hazards, adversely affects the livelihood of the people on all of the islands.\n\nNatural Disasters\n\nDue to the low-lying nature of the atolls, rising sea levels arising from climate change compound existing threats. In terms of priority, the greatest disaster threats facing Tuvalu are cyclone, drought and tsunami\n\nFor a more detailed database on disasters by country, please see the Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters - please note that no data is currently available for Tuvalu\n\nSeasonal Effects on Logistics Capacities\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nThe National Disaster Council is the principal executing body at national level acting on behalf of Cabinet. The NDC is the peak decision-making body during times of disaster, providing advice to Cabinet on strategic decisions e.g. the need for international assistance.\n\nThe Council comprises:\n\nSecretary to Government (Chair)\n\nCommissioner of Police\n\nSecretary – Ministry of Home Affairs and Rural Development\n\nSecretary, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development\n\nSecretary, Ministry of Natural Resources\n\nSecretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tourism, Trade, Environment and Labour\n\nPermanent Secretary, Ministry of Communications and Transport\n\nPermanent Secretary, Ministry of Health\n\nPermanent Secretary, Ministry of Public Utilities and Infrastructure\n\nPermanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports\n\nPermanent Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister (OPM)\n\nDirector, Public Works\n\nSecretary, Funafuti Kaupule (traditional assembly of elders on each of the islands of Tuvalu)\n\nGeneral Secretary, Tuvalu Red Cross\n\nDisaster Policy Coordinator (Director NDMO)\n\nOn occasion, partner agencies may be invited to sit in NDC meetings as observers.\n\nWhen a disaster is declared, Foreign Affairs notifies international partners (governments, humanitarian agencies etc.) if assistance is needed\n\nThe role of the Police during disasters is to act as first responders during emergencies and on the outer islands often take the leadership role during disasters/emergencies in coordination with the Disaster Island Committee and assist in assessment and distribution of relief supplies.\n\nThere is no military force and no defence or civil defence assets, In the event that military aid is supplied from overseas, the Police Commissioner would be the focal point for interaction.\n\nFor more information on government contact details, please see the following link: 4.1 Government Contact List\n\nHUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY\n\nThe Tuvalu Red Cross delivers programmes on Disaster Management, Health and First Aid. It operates from national to community levels in providing disaster preparedness and response support.\n\nRed Cross has prepositioned NFI stocks in 20’ containers on the islands of Nanumaga, Nanumea, Niu. Nukufetau, Niutao, Nukulaelae, Vaitupu in addition to stocks at the main depot in Funafuti.\n\nSee Annex 5.6\n\nThe Australian High Commission as represented by the Maritime Surveillance Advisor based with the police. The Maritime Surveillance Advisor provides support through the Australian delivered Defence Cooperation Programme. The Advisor provides a number of support activities in areas such as maritime security, border control, search and rescue support.\n\nThe NZ Aid Programme has an office however it is not a fully-fledged High Commission; rather the office manages projects funded by New Zealand as well as any assistance work funded by New Zealand.\n\nThere is a joint UN office in Tuvalu. During crises, the Joint Presence Office (JPO) reports to UNDSS and the UNDP office in Suva.\n\nUNDP has a permanent staff and ongoing projects including the Tuvalu Coastal Adaption Project (TCAP) aimed at reducing vulnerability and resilience building in relation to climate risks (more information available at https://tcap.tv/about-tcap) for a list of their other ongoing programmes please see Annex 5.2\n\nUNICEF is present and running programmes centring on child welfare in schools, health and immunisation.\n\nFor more information on humanitarian agency contact details, please see the following link: 4.2 Humanitarian Agency Contact List\n\nNational disaster risk management structure for Tuvalu (during crisis)\n\nOverview\n\nDue to the small population and limited local demand, it is unlikely an agency will be able to procure many of the services required to support programme needs based on the availability of the market. There are no specialist IT and technical support services.\n\nFor more information on company contact details, please see the following link:4.11 Additional Services Contact List\n\nAccommodation\n\nThere is limited accommodation available on the main island of Funafuti including 2 hotels and several lodges and guest houses totalling around 150 beds.\n\nThere is no accommodation on the outer islands other than staying with families or sleeping in schools. There are no restaurants on the outer islands.\n\nSecurity, in relation to accommodation, is not a problem in Tuvalu, however there is limited capacity to support a large influx of demand.\n\nElectricity and Power\n\nTuvalu Electricity Corporation (TEC) is a state-owned enterprise. It is the sole provider of electricity services to Tuvalu.\n\nAll power sockets in Tuvalu provide a standard voltage of 220V with a standard frequency of 50Hz. Type I plug outlets are used in Tuvalu.\n\nAll the islands are on 24/7-power supply and the access rate is 100%. The main island of Funafuti has some solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems tied to the grid with diesel base load generators. The outer islands are powered by hybrid solar PV systems with diesel generator on standby.\n\nFunafuti has a current peak load of 1.35 MW, which is forecast to increase to 2.82 MW in 2045.\n\nPower supply is adequate for the country’s present requirements. Power outages occur occasionally on Funafuti for an hour or less. On the outer islands power is often turned off regularly later in the evenings.\n\nElectricity and Power Summary Table\n\nProduction Unit\n\nType\n\n(Hydroelectric, Thermal, etc.)\n\nInstalled capacity (MW)\n\nCurrent Production (MW)\n\nGenerator\n\nSolar\n\nFogafale\n\nSolar/ diesel generator hybrid\n\n0.6\n\n0.756\n\nNanumea\n\nSolar/ diesel generator hybrid\n\n0.138\n\n0.795\n\nNanumaga\n\nSolar/ diesel generator hybrid\n\n0.128\n\n0.205\n\nNiutao\n\nSolar/ diesel generator hybrid\n\n0.128\n\n0.230\n\nNui\n\nSolar/ diesel generator hybrid\n\n0.144\n\n0.070\n\nVaitupu\n\nSolar/ diesel generator hybrid\n\n0,208\n\n0.400\n\nMotofoua Secondary School\n\nSolar/ diesel generator hybrid\n\nNil\n\n0.046\n\nNukufetau\n\nSolar/ diesel generator hybrid\n\n0.144\n\n0.087\n\nNukulaelae\n\nSolar/ diesel generator hybrid\n\n0.91\n\n0.045\n\nFinancial Services\n\nThe country’s finance sector consists of two banks, the National Bank of Tuvalu and the Development Bank of Tuvalu: a national provident fund, and a Western Union agent with a handful of small, informal moneylenders. The National Bank of Tuvalu, which has 90% of total banking sector assets, focuses on lending to the household sector and providing home loans, while the Development Bank of Tuvalu supports public and private enterprises. The banking sector in Tuvalu is effectively unregulated.\n\nNational Bank Of Tuvalu (NBT)\n\nThe Government has a shareholding of 60 per cent and Westpac, 40 per cent. It is a full service bank operating a main branch (in Funafuti) and eight agencies. All outer islands have an agency.\n\nIn April 2020, the NBT lost its corresponding banking relationship (CBR) with Australian banks, which inhibits the flow of remittances and foreign exchange transactions, although the NBT continues to have a CBR with the Bank of Hawaii and has developed a CBR with the BRED Bank Fiji.
