General elecons are held every four years and by-elecons are held when a casual vacancy occurs in the membership of Parliament. There are no formal pares and none of the tradional debates along policy lines amongst candidates. Contestants are mainly elected on the basis of family, educaon and training, community parcipaon, religious aﬃliaons, and previous work experience. The paper concludes with some recommendaons for improving future elecons including a proper harmonisaon of all legislave provisions impacng on elecons. Word count: 7,360. Key words: polics, elecons, Tuvalu, parliament Introducon In the last 37 years since independence, general elecons are now entrenched in the polical landscape of Tuvaluan society. Tuvalu last held a general elecon on 31 March 2015. Tuvalu’s new Government was sworn in on 10 April 2015 with incumbent Prime Minister Enele Sopoanga returned and leading a Cabinet largely unchanged from the previous government. The Tuvalu Parliament consists of 15 members of Parliament; two MPs are ﬁelded by seven of the eight electoral districts, whilst one, Nukulaelae, returns one MP. Parliament is elected under a system of universal, cizen 2 , adult suﬀrage, and all contested elecons of members of Parliament is held by secret ballot. General elecons are held every four years and held as soon as praccable aﬅer the dissoluon of Parliament. A by-elecon is held as soon as praccable aﬅer the occurrence of any casual vacancy in the membership of Parliament. In the absence of any formal polical pares, and therefore party policies, polical elecons tend to focus on polics at a more personal level - around communies, government, opposion members, and generally about the behaviour of the more inﬂuenal policians. This paper is a quick brief snapshot of the polical history of Tuvalu and the 2015 general elecon. The paper begins by brieﬂy seng the context of the 2015 general elecon, describes the candidates who stood from each of 1 The author works for the New Zealand Aid Programme in the Ministry of Foreign Aﬀairs and Trade.

A brief commentary is provided about past heads of government and the challenges of the opposion as a group wanng to form an alternave government. Some recommendaons are included on ways which may improve general elecons in the future or needing further analysis. The 2015 General Elecon Some useful context Tuvalu is made up of nine islands and atolls with a total land area of 26 square kilometres and a populaon of 12,000; about 6,000 of whom live on the capital island of Funafu. Tuvalu was formerly administered by Britain as the Ellice part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. In 1975, following a general referendum in 1974, Tuvalu, as the Ellice Islands part ceded from the Gilbert & Ellice Islands, and became known by its ancient name, Tuvalu. In May 1978 it declared self-government status and ﬁve months later in October 1978, a Commonwealth record, Tuvalu achieved polical independence. Tuvalu adopted a Westminster style of government with the Head of State as Queen Elizabeth II, represented locally by a Governor-General. 3 Tuvalu’s major source of income (remiances, foreign aid ﬂows, dividends from the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF), and ﬁsheries revenue) ﬂuctuate with the global economy. These factors, and Tuvalu’s high dependence on oil, make its economy extremely vulnerable to external shocks. These factors, along with the country’s geographical isolaon and vulnerability to natural disasters, contributed to the UN’s 2009 declaraon that Tuvalu, according to the Economic Vulnerability Index, ranks as the most economically vulnerable country in the world. Tropical Cyclone Pam delayed the general elecons Between 10-11 March 2015 Tropical Cyclone Pam struck Tuvalu. The damaging storm surge forced a State of Emergency declaraon on 13 March 2015 4 under the Emergencies and Threatened Emergencies (Special Powers) Act. The storm’s impacts were also felt in other islands of the Paciﬁc, especially Vanuatu and Solomon Islands. Whilst the eye of the storm was some 800 miles away from Tuvalu resulng in minimal infrastructure damage, the impact on Tuvalu was intense and sustained. Storm surges through the erosion of the coastlines caused ﬂooding and intrusion of seawater through crops and trees, resulng in State of Emergency. As the State of Emergency connued, the 3 The privileges and funcons of the Sovereign as Head of State may be had and performed through a Governor-General appointed in accordance with Division 3 (the Governor-General) of the Tuvalu Constuon and, except where the context requires otherwise, references in any law to the Head of State shall be read as including a reference to the Governor- General. 4 Prime Minister’s Press Release dated 13 March 2015, Oﬃce of the Prime Minister, Government of Tuvalu states that the implicaons of the situaon on holding the general elecons scheduled for 19 March 2015 were being monitored by the Government.
