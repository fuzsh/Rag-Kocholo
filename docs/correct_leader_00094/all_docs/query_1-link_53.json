        "text": "Quick facts for kids\n\nPrime Minister of Tuvalu\n\nState Flag of Tuvalu\n\nCoat of Arms of Tuvalu\n\nIncumbent\n\nFeleti Teo\n\nsince 26 February 2024\n\nStyle The Right Honourable Appointer Elected by the members of the parliament Term length While commanding the confidence of the majority of members of parliament. No term limits are imposed on the office. Inaugural holder Toaripi Lauti Formation 1 October 1978 Salary AU$ 40,840/US$ 26,660 annually\n\nThe prime minister of Tuvalu is the country's head of government. According to Tuvalu's constitution, the prime minister must always be a member of the parliament and is elected by parliament in a secret ballot. Because there are no political parties in Tuvalu, any member of parliament can be nominated for the role.\n\nPart V, section 62 of the Constitution of Tuvalu describes the vesting of the executive authority:\n\n(1) The executive authority of Tuvalu is primarily vested in the Sovereign, and the Governor-General as the representative of the Sovereign.\n\n(2) The executive authority so vested in the Sovereign shall be exercised in accordance with section 53 (performance of functions by the Head of State).\n\nFollowing the parliamentary vote, the governor-general of Tuvalu is responsible for swearing in as the prime minister the person who commands the confidence of a majority of members of parliament.\n\nPart V of the Constitution establishes the executive authority of Tuvalu and confirms that while the Prime Minister is the head of government, executive power is exercised by ministerial government, with Part V, section 67 to 69 establishing the role of the cabinet.\n\nThe office of prime minister was established when Tuvalu gained independence in 1978. However, the post is sometimes considered a continuation of the earlier office of chief minister, created in 1975. If the prime minister dies, as has happened on one occasion, the deputy prime minister becomes acting prime minister until a new one is elected by parliament. The prime minister can lose his office by resigning, being defeated in a motion of no confidence by parliament, or losing his seat in a parliamentary election.\n\nPart V, Section 63 of the Constitution of Tuvalu establishes the office of Prime Minister. Under section 64, the Prime Minister is elected by the members of parliament, with sections 64 to 67 describing what happens if the office of the Prime Minister becomes vacant, the removal from office of an incapacitated Prime Minister, the process for the suspension of the Prime Minister, and the effect of removal or suspension of the Prime Minister.\n\nUntil the Second Toafa Ministry in 2010, the prime minister also had the role of foreign minister. Enele Sopoaga was the foreign minister in the short-lived Second Toafa Ministry. In subsequent ministries, foreign affairs was another minister's responsibility in the cabinet.\n\nSeveral former prime ministers have been appointed the governor-general of Tuvalu.\n\nFeleti Teo was appointed as prime minister on 26 February 2024, after he was elected unopposed by the parliament.\n\nList of prime ministers\n\nOverview of Prime Ministers of Tuvalu No. Portrait Name\n\n(Birth–Death) Election Term of office Ministry Governor-General Monarch Took office Left office Time in office Chief Minister of the Ellice Islands (1975–1978) 1 Sir Toaripi Lauti\n\n(1928–2014) — 2 October 1975 1 October 1978 2 years, 364 days Lauti Ministry\n\n1st Ministry John Hillary Smith Queen Elizabeth II Prime Minister of Tuvalu (1978–present) 1 Sir Toaripi Lauti\n\n(1928–2014) 1977 1 October 1978 8 September 1981 2 years, 342 days Lauti Ministry\n\n1st Ministry Sir Fiatau Penitala Teo Queen Elizabeth II 2 Tomasi Puapua\n\n(born 1938) 1981\n\n1985 8 September 1981 16 October 1989 8 years, 38 days First Puapua Ministry\n\nSecond Puapua Ministry\n\n2nd Ministry Sir Tupua Leupena 3 Bikenibeu Paeniu\n\n(born 1956) 1989\n\n1993 (Sep) 16 October 1989 10 December 1993 4 years, 55 days First Paeniu Ministry\n\n3rd Ministry Sir Toaripi Lauti Sir Tomu Sione 4 Sir Kamuta Latasi\n\n(born 1936) 1993 (Nov) 10 December 1993 24 December 1996 3 years, 14 days Latasi Ministry\n\n4th Ministry Sir Tulaga Manuella (3) Bikenibeu Paeniu\n\n(born 1956) 1993 (Nov)\n\n1998 24 December 1996 27 April 1999 2 years, 124 days Second Paeniu Ministry\n\nThird Paeniu Ministry\n\n5th Ministry Sir Tomasi Puapua 5 Ionatana Ionatana\n\n(1938–2000) 1998 27 April 1999 8 December 2000 1 year, 225 days Ionatana Ministry\n\n6th Ministry Acting Lagitupu Tuilimu — 8 December 2000 24 February 2001 78 days Tuilimu Ministry\n\n6th Ministry (Cont.) 6 Faimalaga Luka\n\n(1940–2005) 1998 24 February 2001 14 December 2001 293 days Luka Ministry\n\n7th Ministry 7 Koloa Talake\n\n(1934–2008) 1998 14 December 2001 2 August 2002 231 days Talake Ministry\n\n8th Ministry 8 Saufatu Sopoanga\n\n(1952–2020) 2002 2 August 2002 27 August 2004 2 years, 25 days Sopoanga Ministry\n\n9th Ministry Faimalaga Luka 9 Maatia Toafa\n\n(born 1954) 2002 27 August 2004 14 August 2006 1 year, 352 days First Toafa Ministry\n\n10th Ministry Sir Filoimea Telito 10 Apisai Ielemia\n\n(1955–2018) 2006 14 August 2006 29 September 2010 4 years, 46 days Ielemia Ministry\n\n11th Ministry Sir Kamuta Latasi Sir Iakoba Italeli (9) Maatia Toafa\n\n(born 1954) 2010 29 September 2010 24 December 2010 86 days Second Toafa Ministry\n\n12th Ministry 11 Willy Telavi\n\n(born 1954) 2010 24 December 2010 1 August 2013 2 years, 220 days Telavi Ministry\n\n13th Ministry 12 Enele Sopoaga\n\n(born 1956) 2010\n\n2015 1 August 2013 19 September 2019 6 years, 49 days Sopoaga Ministry\n\n14th Ministry 13 Kausea Natano\n\n(born 1957) 2019 19 September 2019 26 February 2024 4 years, 160 days Natano Ministry\n\n15th Ministry Mrs. Teniku Talesi,\n\nSamuelu Teo 14 Feleti Teo\n\n(born 1962) 2024 26 February 2024 Incumbent 146 days Teo Ministry\n\n16th Ministry Sir Tofiga Vaevalu Falani King Charles III\n\nNotes\n\nTuilimu served as acting prime minister following the death of Ionatana.\n\nSir Iakoba Italeli resigned as Governor-General on 22 August 2019 to contest a seat in parliament in the 2019 general election.\n\nSir Tofiga Vaevalu Falani was appointed as Governor-General on 29 September 2021, during the term of prime minister Kausea Natano\n\nKing Charles III acceded to the throne on 8 September 2022, during the term of prime minister Kausea Natano.\n\nSee also"
