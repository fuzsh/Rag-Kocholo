        "text": "TBILISI, Georgia: Voters in Georgia have cast ballots in a parliamentary election in which the governing party founded by a billionaire faced a challenge from an alliance built around an ex-president who has spent years in self-imposed exile.\n\nAfter the polls closed, the billionaire quickly claimed victory for the ruling party, but it wasn’t immediately clear if it won enough votes to stay at the helm. The ex-president charged that a strong performance by his alliance would allow it to form a new coalition government in the ex-Soviet nation on the Black Sea.\n\nThe Georgian Dream party, whose billionaire founder Bidzina Ivanishvili made his fortune in Russia, has held a strong majority in the 150-seat parliament for eight years, but its popularity has dwindled steadily amid the country’s economic problems.\n\nIvanishvili quickly congratulated his supporters on winning the vote after all available exit polls showed his party with a strong lead.\n\nIt needs to be emphasized that the Georgian Dream wins the elections for the third time,” he said. What our country wanted, a solid team, we have got it.\n\nBut former President Mikhail Saakashvili also described the results as a triumph for his bloc, vowing to form a coalition government with other opposition parties.\n\nThis is practically a great triumph of the Georgian opposition, despite the harassment, intimidation and pressure, he said in televised remarks from Ukraine. In these conditions, our main task is to form a government of national unity.\n\nThe Georgian economy has been badly bruised by the COVID-!19 pandemic and is expected to shrink by 5% this year, while the currency is falling sharply.\n\nThis time, Georgian Dream faced a renewed challenge from an opposition coalition of the Strength is in Unity party and Saakashvili’s United National Movement. The coalition has fielded Saakashvili as its candidate for the prime minister’s job, but he said after the vote that he wasn’t aspiring for the post, in an apparent bid to facilitate potential talks with other parties on forging an alliance.\n\nGeorgian Dream has nominated current Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia to stay on the job.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the day at a polling station after casting his ballot, Ivanishvili voiced confidence that his party would retain a strong majority and wouldn’t need to form a coalition.\n\nWe will come to power with an absolute majority, maybe not an absolute but a solid majority,” Ivanishvili said, adding that he expects Georgian Dream to win about 100 seats. We exclude (the possibility) of the coalition.\n\nUnited National Movement’s leader Grigol Vashadze said it was “absolutely determined to change the government and return Georgia to a normal way of democratic development.\n\nSaakashvili, who served as president in 2004-2013 and moved abroad when his term ended, long has vowed to drive Georgian Dream from power. He currently holds an official job in Ukraine.\n\nBoth Georgian Dream and United National Movement are pro-Western, with goals of establishing better relations and possible eventual membership of NATO and the European Union.\n\nDuring Saakashvilis rule, Russia and Georgia fought a short war in 2008 that ended with Georgia losing control of two Russia-friendly separatist regions. The issue of the regions status has remained a key irritant, but ties between Moscow and Tbilisi have improved following Saakashvilis departure.\n\nThe opposition has accused Georgian Dream of pursuing pro-Russian policies while claiming to be Western-oriented.\n\nThe Russian influence is getting larger and larger, said UNM member Khatia Dekanoidze. People are getting poorer, the economic situation is absolutely horrible and … people have already decided it is time for real change.”\n\nGeorgian parliament speaker Archil Talakvadze said the vote should help stabilize the economy and support efforts to integrate into the West.\n\nThis is Georgias new opportunity to attract more investments and Georgias new opportunity actually to complete (its) path toward European and Euro-Atlantic integration, Talakvadze told The Associated Press.\n\nAccording to constitutional amendments approved earlier this year, a party would need to secure more than 40.54% of the vote to form a government.\n\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\n\nRead all the Latest News and Breaking News here"
