        "text": "Violence, Crime & Protests\n\nHome Depot's ORC Technology Continues to Make Headlines\n\nHome Depot uses Bluetooth to prevent stolen items from working and combat organized retail crime\n\nHome Depot is piloting the technology at select locations\n\nHome Depot Inc. is using Bluetooth to deter organized retail crime, such as coordinated groups that steal from the retailer and take the goods to pawnshops or resell them on online marketplaces.\n\nHome Depot HD is piloting the use of the technology on power tools at select stores across select states. The technology activates at the cash register or other point of sale, allowing the purchased items to work once they leave the store. A stolen item equipped with this Bluetooth technology won't operate.\n\n\"The value of any product is its ability to work,\" said Christina Cornell, a spokesperson for Home Depot. \"If we take that away, there's no reason to steal it.\"\n\nThe idea is akin to the way gift cards work; on the rack, they have no value. Money is added to the cards at checkout.\n\nThe Bluetooth technology is applied on the item rather than its box or other packaging. The home-improvement chain is working with partners like Stanley Black & Decker Inc. on the program. Home Depot is considering other items with high resale value, like smart-home merchandise, for the Bluetooth effort.\n\nCornell said the company has seen an uptick in crime, and attributes it to organized groups, which may then use money from the resale of the stolen goods to fund other criminal activity.\n\nHome Depot, like many other retailers, according to Cornell, has an internal group that is dedicated to monitoring these crimes and works with law enforcement on the issue. marketwatch.com\n\nControversial Shooting Detection Technology\n\nActivists demand Chicago end ShotSpotter contract\n\nLocal activists staged a protest demanding that Chicago end its police contracts with the gunshot detection company ShotSpotter. The rally kicked off at the site where 13-year old Adam Toledo was killed earlier this year by police who were dispatched by a ShotSpotter alert.\n\nToledo's killing has brought new scrutiny onto the technology which is now being used by police departments in more than a hundred cities in the U.S.\n\n\"Seeing in the news that a ShotSpotter alert is what led to police to Adam's location was enough for us to be like 'this is the time, we need to make sure that this contract is not renewed,' \" Alyx Goodwin of the Action Center on Race and the Economy told The Hill in an interview before the protest.\n\nThe company uses a series of microphones and sensors placed around cities to detect sounds, analyze them and alert police if they are thought to be gunshots in less than a minute.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department (CPD) is ShotSpotter's largest customer, having signed a three-year contract worth $33 million in August 2018. The sensors are now deployed over 117 square miles of the city, spanning the 12 police districts with the highest proportion of Black and Latino residents.\n\nThat deal expires Aug. 19, and activists are pushing for it not to be renewed and for local officials to start demanding more evidence about technology before allowing CPD to purchase it.\n\nA spokesperson for CPD defended the technology as having \"detected hundreds of shootings that would have otherwise gone unreported.\" thehill.com\n\n1,000 Fatal Police Shootings Annually\n\nPolice shootings continue daily, despite pandemic, protests & pushes for reform\n\nThe Washington Post began tracking fatal shootings by on-duty police officers in 2015, the year after a White officer in Ferguson, Mo., shot and killed a Black 18-year old. Over the past six years, officers have fatally shot more than 6,400 people, an average of nearly a thousand a year, or almost three each day. The yearly toll even reached a new high of 1,021 fatal shootings in 2020. Midway through this year, fatal police shootings are down compared with the same period last year. They have fluctuated month to month since the project began, ending near 1,000 annually.\n\nSince Ferguson, departments across the country have taken steps toward reform, but these efforts have been inconsistent and incomplete. Most police departments still do not use body cameras. Experts in law enforcement and criminal justice say there have not been the large-scale policy or legal shifts that might reduce uses of force. And sending mental health teams in response to people in crisis, alongside or instead of armed officers, remains the exception.\n\nThe fatal shootings range from what experts describe as the unavoidable - including officers coming under gunfire - to a handful that prosecutors consider criminal. Most of those killed have been armed. Nearly every shooting has been ruled justified. But observers and experts contend many could have been averted with less-aggressive tactics.\n\nAmerican policing is not set up for across-the-board shifts, experts said, given that there are more than 15,000 local police and sheriff's departments, each with its own policies, practices and training.\n\nEfforts to change policing are also complicated by the politics of reform, with those on the left blaming overly aggressive policing and systemic racism, and those on the right arguing that unjustified police shootings are rare and not motivated by bias. washingtonpost.com\n\nPolice Reform Laws Contributing to Crime Surge?\n\nNew restrictions on Washington state police may lead to spike in crime\n\nCritics of new Dem-backed police reform bills say they're poorly written, putting cops and communities at risk\n\nAs the most sweeping police reform in the nation takes effect in Washington state over a year after the death of George Floyd, law enforcement agencies outside of Seattle are arguing new restrictions set on officers when interacting with the public may further incentivize criminal activity.\n\nThe nearly a dozen bills, passed by a legislature controlled by Democrats and signed by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee in May, took effect on July 25 and cover virtually all aspects of policing, including the background checks officers undergo before they're hired; when they are authorized to use force and how they collect data about it; and the establishment of an entirely new state agency to review police use of deadly force.\n\nPerhaps the most concerning changes come under two new laws, H.B. 1310 and H.B. 1054, because they take away officers' ability to pursue criminals or prevent crimes from occurring, Lewis County Sheriff Robert Snaza told Fox News. Under the first new law, officers now must have probable cause, a higher threshold, instead of traditionally just reasonable suspicion, before they can use force.\n\nThat means, according to Snaza, if a property owner calls police to report a potential robbery taking place at their home, and deputies arrive but only witness individuals walking off the property, they no longer are able to use force to detain those individuals while they further investigate. And that's even if those people match the description of the suspect.\n\n\"We're are going to see a dramatic increase in criminal activity,\" Snaza said in a phone interview with Fox News. foxnews.com\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nTampa man sentenced for setting Champs store on fire during Floyd unrest\n\nA man who set fire to a Tampa Champs Sports store during unrest that followed protests over the death of George Floyd has been sentenced to five years in prison. Terrance Lee Hester surrendered to federal authorities in Oswego, New York, in July 2020. Video released by the Tampa Police Department last year identified Hester throwing a burning T-shirt into the store window the night of the riots. The DOJ said the building became fully engulfed in fire, resulting in an estimated $1.25 million in damages to the Champs store and other businesses in the plaza. wfla.com\n\nDenver police partnering with feds in crackdown on violent crime\n\nAs violent crimes surge, Californians' faith in gun control slips in new poll\n\nOp-Ed: Rising crime issues will make Democrats a lot less safe in 2022 elections\n\nLaw Enforcement\n\nCivil Unrest Health Impact & Gun Violence Prevention Partnership\n\nInteresting New Special Guidebook for Law Enforcement:\n\nNPF Releases New Guidebook, \"Staying Healthy in the Fray: The Impact of Crowd Management on Officers in the Context of Civil Unrest\"\n\nJuly 15, 2021-The National Police Foundation (NPF), in partnership with the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), is pleased to release Staying Healthy in the Fray: The Impact of Crowd Management on Officers in the Context of Civil Unrest.

Representatives of the founding organizations were on hand to speak to the devastating impact of firearms in the United States. The Partnership was organized by 10 national law enforcement leadership organizations that pledged to focus on effective strategies to address gun violence, calling its current level a \"crisis\" and unacceptable.\n\nAs of June 2021, several of the member organizations, including the IACP, PERF, and others, continue to publish statements and views on their own websites and/or continue to name gun violence as a top strategic priority, including NPF.\n\nSee the Partnership Report Here\n\nCOVID Update\n\n344M Vaccinations Given\n\nUS: 35.5M Cases - 628.4K Dead - 29.6M Recovered\n\nWorldwide: 197.5M Cases - 4.2M Dead - 178.6M Recovered\n\nFormer Senior Loss Prevention Executive\n\nKnow of any fallen LP exec?

Still, the delta variant is already affecting retailers in three fundamental ways.\n\n1. Masks\n\nThe CDC's renewed mask recommendation, which extends guidance from May to include vaccinated as well as unvaccinated people, brings back a thorny issue for stores and retail workers. The NRF made clear that retailers are on board, however, noting that taking the steps recommended by health officials is how to keep businesses running, and running safely.\n\n2. Consumer confidence and the economy\n\nIn a press conference the day after the CDC released its new guidance, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that, thanks to vaccines and the adjustments companies have made in order to persevere, a variant or surge wouldn't likely hurt the economy the way the pandemic did last year. But, he said, it could slow the economy down.\n\n3. Supply chain\n\nRetailers have hastened to accommodate not just the pandemic's hit to demand, but also the upheaval in manufacturing and shipping that scrambled their inventory.\n\nSupply bottlenecks and shortages have also led to inflation, which Wells Fargo economists warned on Wednesday could lead to bigger problems for consumer spending and the wider economy. Should issues continue, inflation could persist, they said. retaildive.com\n\nBusinesses Revisit COVID Protocols as Delta Variant Surges\n\nHere's how companies are responding to the rise in coronavirus cases\n\nLyft said on Wednesday that it would not require employees to return to the office until February, while Twitter said it would close its newly reopened offices in San Francisco and New York and indefinitely postpone other reopening plans.\n\nApple will start requiring employees and customers to wear masks regardless of their vaccination status in more than half of its stores in the United States, it said on Wednesday, a new sign that shopping in the country may soon resemble earlier days of the pandemic.\n\nGoogle will require employees who return to the company's offices to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. It also said it would push back its official return-to-office date to mid-October from September. Google has more than 144,000 employees globally.\n\nNetflix will require the casts of all its U.S. productions to be vaccinated, along with anyone else who comes on set. It's the first studio to establish such a policy.\n\nFacebook will require employees who work at its U.S. campuses to be vaccinated, depending on local conditions and regulations. Facebook, which has roughly 60,000 workers, said in June that it would permit all full-time employees to continue to work from home when feasible.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company said Wednesday that it would require cast members and guests older than 2 to wear face coverings in all indoor locations at its Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort, effective July 30.\n\nCitigroup is reinstating mask requirements in common areas for employees across its U.S. offices, a person familiar with the situation said. nytimes.com\n\nThe Mask War Returns with a Vengeance\n\nDelta Variant Rekindles Face-Mask Fights\n\nNew face-mask mandates driven by a rise in Covid-19 cases from the Delta variant and new federal guidance is sparking renewed tensions in some communities, with some elected officials and residents pushing back on the directives.\n\nIn Missouri, the St. Louis County Council voted Tuesday to overturn a new mandate requiring face masks in public indoor spaces. The mandate, which had been issued by the county's executive and took effect Monday, was opposed by a vote of 5-2, with two Democratic members joining Republicans in opposition.\n\nHowever, County Executive Sam Page insisted Wednesday that his order remained in effect despite the vote, pending a separate legal challenge brought by the Missouri Attorney General.\n\nThe fight in St. Louis County revives a familiar debate over masking that now appears to be brewing elsewhere in the country. On the other side of Missouri, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas announced a mask order for public indoor spaces Tuesday for that city, and a city alderman has proposed trying to overturn the measure.\n\nThe CDC said in guidance this week that people, including those who have been vaccinated, should once again wear masks indoors in areas with high or substantial transmission of the virus.\n\nThe move was a shift from the agency's May guidance that vaccinated people no longer needed to mask or social distance in most settings. The CDC also recommended this week that everyone in K-12 schools wear masks, regardless of vaccination status. wsj.com\n\n$100 Payments for Newly Vaccinated Americans?\n\nBiden Lays Out Vaccine & Mask Requirements - Plus New Incentives\n\nPresident called on state, local governments to make $100 payments to newly vaccinated Americans\n\nPresident Biden said federal employees and on-site contractors must get vaccinated against Covid-19 or wear a mask on the job and submit to regular testing, and he called on state and local governments to make $100 payments to newly vaccinated Americans.\n\nMr. Biden also said in a speech Thursday that he is directing the Defense Department to examine how and when Covid-19 shots could be added to the list of vaccinations required for members of the U.S. military.\n\nMr. Biden also called for the $100 payments, which states can opt to provide \"as an extra incentive to boost vaccination rates, protect communities and save lives,\" the Treasury Department said. They can be funded by tapping a $350 billion pot of money for state and local governments that was included in the stimulus package passed earlier this year. wsj.com\n\nDelta Hot Zones Urge Residents to Get Vaccinated\n\nSouthern States Urge Covid-19 Vaccines as the Delta Variant Surges\n\nArkansas works with churches, businesses and historically Black fraternities and sororities to boost shots; Alabama is a cautionary tale.\n\nArkansas and other Southern states have emerged as crucial battlegrounds in efforts by state and local officials to persuade enough unvaccinated Americans to get Covid-19 shots to arrest a national surge in coronavirus infections. Arkansas now has the second-highest rate of new daily Covid-19 cases in the country, after Louisiana.\n\nThe highly contagious Delta variant that dominates the surge has been especially devastating to states in the South and Midwest, including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Missouri, as well as Arkansas. All of those states except Florida have full vaccination rates well below the national average of 58% of eligible people. wsj.com\n\nCovid-19 business rates holiday has come to an end\n\nBRC-LDC: 1 in 5 Shopping Center Stores Sit Empty\n\nUK Shop vacancies 'at highest rate ever recorded' as uncertainty lingers\n\nShopping centres the hardest hit this quarter with a 19.4% vacancy rate, according to BRC-LDC Vacancy Monitor\n\nThis is followed by high streets with a vacancy rate of 14.5% and retail parks at 11.5%\n\nOverall vacancy rates are 14.5% in Britain, up from 14.1% in the first quarter of the year\n\nThe number of empty shops in high streets, retail parks and shopping centres has increased in the past three months, according to new data.

Koch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe department said that the four Pilgrim's Pride executives indicted were Jason McGuire, a former executive vice president of sales, and Timothy Stiller, a former general manager, former sales executives Wesley Tucker and sales executive Justin Gay.\n\nPilgrim's Pride said in an email that none of the four work for the company currently but declined to say when Gay left. Lawyers for the four either did not respond to a request for comment or declined comment.\n\nPilgrim's Pride itself pleaded guilty in February and was sentenced to pay a $107.9 million fine to settle federal charges it conspired to fix chicken prices and passed on the costs to consumers and other purchasers. nypost.com\n\nHere's the Daily's full coverage of the case:\n\nApril 9, 2021: McDonald's to pursue damages from Tyson & Pilgrim's Pride in price-fixing scandal\n\nFebruary 24, 2021: One of the Nation's Largest Chicken Producers Pleads Guilty to Price Fixing and is Sentenced to a $107 Million Criminal Fine\n\nDecember 8, 2020: Target joins other retailers, grocers in accusing chicken suppliers of price fixing\n\nDecember 7, 2020: Chick-fil-A sues chicken suppliers over alleged price-fixing scheme June 8, 2020: Four Sr. Execs - Including Pilgrim's Pride CEO - Indicted on Antitrust Charges\n\nJanuary 31, 2018: Food Distributors Sue Tyson, Pilgrim's Pride, and Others Alleging Collusion\n\nHiring Discrimination Audit\n\nWho Discriminates in Hiring? A New Study Can Tell.\n\nApplications seemingly from Black candidates got fewer replies than those evidently from white candidates. The method could point to specific companies.\n\nTwenty years ago, Kalisha White performed an experiment. A Marquette University graduate who is Black, she suspected that her application for a job as executive team leader at a Target in Wisconsin was being ignored because of her race. So she sent in another one, with a name (Sarah Brucker) more likely to make the candidate appear white.\n\nThough the fake rÃ©sumÃ© was not quite as accomplished as Ms. White's, the alter ego scored an interview. Target ultimately paid over half a million dollars to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of Ms. White and a handful of other Black job applicants.\n\nEconomists at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago this week unveiled a vast discrimination audit of some of the largest U.S. companies. Starting in late 2019, they sent 83,000 fake job applications for entry-level positions at 108 companies - most of them in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 list, and some of their subsidiaries.\n\nWhat the researchers found would probably not surprise Ms. White: On average, applications from candidates with a \"Black name\" get fewer callbacks than similar applications bearing a \"white name.\"\n\nThis aligns with a paper published by two economists from the University of Chicago a couple of years after Ms. White's tussle with Target: Respondents to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago had much better luck if their name was Emily or Greg than if it was Lakisha or Jamal. (Marianne Bertrand, one of the authors, testified as an expert witness in the trial over Ms. White's discrimination claim.)\n\nThis experimental approach with paired applications, some economists argue, offers a closer representation of racial discrimination in the work force than studies that seek to relate employment and wage gaps to other characteristics - such as educational attainment and skill - and treat discrimination as a residual, or what's left after other differences are accounted for. nytimes.com\n\nHiring People with Criminal Records\n\nGrowing Number of US Workers Support Hiring People with Criminal Records\n\nBaby Boomers retiring at unprecedented rates and the Great Resignation of other workers-including many in health care and high-tech positions-are adding to hiring headaches for employers looking for qualified candidates to fill jobs.\n\nOne talent pool that is often overlooked: people with criminal records.\n\nRecent research from the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) and the SHRM Foundation found that people in the U.S. embrace the idea of second chances and would be proud to work for an employer-and would patronize a business-that hires people who have a criminal record or who have been incarcerated.\n\nAmong the findings of the survey conducted with 1,102 workers in April 2021:\n\n\"Nearly 700,000 people are released from prison each year, but too often they are denied the opportunity to put their skills to work due to deeply rooted biases and harmful misperceptions,\" said Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., SHRM-SCP, SHRM president and chief executive officer, in commentary that appeared on LinkedIn.\n\n\"Organizations that are unwilling to hire the formerly incarcerated are missing out on a variety of benefits,\" Taylor said, including an inclusive and diverse workforce, stronger communities, and a chance to demonstrate that they're good corporate citizens. shrm.org\n\nEx-Staples chief Sandy Douglas to become new UNFI CEO\n\nJ.
