Because each allocated population's resilience against infection is diverse, detailed sociological and medical research of any (not only COVID-19) pandemic and epidemic must be conducted globally, to identify weaknesses and insidious aspects of the infection. Finding the mechanism of resistance in one population may dictate how we can strengthen resistance in general population. Let's start with COVID-19, the pandemic we have. 2\n\n3. Table of Contents • Abstract • Introduction • Pandemic 2020/2021 chili season.

Abstract • Due to the new circumstances, a new Anti-Pandemic Preparedness Plan should be developed at the national level and be implemented at the population level: • Organized actions by the states political leadership to address the oxidative stress of the population, will lead to a drastic reduction in CFR, reduction in severe morbidity, and consequently a reduction in the harmful effects of the pandemic • We presenting a proposal to the scientific community, hoping to find a collaboration to approve the research and make it credible worldwide. • We offer 11 additional study designs on the harmful effects of permanent oxidative stress • Validation of the main hypotheses of this research will give the opportunity to improve the health of the population with high lethality diseases (COVID-19, respiratory and colorectal cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity). 5\n\n6. Introduction All epidemic and pandemic agent (virus or bacteria) penetrates in organism from environment through respiratory or gastro-intestinal Epithelium. Different populations have a different level of epithelium-endothelium resistance, mainly due to the ecological environment people are living, and social-traditional disparities in common food rations. We hypothesize that Population disparities in resistance of 2 anti-infection physiological barriers, epithelium of respiratory system and endothelium of vasculature, lead to polymorphism and varying severity of COVID-19 disease worldwide. 6\n\n7. Key questions and possible answers to investigate Probable suspects and their antidotes • Could be continuous Oxidative Stress induced by: -Living in polluted air, polluted especially with ROS/peroxides/free radicals/NO, NO2, NO3, N2O5, O3, -Eating habit with ration, rich with free radicals (processed food) be the reason for weakening human resistance against pandemic infection (1),(2)? • Could natural antidotes of ROS, antioxidants receiving as regular food be the secret of relative success of low GDP countries against COVID19 pandemic? We posed these questions in research hypotheses 7\n\n8. Pandemic 2020/2021. For orientation in time Current time- early autumn 2020 8\n\n9. For orientation in time and space • ROS, oxidants, per-oxidants, free radicals are fire burns • Antioxidants are water, it extinguishes fire • Oxygen is essential for life, but it should not burn. Water is needed to extinguish the fire, but we do not want to extinguish the fire, but to tame it (oxygenation, oxidation-reduction). • Nature and physiology have developed mechanisms for maintaining oxidation-antioxidant balance (endogenous antioxidants and eating healthy, natural products) for millions of years. • industrialization and urbanization began 1 century ago and is constantly increasing the bombardment of the human environment with fire, free radicals (polluted air and processed food) which cause a massive deviation of the oxidation-antioxidant balance of populations in favor of oxidation, combustion, denaturation, mutation-malignancy. • The result of industrialization is a steady increase in cardiovascular, respiratory, oncological, endocrine diseases. • In parallel with the increase in environmental pollution, the consumption of medicines by the population has increased geometrically 9\n\n10. For orientation in time and space • Science, medicine, public environmental organizations, and international politics (national and international conventions, regulations) try to reduce the intense and increasingly harmful oxidation caused by industry, but despite their efforts, the environment is increasingly polluted by industrial ROS. • The oxidation-antioxidant balance of mankind varies to varying degrees, but globally it is in the direction of oxidation-combustion. • Successful examples of combating oxidative stress (Buddhist, Muslim, and Jewish countries) give us hope for new simple rules of social life: accommodation and route planning with ecological priorities in mind, and a diet rich in antioxidants, will allow us to adjust the global deviation in the direction from oxidation-combustion, regulate it, and return it to the allowable range. • Politicians all over the world, doctors, ecologists, economists, urbanists, architects, with the participation of labor legislators will have to change the legislation to make living space safer for people. 10\n\n11.

What is the price of comfort, wealth and industrialization? • after the2001 world pharmaceutical market quadrupled (1). • people have to spend on health 4 times more, than in 1992 (2). • Europe and the USA , the global share of population 9-10% are living in world 25% sulfur dioxide (by dry mass) air pollution areas (3). and.. If the main hypothesis of our research is approved • More oxidative stress and its aftermath (4): Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, oncology, higher morbidity, and more pandemic vulnerability/fatality. 12\n\n13. Pandemic virus is killing, but environment and food routine is changing death rate from 18.5 (lombardia.Italy),17,5(Belgium) to 1%(Bangladesh) and 0,23 (Nepal) 13\n\n14. Forecast for the next 7 months without taking into account the oxidation-antioxidant factor • During the cold season, air pollution will increase in parallel with the increase in energy consumption (heating), which will lead to damage to the respiratory epithelium and inhibition of Nitrogen Oxide endogenous production (1). • The cold season for the first time in a pandemic will be 4 months (as opposed to 2019-2020 1.5 months) • Comorbidities and co-infections will increase during the cold season • The immunity of the nasal epithelium will be suppressed • The initial potential spreader for the cold season on Earth will be 15 million in November (as opposed to 1 spreader in December 2019) • likely the 2020-2021 cold season will be several times worse than the previous cold season. 14\n\n15. seasonal prevalence of virus (1). The seasonal virus abundance scheme dictates that we should expect an elevation of coronavirus cases in the spring. This will be especially dangerous due to the seasonal depletion of antioxidants in common food. 15\n\n16. An increase in the share of children among infected (from 1 to 8% of cases) is a one of prerequisite for the further spread of the infection in general population. 16\n\n17. Forecast for the next 7 months in the anti-pandemic preparation plan taking into account the oxidation-antioxidant factor Recommendation and support for the general population and especially the vulnerable group: Settle in a fresh air environment Eat foods rich in antioxidants in excess Significantly alter pandemic mortality, reduce the length of hospitalization and post hospital rehabilitation/convalescence periods. 17\n\n18. We have questions, we have suspects, and we are starting to investigate causality and correlations. We started with thanks. Mankind has done long-term highly intellectual work and has spent billions of dollars to enable us, just eager internet users, to uncover the most important facts, which we would then analyze according to our research design. Thanks to Internet resources and international research, scientific, medical, and space research organizations for obtaining information and placing this information on the Internet for free use! . 18\n\n19. We need more questions and more answers to understand SARS-Coc-2 virus and understand what is the relative strength of low GDP countries against pandemic, to evaluate future changes in Global Antipandemic Preparedness Plan 19\n\n20. To begin, we collect the COVID-19 pandemic surprises and questions that have yet to be answered: 20\n\n21. Yet unexplained, unexpected epidemiological characteristics of SARS-Cov-2 infection • Mortality statistics vary significantly according to the geographical accommodation of the population • The resistance of the female population is 45% higher than that of the male population • Case Fatality Rate (CFR) margins vary very wide by countries and by populations of same countries • Rich, high GDP countries are most affected • Infection vulnerability in the population increases exponentially with increasing age of patients, infected children are almost magically protected • Epidemiologists are using the term \"excess death“(1) (2)to refer to the phenomenon of unexpected high deaths • Statistics suggest that there are also separate populations that have the disease with minimal mortality -“spare death”, or the easy course of the disease, partly even without a complaint (3). Covid-19 - a puzzle with many missing pieces (1) 21\n\n22. Yet unexplained empirical observations during pandemic -Population groups that significantly differ in social life, ecological cleanliness of the environment, food ration, they are also significantly different in the degree of COVID- 19 pandemic-induced mortality - Low social life in rich industrial/urbanized countries is bound with food antioxidant deficiency more, than in pure countries.(1). - Vitamins and minerals, that are accepted in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment: Vit C, Vit A, Vit E, Zn are Antioxidants. - N-acetilcysteine-(2) is also reported as effective against prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. N-acetilcystein is Glutathione (antioxidant) producer. - Ivermectin, another drug, antihelmintic, claimed as effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, raises Nitrogen Oxide levels in the blood (3) - Feritine and BNP (4) , laboratory findings, that correlates with COVID-19 severity, both are in directly proportional to the oxidative stress.(5). 22\n\n23. Yet unexplained, empirical observations during pandemic - Recognized as effective- proning of patient in bed (2) is pulmonary ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) balance changing, supported by gravity maneuver. - Summer, when CFR from pandemic dropped, is not only time of raised nasal- respiratory immunity and less comorbid infections, but also a time to live in less polluted air environment. - Woman's and Youngsters resistance against COVID-19 pandemic is much higher. Woman’s life expectancy is 3,5 year longer, than of man, what gives to woman and children this advantage? - Gilbert’s decease is prolonging life expectancy above average. In this disease, bilirubin, an endogenous antioxidant, accumulates in the body above normal quantity. Can we find one answer from physiology for all listed unexpectancies? 23\n\n24. • African American and Hispanic American mortality rate 4 times higher compared to rest of the US population (population living predominantly in more polluted areas and receiving more processed (1), low antioxidant food) . • Younger are stronger • Rural population is stronger • Antioxidant rich diet countries population are stronger • Antioxidant rich vegetarian countries population are stronger • Woman are stronger Can it be explained with oxidation-antioxidation prevalence in populations? Unexplained and unexpected pandemic Differences in COVID19 Mortality rates among different countries and ethnicities 24\n\n25. Is Estrogen protecting women and pregnant patients against COVID-19? Male death share ---61,8% Female death share- 38,2% • In US, CFR of pregnant patients is 0.2% (1) • pregnant have 2,10,20,70 times high Estrogen level, than non pregnant (2) • In US, in fertility age group CFR is 0.32% (3) • “The cardiovascular protective actions of estrogen are partially mediated by a direct effect on the vessel wall. Estrogen is active both on vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells where functionally competent estrogen receptors have been identified. Estrogen administration promotes vasodilation in humans and in experimental animals, in part by stimulating prostacyclin and nitric oxide synthesis, as well as by decreasing the production of vasoconstrictor agents such as cyclooxygenase-derived products, reactive oxygen species, angiotensin II, and endothelin-1”. Effects of estrogen on the vascular system R.C. Tostes, D. Nigro, Z.B. Fortes and M.H.C. Carvalho Estrogen, as vasodilator and Nitrogen Oxide production stimulant agent, gives to women ability deal with V/Q mismatch more effective, than man. (4), (5). 25\n\n26. • after 1-2 month in lockdown physicians in the Western Europe and North America announced that the “virus was weakened” (e.g. In the USA, mortality rate dropped from 9.5% to 5% , in UK from 6-1,5% ) (1). But what if, the virus is the same virulence and morbidity, but populations resistance against pandemic rose due to regeneration of lung epithelium during lockdown clear air period, and thus make population more resilient? Unexplained and unexpected pandemic The global tendency, Local mortality is significantly reduced/halved after 1 month of Lockdown 26\n\n27. research • Sociology, Demography, and epidemiology of COVID-19 pandemic • Physiology of COVID-19 pandemic • Environmental science of COVID-19 pandemic • Nutritiology/ Ethno-culinary, of COVID-19 pandemic • Physiology of Oxidative Stress and Antioxidation • Critical care Medicine of COVID-19 pandemic • Pharmacology, of COVID-19 pandemic • Public health. of COVID-19 pandemic 27\n\n28.

So here and after, the statistics are summarized through July 9th. 35\n\n36. Surprises accompanying a COVID-19 pandemic • The group of countries with high GDP represents just 9.1% of the world population, but pandemic mortality in this group represents 60% of the global pandemic mortality. 36\n\n37.

By expenditures on health care, they must be in the bottom of graph, near the Japan, but we see, that more of them are much higher in death rate compared to low GDP countries 39\n\n40. Health care expenditures per capita. Most successful countries with death rate lover than 2-3%, are not in this chart, they spend much less money on health of citizens. 40\n\n41. Despite prognosis, 10 poorest countries (by GDP) : Siera Leone, South Sudan, Liberia, Mozambique, Malawi, Niger, Eritrea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Burundi: average Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is only 2.4% (1). 41\n\n42. For some reason, the high mortality map is more in line with the high diabetes map than with map with countries less prepared for the pandemic. Americas and south Europa are among most affected with COVID-19, Central Africa and East-West Asia has unexpected low COVID-19 death rate. 42\n\n43. In the framework of the research, we have identified the grouping of socio- ethnic-economic populations and the correlation of the reasons for the difference in resistance between them. Population Groups to be observed -Group of rich countries with high cost per capita cost of health care (e.g. praise of ICU bed exceeds $ 2000) with high infection rate - predominantly agrarian/rural countries with highest infection rate - Traditional food priority countries (Muslim, Buddhist, Israel) - Individual Cultural/social Groups in Countries (1). -Citizens of Institutional Accommodation (Nursing Homes, Prisons, Barracks, Refugee Camps) - Minority groups with a religiously determined diet (Buddhists, Muslims in Europe and America) - Populations Living in Different Environmental Emissions with the Same Social Environment - Residential Retirement Homes -Groups by age -Gender Groups 43\n\n44. We count case fatality rate (CFR) in different groups For comparison: COVID19 pandemic global mortality 5%. -High GDP countries - 9.4% -world, excluding rich countries (excluding high GDP, countries)- 4% -Group of countries where most infected: USA, Brazil, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, Peru, Chile, Italy, Mexico, France, Canada, Colombia, Sweden, Belgium Mortality - 8.4% -predominantly agrarian/rural Countries most Infected: Peru, Chile, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Colombia, Argentina, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iraq Mortality 3% -Countries with culturally determined antioxidant-rich food ration (e.g. Muslim countries and Israel)- 1,5-2% -High share of vegetarian population countries (1) (2)(Buddhist) -0-0,05%. 44\n\n45. Environmental science and COVID- 19 pandemic 45\n\n47. • The body has the most intense and close contact with the environment through the lungs • We breathe 8-20 kilograms of air during the day • The pulmonary epithelium (mucosa) is vulnerable and easily oxidized • The damage will be intensified if free radicals are not neutralized by the body. • Natural antidotes against excess oxidation process are antioxidants Interaction between Respiratory system and environment 47\n\n48. • NASA, Giovanny, ESA, Eumetsat, Copernicus and their free internet sources allows us to have the latest (up to yesterday) detailed information about the ecological condition of the entire Earth's atmosphere-stratosphere • Each satellite orbits the earth for 1.5 hours and traverses about 16 orbital trajectories per day. In one orbit, it will study about 400-600 kilometer-wide strep. 48\n\n49. Western Europe and North America (9% of the world population) consume 27% from global energy consumption, thus receiving 3 times more energy than average citizens from the rest of the world per capita (1). ICAO admits Europe share 26,3% and North America 22.4 % of global The World of Air Traffic in 2018. 49% of flights located where 9% population is living (2). Thus average European-North Americans receiving 5 times more smog from planes in the air and in the airports. 49\n\n50.

Italy Air pollution with NO2: lombardya- 17,3%, Italy without Lombardia -11,8% (19.08.20) 58\n\n59. We found obvious geographical correlation between mortality rate and Nitrogen Oxides/Free radicals/ROS pollution of the air But why are rich countries failing to clean their air of Nitrogen Oxides/ROS ? Atmospheric air consists of 78% nitrogen N2, and 21% oxygen O2 • Environmental regulations cannot override physics (1) . The regulations will avoid heavy metals, phenols, reduce dust, but not NOx and O3.. • Any combustion causes a small amount of atomic oxygen and atomic nitrogen to combine end product is NO2/NOx group 59\n\n60. Another air pollution agents hypothetical roles • Although we have considered nitrogen oxides and other peroxides / free radicals to be a major cause of damage to the respiratory epithelium, other air pollutants(1) can also be significant participants in lung epithelium damaging: dust PM2,5, PM10 (2), phenols, methane, heavy metals. • NOx can be part of PM2,5 and PM10 60\n\n61. Free radicals, Oxidative stress,ROS and their antidote - Antioxidant 61\n\n62. Air pollutant Oxides • N2O, NO, NO2, NO3, O3, SO2 - unstable molecules, decompose in the interval of 10 -180 minutes and take the form of more stable N2 and O2. • Good news. Since all nitrogen oxides are unstable and volatile the environment is automatically purged of nitrogen oxides unless new air-polluting molecules are added. 62\n\n63. Free Radicals , ROS The oxygen unpaired atom, i.e. O and not O2 is a free radical that exhibits a high oxidation-combustion ability of the encountering matter. Its binding with organic matter and other atoms or molecules easily results in connection-oxidation (1). 63\n\n64. Oxidative stress Oxidation-burning caused by free radicals damages various cell structures, membranes, DNA, causes cell lysis, mutations/cancer, aging of cells, and tissues (1). Oxidative stress may be the triggering circumstance for severe forms of the COVID-19 disease(1). 64\n\n65. apopthosis – free radicals physiological mission ROS and RNS are necessary to maintain homeostasis (1). Antioxidants scavenge FR in order to regulate their physiological level. Depletion of ROS by antioxidants suppresses apoptosis 65\n\n66. Antioxidants • Antioxidants are molecules which can safely interact with free radicals and terminate the chain reaction before vital molecules are damaged (1). • Free radicals lose their reactivity when they bind with antioxidant • Main quantity of antioxidants organism is receiving by eating antioxidant food . 66\n\n67. The physiological balance between free radicals and antioxidants • In the kit of vital necessities, which includes: water, oxygen, carbohydrates and the Krebs cycle, there should also be “fire extinguishers” - antioxidants. • Some of the antioxidants are produced by humans endogenously, but most of them are obtained from the environment through food. Oxidation-antioxidation balance is evolutionary compensative mechanism and is ready to reduce phisiologycal/rural Reactive Oxygen Species oxidation, but oxidation during industrialization/urbanysation is much more higher (1). Thus all population of Earth, is under some, more or less level of Oxidative Stress. 67\n\n68. Diseases and oxidation-antioxidation balance • living in polluted air environment increases respiratory disease morbidity and fatality (1). • oxidation stress increases diabetes, obesity, cardio-vascular and respiratory diseases in population (2),(3). • receiving antioxidants as food / antioxidant vitamins raises population resistance against airway obstructive and respiratory viral disease(4), (5),(6). 68\n\n69. Endogenous antioxidants • All tree endogenous antioxidants: Estrogens, Melatonin and Bilirubin are important oxidative stress preventers-reducers and are showing significant increasing body resistance • Melatonin and Estrogens showing 20-50% reducing COVID-19 mortality - gender disparity (1), (2). Thus, if antioxidants are cure, the oxidation stress is the enemy. 69\n\n70. Non-enzymatic Endogenous antioxidants • non-enzymatic antioxidants: metal binding proteins (MBPs METALLOTHIONEIN), glutathione (GSH), uric acid (UA), melatonin (MEL), bilirubin (BIL) and polyamines (PAs). • enzymatic antioxidants: Superoxide dismutase, Glutathione peroxidase, Glutathione reductase and catalase (1). 70\n\n71. We hypothesize that the advantage of women is due to the excess of endogenously produced antioxidants: Estrogens, and Melatonin 71\n\n72. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 world developed countrees Rural countries countries with antioxidant-rich diet vegetarian countries Mortality percentage- CFR in food groups and air pollution groups 72\n\n73. lets consider, what is common in those 2 successful against COVID-19 groups of people • 1 group: success connected to geographical area and ethnographic culinary characteristics • 2 group: success is not connected with geographical area and is connected to gender and age. organisms of both groups have more antioxidants (from food or endogenous), thus have more healthy epithelium and endothelium. Healthy Epithelium and Endothelium are more resilient as defense barrier and more productive as source of output of Nitrogen Oxide (NO). 73\n\n74. Indirect indications of importance of Oxidation-anti-oxidation balance for health -The location of the first impact of inhaled free radicals is the nasopharynx, which is at the same time the immunity first barrier against airborne pathogens (1)So, free radicals weaken the human immune response to all respiratory pathogens -Malaysia, a country where the harmful illegal practice of burning palm plantations is widespread, has COVID-19 deaths rate (CFR) 3 times higher than its neighbors. -The air is polluted by the volcano Kilauea emissions. The COVID-19 death rate among Pacific Islands is higher in Hawaii (2) -The profession of the welder is accompanied by damage to the airways with nitrogen oxides. People in this profession are at increased risk (3) for the respiratory system and oncological pathologies. 74\n\n75. One more endogenous antioxidant to prove – antioxidants are important source of resistance • Bilirubin is an endogenous antioxidant. Gilbert's syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by the accumulation of excess bilirubin in the body. Gilbert's syndrome is a disease that prolongs life. (4) Explanation- antioxidants minimize the chance of oxidative stress, as a result of which the capillary spasm in the blood vessels of the heart and lungs is leveled, reducing the tissue manifestations of aging and an increase in life expectancy is observed. 75\n\n76. SARS-CoV-2 infection pathological physiology hypothesis 76\n\n77. Hypothetical scheme of the COVID-19 disease. First barrier (1), respiratory ciliated epithelial cells are regenerating very fast - 3-10 days. in asymptomatic PCR positive individuals SARS-CoV-2 colony can be grown in ciliated epithelial cells while basal epithelial cells can still resist spreading the virus further in the organism. 77\n\n78. • The first protective barrier, respiratory epithelial-mucosa resists infection with the immunoglobulin A (IgA)(1), which is produced by it. Antioxidants increase the ability to produce IgA, thus antioxidants enhance the protective function of respiratory (1) and intestinal (2) epithelium. • The SARS-CoV-2 virus survives on the skin 4,5 more time, as the Influenza virus, (9,5 hours against 2 hours) (3). thus we can assume, that the battle among virus and defense membranes (epithelium and endothelium) is lasting much longer as among influenza viruses and membranes. Thus, the variability in the strength of epithelium and endothelium can cause wide differences in disease forms and severity. 78\n\n79. Hypothetical scheme of the COVID-19 disease. First barrier - Gastro Intestine (GI) epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 colony can be grown in ciliated epithelial cells while basal epithelial cells can still resist spreading the virus further in the organism. In big part of infected children (1), and adults also, disease is started with GI complications and finished only with mild GI complications, and in most of cases diagnosis could not proved by nasal PCR. Thus in that cases virus colony could not pass through GI epithelium. 79\n\n80. Hypothetical scheme of the COVID-19 disease SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the endothelium of the heart (1) and damages cardiomyocytes and myofibrils (right picture). But do not touching endothelium cells. We hypothesize, that if endothelium (second barrier) is weakened before infection, virus can penetrate it and Inflict damage to organ inner tissues (severe myocarditis, severe pneumonia etc.). 80\n\n81. Quality of epithelium and endothelium barrier function is the main determining factor of COVID-19 illness severity and forme. endothelium weakening with oxidative stress from physical exercises, leads to higher mortality in healthy, strong, intensively exercised young people (1), (2), (3),(4),mostly by involving the heart muscle. 81\n\n82. • Besides the function of being a defensive barrier, the epithelium and endothelium have one more very important function, which also determines, can the patient be able to survive the infection or not – its Nitrogen Oxide endogenous production. 82\n\n83. ACE-2 gates for SARS-CoV-2 virus in cell, also main inducer of release of Nitric Oxide from endothelial cells Viruses enter the endothelial and epithelial cells via the ACE-2 enzyme located on the membrane. This process is accompanied by the passage of ACE-2 and switching to cell contents. ACE-2 enzyme promotes NO production in endothelium and epithelium (1),(2). Consequently, the endothelium of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients can no longer produce the appropriate amount of Nitric Oxide. Our hypothesis is that nutritional antioxidants can maintain more well-functioning ACE-2 enzymes on the surface of epithelium and endothelium cells and therefore increase nitric oxide production when the body needs it. 83\n\n84. We hypothesize • Vicious circle, which is killing patients – V/Q mismatch (ventilation perfusion mismatch) (1) could be stopped with endogenously produced NO and compensative mechanisms could return critical patient to life. • As we know, elderly people and people with damaged lung epithelium can’t produce endogenous Nitrogen Oxide In sufficient quantities, thus they are most vulnerable. 84\n\n85. The epithelium, damaged with environmental oxidation, has difficulty performing the listed barrier function and endoproduction of Nitrogen Oxide, during the course of the disease, due to the pathophysiological feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, aditional ROS / free radicals are endogenously produced in Neutrophils which worsens the severity of the disease(1) . As a result, if a population living in an ecological environment and nutritional ration pre-exposed to oxidative stress, the patient from this population becomes a victim of two oxidative stress summaries. 85\n\n86. Research next main question – How exactly damaged epithelium causes death with SARS-Cov-2 infected patients Hypothetical epidemiological scheme of the COVID-19 disease. • All infection is reaching the host organism, if not by skin, by going through respiratory or gastrointestinal system epithelium (1) (first barrier) • after reaching the blood jet, infectious agents reaching organs and tissues by going through the endothelium of vessels (second barrier) • those two barriers are the determinants of how the infection will affect the host organism. • We hypothesize that in 70-80% of SARS-CoV-2 infected people the virus does not penetrate the nasopharyngeal epithelium (virus colony in naso-pharinx, without clinical manifestations), in 20-30% it penetrates the respiratory epithelium (disease without severe pneumonia), and from them, only in half, in -10-15% cases, the virus penetrates and invades the vascular endothelium of the respiratory system and penetrates In tissues (severe pneumonia), additionally in 1-3% it penetrates the endothelium of the heart and kidneys and other organs (severe COVID-19 illness with damage to the heart muscle, kidney, brain, liver tissue). Thus, the resistance of epithelium and endothelium (first and second barriers) and their population disparities leads to polymorphism of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic infection worldwide. 86\n\n87. Some facts from epidemiology of comorbidities and critical illness from COVID-19 disease. 87\n\n88. Let us recall H1N1 2009 death rate by age. The resistance of people older than 65 years is equal to the resistance of people aged 25-50 years, and the most vulnerable are patients aged 50-65 years 80% of the virus-related deaths were estimated to occur in those < 65 years of age. In seasonal influenza epidemics, about 70% to 90% of deaths occur in people ≥65. 88\n\n89. In COVID-19 The dynamics of the increase in mortality correlates with the age and dynamics of the decrease in the production of endogenous nitrogen oxides. 89\n\n90. Diabetes Mellitus occurs and worsens due to permanent, environmentally induced oxidative stress The likelihood of developing diabetes in the population increases with the presence of polluted air (1), (2) The vascular ( micro and macroangyopathy) complications of diabetes rate increase with the patient living in the polluted air environment(3), (4). 90\n\n91. Death from Covid 19 has a higher correlation with diabetes mellitus (1) than with chronic respiratory diseases. Diabetes mellitus hyperglycemia severity is correlating with oxidative stress (2) May be diabetes and air pollution with ROS are affecting patients anticoronavirus resistance by same way – Oxidative stress in both cases unable respiratory epithelium to produce Nitrogen Oxide? 91\n\n92. Example of generalization of the oxidation-antioxidant issue on Diabetes Mellitus Retinopathy The mechanisms by which diabetic micro-angiopathy develop yet are not known. We hypothesize that Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19 micro and macro angiopathy have the same reason – endothelial damage and NO deficiency due to oxidative stress. Diabetic retinopathy – (1) 92\n\n93. • Elevated Ferritin level, marker of illness future severity in patients, also correlates In direct proportion with oxidative stress (1). 93\n\n94. Nitrogen Oxide as endogenous important vasodilatator Use of Nitrogen Oxide inhalation in critically ill patients as treatment 94\n\n95. NO is Ubiquitous in the Body, Produced by Some Different Cell Types Nitrogen oxide is continually synthesized in the respiratory epithelium and is physiologically up-regulated in response to hypoxia, infection or inflammation. The best way to get to know NO is to understand - the pharmacological ability of Nitroglycerin, to dilate blood vessels, is mediated by the nitroglycerin metabolite – NO, and it has an immediate and strong effect. 95\n\n96. 96\n\n97. Increasing evidence COVID19 is (also) a vascular disease • Pulmonary vasoconstriction and resultant Ventilation Perfusion mismatch (1) • Cytokine storm • widespread vascular inflammation are a main damaging pathophysiologic event during COVID19 - (1),(2),(3) 97\n\n98. • Oxidation prevalence/oxidative stress leads to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension (1) in whole human vasculature thus, if patient have endothelium damaged by ROS, SARS-CoV-2 virus reaches inner tissues: lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, brain tissue and easily damages it. This explains the diversity of the disease 98\n\n99. Age related inability to produce Nitrogen Oxide 99\n\n100.

Clinical use of inhaled Nitric Oxide • iNO’s Efficacy for Hypoxia shown in many studies: • Nitric oxide (NO) is a major signaling and effector molecule mediating the body's response to hypoxia, given its unique characteristics of vasodilation (improving blood flow and oxygen supply). • iNO administration significantly improved arterial oxygenation and was effective in correcting hypoxia in patients with ARDS and after open heart surgery. 105\n\n106. Pulmonary Diseases Approved for NO Treatment • COPD-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease • Pulmonary hypertension • Severe Asthma • Cystic fibrosis • SARS CoV2 106\n\n107. • The main difficulties for the widespread introduction of inhaled nitrous oxide in treatment practice are: the cost of gaseous nitrogen oxide is high, the special equipment needed to deliver it to the patient • And the main difficulty - to use it requires a highly qualified physician, who must individually determine the moment, duration, and concentration of inhalation In contrast, Nitrogen Oxide is produced in the body, predominantly in the respiratory epithelium, as much as ischemia or inflammation is dictated and exactly when needed to reduce abnormal spasm. 107\n\n108. Defend respiratory epithelium and Save Lives • Respiratory epithelium and pulmonary vascular endothelium naturally possess defense mechanisms which is endogenous NO production to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection and infections in general • Permanent Lung damage with free radicals e.g. air pollution with NO2 and lack of antioxidants in diet plays major role in disease severity and outcomes in patients with COVID19. 108\n\n109. how to make epithelium and endothelium resilient against pandemic virus. Population level. • avoid oxidative stress by avoiding polluted with free radicals air and minimizing proceed food. • enriching organism with antioxidants (food, vitamins, minerals) • phisical defence of epithelium with medical masks. masks will save temperature and humidity in upper respiratory system and filter air from PM particles 109\n\n110. how to make epithelium and endothelium resilient against pandemic virus. Patient level. • enriching organism with antioxidants (food, vitamins, minerals) • save temperature and humidity in upper respiratory system and filter air from PM particles and from additional bacterial – viral infections • Colchicine can reduce pyroptosis in epithelium and endothelium (1). 110\n\n111. Drugs which could be investigated on matter of effectiveness against SARS-Cov-2 infection • Vit C, Vit E, as antioxidants • Colchicine as pyropthosis reducer • ACC as antioxidant • Ivermectin as NO producer • Dexamethasone as (1) anti inflamatory on epithelium (from first stage of illness, to all hospitalized patients) • Midocalm –as membranstabilizer and vascular spasm reducer 111\n\n112. Vaping, smoking cigarettes - exposing lungs to free radicals • cigarette smoking causes lung exposing to free radicals and thus, impairing epithelium function to produce endogenous NO • vaping exposing the lungs to free radicals and thus impairing epithelium function to produce endogenous NO • vaping free radicals are highly reactive (1), • vaping increases COVID-19 risks (2) 112\n\n113. hypothesis about addiction • cigarette smoking and vaping both causes addiction. Accepted opinion is that nicotine is making cigarette smoking and vaping addictive. • In addition to nicotine, both damage the respiratory epithelium, possibly by the deficiency of endogenous NO. • we know another chemical agent, which is causing addiction and are less connected to psychotropic action than nicotine – its nasal decongestant sprays. • we hypothesize, that cigarettes, vaping and nasal decongestants becoming addictive not only due to psychotropic agent - nicotine, but also as chronic damagers of endogenic NO production and causing temporary, recovery by giving to person little amount of inhaled NO, which is temporary removing spasm of lung vasculature, improving oxygenation and thus giving the sensation of salvation. 113\n\n114. Hypothesis about addiction quitting • If this hypothesis will be approved, it will change strategies of treating addiction. • if person decides quit smoking, vaping and using decongestant spray, first of all he have to restore respiratory mucosal function to rise production of endogenous NO Antioxidants may become essential part of quitting addiction from those harmful habits. 114\n\n115. Example of generalization of the oxidation-antioxidant issue on colorectal cancer • Colorectal cancer Is on raise among Afro-Americans yang population in US • Afro-Americans are eating more processed food/meat than white population • Reason of emerging colorectal cancer may be free radicals, which are in processed food (1). 115\n\n116. Respiratory burns – some similarities Importance of respiratory epithelium functions • Respiratory burns (1) the disease caused by exposure to hot air and smoke in the airways, is manifested even when airway burns or swelling are minimal. We can assume that hypothetically, respiratory complications are caused by microscopic damage to the respiratory epithelium, which has resulted in the epithelium losing its ability to produce Nitric Oxide. • In severe cases of Respiratory burns, when artificial ventilation is required, this method of treatment is much less effective than in other reasons for the need for artificial ventilation. Very large proportion of such patients die. • Severe respiratory burns are complicated by interstitial fibrosis, a condition that is also characteristic of coronavirus disease. • Respiratory burn is characterized by ARDS and RADS (Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome). • The late stage of respiratory burn disease can last for up to 2 weeks and years, and after 10 years can lead to bronchiectasis in the lung. We hypothesize that • Respiratory burn disease more severity than this should be from visual (with bronchoscopy) reasons (2) • Similarity of interstitial fibrosis (3) and bronchiectasis (4) to coronavirus infection gives us reason to think that these two diseases could be pathophysiologically similar and are caused by temporary or permanent loss of respiratory epithelial function – NO endoproduction. 116\n\n117. conclusions 117\n\n118. Conclusions: • Because all social groups whose living environment was characterized by excess free radicals (in the air and in food) tend to high mortality • And all groups whose environment is characterized by small amounts of free radicals and traditionally ingested plenty antioxidants show strong resistance to pandemics • Since we have a logical causality about the role of air pollution in the pathophysiology of the disease We have reached a causal conclusion: the resistance of the population to the COVID-19 pandemic depends on the form of oxidation- antioxidant balance and prevalence of this balance in the body. 118\n\n120. Can we change the resistance of the population against the COVID19? • Purification of air from free radicals within 2 weeks by regenerating the ability of the newly regenerated epithelium to produce nitric oxide protected patients from a deadly critical complication that halved mortality (hypothesis, backed by causality). • It is possible to increase their individual and population resistance to pandemics (hypothesis) by recommending the resettlement of the main population, especially the vulnerable population, in the fresh air, as well as by recommending enriching of their diet with antioxidants. • Examine the expediency of receiving antioxidants in the first 2 weeks of COVID19 treatment so that the patient at the peak of disease intensification , is ready to have a compensatory tool - NO. Since the ecological environment remains harmful, antioxidants can be used as an anti inflammatory and vascular auto-regulatory agents in the treatment and prevention of lung diseases of any etiology. 120\n\n121. Why is it necessary to continue the research? The maximum vulnerability of weak populations in the long life in air polluted by free radicals environment, the lack of edible antioxidants and the abundance of free radicals in food, the deficiency of endogenous antioxidant products The maximum resistance of resistant populations is combined with longer live in the fresh air environment from oxidants, an antioxidant-rich diet, less food free radicals, and more ability to produce endogenous antioxidants. Our hypothesis, which requires internationalization of research and extensive research collaboration, is as follows: -If the respiratory epithelium of the population is not damaged by oxidation and therefore retains its ability to produce nitric oxide, the population will cope with the most lethal mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection - V / Q mismatch which results in dramatic, pandemic-induced mortality. 121\n\n122. Can a pandemic become useful for medicine? • The COVID-19 pandemic magnifies the importance and causality of some compensatory mechanisms in critical pathophysiology. We see the destructive role of respiratory mucosal weakening and thus reduction of endogenous NO production. We also see the role of antioxidants in preventing respiratory epithelium damage in the new, industrialized world, which is forcing population in oxidative stress. It is the duty of medicine to re-evaluate the importance of oxidation-antioxidation In the pathogenesis of various diseases 122\n\n123. Saving and protecting respiratory/nasopharyngeal and facial sinuses can be the key to success against pandemics NO is physiologically endogenously produced in the respiratory tract, predominantly in the naso- pharynx and facial sinuses. Ability of endogenous production of NO will save the patient's life. People can activate NO endoproduction by eating antioxidants (1). 123\n\n124. More questions raised by the study • could antioxidants be able to prevent or treat diabetes, cardiovascular disease, oncology, connective tissue respiratory diseases, kidney disease, and acute respiratory infections including SARS-CoV-2? • could antioxidants become part of quitting addiction of cigarette smoking, vaping and over usage of nasal decongestant sprays? 124\n\n125. attempt to explain the unexpected development of COVID-19 pandemic • Mortality statistics vary significantly according to the geographical accommodation of the population -populations living on current locations differ from each other by modal Oxidation- Antioxidation balance status • The resistance of the female population is 45% higher than that of the male population - advantage of women is due to more endogenous antioxidants (Estrogens, Melatonin) than man. • Rich, high GDP countries are most affected - spending more money is associated with more energy consumption and more burn, thus more ROS in the air. High economic activity leads to high pollution with Peroxides. • Infection vulnerability increases exponentially with increasing age of patients - older population require more antioxidants to overcome oxidative stress. By age ability of producing endogenous Nitrogen Oxide is declined. Air pollution is worsening this process. 125\n\n126. attempt to explain the unexpected development of COVID-19 pandemic • African-American and Latin American mortality is 4 times higher than the rest of the population - mortality among world poorest 10 countries (all fro Africa) is 2,5, much less than mortality rate among American Afro-Americans and Hispanics. Thus vulnerability is associated not with genetic characteristics, but with social life: air pollution, processed food , higher intake of sugar, which is leading to oxidative stress • Statistics suggest that there are also separate populations that have the disease with minimal mortality, or at least a clinic, even without a complaint (spare death), for example in Buddhist countries (0.05%, asymptomatic population -0%). - populations with culturally determined high proportion of antioxidants in food and living in clear air environment are most resistant populations against COVID-19 pandemic • Proning maneuver . proning of patient in bed (2)is effective - turning patient is improving pulmonary ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) balance with the help of gravity • Does virus virulence and mortality levered? - with high probability during summer population resistance was raised and mortality was reduced because of recipient /patient more resilience. winter season can lead to next lovering of human resilience and arising mortality. 126\n\n127. I Since the ecological environment remains harmful, antioxidants can be utilized as an anti inflammatory and vascular auto-regulatory agents in the treatment and prevention of lung diseases of any etiology. inclusion of antioxidants in the first 2 weeks of COVID19 treatment so that the patient at the peak of disease intensification is ready to have a compensatory tool - NO. Cheapest way of implementing antioxidants in treatment is by Vit.C (1), and can be immediately used worldwide. Change in the preparedness and treatment of the pandemic 127\n\n128. Smart global environmental policy • Less combustion accompanied by less free radicals in the air • Suggestions about accommodation the vulnerable part of population in a rural (Nox,ROS free) environment • healthy, antioxidant-rich food • recommendation for hard exercisers (fitness, wrestlers) , to reduce physical activity. As exercise rises oxidation in organism, person becoming more vulnerable against pandemic virus (1), (2), • Is the prospect of a significant reduction in mortality due to the pandemic. 128\n\n129. How can public health protect the population from the harmful effects of oxidation • Doctors and Government can provide recommendation to the general population and especially vulnerable part of population • Avoid being in a polluted air environment, and move when after choosing a better time and route (1) • Enriching daily diet with food antioxidants • Avoid foods that are saturated with free radicals (processed foods, “junk food”) 129\n\n130. How can governments and international organizations protect the population from the harmful effects of oxidation? • Air pollution reduction-optimization • Encourage environmentally friendly businesses and construction • Facilitate the resettlement of vulnerable groups in a clean environment • Encourage the cultivation of foods rich in antioxidants • Constantly informing the population about detailed and current geography- cartographic data on air pollution • Consideration of modal wind direction in urban planning so that the wind blows air from the newly built factory, port, airport, highway without crossing the city • Obligation to equip pollution sources with catalytic converters • Consideration of environmental risks in urban planning. • Imposition of environmental tax for air polluting businesses (manufacturing, aviation, fuel, ships-navigation, logistics-transportation). • Prohibition of Harmful Random Burning Practices, Introduction of Forest Fire Prevention and Immediate Response Systems • Distribution of \"healthy food vouchers\" for the socially vulnerable population 130\n\n131. Questions to be answered by the science Could not-medical measures: • purifying air • avoiding polluted air places Could medical measures: • recommending receiving antioxidant rich diet • pharmacological antioxidants (as part of treatment of covid19 patients or prevention measure for vulnerable group) drastically low mortality rate and save many lives? 131\n\n132. Smoothies against hazardous V / Q mismatch? 132\n\n133. An additional argument in favor of widespread use of the medical mask • Research has shown that it is crucial for humans/populations to retain the ability to produce endogenous nitrogen oxide • This ability is mainly concentrated in the epithelium of the respiratory tract, mainly in the nasal epithelium. • During the cold season, when the nasal epithelium dries out while indoors and can no longer act as the first immune barrier, the body's overall resistance to infection is reduced. • The SARS-CoV2 virus has a special tropism towards the nose and the nasopharyngeal epithelium becomes a springboard for it to spread throughout the body. This is confirmed by the 70% accuracy of the PCR test taken from the nasal mucosa. Frequent and long-term use of the medical mask not only protects the respiratory mucosa from the virus but also protects it from PM2,5, PM10 particles in the polluted air, and maintains the optimal heat and humidity of the nose and throat. 133\n\n134. call for collaboration and introducing future research designs 134\n\n135. Need in International Research • We believe that antioxidants can be found to increase the patients/populations resistance both at the before the disease, and at the initial stage of the disease, within 10 days after the manifestation (we do not see the rationality of taking antioxidants later). • But world need to make international, multidisciplinary, worldwide recognizable collaboration to give valid and Reliable answers to Health providers and Governments. 135\n\n136. • The difference in mortality between patients in different populations is so obvious that it can only be explained by the different basic physiological resistances of the populations. The aim of the study is to identify the factors of declining population resistance, as well as the factors of enhancing population resilience. • If a specific cause of reducing population resistance is identified and its reducing factor is found, this knowledge becomes an important tool in the fight against the pandemic. 136\n\n137. Wide international scientific collaboration is required to conduct 11 more studies simultaneously, to determine the importance of oxidative stress-antioxidants in population resistance against the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that the results of these 10 studies, will help achieve global validation to the basic idea, and prove its infallibility. • 1. Determining of oxidative stress by Lipid Peroxides in the blood and evaluate the correlation of disease outcomes (COVID or other). • 2. Determining of oxidative stress by Lipid Peroxides in the blood and evaluate the correlation of differences between populations with the disease severity. • 3. Research (1) gives us excess mortality peaks by area and by dates. Research objective: To understand how long it takes the mortality peak to decrease (if there is a correlation) after air purification (we know, that after lockdowns air in local areas become much cleaner. • 4. Hospitals where 90% of patients at the ICU (1) required artificial ventilation must be compared to hospitals where only 30% of patients treated at the ICU required artificial ventilation. The correlation between the data of these hospitals and the degree of local air pollution should be investigated. • 5. Anti pandemic resistance of people practicing special, traditional, rich with antioxidants food ration (Muslims, Buddhists, and Jews) living in the US and Europe, must be compared to general population average resistance. • 6. Detailed comparison of the resistances of the populations of 10 countries, with the participation of the national CDC of those 10 countries. Evaluating correlation with air pollution data from NASA, Eumetsat, Copernicus, Giovanni satellites. • 7. Giving an antioxidant (in the food form, or tablets) to randomly selected infected (contracted SARS-CoV-2) people from vulnerable groups on the initial stage of illness. Evaluating disparities and correlations after 3 weeks.. • 8. US-African-American and Latin American Victims Diet • Comparison with African Africans on the matter of antioxidant or free radicals content.. • 9. Statistical comparison of other comorbid diseases (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases) in African Americans and Latin Americans by contamination of air in living areas with ROS/NOx. • Comparison with Africans (Africans living in Africa) by the same parameters. • 10. Evaluating the correlation between patients’ Fractional Expired Nitric Oxide (FENO) , COVID19 disease severity and progression, territorial air pollution, diet, preexisting diseases, smoking history and demographic data from residential areas. • 11. FENO can be easy and quick obtained with Nitric Oxide Analyzer. All patients with confirmed COVID19 and control group of healthy individuals from the same geographic location should be tested using Nitric Oxide Analyzer for Fractional Expired Nitric Oxide. Tests should be repeated in 2-3 weeks. If study produces valid results Fractional Expired Nitric Oxide could be used as a screening tool for prognosis of severity of COVID19 cases. 137\n\n138. We believe that it is necessary to answer the listed questions as quickly as possible with global, scientific credentials so that governments and international organizations can start and take appropriate measures before the 2020-2012 cold season. We have 11 research designs, including chronologically the first and urgent, collaboration with 10 countries CDCs. We need to continue our research: we call for patronage, connections, internationalization and contributor. To begin with, we ask for help in organizing international interdisciplinary workshops/hackathon to make the research international and valid. 138\n\n139. We asking for international institutes, experts, organizations, and benefactors to participate in 11 rapid research. all of those researches could give answers for 1 month. It is also very important to establish correlations among oxidation prevalence and disease severity, with high tech equipped institutes, on a histological, physiological experimental level by establishing appropriated researches by highest level expert scientists. Most of those research are more prolonged and cant give results just after 1 month. 139\n\n140. 4 slides, worth to return Mortality among men is 10-60% higher than mortality among women. The excess of two hormones in women is Estrogen and Melatonin. Both of these hormones are carriers of antioxidant properties. Thus, antioxidants are saving agents. 140\n\n141. Mortality by age during the COVID19 pandemic. anty-disease resiliannce decreases with almost geometric progression with increasing age, so does ability of endothelium produce endogenous Nitrogen Oxide. 141\n\n142. Age related inability to produce Nitrogen Oxide 142\n\n143. returning to first picture, 5-?th slide SARS-CoV-2 viruses damages cardiomyocytes (right picture) but, can not damage endothelial cells (1), on left picture you see cardiomyocytes before virus invasion, protected by endothelium 143\n\n144. Pragmatic reading of research results How to strengthen against the pandemic at the individual level. • The ability to produce endogenous nitrous oxide prevents fatal complications in the patient • To maintain the ability to produce endogenous nitric oxide, protect the body with antioxidants • Take care of the main source of endogenous nitric oxide production - the mucous membranes/epithelium layer of the upper respiratory tract, nasal-pharyngeal, and facial sinuses. • Protect the respiratory mucous membranes: ROS Avoidance / Accommodation from Polluted Air Environment • Protect the respiratory mucous membranes : from direct infection agents, dust and dehydration - with a medical mask 144\n\n145. If research becomes valid, credible, globally recognized, and proves a research hypothesis, medicine can use oxidation stress treatment /prevention against SARS- CoV-2 infection • Medicine, pharmacy is given the field to study the effectiveness of antioxidant agents in increasing the patient's resistance to infection: • Vitamin C • Melatonin • Estrogen • L Arginine • Coenzyme Q10 • Phenolic acids and Flavonoids, • Vit A, Vit E • Zn (Zinc) • Mg (Magnesium) • Glutathione (inhaled, oral) • Omega -3 • Thermally untreated plants rich in antioxidants (anise, berries, ground apples, walnuts, tannins, tkemali, kale, coriander, rosemary, honey, basil, ombalo ..) • Preventive Antioxidant oral/nasal spray • Antioxidant insufflated masks • The role of antioxidants in gerontology 145\n\n146.

Epilogue As we mention early, it is impossible for all the postulates of this study to become globally uncritically valid, at this stage. The presentation introduced to you is social activity, an appeal to the global scientific community to show the relevance, rationality, and importance of research to combat the pandemic by increasing the basal resistance of the population. • Our research is an initiative from which the world's mighty science institutions, highly qualified experts, and laboratories should take the action. • Science should thank global politics, as the EU and the US have set billions of euros and dollars for anti-COVID-19 scientific researches. • Consider that our research is a hypothesis that if global science prove it, humanity will be armored with a new powerful weapon in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which will not only reduce but more than halve the strength of the pandemic. • Winter and spring can be very late and much harder and more expensive to deal with oxidative stress without prior preparation. So we have to hurry • World needs a new anti-pandemic preparedness plan, the sooner the better It is the turn of scientists, science institutes and politics! 149\n\n150.
