        "text": "WASHINGTON -- Two U.S. senators have called for a criminal investigation of a former British spy who authored a salacious report about Donald Trump when he was a businessman, a report known as the Steele Dossier.\n\nThe letter, released on January 5 by Republicans Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham, adds to the turmoil that has plagued the Trump administration and will likely deepen the bipartisan rancor in Congress over both the dossier and also interactions between Trump associates and Russian officials.\n\nIn their letter, the two called on the Justice Department to investigate Christopher Steele for what they alleged were false statements Steele made about how the dossier was circulated.\n\n“This referral does not pertain to the veracity of claims contained in the dossier,” the senators said in a statement.\n\nSteele and his lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nSteele, a former MI6 officer with deep experience in Russia, was hired by a Washington-based political research firm known as Fusion GPS in the summer 2016.\n\nFusion had earlier been retained by a Republican donor interested in gathering embarrassing political dirt on Trump, but after Trump won the Republican nomination, Fusion was hired by a law firm with connections to the Democratic Party.\n\nSteele’s research, which focused on Russia and Trump’s ties there, resulted in a 35-page report that circulated among political operatives and reporters in Washington for months until BuzzFeed published the entire dossier online in January 2017.\n\nNews reports have said the FBI had considered paying Steele for more research but later decided not to.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied the allegations in the dossier. Some Republicans have also asserted that the dossier was what prompted the FBI to open its criminal investigation in July 2016 into Russia’s interactions with Trump-connected officials, something contradicted by court documents and other public statements.\n\nGrassley, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, earlier called for a Justice Department investigation of Fusion GPS, suggesting the firm was involved in a Russian-linked lobbying campaign to undermine the 2012 U.S. Magnitsky Act, which punishes Russians deemed to be human rights abusers.\n\nIn an opinion piece published in The New York Times on January 2, the founders of Fusion GPS accused Republican lawmakers of trying to obscure Trump’s Russian connections and called on Grassley to release transcripts of their testimony to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is one of three congressional panels investigating interactions between Trump associates and Russian officials.\n\nThe FBI probe, now taken over by Special Counsel Roberty Mueller, has resulted in two indictments and two guilty pleas, including from Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.\n\nThe Tbilisi city court has found former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili guilty of abuse of power in connection with a 2006 murder case and sentenced him in absentia to three years in prison.\n\nJudge Giorgi Arevadze on January 5 announced the verdict against Saakashvili, Georgia's president from 2004 until 2013, convicting him of abusing his presidential powers by trying to cover up evidence about the murder of Georgian banker Sandro Girgvliani, and issuing pardons for four men who were convicted of the killing.\n\nSaakashvili, who rejects the charges as politically motivated, said on January 5 that his conviction was the result of pressure from one of his major political opponents in Georgia, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, who Saakashvili linked to Russian state-controlled energy giant Gazprom.\n\n\"The so-called 'ruling' against me by a Georgian court that is fully under control of Gazprom-shareholder Ivanishvili is absolutely illegal and contradicts all international and domestic regulations and common sense,\" Saakashvili wrote on Facebook from Ukraine, where he currently resides and is an opposition politician.\n\n\"The trial of a president for using his right to pardon, which is not limited by any means, shows that the case is fully politically motivated,\" Saakashvili said. \"It also shows that Georgian authorities have not been able to find anything against me in the last five years -- neither facts of corruption nor other violations of the law.\"\n\nSaakashvili said a simultaneous court hearing against him in Kyiv showed that \"oligarchic authorities in Ukraine and Georgia are operating in synchronicity and in full coordination with each other\" against him because he is \"the leader of a battle against corruption, oligarchs, and the robbery of the people.\"\n\nSaakashvili said the world knew that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"has been demanding both Georgian and Ukrainian authorities to implement repressive measures\" against him.\n\nPutin \"repeated that in his recent press conference,\" the 50-year-old Saakashvili said, claiming that talks aimed at \"neutralizing\" him were conducted between Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Ivanishvili in Georgia several days before Poroshenko issued an order to strip him of his Ukrainian citizenship last summer.\n\n\"According to my sources, [the issue was also discussed] by Poroshenko and Putin in a telephone conversation on December 29, 2017,\" Saakashvili wrote.\n\nSaakashvili's government-appointed lawyer, Sofio Goglichidze, said after the ruling that the court violated \"a number of legal provisions and the constitution\" in convicting former Georgian president.\n\n\"It is obvious that political persecution is going against Mikheil Saakashvili. It was impossible to deliver a guilty verdict in the case in accordance with the law,\" Goglichidze said.\n\nGirgvliani, who headed the foreign department of United Georgian Bank, was found dead in January 2006 outside of Tbilisi with multiple injuries after he was seen arguing in a bar with high-ranking Interior Ministry officials.\n\nSaakashvili was the president of Georgia when Girgvliani was killed and issued presidential pardons for four Georgian men who were convicted of murder in the case in 2006.\n\nIn November 2014, when Saakashvili was no longer the Georgian president, prosecutors charged him and other former Georgian officials of being accomplices in the falsification of evidence presented in the murder trial.\n\nKhatia Dekanoidze, a member of Saakashvili's United National Movement party in Georgia, said the January 5 verdict in Tbilisi might help Ukrainian authorities extradite Saakashvili to Georgia.\n\n\"Nobody doubts that the charge was motivated and ordered,\" said Dekanoidze, who served as the head of the Ukrainian National Police when Saakashvili was governor of Ukraine's Odesa region in 2015-16.\n\n\"I do not exclude Mikheil Saakashvili's extradition [to Georgia] because the administrative resources of the two countries are working together\" against him, Dekanoidze said in Tbilisi.\n\nBut Saakashvili's lawyer in Ukraine, Ruslan Chornolutskiy, told RFE/RL on January 5 that his clients legal status should prevent his extradition to Georgia.\n\n\"According to Ukrainian laws, a person who was a Ukrainian citizen and for the last several years resided in Ukraine cannot be extradited,\" Chornolutskiy told RFE/RL. \"That is what the law says on foreigners and individuals without citizenship, as well as the international convention that Ukraine has ratified.\"\n\nIn Ukraine, Prosecutor-General Yuriy Lutsenko has accused Saakashvili of abetting an alleged \"criminal group\" led by Ukraine's pro-Russia former president. Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after his ouster in February 2014.\n\nUkrainian authorities also claim that protests led by Saakashvili in Ukraine are part of a Russian plot against the government in Kyiv.\n\nSaakashvili on January 3 accused Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) of being involved in the fabrication evidence presented against him by Ukrainian authorities in Kyiv's ongoing criminal trial against him.\n\nHe did not provide evidence to back up the assertion.\n\nWith reporting by Apsny.ge and Newsgeorgia.ge\n\nThe U.S. call for support for Iranian antigovernment protesters drew a mixed reaction at the United Nations, with some U.S. allies questioning whether an international response was justified and Tehran accusing Washington of seeking to derail an international nuclear deal.\n\nAmid a backdrop of diplomatic maneuvering, state television showed footage of pro-government rallies that were held in several Iranian cities on January 6, while social media showed images and video of antigovernment demonstrations in the capital and other areas.\n\nThe rallies came hours after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley opened an emergency session of the UN Security Council on January 5 with an impassioned plea for “brave” Iranian demonstrators, saying they are \"risking their lives\" to assert their rights to criticize the government and pursue a better life.\n\nIRAN LIVE BLOG: Follow events as they happen\n\n\"The Iranian people are rising up in over 79 locations throughout the country,\" Haley said. \"It is a powerful exhibition of brave people who have become so fed up with their oppressive government that they are willing to risk their lives in protest.\"\n\n\"The Iranian regime is finally on notice: The world will be watching what you do,\" she said.\n\nBut Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, said the United States was \"abusing the platform of the Security Council\" with a \"bogus\" pretext to interfere in the domestic affairs of a member nation.\n\nHe also accused the White House of using the events in Iran as a false pretense for scrapping a deal that requires Iran to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nThe Trump administration certified Iran's compliance twice last year, but in October the president declined to certify for the first time, pointing to Iran's ballistic-missile development and other matters that he said were in violation of the \"spirit\" of the deal.\n\n\"The true underlying reason for convening today's session lies not in attempts to protect the human rights and interests of Iranian people but in a veiled attempt to use the current moment to continue the line towards derailing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which aims to settle the situation around Iran's nuclear program,\" Nebenzya said.\n\nIranian UN Ambassador Gholamali Khoshroo also accused the United States of \"bullying\" and \"abusing\" its power to summon a meeting of the Security Council on a matter he said was \"outside the scope of its mandate.”\n\nEnvoys from China, Sweden, Bolivia, and several other countries also expressed reservations about whether the Security Council was the right forum for discussing the protests.\n\nBut in perhaps the biggest blow to U.S. hopes of galvanizing support for the protesters, some U.S. allies in Europe also questioned the move to raise the matter before the Security Council. Only British UN Ambassador Matthew Rycroft openly defended the move.\n\n“However worrying the events of the last few days in Iran may be, they do not constitute per se a threat to international peace and security,\" said France's UN ambassador, Francois Delattre.\n\n\"We must be wary of any attempts to exploit this crisis for personal ends, which would have the diametrically opposed outcome to that which is wished,\" he said.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:39 0:00\n\nThe rebuff from close U.S. allies prompted a tweet from Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif claiming that Iran had successfully fended off the U.S. attempt to organize any UN intervention in Iran.\n\n\"The UNSC rebuffed the U.S.'s naked attempt to hijack its mandate -- Another [foreign policy] blunder for the Trump administration,\" Zarif tweeted.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged being disappointed about the response to the Iranian protests, especially from Western allies.\n\n\"We're a bit disappointed that the European Union has not taken a more definitive stance in supporting those voices in the country that are calling for reform,\" he said in an interview on January 5 with the Associated Press.\n\nDiplomatic Battle\n\nThe diplomatic maneuvering follows a week of antigovernment street protests in Iran that have led to the deaths of at least 22 people and reports of an estimated 1,700 arrests.\n\nAt the same time, pro-government demonstrators have rallied in several Iranian cities amid government claims that the unrest has been brought to an end.\n\nOn January 6, state TV showed hundreds of government supporters waving Iranian flags and chanting anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli slogans in cities such as Amol in the north.\n\nReports in Western media about antigovernment demonstrations in Iran have decreased since Tehran blocked key social-media sites used by the protesters to spread video of the earlier unrest, which has been seen as the strongest challenge to the country's Islamic leadership in almost a decade.\n\nThe Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), part of a global project collecting evidence of Internet censorship, said on January 5 that its data confirm the government has blocked Telegram, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger during the protests.\n\nRFE/RL obtained credible reports on January 6 from sources in Iran about overnight demonstrations against Iran's clerical rulers in Tehran, Takestan, Khomein, Arak, Mashhad, Qazvin, Rasht and Lahijan, despite the presence of security forces.\n\nImages were also released of the funerals of two protesters who died during the demonstrations.\n\nState media has reported that, despite the statement, the IRGC is continuing to deploy security forces in different parts of the country.\n\nState TV showed footage of pro-government rallies on January 5 in cities, including Tabriz and Kerman, marking the third day of such demonstrations.\n\nWhile leading Friday Prayers in Tehran, hard-line cleric Ahmad Khatami said he backs the government's blocking of social media to disrupt the spread of information about the protests. He claimed that when the government blocked social media, \"the riots stopped.\"\n\n\"The nation does not support a social network whose key is in the hand of the United States,\" he said.\n\n'Have No Mercy'\n\nHe added that the judiciary should have compassion for those who have been “tricked” into protesting, but those who continue to speak out “are Americans.”\n\n“Have no mercy on Americans,” he said.\n\nThe protests, which began over economic hardships suffered by Iran’s youth and working class, have evolved into an uprising against the powers and privileges of what some critics call a remote elite, especially Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIranian Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli on January 4 downplayed the number of protesters who have participated in the marches over the past week.\n\n\"The relevant authorities have reported that there have been, at most, 42,000 people, and that is not a very high number,\" the minister was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency.\n\nIran's army chief asserted on January 4 that local police forces had mostly quelled the unrest, but he said army troops remain ready to intervene if needed.\n\nIranian Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadi said the protests were continuing, however, despite such assertions, and she urged her countrymen to press on with their demonstrations in interviews published on January 4.\n\n\"People are still in the streets. Even if they go home, their anger would remain, and the protests would resurface months or years later,\" Ebadi, a human rights lawyer who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nMeanwhile, rights group Amnesty International called on Iranian authorities to investigate reports that security forces have \"unlawfully\" used firearms against unarmed protesters and to protect hundreds of detainees from torture and other ill-treatment.\n\nEven before the UN debat, the protests had set off a diplomatic battle between the governments of Iran and the United States, with Tehran accusing Washington of stepping up “its acts of intervention in a grotesque way in Iran's internal affairs under the pretext of providing support for sporadic protests.\"\n\nTrump Chimes In\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to help Iranians \"take back\" their government and the White House weighed imposing sanctions on those involved in the crackdown against demonstrators.\n\nTrump has issued Twitter statements several times in support of the protesters, including a tweet on January 3 that said he respected “the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government.”\n\n“You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!\" Trump wrote in the post.\n\nWith reporting by Golnaz Esfandiari, Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa, and Press TV\n\nWASHINGTON -- The United States has imposed sanctions on five Iranian companies it says are involved in Tehran’s illegal ballistic-missile program.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on January 4 said the \"sanctions target key entities involved in Iran's ballistic-missile program, which the Iranian regime prioritizes over the economic well-being of the Iranian people.\"\n\nThe five companies are subsidiaries of Iran's Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group (SBIG), an Iranian defense entity that is already under U.S. sanctions.\n\nThey were listed as Shahid Kharrazi Industries, Shahid Sanikhani Industries, Shahid Moghaddam Industries, Shahid Eslami Research Center, and Shahid Shustari Industries.\n\nAt a December 14 news conference in Washington, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, showed what she called was concrete evidence that Iran was supplying weaponry to the Huthi rebels in Yemen in violation of UN sanctions.\n\nShe displayed one of the fragments from a missile fired by the rebels toward Saudi Arabia that she said bore the logo of SBIG.\n\nAsset Freezes\n\nUnder the new sanctions, any assets the firms hold in U.S. jurisdiction will be frozen and U.S. citizens will be barred from doing business with the companies.\n\nA UN resolution passed in connection with the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal prohibited Tehran from supplying, selling, or transferring weapons unless the Security Council approved it. A separate UN resolution bans the supply of any weapons to the Huthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nAlthough the sanctions were not directly related to the antigovernment protests that have erupted on the streets of Iran over the past week, Mnuchin said the authorities should spend more on public welfare than on banned weapons.\n\nThe protests began on December 28 in the country's second-largest city, Mashhad, initially over complaints of rising prices, but they have led to complaints over corruption and the lack of freedoms in the country.\n\n\"As the Iranian people suffer, their government and the [Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps] fund foreign militants, terrorist groups, and human rights abuses,\" he added.\n\n\"The United States will continue to decisively counter the Iranian regime's malign activity, including additional sanctions targeting human rights abuses.\"\n\nHarsh Criticism\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the State Department have issued harsh criticism of the Iranian authorities for their crackdown on the protests and have threatened additional sanctions.\n\nIranian officials claim to have the unrest under control, with state television on January 4 showing video of pro-government counterdemonstrations in several cities, although the reports cannot be independently confirmed.\n\nIn its January 4 announcement, the U.S. State Department also said it had added three individuals linked to Al-Qaeda to its global terrorist list.\n\nIt identified the three as Muhammad al-Ghazali, Abukar Ali Adan, and Wanas al-Faqih, saying they were affiliated with either Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), Al-Shabaab, or Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).\n\nIt added that Ghazali is a senior member of AQAP involved in internal security and the training of the group’s operatives.\n\nAli Adan is deputy leader of Al-Shabaab, which is active in Africa; while Faqih is an AQIM associate who planned the March 18, 2015, Bardo Museum attack in Tunis, Tunisia, that killed at least 20 people, it said.\n\nISLAMABAD -- Pakistan has responded harshly to a U.S. decision to suspend at least $900 million in security assistance, saying Washington's \"arbitrary deadlines, unilateral pronouncements, and shifting goalposts are counterproductive\" to addressing the threat of terrorism.\n\nThe statement from Pakistan's Foreign Office on January 5 said the \"impact of the U.S. decision on the pursuit of common objectives\" was \"likely to emerge more clearly in due course of time.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office said Islamabad was \"engaged\" with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration \"on the issue of security cooperation and awaits further details.\"\n\nIt also said \"it needs to be appreciated\" that Pakistan has spent more than $120 billion during the past 15 years, largely of its own resources, on the fight against terrorism.\n\n\"We are determined to continue to do all it takes to secure the lives of our citizens and broader stability in the region,\" the Foreign Office said.\n\nU.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on January 4 that at least $900 million in U.S. security assistance to Pakistan's military would be frozen until Islamabad took \"decisive action\" against Afghan Taliban and Haqqani-network militants that operate within Pakistan's borders.\n\n\"The Taliban and Haqqani network continue to find sanctuary inside Pakistan as they plot to destabilize Afghanistan and attack U.S. and allied personnel,\" Nauert told reporters in Washington.\n\n\"Until the Pakistani government takes decisive action against the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani group...the United States will suspend that type of security assistance to Pakistan,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said details of the aid suspension were still being worked out, but the funds were earmarked for reimbursing Pakistan for foreign military operations and counterterrorism operations.\n\nThe AFP news agency quoted an unnamed senior U.S. administration official as saying the freeze could affect up to $1.9 billion worth of assistance.\n\nThe United States will also continue to suspend $255 million in foreign military financing that has been held up since August to pressure Islamabad to take tougher action against militants.\n\nU.S. officials who briefed reporters stressed that the suspension did not affect civilian aid to Pakistan.\n\n\"We're hoping that Pakistan will see this as an incentive, not a punishment,\" a senior State Department official said.\n\nA senior Pakistani senator expressed disappointment in reaction to the U.S. decision, saying it will hurt relations between the two countries.\n\nNuzhat Sadiq, the chairwoman of the foreign relations committee in the upper house of Pakistan's parliament, was quoted by AP as saying that \"what the U.S. is doing now is not good for its policy against terrorism and for a lasting peace in this region.\"\n\nThe White House on January 2 said it was calling on Pakistan to do more to fight terrorism and that it would announce \"specific actions\" within days to pressure Islamabad.\n\nIn a Twitter posting on January 1, President Donald Trump threatened to cut off billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan, accusing Islamabad of being a safe haven for extremists operating in Afghanistan.\n\nTrump said the United States had \"foolishly\" given Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid over the past 15 years, \"and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.\"\n\nThose in the U.S. government who are frustrated with Pakistan are not limited to the White House.\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers also accuse Pakistan of playing a double game by turning a blind eye to militant groups seeking sanctuary, despite promising to crack down on them.\n\n\"Pakistan is one of the most duplicitous governments I've had any involvement with,\" Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters on January 4.\n\n\"Their, in essence, support of the Haqqani network, or...allowing them to have safe harbor in their country when they're the greatest threat to our men and women in uniform,\" he added.\n\nIslamabad denies that it intentionally allows militant extremists to have sanctuary in Pakistan.\n\nEarlier on January 4, Pakistani Major General Asif Ghafoor told Geo Television that Islamabad seeks to continue its cooperation with the United States but that it will not \"compromise on national interests and prestige.\"\n\nHe said Pakistan will respond to any actions taken by the U.S. government against Pakistan, although he was not specific.\n\nReuters news agency quoted Miftah Ismail, Pakistan's de facto finance minister, as saying that the \"aid cuts will not hurt us.\"\n\n\"That's not the leverage they have, because it is something they have reduced drastically over the years,\" he added.\n\nForeign Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif said the actions of the United States are not something that a friend does to another friend.\n\n\"The U.S. behavior is neither that of an ally nor of a friend,\" Asif told Capital TV. \"It is a friend who always betrays.\"\n\nWith reporting by AP, Reuters, and The Washington Post\n\nZalmay Khalilzad, the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and the United Nations, expressed support for President Donald Trump’s tough line against Islamabad and said the administration is likely studying various methods to put pressure on Pakistan for what he called its lack of cooperation in the fight against terrorism.\n\n\"I consider Trump's action positive and I support it,” he told RFE/RL in an interview conducted on January 4, referring to the president’s Twitter comment on New Year’s Day accusing Pakistan of \"lies and deceit\" and of providing a safe haven for terrorists operating in Afghanistan.\n\nIslamabad rejected the accusations, saying it \"cannot be held responsible for the collective failure in Afghanistan.\"\n\nKhalilzad said, however, that \"the conclusion that has been reached in the United States is that Pakistan does not cooperate.\"\n\n\"The United States has arrived at what the Afghans have been saying for a long time -- which is that Pakistan's policy toward Afghanistan, terrorism, and the fight against terrorism is not genuine.\"\n\nThe comments come as the White House has called on Pakistan to do more to fight terrorism and says it will announce \"specific actions\" to pressure Islamabad, possibly as soon as January 4.\n\nCutting Off Assistance?\n\nThe actions were not identified, but a senior administration official on January 3 said the moves would likely include a cutoff of \"security assistance\" to Pakistan, although it remains unclear how much or what type of assistance would be cut or for how long.\n\n\"A step that is being debated in the United States is how to pressure Pakistan's military,\" Khalilzad said in the interview.\n\nHe suggested that members of the Pakistan military and ISI intelligence service who \"are directly involved in the war and work against Afghanistan\" could be put on a blacklist to bar them and their families from travel to the United States and to have their assets under U.S. control frozen.\n\nHe also said the United States could potentially downgrade Pakistan’s status as a non-NATO ally, or even cut off all military assistance to Islamabad.\n\nIt could also stop providing funds that it currently gives Pakistan in return for allowing the transportation of goods through its territory to U.S. troops and personnel in Afghanistan.\n\nKhalilzad said debate is also under way to consider potential financial pressure that could be exerted on Pakistan from international organizations, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and by \"U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia and those in Europe and Asia.\"\n\nThe Reuters news agency quoted Miftah Ismail, Pakistan's de facto finance minister, as saying that the \"aid cuts will not hurt us.\"\n\n\"That's not the leverage they have, because it is something they have reduced drastically over the years,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Major General Asif Ghafoor of the Pakistani military told the Geo Television station that Islamabad seeks to continue its cooperation with the United States but that it will not \"compromise on national interests and prestige.\"\n\nHe said Pakistan would respond to any actions taken by the U.S. government against Pakistan, although he was not specific.\n\nThe Afghan-born Khalilzad served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama from 2007 to 2009. He was ambassador to Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005 and to Iraq from 2005 to 2007.\n\nA Russian journalist says authorities in Latvia have given her 24 hours to leave the country, accusing her of being a threat to national security.\n\n\"Today, a resolution was issued. Local border guard services were very surprised because they themselves are trying to read it and understand how that could happen,” Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted Olga Kurlayeva as saying on January 4.\n\n\"There will be an expulsion. The reasons are unknown yet. I was told that they are the same as in my husband's case -- that is, I pose a threat to national security,\" said the correspondent from Russia's VGTRK media group.\n\nKurlayeva’s husband, Russian TVT reporter Anatoly Kurlayev, was detained and deported from the Baltic country after he arrived to Riga on January 1.\n\nKurlayev later said that he was expelled because he was on a document signed by the Latvian interior minister declaring that he had been banned from entering Latvia since 2015.\n\nInterior Minister Rihards Kozlovskis said on January 3 that in 2017 Latvia had blacklisted 100 people for different reasons, including an \"unfriendly attitude\" toward Latvia and its people.\n\nThe government has not made the list public, citing confidentiality issues.\n\nCommenting on Latvia's decision to expel the two journalists, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Riga \"grossly violates\" its international obligations to ensure freedom of speech.\n\n\"It is absolutely clear that the Latvian authorities, with the silent support of Brussels, are attempting to suppress all non-desirable media from the country,\" Zakharova said.\n\nRiga is \"violating the fundamental rules of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\" and Russia will make an \"appropriate response at the international bodies,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Kurlayev, his deportation might be linked to a documentary he produced called NATO At The Gates, which included materials he had gathered in Latvia in 2015.\n\nTVT said it did not understand the decision, adding that Kurlayev was in Latvia on a private visit.\n\nIt added that Kurlayev’s deportation “clearly demonstrates Latvian authorities' biased attitude toward Russian media,\" according to the Russian news agency TASS.\n\nTensions between Russia and the former Soviet republics in the Baltics -- Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia -- have increased since Russia's seizure of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\nAll three Baltic states are now members of NATO and the European Union.\n\nWith reporting by Interfax, TASS, AFP, Vesti.ru, and RT"
