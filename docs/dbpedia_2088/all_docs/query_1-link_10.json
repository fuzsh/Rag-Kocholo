        "text": "In an environment of repression and fascism in Punjab, where counter-insurgency is state policy, India continues to reward Hindutva domestically with Modi’s re-election. Following the consecutive assassinations of Bhai Paramjit Singh Panjwar in Pakistan in May 2023, and Bhai Avtar Singh Khanda in the UK and Bhai Hardeep Singh In Canada in June 2023, and the attempted assassination of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in America – India’s targeting of Sikhs has garnered international attention.\n\nBeyond India’s borders Indian repression remains in the spotlight. This has been in large part due to discourse on Indian foreign interference becoming part of a public inquiry in Canada highlighting conclusions the Sikh community has long drawn about the nature of scope of India’s targeting of Sikhs.\n\nToday a documentary produced by ABC’s Avani Dias was released amidst wider coverage that highlights Indian foreign interference in Australia.\n\nIndian intelligence officers were trying to gain access to sensitive defence technology and airport security protocols. They were targeting former and current politicians as well as a state police service. Crucially, they were also accused of monitoring the Indian Australian community.”\n\n- Infiltrating Australia: The long arm of the Indian state is reaching Australians and threatening national security.\n\nThe documentary, which features a number of Sikh activists including Bhai Moninder Singh, hones in on Hindutva, Indian repression targeting Sikhs, and BJP political organizing in Australia. Avani Dias was herself essentially expelled from India for producing a previous documentary that highlighted India’s approach to Sikhs that advocate for Khalistan. Her expulsion followed a take down notice issued by the government of India targeting a documentary on Hardeep Singh Nijjar: Dias says a ministry official called to inform her of the decision regarding her visa. “He specifically said it was because of my Sikh separatist story, saying it had gone too far,” she said.\n\nThe full documentary can be watched below:"
