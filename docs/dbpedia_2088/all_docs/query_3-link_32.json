        "text": "On May 6, two unidentified gunmen shot down the Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) chief and designated terrorist Paramjit Singh Panjwar alias Malik Sardar Singh in Johar Town, Lahore in Pakistan.\n\nThe radical Sikh outfit Dal Khalsa’s head Kanwar Pal Singh confirmed Panjwar’s death and said, “According to our information, he was on a morning walk when two gunmen shot him dead.” The two unidentified men on a motorcycle shot him while he was walking close to his house in Sunflower Society in Johar Town, along with his gunman, who was provided to him by the Pakistani government, at about 6 in the morning. The gunman got injured in the shootout and is currently under treatment in a hospital.\n\nAs per reports, the KCF chief was born in the Panjwar village near Tarn Taran in Punjab. In 1986, he was radicalised by his cousin Labh Singh and joined the Khalistan Commando Force (KCF). However, after his cousin, Labh Singh, was neutralised by Indian security forces, Panjwar took control of KCF and went to Pakistan in the 1990s.\n\nHe was featured on the list of most wanted terrorists in India. Panjwar kept the KCF alive by raising funds from the cross-border trafficking of arms and heroin. It was also reported that Panjwar was smuggling drugs and weapons into Punjab (India) using unmanned drones.\n\nFurthermore, he has been implicated as the mastermind behind Rulda Singh’s murder in 2009, who was the leader of the Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, a division of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He also played a significant role in the high-velocity twin bombings in Patiala and Ambala in 2010.\n\nIn December 2015, Portugal’s police detained him after an Interpol red flag notice was issued at the Indian government’s request. Later, he went free when Portugal’s authorities rejected India’s request for extradition.\n\nThe Government of India’s July 2020 notification designating Panjwar as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) stated, “Panjwar is presently based at Lahore in Pakistan and operating from there. He has been arranging arms training to youths in Pakistan and remained engaged in supplying of arms and ammunition and subsequent infiltration into India for targeting Very Important Persons (VIPs) and economic installations.”\n\n“Panjwar had been broadcasting highly seditious and separatist programmes on Radio Pakistan, intended to incite the minorities against the Government of India. He also remained active in smuggling of drugs and is a major conduit between smugglers and terrorists. Panj war’s complicity in promoting drug trade and Fake Indian Currency Notes operation in Punjab are well documented. Efforts are being made by his organisation i.e. KHALISTAN COMMANDO FORCE, to reactive former militants, sleeper cells and also those on bail and has been in favour of forming nexus with other forces hostile to India,” the notification added.\n\nThe notification said, “Red Corner Notice No. A-461/09-I 995has been issued against Paramjit Singh @ Panjwar.” It added, “the Central Government believes that Paramjit Singh @ Panjwaris involved in terrorism and Paramjit Singh @ Panjwaris to be notified as a terrorist under the said Act,” and amended the Fourth Schedule of the UAPA to include Panjwar’s name in the list of designated terrorists."
