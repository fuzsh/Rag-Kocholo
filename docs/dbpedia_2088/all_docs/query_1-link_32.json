        "text": "He was the was the head of terrorist organisation, ‘Khalistan Commando Force’\n\nLahore (Pakistan) – Paramjit Singh Panjwar, the head of Khalistan Commando Force, a Khalistani terrorist organisation, was shot dead in Sunflower society by unidentified bike riders. He was residing here disguising as, ‘Malik Sardar Singh’. In the year 1990, he sought asylum in Pakistan. He was ranked 8th, in list of terrorists. Originally, he was a resident of Panjwar village in Taran Taran District of the Punjab State. It is not clear yet who killed him and why. It is surprising that he was killed despite Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI has provided the security for him.\n\nParamjit Singh Panjwar was smuggling drugs and weapons into Punjab, through drones, from Pakistan. He used to run his terrorist organisation using the money he got from smuggling. His wife and children live in Germany. Pakistan has always claimed that ‘Paramjit Singh does not live in our country’.\n\nIn October 2020, Shauryachakra winner Balwinder Singh Sandhu was killed at Taran Taran in Punjab. Paramjit had a hand in it. Paramjit had also carried out a bomb blast, near the passport office in Chandigarh on 20th June of 1999."
