        "text": "*FUNAAB, Best University of Agriculture in Africa* ...Changing trajectory on transformation strides. According to the latest Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings (WUR) for 2024, the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB) has emerged the best University of Agriculture on the African continent and 7th position globally. The 2024 WUR utilised the new 3.0 methodology, evaluating 2,671 entries from 1,906 universities across 108 countries and regions. This methodology involved 18 meticulously calibrated performance indicators, assessing institutions in five key areas: Teaching, Research Environment, Research Quality, Industry, and International Outlook. The ranking process involved the analysis of over 134 million citations from 16.5 million research publications and incorporated survey responses from 68,402 scholars globally. In total, 411,789 data points were gathered from 2,673 institutions that submitted their data. The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Babatunde Kehinde, extended congratulations to the entire University community for this inclusive achievement and called for further collaboration to achieve greater feats. Notably, FUNAAB had previously secured the 2nd position in Nigeria in the 2023 Sub-Saharan Africa University rankings and was recognised as the best public university in Nigeria. The credibility of the Times Higher Education Rankings, trusted worldwide by students, teachers, governments, and industry experts, was emphasised in light of the 2024 league table, which highlighted shifts in the global higher education landscape. It would be recalled that the University in recent years started the journey of transformation with the infrastructural and human capital development and topped the effort with the installation of modern state of the art equipment to aid the mandate of the institution which are Teaching, Research and Extension Services .\n\nüåæ New Publication Alert! üåæ I am excited to share my latest research article, \"Performance Evaluation of Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) in Andhra Pradesh,\" published in the International Journal of Agriculture Extension and Social Development. üîç Abstract: The study evaluates Rythu Bharosa Kendras's (RBKs) performance in Andhra Pradesh using multi-stage random sampling to represent the whole study area. 400 respondents were selected from state for three consecutive years: 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to construct performance indicators. Key Findings: Predominantly young and male workforce with a strong educational background in agricultural sciences. RBKs cover various villages and manage diverse land areas, indicating a flexible operational scale. Significant improvements in infrastructure development, particularly in digital technologies and agricultural testing equipment. High availability of key services such as Rythu Bharosa, e-crop booking, and crop insurance, with steady enhancements in marketing and registration services. A positive trajectory in the overall performance index, reflecting comprehensive service delivery and infrastructure growth, thereby supporting sustainable agricultural practices and rural development. üìà Policy Recommendations: Continued investment in infrastructure and training. Enhancement of digital literacy and market support. Coordinated efforts to improve RBKs' effectiveness in promoting agricultural development and improving farmers' livelihoods in Andhra Pradesh. This research underscores the critical role of RBKs in fostering sustainable agriculture and rural development. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this vital area of study and look forward to seeing the positive impact of these recommendations on the farming community in Andhra Pradesh. üìÑ Read the full article https://lnkd.in/gAFW3wac #Research #Agriculture #SustainableDevelopment #RBKs #AndhraPradesh #Farmers #DigitalAgriculture #PolicyRecommendations #AnalyticalHierarchyProcess #AHP)#RBK\n\nThe Barbados-based Caribbean Examinations Council‚Äôs (CXC) decision to remove the Agriculture Double Award from its syllabus has been described as ‚Äúshort-sighted‚Äù by agricultural economist Dr Omardath Maharaj, who believes this will have a ripple effect on food production in the Caribbean. Speaking to Guardian Media on the decision, Dr Maharaj expressed deep concern over its implications, saying agriculture has always been part of the Caribbean economy. While the CXC says the Single Award in Agriculture will still be offered, Maharaj said he was not satisfied with this consolation. Instead, he believes the subject should be reassessed to include modernized agricultural technologies. Saying CXC‚Äôs decision was shortsighted, particularly in light of the Caribbean‚Äôs challenges with food import dependence, climate change and the post-COVID-19 economic landscape, Maharaj called for the subject to be reinstated. He pointed out the contradiction in making such a decision while regional leaders were championing initiatives like Caricom‚Äôs 25 by 25, which aims to reduce extra-regional food import dependency by 25 per cent by 2025. Maharaj called for urgent reflection on why the Agriculture Double Award was developed in the first place and the type of human capital needed in the sector today. He stressed that agriculture education is not limited to basic planting but encompasses a wide range of related disciplines crucial for achieving regional development goals. Highlighting the potential long-term impact of this decision, Maharaj warned that it might deter interest in tertiary education in agriculture and related fields. ‚ÄúThis will eventually have an impact on tertiary education in the field if we broadcast the message that nobody is interested, it is hard work, loss-making, and linked to roadside vending as marketing,‚Äù he said. He cited St Vincent and the Grenadines and Guyana as examples of the power and potential of the agricultural economy, suggesting that these nations demonstrate what can be achieved with a robust focus on agriculture. He also said the decision to remove the subject undermines the potential of youth involvement in agriculture, rural development, and an inclusive, self-sustaining future. Maharaj called for a reassessment of the educational agenda, emphasizing the need for better instructional designs, policy advocacy, and structural changes to address the current challenges. Last week, CXC announced plans to discontinue agricultural science (double award) and mechanical engineering at the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate and Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination levels; as well as electrical and electronic engineering, and technology and green engineering. The suspension of these subjects is expected to take effect in September 2025. Dr Wayne Wesley, the CEO of CXC, has said this decision was made due to a decrease in student engagement. - GUARDIAN MEDIA\n\nPresentation of DEEP Farm Agricultural transformation is a priority in the policy agenda of several countries to meet the challenges of food and nutrition insecurity, climate change, youth unemployment and overall economic growth. In this context, digitalization of agriculture could be a game changer in boosting productivity, profitability and resilience to climate change. In this line, DEEP FARM is a consortium of 12 partners where 3 European universities will support 8 universities in four third countries (Madagascar, Ivory Coast, Haiti and the Dominican Republic) to addresses the skills gap existing and will work to reinforce the knowledge and capacity of students in agronomy degrees with new tools in AI and Big Data to face the challenges in modern agriculture in a ‚Äúlearning by doing approach‚Äù to support the Green Deal. With this purpose, it will tackle the different states of advancement and challenges of the higher education institutions (HEIs) located in the third countries and will address their specific regional needs by delivering theoretical training courses on e-agriculture and experimental activities through country specific Uses Cases for: olive crops (Turkey), rice (Madagascar), cocoa (Ivory Coast), strawberry and mango (Haiti), and banana (Dominican Republic). More than 245 students involved in DEEP FARM with complementary profiles (computer science & agronomy), 45 professors, and 10 entities/stakeholders such as farms and IT companies involved in the use cases will be benefited from the execution of the project. Indeed, the training will contribute to addressing the mismatches between the requirements of employers and the offer of higher education institutions. As result, the HEIs in the mentioned third countries will generate online training content to be available as a MOOC in FUN platform, as well as real data obtained from the Use Cases that will be available in ESTIA‚Äôs DATA LAB.\n\nQuite happy to see my journal article published (online version for now) in Agricultural Economics. In this study I examined the impact of subsidies on productivity growth in agriculture globally using a long time series on the nominal rate of assistance for 42 countries that covers over 80% of agricultural production. The econometric results show heterogenous effects from various subsidy instruments depending on the choice of productivity measure. The study finds that input subsidies have strong positive impact on both output growth and labor productivity. While output subsidies have impact on output growth only, subsidies of other types reveal no significant impact on any of the productivity measures considered. The incidence of agricultural support policies needs to be examined in context as the details emerge on their role in efficiency gains. Careful review and repurposing of certain policy instruments is of high importance given that the sector is facing the threat of global climate change and price uncertainty https://lnkd.in/eBDnNZjc"
