        "text": "Land Information System is a tool for legal, administrative and economic decision making as well as an aid for planning and development. The present land administration system in Pakistan is entirely based on paper land records and maps lacking standards with outdated information stored at different administrative levels. Such practice restricts the usefulness of reliable and quality land information for supporting tenure security to citizens, socioeconomic development, and urban/rural development including infrastructure. This situation demands for a methodological framework to assess the quality of the existing system before going to take necessary action for quality improvement. There have been a few efforts to standardize the procedures for assessing the quality of land administration systems at international level but there is no internationally accepted or standardized method to assess the quality of a standalone land administration system within a country's environment. To be able to assess the quality of a standalone land administration system, this paper develops a methodological framework for assessing the quality of the existing land administration system in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan through systematic use of case study methodology including both exploratory and explanatory case study approaches. The main outcomes of this research leads to a standardized framework that can be used for assessing the quality of a standalone land administration system within a country's environment.\n\nThis paper investigates land administrationin Pakistan. Why is land administration strategically important and challenging especially for developing countries such as Pakistan, what exactly are the barriers and how can geospatial technologies, literature as well as best practices related to land administration help to break these barriers? To address these questions, this paper investigates land administration in the country to identify barriers and their nature such as policy, legal, economic, political, institutional and technical that are being faced at various levels of government from national to provincial. We make use of questionnaire and semi structured interviews of the experts involved in land administration as instrument to collect and validate data in addition to study the latest published reports by World Bank, US-Aid, UNDP-Pakistan, Asian Development Bank and FAO, etc. We then critically reviewed the relevant literature in order to determine the existence of the identified barriers and their frequency of occurrence in other countries, as well. This procedure helps to discover the gap between theory and practice. The literature review coupled with study of best practices is benefited to gain knowledge about resolution of the issues. Finally, the paper presents recommendations to be adopted by the Government of Pakistan to implement successful land administration and management system in the country. The paper finds that although the Government of Pakistan has vision to setup state of the art system for land administration in the country but still it is far away from reality. The paper concludes that sustainable development and poverty alleviation is just a dream without an effective, efficient and fit for purpose Land Administration System (LAS).\n\nEvaluation and assessment of land administration system has been getting more attention over the last few years. Different assessment approaches have been tried across land administration systems at international level to assess the performance of these systems, but the attention is given to only those parameters which are common to all these systems. In some cases, legal and technical parameters are considered while institutional and organisational parameters got more attention in others. There have been a few efforts to standardise the procedures for assessing the performance of land administration systems at international level but no internationally accepted or standardised method is there to assess the quality of a standalone land administration system. There is a need to develop a framework for assessing the quality of a standalone land administration system in a country taking into account all its components and parameters as per quality requirements. The core objective of this paper is to develop a framework for applying the concepts of total quality management to land administration system. The case of land administration system in Pakistan is presented and discussed in this paper. The quality improvement guidelines are then developed within the broad context of total quality management for improving the quality of land administration system in Pakistan, which was presupposed as deteriorated.\n\nThis paper sets out a framework for a set of indicators and reviews the critical issues in land administration, with comparisons drawn from both within and across the regions. The report sets out a global synthesis of the 17 country case studies, regional report; reviews land administration principles, and the context for projects to strengthen land administration systems. It provides the situation in the four regions as well as a brief overview of the situation in the 17 country case studies. One of the potential shortcomings of describing past experience is that critical issues may be systematically overlooked. To remedy this, the report delivers a systematic discussion of future challenges in the development of more efficient and effective land administration systems.\n\nTransparency, accountability, efficiency and fairness are the main features for good governance. It is presently lacking in most of the public sector departments of developing countries. The existing system of land record keeping of agricultural and residential land especially in rural areas is highly unscientific. Centuries old drawings produced with inaccurate survey methods and drawn on piece of cloth are kept by a very low level employee. He can abuse his powers due to lack of knowledge by the common/illiterate people. Land grabbing mafia uses them to misuse the property of poor/weak people. In order to know about the owner of a piece of land we have to dig the record kept in files, which are not accessible to every body. The record keeping and land transactions are therefore not transparent; it leads to inefficiency, misuse of powers (unfairness) by the land management staff and corruption without any accountability. Technology can resolve this problem. Land Information System (LIS), a computer software can provide complete information about any piece of land with location, sizes, owner’s information etc. LIS is updated, in case of any land transaction/change of tenure. It is also connected to the central data base, which is helpful to implement land reforms, prepare land use plan, raise the state revenues and find the tax evaders etc. Therefore it serves the purposes of good Governance. The problem areas faced in adoption of LIS have been identified in a case study of public sector organization and there solutions have been suggested."
