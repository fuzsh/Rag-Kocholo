The discussion focused on the role of public sector universities in achieving sustainable development, capacity building, and policy support for the fisheries industry.Key points included the importance of research initiatives for sustainable fish farming and climate impact assessments, the potential for Punjab University to offer training programs for fishermen, and the facilitation of partnerships between the government, private sector, and fishing communities. They also discussed how Punjab University could contribute to policy-making through evidence-based recommendations, the establishment of community outreach programs, and comprehensive environmental and social impact studies.The meeting highlighted the potential for fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the fisheries sector and emphasized the need for awareness campaigns about sustainable practices and climate change effects. CEO RCIMLP Pakistan remarked, ‚ÄúToday's discussion with Punjab University is a crucial step towards identifying how we can collectively improve our fisheries sector. We explored various avenues where academic expertise and research can significantly contribute to sustainable development.‚ÄùVice Chancellor of Punjab University stated, ‚ÄúOur dialogue today underscores the vital role that educational institutions can play in societal advancement. We are keen to explore further how our university can support the fisheries sector through #Shrimp farming research, training, and community engagement.‚ÄùThe Research Center for International Maritime Law and Practice (#RCIMLP) Pakistan is dedicated to improving and modernizing the fisheries and marine life protection sectors through innovative solutions, policy advocacy, and community engagement. Punjab University, Lahore, is one of Pakistan‚Äôs oldest and most prestigious universities, known for its extensive research, diverse academic programs, and commitment to societal development. www.rcimlp.com #PakistanEconomy #InvestInPakistan #CPEC #DigitalPakistan #EconomicGrowth #PakistanStartups #SMEsInPakistan #SustainableDevelopment #PakistanFinance #InnovationInPakistan #GreenEconomy #PakistaniBusiness #FinancialInclusion #EntrepreneurshipInPakistan #ExportOpportunities #BlueEconomy #FisheriesDevelopment #SustainableDevelopment #AcademicResearch #PunjabUniversity #RCIMLP #CapacityBuilding #FishFarming #ClimateImpact #Innovation #PublicPrivatePartnership #EnvironmentalImpact #SocialImpact #MarineLifeProtection #TrainingPrograms #SustainablePractices #ClimateChangeAwareness\n\nOur main objective when communicating about PRUDENT project is to ensure that the project‚Äôs outcomes, knowledge and opportunities are effectively diffused to the appropriate target communities, making research results widely accessible. ‚úÖüì£ With our Communication and Dissemination efforts, we strive to: a) raise awareness about the importance of the transition towards sustainable agriculture and forestry and increase visibility of the projects‚Äô goals & outputs to key stakeholders üîéüì£ b) engage the targeted audiences to get feedback, validate and ensure broad applicability and scalability of the project‚Äôs results ü§ù c) promote synergies with other research, policy and communication initiatives, taking advantage of existing dissemination networks and channels ‚ôæÔ∏è d) ensure that the project assets are fully exploited in research, public policy and other market driven initiatives. üìä Watch our work packages video below to learn more about what my colleagues and me will do üëáüëá #communication #dissemination #sciencecommunication #prudent #greennudging #smartfarming #euproject\n\nOn 4th July 2024, we organized an open forum at Almaktoun Senior High school, Yendi to sensitize students on the awareness of opportunities in the agricultural sector and green job as part of Action Learning Project of PolicyLink Leading for Change program. We discussed so many topics with them which includes: 1. OVERVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 2. GREEN JOBS 3. SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE 4. BENEFITS OF PRACTICING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE 5. AGROFORESTRY 6. IMPORTANCE OF AGRICULTURE TO THE YOUTH 7. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN STUDYING AGRICULTURE AND RELATED PROGRAMS 8. GREEN JOBS OPPORTUNITIES IN AGRICULTURE During this discussion, a lot of the students didn‚Äôt know so much about the opportunities in the agricultural sector. We discussed so many opportunities with them and the career opportunities in the agriculture and green jobs sector. The programme ended successful, with the intention to create the green champions club. But almost all participants wanted to be part of the club because of the knowledge they gained from the program. #Team_Green_Youth #the_ambassadors #PolicyLINK_Gh #L4C #Leadingforchange\n\nOver the weekend I, and other students of Chengrong Chen‚Äôs Land degradation and catchment management class, go to experience first hand common soil degradation issues that heavily impact Australian soil health. The Lockyer Valley is a perfect example of the various types of land use the continent experiences, from timber and coal mining, to ranching, farming and residential. The valleys altitude fluctuations allow for some of Australia‚Äôs most fertile and productive soils, prominently producing a huge section of QLD‚Äôs vegetables. We saw this first hand on Moira farm and learnt about successful management of agricultural soils and water sourcing. While these soils are vital to Australia‚Äôs food security some areas are effected by the scars of previous mismanagement. After visiting a rehabilitated coal mine, we got to bear witness to the effects that land clearing can create with water table rises, leading to soil salinisation creating inhospitable sections that are doomed to spread. While the land will never be rehabilitated, adaption techniques to prevent future occurrences were learnt- including ideas on how to minimise the spread. We visited a cattle station where the soils on the property threaten to erode due to the high sodicity, where the ground ‚Äúmelts like sugar‚Äù, while this is an i going issue we learnt what can be done to reduce further soil loss and how they farmers are attempting to remediate this. Many thanks to Chengrong Chen and Robin Thwaites for this experience.\n\nWhile the session certainly provided a depth of context for measuring the ocean economy, many in the industry will be eager to see accelerated progress in this regard ‚Äì as well as clarification on the final version of the Oceans Economy Master Plan. It is almost a decade on from the launch of Operation Phakisa in 2014 which was established to provide a quick and fundamental governmental intervention to facilitate the growth of the ocean economy. Since then, global conditions as well as the lack of ability to pivot accordingly have caused certain sectors of the maritime industry to actually contract.\n\nFacing the climate change challenges, Al Moutmir is promoting #conservationagriculture by encouraging farmers to adopt its main practices : no soil inversion and reduction or total elimination of mechanical soil disturbance, except to inject seeds or plants into the soil by direct drilling techniques, maintenance at all times of a complete soil cover consisting of cover crops and/or crop residues and crop rotations judiciously selected to enhance the crop environment. In this context, Al Moutmir is implementing since 2019 an ambitious No Till program. At UM6P - Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, we strongly believe in the power of this innovative farming practice to enhance soil health, reduce erosion, increase crop yields with lower production costs, mainly due to reduced labour inputs. This frees time for other productive or income-generating activities to improve famers well-being. Hand in hand with the Ministry of Agriculture, Maritime Fisheries, Rural Development, Water, and Forests, we are committed to the promotion of this technology to contribute to the implementation of the national no till program targeting 1 million hectares by 2030. For this agricultural season, Al Moutmir is targetting more than 36 500 hectares in different areas in Morocco. More than 68 no till seeding machines are mobilized to this end. Launch of the program in Moulay Yacoub where the farmers expressed their interest in practicing the no-till.

These regions are Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, R√©union, Saint-Barth√©lemy, Saint-Martin and Mayotte (France), the Azores, Madeira (Portugal), the Canary Islands (Spain) and Smaller Aegean Islands (Greece). üë®üåæ In this respect, specific programmes were established within the Common Agricultural Policy (#CAP) to support the agricultural sector and the supply of agricultural products to these regions (except for Saint-Barth√©lemy and Saint-Martin). Initially this support intervenes per country and later under a single regulation, under the designation of #POSEI (Programme d‚ÄôOptions Sp√©cifiques √† l‚ÄôEloignement et √† l‚ÄôInsularit√©) and smaller Aegean islands (#SAI) programmes. ‚û°Ô∏èThis study, for the European Commission DG AGRI, was conducted by OREADE-BRECHE, coordinated by Pauline Camus with major contributions from Alexia TENAUD, Oph√©lie Edener, Isabelle Martin and Anne-Sophie du Hamel. Many thanks to Carina Folkeson Lillo, Pedro Serrano, Christos Karatzas and Manon Mouly who also contributed to the study.\n\nüå± Exciting News!
