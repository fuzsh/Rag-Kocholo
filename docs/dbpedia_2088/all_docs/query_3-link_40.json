        "text": "Wanted Khalistani terrorist Paramjit Singh Panjwar shot dead by unknown assailants\n\nOn Saturday, wanted in India on multiple terrorism and narcotics cases, and chief of the terrorist organization, Khalistan Commando Force (KCF), Paramjit Singh Panjwar was shot dead by two unidentified bike-borne men in Pakistan’s Lahore. He was also listed as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).\n\nSources in the defence and security establishment said that Panjwar, who was named after his village near Amritsar, was shot dead and his bodyguard injured while out on a walk early morning in Lahore’s Johar town.\n\nThey said it was unclear who was behind the killing but the same modus operandi was used to kill Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) leader Harmeet Singh, infamously known as “Happy PhD”, in 2020 in Lahore.\n\nGiving details, the sources said Panjwar is understood to have been in the crosshairs of Pakistan’s ISI in recent times. There are 22 cases against him on charges ranging from terrorism to fake-currency racketeering.\n\nAs per the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) records, he was accused of arranging arms training for youth in Pakistan, supplying arms and ammunition, and subsequent infiltration into India. He was also accused of smuggling drugs and was “a major conduit between smugglers and terrorists,” records say.\n\nPanjwar’s complicity in promoting drug trade and fake Indian currency notes operations in Punjab is well documented, UAPA records state.\n\nThey add that efforts were being made by his organization – the KCF – to reactive former militants, sleeper cells, and those on bail, and he was in favour of forming a nexus with other forces hostile to India.\n\nSources said while he moved to Pakistan in the early 1990s, his wife and two sons settled abroad. One son is believed to be based in Germany while the other is in Canada, sources said.\n\nHe took over as the KCF chief in 1989 after his cousin Labh Singh was shot dead by the security forces in Punjab.\n\nPGurus is now on Telegram.
