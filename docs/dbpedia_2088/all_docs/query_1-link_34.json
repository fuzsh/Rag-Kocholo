        "text": "I greatly underestimated R&AW before joining this forum. They are no less than MOSSAD.\n\nRAW's operations in Pakistan are minor at best, pretty much on the same level as ISI is active within India at the moment.\n\nThat's why they can plink smaller targets like this, but not exactly larger ones like Dawud Ibrahim etc\n\nDo you really think it is RAW ? I dont think they are so much capable . but, i just hope it is RAW, which wud deter any indian criminal getting safe haven in Pakistan. if they are so good, why are they unable to take Davood Ibrahim ??\n\nexactly my thoughts\n\nRAW foot print. Period.\n\nEven after ten years, this is the first time that our weak foreign minister has attended a SCO meeting in india. Even when India ignored Pakistan, it still met with Bilawal despite the fact that he said in his statement that Modi was a Gujart Butcher. There is an issue in which India is concerned about China's cooperation with Pakistan. Despite what we have right now, we brought back the CPEC talks to the table and also made the indian worry about the deployment of the Pakistan army along the LAC for exercises and so forth. I believe that this is going to force India to have a talk with PakistanI believe that this is going to force India to have a talk with Pakistan. In return for the five soldiers in the Kashmir indianArmy who died, they have given us something in return. In a nutshell, it is an agency war. There is a need for us to strike the Indian fault lines more frequently. This elephant is going mad, so keep it under control, boys.\n\nPak Generals are too weak and scared to attack india. 20 years have gone by india has mastered their game plane and killed thousands of Pakistanis through their proxies.\n\nPakistan in return 'still love the neighbour as we are brothers\" the truth is the evil neighbours wants you dead or converted to Hindu dharam.\n\nRAW is running rampant in Pakistan. What is ISI going to do about it?\n\nPakistan lost the intelligence war decades earlier with india as they were able to manipulate and control the situation at every level.\n\nThousands of Pakistanis including soldiers and police have been murdered in the most horrific manner without Pakistan able to control the situation. Rather we celebrate the downing incident of an indian pilot 4 years earlier which has become boring old news. Indian intelligence has won the war. Pak Generals have become rouge and started to hunt Pak patriots."
