        "text": "Shimla, Aug 1 (UNI) Cloudbursts and flash floods have wreaked havoc across Himachal Pradesh, leading to significant destruction in Shimla, Mandi, and Kullu districts in the intervening night of July 31 and August 1.\n\nThe incidents have resulted in one confirmed death and at least 45 people missing.\n\nIn Shimla’s Rampur area, a cloudburst caused extensive damage early Thursday morning, affecting many houses, schools, and hospitals. Deputy Commissioner Anupam Kashyap reported that 19 people are missing, with rescue operations underway.\n\nTeams from the SDRF, NDRF, ITBP, and Special Home Guard are on the ground, though broken roads have hindered access.\n\nMandi's Thalatukhod region experienced a devastating cloudburst at midnight, causing homes to collapse and halting road connectivity. Nine people are missing, and one body has been recovered.\n\nThe Mandi district administration has alerted the Air Force and requested NDRF assistance. Rescue teams, including SDRF, are working tirelessly despite the challenges posed by the damaged infrastructure.\n\nDC Apurva Devgan is heading to the affected areas on foot to oversee the relief efforts.\n\nIn Kullu, the Malana Nallah region faced severe damage due to heavy rains. The Malana One and Malana Two power projects have been heavily impacted, and the water level in the Parvati River has risen dangerously.\n\nResidents along the riverbanks have been urged to evacuate to safer locations. In the Nirmand area, 8–10 houses, including Patwar Khana, hotels, and shops, were washed away.\n\nSeven to ten people, including seven members of a family, are reported missing.\n\nThe local tehsildar and rescue teams are conducting search operations. Many bridges have been destroyed, and roads are closed, complicating rescue efforts.\n\nAll educational institutions in the affected regions have been closed as authorities prioritise rescue and relief operations.\n\nUNI ML ARN SY"
