        "text": "On 30 April, the Australian media reported that the country expelled two Indian spies in 2020 for trying to steal secrets about sensitive defence projects, airport security, and trade relationships.\n\nThe alleged Indian espionage operation was uncovered by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the reports said that the Indian spies were also closely monitoring Indians living in Australia and cultivating Australian politicians.\n\nOfficially, the Australian government side-stepped the reports. Treasurer Jim Chalmers told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that he would not comment on \"those stories”, adding that Australia had a good relationship with India and \"It’s become closer in recent years as a consequence of efforts on both sides.”\n\nIn 2021, ASIO Chief Mike Burgess referred to the activities of the agents without naming the country involved. In his annual threat assessment he had said besides building relationships with “current and former politicians, a foreign embassy and a state police service,” they had successfully recruited an Australian with security clearance with access to “sensitive details of defence technology.”\n\nThe reports came a day after The Washington Post had named the Research & Analysis (R&AW) officer involved in the foiled assassination plot against Sikh extremist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York last year. The Post also detailed the Australian incidents and noted that the German police had also acted \"to root out agents RAW had recruited within Sikh communities.”\n\nIndia has been more circumspect with the United States. For one, the US has actually issued a court indictment accusing an unnamed Indian official of being the mastermind behind the assassination plot and is also seeking the extradition of one Nikhil Gupta being held by the Czech Republic for facilitating the plot to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.\n\nThe indictment said that an unnamed Indian official designated as \"CC-1” was a “Senior Field Officer” with responsibility for “Security Management” and “Intelligence” and had communicated with Gupta to arrange Pannun’s murder. The official lived in India and directed the plot from there.\n\nLast Tuesday, The Washington Post named the officer as one Vikram Yadav working at the time with the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW). The report said that the operation had been approved by the then Chief of R&AW Samant Goel, and that “US spy agencies have more tentatively assessed that Modi’s National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval, was probably aware of RAW’s plans to kill Sikh activities, but officials emphasised that no smoking gun proof has emerged.”\n\nThe official spokesman of the MEA said that the report made \"unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations” on a \"serious matter”. He said that the Government of India had constituted a High-Level Committee “to look into the security concerns shared by the US government on networks of organised criminals, terrorists and others.”\n\nAfter the Financial Times had broken the 22 November story about the US government thwarting the plot to kill Pannun and warning New Delhi on the issue, the White House said at the time that American concerns had been raised at the \"senior-most levels” of the Indian government and that they expected “that anyone deemed responsible should be held accountable.”\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA) chief William Burns also visited New Delhi to raise the issue with his counterparts and, according to The Washington Post, it was also taken up by Biden with Modi during the latter’s visit to Washington DC in June.\n\nThere is an argument that can be made that national interest trumps all other considerations. True, but in the cases outlined above, it is difficult to argue that.\n\nThe target of the actions seem to be the Khalistan movement which has no traction in India anymore and remains a sentiment that is more visible in the diaspora communities. The Pakistan killings are in a category of their own since they are part of the ongoing covert war between India and Pakistan, though one may wonder why Paramjit Singh Panjwar, a Khalistani terrorist of the 1980s and 90s was targeted only last May.\n\n(The writer is a Distinguished Fellow, Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi.
