        "text": "This paper explores the part that the redistribution of evacuee property—the property abandoned by departing Hindus and Sikhs during the mass migrations after Partition—played in the institutionalization of corruption in Pakistan. By drawing on hitherto unexplored sources, including Pakistan's Rehabilitation Department papers, local police files and court records, it highlights the schemes of illegal appropriation, misappropriation, and paints a wholly convincing portrait of the scramble for millions of rupees worth of abandoned property in the towns and countryside of West Punjab. It shows how politicians, bureaucrats, powerful local notables and enterprising refugee groups grabbed properties, mainly by bribing officers charged with allocating them to incoming refugees, or by utilizing their personal contacts. The paper argues that the fierce competition for resources and temptations for evacuee property encouraged the emergence of a ‘corruption’ discourse which not only contributed to an atmosphere that was detrimental to democratic consolidation in the early years of Pakistan's history, but also justified later military intervention. This not only adds to the empirical knowledge of Partition and its legacies, but also makes a significant contribution towards our understanding of the transitional state in Pakistan.\n\n1 ‘Corruption’ in inverted commas is used to refer to public discourses around notions of ‘accountability’. These are highly politicized and have undermined the process of democratic consolidation. Corruption, though difficult to measure, is according to the World Bank ‘an act of individuals or groups that take advantage of public office for private gain’. Besley, T., Principled Agents? The Political Economy of Good Government (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 10.Google Scholar The term corruption will be used in this paper in its broader sense of political, individual, petty and gross, to include not only all forms of ‘improper or selfish exercise of power and influence attached to a public office or to the special position one occupies in public life, but also to the activity of the bribers’ nepotism, favouritism, patronage and other unfair means adopted by government officials and the public alike to extract some socially and legally prohibited favours.

(eds), Political Corruption: Concepts and Contexts (New Jersey: Transaction Publishers, 2002), pp. 265–280Google Scholar. In part, it also focuses on what Hellman calls ‘administrative corruption’, or the use of ‘private payments to public officials to distort the prescribed implementation of official rules and policies’.

Gurharpal Singh has convincingly shown how political corruption was institutionalized under the Nehruvian state in the early years of India's history. See ‘Understanding Political Corruption in Contemporary Indian Politics, Political Studies’, XLV (1997), pp. 626–638.\n\n17 For a discussion on the consequences for rehabilitation of the abandonment of a large amount of property by refugee populations, see Zweig, R. W., ‘Restitution of Property and Refugees Rehabilitation: Two Case Studies’, Journal of Refugee Studies, 6, 1 (1993), pp. 56–64Google Scholar. In relation to India and Pakistan, Zamindar shows the serious implications for ordinary people and reflects on the parallels between the subcontinent's legislation on evacuee property and that of Israel with respect to the Palestinians. Zamindar, The Long Partition, Chapter 4, ‘Economies of Displacement’, pp. 120–157.\n\n20 For example in the district of Lahore, the Muslim majority of 60 per cent owned about 33 per cent of land and the non-Muslim minority of 39 per cent owned the remaining 67 per cent of land. In the city of Lahore, urban immoveable property tax paid by the Muslims was Rs 406,747 compared with Rs 940,248 paid by the non-Muslims (a difference of more than double). Out of 186 registered factories in Lahore 78 were owned by Muslims and the remainder belonged to Hindus and Sikhs, and out of 97 banks only 7 were owned by Muslims. The higher percentage of ownership was much the same in many other districts and cities of West Punjab. See for details, Singh, K. (ed.), Selected Documents on Partition of Punjab, India and Pakistan, 1947 (New Delhi: National Book Shop, 1991), Doc 101, p. 205Google Scholar; and also see, The Partition of the Punjab 1947: A Complication of Official Documents (Lahore: NDC, 1983), vol. III.\n\n21 The West Punjab Protection of Evacuee Property Ordinance (VII of 1947), in All Pakistan Legal Decisions, XII (Lahore, 1960), p. 511. Intermittently, the authorities in Pakistan modified the definition of ‘abandoned’ or ‘empty’ properties and ‘evacuees’ or ‘intending evacuees’, as well as different sets of refugees’ right to the vacated resources. For a discussion on such categories, see Zamindar, The Long Partition, pp. 127–134; and also see Chattha, I., Partition and Locality: Violence, Migration and Development in Gujranwala and Sialkot, 1947–1961 (Karachi: Oxford University Press, 2011)Google Scholar.\n\n37 The settlement of incoming refugees on the vacated land greatly affected a large number of standing local tenants. The service classes were also badly hit by the loss of long term patronage ties. Many Christians were forced for example to migrate to towns from the rural areas of West Punjab. The wider socio-economic consequence of this is beyond the scope of this paper, but it warrants much more serious exploration.\n\n51 See for example, with respect to the Punjab, Jalal, The State of Martial; and Talbot, Pakistan: A Modern History. In relation to Sindh, Ansari's work Life After Partition has pointed out the political bickerings between the provincial authorities and the centre over the refugee resettlement in which the refugees ‘found themselves caught in the middle’, p. 94; and also see T. P. Wright, Jr; ‘Centre-Periphery Relations and Ethnic Conflict in Pakistan: Sindhis, Muhajirs, and Punjabis’, Comparative Politics, 23, 3 (April 1991), pp. 299–312."
