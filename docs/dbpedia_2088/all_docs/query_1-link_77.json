        "text": "The first inkling that India-Canada relations were in free fall came during the recently concluded G20 summit. India turned down Canada’s request for a bilateral meeting and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had only a pull-aside chat with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau instead. During their discussions, while Modi expressed his deep concerns over the continuing anti-India activities by Khalistan extremists, Trudeau talked tough about “the importance of respecting the rule of law” and concerns about “foreign interference”. It was, however, Trudeau’s actions that followed the meeting that signalled how ties between the two countries had gone truly downhill. When Trudeau’s prime ministerial aircraft developed a technical snag before take-off in New Delhi, he refused India’s offer to fly him back in another aircraft and waited two days, confined mostly to his hotel room, till his plane was fixed."
