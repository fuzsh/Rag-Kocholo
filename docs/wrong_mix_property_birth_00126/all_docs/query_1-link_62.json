        "text": "William Mckinley | Introduction\n\nWilliam McKinley was an American politician and the 25th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1897, until his assassination on September 14, 1901. Born on January 29, 1843, in Niles, Ohio, McKinley rose to prominence in the Republican Party through his strong advocacy for protective tariffs and his leadership during the Spanish-American War. McKinley came from humble beginnings, growing up in a working-class family in Ohio. He briefly attended Allegheny College before enlisting in the Union Army during the Civil War. Serving as a commissary sergeant, he witnessed the horrors of war firsthand and developed a deep sense of duty to his country. After the war, McKinley studied law and became a successful lawyer. It was during this time that he became involved in Republican politics, aligning himself with the partyâ€™s conservative wing. In 1876, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served until 1891, gaining a reputation as an expert on tariff issues. During his time in Congress, McKinley championed protective tariffs as a means to stimulate American industry and protect domestic jobs. His advocacy for higher tariffs made him popular among industrialists and manufacturers, earning him the nickname \"Napoleon of Protection.\" McKinley's support for the high-tariff policy appealed to voters who were concerned about the impact of foreign competition on American businesses, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast. In 1896, McKinley secured the Republican nomination for president and won a decisive victory over his Democratic opponent, William Jennings Bryan. He campaigned on a platform of economic nationalism and a return to conservative fiscal policies, promising \"a full dinner pail\" for all Americans. McKinley's presidency marked a shift in American government towards a more business-friendly approach, as he worked to expand American influence overseas and promote American economic interests abroad. One of the defining moments of McKinley's presidency was the Spanish-American War of 1898. Following the explosion of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor, McKinley led the country into war with Spain, resulting in the acquisition of Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam by the United States. This imperialistic turn in American foreign policy was controversial at the time and had lasting implications for the future role of the United States on the global stage. Despite his successes as president, McKinley's presidency was tragically cut short when he was assassinated by an anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, in September 1901. McKinley's death had a profound impact on American politics and society, as his successor, Theodore Roosevelt, continued many of his policies and ushered in a new era of progressive reform. William McKinley's legacy as a president is complex. He was a staunch advocate for American industry and economic growth, but his presidency also marked the beginning of an era of American imperialism. Regardless of one's political views, McKinley's presidency played a significant role in shaping the United States during a critical period of its history.\n\n5 Facts About William Mckinley\n\n1. President McKinley was the first sitting president to campaign by telephone. In the 1896 election, he used the recently invented device to connect with voters across the country, revolutionizing the way presidents could communicate with the electorate. 2. Despite being known as a conservative president, McKinley signed a law that effectively ended the era of unrestricted immigration to the United States. The Immigration Act of 1891 imposed a $0.50 head tax on all immigrants and excluded criminals, the insane, and certain other individuals from entering the country.\n\n3. William McKinley served in the Civil War as a Union soldier. At the age of 18, he enlisted in the 23rd Ohio Infantry and rose through the ranks to become a brevet major. He participated in several major battles, including the Battle of Antietam and the Battle of Winchester.\n\n4. President McKinley was a strong advocate for the gold standard. He believed that it provided economic stability and steadfastly opposed incorporating silver into the nation's currency, which sparked the contentious 1896 election against William Jennings Bryan, known as the \"Gold vs. Silver\" campaign.\n\n5. A bizarre fact about McKinley is that he had a pet parrot named Washington Post, given to him by a journalist. The parrot was trained to whistle the tune of \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" and would frequently interrupt meetings by squawking patriotic songs."
