        "text": "William McKinley Jr. (January 29, 1843 â€“ September 14, 1901) was the 25th president of the United States, from 1897 until his assassination in 1901. McKinley was the first president to ride in a car.\n\nBefore he became president, McKinley was a congressman of Ohio.\n\nMcKinley was inaugurated in 1897. This was the first presidential inauguration to be filmed.[1]\n\nWhen the USS Maine was sunk, the public wanted war. Congress declared war against Spain in Latin America. This was the Spanish-American War. It started the era of imperialism for the United States.\n\nDuring his presidency, McKinley also supported higher tariffs (taxes on countries which trade with the US). During his term, the United States annexed Hawaii, Cuba, the Philippines, and Wake Island.\n\nMcKinley was elected to a second term as president in 1900. His second term did not last very long.\n\nSee the main article: Assassination of William McKinley\n\nMcKinley was shot by an anarchist named Leon Czolgosz on September 6, 1901. His abdominal gunshot wounds became infected and resulted in gangrene. He died eight days later and Czolgosz said that the President committed war crimes in the Philippines and was an enemy of the people. Czolgosz was executed in the electric chair on October 29, 1901. McKinley was the third American president to be assassinated.\n\nAfter McKinley's death, his vice president Theodore Roosevelt became president.\n\nMcKinley's biographer, H. Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history.[2]\n\nKenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro-business, industrial, and modernizing program, represented by McKinley.[3]"
