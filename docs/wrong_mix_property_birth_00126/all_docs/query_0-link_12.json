        "text": "In 1894 the Riverside Park Company constructed a dam across the Meander Creek so as to enlarge the boating area. They stocked the water with fish in the hopes of attracting the serious anglers\n\nBy 1901 the Riverside Park proved to be unprofitable and the owners, William Allison, Clement Souder, Frances Thomas, E. A. Hartzell, Maggie Hartzell, S. S. Holeton, and Selina Holeton, sold the property to Buckeye Leather Company for $1,700.\n\nThe museum was located on the Tibbetts property where the McKinley Heights Plaza is today at the intersection of Routes 422 and 169 ( Route 169 is still referred to as Tibbetts-Wick Road).\n\nAfter the new National McKinley Memorial opened in 1917, people still visited this museum to see some of the original McKinley furniture and artifacts collected by Lulu Mackey."
