        "text": "The Stark County Historical Society is dedicated to collecting and preserving the significant materials and records related to the history of Stark County and the presidential history of William McKinley through the William McKinley Presidential Library. Celebrated as a National Historic Landmark, The McKinley National Memorial is the final resting place for the 25th President of the United States, William McKinley. Also on the grounds is the William McKinley Presidential Library & Museum - a family-friendly history and science museum, including the McKinley Gallery, historic Street of Shops, Keller Gallery, Discover World, Hoover-Price Planetarium and Ramsayer Research Library.\n\nThe Memorial itself is constructed of Pink Milford Granite and rises 95 feet above the landscape. One hundred and eight steps lead to the entrance of the memorial. The raised double sarcophagus contains the remains of William and Ida McKinley. It was carved from dark green granite and is the focal point to the marble and granite interior. Their two daughters Katherine and Ida, who both died as children, are entombed in the wall of the Memorial. The Memorial was dedicated on September 30, 1907 after two years of construction. President Theodore Roosevelt was keynote speaker at the dedication ceremony. Visitor's Note: Mobility Issues? Call ahead for alternate entrances to the monument's 108 steps."
