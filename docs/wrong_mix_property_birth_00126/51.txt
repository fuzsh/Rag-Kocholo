William McKinley was our third President to be assassinated. The 25th President was also the last president to serve in the American Civil War.

William McKinley, Jr. was born on January 29, 1843 in Niles, Ohio. He was the seventh child of William and Nancy Allison McKinley.

In June 1861, McKinley and a cousin enlisted as privates in the Ohio infantry. McKinley quickly took to the soldier’s life and wrote a series of letters to his hometown newspaper extolling the army and the Union cause. During this time he began a friendship with his mentor Major Rutherford B. Hayes that would remain until Hayes death.

After the war ended, McKinley began to study law and studied at Albany Law School in New York. He later returned to Canton, Ohio to set up his own practice. In 1867, he made his first foray into politics as he made speeches for his friend, Rutherford B. Hayes.

In 1869, he ran for prosecuting attorney of Stark County, Ohio and won. He was defeated in 1871 when he ran for re-election.

On January 25, 1871, he married Ida Saxton, daughter of a prominent Canton family. Their first child was born on Christmas day that year. A second daughter followed in 1873, but she died four months later. Two years later, their oldest daughter died of typhoid fever. Ida McKinley never recovered and her health declined and was often impeded with epileptic seizures.

In the mid 1870s he argued a case for the miners that raised his name recognition.

In October 1877, he took his first congressional seat in the House. In 1880, he joined the House Ways and Means Committee. He began to rise in the Republican Convention over the coming years.

However, he failed to win election for Speaker of the House in 1889.

In 1892, he became Governor of Ohio. The Panic of 1893, almost destroyed the McKinley’s. William McKinley had signed promissory notes without reading them and the crash ruined the businessman who had tricked him. Governor McKinley owed over $100,000 and suggested resigning to return to his law practice to pay his debts. However, his supporters set up a trustee fund and raised money to pay the notes off. His popularity grew and with it came re-election.

In 1896, he received the Republican nomination for President. He won and was sworn in as president on March 4, 1897 and his vice President was Garret A. Hobart.

President McKinley dealt with the war for Cuban independence, the Spanish-American War, the Philippine-American War and the expanding influence of the United States overseas.

In late 1899, Vice President Hobart died. When President McKinley ran for re-election he needed a new running mate and chose Theodore Roosevelt. He won re-election.

On March 4, 1901 his second inauguration was held. He and his wife then took a six-week tour of the nation.

On September 6, 1901, President McKinley was entering the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds to meet the public. Leon Czolgosz waited through the line with a concealed gun and shot the president twice in the abdomen. Upon being shot he urged his aides to gently break the news to his wife.

President McKinley was taken to Milburn House and appeared to improve, however gangrene began to spread. He died at 2:15 a.m. on September 14, 1901.

The funeral train returned his body to Canton, Ohio. A large marble monument was built for the president and his family and dedicated on September 30, 1907. Ida McKinley had died only a four months before the dedication.

According to McKinley’s biographer Wayne Morgan, President McKinley died “the most beloved president in history”. But with the passage of time, President McKinley and his influence have faded away.
