William McKinley was born January 29, 1843 in Niles, Ohio. Following his service in the Union Army during the Civil War under Rutherford Hayes, he was drawn to service in the Republican Party. Yellow journalism at the time urged McKinley to start a war with Spain, leading to an American global empire.
