        "text": "Regarding the death of Liu Fuling, there are two kinds of speculation in history, one is that the young Emperor Zhao died of overwork due to adultery. One was due to doubts about Huo Guang, a loyal servant who had always assisted him, and died in depression and contradictions.\n\nNetwork illustration\n\nLiu Fuling was the youngest son of Emperor Wu of Han, and the original crown prince could not take his turn. As a result, because Empress Wei Zifu and Crown Prince Huan were framed to the back and both killed, Emperor Wu of Han was very fond of liu Fuling and wanted to make Liu Fuling the crown prince, and as a result, he said that he would do it, Liu Fuling was made crown prince, and as soon as Emperor Wudi of Han died, Liu Fuling became the eighth emperor of the Han Dynasty, Emperor Han Zhao. Emperor Han Zhao, who ascended the throne at the age of eight, died at the age of twenty-one, reigned for thirteen years, and was known as Emperor Han Zhao. As for the death of Emperor Zhao of Han, both the Book of Han Zhaodi Ji and the Zizhi Tongjian recorded this, \"In the first year of Yuan Ping (74 BC), ,...... Xia April, The Emperor collapsed in Weiyang Palace\", but a few words, making people suspicious of Dou Dunsheng. Because the history books do not record what serious illness Liu Fuling suffered from, but Liu Fuling did indeed die inexplicably?\n\nEmperor Han Zhao died of illness\n\nEmperor Han Zhao's health has always been good, and the \"Biography of Foreign Relatives in the Book of Han\" says that he was \"five or six years old, strong and knowledgeable\", \"the first crown, eight feet and two inches long\", from a young age, he was as strong as a calf, plus he was dressed in gold and jade since he was a child, and he was well-bred, and he was not yet able to die at the age of twenty-one. Originally, when he was young and vigorous and fleshy, he suddenly fell ill and died, which made people not suspect that it was impossible.\n\n<b>Fun History Official WeChat ID: qulilshi_v5</b>\n\nThe most important clue is that the history books record that Liu Fuling was tall and burly, and \"Emperor Wu often referred to himself as a kind of self.\" It can be seen that Emperor Han Zhao was not weak and could not support for a long time. Therefore, the possibility of dying from cancer can be ruled out. Because even if you have cancer, you have to have a process to die, according to the transition period of getting sick and cancer, it is impossible to die in a short period of time by a strong body.\n\nAnother point is that Liu Fuling was already twenty-one years old when he died, and Empress Shangguan entered the palace very early, and the relationship between the two was certain. However, until his death, Liu Fuling did not leave a species, from which it can be concluded that there must be a problem between the two people. Whether it is a physiological problem or some other problem has not been examined because of its age. Arino shi said that Emperor Han Zhao died of great depression because he had no reproductive function. Of course, it is not impossible, because from the history books, Emperor Han Zhao and Empress Shangguan have been married for so long, but they have never given birth to a son.\n\nEmperor Han Zhao was murdered by Huo Guang\n\nSome people call the Han Zhao Emperor dead nest bag, his death is not just a death of illness. As for how exactly did he die? Of course, we can freely guess, whose interests are greatest for the death of Emperor Han Zhao? It is said that huo guang, a powerful minister, secretly killed Emperor Han Zhao in order to control the government for a long time, which is an assassination or murder, which is obviously contrary to historical facts. The author's analysis believes that although Emperor Han Zhao did not die directly at the hands of Huo Guang, his death was ultimately inseparable from Huo Guang.\n\nIn addition, it is said that Liu He, the king of Changyi, did one thousand one hundred and twenty-seven absurd things less than a month after entering the palace, and on average he had to do almost forty things a day... According to my own opinion, the king of Changyi could not have done more than fourteen absurd things in one day, but he wanted to add to the sin, and there was no excuse for it. Because when the King of Changyi was recruited into the palace, he brought enough people and horses, and these people and horses were all the intimate friends and confidants of the King of Changyi, and the use of people naturally used their own intimate people, then at that time, the power would naturally have to be controlled by others, and Huo Guang, who was single-mindedly assisted, would become nominal and eventually be told to return home. At this time, Huo Guang naturally had to act first, get rid of the King of Changyi and his subordinates, and find his own family member Liu Yi had succeeded to the empress, Liu Yi was already the grandson of the crown prince Liu Zhao, and the crown prince Liu Zhi was the son of Wei Zifu, who was Huo Zhiyi and Huo Guang's sister-in-law.\n\nIn summary, Emperor Han Zhao may have died of illness, or it may have been a conspiracy carried out secretly by powerful officials such as Huo Guang. Of course, Huo Guang's behavior is very questionable, so... The death of Emperor Han Zhao was probably inseparable from him!"
