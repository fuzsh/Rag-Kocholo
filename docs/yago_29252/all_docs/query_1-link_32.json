        "text": "After Han Ziye left, the Shangguan Residence once again bustled with preparations for Shangguan Linlang's grand wedding. After all, marrying into The Royal Family did not allow for the slightest negligence, and considering that Shangguan Linlang would eventually become the mother of the nation, no errors could be afforded. Lady Shangguan personally took charge, attending to every minute detail herself, fearing any oversight.\n\n\"Mother, you don't have to work so hard; just hand it over to the steward and the nannies in the residence. They are all seasoned people here; what are you still worried about? You've been busy since morning, and Linlang feels tired just watching you. Mother, why don't you sit with your daughter for a while, please?\" Shangguan Linlang saw her mother busy back and forth without a moment's rest and couldn't bear it, so she once again tried to persuade her.\n\n\"You'd better sit quietly and make sure not to smudge your makeup. Always be aware of your demeanor, and don't let The Royal Family look down on you. Even if the daughter of the Shangguan Family is from a military background, she is not inferior to those noble ladies. I'm not tired, don't worry about me. Besides, you are my only daughter to marry off, if I don't put in the effort now, I'll never have another chance. Ah, if Qingchen were still here, how wonderful that would be. Seeing his precious little sister getting married, he would have been happier than anyone.\"\n\nLady Shangguan suddenly brought up her son who had died young, feeling a twinge in her heart. But upon seeing Shangguan Linlang's eyes turning red, she quickly changed the subject, \"Today is your big day, look what I've said. Now, you'd better rest in your room. There will be time for you to tire out after the wedding. I must be going to tend to things.\"\n\nAfter she spoke, Lady Shangguan quickly left. But not before repeatedly reminding Shangguan Linlang's maidservants to watch over their mistress properly, not allowing her to wander around. Seeing her mother's lack of trust, Shangguan Linlang found it quite speechless; she never felt she was so worrisome. Why did her mother always treat her like an immature child?\n\nOnce Lady Shangguan had left, Shangguan Linlang quickly got up, planning to move her somewhat stiff body from sitting for too long. Just as she was about to move, her maidservant Xiuxiu frowned and grumbled, \"Miss, please sit properly. If the lady sees it again, she will blame Xiuxiu, saying I haven't kept an eye on you.\"\n\n\"It's alright, Xiuxiu, there's no one else here. You don't need to worry so much. Don't you know me, your mistress? Just sitting here doing nothing is really more unbearable than being punished. I really don't understand why The Royal Family has so many cumbersome rituals and rules to follow. Don't they get tired?\" Shangguan Linlang complained again.\n\n\"Miss, this isn't a battlefield, and today you are not the Commander of the Three Armies. Today you're the General's Daughter in the spotlight, and the future Empress, the mother of the nation. So you really do need to follow these ancient rules. Although Xiuxiu knows it's hard for you, according to your nature, being able to move about rather than sit quietly is always preferable.\"\n\nXiuxiu teased Shangguan Linlang directly, not at all afraid of her mistress. After all, Shangguan Linlang never put on airs. Over time, the people in the residence developed a harmonious relationship. While they revered their mistress like a deity, they also sincerely cared for her. Their relationship with their superiors wasn't as strict as other official families, which is why they dared to joke with their mistress occasionally.\n\n\"It seems you're asking for a spanking, daring to mock your mistress. Be careful I beat you up in a fit of anger,\" Shangguan Linlang threatened Xiuxiu, lifting her small fist.\n\n\"Miss always has a fierce bark but a gentle bite,\" Xiuxiu said, covering her mouth with a giggle.\n\nWhile harmony prevailed in the Shangguan Residence, the Imperial Palace was in the throes of a storm.\n\n\"Yeye, have you taken care of the matters concerning the Shangguan Residence? Remember, as a ruler, one must not be benevolent in a womanly way,\" Empress Dowager Murong Yunyan said with a stern expression.\n\n\"Empress Dowager, I know what I am doing. I have my own discretion; you don't need to worry,\" Han Ziye replied, somewhat impatiently.\n\n\"Yeye, don't blame the Empress Dowager for being meddlesome. I'm saying this for your own good. I fear that you might be bewitched by that wretched girl. Shangguan Linlang is not a suitable match for youâ€”she must die for your imperial seat to be secure. Since you have found the key to dealing with Shangguan Linlang, there's no need to go to such lengths to marry her. The Empress Dowager just doesn't like her, not one bit like a proper lady, always mingling with a bunch of soldiers. What's so good about such a woman? She's not worthy of you, let alone the honor of Empress. The Empress Dowager doesn't want her to get off easily. Since you have decided to end her life, why bother with the grand gesture of marrying her?\" Empress Dowager Murong Yunyan still resented Han Ziye for deciding to marry Shangguan Linlang against her wishes."
