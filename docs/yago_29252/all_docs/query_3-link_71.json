        "text": "[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]1.Leizu (discoverer of silk)\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]Leizu(?--?) was the wife of Xuanyuan Huangdi (Huangdi literally meaningYellow Emperor, living round 2550 BC. Chinese people, i.e., Hantribe, deem themselves the posterity of Huangdi.) A legend had itthat Huangdi had a war with another tribe, whose leader was Chiyou,who, it was said, had the ability to raise heavy fog so that the armyof Huangdi could not find the way where to go. And it was also saidthat Huangdi invented a guide cart, on which there was a flat platewith a magnet in the shape of a big spoon. The spoon could turn roundand the handle of the spoon always pointed south. It was the earliesttype of compass. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] WhenHuangdi defeated Chiyou, he returned in triumph and had a feast ofcelebration. All of a sudden the goddess of silkworm came to offerthe silk to Huangdi for congratulations. Huangdi gave it to his wife,who loved the glistening thin thread very much. She began to breedsilkworm and wove the thread into silk cloth and made a gown for herhusband. She also taught people to breed silkworm. She was thuscalled Lady Silkworm, and in later history was deemed the Goddess ofSilkworm. She died on the way in company of Huangdi when he traveledover the country.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Butthere was another legend about the original goddess of silkworm. Agirl and her father lived together. The father went to fight forHuangdi. There was a horse in the house. One day the girl thought ofher father badly, and she said to the horse, “Oh, horse, if you canbring back my father, I will marry you.” the horse ran awayimmediately and after some time the father came home on thehorseback. The girl was glad, but she forgot her promise to marry thehorse entirely. However, the horse remembered it and got sick. Thefather asked his daughter about the sick horse. The girl was remindedof her promise and told it to her father, who, of course, would notlet her daughter marry a horse. Therefore he killed the horse andflayed the hide of the horse. Then he lay the hide on the ground inthe sun to make it dry. The daughter came close to the hide and said,“You, horse, how can I, a human, marry you, a horse?” Then shestamped her foot on the hide. Suddenly the hide flew up and wrappedaround the girl. The girl was frightened out of her senses and ranoff from home to the nearby woods with mulberry trees. Then shebegan to eat mulberry leaves and spewed out silk threads. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]3. Su Daji (cruelbeauty)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]Su Daji (?--?) wasthe wife of King Zhou (?--1046 BC), who was the last king of Shangdynasty (1765—1122 BC), and proud of his great strength. She camefrom Su clan. Her father was Su Hu, the chieftain of the clan. Shewas a pretty girl and could dance. In 1147 BC, King Zhou conquered Suclan. Su Hu had to give his daughter to King Zhou as his trophy. Itwas the tradition in ancient China that the conqueror always demandedvaluables and pretty girls from the defeater. Since Daji was verybeautiful, the king made her his queen after he got some pretense tokill his original queen. This queen had two sons, who were exiled.The king did these to please his new queen, if not secretly requiredby her. As the new queen could dance, the king ordered the palacemusician Shijuan to compose some decadent music. Daji danced to theobscene music to please the king. The king was so doting on her thathe would grant all her wishes, no matter how absurd and cruel herdesire was. There were some facts recorded in the history books.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] The king had agarden built having a pond filled with wine and a forest with driedmeat fillets hanging from the boughs of the trees. He often held abanquet there, with as many as three thousand officials gatheringthere. They played and chased each other naked among the trees. Theking and the queen liked to row on the wine. Anyone could drink thewine from the pond. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Daji ordered a hugedeep pit dug and put in hundreds of snakes. She would have heroffenders thrown into it to feed the snakes. She also invented sometorture equipment. The most cruel one was a bronze pillar with insidevacant. Then firewood and coal filled it and burned. When the pillarwas hot, a criminal was brought and made to embrace it till he wasburned to death with shrill bitter cries. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Once in winter whenshe saw an old man walking on ice with bare feet. He seemed not tofeel cold. She thought that he might have something special in thebone of his shin. Therefore she ordered to have the man brought toher presence and to have his foreleg cut down to see if anythingspecial inside his bone. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Another time, whenshe and the king sat on the terrace to look at the street. At thetime, a women with child walked by. She said that the woman wouldhave a girl while the king said that she would have a boy. So theybet who would guess right. Then the woman was brought in and herbelly was cut open to see it was a boy or a girl. Two lives lost fortheir absurd bet. Besides these, all the courtiers who criticizedtheir misbehavior were executed. Finally they lost the support ofcourtiers and people and was at last subdued by Zhou dynasty. Theking burned himself and Daji hanged herself. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]4.Qi Wenjiang (an able and adulterous woman)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]QiWenjiang (733—673 BC) was the second daughter of Duke Xi (?--698BC) of Qi dukedom bordering on the East Sea. She had a sister QiXuanjiang. Both girls were beautiful, well-known to all states inChina at the time. It was in the first warring period (770—221 BC)in the history of China. All the dukedoms, marquisates, and earldomsetc. became independent though the king of Zhou dynasty was still inreign in name only. His power could only reach within the territoryof his kingdom. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Duke Ling (540—493BC) of Wei dukedom wanted to have the elder sister Xuanjiang to bethe wife of his son. Her father agreed and sent her to Wei dukedom.But when Duke Ling set eyes on the girl, her beauty stunned him, andhe took the girl as his own wife, to the disappointment of his son.There was even a folk song to sing the praise of her beauty. Sincethat day, Duke Ling stuck to his young wife day and night. If hecould not see her even for a moment, he would look like his soul hadleft his body. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Then Duke Xideclared that he would find a husband for his second daughter. Thenews spread and all the sons of the rulers of other states came tothe capital of Qi dukedom to seek for the hand of the girl. Ithappened because of two reasons. Firstly, the girl was a beauty knownin all states. Secondly, Qi Dukedom was a big state. If a small statehad the relationship with a big state, the small state would havemore safety against other neighboring small states. In that period,there were much more small states than big states. They often wantedto merge others to become big. Among all the suitors, the girlselected the son of Zheng State. But when the son went back to hisown state, he regretted of the marriage and broke the agreement,because he was afraid that the daughter of a big state wouldcertainly bully the son of a small state. He would not be bullied byhis wife. When the girl learned the decision of the boy she hadchosen, she turned irritating and then woeful. She became languishand sick, because the breech of the marriage from the boy's side wasan insult to the girl in the public eye, which meant that the girlmight have some defects in her moral or character. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] She had a brotherand they played together since childhood. As the brother knew thathis sister was sick, he came to see her, desiring to comfort her. Young girl and young boy, no matter what was their relationship, whenmeeting in certain condition, would easily give themselves up forlove action. At that time, there were no moral rules for such thingslike in present days. A beautiful girl and a handsome boy were surelya destined pair. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Lu dukedom was justnext to Qi dukedom. Duke Huan (731—694 BC) of Lu state justsucceeded to the throne and was in need of a wife. Qi dukedom was alarge state while Lu dukedom was a bit smaller, and not so strong.Duke Huan thought that if he got a wife from a big state, he wouldhave a strong support for his rule. So he married Qi Wenjiang thoughhe knew the abnormal relationship between the girl and her brother.Different people have different ideas to a certain thing. Duke Huandid not care for it as long as he had a beautiful wife and strongsupport. After the wedding, the husband and the wife got along welland they had two sons. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] After severalyears, Duke Xi of Qi dukedom died and his son, the brother, turned tobe the new duke, called Duke Xiang (729—686 BC). The rulers ofother states went there for the ceremony. Duke Huan of Lu dukedomwent there, too, but he did not bring his wife together, though thewife begged to go with him. He feared that if the sister and thebrother met again, their fire of love might rekindle. However, if henever took his wife back to her mother state, it would look weird toother states. So after eighteen years, he did go to visit Qi dukedomwith his wife, who was already in her forties. But women in fortiesare still in need of that. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Duke Xiang was gladthat his sister came at length after long years of separation. Herecalled their happy time together. When the duke of Lu state and hiswife settled down in the guest room in the palace, the duke of Qistate asked his sister to see his wife in the rear of the palace. Theduke of Lu state could not say NO to this request. Once in some backroom, the brother and the sister fell into action right away like drywood caught fire. For several days, the duke of Lu state was leftalone and so one day he trespassed into the rear palace and witnessedtheir action. He slapped his wife on the face and dragged her awayfrom the room. He and his wife started immediately back to Ludukedom. He let his wife go ahead and he himself attended thefarewell party given by the duke of Qi state, the brother. He leftthe palace in a coach after bidding adieu, but was killed in thecoach by a knight of Qi dukedom. The knight overtook the wife andreported to her of the death of her husband. The wife clearly knewwhat had happened to her husband, but she said nothing. She let theknight go to back to tell the news to her brother, who hurried hereto meet his sister. The sister stayed on the border of the twodukedoms for a while. And the brother often came to meet her. Finallyshe had to return to Lu dukedom with the news that the duke of Lustate died suddenly on the way back. Although the courtiers of Lustate suspected something, but they had no evidence, and had to keepsilent. Later the knight was executed on some excuses to keep themurder a secret. But on the execution spot, the knight told thesecret to all the people present at the top of his voice. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] When Lu dukedom wasinformed of the sudden death of their duke, the elder son of thediseased duke became the ruler. He was Duke Zhuang. As he was stillyoung and so his mother, Qi Wenjiang, helped him to manage the stateaffairs. She was a capable woman and made Lu dukedom strong and oncedefeated Qi dukedom in a battle, though Qi dukedom was her parentalstate. Anyway, Qi dukedom should not fight Lu dukedom as they werebrother and sister. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]5. Xishi (the firstbeauty of the four beauties)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]Xishi (?--?) livedin the first warring period, later than Qi Wenjiang, who lived in theearlier time of that period. Xishi was born in Ningluo village in thesuburb of Zhuji town in Zhejiang province. Her real name was ShiYiguang. As Ningluo village was divided in two parts, the east partand the west part. Since Shi Yiguang lived in the west part, and soshe got the nickname “Xishi” (Xi means west).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Shewas one of the four beauties, the earliest one, in the history ofancient China. The other three were Wang Zhaojun, Diaochan, and YangYuhuan, whose story was told in another book of mine titled “[/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman, serif]LoveTales of Ancient China[/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman, serif].” There were so many beautiful women in the history of China, why werethese four women that grouped as the four beauties, not others? Nonenowadays can tell the reason. We just tell the stories as they were.Xishi often washed gauze clothes in a stream in her village, andthereby she got another nickname “gauze-washing girl.”[/FONT]\n\nThere were two states bordering each other: Wukingdom and Yue kingdom, both in the present Zhejiang province. Inthe latter part of the first warring period, the Zhou kingdom alreadyperished. Therefore, all survived states after merging calledthemselves kingdoms. In 494 BC, Wu kingdom defeated Yue kingdom andcaptured the king of Yue kingdom, Gouqian by name. Guoqian (520—465BC) showed himself to be a very tame captive and vowed that if hecould be allowed to go back to his own state, he would always beloyal to Fucha (?--473 BC), king of Wu kingdom. Guoqian also bribedBopi, a favorite courtier of King Wu to throw good words for him.King Wu was a good-for-nothing while King Yue was a capable man. WhyYue kingdom was defeated by Wu kingdom was because a very famousstrategist as well as an able general served Wu kingdom. This famousstrategist Sun Zi (545-470 BC) had written a world renowned militarybook titled Arts of War. He was deemed as martial saint. Somefamous rules in the book are “know your enemy as well as yourselfso that you can always be victorious,” “always give your enemy afalse move so as to mislead them.”\n\nAt length, Guoqian was released and went back toYue kingdom. Every year, Guoqian sent a lot of tributes to Wu kingdomto show his faithfulness. But secretly he wanted to have revenge. Oneof his courtiers, Fan Li, suggested a strategy that Guoqian shouldsend the King Wu some dancing girls so that King Wu would alwaysenjoy the dancing and neglect his state affairs, which would provideYue kingdom a chance to conquer Wu kingdom.\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Fan Li (536—448BC) began to look for beautiful girls within the state and he foundXishi one day when she was washing her gauze by the stream. As soonas he set eyes on her, he felt that she was the right girl he waslooking for. So he took the girl to the palace to be taught singingand dancing. After some special training, she was sent to King Wu,who liked the girl very much and did indulge in singing and dancingof the beauty. She could dance clog-dancing and she had plenty oftiny bells sewed on her skirt so that when she danced the bells gaveout tingling to the rhythm of her dancing. The king made her hisqueen and had a new palace built for her, inside which there was aspecial corridor called “clog-sounding corridor.” It was builtlike this—hundreds of big vats were put side by side and woodenplanks were laid on top of them. When the girl danced on the planks,wearing clogs, the empty vats echoed with a hollow sound to meet withthe rhythm of the dancing. The king did neglect his state affairs,and seeing this, Sun Zi left Wu kingdom and lived somewhere as ahermit. Wu kingdom was finally defeated by Yue kingdom. King Wu madesuicide. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] There were twolegends about the end of Xishi. The first one was that when the kingof Wu kingdom died, she was drowned in a river. The second one wasthat Fan Li took her with him, fearful that if King Yue saw her, hemight be charmed by her beauty and also neglect his state affairs.Fan Li became a merchant and lived with Xishi happily till the end oftheir lives.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]6.Zhong Wuyan (an ugly and wise woman)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]ZhongWuyan (?--?) (wuyan literally meaning no beauty) was ugly, but wiseand could fight. How ugly was she? There was a description: a bigbelly, a big head, her forehead and eyes looking like sucked in, andher skin very dark and course. She was suspected that her mother orfather came from abroad, not the offspring of Han tribe. Most famouswomen in Chinese history were beautiful. Only this one was ugly. Asshe was so ugly, no man would marry her. She was still single whenshe reached the age of forty. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Atthat time, King Xuan (?--301 BC) of Qi state was on the throne. Hewas not a capable man with a quick temper. He liked flattering. Therewas corruption all over the state and other states were watching forsome opportunity to invade Qi state. The famous Mencius had come togive him advice, but he would not listen. Qi state at the time had aclever premier Yan Ying (?--500 BC), who was short in stature. Qistate had three haughty knights at the same time. They even sometimesrefused to obey the king. So Yan Ying was afraid that they mightendanger the state. One day there came a chance. There grew a peachtree in the palace. The peach tree produced some large fruits thatday. Yan Ying suggested to the king to give two of the peaches tothe three knights. One knight ate one and another knight ate theother. The third one had none. Yan Ying said to him that it was adisgrace to him that he could have none to eat while the other twoate theirs. The third one was ashamed of himself, and drawing outhis sword, he killed himself. The other two knights said that thethree of them were like brothers. They should not eat the peacheswithout thinking of their brother. They felt ashamed of themselvesfor the neglect. Therefore, they killed themselves on the spot. Thisevent in the history was called “Killing three knights with twopeaches.”[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Oneday the king went hunting with Yan and met Wuyan in the forest. Wuyanwas an ambitious woman and had certain opinions about the state. Sheseized the opportunity to come forth to talk to the king. Sheanalyzed the dangerous situation the state was now in and made goodsuggestions to him. Therefore, at the advice of Yan, the king tookher to the palace and made her his queen. When Yan state, which wasto the north of Qi state, sent a messenger there to test the wisdomof the king. The messenger brought two jade rings connected together.The king was asked to separate them. Just when the king did not knowwhat to do with it, Wuyan came out. She brought a small hammer andused it to knock one ring into two pieces. The rings were thusseparated. However, Yan state yet sent the army in an intention toconquer Qi state. Wuyan led the army of Qi state to meet the army ofYan state and defeated it. She helped the king to make Qi statestrong. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]8.Zhao Ji (mother of the first emperor)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]ZhaoJi (?--228 BC) was the mother of the first emperor of Qin dynasty.(Hence we call him Emperor Qin in this story.) At that time KingZhaoxiang (325—251 BC) was on the throne. He appointed his sonAnyangjun as the crown prince. Anyangjun had more than twenty sons.One of them was Yiren. When Qin kingdom and Zhao kingdom had a war,Qin kingdom was beaten. As a rule, Qin kingdom must send a royalfamily member as hostage to Zhao kingdom. Yiren was chosen and wentto live in the capital of Zhao kingdom. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Therewas in Zhao kingdom a jewelry merchant, by name of Luu Buwei (292—235BC), who was very clever and knew how to calculate his profits. Hisfamous quotation was, “If I invest in fields, I can get profit tentimes . If I invest in jewelry, I can get profit a hundred times. IfI invest in supporting an emperor, I can be rich and powerful all mylife.” He pinned his hope on the hostage Yiren. He bribed theguardsman to let him get in touch with Yiren. Then he befriended thehostage and satisfied him for any demands he had. Then he gotacquainted with the sister of Ladyship Huayang, who was the wife ofthe crown prince, the father of the hostage. As ladyship Huayang hadno children of her own, she was persuaded to adopt Yiren as her son.Every wife or concubine of the royal family wanted her son to be thecrown prince. So ladyship Huayang persuaded Anyangjun to make Yirenhis crown prince when he became the king after the death of hisfather, the present king. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Thenhe selected a pretty clever dancing girl and offered her to Yiren.She became his formal wife. Afterwards, she gave birth to a boy, whowas later the first emperor of Qin dynasty. Yiren was soon summonedback to Qin state. Not long before, King Zhaojiang died and the crownprince Anyangjun became the king, King Xiaowen. And his son Yiren wasnaturally made the crown prince. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] AsKing Xiaowen led a life of dissipation all day long, his healthworsened quickly and died soon. Accordingly, Yiren succeeded to thethrone. He was King Zhuangxiang (281—247 BC). He made his son thecrown prince and Luu Buwei the premier for all he had done for him.Lately, Buwei turned to be more powerful. Yiren got on alert, fearfulthat Buwei might kill him and make himself the king. It was notimpossible. Buwei also felt that the king might harm him. So headvised Zhao Ji, the wife of the king, to do something about it. ZhaoJi reached the position as queen through Buwei. She was grateful tohim, and besides, he was her favorite man while her husband Yiren wasonly their tool to get rich and powerful. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] ZhaoJi induced the king to drinking and merry-making, which caused hishealth to deteriorate fast and the king died soon. Then the crownprince was put on the throne at the age of thirteen, too young tohandle state affairs. Therefore, Zhao Ji was now the queen dowagerand Buwei handled all things. Although the boy was young, he wasshrewd and ambitious. He knew that Buwei was a bad man for power. AndBuwei knew that the young king was not an ordinary boy. There was arumor that the king was the son of Zhao Ji and Buwei. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] BeforeBuwei gave up Zhao Ji to Yiren, they had already made love to eachother. Now that Yiren died, how could Zhao Ji quenched her thirst forlove? She and Buwei met secretly. But they were afraid that theirrelationship might be discovered by the young king. Then Buwei founda man called Miudu, whose specialty was to have a giant penis. Buweisent him into the palace disguised as a eunuch to satisfy Zhao Ji sothat he himself could be away from danger. Presently, the queendowager was pregnant. She feared that her son, the king, might findout. Therefore, she told her son that she wanted to travel. The sondid not doubt anything yet and consented. So she went to live in atemporary residence with Miudu. They had two children.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Whenthe new king came of age, he took all power back in his own hands.When he was on the throne for nine years, in 238 BC, someone informedhim that Miudu was a fake eunuch and had two children with the queendowager, who promised Miudu that if the king died, she would make oneof their sons the king. At that time, the king was twenty-two. AsMiudu was told that the king learned their secret, Miudu immediatelydecided to attack the palace with his followers. The guards of thepalace fought them. The latter was put to rout and Miudu was capturedand executed. The two children were killed too. Luu Buwei was exiledand drank poison to end his life. As for the queen dowager, hismother, she was driven out of the palace to live somewhere else. Theson vowed that he would never see the mother for the rest of hislife. Four years after the death of Buwei, Zhao Ji died of grievance.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]9.Empress Luu (the first empress who had political power)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]EmpressLuu (241—180 BC) was the wife of Liu Bang (256—195 BC), the firstemperor of Han dynasty (206 BC—220 AD). Liu Bang was at first onlya petty officer in Pei town, where the father of Empress Luu was awealthy resident. Once when it was the birthday of the father, as hewas a close friend of the mayor, Liu Bang had to go for thecelebration. He did not bring any gift, but he lied that he had givena precious gift. When the father found it out, he was angry andwanted to expel Liu Bang. However, when he looked at Liu Bang, hechanged his mind because he could read face. The face of Liu Bangshowed that he would be a noble man in the future. Therefore, hemarried his daughter to him. It was towards the end of Qin dynasty. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Therewere many revolts at that time. Liu Bang was the leader of one amongthem. When Liu Bang was riotous, his wife was arrested and put injail by the local yamen. She experienced all the hardship of theprison. At last Liu Bang managed to get her out. From the day she wasreleased, she lived among the army with her husband. Generally therewas no woman allowed in the army, especially a woman who could notfight. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Anotherrebellious group was led by Xiang Yu (232—202 BC). They both aimedat Qin dynasty. They wanted to replace Qin dynasty. Xiang was thefirst to enter the capital of Qin. He overthrew Qin dynasty andburned their palace. The fire lasted for months. Now as the olddynasty no longer existed, the two groups fought each other to decidewho would create a new dynasty. In 205 BC, the two groups had a warand Liu Bang was defeated and his wife was captured by Xiang Yu. ThenLiu Bang gathered his troops and met Xiang Yu's army again. Xiang Yuhad his wife brought out to the front of his array. He said to LiuBang that if Liu did not surrender, he would cook his wife like apig. Liu Bang answered smilingly, “If you cook her, please give apiece of her flesh to me.” Xiang Yu felt that his ruse of threatwas useless, and they fought once more. As no one could subdue theother, they had a truce, and the wife was released and returned toLiu Bang after two years as a captive. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Notlong afterwards, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu had battles again. Finally,Liu Bang used the tactics of Han Xin (231—196 BC), a famous generalin history, to lay ten ambushes and conquered Xiang Yu, who had onlya handful of followers left. He was advised that he could go back towhere he came from. There he could gather more supporters and fightLiu Bang once more. But he always thought of himself a hero. A heroshould never fail. Now he failed and was ashamed of himself. Herefused to go back and killed himself at Wu River. His homeland wasjust across the river. He was a real hero while Liu Bang was a rascalin his character and doings. People of that time thus thought of eachof them. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Nowas no rivals any more, Liu Bang founded a new dynasty known as Handynasty. His wife was duly the empress. She had born two children forLiu Bang. The son, Liu Ying, was made crown prince later, then becameEmperor Hui (210—188 BC) after the death of his father. Thedaughter was Princess Luyuan. Liu Bang had also a pretty concubinecalled Ladyship Qi, who bore a son, Prince Ruyi. Since Ladyship Qiwas the favorite of the emperor, she tried to persuade the emperor tomake her son the crown prince, but courtiers all opposed. So her planfailed. But Empress Luu began to hate her. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] ChenXi (?--195 BC) was a general of Liu Bang. In 197 BC, when Liu becamethe emperor, he was given the title of Marquis Xinyang. He wasoriginally under Han Xin. That year when Liu Bang suspected him forrebellion and summoned him to the capital, intending to kill him, hehad to rebel. So Liu Bang led a large army to fight him. Empress Luustayed in the capital to control the situation. When she was toldthat Han Xin would support Chen Xi to rebel, she made some excuse tosend for Han Xin to the capital. When Han Xin arrived, she killedhim. Some historians commented that if Han Xin rebelled too, he mightdefeat Liu Bang and became the emperor of another dynasty as he was agreat strategist, but he was not a politician. He did not havepolitical insight. Former historians said that it was a pity thatsuch a great strategist was killed by a woman. The woman was anexcellent politician. At last Chen Xi was defeated and killed in thefight. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] WhenLiu Bang died, the crown prince was still under age, and so EmpressLuu became the empress dowager and administrated the empire. She thenused pretenses to eliminate some powerful Liu family members one byone, and gave some important positions to her Luu family members. Theyoung emperor disagreed to what his mother did, but he could donothing about it. Then Empress Luu poisoned Prince Ruyi and had hismother Ladyship Qi's four limbs cut off, her eyes blinded and herears deafened. Her body was put in a pig pen. She was called humanpig. Such a cruel thing did happen, recorded in the history. Theyoung emperor grieved to the heart. So he gave himself up fordrinking and merry-making and died young. Empress Luu maintained herpower till her death. Then her Luu family members were all eliminatedby Liu family members. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]11. Empress Dou (anempress dowager through four generations)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]Empress Dou (205—135BC) was the wife of Emperor Wen of Han dynasty. She was born in acommon poor family. Her father was drowned falling into a river. Hermother died early, too, leaving behind three orphans. In her teenage,she became a palace maid. She thought that she would be a maid allher life, but she was satisfied because she lived better than before.At the time, Liu Bang was the emperor. When Liu Bang died, EmpressLuu gave each of the remaining Liu princes five maids. As her homewas close to Zhao fief, she bribed the eunuch who was in charge ofthe distribution. But the eunuch forgot and sent her to Dai fief. SoEmpress Dou was given to Prince Dai, who liked the pretty girl andmarried her. She bore two sons and a daughter for him. After thedeath of Empress Luu, Prince Dai was supported by all courtiers to bethe new emperor, Emperor Wen (202—157 BC), and his wife was madethe empress, Empress Dou, and his elder son was made the crownprince, later Emperor Jin (156—87 BC). Empress Dou never dreamedwhen she was a maid that she could be empress. But some years aftershe was the empress, misfortune befell her. She was blind. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Then she was nolonger the favorite woman of the emperor. His new favorite woman wasconcubine Shen. But Empress Dou kept her mind peaceful and nevershowed any sign of jealousy. She was always lenient. That was why shecould live through four generations without anyone to vie for herposition. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] When her husbanddied, her elder son, Emperor Jin, succeeded the throne. She wasempress dowager. But as a matter of fact, Empress Dou liked hersecond son, Prince Liang, better. She wanted Prince Liang to be thesuccessor of his brother. Emperor Jin was a filial son and could notrefuse the request of his mother, but all the courtiers opposed itbecause it was the rule in the feudal system that the son succeededthe father. No one should break the rule. Anyway, as she was atalented woman, she helped her son to handle the national affairs.Then, after the death of her son, her grandson became the emperor,Emperor Wu. Now she was grand empress dowager, and the first grandempress dowager in the history of China.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] The grandson was anindependent young man and would not let her grandmother to interferewith his administration. She had to retire to the back palace toenjoy the rest of her life. In the reign of Emperor Wu, the Handynasty expanded its territory. The emperor adopted the works ofConfucius as the reading stuff in schools. Confucius was thus madewell-known since then. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]12. Wang Zhi (from acommon woman to the empress)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]Wang Zhi (?--125 BC)was the second wife of Emperor Jing (188—141 BC) of Han dynasty.She was born in a common family and married an ordinary man calledJin Wangsun, and bore a daughter for him by name of Jin Su.Presently, Wang Zhi deserted her husband and daughter, and enteredthe palace of the crown prince disguised as a virgin. Emperor Jingmade her his concubine. His first wife was Empress Bo, who had nochildren of her own. Another concubine Li Ji had three sons and theeldest son was made the crown prince. Then Wang Zhi bore for theemperor three daughters and a son. At four years old, the son got thetitle of Prince Jiaodong.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] As Empress Bo didnot give any birth, the emperor wanted to depose her from theposition of empress and make Li Ji the empress. Emperor Jing had asister Liu Piao, who had a daughter named Chen Ah Jiao. Liu Piaowanted to marry her daughter to the crown prince. The concubine LiJi did not like Ah Jiao, and so did not grant the wish of the mother.Therefore, the sister hated Li Ji. When Wang Zhi learned therelationship between Liu Piao and Li Ji, she said that she waswilling to let Ah Jiao marry here son, the future crown prince, whoturned out later to be Emperor Wu. Therefore, the sister married herdaughter to her son, Emperor Wu. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Then the sistertold Emperor Jing that if he made Li Ji the empress, when her son,the present crown prince, succeeded the throne, and as Li Ji was acruel woman, she would certainly make Wang Zhi, his favoriteconcubine, be the second human pig. The only solution, she added, wasto decrown the present crown prince, the eldest son of Li Ji so thatshe could never be empress dowager and could never do any harm toWang Zhi. At first emperor Jing did not believe her. Once he wantedconcubine Li Ji to promise that when he died, she should treat otherconcubines well, but Li Ji did not make the promise. Therefore,Emperor Jing decided not to make Li Ji the empress, and moreover,decrowned the crown prince and made him Prince Lingjiang. Li Ji gotseriously sick and died soon. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] In 149 BC, EmperorJing made Wang Zhi the empress and her son the crown prince. In 141BC, Emperor Jing died and the crown prince became the emperor,Emperor Wu (07/14/156—03/29/87). And Wang Zhi was then empressdowager. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] When Emperor Wulearned that his mother had a daughter Jin Su with her ex-husband, hesent someone to look for her. As Jin Su knew that someone was afterher, she was afraid and escaped and hid herself somewhere. At lastshe was found and brought to the presence of the emperor, who let hergo to see the empress dowager, her mother. Empress Dowager was happyfor the reunion with her first daughter. In 126 BC, Wang Zhi died andwas buried with Emperor Jing. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Emperor Wu was agreat emperor of Han dynasty. He conquered the minority in the northand expanded the territory of Han dynasty to the west. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]13. Chen Ahjiao (aquick-tempered empress)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]Chen Ahjiao (?--?)was the wife of Emperor Wu, and was made the empress. When both werechildren, the mother of the girl, who was the sister of Emperor Jing,held the young Emperor Wu on her lap. There were an array of palacemaids waiting on them. The mother asked the boy, “When you grow up, do you want to get married?” the boy said, “Sure.” then themother pointed to the maids and asked the young Emperor Wu, “Who doyou like?” The little boy said that none of them he liked. Then themother, pointing to her daughter Ahjiao and asked, “Do you like her?” The little boy answered that if he could get her, he wouldbuild a house of gold to let her live in. This story is known to allChinese people.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] When they both grewup, Emperor Wu did marry Ahjiao and made her his empress. Emperor Wuwanted to have some kind of reform, but was opposed by some powerfulcourtiers. Even the grand empress dowager Dou had different opinions.But Ahjiao supported him and her parents supported their son-in-law,which made the emperor tide over the crisis. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Ahjiao was a girlwith a quick temper, and besides, she did not have any children forthe emperor for ten years. Gradually the emperor got tired of her.The emperor always had many girls round him. The most favorite oneamong them was Wei Zifu (?--90 BC). Out of jealousy, Ahjiao went tosee the emperor and chided him for neglecting her. The emperor blamedher not to have any children for him. That was why he should haveanother girl for the posterity's sake. He must have at least a son tosucceed the throne. Ahjiao could have nothing more to say and had toretire to her own room. She sent for a doctor after another in hopesof being pregnant, but in vain. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Ahjiao wanted toget rid of Wei Zifu, but Wei was with the emperor everyday, and shehad no chance to have her wish fulfilled. Then she found a witch andasked her to exercise her magic power to win back the favor of theemperor, but no result for several months. The emperor heard of thisand was infuriated. He ordered the witch to be executed and confinedAhjiao in Changmen Hall after she was deposed from her position ofempress. She died in melancholy. Wei Zifu was made the empress.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]14. Wei Zifu (from asinger to the empress)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]Wei Zifu (?--90 BC)was the second wife of Emperor Wu. Wei Zifu was originally asing-song girl in the residence of Princess Pingyang and her husbandMarquis Pingyang. Once Emperor Wu visited the princess and saw thegirl. He liked her on the spot and took her back to the palace. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] When Wei Zifu wastaken into the palace, the empress then was Ahjiao, who hated thebeautiful new-comer and made her a maid only. And she could not seethe emperor, who seemed forgot her entirely. Once the emperor let allthe maids gather in his presence and wanted to dismiss some old ones.Wei Zifu was then among them, and she asked the emperor to let herleave the palace. The emperor saw her and refreshed his liking ofher. He gave her the title of Ladyship Wei, next to the empress. In128 BC, she bore a son for the emperor, named Liu Che, and thus wasmade the empress, since the ex-empress had already been deposed andconfined in Changmen Hall. In 122 BC, the son was declared the crownprince. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] When grown up, thecrown prince showed himself a lenient and clever man. His father, theemperor, liked him very much. But as now the empress grew old, theemperor ignored her. He always preferred new young pretty girls. Hehad later Ladyship Li, Ladyship Xing, Ladyship Yin and Ladyship Zhao.Ladyship Xing and Ladyship Yin were more jealous of each other andwherever Ladyship Xing was present, Ladyship Yin would not come, andvice verse. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] There were somewicked courtiers. The most wicked one was Jiang Chong. He oftenslandered the crown prince before the emperor. He knew clearly thatwhen the crown prince became the emperor, the new emperor wouldcertainly punish him for his evil doings. But the emperor would notlisten to him. At the time, some witches exercised black magic ofcursing the emperor for his death. It was found out and all thewitches were executed. Then the emperor let Jiang Chong investigatewho was behind all this. Jiang Chong seized the opportunity to framethe crown prince. He sent someone secretly to bury a wooden doll withthe birthday of the emperor engraved on it. This was used at the timefor curse of death of someone whose birthday was engraved on thewooden doll. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] The crown princewas a clever man and knew that Jiang Chong would do something to harmhim. He would act first. He went with his bodyguards to see theemperor intending to reveal the scheme of Jiang Chong, just whenJiang Chong led some soldiers to his residence intending to dig upthe doll and take it to the emperor so that it would be a proof thatthe crown prince was cursing the emperor for death. They met in thestreet and fought each other. At last Jiang Chong was killed. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] The emperor sent amessenger to see what was happening. The messenger came back andreported untruthfully to the emperor that the crown prince wasrebelling. So the emperor sent army to subdue the rebellion and thecrown prince was defeated, because he really did not want to rebeland had few fighters with him. The crown prince had to escape andhide himself somewhere. Afterwards he was detected and hangedhimself. When his mother, the empress, heard of it, she hangedherself, too. She held her position of empress for thirty-eightyears, a very long period of time. Finally the truth was known to theemperor, and he killed all those who joined in the pursuit of thecrown prince. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] By the way, EmpressWei Zifu had a stepbrother, Wei Qing by name. He was a famous generalin defense of the northern frontier of Han territory. He was promotedto the position was because of his stepsister, the empress. If he wasan ordinary man, he would not have the chance to be promoted to thegeneralship. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]16. Ladyship Ban ( apoetess)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]Ladyship Ban (?--?)was a concubine of Emperor Cheng (51—7 BC). She was not onlybeautiful, but also versed in poetry, with a good temper. She woulddo everything properly, to the palace etiquette. Once the emperorwanted to go out and let Ladyship Ban sit beside him on the coach,but Ban refused, saying, “Your Majesty, your humble concubine readbooks from olden time that a wise emperor let his good courtier sitbeside him. A stupid emperor let his favorite beauty sit beside him.If your humble concubine sits beside Your Majesty, does it mean thatYour Majesty is a stupid emperor?” The emperor thought that she wasright and let her go.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] When the empressdowager learned it, she really appreciated Ban. She said, “Therewas Fan Ji in Chu State (in the first warring period). She refused toeat meat because the king liked to hunt. People respected her. Nowthere is Ban in our palace. She can be compared with Fan Ji inmoral.”[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Zhao Feiyan, thegreat dancer, was not the empress yet at the time. She was jealous ofthe empress and Ban. She always slandered them both, saying that theywere cursing the emperor to death. Since the emperor now preferredher to other women, he often believed what she said. So he deposedthe empress and made Zhao Feiyan the empress. The emperor also sentfor Ban to blame her for cursing him. Ban pleaded herself, saying,“Your Majesty, your humble concubine heard that life and death,wealth and nobleness are all fated by Heaven. If there are deities,they know everything. They won't grant the wish of anyone who curseshis master. If there are no deities, what is the use to curse? So Iwon't do anything like curse,” The emperor thought that she wasright and did not punish her. On the contrary, he gave her a hundredcatties of gold as a reward.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Ban knew that shewas in danger, and offered to live with the empress dowager and waiton her. She died there. She had written a poem “Gauze Fan”. Thefan at that time was composed of a round frame of wood or bamboo,with a piece of gauze fixed on it.

His son succeeded to the throne, and wasEmperor Zhao, who was then only eight years of age. Therefore, allcourtiers decided that Princess Eyi should move and live in thepalace to take care of the boy emperor. Princess Eyi (117—80 BC)was the daughter of emperor Wu and big sister of the present emperor.The father and the grandfather of Xiaomei both went to the palace tobefriend Princess Eyi. When the emperor was twelve, he reached theage to have a wife. The father of Xiaomei wished his daughter to bethe empress. She was then only six. As she was so young, her maternalgrandfather, Great general Huo Guang, did not consent. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Princess Eyi had alover called Ding Wairen (?--80 BC). When the husband of Princess Eyidied, she found him, who was an acquaintance of her son. Then thefather of Xiaomei went to see Ding and asked him to persuade PrincessEyi to let his daughter be the empress, promising that Ding would begiven an official title when his daughter became the empress. So Dingwent to see Princess Eyi and made the request. Princess Eyi agreedand in 83 BC, Xiaomei was made the empress, the youngest empress inthe history of China. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] To keep the promiseto Ding, the father and the grandfather of Xiaomei both went to seegreat general Huo Guang to ask him give Ding a title. But Huo Guangrejected. So the father and the grandfather, and also Princess Eyihad a grudge against Huo Guang. They plotted to kill him, but HuoGuang learned their scheme and sent troopers in his control andkilled the father and the grandfather and Ding. Princess Eyi madesuicide. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] EmpressXiaomei was then only eight years old. She knew nothing about the[/FONT][FONT=Times New Roman, serif]coupd'état and so she was safe. Besides, she was the granddaughter ofHuo Guang. When she was grown up, she did not bear any children forthe emperor. When Emperor Zhao died in 74 BC, as he did not have ason, Huo Guang and courtiers decided that Prince Changyi, a grandsonof Emperor Wu, should be the new emperor, and Xiaomei be the youngestempress dowager. But Prince Changyi was a lewd man and disappointedHuo Guang and courtiers. After twenty-seven days, he was deposed.Then after serious discussion, they made Liu Xun, the great grandsonof Emperor Wu, be the emperor, Emperor Xuan (91—48 BC). Accordingto Chinese generation sequence, Xiaomei, the present empress dowager,should be the great grandmother of the new emperor. So she was nowthe grand empress dowager. She was at the time only fifteen yearsold, the youngest grand empress dowager in the history. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] The wife of greatgeneral Huo Guang poisoned the wife of Emperor Xuan, the legalempress, with the intention to marry her daughter to the emperor andto be the empress. In the third moon of 68 BC, the great general Huo Guang died. Both the grand empress dowager and the emperor attendedthe funeral, a great honor to the diseased. But in the fourth moon of67 BC, the Huo family members rebelled and were conquered. As thegrand empress dowager, though she was the granddaughter of Huo Guang,did not even know the rebellion, her position as grand empressdowager was not affected till she died at the age of fifty-two. Shewas buried with her husband, Emperor Zhao. It was the tradition inthe feudal China.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]18.Wang Zhaojun (the second beauty of the four beauties)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif]WangZhaojun (52—19 BC) was one of the four beauties, the second beautyin the sequence of the year. She was a great beauty at the time, butwith a bitter destiny. She was clever, and could read and paint. Shecould also play lute and chess. In the spring of 36 BC, when she wasseventeen, Emperor Yuan (75—33 BC) gave the edict to selectbeautiful girls and sent to the palace. He would choose the mostbeautiful ones among them to be his concubines, and the rest of themwould be the maids. As there were so many girls, the emperor was busyand could not see every girl himself. Therefore, he ordered thepalace painter Mao Yanshou to draw a portrait of each of them andpresented them to the emperor. It meant that the emperor would choosefrom portraits.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Almost every girlbribed the painter and asked him to draw her a bit prettier than shereally was. But Wang Zhaojun did not bribe him as she was soconfident of her beauty. So the painter drew her with a bit ofcontortion. As a result, she was not selected. She did not have anychance to see the emperor for three years. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] Han dynasty sinceestablishment was in continual war with a northern minority calledXiongnu tribe. The chieftain of the tribe, Uhaanyehe by name (58—31BC), at that time was weary of war and wanted peace for his people.Therefore, Chieftain Uhaanyehe came to the capital ChangAn city tosee the emperor. He requested to have some girl in the palace to behis wife so that the relationship between him and the emperor wouldbe close as relatives, and then there would thus have long peace forthe two peoples. The emperor liked the idea. When the emperor wasconsidering who would be chosen as the wife of the chieftain, WangZhaojun came forth, offering herself to be the one. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] At the feast heldfor the departure of the chieftain and his chosen wife, Wang Zhaojunshould surely be present, fully attired. When the emperor saw such abeauty, he did regret letting her go. But he could not go back on hiswords in the presence of the chieftain while the chieftain was sohappy to have such a beauty for his wife. After the feast, thechieftain and Wang Zhaojun left the capital for the north to thehomeland of the Xiongnu tribe. Then the emperor found out the truthwhy he missed her. It was because the painter drew her with acontortion. So he had the painter beheaded. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Times New Roman, serif] The people ofXiongnu tribe welcomed Wang Zhaojun warmly and looked upon her as theguarantee of peace. But life for Zhaojun in the strange land washard. First, she was not used to such food she had never eatenbefore. Then the life style was also different to her as her formerlife style. In 31 BC, Chieftain Uhaanyehe died. He had a son whosucceeded to the position of chieftain. The son was the stepson ofWang Zhaojun. According to the tradition of Xiongnu tribe, the soncould marry his stepmother. So Wang Zhaojun became the wife of herstepson. She bore two daughters for him. In 20 BC, the stepson died.Wang Zhaojun became the widow. One year later, she died at the age ofthirty-three. She was buried in the southern suburb of the presentHohhot city, at the foot of a green mountain and by the Yellow River.Her tomb was called Green Tomb by people in later dynasties. [/FONT]"
