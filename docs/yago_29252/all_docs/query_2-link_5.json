        "text": "Sep 28, 2011 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nHuo Guang éå  (died 68 BCE), courtesy name Zimeng å­å­, was a powerful official of the mid-Former Han period åæ¼¢ (206 BCE-8 CE). He was a half-brother of general Huo Qubing éå»ç and was appointed court gentleman (lang é).\n\nAfter the death of Huo Qubing he was promoted to Commandant-in-chief of the chariots (fengche duwei å¥è»é½å°) and Grand Master for Splendid Happiness (guanglu dafu å ç¥¿å¤§å¤«). Emperor Wu æ¼¢æ­¦å¸ (r. 141-87 BCE) highly estimated him as a careful and responbible court official. In 87 BCE the Emperor was severely sick and appointed Prince Liu Fuling åå¼éµ as heir apparent. Huo Guang was appointed General-in-chief serving as Commander-in-chief (da sima da jiangjun å¤§å¸é¦¬å¤§å°è») and became one of the four regents to support the young prince (Emperor Zhao æ¼¢æ­å¸, r. 87-74 BCE). The other regents were Jin Midi éæ¥ç£¾, Shangguan Jie ä¸å®æ¡ and Sang Hongyang æ¡å¼ç¾.\n\nIn his position as General-in-chief, Huo Guang was master of the Imperial Secretariat (shangshu å°æ¸) and the ministries. In 85 BCE he was given the title of Marquis of Bolu åé¸ä¾¯. His daughter was married to Shangguan An ä¸å®å®, the son of Shangguan Jie, and the daughter springing off this marriage was made Empress in 83 BCE ä¸å®å® (Empress Shangguan ä¸å®å). The family of the Shangguans used this position to line the pockets of their friends and relatives, a circumstance that resulted in growing tensions with Huo Guang who vehemently contradicted the bestowment of titles of nobility to Shangguans' favourites.\n\nThe relation with Sang Hongyang who controlled the bureaus of the state monopoly on the merchandise of salt and iron also became worse. At that point of time (80 BCE) the Shangguans and Sang Hongyang secretly planned to kill Huo Guang and to replace Emperor Zhao with Liu Dan åæ¦, Prince of Yan ç. Yet their plot was reveiled and Sang Hongyang and the Shangguans were exectued. Prince Dan and Empress Shangguan committed suicide.\n\nFrom that time on Huo Guang was the undisputed master of the court. His son Huo Yu éç¦¹, his nephews Huo Yun éé² and Huo Shan éå±±, the sons-in-law and other relatives were given high posts in the military structure of the imperial administration. The reign of Emperor Zhao, guided by Huo Guang, was characterised by a politics of relaxation. After decades of activity Emperor Wu had gone back to the political style of his predecessors. Taxes were lowers, expenditure was cut, corvÃ©e labour was sparingly required. In 81 BCE the court convoked scholars from throughout the empire to discuss the pending question of the state monopoly. The result of this discussion was that the tax on liquors was dropped, as well as the required delivery of a certain amount of horses by all communities.\n\nThe period of war with the steppe federation of the Xiongnu åå¥´ was also finished, and the court went back to the appeasement politics by presenting the wild tribes with silks and the khan with a princess (heqin åè¦ª \"peace by marriage\").\n\nIn 74 BCE Emperor Zhao died without heir. According to the wish of the Empress Dowager, Liu He åè³, Prince of Changyi æé, was made the new emperor, as a grandson of late Emperor Wu. Yet the arrogant and frivolous behaviour of the Prince caused his demotion, and the high ministers invited Liu Xun åè©¢, Prince Wei è¡å¤ªå­, who was also a grandson of Emperor Wu, to mount the throne (Emperor Xuan æ¼¢å®£å¸, r. 74-49 BCE). Huo Guang was still regent for the Emperor when he died, after twenty years of almost unchallenged reign.\n\nHuo Guang was the first kinsman of an empress (waiqi å¤æ) who wielded greatest power at the court. It was he who eclipsed the status of the Counsellor-in-chief (chengxiang ä¸ç¸) and transformed this once important office into a mere nominal post without any power. Huo Yu and Huo Shan occupied high posts and enjoyed luxury and status.\n\nThe decline of the family Huo began with the murder of Empress Xu è¨±çå by Huo Guang's wife. Emperor Xuan took first measures to curtail the power of the Huos. On their side, a secret plan was made to depose Emperor Xuan and to replace him with Huo Yu. This would have been the end of the dynasty. Yet the plan was reveiled, Huo Yun and Huo Shan committed suicide, and Huo Yu was executed by being cut into two halves at the waist (yaozhan è °æ¬) on the market place. The rest of the family Huo was extinguished.\n\nSource:"
