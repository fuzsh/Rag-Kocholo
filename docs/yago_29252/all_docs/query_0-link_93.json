        "text": "Yang Guifei (719 — 756), named Yang Yuhuan, Taoist Name Taizhen, respected as Lady Yang, was one of the Four Beauties in the history of China.\n\n​\n\nNo one knows her heart and real intention, but she had married the two most powerful men of that period.\n\n​\n\nHer second husband, Li Longji (685 — 762), the Emperor Xuanzong of Tang or Tang Ming Huang, was a controversial monarch of the Tang Dynasty who brought his people one of the most prosperous eras and one of the most destructive civil wars, the An-Shi Rebellion (755 — 763).\n\n​\n\nThis huge political failure, however, had been frequently blamed on Yang Guifei, a gorgeous and intelligent woman.\n\n​\n\nHer attractive appearance and exceptional talent brought her admiration, honorable status, countless treasures, and an extremely luxurious life.\n\nHowever, she could never control her fate and was forced to sacrifice for other people’s mistakes.\n\nBeautiful Highborn Girl and Her Happy Marriage with Prince\n\n​\n\nYang Yuhuan was born into a noble family and was beautiful, talented, and well-educated.\n\nAfter her father passed away, she was raised by her uncle.\n\n​\n\nOne day, when Yang was attending a princess’s wedding, she met a prince who fell in love with her at first sight.\n\n​\n\nThis prince, Li Mao, was the 18th son of the current emperor, and his mother was the emperor’s favorite woman, Consort Wu or Lady Wu.\n\nConsort Wu, the grandniece of Empress Wu Zetian, was brilliant and beautiful.\n\nShe framed up the current crown prince and the other two princes, allied with the prime minister, and tried to persuade the emperor to nominate Li Mao as the new crown prince.\n\n​\n\nLi Mao told his mother about the girl he met and fell in love with. Soon, with his parents' blessing, he married beautiful Yang Yuhuan.\n\n​\n\nA ravishing girl marrying a young man who fell in love with her at first sight, and who was also the potential crown prince of the empire, was supposed to be a sweet love story.\n\nYang's Separation from the Prince\n\n​\n\nUnfortunately, a few years later, Consort Wu passed away.\n\nThe emperor Li Longji, who had a few dozen beautiful imperial concubines in his palace, with over 60 documented kids, felt very sad and found no one around was attractive enough for him.\n\n​\n\nLater, when the emperor saw Yang Yuhuan at a royal family banquet, he lost himself when he laid eyes on her.\n\n​\n\nSoon, the emperor commanded Yang, his daughter-in-law, to leave her husband and practice Taoism at an imperial temple.\n\nSince then, she was given the Taoist name Taizhen.\n\nThen, the emperor assigned another noble girl to his son, Prince Li Mao, and commanded them to get married soon.\n\nMeanwhile, he nominated another son as the new crown prince.\n\n​\n\nWithin a few years, Prince Li Mao lost his mother, his beloved wife, and his father’s love and trust, probably the potentiality of being the heir.\n\n​\n\nSince then, he had lived like other princes: married the woman his father assigned, had a few kids, and then passed away old and sick.\n\nBeing the Favorite Consort of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang\n\n​\n\nAfter Li Mao was married again, Emperor Li Longji soon awarded Yang as his consort, and they have lived together since then.\n\nShe became the most honored woman in the empire, the Consort Yang or Yang Guifei.\n\n​\n\nThe emperor treated her very well. Except for the queen’s title, he gave almost everything he could to her.\n\n​\n\nLi Longji and Yang were all excellent musicians; together, they created many masterpieces that were very influential in traditional Chinese Music history.\n\nYang, however, seemed not to treat him as just an emperor.\n\nShe still would be jealous and even argue with him sometimes, which was quite rare in a feudal empire in history.\n\n​\n\nHence, she was sent out of the royal palace twice for disrespecting the emperor.\n\nBut every time, Li Longji would miss her and welcome her back soon.\n\n​\n\nThe way Li Longji got Yang was not decent, plus Yang never got pregnant, which made her not qualified to wear the queen’s crown.\n\n​\n\nBut in the royal palace, everyone treated and respected her as the real empress.\n\nThe Powerful and Incapable House of Yang\n\n​\n\nSoon, Yang Guifei’s three sisters were rewarded honorable titles and plenty of treasures and money.\n\nThey obtained more and more power, and most imperial consorts and honorable princesses had to show them respect and compliance.\n\n​\n\nDespite their arrogance and disrespect to royal members, and they had done many things that crossed the line, the emperor never blamed them.\n\nAs long as beautiful Yang Guifei was happy, there was nothing to complain about.\n\nHer cousin Yang Guozhong was originally an incapable and ordinary official. It’s unclear whether Yang Guifei required the emperor to promote him, but Yang Guozhong gained many chances to get close to pleasing the emperor.\n\n​\n\nSoon, Yang Guozhong got promoted to the prime minister of Tang.\n\n​\n\nUnlike Queen Wei Zifu of the Han Dynasty (202 BC — 220 AD), whose family made significant contributions to their country but remained modest, Yang and her relatives mostly lived a life of luxury and arrogance.\n\n​\n\nMoreover, Yang Guozhong frequently abused his power and caused a massive loss to the empire.\n\nHe kept promoting officials close to him and insisted on initiating two failed wars against the Nanzhao Kingdom (738 — 902), which weakened Tang’s military strength.\n\n​\n\nAt the same time, however, the emperor was enjoying life with Yang.\n\nThe Destructive An-Shi Rebellion\n\n​\n\nIn the year 755, two strong warlords garrisoning the borders initiated a rebellion in the name of eliminating Yang Guozhong’s treacherous, unjust governance.\n\n​\n\nThis was one of the most destructive wars in ancient China, the An-Shi Rebellion.\n\n​\n\nIronically, the leader warlord An Lushan had been one of the emperor’s favorite generals and had been respecting Yang Guifei as his adoptive mother.\n\n​\n\nEmperor Li Longji was a brave and brilliant monarch when he was younger, who nominated many intelligent officials and led his empire to reach one of the most prosperous eras in the history of China.\n\n​\n\nWhen this war erupted, he was already 70 years old. In the beginning, he still could make the right decisions; however, he soon listened to Yang Guozhong’s stupid suggestions and caused a massive failure for Tang’s army.\n\nControversial Mutiny Targeting the House of Yang\n\n​\n\nWhen other forces of Tang kept fighting against the rebel army, the emperor and his imperial guards arrived at a place named Ma Wei Po.\n\n​\n\nThey lacked resources and suffered from anger, shame, and sadness.\n\n​\n\nBecause the emperor decided to escape in a hurry, most of those soldiers' families were left behind in the capital city, which was now under the control of the rebel army.\n\n​\n\nA few months earlier, they were still honorable imperial guards of the most prosperous empire.\n\nSuddenly, they were forced to abandon their homes, lose contact with their families, endure danger and starvation, and flee with little dignity, all while witnessing the plight of other homeless refugees along the road.\n\nSacrificing Yang Guifei Due to the Faults of Others\n\n​\n\nThe emperor chose to protect himself.\n\n​\n\nThen, Yang Guifei died.\n\n​\n\nThe place and time of her death were clear, but the actual way was still unknown.\n\n​\n\nSome said she committed suicide, swallowed gold, was strangled, or hacked by many people out of chaos.\n\n​\n\nBut it was clear that this was completed under the emperor's command.\n\nAfterward, those imperial guards continued protecting the emperor and arrived at a safe city in the southwest.\n\n​\n\nThe crown prince Li Heng (711 — 762) didn't want to keep escaping.\n\nHe decided to lead Tang's army and fight, so he left the emperor and marched northward to the battlefield.\n\n​\n\nEight years later, the Tang's army finally won and took back their lost lands and capital city Chang'an under the commands of the crown prince and exceptional generals such as Guo Ziyi, Yan Zhenqing, and Zhang Xun.\n\nDilemma and Sympathy of Yang Guifei\n\n​\n\nThere was no evidence that Yang Guifei had ever intervened in political decisions or participated in any factional political struggles.\n\nBesides her jealousy sometimes, she was a kind person and a sweet consort.\n\n​\n\nShe was beautiful enough to let a prince and an emperor fall in love with her at first sight and talented enough to be respected as one of the most excellent musicians and dancers in the history of China.\n\n​\n\nHowever, she did take the blame for the colossal decline and destruction that her husband and brother had caused at the expense of her own life.\n\nAfterward, she was frequently mentioned in poems and literature, but mostly with sympathy.\n\n​\n\nSome of them eulogized her beauty, talent, and love story with emperor Li Longji; the most famous one is \"Song of Everlasting Sorrow\" or \"Chang Hen Ge\" by great poet Bai Juyi (772 — 846).\n\nOthers, however, wondered if the emperor ever truly loved her."
