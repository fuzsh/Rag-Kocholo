        "text": "Tibetan sources state that in 698/699 CE the Tibetan emperor Khri ‘Dus srong put an end to the hegemony of the mGar clan, which had been de facto ruling over the Eastern part of the Tibetan Empire during the second part of the seventh century. While some members of the mGar clan committed suicide to escape the emperor’s purge, some others fled to China and sought shelter at Wu Zetian’s court. Khri 'Dus srong's suppression is usually presented as the end of one of the most influential clans of the Tibetan Empire. However, little has been said about what happened to the mGar who went to the Chinese court or about the clan’s subsequent fate in China. This preliminary prosopographic research traces the history of this branch of the mGar clan from the flight to the Tang at the end of the 7th century up to the second part of the ninth century, through the study of three Chinese funerary inscriptions. The material of these epigraphic documents, along with their content, vocabulary and style, reveal that through marriages with Chinese aristocrats and the procurement of official charges and titles, the mGar evolved and prospered throughout the Tang dynasty. The analysis of these documents proves that some members of the mGar clan continued to play a relevant role at the Tang court, and eventually the family was absorbed by the Chinese system and completely Sinicized.\n\nFunerary stelae and entombed epitaphs were mortuary objects used in early and early middle periods (ca. 2nd-10th centuries CE) in China to commemorate and communicate the life and death of an individual situated in a web of social relations. They were integral to the mortuary space—physically constructed, ritually consecrated, and mentally demarcated—and relayed the identity of the deceased most effectively because they were inscribed. They shared a distinct textual format combining prose and elegy, but they had markedly different material and social lives. While establishing large-scale funerary stelae at the graveside gained sudden prominence among the Han elite in the second half of the 2nd century CE, their popularity was short-lived and they vanished from aboveground in the following century. In its place, freestanding miniaturized stelae began to appear inside the tomb. Around the same time in the 3rd century CE, flat-lying square-block epitaphs began to be interred in the tombs. Entombed epitaphs eventually became the standard funerary object for the social and political elite as well as the wealthy gentry and its use lasted into the Republican Era in the early 20th century. Both funerary stelae and entombed epitaphs were versatile objects designed to transcend time, but as historical artifacts, they were subject to social and political contingencies. The way their media and format changed reflects the shifting dynamics of the early and early middle periods in Chinese history.\n\nThe historiographical record of the Liao dynasty (907-1125) is limited due to the contingencies of manuscript survival, and so excavated epitaphs have come to be a vital primary source for study of Liao history. This thesis analyses the epitaphs of the Liao as a whole and considers the contingent social factors behind their production. This is done over four thematic chapters that roughly map onto four periods in the Liao where the themes are most apparent: geography, culture and the tenth century; territorial reforms, the expansion of the imperial examinations and the early-to-mid eleventh century; genealogy, the Kitan aristocracy and the mid-to-late eleventh century; and court politics, historiography and the late Liao (1085-1125). Taken together these themes explain the increased production of epitaphs over the course of the dynasty and in different regions of the empire. I argue that epitaphs were not a cultural signifier of ethnic categories but a medium through which people not only commemorated the dead, but also signalled their status to others. It is this function of epitaphs as texts that could influence others perceptions that explains the growing demand for them against the backdrop of the changing social structures.\n\nThough various divinatory practices were central to all burial arrangements in Tang China, scholars have paid scant attention to these practices and their social context and effects. This article reconstructs burial divination practices, discusses their ritual and social functions, and examines the social attitudes that influenced and were in turn influenced by them. Focus is on the following questions: why and how did families perform burial divinations? How were the divinatory oracles interpreted, and by whom? Why and to what extent did families subject themselves to these oracles? And what does the practice of burial divinations tell us about the culture of remembrance in Tang China? The article proposes answers to these questions through reading muzhiming (entombed epitaphs) against other transmitted and excavated sources and examining one common, but rarely studied, effect of divination practices on burials: their being rushed or much-delayed. Finally, the article examines a case involving both expedited and postponed burials and reconstructs Tang interpretations and responses to negative oracles in efforts to (re-)create memory."
