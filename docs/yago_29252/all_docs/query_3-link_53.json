        "text": "Princess Taiping (? — 713) was the youngest daughter of Emperor Gaozong of Tang (628 — 683) and Wu Zetian (624 — 705), the only female emperor in Chinese history.\n\n​\n\nShe was deeply loved by her powerful parents and later, willingly or forced, participated in many important political fights that influenced the empire significantly.\n\n​\n\nIn many documents, she was portrayed as ambitious, aggressive, and obsessed with power, just like her mother.\n\n​\n\nHowever, despite her honorable status and paramount power, she failed to protect all the loved people she wanted to protect.\n\nPerfect and Honorable Early Life of Princess Taiping\n\n​\n\nAs Emperor Gaozong's youngest daughter, and queen Wu Zetian's only daughter (Wu's first daughter died only a few months after birth), Taiping was deeply loved by her parents.\n\n​\n\nAfter Wu's mother passed away, she asked her beloved little daughter to pray.\n\n​\n\nTaiping was the Taoist nun name for this little princess.\n\n​\n\nWhen the king of Tufan pleaded to marry Taiping, her parents immediately built the grand Taiping Temple in the royal palace for her to practice and rejected this marriage plea.\n\nA few years later, Taiping implied that she was old enough to get married; then her father chose a noble and excellent husband named Xue Shao (661 — 689), the youngest son of Emperor Gaozong's sister.\n\n​\n\nTaiping and Xue's wedding was staggeringly luxurious and fabulous, and their marriage was happy and perfect.\n\n​\n\nIn 7 years of their happy married life, they had two boys and two girls.\n\nAbrupt and Significant Changes in the Royal Family\n\n​\n\nTwo years after their marriage, Taiping's father passed away.\n\n​\n\nHer third brother Li Xian ascended to the throne (her first brother died young, and the second brother displeased Wu and was forced to commit suicide) and was abolished by Wu less than two months after the enthronement.\n\n​\n\nThen Wu supported her fourth son Li Dan (also Taiping's fourth brother) to be a puppet emperor, later planning to abolish him and be the first female emperor.\n\n​\n\nDuring this period, some royals and officials strongly opposed her and rebelled, and Xue's big brother also participated.\n\n​\n\nAfter Wu defeated their rebellion, Xue's family members were all executed.\n\nXue Shao didn't participate in this rebellion, and Taiping was pregnant with their youngest child, but Wu didn't spare his life.\n\n​\n\nXue was caned 100 times and later starved to death in prison.\n\n​\n\nNo one knows what Taiping experienced during that time or what she felt about these tragedies.\n\n​\n\nBut it became apparent that she had started to participate in politics and seek power.\n\nSecond Marriage as A Political Alliance\n\n​\n\nA few months after Xue died, Wu Zetian started to find a new husband for Taiping.\n\n​\n\nThis new husband, however, could only be a man of the House of Wu.\n\n​\n\nWu planned to marry her close nephew, whom she once wanted to nominate as her heir, to Princess Taiping. That way, Taiping would be the queen later.\n\n​\n\nBut Taiping refused; another saying was that this nephew got sick around that time.\n\n​\n\nOn the contrary, Taiping chose another man from the House of Wu, who was well-behaved and had never been involved in politics, but he was already married.\n\n​\n\nWu agreed, executed this man's wife, and held a grand wedding ceremony for them.\n\nIndulgent Life and Political Awareness of Princess Taiping\n\n​\n\nUnlike in her first marriage, Princess Taiping acted differently in her second marriage.\n\n​\n\nShe lived a very luxurious life, had affairs with officials, and kept many male lovers.\n\n​\n\nIf she found someone extremely good at serving women, she would contribute them to her mother, Wu, who was enthroned as the first and only female emperor in the history of China a few months after Taiping's second wedding.\n\n​\n\nEmperor Wu mentioned many times that Taiping's appearance and personality were quite like hers, so she always would talk to Taiping about political affairs.\n\n​\n\nTaiping, on the contrary, showed enough care and talent but never revealed any ambition in obtaining power or manipulating politics in front of her mother.\n\n​\n\nHowever, through years of observation and conversations with Emperor Wu Zetian and her trusted prime minister Shangguan Wan'er, Taiping undoubtedly gleaned valuable insights from the best.\n\nCounterattack and Intense Coups\n\n​\n\nIn some historical documents, Taiping was recorded as a woman obsessed with power and great at political schemes.\n\nMainly because of some influential coups that she was involved in.\n\n​\n\nIn 697, an official tried to collect evidence and accuse Taiping and some kings from the House of Wu of planning to rebel.\n\nSo Taiping allied those kings and Wu's two favorite male lovers (including the one Taiping contributed to), counterattacked that powerful official, and had Wu execute him.\n\nIn the next few years, these two male lovers kept expanding power and framed and executed some people, including Taiping's third brother's son and daughter and Taiping's lover.\n\n​\n\nThen, in 705, some officials allied with Wu's three living children, Taiping, and her two brothers, initiated a coup to ask Wu to give the throne back to Li Xian.\n\n​\n\nA few months later, Wu passed away.\n\nTaiping redressed her first husband Xue's name, migrated his grave, and properly buried him in her family graveyard.\n\nNew Threats and Enemies of Princess Taiping\n\n​\n\nLi Xian, the third brother of Princess Taiping, was enthroned as Emperor Zhongzong and trusted her with more power.\n\n​\n\nLi Xian certainly liked his little sister and was grateful for Taiping's contributions in eliminating Wu's lovers, revenging his wrongfully executed children, and supporting him to be the emperor.\n\n​\n\nHowever, Li Xian also loved his queen and daughter, now Empress Wei and Princess Anle, who were also ambitious.\n\nThey were not satisfied with being the empress and princess; Anle wanted to be the heir of the empire, modeled by Wu Zetian.\n\n​\n\nTherefore, the only daughter, who looked and behaved like Wu Zetian, became a big obstacle and threat.\n\nEmperor Li Xian tried his best to balance the forces from different sides.\n\n​\n\nWhen his favorite daughter Anle tried to frame Taiping and his younger brother under the name of the rebel, he didn't believe nor blame them.\n\n​\n\nLi Xian's trusted female prime minister Shangguan Wan'er later joined Taiping's side.\n\nMany people also believe that she had been supporting Taiping secretly the whole time.\n\n​\n\nEither way, Taiping stayed safe and powerful and lived her luxurious, indulgent life during her third brother's reign.\n\nGaining and Losing Following a Successful Coup\n\n​\n\nLater Li Xian died suddenly; some said that Empress Wei and Princess Anle poisoned him to death after he refused to nominate Anle as the legit heir.\n\n​\n\nEmpress Wei and Princess Anle then started to seize centralized power. Some officials suggested they enthrone the female emperor and the heir while eliminating other royals that may threaten them.\n\n​\n\nThe biggest threats are Wu Zetian's two remaining children, Princess Taiping and her fourth brother Li Dan.\n\nFights and Death of Princess Taiping\n\n​\n\nContention between Taiping and Li Longji became more and more intense.\n\n​\n\nSeveral times, Taiping tried to persuade or trick her brother into nominating another son as the crown prince, but it didn't work out.\n\n​\n\nTwo years later, to correspond to a unique celestial phenomenon, her brother Li Dan resigned and gave the throne to Li Longji.\n\n​\n\nTaiping paced up her plan to abolish Li Longji from the crown.\n\n​\n\nBut Li Longji heard and attacked first. He and his supporters ambushed and killed most of Taiping's supporters, including many talented officials and generals.\n\n​\n\nThen he commanded Taiping to suicide.\n\n​\n\nLi Dan finally realized his son's ambition and firmness, gave up all his remaining power, and fully retired.\n\n​\n\nExcept for one son who had been supporting Li Longji, the rest of Taiping's children were executed.\n\nIt's unclear whether Taiping had any desire for politics and authority, but her powerful parents, noble origin, talent, and personality brought her countless wealth and honor, as well as threats and enemies.\n\n​\n\nTaiping had contributed significantly to gaining the throne back to the House of Li and gained paramount power through those coups.\n\nHowever, in most conditions, she fought to counterattack and protect herself.\n\n​\n\nShe was very powerful and intelligent, but she couldn't protect the people she wanted to, including her beloved first husband, her great friend Shangguan Wan'er, her children, and ultimately herself.\n\n​\n\nShe had controlled many people's lives and the politics of the empire, but it also seemed that most of the time, she had few choices."
