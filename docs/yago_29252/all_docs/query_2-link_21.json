        "text": "This article inquires into the ideological circumstances behind Wang Mang's 王莽 seizure of power, to examine how he built legitimacy at every stage of his career, by establishing a political and symbolic continuum between the role of the minister and that of the sovereign, rather than suddenly wresting power from the Liu clan. His classical learning in general and his references to Zhougong 周公 in particular were fundamental to the success of the process, which took place in three important stages: first, the offering of a white pheasant to the court; second, the bestowal of “Nine Conferrals” 九錫, and third, the composition of “Wang Mang's declaration” 莽誥. However, although the Classics constituted common references for Wang Mang and the scholars supporting him, the Classics were also used by some opponents objecting to the concentration of power in the hands of Wang Mang.\n\n3. Han shu 漢書 (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1962), 99A.4093: “This year [8 c.e.] the Marquis of Guangrao, Liu Jing, Battalion Commander to the General of Chariots and Cavalry Hu Yun, and a subordinate under the Senior Tutor, Zhang Hong, presented memorials reporting more divine omens.” See Clyde B. Sargent, Wang Mang: A Translation of the Official Account of His Rise to Power as Given in the History of the Former Han Dynasty (Shanghai: Graphic Art Book Company, 1947), 173 (mod.). NB: in all citations of earlier works, Wade-Giles has been changed to pinyin, for consistency.\n\n4. For a collective reflection about the role played by one particular Classic, the Zhou li 周禮, in government conception and organization in East Asia, see Elman, Benjamin A. and Kern, Martin, eds., Statecraft and Classical Learning: The Rituals of Zhou in East Asian Society (Leiden: Brill, 2010)CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Michael Puett’s chapter in that book, “Centering the Realm: Wang Mang, the Zhouli, and Early Chinese Statecraft,” 129–54, deals with the use of the Zhou li as an effort to centralize the Han. Here I focus more on the rhetorical uses of the Documents classic as it relates to Wang Mang’s rise to power.\n\n7. See especially the debate between Hans Bielenstein and Yü Ying-shih. According to Bielenstein, the direct cause for Wang Mang’s fall was not the failure of his ambitious reforms but a series of natural disasters, particularly the successive floods of the Yellow River. See Hans Bielenstein, “The Restoration of the Han Dynasty, with Prolegomena on the Historiography of the Hou Han shu,” Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities 26.1 (1954), 1–209, esp. 150. According to Yü, Wang Mang’s reforms were the main cause for his downfall, since they deprived him of the vital support of the most powerful families (which he seems to equate with the classicists) who had brought him to power. See Yü Ying-shih 余英時, “Dong Han zhengquan zhi jianli yu shizu daxing zhi guanxi” 東漢政權之建立與士族大姓之關係, Xinya xuebao 新亞學報 2 (1965), 216–47.\n\n10. In his Xinlun 新論, Huan Tan gives various reasons that contributed to the fall of Wang Mang’s dynasty. Among them are his very solitary exercise of power and his fondness for omens. See Timoteus Pokora, Hsin-lun (New Treatise) and Other Writings by Huan T’an (43 B.C.–28 A.D.) (Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, 1975), 10, 25–27, 30–31, 45–50. Huan Tan does not mention the great support by the classicists during Wang Mang’s accession to power, nor does he mention Wang Mang’s public emulation of Zhougong. For a contemporaneous accusation, see also the “pamphlet” published by Wei Ao 隗囂 (d. 33 c.e.) and his group during the last rebellion against Wang Mang. This pamphlet, which is referred to in Han shu 99C.4187 and quoted in extenso in the Hou Han shu 後漢書 (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1965), 13.515, focuses on two main accusations, the regicide and the forgery of omens. See Bielenstein, “The Restoration of the Han Dynasty,” 124: “The former Marquis of Xindu, Wang Mang, has treated rudely and insulted Heaven and Earth, acted contrary to principles, and opposed order. He poisoned and killed Emperor Ping and snatched away his throne. He pretended to have received the mandate of Heaven and forged writings about verifications [of his receipt of the mandate by auspicious omens]. He cheated and misled the masses and aroused to anger the Lord on High. He turned and twisted ornamental expressions in order to fabricate auspicious omens. He made game of the Spirits of Heaven and Earth and praised misfortunes and calamities in song. The bamboos of Ch’u and Yüe are not sufficient to write down his wickedness” (trans. Bielenstein).\n\n22. Empress Lü 呂雉 (d. 180) took control of imperial power after Gaozu’s death and elevated to the rank of king a number of men of her own clan while eliminating kings of the Liu clan and old companions of Gaozu. Huo Guang 霍光 (d. 68) was an important adviser to Emperor Wu who was appointed regent of his young successor, the future Emperor Zhao. Huo managed to have both a daughter and a granddaughter married to emperors, and he exerted control over the imperial succession. After his death, his family, suspected of entertaining imperial ambitions, was destroyed.\n\n31. Xunzi jijie 荀子集解 (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1988), 115–16. Knoblock’s translation proposes a very different reading: “Since he (Zhougong) formerly had the empire and he now no longer held it, his actions did not constitute a ‘usurpation.’ King Cheng formerly had no empire, whereas now he had an empire; hence the Duke’s actions had not constituted a ‘seizure of power.’” See Knoblock, John, Xunzi: A Translation and Study of the Complete Works (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994), vol. 2, 69Google Scholar. I follow Eric Hutton, Xunzi: The Complete Text (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014), p. 53, and the commentator Yang Jing 楊倞 who remarks here: “Shan 擅 means shan 禪. The sentence thus means that Zhougong did not abdicate to King Cheng” 擅與禪同。言非禪讓與成王也.\n\n32. On the ancient notion of abdication in favor of a virtuous minister, see Angus C. Graham, Disputers of the Tao: Philosophical Argument in Ancient China (La Salle, IL: Open Court Press, 1989), 292–99. The understanding we have of this notion during the pre-imperial period has been deeply transformed by the discovering of a new set of manuscript texts from the ancient state of Chu, in which the theme of abdication is of particular importance: see Sarah Allan, Buried Ideas: Legends of Abdication and Ideal Government in Early Chinese Bamboo-Slip Manuscripts (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2015).\n\n42. The number twelve is symbolic of a full totality, as the memorial itself (Han shu, 99A.4060) points out: “All these deeds were rarely seen in the past, and even Yu the Great and Hou Ji (Shun’s minister) would have found them difficult to accomplish, and yet the Duke [Protector of Han, Wang Mang] has accomplished them in their totality, with an unique and pervasive principle [一以貫之]. This is full completion indeed!”\n\n47. Son of Zhai Fangjin 翟方進, an important statesman and classicist, Zhai Yi was the first to accuse Wang Mang of having murdered Emperor Ping. According to his biography in the Han shu, he was well aware that the regency of Wang Mang was only the first step towards the overthrow of the dynasty and said so to his nephew (“He now uses the deeds of Zhougong when he was regent for King Cheng, in order to test reactions in the empire. He will necessarily overthrow the House of Han, we can already see the signs”). See Han shu, 84.3426.\n\n54. A descendant of Confucius and an important dignitary during the reigns of Emperors Cheng and Ai, Kong Guang gave crucial support to Wang Mang, but after 1 c.e., he seems to have been increasingly distant (Han shu, 81.3362–63). He left the court and died in 5 c.e. His father Kong Ba 孔霸, grandfather Kong Yannian 孔延年, and great-grandfather Kong Anguo 孔安國, were all eminent specialists of the Documents traditions. Kong Guang became Academician during the reign of Emperor Cheng, due to his deep knowledge of the Classics, as well as of Han institutions. He then became Imperial Counsellor (Yushi dafu), Chancellor (Chengxiang), and from 2 to 1 b.c.e., Grand Tutor (Taishi)."
