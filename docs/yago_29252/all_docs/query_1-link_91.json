        "text": "Shu Historical Information Location: Yizhou, capital at Chengdu Start: 221 End: 263 Major General(s): Guan Yu\n\nZhang Fei\n\nZhao Yun\n\nLiao Hua\n\nWang Ping Major Battle(s) Changbanpo\n\nChengdu\n\nHanzhong\n\nYiling\n\nWuzhangyuan\n\nShu (蜀), also known as Shu Han (蜀漢), is one of the three influential kingdoms in the Dynasty Warriors, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dynasty Tactics series, and Kessen II. In the Dynasty Warriors franchise, the kingdom is symbolized by the color green and a Chinese dragon as a reference to Qinglong. Shu is sometimes symbolized by peach blossoms, a reference to the Peach Garden Oath. Also in the Dynasty Warriors series as of the seventh installment, Shu is the faction that has the most playable characters.\n\nShu was ruled by Liu Bei, who spent his life in exile, eventually seizing the lands from his cousin Liu Zhang. Shu Han, consisting of Hanzhong and Jingzhou, was conquered by Wu in 219 A.D., and in 263 A.D., the kingdom fell due to political corruption and poor lands.\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms[]\n\nIn the historical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Novel), the kingdom of Shu faced numerous troubles and triumphs. Liu Bei, a prominent figure, joined forces against Zhang Jiao, the Yellow Turbans, and Dong Zhuo. He gained followers, including his future oath brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. Liu Bei visited hermit Zhuge Liang three times, and he gained lands from relatives. In 208, Zhuge Liang allied with Wu to attack Wei, but their plan failed, leading to the burning of Wei's fleet. In 219, Lu Meng gained Jing land, and Guan Yu was executed, angering Liu Bei. In 220, Cao Pi seized the throne and declared the Wei Dynasty. Liu Bei proclaimed himself the new Han Emperor. After several battles, Liu Bei died of illness, and the Shu kingdom's rule was succeeded by Liu Shan. Jiang Wei, the last successor, attempted to invade the north but was killed. Liu Shan retired, becoming the Duke of Comfort.\n\nRulers[]\n\nLiu Bei (221 ~ 223 AD)\n\nLiu Shan (223 ~ 263 AD)\n\nOther Figures[]\n\nLiu Xiong - Liu Bei's grandfather, eventually became an imperial guard in Yanzhou.\n\nLiu Yuandi - Liu Bei's uncle, born in Yanjing, given name unknown.

The rank was seen as a prestige and fear-inducing honor.\n\nFour Heroes[]\n\nThe Four Heroes, or Four Ministers, are a circle of ministers accredited with stabilizing the Shu administration. They were all respected greatly, for the most part trusted by Liu Shan, and were relatively high-up in the civil hierarchy for their kingdom.

Adopted by Cao Teng. A modest character of restraint who valued piety, he rose in ranks to be Grand Commandant. Answered draft for the Yellow Turban Rebellion and went with his family to Xuzhou. After distinguishing Cao Cao to lead in his place, Cao Song decided to return home to Yanzhou. According to the Wushu, Tao Qian's subordinate Zhang Kai killed him during the journey.

His death caused Cao Cao to slump into a great depression. The timing of his death was ironic since Zhen Luo was being granted within the family, meaning that both a marriage and funeral ceremony were being held at once. In response Cao Cao said to Cao Pi, \"Cangshu's (Cao Chong's) death is a great misfortune to me, but you should rejoice. You are to be my true successor after all.\" When Cao Pi was made emperor, he remarked that he possibly could have never risen to his current state of power if Cao Chong were still alive.\n\nCao Yu - Cao Cao's ninth son, style name was Pengzu, married Zhang Lu's daughter, became Yan Wang (Prince Yan) in 225.

After Cao Cao accepted Bianshi, he once again offered for his wife to return to him. Learning about his new paramour and taking to hating her, she turned him down with spite.

In Dynasty Warriors and their other appearances, the country is symbolized by the color red as well as a tiger (especially with the Sun family's motif). In Kessen II and early Romance of the Three Kingdoms titles, they are symbolized by the color blue.\n\nIn Dynasty Warriors, the kingdom had the most playable characters as of the third installment. It was initially ruled by various governors in the south, but was conquered by the Sun family. The Sun family established their rule through family service and veteran talent. However, Sun Quan's unreasonable decisions led to tyranny under Sun Hao's rule, resulting in the deaths of Sun Luban and Sun Chen. This internal chaos never fully recovered.\n\nRulers[]\n\nSun Jian (posthumously)\n\nSun Ce (posthumously)\n\nSun Quan (222 ~ 252 AD)\n\nSun Liang (252 ~ 258 AD) - Sun Quan's youngest son\n\nSun Xiu (258 ~ 264 AD) - Sun Quan's sixth son\n\nSun Hao (264 ~ 280 AD) - Sun He's son\n\nOther Figures[]\n\nSun Qiang - Sun Jian's older brother, style name was Shengtai. All that is clearly known is that he lost his wife while he was still young and that his descendants went into royalty.\n\nSun Jing - Sun Jian's younger brother who helped his brother's campaigns.\n\nSun Yi - Sun Jian's third son.\n\nSun Kuang - Sun Jian's fourth son, style name was Jizuo. To quell the discontentments between Sun Quan and Cao Cao's forces following Sun Ce's passing, he married Cao Cao's niece. He had no other listed accomplishments, but his descendants were able to prosper. According to the Jiangbiao Zhuan, he made a grave error in the Battle of Dongkou. As punishment, he was deprived of the Sun name and sent to prison, which doubled as the spot where he died.\n\nSun Lang - Sun Jian's illegitimate son, mother unknown. Also known as Sun Ren, which became the given name for Lady Sun in Romance of the Three Kingdoms. When Cao Xiu advanced with troops into Dongkou, he and Lu Fan were able to drive back their invasion. At the same time, however, Sun Lang had accidentally set fire to ally war supplies. Sun Quan was greatly angered by the fault, banished him from royalty, and had him imprisoned. It is said that Sun Lang died while still in jail.\n\nSun Shao - Sun Ce's eldest son.\n\nSun Deng - Sun Quan's eldest son, crowned prince, style name was Zigao. Since his mother came from a poor background, he disciplined himself to be a wise and virtuous individual.

He became archery and study friends with great individuals, such as Zhuge Ke and Zhang Xiu. He helped nurse his father's spirit after Sun Lu's death. As thanks, Sun Quan began to revere Sun Deng's neglected mother. He eventually succumbed to illness at age 33, but not before he informed Sun He that he dearly loved his brothers and father.\n\nSun Lu - Sun Quan's second son, Zizhi, married Pan Jun's daughter.

Studied hard since he was young, was known to be courteous, and excelled in horse riding and archery. Also said to have liked gambling. However, he and Sun Ba were favored just as equally by his father. To counter his brother's aggressions and false claims, Sun He gathered a great deal of supporters to oppose his brother. Although he and his supporters apologized for the dispute, Sun Quan didn't accept their words. His father finally decided to end the conflict by separating them, demoting Sun He to a commoner's status to the indignity of his vassals. He was later driven to commit suicide by Sun Jun.\n\nSun Ba - Sun Quan's fourth son, crowned prince, style name was Ziwei. Had to ask twice for his crown, refused the first time by his father. He was favored in a manner that was similar to the other princes, which he and other generals resented. To counter Sun He's presence, he rallied a great deal of followers and caused a split between the followers of the realm. After eight years of wrongful executions and accusations, Sun Quan decided to end the conflict by separating the brothers. He ordered Sun Ba to commit suicide.\n\nSun Fen - Sun Quan's fifth son, style name was Ziyang. Mentored by Lu Dai, but was said to not have the most ideal behavior.
