        "text": "In Late Neolithic, civilisation had emerged in the plains of China's two vast river valleys. Through centuries of interregional trade and other interactions, various major local cultures there had developed pan-regional cultural traits as mentioned in the last chapter on Longshan city states. However, we have only rudimentary knowledge on the political, economic, and social systems and the conditions of these city states, major cultural traits of China's Bronze Age civilisation only became more visible from the Xia Dynasty (夏朝). They are in brief: (1) hereditary feudal dynasty, (2) rank orderliness of the king and feudal lords codified in ritual bronzes, (3) tributary relationship between the king and feudal lords, and (4) Zhongyuan became the core area of Chinese civilisation. Besides archeological finds, writings on oracle bones and bronzes of the Shang Dynasty (商朝) and detailed historical records and compilation of ancient official documents in the Zhou Dynasty (周朝) have informed us the events and general state affairs of the Xia Dynasty. The Shang and Zhou dynasties had also inherited and further strengthened the above cultural traits, transforming them into major values of the state and social norms and behaviour of society in China's Bronze Age. Thus, the three dynasties, i.e. Xia, Shang and Zhou (collectively called Sandai 三代, or the Three Dynasties), are known to be the foundation period for Chinese civilisation. b4148_Ch-04.indd 65 3/23/2021 2:44:47 PM b4148 Chinese History and Civilisation: An Urban Perspective 2nd Reading 9\"x6\"\n\nA detailed discussion and comparison of the two dynasties - Shang and Zhou - with reference to archaeological findings. Please note: If you are a student at any University, and you wish to cite my essay, do so prudently. It has not been published in any journal or paper, and will not be considered a properly peer-reviewed source by your teachers. Instead, I would advise you to bounce off my ideas; use them to deepen your own inquiries into the topic.\n\nThe present paper aims to reveal how the “western period” of the Zhou dynasty (1046/5-256 BCE) was remembered, forgotten, and later reconstructed from pieces of memory. By juxtaposing the data of epigraphic sources against reminiscences about of the past in received texts from several centuries up to the Western Han (206 BC – AD 9) period, it addresses the following questions: 1) How was the geopolitical constitution of the Zhou polity before 771 BC reflected in various literary texts: – in the Poetry and Documents Classics, possibly manifesting representations of the edge between the Western and Eastern Zhou periods; – in the Zuo zhuan, possibly reflecting representations of the Spring and Autumn period (770–403 BC); – in various texts of the Warring States period (403–221 BC)? 2) How was the early Zhou period remembered during the Western Han times and how were available memories about its “western period” selected, manipulated and integrated in Sima Qian’s Records of the Historiographer ? Surveying many sources of a heterogeneous nature and different origins, this paper makes some preliminary observations about alternative tendencies in the process of construction of the past in early China and tentatively discusses their possible political and social backgrounds.\n\nOver the centuries, China still respectfully treasures rich Asian cultures, traditions, and customs. China is now famous all over the world for its mysterious wonders and cultural & natural heritages such as the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Terracotta Army, etc. The Chinese history is full with the exposition of outstanding features of Chinese culture such as great thoughts of Confucius, religious beliefs, traditional festivals and customs e.g., Chinese new year, language and calligraphy e.g., Shu Fa, four great inventions of ancient China e.g., papermaking, printing, gunpowder and the compass, traditional architecture and sculpture, traditional art forms, etc. The era of history of China before the time in power of Qin dynasty is known by name as the period of Warring States. This period started from 475 BC and ends at 221 BC. Seven Warring States were included in it i.e. Qin, Wei, Han, Yan, Chu, Zhao, and Qi. Zheng was the King of Qin, who started his journey to triumph ove..."
