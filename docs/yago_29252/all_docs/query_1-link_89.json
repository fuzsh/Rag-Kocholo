        "text": "Samsung- Carport\n\n843 Kw cumulative capacity\n\n1 Rooftop Solar Plant & 1 Carport\n\nSamsung decided to go solar and adding a carport was found to be an apt solution for it. Amplus was roped in to present the design and in the first presentation, the design was given a go-ahead and it was completed in a record time of months.\n\nThere are two main buying options available in the market:-\n\nOPEX Model – In this, a third-party investor owns the solar plant. The consumer and the producer enter into a PPA (power purchase agreement) for a decided duration of time which is typically 15-25 years. During the tenure of PPA, the consumer pays the producer for the power generated at a decided tariff. After the PPA terminates, the solar plant is transferred to the consumer.\n\nCAPEX (Capital Expenditure) Model – In this, end consumer owns the solar plant by purchasing it upfront and can avail various financing options like bank loans to finance the solar plant.\n\nBelow are the approximate costs for a 100KW set up:\n\nRs. 65-75 lacs for the household sector.\n\nRs. 55-65 lacs for larger commercial & industrial sector.\n\nUtility-scale is even cheaper owing to economies of scale.\n\nTo get the plant size and cost most relevant to you, check out our solar calculator.\n\nSolar power is much cheaper than the power from grid and diesel generators. Today average cost of power from solar is Rs. 4.5-5 per kWh (For commercial and Industrial segments) while the average cost of power from the grid is Rs. 7 per kWh and Rs 16 per kWh from a diesel generator. (A litre of diesel generates around 3-4 kWh)."
