        "text": "Even though she is also in public among the scheming people, she still has to say a word of conscience, she didn't force you to marry her, but she showed her point of view from the very beginning: \"I only want a couple for a lifetime. !”\n\nTo be honest, as a woman, who doesn’t want to be a couple for the rest of their lives? Just how many people can achieve their wishes? Doesn't she, the most honorable empress dowager in the country, not have such a good life? She did everything possible to find all kinds of reasons to give to her grandson and woman. In fact, her jealousy had the upper hand.\n\nThe queen mother thought that if it wasn't for Ziyou, she would have been killed by Liu Su'e, a niece, and she couldn't help feeling guilty.\n\nBecause the shoulder was stabbed with a pair of scissors, the wound was still a little painful, so looking at the two increasingly cute and rare babies, I tried hard to hug, but felt a little hard.\n\nSeeing this, Ziyou approached her with the child in her arms, and said softly: \"Grandmother, you have an injury on your shoulder, don't hold the child for now, wait until the injury is fully healed.\" The\n\nempress dowager saw that Ziyou had recovered. She is well-behaved and sensible. Thinking about the relationship between her and this girl, the reason she kept blaming her all this time was because she wanted Shangguan Lingran to marry the two girls of the Shen family.\n\nSo, feeling more and more guilty, I grabbed her hand and said embarrassingly: \"You'er, the imperial grandmother was sorry for you before! Can you forgive the imperial grandmother and don't be angry with the imperial grandmother again? From now on, the imperial grandmother will not be angry again. Let Ling'er take a concubine and marry a side concubine. You guys live a good life and often bring your two treasures into the palace to see me, okay?\"\n\nZiyou nodded, \"Okay, Grandmother, granddaughter-in-law can forgive you, but granddaughter-in-law has a few words, but she can't speak quickly. When granddaughter-in-law told you these words, she didn't regard you as the queen mother, but herself It’s only because of your grandma that you can say such words that are enough to lose your head, but they come from the heart. You are a mother and a grandmother, but you are still the Queen Mother of the Great Yan Kingdom, so you should not handle things with emotion , but should be treated with a fair and just heart. Let’s talk about the fact that the father spoiled his concubine and killed his wife. If you hadn’t favored the father, Su Mei could have made trouble for so long? How could the father hate the mother? How many years have you been a concubine? And Sister Xue, if you hadn't been thinking about the Liu family, wouldn't she have married Shangguan Pengxuan as a side concubine? Then there is Liu Su'e, no matter what her motives are, she keeps going The three places want to plot against me and my son, if you had punished me earlier, would it have evolved to such an unmanageable state? Grandmother, sitting in your position, how can you have selfish motives?\"\n\nThe Empress Dowager blushed, but she remembered Liu Su'e's words, she suddenly looked at Zi You suspiciously and asked: \"But Liu Su'e does not admit that she ordered that orchid to assassinate the emperor, and said that it was you who framed her.\"\n\nZi You saw the Queen Mother The empress was suspicious, but she didn't panic, but replied frankly: \"Yes, she did not instruct Hu Ji to assassinate the emperor, but she and the fifth prince planned to ask your grandson and Hu Ji to kill the emperor after Hu Ji became the emperor's new favorite. Ji cheating, have you ever thought about how the emperor will treat Ling Ran once this happens? What will others think of Ling Ran? Also, it’s not just that she designed Ling Ran, she also designed his brother. You don’t know her Do you have any intentions? She wants the Fifth Prince to be on the throne. Just because I helped Concubine De to attract the Emperor's attention, she sees me as a thorn in the side and a thorn in the flesh. If such a narrow-minded person becomes the queen mother, Do you think it is a blessing for the common people? I rebelled against her because she was responsible for it! She refused to let the prince find Hu Ji to enter the palace. Can I have a chance to reroute her? In other words, why should I do that? I have long I have said that I will not offend others if they do not offend me. If anyone offends me, I will not forgive them lightly! Look at these people who have committed crimes in my hands. Which of them did not take the blame and seek death on their own? I never take the initiative to harm others, but others Come to harm me, I don't think I will be soft-hearted and soft-handed, and I won't fight back!\""
