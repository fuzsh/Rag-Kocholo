        "text": "Duan Zhiying (段芝英) is the mother of the Qianxing Emperor, and therefore the current Empress Dowager.\n\nDespite her unassuming appearance and behaviour, her influence extends throughout the Inner Palace, and even into the Court.\n\nBackground[]\n\nYouth and Consort[]\n\nLady Duan was born to a powerful family of officials, which claims descent from the old kings of Dali in Yunnan. Her grandfather, Duan Changqing, served in the central government and attained the rank of Grand Secretary, while her father served as Minister of Rites under the Hongguang and Jiahe Emperors.\n\nAt the age of 16, she was selected to be in the Jiahe Emperor’s harem, beginning with the rank of Concubine. Within a year she was pregnant, but miscarried after four months; nonetheless, the Emperor promoted her to consort. Three years later, she gave birth to the Fifth Prince, who would eventually become the Emperor; for this, in an unusual move, the Jiahe Emperor promoted her to Noble Consort.\n\nIn the Inner Palace, Consort Duan was given the moniker Duan (端, meaning 'dignified'). The Jiahe Emperor commented on her thus, when promoting her to Noble Consort:\n\n\"Though she is a little wanting in feminine grace, or in charming words, Consort Duan is trustworthy and meticulous, diligent in her service, and always of noble bearing.\"\n\nSuccession and Regency[]\n\nIn the summer of the 23rd year of his reign, the Jiahe Emperor died of a sudden illness at the Yuhua Gardens; Noble Consort Duan was not in attendance. The Emperor's final edict passed the throne on to the Fifth Prince, beginning the Qianxing era.\n\nTo this day, it is still a mystery as to why the Jiahe Emperor passed on his throne to the Fifth Prince, when the Second and Third Princes were both still alive and much closer to majority. There are rumours that the then-Noble Consort Duan had something to do with it, but no one who likes their life is going to say such things out loud right now.\n\nThe Jiahe Emperor did not leave explicit instructions for the newly minted Dowager, nor was she included in the Regency Council; nonetheless, her family tie to the new Emperor made her a sort of power broker. The Dowager made use of the harem as a way to tie the regents to the Emperor more tightly; therefore, she allowed the kin of all four consorts into her son's harem:\n\nNoble Consort Shangguan, granddaughter of Shangguan Shu, Chief Grand Secretary\n\nConsort Ruan, daughter of the late Ruan Yun, formerly Right Chancellor\n\nConsort Shen, daughter of Shen Changlin, Right Chancellor\n\nConsort Xiang, granddaughter of Xiang Yuanyang, Grand Secretary\n\nAt the same time as she did all this, though, she picked her own niece, Wei Li'e, to be her son's wife and therefore the Empress.\n\nEmpress Dowager Duan has played a key role in cooperating with the Regency Council; in fact, despite the official handover of power four years ago to the Emperor, the Dowager's good relationship with most of the council helped retain them in service, even in the face of the Emperor's opposition, all these years."
