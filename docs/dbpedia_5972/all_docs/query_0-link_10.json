There are a few scenes of a couple kissing passionately, and a scene where the two are naked (but we see no nudity) and they are having sex (there's also an implication of oral sex).\n\nVIOLENCE/GORE 3 - Reckless driving with two near collisions and one actual collision (no one is hurt). A woman fires a gun at man's feet and threatens to actually shoot him and/or herself. Scenes of yelling. A woman is shown restrained by handcuffs in a mental hospital.\n\nLANGUAGE 5 - Two F-words and two variations of the F-word, approximately ten scatological terms, and a handful of milder obscenities.\n\nDISCUSSION TOPICS - Parental control, abandonment by a parent, running away, mental illness, suicide.\n\nMESSAGE - Mental illness is a disease that must be treated -- love alone won't cure it; nevertheless, everybody needs the support of friends.\n\nCAVEATS\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nSee ratings & reviews at Critics.com\n\nFILTER by RATINGS\n\nDid you know you can now filter searches by any combination of ratings? Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|\n\nFIND US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFollowFollow\n\nFollowFollow\n\nadvertisement\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY\n\nPrint a page, share with friends, and yes, please go ahead and email links.
