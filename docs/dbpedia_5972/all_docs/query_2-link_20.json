        "text": "Peter Lorre was never knowingly understated. Adapted from Maurice Renard’s 1920 novel, The Hands of Orlac, Mad Love could today be considered a campy melodrama as opposed to gothic horror, thanks to his wild overacting.\n\nIt starts off from the position of pathos though. Dr Gogol (Lorre) is a lonely surgeon, smitten with a beautiful actor in a Grand Guignol style ‘Theatres des Horreurs’ place. The woman, Yvonne Orlac (Frances Drake) plays a waxwork and Gogol visits her every night to gaze upon her beauty, believing her to be the embodiment of Galatea from the Greek myth.\n\nHe interacts with her as Yvonne though, who befriends him from a place of pity. She senses his loneliness, but is grateful of his patronage.\n\nWhen Gogol discovers the show will end, he buys the waxwork copy of Yvonne and plays the organ to her every night, living inside a fantasy. Think of an incel in the body of a creepy aesthete, essentially, and you’ve got Gogol.\n\nMeanwhile, a terrible fate befalls Yvonne and her adored husband Stephen (Colin Clive) a concert pianist. He is involved in a train crash and loses the use of both hands.\n\nCue Gogol’s ‘help’: when Yvonne turns to him to save his hands, he instead amputates, and grafts the hands of a convicted murderer onto Stephen’s body. It’s here that we learn the extent of Gogol’s psychopathy, and Yvonne and Stephen’s lives are ruined.\n\nIt’s a faintly ridiculous concoction then, but wildly entertaining. I know sensibilities change over the years, but it’s hard to think of audiences being freaked out by the rather OTT Lorre, all wild eyes and maniacal pronouncements, such as, “It is I who am mad!” There’s a real comedic turn too, from May Beatty as Francoise Gogol’s permanently soused housekeeper. This brings levity to the lunacy.\n\nIt’s an atmospheric enough film though, thanks to the gorgeous cinematography from Gregg Toland, who is cited as an influence on no less than Orson Welles when creating Citizen Kane."
