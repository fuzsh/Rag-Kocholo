Harnessing this power, is Anthony Tobia, interim chair of psychiatry at Rutgers Robert Wood Medical School in New Jersey, US.\n\nHow does mental health and trauma play into season four of Stranger Things?\n\nStranger Things isn’t only one of Netflix’s most successful original series, it’s one of the most successful TV series in history. Now in its fourth and penultimate season, the series has already dived into numerous complex themes and ideas.\n\nFrom exploring the ideas that have fuelled plethora of theories around MK Ultra (an experimental arm of the CIA), to creating its own take on parallel universes as well as already touching on the idea of trauma and how neglect and abuse can impact a person; with the character of Eleven or, ‘Ell’.\n\nThe latest season has shown no signs of slowing down when it comes to tackling nuanced and difficult themes. This season’s ‘big bad’ is Vecna, a creature that moves between our world and the Upside Down by infecting people’s minds and feeding on the traumatic experiences they’ve had.\n\nIt's easy to see, in that brief summary how parallels can be drawn between the show’s portrayal of Vecna’s effects and mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression or anxiety.\n\nIn fact, Rebecca Ruiz from Mashable, dedicated a whole article recently to how one scene from the new season has resonated with so many people who have experienced mental health crises, suicidality or depression.\n\nWhy is a professor looking to Stranger Things to help teach his students?\n\n“It’s hard to discuss Stranger Things, without simultaneously discussing mental health.”\n\nSpeaking to Rutgers Today, Anthony Tobia explained that after already being a fan of the series, he decided to incorporate this most recent season into an elective course for his students that he is calling ‘Twittervision’.\n\nLooking to popular culture for learning is familiar ground for Tobia, who has in the past used the Halloween film series to inform his student’s study of psychiatric disorders.\n\nHoping to avoid any major spoilers till January when he will start the course, Tobia discussed some of the main themes with Rutgers Today and offered his expert insight.\n\nSpeaking about why he chose Stranger Things, Tobia revealed that he actually puts the selection of a film or TV series to the students:\n\n“When I get a top five list, I find one that is psychiatrically rich. That’s how I landed on Stranger Things.”\n\nSpeaking about the possible “left field”, as he phrased it, choice to include films or TV shows into a medical school curriculum he said, “The bottom line is great shows make for great lectures.”\n\nLooking at some of the specific traits of what the characters are experiencing under Vecna’s attacks, from the initial ones to the final, fatal ones, Tobia said:\n\n“There are early warning signs for those struggling with those mental illnesses…when you see things ‘go dark’, do not ignore that warning sign. This idea of, ‘Well, if I don’t pay attention, it will just go away.’ Doesn’t work.”\n\nA really vital part that popular culture and media has to play in terms of mental illness and psychiatric diagnoses is that of raising awareness, and also destigmatising. Stranger Things is in a unique position in this sense as it is watched by younger people (teenagers etc.) and older people too.\n\nWhen asked about whether a hugely popular show, such as Stranger Things could help us to normalize conversations around mental health and mental ill-health, Tobia said:\n\n“The simple answer is yes, definitely. It’s hard to discuss Stranger Things without simultaneously discussing mental health. Because of that, there is a wonderful opportunity to mainstream this discussion.”\n\nSomething that can be quite powerful, when a piece of media includes effective, accurate or sympathetic representations of mental ill-health, Tobia said, is that people not only engage with the show as a whole but also “identify with the characters with similar feelings.”\n\nThis might seem like a trivial experience to some, but Tobia doesn’t think so. Actually, identifying with a character who is experiencing mental distress could allow for people to “identify those feelings in oneself” too.\n\nWhich ultimately, could present:\n\n“A window of opportunity for individuals to identify and therefore take action in their own lives.”\n\nExploring popular culture and media as a means to inform learning around psychiatry and psychology might, at first glance, seem rather left field, as Tobia said. However, so much of our lives is made up of the popular culture and media we consume, we talk about it, it makes us feel things and it is always a thoroughly current marker for where ‘we’re at’ with big things such as mental health."
