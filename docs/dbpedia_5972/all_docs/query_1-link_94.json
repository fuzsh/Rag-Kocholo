        "text": "It appears like any other school campus with people milling around outside a café talking and smiling.\n\nWhile walking toward the café, a man comes up and extends his hand. “Welcome to TERI,” he says with a big smile.\n\nThat does not happen often on a typical school campus.\n\n“That was Chris,” Cheryl Kilmer said later. “He’s been with us since we rescued him from an institution 42 years ago. We fondly call him ‘the mad greeter.’ When he first arrived, he had a problem with aggression. But, no more. He totally changed.”\n\nKilmer co-founded TERI (Training, Education, Resource and Innovation) in 1980 as a residential alternative to institutionalizing persons with special needs and has served as its CEO for the past 44 years.\n\n“We were funded as a state pilot project to develop a model alternative,” Kilmer said. “We leased four houses, each having six residents. Chris was among that first 24. He is still living with four of his original roommates, one having passed away.”\n\nOver the years, TERI has evolved from a residential program for 24 guests to a unique multi-faceted educational and vocational center serving 900 persons with special needs at any one time.\n\nIt runs classrooms, is licensed to grant high school diplomas and offers programs on vocational training, fine arts, music, culinary, theater, equestrian, agricultural and fitness. It has a classroom campus in Oceanside and a sprawling campus in San Marcos that is regularly being expanded. It also provides homes for 71 residents.\n\nTERI maintains a fleet of buses that transports students to and from campus daily. Many are referred by school districts and health agencies, while others are enrolled by families.\n\nThe programs involve hands-on experience. Students participate in operating the campus café, farm and theater and ride horses kept in campus stables. Tickets to performances in the 200-seat theater are sold to the general public and often sell out.\n\n“I view our students as gifts to us,” Kilmer said. “We learn from them the important things in life such as relationships. My eyes frequently tear up when I speak with them or even talk about them.\n\n“I love our students. They are family.”\n\nBorn in 1951 and raised in Michigan, Kilmer was the oldest of six children. At age 6 she witnessed her younger brother choke to death.\n\n“It triggered lasting emotions,” she said.\n\n“I’ve always protected the underdog. I would speak up for someone being bullied and tell people to stop being rude.\n\n“People seem to feel comfortable telling me personal things — even strangers.”\n\nAlthough some family members thought that meant Kilmer would become a lawyer, she thought otherwise. In high school she decided to become a psychologist.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Kilmer earned a college degree and later a master’s, both in counseling psychology.\n\nWhile in college she interned at a state residential institution where she worked with a 5-year-old special needs girl. The institution shocked her.\n\n“I saw kids of all ages crammed into small places, with bad food and staff who didn’t care,” Kilmer said. “I didn’t know there were places like that in our country.\n\n“I read books to her, hugged her and we developed a relationship.”\n\nAlthough Kilmer could not remove the girl, she found her calling.\n\nIn 1977, she moved to San Diego and managed special needs housing and programs for a now defunct organization. In 1980, after reading books on creating a nonprofit, Kilmer, along with two colleagues, Dr. Krysti DeZonia and Ron Roher, formed TERI.\n\nToday, TERI is a California-designated model program. Its story and program materials are shared with organizations in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n“While there are many programs helping people with special needs, I’m not aware of any that put all of these programs in one place,” said Kilmer, a Vista resident.\n\nShe emphasized TERI strives to be a welcoming campus of life that inspires students to learn and grow with self-confidence.\n\nOn the wall in TERI’s lobby is a quote from Dr. Seuss: “Why fit in when you were born to STAND OUT!”\n\nAbout this series\n\nGoldsmith is a Union-Tribune contributing columnist.\n\nWe welcome reader suggestions of people who have done something extraordinary or otherwise educational, inspiring or interesting and who have not received much previous media.
