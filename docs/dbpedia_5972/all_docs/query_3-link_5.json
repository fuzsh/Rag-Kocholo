        "text": "Questionnaire\n\nFrom each of the four quarters, 50 respondents were selected, which provided a total sample size of 200 adults. The selection of respondents was done randomly by selecting one adult from every 5th household on the registration lists in the health centers (which listed all households in a quarter). Demographic data of the respondents are presented in Table .\n\nTable 1\n\nAge (M)46.0 (SD = 15.7)SexMale = 50%/Female = 50%OccupationSales = 21%/Civil servant = 15%/Housewife = 13.5%/Retired = 13.5%/Worker = 6%/Student = 6%EducationIlliterate = 5%/Reading & writing = 4.5%/Primary school = 15.5%/Secondary school = 26.5%/High school = 28.5%/University and over = 20%ReligionBuddhist = 70%/Catholic = 4.5%/Not religious = 25.5%\n\nPeople’s perceptions and attitudes towards mental health were investigated using a four-part, semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire included both open and closed questions. The first part collected demographic data about the respondents, including age, gender, marital status, occupation, education level, ethnicity and religion. The second part addressed awareness and knowledge of respondents about mental illness, its symptoms, causes and treatment options; these questions were based on the content of questionnaires used in previously published studies on mental illness (Kabir et al. 2004; Deribew and Tamirat 2005). This part included four main questions, which were posed first as open questions, then as closed questions in which respondents could indicate on a dichotomous scale whether they did or did not recognize a certain illness,1 symptom, cause or treatment. The third part explored attitudes towards people with mental illness and perceived severity by using vignettes describing four cases, each representing one mental illness (major depression, alcohol dependency, generalized anxiety disorder and schizophrenia) and one representing a physical illness (diabetes). For each illness, attitudes were measured by the cumulative scores of five items each with a response on a 5-point Likert scale. Three items assessed the respondents’ expectations of a patient’s future and two items assessed social distance (the willingness to engage in relationships of varying intimacy with a person). The perceived severity of each illness was measured by one item using a 5-point Likert scale. Furthermore, respondents could indicate whether they thought the person depicted in the vignette had a mental illness and whether this person needed treatment. If the respondent indicated a need for treatment, an open question was posed about the appropriate treatment. The vignettes and items measuring attitudes were based on the “Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire” (AMIQ) (Luty et al. 2006) but adapted to the local context. The fourth part of the questionnaire inquired about personal experiences with mental illness in eight open questions.\n\nThe questionnaire was developed with the help and advice of local mental health experts. It was constructed in English, translated into Vietnamese and checked for consistency of translation by a third person. A pilot study with 8 respondents was carried out before finalisation of the questionnaire. The data were collected by interview, which was done by a group of 12 master students of Hue Medical University who had been trained for one day on the questionnaire and on interview techniques. The respondents were asked for their informed consent before the interview. The collected data were translated into English, entered in Epi-Info 6.0® and converted for analysis in SPSS-13.\n\nIn the presentation of the results, distinction is often made between the responses obtained using open and closed questions. This is important because in the open questions, which came first, the respondents had to come up with the information themselves, while in the closed questions, we presented possibilities and they could choose among them. When the results were similar in the two cases, the likelihood that the perception was strongly rooted is high, whereas responses that were only given when elicited by the closed questions might be less obvious or familiar to the respondents.\n\nFocus Group Discussions\n\nEight focus group discussions (FGDs) were held, four with people unrelated to any patient with a mental health problem, and four with relatives of mental health patients. These participants were selected by convenience sampling through the health centers of the four quarters. Table shows the number of participants of the eight FGDs and relating demographic data.\n\nTable 2\n\nPatient unrelatedPatient relatedTotalFGD 1FGD 2FGD3FGD4FGD5FGD6FGD7FGD8N (M/F)*10 (7/3)9 (2/7)10 (1/9)8 (2/6)10 (2/8)7 (5/2)10 (0/10)12 (4/8)76 (23/53)Age (M)54.153.744.861,349.447.745.556.651.6\n\nIn the discussions with the four patient-unrelated groups, a first exercise addressed the identification of symptoms of mental illness. During the second exercise, the participants were asked to discuss a case story describing one of the following mental illnesses: major depression, generalized anxiety disorder or schizophrenia. The case stories were based on those used in a study by Deribew and Tamirat (2005) but adapted to the local context. In the four patient-related FGD, the first exercise included a similar discussion about one of the same three case stories. The second exercise for these groups addressed the identification of perceived obstacles in the accessibility to mental health care.\n\nThe first FGD was considered a pilot session. However, because only minor changes were then made in the guidelines, the data were included in the final analysis. All FGD took place in the Community Health Centers of the four quarters and all were attended by one moderator and one observer. The moderator was a PhD student at Hue Medical University, who had been trained and carefully instructed in using the structured guidelines. At the start of each session, the participants were informed about the purpose of the discussion and were asked for their consent, also for the use of a tape recorder. The FGD results were analysed after manual coding by a “summarizing content analysis” method (Flick et al. 2004)."
