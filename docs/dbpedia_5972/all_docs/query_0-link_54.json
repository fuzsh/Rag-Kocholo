        "text": "Drew worked as a murdering minor for a lot of reasons—that sly smile, her knowing pout—but there was also the sense that she was distinctly capable of killing because she had, despite her young age, lived through and seen things, which numbed her to the customary taboos. At the beginning of Poison Ivy, Sylvie and the neighborhood kids gather around a dog whose been hit by a vehicle. Its entrails are splayed across the road, but it is somehow still alive. Suddenly, Ivy whacks the poor beast in the head with a shovel. The scene portends homicidal intent, but it also reveals Ivy to be someone accustomed to the cruelties of everyday life.\n\nIvy, it turns out, is an orphan who lives with an aunt on welfare. In Doppelganger, Holly’s psychological disorder is attributed to her past of sexual abuse. In fact, rapists appear repeatedly throughout Barrymore’s early roles: midway through the 1994 Western Bad Girls, Drew’s character, the littlest gunslinger-cum-brothel-worker in the all-female posse, is kidnapped and presumably gang-raped offscreen. But essential to the early Barrymore brand is her lack of innocence—which is not to suggest that the punishments endured by these characters are justified by the films. Rather, it underscores her fearlessness, and makes her a force that bites back, often in rejection of her own victimhood.\n\nLook at Guncrazy (1992), a remake of the classic Joseph H. Lewis film that sees Drew as a social outcast living in a trailer with her predatory stepdad. She eventually puts a revolver to her sleazy guardian’s head, emboldened by having found love in an ex-con and fellow firearm afficionado. Her love makes her stronger, yes, but it also makes her uninhibited, delusional, limitless—all too willing to graze death, as she does in all these early films. On the run from her domineering parents in Mad Love (1995), Casey places her hands over her boyfriend’s eyes as he drives their convertible along a winding mountain road. She entreats him to trust her as she whispers directions in his ear, revealing early on her morbid propensities well before the full scope of her mental illness becomes apparent—perhaps a nod to Barrymore’s teenage battle with depression and her suicide attempt at 14.\n\n1995 was also the year that Barrymore began steering herself in a direction closer to the wholesome, nurturing one of today, opting for much lighter fare that turned away from these meta-macabre reckonings with her past. Retiring her unhinged persona must have felt like a rejection of that destructive impulse dramatized by Mad Love. In January of that year, she posed nude for Playboy. The following month, she turned 20. Then in April, she appeared on the David Letterman show where she leapt onto the bewildered host’s desk and flashed him. In her most recent memoir, Wildflower, she writes that this Letterman appearance—an embarrassment when she watched it back on tape shortly after it happened—sparked her reinvention: “I realized right then and there that this was the end of an era for me … I started my journey into no sex scenes in movies, modesty clauses in my contracts, and a total lack of nudity in any public forum from there on out.” So, even though she had starred in multiple films in which she washes someone else’s blood off her naked body in leering slow motion, Barrymore would go on to become an archetypal sweetheart—a vivacious Cinderella in Ever After (1998), a sexually stunted bookworm in Never Been Kissed (1999), a wannabe writer who becomes pregnant after losing her virginity in Riding in Cars with Boys (2001). The new Drew was still flirty and mischievous, but her sexuality was no longer an extension of her brokenness; her rebellious spirit an all-American quirk as opposed to merely indicative of a dark pathology or a hereditary curse.\n\nStill, there’s a dimension to Barrymore’s sexpot films that complicate their doom and gloom. “The cross makes me think of death, the ivy of life,” says Ivy, running her fingers over her temporary tattoo. “It’s sort of the tragic and the hopeful, yeah?” The tragic and the hopeful—that seems to me to describe what makes these early Barrymore performances so compelling. She embodies the tragic nature of her own history without succumbing to a fatalistic worldview, refusing—despite her characters’ often grueling circumstances—to give up hope, this more idealistic sensibility coming through in scenes of gleeful abandon: licking her lips as she shoots tin cans beside her lover in Guncrazy; screaming her head off at a punk concert in Mad Love. When Casey and Matt (Chris O’Donnell) lie in naked postcoital embrace, he asks if their love will last forever. Casey says yes, tentatively. The look on her face is slightly blank, charged with the understanding that the chances are slim. Yet something in her expression refuses to say no.\n\nBeatrice Loayza is a writer and editor who contributes regularly to The New York Times, the Criterion Collection, Artforum, 4Columns, and other publications."
