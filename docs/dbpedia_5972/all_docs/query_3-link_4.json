        "text": "ASYLUM\n\nBy Patrick McGrath.\n\n254 pp. New York:\n\nRandom House. $22.\n\nWe don't usually associate Gothic novels with elegance and discretion, but these are the defining features of Patrick McGrath's work. His characters have names like Coal and Giblet and Cleg, they are addicted to morphine or to the enjoyment of their own rage, they dismember bodies, end up as vegetables, die in flames, limp around like Long John Silver trying out for the part of Quasimodo. But they talk as if they were training for an Edwardian tea party, and their illusions about their own understanding of the world are always part of their precarious story. They say: ''It was shortly after the arrival of the Fledges that a rather bizarre incident occurred'' (''The Grotesque''), ''After the kipper and potato incident Hilda became far less sanguine about me'' (''Spider'') and ''That night marked an important change in my feelings about your mother'' (''Dr. Haggard's Disease''). These effects are beautifully calculated, and Mr. McGrath deserves all the praise he has received for his three previous, just-named novels. But you also feel passions and obsessions are sometimes being named rather than evoked, that things so often said to be ominous (''The evening shadows thicken,'' ''Later I would learn what it meant, that frown'') must at last be drained of their menace. The violence itself is a little wordy, and the whole performance is perhaps a little, well, bloodless.\n\nMr. McGrath's new novel, ''Asylum,'' looks as if it belongs in the same territory, and certainly has the same voice and the same elegance. Our narrator is a senior doctor at a maximum security mental hospital in England, full of a stuffy confidence in his own professional perceptions. On the very first page he more or less quotes the opening of Ford Madox Ford's ''Good Soldier,'' saying, ''Stella Raphael's story is one of the saddest I know,'' but even without this clue we would soon be on to his ignorance, his failure to see beyond the comfortable categories of his trade. ''The catastrophic love affair characterized by sexual obsession,'' he tells us, ''has been a professional interest of mine for many years now,'' and within minutes he is describing a patient who clings to her ''illusions'' because ''the truth . . . would have been the ruin of the few flimsy psychic structures she had left.'' His psychic structures are solid because they are institutional, but he is clinging to his illusions as hard as anyone can. He speaks complacently of his own ''patrician ease'' and talks possessively of his patients. ''My Edgar,'' he says more than once. He longs to become head of the hospital, and does, but never confesses to anything other than a profound reluctance for the job and a disapproval of other candidates.\n\nThis man can tell us Stella Raphael's story, since she recounted most of it to him, but he can't know what it is about. Do we know? Does Mr. McGrath? I'm not sure he or we do, and this is where ''Asylum'' differs from the author's earlier works. Instead of threats too perfectly fulfilled, we have dangers that can't be grasped, a departure into madness that is perfectly pictured but beyond analysis. Why would a beautiful woman, the wife of a younger doctor at this hospital, fall in love with a patient who had murdered his wife in the most brutal way and who then cut her head off and took her eyes out? Why would she later stand by, apparently paralyzed by indifference, while her young son drowns in a pond?"
