        "text": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition that can affect mood, behavior, and self-image.\n\nBPD is a type of personality disorder. A person with BPD experiences intense emotions, poor self-image, and impulsive behaviors. Another characteristic symptom of the condition is a lack of stability in personal relationships.\n\nThe term borderline originally came into use when clinicians thought of the person as being on the border between having neuroses and psychosis, as people with a diagnosis of BPD experience elements of both.\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) suggest that around 1.4% of adults in the United States have BPD.\n\nHistorically, BPD has been difficult to treat. However, the NIMH say that new evidence-based treatments can reduce the symptoms and improve the person’s quality of life.\n\nThis article provides an overview of BPD, including its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options.\n\nBPD is a complex mental health condition characterized by difficulties with emotion and self-image, unstable personal relationships, and impulsive behaviors.\n\nBPD is a cluster B personality disorder. This is a group of disorders that affect a person’s emotional functioning and lead to behaviors that others see as extreme or irrational.\n\nCommon challenges in BPD include:\n\ninstability in relationships with others\n\nintense emotions, such as anger and low mood\n\nsudden shifts in self-image (regarding values or career plans, for example)\n\nimpulsive and damaging behaviors, which can include substance misuse or impulsive spending\n\nself-harm and, for some people, suicidal thoughts or actions\n\nThe way a person with BPD interacts with others is closely associated with their self-image and early social interactions.\n\nAlmost 75% of people with BPD are women. It may affect men equally, but men are more likely to receive a misdiagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.\n\nIn most cases, BPD begins in early adulthood. Clinicians will not usually diagnose it in children or adolescents, as their personality is still developing during these years. Symptoms that may look like those of BPD may resolve as children get older.\n\nClinicians use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) to diagnose mental health conditions, including BPD. Insurance companies also use the DSM-5 to reimburse for the treatment of this condition.\n\nAccording to the DSM-5, the following signs and symptoms are characteristic of BPD:\n\nfrantic efforts to avoid being abandoned by friends or family\n\nunstable and intense personal relationships that shift between extreme adoration and extreme dislike\n\na persistently unstable self-image or sense of self, such as sudden shifts in values, career path, types of friends, or sexuality\n\nimpulsive, damaging behaviors, such as substance misuse, sexual activity, unsafe driving, or binge eating\n\nself-harming behaviors and, for some people, suicidal thoughts or actions\n\nintense moods, such as extreme low mood, irritability, or anxiety that lasts for a few hours to a few days\n\nchronic feelings of emptiness\n\nextreme anger\n\ndifficulty controlling anger\n\nsevere feelings of dissociation, which means feeling disconnected\n\nstress-related paranoid thoughts\n\nThe symptoms of BPD are present in a variety of different situations. They are not consistent with the individual’s developmental stage or place in society, and they are not solely due to the use of drugs or the presence of a medical condition.\n\nThe following sections will look at some of the significant symptoms of BPD in more detail.\n\nEmotional symptoms\n\nA main symptom of BPD is difficulty regulating emotions. The person may feel emotions intensely and for long periods, and they may find it more difficult to return to a baseline emotion after experiencing emotional stress.\n\nThe person may also have feelings of intense anger or difficulty controlling their anger. This is often followed by shame or guilt, which can impair the person’s self-image. This anger is often in response to a fear of neglect, uncaring, or abandonment.\n\nSelf-harm is another common symptom. People with BPD may use this as a means of regulating their emotions, punishing themselves, or expressing their inner pain.\n\nAnother symptom of BPD is recurring thoughts of suicide. Some people also engage in suicidal actions. The rates of self-harm and suicide are higher in people with BPD than in people without.\n\nReceiving effective treatment can help people manage their emotions and reduce the frequency or severity of self-harm behaviors and suicidal thoughts.\n\nImpulsive behaviors\n\nAnother characteristic symptom of BPD is engaging in impulsive behaviors, which may involve:\n\nrisky sexual activity\n\nsubstance misuse\n\nexcessive spending\n\ngambling\n\nunsafe driving\n\nbinge eating\n\nPeople may also feel bored often and have a persistent need to have something to do.\n\nRelationship difficulties\n\nPeople with BPD often have patterns of intense or unstable relationships. This may involve a shift from extreme adoration to extreme dislike, known as a shift from idealization to devaluation.\n\nRelationships may be marked by attempts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. The perceived threat of being abandoned can have a significant impact on the person’s self-image, moods, thoughts, and behaviors.\n\nFor example, the person may feel panicked or angry over minor separations from people they feel close to.\n\nSuicide prevention\n\nIf you know someone at immediate risk of self-harm, suicide, or hurting another person:\n\nAsk the tough question: “Are you considering suicide?”\n\nListen to the person without judgment.\n\nCall 911 or the local emergency number, or text TALK to 741741 to communicate with a trained crisis counselor.\n\nStay with the person until professional help arrives.\n\nTry to remove any weapons, medications, or other potentially harmful objects if it’s safe to do so.\n\nIf you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, a prevention hotline can help. The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at 988. During a crisis, people who are hard of hearing can use their preferred relay service or dial 711 then 988.\n\nFind more links and local resources.\n\nSome people may be genetically predisposed to developing BPD, with certain environmental factors increasing the risk.\n\nExperts have identified three factors as likely to play a part in the development of BPD: genetics, environmental factors, and neurological factors.\n\nThe following sections will look at each of these in more detail.\n\nGenetics\n\nThere is a genetic predisposition to developing BPD, with twin studies suggesting over 50% heritability for the condition.\n\nMany people with BPD have an immediate relative who has a mental health condition, which might be bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorder, or antisocial personality disorder.\n\nEnvironmental factors\n\nMany people with BPD have had experiences of trauma, such as abuse or abandonment in childhood, hostile conflicts, or unstable relationships.\n\nSome sources say that 70% of people with BPD experienced mistreatment during childhood, such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect.\n\nNeurological factors\n\nSome studies have found structural and functional differences in the brains of people with BPD — specifically in brain areas linked with emotion regulation.\n\nHowever, experts do not know whether these differences were risk factors or developed due to the condition itself.\n\nBPD is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms overlap with those of other mental health conditions. Individual cases can also vary greatly.\n\nMental health professionals can diagnose BPD following a thorough psychological evaluation during which they ask about the person’s clinical history and their symptoms.\n\nAs BPD shares some symptoms with several other conditions, mental health professionals will need to rule these out before being able to make a firm BPD diagnosis.\n\nIn addition, BPD often occurs alongside other mental health conditions, such as:\n\nmajor depressive disorder\n\nbipolar disorder\n\nanxiety disorders\n\nsubstance misuse\n\neating disorders\n\nDue to the difficulties in diagnosing BPD, it often goes underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed.\n\nAccording to the DSM-5, the impacts of BPD and the risk of suicide are highest in early adulthood. However, they gradually reduce with age. Most people achieve greater stability in their relationships and jobs by their 30s and 40s.\n\nAlthough BPD can be difficult to treat, new evidence-based treatments can reduce the symptoms and improve the person’s quality of life.\n\nPeople who receive therapeutic treatments often experience improvements during the first year. Studies have reported that after about 10 years, as many as 91% of people achieve remission from BPD.\n\nBPD is a complex mental health condition characterized by instability in a person’s moods, behaviors, and personal relationships.\n\nReceiving effective treatment, such as psychotherapy and social support, can reduce the frequency and severity of the person’s symptoms.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental illness offer advice for family members and caregivers on how to support others with a mental health condition while looking after themselves."
