Our perception defines who we believe we are, how we believe our interactions with others should go, and how we believe the world should operate. We view all experiences and conflicts through this lens.\n\nUltimately, it is our perception of an experience that creates our feelings about it, not the event itself. In turn, our feelings determine our behavior (our reaction to any situation).\n\nIn challenging situations, our perception will either help us maintain our composure or make it almost impossible to remain calm.\n\nPower of Perception in Practice\n\nLet’s say you see one child hit another. How do you perceive this situation?\n\nIf you perceive the situation as sheer meanness, you are almost guaranteed to lose your composure. You’ll then react in a punitive or attacking way toward the child you perceive as aggressive. For most, the reaction is automatic, and it’s likely to look and sound like the model you had growing up (a parent or another caregiver).\n\nBut what if you perceive two children who need help with their social skills?\n\nSeeing the same situation through this lens enables you to remain calm and choose a wise response. Remaining calm empowers you to teach the skills the children are missing.\n\nOne perception escalates the upset, while the other perception fosters new learning. In this article, I’ll share four steps that enable you to choose a helpful response rather than a hurtful response.\n\nBut first, you must learn to reclaim your power.\n\nReclaiming Your Power\n\nThe Power of Perception says: No one can make you angry without your permission.\n\nAny time you believe that someone or something has made you angry, sad, or even happy, you give your power away.\n\nYet every day, we send the message that other people can control our feelings and behavior:\n\nDon’t make me call your father!\n\nLook what you made me do. Now I’m running late for work!\n\nThese children are driving me crazy.\n\nLook how you made your brother feel. Was that nice?\n\nYou make me so mad!\n\nWhomever you put in charge of your feelings, you put in charge of you. You give up your authority, responsibility and respect. This leaves you feeling powerless.\n\nThe Effect of Placing Others in Charge\n\nWhen we believe that others can make us behave a certain way, we naturally believe that we should be able to make others behave a certain way too. Both beliefs are myths.\n\nThe belief that we can make others change puts a lot of pressure on parents and teachers. It leads to frantic attempts to manipulate, threaten, and coerce children into changed behavior.\n\nWhen these methods fail, we blame ourselves and feel guilty. We think: If I were a good parent or a good teacher, I would be able to make these children behave. This, too, is untrue.\n\nThese false beliefs teach other-control rather than self-control. Other-control destroys communication and connection. It cannot lead to lasting changes in behavior.\n\nReclaim your power and model self-control by:\n\nReminding yourself, “The only person I can make change is myself.”\n\nAvoiding “make me” language. Instead, say something like, “I feel frustrated when I arrive to work late. I need your help in the morning to get out the door on time. Will you help me?”\n\nShifting your energy from “making children behave” to connecting with children and helping them be successful.\n\nThis is how you reclaim your power, model self-control and teach children to respect authority. Accepting that you alone are responsible for your upset is the first step toward permanent behavior change—for you and for the children in your care.\n\nNext, you must learn to recognize and manage your perceptions. This gives you the power to choose how you respond to challenging situations.\n\nWhere does our perception come from?\n\nSome perceptual preprogramming is in our DNA when we’re born. The rest of our programming comes from our early childhood experiences. This programming becomes automatic and unconscious, and it can be healthy or unhealthy.\n\nUnhealthy programming may include perceptions like:\n\nIf you want something done, you must do it yourself.\n\nAsking others for help is a sign of weakness.\n\nTo stay safe, I must never trust others.\n\nDo any of these sound familiar to you?\n\nThese unhealthy messages stem from ruptures in the adult-child bond. In moments when an adult seems out of control and scary to a child, the child unconsciously feels flawed. They fear they don’t belong and are doomed to be kicked out of the tribe. To guard against this, children create unconscious mental models, like, “I will never ask for help again.”\n\nThese fear-driven, unconscious mental models control how the child views, interacts with and responds to the world, even as an adult. We use these mental models to maintain a sense of certainty and predictability as we navigate the world. Since we believe these mental models keep us safe, we constantly look for confirmation. When the world does not align with our mental models, we feel threatened and become triggered.\n\nThe good news is that we don’t have to be controlled by our unconscious perceptions forever. With the Power of Perception, we can consciously work toward positive change.\n\nCan we choose our perception?\n\nWe don’t want to be unconscious adults who run on programmed perceptions. We want to choose a healthy perception so we can respond, rather than react, to what life brings. However, you can’t choose how to perceive a situation unless you’re aware of your perception. Changing your perception and mental models requires consciousness.\n\nOur perceptions happen at a rapid-fire pace, making awareness tricky. In fact, we often think the behavior happened first. We fail to notice the perception and then the feelings that trigger the behavior in the first place.\n\nSo, the question is: How do we get to the point where we can choose how to perceive a situation rather than running on autopilot?\n\nPower of Perception Step 1: Notice that you’re triggered\n\nThe first step is becoming aware when you fall into an unconscious state. Signs that you are in this unconscious state include:\n\nTightening in throat\n\nTightening in chest\n\nHolding your breath\n\nExperiencing loss of energy\n\nInability to focus\n\nUsing defensive humor/sarcasm\n\nCertainty that you are right and everyone else is wrong\n\nThink of the last time an event really pushed your buttons. How did you feel physically? Did you experience any of these sensations?\n\nPower of Perception Step 2: Change your state from upset to calm\n\nWhen you recognize these signs, catch yourself. Pause before saying or doing anything. Take a few deep breaths. Remind yourself, “I’m safe. Keep breathing. I can handle this.”\n\nBring yourself back to a state of composure and consciousness. If you’re conscious enough, you will hear in your inner speech the unconscious beliefs and perceptions behind your trigger.\n\nRecognizing the unconscious programming beneath your upset gives you the opportunity to change your perception from negative to positive.\n\nPower of Perception Step 3: Change your perception from negative to positive\n\nWe tend to default to the negative perception that a child is bad, stubborn, disrespectful, or intentionally pushing our buttons.\n\nInstead, we want to use the Power of Perception to consciously offer a perception to others that will be helpful instead of hurtful. This is not “letting them off the hook.”\n\nThe goal is to see others in a positive light so we can access the higher centers of our brain, giving us the power of choice and the ability to behave and model in a healthy manner. Without this change in perception, we will model the exact same behaviors we are trying to eliminate in children.\n\nIf you’ve made it to Step 3, you’re calm and conscious enough to recognize your negative perception, meaning you have the ability to change it.\n\nLet’s go back to our example of one child hitting another. You now see that your default perception is: “That child is mean.”\n\nIn Conscious Discipline, we recognize that all behavior is a form of communication. Ask yourself what the child’s behavior is communicating:\n\nWhat need does the child have that is not being met?\n\nWhat does the child want?\n\nWhat skill is the child missing?\n\nNow, consciously shift your perception. Why did the child hit?\n\nTell yourself: “The child needs help learning social and emotional skills. He may need to learn how to ask for a turn or how to manage his frustration.”\n\nPower of Perception Step 4: Respond\n\nNow that you’re viewing the situation from a positive perceptual lens, you’ll be able to choose a wise response. Rather than verbally attacking the aggressor, you can teach helpful skills to both children involved in the altercation.\n\nDid the child hit because he wanted a toy? Tell him, “You may not hit. Hitting hurts.” Then teach him to say, “May I have a turn?” instead.\n\nAt the same time, you have the opportunity to teach the other child to be assertive. Responding to the victim, you may say, “Did you like it when he hit you? Tell him, ‘When you want to play with my toy, ask me for a turn.’”\n\nIf hitting is the only skill a child has, merely telling him not to hit is not helpful. He can’t get rid of this old skill until he has a new, improved skill to replace it. You must be composed enough to teach the child what to do instead.\n\nSuggested Free Resource: This free Hitting Book helps teach children who express anger through hitting to find socially acceptable alternatives to get their needs met. It also provides strategies for adults to help the child in moments of upset.\n\nThe Result: Changed Behavior\n\nI’ve broken the Power of Perception into a four-step process, but it happens in a matter of seconds. Mastering this process takes effort, practice and time. Be kind to yourself as you “Oops” along the way. Stick with it. If you can do this, you can make huge changes in your behavior—and then in the behavior of children.\n\nIn Conscious Discipline, we teach children to make permanent behavior changes through a similar process:\n\nWe tell them, “You seem angry,” or, “You seem sad,” to help them recognize their upset state.\n\nWe say and model, “Breathe with me. You can handle this,” to help them change their emotional state from upset to calm.\n\nWe say, “You wanted ________,” or, “You were hoping _________,” to change their perception from negative to positive.\n\nFinally, we provide them with helpful responses: “When you want ____________, say/do ______________” or “Tell your friend, ‘When you want _________, say/do ___________.’”\n\nWe can’t teach children a process that we’re incapable of mastering ourselves. So, commit to consistently practicing this four-step process. As you improve your own skills, it will become second nature to model them and teach them to children.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Power of Perception\n\nIf we can change our perception, we can make permanent behavior changes. Then, we can teach children to permanently change their behavior too.\n\nStart by acknowledging that when you are upset, it’s because you feel threatened or the world is not going your way. No one can make you feel anything. Take back your power.\n\nRemember to:\n\nNotice that you’re triggered. Pause.\n\nChange your state from upset to calm. (I’m safe. Keep breathing. I can handle this.)\n\nChange your perception from negative to positive.\n\nChoose a helpful response instead of a hurtful reaction.\n\nWith this process, you can compose yourself when triggered, change the neural pathways in your brain, and cease to pass your guilt and triggers down to the next generation. The Power of Perception is powerful indeed.\n\nNext Steps\n\nJoin me for in-depth online learning experiences about the Seven Powers and Seven Skills.\n\nDiscover helpful responses to common discipline scenarios.\n\nVisit Shubert’s School or Shubert’s Home to see practical, room-by-room tips for Conscious Discipline implementation, along with photo and video examples.\n\nIf you’re new to Conscious Discipline, start with the foundational Conscious Discipline book.\n\nMore Helpful Resources for the Power of Perception"
