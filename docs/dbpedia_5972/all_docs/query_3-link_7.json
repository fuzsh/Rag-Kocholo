        "text": "Archetypes have been at the heart of character building and development since the beginning of the art form. Providing a model of traits and behaviours associated with a role or a character-type, these archetypes are a comfortable and familiar format to audiences, in turn, leading to the creation of stereotypes.\n\nNot harmful on their own, it’s when these stereotypes are used (even unintentionally) as weapons to harm a particular group that they become troubling.\n\nIn this case, psychiatrists, or other mental health- or brain- or science-related professionals.\n\nCertain cues have corresponding expectations; however, storytellers must keep in mind that audiences may go on to expect those same behaviours from perceived cues in ‘real-life’.\n\nThe ‘crazy is evil’ trope is a textbook example of this happening, as discussed in my previous blogs and by other writers in InSPIre the Mind.\n\nAs with our perceptions, tropes and archetypes can also change over time.\n\nScience fiction of the ’70s and ’80s popularised “The Mad Scientist” — a figure who messes with forces they cannot understand only to fall victim to their own egos. This is such a familiar and timeless trope that it’s even recognised by some as its own sub-genre.\n\nIn extreme cases, science fiction/horror movies such as Reanimator (1985), but even comedies like Back to the Future (1985), often present this “mad scientist” as a socially and emotionally incompetent, repressed, awkward man who knows everything except how to relate to people.\n\nSome audiences recognise particular cues to suggest that these characters may be coded by the writers as having a form of behavioural disorder, like ‘being on the spectrum’, albeit a very stereotypically presented one.\n\nHowever, the word ‘coded’ implies intent on the writer’s part. In most of these ‘mad scientist’ films, we do not know if this is the case, or, rather, if the writer just perpetuates stereotypes in which scientists are described as marginalised people, with all the features that ‘real’ marginalised people have.\n\nBy linking these negative characterizations to attributes associated with mental disorders, we prime audiences to respond to people they come across in the ‘real world’ in the same way that heroes in these movies respond to their ‘mad’ villains.\n\nSo, we meet a scientist, and we think that he (they are usually a he) must be, at best, odd, and at worse, a killer.\n\nCinema of the ’90s and ’00s saw this ‘mad scientist’ evolve into a more subtle villain — the doctor or the psychiatrist with nefarious motives, preying on vulnerable patients simply because they can. Movies which focus on this harmful dynamic paint psychiatrists as dangerously sociopathic, and this is simply untrue.\n\nThe most well-known character that comes to mind is Dr Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lamb (1991), and recently re-proposed in the NBC series Hannibal (2013–2015). This a villain who time-and-time again disregards the well-being of his patients completely, focusing instead on how he can manipulate them to do his bidding. Here we have a doctor, a psychiatrist, a man well respected in his field, and, of course, he is also a serial-killer-cannibal-manipulator-sociopath.\n\nIn the psychological thriller, Unsane (2018), we see a woman wrongfully committed into a mental institution, when her stalker takes advantage of his position at an asylum. The clinicians and staff are also tricking people into voluntarily admitting themselves, for an insurance scheme. The film sets up the faculty administration as cold, apathetic, and willing to torture people for some quick cash. It implies, that they cannot be trusted.\n\nM. Night Shyamalan’s Glass (2019) presents a similar dynamic. Yet again, there’s a larger conspiracy at play. The psychiatrist, Dr Staple, continually manipulates the three men under her care, convincing them to believe that they are psychotic and unable to distinguish reality from fiction.\n\nWhat ties these films together is the irredeemable psychiatrist or doctor who gaslights and tortures the protagonist. This is not a character to empathise with nor to admire. The audience never roots for Dr Staple, nor the staff in Unsane.\n\nSuch cinema feeds into the false idea that psychiatrists eagerly wait for the opportunity to misdiagnose people and lock them up in asylums.\n\nAll it would take is to trust a doctor once, admit to being occasionally sad or scared, and then BAM, you are locked up!"
