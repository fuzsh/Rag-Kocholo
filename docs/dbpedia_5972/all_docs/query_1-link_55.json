        "text": "You walk into the therapy room. It is elegantly decorated with old Persian rugs and mid-century furniture. Intriguing sculptures stand between thick stacks of books. The light is soft and a little dim. You are welcome to lie down upon the couch, but you choose to sit in a comfortable wingback chair.\n\nYour therapist sits behind a large wooden desk. She smiles warmly at you. She puts on her glasses and looks at her computer screen.\n\n“Let’s talk about this dream you e-mailed me,” she says. She turns from her screen and meets your gaze.\n\n“So, I’m in this big room,” you tell her. “All these chairs are set up for a special event, maybe a wedding. And I’ve made this really cool dish—a sort of savory pastry that was really complicated to make. I’m so excited to share it with everyone. But no one accepts any when I offer it to them. No one will eat any of it. No one’s interested in it at all. It just stands there, untouched, while people come and go and eat other things.”\n\n“How do you feel in the dream?”\n\n“Really sad. Heartbroken. I want to cry.”\n\n“Does it remind you of anything?”\n\n“Yes. Being a kid. I’m not sure I can remember what exactly it reminds me of from back then. But I know, even though I’m an adult in the dream, and have pulled off a very adult task, I feel like a little kid.”\n\n“What is your interpretation of the dream?”\n\n“I think it’s about all the things I tried to do or share with my family when I was little. I think it’s about being invisible.”\n\nA tear comes to your eye. You and your therapist sit in gentle silence for a few moments. She maintains eye contact and you know you have her full attention. You feel cared about even though she doesn’t say anything to reassure you.\n\nIn fact, you trust your therapist all the more for holding you in that warm, wise silence instead of offering you the same kind of platitudes someone else would.\n\nYou understand you need to continue; you understand that she is helping guide you to your own insights as you make connections with that younger version of yourself from the dream.\n\n“I want to make something that other people will actually eat. I want people to appreciate what I do. I want people to see me.”\n\n“Yes,” she says.\n\nYou walk into your therapist’s office. It’s a well-lit space with white walls and minimalist décor. Ceiling-length windows present a panoramic view of the city beyond.\n\nThe only items on your therapist’s desk are a razor-thin computer monitor and a single orchid. He sits beside his desk, not behind it, in a black and chrome chair exactly like the one you’re sitting in, facing you and smiling warmly.\n\n“Tell me about your week,” he says.\n\n“Well, it started out fine,” you say. “But then Biff started getting on my nerves. He is always such a jerk. My mood has been messed up for the last few days. I’m not even talking to him right now.”\n\n“What did you fight about?” your therapist asks.\n\n“He is so disrespectful. He throws his dirty socks everywhere. He walks around playing a podcast I can’t stand, and he always forgets it’s his night to do the dishes. It’s as much work for me to go around behind him yelling at him to do it as it is to just do it myself. I know he knows it. He just thinks I’ll eventually do it if he waits long enough. He doesn’t care. He takes me for granted. And I’m sick of it.”\n\n“Okay, let’s unpack this a bit. First, do you already have an idea of what I might be about to say?”\n\n“Biff can’t read my mind and I assume too much about what he knows and thinks and what it means.”\n\n“Yes. It’s fair to want Biff to behave differently, but it helps to understand that what’s making you madder than anything else are the beliefs you have about what his behavior means.”\n\n“You’re right. I feel like I should have learned this by now. You point it out to me a lot.”\n\n“That’s okay. It’s a mental habit we all have. I have to remind myself of these things on a regular basis, too. Another thing I wanted to point out is that you’re using that pesky word again—”\n\n“Always?”\n\n“Yes, that one. Are there, in fact, times that Biff remembers to do the dishes, pick up his socks, and turn off his podcast?”\n\n“Hmm… it’s rare with the podcast, but there are days he’s actually pretty tidy.”\n\n“What’s different on those days?”\n\n“Hmm… Usually, he’s been off work at least one day. He’s gotten a good night’s sleep, so he’s in a good mood.”\n\n“None of that has anything to do with you, right?”\n\n“Right.”\n\n“So, his behavior probably isn’t about you.”\n\n“You’re right. Wow, it feels better to see it that way.”\n\n“Good. But the behavior is still upsetting, right?”\n\n“Yeah, just not quite as much.”\n\n“Good. Now let’s work on finding a way for you and Biff to communicate about this that will be more productive and more likely to have the effect you want…”\n\nDo you not have time for bullshit? Do you not have time for a lot of things, actually? Do you like to get straight to the point and get clear, actionable answers? Then CBT may just be for you.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy is great for logical thinkers and problem-solvers. It’s a natural fit for meditators and people with a more stoic temperament.\n\nIf you love science and reason and don’t think anything has to be a mystery if you study it long enough, CBT will probably feel just right.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy is famous for being the therapy method with the strongest evidence base. This makes it a perfect choice for skeptics who aren’t interested in anything that seems “woo woo” or “out there.”\n\nYou walk into the therapy room. It makes you feel the same way your grandmother’s living room does. It even has the same warm color palette. There are a few cozy blankets draped over the back of the couch. The overstuffed cushions exhale as you sink into them. You feel at home here.\n\nYour therapist sits in an overstuffed chair. He asked in your first session whether you wanted the couch or the chair. He took the chair when you said you’d like to sit on the couch.\n\n“How are you? What would you like to talk about today?” he asks.\n\n“I’ve been feeling stuck. I’m really mad at myself because I’m not making progress on my goals. I’m already off my diet. I was only three weeks in. I’m never going to lose weight.”\n\n“That sounds painful. It also sounds like you’re being really hard on yourself.”\n\n“You’re right. I think about what I’ve learned from you about negative self-talk all the time. But it’s hard not to be hard on myself when I just can’t make progress.”\n\n“Can you tell me a little more about what ‘progress’ means for you right now?”\n\n“Well, I want to lose weight, that’s the big one. But I also want to work on my relationship with Gary, and I want to be more assertive at work. I’m trying to go out for more girls’ nights, and go to the gym more, and start going back to my art class.”\n\n“That sounds like a lot.”\n\n“Yeah, I guess. I guess it is. Do you think I shouldn’t be trying to do so much?”\n\n“What do you think?”\n\n“Ugh, you always ask me. I want to know what you think!”\n\n“I think it all sounds fine. These are all healthy things. But I wonder what ‘progress’ means to you? It sounds to me like you’re making progress.”\n\n“I’m doing a little bit of a lot of things, but not really getting anywhere with any of them. Especially not my weight.”\n\n“I thought you told me you had lost weight?”\n\n“Three pounds, yeah. But that’s nothing.”\n\n“How much would it have to be for you to consider it to be ‘something’—for it to be ‘progress’?”\n\n“I don’t know, maybe five? Ten? What do you think?”\n\n“I think ‘progress’ means forward motion, so one pound would be ‘progress’ to me, but that may not be what it means to you.”\n\n“I guess when you put it that way, it is.”\n\n“What way would you put it?”\n\n“I don’t know. You’ve got me thinking. I guess I’ve got to start somewhere. Anyone does. But I never give myself credit for starting. That’s probably why I quit working on things even when I’m making progress or getting some forward motion.”\n\n“I think that is a wise statement. I wonder—how would you feel if, everything else being the same, you told yourself a different story about what ‘progress’ means?”\n\n“A lot better. So maybe I’ll start there.”\n\nYou walk into the therapy room. Soft light slants through the window. You get into a white pleather chair in front of a tripod with a light bar. You lean back until your head is pressing against the headrest, the light bar now directly in your line of sight.\n\nYour therapist smiles at you from the other side of the light bar. “How are you doing today?” she asks.\n\n“Okay,” you say. “Honestly—not really okay. I’ve been a nervous wreck all day.”\n\n“Would you like to start by doing that breathing exercise that helps you regulate your nervous system?”\n\n“I’d love to,” you reply.\n\nShe leads you through a now-familiar exercise. As your breathing slows, your anxiety eases. Next, she helps you connect to your safe place. You close your eyes and visualize the place she helped you find in your first session with her—a place where you remember feeling calm, safe, and empowered. You’ve learned how to recreate that feeling by reconnecting to that memory.\n\n“Do you feel up to starting with the memory we talked about last session?” she asks.\n\n“I do,” you say. “Honestly, I think it’s part of why I’ve been nervous. But I know I’m ready, even if it’s hard.”\n\n“Good. I’m proud of you,” she says. “You’ve been making such amazing progress.”\n\nShe starts the light bar. You know what to do. Your eyes follow the green dot as it tracks from one side of the bar to the other.\n\n“Alright,” she says. “You’re in the apartment with your ex-fiancée. She’s just thrown a glass of wine in your face and told you that you’re a piece of trash, that the wedding is off, and that she’s been seeing someone else. On a scale of one to ten, how true is the statement, ‘I am unlovable’?”\n\n“Ooh. Nine.”\n\n“Okay, nine. What are you feeling? And where do you feel it in your body?”\n\n“I am feeling small. Ashamed. I feel it in my guts.”\n\n“And what would you rather believe in this moment?”\n\n“I am lovable. This isn’t my fault. I don’t deserve this.”\n\n“Which of those do you want to focus on?”\n\n“I am lovable.”\n\n“Okay. ‘I am lovable.’ How true is that in this moment on a scale of one to ten?”\n\n“One.”\n\n“Alright. Let’s focus on that moment, how you feel, where you feel it, and the negative belief, ‘I am unlovable.'”\n\nYou keep all of that in mind while following the cursor on the light bar for about 30 seconds.\n\n“Alright, what do you notice?”\n\n“I feel a hot sensation in my spine. I want to crawl into the wall and disappear.”\n\n“Okay, go with that.”\n\nYou follow the light bar for another 30 seconds, then tell your therapist what you noticed that time.\n\nYou repeat this process several times. The things you notice help you make new connections.\n\nSometimes, mental images come up. Sometimes it’s thoughts or beliefs. Sometimes it’s physical sensations or emotions.\n\nSomewhere in the course of the session, the images and feelings start to feel a little lighter, a little less painful.\n\n“Okay, it’s about time to wrap up. Let’s revisit ‘I am unlovable.’ How true does that feel right now?”\n\n“Hmm, I can’t believe it, but only a 3 or 4. It’s still there but not at all like it was.”\n\n“And what about, ‘I am lovable’?”\n\n“I’d say that’s a six now. Maybe a seven?”\n\n“Good. We’ll need to revisit this, but we’ve made a lot of progress today.”\n\nShe closes the session by guiding you through some slower eye movements and back to a visualization of your safe place.\n\nYou walk into the therapy office. You love the view through the big picture window: a stream winds through the backyard and disappears into the woods beyond. Birds chitter and chirp as they swoop in to grab some seeds from the bird feeders. Wind chimes tinkle in the wind.\n\nThe blades of a ceiling fan flip lazily around. You settle into a funky, but comfortable green couch. You pull your sock feet up under you.\n\n“How are you doing today?” your therapist asks. She sips from a cup of tea. You pick up and sip yours. The sound of a fountain adds to the calming atmosphere.\n\n“I’m kind of a mess,” you tell her. “I’ve been stuck in negative thoughts all week. Low-key obsessed. I’m still so pissed about what happened. I’m having a hard time calming down or focusing on anything.”\n\n“I can tell you’re tense. Would you like to start with a progressive relaxation exercise?”\n\n“Sure,” you say.\n\nYou do the same exercise at home, or at least you try to, but it seems so much better when you do it here. You can focus so much more easily, let go of your day so much more fully when you’re in your therapist’s office.\n\n“Alright,” your therapist says after closing the exercise, “I think it might be good to do some cognitive behavioral therapy today. What do you think?”\n\nYou’ve done some EMDR sessions with her before, and you know today isn’t a good day for that. Some days you just talk and explore. You’ve done some inner child work together, too, and some guided visualizations.\n\nBut you know she’s right. The negative thinking has just been so dominant lately, and you need to deal with it before you’ll be able to focus on anything else.\n\n“I think that’s a great idea. I’ve been trying to apply some of the CBT stuff we’ve done before, but I feel rusty, and these particular thoughts are just so intense.”\n\n“Okay, great. What would you say your worst thought has been this week? Which one is making you the most upset?”\n\n“That this is how it always goes for me. No matter how hard I work or how good of a person I try to be, it doesn’t matter. The harder I work, the more I help, the less anybody seems to care. It’s like it gives them a reason to not care anymore. It’s like they lose respect for me. I dunno, I guess that’s a lot of thoughts.”\n\n“No, that’s fine. That’s good. Let’s start with this idea that people don’t respect you or stop caring about you. What evidence do you have that this is true?”\n\n“Well, there’s this guy Dan, who I was assigned to work with on this project that has been such a disaster. He checked in with me a lot and was doing a lot in the beginning, but now he doesn’t do anything and hardly says anything to me. I’m basically having to do it all myself.”\n\nThe session continues, and you unpack the thoughts that have been bothering you. By the end of the session, you feel like you understand the situation better and see that it’s not an intentional personal attack. You leave the session with a renewed determination to communicate more openly about your needs and to set better boundaries with Dan and with other people at work."
