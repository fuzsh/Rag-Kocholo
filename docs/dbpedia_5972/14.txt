Sometimes love is so strong that people will do anything to be together. This is the case with MAD LOVE. When Matt played by Chris O’Donnell sees Casey, the new girl at school played by Drew Barrymore, he is smitten by her beauty and charms. Burdened by the responsibilities of caring for his twin younger siblings, Matt attempts to win Casey and her care-free spirit by buying her a free ticket to a rock concert and then conveniently shows up while she stands in line to enter the concert. Matt and Casey fall madly in love and he discovers that she is a rebel. After Casey is put into a psychiatric hospital by her parents, Matt breaks her out, and they take a road trip to New Mexico, where they discover that help, healing and wholeness are actually found back at home.

MAD LOVE is a well-acted but flawed movie. The first half plays like a light drama/comedy, while the second half is dark and somber. Numerous questions are raised, but left unanswered. In fact, the whole film merely glosses over serious themes like suicide, depression and infatuation. Today’s teenagers deserve a better treatment. Finally, several obscenities, profanities and depiction’s of fornication lend to the false premise that mad teenage love is free of any moral consequences.
