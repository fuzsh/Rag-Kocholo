Decalogue89+ presents ten incredible stories from ten young directors: ten films that will change the face of cinema forever and leave audiences deep in thought. Led by the renowned Polish director Andrzej Mańkowski, Decalogue89+ is the definitive portrait of youth in the modern world.\n\nFor this incredible project, thousands of young people from across the world submitted their stories. These tales were adapted by dozens of gifted filmmakers, each competing for a shot at the silver screen. The result is a stunning tribute to Krzysztof Kieslowski's masterpiece: \"The Decalogue\" which, even twenty years after its inception, is a monument of European cinema.\n\nThis two volume production unveils the day-to-day realities of Europe's most incredible cities as shown through the prism of youth. These ten stories – five per volume – show the ambitions, challenges, and passions of youth, each one representing one of the 10 Commandments applied to the real world. Decalogue89+ was not only the perfect opportunity for teens to express themselves but also for adults to understand them.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nSee the first five of God's Ten Commandments brought to life in the initial volume of the ambitious Decalogue89+. Films like The Newbie, Real, My Poor Head, Street Feeling and Yoko Ono's Cups take viewers on a journey through the deep realities of life, love, good, and evil. These dramatic stories show why it's wrong to steal, to covet your neighbour's goods (or his wife), and even what can happen by taking the Lord's name in vain.\n\nTrivia:\n\n• The coordinator of the project, Andrzej Mańkowski, is a renowned director and winner of multiple festivals, including the Silver Medal at the Film Festival URTI in Monte Carlo for his documentary The Music Lesson. He also has been recognized by the Mayor of Gdyna with the Art Award."
