The multidisciplinary festival, which takes its name from a quotation by the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, spans 12 venues and features numerous musical traditions and genres. It will include 30 performances, films, and events and feature eight premieres, plus new works and debuts by artists and companies from the United States, Australia, Germany, Pakistan, Poland, the U.K. and South Africa.\n\nOne of the festival's key highlights includes Krzysztof Kie&sacute;lowski’s acclaimed 10-part film series The Decalogue.

The complete cycle of 10 self-contained, hour-long “episodes” will be shown over the course of a weekend, making possible an immersive experience into Krzysztof Kie&sacute;lowski’s enigmatic and poignantly human world.\n\nTo accompany the screening of The Decalogue, the White Light Festival will present a White Light Conversation entitled “The Evolution of Morality,” which will examine the role of morality in human evolution featuring noteworthy experts in human psychology, religion, neuroscience and anthropology. The discussion will take place on Saturday, October 25 from 3:45-5:15 PM in the Walter Reade Theater and will be moderated by John Schaefer.\n\nThe opening night of White Light on Film’s screenings of The Decalogue will be introduced by Annette Insdorf, Columbia University Film Professor and author of Double Lives, Second Chances: The Cinema of Krzysztof Kieslowski.\n\nFriday, October 24, 2014 at 7:30 pm\n\nDecalogue, Parts One and Two (110 minutes)\n\nSaturday, October 25, 2014 at 1:00 pm\n\nDecalogue, Parts Three and Four, 110 minutes\n\nSaturday, October 25, 2014 at 7:00 pm\n\nDecalogue, Parts Five and Six, 114 minutes\n\nSunday, October 26, 2014 at 2:00 pm\n\nDecalogue, Parts Seven and Eight, 110 minutes\n\nSunday, October 26, 2014 at 4:30 pm\n\nDecalogue, Parts Nine and Ten,115 minutes\n\nOther highlights of the festival include the U.S. premiere of Peter Sellars’ groundbreaking production of St. Matthew Passion, Australia’s Circa avant-garde circus troupe, and early music choir, Britten’s Curlew River, amongst many other events."
