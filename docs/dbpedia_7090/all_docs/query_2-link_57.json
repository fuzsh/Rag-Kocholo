        "text": "Krzysztof Kieślowski (born June 27, 1941, Warsaw, Poland—died March 13, 1996, Warsaw) was a leading Polish director of documentaries, feature films, and television films of the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s that explore the social and moral themes of contemporary times.\n\nKieślowski studied theatre technology in Warsaw, and in 1968 he graduated from the State Theatrical and Film College in Łódź, Poland. He began his film career making documentaries, including one he had made for Polish television before graduating, Zdjęcie (1968; The Photograph). His first significant film was Murarz (1973; The Bricklayer), the story of a political activist who becomes disenchanted with politics and returns to his former profession of bricklaying. Kieślowski made several notable documentaries during the 1970s, mostly for television, including Szpital (1976; Hospital), in which he employed a hidden camera to reveal problems within the Polish health care system. The documentary short Z punktu widzenia nocnego portiera (1979; From a Night Porter’s Point of View) centres on a watchman with totalitarian views of the world.\n\nBlizna (1976; The Scar) was Kieślowski’s first theatrical release; it focused on management-labour relations within Polish industry. He came to worldwide attention with Amator (1979; Camera Buff), an autobiographical work about an aspiring documentary director who learns the consequences of artistic expression. With Przypadek (1987; Blind Chance), he experimented with narrative. The film traces three fateful directions a medical student’s life may take as he rushes to board a train.\n\nKieślowski’s Bez końca (1985; No End), the story of a dead lawyer who watches over his family as they continue with their lives, marked the beginning of a longtime writing collaboration with Krzysztof Piesiewicz. Kieślowski’s mammoth Dekalog (1988–89; Decalogue), cowritten with Piesiewicz, is a series inspired by the Ten Commandments and made for Polish television. Each of the 10 hour-long episodes explores at least one commandment; as the commandments are not explicitly named, the audience is invited to identify the moral or ethical conflicts in the plot. The series was shown in its entirety as the centrepiece of the 1989 Venice Film Festival and is considered a modern masterpiece of cinema. Two of the episodes were expanded into feature-length films: Krótki film o zabijaniu (A Short Film About Killing) and Krótki film o miłości (A Short Film About Love), both of which were released in 1988. With La Double Vie de Véronique (1991; The Double Life of Veronique) came commercial as well as critical success. This moody, atmospheric film is the study of two doppelgängers—one French, one Polish—who, in addition to sharing the same name, share the same birthday, heart condition, and a vague sense of the existence of the other. Cowritten with Piesiewicz, the film stars Irene Jacob in the dual roles.\n\nKieślowski’s and Piesiewicz’s next efforts, the Three Colours trilogy, represented the colours of the French flag: Bleu (1993; Blue), Blanc (1994; White), and Rouge (1994; Red); respectively, they explored the themes of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The films were released several months apart and, although each can stand on its own, they were designed to be seen as a single entity. One theme, the frailty of human relations, emerged from the lonely awakening in Blue and permeated the grim humour of White before providing the symbolic epiphany in Red. Kieślowski was nominated for an Academy Award for best director for Red."
