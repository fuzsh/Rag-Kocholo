        "text": "HOW often are we to be introduced to ''The Decalogue''? As most movie fanatics agree, this series of hourlong films, made for Polish television in 1988 by Krzysztof Kieslowski, deserves to be known as widely as the Ten Commandments that inspired it. Then again, the Commandments were given only once. The release of a spiffy new DVD set of ''The Decalogue,'' issued on three discs by Facets Video, is by my count the series' fourth entry into the United States market.\n\nIntimations of ''The Decalogue'' reached America in 1989, when an expanded version of its fifth episode played the festival circuit. (For some, it was a tough introduction. At the New York Film Festival, the hall almost emptied during the murder sequence, prompting one Kieslowski admirer to mutter at a fleeing patron, ''It's called 'A Short Film About Killing.' What did you think you were getting?'') The following year, all 10 films of ''The Decalogue'' popped up at the Museum of Modern Art. I recall an 11-hour day spent at MoMA -- there was a lunch break -- that left me loopy from all that moral choice and cinematic panache.\n\nAs I learned, Kieslowski and his co-writer, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, had stitched ''The Decalogue'' together by situating all the characters within the same complex of concrete high-rises. (Kieslowski chose this location, he said, because it was ''the most beautiful housing project in Warsaw.'') A character who had faced and perhaps failed a moral challenge in one film might be transformed into a mere extra in the next, passing through the background. Meanwhile, in episode after episode, a mysterious, silent figure kept materializing in the neighborhood, like an observing angel.\n\nYet despite such unifying elements -- another of which was the extraordinarily sensitive musical score by Zbigniew Preisner -- the look of ''The Decalogue'' turned out to be dizzyingly varied, Kieslowski having used a different cinematographer for each film. (At least he meant to; he did repeat himself, once.) The range of moods was equally astonishing: from the intense foreboding of the first episode's father-and-son story (''Thou shalt have no other gods before me'') to the yearning for reconciliation in the eighth episode, with its recollection of the Holocaust (''Thou shalt not bear false witness''), to the rubber-faced comedy that concluded the series (''Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods, including his postage stamps''). Most diverse of all, and most absorbing, were the personalities of the dozens of actors who inhabited ''The Decalogue.'' As Roger Ebert states in his on-screen introduction to the new DVD, ''The faces are where the life of the film resides.''\n\nBy the time museumgoers got to discover those faces, though, general audiences in the United States were out of luck. The firm that had bought the North American distribution rights was flummoxed by what it had acquired. Unable to work out a plan for theatrical release -- weekly installments? marathon screenings? -- and unwilling to license ''The Decalogue'' for home video, the company let its asset languish, except for the occasional non-commercial presentation. In March 1996, for example -- the very month when Kieslowski died of a heart attack, at 54 -- the Film Society of Lincoln Center showed ''The Decalogue'' over the course of a week at the Walter Reade Theater.\n\nNot until 2000 did ''The Decalogue'' receive its commercial debut here -- and even then, you had to look fast. In April of that year, an ad hoc consortium (which included Facets) was allowed to bring out the first American video release, issued on five tapes or two discs, which were available only until the distributor's contract lapsed. In June 2000, another member of the consortium, New Yorker Films, got to open ''The Decalogue'' theatrically, for limited runs.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
