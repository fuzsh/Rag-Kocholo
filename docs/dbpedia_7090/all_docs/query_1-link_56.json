Born in 1941, Kieslowski studied at the Lodz Film School, training ground for such directors as Andrzej Wajda and Roman Polanski, and was drawn to documentary film as a reaction against the lack of attention given to Poland's social reality by its leaders. “If something hasn't been described, then it doesn't officially exist. If we describe it, we bring it to life,” he said. But all Kieslowski's films, both his Polish works and the later films made in France, are remarkable for an ability to move beyond the surface realism of cinema, to grasp something more personal, more spiritual. His concerns often seem more literary than cinematic; expressing abstract ideals through concrete details, his films ask one question above all: what makes a person “good”?\n\nThe Pacific Film Archive is proud to present an almost complete retrospective-including rarely screened early documentaries and shorts-of this director whose reputation has only grown since his untimely death ten years ago. “To call Kieslowski the premier filmmaker of the last two decades seems hardly enough,” wrote The Los Angeles Times. “Without him, the international film scene . . . is definitely a sadder and lonelier place.”\n\nJason Sanders\n\nTHOU SHALT SEE THE ENTIRE DECALOGUE, AT A DISCOUNTED RATE!\n\nDue to the extraordinary expense of presenting this work, PFA's second-feature discount will not apply to screenings of The Decalogue.
