        "text": "The Decalogue (Complete Collection)\n\n\" There is not a moment when the characters talk about specific commandments or moral issues. Instead, they are absorbed in trying to deal\n\nwith real-life ethical challenges.\" - Roger Ebert\n\nConsidered by many critics to be one of the greatest movie achievements, Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Decalogue explores the timeless moral issues of human existence through ten contemporary tales, each based on one of the Ten Commandments. Originally produced for Polish television, this brilliant series of ten separate but subtly intertwining films transcended the boundaries of film and TV, winning honors in both arenas as it played around the world. The Decalogue won the FIPRESCI Award at the 1989 Venice Film Festival, was honored as Best Foreign Television Program by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and was named Best Foreign Language Film by the Chicago Film Critics Association in 1997. Each episode was co-written by Kieslowski's longtime collaborator Krzysztof Piesiewicz and features music by Zbigniew Preisner.
