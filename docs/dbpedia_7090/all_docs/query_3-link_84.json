And while it is currently available in a decent DVD box set from Facets, a release from The Criterion Collection has long been expected, and it looks like it might getting a bit closer to happening.\n\nREAD MORE: The 10 Best Cannes Film Festival Lineups Ever\n\nFrench production company MK2 has given Kieslowski’s ten-part series a new 2K restoration, and it will start rolling out in France this month, and a brief, but no less exciting trailer has arrived. If you’re new to “The Decalogue,” it’s a ten-part drama, with each installment telling a separate story inspired by one of the ten commandments, though they are all set among a housing project in Warsaw. It’s masterful, beautiful stuff and a must-watch for any cinephile, and hopefully this new cleaned up version means a fresh home video release is around the corner."
