        "text": "The most acclaimed cinematic event in Europe over the last year has not been, strictly speaking, a movie, but Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"Decalogue\" -- a 10-part series originally made for Polish television. Whether applauded at film festivals from Cannes to San Sebastian in Spain or heavily attended in a theatrical run in Paris, these one-hour dramatizations loosely based on the Ten Commandments have catapulted Mr. Kieslowski into the international limelight.\n\nBeginning Friday and continuing through Nov. 10, the Museum of Modern Art will present \"The Decalogue\" in its entirety. One can see an episode or two each day or a marathon screening of all 10 segments on Nov. 11. Episodes Five and Six -- \"A Short Film About Killing\" and \"A Short Film About Love\" -- two feature-length segments that have won multiple prizes, may be seen, respectively, on Nov. 13 and 15.\n\nIn either dosage, Mr. Kieslowski's ambitious fresco offers a profound vision of human fallibility. Each film is a self-contained whole, but because of the interlocking structure major characters from one episode pop up in the background of others. The films are further linked by locale (all take place in the same Warsaw apartment complex); a haunting score by the composer Zbigniew Preisner; and an unnamed young man who appears silently, momentarily and inexplicably in each episode.\n\nThe 49-year-old director has been making provocative movies in his native Poland for 20 years. His works include \"Camera Buff,\" winner of the grand prize at the Moscow and Chicago Film Festivals of 1979, and \"A Short Film About Killing,\" which won the jury prize at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival, as well as the first European equivalent of the Academy Award later that year. \"The Decalogue\" extends his exploration of what he calls \"the contradiction between complicated characters and simple stories.\"\n\nIn a recent telephone interview from Warsaw, Mr. Kieslowski explained that he and his co-writer, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, originally intended to parcel out \"The Decalogue\" to 10 different directors. \"But I liked doing the first film so much,\" he admitted in Polish, \"that I didn't want to give the others away.\" The result was that he shot and edited all 10 films over a 21-month period, using different cinematographers for each episode: \"Sometimes I'd shoot part of one film in the morning, part of a second in another location in the afternoon, and a different one in the evening. That kept me from getting bored.\"\n\nDespite ludicrously short rehearsal time and limited film stock, the director enlisted a remarkable cast, blending stars like Daniel Olbrychski and Krystyna Janda with unknown actors. \"At one point,\" he recalled, \"it seemed like you could divide the Polish film industry into two groups: those who took part in 'The Decalogue' and those who didn't.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
