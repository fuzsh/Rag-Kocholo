        "text": "Entertainment One has come on board to produce The Decalogue, a limited series re-imagining of the celebrated Polish 10-part series by the late Oscar-nominated Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (Three Colors).\n\nThe 1989 original Dekalog, which Kieslowski co-wrote with his writing partner Kyzysztof Piesiewicz, was set in Poland and consisted of 10 one-hour films, each inspired by one of the Ten Commandments and each directed by Kieslowski. NBC’s adaptation is set in Boston and will similarly explore the moral and ethical issues that are central to the Ten Commandments. It is being written by Todd Ellis Kessler (The Good Wife). He executive produces along with Stephen McPherson via his Wonder Monkey banner as well as Debra Stasson and Beata Pisula.\n\neOne will distribute the series worldwide, with Carrie Stein, EVP of Global Productions; and Gerard Bocaccio, SVP US Scripted Development, overseeing for the studio.\n\nReleased just as democracy was starting to take hold, The Decalogue had a big influence on the first post-communism generation of filmmakers in Eastern Europe. It garnered a slew of international prizes, including the FIPRESCI Award at the Venice Film Festival, and has been named to the National Society of Film Critics’ list of 100 Essential Films."
