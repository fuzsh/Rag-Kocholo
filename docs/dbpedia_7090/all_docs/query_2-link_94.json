        "text": "The actress agonizes on her deathbed, her hair and makeup impeccable, as the hunky male lead clutches her hand. Tears pour down his face as her eyelids flutter to a final close.\n\nThe scene oozes with the over-the-top drama that makes Brazil’s prime-time soap operas as much of a national institution as soccer or Carnival. However, in this case, the actors aren’t playing wealthy sophisticates with complicated sex lives, but characters out of the Old Testament.\n\nSet in ancient Egypt and loosely based on the story of Moses, The Ten Commandments is billed as Brazil’s first biblical soap opera. Swathed in Egyptian robes and sporting lapis lazuli jewelry and Cleopatra wigs, some of the characters are based on biblical or other historic figures, while others are invented.\n\nThe soap is taking the country by storm. It’s helped propel the Rede Record television network, owned by the founder of Brazil’s main Pentecostal church, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, into a showdown with top broadcaster Globo, which for decades has had a lock on prime-time soaps, known as novelas.\n\nSome suggest that the surprise success of The Ten Commandments lies in the show’s family-oriented script.\n\n“There is a more conservative audience in Brazil that we’ve seen is quite strong,” said Bruno Dieguez, a communications professor at Rio’s Pontifical Catholic University.\n\nThat audience includes a burgeoning evangelical community, which now accounts for one-fifth of the population of around 200 million. In the world’s largest Catholic country, members of that majority faith also tend to be social conservatives, especially in rural areas.\n\n“They now feel they have an alternative [to Globo]and they’re tuning in,” Dieguez said.\n\nSince its debut in March, The Ten Commandments has attracted about three times as many viewers as Record’s previous prime-time offerings, boosting the network from its typical third-place standing into second place, network officials said.\n\nIn one recent episode, a male character based on the historic 13th century BC Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II held vigil over the deathbed of his fictitious wife, Maya, after she was poisoned by a jealous rival.\n\nAn earlier time slot for the program, which begins at 8.30pm six nights a week and competes with Globo’s national news program, also seems to have helped the show’s success.\n\nGlobo’s Babilonia, a tale of female vengeance set in contemporary Rio de Janeiro, remains the most popular. It nevertheless has been panned by critics and subsequently had its run cut by three weeks.\n\nBabilonia especially offended conservatives with a kiss between two of Brazil’s most famous actresses playing an elderly lesbian couple in its first episode.\n\nDespite its international reputation as a sexually liberated, gay-friendly country, Brazil has many people who view homosexuality as immoral.\n\nOne day after the lesbian kiss on Babilonia, Brazil’s most influential Pentecostal pastor, Silas Malafaia of the Assemblies of God church, called the show “an instrument of moral rot” in a blog post he linked to on Twitter, where he has nearly 900,000 followers. He blasted Globo as “the biggest sponsor of immorality and homosexuality in Brazil”.\n\nMalafaia and Record have denied involvement in an anonymous petition that later circulated on Facebook urging viewers to boycott Babilonia. But Record has nevertheless capitalized on the controversy.\n\nNetwork brass gives most of the credit for the success of The Ten Commandments to the quality of its production. Each of its 150 episodes costs around $230,000 to produce, with extravagant sets, on-location shoots in Chile and Egypt and special effects.\n\nBut Record officials also assert the family-friendly content has played a major role.\n\n“Whether you like it or not, the public is still very traditional,” said Anderson Souza, who oversees soaps at Record. “Families want to be able to peacefully sit down in the living room and not worry about … being embarrassed.”\n\nThe network is now negotiating with Fox’s Spanish-language channel, MundoFox, to sell the US rights, Souza said.\n\nOn a recent balmy night at a tiny hair salon in Rio’s Dona Marta slum, all eyes were glued to a television showing The Ten Commandments, as were customers in the bar and cafe across the street.\n\n“In my opinion, there should only be soaps like this one — to teach about the Bible, about family and values,” hairdresser Cristiana da Silva said, dividing her attention between the evening’s last customer and the action on screen. “This is the best soap.”"
