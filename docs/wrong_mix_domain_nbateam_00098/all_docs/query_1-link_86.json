        "text": "Michael Jordan celebrated his 61st birthday on 17 February. His age may be a limiting factor, but the muscle memory of playing basketball and his incredible competitive spirit have even a 43-year-old Richard Jefferson saying MJ would get at least seven points on him. RJ is just four years older than LeBron James, who's still dominating the NBA at 39 years old. But not everybody ages like LeBron.\n\nJefferson hasn't aged the same way as LeBron but the 17-year NBA veteran is in tremendous shape still. His NBA career ended six years ago, but even with that, I'd back him in a 1-on-1 against Jordan at this age. When it comes to other analysts like Kendrick Perkins, I think Jordan would take the win there, even at age 61.\n\nRichard Jefferson Was Outplayed By A 40-Year-Old Michael Jordan\n\nWe shouldn't be quick to dismiss the playing ability of a former player in their 40s, that's why I would back Jefferson in a one-on-one against Jordan. But that is also going by what we saw a 40-year-old Jordan achieve in the NBA during his career-ending stint with the Washington Wizards from 2001 to 2003.\n\nJordan averaged 21.2 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 4.4 assists during his Wizards tenure, proving he could be a high-value player in the NBA even at that age. While those numbers didn't result in winning\n\nJefferson was drafted by the New Jersey Nets in 2001 and got to lace up against Jordan multiple times. They faced off in seven games over two seasons. In those games, the Nets came out on top over the Wizards with an overall record of 5-2 as they were a contending roster. However, Jordan outplayed RJ on the court.\n\nJordan averaged 22.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.0 assists in those contests, while Jefferson averaged 15.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.3 assists. RJ was a valuable win-now player for the Nets and made two NBA Finals appearances with the franchise as MJ sailed off into the sunset after arguably the greatest career in NBA history."
