John Kuntz, cleveland.com\n\n(John Kuntz)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- Richard Jefferson was excused from the Cavs game against the Sacramento Kings because of the birth of his child.\n\nThe team announced late in the first quarter that Jefferson, 36, a reserve forward, was excused \"to handle a personal matter. His return to the team will be updated at the appropriate time.\"\n\nSources confirmed it was to attend to the birth of his child -- a boy -- but it's not exactly a secret. Jefferson disclosed his son was on the way in a recent podcast he does with teammate Channing Frye and Fox Sports Ohio personality Allie Clifton.\n\nThe child is Jefferson's second son."
