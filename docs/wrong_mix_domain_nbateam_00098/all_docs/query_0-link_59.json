        "text": "CHICAGO -- As the Cleveland Cavaliers prepare to begin their postseason defense of last season's NBA championship, keeping players fresh will be a top priority for Tyronn Lue.\n\nThe Cavaliers enter Thursday night's game against the Chicago Bulls having lost four of their last six games, and they are 6-9 this month. But, as Cleveland approaches the end of the season, Lue has made it clear the big picture -- not the short term -- will be the focus.\n\nAfter Cleveland's 103-74 loss to San Antonio on Monday night, Lue told reporters he was considering resting key players for large chunks of time over Cleveland's final nine games.\n\nBut that will apparently start after Thursday's test against the Bulls, who are a win away from sweeping the season series. According to Cleveland.com, Lue plans to play his full contingent of stars against the Bulls. The lone exception is Kyle Korver, who will miss Thursday's game in Chicago and Sunday's game against the 76ers because of an injury to his left foot.\n\nGuard Iman Shumpert is expected to return Thursday after missing the previous two games with right knee soreness. Forward Richard Jefferson did not practice Wednesday with knee tendinitis, Cleveland.com reported.\n\nWhile LeBron James, who left Monday's game with back stiffness, and Cleveland's other mainstays are expected to be on the floor against the Bulls, Lue said that may not be the case in the days following.\n\n\"I'm going to do what's best for the team and each individual,\" Lue told reporters on Wednesday, according to Cleveland.com. \"We've got a lot of games coming up and we've got to get some kind of rhythm established going into the playoffs.\n\n\"It's going to be a game-to-game basis, just seeing how guys feel. If they need (rest), if it's the best thing for us, then we have to do it.\"\n\nWhile the Cavaliers are preparing for another long playoff run, the Bulls are hoping to just be in the conversation.\n\nThe Bulls (35-39) have struggled over their last 10 games and continue to not play well against other underperforming teams. While Chicago has been perfect against Cleveland this season, the Bulls must find a way to match those kind of efforts the rest of the way if they hope to avoid missing the playoffs for a second straight season. They sit 1 1/2 games out of a playoff spot after the Miami Heat defeated the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers fell to the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg admits to doing a certain amount of scoreboard watching in a crowded Eastern Conference playoff picture, he said his team must ultimately take care of its business.\n\n\"You do keep an eye on what other teams are doing,\" Hoiberg said, according to CSN Chicago. \"But, at the same time, we talk every day how it's up to us. We've got to go out and play with purpose, play with energy every time we step on the floor and give ourselves a chance to win. Hopefully, if we do those things, we'll be there at the end.\"\n\nVeteran guard Rajon Rondo, who has taken on a bigger role since Dwyane Wade left the lineup with an elbow injury, has made it clear that the Bulls can't afford to waste time.\n\n\"I just try to look at what we're doing and control what we can control,\" Rondo said, according to CSN Chicago. \"We're not playing against the other teams we're racing (to get into the playoffs), so we've got eight (games) left and we want to take advantage of all eight.\""
