        "text": "I started Blue Wire with $17K of my own dollars. It was an all-in move for me at the time. A vision of bringing together independent podcasters kept flashing in my mind. If we banded together, could we really compete with the big guys in sports media? After years of hard work from our team and podcasters, we have the foundation in place to become something big. Strength In Numbers is not a corny cliché; it’s one of the most powerful things in sports and business. That’s why today we’re opening our doors for anyone to become an angel investor in Blue Wire — creators, listeners, believers in podcasting, and first-time angel investors. It's got us thinking ... we put together an all-star team of investors including Wynn Resorts, my alma mater East Carolina, Dot Capital and Baron Davis. Why stop there? What if anyone could be on our team? “I looked at Blue Wire and said this is a perfect opportunity to be in the podcast space,” Davis said recently at a conference. “The company has great vision, great intuition, and they care about what they’re building.” -If you love one of our 300 shows, or podcasting in general, this is an opportunity for you. -If you’ve ever wanted to place a future bet on a private sports company, this is an opportunity for you. Independent podcasters are building thriving content businesses, and Blue Wire’s sales infrastructure can support this explosive growth. We’ve closed more than $20M in revenue since 2020, splitting these dollars with shows that are changing the fabric of sports media. Chris Long’s Green Light, Richard Jefferson’s Road Trippin’, ArsenalVision, Light Years, Bronx Pinstripes -- hundreds of these athlete and fan voices matter in media, and Blue Wire is helping them become louder, reaching millions of listeners together. We're not The Athletic or Substack with a $500M+ valuation. We don't have venture capitalists controlling our company. At a $25M valuation today, the room for growth in the short-term is staggering, and we can do it at our pace without flying off the rails. I'm grateful and energized to grow Blue Wire the next 10+ years. Podcasting is in its early innings. This is an open invitation to come join our team"
