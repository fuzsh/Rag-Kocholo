        "text": "The YES Network, the most-watched regional sports network in the country for 18 of the last 21 years, is the exclusive regional television home of the 27-time World Champion New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Nets. The network has won 146 New York Emmy Awards since its 2002 launch.\n\nFrom 2020-23, Carter was an NBA and college basketball studio and game analyst at ESPN, where he also appeared on programs such as NBA Today, Countdown, Get Up and First Take. In addition, he hosted Vince’s Places.\n\nWhile working for ESPN, Carter was also an analyst for Bally Sports Southeast’s Atlanta Hawks telecasts during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons and for Bally Sports Florida’s Orlando Magic telecasts during the 2022-23 season.\n\nCarter was named a McDonald’s All-American in 1995 while at Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Fla. He then played three seasons at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, helping lead the Tar Heels to the 1997 and 1998 Final Fours. The Golden State Warriors selected him as the fifth overall pick of the 1998 NBA Draft before immediately being traded to the Toronto Raptors, where he played through 2004.\n\nCarter’s NBA career spanned 22 years, the longest playing career in NBA history. He won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award in 1998-99. Carter, whose nicknames included “Air Canada,” “Hi C” and “Vinsanity,” was named to the NBA All-Star Game eight times and was a member of the United States Men’s National Basketball team that won a Gold Medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.\n\nIn addition to the Raptors and Nets, Carter played for the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings, Magic and Hawks. He scored 25,728 points in his career, good for 20th on the NBA all-time list.\n\nOff the court, he established the Embassy of Hope Foundation, providing vital assistance to children and their families in New Jersey, Florida and Ontario.\n\nAfter a year away from the mic, he came back again to YES in 2011 and has been with the network ever since. Cone has won four New York Emmy Awards while at YES.\n\nThe YES Network, the most-watched regional sports network in the country 18 of the last 21 years, is the exclusive regional television home of the 27-time World Champion New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Nets. The network has won 146 New York Emmy Awards since its 2002 launch.\n\nIn January 2022, it was announced that Cone would become a game analyst on ESPN’s Sunday Night Baseball telecasts in addition to his YES duties. In 2019, Cone collaborated on a book with YES colleague Jack Curry called “Full Count: The Education Of A Pitcher,” which was a New York Times best-seller.\n\nCone compiled a 194-126 record, 3.46 ERA and 2,688 strikeouts in his 17-year major league career. He captured the American League Cy Young Award in 1994 and was a five-time All-Star (1988, 1992, 1994, 1997 and 1999). The Kansas City, Mo. native, known for coming up big in critical games, posted an 8-3 post-season record and played on five world championship teams: the 1992 Blue Jays and the 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000 Yankees.\n\nThe flame-throwing right-hander was drafted by the hometown Kansas City Royals in the third round of the 1981 amateur draft and made his major league debut with the Royals in 1986.
