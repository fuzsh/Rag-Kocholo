        "text": "Sean Miller is averaging one NBA player a season in his 10 years at Arizona while Lute Olson still has two pros in the league despite the fact he last coached the Wildcats 11 years ago.\n\nRawle Alkins’ call up to the Chicago Bulls on Friday makes it 12 former Arizona players in the NBA overall. The two from the Olson era are Golden State’s Andre Iguodala and Cleveland’s Channing Frye.\n\nJason Terry (19-year NBA veteran) and Richard Jefferson (17 years) — the two longest standing Arizona players in the NBA — are no longer in the league.\n\nAlkins, a rookie who went undrafted, was averaging 15.5 points and 6.0 rebounds a game for the Bulls’ G-League affiliate Windy City at the time of his call-up.\n\nOther former Miller-recruited players at Arizona are thriving in other pro leagues (see list below).\n\nNotables:\n\n— Kyle Fogg, who was recruited to Arizona by Olson’s staff but played under Miller, collected his third triple-double of the season (and second in last three games) in China by posting 43 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists yesterday for Guangzhou.\n\n— Since returning to the Austin Spurs from free agency on Nov. 18, Nick Johnson has averaged 21.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 1.4 steals per game on 45 percent shooting from the field and 45 percent from 3-point range on 5.7 attempts per game.\n\n— Jerryd Bayless, another Olson-recruited player but did not play under the coach, was traded from Philadelphia to Minnesota in the recent Jimmy Butler trade. He has still yet to play for the Timberwolves because of a sprained knee.\n\n— Chance Comanche has yet to play for the Serbian pro team KK Partizan after playing last season in the G League. Comanche is a teammate of Anthony Brown’s with KK Partizan. Brown, of Los Angeles, was a one-time Arizona recruiting target who played with Stanford.\n\nArizona Players In The Pros\n\nSource: RealGM.com\n\n[table “” not found /]\n\nFOLLOW @JAVIERJMORALES ON TWITTER!"
