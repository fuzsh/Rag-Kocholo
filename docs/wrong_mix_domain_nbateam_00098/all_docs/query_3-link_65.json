        "text": "Richard Jefferson says Chet Holmgren deserved Rookie of the Year\n\nA hot take considering the Thunder’s big man was in the room The Road Trippin’ Show, hosted by Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye and Allie Clifton, calls\n\nRichard Jefferson: Chet Holmgren’s numbers would’ve been ‘equally as ridiculous’ as Wemby’s if he were on Spurs\n\nRichard Jefferson — who won the only title of his NBA career back with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016 — argued that Oklahoma City Thunder big man Chet Holmgren would have put up stats similar to what Victor Wembanyama put up if he had played for the San Antonio Spurs during the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nThe Hornets got a very difficult cup draw\n\nOn Friday, the NBA announced the groups for the second annual In-Season Tournament, now known as the Emirates NBA Cup because Emirates can’t help themselves from sponsoring cups.\n\nRichard Jefferson On Why Losing Klay Thompson Was Such A Big Blow To The Lakers\n\nIn a recent episode of the 'Road Trippin' podcast, former NBA swingman Richard Jefferson gave his candid take on the Lakers' 2024 offseason. According to Jefferson, losing out on Klay Thompson, who signed with the Mavericks this summer, was a major blow to their chances to contend next season.\n\nRichard Jefferson shares true story about Warriors’ Klay Thompson disrespect\n\nKlay Thompson is joining the Dallas Mavericks after agreeing to a $50 million sign-and-trade with the Golden State Warriors. Thompson has spent his entire career with the Warriors but is now set for a new chapter in Dallas.\n\nJared McCain explains handling TikTok during wins and losses, hilariously roasts Richard Jefferson\n\nJared McCain carries a big social media presence with him as he prepares to enter the NBA, particularly on TikTok. The guard used that to his advantage as a freshman at Duke, using it to create business opportunities for himself through NIL.\n\nRichard Jefferson blames Lakers’ front office for JJ Redick hiring criticism\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers will enter the upcoming season with JJ Redick as their new head coach. While one could argue that the former NBA player is a good media analyst, many fans are concerned with Redick’s lack of coaching experience.\n\nWhy is the Los Angeles Lakers Head Coaching Job Hated? Richard Jefferson Gives 1 Shocking Reason\n\nBeing the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers used to be treated as the kind of job you’d be honored to have. Pat Riley and Phil Jackson are among the best coaches who have had the honor of leading some of the best teams squads the Purple and Gold have seen in years.\n\nRichard Jefferson Perfectly Describes Why Head Coaches Avoid Los Angeles Lakers\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers' very public pursuit of UConn head coach Dan Hurley has now come to an end.
