        "text": "Premise\n\nI thought of this while watching Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, when LaMarcus looked a bit like his old self for the first 3 quarters and then, a la Tony Romo, spent the next 15 minutes fumbling every pass or board that came his way (he also repeated this performance in games 2, and 3, and 4.) In games 2 through 4, when Spurs fans were looking for the old LaMarcus, they instead got one that averaged:\n\n11.3 points\n\n5.3 boards\n\n2.2 assists and\n\nShot 37.5% from the field.\n\nThose stats put him roughly between Frank Kaminsky and Jahlil Okafor, albeit efficient from the field, all the while making a cool 18 million more than Frank, and 16 million more than Jahlil. I know it’s a small sample size, but with a former all-star, it was just really sad to watch a team that could’ve had prime LaMarcus and healthy Kawhi compete and stretch the series out rather than what did occur, a sweep at the hands of the Warriors.\n\nFirst, an Apology\n\nI really have to send my condolences to Knicks fans, who really could’ve benefited from this article.\n\nKnicks would be rolling with:\n\nPG: MVP D Rose\n\nSG: Courtney Lee\n\nSF: 2012–2013 scoring champ Carmelo Anthony\n\nPF: Kristaps Porzingis minus the Clippers :) Tweet\n\nC: 2013–2014 DPOY and ALL-NBA FIRST TEAMER Joakim Noah (As opposed to this Joakim Noah.)\n\nI am convinced this team would’ve made the Conference Finals in this format.\n\nSo thus begs the question: What if every player suddenly transformed back into the prime of their career in these playoffs? What team would come out on top?\n\nFirst Round\n\n(1) Celtics vs (8) Bulls\n\nPG: Isaiah Thomas\n\nSG: Avery Bradley\n\nSF: Jae Crowder\n\nPF: Amir Johnson\n\nC: Al Horford\n\n6: Gerald Green\n\nPG: Rajon Rondo\n\nSG: Dwyane Wade\n\nSF: Jimmy Butler\n\nPF: Nikola Mirotic\n\nC: Robin Lopez\n\n6: Michael Carter-Williams\n\nOnce Upon a Time…\n\nMichael Carter-Williams was doing this- As a Celtics fan, I am happy to say that their entire starting lineup is comprised of players either in the midst of, or who have yet to reach, their peak. However, in these playoffs, we like to reward the kind of guy Phil Jackson would sign over the kind that Danny Ainge would.\n\nResult of Series:\n\nApologies to the Celtics. Consolation Prize: A real life future, Markelle Fultz, a functional franchise. Brad Stevens and Isaiah Thomas help them squeak out a game but the trio of D-Wade, Jimmy Buckets, and Playoff Rondo prove to be too dominant. Bulls in 5.\n\n(2) Cavaliers vs (7) Pacers\n\nPG: Deron Williams\n\nSG: Kyrie Irving\n\nSF: Lebron James\n\nPF: Kevin Love\n\nC: Tristan Thompson\n\n6: Richard Jefferson\n\nPG: Jeff Teague\n\nSG: Monta Ellis\n\nSF: Paul George\n\nPF: Thaddeus Young\n\nC: Al Jefferson\n\n6: Lance Stephenson\n\nOnce Upon a Time…\n\nKevin Love and Deron Williams were arguably top 3 at their respective positions, while Monta Ellis was filling the role Steph’s first splash brother (exclusively on offense.)\n\nResult of Series:\n\nLance Stephenson almost brings the series to a gentleman’s sweep in game 4 but rims out the winning 3 pointer as Paul George demands a trade to New York. Cavs in 4.\n\n(3) Raptors vs (6) Bucks\n\nPG: Kyle Lowry\n\nSG: DeMar Derozan\n\nSF: Demarre Carroll\n\nPF: Serge Ibaka\n\nC: Jonas Valanciunas\n\n6: Patrick Patterson\n\nPG: Jason Terry\n\nSG: Khris Middleton\n\nSF: Giannis Antetokounmpo\n\nPF: Jabari Parker\n\nC: Greg Monroe\n\n6: Michael Beasley\n\nOnce Upon a Time…\n\nGreg Monroe vs Serge Ibaka was a watchable matchup, Jason Terry would matchup with Kyle Lowry, and Michael Beasley was… relevant?\n\nResult of Series:\n\nNot many storylines of interest here, but since not much changes except a more dominant frontcourt for both sides and a healthy Jabari Parker, the edge goes to Toronto in 7 instead of 6. Giannis would still be really fun to watch, and would probably dunk over Serge Ibaka at least once. Side note: I really wish that the Bucks lost a few more games and played the Cavs so we could see Lebron do this to Jason Terry. Raptors in 7.\n\n(4) Wizards vs (5) Hawks\n\nPG: John Wall\n\nSG: Bradley Beal\n\nSF: Otto Porter\n\nPF: Markieff Morris\n\nC: Marcin Gortat\n\n6: Brandon Jennings\n\nPG: Jose Calderon\n\nSG: Mike Dunleavy\n\nSF: Kent Bazemore\n\nPF: Paul Millsap\n\nC: Dwight Howard\n\n6: Dennis Schroeder\n\nOnce Upon a Time…\n\nDwight Howard carried an Orlando Magic team with Jameer Nelson as his secondary option (alongside Ty Lue) to the Finals, Jose Calderon shot 46% on 3s, Mike Dunleavy dropped almost 20 a game. To be fair to the Wizards, Brandon Jennings wasn’t the worst player in the league at one point in time.\n\nResult of Series:\n\nDwight Howard is too much for Marcin, and John Wall carries essentially the same team he had in the 2017 playoffs. Hawks in 6.\n\n(1) Warriors vs (8) Trailblazers\n\nPG: Stephen Curry\n\nSG: Klay Thompson\n\nSF: Kevin Durant\n\nPF: Draymond Green\n\nC: David West\n\n6: Andre Iguodala\n\nPG: Damian Lillard\n\nSG: CJ McCollum\n\nSF: Evan Turner\n\nPF: Al Farouq-Aminu\n\nC: Jusuf Nurkic\n\n6: Allen Crabbe\n\nOnce Upon a Time…\n\nThere is no need to write this.\n\nResult of Series:\n\nSee above. Warriors in 4.\n\n(2) Spurs vs (7) Grizzlies\n\nPG: Tony Parker\n\nSG: Manu Ginobili\n\nSF: Kawhi Leonard\n\nPF: LaMarcus Aldridge\n\nC: Pau Gasol\n\n6: David Lee\n\n7: Playoff Danny Green\n\nPG: Mike Conley\n\nSG: Vince Carter\n\nSF: Chandler Parsons\n\nPF: Zach Randolph\n\nC: Marc Gasol\n\n6: Tony Allen\n\nOnce Upon a Time…\n\nThis would’ve been sooooo dope to watch, even with two defensive juggernauts. Vince Carter dunking on everyone in conjunction with Grit and Grind, vs an even better defensive team and a very talented LaMarcus Aldridge. And Chandler Parsons doesn’t suck.\n\nResult of Series:\n\nSpurs combine top defense with all 20+ point scorers 1–6, overtake overmatched Grizzlies. Spurs in 5.\n\n(3) Rockets vs (6) Thunder\n\nPG: James Harden\n\nSG: Eric Gordon\n\nSF: Trevor Ariza\n\nPF: Ryan Anderson\n\nC: Nene\n\n6: Lou Williams\n\nPG: Russell Westbrook\n\nSG: Victor Oladipo\n\nSF: Doug McDermott\n\nPF: Taj Gibson\n\nC: Steven Adams\n\n6: Enes Kanter\n\nOnce Upon a Time…\n\nWhat may have been the most entertaining first round series in real life also may be the least interesting in this universe? Russell Westbrook is more determined (resulting in an equally talented, but higher volume Russy).\n\nResult of Series:\n\nBasically the same series but with a better version of Taj Gibson. Rockets in 5.\n\n(4) Clippers vs (5) Jazz\n\nPG: Chris Paul\n\nSG: Jamal Crawford\n\nSF: Paul Pierce\n\nPF: Blake Griffin\n\nC: Deandre Jordan\n\n6: JJ Reddick\n\nPG: George Hill\n\nSG: Gordon Hayward\n\nSF: Joe Johnson\n\nPF: Boris Diaw\n\nC: Rudy Gobert\n\n6: Derrick Favors\n\nOnce Upon a Time…\n\nBoris Diaw was the glue guy to have, Joe Johnson was Iso Joe, but better. However, the Clippers have, for the first time more than backup level talent at the wing.\n\nResult of Series:\n\nWill we actually see Chris Paul in the conference finals? Clippers top 4 matches up well with almost any team, and Paul Pierce gets the job done. Clippers in 6.\n\nEastern Conference Semifinals\n\n(8) Bulls vs (5) Atlanta Hawks\n\nPG: Rajon Rondo\n\nSG: Dwyane Wade\n\nSF: Jimmy Butler\n\nPF: Nikola Mirotic\n\nC: Robin Lopez\n\n6: Michael Carter-Williams\n\nPG: Jose Calderon\n\nSG: Mike Dunleavy\n\nSF: Kent Bazemore\n\nPF: Paul Millsap\n\nC: Dwight Howard\n\n6: Dennis Schroeder\n\nResult of Series:\n\nThe Hawks should take at least 2 games behind Dwight’s Dominance. I think Paul Millsap has a game too. That said, D-Wade, Rondo and Butler won 2 games on the road against the Celtics in real life with a 30 and 36 year old Rondo and Wade. In game 7, Dwight likely turns into 4th quarter Matt Ryan, and Bulls prove to be too much for Hawks. Bulls in 7.\n\n(2) Cleveland Cavaliers vs (3) Toronto Raptors\n\nPG: Deron Williams\n\nSG: Kyrie Irving\n\nSF: Lebron James\n\nPF: Kevin Love\n\nC: Tristan Thompson\n\n6: Richard Jefferson\n\nPG: Kyle Lowry\n\nSG: DeMar Derozan\n\nSF: Demarre Carroll\n\nPF: Serge Ibaka\n\nC: Jonas Valanciunas\n\n6: Patrick Patterson\n\nResult of Series:\n\nRaptors are outmatched at every position, barring center. Even on the bench, JR Smith, Iman Shumpert, Kyle Korver, Richard Jefferson and Channing Frye trump Cory Joseph, Norman Powell, PJ Tucker, Patrick Patterson, and Pascal Siakam. Cavaliers in 4.\n\nWestern Conference Semifinals\n\n(1) Warriors vs (4) Clippers\n\nPG: Stephen Curry\n\nSG: Klay Thompson\n\nSF: Kevin Durant\n\nPF: Draymond Green\n\nC: David West\n\n6: Andre Iguodala\n\nPG: Chris Paul\n\nSG: Jamal Crawford\n\nSF: Paul Pierce\n\nPF: Blake Griffin\n\nC: Deandre Jordan\n\n6: JJ Reddick\n\nResult of Series:\n\nThe only real change in this is that I really feel worse for Chris Paul. They would probably win 1 game, doubtfully win 2, and if they somehow managed to win 3 (which they wouldn’t) they would probably lose on a Klay Thompson buzzer beater over Jamal Crawford. In the post game interview, Chris Paul trashes every player on his team and announces a very sad retirement. But if we’re gonna be real, the Clippers don’t even make it there. Warriors in 6.\n\n(2) Spurs vs (3) Rockets\n\nPG: Tony Parker\n\nSG: Manu Ginobili\n\nSF: Kawhi Leonard\n\nPF: LaMarcus Aldridge\n\nC: Pau Gasol\n\n6: David Lee\n\n7: Playoff Danny Green\n\nPG: James Harden\n\nSG: Eric Gordon\n\nSF: Trevor Ariza\n\nPF: Ryan Anderson\n\nC: Nene\n\n6: Lou Williams\n\nResult of the Series:\n\nJames Harden repeats his original game 6 performance, except this time in game 4 of the sweep. Rockets are outmatched at every position except point guard. Spurs in 4.\n\nEastern Conference Finals\n\n(8) Bulls vs (2) Cavaliers\n\nPG: Rajon Rondo\n\nSG: Dwyane Wade\n\nSF: Jimmy Butler\n\nPF: Nikola Mirotic\n\nC: Robin Lopez\n\n6: Michael Carter-Williams\n\nPG: Deron Williams\n\nSG: Kyrie Irving\n\nSF: Lebron James\n\nPF: Kevin Love\n\nC: Tristan Thompson\n\n6: Richard Jefferson\n\nResult of Series:\n\nAbsolutely, 100% not a sweep. This is playoff Rondo. This is playoff Wade. Robin Lopez still looks kinda homeless but also is kinda good. MCW is again, not trash. Wade absolutely, 100% wants revenge on Lebron. Bulls are able to stretch the series to a very competitive 6 games, but D-Will, Kyrie, James, and Love are just too good. These playoffs are looking like they may mirror the current NBA Finals. Cavaliers in 6.\n\nWestern Conference Finals\n\n(1) Warriors vs (2) Spurs\n\nPG: Stephen Curry\n\nSG: Klay Thompson\n\nSF: Kevin Durant\n\nPF: Draymond Green\n\nC: David West\n\n6: Andre Iguodala\n\nPG: Tony Parker\n\nSG: Manu Ginobili\n\nSF: Kawhi Leonard\n\nPF: LaMarcus Aldridge\n\nC: Pau Gasol\n\n6: David Lee\n\n7: Playoff Danny Green\n\nResult of Series:\n\nLet’s break down the head to head matchups:\n\nCurry vs Parker: Curry outplays Parker, who shoots lights out and proves to be the Warriors MVP of the series, dropping 50 in Game 1.\n\nKlay vs Manu: People seem to forget that Manu Ginobili once killed a bat in the middle of the game. Klay Thompson has some Klay Thompson quarters but Manu plays his heart out and manages to play even with Klay.\n\nKD vs Kawhi: Kawhi is a bit too much defensively for KD, who scores about 20 points a game, while Kawhi proves to be the Spurs MVP.\n\nDraymond vs. Lamarcus: Another even break. Aldridge isn’t 2017 playoffs Aldridge, but is also defended by madman Draymond who fortunately for the Warriors, doesn’t repeat his Game 5 Finals performance.\n\nWest vs Gasol: West is effective on the low block but Pau plays fantastic help defense on the fast-paced Warriors.\n\nCoaches: Pop outduels Brown, who can’t manage to put it all together without the guidance of Kerr.\n\nBenches: The X-Factors of the series: Playoff Danny Green, Vengeful David Lee, Patty Mills vs Shaun Livingston, Andre Iguodala, and Javale Mcgee. If we’re gonna be real, none of this really matters. Zaza racks up 7 DNP-CDs thus rendering him powerless and the Spurs sneak past the Warriors. The next day, Skip Bayless declares that Kawhi Leonard has overtaken Michael Jordan as the GOAT for 60 minutes straight as Shannon walks out within the first 10 minutes. Kevin Durant shows up next season 50 pounds heavier and is the 2017–2018 NBA MVP and Finals MVP. Spurs in 7.\n\nNBA Finals\n\n(2) Cavaliers vs (2) Spurs\n\nPG: Tony Parker\n\nSG: Manu Ginobili\n\nSF: Kawhi Leonard\n\nPF: LaMarcus Aldridge\n\nC: Pau Gasol\n\n6: David Lee\n\n7: Playoff Danny Green\n\nPG: Deron Williams\n\nSG: Kyrie Irving\n\nSF: Lebron James\n\nPF: Kevin Love\n\nC: Tristan Thompson\n\n6: Richard Jefferson\n\nResult of Series:\n\nGame 1: Lamarcus Aldridge proves too much for Kevin Love offensively, Kawai plays solid defense on Lebron and the Spurs force enough turnovers to win Game 1 comfortably.\n\nGame 2: The Lebron Game (Pt 1) Lebron drive and kicks, and plays stellar defense to end with 20/18/15 and shuts Kawai down enough to steal game 2 on the road. Danny Green registers a DNP-CD.\n\nGame 3: Lebron and the boys run Iso’s all game, and of course it works, very well, Cavs take 2–1 lead.\n\nGame 4: Kyrie drops 50, Tony Parker and Manu look tired, and Cavs steal 3–1 lead.\n\nGame 5: The Kawai game (pt 1) Before the game, Kawai is seen wearing a white t-shirt and black skinny jeans. JR Smith rants pre-game that the Warriors blew a 3–1 lead 28 times in the press conference. Cavs are unable to keep up with motivated Kawai and Kawai drops 40 to keep the Spurs alive.\n\nGame 6: With both starting lineups tired, both benches step up. Danny Green gets checked in for the first time at the start of the second half, drops 30 points and Spurs take the game back to San Antonio.\n\nGame 7: The Lebron game, part 2. Lebron repeats his Game 7 performance from 2016. Down 3 with 10 seconds left Danny Green hits clutch 3, only for Kevin Love to do the same 5 seconds later as he becomes immortalized as an all-time NBA finals legend while also not really doing too much until the final minute of game 7s. Skip Bayless retires!\n\nYour 2016–2017 NBA Champion: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nFinals MVP: Lebron James\n\nAgain, sorry Knicks fans."
