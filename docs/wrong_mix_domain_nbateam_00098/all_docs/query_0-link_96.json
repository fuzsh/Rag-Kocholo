        "text": "It all started with Richard Jefferson comparing Giannis Antetokounmpo to Scottie Pippen in the wake of the Milwaukee Bucks falling behind 2-0 to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nNow, we’re re-litigating the structural hierarchy of the Big Three-era Heat teams after Jay Williams sought to soften Jefferson’s take by pointing out that LeBron James was arguably second fiddle to Dwyane Wade during their mini-dynasty in South Beach.\n\nWell, LeBron didn’t take that too kindly. So much for Zero Dark 30 mode this postseason.\n\nBut, in fairness, he has every right to feel that way. James enjoyed some of the best seasons in his storied career in Miami, won Finals MVP in both of their title runs and, after leaving, spearheaded a legendary Finals comeback against the 73-win Golden State Warriors to snap a 52-year championship drought in Cleveland with the Cavaliers.\n\nWilliams doubled down on his take:\n\nBut James has bigger fish to fry. A date with the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals begins Friday."
