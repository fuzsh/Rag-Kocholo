        "text": "The NBA’s new In-Season Tournament has come with some intrigue and incredibly gaudy court designs — and the reviews are all over the place.\n\nBut one review from former NBA guard and current ESPN analyst J.J. Redick veered into the negative territory.\n\nWhile speaking on the broadcast for the Knicks-Bucks game that opened the tournament Friday night, Redick voiced his opinion about the flashy, over-the-top looks on these NBA floors.\n\n“I was very confused. The first court I saw was the Clippers court and there was a trophy at half-court,” he said on the broadcast.\n\nThe Clippers, rather infamously, have never won an NBA title, while their Crypto.com Arena roommates, the Lakers, have won 17 championships.\n\nRedick did play for the Clippers for four seasons, so his broadcast partner Richard Jefferson didn’t let him off easy.\n\n“You’re a part of the problem, JJ. What are you talking about?” Jefferson said with a big laugh.\n\nOutside of Reddick, opinions were incredibly mixed about the NBA’s designs.\n\n“This is certainly the ugliest NBA court ever,” wrote one X user about the Pacers’ floor, which was largely a light blue but with a yellow stripe across the center.\n\n“The Pacers’ court looks like something I created in NBA 2K in middle school,” wrote another about Indiana’s choice.\n\nAfter the Thunder shared what their court would look like, one user wrote: “Incredible court,” in a more positive review.\n\nThe Bulls had a look that used various shades of red for a wild look, and one user had an interesting take on how it could affect viewers at home.\n\n“The red courts are probably brutal on old lcd tvs,” they wrote.\n\nWhether or not people like the courts, one thing is undeniable — they got the fans talking."
