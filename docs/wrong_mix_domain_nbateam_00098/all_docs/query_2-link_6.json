        "text": "Big news in the NBA yesterday was that Suns’ owner Robert Sarver was suspended for one year and fined $10 million for allegations of racism and misogyny. Many in the NBA world are reacting, including players and executives. One notable reaction comes from former NBA player Richard Jefferson. Jefferson played in the NBA from 2001 until 2018, and is now an analyst on ESPN.\n\nStarts at 40:39 (h/t Aikansh Chaudhary of Fadeaway World): “Gilbert’s being a little d**k and he might break down his three-point shot. … It’s like bro, okay we get it, but let’s talk about wins, let’s talk about impact on games, let’s talk about intensity, defense, offense. He is the best two-way player on the planet and it ain’t even close, it ain’t even close.” Arenas became notoriously viral upon his claim that Antetokounmpo “doesn’t know basketball yet.” Though he already clarified his particular take, backlash still continues to circle around his name, more notably from the Milwaukee Bucks supporters.\n\nRichard Jefferson: LeBron James isn't an all-time Laker\n\n“LeBron James has not done enough as a Laker to be on that list,” Jefferson said. “Bron been there now — this is his fourth season, right? They’ve been in there four seasons. Two years, they haven’t made the postseason. One year, they lost in the first round. And one year, they won a championship.”\n\nDraymond Green: I’m watching the 98 Bulls vs Utah in the Finals… I can’t help but notice our 2017 team would’ve beaten these Bulls by a dub and these Jazz by 40 if they’re going to play these brands of basketball. And that’s why it’s dumb to compare Era’s. Richard Jefferson: Bro your 2017 team is the 2nd best team I played against BUT LETS CALM DOWN !! Also, I like the move of this text on Sunday afternoon. EVERY SHOW TOMORROW “ Draymond SAID WHAT” ￼\n\nForty-two-year-old Richard Jefferson stepped on an NBA court for the first time since he retired. But it wasn’t to play — it was to referee a Las Vegas Summer League game. Jefferson — who spent seven seasons with the Nets, and won a 2016 title with Cleveland — refereed the second quarter of Monday night’s Knicks vs. Trail Blazers game at Thomas & Mack Arena. “Part of the reason why I agreed to do it is because I had such a tremendous amount of respect for the officials. I understand how important they are to our game,” said Jefferson, an ESPN broadcaster. “I got texts from Monty McCutchen. I got texts from Bob Delaney. I was getting texts from Scott Foster, Zach Zarba, because I have relationships with these guys because I respect what they do in their craft."
