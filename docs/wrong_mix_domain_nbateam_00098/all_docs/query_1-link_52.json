        "text": "Never say never with the Heat but if the defending Eastern Conference champs are going to make another extended run, they'll do so against even longer odds.\n\nMiami's chances took a serious blow in its loss to the 76ers in the 7-8 Play-In Tournament matchup on Wednesday when Jimmy Butler suffered an MCL injury. Although Butler played through the injury, Miami announced on Thursday morning that the gritty six-time All-Star is ruled out for Friday and is expected to miss several weeks should the Heat advance.\n\nWithout Butler, the onus falls on Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo in particular to pick up the scoring slack. Herro led the team in scoring on Wednesday but finished just 9-of-27 from the field. Adebayo meanwhile scored just 10 points, far below his season average of 19.3 points per game.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bulls — who dominated the Hawks in the 9-10 Play-In matchup — suffered a significant loss of their own Wednesday after defensive stalwart Alex Caruso injured his ankle in a collision with teammate Andre Drummond. Already without Zach LaVine, who is out for the year with a right foot injury, Caruso's absence could mean Chicago is left to fight for its playoff life without its best perimeter defender.\n\nRegardless of whether or not Caruso plays, the Bulls' hopes rest largely in the hands of Coby White and DeMar DeRozan. A leading candidate for Most Improved Player, White played like an All-Star against the Hawks' fearsome backcourt of Trae Young and Dejounte Murray, pouring in a career-high 42 points to go along with nine rebounds, six assists and no turnovers. DeRozan chipped in 22 points and nine assists while logging a team-high 44 minutes.\n\nThe winner will advance as the 8-seed in the Eastern Conference and get a date with the 64-win Boston Celtics. It's a tight turnaround as that series begins on Sunday with Game 1 at 1:00 p.m. ET in Boston.\n\nLooking to tune in for some Friday night Play-In Tournament hoops?
