        "text": "Since announcing his retirement from the NBA just over a month ago, Richard Jefferson is back where it all began. The 17-year pro, who spent seven seasons with the Nets from his 2001 rookie year to 2008, has transitioned into his new role as a Nets game and studio analyst with YES Network.\n\nJefferson ranked top 10 in games played, minutes played, field goals, 3-pointers, free throws, rebounds, assists, points, true shooting percentage and win shares in Nets franchise history. While with New Jersey, the team made consecutive Finals appearances in his first two seasons and the playoffs in each of his first six seasons.\n\nThe day after working Brooklyn’s 120-107 loss to Miami at Barclays Center, Jefferson took a trip down memory lane with The Athletic. The 38-year-old spoke​​ at length about his draft-day trade to the Nets, playing with Jason Kidd and Vince Carter, clubbing in New York, playing for Gregg Popovich and Ty Lue and more.\n\nOriginally on draft night, you were part of that big trade for Eddie Griffin. What do you remember about getting traded to New Jersey at that time on draft night? I spoke to Rod Thorn about it previously, and it was a big moment for the franchise.\n\nYou know what, I just remember, it’s weird because it’s all over the place. I remember not having a great workout for New Jersey. My girlfriend at the time was working in New York, so I was just happy to go do a workout for them even though they had, I believe, the seventh pick. But I was like, ‘I’m not going seventh.’ Right? I’m not going seventh, so I was just trying to get out of the workout. I didn’t give a damn about working out for New Jersey and all that other stuff. When the draft came and all of a sudden it was Houston I was stoked. I’m like, ‘Alright. I stay West Coast.’ Then it was like, ‘Hey, there’s something in the works.’ It was my agent. I said, ‘What are you talking about?’ Then, like 10 minutes later, it’s like, ‘You’ve just been traded to New Jersey.’ I was like, ‘What is going on in my life?’ Then, obviously, Jason Collins and Brandon Armstrong. Then, a day or two later, Jason Kidd got traded and I personally, maybe it was just being young and dumb, but I was like, ‘Oh, we’re going to be good.’ I was that young kid that just thought that.\n\nWell, you turned out to be right. You guys made the Finals the first two years of your career. What sticks out to you about that? For a lot of rookies, that is certainly not the case.\n\nI think what sticks out to me most is the teamwork. I just saw a stat the other day — now that I’m in broadcasting everyone wants to use highlights and numbers — but we were the first team ever to make it to the Finals without someone averaging 15 points a game in the season. We had seven guys average between nine-to-14 points. We would have on a given night anywhere from seven-to-eight guys in double figures. It was just a purely team effort. I saw how a locker room, and how important everyone is, from top to bottom to do their job. It was a lot of valuable lessons for me my first couple of years.\n\nI remember, now that you transitioned to YES, you made me chuckle when you talked about partying with the guys after you’d beat the Knicks. I’ve got to ask, where would you guys go and turn up back then?\n\nWhen I was a rookie, again, this is pre-social media and all this other stuff, the only thing you had to worry about was Page Six. No one knew who I was, so I could go and party all the time, but the minute I became a professional — there’s a difference between being an NBA player and being a professional, right? — once I became a professional, I realized there was no going out the night before a game. If I had buddies that came into town from other teams, I’d go and say hello and maybe meet up and go to dinner, but I just realized I couldn’t go out the night before. Now, the night after a game is a completely different story. The night after the game we’d go everywhere. I remember the first week that Marquee opened and Me and Jason Kidd are in there. I remember going to Suede, which was a great spot for a lot of years and is probably still pound-for-pound one of the best clubs maybe in the history of New York. Now, I know that that’s a bold statement, but if you go back to that post-9/11 era where people were still afraid to kind of pop bottles and go crazy, this was the small enough club that packed enough people in that it was like people felt comfortable within those walls to really just have a good time. All the guys like Eugene and Danny A., and all the guys that came from that little bitty club, are still running New York to this day.\n\nWhat was a typical night out after a game?\n\nIt’s always different. When I lived here in New York, and I played for the Nets, I lived in Tribeca. A lot of it might be, again, I was basically just out of college. I was 23 or 24 years old. It would be grab some food on the way home, it would be pregame at my place, and then we’d just hit the spots. I hurt my wrist right after I signed my big contract, so I was pretty much done for the season, so we’d pretty much go everywhere. We would go to Ruby Falls, Marquee, Pink Elephant, Home, One, Pangaea. We’d go everywhere because we don’t have a Monday through Friday schedule, so it was whatever was going on that night.\n\nSome guys now, maybe it was different for you, would tell me they might let team security know, and they’d go and team security would mingle in with everyone and not stick out. Did that stuff happen for you guys or was it a different time?\n\nI think it was a different time. I think it depends on your personality. Me, I was always very low profile. I would go out enough where the place’s security typically had my back because I lived here and I’d see these guys and get autographs for their kids. Me and the bouncers would talk about the games from two nights before. If you’re an out-of-town guy and you’re an out-of-town team, yeah, NBA security is probably always best, but not for everybody. I played with different guys, and lots of Hall of Famers that could go out and could go to a restaurant or club but there was never an issue. There are certain people where issues just seem to follow them.\n\nAnybody in particular? (Laughs)\n\nNo (laughing). We don’t need to name names.\n\nWas there any particular club story, like a crazy club story, you remember even if it was during Cleveland and the Finals days? Doesn’t have to be New Jersey.\n\nThere are always — you don’t know, you don’t remember. I remember at Lotus in the Meatpacking (District), this was when the Meatpacking was still packing meat. I remember you’d sit there and you’d go out right around the Gansevoort hotel. It was about 2003 or 2004, and it would be Jay Z at one table, Puffy at another table, Busta Rhymes at another table. You’re just looking down the row. This was like when they were peaking. They were getting into that space. None of them had reached billionaire status yet. They were just all like really kind of doing their thing. It was just a really cool time in New York because, like I said, it was post-9/11 and it was far enough away from that people felt comfortable to go out and have a good time again.\n\nI’ll switch back to basketball now. You guys in the first two years were in the Finals. Year one, you face the Lakers and that behemoth team and got swept. The next year, you lost in six to the Spurs. That was the year after you guys traded for Dikembe Mutombo. What do you remember about those two specific Finals experiences against the Lakers and Spurs?\n\nI remember that we weren’t supposed to be there when we faced the Lakers. We were picked to finish last in the conference. We had no experience. Two rookies had high-level playing time, me and Jason Collins. I’m not saying we were along for the ride, but none of us knew what to expect, and we went against the 3-peating Lakers. The next year against San Antonio I felt like we had a chance. It was tied 2-2. We had a chance. One of the things that helped me later is stars typically don’t win series if you ask me. It’s the guys that are the seven-to-10 guys who have a bigger impact than people think. In that series against us, Speedy Claxton played well. It was Stephen Jackson. Steve Kerr had a big Game 6 against us and hit a couple of threes right at the right time. That’s the one thing that helped me when I was older and in 2016 when we were able to win (with Cleveland). I was so mentally ready and mentally locked in for the entire series because I saw that guys that were seven-to-10 have big impacts. That’s where I was. I was a seven-to-10 guy. I was just so locked in knowing that at some point in time, I’m going to have a chance to make an impact, and that’s what happened.\n\nThat’s interesting how it came back full circle for you towards the end of your career. Do you ever wonder what would’ve happened if Mutombo didn’t get hurt that second year when you played San Antonio?\n\nYeah, but I look back on other things, and there were a couple of other players that I felt like we brought in that were supposed to be a lot more impactful than they were and our seven-to-10 didn’t play great. Their seven-to-10 did. Again, I don’t need to name names. That’s just the reality. Mutombo got hurt, but he came back right before the playoffs, and he was still trying to get himself together. But more than anything, I felt like we lost that battle in that middle ground.\n\nDuring those first couple of years, there was the Jason Kidd and Byron Scott dynamic. How was that relationship in your eyes?\n\nI was in my first and second year. I didn’t know where I was. I was still trying to figure out what club I was going to go to. I didn’t understand. I’m from college. Right? You’re so focused on trying to make sure you belong in this league. I really didn’t pay attention to anything that was going on, and I mean that in the most kind of just young, dumb, and kind of like how millennials float through life, that’s how I was floating through my first couple of years.\n\nWhat about when it was you, Vince Carter, Jason Kidd? What was it like running and gunning with them?\n\nThat team always hurt me a little bit because I felt like that was our chance to get back to the Finals again and things just couldn’t work out. We had injuries. Jason Kidd hurt his knee that first year. Then, we had some really good teams after that. I think people need to understand how good Jason Kidd really was. It’s like yeah, he’s averaging a triple-double, and he did this and that, but the things he used to do and helped players accomplish, I still don’t think I’ve seen it today. It’s the Kidd effect, and they talked about it. Steve Nash was very similar to that when he was playing in Phoenix. Guys would get around him and just start having career years because he played the right way, the style of basketball, the way he’d energize guys. He really, I feel like, was so instrumental in helping Vince kind of get over those Toronto days and starting over and becoming a high level and playmaker again in the league. Not that he lost it. It’s just the Toronto situation had kind of put him in a space where he might not be viewed as that guy. But once he got next to Jason Kidd, it made his job that much easier.\n\nWhen you mentioned the injuries, was part of that Alonzo Mourning at that time?\n\nYeah. It was just, Alonzo, we kind of knew what we were taking on to get him because you knew he had a kidney issue and you knew he was making a comeback and he was available. You knew the risk you were taking on, but most of it just had to do more with us not being able to maximize that team. I felt like of all those (Nets) teams, those were the ones that underachieved. I’ve been on teams, like probably my first year, we overachieved, and then some of those VC years we probably underachieved.\n\nDo you remember what the relationship with Lawrence Frank and Jason Kidd was like back then? When Jason became a coach here (with the Nets), it deteriorated.\n\nYeah. I just think that the fact that Jason Kidd hired him, I think just shows everything you need to know about his relationship when he was a player for him. What transpired afterward is what it is. But I think they had a relationship that would put Jason in a position to hire him, and he did.\n\nThen you get traded to the Bucks for Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons. When you look back on your tenure, do you have any regrets? Were you mad about the trade or anything like that?\n\nNo. I think the Milwaukee and San Antonio situations taught me a lot. Yeah, you take it personally. You take those types of things personally. A lot of players do. You don’t always handle them that well, which I didn’t. But, I learned a lot about myself, and, again, being a professional. The lessons I learned there helped me later in life to reinvent my game and probably play in the league three-to-four years longer than I probably should have.\n\nYou also got the chance to play for Gregg Popovich. What was that experience like and what was the best story with him?\n\nPop is the best coach I’ve probably been around. You look at guys go places and try to adjust and fit in and try to figure it out. My time in San Antonio, it didn’t go well. We won 61 games one year. We just didn’t do what we expected to do, including myself. But I will say this, I learned so much about basketball, shooting, and how to take care of your body. I was a nine-year player you’d never call unprofessional, but I even learned next-level professionalism from him and Tim Duncan.\n\nYou also got to play on the Warriors team when they had Mark Jackson and a younger Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Did you see this young core back then evolving into this?\n\nI wouldn’t say that I saw them evolving into this. A lot of things went right for this to happen. If you would’ve told me those guys with Klay, Steph, and Draymond, that they’d win a championship in three-to-five years, I wouldn’t have batted my eye at that. Right? Their best players all work hard they’re professionals, they take care of their body and have been around the block. Their families come from — Klay and Steph — both their dads had played in the NBA, and they were really just good dudes. Now, obviously the dynasty and the way they’ve done it, that’s a different story.\n\nWhat did you think of Ty Lue?\n\nTy Lue was a great coach. He helped us win a championship. We all owe that to him as our leader, and he was in a tough situation where he took over in the middle of the season, but he was very good in dealing with players and managing talent. You never heard about problems with Ty Lue.\n\nLastly, how’s life with the YES Network, and do you miss playing at all?\n\nYeah, I miss playing. Like everybody else, I miss the camaraderie, but I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with the individuals that I do. It’s a great opportunity for me. I’m just trying to maximize it.\n\n(Top photo of Jefferson with the Nets in 2008: Andrew D. Bernstein/ NBAE via Getty Images)"
