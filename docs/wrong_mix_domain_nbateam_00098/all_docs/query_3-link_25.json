        "text": "John Friel@ @JohnFtheheatgodAnalyst I\n\nNBA Power Rankings: Why the Chicago Bulls Top the List of Best NBA Frontcourts\n\n0 of 30\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nA frontcourt's talent comes into play when determining the better team in a matchup. The three players who make up any team's frontcourt can play the largest part in any game because of their ability to use their size to have clear advantages over other teams. It doesn't always play the biggest role in every game, but a frontcourt's length and size can impact the outcome when it knows how to rebound and keep the ball in its possession.\n\nFinding quality big men in this league has been one of the more difficult feats over the past few years. There has been an overall lack of players seven feet or taller, and even when they are found, they are either offensively challenged or restricted to being jump shooters. Having a center who can command the paint on offense and defense is one of the biggest advantages a team can hold over another, and it's why players like Dwight Howard and Andrew Bynum are so coveted.\n\nA team's power forward can also play a large factor in games because of their versatility. They're usually mid-range and inside threats who can use their size to shoot over opposing defenders while also being able to sometimes be the best rebounders of the team, like Kevin Love in Minnesota or Chris Bosh and Udonis Haslem with Miami.\n\nThe small forwards usually are the players who are the most versatile on the floor. They can pass, shoot, rebound and can control the ball. Sometimes, they could either be the best scorers on the floor, like Carmelo Anthony and Kevin Durant, or they could be the best defenders on the court, like Andrei Kirilenko or Andre Iguodala. Small forwards have the versatility to do just about everything on the floor and can change the tempo of any game if they have enough of an impact.\n\nWhen it comes to a league like the NBA, size can mean everything to a team. In fact, length is one of the main reasons why the Los Angeles Lakers have won the past two championships. For a team to legitimately contest for a title, they will need at least one capable big man in their frontcourt who can be able to change a game with their size and versatility.\n\n30. Cleveland Cavaliers: Alonzo Gee, J.J. Hickson and Anderson Varejao\n\n1 of 30\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nAlonzo Gee: 6.1 ppg, 3.5 rpg and 0.8 apg.\n\nJ.J. Hickson: 12.9 ppg, 8.1 rpg and 1.1 apg.\n\nAnderson Varejao: 9.1 ppg, 9.7 rpg and 1.5 apg.\n\nIt certainly isn't the worst frontcourt in NBA history, as J.J. Hickson and Anderson Varejao have a few quality aspects. Both are excellent rebounders, and Hickson has undeniable strength and potential. The problem is that they just don't have the willpower, tenacity and talent to compete with the other frontcourts of the league. This team has taken far too many hits over the past few months with LeBron James' departure, the 26-game losing streak and the various injuries that have taken a toll on the emotional state of the franchise.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if Alonzo Gee can match up with LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony or any starting small forward for that matter. He's only played 55 games in his four-year career and could see some progress as long as the Cavaliers keep giving him playing time and allowing him to start.\n\n29. Detroit Pistons: Tayshaun Prince, Ben Wallace and Greg Monroe\n\n2 of 30\n\nLisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images\n\nTayshaun Prince: 14.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg and 2.8 apg.\n\nBen Wallace: 2.9 ppg, 6.6 rpg and 1.4 apg.\n\nGreg Monroe: 8.9 ppg, 7.1 rpg and 1.1 apg.\n\nDo you want to know the craziest thing about the Detroit Pistons? The roster is actually pretty good. They still have three of the players from the 2004 championship team, a few quality bench players and a decent amount of young players that the team could build around in the future. One of those young players is Greg Monroe, who has been flying under the radar and has already emerged as the starting center for a team in turmoil. He's inhaling offensive boards at an impressive rate, already at three per game.\n\nTayshaun Prince is the same player that he has been for nearly seven years now. The 14.3 points per game is actually a little below his career high of 14.7, which he posted in 2004-'05. His long-time teammate in Ben Wallace has seen better years and has now been moved to the power forward spot in favor of Monroe taking his usual center spot.\n\n28. Sacramento Kings: Francisco Garcia, DeMarcus Cousins and Samuel Dalembert\n\n3 of 30\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nFrancisco Garcia: 9.7 ppg, 2.5 rpg and 1.3 apg.\n\nDeMarcus Cousins: 14.1 ppg, 8.6 rpg and 2.3 apg.\n\nSamuel Dalembert: 7.7 ppg, 7.6 rpg and 0.8 apg.\n\nAside from being loud, brash and somewhat annoying at times, DeMarcus Cousins is actually a premier big man in the making. He has the strength and power to compete against most power forwards and can rebound on the defensive and offensive glass at an impressive rate as well. His off-court and on-court complaining has been a tad annoying, as well as his belief that he's a point guard in a 6'11\", 270-pound body, but he has the potential to become a fantastic power forward if he can get his act together and continue to develop.\n\nHaitian sensation Samuel Dalembert has been playing up to his usual standards aside from a slight decrease in rebounding and blocked shots per game. Now in his ninth year in the league, Dalembert might be taking his talents elsewhere come this offseason with a few teams pining for a capable center. Frontcourt teammate and fellow Caribbean native Francisco Garcia has yet to impress since two breakout years when he averaged over 12 points per game.\n\n27. Charlotte Bobcats: Stephen Jackson, Boris Diaw and Kwame Brown\n\n4 of 30\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nStephen Jackson: 18.8 ppg, 4.5 rpg and 3.7 apg.\n\nBoris Diaw: 10.8 ppg, 5 rpg and 3.8 apg.\n\nKwame Brown: 7.1 ppg, 6.8 rpg and 0.5 apg.\n\nThis certainly is not a bad frontcourt in any way, shape or form. The main problem is that running this frontcourt causes a lot of matchup problems for the Charlotte Bobcats with Stephen Jackson at the three, Boris Diaw at the four and Kwame Brown at the five. Jackson and Gerald Henderson sometimes switch between the two and three spot, but for now we'll say that Captain Jack is a member of the frontcourt. He is once again playing impressive offensive ball for the 'Cats, but has yet to find his way on the defensive end.\n\nSome might believe it's bad that Kwame Brown is actually starting on an NBA team, but it's not as horrible as it sounds. Brown is actually finding his way around the paint and actually putting his wide frame to good use for once. The numbers he is currently posting up are some of his highest since 2006-'07 as Michael Jordan attempts to give the former number one pick yet another chance to be a quality NBA player.\n\n26. Toronto Raptors: Sonny Weems, Amir Johnson and Andrea Bargnani\n\n5 of 30\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nSonny Weems: 9.6 ppg, 2.7 rpg and 1.8 apg.\n\nAmir Johnson: 9.8 ppg, 6.5 rpg and 1.1 apg.\n\nAndrea Bargnani: 22 ppg, 5.4 rpg and 1.8 apg.\n\nThe loss of Chris Bosh has hit Toronto harder than the coldest of blizzards this year. It's not as bad as the hurricane Cleveland is going through, but the 20-51 record definitely reflects that of a team that lost its superstar. Andrea Bargnani is doing all he can to make up for the loss of Bosh on the offensive end with a career-high 22 points per game, and Amir Johnson is attempting to do all he can with his rebounding at a little over six per game.\n\nAlas, it still doesn't make up for the loss of their former All-Star. The Raptors invested a lot of money in Amir Johnson and are waiting to see more positive results from their power forward of the future. Sonny Weems has shown the potential to become a quality role player in the league, but for now he and Johnson will have a tough growing-up process unless there is some other All-Star out there who wants to travel North of the border to help Toronto.\n\n25. New Jersey Nets: Sasha Vujacic, Kris Humphries and Brook Lopez\n\n6 of 30\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nSasha Vujacic: 11 ppg, 3.3 rpg and 2.1 apg.\n\nKris Humphries: 9.9 ppg, 10.4 rpg and 1.1 apg.\n\nBrook Lopez: 20 ppg, 6 rpg and 1.5 apg.\n\nIs the key to success dating a Kardashian? Reggie Bush won a championship prior to breaking up with Kim, Lamar Odom now has two titles since hooking up with Khloe and now Kris Humphries is suddenly having the best season of an otherwise mediocre career since dating Kim. In fact, Humphries had never averaged more than eight points and six rebounds coming into the season. It helps that he's the primary rebounder on the team, and it also helps that Brook Lopez wants to do anything but rebound the ball.\n\nLopez is in heavy contention with Andrea Bargnani as the worst rebounding center in the league, with the biggest problem being that Brook isn't even a deep threat like Andrea. The 20 points per game are a career high, but the six rebounds completely offset his performance this year, as he takes a step back as a capable rebounding big man.\n\nIs Kourtney available? Brook Lopez might just turn into Dennis Rodman overnight.\n\n24. Phoenix Suns: Grant Hill, Channing Frye and Robin Lopez\n\n7 of 30\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nGrant Hill: 13.2 ppg, 4.5 rpg and 2.4 apg.\n\nChanning Frye: 12.8 ppg, 6.8 rpg and 1.2 apg.\n\nRobin Lopez: 7.2 ppg, 3.5 rpg and 0.1 apg.\n\nIt should be depressing if a 37-year-old is leading your team's frontcourt in points per game, but we'll make an exception for Grant Hill. It seems that Hill is attempting to make up the time he lost to injuries throughout his career now that he is with the Phoenix Suns, as he has yet to miss more than 12 games in a season over the past four years. The 13.2 points per game is actually his highest since joining Phoenix, as it appears that Hill just might be in the NBA until the wheels really begin to fall off.\n\nAs for Channing Frye and Robin Lopez, they could both use some work. Frye is an exceptional shooter for a player his size, but his defense is severely lacking, and he becomes more of a liability than anything because of it. Robin Lopez still has a lot of kinks to work out in his severely raw game, yet he can still be recognized as a quality rebounder and shot blocker when given the opportunity.\n\n23. Houston Rockets: Chase Budinger, Luis Scola and Chuck Hayes\n\n8 of 30\n\nJeff Gross/Getty Images\n\nChase Budinger: 9.2 ppg, 3.5 rpg and 1.4 apg.\n\nLuis Scola: 18.3 ppg, 8.2 rpg and 2.4 apg.\n\nChuck Hayes: 7.7 ppg, 7.7 rpg and 2.5 apg.\n\nThe most diverse and unique of frontcourts features young high flyer Chase Budinger, Argentinean Luis Scola (who could probably play any position if asked upon) and the 6'6\" center Chuck Hayes. Even with his small size, Hayes made history two days ago when he recorded his first triple-double despite averaging fewer than three assists per game. Chuck has a lot of heart and some big shoes to fill until the return of Yao Ming or the emergence of Patrick Patterson.\n\nFor now, Scola continues to be the glue holding this hodgepodge of a team together. The 18 points per game are a career high as he attempts to lead his Rockets to a postseason berth that would surprise just about everybody. The only downside is that even though Scola has played only four years in the NBA, he is 31 years old. The Rockets might have missed out on his prime years when he was playing in a league outside the United States.\n\n22. Washington Wizards: Josh Howard, Andray Blatche and JaVale McGee\n\n9 of 30\n\nRob Carr/Getty Images\n\nJosh Howard: 8.4 ppg, 4.1 rpg and 1.3 apg.\n\nAndray Blatche: 15.9 ppg, 7.9 rpg and 2.3 apg.\n\nJaVale McGee: 9.5 ppg, 7.9 rpg and 0.5 apg.\n\nIf and when JaVale McGee gets a polished offensive game that has some sort of effect outside of five feet, then it would be time to recognize him as an extremely formidable center threat. For now though, we recognize him as a quality rebounder, great shot blocker and high-flying acrobat who has been known to go a little too far with his dunking ability. At only 23 though, there's plenty of time for McGee to improve, and with the starting center spot given to him this season, he has taken advantage by increasing his stats in every category.\n\nHis injury-prone frontcourt teammates can not say the same. Andray Blatche was in the middle of a great year with career highs in points and rebounds before spraining his right shoulder a few weeks ago, while Josh Howard has only played 22 games in two seasons with the Washington Wizards. Howard had a very impressive career with the Dallas Mavericks, averaging as much as 20 points per game, but has yet to get any significant playing time with Washington due to the myriad of injuries he has dealt with.\n\n21. Minnesota Timberwolves: Michael Beasley, Kevin Love and Darko Milicic\n\n10 of 30\n\nRob Carr/Getty Images\n\nMichael Beasley: 19 ppg, 5.5 rpg and 2.1 apg.\n\nKevin Love: 20.3 ppg, 15.4 rpg and 2.6 apg.\n\nDarko Milicic: 9 ppg, 5.4 rpg and 1.6 apg.\n\nGive it three or four years and this frontcourt could crack the top 10. Yes, even with Darko Milicic manning the paint. Darko is netting career-highs in points and blocks per game, but the low rebounding rate leaves a lot to be desired from someone who is seven feet and 275 pounds. Frontcourt teammate Michael Beasley has been erasing the bust tag that had been stamped on him following two subpar seasons with the Miami Heat and has averaged a career-high 19 points with his new team.\n\nThe real story with the Timberwolves though has been the overall work that Kevin Love has given to the NBA this season. From the 31-31 game to the unbelievable stretch of double-doubles, Love would be an MVP candidate any given season if he was on a team that wasn't 30 games below .500. He has emerged as one of the top power forwards in the league in only his third year while also giving Minnesota fans reasons to watch and NBA fans reasons to want him on their team.\n\n20. Milwaukee Bucks: Carlos Delfino, Luc Richard Mbah a Moute and Andrew Bogut\n\n11 of 30\n\nChris Trotman/Getty Images\n\nCarlos Delfino: 12.6 ppg, 4.4 rpg and 2.2 apg.\n\nLuc Richard Mbah a Moute: 6.4 ppg, 5.4 rpg and 0.9 apg.\n\nAndrew Bogut: 12.7 ppg, 11.3 rpg and 2 apg.\n\nWith Carlos Delfino back in the starting lineup, the Milwaukee Bucks get the boost they've been waiting all season for. The only problem is that it might have come too late with the Bucks currently standing three games out of the eighth and final playoff spot. Delfino has certainly made his impression felt over the past three games considering that he has hit 19 of his past 31 three-pointers while dropping at least 26 points in each contest.\n\nAlongside him in this United Nations frontcourt is Australia's Andrew Bogut and Cameroon's Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, who have formed one of the more daunting frontcourts on the defensive end. Mbah a Moute's length has been the staple of his defense, while Bogut uses his size to affect and send back shots, which has earned him the top spot among shot blockers in the NBA at 2.6 per game. On the offensive end however, it's been a completely different story with Luc and Andrew not being able to find any consistent offensive rhythms.\n\n19. Los Angeles Clippers: Ryan Gomes, Blake Griffin and Chris Kaman\n\n12 of 30\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nRyan Gomes: 7.5 ppg, 3.4 rpg and 1.6 apg.\n\nBlake Griffin: 22.4 ppg, 12 rpg and 3.7 apg.\n\nChris Kaman: 12.4 ppg, 6.8 rpg and 1.4 apg.\n\nIt isn't the scariest of frontcourts until you see that one guy flying at you from the free throw line ready to throw down on you. Blake Griffin has given the Los Angeles Clippers big dreams and wishful thinking of a possible postseason in the near future. At 22 points and 12 rebounds per game, Griffin is sure to earn Rookie of the Year honors, and he gives the Clippers faithful a new and fresh reason to start watching games again.\n\nCenter Chris Kaman has had his season deterred from an injury that kept him out the majority of the year. It's only more disappointing considering that it appeared last season might have been Kaman's breakout year after he averaged a career-high 19 points and nine rebounds per game. Chris has struggled with injuries throughout his career and has played in less than 60 games four out of the past five seasons.\n\n18. Golden State Warriors: Dorell Wright, David Lee and Andris Biedrins\n\n13 of 30\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nDorell Wright: 16.4 ppg, 5.3 rpg and 3 apg.\n\nDavid Lee: 15.9 ppg, 9.5 rpg and 3.1 apg.\n\nAndris Biedrins: 5 ppg, 7.2 rpg and 1 apg.\n\nWith Andris Biedrins as the only remaining Golden State Warrior from last season in the frontcourt, it seemed that it might have taken a few seasons for his new teammates to get adjusted to the Warriors' run-and-gun offensive system. Dorell Wright and David Lee have proven that they were ready for the Warriors' fast-paced style of play with Wright taking to Golden State like a fish in water. At 2.4 three-pointers per game, the former Miami Heat player is tied for the most in the league as he hits career-highs in every statistical category.\n\nDavid Lee is putting up impressive numbers again, but in reality is failing to live up to that $80 million contract the Warriors handed to him prior to the start of the season. In fact, Lee's stats are far less than last season's 20 points and 12 rebounds that he averaged with the New York Knicks. The 49 percent shooting percentage is also the lowest of his career, as it appears that he might have been left in the dust when it came to integrating himself into the Warriors' fast-paced game.\n\n17. Indiana Pacers: Danny Granger, Josh McRoberts and Roy Hibbert\n\n14 of 30\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nDanny Granger: 20.7 ppg, 5.4 rpg and 2.6 apg.\n\nJosh McRoberts: 7.3 ppg, 5.2 rpg and 2.1 apg.\n\nRoy Hibbert: 12.6 ppg, 7.7 rpg and 2.1 apg.\n\nFor Indiana Pacer fans, it was about time that they actually got to see Roy Hibbert on the floor and producing rather than on the bench and hoping that he didn't get into any more foul trouble. He's still averaging three fouls per game, but he is most importantly making his presence and impact felt around the basket. The 13 points and eight rebounds per game are career highs, and he is developing a dangerous offensive game that even features a short mid-range jumper that is basically unstoppable due to his size.\n\nDanny Granger has stopped taking as many three-pointers and has even stopped taking as many shots altogether. Granger was throwing up as many as seven three-pointers per game over the past two seasons, leading to the two highest scoring seasons of his career, but didn't see any postseason results. With a decline in shot attempts now and more help from his teammates, Danny and the Pacers have basically locked up the eighth seed.\n\n16. Philadelphia 76ers: Andre Iguodala, Elton Brand and Spencer Hawes\n\n15 of 30\n\nChris Trotman/Getty Images\n\nAndre Iguodala: 14.3 ppg, 6.4 apg and 6 rpg.\n\nElton Brand: 14.9 ppg, 8.5 rpg and 1.4 apg.\n\nSpencer Hawes: 6.9 ppg, 5.6 rpg and 1.5 apg.\n\nAndre Iguodala hasn't had the most impressive of seasons on the offensive end, as you can tell from the 14 points per game he is averaging, the lowest since 2005-'06. However, Iguodala's defense has given the Sixers a new lease on life and a sixth seed locked down in the Eastern Conference race. Philadelphia has been one of the hottest teams over the past few months and could give their first-round opponent a scare if they can transition their regular season play over to the postseason.\n\nAmong the other reasons for Philly's success has been the drastically improved play of Elton Brand. The 15 points and nine rebounds per game are his highest since joining Philadelphia, and he has been one of the key playmakers for the 76ers in their journey for their first postseason series win in nearly a decade. Spencer Hawes hasn't been the greatest of centers, but he has been doing his part as the team's center by doing all the little things to help propel the rejuvenated Sixers.\n\n15. Denver Nuggets: Danilo Gallinari, Kenyon Martin and Nene Hilario\n\n16 of 30\n\nDoug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\nDanilo Gallinari: 15.7 ppg, 5.8 rpg and 1.2 apg.\n\nKenyon Martin: 7.7 ppg, 6 rpg and 2.5 apg.\n\nNene Hilario: 15 ppg, 7.5 rpg and 1.9 apg.\n\nIt's not Carmelo Anthony, but Danilo Gallinari will do for now. As long as he can continue to be a multi-dimensional threat on the offensive end who can shoot from deep as well as use his exceptional speed (for a player his size) to blow past opposing forwards, the Nuggets will be fine without 'Melo. The fourth-year forward has had a horrid year from deep, hitting only 34 percent of his shots, yet he still remains a threat since he could get hot at any time.\n\nHis frontcourt, hard-nosed teammates in Kenyon Martin and Nene Hilario provide the toughness that the Nuggets will need going into the postseason. In his eighth year in the league, Nene is averaging a career-high 15 points per game now that the scoring has balanced out amongst a few players to replace the huge hole left by Anthony's departure. So far, this team has stepped up to the occasion in so many ways, and they look past Carmelo and look forward to postseason success.\n\n14. Atlanta Hawks: Josh Smith, Al Horford and Jason Collins\n\n17 of 30\n\nKevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nJosh Smith: 16.6 ppg, 8.7 rpg and 3.3 apg.\n\nAl Horford: 15.6 ppg, 9.5 rpg and 3.6 apg.\n\nJason Collins: 2 ppg, 2 rpg and 0.5 apg.\n\nPerhaps if Al Horford was back to his usual spot at center, leaving room for Marvin Williams back at the small forward position, the Atlanta Hawks frontcourt would find themselves higher ranked. Nevertheless, the duo of Horford and Josh Smith alone is enough to propel the Hawks this high. The Hawks have made it an issue this year to convert Horford into a power forward and have done very well with Al posting up career-highs in points and assists per game.\n\nJosh Smith continues to be consistent as a scorer, rebounder and shot blocker while attempting to work on his jump shot. He's taking nearly two three-pointers per game this season and hitting a career-high 33 percent of them. While his overall game is what earns him the most recognition, his ability to be explosive at any given moment is what has molded him into the All-Star worthy player he is today.\n\n13. Memphis Grizzlies: Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol\n\n18 of 30\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nRudy Gay: 19.8 ppg, 6.2 rpg and 2.8 apg.\n\nZach Randolph: 20 ppg, 12.5 rpg and 1.9 apg.\n\nMarc Gasol: 11.6 ppg, 6.8 rpg and 2.5 apg.\n\nOne of the best rebounding frontcourts belongs to the trio in Memphis where Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol combine for nearly 25 rebounds per game. The Grizzlies, however, recently took a hard hit to their postseason hopes upon hearing that Gay would have to sit out the rest of the season for shoulder surgery. Prior to the injury, Gay was having another quality season, leading the Grizzlies while also being one of the league's most dangerous and explosive scorers.\n\nIt's up to Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol now to propel the Grizzlies to the postseason and obtain their first playoff win in franchise history. Each player should be able to lead the team down the home stretch, especially with the way Randolph is rebounding with a career-high five offensive boards per game. Gasol has been no slouch either with his seven rebounds per game, as he also begins to exhibit an impressive offensive game.\n\n12. Orlando Magic: Hedo Turkoglu, Brandon Bass and Dwight Howard\n\n19 of 30\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nHedo Turkoglu: 11 ppg, 5.1 apg and 4.6 rpg.\n\nBrandon Bass: 11.1 ppg, 5.6 rpg and 0.8 apg.\n\nDwight Howard: 23.1 ppg, 14.2 rpg and 1.4 apg.\n\nWhen you have someone like Dwight Howard on your team, life becomes a whole lot easier. For him to score, players just basically need to throw the ball up and let him go get it. If a player misses a shot, he's right there to make up for your miss with a timely put-back. The time that he spent with Hakeem Olajuwon in the offseason seems to be paying off, as he's averaging a career-high 23 points per game and exhibiting a larger skill set than just powering it in with his strength alone.\n\nBrandon Bass adds another element to the Magic's offense, as he represents the team's lone mid-range threat. I say he's the only mid-range threat because players like Hedo Turkoglu, Jason Richardson and Jameer Nelson spend the majority of their time taking shots from 25 feet or farther. Bass brings more size and toughness to a team that could have used some more outside of Howard.\n\n11. San Antonio Spurs: Richard Jefferson, Tim Duncan and Antonio McDyess\n\n20 of 30\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nRichard Jefferson: 11.1 ppg, 3.8 rpg and 1.3 apg.\n\nTim Duncan: 13.3 ppg, 9 rpg and 2.7 apg.\n\nAntonio McDyess: 5.2 ppg, 5.3 rpg and 1.1 apg.\n\nThe retirement home known as the San Antonio Spurs frontcourt might be on its last legs, but with a stellar 57-14 record, there isn't much to argue against these older veterans of the league. Unfortunately for the Spurs, they might be without their rock in Tim Duncan for a few weeks due to an ankle injury. Duncan's production has greatly decreased this season with career-lows in just about every statistical category, yet he remains one of the Spurs' key elements for his leadership and ability to help his team persevere through difficult times.\n\nRichard Jefferson and Antonio McDyess are also experiencing career-lows in statistical production. However, Jefferson is hitting almost two three-pointers per game on 42 percent shooting, both career-highs. The chemistry and balance of this Spurs team allows Jefferson to get open for easy treys, and they also account for this team's regular season, and eventual postseason, success.\n\n10. Portland Trail Blazers: Nicolas Batum, Gerald Wallace and LaMarcus Aldridge\n\n21 of 30\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nNicolas Batum: 12.2 ppg, 4.6 rpg and 1.6 apg.\n\nGerald Wallace: 13.7 ppg, 7.6 rpg and 2.4 apg.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge: 22.2 ppg, 8.7 rpg and 2.1 apg.\n\nIf Kevin Love wasn't killing it out in Minnesota, LaMarcus Aldridge would be a shoo-in for Most Improved Player of the Year. With the absence of Brandon Roy due to persistent knee problems, the former No. 2 scoring option in Aldridge stepped up to the occasion and has become the new face and leader of the Portland Trail Blazers franchise. He has set career-highs in points and rebounds per game with his newfound role.\n\nRecently acquired Gerald Wallace has become a quick fan favorite with the good people of Portland despite averaging far less than what he did with the Charlotte Bobcats. Wallace had been coming off the bench before starting a few nights back with impressive results and could find himself there for the rest of the season due to the team's lack of a center. Come postseason time, Wallace's athleticism will be huge for a Portland team already chock full of it.\n\n9. Oklahoma City Thunder: Kevin Durant, Serge Ibaka and Kendrick Perkins\n\n22 of 30\n\nRob Carr/Getty Images\n\nKevin Durant: 27.9 ppg, 7 rpg and 2.8 apg.\n\nSerge Ibaka: 9.4 ppg, 7.6 rpg and 0.3 apg.\n\nKendrick Perkins: 4.4 ppg, 7.6 rpg and 1.4 apg.\n\nAt 28 points per game and barring some incredible letdown, Kevin Durant is set to receive his second consecutive scoring title after becoming the youngest player to ever win the scoring title last season. Durant is knocking down shots at an incredible rate and is now hitting a career-high two three-pointers per game on 36 percent shooting. His scoring output has actually decreased last season from 30 PPG, as it seems that he's more prone to taking the perimeter shot aside from driving.\n\nThe combination of Serge Ibaka and Kendrick Perkins supporting Kevin Durant might be one of the scariest duos to come across in the league. Not just from looks either, as both players are fierce defenders and shot blockers, with Ibaka leading the way at a little over two per game. Before Perkins suffered an injury in last year's NBA Finals, he was nearly averaging two blocked shots per game as well. Bringing in Perkins might have been just what the Thunder needed to propel themselves further into the postseason this time around.\n\n8. New Orleans Hornets: Trevor Ariza, David West and Emeka Okafor\n\n23 of 30\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nTrevor Ariza: 10.8 ppg, 5.4 rpg and 2.1 apg.\n\nDavid West: 18.7 ppg, 7.6 rpg and 2.4 apg.\n\nEmeka Okafor: 10.5 ppg, 9.7 rpg and 0.5 apg.\n\nThe New Orleans Hornets' balanced attack has been the driving force behind their impressive regular season run that currently has them at the seventh seed. OK, Chris Paul might have had a little something to do with it too, but he wouldn't be anywhere without his Robin in David West. The former 2003 draft pick has been solid as always, hitting mid-range jumper after mid-range jumper and currently leading the team in scoring at nearly 19 per game.\n\nHis two frontcourt teammates, Trevor Ariza and Emeka Okafor, have been solid as well, with both of them representing themselves as solid defenders more than anything else. In his first season with the Hornets, Ariza has actually seen his stats decrease to only 11 points per game, compared to the 15 he was averaging last year with Houston. For some reason, he also assumes that he is a three-point shooter and is currently taking nearly four of them per game, only hitting 30 percent of them.\n\n7. Utah Jazz: Andrei Kirilenko, Paul Millsap and Al Jefferson\n\n24 of 30\n\nElsa/Getty Images\n\nAndrei Kirilenko: 11.7 ppg, 5.1 rpg and 3 apg.\n\nPaul Millsap: 17.2 ppg, 7.8 rpg and 2.4 apg.\n\nI'm sure Al Jefferson didn't sign up for this Utah Jazz team when he arrived. Deron Williams, not Devin Harris, was supposed to be his point guard, and Jerry Sloan was supposed to be the head coach for the entire season. With those two now gone, Jefferson is part of an organization with a whirlwind of problems. Nevertheless, Jefferson now finds himself as the primary scorer and rebounder for the team while blocking a career-high two shots per game.\n\nThe drama between Williams and Sloan completely overshadowed the efforts of Paul Millsap, who is easily having the best season of his five-year career. The 17 points are far beyond his career-high, as he continues to evolve into the player that the Jazz were hoping for when they drafted him in 2006 as a second-round steal. As a Heat fan, I will forever remember the name Paul Millsap, and that's a promise that I wish I couldn't keep.\n\n6. Dallas Mavericks: Caron Butler, Dirk Nowitzki and Tyson Chandler\n\n25 of 30\n\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nTyson Chandler: 10.2 ppg, 9.4 rpg and 0.4 apg.\n\nEven with no Caron Butler, the Dallas Mavericks are still one of the last teams you want to face in the league. There are so many offensive threats on this team that an opposing defense won't even know where to start if it tries to throw out a double team. Dirk Nowitzki is once again the key reason why the Mavs are contending for yet another championship, and he has been as efficient as ever, hitting a career-high 53 percent of his shots.\n\nPrior to a serious knee injury at the start of the new year, Caron was having one of the best seasons of his career and emerging as one of the most effective players on an already volatile Mavericks team. He had found his niche as a quality role player who can be relied upon to hit the easy mid-range shots, while also being able to hit from deep. The 43 percent from beyond the arc is the highest percentage he has ever hit from downtown, along with the one three-pointer he was hitting per game.\n\n5. New York Knicks: Carmelo Anthony, Amar'e Stoudemire and Ronny Turiaf\n\n26 of 30\n\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\nCarmelo Anthony: 24.3 ppg, 5.9 rpg and 3.3 apg.\n\nAmare Stoudemire: 25.8 ppg, 8.4 rpg and 2.5 apg.\n\nRonny Turiaf: 4.3 ppg, 3.2 rpg and 1.5 apg.\n\nThe talent is there, but where are the wins? In time, when the New York Knicks stock up on some role players to surround Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire, they will be a fine and dangerous team, but they are now suffering with a big three and one or two other players who can be considered legitimate threats. Carmelo is averaging the usual 24 points per game, but he hasn't played that well as of late, with a six-point night in a loss against Detroit being one of the worst games of his career.\n\nStoudemire has been having one of the best seasons of his career. The 25.8 points per game are a near career-high, and he has made himself feel right at home living under the Mike D'Antoni system that he played under for seven seasons. Amar'e has been the key reason behind the Knicks' success this season, as he leads the team to its first postseason since 2004.\n\n4. Boston Celtics: Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Nenad Krstic\n\n27 of 30\n\nJim Rogash/Getty Images\n\nPaul Pierce: 18.6 ppg, 5.1 rpg and 3.3 apg.\n\nKevin Garnett: 15 ppg, 9 rpg and 2.5 apg.\n\nNenad Krstic: 10.2 ppg, 6 rpg and 0.4 apg.\n\nWith Kendrick Perkins in the starting lineup, this could be top three. However, with Nenad Krstic replacing Perkins, the Celtics have seemed to lose an edge and a certain toughness that Perkins brought to every game. Even with Shaquille and Jermaine O'Neal riding the bench, the Celtics don't appear to be the same team when Perkins was anchoring the middle. Even without him though, Boston is still a favorite to win the championship in May and has plenty of pieces to pull it off.\n\nGarnett once again had to miss a few games due to an injury, but has still been able to produce at his usual rate and standards. In fact, the nine rebounds he is averaging is the highest it has been since his first year with the Celtics four years ago. Paul Pierce has played up the usual standards as well and is even hitting a career-high 49 percent of his shots. The core of himself, Garnett and Ray Allen will once again be up to the challenge of contesting for their second title in four years.\n\nThey certainly have the age and experience for it.\n\n3. Los Angeles Lakers: Ron Artest, Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum\n\n28 of 30\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nRon Artest: 8.4 ppg, 3.2 rpg and 2.1 apg.\n\nPau Gasol: 18.8 ppg, 10.2 rpg and 3.5 apg.\n\nAndrew Bynum: 11.5 ppg, 9 rpg and 1.3 apg.\n\nUnlike the Boston Celtics, the Los Angeles Lakers still have their core from the NBA Finals intact. Why would there be a reason to change it? Ron Artest is still hitting shots in the clutch, Pau Gasol continues to be one of most efficient and effective power forwards in the NBA and Andrew Bynum is beginning to evolve into the center that the Lakers faithful and organization have been waiting for. Bynum started the season on the bench rehabbing an injury and has since come back a little slow. The 12 points per game are his lowest since his sophomore year.\n\nPau Gasol remains one of the cornerstones behind the Lakers' success. He is averaging a double-double for the second consecutive season and for only the second time in his career. It seems that Phil Jackson's philosophy in Los Angeles has changed Pau's game for better as he brings about a toughness that he never really had with Memphis, which could explain the newfound rebounding ability.\n\n2. Miami Heat: LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Erick Dampier\n\n29 of 30\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nLeBron James: 26.3 ppg, 7.4 rpg and 6.9 apg.\n\nChris Bosh: 18.5 ppg, 8.3 rpg and 1.8 apg.\n\nErick Dampier: 2.3 ppg, 3.3 rpg and 0.4 apg.\n\nAn easy choice for number one if not for the huge hole at the center position. Nevertheless, LeBron James and Chris Bosh support the frontcourt on their own. No one has been more worthful to his team than Bosh, who has sacrificed and changed his game in every way to improve himself and adjust to his new team's awkward offensive system. After struggling for the most part for the first few months of the season, Bosh has made it a purpose to score most of his points from the inside rather than spotting up for mid-range shots.\n\nLeBron James has been LeBron James for the majority of the season. While it was a little annoying to see him rely and settle on jump shots for most of his points sometimes, he too has made it an initiative to try and find more points in the paint. He and the rest of the team have mostly struggled in the offense, but are beginning to get a hang of it just in time for the postseason. Some people who believed that this experiment failed may have to eat their words come June if the team can continue to play with the sense of urgency that they have as of late.\n\n1. Chicago Bulls: Luol Deng, Carlos Boozer and Joakim Noah\n\n30 of 30\n\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nLuol Deng: 17.8 ppg, 5.8 rpg and 2.7 apg.\n\nCarlos Boozer: 18 ppg, 9.3 rpg and 2.3 apg.\n\nJoakim Noah: 12.4 ppg, 11.2 rpg and 2.3 apg.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls rank first solely because of the balance they can exhibit. There are players who score, there are some who can rebound, there are a few who can block shots and most importantly, they can all play quality defense, which is what the team has been based on this year under new coach Tom Thibodeau.\n\nNewly-acquired Carlos Boozer had a rough start to the year after an injury kept him out at the beginning of the season, but he has since come into his own and is now thriving with his new elite point guard and new team.\n\nJoakim Noah also suffered a setback early in the season with an injury that kept him out for a few weeks. Noah received a hefty contract prior to the start of the season and has been attempting to live up to it by posting career-highs in points and rebounds per game at 12 and 11. This will also be the second consecutive season he will average a double-double.\n\nThe frontcourt of Luol Deng, Noah and Boozer have been key in helping Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls grab a hold of their first number one seed since the Michael Jordan era.\n\nNow we can see if they deserve this number one ranking with the postseason right around the corner.\n\nX"
