        "text": "Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green is one of the most outspoken players in NBA history and he didn’t mince any words on Sunday night with a bold statement.\n\nGreen was watching the 1998 NBA Finals when he tweeted that his 2017 Warriors club would defeat the 1998 Chicago Bulls.\n\n“I can't help but notice our 2017 team would’ve beaten these Bulls by a dub (20 points).” Green tweeted.\n\nThe four-time NBA champion believes his championship team in 2017 that featured Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson is the greatest team in NBA history.\n\nThe 1998 Bulls were led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, who completed their dynasty with their sixth championship in eight years.\n\nWith the rules changing over time, many fans wonder how a matchup of this caliber would go.\n\nGreen, who took home the 2017 Defensive Player of the Year award, doesn’t lack any confidence in his squad.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Green has made bold claims. In an April episode of his podcast “The Draymond Green Show,” he sat down with Curry and discussed their championship winning seasons.\n\nNBA OFFSEASON: Kevin Durant and Celtics? What's up with the Lakers?\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Follow our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\n“I think that [2017] team took over as the greatest team ever,” Green said. “We were the best team ever, I don’t care what no one said. I can’t see anyone beating that 2017 team.”\n\nCurry, a two-time MVP and the NBA’s all-time leader in three pointers, agreed with Green’s assessment.\n\nMany former athletes have taken exception to Green’s comments and have responded.\n\nESPN analyst and 18-year NBA veteran Richard Jefferson waited less than an hour to comment on Green’s viral comment.\n\n“Bro your 2017 team is the 2nd best team I played against, but let’s calm down,” Jefferson said via Twitter. “Also, I like the move of this text on Sunday afternoon. Every show tomorrow [is going to be like] Draymond said what.”\n\nJefferson and the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated Green and the Warriors in seven games in 2016. The Warriors tallied an NBA record 73 wins and became the first team to lose in the NBA Finals after going up 3-1."
