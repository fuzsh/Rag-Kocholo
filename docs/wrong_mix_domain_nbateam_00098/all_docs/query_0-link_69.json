        "text": "CHICAGO AP — The Miami Heat endured a difficult regular season. Defending their championship won't be easy, either.\n\nLuol Deng scored 33 points, Ben Gordon and Andres Nocioni each hit two free throws in the final 19 seconds, and the Chicago Bulls held off the Heat 96-91 Saturday in Game 1 of their opening-round rematch.\n\nThe Heat trailed 92-91 after Dwyane Wade found Udonis Haslem for a layup with 38 seconds left, but Gordon hit two foul shots with 18 seconds remaining. After a timeout, Wade missed a 3-pointer and Nocioni hit two more free throws with 9.8 seconds left for the final score.\n\nGame 2 is Tuesday night in Chicago.\n\nThe Heat beat the Bulls in six emotional games last year on the way to the championship, but injuries limited them to 44 wins during the regular season. Still, this looked like a difficult matchup for a Bulls team that dropped from the second seed to No. 5 when it lost the finale to New Jersey.\n\nWade scored nine of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, and Shaquille O'Neal finished with 19 points before fouling out.\n\nDeng, who enjoyed a breakout season but had struggled against the Heat, made it look easy this time, hitting 14 of 22 shots. Gordon chipped in with 24 points and a career-high 11 assists, and Nocioni scored 17 points.\n\nThat was enough to offset a rough outing by Kirk Hinrich, who finished with two points and had four fouls. With Hinrich in foul trouble, Thabo Sefolosha guarded Wade and held him to 3-of-10 shooting through three quarters.\n\nThe Bulls appeared to be in control late in the third quarter. Tyrus Thomas blocked consecutive shots by Gary Payton and Antoine Walker 20 points, then broke the other way for an alley-oop dunk that made it 70-59. That brought the fans to their feet and sent Miami into a timeout. Gordon's 19-foot jumper made it 72-59 with 38 seconds left in the quarter.\n\nTORONTO — Vince Carter drew plenty of boos in his return to Toronto for the playoffs. Yet he wasn't the real problem for the Raptors.\n\nRichard Jefferson scored 28 points, Jason Kidd had 15 assists and 10 rebounds, and the New Jersey Nets held off a fourth-quarter rally to beat the Raptors 96-91 in Game 1 of their first-round series on Saturday.\n\nCarter, the former Raptors star who was jeered throughout the afternoon, scored 16 points but shot just 5-of-19. But Jefferson stepped up to make 11 of 21 shots, including eight of his first 10. He scored 11 points in the first quarter.\n\n\"Richard is a very talented guy,\" Nets coach Lawrence Frank said. \"He had a good rhythm to his game. That's what you need in the playoffs.\"\n\nChris Bosh led the Raptors with 22 points while T.J. Ford scored 21. Anthony Parker scored 16 points and added nine assists for the Raptors.\n\n\"We had opportunities, we just made mistakes at the wrong time,\" Raptors coach Sam Mitchell said.\n\nGame 2 is Tuesday night in Toronto.\n\nToronto trailed 78-65 after three quarters before rallying in the fourth. Parker and Jose Calderon sparked the comeback with consecutive 3-pointers before Kris Humphries' dunk and a jumper from Bosh made it 81-77.\n\nwith 6:15 to play.\n\nThe Raptors closed within one on Calderon's layup with 4:10 left, but Bostjan Nachbar's 3-pointer with 2:42 remaining pushed New Jersey's cushion back to 87-83.\n\nParker hit a 3-pointer with 12 seconds to go cut it to three, but Carter made one of two free throws to make it a two-possession game again.\n\n\"Toronto answered every run we had,\" Frank said. \"We were just fortunate to make some key plays.\"\n\nToronto's hopes took an early hit when Bosh was forced to the bench with two fouls halfway through the first quarter. By the time he returned with 6:18 left in the half, the Raptors trailed 42-32.\n\n\"That kind of stuff hurts you,\" Mitchell said.\n\nThe Raptors missed their first seven shots from beyond the arc before Juan Dixon connected with 3:15 left in the first half, bringing Toronto within 44-41.\n\nThat was the Raptors' last basket before the break, as New Jersey scored seven straight to take a 51-41 lead.\n\nCarter had to sit down after picking up his fourth foul with 9:33 left in the third, allowing the Raptors back into the game. On the next possession, T.J. Ford finished off a three-point play that made it 51-50, but Toronto could not draw level and the Nets soon pushed their lead back to nine.\n\nAUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Richard Hamilton scored 22 points, Rasheed Wallace had 16 and midseason addition Chris Webber added 12 for Detroit, the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nDetroit point guard Chauncey Billups, dubbed Mr. Big Shot for his clutch play, made his free throws down the stretch but otherwise wasn’t needed in that capacity. Instead, he had 22 points and 11 assists, and held his counterpart, Jameer Nelson, to 10 points.\n\nNelson fouled out with 25 seconds remaining.\n\nAll five Pistons starters scored in double figures. Detroit hosts Game 2 on Monday night.\n\nFormer Pistons Grant Hill and Darko Milicic each scored 14 points for the Magic, who dropped all four regular-season contests against Detroit. Hedo Turkoglu scored 17, but Orlando had 21 turnovers and missed 18 free throws.\n\nAll-Star center Dwight Howard had 13 points and 19 rebounds, but was only 3-of-11 from the free throw line in his playoff debut."
