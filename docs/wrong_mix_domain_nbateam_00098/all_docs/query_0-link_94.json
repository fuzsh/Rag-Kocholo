        "text": "NBA broadcasting free agency is in overdrive.\n\nRichard Jefferson is sought after coast to coast, but still wants to play. Mike Fratello is out. Bruce Bowen is back. Chauncey Billups will call more games. Meanwhile, Hubie Brown, who turns 85 later this month, is about to sign a multi-year extension with ESPN.\n\nHere are all the moves The Post has learned about after talking from officials involved in the deals.\n\nFirst off, there is major TV interest in Jefferson from ESPN, YES and for Clippers game broadcasts, but Jefferson still wants to play his 18th season, if he can.\n\n“I’m a basketball player until I am not a basketball player,” Jefferson told The Post. “My goal is to play basketball this season.”\n\nJefferson could potentially join the Nets’ TV crew on YES as a part-time game and studio analyst. Sarah Kustok will remain on the No. 1 team with Ian Eagle either way. The Clippers are also in play for Jefferson as a game analyst.\n\nIf Jefferson doesn’t play or broadcast, coaching cannot be ruled out, as Jefferson is close with Lakers coach Luke Walton and Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff.\n\nAs for YES, Fratello will not be back in studio. Fratello, 71, has been one of the biggest NBA analysts, dating back to his work as the Czar of the Telestrator on the NBA Finals with Marv Albert.\n\nJim Spanarkel’s studio assignments likely will go up, while his games go down. ESPN’s Ryan Ruocco will continue to do play-by-play when Eagle has conflicts.\n\nJefferson’s camp has had talks with ESPN to become a studio analyst, appearing on programs like “The Jump,” “SportsCenter” and “Get Up!” One official described it as a similar spot to Tim Legler. Jefferson has worked for ESPN in the past.\n\nBowen, who was let go by the Clippers after they disagreed with critical comments about potential free agent Kawhi Leonard, is returning to ESPN after a year out west. Bowen will go back to his old role as an ESPN studio analyst.\n\nOn ESPN’s game broadcasts, Brown is expected to remain near the top of the ABC/ESPN analysts’ pecking order, though he may do less regular season games.\n\nA Hall of Famer, Brown badly hurt his knee during the NBA Finals when he was on the call for ESPN Radio last year. That is not stopping his return, though.\n\nBillups will remain a member of the ABC/ESPN top studio set on “NBA Countdown,” but he is expected to add more games as a color commentator during the year.\n\nMeanwhile, sideline reporter David Aldridge is done with Turner. Aldridge left to be the editor of The Athletic’s Washington, DC, site this week.\n\nLet’s not forget about hockey: On many nights during the regular season, NBC’s coverage of hockey will have a different look as it changes its Wednesday night schedule. NBC has gotten rid of the Rivalry Wednesday theme and will have more doubleheaders. On those nights, Brian Boucher will be the “Between the Glass” commentator with Doc Emrick and Eddie Olczyk, while regular first-liner Pierre McGuire will work the West Coast games.\n\nIt is not a demotion for McGuire; rather, NBC is looking to him to add to its new format.\n\n“With our most diverse schedule ever, including a record number of Wednesday night doubleheaders, Pierre will often be assigned to the late game to help establish the new format,” an NBC spokesman said. “He will continue to work with Doc and Eddie for single headers.”\n\nDuring Joe Benigno’s leave, there were times where it looked like he might not be back. In late July, Benigno was pulled off the air by WFAN’s parent company, Entercom, after a still-pending sexual harassment lawsuit named him. He returned this week.\n\n“I’m happy for Joe and his family,” Benigno’s agent, Mark Lepselter, said. “He’s back where he belongs.”\n\nESPN will roll out 30 for 30 documentaries on Mike Tyson-Buster Douglas, Deion Sanders and Junior Seau."
