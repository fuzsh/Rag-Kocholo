        "text": "Former NBA point guard and current Philadelphia 76ers executive Jameer Nelson joked that he could get Richard Jefferson canceled if he revealed what the former NBA forward said to him in the locker room during their NBA careers.\n\nJefferson, who now works for ESPN, spoke with Nelson on the Road Trippin’ podcast, and evidently, their time as teammates came up.\n\n“This is my get back — when you’re on TV, this is all the stuff you put me through, all the times you tormented me in that locker room, calling me all the different names,” he began. “I’m not gon’ say the names – I don’t want to get you cancelled.”\n\nJefferson countered by saying that Nelson was lucky to have him as a teammate in his NBA career.\n\nIt’s clear that the two were just joking, and they appear to be very close with each other.\n\nBoth Jefferson and Nelson had successful NBA careers even though they weren’t superstars.\n\nJefferson won a title with the Cleveland Cavaliers during the 2015-16 season, as he was a part of the team that erased a 3-1 series deficit against the Golden State Warriors. Jefferson played mainly a bench role on that team, but earlier in his career, he was a solid scorer.\n\nDuring his time with the New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets, Jefferson had multiple seasons where he averaged over 20 points per game. The former first-round pick played for the Nets, Cavs, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, Denver Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks, Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks in his NBA career.\n\nAs for Nelson, he was a part of the Orlando Magic team that lost to Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2009 NBA Finals.\n\nA one-time All-Star, Nelson finished his NBA career averaging 11.3 points, 3.0 rebounds and 5.1 assists per game. He played for the Magic, Mavericks, Nuggets, Boston Celtics, Detroit Pistons and New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nDuring Nelson’s All-Star campaign in the 2008-09 season, he averaged 16.7 points and 5.4 assists per game while shooting an impressive 45.3 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nWhile the Sixers executive had to put Jefferson on blast, it’s pretty clear that there isn’t any bad blood between the two former NBA players."
