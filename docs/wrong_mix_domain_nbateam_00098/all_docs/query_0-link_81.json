        "text": "Harry How/Getty Images\n\nImportant details regarding the 2024 NBA Cup were released on Friday, as the association's in-season tournament is set to return for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers emerged victorious by defeating the Indiana Pacers in the 2023 title game during the inaugural event, with LeBron James winning the first MVP award of the tournament.\n\nOn Friday, all 30 teams were drawn into groups of five within their conference based on 2023-24 regular-season records. ESPN analyst and former NBA forward Richard Jefferson introduced the groups along with current players such as Chet Holmgren, Myles Turner, and C.J. McCollum.\n\nSimilar to the 2023 edition of the tournament, teams will participate in group play on Tuesdays and Fridays from Nov. 12 through Dec. 3. The teams at the top of each group will advance to the single-elimination knockout rounds, while one wild card team from each conference will also be included.\n\nAs the knockout rounds progress, the four remaining teams will advance to the semifinals at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nHere are some more key details regarding the tournament.\n\nImportant Tournament Dates:\n\nGroup Play Begins: Nov. 12\n\nSemifinals: Dec. 14\n\nFinal: Dec. 17\n\nGroups\n\nWestern Conference Group A:\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nLos Angeles Clippers\n\nSacramento Kings\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\nGroup B:\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nGroup C:\n\nDenver Nuggets\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\nGolden State Warriors\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nEastern Conference Group A:\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nGroup B:\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nMiami Heat\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nGroup C:\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nBroadcast Schedule\n\nKey Matchups\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves and Sacramento Kings will be in the same tournament group for the second consecutive year. Sacramento advanced to the knockout round in 2023 with a 4-0 record in the group stage, while Minnesota did not move on after finishing with a 3-1 record.\n\nGroup C in the Western Conference should feature several postseason contenders, with the Dallas Mavericks and Denver Nuggets both advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs last season. It also will feature Klay Thompson facing off against his former Golden State Warriors teammates after signing with the Mavericks in free agency.\n\nWhile Memphis earned the final seed in the group by finishing with a 27-55 record during the team's 2023-24 campaign, the Grizzlies should be much improved with Ja Morant coming back from season-ending shoulder surgery. Marcus Smart's full-time return will also likely help the team after he appeared in just 20 games during his first season with the organization.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference, 2024 playoff opponents will face off once again in each group. The New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers should continue their rivalry following the blockbuster offseason additions of Mikal Bridges and Paul George, respectively.\n\nIn Group B, the Milwaukee Bucks will attempt to earn some redemption against the Indiana Pacers after the team was defeated in the first round of the playoffs. The return of Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo could end up being the difference in group play, as he was unable to appear in Milwaukee's postseason exit due to a calf strain.\n\nAfter coming off a championship victory, the Boston Celtics will be looking to raise another banner. The Celtics will need to get past the Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston's 2024 second-round playoff opponent, in order to do so."
