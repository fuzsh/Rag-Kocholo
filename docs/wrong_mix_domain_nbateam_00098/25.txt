The Utah Jazz are still searching for their first win of the season. The Chicago Bulls stand in our way tonight. Lots of words have been written about these two teams here and here at our site, and check out Blog a Bull for their coverage.

This is a last second game thread.

Our starters will be Jamaal Tinsley, Gordon Hayward, Richard Jefferson, Derrick Favors, and Enes Kanter. For the Bulls? Derrick Rose, Jimmy Butler, Luol Deng, Carlos Boozer, and Joakim Noah will start. No one on their team is injured. Us? Don't get me started.

GO JAZZ GO!
