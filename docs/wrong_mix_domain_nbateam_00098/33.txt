The Cleveland Cavaliers might be without their best player tonight against the Chicago Bulls.

LeBron James missed the Cavs’ shootaround Saturday due to an undisclosed illness. Richard Jefferson took James’ place in Saturday’s workouts and would likely start in James does sit. The Cavs are 4-18 without James since he re-signed with the team prior to the 2014-15 season.

James did several videos of himself eating and drinking wine outside Friday afternoon when the weather was still warm, so perhaps he caught a cold when the temperatures dropped from the mid 70s back down to the 30s.
