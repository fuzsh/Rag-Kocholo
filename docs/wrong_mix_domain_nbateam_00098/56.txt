Despite playing alongside some of the NBA's best, such as LeBron James, Richard Jefferson is enjoying the basic things in life.

Having been an NBA star and featured for the US in the Olympic Games, he hit the heights of basketball, earning $115 million, but now he has reflected on what he enjoys in life.

"You know what? I walk around enjoying fu**ing life," Jefferson explained.

"I worked too hard and paid too many people to be stressed. I wanna walk around and just smell the flowers.

"There are some tasks that I enjoy doing myself. I don't mind going to get my car washed, getting a Starbucks [and] hanging out.

"I don't mind that. But am I gonna go clean toilets and do my laundry? No!"

Jefferson's career

Jefferson was drafted in the first round of the 2001 NBA draft with the 13th overall pick, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team in his first season with the New Jersey Nets (now known as the Brooklyn Nets).

He won an NBA championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016 and was also a member of the United States national team that won a bronze medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Jefferson played for 17 seasons in the NBA, with the Nets, Milwaukee Bucks, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, Cavaliers, and Denver Nuggets.

He was known for his athleticism, his versatility, and his three-point shooting, while also being known for being a popular teammate and a positive influence in the locker room.

Jefferson retired from the NBA in 2018, and he joined ESPN as a basketball analyst where he is a regular contributor to ESPN's NBA coverage, and he appears on shows such as NBA Today, NBA Countdown, First Take, Get Up, SportsCenter, and Hoop Streams.
