The anime takes place during the summer in rural areas in Japan. The exciting story began when Kokonotsu met with Hotaru Shidare (枝垂 ほたる) a lovely girl who knows virtually every snack. Kokonotsu Shikada (鹿田 ココノツ) is the protagonist who want to be a manga artist, unfortunately, his father wanted him to carry on their candy/snack shop.\n\nThe anime shows you the daily lives of rural teenagers in Japan, classical objects, especially candy and snacks that you may never see in a big city. The background scenes filled with nature, countryside and forests. The background music is a blend between old and modern music, most are summer sounds such as bells and cicadas.\n\nIf you like a novelty or interested in Japanese candy, I think Dagashi Kashi is right for you.\n\nMy favorite song is Checkmate!? the 2nd single release from MICHI is used as opening theme for \"Dagashi Kashi (だがしかし)\" anime series.\n\nTracklist\n\n1.

The story takes place in the near future where fuel is scarce. Electric power was canceled. Nowadays, The global is drawing energy from the W dimension. The energy that never runs out. The protagonist is Kyouma Mabuchi (マブチ・キョーマ) a young man who stuck with the painful past. He had met Mira Yurizaki (百合崎 ミラ) a cute robot in a night that will change his life forever.\n\nThe background scene is filled with building. I felt that the story tries to pump ton of tension all the time. There's mystery and horror of the dimension W you might be interested if you like science. I highly recommend Dimension W anime series if you like a mystery that comes with a cute girl.\n\nMy favorite song is Contrast pop-rock single release from a Japanese rock-band Fo'xTails is used as anime ending theme for \"Dimension W (ディメンション ダブリュー)\" series.\n\nDisc 1\n\nTracklist\n\n1.
