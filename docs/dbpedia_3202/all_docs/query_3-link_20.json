        "text": "I've heard people mention that they like Sakuraba's orchestral side but not his prog rock/techno side and vice versa. I'm wondering how common it is for people to like one side of Sakuraba but not the other. I've always liked both 'sides', so I find it curious. Such a divide amongst fans doesn't seem to occur with any other VGM composer, or at least not to the same consistent and widespread degree. Are you on one side or the other, and if so, why?\n\nIf I had to pick a side, I might go with his orchestral stuff, but for me it's always been the way that he combines the two that makes his style appealing. The orchestral stuff has an epic or ethereal quality that I enjoy and the prog rock stuff gets my blood pumping. Oftentimes they're somewhat distinct from each other, but in a track like say, Around in the Wilderness from SO3, you get the sense that there's a bit of that orchestral sensibility (18 seconds in?) weaved in, and it's great. Same goes for East Shrine from StHA.\n\nI guess I feel like Sakuraba produces a uniquely gamey style on the whole rather than feeling like one side is rock'n enough to enjoy or that the other side is orchestral enough to respect as 'serious music'. Yet they're distinct enough that some people do seem to favor one over the other by a good margin. (and not necessarily for the suggested reasons, though those are the impressions that I get sometimes)\n\nSakuraba is a composer that has just grown completely off me. I liked his orchestral and prog-rock sides for Star Ocean 2 and (especially) VP, but since Star Ocean 3, he's just been...off. I don't think I've been more disappointed in two scores than I was with SO3 or VP2 and I never found much to pick out of Baten Kaitos, outside of excellent sound quality. Even the prog-rock really doesn't cut it for me anymore. There's the occasional track (The Arrow Was Shot and Everlasting Fight were both excellent, from Tales of the Abyss...And yes, Datschge, I'm aware EF is a medley), but not really into any Sakuraba these days. At least not until I hear (or even play, but that's unlikely) something that resembles VP1.\n\nIn their entirety, I like Star Ocean 2, Star Ocean 3, Valkyrie Profile 2, and Tales of the Abyss...and those are his only soundtracks I've listened to so far, so I've liked 100% of what I've listened to.\n\nAs I've introduced game music to people who'd otherwise refuse to listen it, just because it was made for a video-game, I've found Sakuraba to actually be accessible to such discriminating people, so I believe his music is really good at reaching all audiences.\n\nAnd, Megavolt, I agree with you - I found his classical stuff ethereal and relaxing, and his prog rock adrenaline-boosting.\n\nGoldfishX: I haven't heard VP2 and since I haven't heard anything of his since SO3 or Baiten Kaitos, I don't know whether or not I could consider Sakuraba to be a favorite of mine at this time. That being said, I do often consider him to be my second favorite VGM composer overall. I don't think that would change *even if he does overextend himself* due to the fact that my fondness of his music is due to past scores and to his style in general.\n\nZane wrote:\n\nI dislike Sakuraba's \"orchestral\" side\n\nDo you dislike that approach in general, or just Sakuraba's version of it?\n\nBernhardt wrote:\n\nAnd, Megavolt, I agree with you - I found his classical stuff ethereal and relaxing, and his prog rock adrenaline-boosting.\n\nCool. I was hoping to find some people who felt similarly about his music despite my observations on the way that his two sides don't coexist on relatively equal standing for a lot of folks. Interesting point about his music reaching all audiences. I haven't tried to introduce anyone to game music in a while, but when I did, I only had success with specific tracks from different scores and Chrono Cross.\n\nI've definitely noticed the split, but I also like both sides of him. I feel he has really matured as a symphonic musician recently even though his work tends to be quite exhausting to consume at first. However, his rock pieces provide definite highlights on many of his recent soundtracks and I personally didn't enjoy his orchestral battle theme approach on Eternal Sonata. I should also say that I think Motoi Sakuraba produces his best work when he uses real instruments and so, unlike a lot of people here, I prefer Star Ocean Till the End of Time to Star Ocean The Second Story, Valkyrie Profile 2 Silmeria to Valkyrie Profile Lenneth, etc. Still, I think most of his work is decent, even the Mario Sports series, Tenshou Gakuen Gekkou Hasumi, Duel Masters, and certain Tales efforts (still haven't heard most of those).\n\nI enjoyed SO2 a lot but after that I think the prog-rock stuff got out of hand in SO3. While it has to do more with the games themselves, I think having a ten minute monster like \"Highbrow\" play during a fight is a little much considering you're more worried about staying alive in the battles it plays in rather than listening to the music. I think listening to it on the soundtrack is the only way it can make sense.\n\nI find Sakuraba's orchestral side more appealing but it I'm not a big fan of orchestral numbers... he can be a little by the numbers like Zane said, loud brash intro and such.\n\nI like both sides of him, but if forced to choose, I'd have to go with the orchestral side. Baten Kaitos is definitely one of my absolute favorite game OSTs of all time, but if it were ALL orchestral, I don't think I'd like it. I think that one has a really good balance of all kinds of styles. For me his work varies on a case by case basis, and I can't really say why I like some of it and don't others. I mean, if I prefer his orchestral stuff, why do I love Shining in the Darkness so much more than Star Ocean 3.\n\nI will say that my least favorite stuff of his is the Tales of ~ stuff, though. Perhaps that could be attributed to the other composer on that series, though (the name escapes me at present).\n\nAs far as genres go, I like all sides of Sakuraba whether it's orchestral (e.g. A Motion of Finishing Blow [VP2]), rock (e.g. The Divine Spirit of Language [SO3]) or anything in between.\n\nAs far as the games he composes for goes, for me it consists of two categories: bad music (anything from the Tales of... series) and good music (everything else).\n\nProbably a case of quantity over quality since most Tales of ... soundtracks are 4 discs long and there are a lot of games in the series.\n\nQui-Gon Joe wrote:\n\nI will say that my least favorite stuff of his is the Tales of ~ stuff, though. Perhaps that could be attributed to the other composer on that series, though (the name escapes me at present).\n\nOr perhaps I could blame Shinji Tamura instead.\n\nDatschge wrote:\n\nIn any case his Camelot works need more exposure than Tales, especially considering they usually never make it onto some OST release. So here's a We Love Golf! recording.\n\nI've already said it over at Gamingforce, but thanks again! I've only given it a quick listen so far, but I'll fix that while I'm at work. My initial reaction is that Sakuraba has once again hit upon the same charm he struck with his previous Camelot sports titles, and that makes me smile.\n\nI DO, however, have to good-naturedly scold him for wholesale lifting of samples used in SO3's \"Around in the Wilderness\" for use in \"Mirage Valley\", as if I wouldn't catch on! Naughty, naughty Sakuraby! I do say \"good-naturedly\", though, because its those samples that make me like \"Mirage Valley\" very much. How I've missed those wonderfully bizarre rhythms and chiming guitars!"
