It's storyline is perfect for an anime iteration, but then again, any idea can become an anime. Well what I'm getting at is that this is another ... iteration based on that epic. And in my opinion, this is the best iteration of that tale that I have seen so far.\n\nIt's not historically accurate at all. If anything, it follows the story extremely loosely. I mean the names are partially the same and their personalities match (i.e. monkey, priest, etc) but thats about it. Their opposition are literally monsters and their goal is to reach the west. They use guns and have a dragon that transforms into a jeep. So you can't take this seriously. But there is one thing that this show has and the other anime does not: attitude. The four travelers, Gojyo, Sanzo, Hakkai, and Goku, are all badass and their chemistry between each other are hilariously cool.\n\nNow I enjoyed the English dub of this show simply because the banter between the four was actually more believable in a realistic friendship sort of way. When they make fun of each other it sounds like something I would say to my friends. No matter how much they sound like they hate each other guts and despise each other but when it comes down to it, they will follow each other to the ends of the earth. That is something that is often attempted in anime but rarely executed very well.\n\nAll the adventures they encounter are your typical random shonen encounters that they have to overcome. I would have cared less if their teamwork wasn't so awesome and macho even under stressful conditions. No matter what they faced, they still managed to accomplish it in a virile manner.\n\nOverall this show, like many others like it, can not be fully appreciated unless you're ready to accept the fact that its story is very very vague. Secondly, I highly recommend the English dub since they sound much more badass than the Japanese dub and really made this show from okay to pretty darn good.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nSaiyuki is one of those animes that just grabs you from the very first episode, and won't let you go, even though, it is an episodic anime. Most of the storylines only take 1 to 2 episodes to tell, as you follow these 4 travelers, sent by the gods, to prevent the reawakening of an old, extremely dangerous demon.\n\nMy only complaint about this anime would be the animation. There are a lot of \"still shots\" used during the battle scenes, but you can overlook that. The animation is also not as clean as I would like to be, but I think, maybe, ... it was intended that way, to go along with the story.\n\nThe characters are PERFECT. They don't get any better than this. Sanzo, the 'renegade priest' who swears, smokes, drinks, weilds a banishing gun, and has a tongue sharp as a razor. Goku, the lovable little monkey king, who is always hungry, and whiny, but kicks butt during the battles. Hakkai, the soft-spoken, sympathetic demon, with a heart of gold, and a tragic past. Finally, my personal favorite, Gojyo, the drinking, gambling, swearing, skirt-chasing pervert of a water sprite, who just makes you laugh out loud almost everytime he opens his mouth.\n\nAll of the characters have a tragic past (with Hakkai's probably being the worst), that is revisited from time to time to help you understand why they are the way the are.\n\nThe music in this anime is great, especially the OP songs. I would actually buy the OST if I could find it.\n\nEven though the goal of the entire series is to prevent the resurrection of the old demon, and the entire series works towards that goal, this is basically an episodic anime. Enjoy!! ^_^\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nWhat is there to say? For one, Saiyuki has quickly crawled to the very top of my &quot;favorite anime&quot; list, and I don't believe it will be leaving anytime soon.\n\nStory: Based on an old Chinese story, the story of Saiyuki is addicting and entertaining. The simple idea of four total opposites finding a way to travel together on a journey to &quot;save the world&quot; is kind of hilarious. Now, the story itself isn't quite as interesting as the comedy or the characters, but with an &quot;evil&quot; group trailing the Saiyuki boys, a few crazy demons here and there, and a huge secret from the past ... on their backs, it does keep you interested to the very end.\n\nArt: The art style for Saiyuki is done in a way that it preserves the original manga style. While at times the drawings appear a little weird (and maybe disproportionate), the overall style is amazing. Each character design is different from the next. I like the art style. It's unique and in a way, beautiful.\n\nSound: The music for Saiyuki is catchy. Each background song is nice and fits almost perfectly with the mood. The openings and closings are addicting to listen to. As for the voice acting, nothing better can compare (for both Japanese and English). The Japanese version is as good as any Japanese version made, with the talents of Souchirou Hoshi and Akira Ashida (along with many more). The English dub, however, goes almost above and beyond. With Greg Ayres as Son Goku (and in his first major role), Vic Mignogna as Kougaiji, and David Matranga as Genjo Sanzo, the dub itself rocks! Considering it was translated a few years back, the acting beats that of most of the newly translated dubs of the current years (such as Bleach, Death Note, etc.). To finish, the sound for the series is perfect.\n\nCharacter: The characters for Saiyuki are amazing. With Son Goku (the monkey king), a fiery boy with a knack for being loud and a love for meat buns. . . With Cho Hakkai, the calm and laid-back man with a tragic past. . . With Genjo Sanzo, a priest with no care for following the rules and a cigarette always in hand. . . With Sha Gojyo, a perverted half-demon with a love for smoking, drinking, and woman. Each of the four main characters are unique in their own way. Even the bad guys are interesting (with the Kougaiji group being just as cool as the Saiyuki boys)!!! All in all, the characters are definitely a part of what makes the series addicting.\n\nEnjoyment: Oh, where to start? From the action-packed adventure to the slap-stick comedy that continues throughout the entire series, the enjoyment is absolutely outstanding. The interactions between characters, the awesome voice talents, and the beautiful art style. . . All add up to a great watch that makes you want to finish all 50 episodes as soon as you can.\n\nOverall: The series is amazing, something to watch over and over without growing bored. I might be giving it a little too much credit, but then again, I personally think Saiyuki is one of the best. Hopefully others (such as those who might possibly read this review) will enjoy it as much as myself.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nWhere do I start......I couldn't even finish this crap, only mad it 25 episodes in. The character animation was fine but stills during fight scenes were terrible. There was no character development and even though it has a long complex story they came across to me as stand alone. Their attempts at humor just seemed lackluster and homosexual at best. Wouldn't recommend this for anyone. 3 is probably a high rating for this and I'm ashamed to say that i spent $70.00 on this garbage. To make it worse the place I bought it wouldn't let me trade it in......guess ... they knew it was crap too!!!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nWell, I have to say that this is one of my favorite shows even if it does have some flaws. We open with one of the most epic narrations by Sanzo and then get into the bad ass additude as he attacks Goku. The why the show introduces the characters is actually one of the reasons why I really like this show. We see each character in their ‘element’ so to speak and not all at once. It also doesn’t give us a whole lot of narration about these characters because they don’t really need it this early in the show. We get small tastes ... of the personalities, then bring them all together. I do wish that they had a little more information on how the group did meet earlier in the series then they do though. The series seems to believe that we have all seen the manga and since I have not, it makes me feel a bit out of the loop. It is a double edged sword because for me, I want to know more but for others, it can throw them off.\n\nWe see that Sanzo is not like many monks around the temple, but we never really see his past until later in the series though we do get a one second glimse of someone who died in front of him as a child. It seems that the only person he really listens to is the goddess but when he is hanging around the other characters, I can sort of understand.\n\nGoku is actually rather annoying in the first part, acting like a little child and yet the little things he does make him seem even more like a monkey then a little boy. He is rather innocent, and As the series goes on, he grows more and more. He is the only one that we get a little piece of the past right up front but they don’t explain much more then a 5 minute clip.\n\nGojyo is pretty much a womanizer and gambler. He seems to always start fighting with Goku as though they are brothers and its fun to watch seeing as how I have a brother myself and we used to fight a lot. Although he is like that, he actually has a good heart he shows every once in a while. He doesn’t really show it to the others but there are some places where this good heart shows.\n\nHakkai is rather sweet at least when it comes to children and always willing to help others even if they aren’t rather nice at first. He is more level headed then any of the other characters. Although he is level headed, he tends to get scary in certent situations. He shows a rather masicistic side in a way.\n\nThe goddess is rather odd, sometimes sounding really wise and sometimes she sounds like she just wants to have a little fun with the characters. She actually really interesting\n\nI love the fact that this show not only makes us feel for the main characters, but for some of the enemies as well. Not all of them are bad for bad sake. Now sadly, I really wish they did have a bad ass girl in their group. Without the girl, the group makes me think of yoai like a lot of other people I know. There are a lot of interesting groupings that I like and I’m sorry I’m getting into my fan girl love again.\n\nSadly, there is no ending to this really. It seems to go in arks like Pokemon or Inuyasha but doesn’t get to the ending of the story. There are times where is does become boring because they keep walking and riding with some of the same old jokes that they normally do where Goku fights with Gojyo and Sanzo threatens to kill them. Fighting scenes do get bad once in a while but yet are still interesting in some places.\n\nI really wonder some of the choices that they do for the artwork like the very first part when Sanzo is saying the only one he can trust is himself, why do they show him naked when he does this? Now, there are many times that the characters have long limbs or long necks and it changes once in a while but because of how the story is, I was able to over look it for the most part. The tiny waists though and sometimes broken eyes area bothers me a bit.\n\nThe music is pretty bad ass. The first opening is highly addictive to listen to and actually fits the series rather good. I’m not so sure about the ending song though, it’s alright but not something I would listen over and over again. I skipped it most of the time. Sadly, some of the voices aren’t that great or the prononciations are bad but at least the main cast is pretty decent so I don’t have much problem with them. This is not the show for little kids as they don’t hold back on the language. It works for the personalities but it’s a lot.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nMinekura Kazuya is an absolutely phenomenal storyteller. I mean don’t get me wrong, I love lots of mangas of all genres and whatnot but Minekura’s story is definitely a one of a kind gem. The main cast of this series, the Sanzo Ikkou a.k.a the Sanzo Party are made up of four emotionally-charged personalities. Sanzo, the stubborn and quick-to-shoot Buddhist priest, Goku, the ravenous but extremely adorable Seiten Taisei, Gojyo, the flirt who walks and talks like a casanova but wonderfully clicks into a comedic duo with Goku and last but not least, Hakkai who is a sweet but simultaneously a scary man with patience ... like no other. Spinning a story from the legendary classic tale of the Journey to the West, Minekura’s characters carry dark emotional baggage that she cleverly weaves into their comedic adventures. Now, this is mostly from the manga but in terms of the anime series, Saiyuki has one of the best original sound tracks. From openings to background music, Minekura’s world becomes even more depth-ridden and vast. The melancholic music which graces the background of the Ikkou’s tragic moments gives the anime an absolutely heart-wrenching undertone but also brings amazing authenticity to Minekura’s story. Even with all the ups and downs the anime has suffered and successfully plowed through, Saiyuki remains an absolute favorite of mine. If you haven’t heard of Minekura Kazuya or her manga, I would most definitely recommend it.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nHow would you know if Saiyuki is right for you? Simple; Do you like bishounen [pretty boys]? Action anime shows with a heavy bishounen cast but very few females, like Weiss Kreuz or Gundam Wing? Mild homo-eroticism and sensitive male EMO-angst-ishness? What I just said my seem like I'm making fun of the show...but I'm not, I'm quite serious. This series has a lot of it, but I'm not necessarily saying it's a bad thing. What I'm saying is that if you have issues with these traits in this or any type of program then Saiyuki is definitely NOT FOR YOU! Because all you're gonna ... say is that the show is so “gay” and blah blah blah and not really appreciate it for anything else! Now, I on the other hand, LOVED IT! I wouldn't be the “Bishounen Hunter” if I didn't, hee-hee!\n\n~Art\n\nReleased in Y2K [Year 2000, for those of you who might have been too young to remember the now funny year 2000 “Y2K” Panic], this anime is definitely showing it's age. Because even if it was released in 2000 it was created with 90's technology and style....and probably with a smaller 90's budget to boot. And it so very much shows! There are some rare moments when there is some smooth transitioning and CGI being used, but they're used very sparingly, like for the flashier boy-band looking opening credits [which was nice, but it was a waste of resources if they aren't going to apply that kind of “GLAM' throughout the series, right? Since this would most definitely be considered a fighting-series, it's a little disappointing to see these sub-par fight scenes, this show cuts a lot of corners for the fight scenes: reused/recycled scenes and poses, excessive still imagery with people frozen in one pose and a blurred background...or NO background just a monochrome color. It's all just very cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap on the fight scenes. The overall art style is very nice I do like the lines, shading and coloring but it's pretty obvious all the focus were on the characters.\n\n~Sound\n\nUm wow, what can I really say? I watched this show in English dub and it left me stunned! And there is no qualifier to the word “stunned” you could take that to mean in a good thing or a bad thing.....I mean I was just fucking stunned!!! I mean was anyone else surprised by the frequency of the foul words pouring out of everyone's mouth? I mean, at one point people were calling each other “faggot” and such................like, REALLY??? Are we REALLY gonna go there? Like do we really have to throw words like that word around in order to reinforce the masculine image? And the sad part is I know fully well why they did it, it wasn't the creator's doing [that's for sure] and not the voice actors' fault either [they're just doing their job], no this is something that the American distributors felt they needed to do to “butch up” the male images so American male viewers wouldn't detect the underlying softness of the male characters [typical pre-Y2K mentality] and watch and enjoy the show [of course it didn't work, and many American males still thought the show was horrendously gay], But thanks to [post Y2K phenomenons like] the bishounen craze, the appearance of the metro-sexual, yaoi, shounen-ai and of course fan-girls, people are understanding it's OK to present other forms of masculinity in anime [and many other products] and they will STILL SELL!\n\nThat being said, I'm still not so impressed by the English voice cast it's 50/50. Goku sounds like he's forever straining to take a dump and Goyjo sound A LOT like Butt-Head from Beavis and Butt-Head [and is it me, or does he really have a slight lisp?]. I like Sanzo's and Hakki's voices, though, those seem very fitting to me.\n\nThe music I totally loved, they were very appropriate for a show like this.\n\n~Story\n\nI'll be honest. the story is kind of lacking, and this is probably due to the fact that this anime is based from one of those infinitely running manga series, so the main plot doesn't really go anywhere. The [Homura] arc from the second season when more characters are introduced and the gods come to fight seems pretty interesting...but there's no real momentum to any of these stories till near the end, after watching 40+ episodes. The filler episodes are nice but of course doesn't really contribute to the overall story However my recommendation would probably be to watch this series with the idea that it's supposed to be episodic [it's not really supposed to be, but things move so slowly that you might as well consider it such] because the quality of the shorter stories are done pretty well and entertaining. What I perhaps especially like is that not all of the short stories [filler eps.] are senseless, comedic, happy-go-lucky stories where people are always getting rescued at the end of the episode. Some of them are quite dark and moody that deal with death and loss and other darker subject matter. And I appreciate stuff like that sometimes, because as much as I like comedy, when I choose alternate titles – with characters that look like these do – I want to see a much broader range of experiences and emotions.\n\n~Characters\n\nThey are fricken gorgeous! I'm a big big big fan of the way they look! Of course me being a crazed bishounen freak this should go without saying. But actually this goes BEYOND my general bishounen appreciation, I truly love the design of the characters, it's very new and very unique. I have a few wall scrolls and posters just because I love the art, the large calendars are fricken GORGEOUS and totally worth the money, go out and buy them if you can! The art was so good that I had looked up the name of the artist “Kazuya Minekura” He does very beautiful work, and you can totally tell his style a mile away....the ONLY reason I haven't read the manga is because it's ongoing. I hate being dragged along and kept in suspense over things, but once it's done I'll start buying the volumes for my library. And I'm not saying just the guys are good looking, so are the females but at some angles, while the “duck-bill” lip thing seems OK on the guys....when the Merciful Goddess does it [it's not cute]...lol,no it isn't in the least!\n\nWith bishounen anime, it's hard to have a favorite; Goku seems to be the anime fave but I like Sanzo's look and personality it seems to be the most consistent, Goyjo looks great with long hair but with short hair not so much and I'm not too crazy about the 90's style pointy eyelash-thing going on there....Hakki is cute and sweet but also on the blander side of things. Kougaji is probably my fave as far as visual presentation goes [I love dark-tanned anime characters generally].\n\n~Verdict\n\nOK so I don't know if Kazuya Minekura is gay or not [just based on the character designs – more than likely, he is] but if he is, then he's kinda like me with respect to presenting alternate views of masculinity. Because if the characters are NOT meant to be gay, they are A GREAT deal more sensitive/compassionate than the standard hetero-male represented in most anime shows.....but if they ARE gay [because there is that underlying gay subtext that everyone seems to be picking up on, lol], then at least they aren't “KIREPAPA” gay. Which is to say they aren't hyper, over-sexualized, slap-sticky, SUPER-fem [which is not a bad thing, per se, but the stereotyping is getting out of hand]. I came across this series because it does appear as a recommendation on quite a few yaoi/shounen-ai sites, that being said this is really only “regular” series with a lot of “slash” potential.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nIf you like the manga, for all that is good in this world, don't ruin it and watch the anime. Sure, the storyline is top notch in my opinion... but the TERRIBLE voice acting in BOTH English AND Japanese is just not worth the pain of watching it. If you would sit around and watch 50 episodes, then there is no reason why you can't go out and read 9 volumes. It would take you less time and you'd enjoy yourself more. This is not to say it's not an enjoyable anime. If you can get over the awful voices than it's still a pretty ... fair anime. The animation is kind of half-assed though. In comparison to the beautiful manga art of Kazuya Minekura's, the anime just kind of rips the characters up and makes them incredibly shiny (shading wise) and rather strange in hairstyle. There are quite a few points where the four main characters just don't seem portrayed correctly AT ALL. Not to mention most of the youkai in quite a few of the episodes are just terrible stereotypical excuses for muscular human beings with large ears and funny colored skin. Oh and let's not forget the feral set of canines complete with each demon!\n\nIf you must however feel connected to the Saiyuki anime in some way shape or form, I suggest a soundtrack or something. Then you can better use your time; instead of watching all 50 episodes, grab volumes 1-9, play a few of the anime theme songs, and enjoy. (And then you can grab Saiyuki Reload volumes 1-8 too!)\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThe characters are brilliant, but also cliche. The music is awesome, but the voices are awkward. The design is wonderful, but the animation is clunky.\n\nUltimately, this show somehow became one of my favorites.\n\nThe story is one of the most important parts of an anime, and to be honest, it's a bit lacking. Many individual episodes stand on their own, and sometimes it's hard to discern what is filler and what is driving the plot forward. The ending felt rushed. However, where it fails in tying together a plot, it succeeds in creating characters you want to root for, which is my second point....\n\nThe characters are ... very interesting puzzles. You think you have it figured out at the beginning - the angry one, the womanizer, the calm guy, and the childish guy. But there's more to it. You see why they are how they are and how their pasts haunt them. And they're likable, too. Of course, Sanzo would be a nightmare in real life, but from the distance of fiction, he's enjoyable to watch.\n\nOverall, it's enjoyable. There's some intangible aspect that brings one back to watch it every time. I can go on and on about the flaws, but when it does something right, it does it right. Take a look at it, decide for yourself. But I can guarantee it, at the very least, won't be a complete waste of time.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI got into this one because I heard it had a similar vibe to Yu Yu Hakusho, another fantasy series revolving around a four man main cast. For the most part, I think Saiyuki does not quite reach the heights of storytelling that series did, but it does distinguish itself in ways both good and bad.\n\nFirstly, the plot is mostly episodic in nature, with copious episodes that succeed at establishing characterization and worldbuilding, but otherwise do not move the plot significantly. It is filler, but pretty good filler in my opinion, since it really gets the viewer immersed in the world. This is an old-school ... adventure story first and foremost, and the length of the journey is painted in the medium via this long-form storytelling. A certain patience is expected from the viewer as Hakkai's jeep slowly plugs along the desert roads. I think those who enjoy episodic series like Pokemon won't mind this at all, while those with no patience for filler will immediately drop the series, it is a defining factor.\n\nOne thing I heartily congratulate this series for is the main characters. They are all very fleshed-out, rounded, and compelling in their own ways, almost archetypically so. You have the womanizing water sprite Sha Gojyo, hot-tempered and vain like any seducer. There's Cho Hakkai, who arguably has the most fucked-up backstory of the lot, but nowadays acts as the driver and mediator of the group. There's the spunky kid tagalong, Son Goku, who is entertainingly whiny and always hungry, but seems to be the best fighter of the group. He also has a limiter device on his forehead which holds back a psychotic dark side that can't distinguish friend from foe, like he's on some Kid Buu shit. Fun times! And then there's my personal favorite, and arguably the main character, Genjo Sanzo. I like both his japanese and english voices (David Matranga has always been cool in my book). Furthermore, he's a huge asshole who spouts off action movie one-liners before putting holes in demons with his revolver, he's simultaneously very cool and very lame. Gotta love it! In general, the character designs are quite good.\n\nThe antagonists are hit and miss - the creepy doctor and whatever the name of the main female villain was, they were very one-note and forgettable. The Kougaiji group was alright, they were all rather sympathetic and fine enough characters. But the real badasses were the Prince of War and his two sidekicks, those guys were absolutely sick!\n\nNow, we arrive at the flaws, which are sadly rather striking. It is clear from the beginning that these guys are balling on a budget - the fights are mostly a series of still frames, recycled animation loops, and reaction shots. When demons are killed, they break apart as if they are made of glass. It rather reminded me of when monsters are destroyed in Yugioh. I like old school animation, but a lot of this was probably bad for its time, and it obviously doesn't age well. So if animation is a problem for you, turn back now!\n\nAs far as the voice acting goes, I can only speak to the English dub. I thought the main characters were mostly fine, David Matranga as Sanzo and Vic Mignogna as Kougaiji in particular doing a good job. Gojyo's actor came across as wooden a lot, as did most of the one-episode-only villagers and short-lived demons. I will give credit to the scriptwriters for including some swearing, Gojyo even calls someone a bundle of sticks at one point. They certainly wouldn't have the balls to do that nowadays, though considering how effective outrage marketing obviously is, it's a tactic that might get dusted off again at some point. But generally, I would advise sticking to the sub. As a sidenote, I really liked the first opening song as well, it had a classic rock vibe that was very unique in my opinion.\n\nOverall, the show is fine. If nothing else, the main characters are strong, the worldbuilding is good, and there are aesthetically pleasing moments. I'm interested in seeing how the 2017 series fares in comparison to this - I hope that it fixes many of the issues while contributing to the strengths. As is, I wouldn't go into this expecting more than some easily digestible entertainment.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nSaiyuki was the first anime I had ever watched and it remains the best. I don't think I will ever get over the feeling I have when I hear the opening theme or the piano version of 'For Real'. The characters and their relationships are all so well developed and wonderful, the story is brilliant and the art/music is spot on. You will definitely have a favorite character/character you relate to most, however, you will love and deeply respect all of them. Goku's story and his subsequent relationship with Sanzo will stay with me for a very long time. As this anime is slightly older, ... there are a few off things about its animation (like the amount of still shots during battle), but its merit is in its story/characters/humor so this doesn't take away from it at all.\n\nI guess the point I want to make about this anime is that it develops extremely meaningful relationships between the characters, its extremely well done and its something I hope everyone has a chance to appreciate. Please take the time to watch it - to me, it is not something to be missed.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI used to watch this anime when I was 12 years old. This anime is basically an adaption on the \"Journey to the West\" a Chinese novel. I also watched this show on TCS 8 Singapore Channel. However, the characters here are normal unlike compared to the one I watched in Singapore Channel.\n\nNow, the music is so engaging even the ending song which says \"You must fight against yourself\". This is the quote I will never ever forget. In fact, in life we all learn to fight against ourselves, defeat evil.\n\nSanzo is a priest who has 3 followers who are youkais just like in ... Yozakura Quartet. Basically, they wanted to protect the world from harm. The battles are all right. There is not much to say here.\n\nNow, we move onto the characters\n\nSanzo - calm and collected, badass also.\n\nGojyo - womanizer, badass attitude, not so annoying as Son Goku\n\nSon Goku - the derivation name of DBZ but this guy eats like him. But he can be quite annoying just like Sun Wukong. He is also a glutton.\n\nCho Hakkai - my favorite character in this series, he is polite, helpful and kind. He is also smart, calm and collected. He is also badass.\n\nWell, I wouldn't say I enjoy this anime a lot. Cho Hakkai is really my favorite character in this anime. He is actually the character which I can relate to the best.\n\nIt was so funny that Son Goku when travelling with them in the hot sun. He always complain \"Hot, Hot, I'm dying!\" HAHAHA. But to tell you the truth, Son Goku is really so annoying.\n\nIf there is no character which I can relate to, then I couldn't enjoy this anime. But overall I would say it was fun while it lasted 7/10.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThere are few anime I have loved as much as I have Saiyuki. The characters are fantastic, the storyline is entertaining, and the filler episodes aren't nearly so painful as in most other anime.\n\nThe art surely does Kazuya Minekura's original series justice. Although, the anime is old (anything older than 3 years is old by today's standards), so the action scenes are a bit less than interesting (yaaaaay for still shots!), but aside from that, the anime is very well-drawn.\n\nThe characters are excellent, (and sexy), and it's hard not to fall in love with each and every one of them. (but Sanzo is the best, ... in my not-so-humble opinion)\n\nAlso, this anime is actually one that I WOULD recommend you watch with the English dub. The English voice actors are actually very good (with a few exceptions), ESPECIALLY Doctor Ni.\n\nPlus, the dialogue is actually very good, especially between the four main characters. The English dub adds something to the show for us native-speakers that you can't get from the direct Japanese to English subtitles.\n\nThe only grievances I have with this anime are these three things:\n\n1. Some aspects of the characters background and stories have been deleted\n\n2. There isn't as much blood as in the manga. I mean, the demons just disintegrate into particles when they're killed, what's up with that?\n\n3. It ended before it got to the good stuff, and the good stuff got put into the later sequel series that are just painful to watch, so read the manga too.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI'm very late to the game with this one. I saw a couple episodes of Reload Blast and instantly fell in love with the characters. I was talking about it to a friend who is an intense fan of the original so I went back and started from the beginning, and I'm glad I did. I could have enjoyed Blast without having seen the others but I know now that I will enjoy it so much more having seen what comes before.\n\nWatching this twenty years later is pretty hard on the eyes. Animation has come a long way since then. If you can get ... past the nostalgia of the turn of the millennium style, it's 100% worth the watch.\n\nWhat I loved about it:\n\n1. The characters. The main characters, both good guys and bad, completely make this anime. Story, art, sound, ... none of it compares to these guys and how endearing they are. They're funny and sympathetic, complex and tragic, and so badass. There is nothing not to adore about them.\n\n2. The tragic backstories: everyone has one. But each one's somewhat unique and they play heavily into the main arc and many of the fights and singular episodes. It permeates everything are and that's how it should be. But they are also moving past them, not wallowing in them.\n\n3. I will freely admit I loved the male eye candy and there was a lot of it. It wasn't otome levels but so many of the characters are attractive and I love it. Don't judge. Guys like their anime girls in short skirts with big boobs. I like my pretty boys. It makes a great anime, awesome.\n\nWhat I didn't like about it:\n\n1. It got a little repetitive but only a little. Nothing terrible.\n\n2. Linlin. She's an annoying brat and I could have happily watched her die.\n\n3. There were a few pretty stupid episodes, mostly revolving around effing Linlin. Could have lived without those.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend watching this series if you plan to watch the rest, which I also recommend you do. :)\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nEveryone hates a critic, but I am used to haters so it's okay. I am going to be truthful and not lie to you guys just because this is anime. Honestly, this was not the best anime I saw. In fact it's number 8 in my top 10 worst anime I ever watched.\n\nStory- Let's start with the story. You have four guys, a priest named Sanzo, and three demons Gojyo, Goku, and Hakkai wo are going to India to stop the resurrecting of Gyumao. I never watched Dragon Ball Z so I am not going to say this show copied the whole story. However it ... did copied the traits of Goku in DBZ. I will explain that more in character.\n\nBack to the story. Their journey west is always interrupted by some demons or Gods trying to destroy them for a scroll Sanzo holds. You begin to feel tired of the journey and wonder will they ever make it west. The fact this is a episodic show is more stupid. Episodic shows never have a climax. They show stories in every episode or 2. This would work if the show was like Sponge bob where the goal was not obvious. This show's main goal, conflict if you will is obvious therefore defeats the purpose of being episodic.\n\nLuckliy, there are two more shows so the chance of their journey being finished is higher. I understand that this anime focus is the journey not the goal, but the characters haven't changed since the beginning making the idea fail.\n\nArt- The art is old looking and very PG. If you are looking for gory scenes go find a different anime because this one does not provide one. Even when they kill demons you see no blood. You only see the demons disintegrate with a white background.\n\nAlso to attract the male audience the women in this sow are degraded with big breasts.\n\nTo attract the female audience the main characters do some questionable things with each other. In the opening themes there are times when the guys look like wuss instead of strong like their personalities.\n\nLastly the backgrounds will be so plain like black and a character's face. I like seeing new things, but that fails. I guess they were trying to make the viewer use their brain to imagine where the characters were at times. Nice stragedy except most people who watch tv do so so they can use little to no imagination.\n\nSound-\n\nThe sound. The characters unnecessarily cussed all the time. It was annoying especially if it didn't fit the characters. The openings were fairly okay as for the endings idk because i never bothered to listen them. The ost in this anime were typical for this anime genres. However i found a good ost in this anime. It's called open up your mind. I'm listening to it as I write this review.\n\nCharacter- very typical. You had a womanizing, drinker/smoker(gojyo), pretending not to care character (sanzo), motherly like character (hakkai), and annoying, greedy character (goku). To address Goku in more depth I heard a rumor that he is a huge copy of DBZ Goku. People say Goku eats like the goku in dbz, fights like him, and is a monkey like him. I do not know if this rumor is true, but I hope it is not.\n\nThe character's story were okay I guess. Goku was the most predictable. Hakkai was the most cliche one. Sanzo was the most normal one and Gojyo was the most unique.\n\nEnjoyment- I liked the anime, but not that much. If i really loved it like so many others I would have finished this in two days not approx. a week like i did. I procrastinated because it was bad and i knew nothing will change. There was something that got my off guard, but it was only once.\n\nOverall- I will be nice and give it a 6. Don't take my opinion. Check it out for yourself.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThe story is fantastic, but that and the fun characters were pretty much it for me. I couldn't get over the lack of action in the fights, things were very slow moving, and still shots of things here and there. Just not very exciting. If your looking for a good story its worth the watch, but if you like to have an exciting visual stimulation with your story I would pass.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nA badass, gun-toting priest (Sanzo) has to team up with two equally badass demons (Hakki and Gojyo) and a really freaking annoying monkey demon (Goku) to prevent the resurrection of a terrible super demon.\n\nHere's my breakdown of the characters: I'm in love with Hakki, I like Gojyo, I tolerate Sanzo, and I would strangle Goku if I could.\n\nLots of violence on this boys-only road trip, everybody gets hurt, everybody kills somebody else. Character-building is something this series does really well, and it's much more interesting than the fights.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI really enjoyed the Saiyuki manga. It used to be one of my favourites, before the position was usurped by the likes of Berserk. It was funny, the characters likeable, and on a whole an entertaining and enjoyable work.\n\nThe anime on the other hand was not so enjoyable. Perhaps I am just picky about animation/art, but I was not a fan of the animation in the Saiyuki anime. I'm not sure what the budget for it was like, but from the two episodes that I watched, the animation style seemed to adhere to a principle of \"as little as possible\". You know those crappy gifs ... that have only part of the image animated? Yeah, that's what watching Saiyuki is like.\n\nThe art excepting the animation is ok, with some really nice backgrounds in some scenes. However, that doesn't make up for the crap animation.\n\nAs far as character design, the main characters are pretty bishie. Otherwise, not too special.\n\nBut hey, if you can get over the animation, I'd say to give it a watch. I'm not entirely sure how closely it adheres to the manga, not having watched the entirety of the anime, but based on my experience with the manga, it should be decent, with plenty of hilarity thrown in.\n\nWhere I'm concerned I'd rather just re-read the Saiyuki manga. Don't have to deal with crap animation, the characters are still bishie (if you like that), and you don't have to hear Goku's annoying voice.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThere are so many words to describe Saiyuki but i will try to keep it as short as possible. Saiyuki grabbed you from the first episode and it dident let go throught the whole series (Plus OVA's) Saiyuki hit you right of the bat with comedy and alot of it every episode there were many amazing comedy scenes that made you run out of air because you were laughing so hard but not only did it have comedy it had amazing fighting scenes and outstanding characters that grew in their ability to know who they are and also grow in power and understanding of ... the world. Saiyuki is at the top of my favorite anime and wont be leaving anytime soon. If you love Action,Comedy,adventure and hot guys than saiyuki is for you 10/10 i would also recommend this anime for anyone who likes YYH because they have the same feel.\n\nThanks hope you enjoy Saiyuki!!!!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThere's so many good review already, mine would be extra and might not help much but I can't seem to find anyone have a complete list of story order around the net though, it took me some time, I hope it helped anyone who interested ...
