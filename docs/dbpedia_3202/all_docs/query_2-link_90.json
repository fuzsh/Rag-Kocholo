        "text": "“I think it’s okay to cry because it means that our hearts are beating.”\n\n- Don’t Look Back Again (song from Saiyuki Reload Gunlock)\n\nDon’t Look Back Again is the first opening theme song of the Saiyuki Reload Gunlock anime and manga series by Kazuya Minekura. It was sung by WAG.\n\nSaiyuki Reload Gunlock is actually the sequel to Saiyuki Reload.\n\nThe Saiyuki series tells the story of 4 bishuonen (Genjo Sanzo, Sha Gojyo, Cho Hakkai and Son Goku) who have been sent by the Goddess of Mercy or Kanzeon Bosatsu on a journey to the west in order to stop the resurrection of the evil Demon King known as Gyumaoh.\n\nWhat do you think about this quote from the Don’t Look Back Again song by WAG? It sounds kind of depressing, no?\n\nAnd it’s not just because of the word ‘cry’ though that does play a part in making this quote sound and seem really quite depressing and sad. It’s also because of the entire phrase itself.\n\nYou can cry because you’re really happy about something, but, more often than not, when someone cries, it’s because they feel really sad, right?\n\nPeople cry because they feel so much pain and sorrow and they can’t take it anymore so they just cry, letting out all the feelings that they’ve kept bottled up deep inside them.\n\nPeople cry because they’re not okay, because they feel overwhelmed with all their problems and issues and because they might be close to their breaking point or because they just want to give up already and they don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nThey feel lost and alone, and, at times like that, you just feel like crying, right? Sometimes, we might feel reluctant to cry because it can be seen as a sign of weakness.\n\nSome might think that crying makes them look weak. And they wouldn’t want to shed tears because they want to be seen as strong and tough and capable of anything.\n\nBut, there are times when you just can’t help but cry. The quote from Don’t Look Back Again tells us that it’s okay to cry and that’s true because, what’s wrong with crying, right?\n\nSometimes, you just have to let it all out and cry as much as you want to. Wouldn’t that make you feel better?\n\nWhat about the rest of the Saiyuki quote then? This is the part that really makes the phrase depressing. A beating heart is a sign of being alive, right? If a heart stops beating, then that’s obviously bad. A beating heart - is that a proof of our existence?\n\nWe are alive, we are here and now because we can feel and hear our hearts beating. So, is it that our tears are also a sign that we are alive? We cry, so is that a proof that we exist?\n\n*Notes:\n\n- Image with added text was modified by Freya Yuki (CC:BY-SA) based on the image by CoDLia (CC:BY-SA) from deviantArt\n\n- Pic is meant to symbolize the featured quote from the Don't Look Back Again song\n\n- Saiyuki pic is from Amazon.com; link shown above"
