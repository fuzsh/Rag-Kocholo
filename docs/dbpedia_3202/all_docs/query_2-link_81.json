        "text": "I know that Saiyuki has two sequels as well as a prequel, but this review is strictly based on the first season of the series, otherwise known as “Gensomaden Saiyuki”. This is also based on the English Dub. Nearly 10 years later, I discover that the series is on Hulu, so for nostalgia I decided to marathon it! So here’s my first anime review ever! I hope you enjoy it!\n\nGeneral Summary/Background: Saiyuki is one of the many animes that was inspired by the Chinese novel known as “Journey to the West”. Shangri-La is known as a paradise where demons and humans live in peace. They lived in peace until a group of people want to resurrect the demon king Gyumaoh who was sealed off over 500 years ago. This causes the minus wave which causes the demons to go berserk and attack humans. So to counter all of this that’s going on, the gods send out Genjyo Sanzo, a human, along with his three demon companions, Son Goku, Sha Gojyo, and Cho Hakkai to stop the revival of the demon king.\n\nGeneral Review: I’m a huge fan of the manga, and as I’ve mentioned before I didn’t actually get to finish this show until about a couple of weeks ago, so I finished the manga before I eventually finished the anime. The anime follows the manga religiously up to a certain point, which is around the end of volume six of the manga. The rest of the series from then on is a completely new “filler” arc. Whatever was left over from the Saiyuki manga was eventually adapted into Saiyuki Reload. The anime is very slow-paced, and it doesn’t pick up until about the Chin Yisou arc, which is about 8 or 9 episodes in. A lot of episodes are filler and don’t have anything to do with the story, but some of them have some character development, and some are very entertaining such as the Imposters episodes and the drinking contest episode.\n\nI noticed that a lot of the filler episodes do follow a certain pattern which is:\n\n-Sanzo and co are going towards their next destination\n\n-Sanzo and co find that where ever they are going there is either a demon problem or they find something weird is going on. -Sanzo and co get attacked by demons who are trying to kill the party.\n\n-Sanzo and co defeat the demon and leave, while Gojyo and Goku are fighting in the background and Sanzo getting angry at them and threatening to kill them.\n\nSo that definitely annoyed me, at some point during my rewatch I got to a point where I skipped over a lot of the fillers because it was just so predictable at that point. But like I mentioned, some of these episodes are quite entertaining. As I mentioned previously, there was a completely new filler arc that was added into this anime which is known as the “Homura Arc.” The Homura Arc was interesting, however, a good majority of the episodes in that arc were filler with only few episodes focusing on Sanzo vs Homura and co. In that arc, they also thrown in a couple of episodes based off of “Saiyuki Gaiden” which is the prequel of the series which takes place 500 years prior to the events that take place in Saiyuki and its sequels, which I have mixed feelings about, it does help us learn more about Son Goku and the other three, but I felt like they could’ve thrown that more into the Gaiden OVA.\n\nCharacters: The four main characters and their relationships with each other can be best summarized like this:\n\nSanzo: Says he hates all of them, but in reality he actually really cares about them, especially Goku.\n\nGoku: He has a love-hate relationship with Gojyo, but he looks up to Hakkai and he really cares about Sanzo.\n\nGojyo: He hates Sanzo, he’s best friends with Hakkai and has a love-hate relationship with Goku\n\nHakkai: He’s the mother figure who cares about all of them and is occasionally Sanzo’s therapist.\n\nI’m not going to lie, the characters are some of the best things in Saiyuki. Watching their relationship and how they interact makes watching the show all the worth while. Most episodes at some point has Goku and Gojyo fighting and Sanzo threatening to kill them, while Hakkai is trying to calm all of them down. Besides that, there is a lot of character development, there are a good amount of episodes where we see the past of each of the characters and we see how deep and how far back their relationship goes with the Gaiden episodes that were thrown in.\n\nThe main antagonists such as Kougaji and co are the ones working under the ones who are trying to revive Gyumaoh. They really don’t seem like bad guys, and even in some episodes we see them working together with the Sanzo party. There isn’t much character development on these guys, I would’ve loved to see more on Lirin and Kougaji before their father got sealed away. On the other end, Homura, Shien, and Zenon are the main antagonists in the Homura Arc. They get a couple episodes where we see a bit of their pasts and we see why they’re trying to do what they’re doing in the final episodes. Honestly, I would’ve loved to see more on Kougaji instead of Homura and co.\n\nThere are a lot of minor characters to keep track of because of the amount of enemies that are introduced in the series. One last thing about characters I should mention, the original cast that does the voices of the characters are one of the best I’ve heard. Unfortunately in the sequels with the exception of Gaiden because it’s a different company that dubs them they use different actors. The original cast definitely brings out the characters personality really well. I’ve seen the subbed version as well, but the dub definitely tops it. (Don’t kill me lol).\n\nAnimation/Fight scenes: The animation was poorly done in some episodes, but in other episodes I found that it was okay. Compared to the other series such as Gaiden the animation there is way better. For an action/fantasy anime, the fight scenes were once again either a hit or a miss. I found a lot of the fight scenes consisted of Sanzo and co just standing there and just posing then killing their enemies in one hit with some smoke and other effects added on to enhance it. The battles against team Kougaji were usually very good, my personal favorite being Goku vs Kougaji, while the fights against the lesser demons were poorly done. The worst of it all was definitely at the end of the Homura Arc. The battle against Homura and his buddies against the Sanzo party I found to be very anti-climactic and I was very disappointed when I saw it.\n\nMusic: The last part of my review is music. I’m a huge music buff, and I found this series to have one of the best soundtracks and background music used. The background music ranges to sped up versions of the opening/ed songs to slowed down versions of it. The music definitely sets the mood for some of the scenes depending what it is. Also, the opening songs are really catchy and fun to rock out to. I occasionally find myself air-guitaring to the second opening during the guitar solo haha.\n\nOverall: Saiyuki has been and always will be one of my favorite animes. However, now that I watched it again I noticed all of the things that went wrong. Like I said, the characters are great, they really make the show, but it is very slow paced and if you don’t have a lot of patience you’re probably going to ditch it. My recommendation is to definitely go with the manga especially if you want to see the series as a whole. The manga is great, and you can also see how Minekura sensei’s art and style drawing the characters improves as the series goes on. Also, word of advice, this anime has a lot of cursing, a lot of booze and smoking. So I would definitely recommend it for older viewers….\n\nGrade:\n\nGeneral (Plot, Episodes, etc): 3/5\n\nAnimation: 2/5\n\nCharacters: 4.5/5\n\nMusic: 5/5"
