        "text": "Motoi Sakuraba (桜庭 統) is a video game composer who has written music for many video games, including the Golden Sun series and other Camelot titles, such as the Mario sports series. He is a rather famous composer in the game world, coming close to rivaling Final Fantasy's Nobuo Uematsu. Other games that he has composed music for are Enix's Star Ocean series and Valkyrie Profile and Namco's \"Tales of\" games (Symphonia, Phantasia, etc.).\n\nRecently, the official Super Smash Bros. Brawl site revealed a list of musicians that were hired to contribute to the project [1], and series creator Masahiro Sakurai describes it as one of the biggest music gatherings in the history of video gaming. Among the list is Motoi Sakuraba, and the site specifically credits him for having contributed music to the Golden Sun series. Amongst his contributions to the anticipated Wii fighting game's score is R12, a stage theme that is a remix of various battle themes from Golden Sun."
