The reviewer stated the series is full of morals and life lessons, and explains one of the reasons for its popularity. They described the visual effects as excellent, the episodes as full of seriousness and heart-felt emotion, mixing a great variety of humor, but criticized \"filler\" episode that neither advance the story nor show the strengths of the characters.[2] Manga News wrote the series has several flaws, especially in the beginning, but they appreciated the initiative of including the Gaiden part in the series.[28]\n\nWriting for Anime News Network (ANN), Bamboo Dong said he found \"the adventures of Sanzo Group with random people/objects and the concept of redoing the classic Chinese myth with modern day equipment\" to be interesting, and called Kazuya Minkura's story \"creative\".[29] Zac Bertschy of ANN criticized the anime series but gave an above-average score to DVD 7: The Gods of War; Bertschy also praised the art, described the show as a brightly-colored, well-designed world; praised its cinematic moments and fight scenes; and compared the improvement of the series to Rurouni Kenshin (1996), which has become more popular over time.[30][31] Darius Washington of Anime Jump said the anime is \"utterly pedestrian\" and that it feels like \"Ninja Scroll with a Weiss Kreuz complex\", and criticized the English dubbing.[32]\n\nLayla Lawlor and Barb Lien-Cooper of Sequential Tart give an above-average score to Saiyuki Volume 1: The Journey Begins.[33][34] Lien-Cooper, reviewing Saiyuki Volume 6: Demon Rising, graded it 8 out of 10 and praised the \"interesting plots with varying tones (funny, scary, tragic), some unexpected twists and turns, and especially the characters\". She also said the audience can see the depths of the characters and understand them. She also said the show's themes are \"quite allegorical and enlightening in a 'choose good' sort of a way\".[35] Fellow Sequential Tart reviewer Sheena McNeil gave a 9-out-of-10 grade to first volume, and praised the art and animation, which has \"some new styles of overlapped frames and use of static like shading\". McNeil said the story \"is definitely a new twist on the relationship between humans and demons as they normally get along peacefully ... [and] also combines a quest with a \"Good vs Evil\" battle\"; and called the themes and characters \"diverse\".[36] Later volumes of anime were also praised; McNeil praised the art style and gave a high score to Saiyuki Volume 3: Confronting Their Demons, and said: \"I like that the main characters are not completely \"good guys\"—they all have dark pasts (and three are demons) and they're only doing this because they have to\".[37] She also stated the art techniques used for the flashbacks and backgrounds are different to those of other anime.[37]\n\nSandra Dozier of DVD Verdict said Saiyuki \"sort of resembles a very pretty, stylistic Dragon Ball Z\", and called the eighth volume very enjoyable, and that she \"found this volume to be relaxed in pace, letting the stories unfold without rushing it. Fight scenes were excellent and engaging, but too few on this particular volume.\"[38] In her review of the ninth volume, Dozier called the disc a \"nice suite of episodes\" that explore the main characters' childhood memories, and said:\"It's interesting to see some of the past events for these characters, and to see a very vulnerable side of Gojyo, especially\".[39] In her review of the tenth volume, Dozier called its animation \"glossy and gorgeous\", and the fight scenes \"cutting-edge\", but she found connecting with the main characters difficult.[40]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
