        "text": "A place called Paradise. It is the origin of civilization and faith. It is a peaceful garden where humans and monstrous creatures have coexisted in peaceful harmony throughout all time. Suddenly, the monsters become violent and begin to attack the humans.\n\nThis vicious change is the result of an experiment to revive the great monster, Gyumao (Bull Satan). Bull Satan has been confined for five hundred years. By mixing science and sorcery, someone started the forbidden experiment that brings this monster back to this world. Bull Satan's revival is imminent. His negative power begins to spread throughout Paradise. The monsters and beasts become wild and the entire world suffers pending disaster.\n\nThe resurrection of Gyumao/Bull Satan must be stopped. An apostle of the Celestial Heavens, Sanzo, is summoned to take on the mission of restoring peace and order in Paradise. Sanzo recruits his old comrades, Son Goku, Sha Gojyo Jo and Cho Hackai. The foursome has shared much joy and sorrow and together they have faced many challenging missions. Thus, the outrageous young warriors set out for a journey toward \"Indara\", a country in the distant west where Bull Satan is close to re-awakening.\n\nIt will be a journey filled with danger and difficulties. Hideous monsters and evil sorcerers await our heroes in the narrow trek of jagged mountains, behind the sand of barren lands and in the misty and eerie swamps. In order to save Paradise from destruction, they have to emerge victoriously through all obstacles and ultimately prevent the revival of Bull Satan.\n\n[Source: ENOKI FILMS CO., LTD.]\n\nOnce, the land of Togenkyo was a peaceful land, where humans and yokai lived together. Then, however, men appeared who tried to revive Gyumaoh, the Great Yokai who was slain by the war god Nataku Taishi and buried in Houtou Castle 500 years ago, by using a forbidden combination of chemistry and magic\n\nThe negative energy waves this created spread across Togenkyo, causing the yokai to go insane and attack humanity. To save the land, Kanzeon bosatsu orders Son Goku, Genjyo Sazno, Sha Gojyo, and Cho Hakkai to go west. The four set out on a journey to stop the experiment to revive Gyumaoh.\n\nOn the way, they meet Hazel Grouse, who employs strange magic that uses yokai souls to revive the dead, and his follower Gato. The two of them join the party. And Ukoku Sanzo, a man they have a long history with, approaches in the shadows...\n\nUnforgettable characters, intense personal drama, and awesome action in a story about the bonds between four men!\n\n[Source: Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures]"
