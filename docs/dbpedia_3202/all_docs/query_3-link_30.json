        "text": "Since there were two related stories that I wanted to share, I’m bunching them together into one piece. Let’s take a look at each one separately.\n\n▶︎ The Composer of STAR OCEAN THE SECOND STORY R: Motoi Sakuraba Interview\n\nPrior to the release of Star Ocean The Second Story R this past week, composer Motoi Sakuraba sat down with the guys at Square Enix to give this really nice interview, which is hard-subbed in English.\n\nWhy did you decide to become a professional musician?\n\nI’ve always loved performing, since I was in high school, and it’s almost like I can’t do anything besides music. I’ve felt this is the only thing I’m meant to do, which led me to pursue music professionally.\n\nWhat influenced your music?\n\nUntil high school and college, I was actually a part of a hard rock cover band. Specific bands that influenced me were DEEP PURPLE and Whitesnake, as well as a prog rock band called UK, and King Crimson.\n\nHow did you come across game music?\n\nI was originally a session musician, but it’s difficult making a decent living as one. I’m sure you’ve seen listings for part-time jobs in magazines before, right? I came across one for a gaming company, and that was when I decided to apply.\n\nWhat propelled you to work a part-time position at a gaming company?\n\nI didn’t know a thing about video games, but applied for the job anyway because I wanted to make a living through my music.\n\nWhat was your first job in the gaming music industry?\n\nMy first job was a game for the PC-98. The music needed to have a limited number of notes, and because I’ve never listened to music like that before, I found the experience to rather novel and intriguing.\n\nWhat was difficult about your first job?\n\nThe most difficult part was the fact that I couldn’t use chords, and had to play each note separately. I certainly struggled because as a keyboard player originally, I had a habit of relying on chords.\n\nHow did you come across Star Ocean?\n\nThere used to be a game developer called Wolf Team (now Namco Tales Studio) that I used to be a part of and made games with. When some members went independent, the first series they created was Star Ocean. Those ties eventually led to me making the music for the series.\n\nWhat does Star Ocean‘s music mean to you?\n\nI feel it allows me to showcase my most natural self, especially because there aren’t many titles that allow me to use synthesizers. There are many RPG games out there, but I don’t think many allow you to venture into space, while also providing an experience packed with fantasy and sci-fi elements, so overall I feel like the series really fits me well.\n\nHow do you approach music composition?\n\nIt depends on the song, but if I can get a hold of the script and gameplay footage beforehand, the harmony and melody comes to me at the same time, as I immerse myself into the footage. If it’s an area where civilization is perhaps less advanced, I might utilize more acoustic instruments, whereas if the civilization is more advanced, I might try to use synthesizers–specifically, digital synthesizers–as much as I can.\n\nWhat’s something you’re attentive about when composing?\n\nBack in the day, there were only eight available polyphonic tones and the memory size for tunes was much smaller. At the time, I was also creating tunes, so I recall things were incredibly difficult. For example, if there were ever a silent 4-bar segment within a song, I had to fit in a different tune to meet the required polyphonic numbers. As such, if you ever examined the raw data, it’s extremely complex. In an oboe part, I made a program change and suddenly include a timpani part, but those adjustments were needed to make the tracks fit within eight polyphonic song.\n\nHow has incorporating stringed instruments affected the music?\n\nWhile some of the arrangements are close to the original tracks, some [of the new tracks] incorporate string instruments. I hope you would enjoy the expanded range of expressions that comes from it.\n\nWhich tracks do you personally like?\n\nSince I’ve always loved band music, my favorite tracks are definitely the battle and boss tracks.\n\nWhat is the most important thing to keep in mind, when composing music?\n\nIn games, I always consider the player to be the most important, so I try to make music that doesn’t interfere with the user’s gameplay experience as much as possible.\n\nHow do you approach music composition within a changing landscape?\n\nThe approach to composing music hasn’t really changed. There are some differences in the sense that we can utilize more numbers of notes compared to before, but I don’t think the fundamental process of composing a melody or harmony has really shifted.\n\nHow do you express your personal individuality through music?\n\nI’m often asked that question, but I don’t know myself. It’s not something I’m particularly conscious about while making music. Maybe my individuality shines through because I’m not conscious of it; either way, I’m not really sure.\n\nWhat’s a challenge you’d like to take on moving forward?\n\nI’d love to work on a game that incorporates more performative music. Maybe a song that includes an improvised piano segment, or a game that utilizes band music… those would be projects I’d love to experiment with. When it comes to Star Ocean specifically, my hope is that the series would continue to do well into the future, and that I can also continue working on its music.\n\nStar Ocean is an incredibly fun RPG, featuring a ton of gameplay elements. There’s a wide breadth of music as well, so I think you’ll enjoy it.
