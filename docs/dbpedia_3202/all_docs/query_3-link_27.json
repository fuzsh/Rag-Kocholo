        "text": "Video game music is a very young medium. The first video game, “Pong,” was only released in 1972. However, video game music has come a long way since then.\n\nThe amazing thing about video game music is that it not only spans the nostalgic and unforgettable chiptunes of the ’90s, but also the sweeping orchestral suites from games like Skyrim and World of Warcraft.\n\nWhether you’re looking for inspiration, seeking to broaden your musical horizons, or just want a crash course on some of the best in the biz, here are 40 of the best and most famous video game composers of all time.\n\nNote: I’ve included the composers that have not only made excellent music but also have had the greatest impact on progressing the video game music industry as a whole.\n\n40 of the Best Video Game Music Composers\n\n(In no particular order)\n\nWhen you think “video game music,” a Koji Kondo song more than likely comes to mind. Koji Kondo is nothing short of a legend in the video game music industry.\n\nHe’s best known for his work on the Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda franchises, but he has also composed music for Star Fox, F-Zero, and many other Nintendo games.\n\nKondo always had a fascination with music but never thought he’d pursue it as a career. In university, he played in several rock, jazz, and fusion bands, the influences of which ultimately bled into his later composition work.\n\nAfter seeing an ad at his university, he took a job at Nintendo as a composer, sound designer, and programmer. He brought a rare blend of technical and musical knowledge to the fledgling game company and has since composed some of the most memorable tunes in history.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time soundtrack is, in my mind, a perfect soundtrack and his magnum opus. His mastery of multiple genres in that soundtrack is unprecedented in game composition and worthy of the highest praise.\n\nHis philosophy, which he states often in interviews, is that the music in a video game mustn’t distract, but rather enhance the gameplay experience.\n\nPerhaps it’s that philosophy that’s led to success… or perhaps he’s just an incredible composer who was in the right place at the right time.\n\nAfter his work on The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask, Kondo took a more high-level director role at Nintendo, overseeing and maintaining that iconic Nintendo musical aesthetic.\n\nThat said, he’ll occasionally get back in the saddle and compose, gracing us with tunes like the Main Theme of Super Mario Maker and the Steam Gardens theme from Super Mario Odyssey.\n\nIt’s impossible to pigeonhole Koji Kondo as having a particular style, as his catalog includes tracks in almost all genres, from afro-pop to Latin to heavy metal to bluegrass.\n\nSome of Kondo’s most iconic work includes:\n\nGround BGM from Super Mario Bros. (aka, the classic Mario theme)\n\nOverworld Theme from The Legend of Zelda series\n\nDire, Dire Docks from Super Mario 64\n\nOpening Theme from Star Fox 64\n\nAnd that’s just scratching the surface. It’s not wrong to say that Koji Kondo has had the single greatest impact on video game music as an art form.\n\nFun fact: the first few renditions of the classic Mario theme were universally panned by Kondo’s fellow Nintendo colleagues (including the legendary Shigeru Miyamoto himself). The theme we know and love today was the result of many iterations.\n\nIt just goes to show that even the best in the business experience rejection and miss the mark sometimes!\n\nRight alongside Koji Kondo as one of the most iconic composers of all time is Nobuo Uematsu.\n\nHe’s best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series, having composed music for every main entry in the series up until Final Fantasy IX.\n\nWhen it comes to writing sweeping, emotional RPG music and operatic anthems, there is simply no one better.\n\nIn addition to the Final Fantasy games, Uematsu has also composed music for several other franchises such as Chrono Trigger, Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon, and Nier: Automata.\n\nAt age 11, he started taking piano lessons and soon began to develop his own compositions. However, it wasn’t until high school that video games entered the picture.\n\nWhile working in a music rental shop in Tokyo, a man propositioned Uematsu to score some video games. This man was employed by a little-known game company called Square, which would go on to create some of the best JRPGs of all time.\n\nSome of Nobuo’s most iconic work includes:\n\nMain Theme from Final Fantasy\n\nOne-Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII\n\nAerith’s Theme from Final Fantasy VII\n\nTo Zanarkand from Final Fantasy X\n\nFun fact: Nobuo also composed the incredible opening theme to Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which was kind of a surprising choice considering his lack of work on Nintendo franchises. I think the results speak for themselves:\n\nMasato Nakamura is a video game music composer, bassist, and vocalist best known for his work on the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.\n\nNakamura started a band called Dreams Come True in the late 1980s and released several albums before eventually getting into video game music. His bass chops translated perfectly to the “grimy” FM synthesis aesthetic of the Sega Genesis.\n\nAs a result, the soundtracks of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 were the perfect foil for Mario. Where Mario was upbeat and innocent, Sonic was edgy and cool, while still maintaining killer melodies and rhythms.\n\nI personally grew up playing these games so the soundtracks have a very special place in my heart. However, even without nostalgia goggles, these tunes slap.\n\nSome of Masato’s most iconic work includes:\n\nGreen Hill Zone from Sonic the Hedgehog\n\nChemical Plant Zone from Sonic the Hedgehog 2\n\nStarlight Zone from Sonic the Hedgehog\n\nYoko Shimomura is a video game music composer who has worked on several iconic video game franchises such as Kingdom Hearts, Street Fighter, Mario & Luigi, and Xenoblade Chronicles.\n\nShimomura got her start in video game music by composing for the 1988 arcade game Street Fighter II for Capcom.\n\nShe then went on to work for Square Enix where she composed music for several of their RPGs including Live A Live, Front Mission, Parasite Eve, and of course, Kingdom Hearts.\n\nHer style is one that spans many genres, all the way from intimate, emotive piano lines (Dearly Beloved) to high-octane rock anthems (Guile’s Theme).\n\nIn recent years, Shimomura has been working as a freelance composer and has composed music for several high-profile games such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Mario & Luigi: Bowser’s Inside Story + Bowser Jr.’s Journey, and Dissidia Final Fantasy NT.\n\nSome of Yoko’s most iconic work includes:\n\nDearly Beloved from Kingdom Hearts\n\nBeware the Forest’s Mushrooms from Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars\n\nGuile’s Theme from Street Fighter II\n\nIn the Final from Mario & Luigi: Bowser’s Inside Story\n\nFun fact: Yoko Shimomura cites Dearly Beloved as her favorite original composition.\n\nKazumi Totaka is a video game music composer, sound designer, and voice actor. He has worked on several Nintendo franchises such as Animal Crossing, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and the Wii Sports series.\n\nTotaka’s first video game composition was for the 1992 game X, which was followed by work on Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.\n\nTotaka then took over as the sound designer for the Animal Crossing series and has composed music for every entry in the franchise since. He also composed music for the Wii game The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword.\n\nIn addition to composing music, Totaka is also known for being the voice of Yoshi in the Super Mario franchise. He also sneaks a small melody into all of his games, known as “Totaka’s theme.”\n\nSome of Kazumi’s most iconic work includes:\n\nMain Theme from Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins\n\nMain Title from Wave Race 64\n\nMain Theme from Luigi’s Mansion\n\nMain Theme from the Wii Shop Channel\n\nK.K. Bossa from Animal Crossing: Wild World\n\nBallad of the Wind Fish from The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening\n\nTitle from Wii Sports\n\nKoji Kondo, Masato Nakamura, and Kazumi Totaka have been the three most influential game composers for me personally.\n\nFun fact: K.K. Slider, the smooth-talking, guitar-playing dog from Animal Crossing, is based on Totaka.\n\nThe character’s name is “Totakeke” in Japanese. This sounds very similar to Totaka K., which is the common way to phrase first and last names in Japan.\n\nJunichi Masuda is a game composer and producer who has worked on several Pokémon games.\n\nMasuda has been the musical savant behind the Pokémon franchise since the very beginning, working on the original Red and Blue games as a sound designer.\n\nHe then went on to compose music for several other Pokémon games including Gold and Silver, Ruby and Sapphire, and Diamond and Pearl.\n\nIn addition to video game music, Masuda has also composed songs for the Pokémon anime series.\n\nSome of Junichi’s most iconic work includes:\n\nBattle! (Wild Pokémon) from Pokémon Red and Blue\n\nRoute 29 from Pokémon Gold and Silver\n\nGym Leader Battle from Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire\n\nPalette Town Theme from Pokémon Red and Blue\n\nFun fact: Masuda started as a game composer for the Pokémon franchise, but his many skills led him to produce and direct many of the games, starting with Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire.\n\nNow, he is one of the main people responsible for approving or rejecting designs for all new Pokémon. Man, as a 10-year-old in the ’90s, I would’ve killed for that job!\n\nAustin Wintory is an American video game music composer best known for his work on Journey, Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine and Abzu.\n\nWintory got his start in video game music by composing the score for the 2005 video game Flow. He then went on to compose music for several other video games including Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate, the Banner Saga series, and Tooth and Tail.\n\nWintory’s work on Journey is particularly noteworthy as it was the first video game score to be nominated for a Grammy Award. In addition to his work in video games, Wintory has also composed music for film and television.\n\nSome of Austin’s most iconic work includes:\n\nJourney Main Theme from Journey\n\nMonaco Main Theme from Monaco: What’s Yours Is Mine\n\nDelphinus Delphis from Abzu\n\nBonepit Exile from Tooth and Tail\n\nMichiru Yamane is a video game music composer best known for her work on Konami games and the Castlevania franchise. She has composed music for several mainline entries in the series as well as several of the spin-offs.\n\nHer style is heavily derived from baroque and classical composers such as Bach, which she fuses with Japanese rock and jazz sounds (a perfect match for a hardcore vampire-hunting series).\n\nYamane got her start in video game music in 1988 when she composed the main theme for the MSX computer game King’s Valley II. She then went on to compose music for several other video games including Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Suikoden III.\n\nMichiru’s first full score was for the 1994 game Castlevania: Bloodlines. She recalled feeling a lot of pressure to nail that “Konami sound” and do the Castlevania series justice.\n\nClearly, she knocked it out of the part, as she then went on to compose music for several other Castlevania games including Symphony of the Night, Harmony of Dissonance, and Portrait of Ruin. In addition to video game music, Yamane has also composed music for the anime series Wolf’s Rain.\n\nYamane typically composes video game music in a classical style with heavy use of orchestrated instruments. However, she has also been known to experiment with other genres and styles, particularly when working on spin-offs of the Castlevania franchise.\n\nSome of Michiru’s most iconic work includes:\n\nDracula’s Castle from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nHail from the Past from Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin\n\nThe Lost Portrait from Castlevania: Harmony of Despair\n\nFun fact: Michiru Yamane is a big fan of prog rock, citing Dream Theater as a major influence.\n\nKoichi Sugiyama is a video game music composer best known for his work on the Dragon Quest franchise. He composed music for several mainline entries in the series as well as several of the spin-offs prior to his death in 2021 at the age of 90.\n\nSugiyama got his start composing video game music in 1985 when he scored the Enix game World Golf. However, his first major project, which would prove to be his enduring legacy, was the first Dragon Quest game.\n\nSugiyama was unique in that he was one of the first game composers to record with a live orchestra and bring a truly “classical” sensibility to video game music.\n\nIn fact, prior to his entrance into the game industry, he was a trained orchestrator and composed for many musicals, TV commercials, and movie soundtracks.\n\nHe then went on to compose music for several other Dragon Quest games including Dragon Quest III, Dragon Quest VI, and Dragon Quest IX. In addition to video game music, Sugiyama has also composed music for the Dragon Quest symphonic suites and anime series.\n\nSome of Sugiyama’s most iconic work includes:\n\nDragon Quest Main Theme from Dragon Quest series\n\nBattle Theme from Dragon Quest III\n\nIn the Town from Dragon Quest VI\n\nHeaven’s Prayer from Dragon Quest IX\n\nYasunori Mitsuda is a game music composer best known for his work on the Chrono series and Xenoblade Chronicles.\n\nHe got his start in game music as a sound engineer for Square in the early ’90s. After helping out on a few games, he knew he wouldn’t meet his goal of becoming a game composer unless he took a risk.\n\nSo, he gave his boss an ultimatum: give him one year to compose the music for Chrono Trigger or he’d quit. Thankfully, his boss took the gamble and it paid off. Chrono Trigger is now considered one of the best game soundtracks of all time.\n\nAnd Mitsuda paid the price: he allegedly worked so hard on the soundtrack that he gave himself stomach ulcers and would frequently faint from exhaustion.\n\nHe then went on to compose music for several other games including Xenogears, Chrono Cross, and Xenoblade Chronicles.\n\nIn addition to game music, Mitsuda has also composed for several anime series and movies.\n\nSome of Mitsuda’s most iconic work includes:\n\nChrono Trigger Main Theme from Chrono Trigger\n\nWind Scene from Chrono Trigger\n\nTime’s Scar from Chrono Cross\n\nGaur Plain from Xenoblade Chronicles (in collaboration with Yoko Shimomura)\n\nCorridors of Time from Chrono Trigger\n\nFun fact: I’m actually friends with Yasunori Mitsuda on Facebook, but I’m pretty sure that’s just because he’s a nice guy and approves all friend requests. 🙂\n\nMahito Yokota is a video game composer who has worked on the Super Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart 8, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild series. He is a longtime member of the Nintendo sound team.\n\nHe is not only a great composer but an incredible arranger with a masterful command over the orchestra.\n\nSome of Mahito Yokota’s most iconic video game work includes:\n\nGusty Garden Galaxy from Super Mario Galaxy\n\nDouble Cherry Pass from Super Mario 3D World\n\nExploring the Sky from The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword\n\nJake Kaufman is a video game music composer who has worked on games such as Shovel Knight, BloodRayne: Betrayal, and DuckTales Remastered.\n\nHe has experience both in working on flagship franchises and on indie games.\n\nHe writes some of the best modern chiptunes and video game remixes around, and his work on Shovel Knight, in particular, has garnered critical acclaim.\n\nKaufman even streamed the entire creation of the Shovel Knight soundtrack on Twitch. If you’re willing to dig around, you can find tons of video footage of him writing music.\n\nAnd to maintain authenticity, virt composes all his chiptune in a tracker, a primitive-looking piece of software designed to emulate the sounds and unique limitations of retro game hardware.\n\nBut he’s not just a chiptune composer. He’s got insane chops when it comes to composing funk, jazz, and fusion tunes. Listen to this track from Mighty Switch Force to hear what I mean.\n\nSome of Kaufman’s most iconic video game work (or at least my personal favorites) includes:\n\nStrike the Earth! from Shovel Knight\n\nIn the Halls of the King (Pridemoor Keep) from Shovel Knight: Specter of Torment\n\nCounterfeit Mermaids from Shantae: Half​-​Genie Hero\n\nTitle Theme from Adventures of Pip\n\nHirokazu “Hip” Tanaka is a video game composer and sound designer who has worked on many classic Nintendo franchises such as Super Mario Land, Metroid, Balloon Fight, and EarthBound.\n\nHe preceded even Koji Kondo as a Nintendo employee and is one of the most prolific video game composers of all time.\n\nHe is known for his creative use of sounds and samples, especially in the era of very limited audio hardware.\n\nSome of Hirokazu Tanaka’s most iconic video game work includes:\n\nBalloon Fight from Balloon Fight\n\nBrinstar from Metroid\n\nSnowman from Mother (EarthBound Beginnings)\n\nWorld 3 from Super Mario Land\n\nFever from Dr. Mario\n\nBGM 3 from Mario Paint (this tune is way ahead of its time)\n\nFun fact: Hirokazu Tanaka has a background in electrical engineering and was one of the designers of the Game Boy Camera and Game Boy printer, as well as one of the programmers of the Game Boy audio hardware.\n\nToby Fox is a video game music composer and developer best known for his work on the critically acclaimed indie game Undertale.\n\nToby Fox’s video game music is heavily influenced by video game soundtracks from the 16-bit era, particularly those of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This is evident in tracks such as “Megalovania” and “Undertale”.\n\nIn addition to composing the music for Undertale, Toby Fox also wrote the game’s script and designed many of its characters.\n\nHe has stated that he was heavily influenced by EarthBound, a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that is similarly noted for its quirky writing and characters.\n\nSome of Toby Fox’s most iconic video game work include:\n\nMegalovania from Undertale\n\nUndertale from Undertale\n\nSnowdin Town from Undertale\n\nFun fact: Toby Fox also composed the music for Hiveswap, a game that is set in the universe of the popular webcomic Homestuck.\n\nJason Graves is a game composer who has worked on games such as the Dead Space series, Tomb Raider, and The Order: 1886.\n\nI got a chance to interview Jason on Composer Code, and he’s genuinely one of the nicest dudes I’ve ever chatted with.\n\nHe’s a skilled orchestrator, drummer, and musical alchemist, with a repertoire that spans many genres. He’s composed music for rock bands, video games, TV shows, and movies.\n\nHe cites composers like Bernard Herrmann, Jerry Goldsmith, and the band Rush as major influences.\n\nSome of Jason Graves’ most iconic video game work includes:\n\nThe Necromorphs Attack from Dead Space\n\nA Survivor is Born from Tomb Raider\n\nMain Theme from The Order: 1886\n\nFun fact: Jason Graves has a massive collection of animals at his North Carolina home, including cats, dogs, chickens, parrots, rabbits, and much more.\n\nGrant Kirkhope is a game composer who has worked on games such as Banjo-Kazooie, Donkey Kong 64, and Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle.\n\nGrant Kirkhope’s music is often described as being “catchy” and “humorous”. This is likely due to his work on the Banjo-Kazooie series, which features light-hearted and whimsical music.\n\nKirkhope has also composed music for more serious games, such as GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. He cites John Williams as a major influence and told me that he listened to the Harry Potter soundtrack every single day on his commute for inspiration.\n\nSome of Grant Kirkhope’s most iconic video game tunes include:\n\nMain Title from Banjo-Kazooie\n\nDK Isle from Donkey Kong 64\n\n007 Watch Theme (the absolute banger) from Goldeneye 007\n\nFun fact: Grant Kirkhope is a classically trained trumpet player, and he once got drunk in front of Shigeru Miyamoto.
