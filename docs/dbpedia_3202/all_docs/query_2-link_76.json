        "text": "Review:\n\nOwww, I've been waiting for this book for AGES, Released March 2004. This book is stuffed full of all those colour images, some not seen before and the colour images that were turn to black and white in the manga volumes... There is a spat at the beginning where there is only 1 image per double page, the other side is taken up by image description or something, but it's in Japanese so I don't know what it says, but this book is so huge it doesn't really matter cause it's only for about 15 pages or something.\n\nThe CD-Rom is something rather sweet. The book it's self is soft back, but there is a huge thick cardboard panel in the back that contains the CD-Rom, making the book basically hard-back... The CR-Rom it's self contains some Japanese, then it's on with the Flash goodies, Wallpapers (not as good as your truly *laughs*), a few icons, message cards and 2 Screen savers\n\nI couldn't get them to open through the flash file du to Language problems. If you cant do it either, Open the CD so you can see all the files, go into 'CONTENTS' then, 'SCREENSAVER', double click on the zip files, then on the .exe inside, it comes up with a preview, if it's like mine you get 2 choices that both say '????????' click on the LEFT one, then once that's done just click yes, and it takes you to your screensaver options... Wild Adapter is the only one that doesn't come up with gobaldy-goop."
