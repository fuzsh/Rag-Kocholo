        "text": "Since there were two related stories that I wanted to share, I’m bunching them together into one piece. Let’s take a look at each one separately.\n\n▶︎ The Composer of STAR OCEAN THE SECOND STORY R: Motoi Sakuraba Interview\n\nPrior to the release of Star Ocean The Second Story R this past week, composer Motoi Sakuraba sat down with the guys at Square Enix to give this really nice interview, which is hard-subbed in English.\n\nWhy did you decide to become a professional musician?\n\nI’ve always loved performing, since I was in high school, and it’s almost like I can’t do anything besides music. I’ve felt this is the only thing I’m meant to do, which led me to pursue music professionally.\n\nWhat influenced your music?\n\nUntil high school and college, I was actually a part of a hard rock cover band. Specific bands that influenced me were DEEP PURPLE and Whitesnake, as well as a prog rock band called UK, and King Crimson.\n\nHow did you come across game music?\n\nI was originally a session musician, but it’s difficult making a decent living as one. I’m sure you’ve seen listings for part-time jobs in magazines before, right? I came across one for a gaming company, and that was when I decided to apply.\n\nWhat propelled you to work a part-time position at a gaming company?\n\nI didn’t know a thing about video games, but applied for the job anyway because I wanted to make a living through my music.\n\nWhat was your first job in the gaming music industry?\n\nMy first job was a game for the PC-98. The music needed to have a limited number of notes, and because I’ve never listened to music like that before, I found the experience to rather novel and intriguing.\n\nWhat was difficult about your first job?\n\nThe most difficult part was the fact that I couldn’t use chords, and had to play each note separately. I certainly struggled because as a keyboard player originally, I had a habit of relying on chords.\n\nHow did you come across Star Ocean?\n\nThere used to be a game developer called Wolf Team (now Namco Tales Studio) that I used to be a part of and made games with. When some members went independent, the first series they created was Star Ocean. Those ties eventually led to me making the music for the series.\n\nWhat does Star Ocean‘s music mean to you?\n\nI feel it allows me to showcase my most natural self, especially because there aren’t many titles that allow me to use synthesizers. There are many RPG games out there, but I don’t think many allow you to venture into space, while also providing an experience packed with fantasy and sci-fi elements, so overall I feel like the series really fits me well.\n\nHow do you approach music composition?\n\nIt depends on the song, but if I can get a hold of the script and gameplay footage beforehand, the harmony and melody comes to me at the same time, as I immerse myself into the footage. If it’s an area where civilization is perhaps less advanced, I might utilize more acoustic instruments, whereas if the civilization is more advanced, I might try to use synthesizers–specifically, digital synthesizers–as much as I can.\n\nWhat’s something you’re attentive about when composing?\n\nBack in the day, there were only eight available polyphonic tones and the memory size for tunes was much smaller. At the time, I was also creating tunes, so I recall things were incredibly difficult. For example, if there were ever a silent 4-bar segment within a song, I had to fit in a different tune to meet the required polyphonic numbers. As such, if you ever examined the raw data, it’s extremely complex. In an oboe part, I made a program change and suddenly include a timpani part, but those adjustments were needed to make the tracks fit within eight polyphonic song.\n\nHow has incorporating stringed instruments affected the music?\n\nWhile some of the arrangements are close to the original tracks, some [of the new tracks] incorporate string instruments. I hope you would enjoy the expanded range of expressions that comes from it.\n\nWhich tracks do you personally like?\n\nSince I’ve always loved band music, my favorite tracks are definitely the battle and boss tracks.\n\nWhat is the most important thing to keep in mind, when composing music?\n\nIn games, I always consider the player to be the most important, so I try to make music that doesn’t interfere with the user’s gameplay experience as much as possible.\n\nHow do you approach music composition within a changing landscape?\n\nThe approach to composing music hasn’t really changed. There are some differences in the sense that we can utilize more numbers of notes compared to before, but I don’t think the fundamental process of composing a melody or harmony has really shifted.\n\nHow do you express your personal individuality through music?\n\nI’m often asked that question, but I don’t know myself. It’s not something I’m particularly conscious about while making music. Maybe my individuality shines through because I’m not conscious of it; either way, I’m not really sure.\n\nWhat’s a challenge you’d like to take on moving forward?\n\nI’d love to work on a game that incorporates more performative music. Maybe a song that includes an improvised piano segment, or a game that utilizes band music… those would be projects I’d love to experiment with. When it comes to Star Ocean specifically, my hope is that the series would continue to do well into the future, and that I can also continue working on its music.\n\nStar Ocean is an incredibly fun RPG, featuring a ton of gameplay elements. There’s a wide breadth of music as well, so I think you’ll enjoy it. Please give it a try!\n\nNext up, we have some additional details on the new original soundtrack for Star Ocean The Second Story R, which is ON SALE NOW for 4,180 yen / $37.99!\n\nYou can listen to clips from all tracks and purchase here.\n\nAnd here’s the teaser video for the soundtrack:\n\nTRACK LIST\n\n▶︎ Disc 1\n\nAt the crack of dawn\n\nSilent the universe\n\nFeel refreshed\n\nA feeling of oppression\n\nTHe venerable forest\n\nElectrical dance\n\nStab the sword of justice\n\nStrike your mind\n\nPure a stream\n\nMist began to form\n\nField of Exper\n\nWeathercock\n\nRescue operation\n\nCuddle\n\nA crisp morning\n\nShower of blossoms\n\nSacred song\n\nThe bonds\n\nWalk over\n\nMisty rain\n\nModerate\n\nHeraldic emblem\n\n▶︎ Disc 2\n\nDynamite\n\nIn a lightsome mood\n\nBreath of air\n\nDiscord\n\nThe Colosseum\n\nPyroxene\n\nOme of hope\n\nCeremight\n\nInvasion\n\nIntangible body\n\nLook forward\n\nKA.MI.KA.ZE\n\nDecisive battle\n\nThe Climax of the tower\n\nMysterious dreams\n\nTrumpet 1\n\nTrumpet 2\n\nElectric Piano 1\n\nElectric Piano 2\n\nHarmonics 1\n\nHarmonics 2\n\nHarp 1\n\nHarp 2\n\nCembalo 1\n\nCembalo 2\n\nOrgan 1\n\nOrgan 2\n\nShamisen 1\n\nShamisen 2\n\nViolin 1\n\nViolin 2\n\n▶︎ Disc 3\n\nA quirk of fate\n\nThe time light of dusk\n\nDesert island\n\nLose one’s illusions\n\nHydrangea\n\nField of Nede\n\nEndlessly\n\nTeary\n\nBreezy afternoon\n\nDeadly hatred\n\nTender spot\n\nTheme of RENA (music box)\n\nTheme of RENA\n\nWhite the heart\n\nLet’s walk in a parade\n\nCome on Bunny\n\nFortune teller\n\nCooking Master\n\nMission to the deep space\n\nShiver\n\n▶︎ Disc 4\n\nTengency\n\nInvade\n\nFight to the last\n\nBeast of prey\n\nMighty blow\n\nThe incarnation of devil\n\nThe ultimate terror\n\nCan you say Yes with eyes open\n\nIntegral body and imperfect soul\n\nThe fateful moment\n\nResolution\n\nWe form in crystals\n\nLive in plenty\n\nSTAR OCEAN forever\n\nTimpani\n\nOrchestra\n\nMerry harbor\n\n▶︎ Purchase from the links below\n\nSquare Enix Store (Japan)\n\nSquare Enix Store (NA)\n\nSquare Enix Store (EU)\n\nCDJapan\n\nDownload *Availability may vary by platform.\n\nYou can also listen to a couple of the remastered tracks on YouTube here:\n\nThe venerable forest (SO2R Ver.)\n\nPure a stream (SO2R Ver.)\n\nDeadly hatred (SO2R Ver.)\n\nShower of blossoms (SO2R Ver.)\n\nCuddle (SO2R Ver.)\n\nField of Exper (SO2R Ver.)\n\nAt the crack of dawn (SO2R Ver.)\n\nStar Ocean The Second Story R was released worldwide this past November 2nd. Originally developed by tri-ace and released by Enix (now Square Enix) on the original PlayStation in 1998, this new remake/remaster was developed by Gemdrops, breathing fresh new life into what had been considered the heart of the Star Ocean franchise. Some fans are even hoping that this latest release will remind everyone of when the series was performing at its highest potential. As such a beautifully put together 2D/3D hybrid, fans are also hopeful that Square Enix to continue this trend by giving other lesser known or seemingly forgotten and abandoned titles the remake treatment.\n\nGoing from personal experience, one of the main things about the original PS1 game was definitely the music, and with this new release, you are able to select which soundtrack you’d like to listen to: the original or the updated arranged tracks. Since the original tracks hold more nostalgic meaning for me, I chose the former, at least for the first play through. And rest assured that the new soundtrack is great if not better than the original with new arrangements by Motoi Sakuraba.\n\nIn addition to the music, you are also able to select between three voice recordings:\n\nJapanese voice from the PSP release (Star Ocean: Second Evolution)\n\nEnglish voice from the PSP release (Star Ocean: Second Evolution)\n\nNew voice recordings from the original PS1 cast\n\nAlthough he plays a relatively minor character, you should recognize the painfully familiar voice of Bowman, whose performance was by the late Keiji Fujiwara, also known for his work as Reno in Final Fantasy VII Advent Children and Final Fantasy VII Remake as well as his performance as Ardyn in Final Fantasy XV, among many others.\n\nHere are a couple points to watch out for in the new remaster:\n\nThe combination of the 2D sprites in the realistic 3D backgrounds will surprise you in a good way.\n\nAt first, you might feel a slight sensation of disconnect, but once you get used to it a little, you’ll begin to realize how well the 2D sprites mesh with the new 3D backgrounds. Its this fusion between the two types of graphics that make me very hopeful for other niche RPGs to get the same remake treatment like this.\n\nIt may be an older game, but it’s easy to play and has plenty of things for you to do.\n\nSome might think that since this is an older game the gameplay is going to be sluggish or clunky, but there’s absolutely nothing to worry about here. It plays exceptionally well and is right on par with modern RPGs. There is also so much character customization in this game that you could spend a considerable amount of time planning and structuring your party.\n\nDifferent versions of the character profile illustrations can be switched in the status menu.\n\nSelect between three types of character profiles from the original PS1 version, the PSP SE version, or the new SO2R version.\n\nIt is plain to see, from beginning to finish, that this is a meticulously crafted game that pays close attention to details in terms of visuals, voice acting, the soundtrack, and many other aspects, ensuring that it preserves the cherished memories of those who have experienced it. Not everything can stay the same, however, and one of these areas that received the most fine tuning was the battle system.\n\nLike in many other games of today where battle systems utilize a sort of stagger meter or shield gauge in which enemies will be temporarily weak for a brief moment, SO2R utilizes a bar of four shields, and once all of these are extinguished, the enemy will enter a BREAK sequence in which they will be vulnerable to attack with greatly lowered defense.\n\nAnother nostalgic area in the game is with the Assault Action system in which you can locate secret items spread throughout the world of the game that will allow you to briefly summon characters from the other Star Ocean titles.\n\nThere is also the new Bonus Gauge where you collect spheres that are dropped by enemies in battle, giving you various bonus effects for as long as you can keep the active Bonus Gauge status. Perish in battle or get ambushed into a back attack battle will reset this gauge and you’ll have to start over again, but it generally doesn’t take too long for it to fill again.\n\nIt may be impossible to modernize every aspect of the original game, and there will always be individuals who have their own personal preferences. Even so, this could potentially be the optimal way to enjoy the story on modern systems today.\n\nThanks, Inside Games.\n\n©️SQUARE ENIX 1998, 2023. Original version by tri-Ace."
