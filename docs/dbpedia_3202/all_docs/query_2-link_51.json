        "text": "Saiyuki Reload Blast is the newest anime series based on the Minekura Kazuya manga Saiyuki published in Monthly Comic Zero Sum, and it will begin airing in July.\n\nThis was announced at Saiyuki Festa 2017, an event that was held on Jan. 7 and 8. In addition to that news, a teaser visual and new PV were also made public!\n\nThe PV reintroduces fans to the seriesâ€™ world and also gives us a glimpse at action scenes featuring the 4 main characters. Seeing this will also make you even more excited for the original story.\n\nSanzo and his group head west in Saiyuki Reload Blast. They aim to prevent the revival of Gyumaoh, the source of rampant youkai. The battle turns violent as they near India.\n\nProtagonist Sanzo is one of the 5 high monks of Shangri-la, but he has no desire to devote himself to Buddhism. Instead he has a taste for drinking, smoking, and gambling. This sinful monk is voiced by Seki Toshihiko.\n\nSon Goku was locked in a stone prison for 500 years after commiting a serious crime but is set free by Sanzo. This character is voiced by Hoshi Soichiro. Sha Gojo, the half-breed born by the forbidden love between a youkai and human, is voiced by Hirata Hiroaki. Cho Hakkai, the young ex-human who was turned into a youkai after killing one and bathing in the blood, is voiced by Ishida Akira.\n\nNakano Hideaki will be director, Konuta Kenji will be in charge of series composition, and Platinum Vision will be in charge of animation work, bringing together the staff behind the July 2016 anime Servamp.\n\nThe Saiyuki series has been adapted into many different anime, but this is an entirely new staff lineup.\n\nAs of Jan. 9, the TV anime series Gensoumaden Saiyuki, Saiyuki Reload, and Saiyuki Reload Gunlock will be distributed again through Niconico Channel, GYAO!, Rakuten ShowTime, and dAnime Store. This will give fans a chance to refresh themselves on the stories before the new one airs."
