        "text": "December 18, 2018\n\nA warning: I am biased. This has been my favourite manga series for over a decade and I'm on my sixth (or so) reread. This is as good as I remember. Minekura has given us distinct characters, and even when the speech balloons aren't tied directly to anyone in the panel, you know exactly who is expressing which thought. The art is amazing, and sometimes I'll just stare at scenes trying to soak more in. And the drama/angst jumps in to contrast the humour so suddenly that I will need to stop reading just to process how much I love the moments/characters/everything. Or the humour bumps aside the drama, which is a delightful way to break the tension. In all, that's basically the theme of the whole story. Nothing matters so much you can't joke about it. Though at the same time, everything absolutely matters. Sweet and sour, baby.\n\nMy copies of this manga are all beat up, but I know I'll read them again. Everytime, it's a treat.\n\nAugust 17, 2014\n\nI'm taking KatiKat's advice and reading some manga to get me back into reading. Just not been in the mood for novels lately!\n\nSaiyuki Reload starts at breakneck pace and never really slows down in this volume. The Sanzo party are famous and being hunted by all youkai. There is a lot of subtext between Sanzo and Gojyo, I think, but maybe I'm seeing what I want to see ;-)!\n\nThe story Snowdrop is so bittersweet with a youkai who has escaped the effects of the minus wave doing all he can to protect the youkai children in his care.\n\nAugust 26, 2014\n\nLove it!! fun, and funny, and hilarious characters! highly recommend!\n\nMay 1, 2021\n\nI am curious about Sanzo. He is in a rush to get to the west to solve the Minus Wave mystery. Yet, the team keeps getting detoured and delayed. I have wondered what his thoughts are concerning these impediments to his mission. His focus is so narrow and he is so tightly wound compared to his companions. He does have compassion for the suffering humans and Youkai But he hides it (very well as a matter of fact!) After reading this volume I think I may have found an answer to my question. Perhaps Sanzo is in such a hurry because he fears his Youkai companions will go berserk and he will have to kill them as he tells Goku at the end of chapter 3. That would be a pretty good reason.\n\nJuly 2, 2018\n\nI ADORE this series. I have never found anything like. I have watched all of the anime, read the series over multiple times, and lots of fanfiction. I can’t suggest this more. It is cute yet not lighthearted. The characters are great and I love them all so much (I ship Goku and Sanzo forever). If you like m/m then you will like this as the characters have plenty of “interesting” moments. If you simply like an adventure then you will like this. If you like retellings then you will like this. Overall, it’s really good and you need to pick it up.\n\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\nThis series is so frustrating to me because it has such a good concept and characters with such a great group dynamic but 1) I don't feel like she really uses any of it to its full potential, especially from what I remember of the Reload anime which I watched half of and call Oops! All filler! and 2) it's really incredibly sexist, especially for something written by a woman. I guess that's probably what you have to do to get ahead in the shounen manga world especially at the time this was written but it's still just so disappointing to me. I'll probably keep reading it because I apparently just can't stay away but this series could be so amazing and instead it's just okay.\n\nOctober 9, 2023\n\nThis volume has one of the darkest chapters in the entire series, Snow Drop, but it also has one of my favorites, 3 Years Ago! So many emotional scenes! But of course some funny ones too!\n\nDon’t get me started on the bonus story! The bunny outfits had me dying of laughter!\n\nSomething this manga series does is give us little extras. From the bonus stories to chapter pages with the Sanzo part in different poses and outfits, it’s a nice touch that gets me immersed in the series even more. I love this series so much!\n\nJanuary 31, 2024\n\nI read the original series in 2020 and fell in love. Couldn’t get back into it for a while but so glad I did. The art style is always enough to keep me engaged but damn the story is so good too. Yakumo’s arc of protecting the youkai kids was depressing as hell, Goku’s snowy cage story was great. The characters are so rich and each volume even when it feels “episodic” is just so fun to read. Love this series. Not rly excited for the clone fight trope in the next volume though.\n\nOctober 24, 2023\n\nI've never been so amused by a summary.\n\n\"How do we describe a mostly plotless story about 4 friends traveling the world with the thought of saving it being there somewhere in the background?\"\n\n\"Just mention the bat ears.\"\n\nNovember 29, 2023\n\nHo amato tutto da Saiyuki a Saiyuki reload,gunlock...il mio anime e manga preferito,i disegni sono qualcosa di meraviglioso,il tratto della Minekura ê particolarissimo...scontri tra yokai,personaggi eretici , divinità 😍 Amo alla follia\n\nAugust 9, 2017\n\nDidn't add much of the main story, but for sure one of my favourite side stories. Actually wanted more of it.\n\nJuly 5, 2021\n\nAction packed but super dark starter volume.\n\nDecember 6, 2021\n\nThis is the first book in the continuation of Saiyuki manga series as the guys head west to stop the villains. I really love this series.\n\nJune 25, 2022\n\nCome primo numero mi aspettavo di meglio. Vediamo come continua.\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\nIf trouble follows you you’re probably on the right track. 🐒\n\nJanuary 24, 2009\n\nThe Sanzo party has become so famous as youkai exterminators that they keep running into trouble from villagers who have heard embroidered rumors about them and youkai are hunting for them as a preemptive thing. Humans who get to see the rude, crude, almost sociopathic actual guys in action tend to be a little less enamored. A few times people harp on the mostly youkai makeup of the Sanzo party itself, while the heartbreaking \"Snow Drop\" suggests that they might someday fall to the influence of the Minus Wave themselves. \"Snow Drop\" in particular is all about consequences and kills me every time. Yeah, life can't possibly be the same even if they stop the Minus Wave and the youkai regain their sanity. Too much blood has been spilled.\n\n\"Run\" is better than most \"For new readers, here's an introduction to our guys\" stories tend to be. It also turns the original series' concept on its head a bit by showing how the Sanzo party is becoming ever more hunted. Yeah, regular people would see the Sanzo party's blasé attitude toward killing creepy. Then you have the Brothers Hayabusa.... *g*\n\n\"Snow Drop\" is an exercise in tragedy and subtlety. Sakumo was a great character. Damn, poor Goku.... Sanzo's \"I would\" gets me every time too. Though I wish the kids had eyes! I know it's a manga custom but c'mon!\n\n\"3 Years Ago\" is sweet. These guys do care about each other, though you have to judge them, particularly Sanzo, by their actions instead of their words. Goku's fear of snow in this is nicely contrasted by his gleeful tromping through it in \"Snow Drop.\"\n\nAh, \"Death Match.\" It still amuses me that that Sanzo's far more freaked out by facing a doppelganger than the others are. And him breaking down while in a nicotine fit to smoke one of Gojyo's Hi-Lites makes me smile, particularly with the tiny caption of \"Ooooh. [Sanzo] does not approve\" when it obviously doesn't meet his high standards for a cigarette. And then there's that poor woman he boots into the next room! To safety, yeah, but there were nicer ways of doing it. Non-Sanzo ways, but nicer.\n\nThen the end piece has the Kou party in Playboy bunny costumes. Huzzah! Doku looks particularly funny. Ni Jianyi, you are a creepy, scary man but you have your moments.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nOctober 4, 2022\n\nOne of the best volumes in the entire series. Snowdrop might be the most depressing arc but it is also one of the best because it serves as a grim reminder as to why it is so important that the four go on their journey to the west. The last mini-arc is funny and sweet, so the volume is perfectly balanced.\n\nOctober 15, 2012\n\nSaiyuki Reload has started off just as amazing as the first set. And the end \"extra manga\" is killer. I was laughing so hard I was crying! Kazuya Minekura, you are truly a goddess in my eyes! My hero!!\n\nUpdate (October 15th, 2012)\n\nOh man!! Double the Sanzo party!! Too hot to handle!! First, I want to say I love the new/tweaked outfits! So sexy!! (Kougaiji's is hot too!!) Second, Hakkai looks SO HOT on the double page spread of them pulling their robes off. Oh. My. Ra. Seriously, I about fainted XD Third, the \"extra manga,\" as mentioned above, oh lordy! I laughed forever! Fourth, I love the color spreads in the front of these volumes! Delicious!\n\nI seriously just love this series so much! This volume was an excellent example of what I love about the series - there were moments where I was tearing up and super sad and then the next moment I'm snorting and laughing. The storytelling is absolutely amazing too, and I know I've praised the art so many times, but honestly, I can't praise it enough. Minekura-sama is incredibly talented it's ridiculous!\n\nAnd now, for your viewing pleasure:\n\n(boy oh boy do I love this picture!)\n\nThis has nothing to do with this volume, I'm just putting it up because I love this picture so much!! (It really should be against the law to draw men THAT sexy! XD)\n\nAugust 16, 2016\n\nAwesome! I didn't want Saiyuki to end, and it looks like it didn't - this picks up pretty much right where they left off! The first story was a great return to the beginning of the first series, reiterating: 'until the day I die, the only side I'm on is my own!' I love these characters! The chapters with the youkai children on the mountain top was really very heartbreaking. I think that man was very brave, giving the children a home, then killing them when they went insane; I'm glad he managed to kill the humans who slaughtered the children before he lost it and had to be stopped himself. That chapter was so poignant in communicating the real danger facing the Sanzo party - that any of them could lose it at any time. The flashback chapter about Goku's fear of snow was rather heartwarming, and it was interesting to get a look into Goku's psyche, he's such a comical character, sometimes you forget he thinks of things other than food. The last chapter threw me for a loop, I wasn't expecting duplicates. It's an over-used convention in action stories, but it still works well enough not to be cliche, and I am fully certain that with these characters, it's going to be thrilling. Can't wait to see how it will pan out in the next book!\n\nFebruary 18, 2023\n\n(review for entire series)\n\n“Fate is not something that is already decided; nor is it something you choose. By the time you realize, it is already there.\"\n\nThe continuing adventures of Sanzo and company. Honestly, I prefer the first two manga a little better. Saiyuki, Vol. 1 is one of the first anime I ever watched so it's very nostalgic for me and Saiyuki Gaiden n. 1 is just so awesome seeing everything in the past. This one is still really good, since we're REALLY starting to move the plot forward which is super amazing to see after what I feel like is forever with no forward progress.\n\nNext up: Saiyuki Reload Blast 1.\n\nOctober 6, 2010\n\nexcerpt from detailed review here:\n\nhttp://angeltyuan.blogspot.com/2009/1...\n\nSaiyuki RELOAD is the sequel to the series, making an almost complete reversal on perspective of the youkai/demons driven to madness and murder. Where Gensomaden Saiyuki (the main series) sets up the world and the characters, RELOAD delves into the other side of the story: the youkai who have not gone mad, surviving in a world of human distrust and want for revenge. The second half of RELOAD, the \"even a worm\" arc, deals with \"what if\" youkai souls could be harvested to bring humans back to life? The only catch is, they come back with an ingrained need to destroy other youkai. Ethics and alternate perspectives are the main focus in this sequel, and much is left ambiguous for the reader to mull over after the action ends.\n\nMarch 25, 2013\n\nThis volume covers several stories - we have our heroes come to a town where Youkai are apparently murdering women but the perpetrators aren't quite what they seem. Next we move to a lone, sane Youkai looking after a band of orphaned Youkai kids. This arc is fantastic. It's really dark as we see this guy forced to kill his charges when they turn. Things take an even darker turn when a band of youkai hating humans decide to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThe last part of the volume leads into the doppelgangger story arc and Sanzo comes face to face with himself! A real cliffhanger so be sure to have volume 2 on hand!\n\nVery silly afterward with costume changes. Kou as a playboy bunny. Hillarious!\n\nA great mix of humour, philosophy, dark twisted stories and fast paced adventure. As always mixed with stunning artwork.\n\nMay 20, 2008\n\nThe coninuation to the Gensoumaden Saiyuki. This is the next story arc in the series."
