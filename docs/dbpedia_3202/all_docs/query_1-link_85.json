And yes, \"holy crap\" is pretty much the only thing that went through my head when reading it. It's funny that nearly every other website I've seen talk about the SSBB site update is really disappointed, while I'm grinning with glee because of the music staff update.\n\nAlso, if there is no soundtrack release for this version of Smash Bros, there will be hell to pay. I'm still seething about the lack of one for the Gamecube game.\n\nAmazingu wrote:\n\nDoes this mean that all these composers will actually be actively contributing to the soundtrack, or will we just get lots of arrangements of their music done by someone else?\n\nBased on the phrasing used at the website and the fact that nearly all of them have never touched an actual Nintendo soundtrack, I think we're just going to be seeing lots of arrangements of Nintendo themes done by them. Not that I'd mind having characters from a lot of those third party games in Smash Bros. Brawl, though...\n\nCain Highwind wrote:\n\nRyoji Yoshitomi (Nintendo)\n\nHe still exists!\n\nIf nothing else the list is great for seeing what composer is freelancing or employed by some company.\n\nEdit: the most impressive part of the site for me is that all 6 (7?) language versions of it have exactly the same content, I hope this is an indication for a global release...\n\nI just got word of the news Nintendo World Report, saw that list, and rushed over here. As usual, it was already posted!\n\nBut man, did I almost crap myself when I saw that list... talk about a VGM fan's wetdream.\n\nQui-Gon Joe wrote:\n\nAmazingu wrote:\n\nDoes this mean that all these composers will actually be actively contributing to the soundtrack, or will we just get lots of arrangements of their music done by someone else?\n\nBased on the phrasing used at the website and the fact that nearly all of them have never touched an actual Nintendo soundtrack, I think we're just going to be seeing lots of arrangements of Nintendo themes done by them. Not that I'd mind having characters from a lot of those third party games in Smash Bros. Brawl, though...\n\nYup, and it even looks like there will be getting MULTIPLE arrangements of each track. So we could theoretically get Mitsuda's, Naruke's, Iwadare's, etc. take on the Super Mario Bros. theme... It says:\n\nMasahiro Sakurai wrote:\n\nOf course, Smash will let you enjoy music from a wide variety of Nintendo games.\n\nA number of individuals have put their touch on these arrangements.\n\nUsing the game music that has entertained so many as the base for new arrangements by so many famed musicians... Not too shabby, eh?\n\nBased on this next quote, I'm thinking we will definitely get multiple composer arrangments of each and every song:\n\nMasahiro Sakurai wrote:\n\nWe've asked our group of arrangement supervisors to listen to an elite selection of Nintendo music and asked them to arrange several of their favorite songs...which means there will be quite a number of songs.\n\nSo, hopefully, that means not only will you pick a stage in vs. mode, but you'll pick which arrangement of the song you want to hear during gameplay. That would friggin' ROCK.\n\nSeriously. Why wasn't Uematsu mentioned? It was reported earlier that he did indeed compose the \"Main Theme,\" and it was featured on IGN and on the old Smash Bros. Brawl site. It was even played as the encore at the Press Start 2006 concert.\n\nIs it possible that what Uematsu composed was simply a trailer piece? I suppose that makes sense in a lot of ways, but they went all out if it truly was a trailer piece. But even more so, you'd think they'd take the time to mention to Uematsu is contributing to the project on the new site if that is the main theme, given his popularity among game music fans. What's up wit' that?!\n\n\"Ocarina [Song of Storms\" ~ \"Ocarina [Epona's Song]\" ~ \"Ocarina [Song of Time]\" ~ \"Ocarina [Saria's Song]\" ~ \"Ocarina [Zelda's Lullaby]\"\n\nI thought that Ocarina of Time arrangement was pretty weak for quite a few reasons:\n\n1). I'm not a synth whore, but the low quality MIDI samples in this piece really causes it to stand out when compared the high quality samples of the previous three song samples.\n\n2). I was expecting something a bit more epic - how about a boss battle theme medley or a few of the major heavy hitters from the score? If I want an Ocarina medley, I can just throw in Hyrule Symphony.\n\n3). \"Ocarina [Song of Storms]\" was a bit off in two key places.\n\nI'm mainly disappointed by with reason #2, but I'll get over. Plus, they really need to polish up that synth, maybe throw an orchestra behind it - which would definitely redeem it.\n\n*sigh* I really wanted to hear what Sakuraba, Tsujiyoko, Shimomura, or Mitsuda would've done with some of Kondo's masterpieces. Hopefully one of 'em will still get the chance.\n\nIt's not RIGHT on the money is it?\n\nIt doesn't say anything about there being different arrangements of one song, just that you can adjust the likelihood of a particular theme showing up as BGM, which is pretty cool in itself.\n\nAnd more music can be earned by collecting CD's during battle, which should satisfy all the obsessive collectors amongst us (like myself)\n\nI think it's a very exciting feature, though I find myself disappointed with the synth quality of the arrangements as well. Melee really spoiled us, and when the theme for Brawl was revealed, I was led to hope for more of the same. The mostly orchestral score made Melee feel like a grand event.\n\nAt first glance, though, I thought \"My Music\" meant you could import your own tunes. The Pokemon anime has a number of nicely arranged battle themes from the games...\n\nAnother update. The dojo now lists the arrangers for all the songs in the game that will be available from the start (as opposed to the new songs you can unlock):\n\nhttp://www.smashbros.com/en_us/music/music22_list.html\n\nI'm a little disappointed that so many composers just arranged their original tracks (Shimomura doing Mario & Luigi, Sakuraba doing Mario Tennis/Golf. I'm surprised they didn't give Mitsuda something from Mario Party), but overall it looks fun. I'm REALLY looking forward to Yuzo Koshiro's arrangement of the Zelda theme though."
