You're the one and only being that I, War God Homura, acknowledge as the strongest.\" - Homura\n\nRight off the bat, I'm going to say that this pairing deals with two of the most horribly characterized people in the fandom. Homura/Goku is far from popular. When at all mentioned, it's usually within a Sanzo/Goku story, with Homura as the stalkerish third wheel. Within this miniature genre, Goku is portrayed as a feminine, weak (in every aspect) victim and Homura is the relentlessly cruel rapist.\n\nWithin this fandom, there are two main reasons this pairing gets little attention (despite what I feel are blatant innuendos in the anime). One is that most people who like Goku being paired off with anyone prefer him to be with Sanzo. This is, of course, fine. Everyone has their own preferences. (Of course, that isn't to say he isn't with other people, merely that it's a rarer occurrence.) The other reason is that many people find pairing Goku off with anyone makes them squeamish, due to his childish nature. This, too, is fine. For example, perhaps there is a parent who has a little boy, and whenever they see Goku, they see their child. Imagining their child in a sexual or even simply romantic situation may make them uneasy, and so when imagining Goku in a similar situation, they still feel squeamish.\n\nHowever, regardless of the reasons, these two have a strange bond. It doesn't necessarily have to be romantic, but in the end, it isn't hard to see it that way.\n\nSon Goku\n\n\"The people I liked were there, and they were happy. That was all, but that's enough. I always thought that was enough.\" - Goku\n\nGoku's role in the story is one of the longest, saddest, and most complicated. His life begins over five hundred years before the main Saiyuki timeline. From the very beginning, Goku has been an oddity-- a creature borne of the Earth, atop the highest point of Mount Kaka. As if this wasn't strange enough, he was also borne with golden eyes-- a trait Heaven considers the mark of heretics. Because of this, he's captured, chained, and brought before the Goddess of Mercy, Kanzeon Bosatsu, to determine what his fate will be.\n\nAs Heaven forbids killing, Kanzeon decides to give the little \"animal\" to her nephew, Konzen. This is the true beginning of the prequel, Saiyuki Gaiden. With Goku's arrival come a lot of changes-- and yes, one of these changes includes the death of three of his dearest friends: Konzen, his caretaker; Kenren, his \"big brother;\" and Tenpou, his teacher. Also, as far as we know, Goku does not know if his younger friend, Nataku, is alive or dead. Gaiden has not concluded at this time, so all the fans can do is guess at what happened after the four rebels and their hostage made it to their current hideaway.\n\nIn the end, we do know Goku is charged with the crime of killing heavenly beings. For that reason, and possibly others that are not revealed to the public at this time, he is banished from Heaven, his memories are taken, and he is confined within a rocky cage for five centuries. Spells are put on his prison, trapping him at his current age (between eight and twelve) for as long as possible.\n\nFor five hundred years, he has no contact with the outside world whatsoever-- albeit a point in time where a small bird finds him at the high point of the mountain. Goku treats this animal as though it were a dear friend. For the first time, he had something to do other than stare at the sun and wonder what he had done to deserve his punishment. When he wakes up to find the bird dead -- his one connection to the outside world, the only friend he's had in centuries -- Goku cries.\n\nGoku is \"reborn\" when a blonde priest comes to free him from the cave. Unknown to Goku, since he can't remember his life before the cave, this man is the reincarnation of his caretaker, Konzen. Now with Genjo Sanzo, Goku begins his life anew. Through this, Sanzo becomes the most important person in his life-- he calls Sanzo his sun. They form a strong bond through this, one of utmost trust and concern.\n\nMany people make assumptions on Goku's personality based on Gaiden alone. By the time we reach his current age in Gensomaden, none of these assumptions are accurate anymore. Now, at the brash age of eighteen, Goku has really lived. He's grown from a little boy into a young man in many ways. Naturally, he's older and taller; though still the shortest amongst the main group. But with that, he's also cocky, confident, a smart-ass, and -- face it -- more mature. Gone is the naïveté of the little boy who now needles Gojyo for being a pervert. He knows what sex is, now understands that there is more to life than fun and games-- though he still is extremely laid back and likes to go where the currents take him.\n\nBut at the same time, he's rebellious and fights against the current when he knows it's going to take him down a path he doesn't want to travel. He still has a lot of growing up to do, sure, but that's the real beauty of his role in the journey west. Goku experiences life, witnesses things he would not have otherwise if he'd stayed at the temple with Sanzo. He sees death and sorrow, thrills and excitement. He enjoys fighting, even boasts about how many opponents he's killed or taken down, but at the same time strives to help people and creatures live. He hates to see people he's grown attached to die. Goku needs reliability; he needs physical contact. He's strong and fragile at the same time. He's a child who wants to be regarded as an adult. Goku's basically your typical teenage boy growing into a man, full of controversies and even deep insight.\n\nAnd the strangest thing is, only his fellow heretics seem to realize just how special and precious he really is.\n\nToushin Homura Taishi\n\n\"Anyone who has to borrow their power from others is not worth my time.\" - Homura\n\nHomura's story begins long before even Goku's. His mother, a goddess, had an affair with a human man. As a result, a child was borne-- with one eye blue, another the golden mark of his heresy. For as long as he can remember, Homura had been confined within a dark prison in the heavens. He saw no light except for the torches beyond the bars of his prison.\n\nWhen many years passed and he didn't die -- and rather, grew into a man -- Homura was finally taken out and to the Jade Emperor. He was shackled by his wrists and ankles. The very first words anybody said directly to him were, \"How long do you plan to live?\"\n\nNaturally, Homura had a very bleak and empty view of life. He lived in a state of apathy, seeing the new room and bed he was given as no better than the cold cement slabs in the cellar. Every being he came into contact with saw him as dirty; unclean. But Homura also had his chance at rebirth. This was through a woman named Rinrei. For the first time, Homura felt he had a purpose in life, through this goddess he quickly grew to love.\n\nBecause he was a heresy, loving a heavenly being was seen as low and immoral. As punishment, Rinrei was reincarnated, and she died as a human. Homura carried the guilt of loving her for the rest of his life. His punishment, in turn, was to later take on the role of War Prince. (The anime actually screws up on this detail, giving us two scenes that contradict each other. One tells the viewer that Homura lost Rinrei before he \"met\" Goku in Heaven's flower field in episode 40 and 41. The other, episode 35, gives one the impression that Homura was told of Rinrei's punishment and given the title War Prince long after he would have met Goku, after Goku was locked away in the cave. The easiest way would be to go with what episodes 40 and 41 tell you, given that Homura was supposed to know of Goku and Konzen. Episode 35 gives you the idea that he never did.)\n\nHowever, meeting Goku in the heavens was the beginning of another rebirth for him. It was after that Homura decided he would find another purpose in life-- by creating a new world, and using the power of the strongest creature in the world: Seiten Taisei Son Goku.\n\nWhy?\n\n\"If you're going to kill me, then just kill me!\" - Goku\n\nUpon reading Homura's back-story, some may think, \"Well, then it seems he can only be with Rinrei.\" It is true that he clings to her memory-- to the point it is unhealthy, really. And nobody can deny that, no matter who he ends up with, Rinrei will somehow play a part.\n\nBut one thing that I love about this pairing is that Goku does not, in any way, remind Homura of his first beloved.\n\nFirst off, these two have something to stabilize their relationship: respect. Homura has a deep respect for Goku's strength, for his unique qualities and power. Goku, in turn, also recognizes and respects Homura's strength and powers. Both regard each other as worthy adversaries, someone to fight without needing to pull any punches-- and at the same time, someone neither have dared to best through cheap tricks. First and foremost, they are warriors; they realize and acknowledge this.\n\nIt's hardly difficult to build off this connection now. Goku doesn't know it, due to his amnesia, but he and Homura have shared similar pains. Both have lost a deeply loved and revered one to death and reincarnation. They also have faced and dealt with the scorn of the heavens simply because of their heretical bloodlines. Both have been abused and mistreated-- and both have come out stronger in the end. Homura has found a purpose and drive, a life again, and Goku is the most emotionally and mentally stable of the hellions he travels with.\n\nThroughout the entire series we see tension between them. Homura wants to fight Goku for reasons that are, to Goku, obscure and confusing. But the reasons don't matter too much to him-- he just eagerly looks forward to the next fight. In episode 34, when Homura says the gods are merely there to watch the Sanzo party's progress, it's Goku who initiates the fight. Ten episodes later, when Homura claims he is finally ready to take the Sanzo party seriously, Goku can't sleep that night. All he can think about is how badly he wants to defeat Homura. He knows he can, and he wants to badly.\n\nDuring this time, Homura is waiting on the cliff they all promised to meet, watching over the inn. He says nothing, but right after Goku's commentary, it's easy to see he is having somewhat similar thoughts. Both are eager for the fight to begin.\n\nBut this is rivalry, not hatred.\n\nFor example, there is episode 39, in which Sanzo and Goku have a verbal spat and Goku ends up running out on his own. Homura finds him in a bad mood and they -- of course -- end up fighting. In the end, Homura dislocates Goku's shoulder, renders him unconscious, and brings him back to (supposedly) Konran Tower. When Goku wakes, he finds himself chained with both wrists spread across the wall, injured and immobile, but intact. In short, Homura could easily do whatever he wants to him.\n\nWhat Homura does is relocate the boy's shoulder, attempt to feed him, and promise to protect him. The turn of events stuns Goku, but Homura is earnest in his offer in a way only he can be. Homura points out all the negative qualities of Goku and Sanzo's relationship, eventually reaching the point that, though Goku cares for Sanzo a lot, his feelings may not be returned in kind. Everything he says is valid. All he wants is to be Goku's sun.\n\nWhen Goku falters, it's a huge sign. Sanzo is the most important person in the world to him. To see Goku almost agree, even if it's only \"almost,\" it's still a huge thing. Never before has he ever considered leaving or betraying Sanzo. Despite his adversary relationship with Homura, they also have formed a meaningful trust-- enough for Goku to nearly agree. Had Sanzo not reassured him in the manner he had, Goku would have left.\n\nSo we have a working foundation, and meaningful connections. They respect each other, have past ties, and are both motivated by selfishness to protect the ones they care about most.\n\nAll that stands in the way is rivalry, and even that is hardly anything to stop them. To prove this, all one has to do is watch the final Gensomaden episode.\n\nYes, Homura dies.\n\nHowever, what I want everyone to notice is Goku's reaction to his death. It's something that stuns him; one moment Homura is beating his face into the ground, the next Goku is stubbornly fighting back; suddenly Homura jumps completely over him and goes right for Sanzo in what seems to be a cheap shot. Panicking, Goku impales Homura with his weapon-- and a split second before the attack is finished to completion, Homura looks over his shoulder and smirks.\n\nIn this simple action, Goku realizes Homura's intent had been suicide. It angers him, and all he wants to know is why Homura would do such a stupid thing, why he would cheat and let Goku win like that. Homura shakes his head, insisting Goku won fair and square. When he finally breathes his last, Goku starts wildly punching the ground, screaming curses and crying.\n\nNot something you'd normally see someone do over a mere rival, is it?\n\nDenouement\n\n\"All you have to do is come to me.\" - Homura\n\nWhen one thinks about it, it seems as though Homura/Goku as a little of something for everyone. You have two very flexible characters, who welcome changes and meet them head on. At the same time, they rely on some predictability. You have rivalry, but also a calming sense of respect from both sides. You have tension, empathy, immaturity, maturity, secrets, and even sexual appeal.\n\nLiking Homura/Goku was not an immediate thing for me. In fact, it took quite some time for me to even like Homura, let alone the pairing. However, this was largely due to the influence of the rapist!Homura fanfiction, something that has yet to die out, though it has dwindled considerably. No fanfiction convinced me; nobody else's opinion swayed my own. Simply watching the events of Saiyuki unfold, I could pick out these hints on my own. Liking the pairing was almost a chance happening, such as me finding the series had also been a \"chance happening.\" By the time you reach episode 39, you have hints practically jumping off the screen at you. Sure, there are stronger pairing hints and ideas for both characters, but that doesn't make this one any less plausible.\n\nNot to mention, you have over five hundred years to work in story ideas. How many pairing 'shippers can say that?\n\nFanfiction Recommendations\n\nAs I said before, the Homura/Goku pairing is both rarely written and grossly misrepresented in fanfiction. Showing off fanart would be a much easier fare. Due to the lack of fanfiction (and because I'm one of the only people who write for this pairing), I had to ask some friends to help me decide what few stories portrayed them well.\n\nPrisoners of Fate by SW :: A warning right off; the grammar and sentence structure could use a makeover. There are few paragraphs, and hardly anything speaking of them as a couple, save for the last bit. However, it's quite possibly the first Homura/Goku story-- and barring the last thing Homura says, the characterization is done well. I still recommend it.\n\nThe Note by KawaiiLilMarron :: Shortest fic for the pairing, a drabble that isn't even quite 500 words. Still, while it lacks description, the concept is nice, and prods a little at Goku's feelings for both his savior and the man wanting to be his sun. The last line in particular rings true for a possible ending, and how it should end.\n\nPerfect World by D-chan :: One of my own stories, and easily the longest Homura/Goku fanfic there. The tale is unfinished as of now, but the basic plot is a slight tweak in the original story: what if Homura had rescued Goku instead of Sanzo? Out of the four people I asked, all agreed this was my best representation of the pairing.\n\nNew Rebirth by chibiryu :: A stunning, beautifully written alternate-universe tale of how things may have ended up at the end of the series. The prose is exquisite, giving accurate and vivid descriptions. On top of that, the emotions are played out well, with anguish, bitterness, helplessness, a faint glow of hope, and a spark of disappointment. (Warning: also contains various forms of Sanzo/Goku.)\n\nJustification by Timberwolf220 :: Major spoilers for the end of the series, but it's wonderfully done. This time it's from Goku's point of view, giving us insight on to how he may have felt during the last few minutes of the series. Absolutely wonderful, especially in the manner in which his maturity is portrayed.\n\nPersonification by Iapetus :: Lovely, gorgeous imagery story. A look at the relationship from Homura's point of view, giving us brief glimpses of moments they share within one night. Rated for lime content, but extremely tasteful. Being a Homura-POV story, it's hardly free of angst, but it touches on a powerful note and gives one the sense that Homura is being redeemed through this relationship. If you're looking for a story that expresses this pairing through the characters, then this is my #1 recommendation.\n\nGroups\n\nheretic_love\n\nHomura/Goku Yahoo! fanlisting"
