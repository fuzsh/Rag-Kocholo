        "text": "Iwadare can only be called \"over-rated\" when considering his full career. If you narrow in on Lunar 1+2 and Grandia 1+2, and perhaps the Langrisser work he did, he's definitely something special. Sadly, his quality of composition has gone downhill in recent years. The same can be said of many composers, ESPECIALLY Mitsuda.\n\nBut looking for someone who is just downright over-rated ... yeah, I want to say Sakuraba. But then, a lot of critics are beginning to turn on him, so that may be unfair.\n\nAs for Sakimoto? I still think he's awesome, so ... no, not over-rated.\n\nI can't think of any composers I'd TRULY consider \"over-rated.\" Not a one.\n\nPersonally I think Sakimoto tends to be underrated by a lot of people, but that's just me. As far as overrated goes, I'll go with.. drum roll please.. Falcom Sound Team jdk. Yeah that's right, I said it, who wants to fight? Some of their stuff is alright but the way people praise them like they're gods always makes me scratch my head. #2 would definitely go to Motoi Sakuraba. Again, some of his stuff is decent but most of it bores the pants off me. The only things I ever liked of his were the first Valkyrie Profile and I thought he was pretty impressive in his live concert. Other than that, snooze fest.\n\nZane wrote:\n\nthis thread could get pretty hot pretty quickly.\n\nYOUR MOM IS OVERRATED AND CLOUD COULD KICK SQUALL'S AZZ ANY DAY!!!!!!111\n\n-Mike\n\nI'll draft: Sakimoto, Yamane, Mitsuda, Yamaoka\n\nIf anyone actually cares for elaboration, please say so, otherwise I'll leave it at that. But those are four I've listened to extensively and don't really see/hear the big deal. Although it must be said I have a lot more respect for the last two than I do the first two.\n\nTempted to say Shimomura, Hamauzu and Nakano, as all have just grown off me completely over the years.\n\nI'll second Iwadare as well...Much of his Grandia 1 and 2 stuff was excellent, but as far as a career goes...I have doubts with everything else of his I hear. And Sakuraba got by on the strength of a couple scores for way too long before I stopped seeing what the big deal was.\n\n*waits for someone to say Uematsu*\n\nEdit: Okay, since two people mentioned JDK, I need to muster some sort of defense. I think for what they set out to do, they accomplish it very well. Their music (original or arranged) always seems to embrace more of an old-school feel and isn't shy that it's out to provide more of an anthemic backdrop to the action, that is ripe for being arranged. I think there's a bit of honesty in there in trying to make deliberately fun compositions, whereas a lot of groups try to make their music sound more important than it really is. I find it pretty refreshing, especially compared to the empty orchestral pomp and atmospheric crap of so many games today. I find soundtracks like Sorcerian and Ys tend to be pretty accurate and quality examples of what people think of about VGM in the late 80's/early 90's (and yes, I mean that in a good way)...They're right up there with Rockman for me. And arranged better to boot.\n\nThe problem with saying \"JDK\" is you're talking about an entire sound team that has various members (including Yonemitsu, who may or may not have been a member) and different eras. Now the CURRENT JDK, I'm becoming far less fond of and I don't really think they have the charm that the older one did (which was deeply rooted in 80's synthpop/hard rock).\n\nZane wrote:\n\nI have your back on that one, man. I'll never forget hearing about how \"great\" the Ys IV Perfect Collections were and then once I heard them I was like... wait. THIS is what everyone has been fapping off about? Granted, some of the stuff from Ys I and II (Duo redbook) were cool, but that's just because it sounded like a cheap, synthy Iron Maiden ripoff. All set with that.\n\nFap, fap, fap...Still fapping after all these years. Only minor issue I've had with them is the recording quality tends to cover up sound layers at times, but that's fixable.\n\nAnd the Duo redbook didn't have \"Protectors\" on it (which WAS an Iron Maiden ripoff...listen to \"Flash of the Blade\" on Powerslave). I think Yuzo meant that as a joke...\n\nAs for Uematsu...I don't think HE is overrated, but past FFVI, I think he ventures into overrated territory just a wee bit. Nothing unusual though (sort of like how a band maintains popularity long after their best releases *cough* Metallica), but I'm hard pressed to say anything has touched his 1994 masterpiece and general SNES-era output. I do find it ironic how little attention Blue Dragon/Lost Odyssey have gotten though, probably since they aren't FF-related.\n\nNemo wrote:\n\nWhat composers make you fail to understand how they can receive such high praise? For me it's always been Hitoshi Sakimoto. People always like his scores are so incredible, but everytime I listen to one I'm bored to tears. I can't find anything special or redeeming about his compositions, and they all feel completely generic to me. He seriously has to be the most overrated composer in the history of vgm.\n\nCopy and paste this for me. Give me the Final Fantasy Tactics soundtrack and I'm done.\n\nOthers: Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano (though somewhat less then Sakimoto)\n\nYes, I realize those are all (or were) SE composers...\n\nAs for Sakuraba I've only heard his SO output so I can't really say I've ODed om him.\n\nI also think Noriyasu Agematsu from the WA series is given too much credit... I'll admit (he/she) has managed to take the reigns of the series but I still perfer to sit it out when it comes to the soundtracks. The battle tracks on Wild Arms XF were different enough to catch my ear, but Agematsu's additions were the weakest in my opinion. This isn't a \"Naruke wasn't there\" cry either... I didn't care for her style after the series went to the PS2 with WA3.\n\nSakimoto and Hamauzu for me. Sakimoto is very good at what he does, but I don't find most of his stuff very memorable (though I will grant that his stuff might be better when accompanied by the actual games - I like the FFXII score a lot because I remember it from playing the game). Hamauzu has a few really good tracks that I like a lot, but overall I'm not a big fan of his work. I remember when hearing the FFX soundtrack for the first time a buddy and I were trying to figure out which tracks Uematsu did and which he didn't - \"[Hamauzu's] random hammering\" became our name for a lot of his entries. :\\\n\nAlso I'll say again that almost everyone on Nintendo's current sound staff is overrated... by Nintendo themselves. Get Kondo back writing music and move Yokota onto as many projects as possible, because I'm really disappointed by so, so much of what comes out of the rest of them.\n\nAs Conn said, it comes down to personal preference. I'm not sure I would call any video game composer overrated (it's such a specialized area, and let's face it there isn't a plethora of video game composer out there). On the other hand video game series (Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy, Final Fantas...) yes, some of those are definitely overrated. I tend to find myself enjoying various albums, and I don't particularly pay special homage to any one composer.\n\nOn a side note, I didn't really know Soule had \"haters\". Obviously there are people who don't care for his style, but that's true for every composer that has ever lived. So, I want detail... where does this notion of \"haters\" come from? Give me references! Personally, I think Soule is underrated.\n\nBaldur's Gate: Dark Alliance (never released, damn that one needed a soundtrack!)\n\nDungeon Siege\n\nThe Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind\n\nES IV: Oblivion\n\nIcewind Dale\n\nNeverwinter Nights\n\nSecret of Evermore\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\n\nthose are all awesome works! Unfortunately many US games never see an official release. More and more are seeing official releases, which is a good thing, hope the trend continues (so support Western video game composers you bums\n\ncheers,\n\n-avatar!\n\nMcCall wrote:\n\nEh. I think this thread is really just personal preference, like most 'best/worst' threads. What works for some people obviously won't for someone else. Typically, it's not that they are bad, you just don't like them.\n\nFor the most part as it seems like most people are kind of pointing out composers that don't live up to godly expectations, but as far as Sakimoto with me, it's kind of like with all the great composers that actually have talent and go unnoticed, how does this guy get so much credit when he's as generic as they come. It's probably just because he worked on some Square games.\n\nAnyways, Iwadare is another good call, outside of Lunar EB, his work is completely forgettable. I can't, however, understand how some one can't respect Soundteam JDK, these guys invented vgm and seldom lost a beat well over 2 decades. Best vgm composition team in history, hands down.\n\nZane wrote:\n\nEDIT: Just saw Chris's post. Put Yamane way up there on my list\n\nWait, there are people that actually rate her highly???\n\nGoldfishX wrote:\n\n*waits for someone to say Uematsu*\n\nUematsu hasn't been very good in a very long time, but there has been some brilliant moments in the FF scores, especially the 1st one, so it's hard to hate. Especially since he's a pioneer. Same goes with Sakuraba, I can see people finding his stuff bland since he's done so much for so long, but I still love his work for the most part and it still has a distinct personality.\n\nGoldfishX wrote:\n\n*waits for someone to say Uematsu*\n\nThis prompted me to think: *waits for someone to say Koshiro*. Yuzo Koshiro is a guy that sure seems loved by most VGM fans, or at least not seen as very overrated. I'm certainly not gonna be to one to say it (I love the guy!), but I'm curious... Is there any one here that would call him overrated?\n\nAlso, Nemo: JDK did not invent VGM, and, yes, there are people who like Yamane quite a bit. I think her output is very uneven and that she should be removed from the Castlevania series promptly (too many screw-ups), but I'll gladly admit that some of her stuff (like CV: Bloodlines and Symphony of the Night) is great.\n\nNemo wrote:\n\nMcCall wrote:\n\nEh.

It's probably just because he worked on some Square games.\n\nI think he is by far the most unique vgm composer, and it's not even the \"orchestral\" sound that makes it so, it's the composition itself.\n\nHe can do a track entirely on electronics/guitar/banjo/whatever and his original compositional ideas are still in your face.\n\nAnd no... I first played Vagrant Story as a completely noobie 11 year old when it came out and the awesome music stood out and had a lasting impression to me even then, despite not knowing who the hell composed it.\n\nWhen Sakimoto was announced as the FFXII composer and I researched who it was, I knew it was great news.\n\nOT: Sakuraba.... I own Star Ocean 3 and much like the game itself the music does absolutely nothing for me.\n\nSO2 is probably better though.\n\nI think Koshiro's Maximum Tune scores are overrated and I was never the hugest Streets of Rage fan (but it's still good!), but everything else from him is gold and worthy of mention. I personally like his philosophy as it relates to older sound systems (that they're their \"own\" instrument as opposed to trying to sound like live instruments). I think it's refreshing, when you have a host of composers that I feel like to hide behind live sounds. It seems to have carried over somewhat, as it seems chip music is gaining respect in some circles.\n\nI can honestly say even Yamane's acclaimed scores, I've never seen much in. SOTN never came close to touching CV3, but it worked for what it was...I didn't start to dislike her until the nuclear disaster that was Suikoden III and the follow-up nuke that was Lament of Innocence. Curse of Darkness made sort of an impression, but more in the sense of \"good...for Yamane\". Which didn't mean much in the big picture, ultimately. Unfortunately, she's Iga's go-to lady, so I doubt she'll be leaving the series anytime soon.\n\nVery similar to Sakimoto...I think I stuck with him way longer than I should have because I was finding tracks that were simply \"good...for Sakimoto\"."
