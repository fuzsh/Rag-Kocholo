        "text": "Motoi Sakuraba is a true legend for RPG fans. His ability to compose quality soundtracks for countless games has made him one of the most acclaimed composers in the world of videogames. Franchises such as Tales Of, Star Ocean, Golden Sun or Dark Souls have his stamp of guaranteed quality. With all the joy in the world, we present what we believe to be the first interview in Spanish with this authentic artist to whom we owe so many good moments. Let’s begin!\n\nRPG Spain: We want to start with a question we’ve always wanted to ask you. It’s amazing how many games (many RPGs, with the extensive soundtracks they tend to have) you’ve worked on. How have you been able to manage your time for so many games?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: In my case, for some reason, I often find myself juggling multiple projects at the same time, with each day dedicated to composing music for a different game title. I typically create about two songs per day, alternating between different game titles. For example, I might work on songs for Game Title A one day and then switch to Game Title B the next day, and so on. I try to avoid working on two different game titles within the same day because it can be challenging to stay focused on each game’s unique world and atmosphere. Additionally, even as the number of game titles increases, I continue with this pattern. When I have more flexibility with deadlines, I adjust the schedule to every 3 or 4 days instead of daily.\n\nRPG Spain: And yet, you find time to work on solo projects or with your band. Can you tell us more about these projects?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: Regarding my band activities, I have two projects: one involves performing game music, and the other focuses on playing songs from my solo work. Currently, the lineup for the game music project consists of five members, including guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, and violin. The lineup for my solo project is a trio, featuring bass, drums, and keyboard. It’s possible that the lineup may change in the future. My solo project tends to lean towards a strong progressive rock style. In band activities, the emphasis is on performance, with a focus on improvisation and allowing each instrument to express itself freely. Apart from the band, my solo projects, such as piano solos or songs performed solely on the keyboard, also incorporate elements of improvisation and experimentation. In my solo work, I prioritize creating and performing music that resonates with me and feels musically satisfying. In the game music project, our goal is to perform the music more aggressively than how it’s presented in the games themselves. For both solo and band projects, I consciously strive for a human touch, valuing imperfections and fluctuations in the music to achieve a more authentic and relatable musical outcome.\n\nRPG Spain: Have the videogames you have worked on inspired you for these personal projects?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: I’m not consciously thinking about the relationship between my game music and solo project songs. Since they are both created by the same person, there might be similarities in the style or an impression that they draw inspiration from each other naturally. I personally wasn’t originally well-versed in game music, and my roots are more in band activities. It’s possible that, conversely, my band activities and solo projects are influencing the game music I create, even if I’m not consciously trying to do so.\n\nRPG Spain: How does a person with so much work deal with blockages? Have you ever felt that pressure when inspiration doesn’t come?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: Fortunately, I haven’t experienced any slumps or creative blocks so far. I haven’t felt pressured due to a lack of inspiration either. However, I have found myself redoing songs multiple times because I couldn’t grasp the producer’s intent or facing time constraints as my computer struggled to keep up with my work. These factors have occasionally caused me to feel rushed when deadlines are approaching.\n\nRPG Spain: In each game franchise you have worked on, you manage to create a unique and differential style that is related to its world. What style do you think each of your albums has?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: I haven’t consciously focused on a particular style, but the time period and my age when working on a piece might have some influence. Additionally, I’ve been self-taught in playing instruments and composing methods, so I believe that has contributed to the uniqueness of my work.\n\nRPG Spain: I have recently played the demo of Star Ocean 2 and it is incredible the feeling of space travel that you get with every game of this saga. How do you usually work on these games and what differences would there be with another franchise that has so many similarities with it: Tales of?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: Star Ocean is set in a grand space-themed narrative, allowing me to create music with a sense of grandeur that I particularly love. I’ve always been a fan of science fiction movies and similar genres, so it’s possible that those influences naturally find their way into my work. Tales of series and other similar franchises have distinct differences in their scenarios and worldviews, which naturally result in different musical compositions. Additionally, some past Tales of games have had multiple composers, making it challenging to unify the musical style under one consistent vision. In contrast, with Star Ocean, I am the sole composer, which allows me to showcase my own creative color.\n\nRPG Spain: We are also celebrating the re-release of a classic RPG that we love: Baten Kaitos. What do you think about this re-release? Any anecdotes that you remember in the creation of its soundtrack?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: I’m also extremely excited about the re-release! This game features unique graphics and a distinct world, making it exceptionally individualistic in my opinion. I’ve had the pleasure of working alongside the sound director for many years, and our close working relationship has made composing a joyful experience. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for the release of Baten Kaitos 3! This sound director and I have also collaborated on Tales of Arise. In Baten Kaitos 2, there’s a song where my daughter, who was quite young at the time, sings in Italian. Listening to it now, I’m impressed by how well she sang. For the boss music, I even had my daughter’s singing teacher perform.\n\nRPG Spain: One of our favourites games ever is Golden Sun so we have to ask this one! What indications did you get when you started working on this franchise?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: The president of the company that developed «Golden Sun» was a big fan of progressive rock and was familiar with my work, so he allowed me a lot of creative freedom. Of course, there were guidelines for different scenes, such as dark or melodic themes, but in terms of musical style, I had a lot of creative autonomy. The music indeed had a strong progressive rock influence, as it was requested by the company president. One particular theme or aspect that was crucial for the soundtrack of this game was the limited number of sounds available due to the gaming platform’s constraints. The challenge was to make each track sound rich and engaging with a minimal number of musical elements.\n\nRPG Spain: How would you say your style has changed or evolved from «Baroque in the Future», with your first band «Deja Vu», to the present day?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: During the days when I was in bands like Déjà vu, I had virtually no knowledge of orchestral instruments and didn’t consider using them at all. My focus was primarily on keyboard instruments like synthesizers. When composing music during that time, I think I approached it more as a performer rather than a composer. While I can’t claim to have completely self-taught myself with the correct knowledge, as I continued to work in game music, I gradually learned to incorporate orchestral elements like string sections, brass ensembles, and percussion. In terms of composition, I’ve learned to switch between a composer’s mindset and a performer’s mindset depending on the needs of the music, and sometimes even use both simultaneously. I believe that my ability to create music has expanded in terms of styles, genres, and versatility compared to the days of Déjà vu.\n\nRPG Spain: Although I like every piece of your music I’ve heard, I love «Force of Light», with songs like «Sanctity» that transmit me a lot, at what point in your life did you come to compose this album?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: Thank you so much for enjoying my music! I’m really thrilled to hear that. During that time, I was part of a two-member band, playing drums and keyboards, and we performed in live music venues. I didn’t have as many game music projects as I do now, so I was also involved in solo work and worked on various projects outside of gaming, such as anime and TV dramas. Additionally, in my game music work, I was responsible for creating sound effects and designing sounds for use in games, among other tasks.\n\nRPG Spain: «The way» for example in «What’s Up?». What a song! Thank you for your\n\nmusic Mr. Sakuraba! I hope our Spanish readers listen to them just after reading this!\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: I´m very grateful as well! Thank you for listening to my music. I hope that people in Spain will also have the opportunity to listen to it!\n\nRPG Spain: Do you have any new albums planned in the near future?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: I’m currently working on songs for my next solo album, with the goal of completing it in the near future. There might also be the possibility of releasing game-related soundtracks in the upcoming projects.\n\nRPG Spain: Let’s play a little game, tell us which of your soundtracks do you recommend to our readers according to their favourite RPG. For example:\n\nGolden Sun\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: Golden Sun is indeed quite impressive, and I agree that the first installment left a lasting impression. It’s definitely worth recommending.\n\nDark Souls\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: Regarding «Dark Souls,» the first game, where my music played a more central role, is a standout compared to the sequels, which featured less of my music.\n\nTales Of\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: In the «Tales of» series, I’ll say «Tales of Arise,» which is the latest installment, and it’s a remarkable work with a strong emphasis on music. It features full orchestral recordings in a concert hall and studio recordings for strings and the band.\n\nValkyrie\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: «Valkyrie Profile» is another series with notable differences between its installments. The first game offers a wide variety of music and many excellent tracks, including those with a rock band style. The second installment, «Silmeria,» has a broader range of orchestral-style music. The latest entry, «Elysium,» has a distinct, darker atmosphere compared to the previous games. Even within the same «Valkyrie» series, the different styles in these three titles make for an interesting comparison, and I hope you’ll enjoy listening to them.\n\nStar Ocean\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: Regarding «Star Ocean,» while the second story is popular, I’d also recommend checking out «Star Ocean 6: The Divine Force,» which was recently released. Additionally, the upcoming remake of Second Story is highly anticipated.\n\nBaten Kaitos\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: Baten Kaitos offers accessible and enjoyable music in both the first and second games, making them both worth exploring.\n\nRPG Spain: Finally, you have said in other interviews that you don’t listen to much music lately, but have you listened to Spanish music? Any Spanish artists or composers you know? Would you like to come to Spain to give a concert?\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: I am a keyboard player, but I absolutely love Spanish guitar. It’s music that’s passionate, lyrical, and beautifully expressive. Sometimes, when I play the piano or organ, I like to incorporate phrases that evoke the same feeling. I’m also a fan of Paco de Lucía and had the chance to attend his concert when he visited Japan. I used to listen to performances where Paco de Lucía, John McLaughlin, and Al Di Meola collaborated when I was younger. I’ve recently found some spare time, so I’m thinking of revisiting their music. If the opportunity arises, I’d love to perform in Spain! Whether it’s in a band format or a solo piano performance, I’d like to have a concert!\n\nRPG Spain: Thank you one more time, I really appreciate your time and I hope one day we can see each other in Spain! As RPG fans, you’re a composer that we admire and we really wanted to talk to you someday.\n\nMotoi Sakuraba: You’re very welcome! I look forward to the day we can speak directly, and I hope to visit Spain someday. I have a strong desire to perform there in any way possible."
