        "text": "I think for many Gen Xers and some millennials who actively played video games, Yuzo Koshiro might be perhaps the first video game composer they've ever heard of.\n\nMany people back in the day didn't beat games because of their obscene difficulty and the fledgling nature of the medium rendering the audience's collective skill floor pretty low, effectively making it rare back in the day for people to see the ending of games and the credits. Making matters worse, the amount of people who worked on games that would see credit in them was also never a guarantee; lots of games didn't feature easily accessible credits and in some cases they'd erase the efforts of those working on games by enforcing aliases (Capcom was notorious for that). Meanwhile, three games in Sega's seminal Streets of Rage series, and others like Revenge of Shinobi -- all of which are commonly cited as some of the Genesis' biggest killer apps -- feature Yuzo Koshiro's name front and center on the literal title screen. People still revere the soundtrack work from those games and they always remind you who was responsible for them when you play.\n\nAnd the only reason it happened was because Koshiro's mom told him to ask Sega to do that, and Sega basically went \"sure why not\" when asked.\n\nYeah, while I was aware of some Western computer game composers, I think Yuzo Koshiro was the first Japanese one where I knew his name because it was on a title screen, for Revenge of Shinobi. The 8-bit console era was full of pseudonyms like Bo (Tokuhiko Uwabo) and Konchan (Koji Kondo). I guess there was also Hip Tanaka but that heads more into nickname territory.\n\nWhat kinda trips me up seeing these responses about Shimomura is like, as phenomenal as her music is and as much as she's done, I never heard anyone talk about her until recently. Whereas with Mitsuda I've been hearing musicians, media, and game fans talk about him by name since I was in high school. I didn't hear Shimomura's name until a friend of mine mentioned her work in FFXV. I didn't hear about Kirkhope until Famiboards. Some other names mentioned here I've never heard at all (even though I've heard their music).\n\nI'm not saying that I'm an expert in this stuff by any means and I'm definitely not trying to come across like \"if I haven't heard of them then they aren't famous\" but if we're talking fame as in whose name is known (like who knows the name Martin O'Donnell and not just how many know \"the Halo theme\" for example), then Kondo, Uematsu, and Mitsuda are the only three names I've consistently heard others mention since the 90s.\n\nLots of good picks here. It's interesting to see a debate emerge over what makes something iconic. Work on a single massively popular work? Incredibly strong appeal in a specific part of the world versus a more general appeal worldwide? My heart says Yoko Shimomura for the range, but there are many compelling arguments.\n\nWhat kinda trips me up seeing these responses about Shimomura is like, as phenomenal as her music is and as much as she's done, I never heard anyone talk about her until recently.

Mario and Zelda started in the 80s. So did Final Fantasy, which had its incredible SNES and PS1 run in the 90s. The two Chrono games, those were 90s games too. In particular, while Kondo and Uematsu are still in the composing game, the 2000's marked the time of them stepping away from handling full OSTs in favor of the new guard. Meanwhile, while Shimomura was doing some incredible work in the 90s (SFII, Mario RPG, various Square RPGs), her most iconic works (Kingdom Hearts) are products of the 2000's and beyond. So you have a different generation of players who embraced her music. I'm one of them - I spent ages listening to KH and Mario & Luigi music long before I heard a single Chrono Trigger track (thanks, DS version!).\n\nI think you can make an argument that Kondo, Uematsu, and Mitsuda all had their most iconic work done by the 90s.

I guess what I was getting at was like, were you hearing people talk about her? Were you hearing people mentioning the name? Was she famous or was her music famous?\n\nBecause again, I think Halo is a great example of how tons of people know the music and could chant the theme by heart but I doubt many of them have ever heard the name Martin O'Donnell.\n\nAnd I wanna be clear that I'm not trying to diminish these people or their work at all, I'm just surprised as far as name recognition how different other people's experience seems to be from mine.\n\nWith 0 doubt it's yoko shimomura, the amount of iconic music she composed in the span of her career together with some of the most important videogame soundtracks ever made put's her almost in the same league as kondo and uematsu\n\nWhat kinda trips me up seeing these responses about Shimomura is like, as phenomenal as her music is and as much as she's done, I never heard anyone talk about her until recently.

So literally her biggest and most influential work went uncredited.\n\nThat's probably why she wasn't a more prominent name until later in her career.\n\nWhat kinda trips me up seeing these responses about Shimomura is like, as phenomenal as her music is and as much as she's done, I never heard anyone talk about her until recently.

I imagine her cultural cache has only increased since then. She's still in the game with new works, and remakes with her music see her involvement (from the KH HD Remixes to Live A Live to the many Mario RPGs that she worked on).\n\nEDIT: I also think her working on other, earlier games became more well-known in the 2010s. It took until Ryu came to Smash for talk of her doing the SFII OST was more widespread, least it was for me.\n\nI'd argue that Koji Kondo and Nobuo Uematsu aren't the most famous composers. Their work is probably some of the most famous in the industry, and maybe that's what you mean and I misinterpreted the question, but the people themselves aren't really all that \"famous\".\n\nThe top three most famous composers in the industry right now are probably ConcernedApe, Toby Fox, and C418. Two extremely successful solo productions and the best selling game of all time. That's not to say these are better than Koji or Nobuo, just that these three have way more eyes on them.\n\nTo be clear, I am talking specifically name recognition over how famous or good their music is. That's a totally different conversation.\n\nI can kind of see the other two, but this is actually the first I've seen anyone even mention ConcernedApe doing music, so that he's a composer at all is news to me!\n\nHaven't seen Motoi Sakuraba mentioned yet, he's gotta be up there.\n\nHe slipped my mind because I'm not a fan, but I'm also surprised it took this long for him to come up. Every other one of the \"group\" of big freelance composers who I know mainly as the regular contributors on Sakurai's games has already been mentioned, apart from Michiko Naruke, who is definitely a bit more obscure than the others.\n\nAlso a bit surprised no one has mentioned Michiru Yamane. Or famous Twitter user Hideki Naganuma, who also did some video game music or something.\n\nIn terms of sheer name recognition I think Toby Fox has a very compelling argument. Thereâ€™s a reason that one of the first things Game Freak announced about Little Town Hero was that Toby Fox did the music for it, and why The Pokemon Company made sure to mention his contributions to the newest Pokemon entries prior to launch (that little tidbit of info made multiple news headlines).\n\nThereâ€™s also the fact that his name is very prominently tied to Undertale, his most famous work. Yes, more people have probably played a game that someone like Yoko Shimomura or David Wise composed, but a majority of them probably wouldnâ€™t recognize their names. Undertale, particularly its OST, has had such a significant presence on the internet, and if youâ€™ve ever interacted with the global fanbase the game has, then youâ€™ve probably heard the name Toby Fox.\n\nTo be clear, I am talking specifically name recognition over how famous or good their music is.

He's totally one of the most well known composers in the industry at this point, especially since his game is such a massive hit with the adult casual gamer.\n\nYu peng chen tbh, that audience is much larger than jrpgâ€™s that max out at 5mil\n\nAfter he quit Genshin there was a phase when players discovered there were other composers than him he was so ingrained as the sole music compsoer in the community.\n\nI canâ€™t think of anyone else other than counting imagine dragons for leaugue of legends.\n\nBecause a lot of game companies donâ€™t put out their composer. On the other hand genshins shivers their compete into everything as possible, letâ€™s not forget their worldwide concert sold out in 5 minutes\n\nOh shit I forgot about Toby fox, heâ€™s probably more popular than nobue uematsus tbh\n\nafter that porabaly matsuda.\n\ncomposers for jrpgs other than uematsu are not in the running, not enough play them an d its peak echo chamber nonsense, nobody outside the jrpg community cares about who falcom has composing or what yoko shimomuras next project is.\n\nI would also like to mention leagues composers who could be in the running if riot actually promoted them.\n\nif there's on jrpg though that's big ost wise its gotta be persona, in which case I would say lyn is the face of the music. but that doenst really count ig\n\nthis would is averaging out game popularity and promotion, if the companies dont promote their artists no one will know who they are and even if they promote them to hell and back if their game only sold 3mil that isnt going to make its way into the gaming zeitgeist.\n\nthey need both going for them, popularity and promotion\n\nanyway im gonna send this causes its good\n\nthe best song is at 59:15\n\nlena raine and c14 or whatever his name was have minecraft and got a lot of coverage when lena started making music for it."
