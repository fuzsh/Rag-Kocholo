        "text": "Japanese composer and keyboardist (born 1965)\n\nMotoi Sakuraba (桜庭 統, Sakuraba Motoi, born August 5, 1965) is a Japanese composer and keyboardist. He is known for his numerous contributions in video games, including the Tales, Star Ocean, Mario Golf, Mario Tennis, Golden Sun, and Dark Souls series, as well as several other anime series, television dramas, and progressive rock albums.[1][2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nSakuraba was born on August 5, 1965, in Akita Prefecture, Japan.[3] While attending Meiji University, Sakuraba began to take music composition seriously and formed the progressive rock band \"Clashed Ice\" in 1984, consisting of him on keyboards and Genta Kudo on drums and vocals.[4] After the duo had graduated the following year, they were noticed by music producer Shingo Ueno, and ending up signing with Made in Japan Records. The band had then added bassist Tetsuya Nagatsuma, and was renamed as \"Deja Vu\".[4][5] In 1988, the band would release their only studio album, Baroque in the Future, composed entirely by Sakuraba.[4] Although the band disbanded in 1989, Sakuraba would later go on to release a similar-sounding solo album, Gikyokuonsou, in 1991.\n\nIn late 1989, Sakuraba began working as a composer for Wolf Team, joining Masaaki Uno and Yasunori Shiono. The professional friendships formed here in Sakuraba's early years have resulted in a great demand for his composing and arranging abilities. In 1994, former Wolf Team director and composer Masaaki Uno started working at Camelot Software Planning as a coordinator and sound director, developing games for Sony, Sega and Nintendo. Sakuraba has been called upon as a composer for many Camelot games, including all of the games in the Mario Golf, Mario Tennis, and Golden Sun series.\n\nIn 1995, Wolf Team developed the breakthrough game Tales of Phantasia for Namco. This and other early games in the Tales series primarily featured Sakuraba and fellow Wolf Team co-worker Shinji Tamura as composers. Also in 1995, former Wolf Team director and producer Jun Asanuma, as well as Tales of Phantasia writer and programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda, founded tri-Ace with financial backing from Enix. The Star Ocean and Valkyrie Profile games have been their main franchises. Sakuraba has been the composer for nearly all of their games.\n\nIn 1999, long time Sakuraba sound designer and programmer Hiroya Hatsushiba, a former member of Wolf Team and tri-Ace, founded tri-Crescendo. While initially continuing to contribute sound work to tri-Ace games, tri-Crescendo began game development in 2001. Together with Monolith Soft, tri-Crescendo started working on Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean; Namco provided the financial backing. Hatsushiba, as director and main programmer of the project, again called upon Sakuraba's composing services. This has extended to the sequel, Baten Kaitos Origins, and Eternal Sonata. The remnants of Wolf Team later morphed into the Namco Telenet joint subsidiary Namco Tales Studio in 2003.\n\nIn 2007, Sakuraba was selected to join a long list of video game composers to arrange music for Super Smash Bros. Brawl. He chose to arrange the famous \"Menu Theme\" from the game's predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee. He also arranged \"Gourmet Race\" from Kirby Super Star, \"Jungle Level Ver.2\" from Donkey Kong Country, \"Mario Tennis / Mario Golf\" from Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour and Mario Power Tennis, \"Victory Road\" from Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, the \"Airship Theme\" from Super Mario Bros. 3, the \"Battlefield Theme\", \"Final Destination\", and \"Battle Scene / Final Boss (Golden Sun)\" from Golden Sun: The Lost Age.\n\nSakuraba then continued to write music for games in franchises he has worked with before, including Star Ocean: The Last Hope,[6] Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, Mario Tennis Open, Mario Golf: World Tour, and many Tales series games, including Hearts, Graces, Xillia, Xillia 2, Zestiria, and Berseria.[6] He has also contributed to other well known games such as the Dark Souls series, Kid Icarus: Uprising, and Phantasy Star Nova.[6][7] In 2014, he was selected to provide musical arrangements for Brawl's successor, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.[8] For this title, Sakuraba arranged \"Theme from Area 6 / Missile Slipstream\" from Star Fox 64 and Star Fox Command, \"Battle! (Team Flare)\" from Pokémon X and Y, and \"The valedictory elegy\" from Baten Kaitos Origins.\n\nIn addition, Sakuraba has continued to write for non-gaming and anime projects, including solo albums such as \"Forest of Glass\", \"What's Up?\", and \"Passage\", as well as performing on several arrange albums.[6] In the 2020s, he composed for games such as One Piece Odyssey and Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes.\n\nLive performances\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring July 2003, Sakuraba held a live concert in Tokyo, Japan. He performed progressive rock interpretations of his music from games Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, Star Ocean: The Second Story, Star Ocean: Blue Sphere and Valkyrie Profile. His bandmates for this concert were bassist Atsushi Hasegawa (a member of the band Gerard) and drummer Toshihiko Nakamura.[9] As noted, this concert was released on DVD and CD. At the same time as they were rehearsing for the concert, Hasegawa and Nakamura assisted in recording new material for the Director's Cut of Star Ocean: Till the End of Time.\n\nThe following year, the trio performed another concert. The venue was smaller, but included music from Baten Kaitos and a couple of new, non-game-related pieces. This concert was not officially recorded and released, however. However, in 2006, a new concert was given in celebration of tri-Ace's Valkyrie Profile: Silmeria.[10]\n\nIn September 2011, Sakuraba and his band joined up with the Earthbound Papas in Kawasaki, led by former Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu, to perform at Fantasy Rock Fest 2011. The event featured game music performances, along with new progressive rock pieces from both bands. The first six tracks that Sakuraba and his band played were sold at the event as a preview CD for his then-upcoming solo album After all..., which was released by Strange Days Records on October 19, 2011.\n\nIn June 2015, Sakuraba performed at the Tales of Festival at the Yokohama Arena, being the first time he performed tracks from the Tales series at a live event.[11] A selection of Sakuraba's music from the Dark Souls and Tales series was performed live at the Salle Pleyel concert hall in Paris in February 2017.[12] The event, known as \"Orchestral Memories\", featured a guest appearance by Sakuraba.[12] The 2020 Tales of Festival featured an original song by him called \"Endless Journey\", dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the series.[13]\n\nNotable works\n\n[edit]\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role(s) 1989 Arcus II: Silent Symphony Music with Masaaki Uno and Yasunori Shiono 1990 Granada Music with Masaaki Uno Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku Music Final Zone Music with Masaaki Uno Sol-Feace Music 1991 Arcus Odyssey Music El Viento Music Earnest Evans Music 1992 Sol-Deace Music Earnest Evans Music; Sega Genesis version 1993 Annet Futatabi Music 1994 Hiōden: Mamono-tachi tono Chikai Music with Hiroya Hatsushiba and Shinji Tamura Tenshi no Uta: Shiroki Tsubasa no Inori Music with Shinji Tamura 1995 Beyond the Beyond Music Tales of Phantasia Music with Shinji Tamura and Ryota Furuya 1996 Star Ocean Music Shining the Holy Ark Music 1997 Everybody's Golf Music Shining Force III Music Tales of Destiny Music with Shinji Tamura 1998 Star Ocean: The Second Story Music 1999 Mario Golf Music Mario Golf GB Music Valkyrie Profile Music 2000 Mario Tennis Music Mario Tennis GB Music Tales of Eternia Music with Shinji Tamura 2001 Mobile Golf Music Star Ocean: Blue Sphere Music Golden Sun Music 2002 Golden Sun: The Lost Age Music Tales of Destiny 2 Music with Shinji Tamura 2003 Star Ocean: Till the End of Time Music Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour Music Tales of Symphonia Music with Shinji Tamura and Takeshi Arai Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean Music 2004 Mario Golf: Advance Tour Music Mario Power Tennis Music Tales of Rebirth Music with Shinji Tamura 2005 Mario Tennis: Power Tour Music Tales of the Abyss Music with Shinji Tamura 2006 Baten Kaitos Origins Music Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth Music Tales of Eternia Online Music Valkyrie Profile 2: Silmeria Music Tales of the Tempest Music Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology Music with Takuya Yasuda and Go Shiina 2007 Eternal Sonata Music Drone Tactics Music We Love Golf!
