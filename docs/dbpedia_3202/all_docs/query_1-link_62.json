        "text": "For Immediate Release\n\nTokyo, Japan – January 6, 2009 – GEM Impact, Inc. announced today that CEO and composer Norihiko Hibino has been featured on an experimental collaboration album pairing accomplished Japanese game composers with talented anime vocalists. The album, titled Message, features Norihiko Hibino and vocalist Veil∞Lia’s original track, “Silent Message,” alongside pieces crafted by top game composers from Japan such as Yoko Shimomura (Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy XIII Versus), Motoi Sakuraba (Infinite Undiscovery, Star Ocean series), Nobuyoshi Sano (Ridge Racer series, Tekken series) and many others.\n\n“Message has provided all of us involved with a unique opportunity to work with an artist specializing in a different form of entertainment,” notes Hibino. “It was a highly rewarding experience, and I believe the music featured on Message is some of the best that has come out of either industry in quite some time. I look forward to hearing the reactions of listeners outside of Japan, as Message is really intended to transcend cultural boundaries and language barriers.”\n\nThe album was released on December 24, 2008 by Japanese record label TEAM Entertainment, and features 11 tracks covering over 50 minutes of music. It can be imported from Japan through a variety of online retailers, and carries a suggested price tag of 3,150 Japanese Yen.\n\nAbout GEM Impact\n\nFounded in 2005 by award-winning composer Norihiko Hibino, GEM Impact has emphasized a worldwide approach focusing on high-quality electronic music augmented with live performances. With four accomplished composers on staff, GEM Impact has provided audio solutions for numerous games, anime, and web projects, including the Metal Gear Solid series, Yakuza 2, Commando 3, 1942: Joint Strike, Beatmania, and the upcoming Ninja Blade.\n\nFor more information, contact:\n\nJayson Napolitano, GEM Impact, Inc.\n\n(951) 532-5245\n\njn@gem-impact.com"
