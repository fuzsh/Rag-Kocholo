        "text": "Mmm Kay. Hello everyone. Ya’ll are pretty familiar with this blog right? I post pics of crappy screen shots from Gensomaden Saiyuki and Saiyuki Reload.\n\nWhile this is a joke blog I want to be clear; I love the series, and I love watching the old anime, even if there’s some questionable art. Part of this blog’s purpose is to document poor quality in anime.\n\nDespite this, I support Minekura and her works. She has worked so hard on this series and I do whatever I can to boost when merchandise goes on sale (even if I have no way of getting it…). I’ve met folks who don’t care for the anime, including the new one coming out, but still support Minekura.\n\nThere’s been talk circulating that people are boycotting merchandise over the image of Sanzo with a very strange face. I’m sure you’ve seen it, so I wont post it again.\n\nYou’re going to dismiss the hard work of animators over one strange promotional image?\n\nI mean, can we take a moment to look what is on the website?\n\nLook at this handsome roach man.\n\nGaze upon this beautiful bastard.\n\nAdmire this lovely papa.\n\nProtect this small precious boy.\n\nI mean the art for the characters is just so nice.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the lovely backgrounds!\n\nAm I saying this is how the anime is going to look the entire time? Well, I mean, probably not. They have a budget to work with. But you know what helps to increase that budget and make the show look better?\n\nSupporting the show! Buying merchandise! Spreading the word!\n\nPlease, my friends, don’t let one bad image ruin what could be the best Saiyuki Anime adaption we’ve ever had. For the most part all the other promotional images have been pretty good. It’s just a bit unfortunate that some less than stellar art was chosen for merchandise. Don’t let that stop you from buying other merchandise though!\n\nDVDs! Manga! Statues! Other fun merchandise little rubber stamp charms!\n\nThe show might not be perfect, but this is Platinum Vision’s first attempt at a TV series on their own, and I think being supportive is the way to go. They aren’t a huge studio like Madhouse or UFOTable. They are just getting started.\n\nThere will be bumps along the way, I mean, what Journey doesn’t? Remember, supporting the anime also helps support our dear Minekura. I’m sure she’s excited for the new anime too!\n\nOkay, okay. This is the first I’ve heard of this, and I felt like someone poured an ice bucket over me\n\nI know I’ve ranted about how the boys got to look whiter in this series but\n\nBoycotting merchandise because of a drawing of Sanzo’s face gone wrong is just sad\n\nWe’ve waited over a decade for this show, and supporting the merchandise not only supports Minekura, but also supports the studio to enhance their work for any potential Saiyuki series in the future!\n\nWe all know famous anime shows nowadays get to have one slipup of a drawing or misspellings at some points, but that didn’t stop them from creating some of the great art and storylines worth passing on to others because of its greatness! (Looking at you, Black Butler and Yuri!!! On Ice)\n\nEveryone starts at something. Even Minekura herself started out with wonky art, but did that stop her? No! She continued practicing and redefining her art into the breathtaking and inspiring masterpieces we’ve come to adore today. And not supporting the anime merchandise is like a slap to Sensei’s face for all the hard work she’s done for all these years\n\nI’ve been searching the anime stores in my area and have been keeping on a lookout for any Saiyuki merch to come out for YEARS. Last time I saw Saiyuki merch in stores was back in 2003, and it was in the form of pins. I’ve cherished the Sanzo pin I bought, and over the years, I’m still searching for more—even if I know that Saiyuki’s popularity had waned during the course of a decade. Y'all don’t know how many times I’ve asked around, for over a decade, if they sell any Saiyuki merchandise at all. If it meant that some of my money will go to Minekura-sensei, then I am all too happy to buy merchandise\n\nBuying anime merchandise helps boosts Saiyuki’s popularity back, and heck, it might even pique other fellow customers’ interest about the show if you’ll buy some!\n\nHeck, if you really can’t help but feel that you don’t want to buy the slipped up, weirdass drawings of the characters, then look for other anime drawings of them that DO look pleasing to your taste, it’s that simple. You don’t have to boycott the entire thing\n\nRemember that Minekura-sensei is doing all of this despite her ailments, giving her fans the best that she could give everyday even if sometimes she felt like giving up. Fans have given her support for her work and it’s what makes her strong and encourages her to do her best\n\nThe best we could do for such an amazing person as her is supporting her work and the people who have contributed to bringing Saiyuki back to life once more"
