        "text": "The Sanzo party is back! And it is up in arms again against demons while giving us bales of laughter.\n\nMuse Asia recently got the license to distribute (through YouTube) the latest anime adaptation of Saiyuki, the Japanese version (with a twist) of the famous Chinese novel Journey to the West. In Saiyuki Reload Blast (which originally ran from July 5, 2017 to September 20, 2017), the four punk-like heroes who are presumed to be dead are called the Sanzo party. They continue their adventure to the West to stop the resurrection of a demon king. The crazy quartet is composed of Genjyo Sanzo (the gun-toting monk) and his followers Son Goku (the young monkey king with a bottomless stomach), Sha Gojyo (the red-haired half-demon), and Cho Hakkai (the level-headed man-turned-demon).\n\nWatching the series does not merely make me wax nostalgic. It also makes me brush up on what I learned in my high school subjects like Social Studies and Introduction to World Religions and Belief Systems. Journey to the West is a novel of worldwide fame owing to its historical context and strong roots to Chinese folk religion, mythology, and Buddhist philosophy. This made Saiyuki an altogether informative and entertaining tale about Asian history, philosophy, and religion. I can somehow discern how the four heroes in Saiyuki were adapted from the main protagonists of Journey to the West novel (being able to watch some film adaptations earlier) — Sanzo as the monk Tang Sanzang, Son Goku as Sun Wukong (Monkey), Gojyo having the same demeanor of Zhu Bajie, and Hakkai’s peaceful personality being inspired by Sha Wujing.\n\nEvery episode of Saiyuki Reload Blast is replete with QQs (quotable quotes) and WOW (words of wisdom). Here’s a couple of samples:\n\nThe animation of Saiyuki Reload Blast left me oohing and aahing — it’s as if I’m watching in 3D mode in YouTube. In every action or fight scene — blood would splatter oin the screen. At times, the screen would appear to be almost in smithereens because of Sanzo’s gunshots or water would splash from the fighting stunts of Gojyo. Such a remarkable leap from the Saiyuki franchise!\n\nMy favorite part in Saiyuki Reload Blast is the “Saiyuki Urasai” — a set of funny mini clips played right after each episode of the series. The meaning of “Saiyuki Urasai” is “Behind the scenes of Saiyuki Reload Blast”. It is kind of unusual for an anime to expose its bloopers from time to time. The producers did succeed in tickling our funny bones by showing us the foolishness of what I call the Flower 4 of Saiyuki.\n\nAnother thing which did not escape me while watching Saiyuki Reload Blast is the choice of artists behind its OP and ED songs. GRANRODEO who sang the OP “Move on! Ibaramichi” and Luck Life who sang the ED “Refrain” are the same artists who sang the OP and ED of my favorite Bungou Stray Dogs. I do now consider these two music artists a perfect combo for any cool and badass anime.\n\nSaiyuki Reload Blast is like an OG road trip with the boys using Hakkai’s Jeep or Hakuryuu. Whenever I watch each episode, I feel like I’m also included in their journey, thanks to the anime’s seemingly 3D animation and good visuals. Going westward will indeed be a journey of a lifetime if we are in the company of the mischievous yet cool Sanzo party."
