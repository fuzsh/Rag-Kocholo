        "text": "Alright, so maybe I was picking on Motoi Sakuraba a bit in our review of Valkyrie Profile and the stab we took at the game’s Norse mythology theme in our Yggdra Union review. I’ve actually been a fan of his for years, but with few exceptions, the large quantity of material he’s been putting out over the past couple years haven’t done it for me. While many of us are familiar with his multi-disc, progressive rock approach, I think Infinite Discovery shows signs that he is perhaps mellowing out a bit.\n\nInfinite Undiscovery is one of two of Square Enix’s recent Xbox 360 titles, and I was worried that Sakuraba’s 3-disc soundtrack was going to be more of the same. However, you’ll be surprised to hear there is little to no rock music here, as the score clearly focuses on orchestral and even cinematic styles. Needless to say, I was surprised and impressed by many of the pieces on the album, and am glad that the Square Enix North America store decided to stock an album that I may have otherwise passed up.\n\nHit the jump for complete impressions of the Infinite Undiscovery Original Soundtrack. (more…)\n\nWell, it’s that time of the year again. If you’re like me, you’ll be stuck inside, curled up by a fire, without wanting to wander out into the bitter cold, and with this holiday buyer’s guide you won’t need to. We’ve put together a list to help bring in the new year in style. We have everything from music to anime, so what more could you ask for?\n\nSee for yourself after the jump. (more…)\n\nCall me behind the times, but I never realized Square Enix had put out so many music samplers and promo discs at their various events over the years. The annual Square Enix Party events and recent Tokyo Game Shows have each featured their own unique collections of music given to attendees as a preview of upcoming soundtrack releases from Square Enix.\n\nSo, what did they have in store for fans at the Tokyo Game Show this year? The Square Enix Music Sampler CD Vol. 3 of course, featuring music from both released and unreleased titles from the Square Enix catalogue. While the packaging isn’t as elaborate as the Square Enix Party 2007 CD (awesome!), the collection of six tunes do get me excited about a couple of Square Enix’s upcoming albums.\n\nHit the jump for impressions of Square Enix’s snazzy sampler.
