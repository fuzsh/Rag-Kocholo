        "text": "Gwyn, Lord of Cinder\n\nSeptember, 22, 2011\n\nMotoi Sakuraba\n\nJapan\n\n(Video courtesy of allaboutVGmusic)\n\nDark Souls is the 2011 action / role-playing game that has captured the wonder of millions worldwide. It is difficult, terrifying, beautiful, ground-breaking, iconic, and is by far one of my favorite games of all time. This game is a piece of art, and I highly suggest you check it out if you have not tried it.\n\nIt is the story of a thousand stories, and one of those is that of Lord Gwyn. His story is a long one, but to give the sparknotes version he was the king of the gods during the age of fire. This fire is what keeps this age of gods alive, but as time passes the fire fades, ushering in the age of dark and of mankind. Gwyn is terrified of letting his age of fire fade and die, so he resorts\n\nto the ultimate sacrifice; he uses himself and his great soul as kindling for the fire. This keeps the age of the gods alive for a while longer, but fire will always fade into darkness. When you find him at the end of your journey to extinguish or preserve the fire, you find a burned, hollow version of this once great king of gods; you find a lord of cinders.\n\nThis song composed by Motoi Sakuraba perfectly captures the tragedy of Gwyn. It is an unexpected theme for the last boss of a hardcore, intense fantasy adventure, but it is rather fitting. There are many things about this song that lend to its brilliance and makes it one of the best songs in the Dark Souls franchise. Now begins the actual analyzation of the piece.\n\nMelody:\n\nOf course I need to discuss the melody a little bit, because it is wonderful! The simplicity of picking out notes on the scale of the piece juxtaposes and accentuates the emotional complexity of the song itself. I love how it sounds, especially considering the difference in timbre between this melody and its bass accompaniment. Those short, rhythmically simple high notes just scream of tragedy, catharsis, and everything in between. I love it!\n\nMeter:\n\nThis song is in a 3/4 meter, which according to our lecture is used heavily in waltz and dance music. I really like how the song feels as a result; it makes the song move in a continuous and non-terminated fashion. This aids the songs meaning as Gwyn is a god who wants things to continue as they are, and does not want his age of fire to die out. It is a pursuit that is futile, and is only successful in disrupting the balance of reality. The fact that it is in 3/4 also shows the dance of disparity that characterizes these games. It is really fitting that this meaning is emphasized in the encounter with the one who started the endless cycle of light and dark.\n\nRange:\n\nThis song is a solo on the piano, and the player utilizes both extremes of the keys. The right hand plays the sharp, dramatic stabs of the melody way high up, while the left hand is playing the moving, rhythmic accompaniment way down low. It is a meeting of two extremes that clash to create something that is much more than the sum of its parts. The melody and the accompaniment also meet in the middle to create a moving elegy for the death of a king.\n\nChords:\n\nThere is not much to say for the majority of the song other then that is competently composed to create chords that work well together. There is a portion near the middle of the song, however, that really catches my interest. It is where the song becomes monophonic and plays quarter notes. It begins with one note, after two measures the next scale degree is played, and after another two measures the third scale degree is played. This very dissonant, jarring chord is then played for four measures. I really like this part because it adds to the despair of this song. It sounds tragic and defeated, just like the being we are fighting at the end of time.\n\nDynamics/ Ornamentation:\n\nThis song is very dynamic, and I love it. Throughout the piece (especially near the end), there are crescendos and decrescendos that add so much volume (ha, get it?) to the music. Also, near the end of the song, there is use of ritardando that makes the song more dramatic. In the main melody there are also subtle grace notes on the high parts as well as accents, which makes that voice stand out more. Overall, Sakuraba utilizes these techniques to add texture and dramatism to this masterpiece, and it adds greatly to the experience.\n\nThese uses of musical elements are just some of the ways in which this song is brilliant. This does not mean that there can’t be a discussion made for how this song utilizes all other elements to its benefit.\n\nAlso if you want to learn more about Gwyn, and pretty much anything about Dark Souls, check out VaatiVidya on youtube. He is the authoritative voice in the dark souls community when it comes to analyzing the game’s story (most of my interpretations of the lore are based off of his conclusions). Not to mention his videos are pleasant to watch as well.\n\nMotoi Sakuraba\n\nThe composer of this piece (as well as the rest of the Dark Souls soundtrack) is a progressive rock musician/ keyboardist who specializes in making video game music, though his music also shows up in anime/ television shows. He was born in Akita, Japan, on August 5, 1965, where he developed a passion for music while receiving piano lessons in preschool. In his senior year of highschool, he spent his whole savings on a Teisco 110F Synthesizer, and since then he grew a reputation as an excellent keyboardist and as an up and coming solo performer. Since then, he has graduated from the University of Meiji, enjoyed success in multiple progressive rock groups, and has made it in the video game scene, where he has maintained a prolific career since 1989. His style of music is unique, as it draws upon baroque, progressive rock, jazz, and romantic influences among many other things, as well as his own unique spin. He has always evolved his style and is an eccentric composer to this day.
