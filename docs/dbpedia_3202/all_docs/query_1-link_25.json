        "text": "Square Enix has shared a new video interview with the composer of the upcoming Star Ocean The Second Story R, Motoi Sakuraba. He discussed his history with musical composition and how he came across the Star Ocean series.\n\nSakuraba used to be connected to a group called Wolf Team, which eventually became independent, resulting in the first Star Ocean. Sakuraba feels the series allows him to be his most natural self, with the usage of synthesizers enabling that.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Sakuarba states that he would like the Star Ocean series to do well so he can still work on its music.\n\nStar Ocean The Second Story R will feature fully voiced event scenes with the original voice cast, a newly arranged soundtrack by original composer Motoi Sakuraba with new songs, including some with a live band, as well as the new Break and Assault Action combat mechanics.\n\nPlayers can anticipate two selectable protagonists, Claude and Rena, akin to the recently released Star Ocean The Divine Force. Claude is a Pangalactic Federation officer and son of the legendary Ronyx Kenny, causing him to have internal strife regarding his identity. During a mission, Claude’s ego gets the better of him as he’s transported to an underdeveloped planet and spotted by Rena, confusing him for the Hero of Light.\n\nThe Earth, Galaxy, and Universe difficulties will also be implemented. Further, the developer is Gemdrops, known for porting Star Ocean: The Second Evolution to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in Japan. The original game was developed by tri-Ace.\n\nSubtitled French, Italian, German, and Spanish language support will also be available via a launch day update.\n\nBe sure to check out our extensive coverage of this upcoming game.\n\nA free demo with save data carry-over is available.\n\nCheck out our interview with the composer and producer.\n\nView our preview of this incoming title.\n\nCheck out the opening movie.\n\nSoundtrack Preview\n\nYou can view the Star Ocean The Second Story R video interview Motoi Sakuarba below:\n\nStar Ocean: The Second Story R is releasing for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam on November 2, 2023."
