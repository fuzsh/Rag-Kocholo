        "text": "Career\n\nAfter graduation Giffords began working at an accounting firm in New York City. In 1997 she returned to Tucson to become president and CEO of her family’s business, El Campo Tire Warehouses. Three years later she sold the company and was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives. She subsequently served in the Arizona Senate (2003–05) before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona’s 8th congressional district. She married astronaut Mark Kelly in 2007.\n\nAs a member of Congress, Giffords allied herself with fiscally conservative Democrats. However, she supported many of the economic policies of U.S. President Barack Obama. As her congressional district bordered Mexico, she took a strong interest in immigration issues. She notably opposed a strict Arizona law enacted in 2010 that targeted undocumented immigrants.\n\nAs a Democrat in a state that traditionally leaned Republican, Giffords sometimes faced fierce political opposition. In 2010, after she voted for the health care bill that was later enacted as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), her office in Tucson was vandalized. Later that year she endured a challenge to her seat from a Republican candidate backed by Tea Party supporters. Giffords won reelection by only a slim margin.\n\nOn January 8, 2011, Giffords hosted a “Congress on Your Corner” meeting with constituents in the parking lot of a supermarket in Tucson. While there she was shot in the head by Jared Lee Loughner. She survived the attack, but 6 people, including a nine-year-old girl, were killed and 12 others were injured. Loughner was initially ruled unfit to stand trial on multiple charges of murder and attempted murder. After receiving extensive medical treatment for schizophrenia, however, he was allowed to plead guilty. In November 2012 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nAfter several months of rehabilitation Giffords was able to attend the launch of the space shuttle Endeavour, commanded by her husband, on May 16, 2011. Later that year she and Kelly published Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope (written with Jeffrey Zaslow). In January 2012 Giffords resigned from the House of Representatives, citing the need to focus on her ongoing recovery."
