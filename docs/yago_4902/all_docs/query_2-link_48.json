        "text": "To go or not to go?\n\nThat’s the question that has tongues wagging as the astronaut husband of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords prepares to jet into outer space — less than a month after his bride was shot in a horrific massacre that left six others dead.\n\n“I’m sorry to judge him, but gosh — if I were he — I’d be here,” said Newton divorce attorney Sharyn Sooho. “This is a real difficult time for any marriage and so for him to be away while she’s going through all of this — I wish them the best of luck.”\n\nAs the congresswoman continued her road to recovery at a Houston rehab yesterday, her other half was at a press conference announcing his two-week mission aboard the space shuttle Endeavour.\n\nCommander Mark Kelly, who was training for the mission when his wife was shot, wouldn’t reveal her condition but said she would be “very comfortable” with his plans to leave Earth.\n\n“I know her very well and she would be very comfortable with the decision that I made,” said Kelly, who added he even plans for his wife to attend the April 19 launch.\n\nBoston University journalism professor and Huffington Post contributor Caryl Rivers said it’s hard to judge without knowing Giffords’ condition.\n\n“Certainly, if she is in a condition where she can’t talk to him about it or can’t communicate — then I would say he should not go,” Rivers said. “It is a dangerous business — going into space.”\n\nSooho said she doesn’t blame Kelly for saying that he has to get back to work but warned that long-distance communication isn’t the same should a difficult moment come up.\n\n“For him to be away, I think is very, very hard. I just don’t see how that works,” Sooho said. “If they get through it, they will be a miracle couple.”"
