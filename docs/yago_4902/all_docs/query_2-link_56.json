        "text": "WASHINGTON — The White House says President Barack Obama has invited Rep. Gabrielle Giffords’ husband to tonight’s State of the Union address. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama looks forward to having Mark Kelly, a retired NASA astronaut, as a guest sitting with the first lady.\n\nA Brighton chemist and a Denver college student also will attend, White House officials told The Denver Post on Monday. Lorelei Kilker, a scientist, was part of a large class of women who benefited from an federal investigation into alleged systemic sex discrimination.\n\nMahala Greer, 24, of the University of Colorado Denver, introduced Obama in the fall when he visited her campus. She has worked through college and will graduate in May with $35,000 in debt. She represents a program the administration is pushing to make paying for college easier. Denver Post staff writer Allison Sherry and The Associated Press"
