        "text": "(CBS News) Gabby Giffords resigned her congressional seat earlier this year, but a new political action committee in her name is one way the Arizona Democrat plans to stay in politics.\n\nGiffords and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, announced the creation of Gabby PAC Tuesday, 20 months after Giffords was shot in the head during a mass shooting in Tucson.\n\nPolitico first reported the former congresswoman filed a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission last week.\n\nThe couple announced Tuesday that others involved in the committee include former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, a Republican; and former Clinton Administration Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.\n\n\"Gabby PAC will only support candidates who are dedicated to working hard for commonsense, bi-partisan solutions that strengthen our communities and our entire country,\" said Kelly and Giffords in a press release. \"This commitment to public service over partisanship is what guided Gabby while she was serving the people of Arizona and will be the guiding principle of Gabby PAC.\"\n\nGrayson, who resigned his office to be director at Harvard University's Institute of Politics, told The Washington Post he's not switching sides but is very good friends with Giffords.\n\nIt's not clear which candidates Gabby PAC will be supporting, but the press release promised a focus on renewable energy, veterans' benefits, creating jobs and strengthening the economy.\n\nGiffords' health has improved dramatically since she was left in critical condition on January 8, 2011. However, she still struggles with speech and movement.\n\nWhen she officially handed in her resignation on Jan.25 of this year to focus on her recovery, both she and Kelly hinted they plan to remain involved in politics in some capacity."
