Sage was born at 1:48pm on Saturday in Tucson to Kelly’s daughter Claudia and Mark Sundman. The baby and her mother are healthy.\n\n“Gabby and I couldn’t be happier to be welcoming our first grandchild to the family,” said Senator Kelly. “The most important roles I have ever had in my life have been husband and father. Today, I get to be a proud parent of my daughter Claudia, who is going to be a wonderful mother, and her sister Claire, who is excited to be an aunt, and Gabby and I also get to be proud grandparents, ready to spoil and love the newest member of our family.”"
