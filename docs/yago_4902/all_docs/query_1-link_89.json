        "text": "— Rep. Gabrielle Giffords can walk while holding onto a cart, mouth the lyrics to easy songs and have simple conversations, according to family, staff members and her doctors.\n\nMark Kelly said in an interview broadcast Monday on NBC that he can ask his wife questions and she can respond.\n\n“The communication is coming back very quickly,” he said.\n\nKelly said she is trying sohard that her speech therapist, who only a few days ago was trying to get her to talk more, is now asking Giffords to slow down and make sure she hears the question before giving an answer.\n\nAs an example, Kelly spoke of a time when the therapist had three cards on a table, one with a picture of George W. Bush, one with a picture of President Barack Obama and another with an image of George Washington.\n\n“Before she was asked a question, she’d picked up the card and held it up and said,‘George Bush,’” Kelly told NBC’s Brian Williams. “ She’s a hard worker and she’s trying. She’s speaking a lot, and at some level they are asking her to slow down a little bit.”\n\nThe New York Times,citing doctors and her staff, reported on its website late Sunday that Giffords’ efforts to relearn how to speak have included mouthing song lyrics, such as “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” and “Happy Birthday to You,” as friends and family sang along.\n\nGiffords also briefly spoke with her brother-in-law Scott Kelly by telephone Sunday afternoon as he orbited aboard the International Space Station.\n\n“She said, ‘Hi, I’m good,” her chief of staff, Pia Carusone, told the paper. Kelly is the brother of Giffords’ husband, who is also an astronaut.\n\nShe has also been receiving bedside briefings from aides on the recent uprising in Egypt and on last week’s decision by Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona not to seek re-election,\n\n“We tell her everything that’s going on,” Carusone said. “Don’t get the idea she’s speaking in paragraphs, but she definitely understands what we’re saying and she’s verbalizing.”\n\nGiffords was shot in the head Jan. 8 while meeting with constituents outside a Tucson grocery store. Six people, including a 9-year-old girl and a federal judge, were killed in the attack, and 13 others, including Giffords, were wounded.\n\nThe congressman began intensive rehabilitation at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston late last month. The Times reported that an e-mail sent to friends about a week ago by Giffords’ mother said that Giffords has been doing squats and repetitive motions to build her muscles and walking through the hospital’s halls while holding onto a cart.\n\nThe 40-year-old Giffords has beaten one of her nurses at tic-tac-toe and has changed from “kind of a limp noodle” to someone who is “alert, sits up straight with good posture,” the e-mail from Gloria Giffords said.\n\nMeanwhile in Arizona, federal prosecutors have been allowed to drop two charges against accused gunman Jared Lee Loughner for the murders of U.S. District Judge John Roll and Gabriel Zimmerman, an aide to Giffords.\n\nU.S. District Judge Larry Alan Burns, who is presiding over the case against Loughner, ordered the charges “dismissed without prejudice to the government to later refile these charges,” according to a court filing published Monday.\n\nThe order didn’t state a reason.\n\nRobbie Sherwood, spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Tucson, said Saturday that prosecutors sought the dismissal to give them more time to prepare charges that could bring the death penalty.\n\n“It was completely as expected,” Sherwood said in a telephone interview. “It’s a formality to clear these complaints off the books to make way for them to come back for a superseding indictment.”\n\nJudy Clarke, Loughner’s lead attorney, didn’t immediately return a phone message.\n\nLoughner, 22, pleaded innocent to an indictment for the attempted killing of Giffords and two other members of her staff at a Jan. 8 community meeting outside a Tucson supermarket. While separately charged in a complaint with the killing of Roll and Zimmerman at the meeting, Loughner hasn’t been indicted on those counts.\n\nFederal law requires a defendant be indicted before a case may proceed, giving prosecutors 30 days to seek one from a grand jury.\n\nThe case is U.S. v. Loughner, 11-00187, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona (Tucson).\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Karen Gullo and Edvard Pettersson of Bloomberg News."
