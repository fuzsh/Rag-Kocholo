Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut and Navy captain Mark E. Kelly, will write a memoir, to be published by Scribner at a yet-to-be-announced date.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the book ‘will be an intimate chronicle of everything from their careers and courtship to the Jan. 8 tragedy when a gunman shot Giffords in the head during a political event in Tucson, Ariz. Six people were killed in the attack, and 12 others besides the congresswoman were wounded.’ The report continues:\n\nGiffords and Kelly will collaborate with writer Jeffrey Zaslow, who helped Randy Pausch in penning ‘The Last Lecture’ and Capt. Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger with his memoir, ‘Highest Duty.’ Kelly will be the principal collaborator, with Giffords adding some details. The two met in 2003 and were married in 2007.\n\nGiffords, a Democrat, was elected to her seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, then reelected in 2008 and 2010. She was holding a constituent meeting in a Safeway parking lot when she was shot in the head on Jan. 8 by Jared Lee Loughner. Loughner has since been declared mentally incompetent to stand trial. On June 9, Giffords’ Chief of Staff Pia Carusone told the Arizona Republic that Giffords’ ‘communication skills have been impacted the most.... She’s living. She’s alive. But if she were to plateau today, and this was as far as she gets, it would not be nearly the quality of life she had before,’ Carusone said. ‘There’s no comparison. All that we can hope for is that she won’t plateau today and that she’ll keep going and that when she does plateau, it will be at a place far away from here.’\n\nGiffords was released from a Houston hospital June 15; she has a 24-hour home healthcare provider as she continues her rehabilitation.\n\n-- Carolyn Kellogg\n\nPhoto (left): Rep.
