        "text": "“Gabby always loved playing with my wedding ring. At almost every meal, she’d slip the ring off my finger and move it from her thumb to her forefinger to her middle finger. On January 13, 2011, five days after Gabby was shot, I was sitting with her in her hospital room, holding her left hand with my left hand. She had opened her eyes very briefly the day before, but she still remained in a mostly comatose state. We didn’t know if she’d make it back at all. But then, suddenly, as she held my hand, her fingertips started exploring my ring, and then, despite seeming as if she was unconscious, she actually pulled the ring off, and began to move it from one of her fingers to the next for the next five minutes. She didn’t drop it once. For the first time since she was shot, I felt as if I had a clear reason for hope. She’s still Gabby,” I thought, “She’s going to pull out of this.”\n\nExcerpt from Gabby, A Story of Courage, Love and Resilience by Gabrielle Giffords and Mark Kelly"
