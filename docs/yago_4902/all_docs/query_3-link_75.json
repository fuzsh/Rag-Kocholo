The two stopped in Portland on Saturday to promote their \"Rights and Responsibilities\" tour.\n\nThe couple is calling for what they consider responsible measures to curb gun violence, particularly an expansion of background checks.\n\nGiffords was almost killed in a deadly shooting at political rally in Arizona in 2011. Kelly, a retired NASA astronaut, says he is not saying no to a potential run for office in the future.\n\nClick on the video to see our 1-on-1 interview with Kelly."
