Up and Down arrows will open main level menus and toggle through sub tier links. Enter and space open menus and escape closes them as well. Tab will move on to the next part of the site rather than go through menu items.\n\nArizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (YL '04) and her husband, astronaut, Mark Kelly, are set to release a joint memoir on November 15th.\n\nThe memoir is called Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope and was co-written with The Last Lecture co-author and Wall Street Journal columnist, Jeffrey Zaslow."
