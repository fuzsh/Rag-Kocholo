        "text": "Today, Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke released the following statement regarding the resignation of Congresswoman Gabrielle “Gabby” Giffords:\n\n“With the retirement of U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, today is an emotional day for all of us. Gabby and I started in the same congressional class of 2007. I have had the pleasure of serving alongside Gabby on important issues such as immigration reform. She always demonstrated exemplary leadership and will remain a shining example of determination and strength.\n\n“As a Member of the House of Representatives, Gabby has represented Arizona’s 8th Congressional District, proudly demonstrating her commitment to working for her constituents. Whether promoting security on the border, raising the minimum wage, or increasing federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research, Rep. Giffords’ work speaks volumes about her dedication.\n\n“On January 8, 2011, U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and eighteen other people were shot during a “Congress on the Corner” public meeting that Rep. Giffords was hosting in Tucson, Arizona. Today is not only a farewell to Rep. Giffords, but it also pays homage to the victims of the shooting, particularly the six individuals who lost their lives on that day.\n\n“This sad and unfortunate incident points to the need for our country to have stronger gun control laws. It also points to the need to ensure that despite our continued political differences, we must maintain a respectful tone.\n\n“As Americans we must remember that regardless of the political discussions in which we are involved in, we are responsible for our words and actions. We must be committed to setting the example of civility and promoting the ideals of democracy. I wish Gabby’s wonderful husband Captain Mark E. Kelly and the rest of her family the best in the future. I hope Gabby has a full recovery and I look forward to her return as a public servant.”\n\n###"
