Why?\n\nYes, never want to forget what happened\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of Gabby?\n\nGabby's last vote on the house floor\n\nHave you listened to any of Mark Kelly and Jeffrey Zaslow ’s other performances before? How does this one compare?\n\nno\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nyes\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nGod Bless Gabby, thank you for all you do for others.\n\nAn Inspiring Story, Great Performance as well\n\nWould you consider the audio edition of Gabby to be better than the print version?\n\nI would consider this to be better than the print version because Mark himself is reading the book. His inflection and struggle add an entirely new layer to the book.\n\nWhat other book might you compare Gabby to and why?\n\nI would compare this with Bob and Lee Woodruff's book as it is another journey from TBI back to life.\n\nWhat does Mark Kelly and Jeffrey Zaslow bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nMark brings a layer of humanity to the story, hearing him read his contingency letters added a wave of emotion where needed and humor to break what could be a very sad book.\n\nWas there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?\n\nThe moment that particularly moved me was Mark's description of the plane ride to Tuscon when it was reported that Gabby had died. So moving and honest, he could have omitted it completely, but instead chose to tell his entire journey.\n\nA Modern Day Love Story\n\nMark Kelly began documenting Gabby's treatment almost immediately after she was injured as a way to show her progress and to help encourage her when she was down. This book takes us behind the scenes and into the hospital room and even into his own mind as to what they were thinking and doing and why. It's been a hard road, but in spite of that, Mark and Gabby are taking this tragedy and turning it into something good. This book is sad at times, but also insightful and inspiring. Of course, the added bonus is that the book is narrated by the author. I can only imagine how difficult that was for Mark. So I hope you will cut him some slack as you listen and remember he's an astronaut, not an actor! . A worthwhile listen!\n\nInspirational story I'll listen to again & again\n\nThis book is so much more than a story of courage and hope. It is the story of their love for each other and for this country--with the important message that we all need to renew our commitment to civility and respect for each other. I treasure the fact that Mark reads the book--he does an amazing job expressing his joys and frustrations. And hearing Gabby read the last chapter is perfect. Godspeed to Mark and Gabby!\n\nAbsolutely inspiring!\n\nGiven this book was written hastily due to the contemporary nature of it, this was a great read! The narrator's voice was a bit sing-songy, but knowing he is an astronaut telling his own story and not a professional narrator, it was no problem. Besides, the emotion of the story easily overcomes any shortcomings the narrator might have. In trying to find adjectives for this book, I can only keep coming up with one - INSPIRATIONAL! GO GABBY! GO MARK!\n\nNot Bad\n\nWhere does Gabby rank among all the audiobooks you’ve listened to so far?\n\nJust Ok\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of Gabby?\n\nHow she struggled to formulate words.\n\nWhat three words best describe Mark Kelly and Jeffrey Zaslow ’s voice?\n\nMonotone, clear, okay.\n\nIf you were to make a film of this book, what would be the tag line be?\n\nMy life until now.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI had never heard of Gabby or Mark prior to the shooting. I had watched their interview on T.V. and found it fascinating. How the mind works and the challenges of the recovery for somebody with a head injury. I approached this more interested in the medical side of her recovery and how their personalities and love helped them get through everything. More like 25% biographical and 75% the journey of recovery. Instead, it was more like 75% biographical and 25% recovery. It wasn't bad...and if you're interested more in what made them the people are today, then you wont be disappointed, you'll get a good picture of how they grew up and got to their careers. So, just think ahead about which story you want to hear and then make your determination."
