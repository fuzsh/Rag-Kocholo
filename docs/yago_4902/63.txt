The astronaut married to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords has made his choice. Mark Kelly, the West Orange, NJ native, is headed to space in April.

An official close to the space shuttle program confirmed Friday morning that astronaut Kelly will be aboard Endeavour for its final flight. The official did not want to be named because the

information has not yet been made public. Kelly will hold a news conference at Johnson Space Center in Houston on Friday afternoon.

Kelly took a leave from training after Giffords was gunned down at a Tucson, Ariz., shopping center on Jan. 8. She's undergoing rehab in Houston.

Kelly spent the past month debating whether to step down as commander of Endeavour's two-week mission. Liftoff is targeted for April 19.
