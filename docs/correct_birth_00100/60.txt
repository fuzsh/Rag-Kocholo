Br Mark was a much-loved member of our Brothers’ communities, as a Community leader on a number of occasions, and as a teacher mainly in middle school. Br Mark had a great interest in musicals, especially Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, and presented many of these and massed choirs in schools where he taught. An active sportsman himself, he is remembered as a strong handballer and athlete and as a successful coach of Australian Rules Football, Cricket and Rowing.

May he now rest in peace with his God

whom he loved and served so faithfully.
