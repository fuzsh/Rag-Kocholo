        "text": "Mike Bryan and Sam Querrey recently made a friendly wager as to who would conclude their career with more titles at the Farmers Classic.\n\nAlthough Querrey is the defending singles champion at the 84th annual event at UCLA, it was a bold move to bet with Mike, who, along with twin brother Bob, has captured five doubles titles in the past nine years at L.A. Tennis Center.\n\n“I feel like we still have a few left in us, hopefully starting (today),” Mike Bryan said. “But I like his chances.”\n\nSaid Querrey: “We both won it last year and it would be great to win it again. It’s always fun to do well at your hometown tournament. But I know I’ve got my work cut out for me.”\n\nWhen it comes to today’s final, the 100th ATP championship match of the Bryan brothers’ storied career, Querrey isn’t betting against his U.S. Davis Cup teammates in their pursuit of making history.\n\nWith tickets reserved for 85 family and friends, and hundreds of additional supporters expected to be in attendance at Straus Stadium, the Bryan brothers will take center court at noon against fellow American Eric Butorac and UCLA graduate Jean-Julien Rojer of Netherland Antilles in pursuit of their 62nd ATP World Tour doubles championship, a record for most in the Open Era (1968 to the present).\n\n“When you talk about 100 finals, that’s a lot of Sundays, two years’ worth. It’s just amazing to believe how much work you put into each one of those,” Bob Bryan said. “One hundred is a mind-blower. But to get 62, we’re excited for this match for a lot of reasons.”\n\nAt the top of the list is exceeding the standard established by the Australian pair of Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge — inductees July 10 into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Rhode Island — who are tied with the Bryans at 61 career titles, the last coming Aug. 14, 2000, in Cincinnati with a victory over Ellis Ferreira and Rick Leach.\n\nWoodforde, who witnessed the Bryans’ 6-2, 6-4 semifinal victory Saturday over India’s Rohan Bopanna and Pakistan’s Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi, is scheduled to be among those spectators today. Another interested aficionado will be Great Britain’s Andy Murray, who is scheduled to face Querrey in the singles final following the doubles championship.\n\n“I follow doubles a lot and what they’ve achieved in doubles is incredible,” said Murray, whose brother, Jamie, teamed with Butorac to reach the 2006 doubles final, losing to the Bryans 6-2, 6-4. “They’re really good for tennis and they’re dad (Wayne) is really good for tennis and they’re really nice guys as well. When you’re talking about 62 titles, that’s amazing.”\n\nAlthough the Bryans have won their past eight finals appearances, including all five this year, they haven’t captured one since their May 15 win over rivals Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia — the world’s top-ranked team — in Madrid, Spain. The Bryans lost in the second round of the French Open and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon.\n\n“That’s the added enjoyment, when you break or create records, it’s even better to do it in a familiar event,” Woodforde said. “We’ve been in contact a lot with Mike and Bob and we were hoping they would break it at something like a Grand Slam, at the French Open or Wimbledon … but it is a big occasion for them. This is what Todd and I have passed on to them. Without a doubt, we knew they were going to break the record, it was just a matter of when.”\n\nWhen the Bryans graduated from Rio Mesa High in 1996 — the same year they made their tournament debut at the event formerly known as the L.A. Open, losing to Keith Evans and Michael Joyce — and went on to play at Stanford before turning professional, their short-term goals were to represent the United States playing Davis Cup and compete in the Olympics.\n\nBut after winning their first title at L.A. Tennis Center in 2001 — defeating Andy Roddick and Jan-Michael Gambill in the final — the Bryans have averaged six championships over the past nine years, including a career-high 11 in 2007. They’ve won at least one Grand Slam in each of the past six years and eight overall, trailing the Woodies’ career record of 11.\n\n“The Woodies have really been supportive of us throughout our careers. We’ve learned a lot from them and we can’t thank them enough for giving doubles an important place in this game,” Bob Bryan said. “We played them four times and to beat them one time was huge (in San Jose in 2000). We couldn’t believe we beat the greatest of all time.”\n\nWith more than 600 career victories together, along with records for consecutive Grand Slam finals appearances — seven in a row from 2005 to ’07 — and 16 Grand Slam finals overall, the Bryans are already the elite team of the past decade. But regardless of whether the Bryans set the record today, next week in Washington D.C. or at the U.S. Open, Woodforde feels it’s unfair to label either team as the best ever.\n\n“We were the best of the ’90s and they’re the best right now, but I never played to be considered the best ever and when Bob and Mike first started out, I don’t think they did either,” said Woodforde, who also won seven Grand Slam mixed doubles titles, in addition to six men’s doubles championships with partners other than Woodbridge.\n\n“When Mark and I played, we had no idea about some of the records we were breaking, which obviously Bob and Mike have a better understanding of now. It’s good enough for me to be considered among the best teams. They’ve come out and said that we’re chasing the Woodies and what a wonderful form of flattery for Todd and I. So, if they erase every record that Todd and I accomplished, then good on them.”\n\nEver since their last meeting with the Woodies in 2000 at the Queen’s Club tournament in London — the final grass-court tournament prior to Wimbledon — the Bryans have proudly carried the banner for doubles on the ATP World Tour and want to continue to do so for at least another five years.\n\n“I’m proud we’ve kept doubles alive because for a while, it was going down the tubes. The doubles player was losing its place in the game,” Bob Bryan said. “It’s always going to be behind singles when it comes to TV and popularity, but I’d like to think we’ve done our part to help out.”\n\nThey did their part Saturday by dedicating their 15th consecutive victory at UCLA to their grandmother Alice Bryan, who was celebrating her 88th birthday.\n\nThey’ll try to create more memories today on the court on which they first played SCTA junior team tennis when they were 6 years old. It’s a safe bet there will be a chest bump for the ages by the brothers if they do.\n\n“It’s the most prestigious doubles record there is and it’s amazing to even be in the same conversation as the Woodies because we idolize them,” Mike Bryan said. “It seems like we’ve been chasing it forever, but to finally get it would be unbelievable.”"
