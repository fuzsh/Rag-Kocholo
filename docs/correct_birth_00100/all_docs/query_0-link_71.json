        "text": "Adelaide - Adelaide City\n\nIntroduction to the City and Suburbs\n\nAdelaide Pre 1841\n\nCity Life\n\nEarly Births\n\nEmigration Square\n\nSurvey\n\nFor an account of a trip from Port Adelaide to Adelaide in 1838 see Port Adelaide\n\nThe City and Suburbs\n\nSee Miscellany and Obituaries for an essay on \"Night Auctions and Other Things\"\n\nAlso see Adelaide - Suburbs.\n\nI believe it has never before been noted that the country on which Adelaide was to be built was first viewed by [Collet Barker] on the wedding anniversary of the consort after which it is named.\n\n(Advertiser, 22 April 1931, page 10h.)\n\n\"The Queen Who Gave Her Name to Adelaide\" is extolled in the Advertiser, 12 February 1936, page 8c.\n\nThe name of 'Adelaide' was assigned to the chief town before its site was fixed. Governor Hindmarsh had given publicity to this fact long prior to the adjustment of the unfortunate dispute with Colonel Light, our first Surveyor-General, and Sir John Jeffcott, our first Judge, as to the relative merits of the plains adjoining the Torrens (not then named) and the slopes fronting upon Encounter Bay.\n\nThe lady, who was to become Queen Adelaide, came to England as a young princess from a happy court of a small German state, where her father ruled very much like a good king in a fairy tale. She came to marry the elderly Duke of Clarence, who sent one of his illegitimate sons to meet her and introduced her, himself, to the nine other children of his irregular union, all of whom lived under his roof. Adelaide was young and serious minded and she could hardly have been happy at his opening of her new life, but she behaved with the noblest kindness to the Fitzclarences, as the future King's children were called. She treated them as a gentle stepmother, furthered the careers of the eldest sons and, herself, superintended the education of those who were still children. Her portraits show her as a charming looking woman, delicate and a little sad.\n\nThe death of her only child, Princess Charlotte, was a life long grief to one who was a great lover of children. She and her husband, William IV, celebrated the accession to the throne with a modest and economical coronation and Adelaide had her crown made at her own expense. Storms were soon to break over her. England was full of distress and all liberal hopes were set on the Reform Bill which would give the poor man the vote and thus, it was thought, lessen economic misery. Queen Adelaide, who never understood English ways fully, had no faith in democratic reform which she associated with revolution. She honestly believed that if the Whigs triumphed she would be beheaded like Marie Antoinette. There is, nevertheless, every evidence from those who knew her that she did not talk politics to the King, but endeavoured to divert his mind from them and save them from worry.\n\nHer views became known and then began Queen Adelaide's real martyrdom. The leading newspapers, The Times among them, attacked, openly or subtly, the 'foreign woman' of influencing the King against reform. She was blamed for his reluctance to create enough new peers to swamp the resistance of the House of Lords.\n\nAt the time of the founding of South Australia the Queen had almost lived down the bitter hatred of the country and the passing of the Reform Bill had disposed of some of the more violent objections. There was even many happy days. The King, whom she had so loyally loved, and who had loved and leaned on her in return, died a year after the naming of Adelaide. The rest of her story is of ill health and suffering, brightened only by the knowledge that she had, at least, lived down calumny and false reports.\n\nWhen she died she left a sum of money and certain memorabilia to the public authorities of South Australia and the latter comprised:\n\nAutographs of Her Majesty, a facsimile of her own directions for her funeral; and a personal pocket handkerchief;\n\nEnvelopes of autographs of the late members of the Royal family; letters of George IV; autographs of various crowned heads of Europe; letters of the Duke of Wellington; a letter of Lord Nelson's to the Duke of Clarence; and autographs of King William IV.\n\nLetters from sovereigns of Europe to Queen Adelaide; two cameos of King William IV and Queen Adelaide framed and glazed; several volumes of books with Queen Adelaide's autograph or the Royal Arms which belonged to Her Majesty; a glass goblet presented to her on the occasion of her visiting a German spa; an iron bracelet worn by patriotic German ladies who had given their jewels and golden ornaments to maintain the war with the French in the times of Napoleon I.\n\nToday, her funeral directions are housed in the State Library - A touching document in which 'knowing that we are all alike before the throne of God', she asked to be borne to her grave by sailors '√çn peace and free from pomp and vanity.'\n\nThe Register of 12 December 1860 at page 3a has an article entitled \"Adelaide and Port Adelaide in 1859\" which includes a poem:\n\nSuch my friends is Adelaide,\n\nA child in its career;\n\nBut time, no doubt, will paddle it\n\nInto manhood, year by year\n\nAnd kindly governor's swaddle it\n\nTill that manhood doth appear;\n\nMay never a mortal saddle it\n\nWith taxes on its beer.\n\nHard facts disprove the claim that Colonel Light was a superb town planner... The failure comes in the subdivision. Streets should run across the compass, so that both sides shall have their fair share of sun and shade. Long, straight streets are uninteresting, and, in a hot windy land, are undesirable. The placing of the squares has resulted in their inevitable crucifixion by traffic requirements...\n\n(See Advertiser,\n\n8, 9 and 13 November 1934, pages 18e, 28c and 18c and\n\nThe News,\n\n2 and 13 November 1934, pages 5d and 3e.)\n\nAdelaide City - Choose again\n\nAdelaide Pre 1841\n\nEarly Births in the Colony\n\nThere has been much controversy over the \"first born\" child in South Australia - the Register of 20 April 1876 has a report of a son being born to Mrs and Mr W.H. Neale in Nepean Bay on 18 September 1836 - the infant died at Holdfast Bay on 18 November 1836.\n\nSee Observer,\n\n26 June 1858, page 4e and\n\nRegister,\n\n9 May 1876, page 5d for an article which covers the counter-claim of the Hoare family,\n\n16 November 1907, page 4d and South Australia - Comment on the Colony for a \"first-hand\" account of the \"Hoare\" birth at Rapid Bay.\n\nExtracts from Dr Woodforde's diary are reproduced on 17 and 20 June 1901, pages 3f and 8i which confirm the \"Hoare\" story and relates the birth of a female child to Mrs B.T. Finniss a little later.\n\nA letter from B.T. Finniss is in the Observer,\n\n17 August 1889, page 27c,\n\n31 December 1892, page 36c,\n\nRegister,\n\n11 March 1905, page 7f.\n\nThe honour of being the first \"The First Born SA Male\" is claimed by Samuel J. Stuckey in the Chronicle,\n\n15 June 1901, page 21c.\n\nThe claim that Fanny Lipson Finniss was the first white female child born in South Australia is challenged in the Register, 8 March 1905, page 6d where Mrs John Willoughby (nee Easton) claims to have been born in a tent on the site of the Old Gum Tree at Glenelg on Proclamation Day 1836 or the day following. She also claimed to be the only woman who survived the wreck of the Admella in 1859 - this is disputed on\n\n8, 11 and 16 March 1905, pages 6d, 6d and 3c and\n\n15 April 1905, page 6h.\n\nFor further claims and counterclaims see Register,\n\n22 and 23 March 1907, pages 6c and 7h,\n\n12 April 1907, page 9g,\n\nAdvertiser,\n\n9 November 1907, page 8g,\n\nRegister,\n\n28 May 1915, pages 5h-6b,\n\n15 February 1919, page 10g.\n\nA claim by Mr C.F.

The maze-like character of the spot was much enhanced by the multitudes of wattles...\n\nThe people were walking at a rapid business-like rate, passing each other with slight nods, as if time were precious... There were posts at intervals to protect the foot passage; these were split and warped. Heat seemed the order of the day... In approaching the town from the Port the west and most dilapidated portion is presented, with just sufficient amount of civilisation to spoil the verdure of the country...\n\nAdelaide in 1839\" is recalled in the Register, 15 January 1878, page 5d:\n\nAt that time it resembled an extensive Gypsy encampment. Not the semblance of a street existed on the land; although all the main streets had been duly laid down on the plan. It was in fact an extensive woodland, with here a solitary tent and there clusters of erratic habitations. There were canvas tents, tarpaulin tents, wurleys made of branches, log huts, packing-case villas and a few veritable wooden cottages...\n\nThe scene in 1897 was a little different:\n\n[I] am astonished and disgusted to find one of our most important business thoroughfares converted into a rendezvous for the assembling of a most disreputable class of men who ply their trade of gambling in the street, and under the eye, and apparently with the sanction of the police.\n\n(Register, 10 July 1897, page 7h.)\n\nThe settlement is described in the Southern Australian,\n\n26 March 1840, page 3d,\n\n2, 16 and 23 April 1840, pages 4d, 5a and 4a.\n\n\"Talk with a Pioneer - The First White Woman in Adelaide\" is in the Register,\n\n28 December 1906, page 5b.\n\n\"Early Adelaide After 1840\" is in the Observer,\n\n16 January 1926, page 49e.\n\nA reprint of an article by Nathaniel Hailes entitled \"Early Adelaide\" is in the Register,\n\n8 July 1907, page 4h.\n\nRecollections of early days of the colony are in the Advertiser,\n\n27 December 1886, page 5d.\n\nAdelaide City - Choose again\n\nAdelaide Pre 1841\n\nEmigration Square\n\n(Taken from Geoffrey H. Manning's A Colonial Experience)\n\nBrought from the discomforts of shipboard, we were lodged in a square of not exceeding ten feet, exposed to wind, water, heat and cold. During our sojourn in these quarters it often occurred that in same small square were crammed two families, evincing the great regard paid by the authorities to decency and general comfort, 'sadly destroying morality and engendering in the habitus from many steaming carcases, diseases, miseries and death.'\n\nThe square, situated in the Park Lands in the vicinity of the modern-day railway yards and north of the Newmarket Hotel, consisted of a good number of weatherboard houses which had been brought from England in framework. They were fixed on brick, about a foot from the ground, and had strong board floors and gabled ends, with the door and window facing west and east.\n\nInterspersed with these structures were ramshackle huts each comprised of two rooms, each compartment being 16 feet square, with sapling sides, the roofs being thatched and filled with reeds gathered from the banks of the River Torrens. The hospital, the dispensary and the resident doctor's quarters were in the centre of the square.\n\nThere were twenty or more of these houses forming the square, but only one or two had a fireplace, the fuel consisting of green bushes brought by the Aborigines. To kindle a fire required a certain expertise because safety and/or lucifer matches were not in common use. Accordingly, the following method was utilised - In one hand a piece of flint was held, and in the other a piece of steel and these had to be struck against each other until the sparks went down on to the tinder.\n\nShortly after our arrival the miserable sheds forming the Emigration Depot were declared to be incapable of affording that comfortable and healthy shelter that persons coming off so long a voyage require. I recall, vividly, a mother lying on a bed and groaning with dysentery, while in the same room two hulking fellows narrated past adventures with flippant indecency of tongue. Diseases gained strength in the foul air and the great number of beings congregated in such confined spaces should have called for remedial action by the authorities. But, alas, during our period of occupation, no positive action was undertaken.\n\nFurther, the medical attention supplied to the emigrants was exceedingly defective and it was believed, generally, by the inmates that the necessity for cool, pure water could have been alleviated at a moderate cost by sinking wells.\n\nI might add that the first general store in South Australia was established here in 1837 when John B. Hack and his brother, Stephen, brought to the colony a quantity of groceries and drapery. A Mrs Chittleborough purchased some of the stock and opened a shop in 'Buffalo Row' but, unfortunately, the family's reed hut and store caught fire in the middle of the night and was razed to the ground.\n\nOne event I recall was a banquet prepared by John Adams for about a dozen colonists at a cost of a half-a-crown per head. A special fire was made in the open air as there were no fireplaces. Two forked sticks were put in the ground on each side of the fire and a cross piece on the top. A bullock's heart was suspended before the fire and kept revolving, a dish underneath being utilised to catch every drop which, I assumed, was to be combined with some flour to make a 'piquant' gravy. It was no sooner pronounced as being ready for the table when it was attacked with gusto and 'there was none wasted'.\n\nGeneral Notes\n\nInformation on the square is in the SA Record,\n\nNovember 1837, page 8c,\n\nObserver,\n\n17 January 1880, page 114b,\n\n12 April 1924, page 58d,\n\nRegister,\n\n31 December 1894, page 6e.\n\n\"Cruel Robbery\" at an Immigrants' Depot is in the Register,\n\n8 January 1855, page 2g.\n\nThe reminiscences of Nathaniel Hailes are in the Register,\n\n9 July 1857, page 3f,\n\nObserver,\n\n20 July 1907, page 44c and\n\nJames Chittleborough (ex Buffalo) in the Advertiser,\n\n29 November 1912, page 12b;also see\n\nRegister,\n\n26 April 1900, page 6g.\n\nEmigration Square is described in the Observer,\n\n29 December 1906, page 37c,\n\n20 July 1907, page 44c,\n\nRegister,\n\n27 July 1911, page 9c under \"Landing in Pioneer Days\":\n\nThe square consisted of a good number of weatherboard houses which had been brought from England in framework.
