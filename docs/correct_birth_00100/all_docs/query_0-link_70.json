        "text": "SYDNEY, Australia -- Despite victories already in the rugby, cricket and netball world cups, nothing would satisfy the insatiable appetite of the Australian sporting public more than to win the Davis Cup in its centennial year.\n\nThe Davis Cup is a tournament close to Australian hearts, not just because of the great success the nation has enjoyed over the past century but also because of the history and value attached to the 100-year-old men's team event.\n\nAustralia has already won the Davis Cup 26 times - second only to the United States - but has not won the event since 1986.\n\nWhile top American players such as Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi have refused to play Davis Cup because it interferes with their regular tournament commitments, Australians, almost to a man, have made it their top priority.\n\nAustralia's highest-ranked player, Pat Rafter, says he rates the Davis Cup ahead of the four Grand Slams - including the two U.S. Open titles he has won.\n\nUnfortunately for Rafter, he has been forced to miss this weekend's final against France because of a shoulder injury.\n\nHis place in the team has gone to Lleyton Hewitt, the fist-pumping Adelaide teenager who once said he was born to play Davis Cup. Whatever Hewitt lacks in experience he makes up for in enthusiasm.\n\nHewitt made his Davis Cup debut in this year's quarterfinal against the United States, winning both his singles matches, then kept his perfect record intact when he led Australia to a semifinal win over Russia, disposing of world No. 2 Yevgeny Kafelnikov.\n\nAustralia's doubles pairing, Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde, are also Davis Cup fanatics.\n\nThe Woodies have won five Wimbledons, two Australian Opens, two U.S. Opens and an Olympic gold medal. They also have the finest Davis Cup doubles record in Australian history (14 wins, two losses) but say they will not rest until they win the trophy.\n\nThe irony, though, is that the man who holds the key to Australia's chances is Mark Philippoussis, who once turned his back on the Davis Cup team, an act that is tantamount to heresy in Australia.\n\nThe three have made up and they are all committed to the one goal. No one wants to win the Davis Cup more than Australian captain John Newcombe. As a player, Newcombe won it five timesbetween 1964 and 1973 but he is still searching for his first win as a captain.\n\nAustralia beat the United States in their quarterfinal in Boston, then beat Russia at home in September to reach the final for the first time since their 1993 loss to Germany.\n\nBeating France will be tough, though. Apart from the absence of Rafter, the Australians face the added difficulty of playing away from home on an indoor clay court that will not suit their game.\n\nBut the greatest asset the Australians have is their will to win. \"It's going to be tough, there's no doubt about that,\" Newcombe said. \"They've got the advantage of the home court and the home crowd but I'd rather have my team than theirs.\"\n\n… we have a small favor to ask.
