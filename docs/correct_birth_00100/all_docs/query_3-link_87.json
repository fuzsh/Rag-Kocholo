        "text": "Star said he'd only play doubles if put on team.\n\nBROOKLINE - In the end, Tom Gullikson knew he made a bad deal with Pete Sampras, one that blew apart the team's spirit and led to a shocking collapse against Australia.\n\naccepting Sampras's insistence that he play only doubles, Gullikson set up a weekend of acrimon suspected flimflammery that tainted the centennial celebration of the Davis Cup at its birthplace.\n\nGullikson, the team captain, looked exhausted after the U.S. loss Sunday, as if he had just played five sets in the 102-degree heat - 130 degrees on the concrete court. Instead, it was Todd Martin who was consumed by the heat even before Patrick Rafter beat him in five sets.\n\n\"Maybe it is a character builder,\" Gullikson said, trying to muster a weak smile after the Americans went down in flames, 4-1, in this quarterfinal. \"Hopefully, we learn from these lessons and go on. ... You've got to play the cards you're dealt.\"\n\nIn this case, Gullikson had the deck stacked against him, and he didn't realize it, or acknowledge it, until it was too late.\n\nAustralia seemed weakened by the injury at Wimbledon that knocked out big-serving Mark Philippoussis, but 18-year-old replacement Lleyton Hewitt was more than adequate.\n\nThe Americans seemed to have the home advantage at Longwood Cricket Club, but the Australians had never lost there in eight previous visits. And Rafter was playing on the same hard surface used at the U.S. Open, where he won two consecutive titles.\n\nMartin and Jim Courier seemed a strong 1-2 punch, especially after the way they played against England in April, but neither could be expected to roll to easy victories.\n\nOnly two Americans fit that description. But Andre Agassi chose not to play Davis Cup this year, and Sampras joined the team late with the qualification he would play only doubles.\n\nGullikson said he'd never accept that condition again.\n\n\"If you are on the team, you are on the team, absolutely,\" he said. \"That is what I would do, in hindsight.\"\n\nSampras didn't want to \"jump on the bandwagon\" and displace Martin or Courier. But Sampras and Gullikson should have realized the bandwagon would race by them if Sampras didn't play singles.\n\nWhen Gullikson accepted Sampras' condition, he guaranteed endless speculation about a last-minute substitution for Martin or Courier. Gullikson had until Thursday to change his mind, and when he put Martin and Courier in singles the Australians barely suppressed their glee.\n\nAussie captain John Newcombe cautioned that the Americans might find a convenient injury to slip in Sampras. But Friday came and went, and Sampras sat as Martin lost to Hewitt, and Courier to Rafter. On Saturday, Sampras teamed with Alex O'Brien to prevent a sweep with a five-set victory over Mark Woodforde and Sandon Stolle.\n\nNo sooner was that match over than Longwood was rife with rumors about Martin being injured. Gullikson fed such talk by saying his players weren't 100 percent.\n\nMartin had felt fine but didn't like hearing implications from his captain that he wasn't fit enough, or good enough, to play Rafter.\n\n\"I was very upset,\" Martin said Sunday. \"I wanted to play. I didn't feel like I was in bad enough shape not to play. I told Gully that I was upset. ... I tried to convince Tom last night that I was health ready to go.\"\n\nSo the Australians naturally questioned the Americans' honesty when Martin claimed he felt woozy after practicing a half hour and couldn't play. Even Sampras couldn't believe it when Gullikson called him at 11:30 a.m. - 90 minutes before the match - and told him to warm up.\n\nAn American team doctor pronounced Martin unfit, a neutral doctor disagreed and the referee ordered Martin to play or default.\n\nMartin received intravenous fluids half an hour before playing and proved the neutral doctor right, taking the first two sets and leading 4-2 in the fifth before losing. Everyone - Martin, the doctors, Gullikson - agreed after the match Martin's health was never in danger.\n\nWhen it was over, the Americans had managed to turn a weekend celebration into a wild mess. They had \"the best player on the planet,\" as Gullikson called Sampras, sitting out singles - the equivalent of Michael Jordan sitting out the NBA Finals. They lost badly on their own court. And they left the impression, right or wrong, they were willing to cheat to win."
