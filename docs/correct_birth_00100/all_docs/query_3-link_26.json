        "text": "Former Australian Davis Cup tennis star Peter McNamara has died from cancer aged 64.\n\nMcNamara, who reached a career-high No.7 in the world in 1983, beat all-time greats Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl to win two of his five singles titles.\n\nBut he is perhaps best remembered for his successful doubles partnership with Paul McNamee, the duo twice winning Wimbledon, in 1980 and 1982 as well as the 1979 Australian Open.\n\nMelbourne-born McNamara also reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open singles in 1980, the quarter-finals of Wimbledon in 1981 and the French Open last eight in 1982.\n\nAfter retiring in 1987, McNamara enjoyed a successful coaching career.\n\nHe coached Mark Philippoussis, guided Grigor Dimitrov in his formative years, and more recently Matt Ebden and Wang Qiang.\n\nMcNamara worked with Wang Qiang until February, helping her reach the world's top 20 during their four-year union.\n\nMcNamara died peacefully at his home in Germany on Saturday night after a long and courageous battle with prostate cancer.\n\nAccording to family friend and commentator David Law, McNamara continued to play exhibition matches and coach throughout his illness with few people ever knowing of his battle.\n\nHe is survived by wife Petra, his children and grandchildren.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
