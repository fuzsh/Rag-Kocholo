        "text": "(CNN) -- Identical twins Bob and Mike Bryan carved their place in tennis history as they wrapped up a record-breaking career doubles title in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Bryans had been tied on 61 with legendary Australian pair Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde since winning the Madrid Open title back in May.\n\nBut at the Farmers Classic they finally broke out of the tie with the 'Woodies' with a battling 6-7 6-2 10-7 victory over Eric Butorac and Jean-Julien Rojer.\n\nIt was their sixth title at the hard court tournament in Los Angeles but they were made to work hard for their win, which is also their sixth title of the year.\n\nPat Cash meets the Bryan brothers\n\nAfter the opening two sets were tied, the Bryans raced to a 5-0 lead in the tiebreak set decider only to see Butorac and Rojer claw back to seven points each.\n\nBut the 32-year-old Americans kept their nerve to win the final three points and close out a memorable victory, celebrating with their traditional chest-bumping ritual.\n\nWoodforde was courtside to see his record broken and paid tribute to the Bryans.\n\n\"For many, many years you've been traveling in elite company. Thanks to the victory today you're in rarefied air,\" Woodforde said.\n\n\"Our run sort of ended because I elected to retire, but I know you two will continue for years to come. The floodgates will open entirely, so I know 70, 80 will come.\"\n\nMike Bryan said they had never believed they could break the mark at the start of their career.\n\n\"The Woodies put a record way out there -- 61 was Mount Everest when we started,\" he said.\n\n\"We love what we do. To get this, one of their many records, is special.\"\n\n\"We really looked up to the Woodies,\" Bob Bryan added.\n\n\"They didn't have the power and big serves, but they had the poaching and the technique.\"\n\nThe brothers have included eight grand slam men's doubles titles in their incredible tally and will now target the all-time record of 79 set by the famous partnership of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver."
