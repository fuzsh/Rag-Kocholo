        "text": "It has been a massive year so far for West Australian tennis star Matt Ebden. —\n\nAfter nearly missing the birth of his first child and, with doubles partner Max Purcell, coming runner-up in the men’s doubles at the Australian Open, the 34-year-old triumphed in the same event at Wimbledon.\n\nEbden and Purcell, 24, both collapsed on their backs in relief after becoming the first Australian pair in 22 years to win the men’s doubles at Wimbledon since the legendary “Woodies” — Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge — last took out the title in 2000.\n\nThe duo’s epic battle to defeat Croatia’s defending champions, Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic, to capture the Wimbledon men’s doubles crown took more than four hours. Their finals win means they will share a prize purse of about $947,304.\n\nIn what has been a huge tournament for Ebden, he also made it to the final of the mixed doubles at Wimbledon with Sam Stosur, where they were defeated by American-British duo Desirae Krawczyk and Neal Skupski.\n\n“It definitely is the biggest year, the way it’s shaping up, and it’s only halfway through,” Ebden told The West Australian.\n\n“To have had Harvey, (his son) that’s the highlight of my life ... but now to have won Wimbledon as well, it’s hard to believe.\n\n“It’s an indescribable feeling, like nothing I’ve ever felt before. I’ve been fortunate to have many great moments and achievements, but there’s a certain magic or enchantment about Wimbledon centre court, it does things to people.\n\n“There’s such a long history of Aussies winning at Wimbledon in the last 100 years, and to be a tiny little piece of that history and puzzle now is incredibly special.”\n\nNot bad for a kid who came to Perth from South Africa as a 12-year-old.\n\nEbden’s parents, Charles and Ann, were members of a local tennis club in Durban in South Africa, where he was born, and his two older sisters, Tarryn and Candice, were also athletic.\n\nHe showed early signs of his skill with a tennis racquet, playing in his first tournament at the age of five. The young Ebden would spend most weekends and afternoons at the tennis club, hitting balls against the wall. He started lessons when he was four.\n\nIn 2000, Ebden’s family moved from Durban to Perth where he started his secondary education at prestigious Wembley Downs boys’ college Hale School.\n\nInstead of sending their talented son to a tennis academy, Ebden’s parents had support from Hale for him to skip a year of school, jumping straight from Year 8 to 10, so he could finish Year 12 early to allow him to focus on his tennis.\n\nHe still achieved marks high enough to allow him to enrol at the University of WA in a combined law and commerce degree, but deferred his studies.\n\nAmong those who were watching the hard-fought men’s doubles match on television in Australia was Ebden’s former headmaster at Hale School, Stuart Meade, who clearly remembered him as “an outstanding young man”.\n\nIt’s a whirlwind, but an incredibly good one that makes you feel like you can fly\n\n“I remember he played in the first tennis team from Year 8, and did not lose a match during his time in the secondary school,” he said.\n\n“He was as committed and as disciplined as you would see from a young student.”\n\nInspired by then leading South African players Wayne Ferreira and Amanda Coetzer, Ebden set his sights high from an early age, determined to do as well, if not better, than his idols.\n\nAnother former tennis great, Margaret Court, also played a key role in Ebden’s career as a mentor. His family regularly attended the church she founded, Victory Life Centre, and she was at Wimbledon to witness his success. The Wimbledon triumph for Ebden and Purcell comes six months after they finished as runners up to the “special Ks” combination of Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis in the men’s doubles at the Australian Open in January.\n\nEbden’s involvement in that tournament almost caused him to miss the birth of his first child with wife Kim because Premier Mark McGowan’s last-minute backflip on lifting WA’s border restrictions meant he was still completing 14 days isolation on his son’s due date of February 14.\n\nAt the time, Ebden slammed the decision as “ridiculous”, declaring he may not have played in the tournament if he knew the Premier was going to change the rules.\n\n“I think it’s ridiculous,” he said at a post-match press conference.\n\n“I think everyone there is starting to see that everyone has been lied to for so long, the trust has been betrayed.”\n\nFortunately, baby Harvey waited just long enough for his dad to finish quarantine before making his appearance on February 15.\n\nKim and Harvey have since joined Ebden in Europe, with the tennis champion writing on his blog how much more happy and relaxed he felt being able to have his family with him at Wimbledon. Harvey slept in his pram in a corner of Wimbledon’s Dog and Fox pub while his parents celebrated most of the night.\n\nThe couple, who can’t wait to return to Perth to party with family and friends, said they had woken to thousands of messages from fans.\n\n“It’s a whirlwind, but an incredibly good one that makes you feel like you can fly,” Ebden said.\n\nKim was still pinching herself about the “surreal” events. “After so many years of doing this journey together, it’s just amazing to finally get the holy grail of a Wimbledon title,” she said.\n\nDespite all his hard work to get to that stage, Ebden looked bemused by the crowd’s thunderous applause when he and Purcell held their trophies aloft. “I can’t believe it,” he said after the match.\n\nHe congratulated the Croatian partnership for putting up such a good fight during the five-set thriller, giving special mention to Pavic who played the whole match with a broken right-hand.\n\nAnd he paid tribute to Woodforde, who was on the warm-up court with them, and to Woodbridge, who had spoken to them before the match. “We definitely channelled the Woodies — they were great mentors — and even helped me coaching-wise in my career,” he said.\n\nThe win meant Ebden had to reveal to his wife a bet he made with Purcell months ago — that he would grow a mullet hairstyle if they won.\n\n“I made a private little bet with him and I said ‘you know what, if we win Wimbledon I’ll grow a mullet until the Aussie Open’,” he said.\n\n“I’m a man of my word.” But Kim plans to speak to Purcell about the wager. “I’ll have a chat to Max and see if he can get out of that,” she laughed."
