        "text": "Australia's top-ranked tennis players since 1990\n\nDespite its small population, Australia has always punched above its weight in sport.\n\nTennis is no different.\n\nSince 1990, Australia has had three world No.1s and a raft of others have cracked the top-10 – Alex De Minaur the most recent.\n\nSo who are the others that have cracked the top-40? Can you name all of them?\n\nWide World of Sports has the list.\n\n19. Todd Woodbridge\n\nAlthough they were perfectly in-sync when on the court, it's still a little spooky both Woodies reached a career-high singles ranking of No.19.\n\nAs they were in doubles, it was on grass Woodbridge was most dangerous, and it was at Wimbledon where he achieved most of his singles career highlights.\n\nHe's one of only seven people to beat Pete Sampras at the All-England club, and is also one of only 17 players to inflict a triple bagel defeat in the open era. He beat swede Johan Örtegren 6-0, 6-0, 6-0 in the final round of qualifying in 2001.\n\nHe also made a semi-final appearance in 1997, but lost in straight-sets to Sampras, who went on to win.\n\nThat semi-final lifted him to his career-high No.19.\n\nWoodbridge is one of Nine's leading tennis analysts and sports broadcasters.\n\n17. Bernard Tomic\n\nIn what is a strong example of a player failing to fulfil his talent, Bernard Tomic absolutely dominated as a junior.\n\nHe won two junior slams and began competing in men's competition full-time aged just 16.\n\nHe reached his career-high singles ranking of No.17 in January 2016, just days before he began his run to the fourth round of the Australian Open, which would be an equal-best showing.\n\nInjury struggles began not long after though, and his decline proper began in 2017. Having made the third round at the Australian Open, Tomic bombed out in the first round at each of the other slams. His decline from then on is well-documented.\n\n13. Nick Kyrgios\n\nHaving burst onto the scene in 2014, Nick Kyrgios looked for all money to be the next big thing in Australian tennis.\n\nHe beat then world No.1 Rafael Nadal to make the Wimbledon quarterfinals, and won his first ATP event soon after.\n\nHe's since claimed seven ATP titles, and famously made the 2022 Wimbledon final.\n\nHe reached his career-high ranking of No.13 in October 2016.\n\nHis hot temper, apparent indifference towards tennis and fickle relationship with the media has earned him a level of notoriety among fans, although many close to him have stated his persona behind the scenes is a polar opposite.\n\nStill, he's one of if not the most entertaining players in men's tennis.\n\n8. Mark Philippoussis\n\nMark Philippoussis was a part of a trio that led a golden era of Australian men's tennis.\n\nThe Scud was known for having one of the biggest serves in tennis, and won 11 ATP Titles in a fourteen-year career.\n\nPhilippoussis lost both his slam finals appearances – including all-Australian affair with Pat Rafter at the 1998 US Open final.\n\nHe peaked at No.8 the following April after a five-set victory against Carlos Moya to win Indian Wells - his only Masters Series title.\n\nHe made a brief comeback of sorts in 2015, but has mostly focussed on coaching.\n\nPhilippoussis has been working on-and-off with Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas for the past several years.\n\n4. Jelena Dokic\n\nStill the only qualifier to ever beat a world No.1 at Wimbledon – achieving the feat as a 16-year-old in 1999.\n\nAlthough she wasn't playing under the Australian flag at the time, Dokic achieved her career-high No.4 ranking following the US Open.\n\nDokic's career was probably hampered by her well-documented off-court struggles that often involved her father.\n\nAfter brief hiatus, Dokic returned to the court and went on a tear at the 2009 Australian Open, reaching the quarterfinals and lifting herself back into the top-100.\n\nShe retired in 2013, and has since worked as a coach and pundit.\n\nDokic now works as one of Nine's lead tennis commentators and analysts.\n\n1. Lleyton Hewitt\n\nWhen Lleyton Hewitt became world No.1 in November 2001, he was the youngest man to ever hold the ranking, a record which would stand until Carlos Alcaraz won the US Open in 2022.\n\nWhat Hewitt lacked in serving power, he made up for in sheer tenacity. He was incredibly fit, and was known for his ability to make his opponents play an extra shot. He also boasted an incredible volley and one of the best overhead smashes in the game.\n\nHis famous 'C'MON' shouts and the accompanying hand gesture were parroted by a generation of kids regardless of the sport they played.\n\nConsidering Hewitt was playing at the same time as Pat Rafter and Mark Philippoussis, his time at No.1 was during a golden era of men's tennis in Australia.\n\nThe three of them were undoubtedly inspirations to the current crop of Aussie stars including Alex de Minaur, Alexei Popyrin, Thanasi Kokkinakis, and even Ash Barty before them.\n\nSince his retirement from playing, Hewitt has been a captain of the Australian Davis Cup team.\n\nHe's also become a mentor to Alex de Minaur, and has dabbled in coaching.\n\n1. Ash Barty\n\nOne of the best ambassadors not only for tennis in Australia but sport as a whole, Ashleigh Barty won the hearts of a nation.\n\nShe won the junior girls title at Wimbledon in 2011 aged just 15, but was unable to really crack it once she aged out of juniors and went pro.\n\nBarty took two years off and took up cricket, famously playing for the Brisbane Heat in the inaugural WBBL season in 2015-2016.\n\nShe returned to tennis a few weeks after the WBBL season wrapped up, and from there her career took off.\n\nShe won her first WTA title in Malaysia only 12 months later. She won several others throughout her meteoric rise up the world rankings, and won her first slam at the French Open in 2019. She became No.1 after the Birmingham Classic in the lead up to Wimbledon.\n\nShe lost it briefly to Naomi Osaka, but once regaining it with a fourth-round appearance at the US Open, would hold onto it until her retirement in March 2022.\n\nBarty won three slam titles, but it was her Australian Open victory in 2022 that was her crowning moment.\n\nShe retired a short time later, stating she had lost the physical drive to remain competitive at the top of world tennis.\n\nHer retirement left a massive hole in Australian tennis, particularly on the women's side.\n\nBarty welcomed a son with her husband Garry Kissick in July 2022."
