        "text": "But this often wins the backing of the crowd before a shot is played.\n\nCombine this with a hugely respectful personality and fun way of playing, and it is not difficult to see why Hewitt's victories delight tennis fans.\n\nBorn in Adelaide in 1981 into a family of sporting achievers, Hewitt first played tennis on the grass court at his home.\n\nHe was four-years-old when his parents decided it was time for his first tennis coach - after he had impressed with his stroke play and was able to hit the ball over the net.\n\nIt is hardly surprising that his sporting prowess was discovered early - his mother Cherilyn is a former champion netballer, his father Glynn is a league footballer, and his sister Jaslyn is already ranked number one tennis player in Australia for her age and has achieved more in the sport than her brother had at the same age.\n\nBy the age of eight, he was winning under-10 games and always won a year ahead of his age.\n\nIt was then it became clear a professional career was a possibility.\n\nHe did however dream of a football career but his parents dissuaded him from what they believed was more physically dangerous.\n\nIn 1998, at the age of 16, Hewitt received a wildcard into his hometown tournament in Adelaide - with only one professional match under his belt.\n\nHe was ranked 550th in the world, but in succession despatched Scott Draper, Mark Woodforde, Vince Spadea, Andre Agassi and Jason Stoltenberg to become one of the youngest ever players to win a singles' tour event.\n\nHe started the 1999 season in similar fashion, earning a spot in the final at Adelaide but was defeated by Thomas Enqvist.\n\nHowever, he hit winning form later in the year beating Malisse Xavier in the final at Delray Beach to capture his second career title.\n\nThe year also saw him drafted into the Australian Davis Cup team in which he joined Pat Rafter for the quarter-finals.\n\nHe won rubbers against Todd Martin and Alex O'Brien, before moving on to meet the Russians and beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Marat Safin.\n\nHe went down to Cedric Pioline during the final in France, but it mattered little as Australia captured the Davis Cup for the first time in 13 years.\n\n'Future of tennis'\n\nHe has since gone from strength to strength, winning three tournaments in 2000 prior to the Stella Artois, and will take high expectations with him to Wimbledon.\n\nIn the competition last year, Hewitt made his way through to the third round before going down to Wimbledon legend Boris Becker who was making his final appearance at SW19.\n\nFollowing his victory over Sampras, whom Hewitt regards as \"probably the best player ever to pick up a racquet\", the US star hailed his opponent as \"the future of tennis\".\n\nWhile Hewitt himself says he would rather concentrate on winning the Masters Series before concentrating on winning a Grand Slam, Sampras believes his performance at Queen's Club makes him a definite contender for his Wimbledon crown.\n\nThe Aussie whizz-kid played down his chances however saying: \"I won't consider myself unless I am walking out on Centre Court in two Sundays' time for the final.\"\n\nLleyton Hewitt may be only 19, and have never appeared in a Grand Slam final before, but it has to be said, stranger things have happened."
