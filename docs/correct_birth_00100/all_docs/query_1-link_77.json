        "text": "(L-R) Joe Salisbury (Great Britain) and Rajeev Ram celebrate after winning the men's doubles final at the 2022 U.S. Open on Sept. 9, 2022 in New York City.\n\nU.S. Olympian Rajeev Ram partnered up with 2020 Olympian Joe Salisbury of Great Britain to win a repeat doubles championship in New York on Friday, defeating No. 2 seeds Wesley Koolhof of the Netherlands and Neal Skupski of Great Britain in the first one vs. two final matchup in men’s doubles since 2005.\n\nRam and Salisbury emerged with a 7-6, 7-5 victory, making them the first U.S. open repeat champions in men’s doubles in more than 25 years. The last ones to do it were Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde, an Australian pair who won 11 grand slam titles together.\n\n“Obviously, if you can kind of emulate them in anything in tennis, it’s pretty good company to keep,” Ram said.\n\nRam won a silver medal in mixed doubles at the Olympic Games Rio 2016. He has three grand slam titles with Salisbury, beginning at the 2020 Australian Open.\n\nCaty McNally and Taylor Townsend had an exciting run to the U.S. Open women’s doubles final, but they fell just short Sunday in trying to be the first all-American tandem to win the title since 2011.\n\nEntering the tournament unseeded, McNally and Townsend pulled off several upsets to make it to the final. Once there, they lost to No. 3 seeds Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic, 3-6, 7-5, 6-1.\n\nThe 20-year-old McNally and 26-year-old Townsend were attempting to become the first Americans to win a women’s doubles title since CoCo Vandeweghe in 2018, and the first all-American partnership to win since Liezel Huber and Lisa Raymond in 2011. Townsend was playing in the tournament for the first time since giving birth in 2021.\n\nFrances Tiafoe celebrates scoring against Carlos Alcaraz (Spain) during their men's singles semifinal at the 2022 U.S. Open on Sept. 9, 2022 in New York City.\n\nLater Friday night, Frances Tiafoe’s crowd-pleasing run in men’s singles ended in a five-set loss to No. 3 seed Carlos Alcarez of Spain in a dramatic match that lasted more than four hours.\n\n“I’m gonna come back and I’m going to win it one day,” Tiafoe said to the crowd in a post-match ESPN interview on the court.\n\nTiafoe, a 24-year-old from Hyattsville, Maryland, and the tournament’s No. 22 seed, was attempting to become the first American to win the U.S. Open men’s singles title since Andy Roddick in 2003. Roddick was in the stands this week at Arthur Ashe Stadium to watch Tiafoe play. Tiafoe was the first Black American to reach the semifinals since Ashe himself in 1972.\n\nTiafoe knocked out No. 2 seed Rafael Nadal of Spain in the round of 16 and then defeated No. 9 Andrey Rublev in a three-set sweep in the quarterfinals.\n\nTiafoe won the first set against Alcarez, 7-6, lost the next two sets by scores of 6-3 and 6-1, then forced a fifth set by winning the fourth set in a tiebreaker. Alcarez won the deciding set by a score of 6-3.\n\nThe crowd at Arthur Ashe cheered Tiafoe on with every shot and erupted when Tiafoe won the fourth set in a 7-5 tiebreaker.\n\nDavid Wagner, a three-time Paralympic gold medalist, made the final in wheelchair quad doubles and lost in the semifinals in quad singles. Wagner and partner Robert Shaw of Canada lost 6-1, 6-2 in Saturday’s doubles final to Sam Schröder and Niels Vink of Netherlands. Schröder knocked off Wagner in singles on Friday.\n\nWagner was looking to win his fourth U.S. Open singles title and 10th doubles title."
