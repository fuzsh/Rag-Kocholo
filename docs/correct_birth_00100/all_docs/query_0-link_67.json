        "text": "2022 finalist Daniil Medvedev's draw opened up for him when Rafael Nadal lost and he wasted little time against Australia's John Millman.\n\nMedvedev, who won the 2021 US Open, before losing the final here last year was pushed early on by the veteran Australian, before winning in straight sets.\n\nMillman pushed Medvedev all the way to 5-all in the opening set before the Russian star took his game up a level.\n\nHe broke Millman for 6-5 and then served out the set before racing through the second and third sets.\n\nThe latter sets combined took just over what he required to win the opener in the 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 victory.\n\nFor Medvedev, the match represented a good hit out as he chases a third straight Australian Open final.\n\nFor Millman, it was a tough draw but his performance showed he is ready to have a better year than a 2022 that was interrupted by injury.\n\nMedvedev said Millman \"played amazing\" and credited the Australian for being able to break his serve multiple times.\n\n\"One moment in the first set I was like, 'how am I going to handle this',\" he said.\n\nMedvedev also laughed about his slim physique post match but said he was feeling \"strong\" and ready for the challenge a full fortnight will take.\n\nResults coming thick and fast at the moment and in the women's singles Coco Gauff has taken out a tight battle of young guns.\n\nGauff saved a pair of set points in the second set to deny the Brit, who has struggled with injury and form since she won the 2021 US Open as a teenager.\n\nRaducanu gave it her best but still hasn't made it past the second round of a slam since that heady run.\n\nGauff meanwhile has been labelled one of the favourites here and her steely 6-3, 7-6 victory showed she can get tough when it matters.\n\nJason Kubler gave it his all, including winning an epic 70-shot rally, but it wasn't enough to topple 18th-seeded Russian Karen Khachanov.\n\nThe US Open semifinalist prevailled over the Australian in four sets, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2.\n\nBut the pair played what will be remembered as one of the great points of the tournament.\n\nWith Khachanov serving for the second set, Kubler broke back after a 70-shot rally as his backhand clipped the tape for a winner.\n\nKubler then rattled off three straight games to take the set.\n\nIt was as close as he would get.\n\nKhachanov basically apologised on court for knocking off an Aussie and begged for fans to cheer him with his message on the camera lens.\n\n\"Sorry Aussies, keep cheering for me, please.\"\n\nKhachanov will now play America's Frances Tiafoe in the next round.\n\nWell it took a while but Thanasi Kokkinakis has finally booked a second round battle with Andy Murray.\n\nKokkinakis was giving Italian veteran Fabio Fognini a free lesson last night when rain stopped play and continued in that vein tonight.\n\nThe Australian led 6-1, 6-2, 4-2 when the players walked off court and took 3 minutes to finish the Italian 6-2 in the third.\n\nDespite a below par performance from Fognini, Kokkinakis said he was full of confidence heading in after falling just short of defending his hometown Adelaide title.\n\n\"Adelaide gave me a lot of confidence I feel like my tennis is at a good level,\" Kokkinakis said.\n\nOn Tuesday Murray returned to some of his best form to stun Italy's Matteo Berrettini in 5 sets.\n\nThe 35-year-old admitted he was sore after that one and with a history of injury one has to wonder what condition he will be in but Murray as always will give it his all against Kokkinakis.\n\nIt was something Kokkinakis knows and although Murray was somewhat of a mentor to a younger Kokkinakis, the Australian said all of that will be irrelevant tomorrow.\n\n\"I feel good,\" Kokkinakis said.\n\n\"I am ready to give tomorrow a crack and am pretty hungry for it.\n\n\"Andy is a hell of a player and has been for many years ... I have known him for a while and he took me under his wing a bit when I came on tour.\n\n\"I will put all that aside tomorrow and no matter what court we're on... I hope you guys get behind me and get rowdy.\"\n\nThere's doing things the hard way and then there's this.\n\nAustralia's Jason Kubler was staring down the barrel of a two-set deficit against Karen Khachanov, with the 18th-seeded Russian serving for a 6-4, 6-4 lead.\n\nBut at 30-40 Kubler dug deep and I mean DEEP!\n\nThe pair proceeded to execute a rally the likes of which left tennis fans and players alike guffawing.\n\nThe crowd on KIA Arena held their breath and added several gasps as the epic point unfolded before Kubler clipped the tape with a backhand and the ball dropped over to see him break back for 5-all.\n\nAustralian player Luke Saville labelled Kubler an \"animal\" on Twitter as plenty of others lauded the achievement.\n\nKubler then held his serve before again breaking Khachanov to take the second set 7-5 and level the match.\n\nAustralian tennis Hall of Famer and Nine Network commentator Todd Woodbridge has taken to Twitter to call out an online troll following Rafael Nadal's shock Australian Open loss.\n\nWoodbridge shared the post from an Instagram user on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAfter the user posted: \"Just a old has been trying to stay in the lime light! Shame they heart attack didn't end you\".\n\nWoodbridge said that sort of \"unacceptable behaviour\" needed to be called out.\n\nThe Australian, who won 16 grand slams men's doubles titles, with partners Mark Woodforde and Jonas Bjorkman, suffered what he said was a \"mild\" heart attack in 2022.\n\nThe 51-year-old retired in 2005 and is now commentating the Australian Open for Nine, alongside Jim Courier and a host of others.\n\nAs far as Australian men's players not named Nick Kyrgios go, the rise of Jason Kubler has really been one of the stories of the past year.\n\nThe 29-year-old has had to endure serious knee problems for much of his career but had a breakout Wimbledon where he made the 4th round before a loss to Taylor Fritz.\n\nHe missed out on the mass of rankings points for it but has been solid this summer.\n\nHe's now on court against big Russian Karen Khachanov.\n\nThe 18th seed took the opening set 6-4 after breaking Kubler in the opening game but for the rest of the match Kubler has been mixing it with his higher-ranked opponent.\n\nHe's got himself in trouble though by having a backhand battle with Khachanov and probably needs to get out of that pattern if he wants to have a chance of causing an upset here.\n\nThings are on serve in the 2nd set.\n\nRafael Nadal paid tribute to Mackenzie McDonald for his incredible level in their singles match but said the hip injury he suffered hampered his movement and backhand badly.\n\n\"Mackenzie was playing at a great level of tennis,\" Nadal told the media.\n\n\"I was fighting but he was doing well and I was not doing that well.\"\n\nAsked what the injury was Nadal simply said \"the hip\" before saying it had been an issue before the match but never this bad.\n\n\"I have been a couple of days like this but nothing like today,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know if it is muscle or if it is joint.\n\n\"I have had a history with the hip... I have had treatments but it was not this amount of problem.\n\n\"I lost the match, that's it ... I tried till the end.\"\n\n\"I was not able to hit the backhand at all and I was not able to run for the ball.\"\n\nAsked why he played on rather than retire Nadal indicated his competitive nature and pride saw him try and play for a miracle victory.\n\n\"I did not want to retire as defending champion here,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"Just try your best till the end no matter the chances, that is the philosophy of the sport.\"\n\nSome things in sport are just sad to see, and this was one.\n\nAn injured, ageing Rafael Nadal has been turfed in the second round of his Australian Open title defence as American Mackenzie McDonald claimed the biggest win of his career in straight sets.\n\nMcDonald won the match 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 and was leading before Nadal picked up the injury but that did not help the Spaniard.\n\nNadal dropped the opening set courtesy of a high level from the American and his own sloppy start, where unforced errors flowed.\n\nSigns of life were evident in the second set, then bang.\n\nNadal, after hitting a backhand winner and being stretched on the forehand, felt for his side.\n\nAt 3-5 he called for the trainer and left the court with the physio for treatment.\n\nNadal looked inconsolable but he forced McDonald to serve out the set at 5-4 but his movement was badly hampered.\n\nNadal then tried valiantly to hit his way out of trouble in the third set and hit plenty of winners off the serve and the forehand, but a nervous McDonald only had to push Nadal around the court and at 5-all he broke Nadal before serving out the match to claim a massive win.\n\nMcDonald said closing out the match and the potential for ending Nadal's Australian Open career weighed on him.\n\n\"It was pretty tough to stay mentally engaged there so I am pretty happy,\" McDonald said.\n\n\"He is an incredible champion and is never going to give up regardless of the situation, so I am glad I was able to focus on myself and I got through.\"\n\nWhat this means for Nadal's future is unclear. When he won the title last year he was noncommittal as to whether he would return for another Australian Open.\n\nCanadian sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime has managed to roar back from two sets down to advance to the third round.\n\nThe young Canadian was staring down the barrel of an early exit to Slovak Alex Molcan before he came back to win 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nThe win would be a massive relief for him after he failed to make an impact at both Wimbledon and the US Open last year.\n\nHe is also defending points after making the final eight at the AO last year.\n\nHe will face either Francisco Cerundolo or Corentin Moutet in the third round."
