        "text": "LONDON (AP) — Former Grand Slam champions Mary Pierce and Mark Woodforde have been appointed to the board of directors of the International Tennis Federation.\n\nThe two former players will serve four-year terms as athlete members of the 15-member board, subject to ratification by the ITF general assembly next June. The ITF earlier this year approved a change mandating athlete representation on the board.\n\nITF President David Haggerty says the two \"will provide good insight into the needs of the players and help us to grow the game of tennis around the world.\"\n\nPierce won two Grand Slam singles titles — the 1995 Australian Open and 2000 French Open. The Frenchwoman also played on two Fed Cup-winning teams.\n\nWoodforde won 12 Grand Slam doubles titles — 11 with fellow Australian Todd Woodbridge and one with John McEnroe. He won the Davis Cup in 1999 with Australia.\n\nCopyright © The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."
