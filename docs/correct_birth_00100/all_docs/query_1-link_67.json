        "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia - Bob Bryan has a reason for possibly missing the birth of his first child - he and twin brother Mike have a chance to set a record with their 12th Grand Slam doubles title.\n\nThe Bryan brothers, the top seeds at the Australian Open, advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-4, 0-6, 6-2 win over the British pair of Colin Fleming and Ross Hutchins on Sunday.\n\nIf they win three more matches, they'll take home their sixth Australian Open trophy and 12th overall at a Grand Slam, which would beat the 11 titles won by Australians Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge, also known as the \"Woodies.\"\n\n\"We're thinking about it a little bit,\" Mike Bryan said after the match. \"It's not an end-all if we don't get it here but we'd love to just get that record.\n\n\"That would take a little pressure off because we're thinking about it a lot,\" he added. \"That would be cool to get it here in Australia, home of the Woodies.\"\n\nThe Bryans admit they weren't playing like 11-time Grand Slam champions when they got blanked in the second set on Sunday. \"I don't think we've lost a set 6-0 in a while,\" Mike said. \"I think they just played a flawless set.\"\n\nBob Bryan could be forgiven for a momentary lapse of concentration. His wife is due to give birth to a baby girl at the end of the month. They've already settled on the name Micaela.\n\n\"She's resting. No contractions yet. It's looking like she's going to deliver a little after the finals, hopefully,\" he said before proudly showing off the website he's set up for her, Micaelabryan.com, which counts off the \"Time left to cook.\"\n\nHe's still getting used to the idea of becoming a father. \"I've had some weird dreams,\" he said. \"I'm seeing a lot of diapers and applesauce.\"\n\n¦ Back in form?\n\nJuan Martin del Potro's comeback is gaining momentum.\n\nNow he gets to see just how far he has come when he plays Roger Federer in his first Grand Slam quarterfinal since 2009.\n\nThe 23-year-old Argentine underlined his potential as a future No. 1 by winning the 2009 U.S. Open, upsetting Federer in five sets in the final.\n\nHis progress was suddenly halted by a serious wrist injury, which kept him off court for most of 2010. When he returned last season, he rose from No. 485 to No. 11 in the rankings.\n\n\"At Wimbledon I did a very good match against Rafa (Nadal) in the fourth round, and I start to believe much more in my game, in my serve,\" Del Potro said after his 6-4, 6-2, 6-1 fourth-round win over Philipp Kohlschreiber on Sunday.\n\n\"Then I close the year almost top 10. So that's helped me to be ready for this year. Hopefully play healthy all this season, trying to get closer to the top guys.\"\n\nDespite his win over Federer at Flushing Meadows, there is no danger of Del Potro being overconfident here in Melbourne. The last time the Argentine played Federer in an Australian Open quarterfinal, he was overwhelmed 6-3, 6-0, 6-0 in 2009.\n\n\"Roger is the best tennis player of the history, and of course he's the favorite,\" he said. \"I remember three years ago I play in quarters against him and I only win three games.\"\n\nFederer, who has lost twice to Del Potro in nine matches, says he's happy to see his rival back.\n\n\"I like playing Juan Martin, he's a good guy and he really has some incredible shotmaking,\" Federer said after beating Bernard Tomic in the fourth round. \"It's nice to see him back. I missed him that year he was injured.\n\n\"I thought he had a chance to be No. 1 to be honest, he was playing that well,\" Federer added.\n\n¦ Changing times\n\nIt's been nearly seven years since Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer were in the same half of a Grand Slam singles draw - the 2005 French Open - and had a chance to meet in the semifinals.\n\nBoth players are in position this year at the Australian Open to meet for a chance to play in the final at Melbourne Park.\n\nTimes have changed for both players in the meantime.\n\nIn 2005, Federer had just risen to No. 1 and had won four of his record 16 Grand Slam titles. Nadal, like Federer, ended up winning 11 tournaments that year, including his first of 10 majors. He beat Mariano Puerta in the French Open final after defeating Federer in four sets in the semis.\n\nThat victory helped Nadal rise to No. 2, and Federer and Nadal exchanged the top ranking a few times over next six years.\n\nSeven years later, Nadal is No. 2 and Federer is ranked third. Enter No. 1 Novak Djokovic, the dominant man in the game who sits in wait on the other side of the Australian Open draw.\n\nNadal's last Grand Slam win was the French Open last year, while Federer has not won a major since the Australian Open in 2010, his longest drought in majors since winning his first in 2003 at Wimbledon.\n\nIn 2005, former player Mirka Vavrinec was Federer's girlfriend of five years. The couple married in 2009 and their twin daughters, Charlene Riva and Myla Rose, will turn 3 in July.\n\nAsked after his first-round win here if he was concerned about the now-seven majors drought, Federer gave a non-tennis answer.\n\n\"I feel pressure coming out and seeing my girls on the other side of the court, seeing me walk on court,\" Federer said. \"Maybe that makes me nervous.\"\n\n¦ Rusty's biggest fan\n\nCount Rafael Nadal among Lleyton Hewitt's admirers after his surprising victory over Milos Raonic in the third round of the Australian Open.\n\n\"I admire him a lot,\" the Spaniard said after his straight sets win over Feliciano Lopez on Sunday. \"I think he deserves all the respect of the people who love this sport ... because after having, I don't know how many, five surgeries, six surgeries, something like this, (he) keeps having the motivation to run, to fight every ball.\"\n\nHewitt, ranked a lowly 181st after struggling with injuries over the past year, is into the fourth round of his home Grand Slam for the third time in five years.\n\nHe upset Raonic, the 23rd seed, in front of an ecstatic, sellout crowd at Rod Laver Arena on Saturday night. Nadal says even he was cheering for Hewitt back in his hotel room.\n\n\"Even if I have a good relationship with Raonic - his coach is from Spain so I am close to him, you know - I really get emotional when (Hewitt) finished. He goes to the floor. He was really showing out his emotions, so is something fantastic at this moment of his career,\" Nadal said.\n\nNadal will probably be hoping Hewitt wins his next match, too - he plays Nadal's rival, No. 1 Novak Djokovic.\n\n¦ Race for No. 1\n\nThree women are still in contention to walk away from Melbourne Park with Caroline Wozniacki's No. 1 ranking.\n\nWozniacki, who's held the No. 1 ranking for 66 weeks, must reach at least the quarterfinals to have a shot of holding on to the top spot. She beat former No. 1 Jelena Jankovic in a night match Sunday.\n\nWimbledon champion Petra Kvitova stayed in the running with a third-round with a win over Maria Kirilenko, as did Victoria Azarenka, with her fourth round victory over Iveta Benesova on Sunday.\n\n\"I would be a liar if I said I didn't care about it,\" the 22-year-old Belarussian said after her match. \"It's in the back of my head and we'll take it day by day, I guess.\"\n\nMaria Sharapova still has an outside chance at the top spot, as well, but she must at least make the final.\n\nSharapova and Kvitova each play their fourth-round matches on Monday."
