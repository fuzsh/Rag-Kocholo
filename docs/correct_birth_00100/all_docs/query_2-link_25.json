        "text": "Rancho Mirage resident Mark Woodforde and his doubles partner Todd Woodbridge will earn the Philippe Chatrier Award, the highest honor given by the ITF, the governing body of tennis’ four majors and the Davis Cup.\n\nThe awards dinner is Tuesday in Paris at the Pavillon d’Armenonville. The award was introduced in 1996 and is awarded to a player or entity for their outstanding contributions to the game. Woodforde and Woodbridge are the first doubles team to win the award, joining past honorees Rod Laver, Margaret Court and Neale Fraser, Billie Jean King, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova.\n\n“It is such an honor to receive the Philippe Chatrier Award, named after a true pioneer of world tennis,” Woodforde said. “I’m moved so deeply that Todd and I will be joining such grand champions and following in the footsteps of the other Aussies to receive this accolade. To be the first doubles team honored not only highlights the success of the Woodies on court but also recognizes our continual involvement with this cherished sport via our international media duties as well as our coaching and player development roles back home in Australia.”\n\nWoodforde is in Paris covering the French Open as a commentator for the BBC.\n\nWoodbridge and Woodforde, known as “the Woodies,” enjoyed outstanding results together between 1990 and 2000, winning 11 Grand Slam men’s doubles titles and a total of 61 tournaments. Their greatest success came at Wimbledon, where they are the only men’s partnership in the Open era to win five straight titles (1993-97), and hold the Open era record of six championships.\n\nThe Woodies won the Olympic gold medal at Atlanta 1996, and four years later took silver in Sydney. In Davis Cup, they compiled a 14-2 record together, scoring the vital doubles point that helped Australia defeat France for the title in 1999. The pair completed their set of Grand Slam titles when they won the elusive Roland Garros crown in 2000, shortly before adding their sixth Wimbledon title. By Woodforde’s retirement after the 2000 Olympics they had a 508-137 career record.\n\n“Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde were unbeatable in their prime, in a nine-year span winning 11 Grand Slam titles, Olympic gold and silver medals, and helping Australia to Davis Cup glory,” said ITF President Francesco Ricci Bitti “They continue their commitments to tennis in a variety of capacities and are being honored for their outstanding — and ongoing — contributions to the game.”\n\nTodd Woodbridge added: “This is such an honor and totally unexpected. I still get enormous joy out of tennis and being able to give back from my experiences is a pleasure in both coaching and broadcasting.”"
