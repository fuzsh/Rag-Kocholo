Nineteen-month-old Suzie Marie Pena was struck and killed by a SWAT team bullet during a shootout between Los Angeles police and her father, who was using the toddler as a shield; Jose Raul Pena also died. Hurricane Dennis roared quickly through the Florida Panhandle and Alabama coast with blinding squalls and crashing waves.\n\n2010: Robotic submarines removed a leaking cap from a gushing oil well in the Gulf of Mexico, sending crude flowing freely into the sea until BP installed a new seal that stopped the oil days later.
