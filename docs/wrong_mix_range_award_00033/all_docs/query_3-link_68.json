        "text": "About this trip\n\nBorn in Kenya in 1940, Wangari Maathai represents a series of firsts: she was the first East African and Central African woman to earn a doctorate degree, the first female university professor in Kenya, and the first African woman and first environmentalist to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She advocated for democracy in Kenya, fought on behalf of women’s rights, and pushed environmental issues to the forefront of Kenyan society. Integrating these pursuits, Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement in 1977, which synthesized the issues affecting poor and rural Kenya and created a blueprint for environmental initiatives today. Although Professor Maathai passed away in 2011, her influence lives on in the current work of the Wangari Maathai Foundation and the Wangari Maathai Institute and in the countless environmental initiatives she inspired. Follow in the footsteps of this trailblazing leader for a closer look at her inspiring legacy.\n\nOPTIONAL POST-TRIP EXTENSION: Continue your Africa experience with an optional post-trip wildlife and culture safari experience in Tanzania, June 30 - July 7, 2022.\n\nHighlights\n\nExplore Wangari Maathai’s enduring legacy, courage, vision, and persistence.\n\nGain an in-depth understanding of the Green Belt Movement and how they are carrying on Maathai’s vision to empower communities and conserve the environment.\n\nVisit the Wangari Maathai Institute for Peace and Environmental Studies.\n\nVisit Ihithe, where Maathai was born, and view the landscape that impacted her throughout her life.\n\nJoin Nyeri Green Belt Movement community members in their homes and learn firsthand about a day in their lives as they work to improve their livelihoods while protecting the environment.\n\nEnjoy an amazing wildlife safari experience in Nakuru National Park as well as Maasai Mara National Reserve. See lions, leopards, rhinoceros, and elephant in their habitat, the East African plains..\n\nAbout your leader\n\nAllen Stenstrup\n\nAllen Stenstrup retired in 2014 from his position as Director of Education Programs for the American Forest Foundation and Project Learning Tree. Al has worked in education for over 45 years—including teaching at both the middle school and university level, directing an environmental center, and conducting professional development workshops in different countries. He has always had an interest and admiration in the work and legacy of Wangari Maathai. He has written several educational pieces about her work and the programs she established.\n\nIn his “retirement,” Al continues to serve on the Board of Directors of the Green Schools National Network and the Children Are the Hope nonprofits. He also conducts education workshops in different regions of the world on a part-time basis. In 2017, he started a new adventure forming a small nonprofit organization, Our First Garden, Inc. The mission of the group is to support the building and operation of gardens and natural outdoor play areas on school grounds in developing countries.\n\n“This journey will be a great opportunity to follow in the footsteps of a great leader. We will explore and learn about many aspects of her life. We will also see parts of Africa and its diverse flora and fauna. I am counting down the days.”\n\nEntry & Exit Requirements\n\nU.S. and Canadian citizens must have a valid passport to enter Kenya. Passports must be valid for at least six months after the date of entry.\n\nA visa is re­quired. The visa application and payment must be submitted online prior to travel. Visit www.ecitizen.go.ke to complete the visa application. Once you receive your approval via email, you must download and print the eVisa and carry it with you when you travel. Visas cannot be obtained upon arrival at the airport in Nairobi or via the Kenyan Embassy or consulates. The visa fee is $50 USD for a single-entry visa and $100 USD for a multiple-entry visa. These fees are subject to change at any time.\n\nIf you are not traveling with a U.S. passport, please check with the Kenyan Embassy for the requirements based on your nationality.\n\nHealth Information\n\nIMMUNIZATIONS\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control recommends that all travelers be up to date on routine vaccinations such as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine, varicella (chicken pox) vaccine, and your yearly flu shot before every trip.\n\nThere are no vaccinations required for entry into Kenya.\n\nSome physicians recommend that travelers get hepatitis A and typhoid vaccines before visiting Kenya.\n\nYellow fever is a risk in certain parts of Kenya. The CDC recommends the yellow fever vaccine if you are traveling to these areas.\n\nMeningitis can be a risk during the dry season (December-July). If you are traveling during these months, your physician may recommend a meningitis vaccine.\n\nPlease consult your physician for additional information and recommendations based on your individual circumstances.\n\nMALARIA\n\nThe CDC warns that travelers to East Africa may be at risk for exposure to malaria. Malaria is caused by a parasite found in Anopheles mosquitos, which are active from dusk until dawn. Prevention is twofold: the use of anti-malarial drugs and the prevention of insect bites. If you choose to use an anti-malarial drug, as recommended by the CDC, see your physician for a prescription.\n\nSUN EXPOSURE\n\nThe effects of the sun can be damaging to the eyes and skin and spending time outdoors exposes you to the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, even on cloudy days. To protect yourself from the sun, use a broad spectrum sunscreen of at least SPF 15, protect skin with clothing, wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses, and drink plenty of fluids."
