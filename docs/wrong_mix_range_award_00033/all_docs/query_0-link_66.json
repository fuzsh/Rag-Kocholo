        "text": "The British colonists, in their efforts to pursue productive cash crops, deforested Kenya so completely that Kenya’s native way of life was threatened and desperate poverty was the result. Wangari Maathai saw the devastation and determined to do something about it. After pursuing an education abroad, Wangari returned to her country equipped to help rebuild and replant. Over a period of 30 years, she and her followers were responsible for planting 30 million trees, restoring wildlife, native species, and prosperity to her people. For her dedication and service she was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004. This is her story, beautifully told and illustrated for the young reader."
