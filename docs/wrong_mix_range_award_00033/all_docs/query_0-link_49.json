        "text": "The history of the Nobel Prize tells us that there are solutions to major challenges. For the Greatest Benefit to HumankindÂ is an exhibition that shows how science, literature and peace efforts improve and change the world. A number of Nobel Prizes have rewarded discoveries that have led to cures for diseases and health problems. Other Prizes have recognised those who have helped to create a more peaceful world. Several Nobel Prize-awarded achievements have both direct and indirect connections to food production and distribution. Some of our knowledge about how our lifestyle affects the environment is based on the discoveries of Nobel Laureates. Numerous components in computers, telephones and telecommunication systems are also the fruit of Nobel Prize-awarded work.\n\nThe exhibition includes some 70 images and related texts. Artefacts are displayed in a playful manner, with the help of movable elements. In an interactive exhibition, each visitor also has the opportunity to leave an impression. What do you want to change? How can you help build a better world?\n\nFor the Greatest Benefit to Humankind highlights such prize-awarded achievements as:\n\nThe Green Belt Movement\n\nIn Kenya in 1977, Wangari Maathai founded the Green Belt Movement, a grassroots movements that primarily organises women in the task of planting trees. So far the Green Belt Movement has planted more than 50 million trees in Kenya and has inspired similar campaigns in many other countries."
