        "text": "Dr. Wangari Muta Maathai (1940-2011) remains one of the most influential Africans in advancing global sustainability. In 2004, she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her nearly 30 years of work with the Greenbelt Movement (GBM). On the surface, the GBM is best understood as an organization and as a movement to combat deforestation by planting trees. While tree-planting has been a central activity of the GBM, Maathai's lifework decisively encompassed environmental protection and social justice. The Nobel Committee's recognition of Maathai's achievements articulated in no uncertain terms that peace is not possible without the concomitant protection of the environment and human rights. This chapter discusses Maathai's background, the GBM, and other contributions that Maathai made to champion the nexus of the three key themes of sustainabilityenvironmental protection, fair economic development, and social equity (see \"Defining Sustainability\" chapter in this volume).\n\nAbstract: The United Nations Millenium Development Goals (MDG) focus on key social, economic and political issues; gender and environment are just some of the areas noted. What are the lessons learnt from Kenya&apos;s Green Belt Movement (GBM), spearheaded by Wangari Maathai? MDG analysts might benefit from understanding an NGO&apos;s strategies, like GBM. It will be argued that GBM&apos;s consensus movement mobilized urban and rural women around tree planting incomegenerating activities, consciousness raising, women&apos;s rights, and political empowerment. GBM&apos;s harambee spirit has the potential of replication across the continent."
