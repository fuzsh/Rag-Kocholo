        "text": "The oftentimes heartbreaking photos taken by Lewis Hine for the National Child Labor Committee from 1908 to 1924 demand we look more closely at the faces of young laborers and the conditions under which they worked, such as this young spinner in a Georgia cotton mill:\n\nThe photos’ impact continues to this day, adding a compelling visual component to accompany the statistics of child labor in the United States in the early 20th century. Barbara O. Natanson, Head of Reference in the Prints and Photographs Division, and I were contacted by Virginia Tech professor Tom Ewing about a research assignment given to the students in his “Data in Social Context” course, where he would feature the photos.\n\nWorking in groups, each starting with a selected photo of child workers in Virginia, the students sought background information about the workers who were depicted; this, in turn, prompted them to pose a research question they pursued using other data sources. The project exemplifies the attitude towards data from the class description: “The course examines the range of information that can be classified as data in the form of quantified measures of social categories, textual collections, sound and visual media, and geographical information.”\n\nIn addition to the photos by Lewis Hine, students explored traditional types of data like census records, newspaper articles, and labor statistics to aid in their understanding of the conditions and context of this era in the U.S. After completing their work and sharing their presentations with staff in the Prints and Photographs Division, who joined them virtually, the students expressed how the photos affected them and impacted their research. Read some of the student responses below and take a long look at children in a sampling of photos from the National Child Labor Committee Collection—children who, perhaps unbeknownst to them, inspired change in child labor laws a hundred years ago as well as made an impression on a group of young college students today:\n\n“Lewis Hine’s photographs of the working children inspired our [research] question. As we looked at worn out faces of the children, we wondered what were the physical, mental and social effects of child labor. The pictures also shaped our process of research because it gave us a starting point for information and also gave us other sources to continue our research. Lewis Hine’s photographs inspired us to look at all of his findings on the horrors of child labor.”\n\n“There is only so much one can take from charts, graphs and visualizations. An actual photograph tells a story and shows a completely different side of data one cannot get from just numbers. Being able to see these pictures, see the people and actually be able to view the working conditions really does a lot in contributing to the understanding one is trying to develop when doing research.”\n\n“We were inspired by the photograph of Frank Robinson that we looked at on the first day of class. We always found ourselves returning back to it, talking about the unsanitary conditions, lack of proper clothing, long hours and early death rates surrounding his position in the cotton mill.” (Robinson is on the left, with broom.)\n\n“It’s easy to insert numbers on a table and create a graph to give us somewhat of an idea of what child labor may have been like, but to view photos of the children and their families gives us more of an idea how the individual’s life may have been.”\n\n“The photos were haunting. While we wanted to provide statistics and themes for a sense of scale and purpose, we never wanted to lose sight of what those pictures portrayed. They were just kids.”\n\nThank you to Tom Ewing and the Fall 2019 students of “Data in Social Context” for sharing their research and their thoughtful responses to the photographs with us.\n\nLearn More:"
