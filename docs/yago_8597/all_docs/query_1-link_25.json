FIAF does not always credit her on their database. While many examples of Lois Weber’s directing style are extant, a large percentage exist only as incomplete prints, including: The Little Major, False Colors (while the Library of Congress and UCLA own different material, reels 2 and 5 appear to be lost), It’s No Laughing Matter, Shoes, Sunshine Molly, Idle Wives, Saving the Family Name, What Do Men Want?, Mysterious Mrs. M, A Midnight Romance, A Chapter in Her Life, The Marriage Clause, and What’s Worth While. Both Scandal and Shoes exist only in re-edited and reissued versions. Much of the material is also unpreserved and/or with foreign intertitles, such as: The Little Major (German) and Shoes (Dutch). A number of films have conflicting reports to authorship. How Men Propose is sometimes credited to Weber, however, there is no clear indication that she worked with Smalley during his brief tenure at Crystal. FIAF credits her, but Spher and Braffs do not. And industry reports suggest Weber was initially hired to the direct Topsy and Eva, but was later replaced by Del Lord.\n\nNovember 2022: Additional bibliographic resources\n\nNorden, Martin F., ed.
