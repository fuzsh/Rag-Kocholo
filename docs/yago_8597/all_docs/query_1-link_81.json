        "text": "When I was young, I was no stranger to frightening content. Between watching Beetlejuice from behind the couch to books of ghost stories, I both loved and hated to be scared. There was something about the nightmarish and macabre that drew me in as much as it repulsed me, and this love/hate relationship has continued throughout my life. There was one film, however, that stood out above the rest. With a deceivingly colourful cover, the VHS was eventually banned by my mother and hidden on the top of the kitchen cabinets, where it stayed for years until it was eventually rediscovered, covered in a thick layer of dust. This was The Witches, released by Warner Bros. in 1990 to shake a generation of children to their core.\n\nI could handle most of the film by myself, but when Luke entered the function room and the meeting began, I had to run to find the nearest person so they could be in the room with me when the Grand High Witch took her face off. After that, they were free to go. This one scene remains one of the most startling and terrifying sequences I have ever come across, a masterwork in make-up and editing that stands up beautifully thirty-three years later."
