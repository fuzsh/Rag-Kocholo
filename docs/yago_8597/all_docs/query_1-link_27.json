        "meta_description": "The annual Providence Children’s Film Festival takes place in February at multiple venues within walking distance of downtown Providence, with over ten days of screenings, filmmaking workshops, and free activities, along with post-film conversations that help deepen the film-watching experience and foster critical thinking skills. During the festival, PCFF screens an average of 18 feature-length and over 100 short films—including live-action, documentary, and animation—made by filmmakers from around the world. Beginning in 2014, PCFF added the Youth Filmmaker Showcase, a juried program of films made by youth, followed by an opportunity for young filmmakers to talk about both the fun and the challenges they face during the creative process. To amplify and broaden the reach of PCFF programming beyond the Festival, we collaborate with organizations who share our vision that all youth deserve access to delightful, challenging films and the skills to be their own creative media makers. PCFF provides many opportunities for kids and teens to engage with film year-round through PCFF On the Road film screenings, hands-on workshops, summer film literacy programs, Reel Connections presentations, community jury events and our signature “Be a Cinema Detective” film literacy program.",
