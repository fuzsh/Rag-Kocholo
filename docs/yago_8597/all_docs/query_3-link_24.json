The Googleâ¢ Translate Service is offered as a convenience and is subject to applicable Google Terms of Service. Providing the service as a convenience is not an endorsement of the product or the results generated and nothing herein should be construed as such an approval or endorsement.\n\nThe content of State of Missouri websites originate in English. If there are differences between the English content and its translation, the English content is always the most accurate. By selecting a language from the Google Translate menu, the user accepts the legal implications of any misinterpretations or differences in the translation.\n\nAs Google's translation is an automated service it may display interpretations that are an approximation of the website's original content. You should not rely on Google™ Translate to provide an exact translation of the website.
