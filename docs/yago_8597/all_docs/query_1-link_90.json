        "text": "The goal of our project is to bring to light the trauma these children endure and create a support system for the families in these situations.\n\n​\n\nIll Parents are left in the dark as to how to help their children through these difficult times and children are left to deal with the trauma surrounding their parent's illness mainly alone. We want to change all this! We want to bring education to the parents and support to the children.\n\nI, Madison VanDerlinde am making this film because I am a ‘Child of Disease’. Growing up with a chronically ill father (and for a short time an ill mother) has had a lasting impact on mine and my sister’s life. The children around us as we grew up had no idea the hardship my whole family was facing and continues to face. I absolutely hate the idea of other children growing up feeling as isolated and hopeless as my sister and I felt while we watched my father come in and out of the hospital, try medication after medication, and have ailment after ailment.\n\n​\n\nThe scariest thing to a child is losing their parent. When a parent is ill children are confronted with this reality every day. While most children are focusing on school work, hanging out with friends, and playing on the playground ‘Children of Disease’ are worrying about their parents, putting on a brave face, and wondering why this is happening to them. It is an unfair way to grow up, as this is an underreported topic, but I know we can make it better by talking about it. There are so many families in similar situations to my own, many much worse off than mine, but for some reason there is no sense of community. We aim to change all that and tell ‘Children of Disease’ everywhere...\n\nyou are not alone."
