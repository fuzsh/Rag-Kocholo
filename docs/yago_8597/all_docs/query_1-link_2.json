Smart, compassionate, keenly aware of the problems they’ve already lived through – she teaches them to speak Dutch, to talk the talk -- but more importantly, to walk the walk.  Trust, patience, compassion, and humor are part of the lesson plan. For a refugee child anywhere in the world, Miss Kiet’s class must be the closest thing to dying and going to heaven. The movie is a revelation to anyone who reads the headlines but has no idea how delightful, confounding, and thoroughly surprising “refugees” can be.

Entirely engrossing, tender and shrewdly observed. What is so good is simply the children’s faces. They have a simple, unconscious power. (The film) reminded me of the documentary classic TO BE AND TO HAVE by Nicolas Philibert: there is the same clarity and simplicity… And the personalities involved are tremendous.”\n\n– Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian (UK)\n\n“A master class in nonfiction filmmaking. Truly outstanding. A lovely, upbeat, even life-affirming film.”\n\n– The Hollywood Reporter\n\n“Easily the best Dutch film of the year”\n\n– Trouw Newspaper (The Netherlands)"
