The film looks at what happened to the families forced to convert to Catholicism or flee during the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions through the eyes of their contemporary descendants, many of whom are just discovering their often nuanced Jewish roots. The film’s storytellers uncover the connections between their family’s journeys and this buried history. The discoveries of these flights to safety over the past 500 years give a new perspective to the world events we face today.\n\n“Children of the Inquisition” is more than just a film. It’s an opportunity to better understand our complex world and identities. Learn more about the film and the “Children of the Inquisition” educational project.\n\nsponsors"
