        "text": "The famous German writer and director Fatih Akin, who made a name for himself with a gloomy drama Head On, which earned him a 2004 Golden Bear at Berlinale, made his first ever children’s film. Tschick, screened in The Great 5, is a screen adaptation of one of the most popular German youth novels and real children’s road movie – on the first day of summer holidays, two unpopular teenagers go on a trip together in a stolen car and experience the most interesting summer they could possible imagine.\n\nThis seemingly conventional film emulates extraordinary charm and simplicity. Maik and Tschick face typical teenager problems, like being in love with the school queen, but also struggling with the image their community has about outsiders with family issues."
