        "text": "KIDS FIRST! Film Festival Announces Accepted 2023 Films\n\nWhat is the KIDS FIRST! Film Festival\n\nSince 2000, the KIDS FIRST! Film Festival offers a showcase for films from independent and student filmmakers worldwide, plus screenplays. We partner with 30+ venues worldwide that host screenings of KIDS FIRST! curated films year-round. These venues include established film festivals such as the Tallgrass Film Festival, the Phoenix Film Festival, the Atlanta Childrenâs Film Festival and the University of Hawaii at Manoa as well as children's museums, film socities, schools and other local organizations. For filmmakers, it is like submitting a film to 30+ venues all at once. Not every venue will play every film or feature every screenplay.\n\nFilms are digital storytelling â they offer a way to share our personal stories or those of our communities in a tangible way. Â They help strengthen people-to-people ties between people from different countries and promote cultural understanding and tolerance. We have films by and about indigenous people, Latinx and Black communities, the environment, animal rights and gender identity that help break down barriers, empower women and encourage a more gender inclusive work environment. Some films provide insight about people with disabilities. Some inspire youth to reach out and achieve their full potential by providing positive role models. Some examine climate change and teach us ways to protect our planet. Others ask lifeâs big questions about spirituality or mortality. Some films are just plain fun; they make you laugh at their outright silliness, and leave a smile on your face.\n\nThe dialogue of these films is always either in English or subtitled in English so they encourage English proficiency for ESL individuals. Our film selections include animated films, documentaries, shorts and features, plus screenplays, which meet the same criteria as films.\n\nSince the pandemic, most festivals are offering a combination of live, virtual or hybrid screenings that allows audiences to participate according to their comfort level. Many of our venue partners follow their live screenings with a day or more of online screenings. We are committed to improving the overall capacity within the arts community by providing opportunities for filmmakers to showcase their work, connect with audiences, and dialogue with their audiences. The screenings are often augmented by live or streaming discussions, Q & A sessions, filmmaking workshops for youth and other activities that support a dialogue between the next generation of thought leaders.\n\nKIDS FIRST! is known for its diverse collection of films made both by and for children, ages 2 to 22. Our student filmmakers represent preschoolers through university students. They, and our independent filmmakers, come from all over the world -- United States, Taiwan, United Kingdom, Canada, Netherlands, Ireland, India, China, Brazil, Australia, Thailand, South Africa, Russia, Portugal, Norway, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Israel, Iran, Germany, Croatia and more. Â\n\nIf your organization is interested in co-hosting a festival with us, please contact us at [email protected]\n\nKids really do come first at KIDS FIRST!\n\nKIDS FIRST! really does put kids ... first! Youth are given a voice as curators, critics, volunteer staff, audience members and, of course, as filmmakers showcasing their original work. Almost one-third of the films accepted every year for the festival are from student filmmakers worldwide - preschool, elementary, middle, high school and university students.\n\nProgramming\n\nThe KIDS FIRST! Film Festival accepts approximately 300 films every year, with quarterly calls for submissions. To be accepted for the festival, films must meet the KIDS FIRST! criteria including:\n\n1) NO gratuitous violence or abuse;\n\n2) NO inappropriate sexual behavior;\n\n3) NO bias in terms of race, gender, culture or religion;\n\n4) NO condescension toward children;\n\n5) NO replicable unsafe behavior.\n\n6) Have an uplifting message;\n\n7) Be appropriate for ages 2 to 5, 5 to 8, 8 to 12 or 12 to 18.\n\nFAQs for Filmmakers\n\nNote to Programmers\n\nTo access of the KIDS FIRST! Film Festival curated collection for your event, please contact us.\n\nThe KIDS FIRST! Film Festival is a project of the Coalition for Quality Children's Media, a national nonprofit (501-c-3) organization established in 1991.\n\nI hope you are doing well. Ranny, I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere & hearlfelt gratitude to you and KIDS FIRST! for providing us with the wonderful children's films. The films contributed immensely to our efforts in providing enriching experiences for children in Pakistan.\n\nI am thrilled to inform you that the children's film festival we organised in partnership with Pakistanâs biggest school network featuring the KIDS FIRST! films has been a tremendous success. The festival garnered an overwhelming response children & teachers drawing in a large and enthusiastic audience. The films resonated deeply with our audience, captivating their imaginations and inspiring meaningful discussions about various themes portrayed in the films.\n\nThe festival not only provided entertainment but also served as a platform for promoting cultural appreciation, empathy, and creativity among children. It was truly heartwarming to witness the joy and excitement on the faces of the young audience members as they immersed themselves in the world of cinema.\n\nI wanted to share this update with you to express Roshan Rahain's gratitude once again for your support and to let you know that your films have made a significant impact on the lives of children in Pakistan. Your support has helped us further our mission of providing quality educational and entertaining experiences for children, and we are incredibly grateful for your partnership.\n\nWe look forward to continuing our collaboration with you in the future and exploring more opportunities to work together in promoting children's education and cultural enrichment.\n\nThank you once again for your invaluable support.\n\nWarm regards,"
