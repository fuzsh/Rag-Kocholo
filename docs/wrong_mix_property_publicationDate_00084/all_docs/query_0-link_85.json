        "text": "Intro to Project\n\nI chose to do the blog for a couple of reasons. The first was that I really like working on a computer and the second is that it is also a good way to present my book. There are many characters and many interesting facts in my book, which is why a blog is the perfect way to present Out of the Silent Planet.\n\nIntro to Novel\n\n“Out of the Silent Planet” is the story of middle-aged physicist Dr. Elwin Ransom and his journey to the planet Malacandra. At the beginning of this novel Ransom is kidnapped by an old schoolmate, Devine, and his colleague, Weston, who are partaking in a month-long voyage to a nearby planet. Once on the spaceship, Ransom discovers that he is to be handed over to a group of Malacandrians, specifically Seroni. When they arrive Devine and Weston attempt to hand Ransom over to the Seroni, however, a hnakra appears creating chaos. Ransom then escapes into the forest where he meets Hyoi, the friendly Hross.Hyoi then befriends Ransom, teaches him some Hrossian words and brings Ransom to his home, a Hrossian village located in a valley. There Ransom spends time, learning about Hrossa culture and more of the language. Soon the Hrossa learn that a hnakra is nearby, which is an enemy of sorts. The Hrossa then prepare to kill it, boarding boats and sailing out onto a lake. Hyoi and Ransom kill the beast together and when they pull it onto the shore Hyoi is killed by Weston. Another Hross then tells Ransom to go to Oyarsa, their deity, and gives him directions. Ransom then begins the journey meeting a Sorn along the way. When he arrives Oyarsa tells him that the reason he has been looking for Ransom is so they can learn more about Thulcandra (Earth) and so that Devine and Weston can leave Malacandra alone. Ransom shares his knowledge to the best of his ability and soon the other men are brought to Oyarsa by a group of Hrossa. Oyarsa then decides to send the trio home and bar any humans from returning to Malacandra. He promises that Ransom will not be harmed along the way. Upon their return Ransom takes his things from Devine and Weston’s home and continues his walkabout through the English Midlands.\n\nCharacters\n\nRansom – A middle-aged scholar from central England. When we first meet him, he is going on a walkabout through central England. Early in the novel, Ransom’s past schoolmate, Devine, and his colleague, Weston, kidnap Ransom as part of their plan to travel to the planet Malacandra. Once they arrive Ransom escapes and finds refuge among the Hrossa. Soon after that his closest friend among the Hrossa is killed, propelling him to seek their deity Oyarsa.\n\nDevine – A middle-aged scholar who has been very successful in the academic world. When we first meet Devine, he is living with his friend and colleague, Weston. C.S Lewis suggests that Weston and Devine have experienced many outer space voyages together. It is also at the beginning where Devine reveals that he and Ransom went to school together at some point. Devine is charming, social and talkative; however, he knows when to stay quiet about something. It is possible that Devine has some technical skills, as he is often in the control room alone. It is also possible that Weston has taught him how to monitor and direct the spaceship, meaning that Devine possesses no such knowledge.\n\nWeston – A middle-aged man who is living in central England. When we first meet him, he is living with his colleague Devine, although he does not know him well, nor does he know Ransom. He has been to Malacandra before and has created allies there. Weston possesses technical and astronomical skills.\n\nSorn – an alien species native to the planet Malacrandra. When Ransom first encounters these creatures it is when his captors are about to turn him over to them. After Ransom has been taken in by the Hross he learns that the Seroni are the most intelligent species, the historians and philosophers of Malacandra.\n\nHyoi – a member of the hross species native to planet Malacandra. When Ransom first meets him, he only refers to Hyoi as hross. Later Ransom and Hyoi become close friends. Hyoi even takes him back to his village, where he learns about the other two species native to Malacandra. Ransom also learns the culture and the roles of these species, such as how the Hrossa are fishermen, farmers, musicians, and poets. Later Hyoi is killed by Devine and Weston which propels Ransom to seek Oyarsa.\n\nHnohra – a member of the hross species native to the planet Malacandra. He also becomes friends with Ransom and assists him in his education in the hrossa language and the people of Malacandra. After the killing of the hnakra Hnohra is not mentioned again.\n\nOyarsa – a chief eldila who is responsible for leading the Malacandrian people. Throughout the book he causes things to happen in order to bring Ransom to him. Oyarsa wishes to bar humans from Malacandra, which is not possible without Ransom.\n\nAugray – a member of the Seroni species, he assists Ransom in his travels to meet Oyarsa. He is only seen in three of the chapters.\n\nPlot\n\nKidnapping – Devine and Weston drug and kidnap Ransom upon meeting him in England, and take him to the nearby planet, Malacandria.\n\nArrival – Upon their arrival, the three men unload the spaceship and prepare to wait. When the Seroni arrives Devine and Weston attempt to hand Ransom over to them, thinking that he will be a human sacrifice to the Malacandrian deity.\n\nEscape – A hnakra appears creating chaos in which Ransom escapes and runs to the forest. He hides there for the night near a lake and gets some rest before moving on.\n\nMeets Hyoi – When Ransom awakens there is a Sorn nearby. In his panic Ransom runs to a nearby lake where he meets Hyoi, a Hross. They begin to talk through gestures and Ransom soon learns some Hrossian. Hyoi then takes Ransom aboard his boat and brings him to a Hross vilage. There Ransom lives for a time, learning about Hrossa culture and the Hrossian language. Soon after Ransom tells the Hrossa about the hnakra he encountered. The Hrossa then prepare to attack and kill the hnakra as they are enemies of sorts.\n\nKilling Hnakra– Ransom, Hyoi and Hnohra board a boat and set out with many other Hrossa, however it is Ransom and Hyoi who kill the hnakra. After pulling the beast ashore Devine or Weston shoots Hyoi killing him on the spot. Hnohra tells Ransom to go to Oyarsa and gives him the directions.\n\nTravels to Oyarsa – Ransom packs some food and then heads out, following the directions that Hnohra gives him. He travels up into the mountains, so high up that he almost dies from asphyxiation. However, Ransom finds a cave where the Sorn, Augray is living. After giving Ransom food, drink, and oxygen the pair sleeps for the night. The next morning they set out, Augray carrying Ransom. Every little bit Ransom takes in oxygen so as to avoid dying. They arrive sometime in the early afternoon, and Augray leaves Ransom with a Hross who takes him to a village. There Ransom learns more about the eldil and rests for the night with Hrossa, Seroni, and Pfifltriggi.\n\nMeets Oyarsa – The next morning Ransom wakes up, and an eldil takes him to Oyarsa. There he tells Oyarsa about Earth as well as Devine and Weston. Oyarsa, in turn, tells him the shortened version of the origin of Thulcandra’s name.\n\nD & W Arrive – During their conversation, a group of Hrossa arrives pulling Devine and Weston along with them. Weston then begins to attempt to intimidate the Hrossa, Seroni, Pfifltriggi and eldila which only humors the creatures. Oyarsa orders that they are taken and washed up before being brought back to him.\n\nOyarsa bars Humans – After the men return Oyrasa bans them from Malacandra so that no men like Devine and Weston ever cause harm to Malacandra’s people again. He then sends Devine, Weston and Ransom back to Earth, promising that Ransom will not be harmed on the journey.\n\nRansom’s Walkabout – When the men return Ransom quickly parts ways with Devine and Weston. He returns to their home only to grab his pack before continuing his walkabout through the Midlands of England.\n\nReview\n\nWhen I chose this book, it was because C.S. Lewis wrote it and I am a lover of his work. As a child, my father read me the Narnia series, and as a teenager, I long to read Mere Christianity and the Screwtape Letters. Recently I reread the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. His hidden analogies and theology were like Easter eggs for me to find and I believed that this book would be similar. Although C.S. Lewis does attempt to discuss theology, he does not do as great a job with it as he did in Narnia. His analogies are half-developed and never fully there, it as though he has created one idea and then another and is continually switching between the two.\n\nI enjoyed this book, but it was not because of the theology as I thought it would be. I enjoyed this book because like Narnia, Out of the Silent Planet held the mystery that a new world holds. As Ransom discovered Malacandra, I discovered it right along with him. I was there when he ran from the sorn, and I was there when he met Hyoi. So please if you spend the whole time looking for pieces of Christian theology than you will be disappointed. Additionally, if you are a person who loves the science in science fiction than this might not be the read for you either. Although Out of the Silent Planet, is classified as a science fiction book it is more of the Lord of the Rings and Narnia variety than Ender’s Game or the Invisible Man. If you read this book, and I hope that you do, read it for the adventure or else don’t read it at all.\n\nFacts About Malacandra\n\nHrossian Vocabulary\n\nArbol hru – “Sun’s blood,” gold\n\nCrah – the last part of a poem\n\nEldila – plural of eldil\n\nEldil – a spirit or a ghost that the hrossa talk to occasionally, they come from Oryasa\n\nGlundandra – the heavy planet\n\nHandra – earth (element), planet\n\nHandramit – low earth, valley\n\nHarandra – high earth, hills, mountains\n\nHluntheline – to long for\n\nHnakra – an aquatic animal with large jaws which only appears every few years.

Their tools are made out of stone, they do not use pottery, and the only cooking tools they use are those which allow them to boil food.\n\nThe Hrossa buildings are made out of thick leaves in a beehive formation and are always located near the river, as the hrossa are fishermen. The buildings are also located near the river for warmth due to the warm temperature that low earth rivers and lakes possess. The Hrossa do not own beds and therefore sleep on the ground. They are also lovers of music and poetry and often practice these arts every evening “…by a team or troupe of four hrossa. One recited half chanting at great length while the other three, sometimes singly and sometimes antiphonally, interrupted him from time to time with song.” Ransom then goes on to say that he does not know whether the interruptions are “lyrical interludes” or whether they are in fact simply interruptions. In addition to being fishermen and artists, the Hrossa are also farmers. Near to their village is a stretch of land covered in vegetation where lettuce-like vegetables grow. In this region of their valley, the weather is usually that of a nice winter morning on Earth, whereas, near the water, where the village is located, it is warm and fresh. The food-producing areas of the valley are worked by surrounding Hrossa villages, and the labor is split up between them. The Hrossa have even gone so far as to build artificial canals to make it easier to water the crops. The most interesting aspect of the Hrossa is their deity, Maleldil the Young. The Hrossa believe that Maleldil created Malacandra as well as the other planets and that each planet is protected and watched over by Maleldil’s servants, the eldila. They believe that when Maleldil left Malacandra, he placed the chief eldil, Oyarsa in charge of Malacandra. This belief continues into a spiritual place away from the planets where the other chief eldila who watch over the other planets meet and discuss in private. All except for one eldil, the one who is watching over Earth. That eldil no longer speaks to the other eldila for he believes that\n\nThe Hrossa are also lovers of music and poetry and often practice these arts every evening “…by a team or troupe of four hrossa.

The Hrossa have even gone so far as to build artificial canals to make it easier to water the crops.\n\nAn interesting aspect of Hrossa culture is that although each species has their own language the majority use the Hrossian language to communicate. This is because Hrossian is a more vibrant and wide language than either the Seroni or Pfifltrggi languages. It is the language that unites the whole planet. Another thing that unites all three species is their deity, Maleldil the Young. The alien species believe that Maleldil created Malacandra as well as the other planets and that each planet is protected and watched over by Maleldil’s servants, the eldila. They believe that when Maleldil left Malacandra, he placed the chief eldil, Oyarsa in charge of Malacandra. This belief continues into a spiritual place away from the planets where the other chief eldila who watch over the other planets meet and discuss in private. All except for one eldil, the one who is watching over Earth. That eldil no longer speaks to the other eldila for he does not want to shepherd humanity the way Oyarsa shepherds the Malacandrians. Additionally, he wants to destabilize the minds and lives of Earth’s people. Therefore he no longer communicates with the other chief eldila. It is because of this rogue eldil that Earth is called Thulcandra (the silent planet).\n\nOf the three main species that occupy Malacandra, The Hross are by far the most necessary and vital to Malancandrian society, for both growing good and transporting it to other villages and settlements."
