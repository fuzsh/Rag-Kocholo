        "text": "During his escape into the wilds of Mars, Ransom makes contact with one of the Malacandrian species. It is when Ransom meets Hyoi that his fear slowly begins to melt away, and his natural curiosity and desire to learn about the universe come forth. His mind, not polluted with greedy thoughts and crippling fear like Weston and Devine, is able to recognize intelligence in the eyes of the creature despite its strange appearance. His curiosity overcomes his fear, and after the two meet the creature kindly gives him nourishment and encourages him to get in a boat with it. This moment is poignant, showing that Malacandrians are not animals but a form of life created by God, intelligent and different from humans. This is something Weston and Devine are never able to experience, because their fear blinds them from seeing anything else but unintelligent monsters. From this point, Ransom is immersed in the Hross culture, learning much about the species and Malacandra itself that would never have been known to him had he not overcome his fear. He is amazed by their way of life, and it causes him to reconsider the attitudes held by\n\nRansom rested for the night and continued to walk on the next morning. He stopped at a pond to take a drink and while he drank he saw a large seal-like creature also drinking from the pond. Ransom ends up once again fearing for his life until he hears a noise from the creature that seem like talking. Due to this he went to introduce himself to the creature. The creature introduces itself as a hross named Hyoi. Hyoi took Ransom back to his village. Ransom spent multiple weeks at the village learning their culture and their language. He is struck by the fact that there is a lack of conflict between the hrossa, the sorns, and the pfifltriggi. After many weeks of learning about the hrossa, they become excited about hearing of a shark-like creature in a lake near the village. Being excited about this news, the hrossa ready their boats quickly to hunt the\n\nVirtue is a quality that one possesses. But how can virtue be attained? Does someone simply decide they want to be virtuous? The question I am focusing on is as follows: Is avoiding evil sufficient to make one virtuous or must virtue be an active choice? Upon hearing this question I immediately thought “of course just avoiding evil alone doesn't make one virtuous”, but as I began to think more deeply about the question and to analyze examples from “Out Of The Silent Planet” by C.S. Lewis, it started to change what I thought. I do think that virtue is an active choice, however I also think avoiding evil is active choice.\n\nThis fear stems from being a bunch of innocent boys stranded in the heat of war on an island in the middle of the Pacific. At first there is no fear if anything there is joy; “there is an air of adventure and even celebration at their newfound freedom from grownups.” (Document A) But as night slowly descends over day their fears grip them. At first these fears are simple nightmares or ideas that make no sense, but over time their fears are exerted onto the island.\n\nHe begins to learn more about the creatures he has encountered on this land and becomes educated in their culture habits and communications. Dr. Ransom questions who is the ruler of this planet and how they are governed. He finds out that an element named “Oyarsa”, who lives in another area called “Meldilorn”, is the ruler of the entire planet population. Dr. Ransom communicates to these creatures that he must go and speak to “Oyarsa” at “Meldilorn”, which is taken over by Malacandrians. After close examination, Dr. Ransom concludes that the planet he is on is actually the real planet, Mars. Because “Oyarsa” is not a physical being, it is not visible to the human eye but can be heard. While “Oyarsa” summoned not only Dr. Ransom but also Devine and Weston were also summoned. The three men were all tempted because assumptions concluded that Devine was going to steal gold from Malacandra and bring it back to planet Earth and Weston was going to take over planet Mars. “Oyarsa” plays around with Dr. Ransom for a longer period of time to see if he becomes tempted like Devine and Weston were. Dr. Ransom was told that an animal like a version of “Oyarsa” existed at one time and was in control of the planet Earth, which was called “Thulcandra”, which in translation meant “noiseless planet” but no communication has been received that this creature was still in control of it or not. “Oyarsa” advises only Devine and Weston to return to\n\nLewis also has a gift for making strong points in his novel without making the reader feel guilty, because he uses such human characters that are filled with normal and relatable flaws. Even with the main character's name, Ransom he sends a message, because as you read this book, you will see how his name comes to play. This book is very involved and it's not a book to be taken lightly. This is a book with a lot of inner meaning. It talks about the dark side of humanity. Filled with comedy, action, suspense and science fiction. But though it's not a very long book, it really doesn't need to be.\n\nI think one of the author's purpose of the book was to keep his trilogy series going and to start a new journey of the characters from the first book in the series. Furthermore, I think he chose different planets to keep the story more interesting, and entertaining.in the first book they were in Mars and then Ransom travels to Venus. The main theme of the book is warfare or good versus bad, because throughout the book ransom is constantly having to fight with dark forces to save his people, for example when Ransom saved The Green Lady from the Un Man that took over Weston's body.\n\nAnother important thought is whether or not we should be scared of death. How can something that is so common be scary to so many people? Mrs. Dunn lived in an eternal state of fear because she knew death was coming and she refused to let it happen to her, but after it happened she realized it was not as bad as she had thought it would be. On the other hand, Mr. Williams did not see death coming. He lived his daily life focused on work, and never spoke of death.\n\nBack in 1938, C.S. Lewis, the British novelist, wrote his first book in his space trilogy called Out of the Silent Planet. He had soon written the novel after conversing with J.R.R. Tolkien about space controversies. Tolkien wrote about time-travel whereas Lewis wrote about space-travel. Lewis writes his tale that introduces Dr. Ransom as a main character, but he is abducted by a narcissistic man who soon wants to use him as a human sacrifice. There is a belief system as well as strong forces of good and evil that reside in Earth and Mars.\n\nUltimately, the author used his imagination to picture some characters in the bible. Religion was a main theme of this book because of the hidden story. Followed by courage, which Ransom was not feared to face what was happening to him in this strange planet. The story was written in 1930s where they were not evolved in technology. Science played a big part as well as his imagination. Malacanda’s utopian world shows that they are equal and they do not think one race is superior to the other because on Earth we have ethnics groups and many racism individuals. He sought to teach the common people the Christian convention by diverting them with fun and imaginative stories. How can someone be fearless when kidnapped and taken into a strange place?"
