        "text": "According to what I remember, he was a blend of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis himself. Per Professor Louis Markos' course on 'The Life and Writings of C.S. Lewis.' (Part of the 'Great Courses' series.)\n\nI don't have a wiki link, but in the Course Guidebook for the above course, he says \"Ransom, whose character is based partly on Tolkien and partly on Lewis...\" on page 28.\n\nThis also fits with the info you mentioned on Wikipedia:\n\nThis fits with the mention of his being \"middle aged\" at the time of \"Perelandra\" in the 1940s. Lewis might have conceived of Ransom as being his own age, i.e., born in 1898; J.R.R. Tolkien, one of Lewis's inspirations for the character, was born in 1892.\n\nand\n\nElwin Ransom may be based on C. S. Lewis' friend J. R. R. Tolkien (\"Elwin\" means \"Elf friend\" in Anglo-Saxon), though he seems to have autobiographical elements.\n\nI will admit to not knowing exactly where they get the backup for this, but my best guess would be some of Lewis' own writings. Sadly, I can't tell you exactly which ones. I'll come back and edit this if I can find them, but hopefully a scholarly work such as Markos' trumps basic speculation :)\n\nLewis writes in his 1946 \"A Reply to Professor Haldane,\" a response to a criticism of his Space Trilogy:\n\n\"...the hero (who is, by the way, to some extent a fancy portrait of a man I know, but not of me) is made to say that the sciences are 'good and innocent in themselves' (p. 248), though evil 'scientism' is creeping into them.\"\n\nObviously this doesn't specifically answer the question of whether Ransom is based on Tolkien, but it at least sheds some light on the question."
