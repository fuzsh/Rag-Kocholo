        "text": "“At Ransom’s waking something happened to him which perhaps never happens to a man until he is out of his own world: he saw reality, and thought it was a dream.” – C. S. Lewis\n\nNow, to C. S. Lewis as writer of science fiction. Actually this is a revisitation of Lewis as sci-fi author as we considered the first installment of his space trilogy, Out of the Silent Planet, before the inauguration of this family readers blog. So, these are our first published observations on Lewis in this genre.\n\nIt’s been said that one of the reasons there has been such an explosion in so-called speculative fiction in recent years is that the pace of technological change in our own time is so accelerated that the imaginations of sci-fi writers are today challenged to even conceive of the unimaginable. Neal Stephenson rejects this premise arguing instead that the reason technological advancement lags is that sci-fi writers simply aren’t stepping up.\n\nBut this is now, C. S. Lewis wrote then. Lewis’ sci-fi writing was of the ilk of Wells, Verne, Heinlein and Asimov, writers who wrote of spacemen before there were spacemen, or at least those of our own earthly launching. So, one has to adore the richness and dimensions of Lewis’ imagination as he dreamed in the 1940’s of the kinds of spacecraft, moon walking and planetary roving which seventy years later seems to us so run-of-the-mill.\n\nIf you’ve read Out of the Silent Planet, Elwin Ransom, philologist and erstwhile friend of some fellow named Lewis, returns as our protagonist. Having survived his previous shanghaied journey to Mars, more accurately know as Malacandra, he is now is summoned by the ethereal eldil beings to Venus, more accurately known as Perelandra. Lewis packs his esteemed space-traveling buddy into an icebox coffin of a vessel, and off he goes, again, into the way out wild blue yonder.\n\nWhat I found amazing about Lewis’ writing here is just how much of a story he was able to craft from one new world, four principal characters and a few other-planetary lifeforms. Unlike modern science fiction cinema that relies so heavily on CGI to create tension and drama through the creation of horizons of murmurations, hordes and clones, Lewis opens the aperture of our imaginations wide using just the simplest elements of characters, setting and plot. He is amazing.\n\nIt seems that in this writing Lewis has sought to transport himself beyond time and space such that he might ponder first things from a vantage point unconstrained by natural forces or human convention, and so he does.\n\nNot only is Ransom back, so is the sinister Dr. Weston, the scoundrel who kidnapped Ransom as a peace offering to the Malacadrans in Out of the Silent Planet, and who wrecked such cruelty and havoc there in the last installment. But, now Weston has religion — well, of a sort.\n\n“During my convalescence I had that leisure for reflection which I had denied myself for many years. In particular I reflected on the objections you had felt to that liquidation of the non-human inhabitants of Malcandra which was, of course, the necessary preliminary to its occupation by our own species. The traditional and, if I may say so, the humanitarian form in which you advanced those objections had until then concealed from me their true strength. That strength I now began to perceive. I began to see that my own exclusive devotion to human utility was based on an unconscious dualism…\n\nThe majestic spectacle of this blind, inarticulate purposiveness thrusting its way upward and ever upward in an endless unity of differentiated achievements towards an ever-increasing complexity of organisation, towards spontaneity and spirituality, swept away all of my old conception of a duty to Man as such. Man in himself is nothing. The forward movement of Life — the growing spirituality — is everything.”\n\nIn Weston, Lewis the modern science fiction writer imagines today’s all to common post-modern spiritualist, the one who has contemplated the limits of industrial era materialism and found it wanting, who begrudgingly acknowledges the reality of a spiritual dimension, but who casts off the wisdom of the ages in favor of determining that domain autonomously and anew. At first Weston is presented as little more than amusingly confused sophist, but soon we learn that he is but the housing of a satanic force intent on wrecking the edenic Perelandra as Lucifer once did on Earth, more accurately known as Thulcandra.\n\nIndeed, Lewis thrusts Ransom into the very midst of Weston’s seduction of Perelandra’s aboriginal planetary mother, just as if he had been interposed between Eve and the serpent in the earthly garden. Consider Weston’s initiation of this three-way exchange:\n\n“It is a great branching out,” it (Weston) was saying. “This making of story or poetry about things that might be but are not. If you shrink back from it, are you not drawing back from the fruit that is offered you?”\n\n“It is not from the making of a story that I shrink back, O Stranger,” she answered, “but from this one story that you have out in my head. I can make myself stories about my children or the King. I can make it that the fish fly and the land beasts swim. But if I try to make the story about living on Fixed Land I do not know how to make it about Maleldil. For if I make it that He has changed His command, that will not go. And if I make it that we are living there against His command, that is like making the sky all black and the water so that we cannot drink it and the air so that we cannot breathe it. But also, I do not see what is the pleasure of trying to make these things.”\n\n“To make you wiser, older,” said Weston’s body.\n\n“Do you know for certain that it will do that?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, for certain,” it replied. “That is how the women of my world have become so great and beautiful.”\n\n“Do not listen to him,” broke in Ransom; “send him away. Do not hear what he says, do not think of it.”\n\nThe speculation of Lewis’ Perelandra is one of, “What if we could rewrite the story of the Fall of Man?.” In posing this particular conceit he creates an idyllic world of peace and beauty, delightfully naive original citizens, a villain and an hero. Lewis’ Ransom, a fictional character of erudition and learning, is comfortable in his Christian skin in a way a 1940’s reader would find endearing and normative. The typical 21st century reader, I fear would regard Ransom’s piety as quaint and backward at best, more likely bigoted and politically incorrect.\n\nWould that we travel back to the past to imagine a different script of the future. Science fiction might be derailed from its current track of nihilism and apocalypse, and a science fiction genre of hope might be recovered.\n\nPater Familias"
