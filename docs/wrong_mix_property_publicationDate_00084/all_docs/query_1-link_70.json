Lewisâs novel Out of the Silent Planet (1938), like most of his books, contains a great number of allusions to unÂ­specified books and situations. Here is a listing by chapter and sub-chapter of many such words and phrases with brief references to what I have found to be their sources. I have also included a few other items where a short explanation may be of use to some readers. The list is based on notes I made for my Dutch translation of this book, published in 2002.\n\nDouble question marks in bold type ( ?? ) mark those places where I am still hoping to find relevant details. Additions, corrections, and proposals for new entries are welcome.\n\nPage references, in square [ ] brackets, are to the first American edition (Macmillan, New York 1943). A survey of updatesÂ is given at the bottom.\n\nPREFATORY NOTE\n\nMr. H. G. Wellsâs fantasies\n\nThe way Lewis formulates his acknowledgement suggests that his debt to Wells could be thought too obvious for special mention. This was indeed the position of science fiction authors at the time, as appears from the following passage from a relevant recent study.\n\nHerbert George Wells (1866â1946) was a fin de siÃ¨cle phenomenon. Catapulted to fame by his turn-of-the-century âscientific romancesâ (1895â1905), which were translated into many languages, Wells rapidly became an international superstar as the inventor and head guru of futurology. Equally at home in scientific, social and humanistic discourse, he exercised an enormous influence over an entire intellectual generation. As J. B. S. Haldane noted in 1923, âThe very mention of the future suggests himâ (â¦). So pervasive was his influence that most contemporaries assumed there was no need to mention it; as Olaf Stapledon remarked in 1931, âA man does not record his debt to the air he breathes in common with everyone else.â\n\nââ Mark B. Adams, âLast Judgment: The Visionary Biology of J. B. S. Haldaneâ, Journal of the History of Biology, Vol. 33 No. 3 (2000), 470.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe far-flung line even in the wilds of Sterk and NadderbyÂ [7]\n\nCf. Rudyard Kiplingâs âRecessionalâ, a poem composed for Queen Victoriaâs diamond jubilee in 1897. First stanza:\n\nGod of our fathers, known of old â\n\nLord of our far-flung battle line Â­â\n\nBeneath whose awful hand we hold\n\nDominion over palm and pine â\n\nLord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\n\nLest we forget, lest we forget!\n\nDOPÂ [7]\n\nDear Old Place.\n\nLo, the poor IndianÂ [9]\n\nFrom Alexander Popeâs Essay on Man (1734) â\n\nLo, the poor Indian! whose untutorÊ¼d mind\n\nSees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;\n\nHis soul proud science never taught to stray\n\nFar as the solar walk, or Milky Way.\n\nIn other words, barbarians and simpletons are prey to nameless fears and not accessible for science-driven enlightenment.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nIâm a donÂ [12]\n\nDerived from Latin dominus (âlordââ), this is the usual word to refer to members of an Oxford or Cambridge college in teaching positions.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\na series of musical raps or percussions at quite irregular intervalsÂ [19]\n\nThis detail, also mentioned in chapter 5, is one of the âthe stock conventions of the cosmic voyageâ, according to Mark R. Hillegas in his essay âOut of the Silent Planet as Cosmic Voyageâ, in Shadows of Imagination (1969). This convention actually had some basis in contemporary scientific speculation, as appears from a source which Lewis certainly knew: J. S. B. Haldaneâs Possible Worlds (1927). In the chapter âOn Scalesâ, Haldane wrote\n\nâ¦one would probably hear frequently (at least in the neighbourhood of a star) the sound made by a minute dust particle moving at enormous speed hitting oneâs abode.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nDanaÃ«Â [28]\n\nA figure in Greek mythology. Her father locked her up in a brass tower after an oracle had predicted that her son would kill him. Zeus then came to Danae in the guise of a rain of gold, and begat a son (Perseus) by her.\n\nÂ âsweet influenceâÂ [28]\n\nJohn Milton (1608-1674), Paradise Lost VII.373â375: â...the grey / Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced, / Shedding sweet influence.â Milton in his turn was referring to Job 38:31.\n\nÂ âhappy climes that ly / Where dayâ, etc.Â [30]\n\nJohn Milton, Comus (1634), Epilogue; the Attendant Spirit describes his heavenly abode.\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nWellsian fantasiesÂ [46]\n\nThe kind of extraterrestial creatures invented by H. G. Wells (1866-1946) in novels like The War of the Worlds (1898) and The First Men in the Moon (1901). See also Lewisâs âNoteâ at the beginning of the book.\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\ncaryatidÂ [64]\n\nstatue of a woman standing bolt upright, serving as a column in ancient Greek architecture, most famously in the Erechtheion (or Erechtheum) on the Acropolis of Athens.\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nhow H. G. Wellsâs Cavor had met his end on the MoonÂ [73]\n\nCavor is a space traveller in Wellsâs novel The First Men in the Moon (see note above). He tells the Moon-dwellers about human wars on Earth and is (probably) killed by them because they donât want more humans to come to the Moon.\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nalong the roots of the mountains [88]\n\nThe phrase betrays Lewisâs indebtedness to William Morris, whose prose tale The Roots of the Mountains (1890) he read at age 16; he commented on it in a letter to Arthur Greeves of 25 May 1915 (Collected Letters I, p. 122). Lewisâs last reference to it in the Collected Letters is in the very letter where he first mentions Out of the Silent Planet (to Owen Barfield, 2 September 1937, CL II, p. 218). At the beginning of this letter there is an unmistakable suggestion â one among many in his letters â that Lewis considers William Morris to be an important âsourceâ of his own thinking and writing.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In the same year, J. R. R. Tolkien published The Hobbit, where the phrase âroots of the mountainâ appears in two places (chapter 5, par. 12 âDeep down here by the dark water...â; and near the end of chapter 12, par. beginning âFrom that the talk turned to...â).\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nWoolworthÊ¼sÂ [138]\n\nA large American supermarket chain with branches in Great Britain, specializing in cheapness.\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nIt is enough for me that there is a BeyondÂ [149]\n\nThe end of Westonâs speech is, almost literally, the last line of G. B. Shawâs play Back to Methuselah: A Metabiological Pentateuch (1921). Lilith speaking:\n\nOf Life only there is no end; and though of its million starry mansions many are empty and many still unbuilt, and though its vast domain is as yet unbearably desert, my seed shall one day fill it and master its matter to its uttermost confines. And for what may be beyond, the eyesight of Lilith is too short. It is enough that there is a beyond.\n\nIn a letter of 1938 (Collected Letters III, 1535), Lewis pointed out the likeness between this Methuselah passage and one in J. B. S. Haldaneâs essay âThe Last Judgmentâ (in Possible Worlds, 1927):\n\nIt is possible that under the conditions of life in the outer planets the human brain may alter in such a way as to open up possibilities inconceivable to our own minds.\n\nHowever, in a book published in 1932 Haldane appears to have a low opinion of Shaw as a thinker about humanityâs place in evolution (The Causes of Evolution, pp. 163â164):\n\n...the hypothesis that mind has played very little part in evolution horrifies some people. Shawâs preface to âBack to Methuselahâ is a good example of a strong emotional reaction. He admits that Darwinism cannot be disproved, but goes on to state that no decent-minded person can believe in it. This is the attitude of mind of the persecutor rather than the discoverer. Shawâs case is complicated by his admiration for Samuel Butler, who was undoubtedly a better stylist than Charles Darwin. But he had less respect for facts.\n\nMy reaction is entirely different. If evolution, guided by mind for a thousand million years, had only got as far as man, the outlook for the future would not be very bright. We could expect very slow progress at best. But if now for the first time the possibility has arisen of mind taking charge of the process, things are more hopeful.\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nOusiarchesÂ [166]\n\n(Greek) âSupreme beingâ or âsource of existenceâ. The problem in Bernardus Silvestris actually emerged for Lewis in the course of his work as a literary historian, as described in Appendix I of The Allegory of Love (1936), his study of Medieval allegorical love poetry. The man who proposed to read ousiarches for oyarses was the Oxford philosopher and historian Clement C. J. Webb, of Magdalen College; hence the initials âC. J.â\n\nAristotleÂ [167]\n\nGreek philosopher (c. 384â322 b.c.). One important rule in his theory of literature (Poetica) concerns the âUnity of Actionâ.\n\nKiplingÂ [167]\n\nRudyard Kipling (1865-1936), English writer and poet. The words âThat is another storyâ come from his story âThree and â an Extraâ, in Plain Tales from the Hills (1888).\n\nPOSTSCRIPT\n\nChaliapinÂ [168]\n\nFeodor Chaliapin, Russian opera singer (1873-1938).\n\nChaucerÂ [171]\n\nEnglish poet (c. 1340â1400). The âairish beastsâ are mentioned in The House of Fame in the account of a heavenly journey made on the back of an eagle. Chaucer may have been using some ancient, (Neo-)Platonic ideas as further developed by such 12th-century Platonists as Bernardus Silvestris (see note to chapter 22 above). Another possibility is that Chaucer was referring to the signs of the zodiac â âLionâ, âCapricornâ etc.\n\nYpres Salient [172]\n\nThis was a section of the Western Front during the First World War (near Ypres or Ieper, in the west of Belgium) where extremely much and heavy fighting took place. There are140 military cemeteries around Ypres.\n\nYou leave the world, as you entered it, with the âmen of your own yearâÂ [173]\n\ncf. a passage in J. B. S. Haldaneâs early futurological essay Daedalus (1923) â\n\nThe abolition of disease will make death a physiological event like sleep. A generation that has lived together will die together.\n\nHaldane (see notes to chapters 3 and 20, above) presents this speculation as a ground for the further idea that, under such improved conditions, there would be no more longing for lost friends or relatives, and so, no more longing for an afterlife â the less so since no single life would end before completion.\n\nthe author whom I mentioned to youÂ [174]\n\nCicero, Roman writer, orator and statesman (106â43 b.c.); the quotation is from De officiis, III.2. âAfricanusâ is the Roman general Scipio Africanus; he was ânever less alone than when aloneâ as he was happy in âthe company of his own thoughtsâ.\n\n8 Feb. 2011 â Added note on along the roots of the mountains in chapter 13"
