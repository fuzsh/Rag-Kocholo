Mike Miller is headed back to Memphis to join the Grizzlies for a second stint with the franchise. Miller and the Grizzlies agreed to a two-year deal on Wednesday.

Miller was released by the Heat last week via their amnesty clause. He is still owed nearly $13 million on his contract that he signed back in the summer of 2010. The move is going to drastically cut back the luxury tax for the Heat next season.

During the regular season, Miller averaged just five points, but he stepped up huge in the playoffs when he hit on 44 percent of his threes. Miller was an integral part of the Heatâ€™s back-to-back title runs, as he hit timely threes in the biggest games. He will look to help Memphis get to its first NBA Finals.

Miller had some of his best years statistically with Memphis, including the 2005-2006 season when he won the Sixth Man of the Year award. He averaged a career high 18.5 points per game the next season.
