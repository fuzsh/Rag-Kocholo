Following 17 seasons as a pro player and two more as an assistant coach for the University of Memphis men’s basketball team, Mike Miller has found a way to mesh basketball with family by coaching his teenage sons, Mason and Mavrick, and their teammates. Last July, just six weeks after he stepped down at Memphis, Miller took over as the head boys basketball coach at Houston High School in Germantown, 25 miles east of the arena where he starred for the Grizzlies from 2003-08 and again in 2013-14.

His first season as a high school skipper ended with a water bottle bath at MTSU’s Murphy Center on Saturday evening. Miller helped a loaded Houston roster dismantle Cane Ridge 62-43 for the Class AAA state title – the first in program history. The Mustangs finished with a 23-3 overall record against teams from seven states. “I was able to sacrifice a little bit of what I wanted to do in my personal life to do this, and it was worth every minute of it,” said Miller, who won NBA titles playing alongside Lebron James with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013.
