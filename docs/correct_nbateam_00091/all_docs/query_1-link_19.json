        "text": "Mike Miller was resistant to the idea at first. He had already finished off a 17-year NBA career, won two rings and earned plenty of spoils. When he became a college assistant coach after he retired, he became pretty good at that too; Miller was considered one of the best recruiters in the country when he left his job at the University of Memphis in June 2020.\n\nEarlier that year, Donnie McGrath, a longtime pro in Europe, came to Miller and asked if he wanted to be an NBA agent; he was starting up a new basketball representation agency. Miller had another career waiting for him, if he wanted it.\n\nIt was an interesting pitch but initially not enough for Miller to actually do it. But they kept talking, and Miller started thinking. If he did become an agent, he’d want to build the agency on his terms.\n\nTwo and a half years later, LIFT Sports has been crafted in his vision, with a name pulled from Miller’s personal motto, and the agency made a splash in June when client Paolo Banchero went No. 1 to the Orlando Magic. That tied Miller’s past and present together. He, too, had been a Magic lottery pick 22 years before that.\n\nThat night was big for the agency.\n\n“People within the business knew about LIFT and knew that Mike was an agent, but I think that’s when really the masses kind of figured out ‘Wow, like, Mike Miller’s his agent,’ and we’re building something that’s pretty unique,” McGrath, a co-founder, said. “So for us, it was 100 percent an inflection point.”\n\nHe spoke from a quiet conference room in LIFT’s lower Manhattan office, a few blocks from the East River. The company, which started as a five-person operation, has nearly tripled since it began in mid-2020. It represents eight NBA players and has roughly 25 clients, including pro athletes and college ones signed to name, image and likeness deals, McGrath said.\n\nWhile Miller is the president and face of the company, he founded it alongside McGrath, an ex-Providence College sharpshooter and New York City native who now handles its business affairs and is its CEO. Noah Croom, a former Timberwolves executive and general counsel at Goodwin Sports, is on board as a senior VP. Dan Frank, a longtime NBA agent, was front and center at LIFT’s inception as its first certified agent. Kristian Petesic, a former director of scouting with the Knicks, is its director of basketball operations.\n\nThe past year has brought a number of successes. LIFT signed Banchero, a coup after he had been represented by CAA Sports for NIL opportunities while at Duke, and Wendell Moore Jr., the No. 26 pick in the draft. Though it lost RJ Hampton, its first client back in 2020, to CAA, LIFT added Orlando Magic center Wendell Carter Jr. and Baylor guard Keyonte George, a potential lottery pick this June, to its roster. It also grew, hiring agent Ryan Davis from Rep1 Sports.\n\nThat is a quick ascent for a young agency, especially in an industry known to be notoriously competitive — some even say vicious. The number of agents has jumped by roughly 44 percent over the past five years, and the most prominent firms have not only expanded but also partnered with top Hollywood agencies. LIFT, however, feels it can differentiate itself even in that saturated market, with Miller at its core as an ex-NBA player who believes he can guide current players through the wisdom he gained during his 17 seasons in the league.\n\n“Other agencies might know a lot about basketball but to live it and to understand it — and I think at the end of the day, again, nothing against them, but me talking and projecting out a player or comping a player or doing those things as far as what it looks like for a player paints a little bit of a different picture,” Miller said. “Because I know what it looks like to play against or play besides LeBron James or play beside a Marc Gasol or a Pau Gasol, what a team really, really wants you to do. It may not be who you are as a rookie. It may not be who you are in four years, but how do I get on the floor now? What do they expect you to do? And it’s gonna look different. Having those conversations — again, other agencies can have them does the client believe you? Does the front office believe you? Those things all come into the actual fact that I played. My entire life was the game of basketball.”\n\nLIFT was born after McGrath finished his own playing career in 2018 following a dozen seasons hopping around European leagues. McGrath wanted to build an agency and eventually was introduced to Miller in early 2020 when he heard the former NBA vet was interested in becoming an agent. McGrath had strong ties to the University of Florida — he grew up with Joakim Noah and is friends with Matt Walsh and Chandler Parsons — and Miller starred there. Frank represented Parsons at one point, and he was the official agent of record when LIFT launched in 2020.\n\nMcGrath considered approaching more established agents, but Miller was, he said, a no-brainer. That Miller was an NBA player is part of the agency’s appeal; so is that he has experienced life at nearly every end of the NBA spectrum. He won Rookie of the Year and had been traded four times. He won Sixth Man of the Year in 2006 and was a key reserve on two championship teams in Miami; he also spent his last two seasons in the league barely playing. The agency gets its name from one of Miller’s favorite phrases; they are the Let It Fly Team. Miller a 40.7 percent career 3-point shooter, used to say “let it fly” as a player and has several businesses named with that same phrase, McGrath said.\n\nThat Miller is a novice as an agent, he and others said, is not an obstacle. He’s now one of three NBPA-certified agents at the company, and just one of seven former players to be certified by the union after he passed the agent certification exam in 2021. Croom spent 14 years at Goodwin Sports and has experience in negotiations from both the team and player side. Miller was deliberate to put that group around him, so he feels he hasn’t had any surprises as an agent.\n\n“My entire life was basketball, so I didn’t have to worry about that side of it,” he said. “I got my doctorate in that. So let’s find doctorates in every other aspect of this business that we need to make sure we’re taking care of the kids and I did that. If I was just doing this by myself, I would say yes, but I’ve learned a long time ago know who you are and know who you’re not. It’s no different than basketball. Be great at what you’re great at.”\n\nThat self-awareness is what made Miller so good as a player, Arn Tellem, his old agent, said (and a sweet jumper didn’t hurt). Tellem represented Miller and was one of the most prominent agents in the league before he became the vice chairman of Palace Sports & Entertainment, the company that owns the Detroit Pistons, in 2015. They have remained close and Miller has sought advice from Tellem before and since becoming an agent.\n\nTellem remains high on Miller’s basketball acumen. He talked to Miller about joining the Pistons in a front office or coaching role in 2020, even encouraging some in the Pistons organization to talk to him, but Miller found LIFT a more compelling option.\n\nTellem believes Miller’s ability to guide players through a career will serve him well.\n\n“He may not have the legal background or the experience in negotiations, (but) the other aspects of it are so important,” Tellem said. “The connection with the players, the trust players have in their representatives, that he has with his clients. … That is to me the most important because he can get help on the negotiations and the legal aspect from people who are in his group to support him.”\n\nTellem also thinks that the nature of an agent’s job has changed since he sat atop the industry. The collective bargaining agreement has created max contracts and a wage scale for first-round picks.\n\n“The agent’s job is really helping navigating the player to maximize his career opportunities and help them in their development, their adjustment to the league,” Tellem said, adding, “I think that’s why the agent business is changing so much in basketball because it’s more about career guidance and maybe less about the actual negotiation.”\n\nBanchero heard similar advice before he settled on Miller as his agent. They had known each other since he was in high school; Miller recruited Banchero to Memphis, and it was the first school outside of the Pac-12 to offer him a scholarship. They kept in touch while Banchero was at Duke.\n\nWhile Banchero pondered which agent he would hire, he asked some NBA players about what to seek in an agent. They told him a player of his caliber didn’t necessarily need a large agency and should instead look for one that could give him everything he wanted. As he realized that he didn’t need a large firm to be the top pick, he was no longer hung up on being a client of one.\n\nInstead, Banchero said Miller and LIFT have been able to leverage their connections to help him. Petesic helped him during the pre-draft process. The agency has a partnership with Penni Thow, a high-profile manager who also represents Formula One star Lewis Hamilton, and Copper, her marketing agency. Thow, who used to work for music executive Scooter Braun, one of McGrath’s childhood friends, works with Banchero and helped negotiate his deal with Jordan Brand. It was part of the plan that sold him on LIFT in the first place.\n\n“The amount of resources he had was impressive for him being new to the game.” Banchero said. He added, “I wouldn’t say he’s your typical agent at all. He knows what it’s like to be in the NBA.”\n\nLIFT got off the ground at a precarious time for agencies. The number of NBA agents has surged in recent years, although the number of roster spots has stayed constant (save for an influx of two-way players). NIL has opened new revenue paths, but that money doesn’t match the value of NBA contracts.\n\nThe industry’s top players have also started making key partnerships. While CAA Sports was already a sports extension of the high-powered Creative Artists Agency, a powerhouse in nearly every venue, Klutch Sports partnered with UTA, and BDA Sports, led by Bill Duffy, struck a deal with WME. It was two more basketball agencies finding reinforcements in top Hollywood firms that offer strong marketing arms.\n\nWhile Tellem said an agent’s job may have changed, he argues it is no less easier than it was when he was one of the sport’s top agents.\n\nBut LIFT’s top executives feel they are coming in at a great time. McGrath, who has taken responsibility for the firms operations and partnerships, secured a financier from his contacts in New York, giving the agency a financial runway since new agencies usually have to wait for stronger revenue streams until its clients sign new contracts. Croom said the timing is right too.\n\nPlayer salaries, he points out, are growing quickly. They will likely do so even more after the NBA’s next media rights deal kicks in with the 2025-26 season. That will trickle down to agency fees. Banchero, or anyone who came in with the 2022 rookie class, could earn more than $1 billion in just NBA contracts over the course of his career. If the NBA expands, as commissioner Adam Silver has mentioned, that could bring more jobs too. The newly lax NIL laws have allowed high school and college athletes to start bringing in income.\n\n“I actually think that there’s going to be some growth,” Croom said. “But there are new agents coming in every day, many of them well-funded. And it’s still a very cash intensive business, make no mistake. But I do think it’s an opportune time from that perspective. But again, it is very competitive. And if I were to say we have an edge in a competitive marketplace, it is Mike’s ability to get in front of just about any player. We’re not closing on all of them — no one is. Whether they are current NBA players or future NBA players, I feel confident Mike can get an audience with just about anyone.”\n\nMiller could have led an easier life than the one he leads now, flying around the country, dealing with clients, recruiting new ones. When a reporter asked why he chose this life, with a demanding new job and success hard to achieve, Miller chuckled.\n\n“It is challenging,” he said. “It is tough. But I expected that. I knew it was going to be hard. There’s an amazing group of agents out there and I really do mean that. Great agencies. We’re just different. So what I learned was through this process is if you can do the things the right way and you get the right clients that care mostly about basketball and understand and they’re educated about what the real life up here, a professional life, looks like, it’s an easier transition for them.”\n\nCroom believes one of LIFT’s competitive advantages will be its style of services, with a small, close-knit team ready to help players. Miller remains a hands-on agent. He had started working out with players while he was at Memphis, as a de facto skills and shooting coach, and he has continued with the clients he represents.\n\nThat is one of Miller’s ways of earning time with them and keeping a strong relationship. It’s also his way of retaining a part of himself. Players visit him in Memphis during the offseason and get into the gym. Banchero worked out with him before the draft in two-week stints, and the two snuck in a workout in New York ahead of his debut at Madison Square Garden.\n\n“That’s one of my favorite things to do because that’s where you build the trust and keep it real with them,” Miller said. “This is what it looks like to be a pro. I’m still doing it. I’m 42 and with you guys. I’m broken down and fat, but I’m still doing it.”\n\nAs LIFT contemplates growth, it wants to maintain those touch points. When it started, Miller said it quickly scaled to an agency large enough to represent 15-20 players even though it didn’t have that many clients because he wanted to think long term. But Croom said he wants the circle of people every player interacts with to remain small; he sees it as a strength for LIFT. Miller said he doesn’t want the agency to lose its boutique feel.\n\nThat personal touch has helped Miller so far, and he and LIFT will need all the edges they can muster in a fickle business.\n\n“I think that we can offer something different, which is, player-led agency of guys that have walked in those footsteps before,” McGrath said. “It’s a cutthroat business. There’s no doubt about it. But I think we’re up for that.”\n\n(Illustration by Eamonn Dalton / The Athletic; photos by David Dow, Fernando Medina, Garrett Ellwood / NBAE via Getty Images)"
