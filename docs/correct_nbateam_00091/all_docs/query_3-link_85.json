        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies take the court for the first time since head coach Mike Fratello was relieved of his duties when they host the Toronto Raptors Saturday night.\n\nOn Thursday, the Grizzlies fired Fratello, who was named head coach on Dec. 2, 2004 and guided the team to a 40-26 record and a playoff berth.\n\nIn his first full season with the franchise, Fratello, who replaced Hubie Brown, guided the Grizzlies to a 49-33 record and a first-round playoff matchup against the eventual Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks. Dallas swept Memphis 4-0.\n\nTony Barone Sr., who has spent the past seven seasons as director of player personnel for the Grizzlies, was named interim head coach. It is his first head coaching job in the NBA.\n\nThe Grizzlies have lost five in a row. On Wednesday, Michael Redd and Andrew Bogut both scored 20 points as the Milwaukee Bucks rolled past the Grizzlies 112-96 in Memphis.\n\nPau Gasol scored a game-high 29 points for the Grizzlies, who have lost 11 of their last 12 games. Mike Miller had 18 points and shot 7-of-17 from the field in the loss.\n\nMemphis, which wraps up a brief two-game homestand, sports a 4-9 record at home this season. The Grizzlies visit the Houston Rockets on Sunday.\n\nToronto has lost two of its last three games, but still leads the Atlantic Division by one game over the New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets.\n\nOn Friday, the Raptors suffered a 107-97 loss to the Chicago Bulls in Toronto.\n\nT.J. Ford had 20 points and six assists, but turned the ball over seven times for the Raptors. Joey Graham scored 17 points in a losing cause and Italian Andrea Bargnani added 16 points off the bench.\n\nThe Raptors are 5-13 on the road this season.\n\nThis is the first of two meetings this season between the Raptors and Memphis. Toronto hosts the Grizzlies on March 7.\n\nMemphis went 2-0 in the series with Toronto last season and has won seven straight against the Raptors.\n\nToronto is back in action next Tuesday when it hosts Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns."
