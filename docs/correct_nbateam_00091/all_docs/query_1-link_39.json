        "text": "(WMC-TV) - The Memphis Grizzlies announced Tuesday it signed two-time NBA champion Mike Miller.\n\nTerms of the deal are not being disclosed.\n\nMiller spent the last three seasons with the Miami Heat, but before that, he played five-plus seasons with the Grizz, earning eight major franchise records.\n\n\"The ownership, the organization, they're doing everything they can and showing their commitment to being a championship caliber team and a championship organization. I'm excited to be back here with Coach Joerger, I think it's going to be a lot of fun,\" said Miller.\n\n\"We are extraordinarily pleased to welcome Mike Miller back to Memphis,\" Grizzlies Chief Executive Officer Jason Levien said in a written statement. \"Mike is a special figure in our community due to his contributions both on and off the court. Mike is an elite three-point shooter, as Grizzlies fans know first-hand, and we expect his shooting, play-making, hustle and leadership to be a key component in our team competing with the best in the NBA next season.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old is not only known on the court, but in the community for his work with several charitable organizations, including St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. In 2008, Miller donated $200,000 to the hospital. It was the largest-ever donation to St. Jude by a Memphis Grizzlies player.\n\nCopyright 2013 WMC-TV. All rights reserved."
