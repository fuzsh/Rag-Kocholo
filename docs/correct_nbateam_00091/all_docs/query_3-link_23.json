        "text": "In the first drill on the first day of practice for the Memphis Tigers last week, it was Mike Miller instructing the Tigers through a three-man weave. Yes, that Mike Miller, less than two years removed from the end of his playing career, a former sharpshooter and NBA sixth man of the year who won two NBA championships and earned just shy of $100 million in his NBA career.\n\nThe Tigers’ hire of Penny Hardaway as head coach this offseason has gotten most of the national attention, but nearly as fascinating is the evolution of Miller from a basketball prodigy in small-town South Dakota to college star to NBA champion to an assistant coach at Memphis. “Believe me, he’s just getting started,” says Ernie Kuyper, Miller’s cousin and program director of Miller’s former grassroots basketball team. “It’s been great. The ride has been unbelievable. But now the coaching ride is starting. The playing ride is over.”\n\nNine months ago, Miller moved his family from Ohio back to Memphis, where Miller had two stints with the Memphis Grizzlies (the last ending in 2014). It’s where Miller won the sixth man of the year award in 2006, and it’s where he still holds the Grizzlies’ franchise record for most points in a game (45) and career 3-point percentage. The city had been good to the Millers. Plus, it felt like a much, much bigger Mitchell, South Dakota. “We just had such a strong connection to the community here,” says Miller’s wife, Jennifer. “We knew this was a great place for the boys.”\n\nBut it wasn’t clear what direction Miller’s career would go after wrapping up a 17-year career. He could have joined an NBA front office, like his former NBA teammate Shane Battier. He could’ve done analyst work with ESPN full-time. Or he could get into college coaching; he already sponsored a local grassroots team (M33M, although it’s now called Hoop City Basketball Club) and he knew all about the grind from his older brother, Ryan, who’s an assistant at TCU.\n\n“Front office work and coaching at the NBA level all intrigue me. I’ll never say never,” Miller says. “It’s just at this stage of my life, fresh off the NBA and that experience, I think this is where I can have the biggest impact.”\n\nCollege head coaches around the country, it turned out, happened to think the same thing. Once Miller let it be known he was interested in a job as an assistant, he got offers from Louisville, TCU and Florida. As Miller was sifting through his options, the Memphis basketball program made a dramatic move. Citing declining attendance and revenue, the school fired future Hall-of-Famer Tubby Smith after just two seasons. The program immediately turned to Hardaway, and suddenly, there was an opening in the city Miller once again called home. He wanted it.\n\n“I saw the excitement in the city,” Miller says, “and basically realized how Tiger basketball captivated this place and it brought me flashbacks to what this city was like when Cal had it.” Within Hardaway’s first two weeks on the job, he and Miller had their first of two meetings. The initial meeting was exploratory. Hardaway wanted to assess how serious Miller was in the job, and if he was really willing to invest the time it would take to do the job well. Was Miller committed to coaching or was he just another retired pro athlete looking for a distraction?\n\nThen they met again, this time for hours. Hardaway and Miller shared philosophies, ideas, and program goals. “It felt like I was looking at myself in the mirror,” Miller says. “We’re both taking these jobs because we want to, not because we need to. That’s a huge difference. When you work because you want to, and it’s not about the first and 15th coming around — it’s different.”\n\nThe two decided they’d be a perfect fit. So far, they appear to be right. Miller has already his demonstrated deep connections in recruiting. Top-25 guard Boogie Ellis is taking an unofficial visit this Thursday for Memphis Madness. Five-star forward Trendon Watford — who came up in Miller’s AAU program — will be there, too. Jalen Green and RJ Hampton, the No. 1 and No. 4 players in 2020, took their first official visits to Memphis together last month. “(Miller) just got done playing,” Kuyper says. “He can still check it up and whoop a few of their tails. He can relate to kids because he’s young enough still, and he’s a great guy to be around. He’s fun.”\n\nBoosters and fans love him, too — perhaps now more than ever. He won two championships alongside LeBron James in the glitz and glamor of Miami, but never lost his South Dakota sensibilities. In fact, he hasn’t even sent in his NBA retirement paperwork yet — though he assures he’s 100 percent retired. “I guess I just assume they see me walking around old and decrepit,” Miller says. That modest disposition plays perfectly in Memphis, a city that loves to celebrate its grit and grind. “One of the things that is surprising, the fans have been more supportive and outspoken for Mike as a coach than when he was a Grizzly,” Jennifer says. “He gets stopped way more now. This is definitely a college basketball town.”\n\nAnd the coaching piece of it? Miller’s a natural. In the twilight of his NBA career, Miller was essentially a player-coach in Denver, working closely with the Nuggets’ young pieces and, specifically, Nikola Jokic. Miller would offer pointers on rotations, ball movement, help defense, and anything else he saw that needed tweaking. So, what he’s doing at Memphis as a first-time coach is essentially what he’s been doing for the last five years of his life. He didn’t prepare for the opportunity at Memphis the same way Hardaway did, but he was ready, all the same.\n\n“He’s very detailed,” freshman point guard Alex Lomax says. “He’s a great personality in the gym, just somebody you need to bring the energy up. Sometimes, he’ll bring us up if we’re having bad shooting days. He will roast you real fast, too. He shows a lot of love, but he’s also gonna show you the tough love, and that’s the great thing about him.”\n\nBeyond that, the list of coaches Miller played for in his NBA career includes Hubie Brown, Erik Spoelstra, Doc Rivers and Billy Donovan. He has been schooled by some of the best minds in basketball. “He’s just too knowledgeable,” Jennifer says. “He’s got way too much to offer to sit back and golf the rest of his life. I think when you have a gift like he has, you wanna give back. … It’s so great he’s gonna use that.”\n\nLike most assistants, Miller’s long-term goal is obviously to become a head coach in college. If the Tigers have the kind of success that he and Hardaway envision, it probably won’t be long before Miller gets that opportunity. He has the pedigree, the background, and the charisma that should make him high-demand. But for the foreseeable future, the man who made $100 million in his first career is focused on his new one: grinding as an assistant and helping Hardaway restore the Memphis program back to national relevance.\n\n“I have to see this and the success of it and the things I’m good at, the things I’m not,” Miller says. “I’m using this process to help Memphis and the city and Penny become the best he can be. If that leads to head coaching, it does. I’ve got to prove to myself that I can do it. Head coaching excites me, just like it should excite anyone who gets into this. But there’s a process to it all, and you can’t skip that process.”\n\n(Top photo courtesy of Matthew Smith/University of Memphis)"
