        "text": "MIAMI (CBSMiami) – Former Miami Heat sharpshooter Mike Miller might have one final shot to take at his former team.\n\nAccording to CBS4 news partner the Miami Herald, Miller may file a lawsuit against the Heat because he thinks the team should hold some responsibility for him getting swindled by a con man and losing $1.7 million.\n\nMiller, now playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, fell victim to a scam put allegedly put together by Haider Zafar, a South Beach bling king who said he was a member of a wealthy Pakistani family. Miller's complaint, which the Herald said has already been drawn up, said the forward was introduced to Zafar by a Heat employee and that Zafar used $700,000 he allegedly took to buy courtside tickets.\n\nThe Herald reported Miller asked for the $700,000 back from the Heat, plus the attorney's fees, but no settlement was near. In a lawsuit, Miller will reportedly ask for the entire $1.7 million he lost in the scam during his time in Miami.\n\nMiller was released by the Miami Heat in the offseason move using the NBA's one-time amnesty clause which allowed the team to wipe away his salary from the books for salary cap purposes, but he will still get paid his full salary.\n\nMiller has since signed with the Memphis Grizzlies, who he's previously played with in the past.\n\nIn his place, the Heat signed several players including forward Michael Beasley and center Greg Oden.\n\n(TM and © Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
