        "text": "After years of needing a shooter to balance their already-potent offense and make up for the loss of marksman Mike Miller in 2008, the Memphis Grizzlies are about to land their man.\n\nAnd it's Miller time â€” again.\n\nAccording to a person with knowledge of the situation, the former Grizzlies fan favorite who became a free agent when he was amnestied by the Miami Heat recently has told Memphis officials that he'll sign with them. The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not yet been finalized.\n\nThe terms of Miller's agreement with the Grizzlies were not immediately known, but he is still owed a combined $12.8 million from the Heat for the next two seasons and, as a result, was in a position to join the team of his liking with little consideration given to the financial component. The Oklahoma City Thunder and Denver Nuggets were also known to be in the running for Miller.\n\nMiller was a wildly popular member of the Grizzlies from 2002 to 2008, with his peak of production coming in the 2006-07 campaign in which he averaged 18.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.3 assists while playing in 70 games.\n\nHe has been riddled with injuries for the past four seasons and considered retirement after Miami's championship in 2012, but has continued to shoot at a high level when healthy (41.7% from three-point range last season; 45.3% the season prior).\n\nHe started four games for Miami in the Heat's NBA Finals win against the San Antonio Spurs while shooting shot 61.1% from three-point range, with coach Erik Spoelstra wanting Miller's outside threat to create space for LeBron James and other stars. ESPN.com first reported that Miller told the Grizzlies he would sign with them."
