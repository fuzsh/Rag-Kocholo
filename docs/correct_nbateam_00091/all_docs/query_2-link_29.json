        "text": "A Germantown sports bar and restaurant started by a former Memphis Grizzlies player ceased operations before the New Year.\n\nMike Miller’s Let It Fly Sports Bar at 9091 Poplar Ave. in Germantown is permanently closed. Jason Polley, managing leasing director for StoneCrest Investments, confirmed to The Commercial Appeal on Tuesday that Let It Fly closed for good on Sunday, Dec. 31.\n\nPolley said StoneCrest Investments is currently working with Miller to identify a suitable replacement or tenant on the current lease. Polley said there are five years remaining on the 10-year lease. Let It Fly opened in October 2019 at Germantown’s StoneCreek Centre Shopping Mall, which is managed by StoneCrest Investments. The now vacant 4,527-square-foot space can seat about 140 people, according to Polley. He doesn’t expect the space to be empty for too long.\n\n“There is significant interest in the space and it being a former restaurant with that kind of visibility on Poplar Avenue and Germantown, I anticipate we will identify and secure a new restaurant very soon,” Polley said.\n\nMiller did not respond to a call seeking comment.\n\nLet It Fly's Southaven location still in the works\n\nDespite Let It Fly Sports Bar shutting its doors in one Memphis suburb, plans for another location in Southaven appear to still be in the works. The sports-themed restaurant is expected to open at the $200 million mixed-use Silo Square in mid-summer of 2024. Let It Fly announced in August 2022 its plans to bring the sports bar and restaurant to DeSoto County. The restaurant is expected to feature golf simulator bays as well as food and beverages.\n\nOther Let It Fly locations\n\nLet It Fly also has sports bar and restaurant locations in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Omaha, Nebraska."
