        "text": "ATLANTA — It's an hour and a half before tipoff and Mike Miller is leaning forward in his seat in anxious anticipation.\n\n\"If we do what we're supposed to do, we'll be fine,\" the former Gator and current Memphis Grizzlies forward said while sitting four rows behind\n\nFlorida's bench Monday night in the Georgia Dome. \"These guys (Florida) are impressive.\"\n\nMiller arrived in Atlanta just hours before Monday night's national championship game between Ohio State and Florida. Miller, of course, is no stranger to this big stage. Miller's buzzer-beater over Butler in 2000 helped Florida make an improbable run to the Final Four in Indianapolis.\n\nMiller, sporting a backward Florida Gators cap, looked around the semi-empty Georgia Dome prior to Monday night's game and shook while contemplating a question about his emotions on returning to the Final Four.\n\n\"I'm just excited for these kids,\" Miller says. \"It takes a lot of guts to come back and they did.\"\n\nMiller wasn't the only Gator in the Georgia Dome in the hours leading up to Monday's game. Florida's fans filled the Georgia Dome about an hour prior to tipoff. They booed the Buckeyes when they came out for their pre-game shootaround and chanted, \"Let's go Gators,\" when Florida arrived on the court.\n\nOhio State is clearly the most technological savvy of the two teams. Several Buckeye players were shooting around pre-game listening to iPods, which were hidden inside their warm-ups.\n\nThe Gators were iPod-less, but the drone of each team's band playing during warmups echoed through the cavernous Georgia Dome.\n\nMuch like Saturday, fans are seated in the opposite end zone of the dome as the basketball court ... and they're in the upper deck. I can only imagine how small Greg Oden and Joakim Noah must look from 100 yards away and three stories in the air.\n\nAt least Miller has prime seats.\n\n\"I'm so glad we got back (to the Final Four),\" Miller said. \"It would have been a shame if these guys came back and didn't get back here. But they did it.\""
