        "text": "The NBA Tuesday winding road continue as we leave the Best Coast after two weeks in the City of Angels to travel across the country to Memphis: it’s Grizzlies time! Of course, the state of Tennessee is not exactly known for its Grizzly bears, but we know the franchise, which has never won an NBA title, didn’t originate here, either. So what kind of “Grizzlies” adorn the Top 10 list today? Read on and enjoy the memories …\n\nNo. 10: Jaren Jackson, Jr., PF/C—21.6 WS (2018-present)\n\nHe made his first All-Star team last season, after being the No. 4 overall pick in the 2018 Draft. In 318 career games, Jackson has posted 17.4 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 2.0 bpg, and 1.3 apg. In 23 playoff contests, he’s been just as sound: 15.7 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 2.1 bpg, and 1.1 apg. Voted the DPOY in 2023 as well, Jackson has topped the NBA in blocks twice (2022, 2023). His short-time status with the team demonstrates his ranking here is only rising.\n\nNo. 9: Tony Allen, SG—26.3 WS (2010-2017)\n\nAn NBA champion with Boston (2008), he came to Memphis later to be a veteran leader. Never anything resembling a star player, Allen put up 8.9 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 1.7 spg, and 1.4 apg over 462 games with the Griz—including 359 starts. He helped the team to 6 straight postseason, averaging 8.9 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.9 spg, and 1.4 apg in 56 playoff contests. His career best season came in Memphis, too, as he posted 5.1 WS in 2012-2013.\n\nNo. 8: Rudy Gay, SF—29.2 WS (2006-2013)\n\nThe No. 8 overall pick in the draft, he never made an All-Star team in his 17-year career, the first 6.5 seasons coming in Memphis. He wasn’t a disappointment, per se, but Gay was never a stud, either: 17.9 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 2.0 apg, 1.3 spg. Sadly, the Grizz only made the postseason once with him on the roster (2012), but Gay played well in the first-round, 7-game series loss: 19.0 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 1.4 apg, and 1.3 spg. Rough times, indeed.\n\nNo. 7: Shareef Abdur-Rahim, PF/SF—31.7 WS (1996-2001)\n\nThe No. 3 pick in the draft played this well for the franchise in only 5 seasons, all in Vancouver. He never made an All-Star team as a Grizzly, but Reef did post 20.8 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 2.9 apg, 1.1 spg, abd 1.0 bpg while wearing the team’s uniform. However, the franchise never reached the postseason with him on the roster. His best seasons were the last two in Vancouver, when he combined for 17.3 WS across the two years, total.\n\nNo. 6: Mike Miller, SF/SG—33.1 WS (2003-2008, 2013-2014)\n\nThe No. 5 overall pick in the 2000 Draft, he later came to Memphis and played steadily for 453 regular-season games (13.2 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 3.0 apg)—but not so much in 19 playoff games (8.6 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 1.6 apg). Never an All Star, Miller started only 281 of those regular-season games. He did put together back-to-back seasons of 7+ WS in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, but that is as good as it got for him in a Grizzlies uniform.\n\nNo. 5: Shane Battier, SF/SG—34.9 WS (2001-2006, 2011)\n\nLike Miller, he later won 2 NBA titles with the Miami Heat (2012, 2013). But as the No. 6 overall pick in the 2001 Draft for Memphis, he didn’t deliver on that promise. Never an All Star, Battier averaged 10.2 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.7 apg, and 1.2 spg in his two combined stints with the Grizz over 419 games (279 starts). In 25 playoff games (8 starts), the numbers dropped to 5.8 ppg, 4.6 rpg, and 1.0 apg. A lot of wasted draft potential here.\n\nNo. 4: Zach Randolph, PF—51.2 WS (2009-2017)\n\nHe came to the franchise as a polished veteran, making 2 All-Star teams while with the Grizz (2010, 2013). Over 551 games with the team, Z-Bo put up 16.8 ppg, 10.2 rpg, and 2.0 apg. In the postseason (62 games), he managed 17.1 ppg, 9.5 rpg, and 1.8 apg. In 2010-2011, he had his best season with Memphis, posting 10.5 WS despite being left off the All-Star roster for some reason. He was a special player and did his best work here.\n\nNo. 3: Pau Gasol, PF/C—53.8 WS (2001-2008)\n\nWhile better known for his work elsewhere, he delivered—for the most part—on his No. 3 overall draft pick status, making the All-Star team as a Grizzly in 2006. Over 476 games with the team, he averaged 18.8 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 3.1 apg, and 1.8 bpg, and in 12 playoff games, he was almost as good: 20.0 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 2.7 apg, and 1.5 bpg. His best year with the team was 2005-2006, when he earned 12.0 WS and made the All-Star team.\n\nNo. 2: Mike Conley, PG—71.4 WS (2007-2019)\n\nHe’s still active in the NBA today, although not with this franchise. Conley was the No. 4 overall pick in the draft, but like so many on this list, he never made an All-Star team while with the Grizz. His numbers? He averaged 14.9 ppg, 5.7 apg, 3.0 rpg, and 1.5 spg over 788 regular-season games while posting 16.5 ppg, 6.7 apg, 3.7 rpg, and 1.4 spg in 56 playoff games. He posted 9.9 WS (2013) and 10.0 WS (2017) in his best years.\n\nNo. 1: Marc Gasol, C—77.4 WS (2008-2019)"
