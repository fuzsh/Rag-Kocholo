        "text": "Mike Miller stepped down from his position as a Memphis assistant coach earlier this month to spend more time with his family, ending his time with the program after two seasons. On Friday, the former NBA Sixth Man of the Year spoke to The Athletic exclusively about his experience at Memphis, the future of the program, and more.\n\nSo what’d you think of your time at Memphis?\n\nI thought it was fun. It’s competitive. It’s basketball. It’s about getting kids, helping kids, and at the same time trying to win games. Trying to replicate what you did playing basketball is hard to do. So you live through it with the kids you recruit and compete and try to game-plan and stuff like that, it’s fun. A different challenge.\n\nHow did the reality of Memphis and college basketball match up with your expectations?\n\nI thought it matched up pretty well. Obviously, my brother Ryan being in the game as long as he has been, you see the things you have to excel at, get better at. I thought overall it matched up as much as I thought it would.\n\nWhat was hard about college basketball?\n\nThe biggest challenge is the lack of control. When you’re a player, you have a lot of control over the outcome of a game. As a coach, your job is to prepare and adjust, but when the ball is tipped and they’re out there, there’s nothing you can do. The control is different.\n\nWhat were the highlights of your time at Memphis?\n\nEverything. To me, I enjoy challenges. One of the biggest highlights of it all was seeing the city come together for what Coach (Penny) Hardaway was doing and to see where it was and where he’s got it now I think is the biggest highlight we can all have. You bring in great players like James Wiseman, Precious Achiuwa, Boogie Ellis, Lester Quinones, D.J. Jeffries, Damion Baugh — all these guys that are trying to do certain things, and you had a hand in it or were a part of it. That’s a highlight in itself.\n\nHow important was it to get your college coaching career started in Memphis?\n\nIt was the most important thing. I always called Memphis home. It still will be. I’m not going anywhere. I’ve made that clear. I did this to be closer with my family and spend more time with them. It goes fast. Unfortunately, when I was in college coaching, you spend more time with other people’s kids than your own. My son is going through his recruiting now, and I had to be there to help. But I wouldn’t have done this anywhere else. It was perfect timing. I got to work with Penny, and I got to be in Memphis. It was a dream come true.\n\nNow that you’re moving on, what do you think about the future of the program?\n\nThey’re just fine. I was a small piece in what they’re doing. Obviously, it was a blessing the opportunity Coach gave me to be a part of it, but they’re anchored down. They’re headed in the right direction. I was, again, a small piece, and had a small part in what he’s building.\n\nAre you closed off to college basketball?\n\nAbsolutely not. I love college basketball, but right now is just not the time. It was something that was great for me for those two years. It was a relief. It was a getaway, to scratch that competitive itch. It gave me that chance. I’ll never say never. It was too much fun to say “never” to.\n\nWhat message would you like to leave Memphis fans with?\n\nThanks for taking me in. For them to again let me be part of their community and what they’ve done. The Memphis Tigers basketball community is so special. I’ve been able to play two parts now, with the Grizzlies and now with the Tigers. The people here are awesome, and that’s why I moved back. Open arms all the time. I appreciate them.\n\n(Photo of Mike Miller: Matthew Visinsky / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
