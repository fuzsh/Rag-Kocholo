        "text": "Three days ago, a video surfaced on social media showing 40 year-old and retired NBA player Mike Miller destroying various D-1 college basketball recruits. The story goes that the each of the players challenged Miller to a game of 1-on-1; he obliterated each and every one of them.\n\nOddly enough, people on social media were shocked. How could a 40 year-old NBA vet do such a thing at his age? How is he still that good? Why didn’t he look that good in the latter part of his career if he still had (and has) that much game left? 6 years ago, Miller was 34, and was more athletic and no-doubt much more refined as an overall player, since he still practiced every day for an NBA team. Nonetheless, he averaged 2.1 points, 1.8 rebounds, and 0.9 assists per-game on 32.5% from the field for the Cleveland Cavaliers while playing just 13.5 minutes per-game in 52 total games. In other words, he was almost useless.\n\nThat’s the guy annihilating top prospects? Seriously? How?\n\nAllow this video to serve as a reminder of just how good the average NBA player is, even if they’re 40.\n\nMike Miller once epitomized the perfect role-player in the NBA. As a member of the Miami Heat, he did all of the little things you’d ask for from a guy getting 15–20 minutes per-game: he shot the three at a high rate, could shoot the midrange, occasionally found his way to the basket, and never begged for a larger role nor the spotlight. He was the go-to bench shooting threat.\n\nHowever, that role player is the same guy who went 5th overall in the 2000 NBA draft. He’s the same guy who once averaged 19–5–4 on 46% from the field and 41% from deep as a borderline number-one option for an NBA team.\n\nThink about that for a second.\n\nAt one point in time, Mike Miller and future-hall-of-fame big man Pau Gasol took turns scoring 20 points on any given night. In 2007, Miller put up the numbers shown above, while Gasol averaged 21–10–3. Miller also had the following performances during that season:\n\n45–6–5 on 59% (9/17 from three)\n\n33–7–4 on 69% (6/11 from three)\n\n33–7–1 on 73% (9/12 from three)\n\n24–14–6 on 47% (14 being assists)\n\n29–11–7 on 67% (5/7 from three)\n\n25–12–5 on 53% (12 being rebounds, 5/7 from three)\n\n30–7–5 on 58% (3/9 from three)\n\nYeah. Mike Miller.\n\nThe typical NBA player isn’t just a typical player. A typical NBA player is one of the top 450 players in the world.\n\nMiller, who at age 40 decided to beat the shit out of top college recruits, didn’t suddenly re-gain his ability to play basketball. He was a decent NBA player, and decent NBA players are better at basketball than most people could ever imagine. That video of Miller demoralizing the D-1 players isn’t like when Mike Bibby’s unreal post-NBA-career gains went viral.\n\nTHAT was unexpected. And hilarious.\n\nBut former (and current) bucket-getter and sharpshooter Mike Miller beating a top college recruit in a 1-on-1 game? No, that isn’t surprising. It shouldn’t be, at least.\n\nThat video just shows the talent gap between NBA professionals and college could-be’s. College basketball is filled with potential NBA players who hope to one day make an impact on the biggest stage; the NBA is filled with the best college players who’ve already made it happen.\n\nThe gap is insurmountable. Mike Miller chose to go to Florida over Kentucky, North Carolina and Duke because he felt like it. You really thought he was going to lose to some college kid?\n\nCome on now.\n\nA “guy like Mike Miller” isn’t just a role player. Most “guys like Mike Miller” were once highly-sought-after as some of the best players in college basketball. Most “role players” in the NBA were once some of the best players the NCAA had to offer; JJ Redick averaged 27 at Duke; Doug McDermott averaged 27–7 at Creighton ; Shabazz Napier averaged 18–6–5 on a UConn team that won the national championship; Hasheem Thabeet put up 14–11 and 4.5 blocks at UConn 6 years prior; Shane Battier was the college player of the year in 2001 at Duke after averaging 20–7 with 2.1 steals and 2.3 blocks.\n\nThe leap from college basketball to the NBA is huge; the best college players aren’t always the best NBA players. However, anyone who lasts in the NBA is phenomenal at basketball. Mike Miller lasted forever. He’s a hooper.\n\nHe was an NBA player for Christ’s sake.\n\nAnd NBA players are incredibly good."
