        "text": "Three former NBA players — Tracy McGrady, Jermaine O’Neal and Mike Miller — who recently launched two separate agencies are representing players likely to be selected in the June NBA Draft.\n\nMcGrady, a seven-time All-Star, and O’Neal, a six-time All-Star, are close friends and launched Seven1 Sports & Entertainment Group during the pandemic. The agency is named for the jersey numbers they wore in the NBA. O’Neal wore No. 7 and McGrady wore No. 1.\n\nMiller, who played guard and forward for 17 years in the NBA, co-founded an agency called LIFT Sports Management and passed the National Basketball Players Association agent test last year. He is representing Duke forward Paolo Banchero, who is viewed as one of the best players available and could go No. 1 overall.\n\nMiller and partner Daniel Frank are representing several other players, including Wake Forest guard Alondes Williams, Duke forward Wendell Moore and Alabama guard JD Davison. LIFT is owned by Miller, Frank and Donnie McGrath, the former Providence and European basketball player.\n\nMiller, the No. 5 pick of the 2000 draft, was originally a client of former agent Arn Tellem, but switched to Dan Fegan and Frank after Tellem left the agent business to become vice chairman of Palace Sports & Entertainment in 2015. Fegan died in a car accident in 2018.\n\nMiller, who won two championships with the Miami Heat, retired in 2017 and worked as an assistant coach at the University of Memphis under Penny Hardaway. He began looking to do something different when the pandemic hit.\n\nFrank convinced Miller to be an agent. “I was one of many people that was essentially courting him, including team front office staff,” Frank said. One of the reasons Miller chose to become an agent is because, of other options, it would allow him to spend more time with his family, which he wanted to do after spending his life traveling during 17 NBA seasons, Frank said.\n\nThe fact that LIFT could represent multiple first-round prospects and another agency is led by two bona fide former NBA superstars has the agent business buzzing. It’s the latest twist in a cutthroat and conversely glamorous business that is always filled with drama.\n\nThe agent business has evolved from one-man (it is still primarily male-dominated) shops to mega agencies, to Hollywood getting involved when Creative Artists Agency started a sports division in 2007. The next wave happened when rap mogul Jay-Z entered the business followed by musical artist Lil Wayne and, more recently, Quality Control Music, which launched QC Sports.\n\nMany successful agents were former players in college or in the pros, but none really at the superstar level of McGrady and O’Neal. While some say it’s a new threat to the status quo, others say it won’t work.\n\n“It’s going to work; it’s going to work,” O’Neal said in a telephone interview last week. “I will tell you why. It’s just like any other business; it’s the people that made it work.”\n\nMcGrady and O’Neal are like brothers, as they became friends as teenagers and have stayed in touch post-playing days, talking once a week. They decided to launch the agency in 2020 and are representing their first draft class.\n\nGonzaga forward Drew Timme and Kansas forward Jalen Wilson, who led the Jayhawks to a national championship, head up Seven1’s draft class. The agency is also representing UNLV guard Donovan Williams, USC forward Chevez Goodwin, Portland State forward Khalid Thomas, Oklahoma State guard Avery Anderson and Texas Tech forward Kevin Obanor.\n\nMcGrady and O’Neal are not certified, but they hired veteran NBPA-certified agent Rich Gray and newly certified agent Deddrick Faison as agents, as well as attorney Hal Biagas as chief operating officer. Biagas worked at the NBPA, Wasserman and Excel Sports Management.\n\nMcGrady and O’Neal both got to know Biagas well because they, like Miller, were clients of former agent Tellem, who last worked at Wasserman before becoming an executive. O’Neal said he and McGrady have talked with Tellem about their agent business and he has given them advice. “He says, ‘It’s a tough business.’ He gave us some tools we could use. Arn is like a father figure to us.”\n\nBoth McGrady and O’Neal knew about the cutthroat nature of the business going in, but learned a lot of lessons firsthand in their first year of recruiting. And they also had to deal with another former NBA player as a competitor in Miller.\n\n“I think they actually have a pretty good, a really good, draft class this year,” O’Neal said of Miller’s agency. “They have two kids we were talking to. I am OK with saying that because that sparked the competitive part, that sparked me and Tracy’s inner competitor.”\n\nO’Neal said it “absolutely” helps that they are former star athletes because they understand athletes who aspire to be stars.\n\n“We wish nothing but the best for Mike,” O’Neal said. “He is a fellow alumni. In that part, you want to see him be successful. It’s no different than playing against him when he was on the Grizzlies or the Magic; we have a personal relationship with him. But we feel like we are going to go get it, not just against him, but every other agency, too.”"
