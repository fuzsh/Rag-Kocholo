        "text": "Memphis Grizzlies Acquire Mario Chalmers In Four-Player Deal\n\nOn November 10th, 2015, the Memphis Grizzlies traded guard Beno Udrih and forward Jarnell Stokes to the Miami Heat for guard Mario Chalmers and guard-forward James Ennis.\n\nAfter a painful and surprising NBA-worst 15-67 mark recorded during the 2007-08 season, the Miami Heat were in rebuild mode. The Heat selected forward Michael Beasley with the second pick of the draft. While that pick grabbed headlines, the Heat also added youth to their roster with the drafting of Kansas guard Mario Chalmers early in the second round after making a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nChalmers was fresh off of a 2008 National Championship at Kansas where he hit the game-tying three with 2.1 seconds left that took the final game to overtime. Kansas eventually prevailed and Chalmers was named Most Outstanding Player in the tournament.\n\nIn 2008 Summer League, Chalmers produced 15.8 PPG on 40% from the field, 2.0 RPG, 5.4 APG and 2.0 SPG in 26.8 MPG. He also signed a three-year contract with the Heat worth about $2.3 million. While coming in with a decorated college career, Chalmers’ NBA career got off to a rough start.\n\nDuring the September NBA Rookie Transition Program, Chalmers and former college teammate Darrell Arthur were both banished from the program and fined $20,000 for having guests in their hotel room. Security at the hotel where the event took place found Arthur and Chalmers in a room with two women, and the scent of marijuana was detected. No drugs or drug paraphernalia were found however.\n\nLater, Heat teammate and fellow rookie Michael Beasley was revealed to have been in the room, but hid this fact from NBA officials. Soon after, Beasley confessed his involvement in the situation at the behest of Pat Riley and was fined $50,000 by the NBA.\n\nA thin backcourt rotation allowed Chalmers to win the starting point guard spot over veterans Marcus Banks and Chris Quinn. Initially, the rookie impressed with a 17-point, 7-rebound and 8-assist performance in his debut against the New York Knicks. He later set the franchise record with 9 steals against the Philadelphia 76ers in early November. Chalmers would struggle later on, but still put together a solid rookie campaign.\n\nChalmers managed 10.0 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 4.9 APG and 2.0 SPG in 82 games (all starts) and 32.0 MPG. The 6′2″ led all rookies in steals and finished fourth in the NBA in steals per game. For his efforts Chalmers earned a spot on the NBA All-Rookie second team.\n\nThe Heat recovered from their down year and hovered around .500 for much of the 2008-09 season. They finished with a 43-39 record which was good enough for fifth best in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe fifth-seeded Heat entered a tough first round matchup with the fourth-seeded Atlanta Hawks in the first round. Atlanta took a 1-0 lead after a 90-64 rout, but the Heat won Games Two and Three to take a 2-1 series lead. Atlanta was victorious in Games Four and Five, before a Heat victory in Game Six evened the series at three games apiece.\n\nAtlanta eliminated Miami in Game Seven with a 91-78 win. Chalmers only cracked double figures in one of the seven games and produced just 7.3 PPG on 40% from the field, 2.7 RPG, 4.4 APG and 2.9 SPG in 33.0 MPG. After the season, a report surfaced that Chalmers had been fined several times for various unnamed violations of team rules.\n\nAfter a strong rookie year, Chalmers came into his sophomore campaign with a starting spot next to Dwyane Wade. After 22 starts, Chalmers was benched after showing up for practice late on several different occasions. Players like Carlos Arroyo and Rafer Alston took over the starting point guard spot as Chalmers fell into the background.\n\nFor his second year, Chalmers’ shooting numbers and overall stats declined. In 73 games (22 starts), he contributed 7.1 PPG, 1.8 RPG, 3.4 APG and 1.2 SPG in 24.8 MPG.\n\nMiami continued to stick around the middle of the Eastern Conference playoff picture. Mainly a .500 team, the Heat caught fire late and won 12 of their final 13 games to finish 47-35.\n\nThe Heat earned the fifth seed for the second consecutive year and battled the Boston Celtics in the first round. Miami had control in the first game with a 14-point third quarter lead, but Boston went on a 38-15 run the rest of the game to win Game One by 9 points.\n\nDespite facing the Celtics without Kevin Garnett in Game Two, the Heat were routed by 29 points. Boston took a 3-0 lead in Miami after Paul Pierce hit a buzzer-beating, game-winner.\n\nAfter Miami won Game Four behind the efforts of Dwyane Wade, the Celtics wrapped up the series with a 96-86 victory in Game Five. Chalmers played well in the five-game set with 10.8 PPG on 45% from the field in 26.1 MPG. After the season, Miami picked up the option on Chalmer’s contract for the 2010-11 season.\n\nThe Summer of 2010 was a landmark moment for the Heat. They managed to re-sign a free agent in Wade, but also agreed to contracts with top-flight free agents LeBron James and Chris Bosh. The new look Heat also added forward Mike Miller in free agency to round out an impressive offseason. The addition of James led Chalmers to switch his jersey number from 6 to 15.\n\nGoing instantly from playoff team to contender wasn’t easy for the Heat initially. Lofty expectations couldn’t prevent the team from getting off to a mildly disappointing 9-8 start. Soon, things would click as the Heat won 21 of their next 22 games to wind up 30-9.\n\nWhile there were a few hiccups, the Heat finished the season 58-24 and in second place in the Eastern Conference. Chalmers started slow after a high ankle sprain in the offseason limited him early on. He spent much of the year as a backup to Carlos Arroyo and Mike Bibby, but towards the end of the regular season he became a starter for 22 games. In 2010-11, the former Kansas Jayhawk contributed 6.4 PPG, 2.1 RPG, 2.5 APG and 1.1 SPG in 70 contests and 22.6 MPG.\n\nIn the postseason, the Heat faced the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round. Miami took the first three games of the series before Philadelphia won Game Four. The Heat closed out the series with a close 97-91 win in Game Five. Chalmers only scored 17 points in the first four games, but erupted for 20 points and six threes in the series finale.\n\nMiami entered a tough second round duel with the defending Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics. Miami built a 19-point lead in Game One and held on after a strong 38-point performance from Dwyane Wade and a surprise 25-point performance from veteran James Jones.\n\nIn Game Two, the Heat pulled away late to take a 2-0 lead. Boston responded in Game Three with a 17-point win. However, Celtics guard Rajon Rondo dislocated his elbow after getting tangled up with Dwyane Wade. Rondo didn’t miss any time, but the Celtics couldn’t regain any momentum as they lost in overtime to fall behind 3-1 in the series.\n\nIn Game Five, the Celtics held a lead, but fell apart in the fourth quarter as Miami won the series 4-1 and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. Outside of a 17-point outburst in Game Three, Chalmers never scored more than three points in the five-game matchup.\n\nMiami battled the Chicago Bulls in the Conference Finals and they were routed in the first game 103-82. The Heat rebounded and won the next four games to eliminate the Bulls and advance to the NBA Finals. In the final game, the Heat bounced back from a 12-point deficit with 3:53 left and went on a 19-4 run to conquer the Bulls. Chalmers shot well in the series (62.5%), but averaged just 5.6 PPG in 17.9 MPG.\n\nFor the 2011 NBA Finals, Miami was matched up with the Dallas Mavericks led by star Dirk Nowitzki. In Game One, the Heat outlasted Dallas 92-84 to take a 1-0 lead. The Mavs evened up the series after a rousing comeback that saw Dallas come from behind a 15-point deficit with just over seven minutes left in the fourth quarter.\n\nLate in Game Two, Dirk Nowitzki hit a three with 26.7 seconds left to give the Mavericks a 93–90 lead. Chalmers tied the game on a trey with 24.5 seconds left. Next, Nowitzki converted on a layup with 3.6 seconds left. Miami had no timeouts left, and Dwyane Wade’s potential game-winning three missed at the buzzer.\n\nAs the series shifted to Dallas, the Heat won 88-86 after a game-winning shot from Chris Bosh with 39.6 seconds left. However, Dallas came back to win the next three games and stun Miami in the NBA Finals.\n\nChalmers put together his most consistent performance in the Finals with 11.8 PPG on 42.6% shooting, 2.7 RPG, 3.5 APG and 1.7 SPG in 28.9 MPG. He even regained his starting point guard position from Mike Bibby for the final game of the series.\n\nAfter the season ended, the Heat extended a qualifying offer to Chalmers, making him a restricted free agent. The NBA lockout happened, and the Heat eventually agreed with Chalmers on a three-year, $12 million deal (team option in final year) after the lockout ended.\n\nComing into the 2011-12 season, Chalmers regained his spot as the starting point guard alongside Miami’s cast of superstars. However, he did face some competition from rookie guard Norris Cole. The Heat continued their strong play and with the addition of forward Shane Battier in free agency, deepened their rotation.\n\nMiami used an 8-1 start to propel them to a 46-20 mark throughout the lockout-shortened ‘11-‘12 campaign. They finished second in the East behind the Chicago Bulls and fourth overall in the NBA. In 64 games, Chalmers managed 9.7 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 3.5 APG and 1.5 SPG in 28.5 MPG.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Heat faced the New York Knicks in the first round. Miami took care of business and won the first three games by double figures. After a close Knicks victory in Game Four, Miami won 106-94 at home to close out the series. Chalmers put together a strong series with 11.8 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 4.0 APG and 1.6 SPG while shooting 41.7% from three.\n\nThe Semifinals would see the Heat matched up with the young upstart Indiana Pacers. Miami won Game One 95-86, but lost Chris Bosh to an abdominal strain for an extended amount of time. Game Two would be a challenge, as Miami fell behind in the middle of the second half. The Heat pulled close, but lost 78-75. Chalmers missed a three at the buzzer that would’ve sent the game into overtime.\n\nGame Three saw the Pacers dominate Miami 94-75 behind a strong performance from Roy Hibbert (19 points, 18 rebounds and 5 blocks). Facing a 2-1 deficit, Miami fell behind 9-0 to start Game Three and were down by as much as 10 points.\n\nMiami’s stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James took over as they scored all but two of Miami’s points in a 25-5 run in the second half. Miami ended up winning 101-93 and evened the series. Miami routed the Pacers 115-83 in Game Five and ended the series with a 105-93 victory in Game Six.\n\nWithout Bosh, the Heat entered into a tough Conference Finals matchup with the Boston Celtics. Miami built a double figure lead late in Game One and held on for a 93-79 victory. Game Two would be tight and go to overtime, but Miami took a 2-0 lead after winning 115-111 despite giving up 44 points, 8 rebounds and 10 assists to Celtics guard Rajon Rondo.\n\nBoston led by as much as 24 points in a 101-91 Game Three win and won Game Four in overtime by just two points. With the series knotted at 2 games apiece, Bosh returned from his injury for Game Five. A throwback 26-point and 11-rebound performance from Kevin Garnett was enough for Boston to prevail 94-90.\n\nFacing elimination on the road, LeBron James turned in a signature performance. The 6′8″ forward put up 45 points, 15 rebounds and 5 assists as the Heat handled Boston 98-79. Game Seven would go Miami’s way. The Heat fell behind by 11 points in the second quarter, but a strong fourth quarter propelled them to a 101-88 win and their second straight NBA Finals appearance.\n\nThe Heat Big Three combined for 73 of Miami’s 101 points in the final game. Through the series, Chalmers didn’t shoot particularly well from three (31%), but still managed 12.0 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 4.6 APG and 1.1 SPG in 38.1 MPG.\n\nMiami’s goal of a second championship in franchise history was close, but their obstacle was the Oklahoma City Thunder. In Game One, the Heat held a 13-point lead in the second quarter, but the Thunder bounced back to win 105-94 on the strength of 36 points from Kevin Durant.\n\nGame Two saw Miami build a 17-point advantage early on. The Thunder cut into the lead and eventually came within two points after a Kevin Durant three-pointer with 37 seconds left in the game. Durant had a chance to tie the game, but missed a contested pull-up and Miami held on to even the series.\n\nGame Three was relatively tight, but 29 points and 14 rebounds from LeBron James propelled Miami to a 91-85 win. After building a 2-1 lead, the Heat faced some adversity in Game Four as the Thunder built a 33-19 advantage after the first quarter. Miami caught up to OKC, and in the fourth quarter took the lead for good after a three-pointer from LeBron James.\n\nLater in that game, James suffered leg cramps and missed the final two minutes of the contest. Chalmers stepped up with 25 points including a clutch layup with 44.6 seconds left.\n\nGif via kietasss\n\nHe also knocked down two key free throws after an accidental foul by Russell Westbrook.\n\nWestbrook fouled Chalmers—after the Heat guard recovered a loose ball with 13.8 seconds left—thinking that the shot clock would reset, while NBA rules do not reset if the team that previously had the ball re-gains possession off the tip.\n\nMiami continued their dominance over Oklahoma City with a 121-106 rout that saw them lead by as much as 26 points. The Heat won the 2012 NBA Finals 4-1. It was the second championship in franchise history. Chalmers finished the Finals with 10.4 PPG, 2.6 RPG, 4.0 APG and 1.8 SPG in 36.5 MPG. He shot 44% on FGs and 35% on threes in that series.\n\nAfter Miami’s championship run, the Heat kept their core intact, but continued to deepen their roster with the offseason signings of veterans Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis. Miami compiled a collection of three-point shooters to spread the floor around James, Wade and Bosh.\n\nThe Heat got off to an excellent 12-3 start and continued to add even more depth with the in-season signing of Chris “Birdman” Andersen. Miami hit its stride in early February. At 29-14, the Heat went on a historic 27-game winning streak into late-March. The Heat won 37 of their final 39 regular season games to wind up with a franchise record 66 wins.\n\nChalmers was solid as a background player in Miami with a stat line of 8.6 PPG, 2.2 RPG, 3.5 APG and 1.5 SPG in 77 games and 26.9 MPG. Despite modest numbers, Chalmers cracked double figures in 24 contests including a 34-point, 10-trifecta performance against the Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Heat entered the postseason as the first seed in the East and faced the 38-44 Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. Despite Bucks guard Brandon Jennings’ prediction of Bucks in six, the Heat easily took care of the Bucks with a 4-0 sweep with all games being decided by double figures. Chalmers averaged 6.5 PPG (45.5% from the field) 3.0 RPG, 4.5 APG and 1.8 SPG in 28.6 MPG.\n\nIn the Semifinals, the Heat engaged in a physical battle with the Chicago Bulls. Chicago was without key rotation players Luol Deng and Kirk Hinrich, and missing former MVP Derrick Rose who was still in the process of recovery from a torn ACL from the previous season.\n\nDespite all of the injuries, Chicago stunned the Heat with a Game One, 93-86 victory in Miami. The Heat evened the series with a 37-point thrashing in Game Two. As the series scene shifted to Chicago, the Heat continued their momentum and took a 3-1 series lead after two double figure victories.\n\nGame Five featured multiple scoring swings from both teams. Miami jumped out to a 20-4 lead, but the Bulls hit back with a 47-25 run that game them a 53-47 lead at the half. Chicago built a ten-point lead late in the third, but Miami regained the lead midway through the fourth quarter and never relinquished it.\n\nWith Miami up 94-91 with 26.4 seconds left, Chicago’s Nate Robinson and Jimmy Butler missed possible game-tying three-pointers as Miami advanced to their third consecutive consecutive Eastern Conference Finals appearance. In the series, Chalmers managed 7.4 PPG (39.4% shooting), 2.2 RPG and 3.8 APG in 5 contests.\n\nMiami’s Eastern Conference Finals opponent became the Indiana Pacers after they vanquished the New York Knicks in six games. Known as a defensive juggernaut, Indiana would give the Heat everything they could handle.\n\nGame One was extremely competitive with neither team able to separate themselves. A three-pointer by Pacers forward Paul George tied the game with 0.7 seconds in regulation and a Ray Allen miss on the final possession sent the game into overtime.\n\nJames made a driving shot inside with 10.8 seconds left in overtime to give Miami a 101-99 lead. George was fouled on a three-point attempt by Dwyane Wade with 2.2 seconds left and subsequently made all three attempts to give Indiana a 102-101 lead. Indiana sat center Roy Hibbert to match up with Miami’s spread lineup in the final possession. James drove by George for a layup at the buzzer that gave Miami the win and a 1-0 series lead.\n\nGame Two was equally close, but the Pacers managed to win 103-99 with Hibbert dominating with 29 points and 10 rebounds. Miami took back homecourt advantage in Game Three with a 114-96 rout. In this contest, role players like Chalmers (14 points) and Udonis Haslem (17 points) contributed in the win.\n\nIndiana would even the series at two games apiece with a 99-92 victory. Miami used a 30-13 third quarter advantage in Game Four to pull away 90-79 and take a 3-2 series lead.\n\nFacing elimination, Indiana held on to win 91-77 with George and Hibbert combining for 52 points and 19 rebounds. In the final game of the series, Miami’s defense was too much for the Pacers as they built a 15-point lead at halftime and won 99-76. Chalmers was steady in the series with 11.3 PPG on 44.3% FG shooting and 2.7 APG in 27.7 MPG.\n\nThe Heat endured the ultimate test in the 2013 Finals with a very tough San Antonio Spurs team challenging them. In Game One, a jumper from Spurs guard Tony Parker sealed a 1-0 lead for the Spurs. The second contest saw the Spurs take a 58-56 lead with 5:54 left in the third quarter.\n\nMiami went on a 40-11 run through 12-plus minutes as they pulled away 103-84 to even the series. The game is best remembered for an amazing block from LeBron James on Spurs center Tiago Splitter. Chalmers led the Heat in scoring with 19 points.\n\nThe Spurs took a 2-1 lead after setting a record with 16 three-pointers made in a 113-77 rout. Chalmers was scoreless in 20 minutes. Miami’s Big Three of James, Wade and Bosh combined for 85 points as the Heat won 109-93 in Game Four.\n\nWith the series tied, the Spurs’ starters put together a dominant performance (107 combined points) in a 114-104 victory over Miami. The Heat faced elimination in Game Six, and came very close to succumbing to the Spurs.\n\nSan Antonio built a 75-65 lead at the end of the third quarter, but LeBron helped lead the Heat to a critical 20–7 run to start the fourth quarter. With 10:30 remaining, Mike Miller’s shoe came loose but he did not have time to put it back on so he tossed it off court; with one shoe on, Miller hit a three to pull the Heat within four.\n\nWith 2:09 remaining, the Heat took an 89–86 lead but Tony Parker converted on a stepback three and a reverse layup in consecutive possessions to put San Antonio ahead 91–89. James committed a turnover on Miami’s possession that was followed up by a pair of Manu Ginobili free throws after an intentional foul from Heat guard Ray Allen. Down 93-89, James committed another turnover and Ginobili was fouled again by Allen.\n\nGinobili made one of two free-throws to give the Spurs a 94-89 advantage. League officials brought out yellow tape to cordon off the floor for the Larry O'Brien Trophy presentation.\n\nFacing a considerable deficit with limited time, James missed a three-pointer, but Dwyane Wade and Ray Allen both kept the ball alive. Mike Miller recovered the rebound and passed to James, who made the three-pointer to pull within two points with 20 seconds left.\n\nMiami was forced to foul forward Kawhi Leonard. Leonard missed one of two foul attempts. Still behind 95-92, James missed a 26-foot jumper from beyond the arc. Chris Bosh was able to collect a key offensive rebound before passing to Ray Allen, who took a step back to the three-point line and nailed a trifecta from the right corner with 5.2 seconds left to send the game into overtime. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich took Spurs center Tim Duncan off the court and went with a small lineup which played a part in Miami picking up those two offensive rebounds.\n\nThe Spurs had no timeouts left after Allen’s shot, but received time to draw up a play due to the video review that confirmed that Allen had both feet behind the three-point line when he released the ball. Tony Parker was able to drive the length of the court, but his shot over LeBron James fell short, sending the game to overtime.\n\nIn the extra session, James converted on a floater with 1:43 left to give the Heat a 101-100 advantage. The score would stay the same down the stretch. After a Wade miss, the Spurs had the ball with 12 seconds left. Spurs guard Manu Ginobili was stripped by Ray Allen. Allen recovered the ball, and the Spurs fouled the veteran with 1.9 seconds left. Allen made both free throws to put the Heat up 103-100. San Antonio still had a chance to tie, but Chris Bosh blocked a potential game-tying, three-pointer from Danny Green.\n\nWith the series coming down to a final Game Seven, the game would be close throughout. After a three-pointer by Kawhi Leonard, the Spurs trailed by just two with 50 seconds remaining. San Antonio came close, but Duncan, guarded by Shane Battier, missed a game-tying shot under the basket and a follow-up tip-in attempt. LeBron converted on a perimeter jump shot with 27.9 seconds left that gave Miami its second consecutive championship.\n\nThe third NBA Finals appearance for Chalmers was a mixed bag. Overall, the Kansas product shot just 38.8% from the field with 10.6 PPG, but he came up with two solid performances in the final two games of the seven-game set. Right after, the Heat picked up the team option on Chalmers.\n\nDuring the 2013 NBA Draft, the Heat acquired swingman James Ennis from the Atlanta Hawks for a protected future second round draft pick. The Long Beach State product joined the Heat in 2013 Summer League and averaged 13.3 PPG and 4.5 RPG in 11 games.\n\nMiami couldn’t commit to Ennis for a roster spot due to luxury tax concerns. They preferred for Ennis to go to the NBA D-League, but he chose to play in Australia to help out his family financially. Throughout the 2013-14 campaign, he played with Perth of the NBL (21.2 PPG and 7.2 RPG) and with Pirata de Quebradillas in Puerto Rico (16.6 PPG and 8.2 RPG).\n\nIn Miami’s next season, they would be heavily tested by the Indiana Pacers who looked to gain homecourt advantage in the East for a potential Conference Finals showdown.\n\nThe Heat continued to dominate the East with an early 14-3 start. Miami lost Dwyane Wade for large chunks of the season with a balky knee. They finished the season 54-28 which was good for second best in the east behind the 56-26 Pacers. Chalmers entered the season in tip-top shape and put together his finest season as a pro with 9.8 PPG and 1.6 SPG and career-highs of 2.9 RPG, 4.9 APG and a 14.0 PER.\n\nMiami entered the 2014 postseason as a heavy favorite to make the NBA Finals for a fourth consecutive time. The Heat were positioned as the second seed and faced the seventh-seeded Charlotte Bobcats in the first round. Charlotte gave the Heat a fight, but couldn’t overcome the talent disparity as Miami swept them in four games. Chalmers managed 9.0 PPG, 2.5 RPG and 3.5 APG in the four-game series.\n\nIn the Semifinals, the Heat faced the 44-38 Brooklyn Nets. Brooklyn had swept Miami in the regular season, 4-0. Miami won the first two games at home by double digits to take a 2-0 lead. The Nets hit 15 threes in a Game Three victory to make the series 2-1.\n\nLeBron James scored 49 points in Game Four as the Heat took a 3-1 lead heading back to American Airlines arena. In Game Five, the Nets would build a nine-point lead in the fourth quarter, but the Heat would answer back and take a late 93-91 lead behind a Ray Allen three with 32 seconds left. Miami held on to the game after James knocked the ball loose from Joe Johnson on the final possession.\n\nAfter the 96-94 win, the Heat advanced to the Conference Finals. Chalmers had a relatively quiet Semifinals with 7.2 PPG on 41.9% from the field and 4.6 APG in 30.0 MPG. As expected, the Heat faced the Indiana Pacers in the Conference Finals for the second consecutive year. This time, the Pacers would have homecourt advantage after making it a priority throughout the regular season.\n\nIndiana used a balanced attack from their starting lineup to propel them to a 107-96, Game One victory. Miami stole the homecourt edge with a Game Two win in a low-scoring, 87-83 contest. The Pacers jumped out to a 37-22 lead in the second quarter of the third game, but Miami went on to outscore Indiana 77-50 the rest of the way to take a 2-1 lead. The Heat used a combined 57 points from LeBron James and Chris Bosh to defeat Indiana 102-90 in Game Four.\n\nFacing elimination and a 10-point deficit early in the second half, Indiana bounced back and — behind 37 points from Paul George — captured Game Five 93-90. The series would end in Game Six when Miami routed Indiana 117-92. Chalmers didn’t crack double figures scoring at all in the series and managed just 5.7 PPG on 48.3% shooting and 3.5 APG in 27.7 MPG.\n\nMiami made the NBA Finals for the fourth year in a row and faced the San Antonio Spurs in the final round for the second consecutive time. Game One’s outcome involved a Spurs win after a malfunctioning air-conditioning system in the AT&T Center caused temperatures in the arena to reach up to 90 °F in the second half. The conditions caused LeBron James to dehydrate and suffer cramps, limiting him to just five minutes in the fourth quarter. With James on the bench, San Antonio went on a 15–4 run, and outscored the Heat 36–17 in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn Game Two, Miami fell behind by 11 points but came back to win a tight game 98-96 on the strength of 35 points and 10 rebounds from LeBron James. Miami carried momentum and homecourt advantage into Game Three, but the Spurs would quickly take back both.\n\nSan Antonio jumped out to a 41-25 first quarter lead. The Spurs led by as much as 25 points in the first half. Miami did cut the lead to 7 points late in the third period, but the Spurs never lost their advantage and won 111-92 to take a 2-1 advantage.\n\nGame Four saw the Spurs continue to dissect the Heat with precise ball movement and build another 20-point lead in the first half. This time, Miami would not threaten and the Spurs held on to a 107-86 lead. Facing elimination, Miami built a 22-6 early edge, but San Antonio went on a 37-13 run and coasted to their first NBA championship since 2007. Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard (17.8 PPG and 6.4 RPG) took home Finals MVP honors.\n\nChalmers had a terrible Finals showing with just 22 points in the five-game series. He was benched by the Heat in the fifth and final game with veteran Ray Allen taking his spot.\n\nAfter the disheartening Finals loss, Miami was expected to undergo multiple changes. What they couldn’t have expected was the Decision Part II. After leaving Cleveland to join Miami in 2010, James chose to make his return to Cleveland through a magazine interview with Sports Illustrated’s Lee Jenkins.\n\nMiami also lost another part of their Big Three in Chris Bosh as he flirted with the Houston Rockets. Bosh eventually decided to return to Miami, and the Heat also re-signed Dwyane Wade to keep most of their core intact. There were questions of whether the Heat would re-sign Chalmers after his terrible playoff showing, but they eventually agreed with the guard on a two-year contract worth $8.3 million.\n\nForward Shane Battier retired and guard Ray Allen decided not to return, leaving his NBA future in question. Replacing James was a tough task, and the Heat signed veteran Luol Deng to take James’ place in the starting lineup. They had also signed veterans Danny Granger and Josh McRoberts before James’ official departure.\n\nEnnis rejoined the Heat for 2014 Summer League and had a strong showing with 15.5 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 1.5 APG and 1.3 SPG in 6 appearances. He subsequently signed a multi-year deal with the Heat.\n\nThe new look Heat seemed to be destined for playoff competition and a 5-2 start was encouraging. Injuries would define Miami’s season. Wade missed 20 games due to various ailments and Bosh missed close to half of the season after being diagnosed with a blood clot on his lung.\n\nMiami was in a season of change as virtual unknown Hassan Whiteside rose to a starting position at center and the team also acquired guard Goran Dragic from Phoenix ahead of the trade deadline. Through all of the change, Miami was in the playoff race, but fell short by one game with a 37-45 record.\n\nChalmers started off the year as a backup combo guard to Norris Cole, but regained the spot after Cole struggled. When Miami acquired Dragic, Chalmers moved back to his backup guard role.\n\nThe former Jayhawk had a rough shooting season with career lows in three-point percentage (29.4%) and effective field goal percentage (45.8%). In 80 games (37 starts), Chalmers contributed 10.2 PPG, 2.6 RPG, 3.8 APG and 1.5 SPG in 29.6 MPG. Ennis was a part of the Miami rotation for much of the year. He participated in 62 games and amassed 5.0 PPG, 2.8 RPG and 0.8 APG in 17.0 MPG.\n\nIn the Summer of 2015, Ennis joined Miami’s Summer League team for the third consecutive year. He produced 8.7 PPG and 5.0 RPG in 7 appearances. Coming into the 2015-16 season, Chalmers underwent minor surgery to correct an inflamed Plica in his right knee. He was penciled in as a reserve to Dragic.\n\nWith young guards Tyler Johnson and Josh Richardson both vying for minutes in the backcourt, Chalmers became an obvious choice to be moved with his larger contract and Miami’s urgent need to cut their luxury tax bill. His name popped up in trade rumors with the Grizzlies ahead of his eventual move.\n\nChalmers was averaging 5.5 PPG on 31.3% shooting, 2.3 RPG, 3.2 APG and 1.3 SPG in 6 games before the trade. Ennis was essentialy a throw-in and had only received seven minutes of playing time before the trade.\n\nChalmers ended his lengthy run in Miami with numerous highlights. Once a starter as a rookie, he became a reserve only to regain his starting spot back early on in Miami’s formation of the Big 3. Unbridled confidence led to funny quotes like the time that Chalmers said that he was on the front-end of the top 10 players at his position.\n\nTeammate Dwyane Wade recognized that bravado and crystallized how Chalmers’ confidence works (via Sun-Sentinel):\n\n“Mario has that thing, that thing called heart. No matter what, no matter how tough we are on him, he actually thinks he’s the best player on this team. That’s a gift and a curse. (Thursday), it was a gift for us because he never gets down on himself. He always believes, ‘Find me, I can make a shot. I can make a play.’”\n\nThat confidence also ended up with one of the Big 3 scolding Chalmers at some point.\n\nGif via FTW\n\nChalmers had his moments of success like the 2012 Finals, but also several poor performances like his erratic stretch in the 2014 postseason highlighted his sometimes good (Mario) and sometimes bad (Wario) status. The point guard had a stat line of 8.8 PPG, 2.4 RPG, 3.8 APG and 1.5 SPG in 525 contests. He shot 42% from the field, 36% on threes and 78% on free-throws in that time span.\n\nEnnis ended his Heat stint with 4.8 PPG, 2.7 RPG and 0.8 APG in 65 contests. He shot 41% from the field, 33% from three and 84% from the free-throw line in that time.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies originally claimed Beno Udrih off of waivers in late February of 2014 after he underwent a rough half season with the New York Knicks. With point guard depth behind Mike Conley being a major issue, the veteran presence of Udrih was useful. He had a minor role the rest of the regular season (2.7 PPG and 0.6 APG in 10 games) as Memphis finished the 2013-14 campaign with a 50-32 mark.\n\nAfter primary backup Nick Calathes was suspended heading into the postseason, Udrih’s role increased. In the first round, Memphis faced the Oklahoma City Thunder and their star tandem of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.\n\nGame One saw the Thunder build a 25-point lead in the first half. Memphis made a huge second half run and even got within 2 points after a Mike Miller three-pointer with 8:46 left in the fourth quarter. The Thunder went on a 26-14 run the rest of the way to win 100-86.\n\nThe Grizzlies held a lead for much of the second game, but were never able to create much separation. Memphis led 98-93 with 18 seconds left, but the Thunder managed to take the game to overtime after a wild Kevin Durant four-point play and a putback from Kendrick Perkins at the buzzer in regulation. In overtime, the Grizzlies prevailed by scoring the final 6 points after the game was tied at 105 apiece with 35 seconds left in the extra period.\n\nWith the series tied, Memphis had momentum as they came home for Game Three. They put together a solid first half and built a 71-54 lead late in the third quarter. OKC put together a strong finish and came back from the 17-point deficit. The score was 85-81 when Russell Westbrook converted a four-point play with 27 seconds that tied the game and eventually sent it into overtime. In the extra gameplay, Marc Gasol and Mike Conley combined for 9 of Memphis’ 13 points as the Grizzlies won 98-95.\n\nGame Four would involve the Thunder building a lead for much of the game. OKC had a 64-52 advantage going into the fourth quarter, but Memphis got back into it with a 28-11 run. Facing an 80-75 deficit and a possible 3-1 series situation, Thunder guard Reggie Jackson provided a spark with 5 consecutive points in the final 1:20 that sent the game into overtime with the score at 80. Jackson continued his special night (32 points) with 8 of the Thunder’s 12 overtime points as the Thunder evened the series at 2 games apiece.\n\nMemphis and the Thunder took their close competition back to OKC for Game Five. The Grizzlies built a 72-52 lead with 3:43 left. Oklahoma City stormed back with a 27-6 run over the next 8:57 of gameplay. In the final moments of regulation and the Thunder down by two, Russell Westbrook picked Mike Conley’s pocket and coasted to a dunk with 4 seconds left that would send the game into overtime for an NBA record fourth consecutive time.\n\nMike Miller hit two threes early in the extra frame for Memphis. The Grizzlies had a 100-98 lead with 28 seconds left when Kevin Durant was fouled by Tony Allen. He made the first free-throw, but missed the second one. After a Mike Miller miss with 4 seconds left, OKC had an opportunity to win the game. Durant missed a three, and Serge Ibaka couldn’t convert on an offensive rebound in time as Memphis took a 3-2 series lead.\n\nFacing elimination, the Thunder eliminated any chance of a close contest with a 104-84 rout in Game Six. The Grizzlies would go in to Game Seven shorthanded as Zach Randolph was suspended for striking Thunder center Steven Adams in the fourth quarter of the previous game.\n\nMemphis built an early double digit lead in the first quarter of Game Seven. The Thunder responded with a 44-19 run from the second quarter into the third quarter. The Grizzlies could never seriously threaten again as the Thunder advanced to the West Semifinals with a 120-109 win.\n\nIn the 2014 NBA Draft, the Grizzlies acquired Jarnell Stokes from the Utah Jazz after Stokes was selected with the 35th pick. The former Tennessee Volunteer joined the team for Summer League in Orlando and had a solid showing with 12.2 PPG and 9.4 RPG in 5 contests. Udrih re-signed with Memphis on a two-year, $4.2 million deal.\n\nThe Grizzlies would be an early surprise during the 2014-15 season with a 15-2 start. At one point the team was 21-4 and just half a game away from the best record in the NBA. Memphis cooled off and went 8-8 in their next 16 games. After an 8-game winning streak, the Grizzlies were second in the West with a 37-12 mark. They slightly fell down the Western Conference standings with an 18-15 mark over the final 33 games. This left them in the fifth seed.\n\nUdrih had a solid year in Memphis. He became the permanent backup with Calathes still out early due to his suspension. The veteran guard contributed 7.7 PPG, 1.8 RPG, 2.8 APG and 0.6 SPG in 79 games (12 starts) and 18.9 MPG. Udrih also continued to feast off of the midrange with 37.7% of his points coming from the midrange area according to the NBA Stats page (11th best among players that played 50 games).\n\nStokes spent much of his rookie season on the pine or in the D-League. He was assigned six times by the Grizzlies to their affiliate, the Iowa Energy (15.1 PPG and 11.3 RPG in 23 contests). Stokes participated in 19 games with Memphis and managed 3.0 PPG and 1.8 RPG in 6.6 MPG.\n\nEntering the postseason, the fifth-seeded Grizzlies faced the number four seed Portland Trail Blazers. Despite being the lower seed, the Grizzlies earned homecourt advantage since they had a better overall record than Portland (51-31).\n\nThe Blazers had limped to the finish line with numerous injuries. They lost one of thir core players in Wesley Matthews after he ruptured his achilles tendon in early March. Backup and key midseason addition Arron Afflalo came into the postseason with a shoulder injury and stars LaMarcus Aldridge and Nicolas Batum dealt with nagging injuries all year.\n\nMemphis attacked Portland early on as the series got underway. By the end of the first quarter, Memphis had a double figure lead. The Grizzlies led by as much as 29 points and finished with a 1-0 lead after a 100-86 victory. Udrih was hot from the time he checked in. In about four minutes of time, Udrih scored 13 points in a first half stretch and finished the game with 20 points and 7 assists.\n\nGame Two was a similar contest as Memphis stymied the Blazers (39% on FGs and 30% on three-point attempts). The Grizzlies built a double digit lead again on their way to a 97-82 win. Udrih had another solid game with 10 points in 18:44 of action, but he sprained his right ankle.\n\nMemphis had another big lead in Game Three as the series scene shifted to Portland. The Blazers did cut the lead to three points late in the fourth, but the Grizzlies held on for a 115-109 victory and a gained a vicegrip hold on the series with a 3-0 lead. Unfortunately for Memphis, starter Mike Conley suffered a facial fracture near his left eye in Game Three and would miss the rest of the first round.\n\nIt seemed like Memphis would cruise to a 4-0 sweep after building a ten-point advantage with 8:48 left in regulation. The Trail Blazers went on a 29-12 run to win the game 99-92, and make the series 3-1. Memphis closed out the series with a tight 99-93 victory behind 46 combined points from Marc Gasol and Courtney Lee. Udrih played in four games and managed 11.8 PPG on 48.7% shooting, 3.0 RPG and 3.0 APG in 20.5 MPG.\n\nAfter their series victory, the Grizzlies entered a tough second round matchup with the best team in the NBA, the Golden State Warriors. Without Conley in the lineup for Game One, Golden State built a 20-point lead before settling on a 101-86 outcome. Conley made his return for Game Two and his impact was noticeable. The star guard had 22 points on 8-for-12 shooting as Memphis evened the series with a 97-90 win. Conley’s performance was impressive because his injury was a serious ordeal.\n\nThe Grizzlies continued to fluster the Warriors in Game Three at Memphis. They led the Warriors for much of the game and ended with a 99-89 win after a combined 43 points and 23 rebounds from Memphis’ bigs Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol.\n\nWith the series 2-1 and MVP Stephen Curry struggling at 15-40 from the field and 4-for-21 on threes in the previous two games, the Warriors had to regroup. First, Curry and Draymond Green decompressed with a nice meal at Blues City Cafe on Beale Street. Second, the team altered their strategy heading into Game Four. Coach Steve Kerr had center Andrew Bogut guard Tony Allen since the Grizzlies guard was a limited shooter.\n\nThe strategy shift and hot shooting from Curry (33 points) shifted all of the momentum as Golden State won in a laugher 101-84. Games Five (98-78) and Six (108-95) followed similar scripts as the Warriors managed to claw out of the 2-1 hole and eliminate Memphis with three consecutive wins.\n\nUdrih couldn’t find his footing in the series. He shot just 35.3% from the field and averaged 4.8 PPG in 15.5 MPG. Stokes did not play in the postseason.\n\nThe Grizzlies were able to keep much of their roster intact after successfully re-signing Marc Gasol. They did sign center Brandan Wright and acquired forward Matt Barnes in a trade. In the offseason, Udrih had surgery on his right ankle.\n\nDuring the 2015-16 season, the Grizzlies got off to a rough 3-5 start in their first 8 games. They had several bad losses including a 30-point loss in their season opener to Cleveland and a 50-point loss to Golden State. At this point, the team decided to acquire Mario Chalmers from Miami to shore up shoddy bench play. Udrih played in 8 games (5.9 PPG) and Stokes only played a total of four minutes when the trade happened. Udrih ended his Grizzlies tenure with 7.0 PPG, 1.6 RPG, 2.6 APG and 0.5 SPG in 97 contests. He shot 48% on FGs and 86% on FTs in that tie.\n\nAfter the trade, Chalmers enjoyed a mini-renaissance in Memphis as a backup to Mike Conley. He was thrust into a starting role in early March after the Grizzlies roster was decimated with injuries. Ennis was shuffled in between the main roster and Memphis’ D-League affiliate, the Iowa Energy (18.8 PPG & 6.0 RPG). The Grizzlies waived Ennis so they could pick up center Ryan Hollins to fill the void left by injuries to Marc Gasol and Brandan Wright.\n\nEnnis finished his brief Grizzlies run with 1.6 PPG in 10 games. After being waived, Ennis was picked up by the New Orleans Pelicans on a 10-day contract and eventually signed for the rest of the season. In the 2016 offseason, Ennis signed a two-year deal to rejoin the Grizzlies.\n\nChalmers’ season was cut short after tearing his achilles in a March 9 game against the Boston Celtics. The guard was waived by the Grizzlies as the franchise needed able bodies to fill in for their growing list of injured players. He finished his Memphis run with career highs of 10.8 PPG and 18.0 PER along with 2.6 RPG, 3.8 APG and 1.5 SPG in 22.8 MPG.\n\nBeno Udrih arrived in Miami and spent much of his time in a reserve role. He was in and out of the rotation up until late February when he broke his foot. When Miami negotiated a deal with recent Brooklyn Nets buyout Joe Johnson, the Heat were likely to pass the luxury tax threshold.\n\nThe Heat went to Udrih and asked for a buyout that would allow them to save money by falling beneath the luxury tax. Udrih agreed to the deal and still worked out in Miami’s training facility while he was out for the rest of the season. The veteran guard produced 4.4 PPG, 1.8 RPG and 2.5 APG in 36 games and 16.3 MPG.\n\nMiami actually had interest in Stokes before he was drafted. They planed to work out Stokes, but he suffered a concussion in a car crash that prevented the scheduled workout from happening.\n\nStokes was shuffled in and out of the D-League while with the Heat. The 6′7″ big man played for D-League affiliate the Sioux Fall Skyforce (20.6 PPG and 9.3 RPG). Stokes only played in 5 games with the Heat (1.4 PPG and 0.4 RPG) before being traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in a salary dump move ahead of the trade deadline.\n\nIn the 2016 offseason, the Heat returned the favor to Udrih by signing him to a one-year fully guaranteed deal at the veteran’s minimum. At the end of preseason, Udrih was waived as guard Rodney McGruder obtained the 15th and final roster spot in Miami. Days later, the Detroit Pistons claimed Udrih off of waivers.\n\nMario Chalmers on joining the Memphis Grizzlies (via the Commercial Appeal):\n\n“I’m definitely playing with a chip on my shoulder, especially with the way everything went down in Miami. I’m just licking my chops at this new opportunity and I’m ready to help the Grizzlies start winning.”\n\nHow he could help:\n\n“I can just help out on defense and with shooting. After watching the game (Wednesday night), you can see they have a lot of outside shooters, but we have to start making shots as a team. Everybody has to be confident shooting the ball.”\n\nOn getting booed by Memphis fans from his days as a college player with the Kansas Jayhawks:\n\n“I’ve been getting booed for seven years. Let bygones be bygones. Let’s just move on. I’m a Memphis Grizzly now. I’m here to help the team. I’m here to help the community and bring smiles and a friendly face.”\n\nBeno Udrih on the Heat offense (via Sun Sentinel):\n\n“Our offense is pretty much a lot of reading and cutting to the basket and trying to get somebody else open. It’s pretty self-explanatory. I’ve been on a lot of teams. Every team pretty much plays differently on defense and offense. I’ve pretty much seen it all.”\n\nOn adjusting to a new setting:\n\n“Otherwise, coming here and playing basketball, that’s just basketball. I’ve been doing that for a long time. I’m just trying to learn the system as fast as I can.”\n\nJarnell Stokes on catching up with former college teammate and current Heat guard Josh Richardson after the trade (via Heat.com):\n\n“The first day I was here, we were supposed to go out to eat, but I had a 6AM physical so the next day we caught up right after practice. It’s a great experience just having a former teammate here. He knows how I play; I know how he plays. He knows the organization well, so I’m able to ask him questions.”\n\nMemphis Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace on acquiring Chalmers and Ennis (via Memphis Commercial Appeal):\n\n“We just felt that this was a chance to get a guy in Mario Chalmers who is an upgrade as a 3-point shooter, particularly in the playoffs. And you get a little younger. He’s been in the top 10 in steals percentage. He’s not afraid to step up and take the big shot. It’s an opportunity we had to take. It’s also an opportunity to take a look at a young, athletic guy in James Ennis.”\n\nMiami Heat president of basketball operations Pat Riley on the trade (via Miami Herald):\n\n“This is a tough day for myself and the organization in trading Mario Chalmers and James Ennis. Mario was a part of two championships with us and Ennis is a solid young player, but it is part of the business and it was a move necessary to make because of our crowded backcourt.”\n\nGrizzlies head coach Dave Joerger on the addition of Chalmers (via Memphis Commercial Appeal):\n\n“Any time you have additions, it brings a new energy. We’re expecting (Chalmers) to give us some energy. We want him to defend and shoot shots that are there. He’s been a big-shot maker. He’ll fit nicely with that second group. He’s going to have a role here. We’re very excited to have him.”\n\nHeat head coach Erik Spoelstra on the trade (via Miami Herald):\n\n“We’re excited about the trade. It cleans up a lot of things with our backcourt. We also add an experienced veteran point guard that we think will fit into how we want to play.\n\n“It doesn’t mean that it makes it easy to make these kind of deals. Rio can hold his head high leaving on a great note here. He will always be remembered as a two-time champion point guard here in Miami, always welcomed here in Miami from here on out.”\n\nHow the trade clears up Miami’s roster situation:\n\n“I think it gives us a lot of clarity.”\n\nOn Udrih (via Sun Sentinel):\n\n“He’ll fit in because we like him. He’s got veteran savviness about him. You saw it the other night. He hasn’t been in a practice. He hasn’t been in a shootaround but he’s played for enough different systems that he can just play basketball. You don’t notice things that you might have because he’s a veteran player. You can throw him in any situation. Guys like that are very valuable with veteran teams.”\n\nGrizzlies guard Mike Conley on the addition of Chalmers (via Memphis Commercial Appeal):\n\n“He’s a very good shooter who can control the tempo. He’s just solid all around and that’s what we need in our lineup.”\n\nHeat guard Goran Dragic on his relationship with fellow Slovenian Beno Udrih (via Sun Sentinel):\n\n“We talk. We went to dinner when I was in his town. It’s always awesome to catch a fellow Slovenian in the same league. It’s not a lot Slovenian players here.”\n\nOn Udrih’s experience:\n\n“This is his 12th year in the league. He knows everything.”\n\nOn Udrih’s experience through the lens of team success:\n\n“He’s already [won] a championship with San Antonio so he’s got a lot of experience. Of course, that’s good minutes. He’s a really decent player; he can play and he’s a great court leader who makes the right plays and he brings you that calmness.”\n\nHeat guard Dwyane Wade on Chalmers and the early success Chalmers experienced after the trade (via Sun Sentinel):\n\n“He was in on the jokes of the locker room. He’s one of those guys, he’s just funny. He’s a guy, even though he’s stubborn, he’s a guy who has taken the time to ask questions, has tried to learn. He would tell me, ‘I need help. Won’t you help me here?’\n\n“You like guys like that. He’s just a good person. It’s no surprise to me at all that the guys in Memphis are seeing how great of a teammate Mario is.”\n\nHow Chalmers’ style of play is different in the Western Conference:\n\n“His style of play is probably more Western Conference than Eastern Conference. His ability to be able to gamble defensively and do all the things he’s able to do, that’s more Western Conference. And then offensively, it’s given him the freedom to just play, with a team that needs his scoring ability.”\n\nHis relationship with Chalmers post-trade:\n\n“I talk to him all the time. I just don’t see him, but I talk to him the same. Certain teammates and certain people, they come and go. We have a special relationship.”\n\nHeat forward Chris Bosh on the reaction Chalmers would expect upon his return to Miami (via Sun Sentinel):\n\n“Standing ovation. He’s one of the longest-tenured Heat players, two championships, a bunch of steals, a bunch of good times, a bunch of bad times.”\n\nHeat forward Udonis Haslem on Chalmers (via Sun Sentinel):\n\n“Obviously he’s going to be a free agent this summer, so he goes to a good Western Conference team with a chance to make the playoffs. He gets to play consistent minutes and gets to be more of who he is as a basketball player and puts himself in a good position this summer.”\n\nHeat center Chris Andersen on what Chalmers was about (via Sun Sentinel):\n\n“Being vocal, always in topics of conversations. He was a great teammate and a great person off the floor, as well.”\n\nHeat guard Josh Richardson on Stokes’ strengths as a player (via Heat.com):\n\n“[I think his biggest strength is] his body. He’s a huge, physical presence. He’s a tenacious rebounder. Even today (Saturday) at practice he had a couple of big rebounds and put-backs.”\n\nRelated Tweets\n\nImage Credit:\n\nBeno Udrih: Getty Images/Mike Ehrmann\n\nJarnell Stokes: Getty Images/Ned Dishman\n\nJames Ennis: Getty Images/Joe Murphy"
