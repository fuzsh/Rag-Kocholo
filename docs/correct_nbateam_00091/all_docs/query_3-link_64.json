        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS — The second time was the charm.\n\nThe Nuggets and Mike Miller had eyes for each other last summer. But Cleveland had a bigger bouquet of flowers – the promise of a role alongside superstar LeBron James on a potential title team. So, he signed with the Cavs.\n\nNow, though, Miller is a Nugget, signed by Denver on Wednesday night. Cleveland, which needed extra fire power off the bench, barely used Miller in the NBA Finals, then traded him to Portland this summer. Miller, 35, reached a buyout agreement with Portland earlier this week. The Nuggets wasted no time snapping him up.\n\n“I’m excited,” Miller said here Thursday. “I’ve always had a great relationship with this organization. I think they do a great job. The fans in Denver are fantastic, which makes it exciting. We’ve got this young team, which they continue to build, and hopefully we’ll have a successful season.”\n\nThe 6-foot-8, 218-pound Miller practiced with the Nuggets for the first time on Wednesday night. While it was a quick turnaround from having cut ties with the Trail Blazers, Miller wouldn’t have minded if it had been even faster.\n\n“You never want to be late to the action, playing catch up is always tough,” he said. “But, being here and being a part of this, and getting to see the atmosphere here in training camp, at least a couple of practices before we play a game (Friday), which is crazy. But it’s good and I’m excited to be here.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNuggets coach Michael Malone is happy to have him. Outside of the benefits of employing a career 40.7 percent 3-point shooter, the Nuggets are getting another player who is known for his professionalism. In 15 seasons in the NBA, Miller has averaged 11.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists for Orlando, Memphis, Minnesota, Washington, Miami and Cleveland.\n\n“The first impression of Mike Miller is you’re getting a guy that’s a two-time world champion,” Malone said. “A former Rookie of the Year, who has been around greatness and knows what it takes. I think anytime you can add a guy like that to go along with a Jameer Nelson, Randy Foye, to be great veterans for our young guys, and that’s not even talking about him as a player.\n\n“Now, on the court, you have a guy that is a deadly shooter, made big shots in big games, and we’re just really, really excited to have him.”\n\nMiller’s first impressions of his new team?\n\n“It’s young, there are going to be growing pains, it’s how it always is,” he said. “But we’ve got a lot of solid, good pieces. The coaching staff is great, which makes things enjoyable. For us it’s just focusing on what we have to do, be better everyday and control the things we can control.”\n\nMiller’s role has yet to be defined, but he said he’s looking to help however he can.\n\n“And I’ve told them that from the beginning,” he said. “I think my job right now is to be the best teammate I can be, and be easily coached. Whatever falls in place, you know, making shots and doing those things I think I’m capable of doing. But we have a lot of young talent here, and however I can help I’m going to help.”"
