        "text": "Memphis Grizzlies' star Ja Morant has a new agent. And it's a familiar name.\n\nLift Sports Management, which is run by former NBA player Mike Miller, announced Thursday morning that Morant has signed with them. He needed a new agent after he split from Jim Tanner earlier this month.\n\nThe move was announced by a video Lift posted on social media. Morant retweeted the video from his account.\n\nMiller is well-known in Memphis. He played for the Grizzlies for two stints during an 18-year NBA career, then became an assistant coach on Penny Hardaway's Memphis staff after he retired. He served as head coach at Houston High School before becoming a sports agent.\n\nMorant is coming off a 2023-24 season in which he barely featured for the Grizzlies. He was suspended for the first 25 games because of conduct detrimental to the league, then returned in December and played only nine games before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury.\n\nHe is expected to make a full recovery before the 2024-25 season tips off.\n\nReach sports writer Jonah Dylan at jonah.dylan@commercialappeal.com or on Twitter @thejonahdylan."
