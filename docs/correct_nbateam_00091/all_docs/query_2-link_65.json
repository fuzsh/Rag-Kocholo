        "text": "The OGs Show will be a new podcast starring Udonis Haslem and Mike Miller, presented by Playmaker.\n\nThe former University of Florida and Miami Heat teammates will drop their unfiltered insights on what's happening around the NBA. You will get a first-hand look into their experiences on and off the court.\n\nHaslem and Miller have a long history, as they met on the AAU circuit and ended up being college roommates.\n\n\"Man, that white boy out there was so cold. I ain't seen nothing like this.\" Udonis Haslem on his first impression of Mike Miller via The Pivot Podcast.\n\nBy the looks of it, they already have a special guest for Heat fans with current star Bam Adebayo.\n\nFormer and current NBA players are taking over the podcast game lately, and these two are the perfect duo to step into the game.\n\nWith nearly 40 years in the NBA combined, Haslem and Miller will be able to bring you closer to the NBA and Heat than you've ever been.\n\nFrom the start of the Dwyane Wade era to Shaq to Lebron James, we get to hear it from the one person who was there through it all.\n\nEveryone knew Haslem wouldn't be able to stay away after finally calling it quits on a 20-year career with the Heat. Now, he is bringing the Heat fans worldwide even more memories to cherish.\n\nYou will be in for a treat if it's anything like the popular Club 520 Podcast starring former NBA All-Star Jeff Teague.\n\nBeing able to take fans behind the scenes of certain matchups and trash-talk that goes on during games will create plenty of viral moments.\n\nEveryone knows Haslem and Miller are as real as it gets and won't hold back on words regardless of topics. So, Heat fans get ready to take this new journey with the OGs.\n\nYou can find The OGs Show on YouTube and all podcast platforms: https://www.youtube.com/@TheOGsPodcast.\n\nDevin Brown is a contributing writer to Inside The Heat. He can be reached at dbrwnjr@gmail.com or Twitter @dbrwnjr."
