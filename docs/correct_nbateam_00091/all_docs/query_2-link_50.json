        "text": "With Jake LaRavia added to the injury report the Grizzlies began last night’s matchup with their league-leading 49th different starting lineup with Scotty Pippen Jr., Jordan Goodwin, GG Jackson, Maozinha Pereira, and Trey Jemison. Also, Brandon Clarke returned to the lineup off the bench, replacing Lamar Stevens who was ruled out after playing the night before.\n\nThe Grizzlies’ new starting lineup fell behind to an early 12-2 hole but a 10-2 response cut their deficit to 14-12 midway through the first. The rest of the first quarter was played tightly as the 76ers kept the lead throughout ending with a 28-23 advantage. The 76ers began the second quarter quickly extending their lead to double digits with a 6-0 run and continued extending it to a 20-point halftime advantage.\n\nAfter the 76ers began the third quarter leading by as many as 22 points, Scotty Pippen Jr. started cooking as he led the Grizzlies on a 14-4 run to cut their deficit to 12 points at 68-56. Scotty Pippen Jr. scored 14 points in the third quarter but the Grizzlies couldn’t close the gap no closer than 11 points as the 76ers pushed their lead out to 86-70 to end the third quarter.\n\nScotty Pippen Jr.’s hot streak continued as he scored the Grizzlies’ first four points to begin the fourth quarter but the 76ers countered every move to extend their lead back to 21 points. The 76ers then led by as many as 27 points on their way to a 116-96 victory over the Grizzlies.\n\nNow for the main entree:\n\nMarc Gasol Jersey Retirement Night\n\nLet’s Be Real, last night was all about Grit N’ Grind Grizzlies legend Marc Gasol getting his jersey retired next to fellow frontcourt mate Zach Randolph. Many former players from the Grit N’ Grind era were in attendance including fellow core 4 members Zach Randolph, Tony Allen, current Minnesota Timberwolves guard Mike Conley Jr., current Grizzlies Vice President of Basketball Affairs Tayshaun Prince, Rudy Gay, Quincy Pondexter, Darrell Arthur, Mike Miller, Beno Udrith, Jon Leuer, and coach Dave Joerger among others. The Memphis Grizzlies staple for the beginning of the Grizzlies era in Memphis and older brother Pau Gasol was also in attendance.\n\nAs the documentary that was posted last week titled “Marc Gasol: Memphis Made” entailed, Marc Gasol embodied the Grit N’ Grind era and is a native Memphian in everyone’s eyes stemming back to his teenage days playing at Lausanne Collegiate School when his brother Pau Gasol was the star for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nAfter being traded to the Grizzlies in a package for his brother Pau, Marc spent 11 seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies from 2008 until he was traded to the Toronto Raptors at the trade deadline in 2019. His time in Memphis included seven consecutive playoff appearances from 2011-2017, the franchise’s first playoff victory and series win in 2011, and a Western Conference Finals appearance in 2013.\n\nOn the personal accolades side in Memphis, Marc Gasol made three NBA All-Star game appearances (2012, 2015, 2017), two All-NBA teams (Second team-2013, First Team-2015), and won NBA Defensive Player of the Year (2013). He ranks first in team history in rebounds and blocks, second in team history in points, assists, triple-doubles, and games played, and third in team history in steals.\n\nWhat’s said doesn’t have to be explained about how much Marc Gasol and the Gasol family mean to the city of Memphis and the Memphis Grizzlies. The jersey retirement is just a token of appreciation for his time here.\n\nStart/Stop/Continue\n\nSTART thinking about potential dates to retire the “Grindfather” Tony Allen’s jersey number. His jersey retirement was originally scheduled during the 2022-2023 season but was postponed due to a legal issue. With that in the past, Tony Allen is the next man up followed by Mike Conley Jr. when he retires.\n\nComing Up\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies remain home for three of their final four games of the season as they will host the San Antonio Spurs for their fourth and final matchup on Tuesday at 7 PM CST. The Grizzlies own a 3-0 advantage on the season series against the Spurs.\n\nFinal Quote\n\n“We Don’t Bluff” – Marc Gasol & Zach Randolph"
