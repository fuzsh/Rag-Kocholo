        "text": "The 14-year veteran played in all 82 games last season. He shot 48 percent overall and 46 percent from 3-point range off the bench. Miller has expressed a desire to stay in Memphis and he wants a long-term deal. “The way I feel — and the way the NBA has changed a little bit — I can see myself playing three or four more years,” Miller said. “That’s my goal for sure.”\n\nFirst LeBron James admitted the Heat were lucky to win Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals. Now Mike Miller, who corralled the rebound of the first of LeBron James’ two missed 3-pointers in the final 28 seconds of the game that nearly produced a fifth Spurs championship, also has acknowledged the Heat’s good fortune. “It was back-and-forth and sometimes you need a little bit of luck to win championships,” Miller said after a morning shootaround ahead of Wednesday’s Spurs-Grizzlies season opener at AT&T Center. We got a little bit of luck that night. “It’s crazy. That’s the way the playoffs are; that’s the way series are.”"
