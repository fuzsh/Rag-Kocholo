        "text": "It has been a season to forget for Ja Morant, as his Memphis Grizzlies failed to make it to playoffs, and it didn’t help that he missed games due to suspension and his season-ending shoulder injury.\n\nSo, as he looks ahead to the 2024-25 season, Ja Morant plans to make changes, starting by moving on from his former NBA agent Jim Tanner to join Memphis Grizzlies icon Mike Miller in his new sports agency, Lift Sports.\n\nLift Sports was established by Mike Miller as a full-service sports management agency to help their athletes achieve their goals in sports and business, which represents the likes of fellow NBA players Paolo Banchero, Patrick Beverley, Wendell Carter Jr., and Tyus Jones, among others.\n\nMike Miller is well-known in Memphis, as he played for the Memphis Grizzlies in two stints during his 18-year NBA career. The two-time NBA champion and 2006 Sixth Man of the Year award-winner was also an assistant on Penny Hardaway’s Memphis coaching staff and is serving as head coach at Houston High School while pursuing a career path in sports management.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies need a healthy Ja Morant next season\n\nNow that he has switched representation, Ja Morant’s main focus is to be healthy for the 2024-25 season. He only played nine regular-season games in 2023-24, averaging 25.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 8.1 assists per game on 47.1 percent shooting from the field and was even named the Western Conference Player of the Week for Week 9.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies are a rising team in the Western Conference, but they’re not without their star point guard, as shown in their 27-55 record. Before missing this year’s playoffs, the Memphis Grizzlies made the postseason three consecutive times."
