For the most part, they're all the same plot recycled over and over, with the same caricatured characters. Sometimes there's even the same actor's portraying them.\n\nWhenever there's an Indian, it's always a white guy with facepaint, offensively spouting off bad accents and terrible acting. Which brings me to another thing, the acting. I'm a student of the art, and some of the acting in these flicks is just cringeworthy. Awful, just awful.\n\nIt's kind of funny though, only recently have these types of films really gained my ire, too. After seeing modern takes on Westerns and looking back to the original source material of some of these films, I can't understand why these movies are so revered by so many who study film or just watch movies. Sure, there's single movies here and there that stand out, but the genre as a whole just reeks of movie stench, imo.\n\nTL;DR - I really don't like Western movies.\n\n/rant\n\nPost by Big DSR Energy on\n\nI hated westerns as a kid. My dad watched them all the time, any old western. The plot was usually paint-by-numbers with all the other westerns he watched, and while nowadays I understand long, silent, panoramic shots of the desert are meant to give a feeling of isolation and loneliness, as a kid I just thought looking at the desert was so very boring.\n\nReally, though, I like westerns that are something else, too. Like JESSE JAMES MEETS FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER. TREMORS, if it counts, though really I just consider that a sci-fi flick in a desolate setting. But yeah, I like \"weird western\" type stories. *shrug*\n\nPost by Drillbit Taylor on\n\nWhat do you classify as a Western? I mean Westerns in and of themselves are vastly different. Do you clump all Westerns into the same category? Because to me, a fan of the genre, what you seem to be talking about is the Roy Rogers, pre 1960s Western as a whole. But the Genre changed into a complete different direction with the Itlian Westerns, and their spinoffs. Which in turn transitioned into comedy, faded, then replaced with the modern ones we have now.\n\nI like the genre as a whole, but I can see how some aspects can be disliked. Hell, I can not stand the singing cowboy style 1950s stuff either, because its so historically incorrect. You show me one guy in 1879 who was out on the range wearing white, and perfectly clean shaven, and I will show you an imposter or some dandy that fell off his wagon is about to die.\n\nWhat I am kinda saying is that there is a Genre of Western for everyone. It is encomassing, and there are so many differnet sub genres that will cover all gambits. Be it Horror with directors like Lucio Fulci, Julio Buchs's Bullet for Sandoval or the aforementioned Jessie James meets Frankenstines Daughter; Comedy, The Trinity Series; Epics like The Dollar's trilogy or Once upon a time in the west; Grit and violence like Keoma or Django; Political Satire like Django Kill, if You Live, Shoot!.\n\nI will agree there is a lot of crap, but there are a lot of gems that are hidden that will fit just about any pallet. Yes the genre as a whole might not be your cup of tea, but there most likly is a sub genre that will fit your tastes, it just might be some obscure corner that you might not know is there\n\nPost by Koda, Master Crunchyroller on\n\nWhat do you classify as a Western?

I hate the real old ones, basically pre-John Wayne.\n\nAnd even after John Wayne came onto the scene there were still some crap films, sure, but the good ones? The good ones are f***ing amazing films.\n\nBut then again, considering the states the two of us come from, we might be a little bit biased towards a good old Western yarn."
