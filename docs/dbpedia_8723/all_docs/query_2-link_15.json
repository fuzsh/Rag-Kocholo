While those first two elements likely led to the third, it only reminds us that some pictures look better in hindsight and often earn a second life years or even decades after their theatrical release. Case in point: Wagon Master is now regularly claimed as one of the director's greatest works, a masterpiece aside well-known classics like The Searchers or How Green Was My Valley ...and it that weren't enough, it was even named by Ford himself as a personal favorite. Small in scope but extremely solid in construction, the almost 70 year-old Wagon Master remains a striking example of proficient visual storytelling.\n\nAnd why shouldn't it? The late, great director shot more than 60 silent films during the first decade of his prolific career, which likely cemented his ability to tell accessible stories without the benefit of sound recording. (It's also the reason many of his later films, Wagon Master included, are largely understandable with the volume off.) Expertly lensed by cinematographer Bert Glennon, this slow and steady Western serves up one beautiful frame after another. As horse traders Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and Sandy Owens (Harry Carey, Jr.) usher a Mormon wagon train led by gruff Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond, who starred in the spiritual TV spin-off, Wagon Train) to its destination near the San Juan River, we're treated to no shortage of wide-open landscapes -- or at least as wide as its 1.37:1 aspect ratio allows -- and accessible, beautifully-framed compositions that lead us perfectly through almost every scene. Like good editing (which Wagon Train also has, incidentally), it does its job without always being noticed.\n\nThe group faces a long haul through dangerous territory, made even more unstable by the murderous Clegg family: Uncle Shiloh (Charles Kemper) and his four boys, who seem more of an immediate threat than the rugged landscape or occasional Native American attack. But while the insulated group drama and outside forces warrant enough drama to build an 86-minute film around, I'll be damned if Wagon Master's supporting characters don't regularly outshine its two leaders...especially Ben Johnson, who portrays the titular man himself. This stuntman-turned-actor sure can ride a horse, and he acquits himself well enough considering this is only his third acting gig...but Johnson's overall presence and line delivery pale in comparison to almost everyone around him. That might just say more about Wagon Master's excellent supporting cast than anything else, but he still feels like one of the weakest links in the chain.\n\nNonetheless, Wagon Master's powerhouse visuals and deliberate pace still make it a joy to watch (and listen to, aside from the damned horn that keeps getting blown). Luckily, Warner Archive Collection's new Blu-ray offers their usually strong amount of support, including a gorgeous A/V presentation and an extremely valuable supplement.\n\nWagon Master Blu-ray, Video Quality\n\nWarner Archive's beautiful 1080p transfer adds a lot of support for Wagon Master, showcasing its sun-baked visuals with energy to spare. As with most WAC releases, Wagon Master is sourced from a recent 2K scan of the master positive with extensive digital cleanup, revealing a high level of fine detail and plenty of natural grain.\n\nThe film was shot by cinematographer Bert Glennon, who worked with Ford on several earlier productions including Stagecoach, Young Mr. Lincoln, and Drums Along the Mohawk; they would later reunite for one of Glennon's final films, Sergeant Rutledge. His work here is stunning, enough so that I often forgot about the film's native 1.37:1 aspect ratio and black-and-white film stock. Textures look excellent with strong shadow detail and precise contrast, while the dual-layered Blu-ray maintains an extremely high bit rate and displays absolutely no flagrant compression artifacts, noise reduction, or other signs of digital tinkering. A flat-out wonderful transfer, as usual.\n\nWagon Master Blu-ray, Audio Quality\n\nThe DTS-HD 2.0 Master Audio mix does a great job replicating Wagon Master's one-channel roots. Fidelity and dynamic range are surprisingly excellent from start to finish, with very little clipping at the high end and a good balance between dialogue, background effects, and the fully-loaded score by Richard Hageman (another frequent Ford collaborator). Likewise, another very solid effort -- there's basically no room for improvement. Optional English (SDH) subtitles are included during the film; unfortunately, they're formatted in ALL CAPS and ugly yellow to boot.\n\nNOTE: An optional Spanish dub (with matching subtitles) was also included on Warner Bros.' 2009 DVD edition of Wagon Master, but it has not been ported over for this release. A missed opportunity!\n\nWagon Master Blu-ray, Special Features and Extras\n\nWarner Archive Collection's Blu-ray is packaged in a standard keepcase with attractive poster-themed artwork and no inserts. The extras unfortunately do not include Wagon Master's theatrical trailer (usually a WAC staple); I couldn't find one online, and it wasn't included on Warner Bros.' DVD either. Perhaps it no longer exists?\n\nFortunately, we get one DVD-era supplement and it's outstanding.\n\nAudio Commentary - This feature-length track is hosted by filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich and also includes late actor Harry Carey Jr., which creates a good balance that leads to many interesting stories, trivial tidbits, and heaps of well-deserved praise for the film. (I am sometimes tempted to \"sample\" commentaries but had no trouble listening to this one the entire way through.) Interestingly enough, John Ford is here as well -- courtesy of a 1966 audio interview played by Bogdanovich, at least -- during which the late director answers a number of questions about his life and career. Overall, it's a very illuminating commentary track and, though not without a few extended lapses into silence, is essential listening for die-hard and casual Ford fans alike.\n\nWagon Master Blu-ray, Overall Score and Recommendation\n\nWagon Master is a lesser-seen gem from late, great director John Ford; though slight on the surface and without a lot of A-list actors, the film's visual compositions are excellent and its supporting characters are extremely memorable. Warner Archive Collection's Blu-ray does the film justice with a great A/V presentation and a strong audio commentary carried over from the film's 2009 DVD. It's highly recommend to die-hard fans and curious newcomers alike.\n\nWagon Master Blu-ray Screenshots\n\nBack to Wagon Master Blu-ray »\n\nWagon Master Blu-ray\n\n$21.99 $17.99"
