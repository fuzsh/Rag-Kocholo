(Buffalo Bill) Cody is describing the finale of his great Wild West Show: Cody I see General George Armstrong Custer leading the courageous men of the Seventh Cavalry deep deep deeper into the Injun territory known as Little Big Horn on a Mission of Peace. Prentiss Excuse me. Bill. You know it wasn't really Little Big Horn. It was the Greasy Grass River. Cody Prentiss, I already got the programs printed. . . . The general halts his troops and they set up camp, exhausted from their historic and humane journey carrying the wounds of a cowardly Sioux ambush from the day before. Prentiss Bill, it was a Sioux defense against a cavalry ambush. Cody As the day ends, the valley is quiet as a tomb. Then, suddenly, Injuns appear. More Injuns than anybody's ever seen. Publicist Mate Salsbury begins shouting through his megaphone, cueing the action, prompting the actors. . . . The Indians enter, led by Chief Sitting Bull in full Sioux warbonnet and buckskins. Cody Custer knows it’s gonna be a fight for his life, so he writes a quick farewell note to his beautiful wife while the cannon's being loaded. 1 Prentiss Bill, Custer didn’t have a cannon at Greasy Grass River. Cody Prentiss, there's reason to believe he had one on order. So we've just delivered it early. Prentiss I'm just pointin' out the truth of history lessons. Bill. Cody It's about time history took a lesson from us'. — Scene from \"Buffalo Bill and the Indians: or Sitting Bull's History Lesson.\"^ Introduction: The \"Unwritten History\" In 1913, the real Buffalo Bill Cody was aging and in 'debt. The once great Wild West and Indian Show was near bankruptcy--the days of national tours, presidential perform ances, and appearances before the crowned heads of Europe long completed. Cody was desperate to resurrect past glories and to renew personal fortunes. He approached his debtors with an ambitious plan : If live pageantry, western melodrama, and rodeo shows were too expensive and too sim­ plistic for twentieth-century tastes, then why not resort to the most modern of divertissements— moving pictures? Cody would recreate for film the greatest battles in western history. No expense would be spared, no stone unturned in searching for authenticity and reality. Essenay Studios agreed to handle the films, the United States Secretary of War assigned an entire regiment of soldiers in authentic uniforms, the Secretary of the Interior granted permission for filming on the actual sites at which the battles took place, and the Sioux tribe agreed to reenact its own defeats* William F* Cody Historical Pictures was on its way. Cody decided to begin with the Battle at Wounded Knee, the last major confrontation of the Indian campaigns. Less than twenty-three years had passed since that 1890 battle. Many participants, victors and vanquished alike, still jlived, including the Commander-in-Charge, General Nelson W. Miles. Trying to please the War Department, and hoping to live up to the title of his company, Cody invited Miles to participate in the first film as historical and technical 'advisor. Therein lay the ruin of Buffalo Bill. General Miles turned out to be an exacting and particu­ lar historical advisor. Telegrams and correspondence found among the papers of General Frank D. Baldwin^ indicate that Miles was not pleased with Cody's sense of history. As shooting began. Miles demanded that the photography be taken on the \"Kinemacolor principle\" as was being used all over the world, and was \"a great improvement on the simple colors of black and white. In fact, it is absolutely essential that that system should be used in order to make it historically correct; the Indians are neither white nor black, but are the so noted copper-colored race that is disappearing forever.\"^ Miles also noted that the War and Interior Departments had 'authorized assistance \"provided that it is strictly histor­ ically correct\"^ and suggested a series of twelve scenes or tableaus which would accomplish that purpose. Neither Kine­ macolor nor the proposed tableaus were used in the film. Filming began in October, but Miles continued to be displeased. When he saw the completed film in January, 1914, he complained by letter to George E. Spoor, President of the Film Manufacturing Co. of Chicago: We were asked to hurry out to the Plains to assist in reproduc­ tion of the closing scenes of the Indian War. Notwithstanding the fact that the campaign occurred in mid-Winter, we were asked to go out early in October. Arriving at Pine Ridge we were obliged to wait nearly a week while the troops and Indians were engaged in what is officially and publically known as a massacre or the representation of the same . . . Now in behalf of the gallant officers and soldiers who had borne the brunt of the Indian campaigns on our frontier and many of those whose lives have been sacrificed, I am obliged to enter a solemn protest against the misrepresentation and misleading statements made in regard to those pictures.^ Miles' complaints included the fact that a peace conference which was shown as occurring before the final battle, did not occur until afterwards. He complained that the title cards were misleading, because they referred to a \"War of the Messiah,\" which never occurred. A peace council promise that Indians would not be punished if they surren­ dered was never made. Last, Miles complained about the pnusually heroic presence of Buffalo Bill in the film: [T]he announcement is made in bold letters, \"The Close of the Indian Wars in America\" and the name of Buffalo Bill appears above and below the picture. Under this fraudulent title a march of General Merritt in 1876 and a campaign of General Carr in 1869 is presented, and in those scenes the commands are marched, halted, and manouevered at the dictation of Colonel Cody. Those generals are both dead. They cannot protest against this presentation, but their distinguished record is well-known and it is only necessary to state to any military man the fact they were officers on the frontier when William Cody was a child. Titles were shuffled and some shots were restaged. But the battle was met. Miles wanted autheticity. Cody wanted pizzazz. No one was happy with the result. The finished product reflected Miles' heavy-handed touch. It was relatively authentic— and quite dull. Lacking a focal point, dramatic pace, and human interest, it seemed as aimed at the National Archives, not at an audience.^ Attacked by Nelson Miles and the War Department on one side, and facing poor reviews and poor returns on the other, Buffalo Bill was defeated. The William F. Cody Historical Pictures Co. disappeared before producing another epic. Whether in fictional film or in historical accounts, the interaction between reality and fantasy is complex and continuous. Just as the fictional Buffalo Bill attempted to manipulate reality to fit the shape of his extravagant entertainments, so was the real Buffalo Bill, himself the creator and the product of show business enterprises. In terms of commercial appeal, moving pictures supplanted wild west shows, dime novels, and western pulps as the predomi­ nant form of popular entertainment. Yet, the story of William Cody's Historical Pictures Company illustrates that the twentieth-century's newest gadget was no more prone toward authenticity than other forms of entertainment. In fact, the first few years of film history indicate a contin­ uing struggle over historic and ethnic images in American films. As early as 1911, for example, outraged Indian delega­ tions were arriving in Washington, D.C., to protest the film treatment of Native Americans. On March 18, 1911, Moving Picture World headlined a story, \"Indians War on Films,\" and noted that In order to get thrilling pictures of wild western life, [moving pictures promoters] have used white men costumed as Indians, in depicting scenes that are not true pictures of the Indians, and are in fact, grossly libelous. The Indians are contemplating a call at the White House tomorrow to lay the case before President Taft, and may ask for Congressional action looking to the regulation of moving pictures in which Indians are shown.® There is no indication that President Taft ever received the Indians' case. Nor does history indicate Congressional regulation of the movies in behalf of the Indians. Still, the struggle for accuracy continued. While one contemporary critic bemoaned the existence of \"The Make-Believe Indian\"® and wondered why thoroughly representative films couldn't be produced while real Indians still existed, W. Stephen Bush wondered why by 1911 filmmak­ ers continued to use the same tired-out ‘ western stereotypes. He attacked what he called \"Moving Picture Absurdities\": The greatest of them all is the Indian. We have him in every variety but one. We have Indians a la Français, \"red\" men recruited from the Bowery and upper West End Avenue. We have Licensed Indians and Independent Indians— the only kind we lack are the real Indians. . . . General Sherman said that there were no good Indians except the dead ones. He had never seen the mov­ ing picture Indian. There is no medium of morality about him. He is either wholly good, seemingly transplated from the skies, or else a fiend and an expert scalper in common practice . . . These and similar moulds are worn and cracked and should be thrown away. The surest path to success is the one where \"no track of steps has worn a way.\" Originality is the life of the moving pictures.^ ® Almost from the instant that film was introduced as a popu­ lar entertainment, people were thinking about the impact of film as a purveyor of images and as an unusually persuasive medium of mass communications. One critic talked about film as \"the living picture,\" and predicted that \"unwritten 'history\" would be the greatest marvel of the future. Sublime, indeed, is the contemplation of the history to be recorded without words, and yet, in a language that speaks to eyes, ears, head, and heart; the living picture is the crown of the ages, the greatest recorder of the past, and the greatest teacher of the future. It is said that in degradation there is a bottomless pit. Surely, then, in culture, there are topless heights, in the climbing of which the picture is of invaluable aid. If it is possible that the future holds a period in which the usefulness of tha.t:picture will be transcended, it would seem that such a state is beyond present comprehension. But even then, in that marvelous age, they will still be reading, like ourselves, that which has never been written, the cinematograph having been the medium of their education.^ ^ 'Fictional filmmaking, at least, has rarely lived up to this glorious prediction. Being a joint venture of expediency and entertainment, movies change personalities, rewrite history, and uproot geography. In Hollywood, budgets are {based upon prospective returns rather than the cost of film accuracy, and casting is done with an eye toward audience appeal rather than authenticity. To that optimistic 1911 writer, today's \"living picture\" would probably be a crush­ ing disappointment. One argument motivating this study, however, is that film has in fact served effectively as an instrument of \"unwritten history.\" While the validity of specific histor­ ical images will be questioned, it is believed that film does in fact record the past and teach audiences about a vast and complex arrangement of past and present worlds. Anyone who was a boy in the early fifties will remember that when it came time to separate the cowboys from the Indians for after-school play, a small lump of defeat lodged in the throats of the unfortunate child-Indians. Before we could even besiege the settler's fort, we knew that the attack must fail. Indians, of course, never won. And fair-haired heroes never lost. The lesson may not have been accurate, but it was larger than life and more vivid than a book. Our movie textbooks were realer than real. Film Image or Content Studies In recent years students of the film have begun to examine the ways in which movies promote social conceptions, character-typing, and societal values. Two of the earliest examinations into the influences of movies on attitudes and behavior were written by an anthropologist and a political scientist. Hortense Powdermaker wondered what an anthropologist would find when he turned his lens on the movies. She sug­ gested that the researcher could Use the same general premises and point of view in the study of motion pictures as an institution of contemporary society. We define an institution as an organized system of human activities which meet a basic human need. Our frame of refer­ ence is both functional and historical. . . . In other words, we arrive at an understanding.of an institution not by studying it as if it were a separate phenomenon, but in terms of its interrelationships with society as a whole.^ ^ Ms. Powdermaker suggested that a very detailed evaluation of film should reflect social values and goals and should provide valuable information about the society in which the films are produced. Therefore, an analysis of the specific content of American movies should contribute to a deeper understanding of American society. Franklin Fearing, writing in a 1947 issue of the Annals pf the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences, also identified the influence of movies on values and ideas. \"With a few special exceptions,\" he wrote, \"everybody— social scientist, movie makers, and laymen--seems to agree that there are profoundly important relationships between motion pictures and human behavior.\"^ ® Fearing also argued jfor a precise and detailed investigation into the content of motion pictures as one way in which questions about human behavior, communication, and role-identification might be ^studied. According to Fearing, Like the folk tale, classic drama, primitive storytelling, or the medieval morality play, the film may be regarded as a means through which the individual understands himself, his social role, and the values of his group. It is also a means by which the individual orients himself in a universe of events which appear to occur haphazardly and chaotically. . . . The motion picture is not a fixed pattern of meanings or ideas which are received by a passive mind. Rather, what the individual \"gets\" is determined by his background and his needs. He takes from the picture what is usable for him or what will function in his life.^** >In order to further understand the ways in which motion pic­ tures express and communicate cultural values, social concepts, and desired images, we must examine film in new ways. Fearing says 9 it is necessary to know something about the content of the film, the psychological needs of the persons who are exposed to it, the immediate setting, and the social and cultural forces operating on the persons who make films and the audiences for whom they are intended.^ ® According to Powdermaker, the anthropologist \"looks at his movies both functionally and historically. He must analyze the movies themselves, study the audience, and learn about the conditions under which the pictures are made.\"^ ^ Fearing and Powdermaker both suggest that the first step toward a clear understanding of the interrelationships Detween film and society would be a particularly careful analysis of film images. By looking at film in terms of plot, character, setting, physical appearance, costume, and sets, it would be possible to identify key images and sig­ nificant sequences. By comparing those sequences with corresponding sequences from authentic sources, it would be possible to isolate differences, to notice changes over time, and to understand the ways in which film images are selected and ordered. Having carefully isolated and deline­ ated the most significant images, it would then be possible to analyse the differences and to propose reasons for the changes. It is the general argument of this study that film and society interact in a dynamic way. Film styles and images adapt and alter over time because of social and political [changes in the external world. But images also bring about changes in that outer world, because values, attitudes, and 10 beliefs can be affected when audiences can be analysed. The Lpecific task of this study, therefore, is the careful, jcomparative delineation of film and historical images of the Sioux. Extensive content analysis and detailed film image studies have only recently been appearing. One of the most Lmpressive studies of this type is Siegfried Kracauer's psy­ chological history of the German film. From Caligari to Hitler.In this work, Kracauer charted the relationship I between political and social forces in pre-Hitler Germany to the content and style of German films. He contended that through an analysis of the German films deep psychological dispo­ sitions predominant in Germany from 1918 to 1933 can be exposed [and that] the use made here of films as a medium of research can profitably be extended to studies of current mass behavior in the United States and elsewhere. The analysis of film with specific reference to the political, social, racial, or psychological source and accuracy of given images is an important development, one that merits extension into the areas of American racial stereotyping and historical image development. Marjorie Rosen has attempted to explore the film images of women in her study. Popcorn Venus: Women, Movies, and the American Dream. In her prefatory comments, she makes a clear case |for the values of film image studies : Does art reflect life? In movies, yes. Because more than any other art form, films have been a mirror held up to society's porous face. They therefore reflect the changing societal image of women— which, until recently, has not been taken seriously enough. 11 Does life reflect art? Again, yes. Because of the magnetism of movies— because their glamor and intensity and \"entertainment\" are so distracting and seemingly innocuous— [audiences] accept their morality or values. Sometimes too often. Too blindly. And tragically.^ ® The purposes of film image studies are to isolate, analyse, and identify the origins of events, personalities, Lnd images which appear on film screens. As a discipline in Æilm history and criticism, image studies are relatively new. Though the Kracauer book first appeared in 194 7, most jof the film image studies which have been published since then, have appeared in the last decade. Image studies about Blacks, Women, Homosexuals, Asians, Indians, and Jews repre­ sent part of the contemporary movement in this direction.^ ° Image studies can serve several valuable functions. In the first place, a comparison of the filmed event with listorical and anthropological sources will help the film ^scholar to understand more clearly the processes of inter­ pretation, distortion, and mythification as they relate to film. In the second place, a comparison of the fictional •film image with the actual historical image will help the social historian to understand the role of film as an agency in image creation and the generation of popular beliefs. In bhe third place, an understanding of the specific forces Dringing about and subsequently changing particular film images will help the film scholar to understand the interre­ lations between film and society. In particular, such an understanding will provide insights' into the societal aspects of genre-based film studies. 12 Image studies, then, relate strongly to the question of film as social history. In his essay, \"Ceremonies of Inno­ cence,\" Michael Wood wrote Throughout this book I have argued and assumed that virtually any Hollywood movie, however trivial, and whatever its intentions, can be seen as a text for a rather special kind of social history: the study of what might be called the back of the American mind, or perhaps the back of certain states of that mind . . . Hollywood sets out full of unmistakable good will and good faith, to provide a text in social history, and comes up with snappy entertainment at best, and at worst, an insult to the victims of whatever plight it undertook to inspect.^ ^ In another place. Wood suggests that \"movies offer structures of thought and feeling to an almost inconceivable quantity of people, and we live on their legacy in ways we lave hardly begun to realize.Finally, Wood considers the impact of American films : The sociology of American movies thus becomes a question of the contribution of American movies to ideology; . . . of the extent to which the structures of moral and mental life in America and elsewhere correspond to structures to be found in films.^ ® The rise of image studies as a technique of film criti- bism seems to be closely aligned to questions of film genre studies. Film genres provide bodies of films which can be 'linked by common traditions and conventions, or by similar themes, characterizations, visual icons and symbols, and typical narrative structures. Marjorie Rosen's image study on film women can also be read as a study of the women's jfilm genre. Genre studies has a long history as a source of •literary classifications. Beginning with the Logic of Cate­ gories during the Enlightenment, the concept of grouping and categorization has been a valid tool in literary criticism. 13 In the field of film analysis, the application of image studies to the field of genre criticism will expand that field. In his useful volume. Theories of Film, Andrew Tudor discusses the difficulties involved in applying literary genre study devices to film criticism. He writes. This is not to suggest that genre terms are totally useless. It is merely that to employ them requires a much more methodical understanding of the workings of film. And this in turn requires that we specify a set of sociological and psychological context assumptions and construct explicit genre models within them. . . . [T]he genre concept is indispensable in more strictly social and psychological terms as a way of formulating the interplay between culture, audience, films, and film-makers. . . . In sum, then, genre terms seem best immediately employed in the analysis of the relation between groups of films, the cultures in which they are made and the cultures in which they are exhibited.^ ^ The current decade has seen a growing interest in spe­ cific film images and the development of those images during the course of film history. The values of these studies support further inquiry and investigation of other signifi­ cant filmic representations of individuals or groups. It is the argument of this study that one filmic group needs to be studied in particular: the Sioux Indians. Statement of the Problem The general problem to be studied is \"What are the images presented in American films dealing with the Sioux 'Indians and how do those images compare to images of that same tribe as presented in historical, ethnographic, and autobiographical accounts?\" The cinematic and historical Lmages will be compared in an attempt to demonstrate the yays in which film images are constructed, how and under 14 what circumstances they change, and how the presence or absence of a particular image affects the impact of the total film. The study will be carried out with respect to several distinct \"images\" which reoccur visually within a fairly large and representative group of films. The term \"image\" will refer to the visual appearance of costumes, lodging, locale, or life styles. It will also refer to the depiction of typically recurring events, such as conferences, battles, or hunting raids. The term \"image\" will also refer to recur­ ring aspects of character development, plot motivation, or narrative structure which reappear frequently in films. Specifically, this study will look at historical events or processes: Sioux Material Culture (such as housing, village jlife, dress, and body decoration); Sioux Social Organization (such as tribal councils, courting, and social roles); and images of Sioux religion and ceremonies (such as visions and the Sun Dance ceremony). Significance of the Problem The Sioux Indians deserve study as a film image group for a variety of reasons. In the first place. Plains Indi­ ans and the Sioux tribe in particular, represent an import­ ant part of film history. At least as early as 1894, when jthe silent film \"Sioux Ghost Dance\"^ ^ was made, American cowboys have been beating American Indians, all to the thrill and excitement of American audiences. The western _______________________________ : _1.5J ihas~hâd as lon<^ând as contirTuous a \"r^igrT'of popularity as any film genre. The Sioux Indians were particularly impor­ tant because of their appearance, techniques of war, and their historic interactions with westward-bound Americans after the Civil War. It was the various tribes of the Plains who were characterized by war ponies, buffalo hunts, [bows-and-arrows, feathered war bonnets, secret bird calls, tent-like \"Teepees,\" and lives of migration following the herds. Though there may have been close to a hundred dis­ tinct Native American tribes in the early nineteenth century, the twenty or so tribes which comprised the Plains Indians have retained the most stereotyped of images. The Sioux deserve individual study for an additional reason. Ralph and Natasha Friar have written one of the few volumes on the history of Indians as film images. Their book, The Only Good Indian: The Hollywood Gospel,-^® includes detailed indices to images of Indians in American films. According to the statistics, Sioux Indians have appeared in over eighty silent and sound films between the years 18 94 and 1971.^ ^ The Sioux have been represented, have been portrayed consistently during the long history of the west­ ern film genre, and have been filmed by almost every major motion picture production company. Listing sound-period films only, Sioux Indians have appeared in films produced by Universal, Fox, Buena-Vista, Warner Brothers, RKO, Columbia, Allied Artists, United Artists, Republic, and Paramount.^ ® The Sioux also merit analysis because of the political 16 and military confrontations which gave rise to such heroic figures as Chief Sitting Bull, General Benjamin Miles, Chief Crazy Horse, William F. Cody, General George Armstrong Custer, Chief Red Cloud, and others. The Sioux Massacre at the Battle of the Little Dig Horn has been filmed at least twenty-two times^® and represents one of the most important western film sub-genres. Specific analysis of the Sioux Indian image is impor­ tant for yet another reason. Ralph and Natasha Friar begin their book with a derisive discussion of the \"melting pot theory\" as it has related to Indians: Thanks to.the moving pictures, we can, let us say, lump the Apache tribes with the Mohawk Nation, call them \"Indians\" and assume not only a racial but an ethnic relationship as well. We do not, however, arbitrarily lump the people from Hungary with the people from the British Isles to define Caucasians, nor do we assume that the two peoples have any ethnic relationship.® ® The Friar's continue with a brief history of American coloni­ zation: Spanish, French, English, Dutch,Portuguese, Swedish, and Russian voyagers comprised the invading European minority. . . . To insure that we may gullibly accept the historic fallacy that our predeces­ sors came here to create a \"free\" nation, history books, in conjunction with the makers of filmic history, have conveniently omitted telling us about the many indigenous tribes or nations exterminated on behalf of freedom. Hollywood has continued to perpetuate the myth by creating either (1) a noble red man, or (2) a vicious savage, both of whom deny the white man his proper Christian right to this continent. No other race or culture depicted on film has been made to assume such a permanent fictional identity. . . . The fact is that the \"American Indian\" is the only legitimate native of this land. Yet he is racially, not ethnically, isolated in our minds as one minority. . . . Hollywood has continued to be a co-conspirator in committing cultural genocide by subverting the Native American's various ethnic identities and retaining him as a racial scape­ goat. ® ^ 17 Because the Sioux have cultural significance, because they were historically important in the westward expansion of European culture, because they are represented both historically and by studio within film history, and because they have not yet been studied in any significant way, the Sioux are worthy of filmic image analysis. The availability of contemporary historical and ethnographic documents per­ taining to the Sioux within Southern California archives provides feasibility to this proposed study. Most impor­ tantly, the concentrated emphasis on images pertaining to the Sioux people alone might help point out the multiplicity of ethnic images to which the Friars referred. In addition to elucidating the specific images of Sioux Indians in Ameri­ can films, the study will also help broaden and expand the significance and validity of image studies and content analyses in American film scholarship. References have been made to studies concerning the images of women. Blacks, homosexuals, and other groups. It is important to note that none of the identified studies other than these have attempted to compare film images in a historical or anthro­ pological way. Though the typical study certainly includes L historical point of view, that view usually refers to the years in which films were made, rather than to original [events themselves. By focusing film scholarship on a way of life which is limited by time and terrain, and by comparing a specific life style to the available filmed versions, we _______________________________________________________l-8j |carT begin” tb~~document the specific ways”~ih~which' ihbvi jreflect social history. The important question will not be whether or not the film images of Sioux Indians are accurate Rather, the concern will be to look at the ways in which film and history interact, the ways in which images change jover time, and the effects, if any, that \"correct\" images have on the impact of a film. Therefore, this study will add to present knowledge of films and to the scope of film image studies in the follow­ ing ways: 1. This study will apply image study techniques to a largely ignored populace : the component families of the Sioux Nation. 2. This study will apply the techniques of historical and anthropological research to the field of image study, which has generally focused on contemporary images and contemporary times. 3. This study will raise the issues of the interaction of historical, sociological, and cultural forces in the creation of public attitudes and values through film. Method of the Study The nature of the Problem calls for combining the techniques of historical research and film criticism. The •historical procedures of archival work will help to locate primary references on relevant topics, to internally and 19 [externally validate that historical material, and to estab­ lish a precise and documented portrait of Sioux Indian life, primarily of the last half of the nineteenth century. The I ■result of historical research will include the discovery of photographic, etched, and drawn pictures of Indian life and je vents. Autobiographical data will include diaries, cor­ respondence, and journals, and reference will also be made to government reports and military memorabilia. It is important to note, of course, that the age of a document is not also proof of its veracity. The victor of a battle may ■remember the events differently from a witness on the other side. A Quaker missionary may know more about the Sioux •language than about Sioux battle tactics. The potential Diases of all historical sources must be carefully consid- jsred. The historical research is not necessarily limited to primary sources. Used with care, contemporary newspaper, magazine, and broadside accounts can be of great value, as jean published biographies, autobiographies, anthropologists' reports, and published trial or government transcripts. The nature of the problem also calls for the techniques bf critical film analysis. This tool of film research includes detailed content analysis of selected films and jutilizes screenplays, film stills, viewed films, and both jDral (taped) and written descriptions of those films. Critical research also includes recourse to film reviews and publications, to appropriate genre studies, and to other 20 relevant'materials\"^ Content analysis depends upon repeated viewings of significant films— usually in sixteen millimeter format— and very close analysis of particular sequences. A film viewer or projector with \"freeze-frame\" capability was used in most cases. The historical and critical phases of research included primary and secondary sources. The first phase of research involved the identification and review of materials dealing with the Sioux. The second phase of research involved the 'identification and location of films dealing with the Sioux in important ways. The final phase of research involved the Letailed analysis of the identified films and the appropri­ ate comparisons to the other materials. Among the most useful primary materials were the fol­ lowing : 1. U. S. Bureau of Indian Affairs correspondence between Indian Agents on reservations and Washing- ' ton, D.C. Headquarters (Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History). 2. Documents of Indian Captivity (Published Journals, diaries, and manuscript collections, Huntington Memorial Library, San Marino, California). 3. American Indian photographs, portraits, and Luther Burbank Drawing Collection (Huntington Memorial Library, San Marino, California). 4. Frank D. Baldwin Collection (Correspondence and 21 \" “ \"^diaries dealing with the 1876 Montana Sioux campaigns, Huntington Memorial Library, San Marino, California.) The major secondary resource for this project were the films themselves. The Friar book is a basic reference to films on Sioux or any other Indian topic. However, those authors admit that their list is selective, so it was not taken as final. The list of potential films for study was expanded to include films produced since that book was published as well as to include additional films which were identified through the process of research. The major ^considerations leading to the final selections of films will be discussed below. Limitations of the Study The study has been limited in the following ways : 1. Though the Sioux nation consisted of seven semi- autonomous families (Santee, Teton, Brule, Hunk- papa. Kettle, Pawnee, and Yankton), I will treat them, in general, as a single group. The available Sioux films can only occasionally be identified with a specific sub-group. Particularly famous figures like Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull can be identified with their appropriate families, and certain historical events are known to have involved particular groups. Unfortunately, that information is external'to the films themselves and 22 is \"available in only a few cases. In addition, available historical and anthropological materials were not sufficient to permit detailed discussions of each family. Whenever significant lifestyle differences occur between families, they will be discussed. Film analysis was limited to sound era films only. This limitation was imposed for two reasons : First, the availability of rare and flammable nitrate prints made it too difficult to obtain a large enough sample of the silent films. Second, the sound films have been more influential in the creation of images and in perpetuating the western genre as we know it today. Secondary sources pro­ vide adequate data concerning some of the silent film images. A total of forty-four sound era films were found which related to the Sioux. The selection of films was based upon reviews in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Library. Choices were made which would include a wide historical repre­ sentation of titles during the sound decades, which would include influential films, and which would include those titles most likely to contain a broad range of Sioux images for analysis. Film selec­ tions were also affected by availability in 16- millimeter format and price.. Eventually, twenty 2.3J films were selected and screened, ranging in age from \"Custer's Last Stand\" (1936) to \"White Buffalo' (1977). The complete list of films, including title, production date, and approximate story date is as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20.

This chapter will look at the material from a broad historical point of view, providing an opportunity to sum­ marize essential points of Sioux history and to compare those points with their 24 dêpTctT6ns~ih^ f ilms. Chapters III, IV, and V: These three chapters represent comparative examinations of major aspects of Sioux culture and life. They are reflective of categorical breakdowns in two major refer­ ences on the Sioux, Robert H. Lowie's, Indians of the Plains,^ ^ and Harold E. Driver and William C. Massey's, \"Compara­ tive Studies of North American Indians.\"^ ^ Attempts will be made to make detailed comparisons of film images and historical- anthropological images in three areas : material culture (or housing, clothing, decorations, and village life); social organization (or tribal organization, courting, and social roles); and religion (or visions and the Sun Dance ceremony). These topics were chosen to correspond to major areas of film interest. Chapter VI: The final chapter will draw conclusions about the values of image studies, and about the interactions between societal pressures, popular culture, and the devel­ opment of racial or ethnic images and stereotypes. The final chapter will sum- 25 marizé the study, and will consider the ways in which film and society affect each other. Recommendations for further research will also be made. 26 FOOTNOTES ^Alan Rudolph and Robert Altman, Buffalo Bill and the Indians; or Sitting Bull's History Lesson (New York: Ban­ tam Books, 1976), pp. 79-81. ^General Frank D.

The white patrons stare at him hatefully as he moves toward the rear of the room. First Man They don't sell liquor to Injuns in this place. Second Man Anyway, not through the front door'. Young Wolf Not want fire water, want Shot Tongue. Him Injun's friend. Shot Tongue turns out to be Slade, the corrupt Indian Agent. He offers Young Wolf a drink. Young Wolf No want fife water. Heart is sad. Two Eagles, Him dead. Slade Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. That gives you the medicine arrow. Makes you heap big medicine man. Young Wolf Young Wolf only Indian now. Your White brothers stole magic arrow. . . . Me afraid to go to medicine cave without arrow. jYoung Wolf produces a necklace of solid gold nuggets to prove the existence of the secret cave. Slade and his friends are all ears now. 30 Young Wolf You will help gettum arrow? Slade Sure, you know me. I'm your friend. — Snene from \"Custer's Last Stand,\" 1936.^ A white trapper, O'Rourke and his faithful Cree companion, Cajou, are completing a successful trapping expedition in Western Canada. On their return towards the fort, they encounter a smouldering wagon train. They move forward and O'Rourke misses being shot by the sole survivor of the Indian raid, a woman named Grace. Grace When I heard your horse, I thought they'd come back. O'Rourke Who are \"They?\" Grace The Indians. O 'Rourke What tribe was it? Grace J don't know. I can't tell one tribe from another. I just know they were Indians. — Scene from \"Saskatchewan,\" 1954. p'Meara is an embittered Confederate soldier who has moved west to help jthe Sioux fight the Union Army. He meets an alcoholic Indian named ^Walking Coyote, who teaches him about the Sioux. O'Meara Listen, how many tribes are there in your nation? Walking Coyote We're divided into three divisions: -the Santee, the Yankton, 31 and the Teton. I'm an Ogalala. That's one of the seven tribes of the Tetons. Every tribe has a lot of bands. Every band has a chief. I could have been a chief. O'Meara What does \"Sioux\" mean in your language? Walking Coyote It's a French word. . . . Our real name is Lakota. Before scalping got to be the thing to do we used to slit our enemies' throats. O'Meara What's it got to do with the French? Walking Coyote Well, we' were always fighting the Chippewas and when they tied up with the French, they told them we sioux. Sioux means \"cut­ throat.\" Why are you so interested in the Sioux? O'Meara I'd like to be one . . . I'd like to learn your language. Walking Coyote I'd like to learn it to you if St. Christopher will keep you in one piece. — Scene from \"Run of the Arrow,\" 1957. Even the most casual observer would grant that there is a sizable difference between the characterization of Young Wolf in \"Custer's Last Stand\" and Walking Coyote in \"Run of the Arrow.\" Young Wolf is presented as superstitious, frightened, gullible, and barely able to speak a coherent sentence. His references to \"fire water,\" and his humorous reference to a White character as \"Shot Tongue\" are quaint and cute, an image which is buttressed by the White villain's _________________________________________________________________________________________________________3.2J remark that the Indian is \"heap big medicine man.\" On the other hand, Walking Coyote is bilingual. He is able to give a relatively accurate and detailed account of the Sioux [Nation's political and social organization. He explains the linguistic origins of the word \"Sioux,\" and offers to teach a naive and emotionally disturbed White man the ways of the Sioux. Young Wolf represents a stereotyped and derogatory image of a Sioux warrior. He has no identity, no ethnicity, and basically no characteristics by which he might be cate­ gorized as a Sioux. Walking Coyote has information, has a language, has explanations about a variety of cultural and social activities related to the Sioux. Whether or not those pieces of information are accurate, they are presented as part of a complete film world in which Sioux Indians are an integral part. Between stereotyped non-identity and quasi-veracity, lies an even larger body of film images. Poor, maligned , Grace— the survivor of that wagon train massacre in \"Sas­ katchewan\" stated the dilemma bluntly: \"I can't tell one tribe from another. I just know they were Indians.\" One manner by which the accuracy of film depictions of Sioux Indians can be tested is by a comparison of historical and film chronologies. First, a fairly brief historical chronology will be sketched. Second, the development of Indian films as a western sub-genre will be discussed. 33 ‘ Finally, the plots of the various films screened for this study will be surveyed. Overview of Sioux History The history of Sioux-American relations began on shaky grounds. In 1805, Zebulon Pike negotiated a treaty with a Sioux tribe whereby some nine square miles of land at the mouth of the St. Croix River was given up for the construc­ tion of an American fort. The Sioux were to receive $2000. The fort was constructed, the treaty was ratified, but the President never confirmed the treaty, and the money was never paid. Ten years later, a second treaty was negotiated. This 'document, entitled \"A Treaty of Peace and Friendship,\" was Doth ratified and confirmed, for its terms were of great importance. During most of the eighteenth century, the only jEuropean presence on the American Plains was that of the French. French trappers, traders, explorers, and missionar- Les had successfully negotiated friendships with a variety of Indian tribes. During the subsequent French-American pars, those tribes had aligned themselves with the French. Even though those alliances were far removed from the actual oattlefields and though the Indians did little to further the French cause, still the victorious Americans began a process of meticulous negotiations with each tribe. In three separate treaties, various Sioux units pledged \"per­ petual peace and friendship between the United States and 34 individuals of the Teeton Tribe,\" and the chiefs acknowl­ edged \"themselves and their afore said tribe to be under the protection of the U.S.A. and no other nation.\"^ By 1824, diplomatic relations were becoming more com­ plex. There was building pressure on the one hand to elimi­ nate all Indian presence from the Eastern seaboard. There was also pressure brought by traders and mercantile inter­ ests to keep the westward-moving frontier safe for commerce. In 1825, separate treaties were negotiated with the Teton, Yancton, Yanktonai, Ogallala, Hunkpapa, and other Sioux tribes. These treaties sanctified the activities of American-authorized traders and dealers. Non-authorized traders were to be banned from Indian lands, but the Sioux were required to allow free travel to anyone with American authorization. The Sioux also promised never to sell or exchange firearms or other weapons, and promised not to ■retaliate against individual Whites who violated the treaty provision. The Treaty talked about limiting Whites to \"mild and equitable regulations\" but provided neither penalties nor methods for enforcing the informal provisions. These provisions may have had significance in light of later Development, but at the time of negotiation, they were not controversial. None of the tribes received monetary consid­ eration or other forms of remuneration. As the 1825 treaties were being negotiated. President lonroe was beginning to develop the controversial Indian _______________________________________________________________ 3,5j Removal Policy to deal with the Indian population along the populated Eastern Seaboard. The principle points of the Removal Policy were : 1. Removal of all Indians still east of the Mississippi River. 2. Conveyance in fee simple of western lands to replace lands lost in the east. 3. Establishment of self-government among the tribes. 4. Protection of Indians against future White encroach­ ments . The Removal Policy became federal law by act of Congress dated May 28, 18 30. In its solemn preamble, the United States government promised Solemnly to assure the tribe or nation with which the exchange [of land] is made that the United States will forever secure and guarantee to them, and their heirs or successors, the country so exchanged with them and to cause such tribe or nation to be protected at their new residence, against all interruption or disturbance from any other tribe or nation of Indians, or from any other person or persons whatever.^ The federal Removal Policy had almost immediate impact upon the Sioux. By July 15, 1830, the Sioux had agreed to cede a large piece of land in perpetuity to the United States. In return, they were to receive over $5000 a year in money, ifood, animals, and tools, all to be paid for ten years. An Ldditional amount of $3000 per year was to be paid for edu- jcation of Sioux children. Six years later, the Sioux ceded all their lands between the Missouri and Mississippi River to the United States, and further exonerated the United 36 States from \"any guarantee, condition, or limitation\" under the earlier treaties. The next year, the Sioux ceded to the United States all their lands east of the Mississippi, including any islands in that river. In 18 37, the Yankton Sioux ceded back to the united States all the lands it had been granted under an 18 33 treaty. The Removal Policy was in effect until 1850. For the eastern Indians, the policy meant forced relocation and journeys to new \"homes.\" For western Indians, the policy meant retrenching, shrinking land control, sharing of land with enemy tribes, and increasing pressure to move from desirable lands and being cleared for White migration. The period of 1840 to 1853 was characterized by widen­ ing American boundaries and the westward push. Though occurring in different parts of the continent, these devel­ opments helped make westward migration attractive and lucra- jtive, and increased American fervor for a united continent. The impact on the Plains Indians from these events, was disastrous : 1845: Texas admitted to the Union 1846: Oregon controversy settled with U.S. claiming land north of the 49th Parallel. 1848: Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded Mexican lands to the United States in the area now known as California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico 37J 1848: Discovery of gold in California 1850: Sale of lands including Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico to the United States 185 3: Gadsden Purchase of more land in New Mexico and Arizona Spurred on by these developments and, perhaps, anxious to complete the American settlement of the country. Congress and the Army began a new round of treaty negotiations in i l851. For example, a treaty was negotiated with the Minne­ sota Sioux proclaiming that \"The peace and friendship now so tiappily existing . . . shall be perpetual.\" Not of minor 'consequence is the fact that this peaceful document also included a cession of lands in Iowa and eastern Minnesota. The Third Article to the treaty provided rather generous consideration : In part consideration, . . . the United States do hereby set apart for the future occupancy and home of the Dakota Indians, parties to this treaty, to be held for them as Indian lands are held, all that tract of country on either side of the Minnesota River from the Western boundary of the lands herein ceded, east to the Tchay-tam-bay River on the NOrth, and to the Yellow Medicine River on the south side, to extend, on each side, a distance of not less than ten miles from the general course of said river.^ jThis paragraph was eliminated in Washington. The Sioux were to be paid compensation without participation in further negotiations. Compensation for reclaimed lands was set at ten cents per acre. The new treaty provided for 1.7 million dollars as compensation for relocation expenses; $30,000 for the establishment of trade schools ; $12,000 for agricul­ tural and civilization improvements; $6,000 for education; 38 $10,000 for the purchase of goods and provisions; and an annuity of $4 0,000 per year for ten years. Ten years later the failure of the American government to pay many of these provisions was largely responsible for the first significant acts of violence ascribed to the Minnesota Sioux in the early 1860's. If the forties had been a period of national expansion and growth, the fifties was a period of consolidation, protection, and communication. The continuing press of westward migration required the construction of new roads, major construction called for large work crews, and large civilian populations absolutely demanded army protection. The need for garrisoned and strategically positioned troops began to build, and with that need came pressure on Indian tribes to permit such permanent settlements. The First Treaty of Fort Laramie, dated September 17, 18 51, for example, called upon chiefs of the Sioux, Cheyennes, Arapa­ hoe s , Crows, Assinaboines, Gros-Ventre, Mandans, and Arickaras to recognize the American right to build roads and posts wherever desired in order to maintain the peace. In 1858 the Yankton agreed to the building of necessary roads wherever Americans wanted them, as did the Mendawakanton and Wahpakoota Dakota bands that same year. The latter treaty expanded American construction rights from roads and army posts to include schools and shops. However, the treaty promised that a minimal amount of lumber would be used, and 39 that the Indians would be compensated for their timber losses. In 1858, a new reservation system was instituted. Instead of granting very large parcels of lands to entire tribes, the new policy called for individual land grants to Indian families, adult individuals, and minors in trust. The individual grants helped to undermine the influence and significance of tribal leaders and tended to break up the tribes. In addition, individual ownership made it easier for land speculators to acquire land from unschooled owners at low values. The Sisseton Dakota treaty of June 19, 1958, is typical of the new procedures. The treaty identified the land area set up as a reservation in 1851 and then divided it into 80-acre parcels for all eligibles. Remaining lands which were included in the 1851 allotage were taken with neither negotiation nor comment. Congress was authorized to decide the extent and manner of compensation to be paid to the Sioux. That Congressional decision was made in 1860, with compensation to include thirty cents per acre minus the cost of a land survey. In addition, all Whites who had settled on Indian lands \"in good faith . . . believing the same to be government lands\" were entitled to 160 acres each at $1.25 per acre.^ The value of those acres was also to be deducted from the Indian claims. It has already been stated that the 1851 treaty with ______________________________________^ _________________________ 4.0J the Minneconjou Sioux of Minnesota was not enforced. Dis­ satisfaction over failure to receive promised food, live­ stock, and annuities was augmented by the unhappiness among neighboring Sisseton Dakota over the new 1858 Reservation System. Pressure among the Minnesota Indians began to mount by late 1859. The Minneconjou were relatively placid, semi­ agrarian Indians, quite different from their northern Plains ^cousins. Starting in 1859, individual members of the tribe began raiding White settlements--usually for cattle or other jfoods, but occasionally to satisfy revenge or general anger. ■In the meantime, both Indian and White sources were pressing (the government for payment of overdue annuities. Payment of the annuities represented more than an inconvenience to the United States. By 1860, it was appar­ ent that the impending Civil War could not be prevented, and the Union was diverting available resources for a long and co_siü^ war. Payments to Indians were neither tactically nor politically important to the Union. Despite conditions verging on starvation, few among the Northern and Central P_lains tribes received the deliveries of food and clothing upon which they had been counting. General disgruntlement prevailed among the tribes. Among the Minnesota Sioux there was also serious hunger. One final condition remained to spark off the start of the so- called Indian Wars. That condition was also directly related to the Civil 41 War. Reallocation of resources^affected more than Indian payments. Relatively peaceful conditions existed along the Indian frontier. The reservation system instituted in the 1850's was working fairly well. Inter-tribal warfare had lessened significantly, and there were virtually no instances of attacks upon American settlements. The care­ fully developed system of garrisons and forts was cut back as men and supplies were diverted to the eastern fronts. Hence, just as the Minnesota Sioux grievances were becoming most aggravated, the visible Army presence in the area was disappearing. The first major outbreak among the Sioux •became unavoidable. Despite melodramatic headlines, the Sioux Outbreak of 1862 was a relatively minor affair. Approximately twenty isolated settlements were attacked— -primarily for food and livestocks. However, several White women and children were taken hostage and several men were killed. The written narratives of some of the captive women became a form of popular literature during the mid-1860's. Written after successful rescue from the Sioux, these remem­ brances were frequently lurid, melodramatic, and of ques­ tionable historical accuracy. Nevertheless, they had great impact in rousing anti-Indian fervor back east, contributed to developing stereotypes of Indian behavior, and helped further Indian-White enmity in ensuing years. Miss: Ann Coleson's Narrative of Her Captivity Among the Sioux Indians is typical of the Minnesota narrative 42 documents. Miss Coleson described an Indian attack on an isolated settlement, a forced march to a camp, life in the Sioux village, and her ultimate rescue. Her description of the initial attack is particularly shocking: The infant as it fell from her arms, was seized by a huge wolf dog, and actually devoured alive. One of the other children, a boy about three years old, screamed and wept at the dreadful fate of the baby. This irritated the savages. One of them took him by the heels, dashed him against a tree, stabbed and scalped him, then threw him also into the fire.^ A similar account is found in the narrative of Mrs. 'N. D. White, a captive among the Sioux from August 18 to Leptember 26, 18 62. However, her narrative included some Dackground not present in the first account. She talked about the scarcity of buffalo and the failure of the army to distribute the June annuity: The Indians were compelled to ward off starvation by digging roots for food. Three or four weeks previous to the outbreak, we could see squaws almost every day wandering over the prairie in search of the nutritious roots.® Another victim, Mrs. De Camp Sweet had lived amicably among the Sioux for a year before the uprising. She also talked about the Civil War and the resulting problems with delivery of the annuities. While Mrs. Sweet described in detail the \"brutalities perpetrated during those dreadful days\"® she also offered some additional comments as to the condition of the Indians : There was a great amount of suffering among the Indians, as their crops had been bad from drought and cut-worms, and there was much sickness attendant upon starvation, of which there were actual cases . . . There were many things of almost daily occurrence which showed that the Indians were very much dissatisfied with their condition, but we gave no 43 heed, supposing it had always before been so, and knowing there was much jealousy between the various bands. The Minnesota Uprising was sufficiently dramatic, but it was a minor event in the Indian Wars. Although the army did execute thirty-eight Sioux warriors in December, 1862, it is still unclear how many Whites died during the short rebel­ lion. Almost all of the women and children kidnapped by the Sioux were rescued in fairly good condition. In the long run, though, the statistics are unimportant. The uprising, publicity, and executions raised fears among the settlers and may have raised militance of other tribes. From 186 2 I onward, there was pressure from frontier newspapers, army officials, and politicians to do something about the \"Indian Problem.\" One popular solution was the development of United States Voluntary Cavalry in states faced with Indian troubles. A poster dated August 13, 186 4, appeared in ^Central City, Colorado, calling for a company of one hundred day cavalry \"for immediate service against hostile Indians.\"^ ^ The advertisement offered an additional inducement: \"The company will also be entitled to all lorses and other plunder taken from the Indians.\" Another type of response is embodied in the title of jan Act of Congress, dated March 3, 1863 : \"An Act for the jRemoval of the Sisseton, Wahpaton, Medawakanton, and Wahpa­ koota Bands of Sioux or Dakota Indians, and for the Disposi­ tion of their Lands in Minnesota and Dakota.\" The Sioux 44 were to be moved outside the limits of any state, and their lands were to be appraised by \"discreet persons\" and sold to the highest bidder. Still another solution was posed in a letter to the St. Paul Daily Press. The writer argued for a campaign Lo free Minnesota for development of the Northern Pacific Railroad, for greater access to the gold fields of Washington and Dakota, and for full settlement of the Dakotas. He sug­ gested the total elimination of 46,860 Sioux, Chippewas, Menomonees, and Winnebagos on a Penal Indian Colony to be Lstablished on Isle Royale in Lake Superior. The values of such an action were clear: The complete extinction of Sioux pretensions to the soil in the Dakota Territory will be worth, at least, $2 million.\"^® The life envisioned in the Penal Colony was to be a bleek one : Total disarmament, except a fish-hook, total non-intercourse by whites, unless by Missionaries and other Government officials-- a revenue cutter guarding the exits and entrances of the island — every possible encouragement of agriculture and fishery, but the principle recognized that starvation would be barely averted by government assistance— these are the leading features of the only practical measure which the necessities of the case submit for our consideration.^ ^ Friction between Americans and Indians continued to Duild. The eradication of the Sioux uprising in Minnesota coincided with passage of the federal Homestead Act in 186 2. The completion of the Civil War and the westward movement of jthe railroads increased the demands for an Indian-free land freed for American migration and settlement. By 186 5, the 45 federal government was again involved in the process of negotiating treaties with the various tribes. The six treaties negotiated with the various parts of the Sioux nation were similar. The Sioux acknowledged them­ selves to be subject to American authority, they agreed not to attack other tribes and to submit inter-tribal disputes to American arbitrators. They agreed to move to a smaller, agriculturally oriented reservation and to allow the construction and use of a reservation road by any authorized Americans. The Sioux were to withdraw from existing over­ land routes and from those routes which might be built in the future. By 186 5, it was clear that there was at least some relationship between the Minnesota uprising and the failure of government sources to comply with valid treaty provi­ sions. The new treaty proposals included some controversial items. The Honorable Walter A. Burleigh, of Dakota, attacked the \"fraudulent treaties\" in the House of Represen­ tatives. Aware that the elimination of Indian land rights had sealed the \"Red Man’s\" destiny, Burleigh said: The advance guard of civilization crossed the western boundaries, of Iowa and Minnesota in search of homes in Dakota . . . Instead of being one vast waste, as then, we now have a rapidly improving country, dotted over with the fruitful fields and happy homes of an enterprising, . . . liberty-loving people. The rude wigwam of the savage has given place to comfortable habitations of intelli­ gent industry . . . The foot prints of the Caucasian are every­ where visible in the soil of all our western territories.^^ To Congressman Burleigh, the destiny of the Indian was Dne thing. The Indians' treatment by the United States Gov- _____________ 4.6J ërhmeht \"was\"ahotheif 7 Hëniëno“ ühced~Tlîë~ 1865”~Sioux treaties as \"not worth the paper they disgrace.\"In the first place, Burleigh cited statistics estimating the total Sioux ■ population at 18,480. Only 297 Sioux were present at the treaty negotiations. Among the particularly belligerent Uncpapa Sioux, over 2,700 braves were represented by what the Congressman called \"fourteen irresponsible Sioux mem­ bers. \"Why sir,\" said Burleigh, I am astonished at the whole transaction. The consummate stupid­ ity which planned these negotiations is only surpassed by the reprehensible meanness in which their details have been carried out. ^ The validity of the Sioux acceptance of the treaty was questionnable. It was questionable in terms of the author­ ity of the treaty signers to act for their tribe. It was also questionable as to the information the Indians had about what they were signing. Article VIII of the treaty provided as follows : Any amendment or modification of this treaty by The Senate of the United States shall be considered final and binding upon the said band . . . as a part of this treaty, in the same manner as if it had been subsequently presented and agreed to by the chiefs and headmen of said band.^® jrhe most significant provision of the treaty— that which called for Sioux withdrawal from any American overland route — was never presented to the Indians for approval. It was simply added by Congressional action. Rep. Burleigh sug­ gested a reason for activity: Several, if not all, of the parties present as the pretended representatives of their respective tribes positively refused to grant it, and stated that their tribes would not consent to any such arrangement.^ ® 47 The 1865 general peace treaties were supposed to have final­ ized peace on the frontier, to have consolidated the agi­ tated Sioux in a controllable location, and to have assured the free development of transportation and railroads across the Plains. By presenting eager Whites with presumptions of safety and by encouraging patriotic claims of manifest destiny, the new treaties escalated bitterness, anger, and violence on all sides. The first major confrontation occurred during June, 1866, when Col. H. B. Carrington's expedition left Fort Phil Kearney with the assignment of building two new army forts to protect the Montana Road along the Platte River. The second site chosen was well within the Ogalalla Sioux hunt­ ing grounds near the Powder River, a hunting terrain which was clearly demarkated in existing treaties. When Col. Carrington persisted in constructing his fort. Chief Red Cloud took action. On December 21, 18 66, a wood-gathering detail headed by Col. Fetterman was attacked. All eighty- one soldiers with him were killed. During the history of the \"Indian campaigns\" only the Custer massacre at the Little Big Horn resulted in a higher fatality list for American soldiers. Just as the Minnesota uprisings helped to focus and intensify American determination to deal with the Indian problem, so the Fetterman Massacre rallied calls for army repraisals and expeditions of volunteer militia established _4.8 to make the country safe. Col. Carrington's illegal fort was completed, and army units regularly patrolled to assure the safety of the Montana Road. Only after the Northern Pacific Railroad completed its northern route, did the army reluctantly abandon its forts and turn the land and road back to Red Cloud's people. The army's failure to keep the peace resulted in sev­ eral government inquiries. In 186 7 a Commission was appointed to investigate the Indian problem. Consisting of three army officers of Brigadier General rank or above, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the Chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Commission, the panel was delegated to negotiate with the hostile tribes, to secure the frontiers and railroads, to eliminate the causes for further warfare, and to devise some plan for civilizing the Indians. The Commission took a hard look at federal Indian policy. The final report noted that the causes of continued warfare were to be found in the government's failure to enforce legal treaties. Congress was blamed for a wavering, ‘ inconsistent, and injust policy. The government was urged to concentrate all Indians on two super-reservations. The Commission's Report was advisory, and as that, it jwas basically ignored. The pattern of treaty negotiations continued. A Sioux treaty which was negotiated in the fall of 186 7 had not even been ratified by the summer of 1868. The provisions which had been promised to see the tribe 49 through that winter couldn't possibly have been delivered. The lessons available from the Minnesota uprisal went ignored as Indians again dug for roots and scavenged in order to avoid starvation. By the late 1860's, peaceful solutions were beginning to disappear. The press of immigration was becoming intense, and the gradual destruction of great buffalo herds was speed­ ing up. The Sioux were dependent upon the roving herds and upon their own free and nomadic movement across open land. Without the buffalo and without their land, the Sioux way of life was in fact doomed. The last attempt at major treaty negotiations was also the most famous. Convened at Fort Laramie, in the Territory of Wyoming, the Laramie Conference involved the Sioux— Brule, Ogalalla, Miniconjou, Yanktonai, Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, Cut- head, Two Kettle, Sans Arcs, and Santee— and the Arapahoe. The meeting began on April 29, 1868. The final act of Senate ratification occurred on February 16, 1869. Like many treaties before it, the Laramie Conference dealt primarily with land. There were pledges of peace and promises to defend Indian property. The military posts on the Montana Road were abandoned and the road itself was closed to American traffic. The United States agreed to construct warehouses, storerooms, housing for a permanent Indian Agent, and an agency building for his necessary busi­ ness. There were to be buildings for a permanent physician, 50 for a carpenter, farmer, blacksmith, miller, engineer, and teacher. Title to separate tracts of land were reserved for individuals and families. As was the case with other treaties, the Laramie Conference agreed to the delivery on August 1 each year for thirty years of goods representing clothing, food, agricultural implements, and other items. The most important aspect of the treaty, though, dealt with land. Under the reservation boundaries specified in the treaty, the twenty-two million acres representing the southwest corner of the Dakota territory was set aside as a permanent Sioux homeland. In exchange for vast land rights elsewhere in Dakota and in Wyoming, the Sioux gained title- by-treaty to the area known as the Black Hills. As stipu­ lated in Article II of the treaty, this land was \"set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Indians herein named, for such other friendly tribes or individual Indians as from time to time they may be willing, with the consent of the United States, to admit amongst them; and the United States now solemnly agrees that no persons except those herein designated to and authorized so to do, and except such officers, agents, and employees of the government as may be authorized to enter upon Indian reservations in dis­ charge of duties enjoined by law, shall ever be permitted to pass over, settle upon, or reside in the territory described in this article.^® 'For five years, the Laramie Treaty brought a semblance of peace. Then gold was discovered in the Black Hills of I jDakota, almost exactly in the middle of the new reservation. jJold fever meant uncontrollable hordes of prospectors, merchants, and settlers. It also meant renewed efforts by the Northern Pacific Railroad to extend its line west across 51 the Dakotas to the Pacific Ocean. In 1871, the railroad's first surveying expeditions were conducted under army protection. One party surveyed the Powder River. Another prepared for a railroad line towards Billings, North Dakota. A new fort. Fort McKcan^ large enough to house three infantry companies, was built at the mouth of the Heart River, and Fort Abraham Lincoln was built nearby. In 187 3, General George Armstrong Custer supervised the completion of Ft. Lincoln and carried out his first maneuvers against the Sioux and Cheyenne. The sudden creation of army positions around the Dakotas and the large growth in military activity within the Army's Department of the Dakota was a natural response to the dangerous situation facing White gold miners on Sioux land. The need for both defensive and offensive action came at a propitious time. The Civil War had been over for almost ten years and during that time there had been little military action in the country. The army was ready both tactically and psychologically to demonstrate its competence. The Indian wars were expected to be easily won and brief campaigns. Instead, the Indian campaigns proved to^be tedious and difficult. The army was used to traveling fully equipped with cook wagons, cannon, supply wagons, and the like. Their horses ate from feed bags, were shod, and carried close to 250 pounds in rider, ammunition, and clothing. The Sioux traveled as lightly as possible, ate dried meat in the 52 saddle, did not ride in formation, and changed direction with ease. Their horses ate wild grasses which did not have to be transported. The endurance of the Plains pony is legendary. In addition, the Sioux knew their terrain— a land of broad plateaus, high cliffs, alkaline deserts, quicksand, and impassable rivers. The army moved in long, noisy, dusty columns and were often visible for miles. Unfortunately for the Sioux, the army also had superior fire power— even the best archer could be blown out of a saddle by a target who was too distant to be hit by an arrow. The army also had its brand new repeating rifles, which required no loading time between shots. Even more important were the new Gatling guns, the Plains version of the machine gun. Pitted together— natural talent versus mechanical talent, the machines nearly always won. The pattern of Indian attacks and army pursuits wore down the Sioux, frag­ mented them, and killed them off. Beginning in 187 3 and continuing through 1876 the Indians fought a holding pattern at best and were routed at worst. Though there were other, lesser successes, only the summer of 1876 offered a truly undeniable Indian victory. The Battle of the Little Big Horn, fought June 25, 1876, was nine days short of American's Centennial celebra­ tion. In the months before. Crazy Horse's village had been 53 attacked on the Powder River. Sitting Bull had joined with Cheyenne and other Sioux tribes and were together in the Little Big Horn, Custer departed Generals Terry and Gibbon with 583 enlisted men, 31 officers, 5 White scouts, 31 Indian scouts, his nephew, his brother, and a correspondent for the j New York Herald newspaper. Amassed against them were virtually the entire warrior population of the Uncpapas, Santees, Yanktonais, Blackfeet, Minneconjous, San Arces, ^Northern Cheyenne, and Arapahoes. That Custer was defeated under such conditions is not surprising. Also not surpris­ ing was the American response to defeat. Little Big Horn was simultaneously the greatest Sioux victory and its ulti­ mate defeat. The army ranks were swelled with hundreds of jvolunteer Indian fighters out to avenge the death of a hero. Pursuit was relentless through the remaining months of 1876, and the Indian position was hopeless. First Crazy Horse surrendered, bringing the remains of jhis tribe to Camp Robinson in northwest Nebraska. He and his people stayed in camp through the summer. When Crazy Horse became restless, he was arrested and imprisoned. On September 5, 1877, Crazy Horse was shot and killed by an army guard, reportedly during an attempted escape. Red Cloud's people went to the Pine Ridge reservation. ■Spotted Tail and his group went to the Rosebud. Sitting Bull and Gall fled north to Canada, where they eked out a yery meager existence until 18 80 when they again crossed the Dorder and surrendered to American forces. 54 By 1880, the Sioux had been settled in six reserva­ tions: Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Rosebud, Crow Creek, Lower Brule, and Pine Ridge. Agriculture was difficult because the soil was poor, and even more so because the Indians had no desire to till soil. The appointment of Indian Agents was very much a part of the political spoils system prevalent in the 1870's and 1880's, and claims of corruption and mismanagement at the reservation level were frequent. Rainfall improved in the early 1880's though, and agriculture became easier. Also, the development of a grow­ ing cattle industry provided alternate forms of sustenance. Still, the Sioux were dependent upon the United States for treaty-mandated food, monies, and provisions. In 1887, the United States again revised the reserva­ tion system. Despite a clear provision in previous treat­ ies that changes could be made only with the support of 3/4 of the adult male population, a provision was pushed through to again divide the reservation into individually owned parcels. The motivating factor, once again, was the rail­ road, in this case, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul 'Railroad Company, which wanted to secure a route directly Lcross the reservation from Chamberlin to the Black Hills in the Dakotas. Under the sponsorship of Senator Dawes, legis­ lation was developed which provided the necessary land jdivision. A Grand Council of Indian Chiefs was held in Washington, ostensibly for the purpose of negotiating a new treaty. In due course, each of the Indians spoke. Chief 55 John Grass called for enforcement of the 1868 treaty speci­ fications. Then he said. Think of our fathers and grandfathers. They used to own all of these lands which the white man now lives upon. They were once ours, but we have been driven away from them. We are a poor and ignorant people, and you are the cause of our being poor. Looking back, I say to you that whatever we ask should have due consideration. Put the key which opens our reservation in our pockets for a while.^ ^ The following day. Secretary of the Interior Vilas explained, in clear terms, the government's position on the reservation The most important thing is the opening of the reservation. What you say shows that you are willing to have it opened if the terms and arrangements are satisfactory, and I think it should be done. It is probable that whatever might be done, the opening of the reservation cannot long be postponed. You are men of sense, and you can see how white people are pressing around your reservation on every side. The process was time-consuming, but on August 6, 1889, the New York Herald reported the final signing of the new treaty: It was the consent of Gall, the great soldier of the Sioux, that settled the fate of the negotiations carried on by General Crook and his fellow Commissioners. Not until [Gall] learned that the Government could, if it wished, take the soil without the consent of the tribes, did the Chief touch the pen held out to him, and thus signify to his people that the struggle was over. The Indians are very bitter in spirit. The Chiefs admit that they simply bowed to superior force.^ ^ The year 1890 saw the rise of the Ghost Dance Religion— a mystical philosophy which was based upon faith that a messiah would arise to reunite the Indians and bring back the old ways of life. On Christmas morning, 1890, American troops attempted to put down a supposed insurrection by fir­ ing on a Sioux village encamped at Wounded Knee. The massacre at Wounded Knee represented the last shots of the Indian campaigns. 56 History Made in Hollywood : Indian Images in General By the time movie makers discovered them, westerns were already an established part of American popular culture. First, through the stories of western writers like Bret Harte, Mark Twain, and James Fenimore Cooper, and then through the specialized exaggerations of Ned Buntline and Alfred Henry Lewis, western heroes, themes, and locales were clearly established. The western, then, was well- established by the end of the nineteenth century. With the publication of Owen Wister's The Virginian in 190 2, however, the genre began to soar in popularity. Tom Curry was the author of over 125 western novels, and scores of novelettes and short stories. In 1965 he reminisced about the rise of western popular literature : The Virginian didn't finish the Western. Thousands of writers, generation after generation, have made and still make a living griiiding out these yarns. . . . Many appeared in the defunct pulp magazines, so-called because of the unbleached wood-pulp paper on which they were printed. The pulps had taken over the field from the lurid dime novel, often forbidden to the young, who read them behind the barn or under the blanket. In the teens and twenties there were doz­ ens of Western magazines, with circulations running to hundreds of thousands each. Street and Smith's Western Story Magazine was a weekly, and for a time it printed half a million copies an issue.^ ^ The pulps died out after World War II, killed by a double blast from the new, slick magazines and the arrival of tele­ vision. But in the early years cheap, low-quality western yarns and brief, crude western films supported each other and reinforced the popularity of the genre. 57 n It is important to no't^~that the end of the open plains the disappearance of the great buffalo herd, the elimination of the \"Permanent Indian Frontier\" and its replacement with ghetto-ized Indian enclaves, the criss-crossing of rail transportation, and the final westward march of civiliza­ tion, settlement, industry, and commerce was only completed less than two decades before The Virginian appeared. The colonization of the American continent was one of the swift­ est, and most amazing events in world history. George Fenin, the film historian and student of film westerns, sees the western period in near-mythic terms : [T]he swiftness and proportion of the Westward march of colonization can only be matched by the Russian conquest of Siberia, begun by the great Yermak in 1579 and highlighted in 1638 by the founding of Ochotsk, an event that brought the Slavs to the shores of the Pacific, after they had crossed an entire continent. The American trek to the West . . . started to materialize in the fifty years following 1770. When the great Anglo- Saxon immigration declined, there came German political refu­ gees, discontented Englishmen, starving Irish and Italians, adventurous Russians and Poles— all of whom looked to the new land with hope. They were the advance patrol of an army of 35 million immigrants that was to land on American shores in the nineteenth century, filling those Eastern cities deserted by Americans who had migrated to virgin lands, or simply following in the wake of the Westward Ho! march. [By 1900], the \"Frontier\" was no longer \"contemporary time,\" but the best and most efficient proof of the vitality of a new nation, of its dynamic imperialism based on racial arro­ gance, economic realism, and wistful idealism. Although the physical and geographical boundaries to the Frontier disappeared with the twentieth century, the concept of frontier is still with us— compounded and expanded by the 58 western genre. According to Michael Peacock, in 1956 the Controller of Britain's BBC-1 Television Network, the myth of the American west is the \"only universal myth in the world today, unique and pure, and so thoroughly exploited by books, maga­ zines, motion pictures, and now TV, that it shows no signs of dying away . . . There has never been a frontier like the American. It carries the romance of the lawless civilization, where the land was to be had for the claiming, where people had a chance to start again, and where a man could always ride out of town. In Europe, and indeed practically all of the world, people seldom have a chance to make a new start or to ride off from the lives they were born to. Encompassing land rushes, overland trails, cattle drives, competition for fur trades, gold and silver lodes, building jcf railroads, strewing of telegraph wires, founding towns, eliminating outlaws, conquering deserts, discovering moun­ tain passes, and eradicating all human and physical objects 'in the path, the westward movement does in fact possess important mythic qualities. As George Fenin puts it. The Frontier is, in fact, the only mythological tissue avail­ able to this young nation. Its gods and semi-gods, their passions and ideals, the fatality of events, the sadness and glory of death, the struggle of Good and Evil-— all these archaic themes have found in the Western myth the ideal ground for a liaison with the Olympic World, in a refreshing symbiosis between Hellenic thought and Yankee dynamism . . . This epoch represents the combined, collective efforts of great and different masses of people, sparked with the manifestations of a striking individualism. It is an era in which the American • believes, for his intellectual and physical approach to it is . . . fully satisfied. The individualist finds a saturation of ideals in the conquest of Nature and the law of the gun. And the collectivist realizes that the frontier movement took the combined efforts of masses to plough the earth, raise satisfactory hoof and horn cattle, [and] create towns and cities.^ ^ If the object of the Western Myth was civilization and 59 progress, and if the prime enactors of the myth were to be classically heroic, brave, virtuous, omniscient, omnipotent, white-hatted, and white-faced, it is not surprising that one of the most important evil forces was to be the Indian. True-firing heroes and hoop-skirted heroines, endangered wagon trains, and freshly constructed homes represented the almost certain future: White, European, and Victorious. Indians, with their poetic statements, noble visages, quaint ceremonies, and simple ways of life represented an indisput­ able past. Indians and westward-moving Whites represented irreconcilable life styles. The free and uninterrupted hunting of one group prevented the transportation, communi­ cation, and ensettlement of the other. The successful urbanization of prairies by the newcomers meant the loss of food, clothing, and housing to the other. From the begin­ ning, western films depicted a clash of cultures. But it presented that clash from the standpoint of a mythic dychot- omy of Good and Evil. Forces of Good moved society towards its future. Forces of Evil got in the way. Even when the depiction of Indians is avowedly sympathetic and kind, the ultimate resolutions usually make clear that the Indian cause can not succeed. Indeed, how could it be otherwise? Try as they might, the movies can't really re-write historyj In very broad terms, the history of Indian images in films is in : |our stages. In the early, silent years are some of the fullest developed and most sensitive depictions -60- of Indians. Coinciding with the glitterization of cowboy heroes in the teens, the second stage began. In this period^ images of Indians were evil, villainous, and loathesome--but in a superficial way. The Indians were melodramatic villains--symbol3 of evil with no personality or character beneath the surface. World War II produced the third stage in Indian imagery : an almost total reversal from Indian as Villain to Indian as Hero. In the mid-sixties, the de-myth- ification of the hero lead to a réévaluation of villains as well. A quasi-balanced image of the Indian developed in a variety of films. The films representing the first stage in film imagery 'are basically not available for study. However, reviews and other critical writings: indicate that these earliest of film images were frequently sympathetic and dimensioned. Perhaps the fact that Indians and the Indian Wars were still a part of living memory contributed to the qualities of the earlier jfilms. Possibly the presence of knowledgeable technical advisors, as well as actual Indian costumes, jewelry, lodges, and other artifacts, helped to establish a sense of historical veracity. In a 1959 article in Films in Review, Jack Spears noted that Indian screen images have either been jthat of stereotyped villains or stereotyped noble savages. According to Mr. Spears, the exception was in the first decade of the film era : Curiously enough, many of the best movies about Indians are to be found among the early films of the silent era. Soon- 61 after the pattern of the Western melodrama was set by Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903), and by the Broncho Billy pictures, the Indian began to appear as a central char­ acter in Westerns. At first he was portrayed as a dignified hero of tribal life dramas, in which he dealt sentimentally with courtship and marriage, emphasized the loyalties of the tribe, and went to his death to avoid dishonor.^® Among the films which Spears lists as examples of the earlier films, are Vitagraph*s \"Red Wing's Gratitude\" and \"An Indian Wife's Devotion,\" Biograph's \"Squaw's Love,\" Ince's \"Little Dove's Romance,\" and Selig's \"An Indian's Gratitude.\" The early films of D. W. Griffith also included many dealing with Indian themes. \"The Redman and the Child\" (1908) , dealt with a White child's effect on a savage. \"Indian Runner's Romance,\" \"Redman's View,\" \"Comata the Sioux,\" and Griffith's sentimental and sympathetic \"Ramona\" are said to have presented relatively objective depictions of Indian subjects. The relocation of the major film studios from the east coast to California spurred the development of Indian films on more epic scales. The extent of open land and the variety of terrain near Los Angeles led to films such as \"Crossing the American Prairies in the Early Fifties\" with major scenes in which a wagon train is attacked by Indians and Griffith's \"The Massacre\" with its recreation of Custer at the Little Big Horn. While the earlier films frequently utilized real Indians in attempts at veracity, Griffith and the later epic western directors worked with their own acting companies, 62 using White performers for American as well as Indian roles. According to Spears, Griffith players like James Kirkwood, Billy Quick, and Mary Pickford portrayed Indians in a wide variety of films. White actors portraying Red was the rule, rather than the exception. Fred J. Balshofer, co-founder of Bison Pic­ tures, wrote about making a film in 1909: We had acquired a story with the unlikely name of \"The True Heart of an Indian\" and had hired an actor who also had done some work with the Biograph, to play the Indian character lead. The actor . . . was Charles Inslee, who wore a black wig parted in the center with two braids that reached below his shoulders. He was costumed in a breechcloth, giving him an excellent opportunity to display his fine physique. Again we used Evelyn Graham as the leading lady, and for realism and color, we added two authentic Indians to the cast. Young Deer and his wife Red Wing.^® 'Mary Pickford was probably Griffith's most popular star. In their earlier years, she played an almost ceaseless proces­ sion of Indian parts : As I had dark eyes, I had to play Indian maidens, and Indian dramas were very frequent in the early picture days. I had my head in a bowl of bolarmenia— the skin stain for Indian make­ up— all the time. With heavy black wig, alligator teeth round my neck, leather clothes and beaded leggings. I'd have to tramp day after day over the hills.®® These early film images were not materially accurate, DUt they were at least sympathetic. In addition to Griffith, the development of \"The Noble Savage\" as a film stereotype was advanced by the works of Thomas Ince. Trying to compete l^rith the very popular films starring Tom Mix, Ince hired a Wild West Circus— complete with cowboys, Indians, and live­ stock— for a series of films. Ince films, including titles 63 like \"Across the Plains,\" \"Custer's Last Fight,\" and \"The Indian Massacre\" were well-researched and at least somewhat realistic. Western film historian, William K. Everson, identified Ince's \"The Indian Massacre\" as meticulous not only in documenting the Indian's way of life, but in establishing him as a human being of nobility and recognizable emotions. \"The Indian Massacre\" was one of the best of these films, presenting both sides of the picture, stressing the problems and courage of the white settlers, but emphasizing most of all the tragedy of the relentless extermination of the Indian.® ^ Jack Spears described .another film, \"The Heart of an Indian\": There were many authentic touches in costume, facial decoration of the men, arrangement and construction of the Indian village, and an Indian burial with the body of the dead warrior laid out on the high stilted platform— used by many of the Plains tribes and with redskins weeping, wailing, and harming themselves. The genuine Indians from the Miller Brothers Circus . . . gave the Ince films a realism lacking in the Edison Company's films, in which the \"Indians\" were ludicrous. After 1915, interest in Indian subjects and characters waned among filmmakers. A very successful wave of cowboy stars was promoted, and such personalities as William S. Hart, "
