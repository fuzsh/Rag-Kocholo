        "text": "Do you want to write in the adventure genre but need help conjuring compelling and adventure-packed stories and concepts? Sometimes reading simple story prompts is the easiest way to get those creative juices flowing.\n\nWe get our ideas from many sources — news headlines, novels, television shows, movies, our lives, our fears, our phobias, etc. They can come from a scene or moment in a film that wasn’t fully explored. They can come from a single visual that entices the creative mind — a seed that continues to grow and grow until the writer is forced to finally put it to paper or screen.\n\nIn the spirit of helping writers find those seeds, here we offer 101 originally conceived adventure story prompts that you can use as inspiration for your next adventure story.\n\nThey may inspire screenplays, novels, short stories, or even smaller moments that you can include in what stories you are already writing.\n\nCommon Elements in the Adventure Genre\n\nAdventure movies are the action genre's closest relative. They are seemingly one and the same beyond a single element — location.\n\nAdventure movies are best defined as action movies set within an exotic location — something beyond an otherwise anonymous big city or small town.\n\nThey entail a character — or cast of characters — traveling to a new world, or many worlds, to attain what they so desire.\n\nIndiana Jones movies globe-trot to many different locations.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean franchise takes us to many worlds across the open waters of the ocean.\n\nThe Goonies takes children into the underground caves of a pirate's treasure.\n\nThe Jumanji franchise takes characters into the jungle worlds of a videogame.\n\nJungle Cruise took us down the waters of the Amazon River.\n\nAgain, the key difference between a straightforward action movie and an adventure movie is location, location, location.\n\nNotable adventure sub-genres include:\n\nDisaster Flicks — The adventure aspect of these types of films entails characters struggling to survive through seemingly impossible and yes, disastrous, circumstances. The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno, San Andreas, almost every Roland Emmerich movie, etc. These are all disaster flicks that take us on the ultimate adventure of survival. They can often be blended genres set within the context of natural disasters, alien invasions, and post-apocalyptic situations. In these cases, the disaster itself creates a unique location.\n\nQuests — The word quest is perhaps the most simple term to market. The mere mention of it entails a MacGuffin — a plot device in the form of some goal, desired object, or other motivators that the protagonist pursues — and the grand adventure of attaining it. The Indiana Jones franchise as a whole is perhaps the most well-known of this sub-genre.\n\nNote: Because we’re all connected to the same pop culture, news headlines, and inspirations, any similarity to any past, present, or future screenplays, novels, short stories, television pilots, television series, plays, or any other creative works is purely coincidence. These story writing prompts were conceived on the fly without any research or Google search for inspiration.\n\n101 Adventure Story Prompts\n\n1.
