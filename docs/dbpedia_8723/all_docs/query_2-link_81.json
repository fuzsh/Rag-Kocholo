        "text": "How to use film music:\n\nFilm music for YouTube\n\nRegardless of whether you are working on short films or independent films, if you intend to share your projects on YouTube, you must ensure you obtain the correct music license first. YouTube’s Content ID software checks every uploaded video against a vast database to make sure no copyright infringement is occurring. Videos found to be in violation of copyright laws, meaning they are using music they do not have the rights to, are generally muted or taken down. To avoid this, get your YouTube film music from PremiumBeat. We have simplified the music licensing process for you so all you need to do is select the license that meets the needs of your project and pay a one-time fee to download your track and add it to your Youtube video.\n\nFilm music for intros\n\nStock music libraries such as PremiumBeat offer a wide range of music ideal for film intros. With diverse genres to explore, you can easily find the perfect track to kick off your film. Adding music to your film’s initial establishing shot is an excellent way to keep viewers engaged and set the tone of what is to come. For a strong piece of music that will introduce your audience to your film, head to the PremiumBeat search engine. Explore tracks that match your film’s genre, or search for songs that feature the specific instruments or pacing you would like to hear. Any track you download from PremiumBeat also comes with shorter segments of the song in 15-, 30-, and 60-second short clips, making it that much easier to edit into your film.\n\nFilm music for trailers\n\nEpic music generally performs well in film trailers but the specific genre of your trailer will ultimately affect the track you choose. A trailer for a comedic film, for example, would be better off with quirky, lighthearted music than somber and intense tracks. You can easily find music to match the genre and mood of your trailer by heading to the PremiumBeat search engine. Look at the filters on the left side of the page. Click “Genres” and scroll down to “Production / Film Scores” to find tracks best suited for films in the Action, Dramedy, Horror genre and beyond. You can also select “Trailer” music from the “Production / Film Scores” category to check out tracks specifically created with trailers in mind."
