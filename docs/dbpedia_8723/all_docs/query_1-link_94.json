        "text": "In John Fordâs 1950 Western Wagon Master, the protagonist, Travis Blue, is asked whether he has ever drawn his gun on anyone. âNo, sir. Just snakes,â Blue answers. Later, after he shoots the villain dead, someone questions him. âI thought you never drew on a man?â\n\nâThatâs right, sir,â the hero responds coolly. âOnly on snakes.â\n\nJoss Whedon says itâs one of the first cool-hero quips he remembers, and it has stuck with him all of these years. When a hero finally defeats his enemy, he says, âI think itâs a given that theyâre going to have a zinger or callback prepared.â\n\nItâs obvious that the Western genre has been a major influence on Whedon: While at Wesleyan University, he studied under Richard Slotkin, a renowned academic who has written extensively on the frontier and its relationship to culture and the media. Although Firefly, the prematurely canceled Fox series about a renegade crew of space smugglers, might be the only Whedon project to make the influence of American Westerns explicit, all of his work seems interested in telling stories about outsiders and their struggles with using their unique powers.\n\nThough Whedon says that âAmerican narrative has always structured itself around losers,â superhero movies require acquiescence to their own set of genre rules. With Avengers: Age of Ultron, which hits theatersÂ May 1, Whedon found himself facing the challenge of making a sequel to his wildly successful 2012 blockbuster The Avengers that would both feel new and still please the seriesâ longtime fans.\n\nA few weeks ago, I received a heart-stopping notification that â@JossWhedon is now following you on Twitter!â As a lifelong devotee of nearly every one of his projects (I have photographic evidence of dressing as Dr. Horrible for Halloween as a teenager), I couldnât resist sending him a direct message. In an act of celebrity magnanimity previously unprecedented, Mr. Whedon agreed to an interview.\n\nIt has become a clichÃ©d suggestion to ânever meet your heroes.â Unfortunately, thatâs a life lesson Iâll still need to struggle through at a later juncture as I was privileged to learn that Whedon is as funny, forthcoming, insightful, self-deprecating, and kind as any of his projects might lead one to believeâa modern renaissance man who knows his Macbeth as well as he knows his Marvel, and who turned âcult classicâ into mainstream cool with old-fashioned talent and hard work.\n\nCan I ask what youâre working on now? I imagine youâre the type of person who likes to have something going at all times.\n\nYeah, and Iâm trying desperately to be the person who doesnât have something going at all times. Iâm trying to take a vacation for the first time in several years and weâll see how it goes. Iâm nosing around ideas, but I donât have a job, I donât have a deal, I donât have a pitch; I have this beautiful artistic void that I donât get to have a lot. So I gleefully can answer that question with, ânothing.â\n\nOf course, all of your fans are going to think every free moment you have is spent gearing up for Dr. Horrible Two.\n\nThat is not the case. Everything is âbring back this,â âbring back that,â which is great, because theyâre not tweeting âFor the love of God, donât make any more of that.â And Dr. Horrible Two is very much in the mix â¦ But I also think this is an opportunity for me to create something new, really new, and itâs been a while. Because I did two Avengers movies, the S.H.I.E.L.D. show, and Much Ado About Nothing, none of which were original to me. So thatâs a long time.\n\nWhatâs it like when youâre sitting down to write for characters that already exist versus characters of your own mind? Do you approach it differently?\n\nNot really. I mean, thereâs a set of parameters. And so much of my writing has been for television that as soon as you have the person and thereâs a task, the parameters are there. So writing a movie like The Avengers, where half the cast or more was already in place, was not that different. When youâre sitting down and creating something completely out of the whole cloth, you have more question marks, but at the end of the day youâre just trying to find the coolest tradition of the thing you want to convey. And if you know whoâs going to be playing that or what the character is, those are boxes you would have had to check anyway.\n\nWith something like The Avengers, when so much of it was already set up by the prequel movies and, I imagine, restricted by the deals that have already been made, did you feel your vision was roped in? Did you feel limited?\n\nWell, limited and freed. A certain amount of questions get answered by the structure of a superhero movie: Weâre doing this and this and this with this guy. And some of it, well, it just eliminates work. Because you know, \"Well, we have to get from A to B, and this guy has to come along and this guy has to do this thing and he canât do that because he needs to be there.\" So thereâs a certain amount of feeling hemmed in. And then there were a few things I wanted to do that I couldnât and thatâs frustrating, but it definitely helps as much as it hurts.\n\nWell you canât kill off characters with six-movie deals.\n\nYeah, no. Killing off a franchise character, itâs not done! It is simply not done!\n\nHas Disneyâs involvement led to a new set of criteria? When they came in, did it make a difference on the creative side?\n\nWell, they have strong policies about \"nobody smokes,\" but nobody was anyway â¦ They come in with notes obviously, which is a certain amount of pressure, but theyâre pretty hands-off and quite supportive.\n\nYou made the choice to introduce two new characters in the new film with the twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. Were there other characters you thought of including in The Avengers: Age of Ultron? I think you said previously that the reason you didnât include Ant-Man in The Avengers was because it would have been a âtoo many cooksâ scenario.\n\nAnt-Man was already in development long before I got to Marvel â¦ But for me the twins represented âthe oldâ in the sense that theyâd always been Avengers when I was reading the books as a kid, and âthe newâ in terms of they would, by necessity, be younger and have a different perspective on thingsâa different style, a different visual style, their powers would manifest differently. It would be something to just really freshen up the experience because there comes a point where itâs all about punching. And you want to do something a little more left of center.\n\nAre there any current TV shows or movies that youâre watching and enjoying or are inspired by?\n\nItâs so cute that you think I could do that. [laughs]\n\nWell you said you were unemployed!\n\nIâve been unemployed for almost a week.\n\nThatâs enough time to binge-watch UnbreakableKimmy Schmidt.\n\nIâve just been grabbing my kids' faces, touching them, and being like, âI remember you! I can see you in my hands!â And theyâre like, âDad youâre not blind.â And Iâm like, âNooooo, this is better.â\n\nSo Iâve missed a lot. I havenât seen much of late. Iâm several years behind. Most major popular TV shows I either havenât seen or didnât really want to, and at some point I feel like Iâll have to catch up again. But, except for a brief intersection where I seem to be creating some of it, Iâve actually never been much of a pop culture maven.\n\nThatâs so funny, because you are like the king of pop culture and yet you sort of exist outside of it and beyond it.\n\nAs a kid, I was there listening to the show tunes and the movie scores and reading comic books at bedtime. I wasnât really paying attention to what was on or being listened to â¦ Itâs not like I didnât see Star Wars or anything, but Iâm going to slide very easily into crotchety old manhood. Iâm going to wear that really well. Yet another long answer that is: nope!\n\nPeople donât really stay dead in Marvel movies. I think weâve had to deal with Loki dying four, five, 12 times. Coulson coming back.Â Fury comes back mid-film in Captain America: The Winter Soldier ... How many more times do you think a characterâs death can have an impact if it doesnât have a permanent effect?\n\nA lot of people come back in The Winter Soldier. Itâs a grand Marvel tradition. Bucky was supposed to die. And the Coulson thing was, I think, a little anomalous just because that really came from the television division, which is sort of considered to be its own subsection of the Marvel universe. As far as the fiction of the movies, Coulson is dead.\n\nBut I have to say, watching the first one with my kidsâI had not watched the first one since it came outâand then watching it with my kids and watching Coulson die but [thinking], âYeah, but I know that he kind of isnât,â it did take some of the punch out of it for me. Of course, I spent a lot of time making sure he didnât. And at the time it seemed inoffensive, as long as it wasnât referenced in the second movie, which it isnât.\n\nThereâs a thing where you can do that so many times and thereâs nothing at stake. But itâs difficult because youâre living in franchise worldânot just Marvel, but in most big filmsâwhere you canât kill anyone, or anybody significant. And now I find myself with a huge crew of people and, although Iâm not as bloodthirsty as some people like to pretend, I think itâs disingenuous to say weâre going to fight this great battle, but thereâs not going to be any loss. So my feeling in these situations with Marvel is that if somebody has to be placed on the altar and sacrificed, Iâll let you guys decide if they stay there.\n\nLokiâs redemption in Thor: The Dark World was pretty amazing, and then a little bit less amazingâ¦\n\nWell, yes! I mean, I canât speak for [them]. Although I did work on that movie, it wasnât my film, but I think there was no way on Godâs green and verdant earth they were going to kill Loki.\n\nSo, I donât know if this is kosher to ask, but of the other Marvel movies, do you have a favorite?\n\nOf the Marvel movies besides mine? I think itâs probably still the first Iron Man. Thatâs where it all started and itâs never more exciting than when it starts. But they all have a place in my heart. Except Iron Man 2; it doesnât have a place in my heart."
