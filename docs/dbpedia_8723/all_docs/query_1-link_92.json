The series was inspired by the 1950 film Wagon Master, directed by John Ford and starring Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., and Ward Bond, and harkens back to the early widescreen wagon train epic The Big Trail starring John Wayne and featuring Bond in his first major screen appearance playing a supporting role. Horton’s buckskin outfit as the scout in the first season of the television series resembles Wayne’s, who also played the wagon train’s scout in the earlier film.”\n\nNOTE: The streaming services listed above are subject to change.
