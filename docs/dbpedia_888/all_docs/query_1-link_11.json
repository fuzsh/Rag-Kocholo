        "text": "May the 23rd, 2024 – Jadranski Naftovod has begun with its very first solar power plant project, with plans to put it into function by March next year.\n\nAs Poslovni Dnevnik writes, through its affiliated company JANAF OIE, Jadranski Naftovod has now officially taken over 100 percent of the shares in the company Solar Energy Vođinci. That of course includes the investment in a solar power plant in Vođinci, near Vinkovci. That plant has a designed power installation of 14.2857 megawatts and connected power of 9.99 megawatts.\n\nThis project is in the phase of the beginning of construction, building permits have been obtained, and the expected date of putting the solar power plant into operation is March the 1st, 2025, Jadranski Naftovod announced on Wednesday.\n\n“Taking over the solar power plant project is the first tangible result of our new strategic direction. Without neglecting the security of the supply of energy to Central Europe and neighbouring countries, we’re going to continue with the development of the business segment of renewable energy sources. We want JANAF to become a respectable player on the Croatian electricity market”, said Stjepan Adanić, President of the JANAF Management Board.\n\n“The strong financial position Jadranski Naftovod currently enjoys is thanks to extremely successful operations. Those operations have opened the opportunity for us as a company to invest in renewable energy sources. While I’m extremely pleased with the fact that the first acquisition of a project in the field of renewable energy sources has now been realised, I’d like to emphasise that this is only the first such investment. We’re currently considering a number of other greenfield and mature projects of this type,” said the company’s Management Board member Vladislav Veselica.\n\nSince the adoption of the Transition and Development Strategy of JANAF for the period from 2022 to 2030 with a vision to 2050, the company has been carrying out activities aimed at diversifying its operations and transforming the company into a green energy company.\n\nSo far, JANAF has implemented projects of integrated solar power plants at the Sisak, Žitnjak and Omišalj terminals, and non-integrated solar power plants are being prepared in Slavonski Brod, Omišalj and Žitnjak in Zagreb.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
