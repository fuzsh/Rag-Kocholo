        "text": "Hungarian MOL, a long-term lessee of JANAF’s capacity for transporting crude oil, currently has the ability to receive 2.2 million tons of oil annually from JANAF. Despite this, JANAF is capable of transporting sufficient quantities of oil to meet the needs of refineries in Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nHungarian officials recently highlighted the urgent need to secure alternative supply routes for Russian oil, following Ukraine’s ban on transporting Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline.\n\nFor 2024, MOL Group has leased 2.2 million tons of pipeline capacity from JANAF, covering about 18% of its oil import needs. By using DRA polymers, which enhance the efficiency and flow of oil through pipelines, MOL can potentially increase the capacity to the Hungarian border to 14.3 million tons per year, fully satisfying its refinery requirements.\n\nJANAF has adhered to EU sanctions banning the import and transport of Russian oil, which were imposed in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and have since been expanded. However, it remains unclear whether JANAF can track the traceability and origin of the oil arriving at their terminal for Hungary and Slovakia."
