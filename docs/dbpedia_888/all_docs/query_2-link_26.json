        "text": "As a side note, \"JANAF\" stands for Joint Army–Navy–Air Force; these tables were designed to provide quick access to the thermodynamic data for rocket scientists.\n\nHere, $Δ_\\mathrm{f}H^\\circ$ is the standard enthalpy of formation. The difference $H-H^\\circ(T_\\mathrm{r})$ is required to calculate the standard enthalphy of reaction $Δ_\\mathrm{r}H^\\circ$ if in the given temperature range a reaction takes place.\n\nThere is a thorough explanation in Silbey's Physical Chemistry [1, p. 62]:\n\nThe JANAF tables give standard enthalpies of formation at a series of temperatures, and so these values may be used directly to calculate enthalpies of reaction. [...] Some thermodynamic tables give values of $\\bar{H}^\\circ_T - \\bar{H}^\\circ_{298}$ to assist in the calculation of $Δ_\\mathrm{r}H^\\circ$ for a chemical reaction or phase transition:\n\n$$\\bar{H}^\\circ_T - \\bar{H}^\\circ_{298} = \\int_\\pu{298 K}^T \\bar{C}^\\circ_P \\mathrm{d}T$$\n\nDepending on the table, $Δ_\\mathrm{r}H^\\circ$ for phase transitions in the intervening temperature range may be added to the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nNIST-JANAF tables are given for a reference temperature $T_\\mathrm{r}$ and a standard state pressure $p^\\circ$. Unless stated otherwise, $T_\\mathrm{r} = \\pu{298.15 K}$ and $p^\\circ = \\pu{0.1 MPa}$ [2].\n\nReferences"
