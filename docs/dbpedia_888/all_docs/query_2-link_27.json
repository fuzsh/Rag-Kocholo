        "text": "reggie3 on\n\nAs an update, the theater section of the JANAF shopping center was torn down to make way for an expansion to the Walmart next door. Not a bad trade since an modern multiplex operated by Cinemark opened across the street at Military Circle mall. Prior to that AMC shut down the small (4 screens, I think) indoor and 4 screen outdoor cinemas at the mall (which is now known as The Gallery at Military Circle)\n\nThe Janaf area is still expanding, with a recently expanded Walmart, BJ Wholesale shopping club. Montgomery Ward was converted into a shopping center upon that chain’s demise, a new shopping strip is being built next door.\n\nMilitary Circle renovated to include the new cinema, a new Sears, and a new food court as part of an ownership change a couple of years back.\n\nJoeLinville on\n\nI worked for GCC for almost 29 years, and 16 of them as the GM of the Janaf Cinemas, so I need to correct the chronology of this one time wonderful theatre.\n\nIt was, as listed, built in 1966 as a single theatre, seating just over 1000.\n\nThe original building was “twinned” in 1977, and 2 more theatres added, making it a four-plex.\n\nStarting in 1986, and finishing in 1987, using the “Cambridge Seven” design, the original building was split again, this time across the middle, yielding 4 screens. The 2 theatres added in 1977 were remodeled, and 2 larger screens added bringing the total to 8 screens.\n\nThe entire lobby, and front were also remodeled at this time, leaving only the large “CINEMAS” sign on top of the building as a memory of it’s original existance.\n\nIt should be noted that I went to the Janaf as GM, hoping to only be there a short while, but fell in love with the theatre, the Tidewater area, and the people, and many times, even today, wish I had never left.\n\nI returned to Norfolk (from Maryland), on the last night of operation, to say goodbye to many wonderful memories.\n\nTo all the many wonderful employees, and special friends I had in Tidewater, I thank you, and miss you.\n\nkencmcintyre on\n\nHere is an October 2000 article from the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot:\n\nOct. 14—NORFOLK, Va.—As General Cinema heads for bankruptcy court, suffering from the same kind of financial trouble as its industry peers, the curtain will close on Norfolk’s Janaf Cinemas.\n\nGC Cos. Inc., the corporate parent of General Cinema, said Wednesday that it will file to reorganize under Chapter 11, lining up behind United Artists Theatre Circuit, Edwards Theatres Circuit Inc. and Carmike Cinemas Inc., all of which have filed for bankruptcy in recent months.\n\nGeneral Cinema, like its industry peers, said oversaturation of the market created by a surge in the construction of megaplexes — theaters with stadium seating, state-of-the-art sound and more than 14 screens — has created intense competition.\n\nThe eight-screen, 34-year-old theater at Janaf Shopping Center will have its final showings Thursday evening, according to a source associated with General Cinema who declined to be identified. General Cinema has no other theaters in Hampton Roads. Janaf Cinemas is the third local theater to close in recent months\n\nCompany officials did not return phone calls seeking comment.\n\ndb4him on\n\nI worked at the JANAF Cinema in 1970-71 as usher, popcorn popper, maintenance guy…just about whatever needed doing. It was a blast, even though the pay was really poor. I did learn a great deal about the business, however, as we played many different types of films while I was there. From “flat” 35 film, like “Fantasia” to super cinemascope like “The Andromeda Strain.” I learned from the projectionists how the carbon arc-lamp projectors worked, how to changeout the lens for the different types of film (flat vs. anamorphic), and how to pop tons of popcorn. Other fun tasks included changing light bulbs in the theater (about 30 feet high) and cleaning up after Saturday matinees, which included everything served from the snack counter AND barf. I was sorry to see the cinema go to a multiplex, because I knew much of the charm of the single-feature theater was going with it. And, of course now, sorry to see it is all just a memory!"
