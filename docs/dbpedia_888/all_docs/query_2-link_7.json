        "text": "Croatian oil pipeline operator JANAF has signed a framework oil storage contract with crude oil trader ENI Trade & Biofules, part of Italy’s oil company ENI.\n\nThe deal involves storing crude oil at the JANAF oil terminal in Omisalj on the Northern Adriatic island of Krk until 15 July 2027, Janaf said in a press release. The value of the deal was not disclosed.\n\n“It is with great pleasure that we announce the signing of a new contract with our partner company ENI Trade & Biofuels,” JANAF pointed out in its press release. “With the renewed partnership with a company that is part of the ENI Group, we confirm the status of one of the key players in the European energy sector and a reliable partner that guarantees energy security and stability. Considering that JANAF generates its income from storage on the international Mediterranean spot market, where it faces strong competition from Cyprus, Italy, Spain, France and the countries of the African Mediterranean basin, we are particularly proud of this renewed business relationship. We are convinced that, thanks to continuous investments in our oil pipeline-storage system, we will continue to develop the company’s business and attract new partner companies.”\n\nMajority state-owned JANAF operates terminals for crude oil and oil products on Krk, as well as in Sisak, Virje, Slavonski Brod and Zitnjak."
