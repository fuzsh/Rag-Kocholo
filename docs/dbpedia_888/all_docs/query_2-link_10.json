        "text": "Croatian state-owned oil transportation company JANAF has signed a framework agreement with ENI Trade & Biofuels for oil storage at the Omisalj terminal through July 15, 2027.\n\nJANAF’s management highlighted that this renewed partnership with a member of the ENI Group underscores JANAF’s role as a key player in the European energy sector and a dependable partner ensuring energy security and stability. This agreement is particularly significant as JANAF competes in the international Mediterranean spot market, where it faces strong competition from companies in Cyprus, Italy, Spain, France, and the African Mediterranean basin.\n\nENI Trade & Biofuels, a subsidiary of the ENI Group, handles the international trade of crude oil, oil derivatives, and biofuels. The ENI Group is one of the largest integrated energy multinationals in the oil sector, the largest oil company in Italy, and the second-largest headquartered in the European Union."
