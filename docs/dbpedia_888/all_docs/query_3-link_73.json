Thus, additional contribution has been made as to enhancement of security of consumers supply since the compulsory stocks are intended to be used in cases of emergencies according to the EU procedures.\n\nCompany's further development is considered through storage projects, then by increasing crude oil transport and storage, as well as by developing compatible projects planned to be realized in cooperation with strategic partners. JANAF's strength and competitive advantage lie in available capacities and infrastructure, favourable geostrategic and energy position that enables crude oil and oil products supply from the countries of the Middle East, North Africa, Caspian region, Russia and others.\n\nKljučne riječi\n\nJANAF pipeline; crude oil transport; storage of crude oil and oil products; South-Eastern and Central Europe; EU project of common interest\n\nHrčak ID:\n\n132897\n\nURI\n\nhttps://hrcak.srce.hr/132897\n\nDatum izdavanja:\n\n10.6.2014.\n\nPodaci na drugim jezicima: hrvatski"
