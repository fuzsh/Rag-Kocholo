        "text": "Jadranski naftovod d.d. ( ) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 2nd of August to €30.95. Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 3.5%.\n\nJadranski naftovod d.d's Payment Has Solid Earnings Coverage\n\nThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Based on the last payment, Jadranski naftovod d.d was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.\n\nOver the next year, EPS could expand by 3.5% if recent trends continue. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 59% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The annual payment during the last 10 years was €2.64 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was €30.95. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 28% a year over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.\n\nDividend Growth May Be Hard To Achieve\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 3.5% per year. Growth of 3.5% per annum is not particularly high, which might explain why the company is paying out a higher proportion of earnings. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future.\n\nOur Thoughts On Jadranski naftovod d.d's Dividend\n\nOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. The payout ratio looks good, but unfortunately the company's dividend track record isn't stellar. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.\n\nMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our\n\nHave feedback on this article?
