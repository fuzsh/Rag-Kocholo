        "text": "22.05.2024. 13:29\n\nZagreb - Jadranski naftovod Plc concluded a purchase contract via its related company JANAF OIE Plc, pertaining to the purchase of 100% shares in the company Solar Energy Vođinci and investment in the solar power plant in Vođinci, near Vinkovci. The solar power plant, which will have 14,2857 MW designed installed power and 9,99 MW connected power, is currently at the start of the construction phase - building permits have been obtained and the solar power plant is expected to be put into operation on 1 March 2025.\n\n''We started implementing specific steps to achieve our goals immediately upon adopting the Development and Transition Strategy for the Period from 2022 to 2030 with a 2050 Perspective, which signalled the start of the green transformation of the Company's business activities. The solar power plant project takeover is the first tangible result of the Company's new strategic direction. It is our intention to continue ensuring a stable energy supply for central Europe and neighboring countries, while developing those aspects of our business activity which pertain to renewable energy sources'', said Stjepan Adanić MSc, Chairman of the Board.\n\n''JANAF's strong financial position, achieved through our exceptionally successful business activity, has allowed us to explore the possibility of investing in renewable energy sources. While I am extremely proud of the fact that we have completed our first project acquisition in the field of renewable energy sources, I would still like to emphasize that this is only the first in a series of similar investments because the Company is currently considering a number of other greenfield and mature projects within the course of different phases of our business activities. This project confirms the Company's intention and readiness to diversify our business activity and create new values to achieve further development and growth'', pointed out Vladislav Veselica, JANAF Member of the Board.\n\nSince adopting the Development and Transition Strategy for the Period from 2022 to 2030 with a 2050 Perspective, JANAF has implemented activities aimed at the diversification of business and the transformation into a green energy company. So far, JANAF has implemented integrated solar power plants at its terminals in Sisak, Žitnjak and Omišalj, while projects for non-integrated solar power plants at Slavonski Brod, Omišalj and Žitnjak are under way."
