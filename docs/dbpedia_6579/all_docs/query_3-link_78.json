        "text": "Who you gonna call? ,\n\nSteve Gonsalves had a hunch.\n\nWielding an electronic thermal scanner, the 26-year-old police officer was hot on the trail of the supernatural, one spooky night last fall in his native city of New Bedford.\n\nFor hours, Mr. Gonsalves and five other members of The Atlantic Paranormal Society walked the darkened hallways of the National Guard Armory, searching for signs of the afterlife.\n\nThe city native and real-life, professional ghostbuster deployed with the paranormal investigation team to debunk claims that the city Armory is haunted. The mission aired in November as Episode 107 of \"Ghost Hunters,\" a one-hour weekly TV series on the SCI-FI Channel. The program's second season begins filming later this month.\n\nAt the request of the National Guard, Mr. Gonsalves and his fellow Ghost Hunters, including TAPS co-founders Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, set up their command center in the empty Armory and began searching for reasonable explanations of the mysterious happenings there.\n\nThey had been on the job for three hours when, nearing midnight, they entered the gymnasium of the castle-like fortress on Sycamore Street.\n\nWith arms stretched high above his head, Mr. Gonsalves was operating a temperature gauge used to detect the building's hot and cold air exchanges when directly behind him, \"Ghost Hunters\" soundman Frank DeAngelis suddenly dropped his recording equipment and reeled backward onto the cement catwalk.\n\nMr. Gonsalves, a police officer who knows how to respond to injuries, quickly came to Mr. DeAngelis' aid.\n\n\"You OK, man?\" he asked.\n\nMr. DeAngelis didn't move. Clearly terrified by his inexplicable fall, he responded with an expletive, and then a breathless, barely audible, \"No.\"\n\nNot OK.\n\nAs he lay on the floor unable to move, he told the team, \"I got cold. It was somethin' right through — right through the floor, it seems — came up and just took me up and snapped my head back.\"\n\nEpisode 107 turned out to be the soundman's last. He quit after participating in what the TAPS co-founders claim is probably the most violent paranormal account ever caught on camera.\n\nThe spooky incident was just another day in the life of Stephen A. Gonsalves, who now lives in western Massachusetts, but has family here in the . His grandparents are Claire and Al Gonsalves of Acushnet and Hilda and Manny Costa of New Bedford.\n\nSteve's job is to explain the unexplainable and relieve folks of unwarranted fears. In the case of the Armory, however, he failed. TAPS was unable to disprove the National Guardsmen's claim that paranormal incidents, similar to the one Mr. DeAngelis experienced, occur frequently at the building.\n\n\"The Armory is amazingly haunted,\" says Mr. Gonsalves, who spent six hours overnight investigating the structure.\n\n\"You try not to pre-judge whether (the) paranormal exists in a place. But, at the Armory, you can feel the energy,\" he says in a telephone interview, adding that the crew traced areas of severe cold spots and filmed a strange mist using a thermal imaging camera.\n\nThe non-profit TAPS responds to requests for investigations, free of charge. Homeowners and managers of commercial or public buildings can call or email the organization if they fear their building is haunted.\n\nTAPS screens clients, asking about 40 questions ranging from a client's drug and alcohol use to the frequency of the hauntings. The crew then drives their mobile command unit, a large white Dodge van, to the home and sets up equipment, which includes infrared cameras and laser thermometers to find conclusive evidence of the origins of the eerie noises and haunted happenings.\n\nMr. Gonsalves has worked on \"Ghost Hunters\" since May, taking leave from his job as a police officer while filming the TV show. In his role as technical adviser and evidence analyst for \"Ghost Hunters,\" Mr. Gonsalves is one of four core cast members.\n\nHe first became interested in the paranormal eight years ago. He later started his own investigation team called New England Paranormal, a not-for-profit group whose mission is to investigate and document paranormal phenomena within the region. He has been affiliated with TAPS for the last four years, and says he prefers ghostbusting in groups to going it alone.\n\n\"I've been on about 80 professional cases where I've been called to investigate,\" he says. \"I think my credibility as a police officer gives the cases credibility.\"\n\nHe also credits the thoroughly professional approach of TAPS investigators. Like Mr. Gonsalves, the other investigators \"have such a passion for the paranormal.\" Most are blue-collar workers, regular men and women who work in ordinary jobs during the day. Co-founders Hawes and Wilson are plumbers from Rhode Island, \"not zany psychics people expect,\" he says.\n\nMr. Gonsalves says TAPS finds natural, non-occult solutions to about 80 percent of its investigations.\n\n\"TAPS is probably the only team in existence that tries to debunk the whole paranormal thing,\" he says.\n\nTAPS gained national exposure Oct. 31, 2002, when The New York Times ran a story on the Rhode Island-based organization. That article made its way to the desks of several television producers, who later contacted the ghostbusters about a possible television series. They struck a deal with the SCI-FI Channel, and began filming \"Ghost Hunters\" last May.\n\nThe series premiered in October, with 10 episodes in its first season. Investigations included strange happenings in a theater, an apartment building, a pub, an inn and several private residences. The Eastern State Penitentiary in Pennsylvania, which once housed Al Capone, was Mr. Gonsalves favorite location.\n\n\"There was so much history and we learned so much,\" he says. \"We did capture a full body apparition on that case, using infrared night vision recorders a black figure materializing in front of the camera.\"\n\nWhile debunking most of the claims it investigates, \"Ghost Hunters\" has earned its share of viewers. SCI-FI has ordered up a second season, which will begin filming in mid-January and will include 13 episodes.\n\n\"Ghost Hunters\" is a documentary-style show, officially billed as a \"docu-soap\" that follows the ghostbusters on investigations. Two weeks of investigating is turned into a one-hour show.\n\n\"To be honest, I think the SCI-FI Channel was trying to get away from the 'reality TV' terms,\" Mr. Gonsalves says.\n\nDon't be fooled by the bravado of his haunted-house and horror-movie tattoos, which cover both an arm and a leg. While the other cast members are truly intrepid, Mr. Gonsalves says, he's dogged by all sorts of fears.\n\n\"I'm afraid of insects and heights. I'm afraid of amusement park rides, roller coasters. I'm afraid of flying. I'm afraid of a lot of things,\" he says.\n\nBut, luckily, he's not afraid of ghosts, he says.\n\nThe SCI-FI Channel is airing back-to-back episodes of \"Ghost Hunters\" beginning at 7 p.m. Thursday, before it goes on a two-week hiatus. The show returns at 10 p.m. Jan. 26 with a rerun of Episode 103 featuring the Lighthouse Inn in New London, Conn., and Stone's Public House in Ashland, Mass.\n\nSteve Gonsalves will present a lecture, \"Ghostbusters! The Science Behind Paranormal Investigations,\" 6-9 p.m. Jan. 28 at the Boston Center for Adult Education on Commonwealth Avenue.
