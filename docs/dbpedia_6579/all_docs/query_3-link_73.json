        "text": "About The Ghost Hunter\n\nThe Ghost Hunter is a UK TV series aimed at younger viewers. It was created for the BBC, based on The Ghost Hunter books written by Ivan Jones.\n\nThis spooky show about ghost hunters first hit British TV screens in 2000 and the last episode aired in 2002.\n\nToday, there are still repeats on both BBC and CBBC, as well as in other countries across the world.\n\nWhat Is The Ghost Hunter About?\n\nThe Ghost Hunter follows Mrs Croker – the ghost hunter – and her assistant DeSniff as they try to track down the ghost of a Victorian-era shoe shine boy, William Povey. Mrs Croker hates all ghosts, but William is her ultimate nemesis.\n\nWilliam appears in the room of Roddy, who has sympathy for the young ghost and decides to help him. Roddy and his sister, Tessa, swear to protect William from the evil ghost hunters.\n\nAt first, you think Mrs Croker is only collecting ghosts because she hates paranormal activity, but it becomes clear that she is trying to capture them to use their spectral energy for her own sinister purposes. She is attempting to pass through time and discover everlasting life!\n\nWilliam has a high spectral energy, which makes him a very tempting target.\n\nBoth Roddy and Tessa have “second sight”, which means they can see ghosts. In the ongoing battles with Mrs Croker and De Sniff, the trio becomes great friends and has many adventures together.\n\nCharacters in the series\n\nWilliam Povey (Lee Godwin) – He is the main protagonist, a ghost from the Victorian era who used to be a shoe shine boy.\n\nRoddy Oliver (William Theakston) – He is William’s close friend who can see paranormal activity thanks to his ability called “second sight”. He can also talk to ghosts.\n\nTessa Oliver (Verity-Jane Dearsley) – She is Roddy’s sister and also William’s friend. She finds she has second sight as the series progresses.\n\nMrs Croker (Jean Marsh) – Beware, the Ghost Hunter! Mrs Croker is the antagonist in the series. She hates all ghosts and tries to capture them, using her ghost-hunting equipment to harness their energy and escape death.\n\nClarence DeSniff (Richard Hanson) – He is part of the ghost hunters team and the assistant to Mrs Croker.\n\nMr & Mrs Oliver (John McAndrew & Tracy Brabin) – The parents of Roddy and Tessa.\n\nLeo (Eddie Brown) – Roddy’s son from 2027 who inherits his second sight.\n\nBex (Kelly Salmon) – Roddy’s daughter from 2027 who inherits his second sight.\n\nProfessor Darcy (Andrew Havill) – He is part of the ghost hunters team in series three. He is a Victorian inventor.\n\nThe Ghost Hunter Seasons\n\nThe show had three series between 2000 and 2002:\n\nSeries one\n\nMost of the show takes place in the school and village where Roddy and Tessa live. The Ghost Hunter is most active here.\n\nThe children do not yet know who the Ghost Hunter is and need to figure it out to protect William.\n\nThey only discover that it’s Mrs Croker once she shows up at Roddy’s house, armed with her ghost-immobilising vapour, which she can use to freeze and shrink ghosts. Luckily, William manages to escape!\n\nWhen Mrs Croker catches wind of the Annual Ghost Meeting at Chillwood Castle, she sets off with DeSniff to capture as many ghosts as possible. But, her plan is foiled when her timing is off – she attempts to catch the ghosts while they are in the middle of a celebration where they inhabit their human bodies!\n\nAs Chillwood Castle falls, Mrs Croker falls with it, but DeSniff manages to escape.\n\nSeries Two\n\nSeries two makes it feel like you stepped right into a haunted house, with a more sinister story.\n\nMrs Croker was presumed dead after the fall of Chillwood Castle, but DeSniff discovers she survived. The evil Ghost Hunter can return to her sinister work in an old house, called Deadlock Hall.\n\nThings take a turn when her demonic energy kicks in, and she creates the “specktrika” machine that can pull ghosts towards it.\n\nThe ghost hunters team captures enough ghosts to power up their time-travelling machine, which they used to travel back to the Victorian era. William, beware! She is coming for you!\n\nSeries Three\n\nThe final instalment of the show sees the Ghost Hunter team join forces with Professor Darcy in the Victorian age. Together, they hatch a plan to harvest as much spectral energy as possible.\n\nThey return to the modern age, where 25 years have passed and Roddy and Tessa are all grown up in the year 2027.\n\nRoddy has two children, Leo and Bex, who have inherited his second sight abilities. They question him about his old adventures with William and Mrs Croker. William tries to visit Roddy, but Roddy has lost his second sight and can no longer see him. Fortunately, Roddy’s kids can, and so William makes new friends.\n\nThis series includes a lot of time travel from the modern day to the Victorian era, and the course of history is altered forever when Roddy saves a Victorian baby (Albert Povey) who is returned to his own era by Leo and Bex.\n\nWithout giving too much away (no spoilers!), there is a Ghost School that is altered by time travel into a hospital, Mrs Croker and Professor Darcy make a lot of money through their time travel but a disgruntled DeSniff donates it all… and Roddy gets to see William one last time.\n\nWhat Makes The Ghost Hunter A Great Show For Younger Viewers?\n\nDespite its spooky themes and ghoulish guest stars, this television show is aimed at younger viewers and was loved by many kids across the country. Kids on the hunt for a great show to watch at night will love The Ghost Hunter for these reasons:\n\nFriendly ghosts: Although there are a few scary moments, the ghosts themselves are friendly and quirky.\n\nLots of mystery: The show always keeps you guessing by combining adventure and the supernatural as the main trio helps ghosts solve their issues while escaping the clutches of Mrs Croker.\n\nPositive themes: The main themes of the show are friendship, acceptance and helping others.\n\nAge-appropriate: Although there are some very scary moments for young kids, these are few and far between. There are no graphic or horror scenes.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs The Ghost Hunter too scary for small children?\n\nWhen you watch it yourself and read other reviews, you will find that The Ghost Hunter is perfectly age-appropriate! But it is up to parents and guardians to review a few episodes themselves first before letting their kids watch it. It is considered a family-friendly show. As one reviewer on IMDB says, “The kids will love it… and so will the students.”\n\nWhere was The Ghost Hunter filmed?\n\nThere isn’t a lot of information on the series’ location. School scenes were filled at St. Laurence School in Wiltshire, and castle scenes were filed at Berkeley Castle in the Cotswolds.\n\nWhich other ghost hunting shows can I watch?\n\nThere are many thrilling ghost-hunting TV shows, Paranormal Lockdown, Most Haunted and Help! My House Is Haunted.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Ghost Hunter has stood the test of time, becoming a much-loved television series in the country and beyond.\n\nDespite the last series airing in 2002, repeats are still aired on CBBC and BBC today, allowing the whole family to enjoy this paranormal adventure!\n\nReferences"
