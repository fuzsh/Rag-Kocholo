        "text": "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT AMERICAN HAUNTINGS EVENTS\n\nHow many people are allowed to go on the events?\n\nSince every location is different, we don’t have a set number for all of the different ghost hunts and overnights. However, we do limit the number of people by the size of the location, number of staff, etc. so we have a very good idea about how many people each location can handle. We have been doing this since 1994, so we have a lot of experience with how it all works. Keep in mind that these are not the overcrowded “celebrity meet and greets” that imitation companies are usually offering. We try to put together an authentic event for our guests, giving them a real chance to experience and investigate the haunted locations that we offer. Many locations do have group activities that guests can take part in, but we always offer plenty of private time for you to investigate on your own.\n\nDo I have to make reservations online?\n\nYES… and we require it for a couple of reasons: First, our tours sell out in advance and since we are not always in the office, you may miss out on an event that you wanted to attend since all of the spots are filled on a first come / first served basis. Second, we have confirmation forms that need to be emailed to you, so registering online saves time for you and for us.\n\nDo you offer transportation to the events?\n\nSorry, but no, there is no way we can do this. People come for our events, ghost hunts, and overnights from literally all over the country. There is no way that we could possibly pick them and bring them to the events. And if we did offer transportation, we’d have to charge a lot more for the events and we prefer to keep them as affordable as possible.\n\nCan I get my money back if I decide not to go?\n\nWhen making a reservation, note that all reservations are non-refundable. Once you purchase your spots, it’s just like any other kind of event, concert, etc. They are your spots and if you decide not to use them, we are unable to re-sell them. Once you commit to buy, payments are made by us to the venues and locations that we cannot get back. You are welcome to sell or give the reservations to someone else but we do not buy them back. If you do transfer your reservations to another person, just please let us know so that we can update the guest list."
