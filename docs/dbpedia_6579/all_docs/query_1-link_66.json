        "text": "Two weeks ago, I did something for the first time since high school (roughly 2010). I sat down on my couch, turned on SyFy and watched Ghost Hunters. The highly rated reality show entered its 12th season this August, which is its last on SyFy. It seems that the show will live again through another medium, though nothing has been announced. The only thing absolutely certain is its tenure on SyFy is coming to a close.\n\nOnce a staple in my weekly television lineup, Ghost Hunters is a show I have loved, hated and forgotten about. Nonetheless, the show was instrumental on a younger me. The world of ghosts and the unknown is one I lived in during middle school and high school. Books, movies and documentaries on subjects from ghosts, UFOs and Bigfoot littered my room and filled up my mind of fantastic tales.\n\nGhost Hunters entered the picture around 2007–2008. I was in 7th grade and I would stay up the entire night watching episodes. Each week different locations were scoped for any evidence of life after death. I was captivated. Beside from the spooky aesthetic of the show, the evidence captured was sometimes jaw-dropping. Did they really capture evidence of ghosts? My fascination with the show did not end there. I tuned into podcasts, radio shows and other television shows that dealt with similar subject matter. I entered an amazing community who were just as curious about what they were seeing and hearing. To put it simply, I was in heaven.\n\nGhost Hunters follows The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS), founded by Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson. Based in Rhode Island, the organization was founded in 1990 after both men personally witnessed evidence of ghosts. Their experiences left them wanting answers of what they both experienced — therefore creating an organization where others can join the search.\n\nThe show first aired in 2004. It is considered the “grandfather” of the wave of paranormal shows to follow. In the beginning, cases involving families were deemed more important over potential haunted hotels and museums (a part of the show that became the opposite as the years went on).\n\nThe biggest takeaway Ghost Hunters taught me — and the others that tuned in — was having the mindset to think rationally. One can not simply go to a potentially haunted place and assume, from the stories gathered, the place is haunted. TAPS was as level headed as they come. The quickly debunked tons of potential “evidence”. Watching this team bring rationally thinking to something that is not typically studied by conventional science was as fascinating as the potential evidence that proved a haunting occurred.\n\nAnother important aspect of the show was the level of respect and friendship the team had for one another. Over the years, people have come and gone, but the level of professionalism, mixed in with the incredibly bond each has with one another, remains a vital part of the show. That bond trickled over to me. Being able to connect with different team members on social media, various radio shows and interviews was just as fun as watching the show. Discussions over various paranormal topics were fun to read and listen to, as well as discussions over music and pop culture. These people were not big Hollywood macho types; they were simple people with a passion for the unknown.\n\nSadly, on my end, the passion began to wane. Other shows took over my time and growing up distanced myself from constant interaction from the paranormal community. Sadly, on their end, the show become way more show-y than in the beginning. Efforts to go bigger and better rubbed off the wrong way. Though I know the heart was there, the show evolved to a television show with more of an attempt to thrill than investigate. This lends itself to a more sensational show, rather than a grounded one. I do not hold it against the people behind TAPS, but Ghost Hunters became a lot less interesting.\n\nMore importantly, favorite members of the team moved on and so did I.\n\nThis is not usually the show to receive a write-up, but it certainly deserves one. Ghost Hunters ushered in a way to connect with our past, while providing hours upon hours of entertainment. The first four seasons are like a time capsule of my younger self. Thank you SyFy for having a platform t bring these stories to us. More importantly, thank you to the amazing members of TAPS that have done amazing work in providing answers to what really goes bump in the night.\n\nNow, for some fun and to give you a taste of the show, are some of the my favorite moments from the show:\n\nA catchphrase is born! After seeing something fly by his face, TAPS member Brian Harnois runs, screaming “Dude, run!”.\n\nSome of the best evidence and clips all on one video!\n\nPerhaps the clearest EVP — basically, voices that are recorded that are not present in the room — ever captured.\n\nA collection of funny moments!\n\nWant more from CineNation?"
