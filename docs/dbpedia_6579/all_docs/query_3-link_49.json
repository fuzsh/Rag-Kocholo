        "text": "What the-\n\nBahahah!! That is incredible! You really managed to solve it!\n\nNo. Seriously! Colour me impressed!!\n\nI've purposely locked myself up here in this sad little shelter for as long as I can recall.\n\nSo uh, welcome to my humble abode. Sorry if everything's a mess. I'm not one to keep tidy.\n\nI've got personal reasons to isolate myself, so if you're wondering why, please don't ask...\n\nIt's... not really a good thing that I do this to myself. Um. Anyways.\n\nNow that you're here... I may as well ask you for help. That wit you've got is incredible!\n\nFirst thing's first... You may call me Ghost Hunter Archimedes. Archie for short.\n\nI noticed you're not much of a talker, but that's fine by me... Just at least hear me out.\n\nTo make this worth your while, I know I can find a reward that's enticing.\n\nI know I got a Hoverboard and a neat pet somewhere...\n\nSomething tells me that you're different from everyone else here, Ghost Hunter.\n\nLike, you're... untouchable. That, and you can see a lot more than the average soul...\n\nThis is why I'm trusting you with what I'm about to tell you...\n\nBefore I locked myself in here, I was in the midst of an investigation. This world is beyond abnormal.\n\nThere's something big going on. With your help, I'm hoping we can find more about this ordeal.\n\nI just need you to do me a favour. Go to Area 51 and vacuum some ghosts.\n\nGhost Hunter. I have what... may seem like a silly request before we continue our little talk.\n\nI hope you don't mind it.\n\n... The other night, I ended up playing my Gamebyte Colour for... possibly... several... hours straight.\n\nI was close to completing this Spooky Nonogram game—- and my Gamebyte died!\n\nSo. Uh. Could you go and find my flashlight for me? I can take the batteries out of that!\n\nIt's an older system... I cherish it.\n\nYou should be able to find it in the Junkyard.\n\nAnd while you're there, go and clear the area free of ghosts.\n\nI know it's not much, but I know I've got some Gems lying around for your reward...\n\nHere’s a reminder for you, Ghost Hunter. You’re going to earn yourself a Pet and a Hoverboard.\n\nOf course once you’re done helping me...\n\nBack to my train of thought... The more I look at you and the more I think about it, Ghost Hunter...\n\n... You have this... vision. Like you’ve been through these things before. Multiple times, even.\n\nIt makes more sense when you word it this way.\n\nI don’t know how that’s possible. To go through the same thing, over and over, and over...\n\nBut that’s possibly how you can see it. By rebirthing... It’s all coming together...\n\n... I’ve got a plan. I’ll have you investigate for me—- but that will be after this little task.\n\nGo to the Volcano and vacuum ghosts for me there. When you’re done, return for your reward.\n\nIt’s Boss Bait. You’ll be needing it for later. Trust me.\n\nI’m hoping what I said about you is correct, because in order to see her...\n\nYou’ll have this... rebirth vision. Because she appears in a few locations within this entirety.\n\nThe entity who I am talking about is this strange Ghost Girl.\n\nI’ll need my suspicions confirmed. She’s likely here, in this very world right now! And if she is really here...\n\n...! Hh-heh... I can tell you have a lot of questions, Ghost Hunter. I see it in your eyes.\n\nIn the Main Hub, there should be a clue to Ghost Girl’s sighting. Head out and investigate for me.\n\nIf you find her, return back to me to report your findings. Every detail is important!\n\nYour reward will be this Crate Key. It’d be wise to save up a few of these along the way.\n\n... I’ve got a heavy question for you, Ghost Hunter... Just something that’s been teetering on my mind.\n\nHave you ever woken up, only to be brought down by this awful weight of dread...\n\n... That everything around you feels wrong? That you don’t quite belong in this world somehow?\n\nI often wonder if the other NPCs feel that way. Waking up, only to feel haunted by existential dread.\n\n... Ahem. I need to keep myself distracted. You’re here, that’s all that matters. M-Moving on.\n\nNow that you’ve confirmed the sighting of this strange Ghost Girl to me...\n\n... I have a hunch that she’s from a completely different state of this game.\n\n... I’ll tell you more, but first, I need a breather.\n\nYou need a breather too, so go to the Beach and vacuum some ghosts.\n\nThe smell of the sea salt in their air will clear your senses. It’s a good way to destress.\n\nYour reward will be a nice handful of Gems. I’m never usually this outwardly generous, heh.\n\nI should remind you, if you had forgotten—-\n\nYour reward for helping me, once we’re done, is a nice Pet as well as a Hoverboard.\n\nBack to what I was saying earlier...\n\n... And as much as I detest thinking about it, a lot of us had different programming...\n\nMeaning that we had different lives and different thoughts than intended. Personalities even.\n\n... Some of us weren’t even suppose to exist. To think about that makes me feel sick enough...\n\nIt’s all because They had to interfere... Focusing on the wrong things to fix...\n\n... I still cherish what friendship I had with Blaze and his rival, Leo...\n\n... It’s been too long since I’ve last communicated with them...\n\n...I’ve got some notes to read over. So while I go do that, I’ve got a task for you to do, Ghost Hunter.\n\nGo to the Desert and collect some items there.\n\nI also heard that the rings in that biome smell like something delightful.\n\nSo jump through the red and green rings there too.Then return back to me for your reward.\n\nI’ve got some more Crate Keys in my desk for you, so these should be adequate.\n\nI took a moment to review my notes... I’ve also did a few stretch exercises too while you were gone.\n\nYou’ve been to that eldritch world before. It only makes sense if you’ve rebirthed.\n\nYou also likely already know who I am referring to when I mention Them.\n\nI’m talking about the Developers of this game. Ghost Simulator. They’re the ones who foresee everything...\n\nWhen we, the NPCs, started gaining consciousness and our own lives... they tried to fix’ us.\n\nThey weren’t supposed to interfere...\n\nWhat? You’re saying a truce was made?\n\n... I... find it hard to believe, especially after what happened... and what they did to us...\n\n... Hmff. Before I continue, I have a task for you to finish. I need to write this information down.\n\nGo and unbox a couple pets in the Main Hub. And return for your reward. I’ve got some more Gems.\n\nI’ve been thinking about her a lot lately. That mysterious, green Ghost Girl...\n\nIf she’s sentient... it makes me wonder what she thinks of all that is happening here.\n\nShe saw you. I remember you telling me. She phased away the moment you made eye contact...\n\nIs she stuck in another dimension...? We can only see her for a few seconds...\n\nIf she’s here in this area, then it makes me wonder if she appears everywhere else...\n\nThat’s why we’re going to have you confirm my suspicions. So here’s your next task.\n\nHead over to Area 51, and search the sector for her presence..\n\nThere, the Ghost Girl should make an appearance. When you see her, record your findings.\n\nThen report back to me for your reward. I can scrounge up something for you, I guess.\n\nJust a casual reminder here for you, friend.\n\n... You’re working your way towards a Pet and a Hoverboard.\n\n... For having locked myself up here for so long, it’s nice to have someone to talk to...\n\nNo, I can’t really just... leave. It’s not that easy, Ghost Hunter. Despite how hard it is to isolate myself...\n\nI know the Developers can’t sense my presence here. Even if there was a truce made between the parties...\n\nThey tried to reset everything... It sends chills down my spine. So forgive me if I’m cynical.\n\nBesides... even if the isolation is taking a toll on me, at least I do what I can to keep myself occupied.\n\nThat being said, I gotta check through my notes on my computer. I’ve been backing up everything I can.\n\nI’ll need some solitude to concentrate, so go to the Mine and vacuum some ghosts.\n\nI’ve got some more Gems here as your reward. Hope you don’t mind, I’ve got a lot I saved up.\n\nThat world I was talking about earlier... The eldritch world...\n\n... Ever since it was opened up, it only brought forth a great disturbance. And I know you’ve been there.\n\nThat’s... probably why we’re having so many bizarre happenings leaking into the other worlds...\n\n... The world that I am speaking of is The Backdoor.\n\nIt has a strikingly similar layout to the Main Hub... Give it some thought, if you will.\n\nIt even has a city exactly like Blox City... Except in twisted shambles, and warped terrain.\n\nThere has to be a correlation between Ghost Girl’s existence and the Backdoor having been opened...\n\n... I have a plan. We’re going to return to the investigation soon. Not yet, soon.\n\nI’ll need a moment to collect my thoughts. Ghost Hunter, here’s a task for you to occupy yourself with.\n\nRun off and defeat some of the bosses here in this Hub. Any of them will do, friend.\n\n... And when you’re done, report back to me for your reward.\n\nWe’re almost done here... You’ve been doing a stellar job helping me out.\n\nIt helps that you’re far more collected than I am... as well as being untouchable...\n\nYou don’t have programming like we do... So you have no concerns about being altered or... deleted...\n\nA-Ahem. Moving on...\n\n... I’m sure you noticed. I had something dawn upon me.\n\nThe Backdoor... that bizarre world. What if it was the original testing grounds for this game?\n\nThe Ghost Simulator prototype... A world that was never meant to be played...\n\nOne last step, Ghost Hunter. Before we do anything else, I’ll need you to finish a task for me.\n\nGo to the Underwater biome and vacuum some ghosts. Then return back to me for your reward.\n\nWith you helping me gather all these clues together, it’s metaphorically like solving a puzzle...\n\nAnd it all makes sense to me now. A prototype world that was never meant to be...\n\nWith the Developers interfering with the programming and lives of the NPCs...\n\nIt all unfortunately backfired. They didn’t focus on fixing the true problem...\n\nThey wanted a different story. But it never worked out that way for them...\n\n... Ghost Hunter.\n\nI’ll need you to go to the Volcano for me, and investigate the world for her presence.\n\nThat will be the final piece of information I’ll need...\n\n... I should reveal this to you as well... My associates are aware of your dedication...\n\n... Move on now. And report your findings to me when you find her.\n\n... She’s there, isn’t she? I can tell by the look in your eyes.\n\nWhat did she do this time when she noticed you?\n\n... She looked sad and wistful?\n\nI can imagine... being trapped in such a state is unfortunate. As... I can... relate....\n\nShe’s... a remnant of the Original Ghost Simulator game... She has to be.\n\n... I’ve also come to the conclusion that because The Backdoor had been opened up...\n\n...that’s why all of these strange occurrences have been spreading to the other worlds like wildfire.\n\nI’m not... liking where this is going at all. Even though nothing bad has happened yet...\n\nWell. The time has come, Ghost Hunter. You’ve done an amazing job helping me out...\n\nBut we’ll have to part ways. Though you’re welcome to visit me as you please... I enjoy your company.\n\nI haven’t forgotten. Here’s your final reward.\n\n... Take good care of the pet. He’s got quite an appetite, and he likes to chomp.\n\n.. ... And one last thing. You’ll be hearing from my associates soon... Farewell.\n\nHeh. It's... been a while, hasn't it, Ghost Hunter? I know that thoughtful face from anywhere.\n\nI know you seem surprised to see me outside of my comfort zone... Believe me. I'm aware.\n\nIt... took a lot of convincing and talking... arguing even, to get me out of that awful bunker.\n\n... It seemed like home to me... but then again... It wasn't exactly the best place for me.\n\nI gotta thank her, that Cherry girl. Morgie-- Ah. I mean, Morgan doesn't see her though.\n\nI'm not sure why... even though she's clearly here. Staring at me. Menacingly. ...Ahem.\n\nEver since you've focused your attention on other things, a lot has... changed, for the better.\n\nA hundred updates later... Heh. I've been keeping track of everything on my computer.\n\nBelieve it or not... everything works out well in the end... as hard as it is to see.\n\nYou know. Between us Associates and the rest of the NPCs here, we decided to have a party.\n\nI'm... not exactly thrilled about the party thing, but. Eh. I've got Morgan here.\n\n... And I've even reunited with some old friends of mine here. Well, at least Blaze.\n\nWe've... had a long talk with each other... and I've said my apologies for ghosting him...\n\nLeo couldn't make it, but that's fine. Blaze eagerly gave me his contact information.\n\nNow to psyche myself up to send a message... But, uh. That can wait for the time being.\n\n... I've got an idea. Now that you're here... Let's play a little game, for the sake of fun.\n\nHeh. I'm not surprised you're as ready as ever. I've always admired you and your tenacity...\n\nMaybe this will help me think over what I want to send to dear Leo... Mmm...\n\nOh. Right. I apologize. I've just... got a lot on my mind. They're good things, don't worry.\n\nI'm going to have you find all of the rings in The Backdoor, and jump through all of them.\n\nI've got my reasons, Ghost Hunter. They're all smells that are familiar to me.\n\nSmells are the one thing that trigger the strongest reaction to memories.\n\nWhen you finish my little task, I might have something here to reward you with.\n\nI just gotta think of something... Anyways, go and have fun. I'll see you soon.\n\nI'll be standing here... typing to Leo...\n\n...Correct, I knew what I was getting into. Once I stated my idea, I was aware of what-\n\n... Sorry, I was in the midst of transmitting a message. Been a while since we last caught up.\n\nI Was... not exactly ready for this kind of company, much less prepared.\n\n... I scoured everywhere, and did everything I could. But. I'll tell you more later.\n\nRemember me? It's Associate Archie.\n\n... Less focus on that, and more on you. ... You're here, and you're here for a reason...\n\n-I'll get you caught up. I can... contact them later. Hopefully this'll scrounge up enough time.\n\nBut, if not, I have a special item and hoverboard ready for your taking.\n\nYou've done plenty for me, back around when you solved the pet hunt puzzle.\n\n-What I am working on...? ...A mess. If you want a more... literal answer- A portal.\n\nThis... project of mine, it's our next move. It may be a bit much to explain, but I'll...\n\nHumm... Well. I offered to... step up and take the situation into my own hands.\n\nBroker for peace between the devs and the NPCs...\n\nIt would take a good workload off of Riley's hands...\n\n... First task. Let's see what happens when you vacuum these ghosts on this list.\n\nYou'll want to head over to the Enchanted Jungle. If my guess is accurate...\n\n... Riley deserves a rest. She's... way, way too hard on herself...\n\nThis of course meant that I had to...move out of the bunker, and venture away from its walls.\n\nWhile the Agents were busy with their own work... We had our own mission to conduct.\n\nWell... more of a 'search and relocate' type effort. I'm not... the best at meeting new faces.\n\n... But they too, were new. Just like... the first day I gained my own, and saw who was beside.\n\nFinding these new faces a home where they feel comfortable being themselves...\n\n... It's the first step to starting anew ... Now. Next task. We'll need to collect some items.\n\nHere is a list provided... should be enough to provide an adequate boost of power.\n\nOnce we're finished... You'll be able to move onto the next world. Only a matter of time.\n\n... I'm certain you've seen them too, by the way. The countless messages in the Backdoor.\n\n... Those remnants, a trace of what was left behind, as cryptic and foreboding as they are...\n\nIt was what led me here to this fractured landscape's existence. But getting there was a trick.\n\nRespectfully difficult. Once I revealed the coordinates, I tried multiple experiments to break in.\n\nOver, and over, and over. ... Until the temperature became so critical. At the time, I gave up.\n\n... That was until Ace approached me. ...The night is still young, we have work to finish...\n\nCollect some items and vacuum some ghosts. They will aid us in our mission.\n\n… The two of us have a mutual respect for eachother. I understand his intentions...\n\nAce... He… struggled with… complicated feelings for what he’s done to the others.\n\nHe saw his actions being callous. Talked my ear off, wanting to redeem himself...\n\n… but for Ace to offer himself as a guinea pig for this experiment?? I still–\n\n–S-Ssure, yeah… somebody– needed to test the portal… but I wasn’t confidant if the\n\ndimension would hold open for as long as it did, with how unstable it was—\n\n… I have… an idea to test, fighting the mini boss of this realm will be the perfect way to do it\n\nFind the Spades Harbinger and defeat it. I’ll keep watch on the monitor\n\nWhere was I? Right… I was able to conduct more research and make a second attempt.\n\nWith a stroke of luck, I managed to keep the portal stable enough to travel through it myself.\n\nThe moment I opened my eyes, I was immediately showered in confetti. It was… a bit much…\n\nThis was when I met them. They called themselves Remnants… Alice was the first.\n\nBright and cheerful, and… very, overwhelmingly affectionate.\n\nThe rest of their group were on high alert, and came in tow, wondering if I was an intruder…\n\n… Convincing them that I had no ill intentions was…not a walk in the park…\n\n… Aight. Timer set. Next task, you’ll need to go to the caverns for this, and quickly.\n\nGather me some bouquets and vacuum these ghosts listed here. … …\n\nI understand feelings of distrust, resent… It’s something I am too familiar with…\n\n… You’re wondering about said ‘bad news’ from earlier, hm… I figured as much.\n\nWord got around that there was a traitor. A rumor that I’m sure you’ve heard…\n\nRiley felt a strong kinship with those incomplete…\n\nGlitchy NPCs she’s found throughout the worlds, starting with the backdoor.\n\nI felt something uncanny about him at first… Billy. Yet, we trusted him enough.\n\nChalked it up to just… glitchiness, and incomplete code. … All of that was just an act.\n\n… I’m still feeling conflicted, especially since he made it clear to me to not interfere…\n\n… Go and collect some sugar corals, please. I’ve got some pacing to get out…\n\nThe moment that I met Spades... I knew there was a reason why I kept staring at him.\n\nI wasn’t certain at first… and with how cynical I normally felt…\n\nPoor Riley she trusted him blindly despite the many warnings...\n\nHe seemed somewhat proud of what he had done…\n\nI…I don’t think Riley ever truly forgave Spades for his betrayal….\n\nHe believes his cause is worth tearing a friendship apart… Even tearing apart much more…\n\nI understand his anger…being a part of a world in which he doesn’t belong…\n\nAll caused by people outside of his grasp… One feels helpless at times..\n\n…Let us not distract ourselves with troubles of the past. Collect some ribbons\n\nJust a reminder for you… the moment we’re done, we’ll have a new realm to explore.\n\nSomething big and dangerous awaits us after the portal is complete…\n\nThe Remnants made it clear they do not want us around…\n\nWe wanted peace but their intentions wagered war…The messages themselves, bone chilling\n\nThe spying, the Traitor…Something felt wrong..\n\nI’ll tell you more about that when you return…We all need a break once in a while, Hunter.\n\nMe? I have a lot on my plate.. The portal needs some more testing..to make sure it’s stable\n\nWhy don’t you go jump through some rings? The smells always helped me relax…\n\nThey threatened us to back down…To leave them be…We couldn’t..\n\nEspecially not now…with Ace still missing… Not that they believed he was even here..\n\nThe more we looked through the messages the sooner we realized who sent them..\n\nBack and forth like a swing…between Billy and Alice..and a few other voices..\n\nAlice being the strange ‘green girl’ sightings and the stranger in the void.\n\nI wondered if Billy would help settle things with our opposite factions…\n\nHe was too busy helping them and so, the threats turned into truths..\n\nAnd we need to prepare, Hunter. The truth can hurt those who cannot handle it..\n\nVacuum some ghosts, their ectoplasm could help power up the portal some more..\n\nRose has always been a talented gal… But we disregarded just how talented…\n\nShe sees the world through two sets of eyes..Her own and those beyond..\n\nHer visions are of this realm…Most are a sight for sore eyes–\n\nHowever, the last one was nothing short of worrying.. Even outright terrifying..\n\nThe person sharing her gaze is someone from RAM – Another mysterious damsel..\n\nThey chose to play on the offense… towards either us or the Devs.\n\nThey are planning a great battle… We need to keep pushing the defense…\n\nVacuum a few ghosts, the power core for the portal is almost complete.\n\nEnergy…done..Now…We need– OH! Sorry, Hunter. Didn’t see you there..\n\nJust checking a few things off the list… The structure of the portal is… lacking something..\n\nThe control panel I built is missing a little chip…An important piece in the puzzle.\n\nI should have one laying around..But where could I– Ah, I got it!\n\nCan you find my Gamebyte Deck? I can sacrifice its chip for this build.\n\nTry looking around in Scrap City… I was there when I last had it. …\n\nThere is only so much we can do by ourselves..against such a formidable foe.\n\nThe agents are busy… Making peace and helping newly sentient NPCs.. it’s no easy work.\n\nAnd with this new onslaught of the Remnants, our teams are on high alert already!\n\nIf things get out of hand we might even need to ask the Devs for assistance…\n\nFor now though, it’s just us. The portal being the main priority.\n\nSpeaking of which, we need a few more materials and perhaps …even ghosts…\n\nCollect a few more items and ghosts. This should do the trick… I hope..\n\nThe Harbinger has been getting a little too close for comfort..\n\nI enjoy personal space…Yet, I do not think it harbors ill intentions.. Maybe curiosity?\n\nMaybe it is just as lost as we are…wandering around a world it does not belong in…\n\nA-Apologies, Hunter…I am getting off track again.. Distracted…every time…\n\nWith the portal finally finished… The gateway almost opened…\n\nA taste for battle is desired..to get you into that fighting spirit..\n\nAnd I think our friend over there might be of great help…Defeat the Spades Harbinger again\n\nHunter…I hesitated to tell you what lies beyond the portal…\n\nI wasn’t sure if we would even be ready in time…And yet, a warning is still in place..\n\nRAM sent a Megaboss to attack us…They said we wouldn’t listen to them..\n\nThat it was their only choice…Nevertheless, their scheme backfired…\n\nThe Megaboss isn’t attacking only us Associates… but everyone…\n\nWhomever sets foot in the Phantom Castle is in for a hideous surprise..\n\nTo you however, it won’t be…You know what lies ahead.. And I am confident you can handle it.\n\nVacuum a few more ghosts just to make sure the portal’s core is stable before you pass…\n\nI know, I know!…Again? Just…Please, I don’t want what happened with Ace to repeat..\n\nI was nervous for you, Hunter. But everything came out alright in the end..\n\nWe have quite a way to go until RAM and the AOF can fully trust one another\n\nFor now though, the threat has been abolished and everyone is safe.. That is all that matters.\n\nAs much as I enjoy your company, this is where we go our separate ways..\n\nTake this reward as a sign of gratitude for your service..\n\nYou will hear from us again soon as Ace is still nowhere to be seen… but for now, farewell!"
