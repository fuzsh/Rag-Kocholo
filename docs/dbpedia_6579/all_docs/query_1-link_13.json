        "text": "I’ve worked for LA Ghost Tour as a guide for almost a year now and I’ve truly enjoyed it. I’m able to set my own schedule, management is quick to respond and eager to help with any complications that may arise, and I’m able to work independently. I also love entertaining guests while showing them the darker side of Hollywood. There’s nothing more fun than watching a guest gasp or shake their head in disbelief as you weave tales of murder and mischievous spirits.\n\n- Danielle W.\n\nI really enjoy working for NY Ghosts as I love meeting new people and explaining to them exactly why the uber expensive, super gentrified & classically beautiful Greenwich Village is truly as haunted as it is. From Mark Twain's spooky house, to one of the most haunted & romantic spots in town, One if By Land...Two if by Sea... The Village is a classic neighborhood that's full of surprises. Not only do I love the neighborhood but the perks of working for NY Ghosts are well worth it too. They throw in incentives like extra gratuities & bonuses in addition to the tips & good wages I already receive!\n\n- Marci F.\n\nHaving ghostly gifts myself, working as a guide for NYC Ghosts has been a great fit for me. Every tour I lead, as we stroll through the intimate streets of one of the city's oldest and most historical neighborhoods--whether you're a skeptic or believer, you can't but have a great and ghostly time leading excited and spooked guests to haunted locations! NY Ghosts is a company that is always flexible with my schedule, communicates consistently about everything, and always does its best to take care of its guides. I think leading a USGA ghost tour in any city is the way to go!\n\n- Damien D.\n\nI have worked with Vegas Ghosts as a Ghost Tour Guide since the end of September 2019. In this time, I have experienced an incredibly positive work environment dedicated to cultivating growth and creativity. I have been given flexibility in determining my own schedule and responsibilities that prompted the birth and development of new leadership and customer service skills. I have met people from many different places and heard as many stories as I've told. This company has given me the opportunity to have fun while cultivating enjoyment for other people. I would highly recommend this company as a whole - as both a place to work and a place of fun.\n\n- Kelly L.\n\nI have been working for Colonial Ghosts since 2018 and have enjoyed my experience as a Ghost Tour Guide. As a lover of history, I appreciate that this company strives for historical accuracy, and believes it’s important to include Williamsburg’s history on the tour so visitors have a thorough understanding of the town and the ghosts who haunt it. A lot of work has been put into the tours to ensure that guides provide an entertaining and accurate tour.\n\n- Jordan W."
