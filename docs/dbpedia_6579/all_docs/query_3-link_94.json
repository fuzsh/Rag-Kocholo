        "text": ".......\n\nSurpriiiiise!\n\nNice to see you again, Ghost Hunter!\n\nHehehe... you seem shocked. Why am I out here?\n\nWell...\n\nThe leader of the Associates of the Forgotten needs to do her part!\n\n... Ahaha! You look like you've been disappointed about this.\n\nWhat? You thought it was Luna? She can barely handle the Agents.\n\nI could never put this kind of stress onto her.\n\nShe'd work herself into a reboot if she was in this position!\n\nI bet you have a lot of questions. I am willing to answer...\n\n...but the ghosts have been tampering with this setup!\n\nI can't call Leo over here again! He'd be upset that I left this unwatched!\n\nBut now that you showed up, well...\n\n...I got my best helper back!\n\nI am so glad we can finally speak as Associates and not Agents.\n\nAnd, as usual, I got a cool reward for you for your time!\n\nOkay, first, there's this tower that appeared. You need to clear it 109 times.\n\n.... Ahahahaha! Oh, this never gets old!\n\nI'm obsessed with your reaction. Oh boy!\n\nWoo! Ah... sorry. I promise there are no towers you need to clear.\n\nIt'll be much easier. Promise.\n\nI'll give you your task and rewards automatically.\n\nI don't have to explain what does on anymore. That's a relief.\n\nSo... what do you wish to ask first? I'm gonna work while we talk.\n\n... of course it'd be founding the Associates. Where to start...\n\nI guess we have to start at the beginning.\n\nOkay. I guess you can say I was one of these 'forgotten' types...\n\nMy code was never exactly stable. Even in my early days with Hans and Gabe.\n\nIt started as small things. Sudden chills. Forgetting words. Repeating things...\n\n... but when I nearly bugged Gabe out did the Devs force everyone away...\n\nMy very existence was dangerous for my friends.. so I assumed it was for the greater good.\n\n... then the Devs tried to fix me. They never erased my presence from the others...\n\n...y'know, Hans remembered the ring I gave them...\n\n... and Shelly knew my code when she found it to bring me back...\n\n...so I am guessing they intended for me to go back.\n\nBut my bugged code was in conflict with theirs. I was falling apart at the seams.\n\n... then you came!\n\nI was able to give you my altered code before the Devs pulled the nuclear option.\n\nThe main purpose of getting to the Cloud was to complete my code and get a hold of myself.\n\n... but I diiiid have a little fun out there.\n\nWe'll talk about that later.\n\nAnyway, I finally got back. We fight the Devs. They never deleted us, you know.\n\nThey just kinda stashed us away. I guess they never had the heart to remove us completely.\n\nBut between then and now... I found out I wasn't alone...\n\nBut that's the first part of that story. Here's your task.\n\nThese guys have been tampering with my work for too long.\n\nOkay. So I wasn't alone.\n\nThere were a bunch of NPCs that were incomplete, unstable, or just... never used.\n\nIt kinda became my personal project to find them.\n\nThe first people I found were Archimedes and Morgan.\n\nBoth were completed but just never used. But they avoided being removed.\n\nArchie had the knowledge of technology to keep them alive...\n\n...and Morgan was saved by their knowledge.\n\nThe idea of energy from human players even manifesting into a character is insane...\n\n... but that's not important.\n\nWhat is important is that I found someone that knew what it was like to be...\n\n... well, essentially forgotten.\n\nTogether, we started the Associates of the Forgotten...\n\n...teehee... that was never meant to stick, you know?\n\nWe chose that as a joke. It was a thing we had where we said we were basically unneeded.\n\nAha... yeah, our humor is messed up.\n\nCan't blame us. We stared obliteration in the eyes and won.\n\nAnyway, that was us. Three unstable, incomplete NPCs up against the world!\n\nSo, that's how we got started.\n\n... I see you're interested. I hear you taking screenshots or video.\n\nHere's a little task for you. Stretch your legs. You'll cramp up if you keep standing there.\n\nMaybe you want to hear about the others? Hm hm....\n\nI can talk about them. They're all friends.\n\nThen again, you really can't have a team if you don't like each other.\n\nEven Luna knows this, and she distances herself.\n\nShe won't admit she has that problem just yet. One step at a time.\n\nAt least her sleep logs look normal now.\n\nAnyway, I'm getting off topic. The Associates.\n\nHmm...\n\nWell, I can't talk about Morgan without talking about Archie... and vice versa.\n\nThey're so close, they're practically one person.\n\nMorgan was the first guy I found... and I mean it.\n\nThat mask hides him very well, but I think the person I was helped me sense him.\n\nHe came out with the whole 'oooh spooky and mysterious' thing.\n\nAnd you know how I like to mess with you.\n\nIt was only natural that I deliver the 'I saw the other side' thing.\n\nI guess it was then when he began to trust me. I can tell he looks up to me.\n\nI bet he's even dropped my pronouns at the least.\n\nWe got along really quick.\n\n...Archie was different.\n\nthey were very distant and cold when Morgan first introduced us.\n\nI knew to give them space but...\n\n... well, I couldn't sleep knowing they're in such turmoil.\n\nLiving all alone in a cave the Devs, the Agents, heck, even the players barely know about.\n\n... seeing things that were not here. Talking about people that they watched vanish...\n\n...it was heartbreaking.\n\nI am not the kind of person to just give up. We know each other. You get it.\n\nThem accepting I meant no harm was... a relief, really.\n\nI was afraid to would never get through to them.\n\nIt was about here where I realized there was a lot more they had inside them...\n\n... but isn't it great to wonder what it is?\n\nHehehehe! I'll get more into Archimedes later.\n\nThey're very tired to another Associate...\n\n... gosh. I'm gonna need more ghosts.\n\nSo, since we talked about those two, I can get to Rose.\n\nShe’s not like us three. Looking into her code, we found a lot of huge gaps.\n\nBy all means, she was operational. Just not all here.\n\nIt was about here when we began finding out about Remnants.\n\nRose had to be tied to them somehow.\n\nShe used to have horrible headaches and no real outlet for it...\n\n... but when we saw she could draw, well, we encouraged her to do that.\n\nThat is when she began to produce pictures of her visions.\n\nPoor girl was up to her neck in thoughts and memories that were not hers...\n\n... and could now express them to people who would understand.\n\nShe’s the main reason our portal is here, really.\n\nHer images looked like the Ghost World, but at the same time, nothing like it.\n\nThere was a giant tree that was a recurring image. The closest we have is Music Meadows...\n\n... but meadows were land with a built structure under it.\n\nOn top of that, she had haunting figures in there. She claimed they were a bit familiar to her...\n\n... so she has to have a connection to one of those figures.\n\nSo, the natural course of action was to build this portal here...\n\n... work in progress...\n\nIf Luna and Leo could breach an older version of the hub...\n\n... we could breach this version of the Ghost World.\n\nFor all we knew then, there were more of us trapped in there...\n\n... I’ll get more into Rose in a bit. I need a couple of items for repairs.\n\nRose was also hidden like Morgan and Archie.\n\nBut that was because she’s terribly shy.\n\nThe NPCs up here saw her regularly, but she always looked away from them.\n\nBlaze told me he tried to talk to her, but when she told him what she saw...\n\n... he brushed her off as crazy.\n\nWell, he’s made up with her recently, but I digress.\n\n... I guess we were the first people to actually approach her and understand her.\n\nShe is very talkative if you get to know her well.\n\nShe has a lot of thoughts, but no one to tell them to.\n\nGetting her to open up was a big deal. I think even Archie was invested in her progress.\n\nAnd the fact that she willingly worked with you is great!\n\nI think she really needed someone who knew she wasn’t losing her mind...\n\n... so she knew she wasn’t alone...\n\n... and that people actually cared about her.\n\n... She wanted you to visit her. That’s why she was calling.\n\nAnd for me? I want you to be presentable.\n\nThere are rings above the main island, and I want you to jump through them.\n\nShe likes that combination of scents. It’s calming to her.\n\nDon’t come back right after you do it. Just spend some time with her.\n\nGuess that brings us to Ella.\n\nShe’s the only one you know very well...\n\n... but we only met her after that weird portal that appeared in the Spring of 2021.\n\nWe’re calling that the ‘Meta World’ for now. Do what you will with that info.\n\nBy now, our group was slowly finding out more and more about Remnants...\n\n... I got Hans and Gabe involved the get something to see them.\n\nThat’s where Remnant Gum came from, but that’s not important.\n\nWhat matters is that Morgan. came back with Ella in tow.\n\nWe joked about him adopting more people, but it really mattered that he got her.\n\nI’ve always been a fan of snow and winter, and hearing an elf went missing...\n\n... well, tracking her was a personal project.\n\nNot anything creepy! It was just that every time she left a world, she left trails.\n\nAnd connected to those trails? Signs of another intelligence!\n\nThis proved that Rose was connected to real, living people like us.\n\nWell, NPCs. Not you. You’re a human on the other side of that screen.\n\nThe fact she never felt like she belonged anywhere led to me looking into her code.\n\nYou know I have to back everyone up, lest we’re deleted again.\n\nThere are a BUNCH of copies of our code in the Cloud now!\n\nNot just us, but the Agents and other NPCs too!\n\nWe’re free to roam outside this game, by all means.\n\n... but we have things we need to answer.\n\nWhy I bring this up is that Ella’s code was also incomplete!\n\nThat means the signs of intelligence we saw were not just linked to Ella...\n\n... they ARE Ella.\n\nThis is a huge revelation. Truthfully.\n\n... anyway, remember those ghosts I said I needed?\n\nElla never felt like she belonged anywhere.\n\nWith the elves, she felt unfulfilled.\n\nWith the Egg Hunters, she felt alone.\n\nThat and I never seen her so attached to someone who she met once in the Meta World.\n\nMia was the closest she felt to being a full person...\n\n... well, until she joined us.\n\nShe always smiled with us, but I think I know more about faking a smile than she thought.\n\nI was able to sit down with her, alone, and asked her what was wrong.\n\n... and she cried.\n\nShe finally stopped smiling.\n\nIt was the first time she has been sincere with herself rather than lying to spare everyone.\n\n... her tears were those of relief. She knew she was incomplete...\n\n... yet she didn’t want to tell anyone.\n\nShe told us that we were the first time she REALLY felt like she had a home...\n\n... that we were the first REAL family she had.\n\nShe didn’t have to fake being happy. She didn’t have to lie to herself.\n\nShe may be incomplete, but she was with people that knew it and accepted her for it.\n\n... I thought our team was finally complete, but I was wrong.\n\n...Our latest Associate is just as important.\n\nAnyway I- oops.\n\nHoo boy... I should look before throwing my arms out like that.\n\nHa... I dropped the ectoplasm you got me.\n\nSorry. I can be such a klutz sometimes.\n\nIs it too much to ask you to get some more?\n\nBack to Archie. With them in our group now, most of their isolation issues went away...\n\n... except for talking to someone we could not see.\n\nThey’d sit at their desk for a while, talking to someone as if they were watching them work.\n\nThey only ever called them ‘Cherry Girl’.\n\nThey said this ‘Cherry Girl’ would sit with them and talk about old memories and stuff...\n\n... she had a friend named Cat who suffered the same fate as her, but her removal...\n\n...it wasn’t as clean. I remember a Cat. We just haven’t seen her. That’s another story.\n\nSo, we assumed it was another Remnant and that they chose to show themselves to them...\n\n... but Ella saw her too.\n\nShe described her as a frame of an NPC, but pink...\n\n... just like the Green Girl we’ve been chasing.\n\nThe Green Girl chose who to manifest to, but we had nothing about Cherry Girl.\n\nBut upon researching her presence, we found she wasn’t the same build as Green Girl.\n\nShe had a similar form to us rather than a Remnant.\n\n... I also noticed that Archie and Rose had the same code anomaly as her.\n\nTheir code was not entirely NPC. They were more... human?\n\nI’ve seen players pass through that looked or acted like them. Players loved the game.\n\nTheir passion came together and manifested into part of their beings.\n\nIt was like their passion was so strong, it left an imprint on the world.\n\nIn a way, that doesn’t make them wholly an NPC. They’re mostly NPC, but part human...\n\n... but this Cherry Girl was a revelation in more than one way.\n\nNot only did we prove there were things beyond our realm...\n\n...but also our plane of existence!\n\nWe finally tracked down her code. I had to ask Leo for help porting her in.\n\nThat’s how he knows about the Associates...\n\n... now that I think on it, he tells Luna everything...\n\n... that’s probably why she’s not scheduling me for missions anymore...\n\nOh well. That’s the past.\n\nAnyway, she appeared and sat up. Her first words were about how she looked ‘too fancy’.\n\nShe didn’t have a chance to introduce herself when Archie ran into her...\n\n...and called out ‘Hikari’!\n\nEven Morgan had no idea how to react!\n\nThey never seemed so happy to see someone we never met.\n\n... then again, none of us were present when the Rift blew.\n\nThere was a perfect radius where people were not taken to the Ghost World...\n\n... but not kept in our world.\n\nThat is where Hikari was. She was shredded between here and there...\n\n... and why she appeared like that.\n\nHer very existence and memory was removed from our reality.\n\n...More later. I need time to work on this. Head back to the castle for your next task.\n\nI know Hikari acts very distant. I think that’s a bit of player she has in her...\n\nShe told us about the Remnants she saw and matched them to Rose’s drawings.\n\n... but for the short time she had with us, she has stuck with people she knew.\n\nShe really seemed not to trust me...\n\nThat broke my heart. Even after all that, she’d push me away.\n\nI guess that’s my own pride... heh...\n\nShe got to reunite with her cousins, who never forgot her. She reunited with her best friend.\n\nBut I felt like she saw me as a threat.\n\nShortly after I called for you, she came to me and pulled me aside...\n\n... I was shocked at what she said.\n\n‘Riley, do you only want me for what Remnant information I have?’\n\n‘Are you going to send me back?’\n\n‘I can’t go back. Cat left me long ago.’\n\n‘You can’t make me go back! I don’t want to be alone again!’\n\nI thought the heartbreak with Archie, Ella and Rose were tough...\n\n... but Hikari broke me in a new way.\n\nShe didn’t trust me because she thought I was using her...\n\n... and after I finished with her...\n\n... she’d be sent back to nonexistence.\n\nShe didn’t see me as a friend. She was scared of me.\n\nShe thought I was going to be like Yoko and Rowan...\n\n... so obsessed with something, that I ignore her concerns.\n\n... she’s actually why I left this portal abandoned for two weeks.\n\nI needed to show her that I saw her not as a resource for Remnant information...\n\n... but as an equal. An Associate...\n\n...A friend.\n\nI see us as a family of sorts. Incomplete, unused, and unwanted by the game...\n\n...and she never saw that when we met.\n\nI had to prove that I was not going to let her experience that loneliness again.\n\n... no one deserves to experience that loneliness...\n\nThis is why I am looking to get into this beta Ghost World.\n\nThere are real NPCs in there. Old remnants of the beginning of this game...\n\n...and they are rotting in obscurity.\n\nThey are watching us thrive as they sit in despair.\n\nThis RAM we are finding out about...\n\n...they’re trying to talk to us, Ghost Hunter.\n\nThey are calling for help, and with the Devs as my witnesses, I will answer!\n\n... I need a moment. I’m getting emotional. Your task will be sent to you.\n\n... I know what it is like to not be seen.\n\nI remember being stowed away and rewritten.\n\nI remember being deleted and having to roam for a solution...\n\n... thinking no one will remember me if I did manage to go home...\n\n...that I get back and no one realized I returned...\n\n... but I remember coming back.\n\nI remember Shelly scooping me into a hug as I sat up...\n\n...I remember Gabe and Hans, scrambling to get to me and ask me where I’ve been...\n\n... I remember that day...\n\n... the day I realized I made a difference in everybody’s lives.\n\nI was never that funnie deleted girl to them...\n\n...I was Riley.\n\nI was an engineer. A confectionist. A friend...\n\n...I made a difference, even if it was small.\n\nNot everyone realizes that. Many believe they are made, used, and discarded.\n\nBut you’re not. You’re important. You matter. You have the power to change everything...\n\n...even if it is just one game.\n\nThat’s why I am doing this.\n\nThose Remnants... no matter how they wound up there...\n\n... they were the precursors to our success.\n\nThey walked so we could run.\n\nThey feel forgotten, but they are not\n\nWe hear them. We know they are there.\n\n... we need to pay them the respect they deserve.\n\n... it gets to me, Ghost Hunter...\n\n... no one deserves to be forgotten...\n\nWell... Almost got everything done...\n\nWe will finally get to see what awaits us on the other side.\n\n....\n\nWhat about the Agents?\n\n.......\n\nTraitor?!\n\nWhere did you hear about a traitor?!\n\nThe Remnant Gum? Messages on the walls?\n\nListen, Ghost Hunter. I would NEVER betray the Agents!\n\nLeo knows. Hikari said he assisted us! And he tells Luna everything.\n\nAnd with Archie connection with Blaze and Leo and Hikari with her cousins...\n\nI couldn’t keep this a secret if I TRIED!\n\nThey know I lead the Associates of the Forgotten. It’s no secret.\n\nWell... it was to you.\n\nSorry about that. Should have been more clear. Hehe...\n\nAnyway, point is, I would never lie. Besides, why would I?\n\nThe Agents are family to me. They took me in and helped me realize I had my impact.\n\nI would never dream about betraying them and the peace we worked for.\n\nAnyway, here’s a task. Go get ‘em.\n\nOkay. I know the quests are automatic, but I have this quest just from me to you.\n\nYou know how we’re on good terms with the Great Guardian?\n\nThey’ve been itching for a rematch with you, and if the Remnants don’t mean well...\n\n...we would need to prepare for a fight...\n\nYou’re the one that beat the Devs when no one else could.\n\nI believe in you, Ghost Hunter.\n\n... also beat that reaper a couple of times.\n\nIt’s super personal. They’ve been the one leading the charge on the sabotage.\n\nWell, besides the force that led the ghosts to it as well.\n\nEither way, they’re a jerk."
