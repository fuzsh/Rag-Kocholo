        "text": "I’ll admit it: Back when it first premiered on Syfy in 2004, I used to watch Ghost Hunters quite religiously. I will also admit that the reason for that is because I grew up in what I would consider an extremely haunted house, with parents who steadfastly refused to admit anything paranormal was happening.\n\nI get it. Most people feel embarrassed to admit such things exist. But it sucked to have to argue about it nonetheless.\n\nMy initial interest in Ghost Hunters, then, sprang from the idea that folks could gather tangible proof of the paranormal — be it video footage, photos, voice recordings, or light and sound interactions — and treat it like science instead of superstition. Where the series quickly lost me was in its inescapably bro-y tone. Much of the show’s crew had zero qualms about going into properties where people were experiencing spiritual disturbances and yelling obscenities until something — anything! — happened. (Why you trying to start a fight with dead guys, my dudes?) It did not help that the slew of copycat shows that followed in Ghost Hunters’ wake picked up that Angry Man Yelling cue and ran amok with it. (Exhibit A — *sigh* — Ghost Adventures.)\n\nWell, it’s taken almost 20 years, but some genius at Hulu just finally figured out that TV ghost hunting would be a lot more fun if a bunch of queer psychic people did it. And guess what? It is! The five castmates of new reality show Living for the Dead use all of that specialty equipment the bro ghost hunters use, in combination with their own unique third-eye-related talents.\n\nThe intrepid team travels across the country in their trusty little camper van, exploring public and private locations, doing all the things regular ghost-hunting shows do, just with a little bit — OK, a lot — more flavor. (And also drinking. These clairvoyants love a cocktail.) Not only does their range of personalities make for a better-rounded ghost show, it also makes for a much funnier one. These investigations are awash with quips. (“I felt a tug at my tail… which normally I’d be for,” “I hear gay people,” and “I did say I wanted to feel something from a man in Vegas…” are pure joy within a ghost-hunting context.)\n\nLiving for the Dead also benefits from a team that has a much more thoughtful approach to this work than the shows we’ve seen like it before. For example, when this crew gets messages from the other side asking them to leave a room, they simply acknowledge it, get up and leave. (Imagine that, Ghost Adventure dudes!)\n\nThe Living for the Dead team is mostly great, but not always perfect. Early on, many of them are far too willing to jump to “demon” and “non-human entity” as explanations for unpleasant activity at properties. Boggle, particularly in the first few episodes, seems a little too overwrought and dramatic for the work at hand. Thankfully, everyone calms down a bit and the team chemistry really comes together later in the series. The episode set in Las Vegas’ Palamino strip club is particular stellar.\n\nIf the reasoning for assembling a specifically queer group of paranormal experts for this series seems flimsy, that’s because it is. Kristen Stewart says she based the idea for Living for the Dead on nothing more than a goofy idea her friend and fellow producer CJ Romero came up with. It was the creators of Queer Eye (oh, but of course!) who ultimately helped K-Stew bring it to life.\n\nIf you’re a skeptic, it’s unlikely that Living for the Dead will make you a believer. The series is also not going to be to everyone’s taste. But consider this: One of the reasons Ghost Hunters was so popular in the first place was because it had a bunch of regular, suburban Joes doing the investigations. For those of us who’ve longed to see the supernatural explored by folks that we could better relate to (queers, weirdos, hot goths and trans women who make chlamydia jokes when things get too dark), Living for the Dead is a total winner.\n\nAnd if I were a ghost? Well, I know for sure which cast I’d rather have wandering into my bedroom in the middle of the night.\n\nSeason 1 of ‘Living for the Dead’ is streaming now on Hulu."
