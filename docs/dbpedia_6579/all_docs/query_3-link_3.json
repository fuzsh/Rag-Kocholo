It was later serialized as part of the syndicated weekday series Fred Flintstone and Friends during 1977–78. On cable, it was shown as part of USA Cartoon Express and on Boomerang starting in 2000.[2]\n\nLike many animated television programs created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track created by the studio.[3] Cartoon Network and Boomerang airings of the show have the track muted.\n\nThe Ghost Chasers appeared in the third season of Jellystone! However, they turned out to be members of the Really Rottens in disguises except for Goober.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nSimilar to Hanna-Barbera's earlier series Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, Goober and the Ghost Chasers centers on three teenagers—Ted, Gilly and Tina—solving mysteries with their companion Goober, a spindly, green-colored Saluki who can involuntarily become invisible. Writing for the Ghost Chasers Magazine, the group travel to various places and use equipment from their Apparition Kit to determine whether or not the ghost is real. Eventually, the group comes across the real ghost, which would help in defeating the fake ghosts; in some instances, the impostors are not actually criminals. Compared to Scooby-Doo, Goober can speak more clearly, but his dialogue is not understood by other characters; Goober's lines are mainly fourth wall-breaking retorts.[4]\n\nGuest appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Partridge children, characters from The Partridge Family, made semi-regular appearances in the series, featuring in eight episodes; their respective voice actors reprised their roles. Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Gray each appeared once.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nPaul Winchell as Goober\n\nJerry Dexter as Ted\n\nJo Ann Harris as Tina\n\nRonnie Schell as Gilly\n\nAdditional\n\n[edit]\n\nDanny Bonaduce as Danny Partridge\n\nSuzanne Crough as Tracy Partridge\n\nSusan Dey as Laurie Partridge\n\nBrian Forster as Chris Partridge\n\nWilt Chamberlain as himself\n\nMichael Gray as himself\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.TitleDirected byWritten byOriginal air date1\"Assignment: The Ahab Apparition\"William Hanna & Joseph BarberaTom Dagenais, Warren S.
