But why?\n\nWe talked to Great Lakes Ghost Hunters founder Brenda Ozog to find out.\n\n“I’ve had things thrown at me before,” Ozog said. “Anything can be haunted any time of the day.”\n\nOzog and her team uses high tech tools to try and detect those on the other side.\n\nOzog said Eloise, the old hospital in Westland, is one of her most active areas. She used to work in the building.\n\nRelated: Here are the Michigan towns with the most ghost sightings\n\nOzog said Michigan could be a hot spot because it’s surrounded by water.\n\n“Water is a very big conductor for the paranormal. That’s probably why Michigan is such a haunted place,” Ozog said.\n\nWatch Nick Monacelli’s full feature story in the video player above."
