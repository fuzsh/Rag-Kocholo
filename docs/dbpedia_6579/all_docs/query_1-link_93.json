The Atlantic Paranormal Society, founded in 1990 as an extension of Jason Hawes' and Grant Wilson's interest in the paranormal, has found a global interest. Renowned TAPS team members Hawes, Steve Gonsalves and Dave Tango, along with Shari DeBenedetti, reunite to revisit their most chilling cases and investigate disturbing new hauntings.",
