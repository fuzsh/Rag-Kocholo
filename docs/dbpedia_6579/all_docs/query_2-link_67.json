        "text": "Jen Brujitske might be a nurse practitioner by day, but she plays a full-on ghost hunter by night.\n\nThe Grosse Pointe Woods resident first became interested in ghost hunting years ago when she began watching reality shows like “Ghost Adventures,” “Ghost Hunters” and “The Dead Files.” The popular TV genre features brave souls who head to spine-tingling spots with sophisticated equipment to investigate paranormal activity.\n\nBut in March 2021, the spirit finally moved Brujitske to join the hunt for the haunt. She visited Eloise Asylum, a former state psychiatric ward located in the Kay Beard building in Westland, which claims to be “one of America’s most haunted locations.”\n\n“I went in with an open mind,” she said. “Immediately I saw a shadow figure and I was touched by something I couldn’t see.”\n\nThe encounter Brujitske had during her first visit to Eloise is one that separates the frightened from the fascinated. Count her as someone who did not back down.\n\n“I wanted to overcome my fears.” she said.\n\nBrujitske (pronounced BROO-jit-SKI), said she began feeling her intuition at an early age. Soon after her Polish paternal grandmother died, the smell of her grandma’s perogies would suddenly fill a room. Or Brujitske and her aunts would notice certain objects moved out of place in their homes, like bingo chips, from her grandma’s favorite game.\n\nWhen she was a freshman at Grosse Pointe North, her best friend at Grosse Pointe South tragically died from a heart arrhythmia.\n\n“I happened to be driving out to Pine Knob that night for Ski Hi. I passed White Chapel Cemetery and couldn’t take my eyes off of the sign and I couldn’t understand why,” she said. “I later found out my dear friend had died at exactly that time and (White Chapel) is where she is now buried.”\n\nGrosse Pointe’s ghost hunter also said she felt an immediate connection with the spirit world at Eloise, which is named after Eloise Dickerson Davock, the daughter of the former postmaster of Detroit. In operation from 1839 to early 1982, it began as a poorhouse and farm. Eventually, it became an asylum, sanatorium and hospital.\n\n“I felt a connection there, maybe because I am in the medical field,” said Brujitske, who works as a nurse practitioner at the Michigan Interventional Pain Center in Dearborn. “A lot of bad things happened to people while they were patients at Eloise.\n\n“These people want their stories told,” she explained.\n\nTwo important developments emerged for Brujitske after her initial visit: The first was learning from extended family members that her great-great-grandmother, Martha Urban, passed away at Eloise in 1948, from a stroke. She has yet to feel her ancestor’s presence there, she said.\n\n“I carry a copy of her death certificate. It can be anything that has a connection to them, or a locket, picture or anything that person has touched or left their energy on,” she said of “trigger objects,” which Brujitske uses to encourage her great-great-grandmother to connect with her.\n\nThe second development was that Brujitske linked up with Great Lakes Ghost Hunts USA, a group of about 15 enthusiasts, including her cousin, Julie Shar, who seek paranormal experiences locally and throughout the country.\n\nShe began going on expeditions with her team, heading to renowned ghost hot spots like the Madison Seminary in Madison, Ohio, and the governor’s mansion in Marshall.\n\nOn these adventures she learned the tools of the trade, including a “spirit box,” which reacts with lights and sounds when it detects a presence. She also tracks spiritual activity using copper dowsing rods, a laser grid, a Phasma Box computer app, an infrared camera and frequency box.\n\n“Everyone has a different frequency and (spirits) answer through the various ones,” she said. “Sometimes it’s a yes or no answer. At other times, it’s a full sentence.”\n\nOften, she said, you can hear the difference between male and female voices.\n\nFor example, Brujitske provided an eerie example of one of her own spiritual encounters on video, where she asks a spirit to turn on a flashlight in the dark room she and others were in at Eloise. The flashlight turns on, then goes off. When she asks the spirit if it would turn it on again, a distinct male voice responds, “da,” a Polish and Russian term for “yes,” as the flashlight goes on again.\n\nDuring another experience on a trip to the old governor’s mansion a few weeks ago, a guide walked the team past a mannequin wearing a wedding gown. They were warned that this particular spirit bride has the reputation to make humans she does not like physically ill when they encounter her.\n\n“Right away, a man on the tour had to leave the house to go get sick,” she said.\n\nBut Brujitske apparently earned the bride’s approval.\n\n“I went up to her and talked to her. I held my hand up and for a second it felt like she was holding my hand,” she said. “Eventually I didn’t feel that anymore and heard a voice from across the room say, ‘I’m over here, now.’”\n\nBrujitske’s ghost team performs “investigations” at well-known locations, like Eloise or the governor’s mansion, as well as at private homes. Investigation requests tend to pick up around Halloween, according to Brujitske.\n\n“Everyone wants their house to be haunted this time of year,” she quipped.\n\nDuring an investigation, team members research the home’s history and the land on which it’s built. They also implement various tools to scan homes for portals, which they believe offer spirits and ghosts the chance to travel back and forth.\n\n“A portal is where spirits can come and go, kind of like a train station,” she said.\n\n“They enter and leave from there and visit.\n\n“It can either be someone who has passed away in the home or someone who lived there for a long while and just doesn’t want to leave. … Sometimes spirits are stuck. If it’s a house they were in for 50 years, it is their pride and possession.”\n\nIt’s generally through this ghost highway where hunters like Brujitske try to ask spirits why they are there. The team often helps homeowners inform the visitors it’s time to leave.\n\nBrujitske said most of her experiences with spirits have been benign and the ghosts accommodate the request to once again depart, so to speak. The team also has a method for closing this apparition Amtrak, should they believe the entity is unfriendly.\n\n“If you were a (jerk) in life, you’re going to be a (jerk) in the after life,” she said.\n\nHer team carries a “hokey pokey” box to cleanse homes and themselves after an investigation, complete with sage and Palo Santo sticks.\n\n“We cleanse the homes to move everything out. We close the portal by telling the spirits to leave and put railroad ties around the perimeter of the home.”\n\nThe normal demands of life require Brujitske’s attention, too. As a hockey and soccer mom to two busy boys, Aiden and Blake, Brujitske and her husband, Rich, often find themselves at the rink or at a field. She said it’s usually too filled with activity and noise for her to notice anything unusual.\n\n“No hockey rinks are haunted. There’s too much going on there,” she said.\n\nFor anyone interested in connecting with the other side — or not — Brujitske has some advice.\n\n“If people are noticing signs, my advice is to not ignore them,” she said. “Be receptive to it and to what (the ghosts) are trying to say.\n\n“They are just interested in getting some attention. … If you aren’t interested in connecting, it will just shut down.”\n\nGrosse Pointe’s haunted high school?"
