        "text": "PORTSMOUTH—Late Saturday at 11:06 p.m. the house lights were turned off at the Seacoast Repertory Theatre, and a different kind of show was in the offing.\n\nThe marquee in front stated Ain't Misbehavin' was playing but it was a different kind of mis behavin' the late night guests were looking for.\n\nThe lights were going off to allow S. T. U. R. S. to do their thing.\n\nSeeking The Unknown Realm Society was on a hunt, a ghost hunt.\n\n\"We are a group that has been in existence for several years now,\" said Steve\n\nClark of Somersworth, one of the organization's founders.\n\n\"We go into houses, businesses wherever we are requested to assist people who have an issue with something they can't explain. It might be doors opening and closing, strange unknown sounds, anything that folks are uncomfortable with and need to get clarification for.\"\n\nCo-founder Ed Meattey of Dover expanded a little. \"Often times we get a call from someone who has a problem and needs help defining it. We provide that help, calming them down and reassuring them that they aren't crazy.\"\n\nClark chimed in \"we investigate things out of the normal run of life, that's why what we do is called investigating the paranormal.\"\n\nThe building housing the Seacoast Repertory Theatre has played host to a number of occurrences over the years.\n\nThe brick structure is over 160 years old, having been built in 1850. For many years it housed the Portsmouth Brewing Company and eventually in the twentieth century was turned in to a very popular local theater, first Theatre by the Sea and then evolving into the current entity Seacoast Repertory Theatre.\n\nS. T. U. R. S had heard stories of unusual occurrences in the building and offered to examine them.\n\nRepresentatives of the Theatre group agreed to let them spend the night using many techniques to scope out the potential for paranormal activity.\n\n\"This is a logical step in the existence of our organization, and is the largest structure we have worked with to date,\" said co-founder Clark as a group of eight began bringing into the depths of the Theatre a variety of devices used in the detection of the paranormal.\n\n\"Before examining a location, we do substantial research on it and any previous residents or happenings associated with it,\" explained Dan Meehan, the organization's chief researcher.\n\n\"For example, we have anecdotal evidence of unusual things happening here in the past,\" said Meehan, also a Rochester firefighter. \"Sightings by previous actors of people appearing to be sitting in seats, when in reality they were not occupied, light cords being unplugged while in use and thrown up overhead on pipes, talking heard when there is no one there.\n\nThe theater people even named the mischievous perpetrator \"Precocious.\"\n\nCraig Faulkner Seacoast Rep's Artistic Director recounts stories of \"a shadow man\" seen by several theater members.\n\n\"And,\" said Fauklner, \"I have a monitor in my office so that I can watch the stage. I can see orbs floating about all the time.\"\n\n\"I feel a man, wheezing,\" said empath Mary Sheppard as she walked through the catacomblike interior back stage examining the interior.\n\nSheppard is owner of A Higher Energy healing center an organization associated with S. T. U. R. S and often gives assistance.\n\nAfter setting working quietly and professionally setting up IR cameras, voice recorders, laser grids, temperature gauges \"to measure heat from somethings unseen,\" said Clark, the lights went out. \"Then it becomes like Christmas to me every time,\" said member Theresa Astbury. Said her husband Brian \"I find it's more like Forrest Gump's box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.\"\n\nA palpable sense of excitement emanated from the ghost hunters, as they settled in for the night. They could be heard asking quietly in the Stygian darkness \"Is anyone here? Would anyone like to talk to us?\"\n\nAt 4 a.m., the group wrapped up their night.\n\n\"We didn't make specific contact with anyone tonight,\" said Clark, but this is not unusual.\n\n\"There were several instances of cool breezes as though someone walked by, this is in a place with no place for air to come in.\"\n\nAnother curiosity, according to Clark, was late in the evening electromagnetic K-2 meters went off the charts after having been quiet all night.\n\n\"We also had some pictures taken of a mist over a researcher's shoulder that disappeared in a couple seconds. We have hours and hours of video and audio to examine and who knows what we'll find on those.\"\n\nAccording to Artistic Director Faulkner, he doesn't feel threatened by what might there. \"It doesn't freak me out,\" he said, \"it's kinda cool.\""
