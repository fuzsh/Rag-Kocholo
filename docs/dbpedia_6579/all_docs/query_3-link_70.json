        "text": "VALDOSTA, Ga. – Cross the Line Paranormal has got your ghostly visitations covered.\n\nCross the Line Paranormal is a paranormal research group based in Valdosta.\n\nOur group’s mission is to investigate claims of paranormal activity by using scientific methods to determine if there is factual evidence to back up the claims. We at CLP take our investigations very seriously and are not in this field just for a “thrill”. Our members are in CLP because we have all experienced the paranormal and we too are searching for answers using scientific tools not just feelings. We wish to help those that are troubled or just curious about the activity they are experiencing and are looking for either validation of the claims or other “non-paranormal” explanations.\n\nCross the Line Paranormal Facebook About page\n\nIn the spirit of Halloween, James Cummings of Cross the Line, agreed to share some of his most horrifying interactions with the other side.\n\n“We have been on several investigations through the years locally and in other states,” Cummings said. “The first was an old jail where I was scratched during our setup of our night vision cameras. It felt like a bee sting then I felt it burn across my back.”\n\nThe photo of the scratches show long red marks which Cummings said were about six inches long.\n\n“It was a scary feeling knowing you can be harmed,” Cummings said. “But at the same time, an adrenaline rush when something unexplainable happens. That’s why we do it.”\n\nThe second encounter occurred while Cross the Line Paranormal was investigating an old local hospital.\n\n“We caught a stick figure on camera,” Cummings said. “We filmed for over two hours and interacted with it.”\n\nThe strange entity moved around the hallway, went into a room and came back out, and even got in one of the investigator’s laps and moved to her right hand. The screenshots from the video Cummings shared show the odd figure moving from the investigator’s left shoulder and in her right hand.\n\n“Of course, we were more excited than scared about actually catching something on video, which is rare,” Cummings said. “Mostly you catch electronic voice phenomenon (EVPS).”\n\nAnother story Cummings shared was about a Valdosta family who was scared in their own home near the Valdosta State University. The ghost of an old woman and man wanted them out of their old house, Cummings said.\n\n“The family moved soon after we investigated due to the EVP we caught,” Cummings said. “We asked if the ghost said ‘Kill the kids’? And we got a creepy female response ‘YES!'”\n\nAt another house on the north end of Valdosta, Cummings and his crew at Cross the Line Paranormal investigated a house where there was a documented suicide.\n\n“We got an EVP,” Cummings shared. “It said, ‘Hey, hey, there I ain’t gonna getcha“.\n\nAlso if anyone reaches out and are afraid of their own home, Cross the Line Paranormal offer free investigations to see if they can find out what’s going on and hopefully give the homeowner a piece of mind."
