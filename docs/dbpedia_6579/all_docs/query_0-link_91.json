        "text": "With 30 years of experience researching the unknown, Dustin Pari brings exciting and positive lectures about the paranormal all across the country. As a part of television's Ghost Hunters, Ghost Hunters International, and appearances on Destination Truth and Ghost Nation, Dustin has traveled the world over looking for answers and expanding his understanding of the unseen realm.\n\nDustin's fascination with the paranormal began with an encounter he had with a spirit in his childhood home. In his efforts to better understand what had happened, and why, he has traveled across the United States and to 27 countries on 6 different continents, learning a little more with each step of his journey.\n\nThroughout the year he travels as an invited guest lecturer at the largest paranormal and spiritual conferences and conventions in the country. He has been interviewed by television's Anderson Cooper and has done radio shows and podcasts all around the globe. He has written two books based upon his findings and his unique approach to the paranormal, along with three other books that include stories from life on the road. He has also designed and published multiple coloring books for children and adults.\n\nDustin is known for his strange and slightly offbeat sense of humor, which helps to balance the light and dark material that can make up the paranormal world. He focuses his research on the connections between the spiritual world and our mortal realm.\n\nIn addition to conducting his paranormal research, Dustin also does a lot of work as a motivational speaker, mental health and suicide awareness advocate, and Christian lecturer. His paranormal lectures are not to be missed!\n\nWhen not touring the lecture circuit, Dustin works as a surgical anesthesia assistant. In his limited free time he enjoys being with his family, watching NASCAR, listening to music, and taking in a good slice of pie from a greasy late-night diner."
