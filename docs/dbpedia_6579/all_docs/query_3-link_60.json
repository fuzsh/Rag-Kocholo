        "text": "From Halloween enthusiasts to thrill-seekers to history buffs, people of all kinds love visiting haunted places. For some, it's the draw of the adrenaline rush—that heart-pounding, hair-raising feeling when something spooky lay around the corner. For others, it’s the gripping backstory or the social aspect of braving a visit (after all, nothing bonds a group together quite like intrigue—or terror).\n\nLucky for adrenaline junkies and ghostbusters alike, America has no shortage of haunted places, from centuries-old cemeteries to abandoned Gold Rush towns to spooky, ghost-filled houses. While some let you wander through on your own, it’s often a good idea to book a ghost tour to get the full story—and an extra set of eyes (just in case).\n\nSo grab your EMF meter, a sack of salt and your crew—things are about to get ghastly at the most haunted places in America."
