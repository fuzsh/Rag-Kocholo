        "text": "Join our team of professionals on the Ghost Hunters of Savannah Paranormal Investigation. The site of 416 W. Liberty Street is shrouded in mystery and lore.

Savannah is known as the Most Haunted City in America, and 416 W. Liberty fits right into the fabric of that story.\n\nAllow our experienced investigators, masters of the paranormal realm, to divulge their secrets, preparing you for the spooky phenomena you may encounter. And learn of the myriad of paranormal experiences that have been witnessed such as the dark heavy cloud seen hovering above the bar, whispers heard coming from the restrooms, and the spirit on the third floor hiding behind a pillar.\n\nThe power is in your hands to decide whether 416 W. Liberty is truly haunted, but be warned: you might just leave with a spine-tingling belief in the otherworldly.\n\nBefore your investigation begins, our experienced guides will share their techniques to prepare you for any strange and peculiar phenomena that you may encounter. Each guest will be provided with and trained to use an array of traditional and state-of-the-art ghost-hunting equipment or feel free to bring their own devices from home.
