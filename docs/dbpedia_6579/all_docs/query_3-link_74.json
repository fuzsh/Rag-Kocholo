They travel to some of the country’s most haunted locations where they provide a fresh and sometimes comedic outlook on the supernatural.\n\nThe night will begin with Spratt sharing videos and experiences as a ghost hunter; he’ll end with a Q&A.\n\nThis spooky discussion will happen Tuesday, Oct. 26 at 7:30 p.m. in Woodward Hall. Entry is free to students who present a UNM ID or vaccine card."
