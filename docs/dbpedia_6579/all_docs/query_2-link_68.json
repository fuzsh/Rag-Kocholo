        "text": "The Doris Bither Case\n\nEasily the most famous case investigated by Barry and Kerry is the Doris Bither case. In 1974, Doris Bither reported the alarming phenomena she was experiencing at her Culver City home. She claimed that she was being abused by three violent entities.\n\nBarry and Kerry conducted a preliminary interview of Bither and were initially skeptical until they both observed a metal skillet leap out of a lower cupboard in her kitchen, flying across the room several feet. They investigated her home several times over an 11-week period and captured strange arcs of light in photographs. Barry & Kerry also experienced balls of light flying past them, felt unexplained temperature drops, and watched a “lime-green” apparition of a man materialize in the corner of Bither’s bedroom. As Barry would later describe it, “Suddenly the lights coalesced in the corner . . . we could see from the waist up a large apparition of a [man].”\n\nOn another visit, a group of investigators gathered in the bedroom in an attempt to contact and communicate with the spirit. Kerry recalled hearing a whispering voice repeating, \"kiss me, kill me,\" just before a heavy flowerpot, which had been sitting across the room, crashed into the center of the group, narrowly missing the heads of the assembled.\n\nThe Entity\n\nBarry and Kerry’s experiences at Doris’s house spawned the book and 1982 movie The Entity , starring Barbara Hershey. Both were written by Frank De Felitta. The movie follows the story of a woman who is tormented by unseen entities. While the movie takes some creative liberties, according to Barry, it is largely based on the events of the Doris Bither case. Although Barry and Kerry profited from consulting on the movie, their mentor Thelma Moss panned it as the “worst kind of sensationalism.”\n\nOther Cases\n\nBarry and Kerry went their separate ways after the UCLA parapsychology lab closed in 1978. However, they continued to investigate haunted houses separately.\n\nIn 2010, Barry Taff wrote a book about his paranormal experiences and investigations entitled Aliens Above, Ghost Below. Most of Kerry’s cases are less well-known. One of Kerry's cases had a startling resemblance to the Doris Bither case. The claimant in this case, a woman from the Midwest, reported the continuing appearances of hooded figures around her bed at night. In one instance, the woman claimed one figure overtook her with its cold, clammy, three-fingered hands. According to Kerry “it dragged her over towards the window,” but thankfully gave up, when her leg became stuck, and vanished.\n\nIn Kerry’s own experience sometimes ghosts got a little too close for comfort. In an interview he admitted, “I’ve never been harmed, but I have been grabbed, pushed, slapped, had pencils knocked out of my pocket. I’ve had my leg grabbed onto and held for about a minute, and that is a terrifying experience.\"\n\nNot all ghosts were so scary, however. Kerry jokingly dubbed one of his cases the “rent-a-geist”. This helpful ghost rearranged the kitchen at night and washed the dishes."
