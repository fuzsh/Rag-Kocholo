My daughter LOVES ghosts shows and stories. I was looking for something different from the common walking ghost tours. After reading through the reviews and the fact that you get to use actual equipment, Stories In The Cemetery was the one to go with. Nick is very well versed in historical information! One person in our group actually brought her own equipment and Nick was excited with sharing quick suggestions and differences compared to his equipment. He is also up front with what to expect. Some nights are more active than others! Our tour was not a very active night but we did catch a couple orbs and many terms/phrases were caught on the spirit box corresponding to locations that we were exploring. I would definitely suggest booking a ghost hunt with Nick and plan on booking with him again the next time we are in town!\n\nVery fun way to spend a night in Charleston! Hands on with real ghost-hunting equipment, and historical facts that enhance the hunt. Nick is very informative and looks out to make sure all the guests have a great time. Highly recommended!\n\nVery fun way to spend a night in Charleston! Hands on with real ghost-hunting equipment, and historical facts that enhance the hunt.
