        "text": "The demand to feel like a real-life ghostbuster in Delaware is so high that paranormal investigations are already sold out for the rest of this Halloween season at the notorious Fort Delaware.\n\nBump watching TikTok and YouTube videos, Diamond State Ghost Investigators are giving a hands-on tutorial on how to catch spirits at Fort Delaware.\n\nThe fortress has a reputation for being littered with apparitions.\n\nThough Fort Delaware's paranormal tours are full, here's what you need to know before going there for spooky season in 2024.\n\n'Ghost Hunters' TV star says Fort Delaware is scary\n\nDaryl Marston from the A&E reality show \"Ghost Hunters\" (2019-22) said Fort Delaware is hands-down the most haunted place in the state. It's also one of the spookiest places he's visited around the country, he added.\n\nThe Middletown resident has done over 400 ghost investigations in about every state in the country except Hawaii. He's also worked in Canada and the UK.\n\nSo what makes Fort Delaware such an eerie place?\n\n\"I mean, the history of it. You had at one point 11,000 POWs (prisoners of war) that were stationed there from the Battle of Gettysburg, and almost 3,000 died there,\" Marston said.\n\nThe ghost chaser is doing signings of his new book, which mentions Fort Delaware, for a sold-out crowd at the legendary fortress on Saturday, Oct. 21.\n\nMarston's book is titled \"The Horrors of the House of Wills: A True Story of a Paranormal Investigator's Most Terrifying Case.\"\n\nFort Delaware gave 'Ghost Hunters' star his start\n\nThe ghost investigator said Fort Delaware inspired him to become a ghost chaser after his mom and stepsister dragged him to a paranormal investigation there in 2005.\n\nThat's when he witnessed a \"half-body apparition,\" or a spirit who was missing the lower half of his body.\n\n\"What really stuck out to me was he had a very disheveled dirty beard,\" Marston recalled.\n\n\"I remember seeing distinctly like debris in his beard, dirt, leaves or something. He was only there for maybe eight or 10 seconds, and he just kind of vanished.\"\n\nMarston said paranormal tours were taboo back then, and he was unaware that real ghostbusters existed. But that changed after his supernatural encounter on Pea Patch Island.\n\nWhat is Fort Delaware?\n\nLocated on Pea Patch Island on the Delaware River, the Fort was initially used as a fortress and prisoner of war camp for Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. These days, the site is a historical park that's popular for historical re-enactments. But there are many legends about spirits wandering around the island.\n\nLee Jennings, former chief of cultural resources at Delaware State Parks, told The News Journal/Delaware Online in 2008 that â€œthere have been ghost stories in Fort Delaware that originate from World War II.\"\n\nWhat should you wear to a ghost hunt?\n\nWearing comfortable clothes is your best friend at Fort Delaware. The most important thing is to make sure you wear closed-toe shoes. That's because you'll be asked to walk on wet biomats to prevent the spreading of spores, according to Delaware State Parks' website.\n\nWhat is a 'Paranormal Adventure'?\n\nFor most of the Fort Delaware ghost events over the next two weekends, which are titled \"Paranormal Adventure,\" participants (age 13 or older) spend three hours with Diamond State Ghost Investigators for a recreational ghost hunt.\n\n\"Be part of an actual paranormal investigation by using electronic magnetic field detectors and other techniques,\" according to the event's description.\n\nThe final event this month is on Saturday, Oct. 28 and is titled \"Pea Patch Extended Paranormal Investigation is for five hours.\" That event is intended for hardcore ghost chasers and offers them five hours of fun.\n\nMore information about paranormal tours is at destateparks.com/History/FortDelaware or (302) 834-7941.\n\nAndre Lamar is the features/lifestyle reporter.
