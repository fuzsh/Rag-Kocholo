        "text": "Do you believe in ghosts? A Moorhead man didn’t until now. He tells us he’s second guessing everything he believes in after capturing what he says is some kind of spirit on video at a popular tourist destination in northeastern Minnesota.\n\nMiles Halvorson decided to take a trip to Duluth and visit the historic Glensheen Mansion. It was his first time there and he was blown away by the intricate details of the iconic and posh home. But it wasn't until the next day when he was looking through pictures and videos he captured inside, when he noticed something that caught his eye and gave him goose bumps.\n\n\"I don't see anything when I’m actually there but in the video, I see something that looks like something that has human form and it's moving and it has this illuminated or glowing head of some type,\" says Moorhead Resident, Miles Halvorson.\n\nHalvorson has always been a very skeptical person, he has a degree in science but he says he had a hard time finding an explanation for what he saw.\n\n\"It's not a jacket, it's not a mannequin. I had the director of the place confirm that it wasn't a mannequin or some object that they had,\" says Halvorson.\n\nBut he wanted some more information. So he says he sent the video and pictures to a ghost hunter down south. He tells us they agree with him, there's something going on there.\n\nBut here in Fargo, we contacted a team of ghost hunters and they're a little more skeptical.\n\n\"My first impression is it looked like a stationary figure. The arm was holding steady and it looked like the camera was moving a little bit. It looked like a mannequin,\" says Fargo Ghost Chaser, Dennis Volker.\n\nThe team is called Fargo Ghost Chasers and they've done their fair share of investigating paranormal phenomenons. They've also visited the same mansion and while they're not convinced Havlorson's video shows a ghost, they do say they believe the place could be haunted.\n\n\"I could feel almost being stared at,\" says Fargo Ghost Chaser, Kelli Muchow.\n\nAs for Halvorson, he says his experience at the Glensheen Mansion has been a life-changing event. In fact he tells us he's not going back there again. But he says since this experience, he's now a little more aware of those things that go bump in the night.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, the Glensheen Mansion was built around 1905. It was also the site of two murders in the late 70's. We reached out to the organization involved with the mansion to ask about the video in question but they have yet to return our calls.\n\nAlso, if you ever find yourself questioning something strange in a photo or hear some unknown noises in your home, contact the ghost chasers. They encourage people to email any questionable pictures or video and they'll investigate."
