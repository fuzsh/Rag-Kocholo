Three members with 20+ years of experience. Three members with 15+ years of experience and 6 members with 10+ years of experience.\n\n​\n\nOur team comprises investigators, tech specialists, audio specialists, researchers and psychics/mediums. We have come together as a team to share our experiences and expertise in investigating the paranormal and to give our clients the best they can receive in investigations and research of their homes and businesses.\n\nOur 42 full-time members have over 380 years’ total experience in investigations and the paranormal field. As individual investigators, we have been on over 1600 investigations, from a small two-bedroom apartment in West Virginia to a large 12th-century castle in Scotland.\n\n​\n\nWe use a wide variety of equipment during our investigations to gather data and evidence to prove or disprove if your home or business is experiencing true paranormal activity. However, the most important thing we bring to an investigation is ourselves and our common sense. In a lot of cases, paranormal activity can have a logical and natural explanation.\n\n​\n\nWe do not ask for any money or donations for any investigation. All our investigations are free. Each member purchases his or her own equipment and pays for any travel that may be required.\n\n​\n\nWe are here because we want for you to feel comfortable in your home or business.\n\nIf you are experiencing unusual activity in your home or business and need some answers or if you would like any other information or have any questions, please click on the following button and we will contact you in a timely manner.\n\n​\n\nIf you feel you are experiencing demonic activity, please follow this link to the Paranormal Clergy Institute to inquire for help\n\n​\n\nIf you would like to join Tri-C Ghost Hunters please fill out our application on the link below."
