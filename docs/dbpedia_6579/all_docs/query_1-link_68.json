        "text": "By Thomas Worsdale NAVAIR Lakehurst Public Affairs\n\nA production crew from the SyFy Channel's television series, \"Ghost Hunters,\" arrived at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in early October to film an episode of the show.\n\nA crew of 17 descended on Lakehurst's Hangar 1 - the Hindenburg crash site - as well as the Branch Medical Clinic. They were out to find any \"paranormal\" activity taking place on the base.\n\nSeries founders and hosts, Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson and the team from The Atlantic Paranormal Society, based out of Providence, R.I, .conducted investigations for three nights around the base.\n\nTAPS set up video cameras, sound equipment and heat sensing devices in an effort to substantiate or debunk any rumors about ghosts haunting the cavernous trappings of Hangar 1 and the nooks and crannies in and about the Branch Medical Clinic.\n\nDuring the five-year run of \"Ghost Hunters,\" episodes have been filmed at both Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola.\n\nThe Lakehurst edition of \"Ghost Hunters\" is scheduled as the season's final episode in late November. Check local listings for the exact time and date of the Lakehurst episode."
