        "text": "April 2020 — I love this quote by the 45th Governor of Texas (1933-2006), Ann Richards, who was the second female governor of Texas (the first was Miriam A. Ferguson) and frequently quoted for her outspoken feminism and her one-liners. She gained superstar status, at least in the eyes of many who were her fans. What makes someone a superstar? According to Urban Dictionary, it’s “someone who exhibits an amplified individuality. There just seems to be more of him or her there! This happens when there is resonance between someone’s inherent creative expression, what they do on a daily basis, and the social system that they are a part of. Being a superstar has nothing to do with fame or fortune—even though some superstars may have either or both.”\n\nThis definition illustrates the lives of the wonderful women we are featuring in the April 2020 issue of Inkandescent Women magazine. Among them are Connie Hillman, Elton John’s right hand for 43 years, and the wife of rocker Chris Hillman. She is one of the few women in the music industry to hold such an impressive series of positions.\n\nIn good company with her are Camilla McGuinn, manager of rock star Roger McGuinn. “We weren’t married for two years when it became clear that I’d become the roadie,” Camilla says, noting they first began touring the country in a Mercedes sedan, but quickly realized that if they needed to sleep in the vehicle, something larger was required. Soon after, they invested in a VW van. “You can put a couch in there, a TV, and a hot plate. It’s great. We love the camping life.”\n\nAuthor and filmmaker Jennifer Niven are also on our Superstar list: “In 2000, I started writing full-time, and I haven’t stopped. I’ve written nonfiction and fiction, both historical and contemporary, adult and YA. At first glance, my books are all over the map, but if you look closely they share a common theme: they are stories about ordinary people doing extraordinary things.”\n\nAnd, we shine a spotlight on artist Whitney Sherman, creator of the breast cancer stamp; fashionista Laura Lee Williams, who launched a beaded pocketbook empire; Olympic athlete Tara Sheahan who turned her skiing career into a global leadership company; futurist Cindy Frewen who shares her ideas about the “future of cities;” and amazing Miami photographer Cindy Seip, who shares details of “My Life as a Mermaid.”"
