It was in 2010 that Lisa Faulkner first met TV chef John Torode as she was taking part in Celebrity MasterChef – which she won. Two years later, romance blossomed and they married in 2019.

Here, Lisa opens up about their marriage, being mum to daughter Billie, whom she adopted with her ex-husband, the actor Chris Coghill, and family life…

Your daughter is now a teenager. Is that tricky?

She is actually a super teenager. She spends a lot of time in her room, on her phone, watching Netflix and hanging out with her mates, but I feel so lucky. She’s incredible.

You’re a stepmum to John’s kids, too – Jonah, Lulu, Marselle and Casper. How do you find that role?

I love the fact we have a house full of children. Most of them are teenagers now, who stomp around and leave mess everywhere! But we eat and chat together and I absolutely love every single minute.

Who does most of the cooking at home?

It’s an equal split. And it’s whoever’s not busy. If we’re both working, we’ll do something easy.

How do you find working together on John And Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen?

I feel like I get to work with my best mate, and he’s always so supportive. Sometimes, I’ll be worried about a recipe because I’ve only done it once, and he’ll be like, “You’ve got it, you know this.”

And we have such a laugh that we honestly forget that we’re filming a TV show – it’s like we’re in our kitchen at home.

Has marriage changed your relationship?

It has cemented our partnership. I love that we’re married. I feel so happy. I’m so pleased we got married in 2019 and not 2020!

You’ve just partnered with Ninja Foodi Zerostick Cookware…

You will never see me endorse any brands that I haven’t used myself, so I got their non-stick pans to try them out before I partnered with them – and I love them.
