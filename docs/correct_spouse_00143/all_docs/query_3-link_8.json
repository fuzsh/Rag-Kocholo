After becoming friends, John asked the former EastEnders actress on a date but he told The Sunday Times he was too \"cowardly\" to risk her saying no face-to-face!\n\nWATCH: Lisa Faulkner's kitchen mishap leaves John Torode and fans in hysterics\n\nHe said: \"I'd separated from my wife [Jessica] which was awful, and I was reluctant to approach Lisa face to face as I didn't fancy the prospect of her saying no, so I wrote her a letter.\n\n\"If I'd got no response, it wouldn't matter. Cowardly? [Expletive], yeah. I'm as cowardly as they get.\"\n\nREAD: Lisa Faulkner and John Torode's romantic wedding was a fairytale – photos and details\n\nSHOP: 10 discounted wedding dresses in the January sales\n\nThe couple got married in 2019\n\nClearly, she agreed to a date and the rest is history! The pair tied the knot on 24 October 2019 in front of their close friends and family at Aynhoe Park in Northamptonshire. Their wedding celebrations were held over two days, with the happy couple enjoying a pre-wedding dinner on the eve of their big day.\n\nLisa was a beautiful bride in an ivory fitted dress with a cap-sleeve lace bodice for the marriage ceremony. Later in the day at the reception, she removed the bodice overlay to reveal the elegant gown underneath, which featured spaghetti straps and a gathered waistband.\n\nLisa's stunning engagement ring from John\n\nThe actress previously told HELLO! about her relationship with John: \"I love being with him. We don't stop talking – chat, chat, chat. He's like my best mate.\"\n\nJohn also opened up about their blended family to The Sunday Times, describing it as \"very much like a modern family, and everybody bounces off each other.\" John is father to four children, Lulu and Jonah with ex-wife Jessica, and Casper and Marselle from another relationship, while Lisa is mother to an adopted daughter, Billie, with her ex-husband Chris Coghill.\n\nREAD: John Torode and Lisa Faulkner's family life: Everything you need to know"
