        "text": "FOR British actress Lisa Faulkner and her sister Victoria, the most challenging time in their very close relationship occurred five years ago, when Victoria tentatively told her older sister that she was thinking of trying for another baby. At the time, Lisa and her actor husband Chris Coghill had been through IVF, which hadn't worked, and she despaired of ever having children, while Victoria had two older girls, Lola, now 14, and Eva-Rose, 11.\n\n\"Jonny was a bit of an afterthought as I'd had the girls so young,\" says Victoria. \"I didn't really want to say to Lisa that we were thinking of having another baby as it was a bit sensitive for her. Then it happened really quickly and I got pregnant within a month, and telling her was just awful.\"\n\n\"Yes, she's Miss Fertile,\" laughs Lisa. \"It seemed so unfair at the time as I thought I was never going to have a baby, and I wondered how I'd feel about Jonny. It was different when the girls were born as I wasn't at the stage of trying back then and I adored them instantly. I was Victoria's birth partner, and as soon as I locked eyes on the baby, I loved him. He's four now and he's my little angel. It's funny because from all that angst came this beautiful little boy, and he's amazing.\"\n\nThe story had a happy ending for Lisa too, as in 2008 she adopted her adored five-year-old daughter Billie, when she was 15 months old. It was a shock to the system as all of a sudden there was a little child running around, she says, but she was so thrilled with her little girl and fell completely in love with her the minute she met her.\n\nLisa, 40, started off her career modelling and then became an actress. She has appeared in TV dramas Dangerfield and Brookside, and is best known for her role as Dr Victoria Merrick in the medical drama Holby -- a character who ended up stabbed to death by the father of a patient she couldn't save. She met her husband Chris (Eastenders, Shameless) when they starred together in Burn It. She is a presenter on the BBC series Heir Hunters, and discovered that she is also a very talented chef while winning Celebrity MasterChef in 2010.\n\nLisa and Victoria are from Kingston in Surrey, and they always had a really close relationship. Like all sisters, they'd fight at times, but whenever their mother Julie asked them if they wanted to have friends over for company, they always said no as they preferred to play with each other.\n\nAnd even though Victoria is two years younger, Lisa recalls how her sister was really protective of her, and intervened when some schoolmates started bullying her.\n\n\"When people were mean to her, I couldn't bear it, and I always stuck up for her,\" says Victoria. \"I still do that now. These girls used to push her in the mud, so I had it out with them and they never did it again. The best thing about Lisa is her generosity with everything and everybody -- even with people who are mean and nasty.\n\n\"We have always been so close, and even when she started having boyfriends, I used to tag along on dates -- sometimes on the back of her boyfriends' friends' motorbikes. My two girls love going around to her house -- they think she's amazing, and we all adore Billie -- it's as if she has always been in our family.\"\n\nOne of the things that brought the sisters and their dad David even closer together was the sad passing of their mother Julie when she was only 44. She had throat cancer and was ill for two years, although the girls say that their parents did their best to shelter them from her illness. Lisa was 16 and Victoria 14 when she died, and they were devastated at her passing.\n\n\"Mummy was a force and a whirlwind,\" says Lisa. \"She was so full of life and vitality, and her social life came before the housework! She was a great cook, which is what inspired my new cookbook, Recipes from my Mother for my Daughter. I always loved food and having people over for lunch, and after doing MasterChef, I had lots of recipes in my head from Mummy. Not only her, but from our godmothers and grandmothers and friends, and each one evoked a memory and a story. I couldn't type at first so I wrote it long-hand and Victoria typed it up for me, and she gave me some great advice along the way.\"\n\nLisa's career has taken a few turns, beginning with being spotted at a Tube station and signed up by a modelling scout when she was only 17. She left home and travelled all around the world, and says that it was the perfect time for her as she was unsettled at school after her mother died and felt that her young friends didn't really know how to handle her. She loved modelling but missed home, and letters from her sister kept her going.\n\nHer acting career began when director Jean-Jacques Annaud spotted her in the teen magazine, Just Seventeen, and whisked her to Paris to screen-test for a part in his film The Lover.\n\n\"I got the part even though I had no acting experience,\" she says. \"I think with Mummy dying so young, I realised that life is too short, so I always took opportunities that came my way.\"\n\nVictoria, meanwhile, went to study English and the history of ideas at Middlesex University, and then got a job with designer John Richmond in Covent Garden. It was very exciting, she says, as stylists and famous celebrities were always popping in. She married Alan in 1999 and is now a full-time mum to her three children, and lives about two roads away from Lisa.\n\n\"My life is pretty manic and the only time I completely relax is when I go to Victoria's house,\" says Lisa. \"She and Alan have created the most beautiful home. She's just amazing, and she makes everything warm and safe and loving. She's my best friend and the most special thing about her is that she always radiates love and warmth.\"\n\nLisa Faulkner's cookbook, Recipes From My Mother To My Daughter, is out now (Simon & Schuster, €20.99)"
