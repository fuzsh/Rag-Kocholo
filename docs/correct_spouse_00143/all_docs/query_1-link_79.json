        "text": "Despite having a successful career and a husband she loved, something was missing from Lisa’s life – a baby.\n\nShe desperately wanted to be a mother.\n\nLisa had been trying to conceive for five months when she discovered she was pregnant.\n\nBut her happiness was short-lived.\n\nJust a few days later, she was rushed to hospital in agony, and it was revealed the pregnancy was ectopic.\n\nThe foetus had implanted in the fallopian tube, rather than the womb, and the tube had ruptured.\n\nThe surgeon was forced to remove it – along with the foetus.\n\nLisa’s ectopic pregnancy marked the start of an emotional five-year battle in which she tried every means possible to conceive again.\n\nAnd it’s this struggle that inspired her to write her deeply personal memoir, Meant To Be: My Journey To Motherhood.\n\nShe admits that on her darkest days she wished she’d had a similar book to support and guide her through her own difficult period.\n\n‘I’ve met quite a few people over the years who have said to me, “I had a nightmare trying to have kids and doing IVF and I didn’t know what the next stage was.”\n\n‘They were stuck,’ says Lisa.\n\n‘Also, I didn’t have a hand to hold when I was going through it, and I often felt very lonely.\n\n‘It was a long and difficult journey.\n\n‘So this time last year I started writing the book.’\n\nLisa eventually adopted and is now mum to 12-year-old Billie.\n\nBut her daughter’s arrival is only one part of the story.\n\nThe rest of her book focuses on the gruelling processes she went through beforehand: the alternative therapies, medications, IUI (intrauterine insemination), IVF (in vitro fertilisation) and an investigation into surrogacy.\n\nIt’s an extremely raw account that at times makes for difficult reading.\n\nBut for Lisa, actually writing the book was easier than she had expected.\n\n‘My dad is reading my book at the moment and he said, “Did you find it easy? Because it’s not easy stuff to read.”\n\n‘And I told him it just flew out of me.\n\n‘I couldn’t stop once I’d started.\n\n‘There was so much I wanted to write down, and it felt like therapy.\n\n‘It’s amazing because at the start you’re thinking, “It’s this many thousand words, I’ll never make that,” and before you know it, you’re there.’\n\nTo give as detailed an account as possible, Lisa dug out the diaries she’d kept religiously during those years, and extracts from them feature in the book.\n\nShe also made a difficult return visit to Dr Mohamed Taranissi, the Harley Street specialist she saw during her IVF treatment.\n\n‘When I walked through those doors, I was like, “Oh gosh, here I am again,” and it brought back loads of stuff,’ she says.\n\n‘It was hard. Dr Taranissi was so lovely and he remembered me.\n\n‘He had my files and I ended up in tears as we were talking.\n\n‘IVF didn’t work out for me, but that doesn’t mean he wasn’t brilliant,’ she adds.\n\n‘He was a big part of my life. IVF is really tough.\n\n‘People don’t think about how hard it is.\n\n‘They just go, “OK, now we’re going to do IVF,” and actually the emotional stress of it is brutal.’\n\nLisa’s three failed attempts at IVF nearly broke her emotionally, physically and financially.\n\nAfter the third failure, both she and Dr Taranissi agreed they had come to the end of the road.\n\nThroughout that period, Lisa was fortunate to have an amazing support network.\n\nAlthough she and Chris have now gone their separate ways, in the book she speaks highly of her former husband.\n\nHer friends and fellow actresses Nicola Stephenson and Angela Griffin were always on the other end of the phone when she needed them, and her father and her younger sister Victoria rallied round too.\n\nLisa’s mother died of cancer when she was just 16 and the actress reflects that this loss – something she dedicates a chapter of her book to – brought her and younger sister Victoria closer together, with each acting as the other’s mum.\n\n‘We mother each other and we have a very tight bond.\n\n‘She was there for me every step of the way and I don’t know where I’d be without her,’ says Lisa.\n\n‘Victoria has since told me she felt helpless when I was going through this, because she couldn’t make it right for me.\n\n‘She always had this blind faith that I would conceive, that I would be a mum like her [Victoria has two little girls].\n\n‘And of course I was, in the end, but in a very different way.’\n\nLisa’s life changed when she found Billie.\n\nBut she remains open about the fact this wasn’t something she originally thought she could do.\n\nBoth she and Chris initially felt the challenges of adopting might be too difficult for them to deal with, and it was only after several meetings and workshops with an adoption agency that they changed their minds.\n\n‘We all find family in different ways.\n\n‘I believed that it would come because my choice was to be a mother any way that I could,’ says Lisa.\n\n‘If I couldn’t conceive, I still wanted to be a mother and that’s a big decision for people to make.\n\n‘Some people go, “If I can’t conceive, I don’t want to be a mother.”\n\n‘Or maybe they want to be a mother in a different way.\n\n‘Once I started down the adoption route, there was no other choice for me.’\n\nIt’s a decision Lisa has never regretted.\n\nAlthough there have been highs and lows, her daughter is the best thing that ever happened to her, she says, and her arrival marked a new chapter in her life.\n\nShe is happy that she can now share her book with Billie too.\n\n‘It was important that Billie was old enough to be able to read it and understand it,’ she says.\n\n‘She’s very strong and much better at handling her emotions than I am.\n\n‘She holds my hand, going, “Don’t cry, Mum.”’\n\nThe other person Lisa wanted to share the book with is her fiancé, chef and Masterchef judge John Torode, to whom she got engaged at Christmas after six and a half years of dating.\n\nShe says he was the one who initially encouraged her to sit down and write the book.\n\n‘When I told him about my idea, he said, “You’ve got to do this.”\n\n‘He’s been so supportive, because of course I’ve been sitting there in the kitchen tapping away on my computer and things have been coming back to me and I’ve been reading diaries and crying,’ she reveals.\n\n‘He always supports me and always believes in me – more than I believe in myself sometimes,’ she adds.\n\nConsidering what she has achieved, self-doubt is the last thing you would expect from Lisa.\n\nAlthough it was acting that made her a household name, she has reinvented herself in recent years as a TV chef after winning the 2010 series of Celebrity Masterchef.\n\nShe has presented food shows and written multiple cookbooks, and this year she and John began fronting their own Saturday cookery series on ITV, John And Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen.\n\nThe second series, which saw the couple whipping up dishes while chatting with celebrity guests, including some of their famous friends, concluded in August.\n\n‘It’s lovely,’ Lisa says.\n\n‘We have such a nice time.\n\n‘It’s so fun that we sort of forget we’re on television and not at home.\n\n‘It’s just like being in our kitchen.’\n\nIn 2017, Lisa returned to her roots to play hard-nosed businesswoman Fi Browning in EastEnders.\n\nShe still has the acting bug and says in an ideal world she would balance her career as a chef with television roles.\n\n‘After doing EastEnders I thought, “I thoroughly enjoyed that, playing a character again,” then I did a very small part in a great real-life crime series, A Confession, on ITV.\n\n‘It’s lovely to cook, but I still have a passion for acting.\n\n‘It gets my heart beating.’\n\nRight now, though, Lisa has enough on her plate.\n\nHigh on her priority list is her autumn wedding.\n\n‘I can’t wait,’ she says.\n\n‘It’s not going to be a huge wedding, but it’ll be a nice size.”’\n\nAnd Billie, of course, will have a starring role on the day.\n\n‘She’ll be walking down the aisle as my best woman.’\n\nAfter years of heartache, it seems Lisa has finally found her happy ever after. ■\n\nHOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR SUNDAY?\n\n■ What’s your favourite way to spend a Sunday?\n\nIt would be with family and friends.\n\nI like to catch up properly with everyone, because it’s not always possible in the week.\n\nAnd we’ll always take our Miniature Schnauzer Rory for a walk too.\n\n■ Pub lunch or home-cooked roast?\n\nSunday lunch is my favourite meal, whether it’s at the pub, at a friend’s, or at home.\n\nWe also have a full English breakfast on Sunday, so it’s a big day of eating!\n\n■ Movie night at the cinema or box set at home?\n\nAs a family, we love a box set.\n\nJohn and I recently binge-watched Dirty John on Netflix , and Billie and I love Riverdale, Jane The Virgin and Gilmore Girls.\n\nWe actually named our dog Rory Gilmore after the Gilmore Girls!\n\nAfter that, a long, relaxing bath tops the weekend off nicely.\n\n■ Any time for wedding planning?\n\nYes, we’re doing lots of planning right now.\n\nIt’s going well and we’re both very excited.\n\nLisa’s Faulkner’s book, Meant To Be: My Journey To Motherhood (Ebury, £16.99), is out now."
