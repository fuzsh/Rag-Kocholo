        "text": "Celebrity chefs John Torode and Lisa Faulkner beamed with joy as they announced their latest venture in a heartwarming video. The culinary power couple, who have been married for half a decade, took to Instagram this Friday to reveal the release of their debut joint cookbook.\n\nIn an endearing clip posted on Lisa's Instagram story, the duo is seen strolling through a woodland setting, hinting at \"very exciting news\" that they're eager to share with their followers. Lisa, unable to contain her excitement, hinted: \"We can't wait to share it, so I think, in the next hour or so it will be up on our stories.\"\n\nTrue to their word, not long after, John and Lisa unveiled the cover of their collaborative cookery book. The cover of 'John and Lisa's Kitchen' showcases the pair smiling and enjoying time together in their kitchen.\n\n\"We're so excited to be sharing our first book together with you all\", Lisa expressed in a story slide, reports the Mirror. She later gave fans a sneak peek into the making of the cover, which included a photoshoot at their opulent London residence.\n\nJohn Torode and Lisa Faulkner have announced their first joint cookbook, which promises to blend \"everyday recipes from a professional chef and a home cook\". The book is set for release on September 12 and is currently available for pre-order at Â£19.99 from major retailers like Amazon and Waterstones.\n\nThis marks the couple's debut collaborative effort, following their individual culinary publications, and symbolises another milestone in their relationship. The pair, who are both stars of the MasterChef series, first crossed paths on the Celebrity Masterchef set in 2010, which Lisa won. However, it wasn't until five years later that their romance blossomed, as they were each married to other people at the time.\n\nJohn proposed to Lisa with a grand festive gesture, complete with a stunning diamond ring. In 2019, after four years together, they exchanged vows at the picturesque Aynhoe Park in Oxfordshire. Both John and Lisa bring children from previous relationships into their family.\n\nJohn is a proud father to four children, while Lisa adopted a daughter born in 2006 with her former husband and 'Burn It' co-star Chris Coghill, before their divorce in 2011. While they don't have any children together, John and Lisa are united by their shared passion for food."
