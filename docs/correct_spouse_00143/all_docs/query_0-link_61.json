        "text": "BBCMasterChef star John Torode has furiously slammed his wife Lisa Faulkner over a video on social media. John spoke out over a very awkward clip from their home.\n\nLisa was filming on social media - with John heard WEEING nearby. In the clip, Lisa laughed as she addressed viewers, saying : \"Can you hear that?\n\n\"I started my Instagram and John was weeing and you could hear.\" John was clearly unimpressed, and asked Lisa why she was filming him \"p*****g\".\n\nREAD MORE Better-off patients may have to pay to see a GP to save NHS\n\nLisa previously addressed her marriage to the BBC star, and said: “I don’t know if arrogance is the right word because I find arrogance quite attractive. He is brash and he knows how good he is at certain things.\n\n\"But I think he has got less… aggressive, maybe. He’s definitely softened. I went to lunch the other day and somebody said: ‘Oh my gosh, you’ve completely turned him around. He was so moody on MasterChef. He was always so grumpy and he’s just lovely now.’ I went: ‘OK, I’ll take all the credit.’”\n\n“We look after each other,\" she said. \"If he’s out before me in the morning, he’ll leave a cup with a teabag in by the kettle and a note saying: ‘I love you’. I do the same – I put notes in his bag when he goes away. And he makes me the most amazing food. That’s so romantic. It’s the little things that are important – I love it when we cook for each other. Food is our thing, it’s how we show that we love each other.”\n\nJohn has two grown-up sons, Casper and Marselle, from his first marriage, and Jonah, 17, and Lulu, 15, from his second. Lisa has a teenage daughter, Billie, with former husband Chris Coghill.\n\n“John and I have always had a rule that if we’re sitting down as a family or with friends, we don’t have our phones,” she says. “If you’re on the run and having breakfast or grabbing lunch then I totally get that you’ll be on your phone, we don’t have a rule then. But if we’re having dinner together as a family, we put our phones away.\n\n\"Having kids of different ages, especially teenagers, it’s really nice to just be able to connect. Even if it’s about cooking or making something or setting a table, just interacting with people. They are upstairs on their phones most of the time so you need to find those moments to chat, whether it is just those moments of, ‘Oh my gosh, I absolutely love what you’ve made for dinner,’ or, ‘How do we make this?’ or, ‘Can we make this together?’ Even if it’s who is going to be stacking the dishwasher, it’s just having those moments of positive interaction and chat.”"
