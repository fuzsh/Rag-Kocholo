        "text": "English actor\n\nChristopher Coghill (born 11 April 1975[1]) is an English actor, having had roles in Shameless, Burn It, Hotel Babylon, The Bill, New Tricks, Doctors, Holby City, Heartbeat, Secret Diary of a Call Girl, Waterloo Road and Cold Feet, and as Tony King in EastEnders.\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nCoghill has appeared in many television programmes such as HolbyBlue, Shameless,[2] Burn It,[2] Hotel Babylon, The Bill, New Tricks, Doctors, Holby City,[2] Heartbeat,[2] Secret Diary of a Call Girl, Waterloo Road and Cold Feet.
