        "text": "Lisa Faulkner, 51, has taken to Instagram to share sweet throwback photos on her fourth wedding anniversary to MasterChef's John Torode, 58.\n\nThe former EastEnders actress, who made her way as a TV chef after winning Celebrity MasterChef in 2010, posted a carousel of photos from their big day. The John and Lisa's Weekend Kitchen co-host shared two photos of their first kiss as husband and wife in front of their friends and family under a stunning flower arch.\n\nThe former Waterloo Road star also showed fans a photo of her bridesmaids descending an impressive staircase in pink and red satin floor-length gowns. The final photo in the carousel was a photo that we can presume was taken the morning of the wedding with Lisa in pink and white spotty pyjamas looking excited for the day ahead.\n\nShe captioned the post: \"Happy Anniversary my love @johntorodecooks 4 years!! I say Linen you say Fruit and flowers!!\".\n\n\"Thank you for loving me,\" Lisa continued. \"Love that when we kissed my leg kicked involuntarily #ikyyk I love you .\"\n\nThe pair tied the knot in 2019 in a stunning ceremony at Aynhoe Park in Banbury after seven years of dating. The actress wore a stunning high-neck white gown featuring a lace panel across her decolletage and up to her chin. The skirt of the dress was classic and simple.\n\nHer husband John Torode, known for being one of the renowned judges on MasterChef, wore a dapper navy suit with a buttonhole to match her bouquet of flowers including pink and white roses.\n\nWhen the pair wed, Lisa took to Instagram to share her news with her followers in a post captioned: \"The happiest day of my life!!! Cue the wedding spam for the next few weeks!\".\n\n\"Apologies in advance,\" the actress continued. \"Yesterday I married the man of my dreams @johntorodecooks and we had the BEST Day EVER, filled with all our family and friends and such love.\"\n\nIn attendance at their ceremony was an array of famous faces including Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden and former EastEnders stars Tamzin Outhwaite and Luisa Bradshaw White. John's MasterChef counterpart, Gregg Wallace also attended.\n\nJohn enjoyed newlywed bliss and said shortly after the wedding that he had married \"the girls of my dreams\".\n\nThis is both John and Lisa's second marriage. Lisa was previously married to EastEnders star Chris Coghill between 2005 and 2011. Whilst John was married to Jessica Torode for 14 years between 2000 and 2014.\n\nBetween them, the pair have five children. John has four children – Jonah, Lulu, Casper, and Marselle – while Lisa has one adoptive daughter, Billie.\n\nDISCOVER: Inside Lisa Faulkner's romantic beach getaway with husband John Torode\n\nThe throwback photos were such a treat for fans of the pair, especially as the ceremony was so visually stunning."
