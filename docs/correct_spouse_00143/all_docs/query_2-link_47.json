        "text": "CHRIS Coghill is famous for playing villain Tony King on EastEnders, but the star's reality is a lot more wholesome.\n\nThe actor was tasked with a very serious storyline on the soap, as his character Tony turned out to be grooming teen step-daughter Whitney Dean.\n\nEventually the girl spoke out about his predatory behaviour and the paedo killed himself in jail.\n\nDespite the dark plot Chris was involved with, he is proud of the role he played on the show.\n\nHe previously told the Sun: \"As a direct result of that storyline, about 10 people said, ‘That happened to me’, and went to the police and there have been quite a few convictions. Being an actor doesn’t really change people’s lives but without being a w****r, that did. And I’m proud of that.\"\n\nThankfully the soap star's life is completely different outside of EastEnders, and he has been nothing but an exemplary dad to his kid.\n\nThe 48-year-old has acted in a whole range of TV shows and films besides the BBC drama, including Shameless, Burn It, Holby City, Secret Diary of a Call Girl, Waterloo Road, and 24 Hour Party People.\n\nHe met his wife Lisa Faulkner while filming BBC sitcom Burn It and they fell in love on set.\n\nThe pair tied the knot in 2005 and even went on to adopt an adorable daughter together after Lisa went through three rounds of IVF.\n\nWhen they met little Billie-May, Lisa described feeling as if they were \"matched\", and said adopting her was the \"most incredible feeling\".\n\nSadly Chris and Lisa split up six years after getting married, but both have moved on and found new partners now.\n\nHe has been much more private about his marriage with famous actress Rosalind Halstead, and to this day the couple have not revealed anything about their wedding.\n\nHowever, Chris is still thick as thieves with Billie-May.\n\nThe dad often posts photos of the pair having a blast, and he recently took his daughter out to party at the wild Wilderness Festival in Oxfordshire."
