        "text": "Actor Lisa Faulkner has announced her engagement to celebrity chef John Torode - who she met while competing on MasterChef.\n\nFaulkner, 46, told followers on Instagram that her boyfriend had proposed on Christmas Day, but the couple had kept it under wraps until their family knew.\n\nShe wrote on Instagram: \"My gorgeous John completely surprised me on Christmas Day and asked me to marry him!\n\n\"After waiting to tell our family when we got home we then had a few days just grinning at each other!! I'm so very happy to share our lovely news with you.\n\n\"Happy 2019 it's going to be quite a year and I'm going to embrace every minute of it. All you need is love. Love is all you need.\"\n\nTorode then shared a picture of her by a swimming pool and wrote: \"And she said YES !! Bloody love my Lisa .. Have put a ring on it.\"\n\nTorode, 53, and Faulkner met in 2010 when she was on Celebrity MasterChef, which she went on to win. They began dating in 2012 after Faulkner's divorce from husband Chris Coghill and Torode's split from ex-wife Jessica.\n\nTorode has four children, two from his marriage and two from a previous relationship, while Faulkner has one adopted daughter.\n\nSince her appearance on Celebrity MasterChef, Faulkner has written three cookbooks. Torode and Faulkner live together in north London.\n\nTorode's co-presenter on two of the MasterChef shows, Gregg Wallace, recently married for the fourth time, with Torode by his side as his best man.\n\nWallace is married to Anne-Marie Sterpini, who he met on Twitter and is 21 years his junior.\n\nDespite Torode being Wallace's best man at the wedding in 2015, the pair caused controversy last year when Torode claimed they weren't friends and had never been close.\n\nIt allegedly led to a \"dressing-down\" by the BBC, and Wallace saying they may not meet up regularly outside of work but that they work closely together for seven months of the year on MasterChef and Celebrity MasterChef."
