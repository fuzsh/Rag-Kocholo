After waiting to tell our family when we got home we then had a few days just grinning at each other!! Im so very happy to share our lovely news with you. Happy 2019 it’s going to be quite a year and I’m going to embrace every minute of it. All you need is love. Love is all you need.''\n\nTheir followers were delighted with the news and took to the comments to post their well wishes.\n\nOne said, ''Wonderful news!!!! Huge congratulations to you both. Wishing you a continued wonderful and happy life together.''\n\nWhile another wrote, ''OMG, amazing news & about time!! Congratulations to a wonderful couple.''\n\nAustralian-born John separated at the end of 2011 from his second wife of four years, Jessica.\n\nThey have a son Jonah and a daughter Lulu. He also has Marselle and Casper from a previous relationship.\n\nLisa divorced her husband Chris Coghill in 2012, who she has an adopted daughter with, Billie.\n\nHuge congratulations to them both."
