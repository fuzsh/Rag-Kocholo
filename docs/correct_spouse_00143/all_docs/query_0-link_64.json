        "text": "The past 12 months have tasted undeniably sweet for actor and cook Lisa Faulkner. She has written and produced a new cook book, From Mother to Mother, moved home with her partner, Masterchef judge and chef John Torode, in north London, and landed an exciting role as businesswoman Fi Browning in EastEnders.\n\nBut as her book, published last week, explores, there has been a tart undercurrent, too. When she turned 44 in February 2016, Faulkner had reached the age her own mother Julie was when she died of throat cancer.\n\n“I spent my life convinced I would never get to 44 so that birthday was a massive deal,” she says today, sipping tea in the cool surroundings of the British Film Institute cafe. “I don’t think I knew exactly what would happen – maybe I would spontaneously combust or something.”\n\nJulie had died in December 1987, just two months after her 44th birthday, when Lisa was 16. “When I got past April last year, it felt a relief but weird too. I kept thinking, ‘Now I’m older than she ever was.’\n\nAlthough the cancer was not genetic, Faulkner is vigilant about her health. “I watch what I do. I check myself regularly. It doesn’t stop you worrying. But that seems to have slowed down in the past year.”\n\nPeaches-and-cream pretty, Faulkner has watchful, darker eyes. She is a mass of contradictions, filled with the desire to live in the moment - “I’m an every-day-is-brilliant-even-if -it’s-raining person” – mixed with a reverence for the past.\n\n“My mother is still such a massive part of my life. I can’t help but talk about her like she is here. She was a real force and I am so influenced by my memories and what she gave me.”\n\nIndeed, Faulkner’s first cookbook was inspired by Julie, a legal secretary. Recipes from my Mother for my Daughter was a number one bestseller and was written after winning Celebrity Masterchef in 2010, after which she slogged at London restaurants Smiths of Smithfield and Roux at Parliament Square, honing her skills. The career move towards cooking took her away from a solid body of acting work that began nearly 25 years ago, including turns in Brookside, Spooks and Holby City.\n\nFaulkner is a mother herself now, too. In 2008, she and her then-husband actor Chris Coghill adopted 15-month-old Billie after a fruitless struggle to conceive via IVF.\n\n“I was devastated; I was convinced I would never be a mother. When Chris first suggested adoption, I still felt I had to ‘grow’ a baby. But as soon as I let go of that idea, it was like the sun came out.”\n\n“Maybe you are better equipped because of what you know.”\n\nShe has always been candid with Billie, who is now 10. “I told her ‘For a long time, I wanted to be a mummy, and my heart felt broken. But now I am really pleased all that happened, because if it hadn’t I would never have had you. And you are everything.’ ”\n\nShe says with some feeling: “I’ve been given the most amazing gift in the whole world – it’s hard but you have to be resourceful. I’m teaching her to be kind; it’s one of the biggest lessons you can learn.”\n\nWith that in mind, she admits to watching her daughter texting or dabbling on social media like a hawk.\n\n“I see everything she does, and I tell her that sometimes things get written down and sound mean that wouldn’t otherwise. I say, ‘If someone is being mean, be kind back. They are who you have to feel sorry for, there is something in their life to be sad about.’”\n\nHaving built her family in such a painstaking way, splitting up with Coghill in 2012 must have been especially tough. In the past, she has suggested that the strain of undergoing IVF may have contributed; now she says they just “grew apart”, adding, “We co-parent 100 per cent and Chris lives near to us. Divorce was our issue not [Billie’s].”\n\nThere’s no doubt this is a time she would love to have a mother to talk to, as “it’s great to have a network of people around you to ask advice.” For Faulkner, that coterie includes her younger sister Victoria, 43, and showbiz pals including Angela Griffin, Amanda Redman and Fern Britton.\n\nSome have contributed recipes or at least ideas for recipes to Faulkner’s new book - so we can all taste Denise Van Outen’s carrot cake, Myleene Klass’s Quick Banana Pudding and Angela’s Tortilla Chip Soup.\n\nWhen it comes to her own home cooking, she says “it’s pretty chilled – there’s no competition” between her and John, who she met while filming Celebrity Masterchef. “I barely spoke four words to [him],” she recalls. “He and Gregg Wallace are terrifying.\n\n“But we became friends gradually, and two and a half years later, he called and asked me out. I found out he was funny and bright, this gorgeous man who could cook too.\n\n“His first meal for me was a clam dish. He jokes that he never got to share it because I was starving and it was all so exciting that I devoured it before he sat down.”\n\nWhat has she learned from Torode in the kitchen? “Never apologise for your food – just serve it. No one knows what it is supposed to look or taste like.”\n\nCooking has replaced acting as her primary passion in recent years, “but going back on set was like putting Ugg boots on. You relax. You feel, I know how to do this. It made me fall in love with acting all over again.”\n\nFaulkner is sworn to secrecy about her new residence in Albert Square. “It reminds me of Masterchef. I had to keep my win secret for six months - I was so guarded my Dad assumed I hadn’t won and didn’t even bother to record the final show.”\n\nSoaps are famously grueling work but Faulkner is well versed when it comes to hard graft. “Once you’ve gone into a kitchen at 7am when it’s still dark, and you drag stock pots around, and by the time you go home, you haven’t seen any life… It’s not too different.”\n\nShe has no designs on slowing down for now, but a later life idyll does drift into view from time to time.\n\n“I would like to have more best-selling cookery books; perhaps some sort of recognition for my acting,” she muses. “Billie turning up with all her children, dumping them on my lap. And for John and I to be as happy as we are. Living in France, south of Provence – two doddering cooks, chatting about the olden days, him still slapping my bum, and making me clams.”"
