        "text": "The former EastEnders star, 47, has a 13-year-old daughter Billie, who she adopted with her ex-husband Chris Coghill.\n\nShe told The Times magazine: “I am really happy that I am infertile because I wouldn’t have got Billie without it. I think I love her more because she is not my birth child. It is ferocious and it comes from here (my heart).”\n\n“But I don’t think that yearning to be pregnant will ever completely go until I hit the menopause and I can’t physically have children any more.”\n\nFaulkner is engaged to MasterChef judge and chef John Torode.\n\nThe pair met when she was a contestant on – and won – Celebrity MasterChef in 2010.\n\nShe said: “We have a really lovely time. He looks after me and I look after him. It’s nice to have a second chance, because sometimes (after a divorce) you think, ‘Maybe that’s it.’ I do see this as a second chance.”\n\nTorode and Faulkner, who has written a memoir called Meant To Be, present John And Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen on ITV."
