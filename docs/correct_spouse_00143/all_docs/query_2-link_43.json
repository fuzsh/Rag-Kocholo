Her hair could do with a jolly good brushing and a tidy up.[/QUOTE]\n\nDon't you dare criticise the wonderful, absolutely stunning Lisa Faulkner. I would watch the programme even if I was blind just to hear her voice - wonderful! :D\n\n0\n\nI see this has been put on at a prime time slot as it use to be on in the mornings. Ratings must be up\n\n0\n\nIs this the actress Lisa Faulkner,with\n\nthe whiny nasal voice?????\n\nShe was rubbish back in Brookside and\n\nlater on in Holby City too.At least she is\n\nconsistent,I will say that for her!\n\n0\n\nLisa Faulkner is lovely, has a great voice and is a brilliant cook (celebrity masterchef champion). What more could you want? She's also married with 2.4 children.\n\nShe was married to actor Chris Coghill with whom she has an adopted daughter, they have now separated. She is currently supposed to be seeing Masterchef's John Torode!\n\n0"
