        "text": "LISA FAULKNER is still beaming about her wedding last month to Manchester actor Chris Coghill \"Everyone says it should be the best day of your life and it really, really was. It was a wonderful day - I wanted it to go on for a week,\" says the former Holby City star.\n\n\"We had every type of weather for the day - rain, sun and even light snow during the speeches. I wore a proper big dress and now I can't wait for it to come back from the dry cleaners so that I can try it on again.\"\n\nLisa and Prestwich-born Shameless star Chris met when they starred together in BBC TV's Manchester filmed and set Burn It. Their characters - Carl and nurse Emma - were drawn together on screen and off.\n\nThe couple honeymooned in Malaysia, staying in an idyllic beachfront location on the edge of a rainforest.\n\n\"We did absolutely nothing except lie on the beach and read . . . oh, and the odd bit of island hopping. But it's back to normal now.\"\n\nTheir wedding, at Richmond Park in Surrey, featured champagne and bangers and mash. Guests included Coronation Street actor Antony Cotton and Manchester-born Caroline Catz, who co-stars with Lisa in a new series of\n\nMurder In Suburbia\n\n(ITV1, Saturday, 9.15pm).\n\n\"Caroline and I have known each other a year now. We are more relaxed and get on brilliantly, which reflects in the way our characters interact. I think on a Saturday night people just want to chill out, watch a whodunit with big, vibrant characters and a nice little twist at the end.\"\n\nLisa and Caroline return as police detectives Emma Scribbins and Kate Ashurst, probing more murders in the suburbs of Middleford. \"Ash and Scribbs have a laugh solving their crimes. They are funny, sassy and intelligent, wear nice clothes and they solve a murder every week in under an hour.\"\n\nThis second series sees them called in to discover why a teenage witch was stabbed to death, who electrocuted a wedding guest in the fish pond and which of many possible suspects killed an unpopular estate agent.\n\nOther stories involve fatal salsa moves, obsessive dog lovers and the grey sexual revolution.\n\n\"Caroline and I did a bath scene, which was hilarious. We had to reconstruct a murder that took place in an old people's home and it involved Caroline pretending to drown me by pushing me under the water by pulling my legs from under me.\n\n\"I could hold my nose, and I don't mind going under water, but the soap they used to create all the bubbles made my eyes really sore and we just kept getting the giggles.\n\n\"My little legs were sticking out of the tub in the middle of the studio but I had shorts and a vest on, so I think everyone else was much more embarrassed than me. The crew kept giving me sweets to keep me going.\"\n\nSeen earlier this week guesting in New Tricks, Lisa has form when it comes to TV deaths.\n\nViewers flooded the BBC with complaints when her Spooks character - MI5 trainee Helen Flynn - met her end in a deep fat fryer.\n\nOff screen, she hasn't always been lucky in love, enduring a painful split from one-time fiancé Jonny Lee Miller, before love blossomed after meeting Chris on Burn It.\n\nThere's not much romance for \"Scribbs\" in the six-part series, so Lisa had to find diversions elsewhere.\n\n\"We filmed in a converted monastery, which had this vast maze of rooms in the foundations,\" recalls co-star Caroline.\n\n\"It would have been really easy to get lost down there and Lisa insisted on exploring them. I was the real coward. It was claustrophobic and I was petrified that rats would start appearing out of the darkness.\n\n\"We also decided to explore the graveyard that we filmed in late at night.\n\n\"Lisa and I were shining our torches nervously at various gravestones when there was this almighty crash behind us.\n\n\"We leapt out of our skins, convinced some vengeful ghost was seeking revenge. But, of course, it was just some local kids larking about.\n\n\"We certainly succeeded in scaring ourselves silly.\""
