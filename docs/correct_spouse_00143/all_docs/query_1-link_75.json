        "text": "TV star and celeb chef John Torode is once again taking the reins in the nation's favourite cooking competition, MasterChef.\n\nHis squabbles over food with fellow chef and co-host Gregg Wallace will resume tonight (Monday, March 1) at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nTorode is a veteran in 'grilling' amateur cooks in both the British and Australian versions of the show, as well as in spin-offs such as Celebrity MasterChef and Junior MasterChef.\n\nNot only did the Australian's career begin in the TV kitchen, but it's also where his love life blossomed.\n\nWho is John Torode?\n\nJohn, 54, was born in Melbourne and was taught how to cook by his grandmother. He still loves roast chicken to this day, as it reminds him of his childhood.\n\nHe left school at 16 to attend catering college, and that was the beginning of his long-term tenure as a virtuoso chef.\n\nSign up to the HertsLive newsletter below for the latest news straight to your inbox:\n\nHe moved to the UK in 1991 and he then got to work at Port de La Tour and Quaglino's, becoming an ambassador of Australasian cuisine in the country. Quaglino's Sir Terence Conran described him as a \"genius\" and during his time there his fated meeting with fellow MasterChef judge Gregg Wallace happened. Gregg was then running a vegetable supply company.\n\nHe became Head Chef for the launch of Mezzo in Soho, before opening the four-floor bar and restaurant Smiths of Smithfield in 2000, which became a smash hit. It was followed by another sensation, The Luxe, which opened at Spitalfields Market in 2009.\n\nIt was in between these years, in 2005, when the BBC television show MasterChef was relaunched with Torode and Wallace replacing former host Gary Rhodes.\n\nJohn later set off for a series of culinary road trips, first going back to his roots in 2014 with John Torode's Australia. He then explored vibrant food cultures in Malaysia, Korea, Argentina and elsewhere, meeting local chefs and visiting night markets in cities, coasts and mountains\n\nIt was in the Celebrity version of MasterChef where he met his current wife Lisa Faulkner. The couple now also host John And Lisa's Weekend Kitchen on Sunday mornings on ITV.\n\nRelationships and children\n\nJohn was married to Jessica Torode in 2000 and the pair had two children together, Jonah and Lulu. He also had two other children, Marcel and Casper, from previous relationships. The couple separated in 2011 and divorced in 2014.\n\nHe first met Lisa in Celebrity MasterChef. Lisa, who appeared on shows like EastEnders, Brookside and Holby City, won both the competition and John's heart.\n\nAt the time of the show being filmed, Lisa was married to Eastenders actor Chris Coghill, with whom she had an adopted daughter, Billie. The pair divorced in April 2012 and six months later Lisa and John went public with her relationship.\n\nJohn had asked Lisa to marry him on Christmas Day 2018, and the couple married at Aynhoe Park in Oxfordshire in front of family and friends. Their wedding celebrations were held over two days.\n\nThe couple now share family life in a pretty London home with a cute kitchen and garden."
