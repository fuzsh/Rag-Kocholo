        "text": "John Torode is back alongside his co-star Gregg Wallace to judge the skills of amateur cooks as they compete for the win on BBC’s MasterChef. However, Gregg isn’t John’s only TV partner, as the chef has also successfully mixed business with his personal life to front ITV cooking shows with his wife Lisa Faulkner.\n\nUnfortunately, being under the spotlight has left the couple, who tied the knot in 2019, facing some scrutiny over how they interact with one another during episodes of John and Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen. In a recently unearthed interview, John addressed the criticism he and Lisa face for their on-screen banter.\n\nBack in 2021 John shared his secrets to a happy marriage in an interview with The Guardian. The Australian-British celebrity chef insisted he is never offended when Lisa, who rose to fame as an actress, “takes the mickey out of [his] accent”.\n\nHe also defended his playful “prodding” of his other half while they cook together on the show. He told the publication: “We chat incessantly, my wife Lisa [Faulkner] and I.\n\n“I’ve never chatted to somebody so much in all my life. It’s really weird. What’s the secret to a happy relationship? Respect. Give and take.\n\n“Allowing each person to breathe and have their say. People say: ‘She takes the mickey out of your accent and you prod her…’ That’s our relationship, it’s a good one.”\n\nJohn and Lisa first met due to MasterChef, when the former Brookside star competed in the celebrity spin-off rendition of the series in 2010.\n\nThey were both in other relationships at the time, and formed a friendship as Lisa served up her dishes for John to judge.\n\nLisa was previously married to Chris Coghill, who played Tony King in EastEnders. The couple share an adopted daughter together named Billie.\n\nMeanwhile, John was married to a woman named Jessica, with whom he shares two children, a son and a daughter. The former couple separated in 2011.\n\nOnce they were both single a few years down the line, John, 58, asked Lisa, 52, out on a date, during which they discovered their famous spark.\n\nReflecting on the beginning of their love story, Lisa told the Daily Mail in 2013 that everything changed after John wrote her a letter and asked her out to dinner.\n\n\"John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until...\" she said. \"I don't know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date.\n\n“We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different. I'm really, really happy. John and I are having such a nice time but we're taking things slowly. There are lots of other people to consider.\""
