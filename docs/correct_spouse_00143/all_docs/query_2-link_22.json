        "text": "John Torode has had an eventful love life, from getting a quickie divorce to marrying a MasterChef co-star.\n\nHe is best known for being the straight-talking judge on MasterChef, but the Australian-British chef also has another cooking show with his wife, television star Lisa Faulkner, called John and Lisa's Weekend Kitchen. The pair met while she was a contestant on Celebrity MasterChef and formed a friendship before falling in love.\n\nBoth John, 58, and Lisa, 51, have been married before, with Lisa previously married to Chris Coghill, who played Tony King in EastEnders. The couple adopted a daughter together named Billie. Meanwhile, John tied the knot with a woman named Jessica in 2000, and they went on to have two children together, a son and a daughter.\n\nJohn and Jessica separated in 2011 but they didn't initially divorce until 2014, when their union was reportedly dissolved in a matter of seconds at the High Court. In 2010, John met Lisa when she was a contestant on the show and they hit it off immediately, remaining friends after filming. But with both of them in other relationships, Lisa insists there was nothing romantic between them at first.\n\n\"He was a judge on a show I loved and I was petrified of him. He was brilliant and gave us all tips so you didn't want to let him down,\" she previously said. \"All I could think was, 'That sauce hasn't worked'. I didn't see anything but food for three months. After I won, we did The Good Food Show and stuff. John and I always got on, but I never thought about me and him.\"\n\nRevealing how they eventually got together, Lisa told the Daily Mail in 2013 that everything changed after John wrote her a letter and asked her out to dinner. \"John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until...\" she said. \"I don't know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date. We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different. I'm really, really happy. John and I are having such a nice time but we're taking things slowly. There are lots of other people to consider.\"\n\nJohn has since confessed that his letter for Lisa was \"cowardly\" but it meant that there would be no awkwardness for him if she didn't want to date him. He told the Daily Mail: \"I'd separated from my wife [Jessica] which was awful, and I was reluctant to approach Lisa face to face as I didn't fancy the prospect of her saying no, so I wrote her a letter. If I'd got no response, it wouldn't matter. Cowardly? S***, yeah. I'm as cowardly as they get.\"\n\nBut things worked out in his favour and they began dating. The couple tied the knot in October 2019 and previously shared the secret to a happy marriage, insisting that it is a properly made bed. Asked what makes their marriage work, John, 57, said: \"A really well-made bed. You spend lots of time in it! Honestly, the bedroom â€“ having that sanctuary of a place to go to, I think that's really important. And nice towels... Looking after yourself is as important as looking after each other.\""
