        "text": "Celebrity chef John Torode may be a whizz in the kitchen but when it comes to matters of the heart, he's less assured.\n\nHis wife Lisa Faulkner entered his life thanks to MasterChef, where she was a contestant on the celebrity version in 2010. At that time, both were involved with other people and their relationship was purely friendly.\n\nHowever, when they found themselves single a few years later, John mustered up the courage to ask Lisa out via a letter. He later confessed that his approach was somewhat 'cowardly', but it worked - the couple got hitched in 2019.\n\nBoth John, aged 58, and Lisa, aged 52, have been married before. Lisa, an actress, was previously married to Chris Coghill, known for his role as Tony King in EastEnders, and together they adopted a daughter named Billie.\n\nOn the other hand, John was married to a woman named Jessica in 2000, with whom he had two children, a son and a daughter. John and Jessica parted ways in 2011 but didn't officially divorce until 2014, when their marriage was reportedly dissolved within seconds at the High Court, reports the Mirror.\n\nIn 2010, John crossed paths with Lisa as she competed on the show and the two clicked right away, maintaining their friendship post-production. Lisa reminisced: \"He was a judge on a show I loved and I was petrified of him. He was brilliant and gave us all tips so you didn't want to let him down,\" Lisa previously shared.\n\n\"All I could think was, 'That sauce hasn't worked'. I didn't see anything but food for three months. After I won, we did The Good Food Show and stuff. John and I always got on, but I never thought about me and him.\"\n\nUnveiling the story of their eventual romance, Lisa shared with the Daily Mail in 2013 that everything took a turn when John penned her a letter and suggested they go out for dinner. \"John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until...\" she explained.\n\n\"I don't know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date. We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different. I'm really, really happy. John and I are having such a nice time but we're taking things slowly. There are lots of other people to consider.\"\n\nOn his part, John openly admitted that his letter to Lisa was a bit \"cowardly\" but ensured he wouldn't face any discomfort if she rejected him. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he confessed: \"I'd separated from my wife [Jessica] which was awful, and I was reluctant to approach Lisa face to face as I didn't fancy the prospect of her saying no, so I wrote her a letter. If I'd got no response, it wouldn't matter. Cowardly? S***, yeah. I'm as cowardly as they get.\"\n\nDespite the circumstances, things fell into place for them and they eventually started a romantic relationship, which ultimately led to marriage. Previously, John revealed their formula for a contented marriage it's as simple as a well-made bed.\n\nWhen quizzed about their marital success, he said: \"A really well-made bed. You spend lots of time in it! Honestly, the bedroom - having that sanctuary of a place to go to, I think that's really important. And nice towels... Looking after yourself is as important as looking after each other.\""
