        "text": "Celebrity chefs John Torode and Lisa Faulkner have shared their 'exciting news' with fans in a joint statement. The couple, who tied the knot five years ago, took to social media on Friday to announce the launch of their first cookbook together.\n\nIn a charming video posted on Lisa's Instagram story, the pair are seen walking through a forest, teasing \"very exciting news\" they're keen to divulge to their followers. An elated Lisa teased: \"We can't wait to share it, so I think, in the next hour or so it will be up on our stories.\"\n\nShortly after, true to their promise, John and Lisa revealed the cover of their new cookbook. The front of 'John and Lisa's Kitchen' features the two sharing a joyful moment in their kitchen.\n\nRead more: A Place In The Sun's Laura Hamilton addresses pregnancy speculation as fans left confused\n\nRead more: BBC Saturday Kitchen viewers say same thing about A-lister's debut after flashing chest\n\n\"We're so excited to be sharing our first book together with you all\" Lisa said in an Instagram story slide. She also offered a glimpse behind the scenes of the cover's creation, which included a photoshoot at their luxurious London home.\n\nThe eagerly anticipated book is scheduled for release on September 12 and is now available for pre-order at £19.99 from leading retailers such as Amazon and Waterstones, reports Birmingham Live.\n\nThis is the first time the couple have collaborated on a project, following their individual culinary publications, marking another significant step in their relationship. Both stars of the MasterChef series, they initially met on the Celebrity Masterchef set in 2010, where Lisa emerged as the winner.\n\nHowever, it took five years for their romance to develop, as they were both married to other people at the time. John popped the question to Lisa with an extravagant festive proposal, complete with a stunning diamond ring. In 2019, after four years together, they tied the knot at the scenic Aynhoe Park in Oxfordshire.\n\nBoth John and Lisa bring children from previous relationships into their blended family. John is a proud father to four children, while Lisa adopted a daughter born in 2006 with her ex-husband and 'Burn It' co-star Chris Coghill, before their split in 2011."
