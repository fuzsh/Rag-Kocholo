        "text": "John Torode is perhaps best known for his role as a MasterChef co-host alongside Aldington's Gregg Wallace.\n\nThe chef was born in Australia in 1965, but has since become one of the pioneers when it comes to introducing Australasian food to the UK.\n\nHis cooking journey really began to take off in 1992 when he joined the Conran Group.\n\nREAD MORE: The Tunbridge Wells restaurant MasterChef judge Gregg Wallace rates wasn't what I expected\n\nJohn began at Pont de La Tour before becoming a Sous Chef at Quaglino's. However, when Mezzo launched in Soho in 1995, he was recruited as Head Chef.\n\nWhen it comes to his relationship with former EastEnders star Lisa Faulkner, the pair have quite a unique story.\n\nJohn and Lisa first crossed eyes during Celebrity MasterChef in 2010 when Lisa was a contestant, however they were each married to other partners.\n\nJohn had two children with his wife Jessica, while Lisa had married EastEnders actor Chris Coghill, and the pair share an adopted daughter.\n\nLisa split with her then-husband Chris in 2011, while John later parted ways with Jessica in 2014.\n\nHe then got in touch with the former Celebrity MasterChef contestant and asked her out on a date.\n\nIn an interview with the Radio Times, Lisa said: \"I was surprised.\n\n\"I knew we’d had a couple of nice times where we met, chatted, had fun and talked a lot.\n\n\"So we were friends, and it didn’t come out of the blue, but I thought it was a very gentlemanly thing to do, a letter.”\n\nLike many couples in the country, periods of being isolated together during lockdown has brought people closer together.\n\nIn an interview on Good Morning Britain during the lockdown, Lisa added: \"We've done alright.\n\n\"I think there have been times where John says I’m going for a walk, or I say I’m going for a walk or the kids say they’re going for a walk.\n\n“We give each other space. Home-schooling is hard. But we’ve been pretty good together.”\n\nJohn also gave an insight into the strength of the pair's relationship, and even described Lisa as his \"rock\".\n\n“I said to Lisa, I wouldn’t have got through this whole lockdown thing without her,\" he added.\n\n\"She’s been my absolutely rock.\n\n“We’re great mates, we do alright together, we love food together, we cook well, it’s been okay.”\n\nAside from his spell in front of the cameras as MasterChef host, John has had a cooking series on ITV since 2019 with Lisa, named 'John and Lisa's Weekend Kitchen'."
