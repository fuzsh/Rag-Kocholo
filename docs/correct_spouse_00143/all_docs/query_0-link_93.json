        "text": "Former EastEnders actress Lisa Faulkner and MasterChef judge John Torode’s wedding was this week, as the couple tied the knot in front of a star-studded audience in Banbury on October 24.\n\nLisa couldn’t contain her excitement ahead of her nuptials, posting a smiling snap on her Instagram stories with the words: ‘Good Morning! Very exciting day today’ on the morning of her wedding day.\n\nBut how long have John Torode and Lisa Faulkner been together and how did they meet?\n\nHow long have John Torode and Lisa Faulkner been together?\n\nLisa, who played Fi Browning in EastEnders in 2017 and also had roles in Holby City and Spooks, first met John when she competed in Celebrity MasterChef in 2010.\n\nLisa won the series but she and John didn’t start dating until October 2012 because while she appeared on the series both Lisa and John were married at the time.\n\nLisa and her ex-husband Chris Coghill split in 2011. The pair share an adopted daughter named Billie, who is 13.\n\nMeanwhile, John separated from wife Jessica in 2011 and their divorce was confirmed in 2014.\n\nThe Australian chef is a father to Lulu and Jonah with Jessica, and has two other children, Casper and Marselle, from a previous relationship.\n\nLisa and John dated for six and a half years before getting engaged at the end of last year.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BsVBTRPgSz0/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\nJohn, 53, popped the question to Lisa, 47, in Goa on Christmas Day in 2018 and while the answer was obvious for Lisa, John revealed in an interview with Good Morning Britain that she was so surprised by the proposal, she forgot to say yes: ‘she didn’t yes for three and a half hours because she was so gobsmacked,’ John revealed.\n\n‘I remember saying to her, “Are you going to say yes?” and she went, “Have I not said yes?” I went, “No you have not said yes yet”.’\n\nThe couple have recently launched a new cookery show together earlier this year called John and Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen.\n\nTalking to Metro.co.uk back in June they said that both living together and working together hasn’t caused them any issues\n\n‘We forget we’re on camera until we then have to do a link at the end of cooking! I think that’s the highlight. We’re just chatting and cooking and having a lovely time,’ Lisa said.\n\n‘It’s nice to be working with someone you like quite a lot,’ John added.\n\nTheir wedding, in October 2019, will mark seven years since they first started dating.\n\nJohn Torode and Lisa Faulkner’s wedding\n\nJohn Torode and Lisa Faulkner got married at Aynhoe Park, a Grade I listed 17th-century country house and wedding venue in Banbury.\n\nCelebrity guests included Coronation Street star Charlie Condou, Tamzin Outhwaite and John’s MasterChef co-star Gregg Wallace as well as Amanda Holden, who attended the wedding with a cast on following an accident on holiday this week that left her with a broken leg.\n\nOfficial pictures from the wedding are yet to be released but some snaps on social media show guests enjoying oysters and Espresso Martinis in rooms decorated with gold balloons.\n\nMORE : Lisa Faulkner gives glimpse into John Torode wedding as she teases ‘exciting day’"
