        "text": "That year, the busy pair also launched their own ITV series, John And Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen, and Lisa published her book, Meant To Be: My Journey To Motherhood, in which she revealed the struggles with infertility and IVF that led to her adopting her daughter Billie with her ex-husband Chris Coghill.\n\nThen, Covid hit in early 2020 and, like everyone, life slowed down dramatically for Lisa. Here, the actress and presenter, 49, reflects on the challenges of the past year, married life and her greatest achievements.\n\nHow has the past year been for you, Lisa?\n\nIt’s been intense, although I tend to look back with rose-tinted glasses and go, “I had time to clean my drawers and cook a recipe every day and spend time with my family.” I did enjoy having a year extra with our children that we possibly wouldn’t have had. They’re growing up so fast, so having them at home with us was lovely. I think we all got to know each other better and learnt to be patient with each other, which is an amazing thing.\n\nBillie is a teenager now. Is that tricky?\n\nShe’s actually a super teenager. She spends a lot of time in her room, on her phone, watching Netflix and hanging out with her mates, but I feel so lucky. She’s incredible."
