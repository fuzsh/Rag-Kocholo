        "text": "John Torode and Lisa Faulkner, the culinary power couple who've been married for five years, have just dropped some news that's got fans excited.\n\nThe lovebirds took to Instagram with a heartwarming video, where they teased their fans with \"very exciting news\" while enjoying a romantic woodland walk.\n\nLisa's Instagram story was abuzz with anticipation as the pair promised to reveal their surprise within the next hour. True to their word, not long after, they unveiled the cover of their very first cookbook together, aptly named 'John and Lisa's Kitchen'.\n\nThe cover is a snapshot of domestic bliss, showing John and Lisa sharing a joyful moment in their kitchen. Lisa's excitement was palpable as she shared on her story, \"We're so excited to be sharing our first book together with you all\".\n\nThe MasterChef duo even gave followers a sneak peek into the making of the cover, which featured a photoshoot at their chic London home.\n\nLisa and John each have their own successful solo cookbooks, but this is the first time they'll be blending their kitchen prowess in a much-anticipated collaboration in a testament to their strong partnership, reports the Mirror.\n\nTheir romance is one for the storybooks, beginning when Lisa triumphed on Celebrity Masterchef in 2010, where John was a judge. It took half a decade for sparks to fly romantically, as both were entangled in other marriages at the time.\n\nJohn's grand gesture came in the form of a Christmas proposal, complete with a stunning diamond ring. In 2019, after four years together, they exchanged vows at the picturesque Aynhoe Park in Oxfordshire.\n\nFamily life is a big part of their blend, with John being a proud dad to four children from previous relationships. Lisa has also embraced motherhood; she adopted a daughter in 2006 with her former husband and actor Chris Coghill, whom she divorced in 2011.\n\nWhile they don't have any children together, John and Lisa's shared passion for food has brought them closer. They've proven their teamwork skills on their cooking show, John and Lisa's Weekend Kitchen, which airs every Saturday on ITV.\n\nThe series has been a hit since they tied the knot, with a ninth season already hinted at by ITV Studios for autumn 2024."
