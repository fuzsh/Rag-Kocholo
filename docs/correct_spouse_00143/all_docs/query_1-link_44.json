        "text": "Carla Bonner who play's Steph Scully in Neighbours, her son played a character who left I think around the time she returned\n\nCarla's son, Harley, played Josh Willis.\n\nJason Donavan was, as we all know, Neighbours' Scott Robinson. Jason's father, Terrence Donavan, played Doug Willis and Stephanie McIntosh who played Sky Mangel is Jason's half-sister on his mother's side.\n\nThe girl who played Shenice in EE, Lily Turner, is the younger sister of Lacey Turner aka Stacey Fowler. Another of Lacey's sisters, Daisy Turner, played one of Silas's victims in HO - Jenny/Rebecca (the girl he met on the dating site).\n\nMickey and Demi Miller were onscreen siblings played by real life siblings Joe and Shana Swash. Joe's newborn son also played the newborn Summer Swann. Summer's mother Dawn was played by Kara Tointon, her sister Hannah Tointon was Katy Fox in HO.\n\nJill Halfpenny, EE's Kate Mitchell, is the aunt of Chelsea Halfpenny, ED's Amy Wyatt and Casualty's Alisha.\n\nCorrie's Jason Grimshaw was played by Ryan Thomas. His brother Adam plays Adam Barton on ED. Ryan also shares a daughter with Tina O'Brien.\n\nHO's half-brothers Tony Hutchinson and Dom Riley were played by real-life brothers Nick and John Pickard.\n\nDebbie Rush plays Anna Windass in Corrie, her daughter played Kyle Slater's friend Poppy in EE and her son , Will Rush, was Josh in Waterloo Road.\n\nKarl Howman, EE's Buster Briggs, is the father of Chloe Howman who played Rita in Casualty.\n\nBrookie's Jackie Corkhill was played by Sue Jenkins, her son is Richard Fleeshman who played Corrie's Craig Harris.\n\nIf you take marriages/relationships into account there are probably loads more - for example Claire King (Corrie's Erica and ED's Kim Tate) was married to Peter Amory (ED's Chris Tate), until he left her for Samantha Giles (ED's Bernice)!\n\n4"
