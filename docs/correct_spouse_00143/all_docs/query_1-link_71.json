        "text": "Lisa Faulkner has revealed she feels ‘blessed’ to be marrying John Torode after the Masterchef presenter surprised her with a romantic proposal on Christmas Day.\n\nThey’re couple goals.\n\nThe former EastEnders actress surprised fans when she posted an adorable snap of the pair of them, flashing her shiny new engagement ring.\n\n‘My gorgeous John completely surprised me on Christmas Day and asked me to marry him!’ she wrote.\n\n‘After waiting to tell our family when we got home we then had a few days just grinning at each other!! Im so very happy to share our lovely news with you.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BsVBTRPgSz0/\n\n‘Happy 2019 it’s going to be quite a year and I’m going to embrace every minute of it. All you need is love. Love is all you need.’\n\nThe pair shared the good news with their families a few days after Christmas Day, as the actress told the Mirror: ‘We were away so we had our big family Christmas a few days later.\n\n‘We have a blended family with different children from different families so all our families come together.’\n\nPreviously being married to Eastenders actor Chris Coghill for six years, Lisa mentioned that she’s ‘blessed I’ve got a second chance with a lovely man.’\n\nThe 46-year-old and and her 53-year-old fiancé have been together for six years after meeting on Celebrity Masterchef in 2010, in a series Lisa won.\n\nThe Spooks actress went on to work in John’s restaurant Smiths of Smithfield – however, she maintains that she had no feelings for Torode while on MasterChef; both were married with children at the time.\n\nLisa previously told the Daily Mail: ‘It never crossed my mind. John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until…\n\n‘I don’t know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date. We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different.’\n\nMORE : MasterChef couple Lisa Faulkner and John Torode are engaged after six years together"
