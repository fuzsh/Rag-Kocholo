        "text": "Since meeting on MasterChef in 2010, John Torode and wife Lisa Faulkner have become one of the best known couples on TV.\n\nJohn, is best known for his straight talking on the BBC cooking programme - but he’s also gained a few fans from his joint show with former Brookside star Lisa.\n\nThe pair, who host ITV's John and Lisa's Weekend Kitchen, met while the actress was appearing on Celebrity MasterChef more than a decade ago and became firm friends before romance blossomed.\n\nJohn, 58, had been married before to Jessica, the mother of his two children. Lisa was married previously to EastEnders star Chris Coghill, who played Tony King in the BBC soap, and she shares adopted daughter Billie with him. John and Jessica had split in 2011 and divorced in 2014.\n\nThe Mirror reports that the union was eventually dissolved in seconds at the High Court. Lisa has always insisted that the pair were just good friends before they split with their respective other halves.\n\n“He was a judge on a show I loved and I was petrified of him. He was brilliant and gave us all tips so you didn't want to let him down,\" she previously said. \"All I could think was, 'That sauce hasn't worked'. I didn't see anything but food for three months. After I won, we did The Good Food Show and stuff. John and I always got on, but I never thought about me and him.\"\n\nLisa told the Daily Mail in 2013 that she felt a change in their relationship when John wrote her a letter and asked her to go for dinner. She said: \"John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until...\".\n\n\"I don't know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date. We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different. I'm really, really happy. John and I are having such a nice time but we're taking things slowly. There are lots of other people to consider.\"\n\nJohn, also speaking to the Daily Mail, has since opened up that it was “cowardly” to send a letter, but he was keen to avoid any awkwardness if Lisa wasn’t interested. He said: \"I'd separated from my wife [Jessica] which was awful, and I was reluctant to approach Lisa face to face as I didn't fancy the prospect of her saying no, so I wrote her a letter. If I'd got no response, it wouldn't matter. Cowardly? S***, yeah. I'm as cowardly as they get.\"\n\nThe couple were married in October 2019 and John has since opened up about what he things makes a marriage work.\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nHe said: \"A really well-made bed. You spend lots of time in it! Honestly, the bedroom – having that sanctuary of a place to go to, I think that's really important. And nice towels... Looking after yourself is as important as looking after each other.\"\n\nLisa also suggested that it helps that they “really like and fancy each other!”.\n\nRecently, she shared how “proud” she was of her husband after he was awarded an MBE in February.\n\nShe told OK Magazine. \"It's an amazing achievement and the fact he got to meet Prince William! Out of everybody in the royal family, that's who I'd have liked to have met!\""
