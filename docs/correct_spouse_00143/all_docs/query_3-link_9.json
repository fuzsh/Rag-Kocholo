        "text": "John Torode and wife Lisa Faulkner are one of the most loved-up couples on television but the husband and wife culinary duo's romance wasn't smooth sailing. John has admitted that he used a \"cowardly\" method to kick-start their love.\n\nIt is well known that the couple met when Lisa was a contestant on Celebrity MasterChef in 2010. However, it wasn't love at first sight as they were both in other relationships, so they just became friends.\n\nHowever 58-year-old Australian John realised that he wanted more than just a platonic relationship after his marriage broke down but he wasn't sure how to approach 52-year-old Lisa without it feeling awkward. Anxious that she would reject him he decided to use an age-old method of communication to tell her how he felt.\n\n\"I'd separated from my wife [Jessica] which was awful, and I was reluctant to approach Lisa face to face as I didn't fancy the prospect of her saying no, so I wrote her a letter. If I'd got no response, it wouldn't matter. Cowardly? S***, yeah. I'm as cowardly as they get,\" he revealed to the Daily Mail.\n\nHis nerves were probably well placed as Lisa revealed she was \"petrified\" of him in a 2013 interview with the publication: \"He was a judge on a show I loved and I was petrified of him. He was brilliant and gave us all tips so you didn't want to let him down,\" she said.\n\n\"After I won, we did The Good Food Show and stuff. John and I always got on, but I never thought about me and him,\" she admitted.\n\nTheir feelings changed when they both found themselves available and Lisa obviously said yes to the letter, joining John for dinner.\n\nThe couple married in 2019 and now frequently host cookery TV shows together such as John and Lisa's weekend kitchen.\n\nJohn has said in the past that the secret to a happy union is a well made bed. \"A really well-made bed. You spend lots of time in it! Honestly, the bedroom â€“ having that sanctuary of a place to go to, I think that's really important. And nice towels... Looking after yourself is as important as looking after each other.\""
