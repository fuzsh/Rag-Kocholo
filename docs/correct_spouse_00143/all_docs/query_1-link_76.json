        "text": "Lisa Faulkner says she and her husband John Torode work well together because they are “a good team”.\n\nLisa Faulkner loves working with her husband John Torode\n\nThe ‘Waterloo Road’ star loves how she and the ‘MasterChef’ judge, 57 - who she met when she competed on 'Celebrity MasterChef', the star-studded edition of the BBC One cookery competition, in 2010 - make a great “partnership” in the home and in the studio of their ITV1 show, ‘John and Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen’.\n\nThe 51-year-old star - who married John in 2019 - told the Daily Mirror newspaper: \"What I love about being married is that it’s about being a partnership. John and I are a good team. We know how to look after each other.\n\n“Last week, I was feeling a bit grumpy about my upcoming birthday, so John made me dinner. Afterwards he bought me tea and chocolate, and when I went into the kitchen he had cleaned everything up, he lit candles, everything looked so beautiful, it’s those little things, he is just so caring.”\n\nLisa - who has teenage daughter Billie with her ex Chris Coghill - recalled how she bamboozled John with her “microwaved chocolate cake in a mug” recipe.\n\nShe said: “I remember when I made my microwaved ­chocolate cake in a mug. He was like, ‘I can’t believe you can stick all the mix in the microwave and it will work?' OK, you’re not going to get the lightest cake, but you’re still going to get a cake, John!”\n\nThe ex ‘Spooks’ star still thinks that the ‘This Morning’ contributor is the “proper chef” of the relationship, despite her cooking talent.\n\nLisa said: “John’s a proper chef, and I’m a home cook. But we ­complement each other. That’s why our show works.”\n\nShe also revealed that their union - which blossomed after five years of friendship in 2015 - also works well because they still “really like and fancy each other!”"
