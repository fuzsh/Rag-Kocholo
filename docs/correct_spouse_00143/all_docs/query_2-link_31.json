        "text": "What programs from yesteryear are you still on the lookout for?\n\nI've really enjoyed the last few years, getting releases of programmes I hadn't seen for twenty or thirty years. I especially enjoyed Travelling Man, a series from the early 80s. The Thriller boxset was another real pleasure.\n\nIt's got to the point now where I think practically everything I'd like to see again has been reisued as a dvd. Apart, that is, from these two:\n\nSons and Lovers - a BBC series from 1981.\n\nBaldmoney, Sneezewort, Dodder and Cloudberry from 1975.\n\n0"
