        "text": "The TV chef, who is also stepmum to husband John Torode’s children Jonah, Lulu, Marselle and Casper, admits that while being a mum comes with many challenges, it’s also her greatest achievement.\n\nLisa, 49, tied the knot with John, 56, in October 2019. The couple met on Celebrity MasterChef in 2010, when Lisa won the show. She tells us that married life has “cemented” their partnership – and they’re happier than ever.\n\nHere, she also opens up to new about working with John, cooking at home and the positives of social media…\n\nHi, Lisa! You’ve been married for nearly two years now. Has it changed your relationship in any way?\n\nIt’s really cemented our partnership. I love that we’re married. I feel so happy and it’s lovely. I’m so pleased we got married in 2019 and not 2020!\n\nYou both have busy schedules. Do you still make time for date nights?\n\nWith Covid I feel like we’ve had as much quality time as we can handle! But it’s funny because now, when we do leave the house, we’re like, “Oh, I’ve missed you”. John’s been going off doing bits and so have I, which has been nice because it’s good to get out there and meet people again."
