        "text": "Actress-turned-chef Lisa Faulkner has been announced as part of the star-studded cast of Netflix’s upcoming adaptation of the Harlan Coben novel, Missing You. The John and Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen star will star as Dana Fells in the suspense thriller.\n\nThe impressive cast also includes Rosalind Eleazar, Jessica Plummer, Richard Armitage, Lenny Henry and Steve Pemberton who have joined the adaptation hot on the heels of the success of Fool Me Once (starring Michelle Keegan and Joanna Lumley).\n\nThe series is currently filming in the UK in locations including Le Mans Crescent and Victoria Square in Bolton as well as Manchester city centre. It is expected to launch on Netflix at the end of 2024 or early 2025.\n\nSpeaking about her role for the first time, Lisa, 52, told Express.co.uk: “I’m really excited about it. I don’t know what else I’m allowed to say because it’s quite scary working for Netflix because they say, ‘No, you can’t say this and you can’t say that’, But yeah, I’m really excited.\n\n“[Fool Me Once] was brilliant, [John and I] were glued to it, and I was really obsessed with Michelle Keegan; I couldn’t take my eyes off her.\n\n“The scripts are brilliant, I have a small part, but I am really excited about doing it. The book is really good, and I think the series will be brilliant.”\n\nLisa has been acting since the early 1990, with roles in The Lover (1992) Spooks (2002), Holby City (1999-2001), EastEnders (2017) and Waterloo Road (2022).\n\nLisa, who is now married to MasterChef’s John Torode, took a step back from acting when she adopted her daughter Billie, 18, with her ex-husband Chris Coghill.\n\nNow her daughter is an adult, Lisa says: “I really want to keep acting. As my daughter gets older, it’s easier to be able to go out and do stuff so it is really exciting.”\n\nLisa and John met on Celebrity MasterChef in 2010 and went on to tie the knot in 2019. Together, they have hosted several cooking shows including John and Lisa’s Weekend and John and Lisa’s Food Trip Down Under.\n\nSpeaking at the Ideal Home Show about Lisa’s new role, John, 58, said: “It’s great that Lisa is getting to go back and do what she loves.\n\n“She absolutely loves cooking, but she is an amazing actress so I’m looking forward to seeing her back on the screen. I can’t wait, I'll be able to say, ‘Ooh yeah, I fancy her’, and it will be alright!”\n\nLisa Faulkner and John Torode were speaking from the Dream Home at the Ideal Home Show taking place at Kensington Olympia until April 7."
