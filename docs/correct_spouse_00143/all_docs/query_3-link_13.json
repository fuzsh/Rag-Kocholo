        "text": "TV cooking couple John Torode and Lisa Faulkner have revealed they enjoy regular date nights to spice up their marriage.\n\nAfter five years together, keeping the spark alight can prove difficult, but John has described how their cosy nights in stop the romance from going off the boil.\n\nHe revealed: “We always used to do a date night on a Wednesday and we will sort of reinstate that this year again.\n\n\"But I think that is important, whether it is just going to a movie or going out for something to eat or just even cooking something at home and just spending a couple of hours catching up on life.”\n\nLisa also shared that they enjoy a meditative stroll together in the morning to counterbalance their hectic schedules.\n\nShe said: \"We make time for each other like when we have got a busy day we get up early and walk the dog together, like we do that first thing.\n\n\"And so that even if then John is out filming or I am doing something or learning lines or whatever then we have spent a little bit of that time together in the morning.”\n\nThe foodie lovebirds got together in 2014, having spent a lot of time together when Lisa competed on, and eventually won, Celebrity MasterChef in 2010.\n\nBut in a joint interview with The Sun ahead of their new ITV series, John And Lisa’s Food Trip Down Under, the pair said that they met many times on the showbiz merry-go-round, prior to their union.\n\nJohn said: \"We have been in the same clubs at the same time, at the same concerts at the same time, the same restaurants at the same time over the last three decades having no idea or having bumped into each other.”\n\nIn 2019 they tied the knot in front of friends and family at Aynhoe Park, Northamptonshire in a beautiful autumnal ceremony.\n\nAnd Lisa, who also has a successful acting career, confesses that she fell in love with John’s cooking long before she met him.\n\nLisa said: (to John) \"Your restaurants like Mezzo and Quaglinos and Bluebird... all of those places that you were at, me and my mates would all be like 'yes this is the hot new restaurant'.\n\n\"We didn’t know about John, we just would go to eat the food...and you worked in all of them.\"\n\nBoth John, 58, and Lisa, 51, have been married before, with Lisa previously married to Chris Coghill, who played Tony King in EastEnders.\n\nThe couple adopted a daughter together named Billie, now 18.\n\nNeat freak\n\nMeanwhile, John tied the knot with a woman named Jessica in 2000, and they have two children together, a son and a daughter.\n\nIndeed so committed are the pair, that Lisa has even come to accept John’s most pressing foibles, notably that he likes to leave her at the airport when they travel because he likes to be a \"lone traveller\".\n\nHe is also a \"neat freak\" who comes home and chucks out \"old pastry\" in the fridge that Lisa has long forgotten.\n\nThe five-part ITV series sees the couple go on a 500-mile road trip along the coast of Western Australia, in search of the very best local food. They meet wildlife including stingrays and dolphins.\n\nAnd judging by the loved up footage, their travels seems more like a second honeymoon, than a work trip.\n\nLisa said: \"It's a very lovely way to make a living.\""
