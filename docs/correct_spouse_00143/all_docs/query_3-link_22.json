        "text": "If I could change anything about myself I’d... stop myself worrying about every little thing. And I do mean everything. Am I getting any better at handling it all? No, I’m not which, at the age of 37, isn’t right, is it?\n\nThe most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me is... the little notes my husband Chris hides for me in my bag. We’ve been together for seven years and he still does stuff like that. He’s very romantic, actually, and those little notes are the nicest romantic gesture of all.\n\nNot a lot of people know this but I’m very good at... speaking French. I started learning at school and then carried on when I was modelling in France. I’m not that brilliant these days but I can get by – I was over there at Christmas and I made sure I brushed up first. I adore France and I’d like to spend more time there.\n\nYou may not know it but I’m no good at... dancing. I have no sense of rhythm whatsoever, so I don’t even attempt it, unless I’ve had too many glasses of wine at a wedding. Then Chris laughs at me – but so does everyone.\n\nTo wake myself up I... have a cup of Earl Grey with the tiniest bit of milk. I’m such a fussy tea drinker that no one wants to make me a cuppa in case they get it wrong. I’m a high-maintenance tea woman.\n\nLast thing at night I always... kiss my daughter and my husband.\n\nIf I have time to myself I... like to read, not that I often get the chance. I love the Twilight fantasy novels by Stephenie Meyer. They’re not just for teenagers – I know loads of older people who love them – and they’re much better than the films.\n\nWhen I’m feeling down I... wallow for about an hour and then I watch an episode of Sex And The City or put on some music that makes me happy. Usually it’s Madonna. I’m a huge fan. People are always ready to put her down but she just gets right back up again.\n\nMy “happy place” is... my home in north London. My family are there, of course, and my friend Angela Griffin is just round the corner.\n\nMy best friends are... Angela and Nicola Stephenson. I met them when we did Holby City years ago and they’re like my extended family – the two extra sisters I never had. We’re always there for each other.\n\nThe worst thing you could say to me is… “I’m very disappointed in you”. That’s a heart-sinking feeling that stays with you for ever.\n\nThe best thing my parents taught me is... not to follow the crowd. My mother used to think I was easily led, and she always told me, “Don’t be afraid to stand on your own.”\n\nMy biggest influence is... my mother. She was the strongest woman I ever met in my life.\n\nMy greatest weakness is… chocolate, especially Green & Blacks. I try not to have it every night, but sometimes it’s a struggle.\n\nIf I could pass any law it would be... that we look after our old folk properly. Young people don’t seem to care about or respect their elders nearly enough.\n\nI drive... a Mercedes B-class. It’s an automatic, has leather seats and cruise control so it’s a joy to drive.\n\nThe song I can never get out of my head is... Waterfall by The Stone Roses. It’s Chris’s ringtone so I’m always hearing it.\n\nWhen I was a child I wanted to be... an actress. I’m not really sure why – it was probably seeing Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nMy proudest moment was... becoming a mum. It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.\n\nThe shop I can’t walk past without buying something is... any shop that sells handbags. Don’t ask me to count how many I have. I don’t buy fakes though – they have to be the real thing.\n\nThe most expensive thing I’ve ever frittered money on is... a Miu Miu handbag for around £300. I’d love a Birkin but those will be the days when I’m earning that sort of money.\n\nI know I’m having a bad hair day when... luckily my hair is dead straight so it doesn’t go frizzy, but it’s a bad hair day when I have an inch of roots showing. That’s when I know I need to get down to the colourist.\n\nMy favourite place in Britain is… West Wittering beach in Sussex. It’s where I spent most of my summer holidays as a child. In fact we had every holiday there, even in winter. My grandparents had a beach hut and I have so many happy memories of those days.\n\nOn my last holiday I… went to Normandy with Chris and Billie, Angela and her family, and my sister Victoria and her family too. It was a lovely break.\n\nThe book I am currently reading is… The Brightest Star in The Sky by Marian Keyes. She’s such a witty writer and I love all her books.\n\nThe best day of my life… was my wedding day. We got married in Richmond Park and it was lovely to have all my friends and family there to see me marry my wonderful husband. I actually danced, too, but I didn’t care what I looked like that day.\n\nMy last meal would be... chicken, roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and stuffing, then some chocolate, washed down with a nice Rioja.\n\nLisa is in the new series of Murdoch Mysteries, starting on Tuesday at 9pm on the Alibi Channel."
