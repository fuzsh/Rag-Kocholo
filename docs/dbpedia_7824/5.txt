Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (born Dec. 22, 1848, Markowitz, Prussia [Germany]—died Sept. 25, 1931, Berlin, Ger.) was a German classical scholar and teacher whose studies advanced knowledge in the historical sciences of metrics, epigraphy, papyrology, topography, and textual criticism.

Educated at the universities of Bonn and Berlin, Wilamowitz-Moellendorff served in the Franco-German War (1870) and traveled through Italy and Greece. He taught successively at the universities of Berlin, Greifswald, and Göttingen before accepting the chair of Greek studies at Berlin in 1897.
