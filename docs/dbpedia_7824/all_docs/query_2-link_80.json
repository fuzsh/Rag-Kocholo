        "text": "Aphorisms 4 -- The Greeks on the Ethical Life\n\nThe Greek view of the ethical life is an interesting contrast to that of the Bible's. A different tone and mood pervade these aphorisms than what one finds in the Old and New Testaments. More significantly, the motivation for leading an ethical life is worlds apart from that of biblical morality.\n\nThese aphorisms seem surrounded by a profound silence which invites the reader to think about the implications of what is being said. There is little emotion in the language employed, but simply an appeal to the mind for quiet reflection. Thinking through the meaning of each aphorism is the only portal one can enter to move beyond the marbled words to the pulsating humanity behind them.\n\nStudents had already been exposed to the Greek mind and sensibility during the first nine weeks of the course when they studied Edith Hamilton's classic, The Greek Way, supplemented with interpretations by Johann Winckelmann, Jacob Burckhardt, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Gilbert Murray, Werner Jaeger, and Pierre Hadot, as well as extensive training in critical thinking throughout the nine weeks. But these aphorisms opened up a deepened awareness of the Greek temperament, as well as underscoring the marked contrast between this worldview and the biblical understanding of human existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this assignment I asked students to discuss three questions: the difference between the Greek and biblical motivation for an ethical life; the strengths and weaknesses of each motivational system; and the student's opinion as to which system would be more effective in motivating ethical behavior, and discussing the reasons why.\n\nWith respect to the third question, it didn't matter which system was chosen; what mattered was the cogency of the reasons for choosing it.\n\nFor extra credit, a student could argue the opposite case as well.\n\nEpictetus\n\nWealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.\n\nWhat matters isn't what happens, but how you react to what happens.\n\nThere is only one way to happiness -- cease worrying about the things which are beyond our control.\n\nCircumstances don't make the man, but only reveal him to himself.\n\nWho is rich? Whoever is content.\n\nBe careful about what images and ideas you let enter your mind.\n\nAll of philosophy is contained in only two words: endure and renounce.\n\nGod has entrusted me with myself.\n\nAs you think, so you become.\n\nWhen misfortune befalls you, ask yourself how you can use it to become a better person.\n\nIt is difficulties that show what we are.\n\nDo not seek to have events happen as you want them to happen, but, instead, want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well.\n\nKeep company only with those who uplift you - those who call forth your best.\n\nWe cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them.\n\nDon't seek what is good from without, but seek it within yourself, or you will never find it.\n\nThe trials we endure introduce us to our strengths.\n\nPlato\n\nThe greatest wealth is to live content with little.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople can either nourish you and help you grow as a person, or stunt your growth and make you wilt and die.\n\nBe as you wish to appear.\n\nThe body is a tomb.\n\nEmploy your time in improving yourself by other men's writings, so that you shall gain easily what others have labored hard for.\n\nWorthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live.\n\nGood people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around them.\n\nBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.\n\nWe can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.\n\nLet parents bequeath to their children not riches, but the spirit of reverence.\n\nThe first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself.\n\nNo evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death.\n\nNo one knows whether death, which people fear as the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good.\n\nThe unexamined life is not worth living.\n\nGood actions give strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others.\n\nRiches can never make a bad man at peace with himself.\n\nGod knows best what is good for us.\n\nWe cannot be better than in seeking to become better.\n\nAristotle\n\nKnowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.\n\nEducating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.\n\nTo avoid criticism, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing.\n\nThe antidote for fifty enemies is one friend.\n\nMisfortune shows those who are not really friends.\n\nTime crumbles things; everything grows old under the power of Time and is forgotten over the passage of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is the mark of an educated mind to entertain a thought without accepting it.\n\nMan is a goal-seeking animal. His life only has meaning if he is reaching out and striving toward his goals.\n\nThe aim of the wise is not to secure pleasure, but to avoid pain.\n\nThe ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace, making the best of circumstances.\n\nYouth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.\n\nThe young are permanently in a state resembling intoxication.\n\nThe young have exalted notions because they have not been humbled by life or learned its necessary limitations.\n\nWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is not one act, but a habit.\n\nThe educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living from the dead.\n\nPoverty is the parent of revolution and crime.\n\nPlato is dear to me, but dearer still is truth.\n\nDemocritus\n\nHappiness does not dwell in herds of cattle or in gold.\n\nBy desiring little, a poor man makes himself rich.\n\nOne must compare one's own life with that of those in worse cases, and consider oneself fortunate, reflecting on their sufferings and being so much better off than they.\n\nVirtue consists not in avoiding wrongdoing, but not even wanting to do wrong.\n\nDo not say or do what is base, even when you are alone.\n\nCourage makes misfortunes small.\n\nEpicurus\n\nWe must free ourselves from the prison of everyday affairs and politics.\n\nIt is useless to ask the gods for what one can obtain for oneself.\n\nIt is better to be free of fear and lying on a bed of straw than to own a couch of gold and a lavish table and yet have no peace of mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLive your life without attracting attention.\n\nEuripides\n\nModeration is the noblest gift of heaven.\n\nThis is courage in man -- to bear unflinchingly what heaven sends.\n\nHappiness is brief.\n\nThe designs of heaven are indeed frightening and inscrutable.\n\nTime will show what you are.\n\nTake heart. The gods bring mortals many good outcomes even from desperate situations.\n\nIf gods do anything shameful, they are not gods.\n\nHow quickly the gods upset the fortunes of the prosperous!\n\nUnderstand mankind's condition and do not grieve beyond measure: You are not alone in being visited by misfortune.\n\nYou cannot prosper without effort; and it is shameful for a young man to be unwilling to work hard.\n\nMen's anger from disaster is terrible, and their hearts begin to lose their way.\n\nDo not provoke the gods, but be content with your lot. Desire for the impossible makes many lose what they already have.\n\nSince you are mortal you must expect also to suffer as mortals do; do you claim the life of a god when you are but human?\n\nA grieving heart is unstable.\n\nEvents will take their course; it is not good being angry at them.\n\nDo not consider painful what is good for you.\n\nThe good and wise lead quiet lives.\n\nSophocles\n\nEach one of us must live the life God gives us.\n\nNothing abides - the starry night, our wealth, our sorrows pass away.\n\nMan is nothing but breath and shadow.\n\nGrief teaches the steadiest mind to waver.\n\nChance rules our lives, and the future is unknown.\n\nFate has terrible power. You cannot escape it by wealth or war.\n\nNo one encounters prosperity without also encountering danger.\n\nSilence, healing.\n\nFate rules all.\n\nEverything changes, and nothing abides.\n\nGood character is not formed in a week or a month. Day by day, what you choose, what you think, and what you do is who you become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtagoras\n\nEducation does not take root in the soul unless one goes deep.\n\nMan is the measure of all things.\n\nConcerning the gods I have no means of knowing either that they exist or that they don't exist, nor what sort of form they have. There are many reasons why knowledge on this subject is impossible, owing to lack of knowledge and the shortness of human life.\n\nXenophanes\n\nHomer and Hesiod have ascribed to the gods all things that are disgraceful among mortals, stealing and adulteries and deceiving one another.\n\nIf horses had hands and could paint, they would paint horses as gods.\n\nDiogenes\n\nHe has most who is content with least.\n\nThe stomach is the Charybdis of life.\n\nTime is the most valuable thing that a man can spend.\n\nLike a shepherd, madness drives the multitude wherever it wants.\n\nPoverty is the unintentional teacher of philosophy because what philosophy tries to instill with words, poverty compels by the power of facts.\n\nThe foundation of every state is the education of its children.\n\nPindar\n\nThe present will not long endure.\n\nIf any man hopes to do a deed without God's knowledge, he errs.\n\nCreatures of a day, man is but a shadow's dream.\n\nGood cheer is the best of healers."
