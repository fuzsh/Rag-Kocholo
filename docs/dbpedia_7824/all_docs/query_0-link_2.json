Nevertheless Baehr's study draws our attention to a number of questions of interest to students of the Roman principate. A list would include how emperors won (and lost) legitimacy : the \"Caesar\" model would draw our attention to one element of the principate (the charismatiC>. and the consequent difficulties about regulating the succession. but at the danger of our failing to see that (by principles of Roman private law of succession) another element was indeed hereditary legitimacy. The model draws our attention to the extreme difficulty of abdication: d. the last days of Nero or Vitellius . We might be led to think about the role of the army: in spite of appearances. modern Caesarism has not essentially been military. but a by-product of political instability in industrialising societies. More profitably. we might be led to think about the role of the \"people\": there is an important warning against seeing the urban plebs in negative terms of a \"mass\" or even a \"mob.\" Instead of some of the generalisations about the history of the late republic with which the book closes. this reviewer would very much have welcomed a sociologist's comments on recent academic work on the participation of the Roman people in politics. such as that of Egon Flaig on Akzeptanz or Paul Vanderbroek's Popular Leadership and Collective Behavior in the Late Roman Republic. THOMAS WIEDEMANN DEPARTMENT OF CLASSICS UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM NOTTINGHAM NG72RD WILLIAM M. CALDER III and BERNHARD Huss. eds. 'The Wilamowitz in Me': 100 Letters between Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff and Paul Friedlander (1904-1931), with translations of selected letters by Caroline Buckler. Department of Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library, Occasional Papers 9. University of California at Los Angeles, 1999. Pp. xxv + 227. Cloth. US $40.00. ISSN 1041-1143. This is (I believe) the tenth volume published in the last twenty years by William Calder and various associates in which the correspondence of Wilamowitz with his contemporaries and his students has been presented in annotated editions and with informative historical introduc- BCXJKREVIEWS/COMPTES RENDUS tions. The value of this material varies. not only because of the occasional nature of many such letters (often. as here. brief postcards). but also because of Wilamowitz' different relations with his correspondents . The recent volume of letters between Wilamowitz and Eduard Norden. also edited by Calder and Huss. Sed Serviendum Officio (Hildesheim 1997) was a substantial piece of scholarship. Norden. a towering figure in Latin studies. became an intimate friend of Wilamowitz. and their letters delved deeply into scholarly issues. By contrast. Paul Friedlander was a student of Wilamowitz at the beginning of the century. and the ensuing correspondence is thinner and perhaps less immediately engaging. that of a respectful acolyte addressing the patriarch and receiving benevolent and generous responses . Of the 100 letters in this volume. the bulk are from Friedlander: they range from his days as an Assistent at Berlin before World War I through his distinguished military service in that conflict (where he read the Phaedo in a foxhole: no. 49). and end a month before Wilamowitz'death in September 1931. A final letter to Friedlander from Wilamowitz' widow in December 1933 is a brief but searing evocation of that annus horribilis. or. in her phrase. \"die Wiistenei dieses Jahres.\" Friedlander was a favoured student. He helped Wilamowitz obtain photographs of a manuscript. and discussed with him (twice in Latin. on Wilamowitz's side: nos. 88 and 90) numerous cruces (all readily traceable through the usual Index Locorum provided in these Calderian editions). What can we learn from this collection? Primarily. I think. the effect that someone of Wilamowitz' character and learning could have on a devotee. Friedlander. a Jew who was brought up a Lutheran. won the Iron Cross as an officer in World War I. and admired Nietzsche and Stefan George. This particular assimilation to German culture burst forth after the trauma of the war in a remarkable letter of 1921 (no. 75: one of the eleven usefully translated into English..."
