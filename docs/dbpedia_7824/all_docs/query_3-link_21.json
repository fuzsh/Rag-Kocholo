        "text": "This dissertation offers new way of thinking about the German poetry anthology and its development, and proposes new boundaries for the research of anthologies and other poetry collections. The period 1765-1796 is a crucial period of change for poetry collections, which offers particularly rich material for a study of their past and present. The first half of the introduction contains a description of the development of the form as well as the historiographical framework. The second half describes previous approaches to the Early Modern German poetry anthology and shows new directions for research, particularly the application of methods from book history to these sources. In the three case studies that follow, book history methodology is used to create narratives about exemplary period anthologies compiled and edited by three prolific anthologists, Karl Wilhelm Ramler (1725-1798), Christian Heinrich Schmid (1746-1800), and Karl Heinrich Jördens (1757-1835), each of whom published multiple poetry collections during the last third of the eighteenth century. This dissertation can prove the potential of such documents for the more general study of German literature and culture, which, although previously acknowledged, has remained widely untested. The case studies suggest specific ways in which book history methodologies can supplement further study of eighteenth-century German literature and literary culture. A chronological bibliography of early German poetry collections from 1624 to 1799 is also included.\n\nThis article, forthcoming in Das Fremde und Das Eigene (Röhrig Universitätsverlag) addresses the mixing of self and other, sexuality and philosophy and literature and irony in Early German Romanticism. It concludes with a thesis about the necessity of another approach to what Friedrich Schlegel called the \"authentic language\" (die reel Sprache), i.e.,\" error, madness and simpleminded stupidity.\" In a tradition from Mallarmé to Bataille, Blanchot, Paul de Man to Avital Ronell's recent book 'Stupidity', the article argues for the necessity to take the risk of giving over to the \"authentic language\", rather than always trying, as the dominant philosophical tradition has always done, to contain and control it, and defend itself against it.\n\nTHE CRISIS OF SCIENCE AND CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY IN THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC στο: Ελένη Γκαστή (επιμ.), δόσις ἀμφιλαφής. Τιμητικός Τόμος για την Ομότιμη Καθηγήτρια Κατερίνα Συνοδινού, Ιωάννινα 2020, 17-34. This paper aims to explore the German Altertumswissenschaft in the general crisis of science following the shock of World War I (Forman thesis). The defeat of Germany, the sense of decline and diffuse pessimism (Oswald Spengler), the distance from rationalism and the re-emergence of an intuitive neo-romanticism puts into question the vigorous school of philological historicism that dominated in the 19th century (U. von Wilamowitz). The study examines the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's cultural critique and the philosophy of life movement (Lebensphilosophie) on the young classical scholars who returned from the fronts of the War, the request for evaluation in the territory of the humanities (Geisteswissenschaften) as opposed to the objectivity of the natural sciences (Naturwissenschaften), as well as the critique of scientific positivism by the representatives of aesthetic fundamentalism in the field of literature (George – Kreis). Finally, there are presented the orientations that Altertumswissenschaft received in Germany under the influence of the above developments within the intellectual environment of the Weimar Republic. Particular focus is given to Werner Jaeger's controversial and finally frustrated attempt to revive the ideals of ancient Greek education (Paideia) and to make them living principles of the modern German educational and political process."
