After all, Cobet was both a creative scholar and a brilliant speaker, who knew low to inspire his pupils with a lasting confidence in the superiority of classical iterature and who was always ready to encourage and help them. N ot a few foreign icholars acknowledged their debt to Cobet, “the greatest Greek scholar of this century,” as W. G. Rutherford, the author of an exemplary Phrynichus edition, jualified him in the obituary in CR 3 (1889) 470-474· Yet the number of students ittracted by Cobet from abroad was very limited; among these was the later Nestor of he Athenian faculty, Constantine Contos, who came to Leiden as a young man to mprove his knowledge of Greek. Many scholars profited from the collations Cobet tad made in Italy, and these were generously put at their disposal, like A. Emper (Dio Chrysostom), L. Kayser (Philostratus), W. Dindorf (Scholia Homerica), W . A. Hirschig Erotici). In later years, Cobet’s extreme negligence of German literature and his ailing memory raised many sharp polemics and blunt insinuations by colleagues who, ike Bernardakis and Th. Gomperz, thought they could prove the priority of other cholars in proposing conjectures. O n glancing through the critical apparatus of some exts commented on by Cobet, it is not difficult to point to some emendations that ' an now justly be traced back to their originator, but at the same time it is curious to se other Cobetian corrections attributed to later distinguished scholars. Cobet would .ot worry about such questions; instead, he would probably have said: “nunc ad seriora\n\n21\n\nC.

Papers A t University Library, Leiden.\n\n22\n\n-\n\nF ra n cis Macdonald Cornford, Fellow of Trinity College and Laurence Pro­ fessor of Ancient Philosophy in the University of Cambridge, was a revolutionary scholar who reinterpreted the origins of Western thought and a masterful translator of and commentator on the later dialogues of Plato. He was also a recognized authority on Greek science, an innovator in the methodology of the history of ideas, an historian and a poet, and an important student of human nature. In his work he achieved a rare combination of profound erudition and sympathetic imagination, which he expressed in an admirable English style that inspired students and col­ leagues, and enabled him to reach an audience far beyond Cambridge. Cornford was born in Eastborne, Sussex, on 27 February 1874, a clergyman’s son. During his youth he distinguished himself as a promising student of Latin and Greek and, upon graduating from St. Paul’s School in London, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1894 on an Open Minor Scholarship to pursue a course of classical studies (Greek and Latin literature and ancient philosophy). In his second year Cornford became the pupil of Henry Jackson, praelector in Ancient Philosophy at Trinity, who later became Regius Professor of Greek in the University, a member of the Order of Merit, and Vice-Master of his college. Cornford once compared Jackson to Dr. Johnson: “Both were masters of the peculiarly English wit that is near allied, not to madness, but to common sense; both were great talkers—Jackson the more congenial of the two, countering folly with a northcountry bluntness that did not. forget the claims of courtesy. He taught the young scholars of many academic generations to clear their minds of loose thinking and never to leave a stone unturned. Like Socrates, he was content to leave his mark upon the minds of his pupils.” Jackson, Cornford continued, not only influenced him as well as three other Cambridge classicists he admired (Richard Archer-Hind, James Adam, and Robert Hicks) but also men outside “the academic world . . . who, if they met\n\n23\n\nF.M. C O R N F O R D\n\nJackson only as unflagging host, perambulating those rooms in Nevile’s Court with a syphon in one hand and a cigar-box in the other” would “count it an honour that they once received a friendly greeting from a great humanist and a great Englishman” (Cornford, The Laws of Motion in Ancient Thought 6-7). Jackson, whose great interest was Plato’s later theory of ideas (a subject he was never able to shape into a book) took Cornford under his wing and set him to reading ancient philosophy. Another important influence on Cornford at this time was that of W alter Headlam, Fellow of King’s College, who was then working on his translations of Aeschylus. (He had previously translated fifty poems of Meleager and later would publish poems of Herodas.) Headlam was regarded by many in Cambridge and on the Continent—Wilamowitz praised his scholarship— as one of the most promising young classicists of his day. Rapport seems to have been established between Headlam and Cornford from the outset, and, until his premature death in 1908, Headlam called on his former pupil for assistance in interpreting difficult passages from Aeschylus. After Cornford graduated from the University in the Jubilee Year of 1897 (he had taken Firsts in both parts of the Classical Tripos), he continued to live in Cambridge, where he supported himself with an Exhibition from Trinity and with the salary he received as editor of the Cambridge Review. It had seemed that he would have to become a schoolmaster, since he had been informed by his family that he would shortly have to be the sole support of his mother. Hence he momentarily ruled out the possibility of seeking a fellowship. Although he was offered a position in the sixth form at Clifton, he continued to mark time and in the end decided to gamble that he would be able to stand successfully for a fellowship before he might have to provide for his mother. Yet he almost lost his wager, for while he passed his Examination, Henry Jackson would not accept his thesis on the Cratylus. Cornford had evidently annoyed Jackson by disagreeing with his mentor’s interpretation of the dialogue. In any event, he was determined to succeed on his last chance in 1899. Jackson, however, had warned him that there might not be any openings that year. Thus, at the age of twenty-five, he applied for the Professorship of Greek at University College, Cardiff. He was turned down by Cardiff, but he won his fellowship in Trinity on the basis of his dissertation, “Prolegomena to the Nicomachean Ethics.” The year before he became a teaching Fellow of Trinity Cornford met Jane Ellen Harrison, a Lecturer in classics in Newnham College. He had first heard her give one of her bravura performances at the Archaeological Museum: “I have a vision of her figure on the darkened stage of the lecture-room . . . which she made deserve to the full its name of theatre—a tall figure in black drapery, with touches of her favourite green, and a string of blue Egyptian beads, like a priestess’ rosary.” After hearing her public lecture on the mystica vannus lacchi, Cornford “sent her a letter on some point that had struck me. She asked me to come talk it over, and so began the series of innumerable conversations over the black brew of Indian tea which we both found needful to revive the powers of thought after the idleness of the early afternoon” (Cornford, 1929). And so, too, began a period of scholarly collaboration that ended when Cornford joined the British army in 1914.\n\n-\n\n24\n\n-\n\nShortly after meeting Cornford, Harrison introduced him to her Oxford friend, Gilbert Murray. This group of scholars, augmented on occasion by the partici­ pation of A. B. Cook, has been referred to as the Cambridge School or the Cambridge Ritualists. Either term, however, is a misnomer, since Murray was at Oxford (as Regius Professor of Greek from 1908). But the term “ritualist” was an appropriate description of their interest; they wished to discover the sources of Greek culture, and they thought that ritual was the bedrock from which all great symbolic forms emerge. A t the time Cornford and his group set out to revolutionize the study of Greek culture, classical scholarship was mainly confined to philology. Though Cornford and his collaborators appreciated the importance of strict linguistic study, they insisted that it should not dominate or circumscribe the scope of their investigations. The key, they thought, which would provide a more accurate and inclusive understanding of the intellectual achievements of ancient Greece, was not to be found in the study of syntax or textual criticism but in the relatively new disciplines of sociology and cultural anthropology. Borrowing concepts and methods of research from Emile Durkheim and ftom comparative mythologists such as James George Frazer, Cornford, Harrison, Murray, and Cook made a fresh examination of the origins of Greek historiography, philosophy, literature, and religion. The word “origins” is stressed because, until they applied the techniques and discoveries of contemporary social anthropology to classical studies, the vast majority of classicists ignored, the begin­ nings and development of ancient Greek drama, religious practice, and philosophical speculation. By and large, most European students of antiquity in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries treated classical texts in vacuo, as if they were independ­ ent of time and change. Yet within twelve years (1903-1914)— twelve years in which Cornford and his intellectual compatriots published many of their most influential and controversial works—the case for the evolutionary approach to classical studies had been made quite convincing; it could be, and indeed was, attacked (mainly because the evolutionary thesis appeared to diminish the importance of invention and individual genius in the creation of works of art or systems of thought); but it could no longer be ignored. Henceforward classical scholars would have to take seriously the contention that A ttic tragedy and comedy, Ionian cosmogony, and Olympian reli­ gion, had had their roots in earlier, more “primitive” stages of thought and action, namely, in archaic ritual—an idea that Comford’s article acquired from Robertson Smith—and mythology. Scholars could no longer accept with complacency the established view of the Greek “mind” as a static entity; rather, they now had to consider the possibility that it was a process demarcated by clearly definable stages analogous to the cultural strata unearthed by archaeologists. Just as archaeologists such as Schliemann (who had begun digging at Troy when Harrison was an under­ graduate) and Arthur Evans (who “set sail for his new Atlantis and telegraphed news of the Minotaur from his own labyrinth\") (J. E. Harrison, Reminiscences of a Student's Life: 83) had revealed a succession of different levels in the cultures of Troy and Crete, so Cornford, Harrison, Murray, and Cook thought they had dug up the past layers of the Greek mind and had revealed the historical series of mental and social events that led gradually but directly to the cultural triumphs of the fifth and fourth centuries. 25\n\nF.M. C O R N F O R D\n\nF.M. C O R N F O R D\n\nThe search for origins, however, did more than establish the evolutionary record by which the Greek mind emerged from ritual and myth. As Cornford notes in his first book, Thucydides Mythistoricus (1907): “Our view is that modern research into origins is not only recovering the temporal sequence of the several stages in the development of religious (and philosophic) representations, but is also, by that very fact, bringing to light the corresponding systems of association deposited, at those stages, in the racial tradition and memory of the Greeks—systems that lasted on in their minds like superimposed layers of alluvial stratification.” Discovery of these “corresponding systems of association” was invaluable, Cornford observed, in attempting to understand the history of ancient thought in general and the views of individual philosophers in particular. Philosophers do not think in a vacuum; they are influenced by their background and traditions perhaps even more than by their historical time and place. While acknowledging the signifi­ cance of individual talent and authentic novelty in the history of ideas, Cornford persistently drew attention to the fundamental presuppositions, the commonly em­ ployed structures of thought and feeling, of metaphor and symbol that are taken for granted during a given epoch. For he believed that the process of discovering the presuppositions of a philosopher’s work was as, if not more, important than perceiving the differences that divided him from his contemporary opponents: “In every age the common interpretation of the world of things is controlled by some scheme of unchallenged and unsuspected presupposition; and the mind of any individual how­ ever little he may think himself to be in sympathy with his contemporaries, is not an insulated compartment, but more like a pool in one continuous medium—the cir­ cumambient atmosphere of his place and time.\" Thucydides Mythistoricus is devoted to elucidating the “systems of association,” presupposition, or— to use a term Cornford later used—the “unwritten philosophy” in the History of the Peloponnesian War. Cornford argued in Part I that the policy of commercial expansion championed by the Piraeus party and annealed in the Megarian decrees— the so-called “Western Policy,” which, for reasons of political expedi­ ency, was reluctantly supported by Pericles— led to the outbreak of the War. But— and this is the crucial point of Part I—Thucydides did not understand this fact, because he had no comprehension of the modern “science” of economics, since there was as yet no such thing. Nor did he possess, as Cornford argues in Part II, an understanding of historical causation in the modem sense, since his thought was still molded by traditional or mythopoeic forms. This led him to explain specific events of war in terms of nonhuman agencies (Tyche, for instance, in the case of the battle of Pylos) and to view the Peloponnesian War itself as the unfolding of tragic destiny (a model of historical explanation that he derived from Aeschylus). Hence Thucydides was not, as the majority of his recent students had claimed, a “modern of moderns” but rather a mythistoricus. According to Cornford, historical events are frequently transformed in an author’s mind by “traditional habits of thought.” He called this process by which commonly inherited assumption transmutes fact into legend and legend into myth\n\n“infiguration.” In Thucydides’ case, tradition prevented him from perceiving the facts at Pylos. He was on the frontier of two ages, one still bound up in mythopoeic presupposition, the other—then just arising—seeking to establish a view of the world based on reason. He simply did not have the symbolic forms that might enable him to see things as they actually happened at Pylos or the Piraeus; he knew nothing of causation. Thus he relied on pre-Olympian or nonhuman agencies to explain rever­ sals of fortune and borrowed the structure of Aeschylean tragedy to describe the crucial events of the war. Reactions to Cornford’s first book were mixed. The expected support was immediately at hand: Gilbert Murray praised it in a letter to his friend and gave it an excellent review in the Albany. Arthur Verrall, G. M. Trevelyan, Hugh Stewart, and G. E. Moore wrote letters of appreciation. He also received thoughtful and compli­ mentary letters from W alter Leaf and Alfred Zimmern. But he was attacked by Phillimore, who thought he was misinterpreting Thucydides to suit his own devices. And he was as often praised as criticized in the newspapers. J. B. Bury, who presumably read Thucydides Mythistoricus when he was preparing his Lane Lectures (which he delivered at Harvard in the spring of 1908) agreed “that the style of Thucydides was influenced by the A ttic drama . . . and it is one of the merits of Mr. Cornford’s monograph to have illustrated this influence. But,” he insisted, “the tragic phrases and reminiscences, and the occasional use of tragic irony, cannot be held to have more than a stylistic significance.” While some classicists, such as W. K. C. Guthrie, have recently praised Thucydides Mythistoricus, Bury’s view has endured. There is another exception to this opinion, however, that is worth recording; in The Idea of History (1946) R. G. Collingwood points out that “legend, either in the form of theocratic history or in the form of myth, was” not “a thing foreign to the Greek m in d .. . . F. M. Cornford in his Thucydides Mythistoricus. . . drew attention to the existence of such elements even in the hard-headed and scientific Thucydides. He was of course perfectly right.” The year following the appearance of Thucydides Mythistoricus Cornford published his immortal satire of academic politics, Microcosmographia Academica, with its portraits of the young-man-in-a-hurry, the Adullamites (scientists and engineers), Liberals and Conservatives, and its splendid description on acquiring influence: “Political influence may be acquired in exactly the same way as the gout; indeed, the two ends ought to be pursued concurrently. The method is to sit tight and drink port wine.” Cornford’s venture into academic satire was consistent with his previous efforts at reform of the University and its Colleges. He had urged the Classical Society of Cambridge to reform the Classical Course in 1903; he had attacked compulsory chapel in 1904; and he had helped establish a summer course at Cambridge for the Working Men’s College in 1901. He also questioned the role of religion in the . University in 1911. It is important to note that Cornford’s concern for University reform (he had supported University degrees for women as an undergraduate) reflects in part his desire to reform society as a whole. He opposed British imperialism, became\n\n26\n\n27 -\n\nF.M. C O R N F O R D\n\na Fabian. Socialist, assisted political refugees, and tried to save scholars from Nazi persecution. And he invariably defended democratic principles, especially the right of freedom of expression, a position that was sharply tested when he—at the time a Sergeant of Musketry—helped lead the effort to have pacifist Bertrand Russell’s Lectureship in Trinity reinstated during World W ar I. Four years after the appearance of Microcosmographia Academica Comford published his second book, From Religion to Philosophy. The year of its publication, 1912, marked the greatest cooperation amongst the members of his scholarly circle. Harrison published Themis in the same year, a work that included chapters by both Cornford (“The Origin of the Olympic Games”) and Murray (“Excursus on the Ritual Forms Preserved in Greek Tragedy\"). And Murray himself, whose Rise of the Greek Epic had appeared during the same year as Cornford’s Thucydides Mythistoricus ( 1907 ), also published a book in 1912, Four Stages of Greek Religion. In his new book Cornford continued to explore questions he had raised in Thucydides: the problems of decipher­ ing the unconscious elements in ancient systems of thought, and the quest for origins. He had previously taken issue with contemporary scholars who imposed modern assumptions on Thucydides; now he criticized modern classicists (such as Deussen and Burnet) who mistakenly viewed the presocratics—to transpose a phrase of Jacob Burkhardt’s— as the first-born sons of modern empiricism. The Ionian cosmogonists, for instance, appeared to them to be precursors of the natural philosophers of the seventeenth-century Age of Genius or, indeed, even the scientists of the Age of Darwin. The fallacy of misplaced empiricism ignores the importance of collective effort and tradition in the creation and transmission of ideas. To imagine “that Thales or Anaximander was like Adam on the day of his creation, with no tradition behind him, no inherited scheme of things, opening his innocent eyes on a world of pure sense impressions not as yet coordinated into any conceptual structure” is at the very least naive, since the “philosophic Muse is not a motherless Athena: if the individual intellect is her father, her older and more august parent is Religion.” Philosophy, according to Comford, has its roots in religion, or rather in a pretheological state of religion or myth, and the representations of religion develop from the social order of the primitive tribe. Borrowing from Durkheim, Cornford asserted that the collective consciousness of the primordial tribe generated the idea of the sympathetic continuum (of all life in nature), which itself became the first religious representation. The sympathetic continuum was eventually divided—the idea of division having been unconsciously inherited from antecedent totemic divi­ sions of the primordial tribe— into two pools or channels of mana that resulted in the formation of two approaches to reality, one negative, the other positive. The former produced the collective religious representations of Moira, Nomos, and Physis, the emergence of the Olympian gods, and the advent of philosophy and the early development of scientific materialism. The latter led to the creation of mystery religions and the view of life as dynamic process. The negative channel spatialized reality—here Cornford, following Harrison, borrows from Bergson—while the posi­ tive stream of religious thought viewed life in terms of human time or becoming. The\n\n-\n\n28\n\nformer ends by reducing life to particles in a machine, while the latter embraces life in the round of nature. Early philosophy comprises both channels in two historical traditions, first noted by Diogenes Laertius: the Ionian and the Pythagorean, the scientific and the mystical or, as Nietzsche would have it— and Cornford gives him credit for the intuition—the Apollonian and the Dionysian. Like his first book, From Religion to Philosophy provoked controversy and received varied reviews. W. A. Heidel found some favorable things to say about his handling of the mystical tradition, but he was very critical of Cornford’s assimilation of the complex history of Ionian philosophy to the simplified abstractions of Durkeheimian sociology. Contrary to Heidel, Gilbert Murray noted his agreement in The Nation (13 July 1912) with Cornford’s analyses of the inherited mental background of the earliest Ionian philosophers. “For instance, Anaximander, in a famous sentence, says that all existing things of necessity must pass away into that from which they rose, because ‘they pay to one another justice and retribution for their injustice according to the ordinance of time.' T hat is not the free comment of a man of science, derived from the observation of nature. It is steeped in religious [and moral] preconceptions” that originate in the pretheological notion of Moira as “the portion of land, that by rights belongs to any division of the tribe. To transgress Moira is to trespass; to break Dike, or custom; to violate nomos, the tribal law or assignment.” Since “the world of the gods is necessarily imagined on the model of the world of their worshippers, the rule of Moira over Zeus becomes plain.” For, like the members of the totemic tribe, the gods have to follow the rules of apportionment. To exceed their proper portion would make both humans and gods culpable of hybris or force them, as Anaximander puts it, to pay recompense “for their injustice according to the ordinance of time.” While he accepted Cornford’s view of the continuity between religion and philosophy, Murray could not entirely agree with his colleague’s conclusions about the “origin of the conceptions of god, the soul and other religious ideas, and the derivation of the various forms of early Greek philosophy from divergent treatments of these fundamental totemic conceptions.” Like Heidel, Murray also thought that Comford neglected important “historical factors” in his account of the different philosophers because “he is sometimes obsessed by his own method.” Cornford’s reviews were also varied in the press. Many reviewers had reserva­ tions about his thesis, and most still deemed Burnet’s view that science began with Thales as essentially correct. W hile some complimented Cornford on the boldness of his interpretation, they had reservations or outright distaste for his use of French sociology. From Religion to Philosophy has fared somewhat better in more recent evalu­ ations. W . K. C. Guthrie, Cornford’s most famous pupil and eventually his successor to the Laurence Chair of Ancient Philosophy, thought Cornford’s theory “leaves one now with a certain feeling of inadequacy.” Yet, he concluded, “it is fair to say that it represents a necessary stage on the way to that comprehensive understanding of the Greek mind which he afterwards achieved, rather than an example of the full understanding itself’ (Unwritten Philosophy). D. S. Robertson, late Regius Professor of\n\n29\n\nF.M. C O R N F O R D\n\nGreek in Cambridge and also a pupil of Comford’s, expressed his admiration for the work at the time of Cornford’s death: “Five years later came a far better book [than the Thucydides], his novel and stimulating From Religion to Philosophy, much influenced by Jane Harrison’s Themis.” Hugh Lloyd-Jones may have had the book in mind (as well as Comford’s later treatment of the subject, Principium Sapientiae) when he referred to Cornford’s “important work on Plato and on presocratic philosophy and its prephilosophical background.” Perhaps the greatest admirer of From Religion to Philosophy (as well as Comford’s other works on the presocratics) is the French scholar, JeanPierre Vernant, although Cornford also receives most favorable treatment by the philosopher of science Richard H. Schlägel, in his From Myth to the Modem Mind: A Study of the Origins and Growth of Scientific Thought (1985). In his next book, The Origin of Attic Comedy (1914), Cornford put forward the hypothesis that the “canonical plot formula” of the Aristophanic play “preserves the stereotyped action of a ritual or folk drama, older than literary Comedy, and of a pattern well known to us from other sources.” He had been inspired to reexamine the structure of the Old Comedy by the works of Zielinski and Gilbert Murray. The latter’s “Excursus on the Ritual Forms Preserved in Greek Tragedy” in Jane Harrison’s Themis had espe­ cially inspired him to look for traditional forms in the plays of Aristophanes. He eventually concluded “that Comedy itself has sprung, not necessarily from the same ritual [as Tragedy], but from one closely allied to it and belonging to the same class.” Cornford thought scholars had overlooked the importance of the second part of the Aristophanic play. Although they had discussed the Prologue, Parados, and Agon, they had regarded the play as being virtually over after the Parabasis. Yet, Cornford argued, there is a “sequence of fixed incidents” in the second part of the play that is “no less canonical than the Agon”: a “Sacrifice, Feast, [and] marriage Komos.” Following Aristotle, Cornford concluded that the fixed elements in the Old Comedy had originated in the Phallic ceremonies associated with the worship of Dionysus, an example of which can be found in Aristophanes’ Achamians. In his view we see in the Agon “the equivalent of the sacrifice which precedes the Phallic Song. The Agon is the beginning of the sacrifice in its primitive dramatic form—the conflict between the good and evil principles, Summer and Winter, Life and Death. The good spirit is slain, dismembered, cooked and eaten in the communal feast, and yet brought back to life. These acts survive in the standing features of the comic plot between the Parabasis and the Exodos. Finally comes the Marriage of the risen God, restored to life and youth to be the husband of the Mother Goddess. This marriage is the necessary consummation of the Phallic ritual, which, when it takes a dramatic form, simulates the union of Heaven and Earth for the renewal of all life in Spring.” His brilliant reconstruction of the origins of comedy was generally greeted with praise. He was criticized for exaggerating the significance of conjectural literary origins, for failing to substantiate fully the existence of the basic ritual drama, and for diminishing the significance of individual creativity, a charge he vigorously disputed: We can never know how creative “the wit of Aristophanes” was unless we can find out what Aristophanes “did not invent.” Most of his reviews, however, stressed the\n\n-\n\n30\n\nimportance of his analysis of the second part of the plays, complimented him for his ingenious and thorough examination of the extant comedies, and either accepted or were at least open to his suggestion that a ritual drama provided the traditional mold in which the Old Comedy was cast. The thesis that drama originated in ritual, or that dramatists unconsciously used fixed forms inherited from fertility ceremonies, was vigorously challenged from the start by classicists such as William Ridgeway, Professor of Archaeology in Cam­ bridge, who insisted that tragedy developed from the dramatic dances associated with the cult of heroes. Some reviewers of The Origin of Attic Comedy referred favorably to Ridgeway’s theory when they criticized Comford’s chapter on comedy and tragedy. However, the scholar whose efforts to demolish the idea that drama (both tragedy and comedy) was associated with the rituals of Dionysus as Year Spirit (EniautusOaimon) or seasonal deity was A. W. Pickard-Cambridge, who maintained in his Dithyramb Tragedy and Comedy (Oxford, 1927) that the advocates of this theory proved neither the existence of a ritual from which drama emerged in classical Greece nor its use in the surviving plays. More recently, scholars such as Gerald Else have resumed PickardCambridge’s argument and have decried “the modern obsession with myth and ritual, or ritual origins of myth.” The rejection of the ritualist interpretation of the origins of tragedy and comedy predominates at present (although it should be noted that T. B. L. Webster held to a modified variation of Murray’s theory). As Cornford observed in his lecture on “The Unconscious Element in Literature and Philosophy’’ (1921), the theory that there are “ ‘fixed forms’ of A ttic Tragedy” and Comedy that “correspond to the moments in a ritual drama which survives all over Europe in the folk-play” reduces many scholars “for some cause I cannot fathom . . . to a state of frenzy.” If it no longer provokes frenzy—and it may still—it is either largely dismissed or ignored. Less than three months after the last reviews of The Origin of Attic Comedy appeared, Cornford joined the British Army as a (territorial) Instructor of Musketry. Whereas he was often embarrassingly quiet during supervision of his pupils, and while he was known for his uncanny ability to “dematerialize” or vanish without notice from a social gathering (he once told his children that he could have been “confidential butler to a wicked earl”), he thoroughly enjoyed the camaraderie of army life. He was rarely too far away from Cambridge to visit his growing family—he had married Frances Crofts Darwin, a granddaughter of the great naturalist, in 1909—and he often managed to keep a hand in college politics, even after he joined the Ministry of Munitions (where he rose to the rank of major). After the war Cornford resumed his Lectureship in classics (he had been appointed Assistant Lecturer in 1902, Lecturer in 1904), and stood for the Regius Professorship of Greek in 1921. He lost to Alfred Chilton Pearson (a scholar in the Jebb tradition) but tried again in 1928, when he competed against his former pupil, D. S. Robertson, to whom he also lost. He consoled himself with the fact that he had ■ previously been appointed Brereton-Laurence Reader in Classics (the first University post in ancient philosophy in Cambridge), and he continued to hope that the University would one day establish a chair in his subject, an aspiration that was\n\n31\n\nF.M. C O R N F O R D\n\nF.M. C O R N F O R D\n\nfulfilled when he was appointed first Laurence Professor of A ncient Philosophy in 1931. Two years after he first stood for the Regius Professorship Comford started publishing again: articles on Pythagoreanism were followed by contributions to the Cambridge Ancient History on “Mystery-Religions and Presocratic Philosophy,” and “The Athenian Philosophical Schools.” In 1927, hearing that Philip Wicksteed, who was paralyzed and terminally ill, needed assistance in completing his translation and commentary on Aristotle’s Physics, Comford immediately offered his services. It took him longer than he had anticipated to revise Wicksteed’s manuscript, and it was not until 1929 that the first volume of the Physics was published by the Loeb Classical Library; the second volume appeared in 1934. His generous labor may have diverted him from his own scholarship, but it influenced the form he chose for his great studies of Plato’s later dialogues. Beginning in 1935 with Plato’s Theory of Knowledge (the Theaetetus and the Sophist) and followed by the Timaeus in 1937 and the Parmenides two years later, Comford sought to elucidate the epistemology and cosmology of Plato by using a method (employed by Wicksteed in his analysis of the Physics) that was familiar to every lecturer on classical texts: translation with “running commentary.” In his earlier books Cornford had examined the origins and background of early Greek speculation; now, in his Plato studies, he focused his attention on “the finished product.” This allowed him “the opportunity for a more exact appreciation of the structure which the philosopher himself had built.” Yet, although he was now dealing with the philosophy itself rather than the presuppositions it had inherited from the preclassical past, he still immersed himself in the study of the main currents of thought that formed the intellectual climate of Plato’s age, and he made a serious effort to learn Greek mathematics— including the mathematics taught in the Academy—so that he could understand his subject in the round. Cornford’s accomplishment astounded many of his contemporaries. As Pro­ fessor Guthrie has observed: “Those of us who knew Comford at that time can only marvel at the completeness with which all this in itself indigestible material was assimilated and transmuted, so that the reader who is presented with the finished commentary can scarcely be aware of the amount of patient labour that has gone to its composition.” The books on the later dialogues were an immediate success and, even though they never achieved the popularity of Cornford’s famous translation of the Republic (1941)— which was aimed “at conveying to the English reader as much as possible of the thought of the Republic in the most convenient and least misleading form”—they have been (and still are being) read by many academic generations. After completing his Platonic studies, Cornford returned to the subject that had never ceased to fascinate him: the origins of Greek philosophical thought. Previously he had taken the view that one channel of Greek religion had ultimately evolved into science. Now, however, he revised his earlier opinion—which he still maintained in Before and After Socrates (1932)—and argued that both Pythagorean-\n\nism and Ionian “empiricism” had remained essentially religious (although pretheological). Indeed he demonstrated that Milesian cosmogony had ultimately derived from Near Eastern ritual, a thesis he first put forward in his lecture “A Ritual Basis of Hesiod’s Theogony” (1941) and later examined at length in his posthumously pub­ lished book, Principium Sapientiae (1952). By examining the sorts of questions the early philosophers had asked about the creation of the universe and by discovering “fossilized metaphors” of defunct mythologies in their philosophical fragments, Comford was able to demonstrate that the Ionians were not only not conducting an empirical investigation of nature but were unconsciously framing their conclusions about the origins of the universe in the structure of prehistoric creation myths (ultimately derivable from the Enurna Elish and transmitted through the Epic of Kumarbi) that were based on cosmogonic ritual in the case of the Ionians and shamanism in the case of the “Italians.” His last search for the origins of Western philosophy led Cornford to the conclusion that there were at least four distinct (yet dynamically interrelated) stages in the evolution of Western “thought”: ritual, myth, religion (“quasi-rational”), and philosophy (“rational,” although not “scientific”). He appears to have believed that through his study of the emergence of philosophy he had discovered a model of ideational change that might in fact be universal, applicable, in other words, not simply to the development of Greek thought but, at least in some important respects, to the intellectual evolution of the species as a whole. Principium Sapientiae has not only influenced classicists but also historians and philosophers of science. W hether it has been criticized (by Vlastos, for instance, for failing to recognize the importance of the Ionians’ formulation of the idea of an independent order of nature [Gnomon 27 (1955) 65ff.J) or praised by E. R. Dodds and W. K. C. Guthrie, it cannot be overlooked. It remains an outstanding treatm ent of the subject. Comford retired in 1939. Two years earlier he had received an honorary D. Litt, from Birmingham University for his outstanding scholarship in ancient philoso­ phy. His last years also saw rewards outside academia: his wife, Frances Crofts Darwin, was restored to health after a long period of illness, some of his children married and, for a second time, he became a grandfather. According to his wife, he felt confident about his family’s future when he died on 3 January 1943.\n\n- 32\n\nBooks Thucydides Mythistoricus. London, 1907. From Religion to Philosophy.

He willingly embraced the enthu­ siasm for Greek culture that arose during the nineteenth-century in Germany and as a scholar could still see Greek history in an idealizing light. Yet his approach to philology was stamped with the realism of his teacher and collaborator August Böckh, one of the greatest geniuses among Hellenists. To the scientific discipline of Böckh, who never visited Greece, Curtius could contribute in addition an intimate knowl­ edge of the countryside, its monuments, and its artifacts. He established Germany’s most prominent excavation, at Olympia, and set the pattern for the scientific recovery of the Hellenic world and its experience through exploration on the soil of Greece itself. Curtius was born in Lübeck and always retained the Hanseatic unaspirated s in his speech. He studied first in Bonn, where he heard the philologist F. G. Welcker and the philosopher C. A. Brandis; in 1834 he moved to Göttingen, where he heard Karl Otfried Müller, who turned him toward the study of Greek geography, history, and culture. He then studied in Berlin under Böckh and F. W. Gerhard. In 1837 he accepted an invitation from Brandis, who was academic adviser to King O tto of the newly independent Greece, to accompany Brandis and his family to Greece as tutor to their children. He explored Greece widely in the company of the geographer Karl Ritter, translated Greek poetry into German, wrote emotional poems of his own celebrating the landscape, and fell in love with the country and people— but in a highly classicizing way. He deliberately turned his gaze from contemporary Greek politics and aspirations and showed the same lack of interest in political reality in his studies of Greek antiquity. His aim was, rather, to commune with the loftiest ideals of\n\n- 37 -\n\nERNST CURTIUS\n\nancient: civilization, even if this required overlooking moments when these ideals fell short of achievement. In 1838 he first visited Olympia, which was to be the focus of his scientific work. He also visited Delphi and sent his parents an enthusiastic description of the site and its atmosphere (Ein Lebensbild in Briefen, 181-82):\n\nW ith his former teacher, Müller, he visited Delphi in 1840 and, when Müller died on the trip from a heat-induced fever, had the sad duty of burying him in the living rock of the hill of Kolonos Hippios, overlooking the grove of Plato’s Academy outside Athens— the home of Sophocles and the place where the outcast Oedipus at last found peace. This scene too he described to his parents (Ibid., 232, 237):\n\nI lived four days in Delphi, unforgettable days, when heaven favored us with sun again, though intermittently. You can forget the whole world in this pleasant nook in the mountains. The houses of Kastri lie exactly over the old temple of Pythian Apollo; the terrace of the temple, made of Pentelic marble, gleams at midday among the huts built over it. In the same way you can see between two poor hovels a part of the splendid curve of the theater and everywhere traces of temple-stones and inscribed blocks of marble__ When you reach the Castalian Spring you are actually in Delphi. There is a lovely open area around the source, immediately above are the mountains, reaching to heaven, then downward are the gentle slopes; they are watered by the sacred spring and thickly covered with the most beautiful olive trees, and in the middle there is a quiet monastery beneath the walls of the ancient gymnasium. You can climb up and reach another spring in a few minutes: this is the Cassioris, from which the priestess drank her inspiration. This spring still has its old course through the middle of the temple area as the water trickles under the terrace of the temple. Even today it irrigates a bay tree, an honored descendant of the old grove of the\n\nGod in his grace has preserved me from all dangers and has kept me strong and well under the glowing rays of the July sun, which this time were frightful—but the miserable days I have lived through, and the horrible tragedy that has struck us here, must be the sad content of these lines. Our dear teacher and master has been the victim of his tireless enthusiasm: last Sunday, 2 August, we laid Karl Otfried Müller to rest on the hill of the Academy. . . . After the autopsy was performed on Sunday afternoon, which showed that the brain of the deceased was completely soft and decomposed, the burial was carried out towards evening. Students drew the coffin on a wagon, four deans of the university walked at its corners; all the ambassadors, the whole staff of the court, of the university, and of the schools, most of the Germans in Athens, and many Greeks all followed, a line seemingly without end. The high priest gave a speech in German, then the excellent Professor Ioannou spoke in Greek; military music accompanied the funeral procession. Schöll and I returned home from the grave of our dear teacher by clear, quiet moonlight, thinking mainly of the unfor­ tunate widow with her five children, who were awaiting the happy return of the man in O hlau.. . .\n\npriestess.\n\nIf you go farther toward the western end of the theater-like curve of the area of Delphi, you come to another street of graves and to a ledge from which you have a great view of the sea, down to the old harbor of Delphi, where once ships landed from all regions carrying horses for competition in the games as well as pack animals. . . . You cannot imagine the joy with which I looked for traces of the ancient remains here, since I got certain results beyond anything I might have expected and formed a clear picture of the sacred place.\n\nAnd after I had spent the whole day with my architect in visiting and measuring, I enjoyed the evening in the gay company of the common people. Just then it was the marriage season and on the Sunday three marriages were in preparation. That always calls for a cycle of celebrations lasting two weeks. We went with the mayor to the bride’s relatives. The music consisted of a muffled drum and a shrill shepherd’s pipe. The men sit around on little benches that are crowded with food and wine. The main jollity is the toasts to one’s health: first to the king, then to the bride and groom, then to the visitors, and so on. Each drinker usually gives a little speech to his drinking partners and then drains his glass to loud music as slowly as he can. The women stand around the bride and sing in the next room. .. .\n\n38\n\nCurtius returned to Germany and obtained his doctorate in Halle (1841) and gained Habilitation in Berlin in 1843 with an edition of Delphic inscriptions that he had begun with Müller. He was invited in 1844 to become tutor to Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, the ffiture Emperor Friedrich III, and established close relations with the royal house, which became enthralled with Greek culture and supported German research in Greece. From 1844 to 1856 he was professor of classical philology in Berlin. He now published his first major work, perhaps still his most important personal contribution to knowledge, the two-volume description of the Peloponnese, the fruit of his early explorations of Greece in the 1830s. In 1856 he returned to Göttingen as professor of classical philology and archaeology, thus holding until 1868 the chair once occupied by his mentor and friend, Karl Otfried Müller. The crowning work of his years in Göttingen was his Griechische Geschichte, planned by the house of Weidmann as a companion to Mommsen’s history of Rome. This became the most widely read Greek history written in German, reaching a sixth edition. Curtius’s aim was to present the most exalted possible view of Greek civiliza­ tion. The work is written in ceremonious rhetorical style and found a ready public when Germans were constructing their adoring relationship toward classical Greece. The English historian Freeman thought that the best pages were the vivid descriptions of the Greek landscape, but he awarded the palm for political realism and insight to George Grote, whose history appeared at the same time. 39\n\nERNST\n\nERNST CURTIUS\n\nCURTIUS\n\nFor Curtius, history was mainly the result of decisions by great men, élite leaders, and he fearlessly discovered their noble motivations even when ancient sources failed him. Solon’s aims (he thought) were shaped by long self-communion of the broadest philosophical sort. Cleisthenes was seen as a man of passionate ambition and a champion of the civil rights of the oppressed; part of his loyalty was to Solon’s constitution, whose generosity to the lower orders he sought to expand. Pericles was to Curtius almost a philosopher-king. Yet Curtius was not a modern Livy: he knew his sources with the thoroughness of a great German scholar and a pupil of Welcker and Böckh, and the triumph of Greece over Persia is not naively portrayed as the victory of light over darkness. The chronological limits of the history also tell their story. Only some fifteen years had passed since J. G. Droysen had written his history of Alexander and carried the survey down into the Hellenistic age, which in effect he discovered. He was under the powerful influence of Hegel and saw Greek history as fulfilling its assigned cycle and preparing the way for Christianity; for him, Alexander was the tool of history, and the whole story had a purpose that was validated by historical inevitability. Curtius had nothing to do with such modern theories. His third volume ends the narrative with the establishment of Philip II’s domination over Greece. The resistance led by Demosthenes was for Curtius the final act of independent Hellenism. As his collabo­ rator Mommsen, in the Weidmann series, ended his history of the Roman Republic before the death of his hero Julius Caesar, so Curtius evidently found no pleasure in letting Macedonian dynasts supplant Greek statesmen on the stage of history. His chief aim was an uplifting narrative, and Georg Busolt was right to admit that his own detailed, encyclopedic Griechische Geschichte should not be compared with that of Curtius in respect of enjoyable reading. Neither Busolt nor his more original rival, Julius Beloch, drove Curtius from the field among “general readers.” In 1868 Curtius returned to Berlin as Professor of Classical Archaeology. He had long recommended the undertaking of systematic excavations in Olympia but had not been able to move the German authorities to implement his plan. After the early successes of Schliemann at Troy, Curtius finally got his wish. In early 1874 he signed an agreement with the Greek government that allowed German scholars to excavate Olympia and provided that the finds should be permanently displayed in a museum, built by the Germans, at the site. This contract marked the beginning of systematic excavations by government-supported agencies in the Mediterranean (it will be remembered that Schliemann financed himself) and became the model for similar arrangements on behalf of the British, French, and other schools in Greece. This negotiation was an act of the highest academic statesmanship, and the following of the model by others has furthered the scientific study of the Greek world while avoiding the plundering of Greek antiquities. Excavations at Olympia took place from fall 1875 to 1881; they were revived from 1936 to 1941 and have continued since 1952. The first results were edited by Curtius and Adler in five volumes; and here the scholarly work of Curtius moved into the scientific mode of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He was also\n\namong those who brought into existence the German Archaeological Institute in Athens. Curtius was especially noted for his addresses delivered on ceremonial occa­ sions, especially in the presence of the royal family or for the emperor’s birthday. Characteristic, for example, was his “Die Entwickelung des Preußischen Staats nach den Analogien der alten Geschichte” (1880), delivered on the anniversary of the accession of Friedrich II. He collected these orations in two volumes, to which a third, Unter drei Kaisern, was added. His many essays and papers were collected as Gesammelte Abhandlungen, and in his last years appeared his Die Stadtgeschichte von Athen. Curtius’ main scholarly monument was clearly his organization and editing of the excavations at Olympia, but, more than that, he inspired a generation of German scholars to become Hellenists. Others, such as his teacher Böckh, had indeed already devoted their lives to Greek studies, but Curtius contributed a love of the Greek landscape, long practical experience in Greece, and enthusiasm for his life work. He was from a deeply religious family, and all witnesses agree on his generous, affectionate personality. His Griechische Geschichte, though undeniably from another era so far as concerns historical accuracy and realism, is nonetheless a monument to that very era, to the earliest years of an independent Greece and to the time when the Hellenic message was rediscovered.\n\nBooks De portubus Athenarum commentatio.

W ith more coherence and rigor than such contemporaries as Pais and Bonfante, he successfully applied the German philological method to the study of scholarly problems larger and more complex than those that, up to his time, had been the subject of research by the dominant erudition, which tended to be antiquarian and archaeological in nature. De Sanctis was born in Rome a few days after the capture of the city had made it part of the unified national state. T he traumatic conclusion to the centuries-old temporal power of the popes was an event that had significant consequences in the years of his education. His early training took place in a climate marked by sharp tensions. O n the one hand were sentiments of devotion to the papacy and hostility to the new national government, sentiments shared by his entire family. O n the other hand was his adhesion to the new order of things, cultural in nature before it was political, which he developed as a young man. A climate of pride and hope reigned in Italy after the risorgimento, as well as the desire to give new life to a tradition of greatness that traced itself back to ancient Rome. De Sanctis, a fervent Catholic, had made up his mind to guard the free development of his personality both from the reactionary conditioning of his family as well as from the attitudes of the dominant positivistic lay culture. W hile completing his studies at the University of Rome, in a rather advanced cultural environment, he found ways to reinforce his independence of judgment through contact with teachers of various orientations: among others, the Hellenist Piccolomini, the prehistorian Pigorini, the archaeologist Loewy, the epigrapher Halbherr, and above all the ancient historian Karl Julius Beloch, a German who had been living in Italy for many years. It was from Beloch, as well as from other scholars with whom he soon came in contact, particularly those who were in charge of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut in\n\n43\n\nGAETANO\n\nRom, that De Sanctis derived a way of approaching classical antiquity that was far from rhetoric, not conditioned by nationalistic preconceptions, and placed on a rigorously scientific basis. Despite some differences, the relations of the rationalist Beloch and the Catholic De Sanctis were solid and deep. To the secure critical sense and realism derived from his teacher in the criticism of sources, the pupil joined interests of great range, which concentrated on the political and institutional aspects of ancient societies. A t the center of his studies he placed the life of the state in its juridical and military articulations as well as its religious and cultural manifestations. His first works show us De Sanctis as a precociously mature scholar capable of participating in the scholarly discussion of important topics. Significantly, his first work is dedicated to the Athenaion Politela of Aristotle (1892), the text of which had recently arrived at London and was published in 1891. Such timeliness from one who was still a student demonstrated a lively attention to current questions, but also a singular sharpness. He argued that Aristotle’s exposition was based on antiquarian sources of the fourth century, which should not be assumed to be superior to the information given us by the triad of great historians. It is still today a respectable view, while the thesis of Wilamowitz’s monumental Aristoteles und Athen, which appeared in the next year, that there existed annalistic sources from the sixth and fifth centuries, is today obsolete. This happy beginning happened to fall in years of important work for the study of the ancient world. Just then numerous wide-ranging and lasting works were appearing, such as those by Busolt (Die griechischen Staats- und Rechtsaltertümer, 1892), Meyer (Forsc/iungen zur alten Geschichte, I, 1892; Geschichte des Altertums, II, 1893), Pöhlmann (Geschichte des antiken Kommunismus und Socialismus, 1893), Rohde (Psy­ che, 1894). There was also Beloch’s Griechische Geschichte, a work very different from traditional introductory handbooks and innovative in its treatment of political and social problems. We should not forget that, even though Beloch was isolated from the world of Germany, he was nevertheless in fruitful correspondence with Meyer, whose teaching he mirrored and introduced to Italy. De Sanctis’s thesis (tesi di laurea) was devoted to the A thenian political history of the first half of the third century. It was subsequently published in Beloch’s journal as “Contributi alla storia ateniese dalla guerra ìamiaca alla guerra cremonidea” (1893). The young student showed himself capable of filling a void in the historiogra­ phy of the Greek world on the basis of fragmentary witnesses, both epigraphic and literary in nature. (Cf. Ferguson, Hellenistic Athens, London, 1911: vii). His interests in the next period led him to a deeper knowledge of “Questioni politiche e riforme sociali” in the third century. He worked on a terrain all the more fertile because it was far from the usual beaten paths, with its tired treatment by Italian historical research. The development of his scholarly personality tended to reinforce his deepest tendencies and sensibilities. He writes essays that confront problems in the religious beliefs of the Homeric poems (“La divinità omerica e la sua funzione sociale,” 1896; “L’anima e l’oltretomba secondo Omero,” 1897), where he is seen to have readily assimilated the lessons of Rohde. In other articles he demonstrated his vocation as\n\n-\n\n44\n\nDE S A N C T I S\n\nepigrapher (in this field he would produce excellent results and give birth to a school of high quality). Other articles represent his first steps as student of the Roman world. As an admirer of Eduard Meyer and to some degree a sharer of his vision of the centrality of the state,-De Sanctis consecrated his first large work (Αεε/tis, 1898) to the reconstruction of the process whereby the polis surpassed the limits of tribal structure and became a state. Wilamowitz’s severe judgment, in refusing to write a review of the book, was communicated privately to the author: it would be impossible for him to write on it without saying “dass das hier gegebene Bild der Geschichte ein Spiel der Willkür ist\" (letter of Wilamowitz to De Sanctis of 4 October 1898). The book received different and much more favorable opinions from many other reviewers. Théodore Reinach greeted the book’s appearance with enthusiasm and noted the high level that scholarship in Italy had reached thanks to Italians such as Comparetti and Vitelli and “metics” such as Holm and Beloch. The time had passed in which one could say a priori of an Italian book on Greek antiquity: italicum est, non legitur. He praised the book’s command of the facts and its mature critical sense, equidistant from credulity and extreme scepticism. This was no piling up of material but an organic rethinking of traditional facts and the hypotheses that had been formulated from them over the course of time. Att/iis seemed worthy of the same interest that had greeted the great books of Wilamowitz and Busolt (REG [1898] 435-436). In 1900 De Sanctis became ordinarius at Turin, where he taught Greek and Roman history in alternate years. He stayed there until 1929 and had as students, among others, Luigi Pareti, Aldo Ferrabino, Mario Attilio Levi, and, finally, the keenest and most versatile of all his students, Arnaldo Momigliano. The memories of his activity as a teacher indicate that the seminar was more congenial to him than lecturing. In seminars he shone in his ability to guide students by furnishing them with the necessary facts so that their intuition caught fire. It is significant that his commemoration of Mommsen at the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino began with a phrase of Otto Seeck’s: “Teaching reveals a a man’s nature. In no other area is there a clearer manifestation of the good and bad characteristics of one’s scholarly personality than in his effect on his students.” In his first decade at Turin articles appeared that began from epigraphical and archaeological discoveries. The latter took account of the results of the Italian excavations at Crete, directed by Federico Halbherr. Several articles also dealt with papyrology. “Una nuova pagina di storia siciliana,” 1905, deals with a new papyrus, variously, attributed, that De Sanctis held to be by Philistus; “L’Attide di Androzione e un papiro di Oxyrhynchos” attributes to the Atthidographer the so-called “Oxyrhychus Histories.” But it ought to be said that the work has an annalistic structure and adopts the Thucydidean framework. Many of the articles of these years came together in 1909 in a “libro di battaglia” (as the author called it): Per la scienza dell’antichità. Saggi e polemiche. Besides articles on Homeric subjects, he reprinted a speech, La guerra e la pace nell’antichità, an opening lecture from 1904. The topic was a polemical treatment of a recent book by the Marxist historian Ciccotti (Laguena e la pace nel mondo antico, Turin, 1901). De\n\nGAETANO\n\nSanctis echoed this title almost literally and developed his ideas further in an appendix, “Intorno al materialismo storico.” De Sanctis claimed as the historian’s role the “intuition of the reality of life” that hides behind documents, as well as the precise interpretation of those documents. De Sanctis attached himself explicitly to the teaching of Benedetto Croce and attacked the exponents of other historical currents: Bonfante for his sociological schematism, Pais for his prejudiced skepticism toward tradition, Ferrerò for his dilettantism. De Sanctis’s tone as a polemicist is energetic, on fire. “He felt pleasure in opposing, provoking, challenging,” Momigliano remembered. He was himself later the victim of several polemical assaults by his teacher. The 1909 book was intended to give a theoretical foundation to the great work he had started in 1907 and that would accompany De Sanctis through his life as Lebenswerk: the Storia dei Romani. The first two volumes of the history were intended to counter analogous reconstructions recently published in Italy, above all Pais’s Storia dei Romani. They begin with the remoter periods and then give a lively reconstruction of the Regal era and the period of the early republic on the basis of a systematic reconsideration of all the epigraphical and archaeological material known up to that point, as well as the literary tradition. The clear narrative exposition was joined as far as possible to a critical analysis, which tripped up the development of the narrative every now and again. Here too, as in the Act/us, the basic theme of the work is the analysis of the city becoming a state. The Storia dei Romani contains more transient aspects, as is only natural in a synthesis of such proportions, and even annoying elements. A certain phil-aryan racism was a constant factor in the man and in the scholar, a factor that often returns to the concept of “inferior races” and “sterile cultures” (Oriental, Semitic) from which Western civilization had to guard itself. (“Civiltà caduche e civiltà perenne” [“Tran­ sient cultures and lasting civilization”] is the title of an essay of 1943 on this topic.) These attitudes in historiography are in complete harmony with his position in 1911 in favor of Italian colonial expansion in Libya, in the name of the diffusion of a higher civilization, Catholic and Roman (not to mention an increased national power). Once he had put himself on this dangerous slope, even though he was a lover of personal and political liberty, he could not then condemn Fascist aggression in Ethiopia in the thirties. Because of his hatred of England, the opponent of Italian pretenses in the Mediterranean, he will view Germany’s cause in the Second World War with relative sympathy. O n the eve of the First World War he had publicly taken the position that Italy should remain neutral, the position of Benedetto Croce and the young philolo­ gist, Giorgio Pasquali. He did this both out of sympathy for the German world and its culture and because of his conservative political vision for which conflict, in the presence of strong social differences, represented a potential danger for the state system and constituted order. After Italy entered the war, like ail conservative Catholics, he abstained from further manifestations in favor of neutrality. In 1916-1917 De Sanctis published the two fascicles of volume III of Storia dei Romani, which was mainly devoted to political and military affairs. In the preface the\n\n- 46 -\n\nDE S A N C T I S\n\nauthor pointed out the similarity between the warlike background in which his work was written and the material it treated, but he dissuaded his reader from seeking easy and mechanical analogies between strategies and events that were apparently similar. (Many years later, in his late work Pericle of 1944, he found analogies of a political nature attractive, as he saw the end of Periclean Athens relived in the light of the tragedy that Italy was undergoing in those years.) The numerous appendices were rich in learning. Their outstanding aspect is a careful scrutiny of the sources for the history of the Punic Wars, but it is meaningful also for its treatment of “Dido in the GrecoRoman tradition,” where, in the learned discussion on the sources of that character’s legend, we find sensitive notes on the Virgilian version. In promising in the preface that the following volume would contain a general historical picture of Roman culture (such as he had to some degree given in volume III for Rome’s enemy, Carthage), De Sanctis perhaps noticed the limits of an undertaking substantially closed to the new problems that had been placed before the attention of scholars, problems confronted by recent significant works on Roman history, such as Rostovtzeff on Roman colonies (1910), Warde Fowler on the religion of the Roman people (1911), and Gelzer in the prosopographical area. So, drawing his inspiration perhaps from Beloch’s Geschichte, he will devote an entire large section of his Storia to the literature and religious life of Rome. During the crisis that followed the First World War, when Italy was lacerated with serious political battles and social conflict, De Sanctis felt it necessary to participate directly in political life. He enrolled in the Partito Popolare, whose principles of devotion to the Church inspired an essentially conservative politics. In the years from 1919 to 1921 he was a candidate in political and administrative elections. His scholarly writing reflected these interests, although never in a fashion that was crudely “relevant.” In 1920 he published an essay on “Dopoguera antico,” in 1921 one on “Rivoluzione e reazione nell’età dei Gracchi.” The latter closed with words that might seem prophetic of what was waiting for Italy in just a little while. W ith the death of Scipio Aemilianus, wrote De Sanctis, “there was no longer anything to stop the fierce strife between revolutionaries and reactionaries. Therefore the people who were the masters of the world hastened to pay for its own imperialism, by bowing its head under the yoke of military monarchy.” It is in this spirit that we should understand the dedication/epigraph that opens volume four of the Storia dei Romani, which was already circulating before the March on Rome (Polverini, A SN P 3 [1973] 1056): A quei pochissimi / che hanno parimente a sdegno i d’essere oppressi e di farsi opresssori. (“To those very few who scorn equally the role of oppressed and oppres­ sor.”) W ith this volume, devoted to the great conquests and their political conse­ quences (which were negative according to his condemnation of imperialistic expan­ sionism, a condemnation made in ethical language), the writing of the work was interrupted for about twenty years. W hen he took it up again, it had become some­ thing rather different. In the twenties, when De Sanctis had achieved full scholarly maturity and even international recognition of his worth (he received a degree honoris\n\n-\n\n47\n\n-\n\nGAETANO\n\ncausa from Oxford in 1925), his research was directed toward the themes of the history of historiography. He would later collect the articles that came from this period devoted to Hecataeus, Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Sallust, and Livy in the volumes Problemi di storia antica (1932) and Stuà di storia della storiografia greca (1951). From 1923 De Sanctis’s work became more and more devoted to cultural organization. In that year he assumed, together with the philologist and man of letters Augusto Rostagni, the editorship of Italy’s oldest and most prestigious classical journal, Rivista italiana di filologia e di istruzione classica. He published there from time to time notes on Greek epigraphy (he was the head of the research group working on the inscriptions from Cyrenaica and Crete), “Cronache e commenti,” and many book reviews. A n especially important book review was devoted to Rostovtzeff s Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire in 1926. Rostovtzeff was a foreign scholar to whom De Sanctis was bound by ties of true friendship. W ith the Fascist regime established in power, De Sanctis became involved, as did almost all Italian intellectuals of note, with the Enciclopedia Italiana, a cultural initiative of great prestige, supported by the government, which intended to make itself deserving of respect in the scholarly arena. This gigantic enterprise took a decade to reach its successful conclusion. De Sanctis was head of the Section for Classical Antiquity. He was given this position by Giovanni Gentile, the theoretical philosopher of fascism and scholarly director of the Enciclopedia, who nourished the greatest esteem for De Sanctis and served as his political patron on more than one occasion. In a climate of openness and tolerance notable for a totalitarian regime, De Sanctis worked for the success of the enterprise with a rhythm that was prodigious. He allowed the printing of no article without a careful reading and revision, often intervening, correcting, and improving. The articles on classical antiquity, entrusted to the greatest classicists, are admirable and can often still be useful today for their high level of information and scholarly originality. Among De Sanctis’s collaborators I would record, for the philological side, Giorgio Pasquali, and then Momigliano (his student in ancient history from the last years at Turin), Fraccaro, Rostagni; from outside Italy, Maas and Rostovtzeff contributed articles. Meanwhile, in 1929, De Sanctis moved to Rome as Professor of Greek History, filling the chair that had been Beloch’s. His teaching in the capital was soon interrupted. In 1931 all university professors were asked to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime. De Sanctis refused and was removed from his chair, losing at the same time the use of the university buildings and libraries. He was among the few, some ten in all Italy, to give this example of intellectual honesty in opposing the dictatorship. His old age was rendered harsh, besides the material problems attendant on his loss of work, from progressive blindness, even though voluntary readers were always present. It was in these difficult conditions that he began to work on another great work of synthesis, the Storia dei Greci (1939). Already in the early ’30s he had returned to the history of the Greeks, the land of political liberty and free and critical thought. The volume Problemi di storia antica, published with timely solidarity by the anti-Fascist publishing house of Laterza soon after he lost his chair, began significantly\n\nDE S A N C T I S\n\nwith the 1930 essay “Essenza e carattere della storia greca,” in which Ferrabino’s La dissoluzione della libertà nella Grecia antica (1929) was implicitly discussed and criti­ cized. It was under De Sanctis’s guidance that the young Treves worked on Demostene e la libertà dei Greci (1933). The Storia dei Greci in the form in which it was published appeared without scholarly apparatus. It reflected scholarly positions that the author had matured much earlier and did not intend to open up again to discussion, e.g. the Doric invasion of Greece. It took no account of additions to knowledge that were being achieved in those years in the area of anthropology. It remains a work of great originality, where the prejudice in favor of national political unity coexists with a leading idea of great force and civil value, the idea of history as the ethical and political history of liberty. The influence of the liberal Croce on the Catholic De Sanctis could not be more evident. So in his less successful Pericle (1944) he repeated his thesis that the Duce of Athens had caused the collapse of Athens by an irrespon­ sible pursuit of imperialist objectives, a formulation that had to appear to allude to the present. The last part of his life was devoted to working on his great work, which was destined to remain unfinished, the Storia dei Romani. The second part of volume IV was already finished when, sharing a common fate with the Thucydides commentary of Gomme, the only copy was stolen. W ith a brave heart the old scholar devoted himself to reconstructing it. The first fascicle appeared in 1953, dedicated to religious, literary, and artistic aspects of the age of the conquests, while the second was published posthumously in 1957 and discussed the evolution of juridical institutions. The author did not live to reconstruct the treatment of economic and financial aspects. As in the Storia dei Greci, these last fascicles are not based on research and analysis but on a clear synthesis able to dominate an enormous field of knowledge. W ith the fall of Fascism, he was restored to teaching and named Professor of Greek History for life. He became the president of the Enciclopedia Italiana. Aside from his boundless productivity, the universal approbation accorded De Sanctis is based on his work as the head of a school. He showed respect to the human and scholarly personality of his students and was incapable in his relations with them of being conditioned by preconceptions, such as those concerning Indo-Europeans or the West, to which he was by no means immune. He had among his best students intellectuals of the most varied views: liberals and democrats like Momigliano and Treves, liberals and then Catholics like Ferrabino, Catholics like Accame, Fascists like Pareti and Levi. Mussolini himself intervened to brake the university careers of the numerous Jewish students of his school (Momigliano, Levi, Treves) in his preoc­ cupation to guarantee an orthodox nationalistic imprint on the teaching of ancient history, and Roman history in particular. The school of epigraphy created by him (Guarducci, Moretti) has produced notable results. A t the beginning of this century, in commemorating Mommsen, De Sanctis proudly proclaimed the rebirth of the study of ancient history in Italy. Everyone today acknowledges that that rebirth is due principally to him. Translated by E. Christian Kopff - 49 -\n\nGAETANO DESANCTIS\n\nG A E T A N O DE S A N C T I S\n\nBooks Α ΤΘ ΙΣ.

SC H Ü T R U M P F University of C olorado a t Boulder\n\nH\n\nermann Alexander Diels, Ordinarius at the University of Berlin from 1886 to 1920, edited texts such as the Fragmente der Vorsokratiker that changed the course of study of early Greek philosophy, organized scholarly projects such as the Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca and the Corpus Medicorum Graecorum that are still indispensable for modem scholarship, was a member of the Berlin Academy, and for twenty-five years was permanent secretary of its philosophical-historical section. He was also honored as a Knight of the Ordre pour le ménte, as well as a corresponding or honorary member of numerous academies in Europe and overseas. He was born on 18 May 1848 in Biebrich (on the Rhine), the son of a railroad stationmaster. His father had intended that Hermann be a salesman, but the young Diels protested, finally getting his way, and was allowed to attend the Gymnasium in Wiesbaden (1858-1867). Nevertheless, his father still insisted that Hermann learn a trade, so Diels learned the profession of bookbinding. He bound many of the books in his own library, which bear witness to his skill (after his death Diels’s library was acquired by the University of Louvain). Strong reinforcement to commit himself to classics came from his uncle Karl Rossel (1815-1872), who had a Ph.D. from the Uni­ versity of Göttingen (with a thesis, De philosophia Socratis, in 1837). Diels’s schoolboy hobby of experimenting in chemistry and his interest in technical matters remained throughout his career and aided his work on ancient technology. His father, in addition to being a stationmaster, started several businesses (such as breeding silk­ worms) in order to finance his son’s studies; all failed. His first year of study of classical philology (spring 1867-1868) at the Univer­ sity of Berlin was on the whole disappointing. The only teachers Diels respected were J. G. Droysen (1808-1884) and, to a much lesser degree, Moriz Haupt (1808-1874). In 1867 Diels signed up for the seminar of August Böckh (born 1785), who became\n\nDIELS\n\ntoo ill to complete the course and died the same year (1867). Diels continued his studies (spring 1868) at the University of Bonn under Otto Jahn, as well as under Jahn’s successor, Franz Bücheier (1837-1908), and in particular Hermann Usener. Fellow students were Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Georg Kaibel ( 1849-1901 ), and Carl Robert (1850-1922). As a third-year student under Usener’s guidance he started exploring the relationship of the collections of Placita phibsophorum in Plu­ tarch, Stobaeus, and Galen, a study from which Diels’s Doxographi finally evolved. Diels mentions in his (unpublished and now lost) memoirs on his earlier years that the librarian Jacob Bernays (1824-1881), whose contributions to Aristotelian scholarship are still being discussed today, denied him access to some holdings of the library. For his work on the Placita Diels received the Faculty Prize in 1869. He graduated as Doctor of Philosophy with a thesis on De Galeni historia philosopha in 1870. For four months he traveled to Austria and Italy studying Greek manuscripts and searching for texts of florilegia. A t the Archeological Institute in Rome he got to know a number of scholars, among them Rudolf Hirzel (1846-1917). Financial constraints did not allow him to prepare for the “Habilitation” (therefore, he never was “Privatdozent”) and forced him to teach at Gymnasia, first in Flensburg, then, from 1873 to 1877, at the Gelehrtenschule of the Johanneum in Hamburg (called by him the “Hamburg galley”). He worked regularly from 7 A.M. to 1 A.M. Moral support from Usener and Eduard Zeller (1814-1908) helped him perse­ vere. Diels respected both men most highly and kept up a correspondence with each over many years. During this time, Zeller had invited Diels to participate in projects to be undertaken by the Berlin Academy. W hen the Academy announced a prize in 1874 for the best study on Pseudo-Plutarch’s Placita, Diels submitted the manuscript of the Doxographi Graeci and won the award in July 1877. The first part of the Doxographi Graeci (1879) contains a prolegomena, in which Diels attempted to demonstrate that the ancient texts dealing with the opinions of the philosophers go back to Theophrastus’ Physikai doxai. He showed how excerpts were used by later authors for their excerpts and he attributed a crucial role to Aétius (first or second century A.D.), whose Ξυναγωγη περί αρεσκόντων Diels regarded as one of the most important sources for the literature on the opinions of the philosophers. The volume contains an edition of the texts of the Doxographi and a large index. It has been said by O tto Regenbogen that Diels’ Doxographi Graeci presents a new kind of scholarship in a new area applying a new method: Diels introduced the study of the tradition of Greek philosophy. By analyzing the relationships of dependencies between the different sources, he placed the research on the history of Greek philosophy on a new basis. Naturally, it was unavoidable that some of Diels’s results would be rejected, in particular his recon­ struction of Aétius out of texts of Stobaeus and Plutarch, about whose validity there is serious doubt today. In the fall of 1877 Diels moved to Berlin where he became a regular teacher at the Königstädtische Gymnasium. Soon afterward, upon the recommendation of Edu­ ard Zeller, he was appointed editor of the edition of the Commentaria in Aristotelem\n\n- 53\n\nHE RM A N N\n\nGraeca undertaken by the Berlin Academy. He succeeded Adolf Torstrik, who had been the editor of this project but under whom not a single volume was published. Diels organized the series as an international project, including scholars from England (Ingram Bywater; Frederic Kenyon), Denmark (J. L. Heiberg), Italy (Girolamo Vitelli), and Greece (Spyridon Lambros). Under Diels’s direction it was completed in 1909, comprising 23 volumes plus 3 volumes Supplementum Aristotelicum. It was Zeller who, supported by Mommsen, Hermann Bonitz, Adolf Kirchhoff, and Johannes Vahlen, recommended that Diels be elected an ordinary member of the Berlin Academy. W hen Diels became a member of the Academy in August 1881, he was still employed as a teacher at the Königstädtische Gymnasium, a post he did not leave until fall 1882. Contemporaries say that the decade he served as a schoolmaster shaped his personality, even his way of teaching at the university and the style of his many public addresses and speeches. In 1882 he received his first appointment at the University of Berlin as Extraordinarius for Classical Philology in the Philosophical Faculty. In the following years he received and turned down calls to the chairs of classics at the Universities of Gießen (1883), Greifswald (1885), and Heidelberg (1886). In 1886 he was promoted to Ordinarius in Berlin. He taught there until his retirement in 1920. As colleagues he had Wilamowitz (from 1897) and Eduard Norden (from 1906). All of them dedicated works to one another: Wilamowitz dedicated his Platon (1919) to Diels; Diels his edition of Lucretius (1923) to Wilamowitz; Norden dedicated his Die germanische Urgeschichte in Tacitus’ Germania (1920) to Diels, proving the high respect these scholars had for each other despite all their differences in personality and style (Diels disapproved of the injurious harshness with which Wilamowitz dealt with colleagues). In order to concentrate on scholarship, Diels turned down the offers from Mommsen to become editor of Hermes and of the Deutsche Literaturzeitung, but in 1888 he cofounded the Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie, in whose first volume he published a research report on the presocratics, something he continued in 1889 and 1891. Diels’s edition of books I-IV of Simplicius’ commentary to Aristotle’s Physics (CAG IX [Berlin 1.882]) was the first volume of the whole series of Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca to appear. His edition of the other four books of Simplicius’ commentary followed in 1895, and he contributed to this series as well the Anonymi Londinensis ex Aristotelis Iatricis Menoniis et aliis medicis eclogae (Suppi Aristotelicum voi. Ill, 1893). While working on Simplicius he had already conceived the idea of collecting the fragments of the presocratic philosophers. In the preface to his edition of the first four books of Simplicius’ Commentary on the Physics (1882) he announced a plan to edit the presocratic philosophers that would be fulfilled more than twenty years later. In his first position, as Extraordinarius at the University of Berlin, Diels succeeded F. W. A. Mullach (1807-1882), whose boring teaching he had detested even as a student. Mullach had edited a collection of fragments of Greek philosophers, which comprised the fragments of presocratics in volumes I (1860) and II (1867). This\n\n- 54 -\n\nDIELS\n\ncollection did not satisfy even the most modest standards of scholarship, and the articles published by Diels since 1880 (many of which are reprinted in the Kleine Schriften) prove that presocratic philosophy already occupied his mind at that time. Editions by Diels of Parmenides (1897), Heraclitus (1901), and, in the same year, the poetic fragments of Greek philosophers were harbingers of his edition of Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (1903). The principles of his approach to both the transmitted texts of presocratic philosophy and the tradition of textual criticism had already displayed his virtuosity (for example, in transposing the order of lines in the transmitted text). These principles appear already in the preface to his Parmenides, where he claims more modest intentions, namely, not to bring the Eleatic philosopher up to the heights "
