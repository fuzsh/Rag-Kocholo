        "text": "Notes\n\n1 G. Sarton, “Acta atque agenda,” Arch. internat. d’histoire des sciences 30, 322–356 (1951). Sudhoff was the founder of the Mitteilungen zur Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften (40 vols.; 1902-1942), which, as the title indicated, was devoted to the history first, of medicine, and second, of science.\n\n2 I used the second revised edition of vols. 1-4 (1896, 1898, 1899, 1900) and the first of vol. 5 (1899).\n\n3 A list of them, in order of death years, may be convenient: Paul Tannery (1843–1904); Hermann Diels (1848–1922); Alfred Croiset (1845–1923); Johan Ludvig Heiberg (1854–1928); Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (1848–1931), Maurice Croiset (1846–1935), Sir Thomas Little Heath (1861–1940), Joseph Bidez (1867–1945), Franz Cumont (1868-1947).\n\n4 Witness the Incas of Peru, whose civilization was very complex and advanced. They had an elaborate language but no system of writing, [ Isis 6, 219 (1923–24)].\n\n5 William Henry Hudson remarked, “It is sad to reflect that all our domestic animals have descended to us from those ancient times which we are accustomed to regard as dark or barbarous, while the effect of our modern so-called humane civilization has been purely destructive to animal life. Not one type do we rescue from the carnage going on at an ever-increasing rate over all the globe.” The naturalists in La Plata (London: Chapman and Hall, 1892), p. 233. The only animal domesticated in historic times is the ostrich [ Isis 10, 278 (1928)]; this was a poor achievement, which was justified only because some women and generals wanted feathers for their hats.\n\n6 Wheels remained unknown in the Americas; see Isis 9, 139 (1927).\n\n7 The finest weaving, that of silk, was invented by the Chinese in times immemorial. Consider what the invention implied–the domestication of an insect, the “education” of silkworms, the cultivation of the white mulberry, the whole of sericulture! The Chinese ascribe the first idea of sericulture and silk weaving to Hsi-ling Shih , the lady of Hsi-ling (in Hupeh), consort of the mythical Yellow Emperor, Huang Ti , supposed to have ruled from 2698 to 2598 B.C. It must be added that the earliest specimens of silk that have come to us date only from the Han dynasty.\n\n8 It is often called Brazilian, but is used also in other parts of South America than Brazil. See a map of its distribution in Albert Métraux, La civilisation matérielle des tribus Tupi-Guarani (Paris, 1928) [ Isis 13, 248 (1929–30)], p. 114. See also Victor W. von Hagen, “The bitter cassava eaters,” Natural History (New York, March 1949), with many illustrations.\n\n9 Yang Shao culture, so called after the place Yang Shao Tsun in Honan; latest stone age. See J. Cunnar Anderson, Children of the yellow earth (London: Kegan Paul, 1934), pp. 221, 330 [ Isis 23, 274 (1935)].\n\n10 In a lecture delivered at the Second International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences, Oslo, 1936, and referred to by Vilhjalmur Stefansson in his Ultima Thule (New York: Macmillan, 1940), p. 31, and Greenland (New York: Doubleday, 1942), p. 26 [ Isis 34, 379 (1942-43)].\n\n11 J. M. de Navarro, “Prehistoric routes between Northern Europe and Italy defined by the amber trade,” Geographical J. 66, 481-507 (1925); maps, referring to the Bronze and Early Iron Ages.\n\n12 Some iden of the earliest iron metallurgy may be obtained from E. Wyndham Hulme, “Prehistoric and primitive iron smelting,” Trans. Newcomen Soc. 18, 181–192 (1937–38); 21, 23–30 (1940–41). The best book on early metallurgy now available is R. J. Forbes, Metallurgy in antiquity(Leiden : Brill, 1950).\n\n13 According to the interpretation by W. Max Müller, in his Egyptological researches. Results of a journey in 1904 (Washington : Camegie Institution, 1906), p. 61, pl. 106, of a monument ( Fig. 10 ) in the necropolis of aqq ra of the beginning of the Sixth Dynasty (c. 2625–2475). It is true that Jean Capart, Une rue de tombeaux à Saqqarah (2 vols., Brussels, 1907), vol. 1, p. 51; vol. 2, pl. lxvi, does not accept that interpretation unreservedly. At any rate, stone knives arc mentioned in Exodus 4:25 and Joshua 5:2 (the translation of harbot zurim in the Authorized Version by “sharp knives” is wrong; the correct meaning is “flint knives”).\n\n14 Auguste Edouard Mariette (1821-1881), French Egyptologist.\n\n15 A perforated disk of stone (or torra cotta) slipped along a spindle, acting by its weight as a flywheel, causing the spindle to rotate more steadily.\n\n16 This process of discovery and selection is the more mysterious, because (like the creation of language) it is largely unconscious. The following remarks, taken from Carl Binger, The doctor’s job (New York: Norton, 1945), p. 153, will fascinate the reader as they did me. “Dr. Curt Richter of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, whose ingenious and important experiments on white rats I shall presently refer to, tells the story of a three-and-a-half-year-old boy who was admitted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with a tumor of the adrenal gland–a fatal disease. The child had the habit of eating salt by the handful. He took to it as another child might to sugar or to jam. When he entered the hospital his salt-eating habit was stopped and he was put on the regular hospital diet. Unfortunately, he died soon thereafter. Now it appears that this child had discovered independently what it has taken experimental scientists many years to find out–that patients suffering from lesions of the adrenal glands are greatly benefited by the addition of large quantities of common salt to the diet.\n\nDr. Richter’s white rats are also gifted scientists. He has shown that on a mixed standard diet of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, plus minerals and vitamins, the rats will maintain a predictable rate of growth and weight increase. Now if he offers his rats the ingredients of the diet unmixed they will still select just what they need to continuo their growth and development at the usual rate. But even more remarkable is the fact that whereas a normal rat will consume relatively little salt a rat whose adrenal glands have been surgically removed will quickly and automatically increase its salt intake sufficiently to survive, whereas cagemates, similarly operated upon, will die when allowed only the normal salt ingredient in their diets. Rats deprived of their parathyroid glands will eat enough calcium to keep themselves alive and free from tetany. If the rats could consult medical literature they would find that calcium is given to babies with tetany as it is to adults whose parathyroid glands have been removed during an operation for goiter. Rats fed on thyroid extract develop a morbid appetite for weak solutions of iodine, the standard medicine given to patients whose thyroid glands are overactive.”\n\n17 There is a considerable literature on the subject. See, for example, Stéphen-Chauvet, La médecine chez les peuples primitifs (Paris: Librairie Maloine, 1936); Henry E. Sigerist, History of medicine (New York: Oxford University Press, 1951), vol. 1 [Isis 42, 278–281 (1951)]. Sigerist’s volume had not yet appeared when I wrote this chapter.\n\n18 Franz M. Feldhaus, Die Technik (Leipzig, 1914), p. 115.\n\n19 Though means of intoxicating or benumbing him may already have been available. Such means were used very early in mary parts of the world.\n\n20 The Chinese name of the sexagenary cycle, chia tz , is made up of the names of the first stem chia and of the first branch tz . The names of the twelve branches are names of animals (as for the zodiac) ; tz is the rat.\n\n21 It is interesting to compare the Chinese calendar with the Maya, for each was as independent of the other as if they had developed on different planets. The Mayas enmeshed a civil year ( haab ) of 365 days with a sacred year (tzolkin) of 260 days; this implied a great year or a “year bundle” as they called it (xiuhmolpilli) of 18,980 days ( - 52 haab - 73 tzolkin). For details, see Silvanus Griswold Morley (1883-1948), The ancient Maya (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1946). pp. 265-274 [ Isis 37, 245 (1947) ; 39, 241 (1948)].\n\n22 For the fives, see synoptic table in Isis 22, 270 (1934-35).\n\n23 W. F. Mayers, Chinese reader’s manual (Shanghai, 1874).\n\n24 Alfred Russel Wallace, The Malay archipelago (London, 1869), chap. 12. Lombok is one of the smaller islands lying between Java and Australia; its western coast faces Bali.\n\n25 There were still other bases, for which see Levi Leonard Conant, The number concept (New York, 1896). For the decimal ones, see G. Sarton, “Decimal systems early and late,” Osiris 9, 581–601 (1950).\n\n26 Counting on the feet was natural enough in warm countries where people remain barefooted. In many languages, for example, Greek, Latin, and Arabic, the same words are used for fingers and toes; if more precision is needed, the latter are called fingers of the foot.\n\n27 Consider our own language. To count up to a hundred we need nineteen words: one, two, . . . ten; twenty, . . ., ninety; hundred; but we must remember a few modifications of them for the second decade, as eleven (for one ten), twelve, thirteen, . . ., nineteen. To count up to 999,999 we need only one more word, thousand.\n\n28 One may see in the National Museum, Washington, D. C., five bundles of reeds which constituted a census made by the Comanche Indians (originally in western Wyoming, later ranging widely between Kansas and northern Mexico). These bundles indicate respectively the number of women in the village, the number of young men, the number of warriors, the number of children, and the number of lodges. They were collected by Edward Palmer in the 1880’s (letter from Alexander Wetmore, Washington, D. C., 20 June 1944).\n\n29 Its meaning is not yet agreed upon; for the English — in this, more logical than we are — it is 10 ¹² ; for us, 100.\n\n30 Witness the words (popular creations!) duodeviginti and undecentum in Latin and triacosi n apodeonta myria in Greek; these words mean 18, 99, 9700.\n\n31 The Latin word cubitum means elbow, but also the distance from the elbow to the end of the middle finger.\n\n32 In the northern hemisphere.\n\n33 Lucifer, He sphoros , or Ph sphoros, and Hesperus or Hesperos ; the identity of the two stars may have been recognized very early, but we cannot tell how early. Both are identical with the planet Venus, Aphrodit s ast r. In low latitudes (that is, in the subtropical countries where a higher culture began) it was possible to observe another couple, the morning star Apollo ( Apoll n ) and the evening star Mercurius ( Hermés ), both identical with the planet Mercury. One could not fail to see Mercury even in latitudes as high as 50°.\n\n34 No attempt has been made to discuss the mixed origins of science and magic, and we might add of religion and art, because a sufficient account of the facts involved would cover too much space. The reader will find an excellent account of those moot questions in “Magic, science and religion,” by the late Bronislaw Malinowski, in Joseph Needham, ed., Science, religion and reality (New York, 1928), pp. 19–84 [ Isis 36, 50 (1946) 1, with bibliography. See also M. F. Ashley Montagu, “Bronislaw Malinowski, 1884–1942,” Isis 34, 146–150 (1942).\n\n35 The lower courses of the two last named are distinctly tropical, and to is the Ganges estuary.\n\n36 Osiris 2, 410 (1936).\n\n37 There was no glacial period in Egypt, and hence no Interruption of its prehistoric development. This gave Egypt a tremendous but incalculable advantage over other countries.\n\n38 Isis 37, 96 (1947).\n\n39 I use throughout the “short” chronology, according to which the first king of the First Dynasty, Menes, began to rule c. 3400. Other chronologists would place him much earlier, the extreme dating being that of Champollion-Figeac, 5867! For an explanation and justification of the “short” chronology, see James Henry Breasted, Ancient records of Egypt (Chicago, 1906), vol. 1, pp. 25–48. One should always mention the dynasty; I have done so.\n\n40 From hieros, sacred, and glyphein, to engrave.\n\n41 It should be borne in mind that hieroglyphics or other conventional signs are easier to read, if one knows them, than alphabetic writing, and therefore such signs are introduced into every language, especially into the scientific language. Consider the signs used to convey astronomical, chemical, mathematical meanings, or more homely ones such as $ for dollar, or the ampersand, &. The weakness of all such signs is that one cannot understand them at all unless one is already familiar with them, whereas everybody can read such words as “Venus,” “ascending node,” or “antimony,” and look them up in the dictionary, if necessary.\n\n42 For further discussion and exemplification, see Won Kenn ( = Huang Chüan-shêng), Origine et évolution de l‘écriture hiéroglyphique et de l’écri-ture chinoise (Lyons: Bosc Frères and Riou, 1939).\n\n43 Joseph de Guignes (1721–1800), Mémoire dans lequel on prouve que les Chinois sont une colonie égyptienne (Paris, 1759; 59 p., 1 pl.).\n\n44 Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, Egyptian dictionary (London, 1920), p. xiv.\n\n45 Simeone Levi, Vocabolario geroglifico-copto-ebraico (10 parts in 3 vols.; Turin, 1887–1894).\n\n46 Just as the Semitic elements of Egyptian have been exaggerated by some scholars, so the Egyptian elements in the Old Testament have been exaggerated by others, for example Abraham Shalom Yahuda, The language of the Pentateuch in its relation to Egypt (London: Oxford University Press, 1933).\n\n47 J. D. S. Pendlebury, Aegyptiaca. A catalogue of Egyptian objects in the Aegean area (Cambridge: The University Press, 1930) [ Isis 18, 379 (1932–33)].\n\n48 It is no longer found in those marshes but still flourishes in the Sudan. Would its disappearance from the Deltn be due to exhaustive use of it in ancient and medieval times? According to Pliny, who gives much information on papyrus (Natural history, XIII, 21–27), there was such a scarcity of it under Tiberius (emperor, 14–37), that senators were obliged to regulate its distribution. Thus paper rationing is not a novelty of our own day!\n\n49 A reed was not used until much later (Greco-Roman times); it is still used by natives today (qalam).\n\n50 Relatively cheap. Papyrus was never as cheap or abundant as handmade paper was, not to mention the paper of today which is so cheap that it is continually wasted for vain and vile purposes. Papyrus was always a de luxe material. We know but little about its early production, but for later times see Naphtali Lewis, L’industrie du papyrus dans l’Egypte greco-romaine (200 pp.; Paris: Rod-stain, 1934) [Isis 35, 245 (1944)].\n\n51 A good example of this is the use of palm leaves for writing in Ceylon and India. They used the leaves of talipot ( Corypha umbraculifera ), which grows in Ceylon and Malabar, and produced a kind of papyrus, in narrow strips, called olla. Unfortunately, the climate of India was not as favorable for the preservation of olla documents as that of Egypt was for papyrus.\n\n52 Then clay tablets used in Mesopotamia were excellent from the point of view of preservation of separate items, but did not make possible the invention of anything comparable to a roll, and hence the integrity of long documents was jeopardized.\n\n53 Papal bulls were published on papyrus until 1022. Pontificum Romanorum Diplomata papyracea quae supercunt in tabulariis Hispaniac, Italiae, Germaniae, phototypice expressa fussu Pii PP.XI consilio et opera procuratorum Bibliothecac Apostolicae Vaticanae (18 pp., 15 facsimiles on 43 pls.; Rome, 1929).\n\n54 Hieraticos = priestly (because the scribes were popular. generally clerics); enchõrios = rural, d moticos =\n\n55 Alexander Pogo, “Three unpublished calendars from Asy t,” Osiris 1, 500–509 (1936); 10 pls., 3 figs., 1 table.\n\n56 Sothis = Sirius = cy n = Dog Star. The “dog days” or “canicular days” refer to the hot period beginning with Sothis’ heliacal rising (that is, the first observable rising of Sothis at dawn). The date of that rising varies with the latitude and changes slowly in the course of time. It was 19 July in Roman times, and is now 21 July Julian ( = 3 August Gregorian) for Memphis. It is not clear to me how well the heliacal rising could be observed, for this implies the ability to distinguish a star when its elongation from the sun is less than, say, 1°.\n\n57 Carl Schoch, “Die Länge der Sothisperiode beträgt 1456 Jahre.” Astron. Abhandl., Ergän-zungshefte Astron. Nachr. 8, no. 2, B9–B10 (1930).\n\n58 Breasted, Ancient records of Egypt (vol. 1, p. 30 ).\n\n59 They have been elaborately discussed by Ludwig Borchardt, Altägyptische Zeitmessung (folio, 70 pp., 18 pls., 25 figs.; Berlin, 1920) [ Isis 4, 612 (1921–22)].\n\n60 Henry Honeychurch Gorringe, Egyptian obelisks (folio, 197 pp., 51 pls.; New York, 1882); Edward Bell, The architecture of ancient Egypt (280 pp., 1 map; London, 1915); Reginald Engelbach, The problem of the obelisks, From a study of the unfinished obelisk at Asw n (134 pp., 44 figs.; London, 1923), valuable for technical details, but inferior for historical matters; Somers Clarke and R. Engelbach, Ancient Egyptian masonry. The building craft (258 pp., 269 ills.; London, 1930); Alfred Lucas, Ancient Egyptian materials and industries (480 pp.; rev. ed., London, 1934); Flinders Petrie, Wisdom of the Egyptians (162 pp., 128 figs.; London: Quaritch, 1940) [ Isis 34, 261 (1942–43)].\n\n61 In order to consider the obelisks we have to make a big jump, from the so-called Old Kingdom into the New one. The great pyramids date from the Fourth Dynasty (2900 to 2750), the Obelisk Age is that of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties (1580 to 1205); mean interval between the two ages, fourteen centuries!\n\n62 That is, 7°27’ south of the Mediterranean (Damietta mouth). Asw n is about half a degree north of the Tropic of Cancer. Asw n–Syene of the Greeks.\n\n63 Some Egyptian tools are discussed by Clarke and Engelbach, Ancient Egyptian masonry, p. 224; 3 pls.\n\n64 The Greeks called by the name entasis the swelling in the middle of a column necessary to correct an illusion of concavity ( Vitruvius, III, 3, 13). A convexity was intentionally left on the front face of the Paris obelisk. That obelisk dates from the Nineteenth Dynasty (1350–1205).\n\n65 It seems certain that an obelisk was not erected from its position on the ground to a position perpendicular to it; that would have been impracticable. The obelisk was pulled up a long sloping embankment until it was at a height well above that of its balancing point, or center of gravity; than the earth was cut from below it carefully until the obelisk settled down onto the pedestal with its edge n the pedestal notch, leaning against the embankment. From this position it was pulled upright. For details and drawings, see Engelbach, The problem of the obelisks, pp. 66–84.\n\n66 The obelisk of Queen Hatshepsut (1495–1475) at Karnak came on to its pedestal askew, but the irregularity is too small to be unpleasant.\n\n67 Modern architects, beginning with Fontana, do use scale models.\n\n68 The translation of that moving inscription may be read in Breasted, Ancient records of Egypt, vol. 3, pp. 561–568.\n\n69 There are a dozen obelisks in the public squares of Rome.\n\n70 Domenico Fontana (1543–1607), Della trasportatione dell’ obelisco vaticano (Rome, 1590). Fontana was the main architect and collaborator of Sixtus V (pope, 1585–1590) in the creation of “Sixtine Rome.” See C. Sarton, “Agrippa, Fontana and Pigafetta. The erection of the Vatican obelisk 1586,” Arch. internat. d’histoire des sci. 28, 827–854 (1949), 14 figs.\n\n71 The weights are quoted from Engelbach, The problem of the obelisks, p. 30. Engelbach’s tons are long tons (= 2,240 1b avoirdupois). In short tons (= 2,000 1b), the weights would be 1308, 510, 371, 254, 216, 209.\n\n72 To To those already mentioned one might add A. Richard de Montferrand, Plans et détails du monument consacré àla mémoire de l’empereur Alexandre (elephant folio; Paris, 1836); copy in Harvard Library. The Leningrad column is a granite monolith, 12 ft in diameter and 84 ft long; the whole monument is 154 ft high. The Russian undertaking is more directly comparable to the Egyptian one, for the Russians did all the work, beginning with the quarrying of the granite in Finland. Montferrand’s original idea was to create an obelisk but the emperor preferred a column.\n\n73 T.

The two British Museum rolls and the New York fragment constituted a single roll or a single treatise.\n\n81 Peet, The Rhind mathematical papyrus, p. 33 .\n\n82 Moritz Cantor, Vorlesungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik (Leipzig, ed. 3, 1907), vol. 1, p. 95.\n\n83 Chace, Bull, Manning, and Archibald, The Rhind mathematical papyrus, vol. 2, p. 84.\n\n84 As quoted in the John Potter, ed., Miscellanies [Str mateis] of Clement of Alexandria (Oxford, 1715), vol. 1, p. 357.

That rich source of salt and soda is exploited to this day.\n\n90 Small models of every kind of object and representing many kinds of activities were placed in the tombs. This particular one, showing women engaged in spinning and weaving, was found in Thebes and is now in the Cairo Museum.\n\n91 One example, quoted because the author is very familiar with it, though there are many others, is a wall painting in the tomb of Nefretere, queen of Ramses II (1292–1225). showing Isis conducting her to her tomb. There is an excellent reproduction in Nina de Garis Davies, Ancient Egyptian paintings selected, copied and described (2 vols., 91 pls.; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1936).\n\n92 This is true only if the amount of tin is small, say 4 percent; if it is a bit larger, say 5 percent, the alloy becomes brittle when hammered, unless frequently annealed during the process; see Lucas, Ancient Egyptian materials and industries, p. 174. This is quoted to illustrate the great complexity of metallurgic problems. There were probably some great metallurgic artists in antiquity, while lesser artists must have been perplexed by mysterious failures.\n\n93 Tin was used in Egypt apart from bronze; on the other hand, bronze may have been made before tin or tin ore were recognized as such. For the antiquity of tin in Egypt, see W. Max Müller, Egyptological researches (Washington, 1906), vol. 1, pp. 5-8, pl. 1; G. A. Wainwright, “Early tin in the Aegean,” Antiquity 18, 57–64, 100–102 (1944); and as always Lucas, Ancient Egyptian materials and industries.\n\n94 J. H.

However, the term Babylonia is often used in a more general way without chronological restrictions. Thus, one speaks of “Babylonian mathematics” meaning Sumerian mathematics as well as Babylonian stricto sensu . There is no harm in that, provided one is careful. No term is completely satisfactory or can remain so very long, for the region of applicability of geographic and historical terms varies from time to time.\n\n123 Edward Chiera (1885–1933), They wrote on clay , ed. by George G. Cameron (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1938), p. 51. Here is as fine an example of cultural lag as may be found anywhere. Sumerians of 3000 B.C. spoke of nomads as people behind the times, yet similar nomads (Beduin Arabs) are still living in that vicinity today, fifty centuries later!\n\n124 It It is better to leave racial considerations out, for we cannot obtain certain knowledge about the races of the Ancient East. One thing is clear–that by 2000 B.C., if not long before, those races had already been subjected to considerable mixture. One should always hesitate to conclude from language to race. It is easy enough for men, and especially for children, to learn a new language, but they cannot change their chromosomes. Reference to Semitic people in what follows should always be understood to mean people speaking Semitic languages–nothing more.\n\n125 Just as the Greeks twenty-five centuries later conquered their Roman conquerors. Remember Horace’s lines ( Epistolae II, 1, 158 ) :\n\nGraecia capta forum victorem cepit et artes\n\nIntulit agresti Latio...\n\n126 That is, the Amorites of the Old Testament, a Semitic tribe of northern Syria. Their intervention introduced the Mediterranean shores into Mesopotamien history. The dating of Hammurabi is very controversial; the one mentioned in the text is given by Theophile J. Meek in James B. Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern texts (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1950), p. 163 [ Isis 42, 75 (1951)].\n\n127 Leonard W.

Ball, Chinese and Sumerian (quarto, 192 pp.; London, 1913). Various other attempts have been made to connect Sumerian with Chinese antiquities, but none is convincing.\n\n130 Compare the differences between our printing and various forms of calligraphy, abbreviations, and shorthand.\n\n131 Hittite is closely related to the Indo-European languages, being derived together with them from a common source. On the contrary, Hurrian has no genetic connection with those languages, nor with Egypitan or Sumerian. Edgar H. Sturtevant, Comparative grammar of the Hittite language (Philadelphia: Linguistic Society of America, University of Pennsylvania, 1933). E. A. Speiser, Introduction to Human (New Haven: American Schools of Oriental Research, 1941). Many specimens of Hittite literature have been translated by Albrecht Goetze for James B.

It was that inscription which gave Sir Henry Rawlinson in 1847 the key to tho decipherment of Babylonian and led to the foundation of “Assyriology·· as a science (1857).\n\n133 For further discussion see the excellent semi-popular book of Edward Chiera, They wrote on clay, chap. 6.\n\n134 Unless the scribe placed wet towels over the half-written tablet, as a sculptor does for an unfinished clay model.\n\n135 Sometimes the head or the ending might be missing, or even a middle part; but in any case the roll would preserve a relatively long sequence of the original text.\n\n136 They were separated at first because the places where they had been deposited were burned or fell to pieces in the way adobe houses do; further separations were due to rebuilding, and to furtive or scientific excavations, to sales, and so on. A good many of the tablets in our museums have been bought from dealers who obtained them from Arab diggers hiding their sources of supply. Thus some tablet of a text may be in a Russian museum, while others of the same text are in an American collection. Even individual tablets might be broken and the fragments dispersed. medicnl text studied by Edward Chiera was based on a broken tablet, a part of which was in Philadelphia, the rest of it In Constantinople! See Chiera, They wrote on clay, p. 117.\n\n137 Enlil, the god of air and earth, became the supreme god of the Sumerians. Under Babylonian domination he became Marduk (or Bel). Bel is the Semitic name of Enlil. The gods change with the people. Compare the transformation of Zeus and Aphrodite into Jupiter and Venus.\n\n138 This was natural enough. A temple needs priests and scribes for its rites, traditions, and business, and these must be trained; the logical place of training is in the temple itself or close to it, the men in office being the best teachers of their successors. The same conditions produced everywhere similar results, e.g., schools in Egyptian and Buddhist temples, medieval cathedral schools.\n\n139 The Egyptians lacked that advantage, yet their own language had evolved sufficiently by the end of the Old Kingdom (say by the twenty-sixth century ) to require philological commentaries, and we do find such glosses in the Smith surgical papyrus; Isis 15, 359 (1931).\n\n140 That is, the most ancient are hardly anterior to Hammurabi, the bulk dates probably from the second third of the second millennium.\n\n141 Reference is made here not to Assyriologists, but to historians of science and culture.\n\n142 R.

François Thureau-Dangin, Textes mathematiques babyloniens (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1938) [ Isis 31, 405–425 (1939–40)].\n\n143 Stetements made by Hypsicl s (II–1 B.C.) and by Geminos (I–1 B.C.), quoted by Neugebauer, Mathematische Keilschrift-Texte, vol. 3, p. 76, refer probably to late, post-Hellenic, textbooks. We are thinking of pre-Hellenic Babylonian textbooks and there is no evidence that such existed,.\n\n144 The coexistence of sexagesimal ideas in China and Mesopotamia is very striking (see pp. 11–13). That is too slender a basis to conclude that one of these two cultures was influenced by the other; yet it is more convincing to me than linguistic analogies. Sixty is a very large number to agree upon. Its use as a number base or as a cycle implies a high degree of sophistication.\n\n145 For the printer and the reader’s convenience, in our examples of Babylonian (sexagesimal) numbers we will separate each sexagesimal power from the preceding one by a comma, and the negative powers from the positive ones by a semicolon; also we will use zeros, though the Babylonians did not use them. Thus 11,7,42;0,6 means (60 ² × 11) + (60 × 7) + 42 + (60 −2 × 6) − 40, 062.00166.\n\n146 It is one actually found on an old Babylonian tablet; see Thureau-Dangin, Textes mathematiques babyloniens, p. 18.\n\n147 Republic, VIII, 546 B–D.\n\n148 Ibid., x, 615 B.\n\n149 For further discussion of this topic see Hermann Vollrat Hilprecht, Mathematical, metrological and chronological tablets from the Temple library at Nippur (Philadelphia, 1906), pp. 29–34; Sir Thomas Heath, History of Greek mathematics (Oxford. 1921), vol. 1, pp. 305–308 [Isis 4, 532 (1922)].\n\n150 G.

It would seem that at first, at least, they passed from one sexagesimal order to the next one in two steps; that is, they did not multiply by 60, but by 10 then by 6 (see above).\n\n152 The use of unequal divisions of the day was almost universal in ancient times and it continued in some parts of Europe as late as the eighteenth century. The Egyptians divided the day and the night each into 12 hours, the Greeks and the Romans did the same; those hours were of varying length like the watches. As to the latter, we find them in the Bible, ashm r h in Exodus 14:14 and phylac in Matthew 14:25. The Jews divided the night into three watches, the Romans into four, the guards being changed at the end of each watch.\n\n153 Each gesh was thus equal to four minutes of our time.\n\n154 The earliest Greek work in which the division of the ecliptic into 360° occurs is the one ascribed to Hypsicles (II–1 B.C.).\n\n155 François Thureau-Dangin, “Sketch of a history of the sexagesimal system,” Osiris 7, 95–141 (1939).

Heron’s date is uncertain; in my Introduction, I placed him tentatively in (1–1 B.C.) . We know better now; he flourished between A.D. 62 and 150. Isis 30 , 140 (1939); 32, 263–266 (1947–49); 39, 243 (1948).\n\n163 Examples given in the Old Testament ( 1 Kings 7:23; 2 Chronicles 4:2) correspond to the same poor approximation (π = 3).\n\nSince writing the above I have examined the paper by E. M. Bruins, “Quelques textes mathématiques de la mission de Suse,” Proc. Roy. Dutch Acad. Sci. 53, 1025-1033 (1950) and his “Apercu sur les mathématiques babyloniennes,” Revue d’histoire des sciences 3, 301–314 (1950). He has investigated some very early Babylonian tablets found in Suse by R. de Mecquenem in 1936. They show that early Babylonian mathematicians investigated regular polygons of 5, 6, and 7 sides and that they found better approximations for what we call π than the Biblical π = 3; they found successive approximations such as the Heronian 3 As we have just seen, this is not the only relation between the early Babylonians and Hellenistic times. The stream of early Babylonian ideas emerging in Heron, in Diophantos (111–2), and later in Arabic algebra has been investigated by Solomon Gandz, “The origin and development of the quadratic equations in Babylonian, Greek and early Arabic algebra,” Osiris 3, 405–557 (1937); “Indeterminate analysis in Babylonian mathematics,” Osiris 8, 12–40 (1948).\n\n164 The pioneer student of Babylonian astronomy was the Jesuit father, Franz Xaver Kugler, Sternkunde und Stemdienst in Babel.

For a full description, see Sir Leonard Woolley, Ur excavations. Vol. 5. The ziggurat and its surroundings (folio, 164 pp., 89 pls.; Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939). The reconstruction of that ziggurat is taken with kind permission from that work.\n\n168 A strict alternation of 29- and 30-day months would have led to discrepancies between the a priori calendar and the observations of the first crescent; hence it was necessary sometimes to break the alternation.\n\n169 The octaet ris, the introduction of which in the Greek calendar was ascribed to Cleostratos (VI B.C.) and also to Eudoxus (IV-1 B.C.).\n\n170 The epactai ( h merai ) or intercalary days are the days denoting the excess of the solar year over 12 lunar months (365-354–11 days). The epact of a given year is the moon’s age at the beginning of it; it increases by about 11 days year by year\n\n171 However, I should justify at once my reference to “Egyptian hours.” The fact that the order of the days is different from the natural order of the planets can be accounted for only on the basis that each hour of the day was dominated by a different planet. Each day was named after the planet dominating its first hour. The explanation implies a rotation of 168 hours per week, that is, the division of the day into 24 hours in the Egyptian manner, not into 12 hours in the Babylonian one. For further details, see Francis Henry Colson, The week (134 pp.; Cambridge, 1926).\n\n172 The latest and fullest translation and discussion of those tablets will be found in Stephen Langdon and J. K. Fotheringham, The Venus tablets of Ammizaduga. A solution of Babylonian chronology by means of the Venus observations of the first dynasty. With tables for computation by Carl Schoch (126 pp., folio; Oxford, 1928). The examples quoted below are taken from that book (p. 7).\n\n173 The synodic period of Venus is exactly 583.921 days. Hence from superior to inferior conjunction the mean interval is 292 days, so that in each year there are usually one superior and one inferior conjunction. Eight Julian yearns = 2922 days; 5 synodic periods of Venus = 2919.6 days, or 2.4 days less; 8 Babylonian lunisolar years including 3 intercalary months = 2923.5 days, that is, 4 days more than 5 synodic periods. See Langdon and Fotheringham, The Venus tablets of Ammizaduga, p. 105.\n\n174 Their determination being 111 days instead of 115.87, according to Ernst F.

It is not difficult to obtain pure anti-many from the trisulfide.\n\n177 See examples reproduced by C. Leonard Woolley, The development of Sumerian art (New York: Scribner, 1935).\n\n178 In Babylonian times, if not before, some pieces of metal bore an official stamp indicating their weight; this obviated the need of repeated weighings for each transaction. Such stamped pieces of metal constitute a transition to proper coinage; see Meissner, Babylonien und Assyrien, vol. 1, p. 356. In the time of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (705–681) there is a reference to half-shekel pieces, called “Ishtar heads”; see A. T. Olmstead, History of Assyria (New York, 1923), p. 321. This brings us to the time of the Lydian invention.\n\n179 The Accadian verb “to weigh” is shaqälu, which seems to go back to proto-Semitic, for it is found in all Semitic languages (Arabic, thaqala; Hebrew, sheqel); from it comes “shekel,” unless the verb comes from the noun. Since payments were made in gold, silver, or bronze, which had to be weighed, in Assyrian and Aramaic the verb also comes to mean “to pay.” There are words in Assyrian and Sumerian for scales; these words generally occur in a dual form, as they also do in Hebrew, referring to the two scale pans. (Information kindly given by my Harvard colleague, Robert H. Pfeiffer, 26 September 1944). The Egyptian idea of scales of judgment occurs in Job 31:6.\n\n180 This tablet is of baked clay, 3¼ × inches, written on both sides; B.M. No. 120960. It was edited and translated by C. J. Gadd and R.

The most convenient survey of the early codes is in Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern texts, pp. 159–223.\n\n192 According to the most recent calculations, Hammurabi ruled for 43 years, from 1728 to 1686; see Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern texts, p. 163.\n\n193 Georges Contenau, La médecine en Assyrie et Babylonie (228 pp., ill.; Paris: Maloine, 1938) [Isis 31, 99–101 (1939–40)], with bibliography, pp. 51-52, 207-227.\n\n194 An Accadian treatise on medical diagnosis and prognosis has been prepared by René Labat, Traité akkadien de diagnostics et pronostics médicaux (297 pp., album of 68 pl.; Collection de travaux de l’Académie internationale d’histoire des sciences, no. 7, Paris, 1951). It was my duty and privilege to examine the manuscript of it (July 1951). It has been incompletely preserved on 40 tablets which date back to various times, the earliest that of King Marduk-apal-iddin (722–711), the latest the eleventh year of Artaxerxes (453), yet all represent older Babylonian traditions. The treatise is divided into five parts: 1. When the exorcist goes to the patient’s house. 2. When you come near the patient. 3. If, being ill during a day. . . 4. When you take the patient’s hand. 5. When the woman is pregnant, the top of her forehead is yellow.\n\n195 That is, with more ideographic than phonetic signs.

The Cyclopean walls of Tiryns and Mycenae, and in the latter place the “Treasury of Atreus” and the “Lion Gate” had been known even to the ancients and described by Pausanias (II–2), but Schliemann’s excavation of Mycenaean graves excited world-wide interest. Antiquities that had been taken for granted were seen in a new light.\n\n223 Arthur Evans, The palace of Minos (4 vols.; London: Macmillan, 1921–1935; index, 1936). Schliemann died in 1890, Dörpfeld half a century later in 1940, Evans in 1941. The great gap in these dates is due to the fact that Schliemann died at 68 while his younger contemporaries lived to be 87 and 90.\n\n224 Table first published in Isis 34 , 164 (1942–43).\n\n225 It may be added that no culture is territorially continuous. It exists only in centers of sufficient human density, whence it percolates more or less slowly into the surrounding districts. Those centers are seldom close to one another; they are generally distant from one another, sometimes very distant. Any two centers may be separated by fertile land or desert, or by a stretch of river or sea; those differences are significant but not essential.\n\n226 Thucydides, I, 4 (Loeb Classical Library, vol. 1, p. 9). The Carians were a strange people, addicted to piracy, speaking a language unrelated to Greek, and having customs of their own such as matriarchy and a special mode of burial. Says Thucydides (I, 8), “When Delos [one of the Cyclades] was purified by the Athenians in this war [426 B.C.] and the graves of all who had ever died in the island were removed, over half were discovered to be Carians, being recognized by the fashion of the armor found buried with them, and by the mode of burial, which is that still in use among them.”\n\n227 Obsidian objects are found all over the area, though the only source of it is the island of Melos, the most westerly of the Cyclades. Pottery objects of definite provenience are also widely distributed.\n\n228 This is the more tantalizing because some of the Cretan symbols are very much like hieroglyphics; examples are given in Isis 24, 377 (1935–36).\n\n229 The drain pipes of the palace of Cnossos were not the first of their kind; some 1300 feet of copper pipes were found in the pyramid temple of Abu r (Fifth Dynasty=2750–2625) built a thousand years before Cnossos!\n\n230 C.

The Hallstatt period, as it is called in European archaeology, lasted from c. 1000 to c. 500; it is so called after the main site in Hallstatt, Salzkammergut, Austria.

St. Augustine (V–1) quoted Punic words in his sermons.\n\n243 The Pillars of Hercules, Heracles, or Melqart (in Phoenician, king of the city, a name of God), that is, the Straits of Gibraltar. There were early Phoenician settlements, for example, in Carthagena (New Carthage) and Onoba (Huelva), on the coast east and west of the Straits. Later (450–201) a large part of the Spanish Peninsula south of the Douro and Ebro rivers was under Carthaginian power.\n\n244 Strabon, 1, 3, 2.\n\n245 Murex trunculus and M. brandaris, marine gastropods abundant along the Syrian coast.\n\n246 A charming letter written by Renan to Berthelot makes me realize that I am perhaps unfair to the Phoenicians. They were not only merchants, but manufacturers, creators of many goods. The letter is dated Sour (= Tyre), 12 March 1861 “Une chose bien curieuse, c‘est que les restes de la civilisation phénicienne sont presque tous des restes de monuments industriels. Le monument industriel, chez nous si fragile, était, chez les Phéniciens, colossal et grandiose. Toute la campagne est parsemée des restes de cette industrie gigantesque, taillés dans le roc. Les pressoirs, sortes de portes composées de trois blocs superposés, ressemblent à des arcs de triomphe; les vieilles usines, avec leurs cuves, leurs meules, sont là, dans le désert, parfaitement intactes. Les puits dits de Salomon, près de Tyr, sont quelque chose de merveilleux et d’une profonde impression.” E . Renan et M. Berthelot, Correspondance, 1847–1892 (Paris, 1898), p. 254.\n\n247 According to Herodotos, v, 58, the alphabet was brought to Greece by the Phoenicians who came with Cadmos. Cadmos of Tyre, son of a Phoenician king, is one of the mythological personalities symbolizing Phoenician origins. A sufficient proof of the Semitic origin of the Greek alphabet is the fact that the first three letters of that alphabet have Semitic names (alpha, b ta, gamma; aleph, beth, g mel). The order of the letters in all the ancient alphabets (with one exception) is the same as the Semitic order. The exception is the Sanskrit (Devan gar ) alphabet, the order of which is dominated by phonetic considerations.\n\n248 For more remarks on English “orthography” see G.

Let us measure on the meridian OA= OB, then take a rope much longer than AB and divide it into two equal parts by a knot at G. The rope is fastened at A and B and then the knot C is taken as far east as possible; the line OC is the perpendicular. This would be obvious to the Egyptians because of their intuitive understanding of symmetry. For verification, the operation would be repeated westward, and OC and OD should be collinear. The collinearity would be easily tested with three stakes or plumb lines.\n\nFig. 35\n\n279 Isis 26, 81 (1936). ).\n\n280 Yet see p. 74.\n\n281 Ptolomy, Almagest , 1, 9.\n\n282 Ibid., tables in II, 12.\n\n283 Hesiod, Works and days (11. 174–178; Hugh G.

Its meaning in that text is a cycle of sixty times sixty years or 3600 years. The word is derived from Sumerian shar =3600. Berossos (III–1 B.C.) was very probably the transmitter of that Babylonian idea. It is significant that the Babylonians distinguished three periods of years which were called (I quote the Greek transcriptions), sõssos=60 years, n ros=10 sõssoi, saros =60 sõssoi; we notice once more the typical mixture of decimal and sexagesimal factors. The misuse of the word saros to designate the 18-year period was introduced very late; perhaps as late as 1691, by Edmund Holley! See O. Neugebauer, “Untersuchungen zur antiken Astronomic. III. Die babylonische Theorie der Breitenbeweg-ungen des Mondes; V. Der Halleysche ‘Saros’,” Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Mathematik (Berlin, 1938), Abt.

Neugebauer has proved that the saros was not sufficient to predict eclipses of the Sun, though it may have sufficed to predict eclipses of the Moon. It is significant that the earliest Greek text on eclipses is the one by Philippos of Opus (c. 350 B.C.), restricted to lunar eclipses. See Neugebauer, “Untersuchungen zur antiken Gastronomic” The matter has been very clearly explained by the Dutch astronomer Antonie Pannekoek, “The origin of the saros,” Dutch Academy, Proceedings of the section of sciences 20, 943–955 (Amsterdam, 1918). In my own brief account, I have largely followed Pannekoek and even used his own wording, because it could not be improved upon.\n\n290 More exactly, 54 years 34 days. That is the cycle called later exeligmos by Geminos of Rhodes (1–1 B.C.) and by Ptolemy, Almagest, IV, 2. It is the shortest period containing whole numbers of synodic months and days and exact returns of the Moon to former positions. The wordexeligmos was first used for military evolutions bringing soldiers back to their original places, then for the revolutions of celestial bodies.\n\n291 Pannekoek, “The origin of the saros,” p. 944.\n\n292 Carl Bezold and Franz Boll, “Reflexe astrolo-gischer Keilschriften bei griechischen Schrifstellern,” Sitzber.

See Max Wellmann, “Die Pflanzennamen des Dioskurides,” Hermes 33, 360–422 (1898) and the indices at the end of his edition of Dioscorides (Berlin, 1914), vol. 3, pp. 327–358.

This is a very late source, of course, but it embodies old traditions. See text in Plutarch’s Moralia (Loeb Classical Library, vol. 5).

Bear in mind the ignorance exhibited by many of our own priests in the Middle Ages, and yet a knowledge of Latin was incomparably easier to attain than the ability to read hieroglyphic or hieratic texts. The clerical ignorance of Latin has been repeatedly illustrated by George Gordon Coulton, Europe’s apprenticeship (London: Nelson, 1940).\n\n322 John Burnet (1863–1928), Greek philosophy. Part 1 Thales to Plato (London, 1924), p. 4.\n\n323 It is curious that hom ros in the Cumaean dialect had the same meaning as typhlos, blind. On the other hand, in the Ionian dialect hom reu means pod ge , to lead or guide. The name might thus be a description, physical or mental, of the author, as if one said “the blind man,” “the guide,” “the poet.”\n\n324 Smyrna, Rhodos, Colophon, Salamis, Chios, Argos, Athenai. These names are interesting; note that the majority are Ionian. The Homeric dialect is largely Ionian.\n\n325 Especially the splendid work done by the two Chadwicks, man and wife, Hector Munro Chadwick and Norah Kershaw Chadwick, The growth of literature (3 vols.; Cambridge: University Press, 1932–1940) [Isis 29, 196 (1938)]; vol. 1 (1932) deals with the ancient literatures of Europe; vol. 2 (1936), with the Russian, Yugoslav, Indian, and Hebrew literatures; vol. 3 (1940), with the Tatars, Polynesia, the Sea Dyaks, African peoples, and general survey. See also Solomon Gandz, “The dawn of literature,” Osiris 7, 261–515 (1939).\n\n326 The number of phrases and lines repeated is very large, and no wonder, for the repetition being partly instinctive and partly systematic, everything conspired to bring back favorite sayings. See the concordance to the parallel passages in the Iliad, Odyssey, and hymns in Henry Dunbar,Complete concordance to the Odyssey and hymns of Homer (Oxford. 1880), pp. 391–419.\n\n327 Aoidos = vates, poet, seer . The word occurs in the Iliad, XXIV, 721, and frequently in the Odyssey and in Hesiod.\n\n328 Rhaps dol = stitchers of songs or song sewers. The word as applied to reciters of Homeric poems occurs for the first time in Herodotos, (v, 67), but is probably of earlier coinage for it expresses the business of the early minstrels rather than that of the later reciters, whose initiative decreased as the epics were gradually canonized.\n\n329 As Parry died at the age of 35, before having been able to exploit his materials, his achievement has not received the attention and praise that it deserved, and therefore the following details may be welcome. He took more than 2,550 double-sided disks from the lips of 90 different singers. His recordings include two long epics of 13,000 and 12,000 odd lines (2.200 disks) and 300 other songs, so-called women’s songs (350 disks). In many cases he recorded the same lays or songs from different singers, or twice from the same one after an interval of some days or weeks between the recordings. This enables one to measure individual variations and to understand better the regularities and irregularities of oral transmission. Parry’s work was done at the eleventh hour, when the heroic recitations that he recorded were fast disappearing; but for him immemorial traditions might have been completely lost. These details were obtained from an article by the Hungarian composer Béla Bart6k ( New York Times, June 28, 1942), who investigated the Parry records, being especially interested in their musical aspects. See also Harry Levin, “Portrait of a Homeric scholar,” Classical J. 32, 259–266 (1937), with bibliography of Parry’s writings.\n\n330 Various examples of that ability, which seems almost uncanny to us, are quoted by Solomon Gandz, “The dawn of literature,” Osiris 7, 304–308, 353, 384–385, 407 (1939). A few recent French examples are given by Sainte Beuve in his review of Grote’s Histoire de la Grèce (Nouveaux lundis 10, 61, original date 1865). An almost perfect Vaidika (i.e., one who knows the Vedas) is described in a letter to Max Müller dated Bombay 1883; Life and letters of Friedrich Max Miiller (London, 1902), vol. 2, p. 134.\n\nBy way of contrast, the following story illustrates the new point of view due to the diffusion of printing. An old “cantast6rie” of Naples was found out by his audience to be blind; he pretended to read the Orlando furioso of Ariosto but instead recited the poem. That discovery finished him in their esteem. See Marc Monnier, Les contes populaires en Italic (Paris, 1880), p. 78. The event occurred in the seventies of the last century.\n\n331 For the sake of comparison: the Chanson de Roland (XI–2) was completed some three centuries after the events that inspired its creation.\n\n332 Iliad, II, 494–779.\n\n333 In terms of Egyptian chronology, the events described date from the Twentieth Dynasty (1200–1090) or the Twenty-first (1090–945); the poem dates from the Twenty second or Libyan Dynasty (945–745).\n\n334 Iliad VI, 168–169; pempe de min Lyci nde , poren d’ ho ge s mata lygra grapsas en pinaci ptyct i thymophthora polla.\n\nThe word grapsas should not deceive us. The early meaning of graph was to scratch; later, much later, it was taken to mean delineate, draw (Herodotos, II, 41), or write (Herodotos I, 125 ). The word, anagign sc , meaning to know well, to recognize, was first used to mean reading by Pindar (c. 522–442), and epilegomai was first used with that same meaning by Herodotos (I, 124, 125, etc.). Before Pindar there was no word for reading. The Syrian word biblion was first used by Herodotos to mean paper, a letter, and by Aristotle to mean a book.\n\n335 The earliest Western epic is also the largest. It contains 15,693 verses. Here are a few figures concerning other epics for the sake of comparison. The Odyssey contains 12,110 lines, the Aeneid 9,895, the Divina Commedia 14,233, Paradise Lost 10,565. “The man put on trial for love” or “tormented by love” ( Er tocritos ), composed probably in the first half of the sixteenth century and ascribed to Bitzentzos ho Cornaros (Vincenzo Comaro) of Sitia in Crete, extends to 11,400 political verses (verses of eight plus seven syllables). The two Yugoslavian epics mentioned above contain 13,000 and 12,000 lines. It is remarkable that all those poems are of the same order of magnitude, the longest being about 50 percent longer than the shortest. It is true, the Chanson de Roland (XI–2) and the Byzantine epic Digen s Acritas, prior to the fourteenth century are both somewhat shorter — less than 5,000 lines each. See Karl Krumbacher, Ceschichte der byzantintschen Literatur (Munich, ed. 2, 1897), pp. 827–832, 870–871; Henri Grégoire, Digenis Akritas (New York, 1942) [ Isis 34, 263 (1942–43)].\n\nOn the other hand, Eastern epics are considerably longer. The Mah bh rata measures c. 220,000 lines, the R m yana c. 48,000, the Sh hn ma of Firdawsi (XI–1) 80,000, the Mathnawl of Jal l al-d n-i-R m (XIII-2), 26,660 couplets. That is typical of Eastern extravagance. The size of the Western epics is more appropriate to the human size and to the length of human life.\n\n336 The contrast between Greek and Latin literature is great in that respect. Homer appears at the beginning or before the beginning of the Greek age; Vergil on the contrary lived from 683 to 734 U.C. (70–19 B.C.). The Romans had reached political maturity and obtained considerable international power before they were able to boast a literature worthy of a great nation. By the end of the second Punic war (201 B.C.) their literary achievements were still of an inferior nature; it was only after the conquest of Greece half a century later that their literary ambition was fully awakened.\n\n337 The idea that the Iliad and the Odyssey are of separate authorship is not by any means new. It goes back to early Hellenistic times, say to the third century B.C. when the scholars entertaining it were called hoi ch rizontes (the separators), yet their opinion was generally rejected.\n\n338 For a detailed comparison see Carl Rothe, Die Odyssee als Dichtung und ihr Verhältnis zur Ilias. (370 pp.; Paderborn, 1914).\n\n339 The Egyptians have left us short stories but no full-sized novel.\n\n340 Werner Jaeger, Paideia, the ideals of Greek culture (Oxford: Blackwell, 1939), vol. 1, p. 28 [ Isis 32, 375–376 (1949)].\n\n341 Ex arch s cath’ Hom ron epei memath casi pantes.

Hom ridai rhapt n epe n aoidoi.\n\n343 The first canonic text of Homer was established when Peisistratos was dictator of Athens. After his death in 527, that text was lost or neglected. Yet the Homeric poems were kept alive, by public and private recitations, e.g., in the national festivals, Panathenaia, held every year, but chiefly in the musical contests of the Greater Panathenaia held every fifth year (these Homeric recitations had been introduced by Peisistratos). The existence of that early text is proved by the many quotations made by Herodotos, Plato, Xenophon, quotations that can be readily (if not always literally) identified in our editions. Two other Hellenic editions ( diorth seis ) are mentioned, the one prepared by the poet Antimachos of Claros (near Colophon, Ionia), who flourished toward the end of the Peloponnesian War, and the other prepared by Aristotle for Alexander the Great, who carried it with him in all his campaigns.\n\nThe scientific study of the text began only in the Hellenistic age, however. Zenodotos of Ephesos (III–I B.C.), first librarian of the Museum of Alexandria, has been described as the “first” editor (diorth t s); he is said to have produced before 274 the “first” edition of the Iliad and theOdyssey. Zenodotos was certainly not the first editor, but he was a better philologist than his predecessors. It is probable that the division of each epic into 24 books was due to him. The third and fourth librarians of the Museum, Aristophanes of Byzantium ( II–I B.C.) and Aristarchos of Samothracc (II–I B.C.), improved considerably Cenodotos’ methods; the text familiar to us was established by them. Yet Didymos of Alexandria (I–2 B.C.) corrected Aristarchos’ edition. And so on. The history of Homeric learning is a good cross section of the history of Greek scholarship.\n\n344 Ho pat r epimelumenos hop s an r agathos genoim n , nancase me panta ta Hom ru ep mathein.

Indeed, emotions modify the heart beat and may even cause distressing palpitations.\n\n354 Odyssey, XVII, 297.\n\n355 Odyssey, XVII, 383–386.\n\n356 The Olympiads were periods of four years separating the successive athletic festivals held in Olympia, Elis. The first Olympiad (776–773) was reckoned from the victory of Coroibos of Elis in the footrace of 776. The dating by Olympiads was not systematized until much later, by Timaios of Tauromenium in Sicily (III–1 B.C.).\n\n357 Iliad , XVIII, 590.\n\n358 Unless some prophets of the Old Testament –Amos, Hosea, Micah, and Isaiah–anticipate Homer, but that is doubtful even in the case of Amos.\n\n359 There are not simply references to the rhapsodists in the papyri but actual Homeric texts, many of them. For example, see Paul Collart, “Les papyrus de l‘Iliade” in Pierre Chantraine, P. Collart and René Langumier, Introduction à l’Iliade (304 pp.; Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1942). Three hundred seventy-two papyri containing fragments of the Iliad are known, plus 35 containing commentaries, scholia, paraphrases; these 407 papyri date from the third century B.C. to the seventh after Christ. Their number increases to the third century after Christ, then decreases together with Egyptian Hellenism. See Chronique d’Egypte, No. 36 (1943), p. 315.\n\n360 The Iliad was translated into Arabic only in very recent times by Sulaym n al-Bust n and first printed in Cairo in 1904. That is a curiosity of Arabic literature of no interest for the study of Homeric tradition.\n\n361 To be sure, the Vergilian tradition continued the Homeric one; our statement refers to Homer independently of Vergil.\n\n362 Télémaque was composed probably in 1693–94; its first publication in 1699 was due to the indiscretion of a copyist. The first approved edition, not essentially different from the many previous ones, was published only in 1717, two years after the death of the Archbishop of Cambrai, by the care of a collateral descendant, the marquis de Fénelon.\n\n363 In the nineteenth century Télémaque had long ceased to be considered a liberal book and had become on the contrary very conservative and gradually even out of date. May I be permitted to tell the following anecdote? My paternal grandmother, who had been educated in a French conventual school, often told me that Télémaque was one of her main textbooks. The nuns had led her to believe that Télémaque contained every (proper) word in the French language! The main point is this, that white the Abrégé de l’histoire sainte (or some other such book) taught her the Hebrew and Christian traditions, Télémaque inculcated in her mind the Homeric and Greek ones.\n\nTélémaque was translated into Japanese from the English in 1879, under the title Heneromu monogatari. It was written in the style of the ancient Japanese romances, a metrical prose with Chinese flavor. G. B. Sansom, The Western world and Japan (New York: Knopf 1950), pp. 400, 403 [Isis 42, 163 (1951)]. Thus did Greek thought interpreted by a Frenchman of the seventeenth century reach the Far East two centuries later.\n\n364 My dating of the Aethiopica is based on the discussion of R. M. Rattenbury in the edition of it published by the Association Guillaume Budé (2 vols.; Paris, 1935–1938); it is conjectural. The identification of the author with the bishop is not certain.\n\n365 Aethiopica, III, 14.\n\n366 More critical writers like Pausanias (II-2) in his Description of Greece, x, 24, 3, and Philostratos of Lemnos ( III–1 ) in his Hér icos, XVIII. 1–3, dealing with the Trojan war, preferred to admit their ignorance concerning Homer’s origin.\n\n367 Published in 3 vols. (Ghent, 1806). We reproduce the programmatic title page from the copy kindly lent by the Library of Congress. The same title page appears in each of the three volumes. The last line of the subtitle reads: “Que les poètes Homère et Hésiode sont originaires de la Belgique, &.” For information on the author see the notice in vol. 1, pp. (9)–(16) and the article by Edm. De Busscher in Biographic nationale de Belgique (Brussels, 1876). vol. 5, pp. 114–127.\n\n368 Olaus Rudbeck, Atlantica (1679–1689). New edition by Axel Nelson published by the Swedish History of Science Society (Uppsala, 1937, 1938, 1941) [ Isis 30, 114–119 (1939); 31, 175 (1939–40); 33, 71 (1941–42)].\n\n369 We are remarkably well documented about the life and works of Friedrich August Wolf (1759–1824). See Wilhelm Körte, Leben und Schriften Friedr. Aug. Wolf’s, des Philologen (2 vols.; Essen, 1833); J. F. J. Amoldt, Fr. Aug. Wolf in seinem Verhältnisse zum Schulwesen und zur Paedagogik (2 vols.; Brunswick, 1861-62); Victor Bérard, Un mensonge de la science allemande (300 p.; Paris, 1917); Siegfried Reiter, F. A. Wolf. Ein Leben in Briefen (3 vols.; Stuttgart: Metzler, 1935), including autobiographical fragment (vol. 2, pp. 337–345).\n\n370 “Ignorance” is written from the philologists’ point of view. Schliemann was not a well-trained scholar but a self-taught amateur. Yet he knew Homer by heart; he knew the words and the things that they signified to Greek imagination. He had taken the trouble of mastering modern Greek and could discuss native lore unceasingly with his Greek wife (since 1869) and friends, with Greek schoolmasters, sailors, and shepherds, with the most learned men of Hellas as well as with the humblest. In these respects his equipment was immeasurably superior to that of the average philologist.\n\n371 He had to stand much criticism not only from the armchair philologists but also from archaeologists finding fault with his methods from the point of view of later improvements. For a fair appreciation by a professional archaeologist, see Stanley Casson (1889–1944), The discovery of man(London: Harper, pp. 226–227 [ Isis 33, 302–303 (1941–42)].\n\n372 Paroimia, Cata ten paroimian - as the saying goes (Plato). A list of Greek proverbs will be found in Hermann Bonitz, Index aristotelicus (Berlin, 1870), p. 570.\n\n373 Ei caca tis speirai, caca cerdea c’améseien. Hesiod, fragment in Loeb Classical Library ed., p. 74.\n\n374 Ego de ce ... et tyma myth saim n. Works and days, line 10.\n\n375 According to Thucydides, III, 96, the murder took place near the temple of Zeus in Nemea, Argolis, but this may be due to a misunderstanding. The memory of Hesiod’s death is preserved in the following graceful lines written by Alcaios of Messena c. 200 a.c. “When in the shady Locrian grove Hesiod lay dead, the Nymphs washed his body with water from their own springs, and heaped high his grave: and thereon the goat-herds sprinkled offerings of milk mingled with yellow-honey: such was the utterance of the nine Muses that he breathed forth, that old man who had tasted of their pure springs.” The first line of the Greek text ( Anthologia graeca, VII, 55) is\n\nLocridos en nemeï scier necyn H siodoio.\n\nThe word to nemos (nemus) means a wooded pasture, a glade; the proper name Nemea is derived from it. Thucydides may have confused a common name with a proper one.\n\n376 The Boeotians were supposed to be dull and slowwitted and the Athenians liked to make fun of them. That bad reputation, whether deserved or not, is perpetuated by the English words Boeotia and Boeotian.\n\n377 Works and days, lines 109–201.\n\n378 Ibid ., lines 383–694.\n\n379 bid ., lines 383–404, 582–596. The quotations are from the translation by Hugh G. Evelyn-White in the Loeb Classical Library, pp. 31, 47 (1914).\n\n380 The first editors of the Works and days realized this. Indeed the early editions included not only the Works and days but also the Idyls of Theocritos of Syracuse (fl. 285–270).\n\n381 S. N. Kramer, Scientific American (New York, November 1951), pp. 54–55.\n\n382 Works and days, lines 727–732:\n\n383 Ibid.; Loeb, p. 65.\n\n384 Descent of the Gods, lines 29–34.\n\n385 Ibid ., Loeb, p. 81.\n\n386 Iliad . 1, 70.\n\n387 Eg eimi pan to gegonos cai on cai eso-menon cai ton emon peplon udeis p thn tos apecalypsen. Plutarch, Isis and Osiris , 354 c.\n\n388 Hesiod is mentioned by name in line 22 of the Theogony. This may be understood as a reference to the Hesiod who wrote the Works and days by the (different, later) author of the Theogony. Could it not be understood as well as a reference by the poet to himself?\n\n389 According to the most recent calculations the dates of Hammurabi are now 1728 to 1686 and the other dates would have to be changed accordingly. The main point is that all those Babylonian kings were much anterior to Greek “historic” times.\n\n390 For a comparison of the Assyrian codes with earlier codes and bibliography on the subject, see James B. Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern texte (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1950 pp. 159–223 [Isis 42, 75 (1951)].\n\n391 Ashshur (or Ashur) on the upper Tigris, below Mawsul. The word Ashur appears in the names of many Assyrian kings and our word Assyrian is itself derived from it. The term “Assyriolo-gist” is used to designate students not only of Assyrian antiquities, but also of Mesopotamian antiquities in general. This is due to the accident that Assyrian monuments and documents were the first to he discovered and investigated.\n\n392 There is, of course, a confusion between the real woman and the legendary one and, as always happens, all kinds of legends clustered around the mythical person. The name became proverbial. Margrete of Denmark ( 1353–1412), who ruled the three Scandinavian kingdoms, was called the Semiramis of the North (Introduction, vol. 3, p. 1021 and the same epithet was bestowed upon Catherine II of Russia (1729–1796).\n\n393 This is the Biblical Sargon. He is named Sargon II with reference to an earlier king of Assyria, Sharrukin I (2000–1982), not to the king of Accad, Sharrukin (2637–2582).\n\n394 For general guidance see the histories of ancient art. Cyril John Gadd, The Assyrian sculptures (78 pp., 18 pis.; London: British Museum, 1934). Gorges Contenau, Les antiquités orlentales au Musée du Louvre (Paris, 1928), pls. 5–20.\n\n395 The sexuality of phanerogams was clearly explained for the first time by Rudolf Jacob Camerarius in 1694. For the interpretation of the Assyrian bas-rellefs see G. Sarton, “The artificial fertilization of date palms in the time of Ashur-nasir-pal,” Isis 21, 8–13, (1934), 2 pls. Also S. Candz,Isis 23, 245–250 (1935); G. Sarton, Isis 26, 95–98 (1936). Nell Perrot, Les représentations de l‘arbre sacré sur les monuments de Mésopo-tamie et d’Elam (144 pp., 32 pis.; Paris: Geuthner, 1937) [Isis 30, 365 (1939)].\n\n396 The majority of the clay tablets preserved in the world’s museums were dug out by natives for sale to dealers in antiquities; in many cases their exact provenience is unknown. This considerably decreases their value, unless their provenience and date can be determined from the text that they carry.\n\n397 There are many tablets bearing the library mark of Ashur-bani-pal’s great grandfather Sargon, but Sergon’s library is lost. All the tablets of the royal library bore a label (just like books in our libraries). The simplest label read: “Palace of Ashur-bani-pal, King of the world, King of Assyria.” As the number of tablets grew and the text of the labels was lengthened, stamps were prepared by means of which the whole label could be printed at once. Among the historical documents is an autobiography of Ashur-bani-pal, the greater part of which is devoted to his education; that is the only autobiography of an Assyrian king. See A. T. Olmstead, History of Assyria (New York, 1923), pp. 489–503.\n\n398 As quoted by Edward Chiera (1885–1933) in his excellent book, They wrote on clay (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1938).\n\n399 Except perhaps such a man as Seloucos the Babylonian (II–I B.C.)?\n\n400 Or Nebuchadnezzar. He was the second king of that name; the first, who belonged to the Second Isin dynasty, ruled from 1146 to 1123.\n\n401 Strabon called them Naburianos and Cidenas (Geography XVI, 1, 6).\n\n402 To complete this history, Babylonia was gov-emed by the Parthians (Arsncid dynasty) from 171 B.C. to A.D. 226, then by the Sasanian dynasty, 226–641, which was dispossessed by the Muslims.\n\n403 Introduction, vol, 1, 71.\n\n404 At least"
