They do not, however, include articles on individual scholars and researchers. The supplement volumes to Bri/1's New Pauly now provide the opportunity to contribute to the history of scholarship with a historical lexicon of classical studies. Although great weight is nowadays rightly attached to research institutions, and to the dependence of scholarly developments and trends on political and cultural contexts, there is still no doubt that advances in scholarship often come about through the work of individual scholars and by virtue of their perspectives, interests and creativity. This evident fact amply justifies the biographical approach of the present volume. Consideration is given not only to philologists, archaeologists and ancient historians, but also to antiquarians, epigraphists, numismatists and papyrologists. In accordance with the overall conception of Brill's New Pauly, which in its 'Antiquity' section pays attention to the role of the cultures of Ancient Egypt and the Ancient Near East in the development of the eastern Mediterranean after I ooo BC, as well as to the cultural diversity of the Mediterranean world, the present volume also includes articles on Egyptologists and Ancient Near Eastern specialists. The editors and authors of the present volume are convinced that scholarly disciplines must always acknowledge those existing works and achievements upon which the present state of scholarship is founded. Knowledge of its historical context is essential to a discipline's understanding of itself, and to successful research practice. An interdisciplinary history of scholarship today can no longer legitimately disregard philosophers, ethnologists, social scientists or art historians - or, indeed, collectors and writers who have made decisive contributions to the development of classical studies or to an understanding of antiquity. Goethe may serve as an example: he aspired to study classical philology, knew the philologists of his day well and, as is often recalled, wrote a treatise on Winckelmann, corresponded with Friedrich August Wolf and made an intensive study of ancient art and literature. Similarly, it would be indefensible today to omit consideration of social scientists like\n\nMax Weber or Karl Polanyi, whose works have enjoyed widespread reception among ancient historians. The same is true of scholars like Michel Foucault, whose works on sexuality in ancient Greece have been a notable influence on academic research. The present volume covers a chronological span from the 14th cent. to the :z.oth. Classical studies became increasingly important at universities and academies in the I 9th and early :z.oth cents., while constituent disciplines within the general field became more clearly differentiated as chairs of archaeology and ancient history were founded. Although the ancient languages lost their dominant position in the education system over the course of the :z.othcent., the number of philologists, archaeologists and ancient historians worldwide has increased as many new universities have been established. More than half of the articles are therefore devoted to scholars of the 1 9th and :z.oth cents. As a general principle, no articles have been devoted to living scholars. The editors and authors have striven to give equal and proportionate weight to classical studies in Germany, other European countries and the United States, in order to create a comprehensive international reference tool on the history of classical scholarship. Selecting scholars and researchers for individual consideration has not been an easy task either for the editors of the volume as a whole or for the specialist subject editors. Limitations of space have necessitated restricting the number of articles, and in many cases it has proved impossible to include scholars who unquestionably made important contributions to classical studies. Naturally, too, such a selection depends in part on subjective criteria, and the editors are well aware that other decisions would have been possible and perfectly justifiable in scholarly terms. The work of individual scholars and researchers can only ever be properly understood in the context of the development of scholarship as a whole. Moreover, the work of an individual scholar must always be dependent on the work of his or her predecessors, and scholarly research is also conditioned by political, cultural and institutional contexts. For these reasons, the editors have attempted in a brief survey to present the development of classical scholarship from its beginnings in the 14th cent. through to the second half of the :z.oth cent. This survey is also intended to facilitate the location of the individual articles in the context of the history of scholarship.\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThe principle of 'decentralized organization of work' (cf. BNP 1, Preface) has also been observed in this lexicon. The editors wish to thank the specialist subject editors for their thorough work, which has extended far beyond the organization and supervision of their individual areas of expertise. Thanks are also due to the authors for their articles, which have often required considerable research, and to the editorial team at\n\nxvi\n\nMetzler-Verlag, especially Dr. Brigitte Egger, who has risen to master every challenge and difficulty as the work has progressed, and whose ever helpful and dedicated management has been crucial to the production of the lexicon.

The remit of research in the history of scholarship has not been restricted to describing past advances in knowledge within the various fields, but has also included more generally the analysis of research processes. Scholars have sought to establish the conditions under which scholarly progress is possible (Karl Raimund Popper; Thomas S. Kuhn; Paul Feyerabend), the interdependencies that exist between scholarly research and political, social and cultural contexts, and the factors that impact upon research interests, the formulation of problem issues and the choice of methods. At first, such scholarly history tended to concentrate primarily on the natural sciences and the great revolutions in scientific thought that led to the development of new theories and methods in disciplines such as mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry and biology. At first, then, many works in the history of scholarship were devoted to important individual scientists, such as Galileo, Newton, Darwin and Einstein. More recently, the emphasis has shifted more towards the institutional contexts of scholarly research for instance, to the role of universities and communication between scholars in the formulation of new research outcomes, the emergence of research institutes and laboratories at universities in the 19th cent. or the foundation of institutions like the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Although several important monographs on the history of classical studies were published before 1970 - examples include the Geschichte der Philologie by Ulrich van WilamowitzMoellendorff ( 192.1) and Theodor Mommsen und das 19. Jahrhundert by Alfred Heuss ( 19 56) -, research into the history of scholarship only really began to intensify after 1970, thanks in particular to the initiatives and commitment of Alfred Heuss, William M. Calder III, Arnaldo Momigliano, Rudolf Pfeiffer, Karl Christ, Alexander Demandt, Manfred Landfester, Wilfried Nippe!, Beat Naf and Stefan Rebenich. The work of these ancient historians and classical philologists has been vital firstly in greatly enhancing our understanding of the development of classical philology, archaeology and ancient history, and secondly in establishing the history of scholarship as a recognized discipline of classical studies.\n\nThere are two distinct approaches to research in the history of scholarship. While many accounts consider the subject in terms of the history of individual scholars, and therefore tend to emphasize the biographies of particular figures in the field, other researchers have seen the history of scholarship in terms of the history of problem issues, and attempted to focus their works and conclusions on particular thematic complexes, conducting critical analysis of the development of the various scholarly positions. It is vital to acknowledge that in earlier times, studies mainly concerned with assessing the achievements of individual researchers seldom paid attention to the political and cultural conditions and contexts within which those researchers worked. This predilection for a biographical account also often produced very positive, sometimes flattering assessments of the achievements of particular scholars, while their shortcomings were rarely addressed. In this context it must be emphatically stated that alongside the important work done by individual researchers, the world of scholarship has also always played host to errors of judgment and problematic positions. Many studies of the history of scholarship also concentrated on developments in particular nations or even at particular universities, thereby neglecting the work of collaboration among scholars of different nations that was so characteristic of the early modern period and the I 9th cent. in particular. Another problem has arisen where focus has been restricted to a single discipline, thereby similarly overlooking interdisciplinary collaboration. Surveys of the history of scholarship often set the period around the year 1800 as a definite watershed. There is more interest in modern classical studies, as the subject established itself and developed its thematic spectrum, its overall approach and above all its methodology at the universities in the 19th cent. This weight of emphasis does not pay due attention to the scholars of the early modern period, whose achievements were often of pioneering importance. The scholarly positions of Humanism and the Enlightenment are also frequently forgotten. Yet it should be remembered that the editing and commentating of ancient texts, the identification of topographical data with remains and ruins, and the examination of ancient works of art were all, at the time, remarkable scholarly accomplishments. Moreover, the development of a method for interpreting texts and pictorial works and the emergence of a historical understanding of ancient art and literature were advances of crucial importance in the culture of\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nFROM\n\nPETRARCH\n\nTO\n\nTHE\n\nthe early modern period. The work of the early modern Humanists and antiquarians may thus quite justifiably be compared with the emergence of modern scientific method, based on experiment and the assumption of laws of nature. The Humanists and the outstanding philologists and antiquarians of the Renaissance and early modern period are representatives of European culture, and thus deserve their place in European cultural history. In the circumstances, it must be considered a matter of some urgency for historians of scholarship to accord scholars of the Renaissance and early modern period the attention that their historical importance warrants, and to draw renewed attention to their achievements. Anthony Grafton, for instance, has drawn attention to the extent to which we risk losing works dating from before 1800, in the section on Friedrich August Wolf in his book Defenders of the Text (1991): To judge this account we must venture outside the orderly, well-mapped intellectual landscape found in most histories of scholarship. We must confront Wolf's ideas and results with those of his immediate predecessors and contemporaries. These are buried in hundreds of forgotten books, whose neoclassical title pages unfairly raise the hopes of the reader, soon to be discouraged by foxed paper und ugly type. Most of them are too technical to attract historians and too obsolete to interest classicists. No wonder, then, that the dusty sectors of eighteenth-century culture bounded by their covers have become a terra largely incognita (p. 216). Grafton's point applies not only to the r 8th cent., but also more generally to the entire period from Petrarch to Wolf. Indeed, scholars of the Renaissance and early modern periods who are of the utmost important to the history of scholarship itself are today largely unknown. Names such as J. J. Scaliger, Justus Lipsius and Richard Bentley have been generally forgotten and their works, in some cases, are almost inaccessible. For this reason, the present volume attempts to document the influence of the Humanists since Petrarch (1304-1374) and the full thematic spectrum of philological and antiquarian research in the early modern period, and to collate information from the many detailed modern studies - mostly published in some obscurity - of the history of early modern scholarship and present new results, in the hope of stimulating research into scholars who have been largely ignored in recent decades. Nor will it be sufficient here to confine the perspective to the disciplines of today: the history of scholarship must also\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY\n\nXVIII\n\naddress fields that were at the centre of attention in the early modern period - gemmology being one such example. One important task facing historians of scholarship in their research today is to study the parts played by classical philologists, archaeologists and ancient historians in the totalitarian systems of the 20th cent., including not only Italian Fascism and German National Socialism, but also communism in the Soviet Union and the countries of the then Eastern bloc. For the Weimar Republic and the Fascist and National Socialist periods in particular, studies and compilations are available that clearly show the extent to which classical scholars were susceptible to political influence and proved ready to compromise the academic standards of their speciality by adopting and legitimizing the positions of National Socialist ideology, including especially racism, militarism and the glorification of authoritarian rule. Cicero's maxim that history must say nothing that is false and omit nothing that is true seems particularly pertinent to this issue (Cic. De or. 2.,62). Another important field of research in the history of scholarship is the study of exile. Renowned classical philologists and ancient historians from Italy, Germany and Russia found pastures new in Britain and America in particular, where they long exerted lasting influence on British and American scholarship. The history of classical studies in Europe is a long one, closely associated with that of the universities. The following outline is intended to locate the individual scholars and specialists within the development of their subject, and to clarify contexts both scholarly and cultural.\n\n8.\n\nCLASSICAL\n\n18TH\n\nSTUDIES\n\nCENTURY THE EARLY\n\nUP TO THE\n\nB.1. HUMANISTS The roots of Humanism lie in Italy. One important precursor of the Humanists was Dante, already turning as he was away from medieval scholasticism and towards pagan authors including Cicero, Livy and Virgil, and taking at least a theoretical interest in Greek literature. The process that now began to take hold was motivated by a feeling that classical antiquity was superior to the contemporary world in all spheres of life. Hence, the study of ancient authors served to facilitate progress in the world of now. The first Humanist in the true sense of the word is generally agreed to have been Petrarch (1304-1374), who drew explicitly on the pagan literature of antiquity and saw it as setting standards for his own day. He was in contact with the politician Cola di Rienzo, and sympathized with his plan to restore the ancient Roman res publica. He rejected the Aristotle-based scholastic\n\n-xix\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nschooling of his own times. Like later Humanists, Petrarch started out by collecting manuscripts of ancient authors. He made finds in the process, rediscovering Cicero's speech Pro Archia poeta in 13 33, for example, and the same author's Epistulae ad familiares in 13 50. His correspondence, compiled under the same title, also imitated Cicero's work in use of language. Petrarch was certainly the first Humanist for whom Cicero was an explicit linguistic model. He also took an interest in Greek literature, especially Plato and Homer, although his own knowledge of Greek was insufficient to read these authors in the original. In 1366, he commissioned Leonzio Pilato to make a Latin translation of the Iliad and parts of the Odyssey, but the results did not meet the stylistic standards of the first Humanists and there was little interest. Nevertheless, the first shoots of Greek learning were now beginning to show in Western Europe. The work of Petrarch 's student Boccaccio ( 13 13-13 7 5) was of key importance to the further development of classical studies - not only his many encyclopaedic writings, but also his rediscovery of Cicero's speeches against the corrupt provincial governor Verres ( Verrine Orations), Ovid's vilificatory poem Ibis, the erotic anthology Priapea and the poetic description of the River Mose) (Mosella) by the late-antique poet Ausonius. A plethora of important figures emerged in the second half of the 14th cent. under the influence of these early Humanists. Like Petrarch, they were active not only as philologists but also as authors in their own right, and issues of Latinity and style were naturally of the highest importance to them. The period is characterized, particularly as distinct from medieval scholasticism, firstly by the emphasis on the importance of rhetoric above philosophy, even if the connection between eloquentia and sapientia (in the sense of moral philosophy) was certainly an ideal as inspired by Cicero. Secondly, there was the increasing importance of Cicero as a linguistic model, a factor that greatly stimulated the study of the Latin of classical antiquity. Finally, the fledgling studia humanitatis was now rooted not in the universities, which were steeped in scholasticism, but in the princely courts (including the Papal Curia), academies and private schools, and circles of wealthy private citizens. An early centre of Humanism was the city of Florence, at first a free city-state and later under Medici rule. Successive chancellors of the city, Coluccio Salutati ( 1331-1406) and Leonardo Bruni (c. 1370-1444), encouraged both the study of Cicero and the rediscovery of Greek literature. In 13 96, Salutati brought the Byzantine philologist Manuel Chrysolaras to Florence to establish regular Greek tuition there. Bruni used his\n\nFROM\n\nPETRARCH\n\nTO\n\nTHE\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY\n\nknowledge of Greek thus acquired to translate works of Aristotle, Plato and Aristophanes into Latin. In Florence, Humanist studies had a particular edge of topical relevance, serving as they did to enhance the study of the history of the city and to lend political legitimacy to its tradition of civic freedoms (so-called 'Civic Humanism'). From the second half of the 1 5th cent., Rome was becoming increasingly important in the field of antiquarian studies alongside Florence. Popes like Nicholas V and Pius II (Enea Silvio Piccolomini) either were active Humanists themselves or actively promoted the search for ancient texts, the translation of Greek authors and the quest to discover ancient works of art. Among the discoveries made in this period were the complete works of Quintilian, yet more speeches by Cicero, Tacitus' Annales, Germania and Dialogus, the letters of Pliny, Suetonius' De viris illustribus, Frontinus and sixteen comedies of Plautus. The most successful of the manuscript hunters were Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (1380-1459), who used his participation in the Council of Konstanz ( 1414-1418) as secretary to Pope Nicholas I to undertake further expeditions and investigations, and Francesco Filelfo ( 13 981481) and Giovanni Aurispa (1376-1459), both of whom went to Constantinople in the 1440s, where they acquired manuscripts including the first of the Greek tragedians and Apollonius of Rhodes. This period also saw the arrival in Italy of more Byzantine philologists. In 1438, for example, the Platonist George Gemistos Plethon travelled to Ferrara for the ecumenical council, and his presence catalysed the development of the Platonic Academy founded at Florence by Cosimo de' Medici. At the Academy, Marsilio Ficino ( 1433-1499) translated the works of Plato into Latin, like Plethon aiming to purge the true teachings of Plato of the distortions of late-antique Neoplatonism - although the result was a species of Platonic mysticism fused with Christian elements. The Fall of Constantinople in 14 53 naturally marked a major turning-point in the development of Greek philology, since it led to the flight into exile of Greek philologists and the sale of many manuscripts by the Turks. However, this did not bring any new discoveries of previously lost ancient authors or texts. Considerable advances in the development of philology were inspired in particular by Lorenzo Valla (c. 1407-1457), who no longer saw himself as a poet but as a philologist. In 1440, working for the King of Naples, Alfonso of Aragon, who was in dispute with the Papal State, Valla exposed the so-called 'Donation of Constantine' as a forgery. However, in 1448 he changed sides, becoming a secretary in the service of the Pope. His student, the poet and philologist\n\nCLASSICALSTUDIES FROM PETRARCHTO THE 2.0TH CENTURY Angelo Poliziano ( 14 54-1494), furthered the development of textual criticism with his manuscript collations and his lists of variant readings. For instance, he was the first to use the term 'archetype' and the first to include the category of error coniunctivus in his editions. B.2..\n\nHUMANISTS\n\nIN THE ERA\n\nOF\n\nBOOK\n\nPRINTING\n\nPrinting arrived in Italy from 1464. The new technology now made the Humanists' editions and handbooks available to a wider readership, but books were expensive, and book ownership was at first the preserve of libraries and the wealthy. In academic circles, texts therefore continued to be dictated or copied. Printing led to the systematization of many formal conventions, such as typefaces, orthography, abbreviations and the physical design of pages with pagination and chapter numbering. In Italy, the major centres of printing were Rome (37 printing houses by 1480) and especially Venice, where the philologist Aldus Manutius (1450/52.-1515) published not only Latin works but also the first printed editions of Greek authors (so-called 'Aldines'). The most important printing-houses in France were at Lyon, and in the German-speaking world at Strasbourg and Basel. There was a special case in Paris, where the Humanist Estienne (Stephanus) family founded an important printing-house in 1502., only to move it to Geneva later because of their Calvinist sympathies (see below, B.3.). Printing technology stimulated a boom in the creation of editions, so that virtually all of the important pagan Greek and Latin authors had been edited by around 152.0. Most Greek texts were published in Latin translation before they were issued in the original version. Overall, these first printed editions were still unreliable and littered with errors, because of the lack of competent proofreaders. From the late 1 5th cent., Italy slowly began to fall behind, and was gradually overtaken by developments in philological studies in France and Germany (i.e. in the Holy Roman Empire north of the Alps). One factor that contributed to this was the presence from 1442. to 14 5 5 of the Italian Enea Silvio Piccolomini (the future Pope Pius II) at the court of the future Emperor Friedrich III. Subsequently, the university at Vienna began to offer lectures on the Latin classical authors, Cicero, Sallust, Virgil, Horace and Seneca. One of the key founding fathers of German Humanism, Conrad Celtis (14591 508), taught at Vienna until 1508. Besides Vienna, Heidelberg was another important centre of Humanism. For instance, it was one of the workplaces of Peter Luder ( 14 r 5-1472.), trained in Italy and Greece, who lectured on ancient literature, rhetoric and metrics. Luder was also\n\nXX\n\nactive in Ulm, Leipzig and Vienna, encouraging the foundation of private Humanist societies in each of these places along the same lines as the Academy in Florence. The study of Greek and Hebrew was stimulated in particular by the work of Johannes Reuchlin ( 14 5 5-1 522.), who had learned Greek from John Argyropoulos, and now specialized in Homer and Plato; he at least began compiling a Greek-Latin dictionary. The wide-ranging achievements of the welltravelled cleric (he had visited France and England) Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam (c. 1466-1536), meanwhile, were outstanding and ahead of their time. In his treatise De recta Latini Graecique sennonis pronuntiatione ( 152.8), he reconstructed the ancient pronunciation of Latin and Greek, and spoke out against Reuchlin's and Melanchthon's practice of pronouncing Greek with contemporary phonetics. He also made complete editions of authors including Aristotle and Livy, but also of the New Testament, which he subjected to true philological analysis in the tradition of Valla for the first time. Finally, he anticipated principles of modern critical biblical exegesis, showing among other things that the doctrine of the Trinity cannot be derived from the New Testament. This duly earned him criticism in Protestant circles. Other figures of importance to the spread of Greek studies in the German-speaking world, finally, were Philipp Melanchthon ( 1497-1 560) with his Greek grammar (first published 1 5 r 8) and his commented editions, and Joachim Camerarius (1500-1574). 8.3. PHILOLOGY UP TO THE EARLY 18TH CENTURY From around the mid-16th cent., the era of the pioneers of Humanism gave way to a period in which philological studies were becoming established and increasingly specialized, with an increasing tendency towards the simple accumulation of information. This was the age of textual criticism, commentary and the great lexica. At the same time, the Humanist programme of education was consolidating its position in the emerging Latin schools, Jesuit colleges and universities, in all of which the reading of Latin and, where possible, Greek classics was now a central bulwark of the curriculum. The basis for tuition, and indeed of the language used in tuition, was now a classical Latin primarily founded on Cicero. The issue of Latinity was widely debated. Those loyal to scholasticism were particularly and sometimes harshly critical of the new Ciceronianism, which was espoused to differing degrees of strictness, and which was intolerant of the lively use of the language that had been the custom since the Middle Ages, with its mostly lexical innovations at variants with classical Latin. Nevertheless, the Papal Curia\n\nXXI\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nimplemented Ciceronianism with determination through Pietro Bembo (1470-1547). Conversely, in non-philological technical Latin prose (especially the natural sciences), purely practical considerations meant that a somewhat un-Ciceronian practice persisted until around 1 800, with many non-classical but semantically precise expressions in use. The growth of Humanist tuition, with its classical linguistic standards often at odds with traditional usage, increasingly called for suitable teaching aids, and this stimulated the production both of the so-called 'antibarbarus' literature (to remedy offences against classical Latin) and of major lexica to facilitate the reading of the ancient texts. In geographical terms, the 17th cent. saw France joined as a centre of antiquarian studies by the Netherlands and, increasingly, England. In France, philology was primarily aligned with Greek literature, and it was closely associated with the Francophone poetry of the day, for instance in the circle of poets and philologists known as the Pleiade, which was modelled on the Florentine Academy. The Humanist and jurist Guillaume Bude ( 1468-1 540) published Latin translations of Greek authors that would form the foundation of the Collection Bude named after him. The research institute of the College de France in Paris was also founded on his initiative. Meanwhile, the Estienne (Stephanus) family of publishers were providing a great stimulus to lexicography. The first Thesaurus Linguae Latinae was published in 1531 by Robert Estienne (Robertus Stephanus) in Paris, and it would remain unsurpassed until the appearance of Forcellini's Totius Latinitatis Lexicon in 1771. The Thesaurus gave a lexicological analysis of all the linguistic material then available in printed form, taken directly from the sources and annotated with sophisticated semantic explanations in Latin. Another pioneering achievement was the Thesaurus Graecae Unguae compiled in 1572 by Henri (II) Estienne (Henricus Stephanus). This Greek dictionary with Latin explanations remains to this day the most comprehensive lexicon of Greek. It was thoroughly revised and optimized for modern use in the 19th cent. In 1678, Charles DuCange (1610-1688) published his Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae Graecitatis, the first comprehensive lexicon also to assist in the understanding of post-ancient Greek literature. The range of the research interests of Joseph Justus Scaliger ( 1 540-1609) was very wide. Like later generations of philologists, he concerned himself mostly with conjectural criticism using athetesis and transposition. His particular achievements lie in having founded a scientific chronology entailing critical editions of ancient\n\nFROM\n\nPETRARCH\n\nTO\n\nTHE\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY\n\nchronographers like Eusebius, and in his collections of Latin and Greek inscriptions and his compilation of indices to them, work that would open the way for the development of scholarly epigraphy. In the Netherlands, the University of Leiden was founded in 1575, and it developed into an important centre of Humanism and antiquarian studies, particularly of Roman antiquity. Scholars who were active there included the philosopher and Humanist Justus Lipsius ( 1547-1606), the jurist and editor Hugo Grotius ( 158 3-1645) and the philologists Nicolaus Heinsius ( 1620-1681 ), Johann Graevius (1632-1703; Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum ltaliae: 1699 and 1704) and Jacob Gronovius (1645-1716; Thesaurus antiquitatum Graecarum, 1702). Most were engaged in text criticism and commentary or the compilation of antiquarian information. One figure there, however, was an important precursor to modern historical research. This was the Leiden Professor Jacob Perizonius (died 1715). He was the first to question the reliability of Livy on early Roman history, and to develop criteria for the evaluation of historical sources on ancient history. Other scholars influential in the development of Greek studies were the philologists Tiberius Hemsterhuis ( 168 5-1766) and Caspar Valckenaer (1715-1785), both of whom were influenced by Richard Bentley (see below). They produced critical analyses and editions of Lucian and Aristophanes (Hemsterhuis) and Euripides (Valckenaer) respectively. In England, the critic and editor Richard Bentley (1662-1742) worked at the University of Cambridge, with Oxford one of the outstanding centres of antiquarian research. In 1711, he produced a new edition of Horace with over 700 interventions in the text (most of which were later rejected), collected the fragments of Callimachus, Menander and Philemon, and issued new editions of Manilius and Terence. His new principle of textual criticism, which later became controversial, was the primacy of the ratio over the evidence of the codices. Bentley's most brilliant achievements were his discovery of traces of older phonetic and orthographic forms in Homer (the digamma) on the evidence of metrical anomalies (hiatuses) in the transmitted text, and his proof of the inauthenticity of the 'Epistles of Phalaris' (and other collections of correspondence) on the basis of criteria of language and dialect. Through his precise linguistic observations, Bentley thus became a founder of the scientific method of dating ancient linguistic and textual documents. The Hellenist Richard Porson (1759-1808) was also working in the tradition of Bentley in his metrical and critical studies of the tragedians. He was the discoverer of what became known as 'Porson's Bridge' in the iambic trimeter, i.e. a\n\nCLASSICALSTUDIES FROM PETRARCHTO THE :Z.OTHCENTURY position in a metrical line where a word ending is forbidden. In Germany, Johann Albert Fabricius (16681736) published the Bibliotheca Graeca, an important bibliographic tool that is still used today. This is a compilation of scholarly literature on Greek studies from the invention of printing to 1700, and hence anticipates later bibliographies like the Annee philologique of Jules Marouzeau. B.4. THE STUDIES OF THE ANTIQUARIANS (16TH-18TH CENTS.) During the Renaissance, as interest in antiquity was awakening, the monuments of Rome survived - with a few exceptions like the Pantheon - only as ruins. Until as late as the midI 7th cent., ancient buildings in Rome were still being broken up as quarries of building material for churches and palaces. Marble found its way into lime kilns, ancient columns were reused in new structures and obelisks were removed to be set up at sites in the city that were of significance for the Church. Ancient ruins were built over or incorporated into fortifications, so that the original architecture was almost indecipherable. Only a few of the countless ancient sculptures and reliefs survived, among them the famous equestrian statue on the Roman Capitol. This monument escaped destruction because it was believed to depict the Emperor Constantine, the first Roman princeps to adopt Christianity and in many respects a benefactor of the Church. Yet in spite of the destruction and decay, antiquity was still visible in the monuments, especially in the city of Rome. During the Renaissance, awareness grew that the Roman remains were witnesses to a great past, and that as such they warranted attention. Another observation had already been made in the Middle Ages: that Rome was a city of inscriptions that were often to be found on a monumental scale on buildings, such as temples, triumphal arches, bridges and aqueducts. It is striking that the first collection of inscriptions of the city of Rome is found in a codex from the Benedictine Abbey of Einsiedeln dating from the 9th cent. AD (Codex Einsidlensis 3 26). In the 14th cent., Roman inscriptions were even requisitioned as political instruments, when Cola di Rienzo (1313-1354) cited the Lex de imperio Vespasiani in support of his ambitions. The vast number of ancient remains and works of art, in Rome and Central Italy in particular, necessitated first obtaining an overview of the structures and sculptures that were at hand. The study of the material remains of antiquity in Rome and Italy began with the work of the Humanist Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (1380-1459), whose work on the 'misery of\n\nxxii\n\nhumankind' (De miseria humanae conditionis, 1430) also includes a record and description of the ancient remains of the city of Rome. The Roman buildings were then the main focus of the works of Flavio Biondo ( 1392.-1463 ), who in his Roma instaurata ( 1446) and Roma triurn, phans (1459) attempted to clarify ancient topog, raphy and regain contact with Roman culture. Both these works were soon available to schol, ars as printed books ( 148 I and 15 3 1 ), and they became the basis for further research. At last, in the 1 5th and early 16th cents., efforts began to save the Roman ruins from further degradation and destruction. A historic watershed came in I 5 1 5 with the appointment of Raphael as superintendent of Roman antiqui, ties by Pope Leo X. The architects and artists of the Renaissance engaged intensively with ancient art and architecture. Roman cupola construction was a model for the churches of the Renaissance. Filippo Brunelleschi, for instance, drew inspira, tion from the Pantheon in designing the dome of S. Maria del Fiore in Florence. The triumphal arch, meanwhile, was an important element in the church fai;ades of Leon Battista Alberti. But antiquity was by now a mandatory model not only for architecture but also for sculpture. Even painting can now be seen to be influenced by ancient sculpture. Michelangelo praised the Belvedere Torso as the work of a man who was wiser than nature. Increasing building activity in Rome meant that Roman statues were constantly being unearthed, and they attracted more and more interest from scholars and artists alike. The discovery of the Laocoon Group in 1506 caused a sensation. Michelangelo called the group a \"miracle of art\". Familiarity with ancient texts meant that the subject could immediately be correctly identified. Not only artists, but also scholars were by now turning their attention to the material remains of antiquity, so that from the latter years of the 1 5th cent., Humanists and philologists were adding the study of ruins, works of art, inscriptions and coins to their work of editing and interpreting texts. Antiquarian research would now dominate scholarly engagement with ancient architecture, art and material culture for almost three centuries, up to the time of Johann Joachim Winckelmann and Christian Gottlob Heyne. There were two main tasks facing researchers here: firstly, to catalogue the known ruins, works of art, coins and inscriptions in order to create a reliable basis for further study; secondly, to identify structures and clarify their function and to determine the iconography of works of art. From this period on, antiquarian research had at its disposal the possibility of illustrating texts with woodcuts, engravings and etch-\n\nXXlll\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nings, and thus to portray the ruins and artefacts of antiquity in pictures. Texts and illustrations complemented one another in antiquarian books, indeed the images - culminating in the works of Giambattista Piranesi - often took pride of place in a publication, vividly presenting the ancient buildings or objects to the reader with an accompanying explanatory text. This was certainly true of the early compilers of ancient topography like Etienne Duperac (1535-1604), who provided only brief commentaries to the large illustrations of his Vestigi dell' antichita di Roma ( 157 5). Such works are invaluable to our modern knowledge of Roman topography, because the illustrations still show monuments and buildings that have since disappeared. From an early date, it is possible to detect a close correlation between the research work of antiquarians and the activities of collectors. The ambition of collectors was to acquire ancient statues and reliefs in order to display these works of art as their property in a representative manner and hence emphasize their social status and distinction. It became the custom to exhibit ancient statues in the courtyards, galleries or libraries of palazzi. This is well documented in the case of the inner courtyard of the Palazzo Valle-Capranica in Rome by an engraving (c. 1 5 5 3) by Hieronymus Cock. In many cases, the works of art in the collections of the Roman nobility were discovered on their own property and latifundia. Besides the private collections, the public exhibition of ancient statues in Rome on the Capitol and in the Cortile de/ Belvedere in the Vatican is worthy of note. The holdings of ancient art works in Roman collections were catalogued as early as the 16th cent. Pioneering work in this field was done by Ulisse Aldrovandi ( 1 5 22-1605 ), who in 1549 and 15 50 drew and described the ancient statues of Rome (Delle statue antiche che per tutta Roma in diversi luoghi & case si veggono, 1558 ), and by Johannes Baptista De Cavallerijs (Giovanni Battista Cavalieri; c. 1525-1600), who in his Antiquarum statuarum urbis Romae ... icones (1561, 1585 and 1594) arranged Roman statues according to collection or subject. His complete work contains some 200 illustrations documenting the condition of the statues as they were in the 16th cent. Antiquarians' interest would soon widen beyond the monuments of pagan antiquity to include the remains of early Christianity, which came to scholars' attention with the discovery of the catacombs. Antonio Bosio (1575/76-1629) made an intensive study of the Christians' subterranean burial grounds. His comprehensive depiction of these cemeteries (Roma sotterranea, 1632), which was of the utmost relevance to eccle-\n\nFROM\n\nPETRARCH\n\nTO\n\nTHE\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY\n\nsiastical politics in the age of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, contains a precise pictorial documentation of the Christian burials and especially of the wall-paintings. The efforts of the Popes and the Roman noble families to expand their collections of antiquities led to substantial excavations in search of ancient works of art. Occasionally, such excavation work was accompanied by detailed study of the ancient ruins. Pirro Ligorio (1512/13-1583), for instance, took advantage of the excavations at the Villa Hadriani to make a thorough study of this extensive villa complex. Using a brief reference to the villa in the Historia Augusta (SHA Hadr. 26,5 ), Ligorio attempted to identify exactly the individual ruins in the terrain and ascertain their functions. Although his treatise Descriptio Villae Hadrianae was only first published in 1723, scholars were familiar with it before this date. From the late 16th cent., inscriptions and coins were becoming increasingly important in antiquarian research. They were regarded as documents - and were felt to be more reliable as documents than other texts of antiquity. It was quickly understood that what mattered as far as knowledge of antiquity was concerned was not so much the individual inscription as the complete available spectrum of inscriptions. Philologists and antiquarians therefore strove to collect known inscriptions and to publish them in compendia. Important stimuli came once more from Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini. But not until the collection of Martinus Smetius (died 1 578) was a work published that answered the needs of antiquarian research. Smetius was secretary to Cardinal Rodolfo Pio da Carpi, who owned a substantial collection of inscriptions work on the publication of the inscriptions was again closely associated with the major collections in the city of Rome. Smetius' lnscriptionum antiquarum quae passim per Europam liber, which was only published (by Justus Lipsius) in 1588, arranges the inscriptions by category (on public and private buildings; from the sphere of religion; concerning important individuals; concerning public offices, trades and professions). This work was followed by publications by Jan Gruter (1560-1627) and Ludovico Antonio Muratori (1672-1750). Gruter's lnscriptiones antiquae totius orbis Romani, published in 1603 at Heidelberg, was based on the collection of Smetius, but Gruter's work was much more comprehensive and included well over 11,000 inscriptions. Muratori's Novus thesaurus (17391742) adopted the texts of earlier collections, which were not always reliably edited and were sometimes altered at will; it even included forgeries. Consequently, it was soon found unequal to the standards of scholarly epigraphic studies.\n\nll\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nFROM\n\nPETRARCH\n\nTO\n\nTHE\n\nThe roots of Greek epigraphy are found in this period in the collection of Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel (1585-1646). Arundel had acquired many Greek inscriptions along with ancient sculptures. The inscriptions included the 'Parian Chronicle' (Marmor Parium), which John Selden edited in the Marmora Arundel/iana (1629). By the early 18th cent., the great number of books published by antiquarians had brought about such an increase in knowledge of the art and material culture of antiquity that it was all but impossible to achieve an overview of ancient monuments and works of art. Bernhard de Montfaucon (1655-1741) now published his monumental work L'Antiquite expliquee et representee en figures (10 volumes, 1719-1724), aiming to provide an encyclopaedic survey of the artefacts of antiquity. Montfaucon had drawings made of all the collections known to him, arranged them according to criteria of content, and added explanatory texts to the illustrations. His ambition was \"to reconstruct the past in synopsis\" (A. Schnapp). What interested Anne Claude Philippe, the Comte de Caylus (16921765), was a new view, and in particular new methods, of antiquarian research. Although very wealthy, he was not concerned with building up his own collection of beautiful works of art, but with the knowledge that was to be derived from the study of even unassuming remains. The study of objects was most important to Caylus than that of texts. His central methodical principle, as he himself explained, was only to include in his catalogue of antiquities objects that were or had been in his possession. He attached great importance to exactness in the drawings. Besides Greek and Roman antiquities, his catalogue also contains finds from Egypt, Etruria and Gaul (Recueil d'antiquites egyptiennes, etrusques, grecques, romaines et gauloises, 1752-1768). Other genres of ancient art began to interest scholars in addition to architecture and sculpture in the 17th and 18th cents. Gemstones were collected in great quantities. They were cheaper to acquire than sculptures, and hence readily available to the nobility and middle classes. They became highly desirable objects that afforded their owners direct physical access to pieces of original ancient art. Gemstones also quickly became a subject of scholarly literature. Fulvio Orsini included them in the evaluations of ancient portraiture in his Imagines et elogia virorum illustrium et eruditorum ex antiquis lapidibus ( 1 570), and the catalogues of the great collections, like Lorenz Beger's Thesaurus Brandenburgicus (1696-1701), also gave gemstones due attention. The gemmological collection of Baron Philipp von Stosch (1691-1757) was famous, and indeed Stosch as a young man had written a\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY\n\nxxiV\n\nseminal book on the subject (Gemmae antiquae caelatae, 1724). After Stosch 's death, Johanrt Joachim Winckelmann ( 17 17-1 768) took ort the task of compiling a catalogue of his collec· tion of over 3,000 gems (Description des pierreS gravees du feu Baron de Stosch, 1760). This, his first antiquarian publication on ancient art, was the foundation of Winckelmann 's high renowrt among the educated public. Ancient coins had also been collected on i grand scale since the Renaissance. Many 'coin cabinets' were created from the 16th cent. in Europe, and these often stimulated intensive engagement with coins. Among the most significant works ort ancient coinage written in the 17th cent. were the Dissertationes de usu et praestantia numismatum antiquorum (Rome 1664) by Ezechiel Spanheim (1629-1710) and the Introduction a l'histoire par la connoissance des medailles (Paris 1 66 5) by Charles Patin ( 16 33-1693 ). Jean Foy-Vaillant ( 163 2-1706), superintendent of the royal coin col• lection in Paris, published works on the Roman coinage of the Principate and saw ancient coins as an important historical source. Joseph Hilarius Eckhel ( 173 7-1798), while director of the Imperial coin collection at Vienna (from 1774), not only published a catalogue of the collection for which he was responsible, but also wrote specialist studies of various problems of ancient coinage. His pioneering magnum opus, the Doctrina numorum veterum (8 volumes, Vienna 1792-1798), also laid the methodical foundations of modern numismatics. Eckhel's work was widely received by scholars across Europe; in introducing Greek coins to a wider public, it exerted a considerable influence on the aesthetic sensibilities of the late 18th cent. Greek art only came to the attention of antiquarian scholars in the 18th cent., in a period of enthusiasm for the Etruscans and their art. Fascination with the Etruscans, which had been a key force in the development of a sense of Tuscan identity since the Renaissance, intensified yet further in the 18th cent. with the publication of Thomas Dempster's De Etruria regali (Florence 1723-1724), becoming nothing short of a craze. At first, the many Greek vases found in Etruscan tombs were believed to be native Etruscan productions, but it soon came to be understood that these grave goods were Greek vessels, mostly Attic black- and red-figure pottery. Although Winckelmann dealt with the \"painted vessels\" (gemalte Gefasse) in the section on the Etruscans and their neighbours in his Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums ( 1764 ), he judged these pieces to be products of Greek art, mostly on the basis of their Greek inscriptions. Whereas early antiquarians had tended to neglect ancient pottery as merely utilitarian, Winckelmann explicitly placed the quality of the\n\nXXV\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nwork in the vase-paintings on a level with that in the drawings of Raphael. Large vase collections were assembled during this period. That of William Hamilton (1730-1803) would prove particularly influential. Hamilton, who was the British Resident at Naples from 1 764, and hence had contacts in the Italian art trade, acquired over 700 Greek vases, through purchases as well as from his own excavations. He also commissioned Baron Pierrefrarn;ois Hugues d'Hancarville ( 1719-1805) to create a splendid publication of the collection furnished with many large-format illustrations (Antiquites etrusques, grecques et romaines tirees du Cabinet de M. Hamilton, 1767-1776), as an influence on the tastes of the times. There may have been another reason: Hamilton may have wished to drive up the value of his collection. Indeed, he did ultimately succeed in selling it to the British Museum in 1772, for the considerable price of £8, I 40. A contemporary of Winckelmann's who warrants special mention is Giambattista Piranesi (1720-1778), often underestimated in his importance to archaeology. Piranesi should certainly not be seen only as the artist behind the Carceri and the Vedute di Roma. He was also the author of many publications on individual collections of monuments and in particular on Roman architecture - its monumental edifices of infrastructure (roads, bridges, aqueducts and drains) and its construction techniques, the focus of his Antichita Romane (1756), for instance. The support of Pope Clement XIII enabled Piranesi to study the Roman structures in Castel Gandolfo on Lake Albano. In 1762, he presented a detailed report on the outflow canal from the lake (Descrizione e disegno dell'emissario de/ Lago Albano). He followed this up with other books, for instance on the field of Mars in Rome and Cori (// Campo Marzio dell'antica Roma 1762; Antichita di Cori, 1764), all richly illustrated and offering reconstructions. In many respects, what Piranesi stood for was in direct opposition to Winckelmann. While the latter primarily made Greek art, sculpture and 'beauty' the subject of his Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums, Piranesi concentrated on Etruscan and Roman art, architecture, monuments and infrastructure. Consequently, too, Winckelmann and Piranesi were on opposite sides of the debate on the superiority of Greek or Roman art. A final series of large vedute by Piranesi illustrated the temples of Paestum in southern Italy, triggering lively debate among antiquarians of the day. At first, it was unclear whether these temples were Etruscan-Italic or Greek in origin. In accordance with his belief in the superiority of Italic architecture, Piranesi vehemently rejected the notion that the temples were Greek structures.\n\nFROM\n\nPETRARCH\n\nTO THE\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY\n\nLike the temples of Paestum, the discoveries at Herculaneum and Pompeii in the second half of the 18th cent. had a lasting impact on the European public's view of antiquity. The first excavations in the two Vesuvian cities, which were pursued with enthusiasm following a few chance finds in the area of the theatre at Herculaneum, were initially supposed to salvage ancient works of art for the museum of the King of Naples at Portici. Excavations at Pompeii began in 173 8, and they continued with interruptions into the 20th cent. Prior to Napoleon's invasion of Italy, there were two main problems. Firstly, the excavators were not trained antiquarian scholars and they were not equal to the job. Secondly, the King of Naples regarded both the campaign and the Portici museum as prestige projects and refused to allow scholars, including Winckelmann, to make drawings or sketches in the museum. Still, the European public followed the excavations with great interest. Across Europe, tastes and fashions were much influenced by reports of the excavations and especially by the illustrations of the art objects and wallpaintings found at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Fortunately, from 1750, it was at least decided at Pompeii to begin revealing the street plan with the tombs and residential quarters in the vicinity of the theatre. This afforded Goethe, on his visit on 11 March 1787, the experience which he found somewhat disillusioning - of seeing what a Roman town looked like. \"Pompeii is a wonder to everyone in its narrowness and smallness. Narrow streets, albeit straight and laid with pavements to the sides, small houses with no windows, rooms off the courtyards and open galleries illuminated only through their doorways\" (ltalienische Reise, Volume 2, first published 1817).\n\n8.5.\n\nHISTORIOGRAPHY\n\nIN THE\n\nAGE\n\nOF\n\nENLIGHTENMENT\n\nUntil the Enlightenment, the study of antiquity and its architecture, art and literature was mainly the preserve of philologists and antiquarians. Although philologists did certainly take the political institutions of the ancient commonwealth into consideration in their work alongside the major themes associated with the texts and monuments, their interest in them was incidental. Surprisingly, there were no attempts in this period to write books on Greek or Roman history. This may simply be because the works of the ancient historians were regarded as reliable accounts of ancient history and they were still widely read. There seems to have been no urge to write new histories of ancient Greece or Rome. The known facts of ancient political history, however, were certainly requisitioned from an early date. One example of this is the\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nFROM\n\nPETRARCH\n\nTO\n\nTHE\n\nDiscorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio by Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527; the work was published posthumously in 1531 ). Here, the commentary on Livy is the pretext for a political analysis referring to the present day, intended as a contribution to solving the problems of the Italian Renaissance city-states. The late 16th and 17th cents. saw the publication of many books on Tacitus in which the Principate is deployed as a foil for discussions of monarchical rule, and lessons for the present day are drawn from the ancient histories. In the Enlightenment too, the discourse of antiquity had the function of lending historical legitimacy to positions of political philosophy. This can still be seen in the case of Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), whose Contrat social (1762.) takes the institutions of Sparta and Rome a models for his theory of a modern commonwealth. In the 18th cent., scholars and philosophers increasingly came to address the political history of antiquity per se. In many cases, this was done in the context of universal histories, or philosophical essays examining particular aspects of Greek or Roman history, often in comparison with modern conditions. The Political Discourses by David Hume (17u-1776), to take one outstanding example, develops a critical discussion of fundamental issues of ancient society. In his essay Of the Populousness of Ancient Nations (1752), Hume presented a pioneering study of demographic development in antiquity. He attributed the social and economic differences between antiquity and the modern world to slavery, which he considered a defining structural characteristic of ancient society. Meanwhile, however, attempts were also being made to account for the historical development of antiquity by pursuing particular lines of inquiry. A classic example of this is the treatise Considerations sur les causes de la grandeur des Romains et de leur decadence by Montesquieu (1689-1755), published in 1734 in Amsterdam. Insofar as Montesquieu makes reference in many footnotes to the ancient texts from which he draws his information, this work - which surveys Roman history from its beginnings to the Fall of Constantinople - meets the expectations of philological scholarship: he deals with specific problems, such as the level of the wage of a Roman soldier, by reference to the most pertinent sources (Chapter 16). His aim, however, was not simply to convey historical information, still less to give a complete account of historical development, but to examine and discuss the reasons for the rise of Rome, the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the decline of the Eastern. Historical facts were of interest to Montesquieu only insofar as they shed light on his argument. His lack of interest in Christianity is striking.\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY\n\nxxvi\n\nHis account of Constantine does not mention the emperor's conversion, and Christianization does not enter his description of late antiquity until the chapter on Justinian (20), when the struggle against Christian heresies is belatedly addressed as a factor weakening the Empire. The most important historical work of the Enlightenment was the monumental History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon (1737-1794), who, like many 18th-cent. antiquarians, was a private scholar. His most important working tool was his own substantial library. His work begins with a comprehensive description of the state of the Roman Empire in the 20d cent. AD. Following chapters chart political developments through to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Finally, Gibbon continues his history through to the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks ( 14 53 ). Gibbon devotes considerable space to Christianity and the process of Christianization, especially in the chapters dealing with the 4th cent. AD, assembling much evidence to support his case that Christianity was the crucial contributory factor in the decline of the Roman Empire. Gibbon's achievement is especially clear given that only short periods between the reign of Trajan and the end of the 5th cent. AD are covered in surviving ancient historiographic studies of any quality. His account is based on an evaluation of a wide range of source material, including the writings of the Church Fathers. As his notes and his many references, quotations and discussions of the credibility of particular source texts clearly show, Gibbon interpreted the ancient sources thoroughly and with care. His work thus already largely meets the methodical standards of scholarly history. The main reason why Gibbon's history, which paid close attention to religion and institutions, struck such a chord with the European public was that it is based on philosophical reflections on the course of history, and is much more than just a narrative of events. In this respect, it owes a debt to David Hume's History of England (1754 and 1762). The study of the sources was a central problem in Enlightenment historiography. The 18th-cent. British Roman History by Oliver Goldsmith (1730-1774), the author of The Vicar of Wakefield, still displays an unquestioning reliance on the ancient historians. For instance, Goldsmith's first chapters devoted to the Monarchical Period rely closely on Livy. Yet such a view of early Roman history was by no means universal in the Enlightenment, as doubt was beginning to be expressed in the credibility of the ancient tradition. Rousseau, for instance, could assert in his Contrat social (Book 4, Chapter 4) that there were no really reliable accounts of the earliest period of Roman\n\nXXVII\n\nCLASSICALSTUDIES FROM PETRARCH TO THE 2.0TH CENTURY\n\nhistory and that the ancient narratives of these times should be regarded as legends. Such a view had been founded as early as 1738 by Louis de Beaufort ( 1703-179 5 ), and it was widespread in the 18th cent. Where leading historians of Enlightenment like Gibbon and Goldsmith had been private scholars, a tendency emerged towards the end of the 1 8th cent. for historical research to be conducted primarily at universities, where institutes and large libraries provided better working conditions than private study rooms. Unique conditions for historical research developed at the University of Gottingen, founded shortly before 17 50, where new subjects such as political science, technology and economics were highly prioritized, and even exerted an influence on research work in the traditional disciplines. In this climate, A.H.L. Heeren ( 1760-1842.), a student of Christian Gottlob Heyne and professor extraordinarius in philology, chose to specialize in ancient economic history - a most unusual decision at the time. His multi-volume work Jdeen uber die Politik, den Verkehr und den Handel der vornehmsten Volker der a/ten Welt ( 1st ed. 179 3-1796) ranges far and wide beyond the traditional thematic spectrum of classical philology. The Persians, Phoenicians, Babylonians, Carthaginians and Egyptians are dignified with just as comprehensive a presentation as the Greeks. The respective sections pay as close attention to political institutions as they do to economy and society. It is characteristic of Heeren's approach that the volume on ancient Greece opens with a detailed description of the geographical conditions as they impinged on the Greek economy. For his account of the social and economic conditions in early Greece, Heeren turns to analysis of the Homeric epics. The section on the Greek public economy in the period after the Persian Wars contains a comprehensive examination of slavery and the monetary system. Heeren's work is also important in the history of scholarship because it was a decisive inspiration for August Boeckh (1785-1867) to write his monograph Die Staatshaushaltung der Athener (1817). It thus occupies a position in that history between Enlightenment historiography and a scientific scholarly approach to the study of antiquity based on the examination of the sources.\n\nC. CLASSICAL STUDIES IN THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSITIES C.1. THE BEGINNINGS OF MODERN PHILOLOGY (1750-1850) Until the 18th cent., the study of Latin and Greek was largely considered part of theological training. Moreover, the main focus was on Latin, and within antiquarian research on\n\nRoman antiquities. This began to change, in the German-speaking world in particular, in the second half of the 18th cent. The influence of the Enlightenment led to a separation of philology from theology, and hence also to the establishment of new, independent philology 'seminars' (i.e. departments) at universities. A pioneering example appeared as early as 1738 at the reform university of Gottingen, with Johann Matthias Gesner as professor, but only in 1787 would a Seminarium philologicum be founded (in Halle under Friedrich August Wolf (1759-182.4)) with the explicit purpose of training not theologians but philologists and 'schoolmen' (Schulmanner). Other universities followed this lead in the years that followed, bringing about a complete dissociation of antiquarian research from theology. During the same period, attention also turned towards Greek literature and culture. This Philhellenism was stimulated firstly by Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717-1768) with his Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums ( 1764), a history of art from Egypt to the Romans in which Greece was portrayed as the high point, and secondly by the Essay on the Original Genius of Homer ( 1769) by the British amateur of antiquity Robert Wood (1716/J7-1771). This essay sprang from the spirit of the British cult of genius (which in turn inspired the later German Romanticism). The Greeks were now seen as the original geniuses, whereas Roman culture was disqualified as imitative. The denigration of everything Roman sat comfortably with the increasing anti-French sentiment in Germany insofar as the French were seen as the heirs of ancient Rome. The 'Neo-Humanism' that now gathered pace brought a tremendous boost to Greek studies, in the face of which Latin studies seemed doomed to fade away. In many respects, this Neo-Humanist precept of the superiority of the Greeks to the Romans continues to resonate to this day. Another defining characteristic that persists today is the radical turn of Neo-Humanist philology away from the Christian authors. Christian literature was now marginalized, and it has tended to remain on the peripheries of the history of literature as seen in classical philology ever since. In part, the genre became a specialist field of the fledgling discipline of Patristics, which had an important standard-bearer in Catholic France in Jacques-Paul Migne (1800-1875). Migne founded the edition of the complete Greek and Latin Church Fathers, the Patrologiae cursus completus (1844-1858), at over 400 volumes still not entirely superseded today as a series. The offspring of this project are the specialist Christian literature edition series Sources Chretiennes (bilingual, Latin/Greek-French) in France, the Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nFROM\n\nPETRARCH\n\nTO THE\n\n(CSEL; since 1864) in Vienna and the Corpus Christianorum (Series Latina I Graeca) (CCSUG; since 1947) in Belgium. The first important figure of Neo-Humanism was Christian Gottlob Heyne (1729-1812.), who taught at Gottingen from 1763. Heyne's erudition still combined antiquarian studies, or archaeology and history, with philology. But in contrast to the tendencies of earlier periods, his work was not primarily focused on textual criticism, but on the thematic interpretation of texts as a contribution to general cultural illumination. Heyne's student at Gottingen, Friedrich August Wolf, developed influential work at Halle that would be formative in Homeric research in particular. In his Prolegomena ad H omerum ( 179 5), still wholly in the spirit of Enlightenment criticism, Wolf attempted to demonstrate the oral roots of the Homeric poems and hence to show that such long poems could not possibly be the work of a single author. This anticipated later Homeric analysis and study of 'oral poetry', and it provoked reactions (from Goethe among others). The real Neo-Humanist programme, however, emerged from Wolf's lectures (which were published later) and his Darstellung der AlterthumsWissenschaft (1807). Neo-Humanist thought was also propagated by many other figures outside the strict field of philology, including Lessing, Wieland, Herder, Goethe and Schiller. As the 19th cent. dawned, there was a relatively swift turn away from Latin as the language of scholarship in universities in favour of the vernacular. Heyne's other students and the other Neo-Humanists now mostly published in German. This again clearly betrays, on a formal level, the onset of the paradigm shift. What was happening in the first years of the 19th cent. was a profound reformation of the university system in the German-speaking world. In Prussia, universities and higher schools were being reformed under the guiding influence of Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835; a student of Heyne's), leading to the foundation of the FriedrichWilhelms-Universitiit in Berlin ( 1810; now the Humboldt-Universitat) as the first 'modern' university, and of the Humanistisches Gymnasium, where both classical languages were core subjects of the curriculum. At around the same time in Bavaria, the Philhellenic Wittelsbachs were instigating similar educational reforms through the efforts of Friedrich Niethammer ( 1766-1848). The old-style university dominated by theology was thus effectively abolished in the two largest states of the German Confederation outside Habsburg Austria, replaced by a secular university modelled on the principles of the freedom of research and teaching, a model that was subsequently adopted in the other German states and\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY\n\nxxviii\n\nthat also set an example followed elsewhere in Europe and the United States. Finally, the foundation of important periodicals in the period after 1800 is also of relevance in the history of scholarship: these included the Rheinisches Museum (1827), Philologus (1846) and Hermes (1866). Humboldt succeeded in bringing the leading scholars of his day to his new Berlin university. In classical studies, for example, Friedrich August Wolf was tempted to Berlin with the promise of a pure research professorship with no teaching obligations. In 1811, Wolf's student August Boeckh (1785-1867) also came to Berlin, bringing with him a broad range of research interests including ancient history and epigra· phy. In 181 7, he wrote his Staatshaushaltung der Athener based mostly on epigraphic evidence, a work that founded Greek economic history. In collaboration with the Berliner Akademie der Wissenschaften, Boeckh found the Corpus lnscriptionum Graecarum. Like Wolf, Boeckh stood for the union of Wortphilologie ('philol· ogy of words') and Sachphilologie ('philology of things'), i.e. a comprehensive concept of philology as a study of the classical world, arguing for it in his lecture Encyclopiidie und Methodologie der philologischen Wissenschaften. At the other end of the spectrum was the Leipzig philologist Gottfried Hermann ( 1772-1848), who worked mostly as an editor and critic and espoused Wortphilologie. The Boeckh-Hermann controversy stimulated the methodological discourse in classical studies in the first half of the 19th cent. Ultimately, however, what increasingly came to prevail was a process of specialization, fragment• ing into the constituent disciplines of philology, archaeology, ancient history and linguistics. Other advocates of a more comprehensive understanding of classical studies were Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker (1784-1868), with works on the Epic Cycle and mythology, Boeckh's students Karl Otfried Muller ( 1797-1840) and Otto Jahn ( 1813-1869) - both working in the fields of history, archaeology and philology. Typical proponents of textual philology, on the other hand, included Immanuel Bekker (1785-1871) and the Homer scholar Karl Lehrs ( 1802-1878). Another universalist, and one influenced by NeoHumanism, was the theologian, philosopher and classical scholar Friedrich Daniel Schleiermacher ( 1768-1 8 34 ). Schleiermacher was one of the founders of the Berlin university, where he became a professor in 181 o, and he was also a moving force in the organization of the Berliner Akademie der Wissenschaften. Alongside his theological works, he prepared a complete German translation of the works of Plato that is still in use today, and he studied the chronology of the\n\nXXIX\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nPlatonic dialogues, seeking to demonstrate a historical process of development through Plato's works. In defiance of the Lutheran orthodoxies of his day, he thus opened his mind to pagan philosophy too, and this duly brought him into difficulties with the official Church. Historical linguistics as a distinct branch of classical studies was founded in Berlin by Franz Bopp ( 1791-1867), whose particular interest lay in the genetic interrelationship among the IndoEuropean languages. This kind of historical genealogical approach had antecedents in the works of the British colonial officer Sir William Jones and of Friedrich Schlegel (1772-1829), who compared the ancient Indian language Sanskrit with Greek and Latin, thereby disproving the traditional view that all languages derived ultimately from Hebrew. Bopp's research also influenced the new grammars and lexicons now being produced by philologists. Karl Lachmann ( 1793-1851 ), who is remembered today primarily as a pioneer of modern editorial philology, also pursued an interest in linguistics, publishing on Latin and Old German sound laws ('Lachmann's Laws'). Alongside his speciality in Latin literature (text editions of the Latin poets), his work on Old and Middle High German made him, along with his friends the Brothers Grimm, one of the founders of Old German studies. His text edition of the New Testament (first published 18 3 1) was a pioneering work of theology that follows modern criteria of textual criticism. Meanwhile, Wilhelm von Humboldt can fairly be called the father of general linguistics. He made synchronous comparisons of languages applying typological criteria, and, basing his work on Schlegel, developed the categories of inflected (Greek, Latin), agglutinative (Finnish, Turkish) and isolating (Chinese) languages that are still used today. In the Romantic tradition, Humboldt believed that it was possible to discern the 'spirit of the people' ( Volksgeist) in the structure of its language; he found the highly-inflected Greek language to be particularly admirable and therefore also 'improving'.\n\nFROM\n\nPETRARCH\n\nTO\n\nTHE\n\n20TH\n\nCENTURY\n\nNauck. These were joined by the Doxographi G raeci ( 1879) and Vorsokratikerfragmente (from 1903) edited by Hermann Diels (18481922), and later by Felix Jacoby's ( 1876-1959) Fragmente der griechischen Historiker (from 1923). Around 1900, publication began of the first volumes of the monumental Thesaurus Unguae Latinae founded by Eduard Wolfflin ( 183 1-1908 ), a project still not yet completed. Countless commentaries on ancient texts were also published at this time; although these were often intended as school texts, they readily tackled highly specialized philological issues (e.g. the Homer commentary by Ameis / Henze from 1863). In general, research in this period was not confined to universities alone: many schoolteachers and Gymnasium profs. also published industriously, contributing to specialist philological issues in the context of 'school programmes'. Archaeological excavations in Egypt brought ever more papyri to light, and these helped (and are still helping) to fill many gaps, especially in the Greek tradition. Hitherto unknown texts were found of works by Aleman, Alcaeus, Sappho, Pindar, Bacchylides, Menander and Herondas, as well as lost works by Callimachus, which now also bore witness to the high quality of Hellenistic poetry. The work of editing the papyri preoccupied not only German scholars bu"
