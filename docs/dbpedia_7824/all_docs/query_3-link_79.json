        "text": "I have a terrible fear that one day I will be pronounced holy.\n\n— Nietzsche, Ecce Homo\n\nOn September 15, Dr. Costin Alamariu published a revamped version of his dissertation under the title Selective Breeding and the Birth of Philosophy to great fanfare, becoming the 20th best-selling book on Amazon within two days.\n\nThe book has attracted significant enthusiasm, but little critical engagement with its thesis. Hitherto most criticisms of Dr. Alamariu have been impotent and uninformed screeds by mainstream conservatives, with the sole outcome of enhancing Dr. Alamariu’s prestige.\n\nThis essay aims to give Dr. Alamariu the challenge a thinker of his calibre rightfully merits.\n\nI won’t bore the reader with tedious exposition, and will cut right to the chase:\n\nPart 1 summarizes Alamariu’s thesis in a way that is both concise and comprehensive.\n\nPart 2 refutes it.\n\nPart 3 explains the historical origin of Alamariu’s exegesis of Plato.\n\nPart 4 addresses Dr. Alamariu’s intellectual project of “vitalism” and its shortcomings as a foundation for dissident right politics.\n\nSummary of Alamariu’s thesis\n\nFoundational criticisms of Alamariu’s thesis\n\n2a. The Männerbund hypothesis\n\n2b. The agroikos: wild man?\n\n2c. Nomos despotes: the problem of Sparta\n\n2d. Bellum et otium?\n\n2e. The erromenesteroi in Gorgias and the turannos eros\n\n2f. Greek eugeneia\n\n2g. Plato’s Academy as an institute for seizing power?\n\n2h. Nietzsche and the affirmation of life\n\n2i. Christianity and the “misbreeding” of man\n\nHistorical origins of the “political Plato” interpretation\n\nWhither vitalism?\n\n1) Summary of Alamariu’s thesis\n\nDr. Alamariu’s thesis goes as follows:\n\nThe central concept that pervades the entire book is the distinction between nomos (convention, tradition, positive law) and phusis (nature, heredity, stock). The two are in intrinsic opposition. The superior man is the “nomos-independent” man, for he has such a fullness of being from his inborn arete that he is driven by passions and ambitions which cannot be satisfied by any nomoi, city or settled life. The superior man is a wild man, the synthesis of beast and man with all the best qualities of the lion and fox. This distinction is also linked to an anthropological dichotomy: in distant prehistoric antiquity (which also perennially recurs in present-day social structures), the default state of life was the absolute rule of tribal elders, shamans and medicine men. There was no independent frame of reference beyond the despotism of ancestral custom. Such a society is at once ruthlessly egalitarian, collectivist and authoritarian. This began to change when these primitive tribal chiefdoms were conquered by virile steppe pastoralists, who layered themselves on top as a Herrenrasse (a ‘lordly race’ or master race). The resulting social bifurcation permitted the ruling race to create a pathos of distance between themselves and their lowly subjects, from which a concept of nature as an independent source of valuation could now be developed. This early speculation on nature/phusis was an outgrowth of the unique pursuits of the aristocracy: hunting, raiding, animal breeding, military drilling, etc. That is to say, “nature” was not some extrinsic speculation about the primary causes or essences of things, but an intrinsic description of the aristocracy’s own hereditary traits. Initially this is conveyed through mythopoetic means — stories about battle prowess, glory, half-man/half-animal creatures (reflecting the wild and liminal state outside of civilization in which the ancient Männerbünde of young warrior outlaws practiced their ecstatic rites so as to frenzy themselves up into a berserker fury — howling like wolves, barking like dogs — to then disperse and conquer sedentary farmers), and so on. Philosophy is a “radicalization” of aristocratic myth which for the first time takes an exoterically rationalistic and dialectical outlook, but esoterically seeks the rebarbarization of the superior man to free up his nature from the stifling conventions of the city — that is to say, to unleash the daimonion within him by unbridling his eros. Philosophical schools are thus a throwback to the Männerbünde of old, but this time made more sophisticated as “breeding projects” to create the superior man through the laws and nomoi of a eugenic polity (the ideal city). Paradoxically and very deliberately so, the goal of this new eugenic nomos (or more accurately, politeia) is to create a man who will surpass it in excellence and therefore destroy it by imposing his own phusis, having outgrown the conventions in which he was bred: the philosopher-tyrant. Or, at any rate, this is supposed to be the “radicalized” version of the aristocratic ideal when its own private mores have degenerated. However, Dr. Alamariu generally gives priority to such an aristocratic radicalism as his basic model for what an aristocracy aspires to.\n\nHence: “Though a certain kind of training may be necessary to cultivate [phusis], this is not primarily a matter of being taught, and certainly not being taught by nomos or custom,\n\nbut of being bred. The primary function of nomos is 'social control,' homogenization, taming, tribal survival, the continuation and preservation of mere life-through a regime of commands, speech and teaching that covers up and suppresses nature. Excellence, virtue, on the other hand, is a matter of nature, of blood, and it cannot be taught.”\n\nNomos and phusis manifest in other domains: nomos is the “mere life” of the anthropon (mortal), concerned with domesticity, menial labor and social obligations. Phusis is the higher life-affirmation of the andres (man, as distinguished from mere mortal): the love of war, adventure, piracy and perfect freedom which glorifies physical acts of vitality. Phusis is rude, savage and untamed — a man with phusis is said to be an agroikos, a man of the wilderness, one who descends from the agrios (fields or woods), a place that is “outside the walls” or “beyond the pale,” in which he learns secret skills from fantastical beings like the Centaur, which exist on the threshold between culture (ecstatic life of the higher man, self-cultivation, limitless ambition) and civilization (domesticated life of the inferior mortal, self-sacrifice to the herd, no outlet for own ambition). Phusis is about the phue, the living body that radiates its own power, in contrast to soma, the passive and lifeless corpse. Aristocratic education (paideia) is therefore education outside the city, the coming to the fore of what is already “in his blood,” likened to communion with divine beings and mythical beasts. Indeed, divinity itself is simply the awe-inspiring radiance of superior physique as perceived by the domesticated herd. Godhood is not outside but within the superior man.\n\nTherefore: “So far from being understood as a series of repeated attempts to reestablish order and settled life, Greek history, especially Greek aristocratic history, should rather be understood as a series of raids and incursions that seek reestablish the opposite. The original 'antinomian' aristocratic orientation is repeatedly revitalized.” Both the philosopher and the tyrant then emerge from an internal crisis of the aristocracy (implied to be racial degeneration), which creates types of men that are at once booming with vigor and passion, but which are no longer satisfied by the training regimen of the aristocracy. Each going their own ways, the philosopher and the tyrant both make their own superior natures the standards of all value, but in subtly different ways: the philosopher lusts after knowledge (which is really knowledge of breeding, the techne by which higher specimens can be produced) so as to perpetuate excellent breeds, whereas the tyrant lusts after imposing his own individual excellence in the here and now, to subdue a city and mold it into his own image for himself, but not necessarily for the race as a whole. Nevertheless, they are quite similar: the philosopher’s knowledge ultimately comes from himself and his own blood which he seeks to impose as a universal form, and similarly the tyrant wants to impose his blood unto others, but in a particular and unreflective way — the philosopher is, in other words, the self-aware tyrant who has learned the technique of reproducing his own kind in a way that is scientifically repeatable. Or, in Alamariu’s words: “Philosophy and tyranny are means of carving out, within the life of the city, 'game preserves' for the preservation of nature: the ancient aristocratic breeding project now unbound from the identity of any historical class or tribe and made abstract, is preserved by political philosophy as a kind of fossil.”\n\nPlato’s sympathies were with Callicles all along. In turn, Callicles’ position is simply the Archaic Greek aristocratic view of Theognis and Pindar. As Alamariu says, “Callicles reaches the dramatic and radical conclusion that the right by nature only shines out when convention is suppressed and violently broken. According to Callicles, nature is systematically hidden by convention. It is covered up by the somehow related forces of nomos, demos, and shame [aiskhune].”\n\nCallicles’ preoccupation is with how to emancipate from convention the raw material by which healthy human specimens can be bred, the erromenesteroi (ἐρρωμενέστεροι, ‘the stout, vigorous, in good health’), or the “better-turned-out” as Alamariu calls them. Dr. Alamariu makes the word erromenesteros the central concept in his reading of Gorgias, suggesting that it’s a key notion in the eugenic worldview of the Greek aristocracy. He uses the word some 28 times in the entire book and devotes extensive focus to it.\n\nOnce again, nomos versus phusis, as applied to philosophical knowledge: “…To try to tunnel into Callicles' mind for a\n\nmoment, consider that the pre-Socratic insight has two closely related, perhaps initially inextricable components: that there is a nature that is the same everywhere; and that human association is arbitrary or based on chance and circumstance. If a talented, ambitious, and erotic young man hears this and understands all of this to be true, liberation from the city's\n\nways becomes a necessity. To conform to the city's ways cannot be acceptable, because it has been agreed that the city as such consists only in the common decisions of the many. These common decisions lack all justification besides the word of the many, which is no justification at all.”\n\nTherefore, all forms of human association and civilized existence consist of connivances by which the weak masses organize themselves to magnify their brute strength against the beautiful and radiant power of Great Men — the city is ultimately built on fear of the Great Man, on strength through numbers, of quantity against quality. The self-preservation of the herd-instinct.\n\nSocrates’ great innovation over Callicles is to introduce the idea of politeia (regime, polity) which is the actualization of nomos by phusis. That is to say, it is a conventional regime instituted, indeed sculpted like a work of art, by the higher human specimens to perpetuate their posterity and liberate themselves from the herd. It is convention instantiated by force, by nature, by the higher type. “The politeia is at once the work of the law-giver, the nomothetes, literally the establisher of convention, and the source and sustainer of all particular nomoi.”\n\nPhilosophy, therefore, aims to pave the foundation for the lawgiver who will deliver the superior men from the stifling conventions of the herd, by creating a form of polity in which the herd is more perfectly subordinated to the superior men as docile helots, as instruments for the greater purposes of the superior, but exoterically justified with appeals to justice, virtue, and the common good. Philosophy must rule in the city.\n\nNietzsche’s aristocratic radicalism continues and attempts to revitalize the lineage starting from Theognis, Pindar, Callicles and Plato. This is the true esoteric meaning of Platonism: paideia (education, breeding) of higher specimens. The Platonic Academy was meant to be a Männerbund for the rearing of such specimens, who would go on to rule the cities and impose the law of nature, the right of the strong, over the slavish masses. This esoteric meaning was lost, leaving only the exoteric spiritual dimension of Neoplatonism, a kind of “Platonism for the people” that through its heir Christianity has led to the misbreeding of man and the rise of democracy, egalitarianism, socialism and communism. Nietzsche’s project is to restore the possibility for true culture and philosophy by resisting the calamitous tide of modern dysgenics. The transvaluation of values is precisely the rewilding or rebarbarization of man, the harnessing of the wilderness. This is because “Philosophy is liberation from nomos and return to nature and therefore to the 'teaching of force,' the teaching of the beast-the lion and the fox-which is 'regime-independent.'“\n\nThe ultimate revelation of philosophy: “Man as such is matter or raw material for the work of the legislator or founder.”\n\nI believe this is a fair summary of Dr. Alamariu’s work. Let us proceed to a deeper analysis of the arguments.\n\nFoundational criticisms of Alamariu’s thesis\n\n2a. The Männerbund hypothesis\n\nThroughout Dr. Alamariu’s book, we find the following word associations that are ubiquitously repeated:\n\nnature = wild = beast = hunting = breeding = virtue = excellence = Männerbund = philosophy = tyranny = animal power = culture\n\nconvention = city = labor = family = domesticated = egalitarian = tribal = ancestral = gerontocratic = democratic = civilization\n\nThese comprise the basic conceptual framework of the whole work, and it is essential that blood, breeding and nature manifest in a space completely outside of convention, obligation, and sedentary life. The Männerbund - the primeval warband - is the archetype of the natural (excellent, powerful) hierarchy, to be distinguished from mere association which is only conventional.\n\nIndeed, in sharp contrast to the usual motto of “Blut und Boden” (blood and soil), Alamariu’s basic message is that blood and soil are mutually antagonistic concepts.\n\nThe term Männerbund is the traditional appellation for what has more recently been categorized under the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European noun *kóryos. The former originated in German scholarship in the 1900s, and in fact was initially used to describe initiatory male societies among African, Polynesian and American Indian peoples. It quickly became a term of art in Indo-Germanic studies by the 1920s with a short work by Lily Weiser, who in turn influenced its most important exponent - Otto Höfler.\n\nDr. Alamariu mentions the usual classics of Indo-European comparativism, including Stig Wikander and Georges Dumézil.\n\nCuriously absent from his references, however, is Otto Höfler. It was precisely Höfler who perfected the Männerbund theory as an ideal type in Indo-European comparative mythology and linguistics, and nearly all subsequent treatments are indebted to him at least indirectly. His 1934 work Kultische Geheimbünde der Germanen presented the theory in the context of the Germanic peoples, drawing from Tacitus, Old Norse sagas and German folklore.\n\nThe Männerbund does not mean just any military brotherhood or male fellowship. Rifle clubs, hunting parties, fraternal lodges and things of this sort are not true anthropological Männerbünde, though the concept is widely vulgarized in this way for the purposes of political exhortation.\n\nThe Männerbund in the proper sense is a youthful warband living in a liminal space completely outside of any settled life, not subject to any superior outside the brotherhood, sustaining itself purely out of rapine and loot without any fixed wealth or property, and possessing an esoteric spiritual dimension in the form of initiatory cultic rites, theriomorphic transformations into wild animals (especially canids), and rituals meant to achieve a furious state of daemonic ecstasy such as biting of shields, frantic war cries, howling, and so on.\n\nLet me quote the relevant passages from Dr. Alamariu:\n\nNow let us briefly consider a third and even more specific institution of pastoral aristocratic society that could have, again, presented a model or principle of life separate from and even antagonistic to nomos or convention. This is the institution of the warband, or the warrior band of youth.\n\nTacitus’ account is hardly the only example, though. The same institution existed arguably in very early Rome—Romulus’ comitatus was such a warband—and in the most primitive period of Greece. The war band of youths who live outside the rest of the tribe is associated across cultures with the totemic symbol of the wolf—Romulus’ and Remus’ being reared by a wolf is not unique by any means—and in general with “wolfish” images or themes. An image of this phenomenon exists in the Iliad in the form of Achilles’ war band, especially in Book XVI, where they are compared to a band of wolves. Sparta, which was likely founded by a Dorian warband and which existed to support such a warband parasitically, had for its founder Lycurgus, the “wolf-worker.” This then is yet another cultural feature by virtue of which the Greek mind was able to move beyond the strictures and absolute rule of ancestral nomos, beyond the primitive “rule of elders” that characterizes all early society, and that, again, seemingly provides no “out” from within. The comitatus was independent and not under the control of tribal elders—it represents an important, and perhaps unique, exception to the ubiquity of ancestral nomos or custom that we have seen both Frazer and Strauss describe in some detail.\n\nFurthermore the warband was understood to be essentially lawless, and of the wilderness—initiation into the warband meant life with companions in the wilderness. The youths saw themselves as wild dogs or wolves, and inhabited by the wilderness, outside the bounds of tribal convention. The warband was mythically associated with shape-shifting, “externality,” the transgression of boundaries between the dead and the living, and so on. In fine, it represented in every way a transgression of nomos and its bounds as such, it enthusiastically embraced, not the preservation of mere life, but in fact death and a vital, martial, orgiastic element that was believed to reside in the wilderness, outside the boundaries home and of the tribe. This dangerous cultural institution, that could become a calamity for the tribe itself at any time—could it be that, aside from offering, as such, a model for “life outside convention” or a principle that is opposed to convention—could it be that it also forms the cultural prototype for the philosophical school or sect? And also forms the prototype for the piratical tyrant and his bodyguard or war band, above all law and all responsibility to home and hearth? Certainly it appears that Plato himself connected the tyrant to the “wolfish man,” and in turn both to the fraternity of young warriors.\n\nLater, commenting on Pindar:\n\nThis is a recreation of the primeval Mannerbund, morya, comitatus or, in Greek, kouros, ephebes, hetairia, the society of young warriors, mentioned already in the first chapter—the raw material or most basic form from which, as we will see, the philosophical brotherhoods and schools of a later time will take their form as from an archetype.\n\nDr. Alamariu therefore rightly emphasizes the theriomorphic, cultic and daemonic aspects of the Männerbund.\n\nThe Männerbund theory plays a central role as the anthropological (and not just allegorical) grounding of Alamariu’s conceptual framework — phusis as wild and untamed nature outside of convention, and nomos as the domesticated and servile existence of mere life bound by despotic ancestral custom. Not only that, Alamariu directly states that philosophy and philosophical academies were meant to revitalize the primitive ecstasy of these Männerbunde in an exoterically rational context. Since both the philosopher and the tyrant are “nomos-independent men,” the product of breeding for rebarbarization, they exist in the same relationship to the city as the ancient wolf-warrior did to the village.\n\nDr. Alamariu is quite fond of animal similes as evidence. Now before I get to the source evidence for Männerbünde, I would like to bring up a couple of examples that can illustrate the pitfalls of using the comparative method in a way that rashly presupposes genetic continuity.\n\nWe find, in various medieval hagiographies and chronicles, comparisons of Old Prussians and Polabian Slavs (both pagan) to wolves and dogs. In one of the lives of St. Adalbert of Prague, who was martyred by Old Prussians, written in the early 11th century, an encounter with hostile heathens is presented like so: “Suddenly a long line of dogs' heads surrounds the heaven-dweller. They spread their bloodthirsty jaws open and ask: 'Where did he come from? What is he looking for? Why did he come, whom no one had summoned?' The wolves are thirsty for blood, they threaten with death: Why did he come to them risking his life?”.\n\nGumpold of Mantua’s Passion of St. Wenceslaus reports on the fate of the men who martyred him: “As it has been truthfully related to us many times, after the triumph of the most steadfast athlete, all those who spilt his innocent blood were struck by anger from above and were either seized by the power of demons and never appeared again among people, or they changed their nature and began to bark like dogs instead of speaking, imitating the dog's bite by gnawing their teeth; or again, they withered in pitiful dryness of body and, forever deprived of their hearing, soon ended their hateful life.”\n\nNow the way that many an Indo-Europeanist would approach this, especially the more enthusiastic among them like Kris Kershaw, is to start linking this to a grabbag of legends and stories about cynocephaly, the Harii in Tacitus, the ulfheðinn of Norse legend, stories of lycanthropy from Arcadia, and so on — in a completely synchronic fashion with little regard to differences in time and place, assuming a pristine and unbroken line of cultural continuity from the Rigveda to whatever other unconverted Indo-European nation happens to be analyzed. The conclusion would be that these saints must have encountered a cultic wolf-warrior brotherhood.\n\nThe actual explanation is much simpler. All of these stories were written in a monastic literary context, where sources like the Bible, Virgil and Isidore would be paramount. The wild barking dogs are the ones outside the gates of heaven in Revelation 22:15 (“Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood”), i.e. a befitting description of heathens.\n\nNow the most famous piece of evidence for the Männerbund is, of course, the archaeological site at Krasnosamarskoe. And while Anthony and Brown have done very fascinating and valuable work on it, there is something of a circularity in their case: they rely on the pre-established certainty of the comparative-mythological and linguistic evidence to make the identification. But as we shall see, said evidence is far from certain. But this poses a much bigger problem for Dr. Alamariu than for archaeologists. For the latter, it is sufficient that the koryos should have existed at some distant point. But for the former, it is the sole culture-bearing force against all forms of primitive-democratic domesticity.\n\nThe quintessential Germanic Männerbund theory is, as mentioned, that of Otto Höfler. It consists of drawing several connections: the Chatti and Harii described by Tacitus are linked to the Scandinavian berserkirs, who in turn are linked to the einherjar (the ghost army in Valhalla), and finally to the modern folklore motif of the Wild Hunt about nocturnal processions of the dead. On balance we therefore have at least a good thousand years of daemonic initiatory death cults forming the backbone of Germanic history, and leaving their trace in guilds and other later medieval fellowships.\n\nLet’s start with the berserkirs.\n\nThe linguistic difficulties in decoding the phenomenon of berserkirs behind the fragmentary source evidence we have were well described by Anatoly Liberman in 2005. The famous word ulfheðnar (wolfskin) appears to be a hapax legomenon attested as a common noun solely in the skaldic poem Hrafnsmál, where it is used right next to berserkir. All subsequent Norse sagas speak of berserkirs only. One should therefore assume they are the same. Since this is so ‘ber-’ should probably be read as it was by the first philologists who studied the question — bareshirts, not bearshirts. Note that “bare” does not mean nude. It simply means fighting without chain mail on.\n\nThe definitive categorization of berserkir references in the Norse sagas was undertaken by Roderick Dale. Whenever berserkirs show up, they basically correspond to one of four archetypes: a) elite warriors in the royal hird, b) braggards who go around challenging other warriors in mead-halls, c) bandits and marauders who prey on farmers only to be thwarted by the hero, or d) viking raiders and privateers who typically share their loot with other lords or kings. None of these correspond to the ideal type of the koryos, unless one squints really hard to turn any kind of privateer and mercenary into a koryos-brother — but privateers work under a contract to deliver goods to a superior, and they “commute” back to their settled base. And most importantly a privateer isn’t generally an outlaw in his society.\n\nBerserkirs were regarded as a criminal nuisance at least by the early 11th century, and the Grettirs saga records the Norwegian earl (and de facto king) Eiríkr Hákonarson outlawing both berserkirs and dueling:\n\nBefore leaving Eirik summoned all his Landmen and the larger bondis to meet him. Eirik the jarl was an able ruler, and they had much discussion regarding the laws and their administration. It was considered a scandal in the land that pirates and berserks should be able to come into the country and challenge respectable people to the holmgang for their money or their women, no weregild being paid whichever fell. Many had lost their money and been put to shame in this way; some indeed had lost their lives. For this reason jarl Eirik abolished all holmgang in Norway and declared all robbers and berserks who disturbed the peace outlaws. Thorfinn the son of Kar of Haramarsey, being a man of wise counsel and a close friend of the jarl, was present at the meeting.\n\nClearly by this point we are not dealing with relics of an ancient koryos, but with common bandits and thieves. No doubt these bandits would have had some sort of thieves’ cant among themselves, but that is a very far cry from a cultic initiatory brotherhood dedicated to a host of the dead. And an even further cry from any kind of culture.\n\nIn the Brennu-Njáls saga (chapter 99) we have a gang of heathen berserkirs being bested by the Christian missionary Thangbrand.\n\nThe only connection we have between the berserkirs and Odin’s army is in Snorri’s Ynglinga saga. That Iceland had been thoroughly Christianized by the time Snorri wrote is no longer in doubt from the evidence, romantic longings to the contrary notwithstanding. Since Snorri would have mostly known berserkirs as bandits, the association with heathenry is only too natural. But there is an even more important point which has seldom been raised: Snorri does not portray Odin as a deity or spirit in the Ynglinga saga, but as a crafty magician who had settled to Scandinavia from the East and dazzled the people with his skills in sorcery and scald-craft such as to deify him: “He taught the most of his arts to his priests of the sacrifices, and they came nearest to himself in all wisdom and witch-knowledge. Many others, however, occupied themselves much with it; and from that time witchcraft spread far and wide, and continued long. People sacrificed to Odin and the twelve chiefs from Asaland, and called them their gods, and believed in them long after.” This is very far from an authentically pagan or even particularly flattering portrayal, and the rage of the berserkirs is attributed to sorcery, quite in line with Biblical views where witchcraft is one of the works of the flesh in Galatians 5:19-21 alongside “enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions.”\n\nLiberman therefore rightly concludes:\n\nIf we dismiss idle speculations, we will come up with the following results. Some warriors were at one time called berserkir. They seem to have been elite troops renowned for their recklessness in battle; they may have fought without coats of mail. It is unclear whether folk etymology connected them with bears and whether Snorri or anyone heard an allusion to ber- ‘bear’ in their name. They had nothing to do with religious cults. Even in the oldest eddic lays, the word berserkr has an archaic ring, but it survived in people’s memory and degraded into a synonym for ‘fighter’. With the end of the Viking epoch, professional warriors found themselves unemployed. A similar disintegration of the military class happened when the epoch of chivalry and crusades came to an end, and in recent times when a huge contingent of the Soviet army went out of business. Displaced soldiers typically become urban riffraff. Unused to resistance, irascible, and thoroughly unhappy, former Vikings often developed psychoses that plagued the Middle Ages (cf. St. Vitus’s dance, flagellants, and so forth), the violent analogs of depression, the scourge of our time. The disease was contagious, and its symptoms were easy to simulate. The very words berserkr, like the word vikingr, acquired highly negative connotations. Gangs of such outcasts (young, unmarried, destitute men in their prime) became the bane of farmers’ life in Norway and later in Iceland. Laws against berserkers and active attempts to eradicate them make their existence an established fact, even if all the adventures in the sagas were concocted for enlivening the plot. The rest, from poisonous mushrooms to secret unions and service to Óðinn, is (science) fiction.\n\nThe Wild Hunt fares no better, and much of the scholarship around it has been subject to a thorough reappraisal by Ronald Hutton. “Wild Hunt” is itself a rather artificial taxonomy imposed by Jacob Grimm on disparate folkloristic evidence. Antiquity does not record any legends corresponding to armies, companies or retinues of the dead roaming the sky.\n\nThe legend of visible companies of the dead leading nocturnal processions only emerges in the 11th century as a direct consequence of reforms in Christian penitential practice. The “army of the dead” are in fact the souls in purgatory:\n\nThe turning point in the making of such a tradition came in the eleventh century, when a greatly enhanced interest in the fate of the Christian dead becomes obvious in literary sources: as both Jean-Claude Schmitt and Jean Verdon have noted, accounts of ghosts in general become both more common and more detailed, and the trend continued into the twelfth (Schmitt 1994, 191; Verdon 2002, 54-56). As part of it, the dead were more often represented as gathering in groups. In the early eleventh century, Rodulfus Glaber of Cluny told a story of how a living monk met a throng of Christians martyred by Muslims, preparing to journey to heaven together (Duby 1967, 77). From the middle of the century comes a tale of two brothers who saw a crowd of people passing through the air, one of whom identified himself as their father, doomed to roam until they made good a wrong that he had committed (Otloh, Book of Visions, quoted in Lecouteux 2011, 34).\n\nIn the same period an archdeacon of Toul recorded how a vast company in white was seen near the city of Narni, one of whom explained to a citizen that they were souls not yet fit for heaven, doing penance by visiting holy places (Wipert 1923). This new concept of moving groups of penitential dead forms the backdrop to the celebrated account by the Anglo-Norman monk Ordericus Vitalis, from the 1130s, of how a Norman priest to whom he himself had spoken claimed to have seen a long and noisy procession of the dead on New Year’s Night 1091 or 1092 (Ordericus 1973, bk 8, chap. 17). It was made up of people from all divisions of society, on foot or horse and in varieties of dress in accordance with their former station, and all were being tormented in a manner appropriate to their sins during life: most attention in the account was paid to the armoured knights. Demons were active in it, and a giant, the nature of whom is never discussed, preceded it. The story emphasized the point that masses and prayers offered by the living for those tortured in the procession could shorten their sufferings and eventually release them. The priest who told it added that he had been left ill for a week by the encounter.\n\nSince the so-called “Wild Hunt” is a Christian legend with origins among clergy, any connection to the einherjar in Valhalla or the Harii of Tacitus is immediately ruled out. This, coupled with the evidence that berserkirs were either elite champions in the royal hird or marauding bandits rather than any cultic antinomian brotherhood, just about smashes the Germanic Männerbund theory.\n\nBut we must also add the famous comitatus, described by Tacitus as “[having] no home or land or occupation; they are supported by whomsoever they visit, as lavish of the property of others as they are regardless of their own, till at length the feebleness of age makes them unequal to so stern a valour.” The comitatus is therefore defined by its pure reliance on rapine, very much the ideal type of the koryos.\n\nThe comitatus, assuming it had ever existed in pure form, would have been defunct by the start of the Migration Period circa the 4th century. Tacitus was writing circa 95-98 AD, at a time when Germanic national histories, written law codes and comital administration barely existed — which, of course, raises a significant difficulty right off the bat in singling out the comitatus as the bearer of culture. In the 5th century Burgundian laws, comites are royal judges. The same was true of the Salian Franks and then the Merovingians. Indeed, the whole concept smacks of a Romanism: the comitatus was the name of the personal travelling retinue of the Roman Emperor while out on campaign, and existed precisely under that name during the reign of Domitian, when Tacitus was writing Germania. All recordings of comitati among Germanic societies after Tacitus invariably occur within a Romano-Germanic cultural synthesis. The term comitatus has frequently been applied to Anglo-Saxon society, despite being completely inappropriate due to the presence of retainership based on land grants and fyrd (militia) duty to maintain bridges, fortresses and other fortifications. Indeed, the very existence of permanent fortifications and garrison duty immediately puts us outside the classical Männerbund. Archaeological evidence shows the widespread proliferation of gold arm and neck-rings beginning in the 4th century, which are consistently associated in Old Norse sources as gifts by the king to his most trusted retainers and housecarls, which implies personal dependence on a ruler and not the perfect freedom of a warband.\n\nAt one point, Dr. Alamariu suggests that the luperci (the priests of the Lupercalian festival in Rome) were originally a wolf-warrior brotherhood that founded the Etruscan state. The luperci, however, did not wear wolfskins but rather goatskins, in devotion to the god Pan. The misunderstanding comes from the fact that Pan had a cult in Arcadia at Mount Lykaion, under the title “Pan Lykaion,” leading later writers to posit a false wolf etymology. The luperci probably did not exist prior to the close of the 5th century BC, and not as anything besides a priestly college.\n\nThe Athenian ephebeia was not a koryos, either. It was public garrison duty established c.330 BC by Lycurgus of Athens, roughly a century after the death of Pericles. Prior to that, ephebos meant the age of maturity for becoming a full citizen, and it involved swearing an “ancestral ephebic oath” to “be obedient to whoever exercise power reasonably on any occasion and to the laws currently in force and any reasonably put into force in the future,” the very embodiment of nomos if there ever was one.\n\nAlamariu then brings up the cult of Zeus Lykaios:\n\nCertainly it appears that Plato himself connected the tyrant to the “wolfish man,” and in turn both to the fraternity of young warriors.\n\nThe comparison comes in Book VIII of Republic, and let’s see what kind of “wolfish man” the tyrant is:\n\nAnd the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen; by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen; some he kills and others he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands: and after this, what will be his destiny? Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a man become a wolf --that is, a tyrant?\n\n…\n\nAt first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and he salutes every one whom he meets; --he to be called a tyrant, who is making promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and distributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so kind and good to every one!\n\n…\n\nHas he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him? Clearly.\n\nIn fact, the analogy to the rite at Mount Lykaios is brought up while on the subject of the origin of tyranny from democracy. This seems quite remote from the natural aristocratic code of a wolf-warrior outlaw that Alamariu posits.\n\nActually the original words in Republic 565d are:\n\nτίς ἀρχὴ οὖν μεταβολῆς ἐκ προστάτου ἐπὶ τύραννον; ἢ δῆλον ὅτι ἐπειδὰν ταὐτὸν ἄρξηται δρᾶν ὁ προστάτης τῷ ἐν τῷ μύθῳ ὃς περὶ τὸ ἐν Ἀρκαδίᾳ τὸ τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ Λυκαίου ἱερὸν λέγεται;\n\nWhat, then, is the starting-point of the transformation of a protector into a tyrant? Is it not obviously when the protector's acts begin to reproduce the legend that is told of the shrine of Lycaean Zeus in Arcadia\n\nτῷ μύθῳ — the myth. Plato is actually thinking of a specific myth here: the story of the Olympic boxer Damarchus, who according to Pausanias:\n\nAs for the boxer, the Arcadian from Parrhasia named Damarchus, all the things the charlatans say about him are unbelievable to me, except, that is, for his victory at Olympia. They say that he changed from a man into the form/appearance [eidos] of a wolf at the sacrifice to Lykaian Zeus and that after this he became a man again in the tenth year. Nor does it seem to me that the Arcadians say this about him, for if so it would be stipulated by the inscription at Olympia. It says this: ‘Damarchus son of Dinytas, a man of Parrhasia in Arcadia by birth, dedicated this statue.’ This is as far as it goes.\n\nAll versions of the Damarchus story involve a passage of 9 or 10 years between the transformation into a wolf and the return to human form. Even if we take this at face value, a decade is far too long to count as a rite of passage for a juvenile koryos, and consequently the myth’s origins probably have nothing to do with any “fraternity of young warriors.”\n\nDr. Alamariu’s passion for seeing ancient Aryan wolf-warriors everywhere leads him to some really fascinating readings. Witness how he interpets the legend of Jason and the Argonauts:\n\nA young man of wild nature—Jason, or Achilles—who has been bred for power and trained in the wilderness by Cheiron the man-beast, returns to claim his place as ruler by superior right—superior physical power and daring, and superior prudence, or counsel in war. The false king, the suppressor and usurper of nature—Pelias, Agamemnon, king nomos— through trickery, perfidy or cowardice casts out the hero and his companions from the realm. The hero and his young companions are now an independent society of warriors or pirates on the outskirts of society, superior by nature, but outside all law and custom. They undertake many hard tasks and adventures, loving danger and exhibiting contempt for mere life and for death. They return to take power as rightful rulers of their society or become rulers of a new society, which they take by superior physical force and by trickery, often winning the daughters of the false kings.\n\nI am rather curious how Dr. Alamariu reads the plot of Argonautica as an “independent society of pirates outside all law and custom” fighting against the gerontocratic nomos. Jason has tears in his eyes as he leaves his fatherland, he calls upon Apollo and the Pythian oracle, declares that “even the most shameless [of men], reverence the ordinance of Zeus, god of strangers, and regard it,” and the main act of the plot is set up and maintained by the divine intervention of Hera, who vows to deliver Jason in order to punish Pelias for leaving her unhonored with sacrifice. Fortune and providence are the main themes, not voluntarism. I suppose Dr. Alamariu is thinking of some hypothetical “original” version of the legend according to koryos theory, but then that is pure conjecture.\n\nIn the Indo-Iranian case, too, by the time that Herodotus was writing, the “kara” was the professional retinue of the king, not a warband: “Also in Darius’ Behistun inscription (Old Persian II.17), the king calls his own forces kāra Pārsa utā Māda [Persian and Median army] which were under his direct control.”\n\nIn summary: the evidence for the Männerbund is a lot shakier than the confidence of many Indo-Europeanists would suggest. But the essential question isn’t the abstract point of whether it existed (in some distant and inaccessible past it must have), but whether culture and breeding arose from it. Suffice to say, no. Think of all the Baltic Slav and Wendish pirates who lived a wild life of raiding on the frontier without having either a culture or a civilization, and getting conquered by an imperial nomos which did. It is not until warbands beat swords into ploughshares and establish a fixed settlement in the form of a patriarchal household and inheritance of land, at which point primeval warbands become proper levies of troops, that culture begins. Endogamous norms are henceforth enforced by class stratification and private laws. Dr. Alamariu’s obsession with perpetually roving and landless bands of vagabonds isn’t simply dubious history, it is, above all, a sign of infantilism and arrested development in his core vision.\n\n2b. The agroikos: wild man?\n\nAn example of where Dr. Alamariu’s bare etymological approach fails him and does not substantiate his crucial equivalence “philosopher = tyrant = wild man = nature,” is in his discussion of the word agroikos (ἄγροικος) as used in Gorgias.\n\nAlamariu writes:\n\nCallicles is not sufficiently “de-civilized” enough, for he has not learned at the hands of a Cheiron in the woods—his teacher has been the urbane orator Gorgias, and not a “wild” man like Socrates, who is repeatedly called agroikos in this dialogue.\n\nSocrates’ agroikia or barbaric wildness becomes quite significant both in the Gorgias and in the Hippias Major, and especially revealing for us; see above, Pindar on Cheiron where he is called agroteron using a similar word.\n\nFurthermore … Socrates has repeatedly been called rude to the point of being agroikos, not of the city. Although Callicles’ statements are the ones that appear most overtly anti-conventional and radical, the means by which Socrates shames him justifies the description of Socrates as agroikos: a wild man, not of the city, rude in the extreme.\n\nThe relevant passages include: a) Gorgias 462e — “μὴ ἀγροικότερον ᾖ τὸ ἀληθὲς εἰπεῖν,” conventionally translated as “I fear it may be too rude to tell the truth.” and b) Gorgias 461c where Polus tells Socrates “ἀλλ᾽ εἰς τὰ τοιαῦτα ἄγειν πολλὴ ἀγροικία ἐστὶν τοὺς λόγους” (“I call it very bad taste (rude) to lead the discussion in such a direction.”)\n\nAs we see, Alamariu insists on reading this as an animal simile between the “agroikos” and the figure of Chiron, the cenotaur who raised many noted Greek heroes like Achilles and Jason.\n\nWe therefore have to ask ourselves: how was the “agroikos” used in the Greek textual corpus around Plato’s time? What we find is that the “agroikos” had by then become a fixed character archetype and a stock character in comedies. And the connotation is the exact opposite that Alamariu suggests: the “agroikos” (the boor) was not a wild and erotic man, but a domesticated and dull one. The relevant evidence comes from Aristotle, Theophrastus and Aristophanes.\n\nIn Book II of the Nicomachean Ethics we read:\n\nFor the man who flies from and fears everything and does not stand his ground against anything becomes a coward, and the man who fears nothing at all but goes to meet every danger becomes rash; and similarly the man who indulges in every pleasure and abstains from none becomes self-indulgent, while the man who shuns every pleasure, as boors do, becomes in a way insensible; temperance and courage, then, are destroyed by excess and defect, and preserved by the mean.\n\nWith regard to pleasantness in the giving of amusement the intermediate person is ready-witted and the disposition ready wit, the excess is buffoonery and the person characterized by it a buffoon, while the man who falls short is a sort of boor and his state is boorishness.\n\nSo the boor is characterized by his insensitivity to pleasure and his inability to enjoy himself.\n\nTheophrastus’ Characters also gives a sketch of boorishness:\n\nHe is wary of friends and family, but asks advice from his servants on the most important matters. He describes to hired laborers in the field all the proceedings of the city assembly.\n\nThis is very far from an untamed warrior who only consults with his koryos-brothers, if anyone.\n\nBut most revealing of all is the character of Strepsiades in Aristophanes’ Clouds, who refers to himself as an “agroikos” (translated as rustic) in this monologue:\n\nAlas! Would that the match-maker had perished miserably, who induced me to marry your mother. For a country life used to be most agreeable to me, dirty, untrimmed, reclining at random, abounding in bees, and sheep, and oil-cake. Then I, a rustic, married a niece of Megacles, the son of Megacles, from the city, haughty, luxurious, and Coesyrafied. When I married her, I lay with her redolent of new wine, of the cheese-crate, and abundance of wool; but she, on the contrary, of ointment, saffron, wanton-kisses, extravagance, gluttony, and of Colias and Genetyllis.\n\nThe agroikos (boor) therefore, is a stuck-up peasant who “abounds in bees, sheep and oil-cake,” and is something of an ascetic and miser in his disposition. In short, he is a thoroughly domesticated man.\n\nPolus’ rebuke to Socrates, calling him a boor, should therefore more accurately be read not as indicating that Socrates has a wild nature outside the nomos, but that on the contrary he is showing a lack of proper symposium etiquette that every aristocrat must know — after all, what good is hunting without feasting? Alamariu’s example does not work.\n\n2c. Nomos despotes: the problem of Sparta\n\nIf there ever was a polity that exemplified the eugenic ideal, it was definitely Sparta. Yet it is precisely here that we run into trouble if we insist on Dr. Alamariu’s specific reading of nomos versus phusis.\n\nIt seems that Dr. Alamariu is on some level aware of this, which is evident in the constant vacillation and ambivalence he has about Sparta throughout the book.\n\nOn the one hand, in passages like these, Alamariu cites Sparta as an exemplar of his framework:\n\nSparta was a “fossil,” preserving very early customs and regime form; and is therefore especially valuable in understanding what is fundamental or original to the Greek aristocratic orientation. The importance of Sparta and other Dorian-type regimes for the aristocratic Greek value system, and particularly in the work of Plato and Xenophon, is a commonplace in the literature. But what it appeared to have consisted in, yet again, is the imposition and preservation of a “wild,” war-band based, martially regimented but, most of all, unsettled way of life on top of a servile, provincial, settled way of life. The latter is only prized insofar as it gives greater freedom and intensity of expression to the former.\n\nIt is then entirely to this purpose that the Greek state is directed and therefore this purpose—the creation of military genius—is in some sense the original “intention” of nature. The “return to nature” is an “ascent to nature,” to the nature of the genius, originally of the military genius. Human nature is “achieved” or manifested in the production of genius. The martial state, the Spartan state, is the prototype of the state: in its being dedicated to the production of military genius it lays the precondition, or presents the model, for the state as dedicated to the production of genius more generally, for the state as the cultivation of human nature or as the staging ground of higher culture.\n\nBut in other passages Dr. Alamariu isn’t so sure. For instance, he also compares the Spartan gerousia to the tribal elders of the domesticated nomos:\n\nIn the passage above the role of the Brahmans as hereditary priests could be seen as roughly analogous to the that of the primitive “council of elders” in prephilosophic societies; similarly so for the ruling body that could depose a Spartan king after eight years.\n\nAs well, Dr. Alamariu views Sparta as a potentially strong objection to Callicles’ argument, and he has to engage in some handwaving to disarm it:\n\nCan such a thing be said about the conventions in Sparta or Egypt? It is possible to maintain that in some way such things can be said about any regime: that despite its form, mass rule, or oligarchic, or even one-man rule, that in the end it is all still for the benefit of the multitude and set up for their sake. And Callicles is not a Spartan sympathizer.\n\nMost pertinently of all:\n\nA problem, however, appears at this point: for it is not clear yet how and why an aristocracy as such should produce high culture, let alone philosophy. After all, Sparta is the aristocratic regime that fits the model discussed so far par excellence and yet it produced no high culture to speak of, and no philosophy; and, tellingly, managed to suppress its tyrannical or great men—among whom, Pausanias, Lysander, Brasidas, Clearchus.\n\n…\n\nSparta was able to create what Nietzsche would call monstrous or amazing specimens as a result of its regime, but this never resulted in a flowering of high culture. This may have something to do with the fact that Spartan aristocracy never had a period of decay or decline in the sense of the Athenian aristocracy: the Spartan regime did not have a political collapse, it ended because it simply ran out of men; for example, after the second Battle of Mantinea, when it was only able to field a few hundred heavy infantry.\n\nWe observe that Sparta poses a very genuine problem for Dr. Alamariu’s thesis, as he himself worriedly admits. He can’t quite put his finger on whether it truly exemplifies phusis or nomos. In some places, he insists on Doric Sparta as the paradigm of the ancient Maennerbund, the Doric invasion the strongest example of the preconditions for the aristocratic pathos of distance from which the study of nature develops, and the Spartan regime as a genuine politeia that produced the highest of specimens. But in other places he identifies it with gerontocratic tendencies, the suppression of tyrannical-wild-erotic men, and the lack of high culture. He tries to resolve this aporia by saying that Sparta was, in some sense, too good and pure to have had true culture; that there was no period of degeneration (only a shortage of manpower) for tyrannical men to emancipate themselves from nomos and in so doing lay the foundations for philosophy and culture. But this is hardly persuasive, as it still implies that nomos can be associated with the production of higher specimens.\n\nDr. Alamariu’s worries are by no means misplaced, for we shall see that Sparta is a major complication for his recurring nomos-versus-phusis argument.\n\nThe Spartans were characterized by an immense religious piety and devotion to ancestral custom. This is made abundantly clear by both Herodotus and Thucydides.\n\nAll Spartan military commanders were obligated to perform a sacrifice (diabateria, διαβατήρια) upon exiting the Laconian frontier. If the sacrifice was not performed correctly, they had to return.\n\nThucydides 5.55:\n\nThe Lacedaemonians also drew forth their army against Caryae; but then again, their sacrifice for passage being not to their mind, they returned.\n\nThucydides 5.116:\n\nThe winter following, the Lacedaemonians being about to enter with their army into the territory of the Argives, when they perceived that the sacrifices which they made on the border for their passage were not acceptable, returned. And the Argives, having some of their own city in suspicion in regard of this design of the Lacedaemonians, apprehended some of them, and some escaped.\n\nIndeed, this was considered obligatory conduct for any kind of general into the Hellenistic period. Onasander’s Strategikos directs:\n\nBefore the general leads out his army he must see that it is purified, by such rites as either the laws or soothsayers direct, and must avert whatever taint there is in the state or in any citizen, by expiatory sacrifices.\n\nWhile we’re at it, Onasander also recommends that generals ought to be married men, an ideal far removed from the wild koryos:\n\nI should prefer our general to be a father, though I would not refuse a childless man, provided he be a good man. For if he happens to have young children, they are potent spells to keep his heart loyal, availing to bind him to the fatherland, a power­ful and keen incentive to a father, capable of arousing his heart against the foe. And should his children have reached manhood, they will become advisers and aides, faithful guardians of his secrets, and they will help him to bring the affairs of state to a success­ful issue.\n\nReturning to the Spartans, they would strictly abstain from military expeditions during the Carneia, a festival honoring Apollo. Herodotus 9.7: “At present the Carneia was in their way, but once they had completed the festival, they intended to leave a garrison at Sparta and march out in full force with all speed.”\n\nHerodotus 5.63 also records that the Spartans drove out the descendants of the tyrant Pisistratus “despite the fact that the Pisistratidae were their close friends, for the god's will weighed with them more than the will of man,” in response to the Delphic oracle.\n\nXenophon’s long paean to the virtues of Spartan king Agesilaus II is also quite telling about the pious image the Spartans wanted to present:\n\nAgesilaus reverenced holy places even when they belonged to an enemy, thinking that he ought to make allies of the gods no less in hostile than in friendly countries.\n\nTo suppliants of the gods, even if his foes, he did no violence, believing it unreasonable to call robbers of temples sacrilegious and yet to consider those who dragged suppliants from altars pious men.\n\nIn the hour of success he was not puffed up with pride, but gave thanks to the gods. He offered more sacrifices when confident than prayers when in doubt.\n\nHe would not allow a statue of himself to be set up, though many wanted to give him one, but on memorials of his mind he laboured unceasingly, thinking the one to be the sculptor's work, the other his own, the one appropriate to the rich, the other to the good.\n\nIn the use of money he was not only just but generous, thinking that a just man may be content to leave other men's money alone, but the generous man is required also to spend his own in the service of others.\n\nThe poetry of Tyrtaeus describes a very clear commitment to self-sacrifice for the fatherland and the genos. Fragment 12 describes martial valor as a “common benefit for the polis and all the people,” and Fragment 10 opens “dying is a beautiful thing in the frontlines, if one has fallen as an agathos man, fighting for the fatherland.” This is very much a nomic orientation to race and state, not simply to one’s personal excellence outside of convention.\n\nThis explains the exiled Spartan king Demaratus’ famous reply in Herodotus 7.104 that “[the Spartans] are free, yet not wholly free: law is their master [δεσπότης νόμος], whom they fear much more than your men fear you.” They lived under despotes nomos sanctioned by the divine authority of Lycurgus, whose laws were spoken to him by Apollo at an oracle, and in turn authorized by Zeus.\n\nConnected to this is Spartan king Archidamus II’s eulogy to his people’s virtues in Thucydides 1.84: “We are both warlike and wise, and it is our sense of order that makes us so. We are warlike, because self-control contains honor as a chief constituent, and honor bravery. And we are wise, because we are educated with too little learning to despise the laws, and with too severe a self-control to disobey them, and are brought up not to be too knowing in useless matters.”\n\nIt should be noted that these portrayals are colored by the Athenians’ own view of the superiority of their system. The emphasis on Spartan rigidity by Archidamus acts as a foil to the much more famous oration by Pericles that follows. Even so, it demonstrates two things: a) that Athenian democrats saw themselves as a nomos much freer and “closer to nature” the nomos despotes of the Asiatic barbarian and the Spartan alike, and b) that the Spartan regime which produced such healthy specimens was doubtlessly a nomos held by ancestral convention.\n\nDr. Alamariu struggles here in large part because of his highly euhemerized and naturalistic approach to religion. He doesn’t seem to take the omnipresence of omens, oracles, sacrifices, libations, cults and divine supplications in the Greek thought-world at all seriously, or believe that a virile warrior aristocracy, supposedly being savage men of the wilderness, could have possibly revered such “nomic” things. But they did, and this poses major conceptual problems for his antinomian view of phusis.\n\n2d. Bellum et otium?\n\nI would like to make some reservations over Dr. Alamariu’s assertions about the uncompromising and total disdain for farmwork, tilling and labor that he characterizes as a universal trait for all aristocracies across time, as in the passages below:\n\nAll later aristocracies, indeed, even if they did not go to the extreme of valuing pillage and piracy, maintained an antagonistic attitude to the peasant, the serf, the tiller of the soil and the preservation of mere life. The famous motto of the Roman aristocracy was “Bellum et Otium”; in marked distinction, of course, to the later Christian “Ora et Labora.”\n\nFor this reason Nietzsche begins his early essay on the Greek state by pointing out that the Greeks would have rejected as vile lies and cant our modern ideas of the dignity of human life and the dignity of labor. Labor, as the mere maintenance or preservation of mere life, has no value in and of itself, because mere life has no value.\n\nThe disdain for manual labor, and in particular for farmwork, is also universal, as we are about to see. The matter of contempt for farming and manual labor is crucial.\n\nThis is something of a cliche about aristocracy in general, but it’s highly oversimplified, even for the Archaic Greek period. Hesiod’s poetry fundamentally revolves around the bucolic life of the honest laborer, contemporaneous with the heroism of Homer. The two poles therefore coexisted from the start.\n\nWe read, for example, in Plutarch’s Life of Solon that:\n\nFor he was admittedly a lover of wisdom, since even when he was well on in years he would say that he \"grew old ever learning many things\"; and he was not an admirer of wealth, but actually says that two men are alike wealthy of whom one\n\n\"much silver hath,\n\nAnd gold, and wide domains of wheat-bearing soil,\n\nHorses and mules; while to the other only enough belongs\n\nTo give him comfort of food, and clothes, and shoes,\n\nEnjoyment of child and blooming wife, when these too come,\n\nAnd only years commensurate therewith are his.\"\n\nHowever, in another place he says:\n\n\"Wealth I desire to have; but wrongfully to get it, I do not wish. Justice, even if slow, is sure.\"\n\nAnd there is no reason why a good statesman should either set his heart too much on the acquisition of superfluous wealth, or despise unduly the use of what is necessary and convenient. In those earlier times, to use the words of Hesiod,​ \"work was no disgrace,\" nor did a trade bring with it social inferiority, and the calling of a merchant was actually held in honour, since it gave him familiarity with foreign parts, friendships with foreign kings, and a large experience in affairs. Some merchants were actually founders of great cities, as Protis, who was beloved by the Gauls along the Rhone, was of Marseilles. Thales is said to have engaged in trade, as well as Hippocrates the mathematician; and Plato defrayed the expenses of his sojourn in Egypt by the sale of oil.\n\nLest it be objected that this is only a nostalgic paean to the Golden Age, we have even stronger testimony in Xenophon’s Memorabilia:\n\n“What, Aristippus,” exclaimed Socrates, “don't you think that there is just this difference between these voluntary and involuntary sufferings, that if you bear hunger or thirst willingly, you can eat, drink, or what not, when you choose, whereas compulsory suffering is not to be ended at will? Besides, he who endures willingly enjoys his work because he is comforted by hope; hunters, for instance, toil gladly in hope of game. Rewards like these are indeed of little worth after all the toil; but what of those who toil to win good friends, or to subdue enemies, or to make themselves capable in body and soul of managing their own homes well, of helping their friends and serving their country? Surely these toil gladly for such prizes and live a joyous life, well content with themselves, praised and envied by everyone else? Moreover, indolence and present enjoyment can never bring the body into good condition, as trainers say, neither do they put into the soul knowledge of any value, but strenuous effort leads up to good and noble deeds, as good men say. And so says Hesiod somewhere:\n\n“‘Wickedness can be had in abundance easily: smooth is the road and very nigh she dwells. But in front of virtue the gods immortal have put sweat: long and steep is the path to her and rough at first; but when you reach the top, then at length the road is easy, hard though it was.’\n\n” (Hes. WD 285)\n\n“And we have the testimony of Epicharmus too in the line:\n\n“‘The gods demand of us toil as the price of all good things.’\n\n” (Epicharmus)\n\nAgain, one might object that this is simply an aristocratic redefinition of “labor.” I do not deny this, but it is still a problem for Alamariu, whose conception of aristocracy is fundamentally tethered to the idea of the comitatus, the loose band of raiders who scorn any kind of wealth, property and stable existence in favor of continually replenishing themselves through plunder. This is hardly capable of describing an aristocracy that engages in cultured leisure, which presupposes landed wealth and inheritance. Even the very idea of “patria” (fatherland) presupposes a level of development far beyond the comitatus. Alamariu’s aristocrats, of course, much like the proletariat, have no fatherland. Suffice it to say the later European aristocracy and landed gentry would have obligatorily possessed a copy of Virgil’s Georgics in their bookshelves, and the needs of country estate management alongside an oikonomic worldview where the house-father was central, led to a burgeoning genre of Hausväterliteratur in the early modern period.\n\n2e. The erromenesteroi in Gorgias and the turannos eros\n\nDr. Alamariu’s exegesis of Gorgias in Chapter 3 is where he turns from analyzing the aristocratic concept of nature to suggesting an esoteric interpretation of Platonism as a doctrine based on the reconstitution (or “rewilding”) of said nature through paideia — cultivation, breeding by a lawgiver.\n\nBefore we discuss the shortcomings of Alamariu’s reading, we need to address the philological question as to the meaning of erromenesteros (ἐρρωμενέστερος). As noted in the summary, this is a central concept in Dr. Alamariu’s reading not just of Gorgias but of ancient Greek eugenics as a whole, with over two dozen references in the book.\n\nHere are some relevant passages by Alamariu:\n\nIn conclusion, to repeat, the escape of the erromenesteroi, the healthy human specimens, from the enslaving grasp of convention is at once the emotional focus for Callicles’ passion, as well as the substantial and dramatic crux of both his speeches.\n\nIn this context it is most significant that the word used by Callicles (and by Socrates) all along in their discussion for the “better-turned-out” is erromenesteros, a word with biological connotations. This word comes from rhonnumi, to have strength, might, to be in good health; this word, the same that Plato uses in the Republic (sungeneia erromene, emphasizing inborn might and health at Rep. 491c; at 491d he uses the word in relation to botanical [phuton] or animal [zoon] growth) to describe the potential philosopher, is often otherwise used to indicate vigor, vigorous growth, vehemence. The preservation of the “superior breed” or biological specimen is the preservation of nature in the world and therefore the guarantee of the emergence of truth about the world.\n\nIt is the superior human specimens or the erromenesteroi who have the unique access to the distinction between nature and convention, and they only have this access in the best circumstances; they are ever in danger of being corrupted, enslaved, smothered by nomos. It is the issue of the erromenesteros that is central in the Gorgias. The word erromenesteros represents the raw natural element of superiority, as opposed to words such as phronimos, kreitto, beltion, and so on, which all indicate a particular direction in which the native superiority has been trained.\n\n[Socrates and Callicles] seem to agree on the fact that the erromenesteros and his salvation and preservation is what matters; that without this, there is neither philosophy, nor tyranny, nor the “original” and raw, wild biological matter from which each uniquely grows.\n\nGreek abounds in different words to compare ways in which one man excels over another; the above three may be provisionally translated as “better, more prudent; better, stronger; better, more noble” etc.; but erromenesteros, the word that both Callicles uses in the Gorgias, and Socrates uses in the Republic, refers to the “raw material” for all this: to the end-product of an aristocratic breeding project that stands opposed to the native egalitarian conventions of the commons.\n\nAnd that the end-product of this breeding, nature itself, is the erromenesteros: the word that Socrates uses uniquely for both the “raw material” of the philosopher and the tyrant.\n\nTo unpack. According to Dr. Alamariu:\n\nErromenesteros, which is the comparative of erromenos, the passive participle of rhonnumi, is a term with uniquely eugenic connotations compared to all other Greek appellations for inborn superiority.\n\nThe erromenesteroi are the “healthy human specimens” and the “better-turned-out.”\n\nErromenesteros is the raw matter used by the selective breeder, corresponding to the innate characteristics, to be distinguished from acquired characteristics.\n\nErromenesteros is also the end product of said breeding, i.e. the healthy specimen.\n\nEvidently, it is meant to be of immense significance.\n\nDr. Alamariu focuses on two primary cases: Gorgias 483c and Republic 491d.\n\nGorgias 483c:\n\nπρὸς αὑτοὺς οὖν καὶ τὸ αὑτοῖς συμφέρον τούς τε νόμους τίθενται καὶ τοὺς ἐπαίνους ἐπαινοῦσι καὶ τοὺς ψόγους ψέγουσιν, ἐκφοβοῦντες τοὺς ἐρρωμενεστέρους τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ δυνατοὺς ὄντας πλέον ἔχειν, ἵνα μὴ αὐτῶν πλέον ἔχωσιν, λέγουσιν ὡς αἰσχρὸν καὶ ἄδικον τὸ πλεονεκτεῖν, καὶ τοῦτο ἔστι τὸ ἀδικεῖν, τὸ πλέον τῶν ἄλλων ζητεῖν ἔχειν· ἀγαπῶσι γάρ, οἶμαι, αὐτοὶ ἂν τὸ ἴσον ἔχωσι φαυλότεροι ὄντες\n\n[So it is with a view to themselves and their own interest that they make their laws and distribute their praises and censures; and to terrorize the stronger sort of folk who are able to get an advantage, and to prevent them from getting one over them, they tell them that such aggrandizement is foul and unjust, and that wrongdoing is just this endeavour to get the advantage of one’s neighbours: for I expect they are well content to see themselves on an equality, when they are so inferior.]\n\nRepublic 491d:\n\nπαντός, ἦν δ᾽ ἐγώ, σπέρματος πέρι ἢ φυτοῦ, εἴτε ἐγγείων εἴτε τῶν ζῴων, ἴσμεν ὅτι τὸ μὴ τυχὸν τροφῆς ἧς προσήκει ἑκάστῳ μηδ᾽ ὥρας μηδὲ τόπου, ὅσῳ ἂν ἐρρωμενέστερον ᾖ, τοσούτῳ πλειόνων ἐνδεῖ τῶν πρεπόντων: ἀγαθῷ γάρ που κακὸν ἐναντιώτερον ἢ τῷ μὴ ἀγαθῷ.\n\n[“On the subject of every seed or growing thing,” I said, “whether growing in the ground or living creatures, we know that any which does not get its proper food, or climate or environment, the stronger it grows, the more it lacks these essentials. Evil is more opposed to good to my mind than it is to what is not-good.”]\n\nIts use in the context of organic growth in Republic 491d is the central piece of evidence for Alamariu’s interpretation.\n\nWe will apply the same distributional-semantic method as with agroikos to see if this consistently holds in other contexts.\n\nRemember that our primary concern is whether this is a characteristically eugenic concept, i.e. whether it’s cognate to concepts like gennaios and eugeneia, and whether it is foremost about breeding.\n\nDionysius of Halicarnassus in the Ars Rhetorica records a passage from an exhortation to athletes:\n\nλόγος γὰρ εἰς πάντα ἐπιτήδειος καὶ πρὸς πᾶν ἐπιρρώννυσιν· οὕτως καὶ ἐπὶ πολέμου καὶ ἐπὶ παρατάξεως δέονται στρατιῶται τοῦ παρὰ τῶν στρατηγῶν λόγου καὶ τῆς προτροπῆς, καὶ αὐτοὶ αὑτῶν ἐρρωμενέστεροι ἐγένοντο. μάλιστα δὲ οἱ ἀθληταὶ δέοιντο ἂν τῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ λόγου προτροπῆς καὶ ἐπικελεύσεως, ὄντες μὲν καὶ αὐτοὶ Ἑρμοῦ τε καὶ Ἡρακλέους μαθηταί τε καὶ ζηλωταί (ὧν ὁ μὲν εὑρετὴς τοῦ λόγου ἢ αὐτὸ χρῆμα λόγος· ὁ δὲ σὺν τῇ Ἀθηνᾷ πάντα κατώρθωσεν τὰ ἐπιταχθέντα· ἡ δὲ τί ἂν ἄλλο εἴη ἢ νοῦς τε καὶ λόγος;), καὶ ὁσημέραι δὲ ἐπὶ ταῖς γυμνασίαις ἑκάστοτε τοιούτους τοὺς ἐπικελευομένους ἔχοντες αὑτοῖς\n\nFor words are suitable for all purposes and add strength to any endeavor. Thus, soldiers in battle formation need a speech of exhortation from their generals, through which they surpass themselves in strength and vigor. Athletes in particular require exhortation and encouragement through speech. They are, after all, themselves students and followers of Hermes and Heracles, and while the former is the inventor (or the very embodiment) of speech, the latter accomplished everything he was ordered to do with the help of Athena—and what is she if not intellect and speech? So, day in and day out, athletes have people like these encouraging them every time they are training.\n\nHere the strength and vigor is explicily said to arise from “the word,” and the “erromenesteros” is the power received by said exhortation. Actually there are several similar usages, all in the context of military campaigns.\n\nIn Plutarch’s Alexander we find it used in consequence not just of a rousing battle speech, but of an omen by a seer after performing a sacrifice:\n\n…Ἀρίστανδρος ὁ μάντις ἐσφαγιάζετο καὶ τὰ σημεῖα κατιδὼν θρασύτερον διωρίσατο πρὸς τοὺς παρόντας ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ μηνὶ πάντως ἁλώσεσθαι τὴν πόλιν. γενομένου δὲ χλευασμοῦ καὶ γέλωτος ἦν γὰρ ἡ τελευταία τοῦ μηνὸς ἡμέρα, διηπορημένον αὐτόν ἰδὼν ὁ βασιλεύς καὶ συμφιλοτιμούμενος ἀεὶ τοῖς μαντεύμασιν ἐκέλευε μηκέτι τριακάδα τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην, ἀλλὰ τρίτην φθίνοντος ἀριθμεῖν: καὶ τῇ σάλπιγγι σημήνας ἀπεπειρᾶτο τῶν τειχῶν ἐρρωμενέστερον ἤπερ ἐξ ἀρχῆς διενοήθη.\n\n…Aristander the seer made a sacrifice, and after taking the omens, declared very confidently to the bystanders that the city would certainly be captured during that month. His words produced laughter and jesting, since it was then the last day of the month, and the king, seeing that he was perplexed, and being always eager to support his prophecies, gave orders to reckon that day, not as the thirtieth of the month, but as the twenty-eighth; and then, after the trumpet had sounded the signal, he attacked the walls with greater vigour than he had at first intended.\n\nIt is instructive that this greater vigor should have come as a result of Alexander’s religious piety — trusting the omen where his own troops initially mocked it.\n\nIn Xenophon’s Hellenica we read of the fall of the Spartan commander Mnasippus during the Siege of Corcyra:\n\nτέλος δὲ οἱ πολέμιοι ἁθρόοι γενόμενοι πάντες ἐπετίθεντο τοῖς περὶ τὸν Μνάσιππον, ἤδη μάλα ὀλίγοις οὖσι. καὶ οἱ πολῖται ὁρῶντες τὸ γιγνόμενον ἐπεξῇσαν. ἐπεὶ δʼ ἐκεῖνον ἀπέκτειναν, ἐδίωκον ἤδη ἅπαντες. ἐκινδύνευσαν δʼ ἂν καὶ τὸ στρατόπεδον ἑλεῖν σὺν τῷ χαρακώματι, εἰ μὴ οἱ διώκοντες τὸν ἀγοραῖόν τε ὄχλον ἰδόντες καὶ τὸν τῶν θεραπόντων καὶ τὸν τῶν ἀνδραπόδων, οἰηθέντες ὄφελός τι αὐτῶν εἶναι, ἀπεστρέφοντο. καὶ τότε μὲν τροπαῖόν τε ἵστασαν οἱ Κερκυραῖοι τούς τε νεκροὺς ὑποσπόνδους ἀπεδίδοσαν. ἐκ δὲ τούτου οἱ μὲν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐρρωμενέστεροι ἐγεγένηντο, οἱ δʼ ἔξω ἐν πάσῃ δὴ ἀθυμίᾳ ἦσαν.\n\nFinally, all of the enemy massed themselves together and charged upon Mnasippus and his troops, which were by this time very few. And the citizens, seeing what was going on, came out to join in the attack. Then after they had killed Mnasippus, all straightway joined in the pursuit. And they probably would have captured the very camp, along with its stockade, had not the pursuers turned back upon seeing the crowd of camp-followers, of attendants, and of slaves, imagining that there was some fighting ability in them. At this time, accordingly, the Corcyraeans set up a trophy and gave back the bodies of the dead under a truce. And after this the people in the city were stouter of heart, while those outside were in the utmost despondency.\n\nThe “stoutness of heart” comes from the victory, but also from the magnanimous gesture during the short truce, a direct result of the upper hand gained by the Corcyraeans.\n\nProbably the most famous example, again from Xenophon, is in Anabasis 3.1.42: “For you understand, I am sure, that it is neither numbers nor strength which wins victories in war; but whichever of the two sides it be whose troops, by the blessing of the gods, advance to the attack with stouter hearts, against those troops their adversaries generally refuse to stand.”\n\nBut let us end with an example from the Platonic corpus: the Timaeus.\n\nTimaeus, is of course, the most “spiritual” of all the Platonic dialogues, and in Tim. 89e we find the “erromenestaton” in direct connection with the tripartite soul:\n\nὅτι τρία τριχῇ ψυχῆς ἐν ἡμῖν εἴδη κατῴκισται, τυγχάνει δὲ ἕκαστον κινήσεις ἔχον, οὕτω κατὰ ταὐτὰ καὶ νῦν ὡς διὰ βραχυτάτων ῥητέον ὅτι τὸ μὲν αὐτῶν ἐν ἀργίᾳ διάγον καὶ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ κινήσεων ἡσυχίαν ἄγον ἀσθενέστατον ἀνάγκη γίγνεσθαι, τὸ δ᾽ ἐν γυμνασίοις ἐρρωμενέστατον\n\nthere are housed within us in three regions three kinds of soul, and that each of these has its own motions; so now likewise we must repeat, as briefly as possible, that the kind which remains in idleness and stays with its own motions; in repose necessarily becomes weakest, whereas the kind which exercises itself becomes strongest\n\nAnd in 90b Plato adds: “Whoso, then, indulges in lusts or in contentions and devotes himself overmuch thereto must of necessity be filled with opinions that are wholly mortal, and altogether, so far as it is possible to become mortal, fall not short of this in even a small degree, inasmuch as he has made great his mortal part.”\n\nOne could, of course, decide to interpret this as some allegory for breeding, but the subject matter is clearly cosmological and deals with the doctrine of the world-soul. We do not have the unambiguously organic context as in Republic 491d. And the Timaeus was by far the most influential dialogue all throughout the Middle Ages, the bedrock of all Neoplatonists — i.e. it is that which, in Dr. Alamariu’s view, is the most “exoteric” of all in the sense of being outwardly apolitical.\n\nI therefore do not understand the inordinate attention that Dr. Alamariu chose to give this word, making it the centerpiece of his Gorgias exegesis. Even if we grant biological connotations on an etymological level (which there are, hardly unusual for Greek), the pragmatic contextual usages are hardly as clear-cut across texts as in Alamariu’s favorite example of Republic 491d. Neither can this be blamed purely on semantic drift from later Hellenistic authors. More to the point: the elaborate connection of the word erromenesteros to his reading of phusis and the claim that it’s a key concept for the Greek view of breeding, the “raw material” for healthy human specimens, is completely tendentious. Dr. Alamariu seems to have left his own daimonion spur him into a Bacchic frenzy of overinterpretation. We will discuss Greek concepts of eugenics in the subsequent section 2f.\n\nBut first let us finish the discussion of Gorgias.\n\nIn order for Dr. Alamariu to get his much desired symmetry between philosopher and tyrant, he has to omit three crucial problems:\n\nthe tyrant as a victim of flattery (kolakeia), mentioned in the Gorgias and also a common trope in the wider Greek world;\n\nthe distinction between the philosopher and the tyrant in Book 9 of Republic;\n\nthe fact that mere paranomia (upending of convention) is not on its own any manifestation of phusis.\n\nIn Gorgias 521a Socrates asks:\n\nSOCRATES: Then to which service of the State do you invite me? determine for me. Am I to be the physician of the State who will strive and struggle to make the Athenians as good as possible; or am I to be the servant and flatterer of the State? Speak out, my good friend, freely and fairly as you did at first and ought to do again, and tell me your entire mind.\n\nThe kolax (flatterer) was a stock character depicted as a sycophantic toady to wealthy patrons, marked by “low origins, eagerness for a meal, dependence upon wealthy patrons, and a nonchalant indifference towards exclusionary social norms.”\n\nThe hallmarks of a kolax, according to the Rhetoric, are: “Praising people to their faces is characteristic of kolakeia, and over-praising someone’s good qualities but glossing over their failings, and over-sympathizing in person with someone in distress, and other things of this sort, these are all marks of kolakeia.”\n\nIn contrast, the essential opposite of the kolax, is best given by the well-known story of Solon at the court of Croesus of Lydia. Croesus keeps asking Solon who is the happiest man that he has seen in his wide travels, expecting Solon to give him a flattering answer that it is Croesus. Instead Solon demonstrates a courageous parrhesia (integrity of speech) in refusing to indulge the vanity of a mighty potentate, much to Croesus’ displeasure.\n\nSolon’s parrhesia reflects the triumph of the rational part of the soul over the epithumotic appetites of Croesus. Tyranny is an imbalance in the three components of the soul (reason, spirit/thumos, appetites) in which the spirit and appetites involuntarily rule over against the directive power of reason. In the vast majority of cases, men beset by tyrannical passions will never rise to any position of standing at all. They will simply retreat to private indulgences or petty criminality, lacking the control of reason that can direct the appetites and passions into productive endeavors. In the same way, the political tyrant will be surrounded by flatters feeding him idle pleasantries (representing the lower orders of the soul), but will have no true friends to admonish him when he faces genuine threats (representing the higher orders of the soul). Hence tyranny is a condition of fear or self-preservation in which words lose their connection to things and become mere tools of self-delusion.\n\nIn Book 9 of Republic we have Socrates:\n\nHe first takes their property, and when that falls, and pleasures are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a house, or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds to clear a temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child, and which gave judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated, and are now the bodyguard of love and share his empire. These in his democratic days, when he was still subject to the laws and to his father, were only let loose in the dreams of sleep. But now that he is under the dominion of love, he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only; he will commit the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food, or be guilty of any other horrid act. Love is his tyrant, and lives lordly in him and lawlessly, and being himself a king, leads him on, as a tyrant leads a State, to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates, whether those whom evil communications have brought in from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself. Have we not here a picture of his way of life?\n\nThe tyrant is paranomic, but that is a far cry from having self-mastery over his nature. Here an analogy from Book 7 is useful: “… the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people like or not-the possibility of this union of authority with the steerer's art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling.” The philosopher’s knowledge of causal principles are precisely those things of techne (craft) that elevate the accidental violation of convention into an essential knowledge of nature. Besides, nomos and phusis are not in truth unbridgeable opposites, since every nomic order needs to some extent reflect the natural proclivities and tendencies of the men it subordinates.\n\nIt seems that Dr. Alamariu is a victim of his own stark dichotomy between nature and convention, that he has to equate nature with emancipation from convention. This could only work if we blithely assume that conventions have no coterminous overlap with nature, if we beg the question (as Alamariu does) that ius naturale is a contradiction in terms since “nature” can only be manifested through independence from and a contempt for the mores of a regime. In fact, if we take this reasoning to its conclusion, it would follow that the politeia, the idea of nomos actualized by the force of the wise lawgiver, is impossible. The wild and erotic men of passion would have to revolt against the politeia as much as any other convention, even before the “end-product of breeding” is completed. Or are we to declare that the end product has been finished as soon as there are paranomic men in the politeia? No, because clearly not all paranomia are equally base or noble — but then we fall right back to the Socratic dictum that the passionate tyrannical man is not acting according to his “true” desires, which is the very sort of conceit (“Platonism for the people”) that both Nietzsche and Alamariu would like to get out of. Actually for Dr. Alamariu the problem is even worse: on numerous occasions he equates nature with outright antinomia. The true man of nature, the superior man, the healthy man, is the one who lives in the agrios among the beasts. How could any politeia be up to the manic and untamed fury in the wilderness? The answer that the politeia offers a “eugenic training regimen” is unsatisfactory, since Dr. Alamariu completely begs the question by assuming eugenic breeding necessarily serves aristocratic ends, when it could just as easily have communitarian and “gyno-gerontocratic” motivations. In fact, let me cite the words of Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854-1936), the founder of anthroposociology and a famous advocate of Nordicist eugenics, in 1927:\n\nThe transition to the state of society only commenced when man found himself reaching out from his individual interest to collective ends. It developed when it became possible to constrain the mass to ordered life. But it is not yet complete, and society will only be truly created in that day when each individual will live only for the whole, a degree which has been reached by the more ancient, if less well endowed biological societies as those of the ants, the termites and the bees. The crystalization of instincts will never doubtless be as complete amongst men, and that is probably to be desired, as a much higher grade of perfection would be thereby excluded, but each step made in this direction separates man more widely from the ancestral primates who lived each for himself.\n\nMan will not have escaped wholly from the animal level till that moment when the selfish instinct will have been destroyed by a long course of selectionist population policy.\n\nSo we see here that the explicit intention of one of the greatest modern eugenic thinkers was to shape men into a eusocial insect colony. Clearly this is completely contrary to Dr. Alamariu’s worldview, but he seems to lack awareness of the problem due to his simple equivocation of teknopoiia and noble breeding. The vast majority of aristocracies did not preserve their lineage through “eugenic population policies” writ large, but through private laws self-enforced by the rules of honor and dignity governing the morality of their own caste. Endogamy does not require a regimen.\n\n2f. Greek eugeneia\n\nWe saw in the previous section that the erromenesteroi of Callicles, which Dr. Alamariu elevated to the key concept of Greek aristocratic breeding, is in all likelihood a spurious connection and dead end as to actually reconstructing what the Greeks meant by good (noble) birth. Where should we look, then? The most obvious place, actually: eugeneia (εὐγένεια).\n\nBut first, I want to comment on Alamariu’s discussion of Pindar’s sixth Nemean Ode. Alamariu writes:\n\nThat is, there is the question of regression to the mean on one hand, or of certain hereditary qualities “skipping a generation” on the other—in keeping with well-known Mendelian rules for trait inheritance. Children of very tall people, for example, will tend to regress to the mean of the population in question—Socrates’ sons were nonentities. This mechanism explains how it may be that inborn excellence will exhibit itself in one generation of an aristocracy but not in another.\n\nThe [in-text] bolded verse that Alamariu is commenting on reads “we do not know, by day or by night, towards what goal fortune has written that we should run. Even now Alcimidas gives a great sign to be seen that his inborn is like the fruitful fields, which, in alternation, at one time give men yearly sustenance from the plains, and at another time gather strength from repose.”\n\nDr. Alamariu looks at this basic observation about how fortune is volatile and bad seeds can sprout from a good stock, and infers a sophisticated knowledge of Mendelian inheritance and regression to the mean possessed by the Homeric aristocracy. This is a massive overreading if I ever saw one: as if the ancients had a clear concept of unit-inheritance as opposed to pangenesis, or of a distinction between somatic and gametic cells. Dr. Alamariu is being overenthusiastic in drawing modern parallels over sticking to the sources.\n\nThe same idea as Pindar’s is expressed in more sophisticated form in Aristotle’s Rhetoric, 2.15.3:\n\nThe idea of noble birth refers to excellence of race, that of noble character to not degenerating from the family type, a quality not as a rule found in those of noble birth, most of whom are good for nothing. For in the generations of men there is a kind of crop as in the fruits of the field; sometimes, if the race is good, for a certain period men out of the common are born in it, and then it deteriorates. Highly gifted families often degenerate into maniacs, as, for example, the descendants of Alcibiades and the elder Dionysius; those that are stable into fools and dullards, like the descendants of Cimon, Pericles, and Socrates.\n\nAs far as I know, Aristotle was the first to draw the formal distinction between “descending from a noble breed” and “being true to the type of a noble breed,” which is what Pindar was hinting at in poetic form, and what any farmer knows at least primitively. The former is εὐγενὲς and the latter is γενναῖον. Thus, being eugenes (of good birth) may not necessarily coincide with being gennaios (species-appropriate, well-turned-out). Aristotle outright says that most of the time they do not coincide. This alone makes him far more pessimistic than the 20th century eugenic utopian promising milk and honey with a few simple techniques like marriage certificates and sterilization laws.\n\nDemosthenes’ Against Aristogeiton even makes this same point to argue for the constancy and regularity of nomos as against the unreliability of phusis: “The whole life of men, Athenians, whether they dwell in a large state or a small one, is governed by nature and by the laws. Of these, nature is something irregular and incalculable, and peculiar to each individual; but the laws are something universal, definite, and the same for all. Now nature, if it be evil, often chooses wrong, and that is why you will find men of an evil nature committing errors.”\n\nEugeneia is again defined in Rhetoric 1360b:\n\nNoble birth (εὐγένεια), in the case of a nation or State, means that its members or inhabitants are sprung from the soil (αὐτόχθονας), or of long standing; that its first members were famous as leaders, and that many of their descendants have been famous for qualities that are highly esteemed. In the case of private individuals, noble birth is derived from either the father's or the mother's side, and on both sides there must be legitimacy; and, as in the case of a State, it means that its founders were distinguished for virtue, or wealth, or any other of the things that men honor, and that a number of famous persons, both men and women, young and old, belong to the family.\n\nObserve the curious qualifier that the eugeneia are αὐτόχθονας (autochthonous), being sprung from the soil. In fact, the deep connection between noble birth and autochthony was a well-established trope in the Attic Greek consciousness. The Athenians prided themselves on having ripened from the Attic soil, the only people in the world not to have migrated from some other place, but literally born out of their land.\n\nThere are many other examples of this. Notably we have Socrates’ extended oration in Plato’s Menexenus:\n\nFirstly, then, let us eulogize their nobility of birth, and secondly their nurture and training: thereafter we shall exhibit the character of their exploits, how nobly and worthily they wrought them. Now as regards nobility of birth, their first claim thereto is this—that the forefathers of these men were not of immigrant stock, nor were these their sons declared by their origin to be strangers in the land sprung from immigrants, but natives sprung from the soil living and dwelling in their own true fatherland; and nurtured also by no stepmother, like other folk, but by that mother-country wherein they dwelt, which bare them and reared them and now at their death receives them again to rest in their own abodes. Most meet it is that first we should celebrate that Mother herself; for by so doing we shall also celebrate therewith the noble birth of these heroes.\n\nThis autochthonous birth is in fact an ἰσογονία (isogonia, equality of birth) which directly produces the more well-known ἰσονομία (isonomia, equality of laws):\n\nOn the contrary, the one principle of selection is this: the man that is deemed to be wise or good rules and governs. And the cause of this our polity lies in our equality of birth. For whereas all other States are composed of a heterogeneous collection of all sorts of people, so that their polities also are heterogeneous, tyrannies as well as oligarchies, some of them regarding one another as slaves, others as masters; we and our people, on the contrary, being all born of one mother, claim to be neither the slaves of one another nor the masters; rather does our natural birth-equality drive us to seek lawfully legal equality, and to yield to one another in no respect save in reputation for virtue and understanding.\n\nWhat this shows is that the democratic regime’s foundational myth was no less eugenic than those of many aristocratic ones.\n\nThe same theme is the subject of Demosthenes’ Funeral Oration:\n\nThe nobility of birth of these men [ἡ γὰρ εὐγένεια τῶνδε τῶν ἀνδρῶν] has been acknowledged from time immemorial by all mankind. For it is possible for them and for each one of their remote ancestors man by man to trace back their being, not only to a physical father, but also to this land of theirs as a whole, a common possession, of which they are acknowledged to be the indigenous children. For alone of all mankind they settled the very land from which they were born and handed it down to their descendants, so that justly one may assume that those who came as migrants into their cities and are denominated citizens of the same are comparable to adopted children; but these men are citizens of their native land by right of legitimate birth.\n\nAs to what might be called “eugenics” as a practical art, the best we have is, of course, Book VII of Aristotle’s Politics. It’s pretty clear that Aristotle, along with virtually all pre-modern theoreticians of heredity, did not have the same modern genetic-environmental distinction we did. This is because, in the Aristotelian view, the bodily constitution depended on the temperature and humidity of the blood, which could be modified by various climactic, dietary and other factors in such a way that they could be passed down to offspring. This is why Aristotle’s advice includes specific guidelines such that conception should ideally occur in the winter, what mental activity is expected out of the mother (for well into the 19th century it was widely believed that maternal imagination could influence the likeness of the child — there has even been some research on this phenomenon in the modern day), up to childrearing advice that “violent crying contributes to growth, for it serves in a way as exercise for the body, since holding the breath is the strength giving factor in hard labor, and this takes place also with children when they stretch themselves in crying.” Much of this advice lived on in medicine even as it may have lost any specifically political valence.\n\nIn any case, we see that the concept of eugeneia was closely tied to nomoi.\n\n2g. Plato’s Academy as an institute for seizing power?\n\nIn line with the equation of philosophy and tyranny, and hence with the natural rule of the well-born based on their pure self-sufficient racial stock as emancipated from any ancestral convention (the “regime-independent men”), it is Alamariu’s basic contention that Platonism was an esoteric doctrine for installing a polity founded on the right of might, and that the cosmological, dialectical, metaphysical and other doctrines were on the whole meant as inoffensive exotericism whose deeper meaning (breeding the higher type) would only be grasped by the worthy few. What the city-as-soul analogy really means, in this view, is that the well-born souls must be the city — the raw material for a eugenic program.\n\nThe question is: what evidence do we have that the Platonic Academy had esoteric teachings dealing with the seizure of political power and the cultivation of new “lords of the earth”? Alamariu basically points to two things: Alcibiades, Critias and the Cyrenaics being pupils of Socrates, and the unflattering stories told about Plato and the pupils of his academy in Athenaeus’ Deipnosophistae in addition to gossip recorded by Diogenes Laertius.\n\nLet me start with the weakest link in Dr. Alamariu’s case. He cites the testimony of Epicurus, who called Plato a “Dionysokolax” — flatterer of Dionysios and by extension of tyrants, in obvious connection to the Syracusan adventure relayed in Plato’s Seventh Letter. But strangely enough, Dr. Alamariu does not quote the primary source. Instead, he quotes a paraphrasal by Nietzsche.\n\nThe full quote from Diogenes Laertius’ Lives of the Eminent Philosophers on Epicurus’ words is as follows:\n\nEpicurus used to call this Nausiphanes jelly-fish,​ an illiterate, a fraud, and a trollop; Plato's school he called \"the toadies of Dionysius,\" their master himself the \"golden\" Plato,​ and Aristotle a profligate, who after devouring his patrimony took to soldiering and selling drugs; Protagoras a pack-carrier and the scribe of Democritus and village schoolmaster; Heraclitus a muddler; ​Democritus Lerocritus (the nonsense-monger); and Antidorus Sannidorus (fawning gift-bearer); the Cynics foes of Greece; the Dialecticians despoilers; and Pyrrho an ignorant boor.\n\nWhat this clearly shows is that Epicurus was an acerbic wit who had creative insults for all of his philosophical rivals. Thus, it is hardly testimony about any esoteric political ambitions of the Academy or its scholarchs.\n\nDr. Alamariu has a better point in bringing up Athenaeus’ testimony of a certain Chaeron of Pellene, “who was not only a pupil of Plato, but of Xenocrates also.” Of him it is said that “having usurped the supreme power in his country, and having exercised it with great severity, not only banished the most virtuous men in the city, but also gave the property of the masters to their slaves, and gave their wives also to them, compelling them to receive them as their husbands; having got all these admirable ideas from that excellent Republic and those illegal Laws of Plato.”\n\nNow, there are two things to note here: a) when Alamariu quotes that paragraph, he bolds the part up to “exercised it with great severity,” yet curiously does not do so for the crucial point that he “gave the property of the masters to their slaves.” From this description, Chaeron does not come across as an aristocratic radical who breaks from convention to assert his superior nature. On the contrary, his tyranny takes the form of a Saturnalian revolt against nature where base and noble are inverted — slaves becoming masters; b) there is conflicting testimony from contemporary orators over whether Chaeron really was a pupil of Plato and Xenocrates, and more to the point he was directly installed as a tyrant by the Macedonian dynasty, with some orators blaming Alexander the Great and not Chaeron for the banishment of Pellene’s citizenry. On the whole, this episode is not persuasive for Alamariu’s argument.\n\nWhat of Athenaeus’ claim that the Academics “live in a scandalous and infamous manner”? This actually has a straightforward answer: the philosophers (many of them) did lead scandalous private li"
