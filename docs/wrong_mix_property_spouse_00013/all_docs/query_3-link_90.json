        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The unexpected death of 32-year-old Brittany Murphy, who gained fame in such movies as “8 Mile” and “Just Married,” appeared to be from natural causes but police are investigating, officials said.\n\nMurphy died about 10 a.m. Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to the hospital.\n\nShe was transported to the medical center after the Fire Department responded to a call at 8 a.m. at the home she shared with her husband, British screenwriter Simon Monjack, in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nAssistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Murphy apparently collapsed in the bathroom, and authorities were looking into her medical history.\n\nAn official cause of death may not be determined for some time, since toxicology tests will be required, but “it appears to be natural,” Winter said. He said an autopsy was planned for Monday or Tuesday.\n\nLos Angeles police have opened an investigation into Murphy’s death, Officer Norma Eisenman said. Detectives and coroner’s officials were at Murphy and Monjack’s home Sunday afternoon but did not talk to reporters. Paparazzi were camped outside the multistory home, located above the Sunset Strip.\n\nNeighbor Clare Staples said she saw firefighters working to resuscitate the actress Sunday morning. She said Murphy was on a stretcher.\n\nMurphy’s husband, wearing pajama bottoms and no shoes, appeared “dazed” as firefighters tried to save her, Staples said. “It’s just tragic,” she added.\n\nMurphy’s publicist, Nicole Perna, said in a statement: “In this time of sadness, the family thanks you for your love and support. It is their wish that you respect their privacy.”\n\nMessages left for Murphy’s manager and agent by The Associated Press were not immediately returned.\n\nMurphy’s father, Angelo Bertolotti, said he learned of her death from his son, the actress’s brother, and was stunned.\n\n“She was just an absolute doll since she was born,” Bertolotti said from his Florida home. “Her personality was always outward. Everybody loved her — people that made movies with her, people on a cruise — they all loved her. She was just a regular gal.”\n\nHe said he hadn’t heard much about the circumstances of Murphy’s death. Bertolotti divorced her mother when Murphy was young and hadn’t seen Murphy in the past few years.\n\nBorn Nov. 10, 1977, in Atlanta, Murphy grew up in New Jersey and later moved with her mother to Los Angeles to pursue acting.\n\nHer career started in the early 1990s with small roles in television series, commercials and movies. She is best known for parts in “Girl, Interrupted,” “Clueless” and “8 Mile.”\n\nHer on-screen work had lessened of late, but Murphy’s voice gave life to numerous animated characters, including Luanne Platter on more than 200 episodes of Fox’s “King of the Hill” and Gloria the penguin in the 2006 feature “Happy Feet.”\n\nShe is due to appear in Sylvester Stallone’s upcoming film, “The Expendables,” set for release next year.\n\nHer role in “8 Mile” led to more recognition, Murphy told AP in 2003. “That changed a lot,” she said. “That was the difference between people knowing my first and last name as opposed to not.”\n\nMurphy credited her mother, Sharon, with being a key to her success.\n\n“When I asked my mom to move to California, she sold everything and moved out here for me,” Murphy said. “I was really grateful to have grown up in an environment that was conducive to creating and didn’t stifle any of that. She always believed in me.”\n\nShe dated Ashton Kutcher, who costarred with Murphy in 2003’s romantic comedy “Just Married.”\n\nKutcher sent a message on Twitter Sunday morning about Murphy’s death: “2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine,” Kutcher wrote. “My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany’s family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon.”\n\nFuneral arrangements have not been announced.\n\nAP writers Christopher Weber in Los Angeles and Matt Sedensky in Miami contributed to this report."
