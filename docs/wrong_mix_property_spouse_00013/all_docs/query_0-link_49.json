        "text": "I checked out this video because I believe that Brittany Murphy and her husband were murdered. For one thing, they both had died from the exact same thing, but her husband died a couple of days later after she died, which was like the double murder of Whitney Houston and her daughter as well as the weird death — likely to be a murder of Carrie Fisher and her mother Debbie Reynolds.\n\nI remember both Brittany and her husband, Simon Monjack, were supporting a whistleblower, Julia Davis, who was exposing the Department of Homeland Security, and they were helping her expose the truth. They were likely silenced.\n\nMoreover, her father, Angelo Bertolotti, states that government agents secretly followed her around and tapped her phones to stop her from supporting Julia Davis. Her father feels that Brittany was intentionally poisoned. He wanted new toxicology tests to be performed on his dead daughter’s body to find the real cause.\n\n‘Ten (10) of the heavy metals evaluated were detected at levels higher than the WHO [The World Health Organization] high levels. Testing the hair strand sample identified as [being from the] “back of the head,” we have detected ten (10) heavy metals at levels above the WHO high levels recommendation. If we were to eliminate the possibility of a simultaneous accidental heavy metals exposure to the sample donor then the only logical explanation would be an exposure to these metals (toxins) administered by a third party perpetrator with likely criminal intent.’\n\nMoreover, Brittany and Simon were under constant surveillance via helicopters, wiretapping, ‘sneak-and-peek incursions into their residence’…other terror tactics. Brittany was also a witness for Julia Davis’ lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security. Julia Davis had claimed that America let in many terrorists over the Mexican border, due to botched security.\n\nJulia Davis had co-starred with Brittany Murphy in the movie, Girl Interrupted, and she states that Brittany wasn’t on drugs. Julia Davis was a stunt double for Angelina Jolie in that movie. Julia also worked as an Armed Customs and Border Protection Office for the Department of Homeland Security. Her work was featured by the National Whistleblowers Center. Julia confirms that Brittany was being followed and investigated because of supporting her lawsuit case. She adds, ‘Mr. Bertolotti never said she was poisoned because of it.’ He had commented on the surveillance and investigation.\n\nBertolotti’s phone was tapped after he started supporting Julia Davis. He didn’t identity anyone murdering his daughter. He just felt she was being terrorized by the Department of Homeland Security. After information came out about possible toxic mold found in Brittany and Simon’s house, LA County Coroner did extensive tests. Their results concluded with Brittany dying of natural causes. Julia Davis adds that the ‘LA Coroner specifically investigated the mold allegations and found them 100% false. Google it.’"
