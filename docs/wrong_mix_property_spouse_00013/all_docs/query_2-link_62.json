Apparently she was under the spell of her husband the entire time - doing exactly what he wanted, almost like brainwashed. That's just the gossip. She overused the drugs, was anemic, depressed and whatnot. She died at the tender age of 32.\n\nHer husband died 6 months later, apparently heartbroken over her death.\n\nHere is their synastry and Composite. I see an exact Eros-Psyche conjunction in the Composite.\n\nHer birth time is known. His birth time is not known.\n\nWhat do you think made him so powerful in her life to the point she was absorbed by him.\n\nWhat made them die months apart, there must have been some serious attachment / co dependency going on...\n\nThe synastry features a Pluto-Moon opposition, along withe the Nodes. His Saturn opposes her Moon and Venus and squares her Mars ( submissive to him).\n\nI see the dreaded ( by me) Saturn - Chiron conjunction - I found this synastrical aspect very hard to break, I mean - the proverbial glue. Seems like these two followed each other in the grave.\n\n==================\n\nComposite:\n\n====================\n\nSynastry:\n\nIP: Logged\n\nEmpty Spaces\n\nKnowflake\n\nPosts: 607\n\nFrom:\n\nRegistered: Jun 2015\n\nposted November 17, 2015 11:24 PM Interesting topic!I dont know how to read charts unfortunaly but WHAT is that?IS a butterfly in both charts?Wow cant wait to see Leeloo comment about it.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nhypatia238\n\nModerator\n\nPosts: 2982\n\nFrom: AC-Neptune Quintile AMOR\n\nRegistered: Sep 2014\n\nposted November 17, 2015 11:38 PM I would check Eurydike and Orpheus in their synastry and composite as well as natals and I would check for atropos, ophelia and ceres.\n\nI would check for pyramus and thisbe.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nhypatia238\n\nModerator\n\nPosts: 2982\n\nFrom: AC-Neptune Quintile AMOR\n\nRegistered: Sep 2014\n\nposted November 18, 2015 12:12 AM In Midpoint they have an exact AMOR conjunct MOON which conjuncts by 3d JUNO.\n\nThey have a AMOR-MOON-JUNO-CERES midpoint composite stellium. They also have the LOVE stellium with Venus conjunct Horus under 1d. In Davison they have SUN-MERCURY-JUNO tight stellium.\n\n^all that explains the strong love, devotion and commitment to one another.\n\nNow on to the spooky stuff!\n\nIn Davison there is a YOD:\n\nEURYDIKE in VIRGO @29d00\n\nATROPOS in SCORPIO @29d23\n\nOPHELIA in CAPRICORN @28d16\n\nSATURN in GEMINI @29d54 retro\n\nPYRAMUS in GEMINI @28d44 retro\n\nSOUTHNODE in GEMINI @28d33\n\nSo we have Saturn-Pyramus-Southnode at the apex of the YOD inconjuncting ATROPOS sextile OPHELIA! Yes that did just happen. To top it off Atropos also sextiles exact Eurydike and is at the most karmic degree of the zodiac Scorpio @29d.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nhypatia238\n\nModerator\n\nPosts: 2982\n\nFrom: AC-Neptune Quintile AMOR\n\nRegistered: Sep 2014\n\nposted November 18, 2015 12:23 AM In addition they have EURYDIKE conjunct OPHELIA under 1d in Synastry which along with what I found on the Davison sums up it extremely well.\n\nIP: Logged\n\npage one\n\nKnowflake\n\nPosts: 534\n\nFrom: USA\n\nRegistered: Jun 2012\n\nposted November 18, 2015 11:56 AM He was also a suspect in her very mysterious death.

This young woman , full of live and vigour, got sucked into a strange vortex leading to her death. And his afterwards, both of them in their 30s.\n\nhere is what I just read:\n\nThe death of Brittany Murphy is under renewed scrutiny after her father, Angelo Bertolotti, revealed a report from a private lab saying the actress had high levels of heavy metals in her system  evidence he says shows she and husband Simon Monjack were deliberately poisoned.\n\nWow goose bumps, I think something is definitely up and I don't think Simon killed her and what you just showed confirms that instinct. I do think they loved each other deeply even though they had their issues.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nOrange\n\nKnowflake\n\nPosts: 3716\n\nFrom: Georgia\n\nRegistered: May 2009\n\nposted November 19, 2015 12:35 AM Indeed!\n\nThe transits for their composite on the day of her death -\n\nTransiting North Node right on their love stellium.

Ouch....he must have blamed himself and felt he brought it onto her or someone hurt her to hurt him.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nCappi112\n\nKnowflake\n\nPosts: 454\n\nFrom: New York, New York, USA\n\nRegistered: May 2015\n\nposted November 19, 2015 03:32 AM My understanding of their deaths was that there was suspicion someone murdered both of them. I can't remember - I just know there was a huge amount of conspiracy around this.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nEmpty Spaces\n\nKnowflake\n\nPosts: 607\n\nFrom:\n\nRegistered: Jun 2015\n\nposted November 19, 2015 09:06 AM Hey Orange\n\nI have 2 chiron aspects in composite with my ex.The same composite with four saturns i mentioned in other thread.Im kinda surprised cuz no pain was felt.No healing either,i guess.\n\nChiron square venus and sun less than 1 degree.\n\nFor some reason it was numb.\n\nIP: Logged\n\nOrange\n\nKnowflake\n\nPosts: 3716\n\nFrom: Georgia\n\nRegistered: May 2009\n\nposted November 19, 2015 08:09 PM ^^^&^\n\nyes, Chiron squares suck.
