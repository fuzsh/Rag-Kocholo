        "text": "A shadowy theory claiming Brittany Murphy was murdered has emerged ten years after her death.\n\nHer own half-brother claims to have exposed inconsistencies surrounding the collapse and later death of his sister aged just 32.\n\nFrom drugs debt, to shadowy deals and even claims the Clueless actress' own mother was sharing a bed with Brittany's screen-writer husband Simon Monjack, Tony Bertolotti has shared his investigations.\n\nThere is little evidence of foul play but Tony, who is sharing his father Angelo's findings, even claims Brittany's mother may be in the frame.\n\nWild allegations Monjack, who died five months after Brittany, \"was shacked up with Sharon\" have also emerged.\n\nA Los Angeles coroner ruled at the time both deaths were due to pneumonia, anemia and drug intoxication, after dozens of prescription pills were found in their systems.\n\nBertolotti said that their father Angelo was 'chasing the truth' right up to his death aged 92, and now he wants to convince people about what he thinks has been 'covered up'.\n\nBrittany's 40-year-old husband had ran up a six-figure debt with a number of failed businesses as he tried to make a go of it in Hollywood.\n\nIt has been reported that Brittany's behaviour took a turn for the worse after she getting together with Monjack, marrying him just months after meeting him in 2007.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was said to have been facing deportation as his visa had expired.\n\nBertolotti claims the deaths \"sound business-related to me,\" and that he isn't convinced that drugs were what took Brittany's life.\n\nHe argues: \"I'm sure there was experimentation. But Brittany was conservative with that stuff, she was a bright girl.\"\n\nBertolotti added that he believed that some people thought Brittany was more valuable as an 'asset' if she was dead, rather than if she stayed alive.\n\nHe adds that his father believed his ex-wife Sharon killed Brittany - but Tony rubbishes this claim.\n\nAlthough he does say Monjack was dating Sharon rather than Brittany.\n\nTMZ reported Sharon, who admitted sharing a bed with Monjack.\n\nTony adds: 'Would I dig that Sharon would murder her own daughter? Absolutely not. I know people are saying that, but I know Sharon. I don't like her, but personally do that to her daughter? I don't think so. Sharon would have given up her life for her daughter, but 'they' didn't want hers.\n\n\"This is bigger than Sharon.\""
