        "meta_description": "gravelinetours on July 10, 2024: \"RIP Brittany ðŸ’”\n\nThe mystery surrounding Brittany Murphyâ€™s passing deepened further when her husband, Simon Monjack, a third-tier Hollywood screenwriter, died of similar causes less than six months later.\n\nIn February 2010, L.A. County Coroner Asst. Chief Ed Winter concluded that Murphy's death was the result of untreated pneumonia, combined with anemia and drug intoxication from prescription and over-the-counter medications, including painkillers and cold medicine. No illegal drugs were found in her system.\n\nOn May 23, 2010, Sharon found her son-in-law unresponsive in the home. Monjack, then 40, was pronounced dead after the LAFD was called to the residence for a medical emergency, PEOPLE reported at the time. Like Murphy, a coroner later determined acute pneumonia and severe anemia as the causes of the screenwriter's death.\n\nThere was speculation that the couple's deaths could have been related to mold in the home, but that theory was later dismissed by the medical examiner's office in 2010 and mysteries have continued to surround their deaths â€” and their former home has become a key player in the confounding story.\n\nIn a two part HBO documentary \"What Happened To Brittany?\" the film explores the deceptions and behaviors of Monjack who was considered by most in Brittany's orbit an insidious force. Many speculate that he was somehow the real cause of her downfall. \n\nSee behind Hollywood's veil ðŸ‘‰ www.graveline.rip\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n #hollywood #brittanymurphy #mystery #simonmonjack #coroner #pneumonia #prescription #painkillers #drugs #emergency #deaths #gravelinetours #losangeles #hauntedlosangeles #ghosttours #hollywood #truecrimecommunity #truecrimeaddict #serialkillers #truecrimejunkie #murderino #truecrimeobsessed #ssdgm #unsolvedmysteries #paranormal #coldcase #hauntedmansion #crimescene #od #fyp\".",
