        "text": "Police are investigating the death of actress Brittany Murphy Sunday morning in Los Angeles. The 32-year-old star of such pics as “8 Mile,” “Clueless” and “Don’t Say a Word” was found unconscious in the shower by her mother Sunday morning, according to various reports.\n\nHer husband, writer-producer Simon Monjack, called paramedics, and she was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the Los Angeles Police Dept. is investigating the cause of her death, but the LAPD wouldn’t say if criminal conduct is suspected.\n\nMurphy, born in Atlanta, started out in TV’s “Murphy Brown” in 1991. Her other credits include 2005’s “Sin City,” 2004’s “Little Black Book,” 2003’s “Uptown Girl” and “Just Married,” plus 1999’s “Girl, Interrupted.” In “Clueless,” she played Alicia Silverstone’s perky sidekick, while in “8 Mile,” she was Eminem’s love interest.\n\nShe did voice work on animated shows such as “Futurama” and “King of the Hill” plus pics including “Happy Feet.” According to Imdb.com, she had a number of films in production, including “Abandoned,” “Something Wicked,” “The Expendables” and “Shrinking Charlotte.”\n\nHer voice was featured in a 2006 single, “Faster Kill Pussycat” from Paul Oakenfold’s album “A Lively Mind.” It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club chart.\n\nHer role in “8 Mile” led to more recognition, Murphy told the AP in 2003. “That changed a lot,” she said. “That was the difference between people knowing my first and last name as opposed to not.”\n\nMurphy credited her mother, Sharon, with being a key to her success. “When I asked my mom to move to California, she sold everything and moved out here for me,” Murphy told the AP. “I was really grateful to have grown up in an environment that was conducive to creating and didn’t stifle any of that. She always believed in me.”\n\nShe dated Ashton Kutcher, who co-starred with Murphy in 2003’s romantic comedy “Just Married.”\n\nKutcher tweeted Sunday morning about Murphy’s death: “2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine,” Kutcher wrote. “My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany’s family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon.”\n\n(The Associated Press contributed to this report.)"
