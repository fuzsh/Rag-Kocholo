        "text": "The baffling story of the double deaths sent shockwaves around the world, and it remains as intriguing today as it did back then.\n\nHere are some of the reasons why:\n\nCONFUSION OVER MURPHY'S FINAL HOURS\n\nIn 2011, Alex Ben Block from The Hollywood Reporter wrote a harrowing account of the hours prior to Murphy's death, pieced together from interviews he'd done with her mother Sharon (who lived with the couple at their Hollywood Hills home) and Monjack.\n\nBlock had been a friend of the family's for years, and even gave a eulogy at Murphy's funeral.\n\nAfter her death, he wrote that Sharon had come across her daughter \"lying on the patio trying to catch her breath\" in the early hours of the morning on December 20th.\n\n\"I said 'Baby, get up.' She said: 'Mummy, I can't catch my breath. Help me. Help me,\" Block wrote she'd told him later.\n\nHe added that Monjack told him: \"She said to her mum 'I'm dying. I'm going to die. Mummy, I love you.\"\n\nBlock wrote that it wasn't until Murphy collapsed around 8am that they called emergency services, who coached them in resuscitation over the phone until paramedics arrived.\n\nHowever, Sharon totally denied those claims in a statement to Entertainment Tonight in 2011.\n\nShe stated: \"As I am dealing daily with the heart-wrenching loss of my entire family, I am shocked by Mr. Block's statements. This is very disturbing that someone that was supposed to be mine and Brittany's friend, and someone who works for The Hollywood Reporter, would make statements that are 100-percent untrue. For anyone to even fathom that I would just sit and watch my only beloved daughter die and not get help instantly is beyond my way of thinking and despicable.\"\n\nA large amount of prescription drugs were reportedly found in the home, although Monjack claimed many of these were simply out of date medications.\n\nJust five months after the death of his late wife, Monjack was found dead in the master bedroom by Sharon.\n\nTHE HAIR TEST\n\nDespite the coroner's finding that Murphy's death was accidental from natural causes, persistent rumours prompted her estranged father Angelo Bertolotti to get a private toxicology test to rule out any foul play.\n\nThe results found there were high levels of toxic metals present in her hair, including barium, which is used in some rat poisons, leading to reports she'd been poisoned.\n\nL.A. County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter told Extra afterwards that they \"could have reopened the case, but we didn't think it warranted it.\"\n\n\"[T]he only thing they found was heavy metals present, but I guess either our folks or a doctor explained to them it was due to Brittany colouring her hair … It was determined it was from colour.\"\n\nBut as forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht told E!, that's not necessarily the way other experts would have approached it.\n\n\"I would have checked to see if the private lab results were valid and, if they could be corroborated and analysed, whether there was exposure, and where did the exposure come from. You have two people — a husband and a wife — dying within five months of each other. And, not engaging in any wild speculation, with two young people dying five months apart, you've got to check it out, and I still don't know what happened.\"\n\nMONJACK'S 'SHADY' PAST\n\nThroughout their entire relationship, there were concerns about the influence Murphy's unknown older boyfriend had on her.\n\nThe screenwriter, eight years Murphy's senior, and the actress began dating in 2007 and were married in May that year in a whirlwind romance.\n\nBut by many accounts, he was not the most savoury character.\n\nGeorge Hickenlooper, director of the movie Factory Girl (for which Monjack received a writing credit) called him a \"conman and a bad guy\".\n\nShortly after Murphy passed away, Hickenlooper wrote on a blog: \"I only hope that this creep wasn't instrumental in her sad demise\".\n\nIt wasn't the only stain on Monjack's reputation.\n\nHe reportedly had two warrants for his arrest in Virginia for alleged credit-card theft and fraud, an unpaid $US6,087 legal bill, a $502,910 judgment against him by a British investment firm, evictions from four homes and he was jailed in 2007 for overstaying his tourist visa.\n\nFans grew even more concerned about the type of man Monjack was after he was quoted in 2008 saying he first met Murphy when she was \"too young to touch\".\n\n\"To make a long story short, I was very patient,\" he added to a New York Post reporter at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nHe also caused controversy after his wife's death when he tried to persuade investigators not to conduct a post-mortem on her body.\n\nMonjack explained that it was because he couldn't bear the idea of having her body cut open, and called the coroner relentlessly – though his request was rejected.\n\nHis strange behaviour sparked widespread internet rumours that he was somehow involved in her death, a claim which he angrily denied.\n\nJust two months later, the inquest found Murphy died from pneumonia complicated by an iron deficiency and multiple prescription drug intoxication.\n\nMURPHY'S WILL\n\nInterestingly, despite her three-year marriage to Monjack, Murphy very deliberately left him out of her will.\n\nShe left her entire estate — worth at least a few million dollars — to her mother instead.\n\nDespite the snub, Monjack claimed at the time that he was fine with the way his wife's assets had been divided.\n\nHe even insisted it was on his request that he was not named as a beneficiary — according to him, the will specifically stated: \"I am married to Simon Monjack who I have intentionally left out of this will.\"\n\nMURPHY'S BELONGINGS WERE SOLD OFF\n\nIn 2013, Bertolotti accused the late actress' mother of selling off all of her belongings on auction sites for personal profit.\n\nHe alleged that Sharon used the entertainment memorabilia website Julien's Auctions to sell their daughter's private items — even her passport and Screen Actor's Guild membership card.\n\nThe late actress' dresses, shoes and even a bra were also listed among the goods for sale.\n\nOn the auction website, the items all appeared to have sold, collecting hundreds of dollars apiece.\n\nThere are certainly a number of elements that make this tragic story an intriguing one.\n\nBut despite plenty of wild speculation in the years since Murphy's death, the case has never been reopened.\n\nIn an Investigation Discovery (ID) documentary titled Brittany Murphy: An ID Mystery, which came out in June, forensic pathologist Dr Cyril Wecht said the case had always puzzled him.\n\n\"What stood out to me was that here's a young woman of 32 years old,\" he explained. \"How could she have developed such an advanced state pneumonia and such an incredible state of iron deficiency?\n\n\"Where in the world was her mother, her husband? Why didn't she receive proper medical care? I was just puzzled by all of it. She had the financial means to see a doctor. And then she had prescriptions to strong opiates. It was very perplexing.\"\n\nIs it impossible to rule out murder? Dr Wecht said that was hard to say.\n\n\"But impossible is a strong word that I don't like to use without absolute certainty. The one thing that is absolute in science and in forensic science is cellular DNA,\" he said.\n\n\"Take into consideration how someone would have gained access to 10 different heavy metals. How would you put them together? Why were 10 put together instead of one or two? How did they get there? And it takes time to build up heavy metals in hair. It doesn't just happen with one dose.\n\n\"I can only say what I've said before – it's not possible to completely rule out things,\" he continued. \"But you have to deal with the questions – questions that I feel were never truly answered.\"\n\nDr Wecht said Murphy's body was past the point of investigating.\n\n\"The body has undergone extensive decomposition at this point,\" he said. \"Now it's all over. There's no way meaningful scientific studies can be done. But there's no question about the pneumonia.\n\n\"This was shown and proven. There's no question at all about the advanced pneumonia or the iron deficiency. That cannot be avoided … Still, it's all too late now.\""
