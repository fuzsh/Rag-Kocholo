        "text": "Nearly 10 years after Brittany Murphy‘s sudden passing, the cast of the hit ’90s movie “Clueless” are looking back on working with the late actress.\n\n“She was really lovely to work with,” Alicia Silverstone, who starred as Cher Horowitz, told an audience at the C2E2 Expo over the weekend (via SyFy Wire).\n\nShe went on to explain that she was in the room with director/writer Amy Heckerling when Murphy auditioned for the role of Tai.\n\n“I remember just being blown away by what she did in that room and then thinking I had to tell Amy, just in case she didn’t know, that Brittany Murphy was the one that had to play the part,” she said, adding, “She was so good, I love when she says, ‘You’re a virgin who can’t drive.’ It’s just one of my favorite moments of the whole movie.”\n\nPaul Rudd chimed in, “She was just always so smiley and sweet.”\n\nBreckin Meyer, who played Tai’s love interest Travis Birkenstock, called Murphy “ridiculously talented,” while Donald Faison listed off that she could also sing and dance."
