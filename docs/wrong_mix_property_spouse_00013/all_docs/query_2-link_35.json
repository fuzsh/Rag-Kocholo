This plays everything.\" He then bragged at all the different programs he had available to him.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDuring the hours-long interview — captured only by RadarOnline.com — Simon set the record straight, defending himself against those who believed he was only out for Brittany's money after her bizarre passing in December 2009.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n“I think the biggest misconception is that I somehow lived off my wife,” Simon told us during the interview. “I paid the bills around here. I’m quite good with math so I started trading currency derivatives. You either lose everything or you make vast amounts of money. In my case I’ve made vast amounts of money.”\n\nMORE ON:\n\nBrittany Murphy\n\nRegis Philbin's Will Reveals TV Legend Left Behind $16 Million In Property, Put Wife Joy In Charge Of Estate Worth $150 Million\n\nEx-Producers Accused Jerry Springer of Using Show Fame to Woo Adult Film Stars & Strippers: 'Our Real Job Was to Get Pretty Girls'\n\nHugh Hefner's Widow Crystal, 37, Claims She Was Never 'in Love' With Playboy Founder Husband\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nClaiming his grandfather owned a steel company overseas, Brittany's husband alleged his love for art set him up for life.\n\n\"When I was much younger there was a young artist coming up called Damien Hirst. I kept some of his canvases you could buy for 500 or 600 pounds a canvas, so I bought 100 or 150 of them,” he stated. “Today those same canvases start at $2 million each. I’ve been busy either losing money on the stock market or selling art ever since.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSimon scoffed at rumors that he married Brittany to avoid deportation. “Brittany married me for a visa. Do you really think she needed the five grand that badly?” he asked our cameras. “If we’re going to have stories let’s have real stories! Like, she married me because I’m so hairy. But for a visa? No.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nNo room was off limits when Simon invited RadarOnline.com into the home that his wife had passed away in. At the time, he still lived there with his mother-in-law, Sharon Murphy.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBrittany died on December 20, 2009, after collapsing on her bathroom floor. The 8 Mile actress was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nDespite the coroner ruling her cause of death as pneumonia, fans were suspicious. Their skepticism grew after Simon was found dead in the same home only 5 months later."
