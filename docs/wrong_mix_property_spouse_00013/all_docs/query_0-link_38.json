        "text": "Simon Monjack, who was found dead in his Hollywood home just five months after his wife, actress Brittany Murphy collapsed and died there, needed heart surgery but kept putting it off.\n\n“‘Simon needed a heart bypass,” according to Monjack’s spokesman Roger Neal . “I was told he needed a bypass, and I said to him, ‘Simon, you have so much going on, let’s keep you healthy.’ I said, ‘You want to be healthy. Don’t you?’ He said yes, but he said, ‘The bypass can wait.’ ”\n\nAs for how serious Monjack’s condition was, Neal told People .com: “I don’t know how much of an emergency it was. The doctors would have made him get it immediately if he needed it, but (Britney’s mother) Sharon confirmed with me he did need a bypass. They didn’t make it public because he had so much going on.‘\n\nMonjack was not in the greatest health. In January, his mother, Linda, told People that her son was “unwell and that he had suffered “a slight heart attack” a week before Brittany’s death.\n\nThe firefighters who responded to Sharon Murphy’s 911 call Sunday night reported that he may have suffered a heart attack, according to L.A. Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter .\n\nOne person not the least bit bothered by Monjack’s untimely death is Brittany’s brother Tony Bertolotti .\n\n“I didn’t have a reaction to the news. The guy was insane. He tried to keep my father’s name off (Murphy’s) the death certificate,” Bertolotti told Radaronline.com . “When I told my dad, Angelo, about the news, he felt he same way. We are sad for my sister – not for him.”"
