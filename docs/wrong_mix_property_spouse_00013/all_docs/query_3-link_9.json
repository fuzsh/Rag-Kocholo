        "text": "With hit movies like 8 Mile and Sin City under her belt, Brittany Murphy was one of the most in-demand celebrities in the noughties.\n\nBut in the run up to her tragic death in December 2009 at just 32, Brittany’s carefully crafted career was starting to unravel.\n\nThe US actress and singer had been left devastated after she was dropped from the sequel to kids’ movie Happy Feet, allegedly over drug use accusations.\n\nMonths before she died in Los Angeles, her character was axed from Jason Statham film The Expendables and Disney dropped her from the 2008 Tinker Bell film.\n\nHer husband British screenwriter Simon Monjack – who died five months after from the same causes – was convinced Brittany wouldn’t have died if she had stayed in her hometown.\n\nHe said at the time: “The nature of this town is exploitative.\n\n“Brittany would be alive today if she was a housewife in Edison, N.J or a successful person in another business.”\n\nThe actress – who first made her name in 1995 film Clueless – was rushed to hospital in December 2009 where she passed away.\n\nNow a new documentary What Happened Brittany Murphy? coming to Binge on November 7 claims to shed new light on the actress’ sudden and tragic death.\n\nBrittany was found to have died of natural causes but the days and weeks leading up to her death showed a life in disarray.\n\nAlthough she was worth $13 million at her time of death and living in a Los Angeles mansion with her husband and mum, Brittany was allegedly surrounded by filth.\n\nAuthor of the Brittany Murphy Files, Bryn Curt James wrote that where she died, she was surrounded by a “mountain of clothes, make-up, perfumes, an oxygen machine and medical supplies … It was a ready-made drugstore.”\n\nJames added: “The large bed was stained and the sheets twisted and drenched in sweat. Flanking each side of the bed were nightstands covered in … Half-drunk bottles of water, prescription medication bottles, some open and some empty, and used tissues.”\n\nThe house – once owned by US pop star Britney Spears – was prone to power cuts which saw the three relatives scurry around holding flashlights.\n\nSimon told The Hollywood Reporter before his death in 2010: “She absolutely hated the Rising Glen house.\n\n“Every time we would drive up Sunset, Brit would say, ‘Please, can we stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel?’\n\n“I’d say, ‘Honey, you’ve got to be realistic. We have our house, a 10,000-square-foot home. We’re going to stay in it.’”\n\nWhen she died she had been planning to move to New York with Simon and try for a baby.\n\nIn the run up to her death, Brittany was living with her mother Sharon and husband Simon – who both were struggling with ill health.\n\nBrittany’s own health was suffering – she was anaemic, had a heart murmur and suffered from chronic pain in her jaw from a 1995 car accident.\n\nWhen she died she was taking antidepressants, antibiotics, migraine pills, cough medicine and beta blockers.\n\nBrittany cared for Sharon who was recovering from breast cancer, while husband Simon suffered from seizures after falling off a ladder, asthma and sleep apnoea.\n\nHe had suffered a mild heart attack on a flight back from Puerto Rico weeks before her death.\n\nBrittany had been fired from film The Caller on the first day on set in San Juan, reportedly due to Simon’s behaviour.\n\nProducers later told how Brittany’s departure was mutual after Simon’s lawyer was in touch.\n\nThe new documentary lays a huge amount of blame for her death on Simon, claiming that he controlled every part of her life and had a sick taste in women who looked anorexic.\n\nThe screenwriter had already been nicknamed ‘Con-jack’, over his claims that he had written the 2006 Sienna Miller film, Factory Girl.\n\nDirector George Hickenlooper disputed the claims, saying, “Simon Monjack had nothing to do with Factory Girl.\n\n“He filed a frivolous lawsuit against us making bogus claims that we had stolen his script.\n\n“He held us literally to hostage and we were forced to settle with him as he held our production over a barrel.”\n\nWhile what happened in Puerto Rico is still unknown, it was established Brittany, Simon and Sharon decided to spend a week in the country.\n\nDuring the trip both Sharon and Simon picked up a cold – a virus called Staphylococcus.\n\nWhen they returned, Brittany also caught the bug which then turned into laryngitis.\n\nThen she began to suffer from flu-like symptoms but for unknown reasons did not see a doctor about her deteriorating health.\n\nIn the six weeks before she died she had a telephone appointment and, using the false name Lola Manilow, she saw a pharmacist.\n\nOn the morning she died, Brittany’s mother Sharon found her lying on their patio struggling to breathe.\n\nAccording to Sharon, Brittany said: “I’m dying. I’m going to die. Mommy, I love you.”\n\nSharon – who was used to Brittany being dramatic about illnesses – allegedly shrugged her illness off and gave her tea.\n\nBut Sharon fiercely denied this: “For anyone to even fathom that I would just sit and watch my only beloved daughter die and not get help instantly is beyond my way of thinking and despicable.“\n\nAt 8am local time, Brittany collapsed and was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center by ambulance but doctors were unable to save her\n\nThe coroner who conducted her autopsy said her death was down to anaemia, pneumonia mixed with the medications she was on.\n\nLA coroner Ed Winter said: “This death could’ve been preventable.\n\n“Murphy was planning on seeing a doctor, but she unfortunately passed away before she did.\n\n“This was a case of a person with pneumonia who was anaemic and was taking medication when she should’ve been getting medical treatment.”\n\nBut husband Simon insisted he had been taking care of the star.\n\nHe told People at the time, “I had no idea she had pneumonia. I took very good care of my wife, she was on an antibiotic and she was taking cough medicine and doing all the right things.”\n\nFollowing her death, conspiracy theories arose about what had actually happened to the seemingly healthy star.\n\nTheories took hold after her husband died from the same causes – pneumonia and anaemia – five months after she passed.\n\nOne theory was that toxic mould had been present in her LA mansion where Simon continued to live with Brittany’s mother after the actress’ death.\n\nBrittany’s publicist Roger Neal said the home was tested by “a well-respected company” for dangerous mould just two months before Brittany’s death.\n\nAnd mum Sharon agreed: “One cause we now know may have been toxic mould that was eventually discovered in that house – which may have been what really killed her.”\n\nBut the coroner said: “There were no indicators that it was from mould.”\n\nThe new documentary has found that Simon had drained Brittany’s bank account of $3 million in just three years.\n\nIn 2013, Brittany’s estranged father Angelo Bertolotti claimed on Good Morning America his daughter had been murdered.\n\nHe said: “I have a feeling that there was definitely a murder situation here. Yeah, it’s poison.”\n\nFamily friend Julia David added: “Our theory is that [Murphy and her husband] were poisoned. But the rest investigators should look into and determine.”\n\nA furious Sharon dismissed her ex-husband’s claims.\n\nShe wrote in an open letter: “Angelo has shown he only wants to trade on Brittany’s life, career and good reputation – even at the cost of putting a cloud over her memory.”"
