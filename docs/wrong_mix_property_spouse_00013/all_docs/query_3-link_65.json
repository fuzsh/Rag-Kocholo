        "text": "An autopsy was under way today on the body of actress Brittany Murphy, who died at the age of 32 after she apparently went into cardiac arrest at her Hollywood Hills home. Assistant Coroner Chief Ed Winter said the cause of death would likely be deferred pending the toxicology report, which would not be available for six to eight weeks.\n\nWinter said initial reports indicates that Murphy’s death may have been a result of heart-related causes and that there were no visible signs of trauma.\n\nMurphy was found unconscious in the shower at her home about 8 a.m. Sunday by her mother, and her husband, screenwriter Simon Monjack, called 911 to report she wasn’t breathing, the celebrity news Web site TMZ.com reported.\n\nMurphy had reportedly been sick and vomiting in the days before her death and taking prescription medications for flu-like symptoms.\n\nShe was pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at 10:04 a.m. Sunday, a hospital spokeswoman said.\n\nLos Angeles police officers responded to Murphy’s home on Rising Glen Road in the hills above the Sunset Strip early Sunday. Foul play was not suspected, said Officer Cleon Joseph, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.\n\nNo funeral plans were immediately announced.\n\nSeveral celebrities, meanwhile, accessed their Twitter accounts to express their grief over Murphy’s death.\n\n“Brittany Murphy was an incredible ray of Light to so many people. Her smile was contagious. My prayers are with her family and loved ones,’ wrote Jessica Simpson.\n\nLindsay Lohan wrote that “My deepest condolences (sic) go out to all of Brittany Murphy’s loved ones & may she rest in peace… She was a great talent w/a beautiful soul…’\n\nSoleil Moon Frye, who played Punky Brewster on television, tweeted: “RIP sweet Brittany. I will never forget the beautiful school girl you were and woman you became.’\n\n“Wow I am shocked about the news! RIP Brittany Murphy. My heart goes out to you and your family,’ was the reaction from “Dancing With the Stars’ performer Cheryl Burke.\n\nOn Sunday, former Murphy boyfriend Ashton Kutcher, who starred with Murphy in the 2003 romantic comedy, “Just Married,’ reacted this way: “2day the world lost a little piece of sunshine. My deepest condolences go out 2 Brittany’s family, her husband, & her amazing mother Sharon. See you on the other side kid.”\n\nLast month, an ambulance was reportedly called to an LAX arrival gate as Murphy and Monjack arrived back on a flight from Puerto Rico. At that time, it was Monjack who was sick.\n\nRising out of the TV sitcoms of the 1990s, Murphy starred in the movies “Girl Interrupted,” “Sin City,” “8 Mile,” and “Happy Feet,” and was the voice of Luanne Platter in 200-plus episodes of “King Of The Hill.”\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Murphy was raised by her mother, Sharon Murphy, in Edison, N.J., and later in Los Angeles. Her father, Angelo Bertolotti, is a convicted New Jersey mobster.\n\nMurphy landed her first role in 1991 on the television show “Blossom,” before landing getting a starring role that same year in “Drexell’s Class,” a short-lived television series. She also had recurring roles in “Sister, Sister,” “Party of Five,” and “Boy Meets World.”\n\nIn 1998 she was nominated for best leading female performance by the Young Artist Awards for the television movie “David and Lisa.”\n\nAs a singer, Murphy and Paul Oakenfold released the single “Faster Kill Pussycat” from the album “A Lovely Mind.” The song became a club hit.\n\nBefore marrying Monjack in 2007, she was engaged to talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz and had a highly publicized romance with Kutcher."
