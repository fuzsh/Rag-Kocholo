        "text": "Brittany Murphy with her husband, Simon Monjack.Courtesy of Patrick McMullan.\n\nThough very little about the circumstances surrounding the unexpected death of Brittany Murphy can be verified at this point (the L.A. County coroner is expected to perform an autopsy today), one suggestion popping up in tabloid stories about the actress is more specious than others. Take, for instance, this quote from People.com: “In addition to The White Hotel and Clueless, the Atlanta-born Murphy costarred in 8 Mile with Eminem, and Girl, Interrupted…In May of 2007, she married her White Hotel director, Simon Monjack.” The problem: Monjack and Murphy never actually made The White Hotel. It would have been a minor miracle if they had.\n\nPublished in 1981, D.M. Thomas’ novel The White Hotel has, over the last three decades, earned a reputation as one of the great unadaptable works of modern literature. A six-part postmodern mash-up of poetry, prose, and letters ostensibly about an opera singer who turns to Sigmund Freud for treatment of psychosomatic pain and visions that would foretell her own demise during the Holocaust, The White Hotel fuses intense erotic fantasy with historical catastrophe. At its best, it’s a disturbing entanglement of delirious smut and devastating horror. At its worst, it’s kind of silly.\n\nMonjack and Murphy joined a long line of filmmakers who attempted to bring The White Hotel to the screen. In 2008, Thomas even published a book, Bleak Hotel: The Hollywood Saga of The White Hotel, detailing the many failed attempts over 25 years by many notable filmmakers to adapt his literary beast for the screen. Shortly after The White Hotel was published, Barbra Streisand snatched up the rights. She allegedly lost interest when director described by Thomas in a 2004 Guardian story as “postmodern” suggested they realize the novel’s surreal sex scenes by using “glass-fibre optics to enter the woman's vagina.” (In a Times U.K. story about Bleak Hotel, that technological brainstorm is credited to Bernardo Bertolucci, but the Guardian article holds to a different chronology; in any case it seems clear that Bertolucci was once associated with the project but disappeared around the time The Last Emperor won the Oscar for best picture.) Thomas was then hired by a pair of Texans to adapt the screenplay himself, in the hopes that director Terrence Malick could be persuaded to direct. He couldn’t. Around 1990, David Lynch expressed interest in directing a new screen adaptation of the book, this one written by Dennis Potter, but when Lynch broke up with potential star Isabella Rossellini, that fell apart. After Potter’s death, Serbian director Emir Kusturica circled his screenplay, with the hopes of casting Anthony Hopkins as Freud. And then war broke out in Serbia. And then, Pedro Almodovar expressed interest. And then, David Cronenberg. The “and then”s go on ad infinitum.\n\nAn August 2006 Variety item reported that Monjack, along with producer Susan Stewart Potter, had secured a $20 million investment and planned to start filming The White Hotel that October. By May of the following year, when news broke that Murphy and Monjack had married, the film had still not gone into production, although Murphy was at that point attached to star. Whatever happened to the project after that didn’t make news.\n\nHow serious was Monjack’s attempt to make the film? It doesn’t come up in any of the many circa-2008 stories surrounding Bleak Hotel’s British release. Monjack’s most significant credit to date is contributing story material to Factory Girl; and the director of that film, George Hickenlooper, has taken to message boards to accuse Monjack of improperly suing to get an executive producer credit on the Edie Sedgwick biopic, which Hickenlooper alleges Monjack then used to scam his way into other productions. In a long comment left last night on Hollywood Elsewhere, Hickenlooper writes that he “warned” Murphy about Monjack’s criminal past, and laments, “She was a sweet sweet angel and didn't deserve anything bad to happen to her ever…She was the most talented and underrated actresses [sic] working in film.”\n\nHickenlooper’s allegations aside, Monjack and Murphy’s White Hotel has no IMDb entry, indicating that if its production was ever a real possibility, that possibility had evaporated by the time of Murphy’s death. Murphy’s credits for the past two years include a number of direct-to-video and TV movies; her last contribution to a studio release was the voice work and singing she lent to 2006’s Happy Feet.\n\nThough it does seem like something of a stretch to imagine Murphy, whose most iconic role was the Noo Yawk transfer student Tai from Amy Heckerling’s Clueless, taking on the role of a Russian opera singer who ages several decades in a early-to-mid 20th century period piece, there’s no question that starring in The White Hotel would have given the actress a chance to make good on the fleeting promise displayed in films like Girl, Interrupted and The Dead Girl. The White Hotel could have been a shining jewel of Murphy’s legacy. Instead, Murphy is a minor footnote in the The White Hotel’s Hollywood curse.\n\nPolitics\n\nDana White Plays The Trump Hype Man\n\nOn the final night of the Republican National Convention, the UFC boss offered a portrait of MAGA machismo that has become all the more potent in recent days.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ser Simon Strong Is “The Only Gentleman in an Ungentlemanly World”\n\nAs violence abounds in Westeros, Rhaenyra arranges a secret meeting with Alicent and tries to broker some kind of peace.
