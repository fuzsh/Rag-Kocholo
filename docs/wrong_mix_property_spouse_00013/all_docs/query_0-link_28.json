        "text": "Brittany Murphy didn’t leave a penny to her husband, Simon Monjack . The actress, who died after a battle with pneumonia Dec. 20 at age 32, left her entire estate to her mother, Sharon Murphy, TMZ.com reports. Years before Murphy wed Monjack in 2007, she created a handwritten will, leaving her mother everything. The will was stored in her manager’s safe. Monjack wasn’t surprised he was left out. Before they wed, the actress’ formal will, along with a trust, was drafted. At his request, the will specifically stated, “I am married to Simon Monjack who I have intentionally left out of this will,” he said. It is unclear how much Murphy’s estate is worth. Her home has been put on the market for $7.25 million.\n\nOriginally Published: March 3, 2010 at 12:00 a.m."
