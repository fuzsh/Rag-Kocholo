Brittany Murphy’s mother will write a book about the actress’ short life and strange death. Sharon Murphy told TMZ.com the book will “be my way of celebrating and honoring her extraordinary life and career.” Nonetheless, Mrs. Murphny insists the biography will be an “accurate account about my daughter, her life, loves, and career.” She says a portion of the profits will be donated to charity. Brittany died last December from pneumo-nia, anemia and prescription drugs. Her husband, Simon Monjack, was found dead five months later of “acute pneumonia and severe anemia.”
