        "text": "Margaret Tudor is a forgotten woman of the sixteenth century. Vastly understudied, she has been overshadowed by her other prominent family members such as Elizabeth I and Mary, Queen of Scots. Yet she is a fantastic example of a woman who, due to unfortunate circumstances, was thrust in to a position of power in an age where society was dominated by men. This paper will attempt to shed some more light on to Margaret’s tumultuous life by investigating why she ultimately failed to maintain control of the regency of her son, James V. Through examining her personality, her connections within the nobility and how Anglo-French relations impacted on Margaret’s position, it is hoped this study will expand on Margaret’s historiography as well as adding a fresh perspective to Margaret’s situation during the minority of her son.\n\nA. N. McLaren\\\\u27s study of political culture in the first part of the reign of Elizabeth is a thoughtful and thoroughly researched study that deals with the connections between ideology and politics, on how concepts of hierarchy, patriarchy, and commonwealth changed in the reign of Elizabeth I. McLaren places her work within a strong historiographical context that particularly follows the scholarship of John Guy and Patrick Collinson while also imposing Anthony Fletcher\\\\u27s lens of gender. McLaren places the debate on queenship within a broad context and argues that it led not only to the 1601 Essex rebellion but eventually to critiques on kings as well and the execution of Charles I in 1649. By the middle of the seventeenth century arguments against queen as sovereign had become applicable to an English male incumbent of the crown. ... The research for the study and the analysis are both first rate, though occasionally McLaren\\\\u27s writing style becomes pretentious, making the bo...\n\nIn a clever play on words, Louis Montrose’s important new book on Elizabeth I suggests a study with Elizabeth both as the focus and as a topic of her people’s discourse. The title also suggests the importance of Elizabeth in understanding early modern England; this book is not itself simply about Elizabeth but about how this queen was created, understood, and negotiated by her subjects, male and female. As Montrose points out, all of Elizabeth’s subjects produced and reproduced their queen in a variety of ways throughout their daily practices. And throughout her reign, the queen’s image was manipulated by her foreign enemies as well. ... This is a very rich book by an author who has spent much of his professional career studying Elizabeth and who has an encyclopedic knowledge of texts about her. It is full of very sophisticated close readings and well repays the attention it demands. The Subject of Elizabeth will be read and discussed for many years to come"
