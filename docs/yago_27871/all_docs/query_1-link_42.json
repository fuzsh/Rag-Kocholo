        "text": "Margaret of Anjou was the wife of England’s King Henry VI. She was a leader of the Lancastrians in the Wars of the Roses, the conflict between the two families of York and Lancaster. Margaret of Anjou was determined to make her son, Prince Edward, king of England, but she was unsuccessful.\n\nMargaret was born on March 23, 1430, in Lorraine, France. She came from a noble French family. Her marriage was arranged as part of a truce, or peace agreement, in the Hundred Years’ War between England and France. Margaret and Henry were married in April 1445. Their son was born in 1453.\n\nIn May 1455 the first battle between the Lancastrians and Yorkists took place. Richard of York and his followers won the battle. Over the next 30 years, there were many battles and power struggles over who would rule England. The Yorks and Lancasters each controlled the government at different times. Margaret spent many years planning ways to ensure her son would be king. In the end, however, Margaret’s son and husband were killed in 1471, and she returned to France. She died on August 25, 1482, near Saumur."
