        "text": "Henry VI of England\n\nProfession: King of England and Lord of Ireland\n\nBiography: Henry VI was an English monarch who reigned from 1422-1461 and again from 1470-1471. He was the only child of King Henry V, who had died in 1422, and was born on December 6th 1421. At the age of nine months he was crowned King of England, and he was also King of France until 1453.\n\nHenry VI was a weak ruler who was prone to bouts of mental illness. He was unable to prevent civil war between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, and was eventually deposed in 1461. He was briefly restored to power in 1470, but was soon deposed again.\n\nHenry VI eventually died in the Tower of London in 1471, bringing an end to the civil wars.
