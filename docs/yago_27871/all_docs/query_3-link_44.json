        "text": "Henry VI\n\nHenry VI\n\nHenry VI (1421-1471) was king of England from 1422 to 1461 and in 1470-1471. He was known for his piety and charity, but his reign was marred by the rivalries of his uncles and ministers and by the loss of the achievements of his Lancastrian predecessors.\n\nThe only son of Henry V and Catherine of France, Henry was born on Dec. 6, 1421, at Windsor. At less than 9 months of age he succeeded to the throne on Sept. 1, 1422, and he was proclaimed king of both England and France. During his minority he ruled through a council consisting of his uncle, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, as protector; Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, as master; and another uncle, John, Duke of Bedford, as governor of his French possessions. Things went well at first, and at the Battle of Verneuil (August 1424) Bedford was able to check the Dauphin (later Charles VII), who had hoped to take advantage of the minority. But soon the advantage was lost as Gloucester drove the dukes of Burgundy and of Brittany to the French side.\n\nAfter his coronations in London in 1429 and in Paris the following year, Henry tried to take an active part in government. He mediated in the feud between his uncles in 1434 and sided with the peace policy of Cardinal Beaufort. When Joan of Arc rallied the French, English interest in continuing the war declined for the next decade. Henry reached legal majority in 1442 and concluded a 2-year truce with France the next year.\n\nIn 1445 Henry married Margaret of Anjou, the daughter of René, Duke of Anjou and Lorraine and titular king of Sicily, Naples, and Jerusalem. She persuaded him to cede to Charles VII many of the possessions that England held in France. This resulted in her unpopularity with the English and was eventually to lead to her downfall, for she was to be imprisoned for 4 years after Henry's death. From this point on, interest in foreign matters depended mainly on their effect upon public feeling in England and the rivalries that later led to civil war. In 1448 Henry surrendered Maine in order to prolong the truce with France. To please public opinion, in 1450 Henry was forced to exile one of his ministers, John, Duke of Suffolk, who had been instrumental in the downfall of the popular Duke of Gloucester, and in the same year he faced his first major internal crisis in the rebellion of Jack Cade.\n\nWars of the Roses\n\nThis period saw the loss of more English holdings in France (Normandy in 1450 and Guienne by 1453) and the rise of a popular leader, Richard, Duke of York (Suffolk's father-in-law), as the head of the prowar party that had been led by Gloucester. Henry, deeply in debt, tried to calm the parties and granted a general pardon in 1452. In August 1453 he suffered temporary mental illness, and in April 1454 the Duke of York was appointed protector. Henry's only son, Edward, was born in October 1453. While the King was insane, the two rival parties for power, one side led by the Queen and the Duke of Somerset and the other by the Duke of York, started to prepare for civil war. When Henry recovered in January 1455, Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, was restored to favor, and the Duke of York was excluded from the Council. After Henry went to the north to gain support, the two sides met at the first Battle of St. Albans in May, where the King was slightly wounded, Somerset was killed, and the fighting of the Wars of the Roses commenced. (The house of York was associated with the white rose, the house of Lancaster with the red rose.)\n\nThe next year Henry again became ill, and York was made protector until the King's recovery. York was removed from office when the king's health returned but was allowed to remain on the Council. The war broke out again 4 years later, and in the Battle of Blore Heath on Sept. 23, 1459, the royal forces were defeated. On the approach of the King, however, the Yorkists fled, and 2 months later at the Parliament at Coventry the Duke of York and his followers were dishonored. But by July 1460 the Yorkists had been able to recover and gain London, and in the Battle of Northampton (July 10) Henry was taken prisoner. While the Queen fled to the north to gather allies, the Duke of York claimed the throne, and the two forces met at the Battle of Wakefield (December 30), where the Duke of York was killed. The Queen was unable to follow up the victory, even after a second battle at St. Albans (Feb. 17, 1461), where the King was rescued.\n\nEarly in March, Edward, Duke of York, declared himself King Edward IV with the support of London as Henry fled. Henry's followers continued to battle on his behalf unsuccessfully, at the Battle of Towton (March 29, 1461) and at Hexham (May 15, 1464). After hiding first with the Scots and then on the Lancashire-Yorkshire border, Henry was finally captured in 1465 and put in the Tower of London for 5 years. He was briefly restored to the throne after his release (Oct. 3, 1470) due to the support of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick (\"Kingmaker\"). Warwick, however, was slain at the Battle of Barnet (April 14, 1471), and Henry's son, Edward, was killed a month later at the Battle of Tewkesbury. Henry was recommitted to the Tower, where he was murdered, possibly by Edward IV's brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later Richard III). On May 22 Henry's body was placed on display at St. Paul's Cathedral and then buried with little ceremony at Chertsey Abbey.\n\nHenry was worshiped as a martyr by people in the north of England, and Henry VII had his remains reburied at St. George's Chapel, Windsor, giving up an attempt to have Henry VI canonized as being too costly. Henry VI was the first monarch to establish the royal motto Dieu et Mon Droit, and as a patron of learning he founded Eton (1440) and King's College, Cambridge (1441), as well as suggesting to his queen the foundation of Queen's College, Cambridge (1448).\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThere is no standard biography of Henry VI, although much of the source material is in print. Detailed studies of the period include Sir Charles W. C. Oman, Warwick the Kingmaker (1891); Cora L. Scofield, The Life and Reign of Edward the Fourth (1923); and Jack R. Lander, The Wars of the Roses (1966). General histories of the period are Alec Reginald Myers, England in the Later Middle Ages (1952), and Ernest Fraser Jacob, The Fifteenth Century, 1399-1485 (1961).\n\nAdditional Sources\n\nAlexander, Peter, Shakespeare's Henry VI and Richard III, Norwood, Pa.: Norwood Editions, 1975; Philadelphia: R.

Henry VI was the youngest king of England ever to ascend the throne; the only king never to know what it was like not to be king; the only one ever to be crowned king of France; and arguably the worst, who inherited two kingdoms and lost both. His reign is divided into three parts by modern historians as well as by Shakespeare. The first is his minority (1422–37); the second is his active majority (1437–53); and the third is the period of his mental incapacity (1453 until his death). Given the inherent dangers, Henry's minority was remarkably successful. Those who inherited power in 1422 in the name of the infant king were the same lords and retainers who had served the house of Lancaster from the time of John of Gaunt. They shared the overriding objective of preserving for the time he came of age the inheritances won by his grandfather and father in England and France. Fifteen years later not only was Henry still on the throne (he was crowned king of England in 1429, king of France in 1431), but his kingdom was not unduly lawless, the crown was solvent, and a substantial part of Henry V's conquests in France remained in Lancastrian hands. In 1437, when the king began to play a part in affairs, the old guard had discharged its duty as well as could be expected.\n\nIt was a cruel trick of fate to provide Henry V with a son who was the very antithesis of the martial and regal traditions of the house of Lancaster. Henry VI proved to be improvident, malleable, vacillating, partisan, uninterested in the arts of government, and, above all, antipathetic to the chivalric world his ancestors had adorned. As soon as he came of age he turned his back on the war in France. The defining moment came in 1440 when at 18 he had the opportunity to take the field in Normandy. Instead he sent his cousin the duke of York as his lieutenant, devoting himself to the foundation of Eton College. Within ten years the government of the kingdom had fallen into the hands of an unscrupulous court faction led by William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, royal debts were mounting, and Normandy was lost. In 1450 the regime was shaken by Cade's revolt, the most widespread and sustained popular rising since 1381. It says much for the residual strength of the dynasty that it survived these shocks. Indeed when Henry suffered his devastating mental collapse in 1453, the reign appeared to be set on a more stable course.\n\nHenry VI fell into a coma in August 1453. He recovered his senses just before Christmas 1454, but was permanently impaired. In some respects his recovery was politically more destabilizing than his collapse. While comatose Henry could be treated as a child again, a protectorate was established, and government entrusted to a council; after his partial recovery, he became a puppet tossed this way and that by faction. By 1459 royal government was almost totally powerless, the administration of the law had virtually collapsed, and the crown was bankrupt. In the civil war that erupted Henry was but a passive onlooker. In 1461 he became the victim when he was deposed by the victorious Edward IV. But his life was spared. There was no sentiment in this. Throughout the 1460s the hope of his cause was carried by his only son and heir Edward, in exile in France; killing Henry would only have promoted a more plausible Lancastrian claimant. In 1470 he was restored to the throne for six months. Coming out of the Tower for rare public appearances, he was a pitiful sight. But the death of the prince of Wales at Tewkesbury in 1471 sealed his own fate, and a few days later he was done to death.\n\nHenry was a more effective force after his death than ever he was in his life. There soon developed a cult surrounding his saintliness, miracles were reported, and Edward IV was obliged to repress it. Richard III moved his body from Waltham, which had become a place of pilgrimage, to Windsor, the better to control the phenomenon. After 1485 Henry VII endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to secure his canonization. It was at this time that John Blacman was commissioned to produce his Recollections, which have fixed the image of the saintly king. But Blacman's portrait of a prudish, unworldly man inhabiting a court more like a convent drew upon memories of Henry after 1453. Before then he had been a man of the world, maintaining a court as splendid as any in Europe. The sad truth is that between 1437 and 1453, between the ages of 16 and 32, Henry had been, as king in deed and as well as name, one of the most incompetent ever to rule England. In another age, and another society, a man who turned his back on vainglorious war, and whose greatest achievements were in the promotion of education (through the foundations of Eton and King's College, Cambridge), might have been more highly regarded. But in 15th-cent. England a king like Henry VI was a public disaster.\n\nAnthony James Pollard\n\nBibliography\n\nGriffiths, R. A. , The Reign of Henry VI (1981);\n\nStorey, R.
