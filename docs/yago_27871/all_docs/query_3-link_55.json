        "text": "Early Ascension\n\nHenry VI became king of England at a very young age. He was crowned king at the tender age of nine months old in 1422, following the death of his father, Henry V.\n\nDual Monarchies\n\nHenry VI was not only the king of England but also the king of France (disputed). He inherited the French throne through his maternal grandfather, King Charles VI of France. However, his control over France was largely nominal, and he faced significant opposition from the French nobility.\n\nThe Wars of the Roses\n\nHenry VI's reign was marred by the Wars of the Roses, a series of civil wars fought between the rival factions of the House of Lancaster (associated with Henry) and the House of York. The wars resulted from ongoing power struggles and ultimately led to the downfall of the Lancastrian dynasty.\n\nChallenged Rule\n\nHenry VI faced numerous challenges to his rule, primarily due to his perceived weak leadership and mental instability. His inability to maintain control over his kingdom and resolve political conflicts contributed to the tensions that led to the Wars of the Roses.\n\nMental Health Issues\n\nHenry VI is believed to have experienced mental health problems, including periods of insanity. His mental instability further undermined his ability to govern effectively and contributed to the power struggles and instability during his reign.\n\nFoundation of Eton College and King's College\n\nHenry VI is renowned for his patronage of education. He founded Eton College in 1440 and King's College, Cambridge, in 1441. These institutions continue to thrive today and are among the most prestigious educational institutions in England.\n\nDeposition and Imprisonment\n\nFollowing his defeat in the Wars of the Roses, Henry VI was deposed twice. He was first deposed by Edward IV in 1461 and then restored to the throne briefly in 1470 before being deposed and imprisoned by Edward IV again in 1471.\n\nMysterious Death\n\nHenry VI's death remains the subject of speculation and debate. He died in the Tower of London on May 21, 1471, shortly after being deposed for the final time. The official cause of death was recorded as ‘melancholy’, but rumours persist of his murder.\n\nFirst Battle of St Albans\n\nOn 22 May 1455, the Yorkist army defeat the Lancastrians and capture King Henry VI. This was the first battle of the Wars of the Roses. Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Clifford were killed.\n\nBattle of Blore Heath\n\nOn 23 September 1459, the Yorkist forces, led by the Earl of Salisbury, defeat the Lancastrians, who attempted to intercept the smaller Yorkist army.\n\nBattle of Ludford Bridge\n\nOn 12 October 1459, the Lancastrians, led by King Henry VI, defeat the combined Yorkist forces of Richard, Duke of York, Richard, Earl of Salisbury and Richard, Earl of Warwick. The three Yorkist leaders flee into exile.\n\nBattle of Northampton\n\nOn 10 July 1460, the Yorkists attack and defeat King Henry VI’s Lancastrian forces, helped by Lord Grey switching sides, and allowing the Yorkists through. King Henry VI is captured. The battle lasted less than an hour.\n\nBattle of Wakefield\n\nOn 30 December 1460, the Lancastrians defeat the Yorkists outside Sandal Castle. Richard, Duke of York is killed, and Earls of Salisbury and Rutland are captured and then executed.\n\nBattle of Mortimer’s Cross\n\nOn 2 February 1461, Edward, Earl of March leads a Yorkist army to victory against the Lancastrians, led by Jasper Tudor. This was the first time the future king, Edward IV, had commanded an army.\n\nSecond Battle of St Albans\n\nOn 17 February 1461, Richard, Earl of Warwick leads the defence of St Albans against Queen Margaret’s Lancastrians forces. After terrible fighting in the streets, the Earl of Warwick retreats to London, leaving victory to the Lancastrians.\n\nBattle of Ferrybridge\n\nOn 28 March 1461, Yorkists and Lancastrians battle over the River Aire at Ferrybridge. 3000 soldiers died, and eventually the Yorkists were able to cross the river the next day.\n\nBattle of Towton\n\nOn 29 March 1461, the battle consisted of the two largest forces ever gathered in England. It was also the most bloodiest, where it is said the river ran red with blood. The Yorkists won a decisive victory over the Lancastrians, forcing Queen Margaret into exile in Scotland.\n\nBattle of Hedgeley Moor\n\nOn 25 April 1464, Lord Montague leads a Yorkist army against the Duke of Somerset and his Lancastrian forces. The Yorkists were victorious, enabling them to open negotiations of peace with Scotland.\n\nBattle of Hexham\n\nOn 15 May 1464, Richard, Earl of Warwick and the Yorkists defeat the Lancastrians, led by Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. The Duke of Somerset is captured and executed.\n\nBattle of Edgecote Moor\n\nOn 24 July 1469, the Earl of Warwick switches sides, and defeats the Yorkists; forcing Edward IV to flee to Flanders.\n\nBattle of Losecote Field\n\nOn 12 March 1470, the Earl of Warwick and Duke of Clarence rebel against Edward IV. The Yorkists are victorious, defeating Warwick and Clarence.\n\nBattle of Barnet\n\nOn 14 April 1471, Edward IV leads his Yorkist forces against Richard, Earl of Warwick and the Lancastrians. The Yorkists seized an advantage, while the Lancastrians were in disarray, and defeated them. Warwick is executed after the battle."
