        "text": "July 14, 2015\n\n#3 of 22 in my personal (and rather random) challenge to read Abbot's Makers of History series. The series is most famously known for influencing Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed reading this volume, maybe even more than Elizabeth I. I'm learning that Abbot has a sensitivity toward his subjects that is unexpected in a 19th century historian, but that may also be because I've chosen to tackle female subjects first.\n\nIt's a solidly written history book, with great pacing. I was absorbed and there is little more I could hope for.\n\nIt is also one of the most concise explanations of the War of the Roses I have read. I finally understand what it was all about. Other explanations have been too confusing, but Abbott provides a thorough and clear view of the conflict.\n\nLooking forward to reading the next volume of Abbott's series soon.\n\nApril 13, 2020\n\nA nice, simple book about Margaret of Anjou, one of history's lesser known characters.... in fact I had never heard of her.\n\nMarried by arrangement to a young Henry VI, her life - from today's viewpoint - was quite horrendous. She seems to have been genuinely fond of her sickly, weak husband, adored her son and is portrayed as both beautiful and strong-willed; the power behind the throne in fact, during the periods that Henry reigned.\n\nThis was the period of the Wars of the Roses and Margaret spent much of her married life either raising armies to regain her husband's throne for him or wandering around Europe in hiding, or in exile.\n\nThe book was easy to follow and well set out, although it didn't give a great deal in the way of historical detail or background. This was not a problem for me, as I find too much supplementary information in historical biographies can be confusing and often detracts from the story of the main character.\n\nMarch 27, 2020\n\nGelezen als ebook van Project Gutenberg. Margaret van Anjou huwde met Koning Henry VI van Engeland en werd zo koningin. De koning had regelmatig periodes waarin hij geestesziek was, en dan nam Margaret het heft in handen. Maar uiteindelijk werd de koning afgezet door de hertog van York, het begin van de Rozenoorlogen. Margaret deed er alles aan om haar man terug op de troon te krijgen, maar tevergeefs. Uiteindelijk werd eerst haar zoon vermoord, dan Henry VI, en werd zijzelf verbannen naar Frankrijk.\n\nFebruary 25, 2016\n\nMargaret of Anjou\n\nMargaret of Anjou by Jacob Abbott is an interesting book, especially to people who love by. I highly recommend it.\n\nMarch 7, 2019\n\nMargaret was crowned Queen Consort of England on 30 May 1445 at Westminster Abbey by John Stafford, Archbishop of Canterbury at the age of fifteen. On October 13, 1453 their son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, was born.\n\nRead for personal historical research. I found this work of immense interest and its contents helpful and inspiring - number rating relates to the book's contribution to my needs.\n\nOverall, this work is also a good resource for the researcher and enthusiast.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nThe story of Margaret of Anjou forms a part of the history of England, for the lady, though of Continental origin, was the queen of one of the English kings, and England was the scene of her most remarkable adventures and exploits. She lived in very stormy times, and led a very stormy life; and her history, besides the interest which it excites from the extraordinary personal and political vicissitudes which it records, is also useful in throwing a great deal of light upon the ideas of right and wrong, and of good and evil, and upon the manners and customs, both of peace and war, which prevailed in England during the age of chivalry.\n\nAfter wandering on for some time, she was alarmed by the apparition of a tall man, armed, who suddenly appeared in the pathway at a short distance before her. She had no doubt that this was another robber. It was too late for her to attempt to fly from him. He was too near to allow her any chance of escape. In this extremity, she conceived the idea of throwing herself upon his generosity as her last and only hope. So she advanced boldly toward him, leading the little prince by the hand, and said to him, presenting the prince,\n\nMargaret's appeal to the stranger. \"My friend, this is the son of your king! Save him!\"\n\nThe man appeared astonished. In a moment he laid his sword down at Margaret's feet in token of submission to her, and then immediately offered to conduct her and the prince to a place of safety. He also explained to her that he was one of her friends. He had been ruined by the war, and driven from his home, and was now, like the queen herself, a wanderer and a fugitive. He had taken possession of a cave in the wood, and there he was now living with his wife as an outlaw. He led Margaret and the prince to the cave, where they were received by his wife, and entertained with such hospitalities as a home so gloomy and comfortless could afford.\n\nJuly 9, 2018\n\nMargaret of Anjou was one of the most disliked queens of England. She fought for what was hers, and she was not afraid to do what it took to keep her throne. Showing up in England impoverished with nothing to show for the marriage, it did not set the tone for a successful relationship with the nobility in the country, although many rallied to her cause because of her husband, many deserted. She wielded power and was able to give her husband a son, although the marriage did not produce any more children. Had her husband been a stronger man, the history of England would have taken a very different turn, but he was weak both in mind and spirit.\n\nMargaret was very much a woman before her time. Very interesting book overall! I enjoyed it!\n\nOctober 30, 2019\n\nI only read this book because I needed to get a clearer idea about not only the life of Margaret, but about all the other key players in The War of the Roses. It is confusing! This book was poorly written and he doesn't tell where his sources are from, and while I almost didn't finish several times, I plowed my way through. I will read a couple more books about her, or at least one that I can think of. This is not something I would recommend and I don't understand how the ratings are as high as they are.\n\nJune 4, 2014\n\nJacob Abbott’s biography of Margaret of Anjou is written in simple terms, making it digestible for the reader who dislikes the stuffy textbook approach, yet at times it feels underwhelming.\n\nTo be fair to the author, he was basing his subject knowledge on what was available to him in the 1800s. Naturally, since then more accurate information has come to light.\n\nFor example, this is the first account of the Wars of the Roses in which the suspicion that King Henry VI’s son by Margaret of Anjou – as Queen of England – after several years of marriage and no heir, was in fact the result of an affair. Also, the description of the son’s death differs completely from all modern accounts.\n\nAt times Mr Abbott introduces a topic by stating that the following passage is according to Margaret of Anjou’s historians, suggesting that the author is just relating what was believed true at the time.\n\nWhat surprised me most was the author’s portrayal of Margaret of Anjou as a heroine!Her son was also glorified yet modern accounts describe him as a vicious little monster.\n\nMay 31, 2011\n\nThis is one of the most easily read and understood books in my collection. The author makes the Wars of the Roses vividly clear, even though it was one of the most politically convoluted eras in English history.\n\nUnfortunately, further into the book it becomes clear that this is a rather biased account, leaning to the Lancastrian side of the wars. For example, the author doesn't mention some of the uglier events of Margaret's career, such as allowing her Northern troops to pillage and plunder on their way south in 1461, and he glosses over her involvement in the butchery of York and young Edmund at Wakefield in 1460.\n\nAlthough the book is easily read, the bias becomes old. Yes, Margaret was brave and clever. She wasn't blameless and in many cases, she wasn't a heroine.\n\nSeptember 1, 2015\n\nAbbott provides a very brief overview of the life of Margaret of Anjou which is often animated and personal at times feeling like a novel.\n\nThis is reinforced by the fact that he frequently 'quotes' the conversations had by people including Henry VI who was of course unable to have such lengthy conversations for a significant period of his married life.\n\nHe details some ambiguous characters such as 'Lady Neville' making the text at times confusing.\n\nI have to admit I enjoyed the personal, more warm elements of Margaret's character being shown, however lack of source material questions the validity of such comments.\n\nWhilst I have read many older publications which I have found to be insightful, this is not one of them.\n\nJanuary 26, 2013\n\nAs noted by some of the other reviewers, this book is definitely not one Abbott's best from his historical series but it is consistent with his approach of making these characters very accessible to readers. In part, it is because he aims to provide rational and sympathetic reasons for their actions, attributing thought and intent which is less clear from this historical facts alone. Nevertheless, it does prevent him from falling prey to the trap of many historians in demonizing some at the expense of others. Margaret of Anjou is a lesser known character for many modern readers so Abbott's book is a relatively easy entree into her role at this critical juncture of English/French history.\n\nAugust 11, 2014\n\nThis one wasn't on par with the other books in the Abbott history series. A good bit of the material in it was already covered more thoroughly in the volume on Richard III. However, as far as getting a personal picture of the crafty Margaret of Anjou, it does the job. I went back and forth from being disgusted by Margaret on account of her cruelty and viciousness to feeling sympathy for her on account of the cruelty and viciousness of her enemies. Truly a brutal period in the history of England.\n\nAlso I loved the story about Lady Neville, even though it's entirely fictional.\n\nAugust 7, 2014\n\nThis book is a straightforward account of the facts of the unfortunate queen's life. It starts at her birth and marches relentlessly to her death. There is no attempt to give any insight into her personality. The writing tends to be wooden. If I had to write a paper on her life for a classroom assignment, this would be a good resource. For pleasure reading, not so much.\n\nJuly 27, 2013\n\nAn excellent accounting of the chaotic and hard times of Medieval royalty during the struggle between the Lancastrian and York households over the crown if England.\n\nDecember 17, 2018\n\nShort and quick and beautifully written. It truly portrays the tragic life of this queen. If you interested in Margret and the wars of the roses 100% pick up this quick.\n\nNovember 15, 2020\n\nThe most talented character who always stood on the right side of most issues. She married two of the most eligible bachelors, and still was jailed by one because she wanted to get away from one."
