(Wild-card for Edward IV who will not be King in this scenario).\n\nHenry is probably still deposed in this scenario but any recipe for a surviving Lancasters will be appreciated.\n\nI think Edward IV will take Catherine as a wife and thus unite the red and white rose. But otherwise, Henry Tudor might be a good match.\n\nI think Edward IV will take Catherine as a wife and thus unite the red and white rose. But otherwise, Henry Tudor might be a good match.\n\nElizabeth Woodville probably remains as a Mistress in this scenario if they even meet.\n\nHenry Tudor (Earl of Richmond) is a bit far fetched, the church was getting more liberal with consanguinity, but it became more socially acceptable to marry your cousin in the 1500's, to be fair though, Catherine and Henry would be half-cousins.\n\nI think Edward IV will take Catherine as a wife and thus unite the red and white rose. But otherwise, Henry Tudor might be a good match.\n\nEdward IV definitely.\n\nYes, and he is not gonna let her getting away.\n\nAnd i see him charming her pretty well (the man was a really charismatic) so she'll fall for him for real. And hopefully she'll have better fertility than her mom\n\nCatherine will be Duchess of York ITTL.\n\nAnd then queen of England. Being married to the daughter of Henry VI will give Edward even more legitimacy.\n\nI think Edward IV will take Catherine as a wife and thus unite the red and white rose. But otherwise, Henry Tudor might be a good match.\n\nI doubt it. More likely option would be a male-born Anne Holland or even James III when Margaret's up in Scotland.\n\nAnd then queen of England. Being married to the daughter of Henry VI will give Edward even more legitimacy.\n\nUnless Edward of Westminster marries and has kids.\n\nUnless Edward of Westminster marries and has kids.\n\nLet's make it that shortly after the girl is born he falls ill and dies\n\nAnd i see him charming her pretty well (the man was a really charismatic) so she'll fall for him for real. And hopefully she'll have better fertility than her mom\n\nIn Marguerite's defense, it very well could have been an Eleanor of Aquitaine/Louis VII situation where the husband was too pious to regularly sleep with his wife. Marguerite's mother and sister were both decently fertile.\n\nAnd then queen of England. Being married to the daughter of Henry VI will give Edward even more legitimacy.\n\nA No-War of the Roses timeline would probably improve the English Army which would solve many issues the Tudors had.\n\nIn Marguerite's defense, it very well could have been an Eleanor of Aquitaine/Louis VII situation where the husband was too pious to regularly sleep with his wife. Marguerite's mother and sister were both decently fertile.\n\nFair, Louis VII never deserved elanor.\n\nA No-War of the Roses timeline would probably improve the English Army which would solve many issues the Tudors had.\n\nYep, and the Plantagenets would stay in power!\n\nFair, Louis VII never deserved elanor.\n\nI'm not big on Eleanor, she was as manipulative as her himbo husbands were, but Louis's excuses for divorcing her were stupid. I get the whole Salic Law thing, but the real reason why they didn't have sons was because they were too busy on Crusade.\n\nI'm not big on Eleanor, she was as manipulative as her himbo husbands were, but Louis's excuses for divorcing her were stupid.
