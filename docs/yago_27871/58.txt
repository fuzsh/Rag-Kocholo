Abstract

Margaret of Anjou, who married Henry VI of England in 1445 when she was fifteen years old, was the mother of one son. This child became the most important factor in Margaret’s life. Born in 1430, Margaret’s parents were René, Duke of Anjou, and Isabelle, daughter and heir of Charles II, Duke of Lorraine. She was the niece of Charles VII of France’s wife, Marie of Anjou. Her father’s unsuccessful efforts to expand his holdings meant he was away for much of Margaret’s childhood. As a result, she spent much time with her mother Isabelle and her grandmother, the formidable Yolande of Aragon.1 The influence of these women was an important inspiration for Margaret as she became a powerful woman who headed the Lancastrian cause during the Wars of the Roses, supporting the rights of her dearly beloved son. Had she not been a mother her history would have been very different. The Lancastrians were eventually defeated, leading to the death of her husband and son and her own lonely death. Her enemies, Edward IV and his Yorkist supporters, did all they could to demonise Margaret’s reputation. Shakespeare’s portrayal of Margaret cemented this view of Margaret as a monstrous queen, which would have strong influence for centuries in terms of how Margaret was presented. More recently, some scholars have re-evaluated Margaret more positively, though as early as the 1640s Thomas Heywood described her as a woman “of a brave and Heroicke Spirit.”2 Margaret’s role in the Wars of the Roses has made her a contested figure for centuries.3
