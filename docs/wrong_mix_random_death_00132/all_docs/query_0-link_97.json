Digitized by the Internet Archive in 2015 https://archive.org/details/medicaldirectory42medi MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATION The name of the school or college and the year of graduation are shown by the significant part of the name; e.g., graduation from Cornell University Medical College in 1910 is indicated as \"Cornell 1910.\" Readers are particularly cautioned that, where the names of certain medical colleges have undergone change, the name is herein used as it was on the date of the physician's graduation. Examples follow: LIC Hosp— To and including 1930 NY Univ— To and including 1898 LIC Med— 1931 to date Bellevue— To and including 1898 NY Horn— To and including 1935 Univ & Bell— 1899 to 1934, inclusive Abbreviations are used for membership in medical societies other than the County and State Medical Societies and the American Medical Association, membership in which is indicated by the Symbol * preceding the name. When the abbreviation indicating the field of medicine in which the society concerns itself stands alone, it signifies that it is a local society; e.g., in Buffalo listings the Buffalo Surgical Society is indicated as \"Surg\" only. Abbreviations designate a physician's official title and department in the hospital with the word \"attending (or visiting)\" omitted; e.g., an Attending Dermatologist at Post-Graduate Hospital is indicated as \"Derm P-G\", and an Assistant Attending Dermatologist as \"Asst Derm P-G.\" The official title \"Cons\", however, is one exception where the word \"attending (or visiting)\" is not implied; e.g., \"Cons Path\" should be read as \"Consultant in Pathology\", or \"Consulting Pathologist.\" NY Med— 1936 to date NY Univ— 1935 to date MEDICAL SOCIETIES MEDICAL STAFF APPOINTMENTS IN HOSPITALS OTHER ABBREVIATIONS USED Abdom — Abdominal Ac — Academy Actg- — Acting Adj — Adjunct Admlnis — Administration Admit — Admitting Alien — Alienist Am — American Anat — Anatomy Anest — Anesthesia Arthrit — Arthritis Asso— Associate Asst — Assistant Aux — Auxiliary Bact — Bacteriology Bell — Bellevue Biochem — Biochemistry Bronchos — Bronchoscopy Cardiog — Cardiography Cardiol — Cardiology Cath — Catherine Chem — Chemistry Clim — Climatological Clin— Clinical Col — Columbus Com — Community Commnnic — Communicable Commr — Commissioner Cong — Congress Cons — Consulting Cran — Cranial Cumber — Cumberland Def — Deficiency Dep— Deputy Derm — Dermatology Diabet — Diabetes Dir — Director Bis — Disease Bisp — Dispensary Down — Downtown Eel — Eclectic Eliz— Elizabeth Encephalog — Encephalog ta Endocrin — Endrocrinology Endoscop— Endoscopy Epidem — Epidemiological Esoph — Esophagological Evang — Evangelical Exam — Examining Exp — Experimental Pac — Facility Ped — Federal Pord — Fordham G-U — Genito-Urinary Gastroent — Gastroenterology Gastro-Int — G astro-Intestinal Gouver — Gouverneur Gyn — Gynecology Hematol — Hematology Horn — Homeopathy Hon — Hono rary Hosp — Hospital Inf — Infant, Infirmary Immac — Immaculate Immunol — Immunology Inst — Institute Int — Intern, Internal Isl— Island Invest — Investigative Lab— Laboratory Laryn — Lary n go logy £IC — Long Island College of Oncol — Oncology OPD — Outpatient Department Ophth — Ophthalmology Orth — Orthopedics Otol — Otology Otolaryn — Otolaryngology P-G — Post-Graduate Path — Pathology Ped— Pediatrics Phthisiol — Phthisiology Phys — Physician Phys Med — Physical Medicine Physiol — Physiology Poly — Polyclinic Presby — Presbyterian Proct^— Proctology Psychiat — Psychiatry Badiat — Radiation Radiog — Radiography Badiol — Radiology Reconstruct — Reconstructive Beg- — Regional Bes — Resident, Research Rheum — Rheumatic or Rheum- atism Rhino — Rhinology Roent — Roentgenology Sam — Samaritan Sec — Secretions Serol — Serology Skel — Skeletal Soc — Society Spec — Special Sup — Supervising Supt — Superintendent Surg' — Surgery Syden — Sydenham Syph — Sy philology Transfus — Transfusion Tram — Traumatic Tuberc — Tuberculosis Univ— University Medicine, and Hospital Iiin — Lincoln I, nth — Lutheran Malig — Malignant Mat — Maternity Med — Medicine Met — Metropolitan Metab — Metabolism Milit— Military Misericor — Misericordia Monte — Montefiore Munic — Municipal NA — North America Natl— National Neur — Neurology Neuropsychiat — Neuropsychia- try NYS — New York State Obst — Obstetrics ABBREVIATIONS Key to Symbols * Member of County and State Medical Societies, and the American Medical Association (preceding name) x County Health Officers (following name) o Qualified under the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York State (preceding name — See Code Letters below) Key to Abbreviations DIPLOMATES AND LICENTIATES Certification by American Boards in Medical Specialties D-OS — Diplomate American Board of Orth paedic Surgery.

PREFACE, IN this, THE forty-second edition of the Medical Directory of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, are listed the names of physicians who have registered their licenses to practice medicine with the various County Clerks in the three adjoining states, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. It is published by the Medical Society if the State of New York but the State Medical Societies of New Jersey and of Con- i .ticut have contributed their share to its compilation. As of December 1, 1946, the total numbers of medical practitioners listed in this Directory are, as follows: State of New York 26,734 Greater New York 17,089 Borough of Bronx 2,098 Borough of Brooklyn < 4,532 Borougrh of Manhattan 8,194 Borough of Queens 2,064 Borough of Blchmond 201 State exclusive of Greater New York 9,645 State of New Jersey 5,655 State of Connecticut , 2,632 — This Directory lists these physicians with special reference to the following professional ita: Location by towns Qualifications for general and special work under the Workmen's Compensation Act of Name and address New York State Office hours and telephone Membership in Medical Societies, national, state and local Medical school and year of graduat.on Fellowship in the American Colleges of Al- Certiflcation by American Boards in Medical lergists, of Physicians, of Chest Physicians, Specialties of Radiology, and of Surgeons Qualified Psychiatrists certified by New York Medical staff appointments in voluntary, state, State Department of Mental Hygiene and municipal hospitals (official titles) The membership of the three State Medical Societies is as follows: Medical Society of the State of New York 20,552 The Medical Society of New Jersey 4,459 The Connecticut State Medical Society 2,152 Any information desired may be obtained through the three State Medical Society offices: MEDICAL SOCIETY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK 292 Madison Avenue, New York 17, W. P. Anderton, M. D., Secretary THE MEDICAL SOCIETY OF NEW JERSEY 315 West State Street, Trenton 8, Edith L. Madden, Acting Executive Officer THE CONNECTICUT STATE MEDICAL SOCIETY 8 Church Street, (P. O. Box ll\"s), New Haven 10, Creiohton Barker, M. D., Executive Secretary FOREWORD The Medical Society of the State of New York presents this new Medical Direc- tory of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for your approval, with the hope that you will find it useful. Five years have passed since the last medical directory was printed. Many changes have occurred during the war years, and during the subsequent return of the Army, Navy and Public Health Service physicians to civilian life. Approximately one-half of the doctors in our files have changed their addresses, two thousand post office returns reveal physicians who have not yet located, medical societies and hospitals have changed their names, hospital staffs have been com- pletely reorganized, some hospitals have closed. And all of these changes have been reflected in the doctors' biographical data. Our compilation staff has worked ten months recording these changes^whicfc have occurred among 35,000 physicians. It has been a difficult task to pick up the threads after five years. Although every doctor's hospital appointments have been faithfully compared with lists supplied by the institutions, inability to secure proper source information has prevented checking membership of American Boards and Colleges and national and local medical societies. Please let us know if you discover errors, so we can correct them in the next edition. With this explanation we present the new medical directory for 1947.

Exclusively for ALCOHOLISM and DRUG ADDICTION We regard alcoholism and the varied drug habits, including barbiturism, as both physiological and psychological sick- nesses. Our treatment is a hospital procedure which elimi- nates craving by a method of detoxication and quickly restores normal body functions. Following this our psycho- logical approach to the problem has proven most successful. We have perfected the treatment of drug addiction over a period of forty years. It is now generally accepted as standard. It is completed within a definite period, at a fixed charge, and entails a minimum of discomfort. The patient is assured of absolute privacy. The hospital offers completely modernized facilities with cuisine and service of the highest standard. The special nature of our work enables us to eliminate the usual hospital atmosphere.

The Clifton Springs Sanitarium was founded in 1850 and has been in continuous operation for nearly 100 years, and offers its facilities to the American medical profession. The Clinic is general and maintains competent medical, surgical and laboratory staffs. Special facilities are available for the management of metabolic and cardio vascular disease, arthritis and the psychoneuroses. All types of general medical and surgical cases are received for diagnosis and treatment. Recognized forms of physiotherapy are provided and there is an adequate dietetic service. By virtue of its medical equipment and of its location the institution offers the combined advantages of a medical center and a rural Spa. Cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis, contagious disease, epilepsy, and insanity are not accepted. The facilities of the Sanitarium are also open to guests, who do not wish examination and medical care, but who come simply for the baths and massage, for rest and recreation.
