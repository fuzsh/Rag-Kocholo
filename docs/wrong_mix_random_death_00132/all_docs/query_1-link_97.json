        "text": "The image-paradigm of the Fire of God in the Bible and in the Christian tradition. In: Hierotopy of Light and Fire in the Culture of the Byzantine World, ed. Alexei Lidov, Moscow, Theoria, 2013, p. 45-81, 2013\n\nThe main themes of fire in the Bible can be united around the concept of the Fire of God. This is in the first place the fire of Judgement which burns out sin, but spares the righteous. Fire is naturally associated with the Divine because it causes a similar attitude: love mixed with fear. The image-paradigm of the Fire of God pervades the Christian tradition. It is associated in particular with liturgical fire. According to Dionisius Areopagite, fire is a visible image of ineffable Divine qualities. It is not only “God’s servant” but also the symbol of his eternal life and of the deification of man. The Fire of God is experienced by mystics as the “fire of love” which destroys the “otherness” of the soul and unites it with God. In the Byzantine iconography of the Theotokos of the Burning Bush, the Incarnation is presented as a fiery theophany where the Virgin receives the Fire of God within her human nature. The image of fire also has an important liturgical aspect: the Holy Communion in the Eastern Church is understood as partaking of the Fire of God. This is a 5-page English summary of a full paper published in Russian. The full paper contains a complete table of Biblical references to fire (around 400)"
