        "meta_description": "The Novum Testamentum Graece is the basis for nearly every modern Bible translation. Used by scholars, pastors, students and translators, the Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece is the standard and globally preeminent critical edition of the Greek New Testament editions. The twenty-eighth edition includes fundamental revisions for better clarity and usability. It now incorporates the text-critical insights of the Editio Critical Maior (ECM) of the Greek New Testament into the text of Catholic Epistles, representing the most recent scholarly research in establishing the Greek text. In addition, newly discovered Papyri 117–127 are listed for the first time, opening up interesting perspectives, particularly on the Acts of the Apostles. This resource includes both the text and the apparatus.",
