Federal Reserve Bank Statement 3057; Chronicle $2,516,000 to $97,263,000; an increase of foreign bank deposits by $7,897,000 to $103,914,000, and an increase of non-member bank deposits by $7,733,000 to $181,699,000. The reserve ratio fell to 79.6% from 79.7%. Discounts by the System increased $5,836,000 to $16,835,000, which is the only real reflection of the added reserve requirement effect, Industrial advances dipped $326,000 to $22,854,000. Bankers' bills bought in the open market fell $4,000 to $3,739,000, while holdings of United States government securities increased $50,000 to $2,526,290,000. < . j l Foreign Trade in March F^ACH month's report of the country's foreign «L-i trade, so far this year, has leaned more heavily to the import side, and the excess over exports in March amounted to $50,309,000, which brought the unfavorable balance for the year to Mar. 31 to $113,- 959,000. This placing of dollar balances in the hands of foreigners, according to opinion expressed recently by the Secretary of Agriculture, will result in larger exports from the United States; but it is also possible that instead such funds may find their way into the American investment market. Exports and imports both rose about 10% over February, which is the usual seasonal gain; how- B ASKINGfinal statistics thisofweek cover the period ever, view ofthis the year fact that February tradeCoast was increase requirements, more in excessive because the West of the and far so banks ther are reserve these important as demands on member concerned it is to be presumed that fur- changes are unlikely for a long time to come, The increase of requirements since last summer is 100%, effected by stages. increase took effect Just before the final May 1, excess reserves over on requirements were estimated at $1,640,000,000. added The requirements wiped out $700,000,000 of that figure, while an increase of currency in circulation and other factors reduced the excess reserves by a further $50,000,000, calculated still be so considered credit control moreover, that the excess on May 5 was $890,000,000. at a This huge total must potential standpoint. danger, from the It is necessary to note, that so large an aggregate remains, de- spite the insulation of the credit system from the effects of the continued large acquisition of gold, The inactive gold fund of the United States Treas- exceeds $600,000,000, all of which has been accumulated in less than five months.

Gold banks are reported at $8,842,902,000 on May 5, down $500,000 for the week. Total reserves fell more sharply, owing to demands for the circulating medium, and the aggregate is $9,132,478,000', down $9,655,000. Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation moved up $30,732,000 to $4,207,722,000. Aggregate deposits with the 12 banks fell $33,308,000 to $7,265,238,000, with the account variations consisting of a decline of member bank balances by $51,454,000 to $6,882,362,000; an increase of the Treasury general account balance by certificate holdings of the 12 Federal Reserve maritime strike, which after three months' duration, ended Feb. 4, the rise in March may be said to betoken a more than seasonal gain. As compared with a year ago, exports were 31% higher, and imports no less than 54% higher. Import gains have far outdistanced export increases, with the result that the former are now not so far removed from pre-depression levels while the latter are still far away from such heights. Exports in March totaled In February, when the import balance was $45,203,000, exports were $232,503,000 and imports $277,706,000. In March, 1936, exports amounted to $195,113,000 and imports to $198,701,000, which left an unfavorable balance of $3,588,000. Looking back to March, 1929, shows exports at $489,851,000, somewhat less than double the present month, and imports at $383,818,000, 25% larger than the current March, Two groups of exports, metals and manufactures, and machinery and vehicles, registered over 60% of the gain in the total over last year. The first group is comprised entirely of iron and steel products and copper. In the machinery and vehicles group, most of the gain was in products of the automobile industry; aircraft shipments, although not large, were 100% greater than a year ago. Wood and paper exports also showed a sizable gain. Unmanufactured cotton exports were higher than a year ago and were also higher than in February last, but did not approach the larger shipments of last January, In March, 1937, they amounted to 497,132 bales, valued at $34,271,765, and in February, 480,468 bales worth $34,066,000. In March, 1936, 419,916 bales, with a value of $26,322,214, were shipped. Imports in all commodity groups were higher than in March, 1936, partly the result of increased prices. The greatest gain was in vegetable food products, which were $30,000,000 higher. In this group corn imports were $4,810,000 compared with only $410,000 last year, and feed and fodder $2,414,000 compared with $494,000 last year—re- $256,390,000 and imports $306,699,000. 3058 Financial suits of last year's drought. heavy increases Other groups showing textile were fibers and manufac¬ Chronicle issues Gold continued, with buying elsewhere In listed the continues to flow to these shores in large turbance government The March periods of 1935 same imports $154,371,000 were securities larger gains. of the previous months, $346,000 and and in February Exports of was $8,115,000 metal in only were with $611,000 in compare in in comparison and the as Silver account. no of $5,589,000 amount 1936. of were $14,080,000 March, Exports of the metal, a year ago.
