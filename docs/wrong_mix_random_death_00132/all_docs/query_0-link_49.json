The Admirals are armed with two twin 6\"/50 BL Mk.XXII and eight quad 2-pounder pom-poms; they are expected to carry 24 planes. Anson is the second purpose-built carrier of the Royal Navy.\n\nJanuary 21st, 1924: Lenin dies; Kamenev takes over his post on the Council of Labour and Defense, but Trotsky's ally Preobrazhensky takes over Sovnarkom instead of Rykov (Lenin's deputy in Sovnarkom).\n\nMarch 21st, 1924: Anna May Wong Productions is founded by the popular film star and the investor Sid Grauman, just three days after Wong's second success, The Thief of Baghdad, was released.

Sackett, Republican candidate for Senate in Kentucky and self-proclaimed anti-prohibitionist, is revealed; this causes the Anti-Saloon League to withdraw its endorsement, and will ultimately cost Sackett the election.\n\nOctober 29th, 1924: Frederick Fox Riley, defeating Liberal Robert Strother Stewart and Tory Harold MacMillan, is one of the 154 Labour Party MPs elected in 1924 - not enough to preserve the minority government that had been in place since January, but more than enough to displace the Liberals as the chief rival to the Conservatives.\n\nNovember 5th, 1924: President Harding is reelected in a landslide over Democratic candidate Al Smith of New York. In elections for the Senate, Democrat James Tunnell defeats incumbent Republican L. Heisler Ball (R-DE) and independent T. Coleman Du Pont, Alva Adams, appointed to fill Republican Samuel D. Nicholson's seat in 1923, unseats incumbent Republican Lawrence C. Phipps (R-CO) - though Republican Rice W. Means wins the special election to fill Adams' old seat, Samuel G. Bratton unseats Holm Bursum (R-NM), who had been appointed to fill Albert Fall's seat, and William Chilton narrowly beats Guy D. Goff, the Republican nominee to replace retiring Senator Davis Elkins (R-WV). Magnus Johnson (FL-MN) narrowly holds his seat, though Republican William Pine crushes Democrat John Walton in the race to replace retiring Senator Robert L. Owen (D-OK) and Republican Frederick Gillett unseats Democrat David Walsh in Calvin Coolidge's home state of Massachusetts. The end result is that the Republicans hold just 48 seats, as many as the Democrats and the Farmer-Labor Party combined. Only Coolidge's re-election as vice-president, and the occasional support of progressive Democrats and the two Farmor-Labor Party Senators, allows the GOP to maintain control of the Senate. In the House, however, the Republicans made gains, winning fifteen seats.\n\nDecember 3, 1924: Fourteen naval mines are stolen from a former Austro-Hungarian depot in Dalmatia; in a week, they will be sold to the Republic of the Rif.\n\n1925:\n\nJanuary 19, 1925: The Xinjiangese Islamic Revolution occurs.

Torrio is tiped off however, and is waiting for them. Weiss and Moran are both killed in a hail of gunfire, throwing the North Side into chaos.\n\nFebruary 5, 1925: Benjamin Cardozo, Associate Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, is confirmed as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by the Senate, replacing Joseph McKenna (who had resigned due to ill health). As a well-respected Democrat, he was thought likely to be able to get past the Senate.\n\nFebruary 18th, 1925: Bukharin's Right Opposition and Kamenev's Center Movement successfully oust Preobrazhensky from Sovnarkom; Zinoviev, Kamenev's most loyal ally, replaces him.\n\nFebruary 25th, 1925: \"The Call of Cthulhu\" is written by Liu Hui Wen in Shanghai, China.\n\nMarch 4th, 1925: Trotsky resigns from the position of General Secretary, unable to cope with the workload; he cites a desire to refocus attention on reforming and modernizing the Red Army, and proposes that his protege Georgy Pyatakov, deputy chair of Gosplan, take over the post of General Secretary.\n\nMarch 11th, 1925: The Bush family moves to New York City, New York, so that Prescott, as VP of A.

Relations between Britain and Italy (and between Albania and Italy) turn sour.\n\nJune 12, 1925: Chittaranjan Das recovers from his illness and resumes his position as mayor of Calcutta.\n\nJune 15, 1925: The Argentine navy orders a cruiser-carrier from Fore River Shipbuilding Company to match the Chilean aircraft carrier; bids from Vickers Shipbuilding and Arsenal de Brest proved too expensive for the frugal President Alvear, despite desires by some to buy British.\n\nJuly 11, 1925: Basileus Konstantinos, a Bretagne-class battleship laid down for the Greek Navy back in 1914, finally launches.\n\nAugust 3, 1925: Peljidiin Genden, President of the People's Republic of Mongolia, forces Khorloogiin Choibalsan, a supporter of Joseph Stalin, into exile in Canada.\n\nAugust 19th, 1925: Arthur Nixon is still completely fine.\n\nSeptember 11, 1925: After a storm front finally lifts, General Miguel Primo de Rivera begins an amphibious landing at Alhucemas Bay. The landing had been planned for the 7th, and word had leaked; as such, Rifian defenses, although primarily focused on the wrong beaches, were able to cause somewhat high casualties. A naval mine sank the destroyer Velasco, killing her entire 86-man crew, while Rifian machine-gun nests and artillery killed an additional 109 and wounded 511. Nonetheless, Rivera's skillful use of combined arms, including naval gunnery, aircraft, a single rigid airship, and FT-17 tanks, allowed 13,000 troops to be landed in the space of two days.\n\nOctober 1st, 1925: German negotiators successfully chip away at the naval limitations imposed on the Reichsmarine by the Treaty of Versailles. Germany was now granted the right to field six heavy cruisers (with armament of up to 12\" (304.8mm)) of up to 12000t displacement, eight light cruisers of up to 6000t displacement, 18 destroyers of up to 800t displacement, and 20 torpedo boats.\n\nOctober 15th, 1925: On a clear day in Pittsburgh, Washington Senators ace pitcher Walter Johnson wins Game 7 of the World Series, 6-3.\n\nOctober 19, 1925: Primo de Rivera finishes consolidating the region of Alhucemas Bay, clearing the last heights held by the Republic of the Rif.\n\nNovember 8, 1925: Giuseppe Zangara, a bricklayer and recent immigrant from Italy, dies after an accident at a construction site in New Jersey.\n\nDecember 9th, 1925: Mulan, Maid of China, the first film by Anna May Wong Productions, is released, and proves wildly successful.\n\n1926:\n\nJanuary 3, 1926: Founding of རེཨེདོམ་རོཨུཔ་(Tibetans for Democracy). Anil Shamar, an American-educated Tibetan merchant, founds Tibetans for Democracy, a republican group.

As such, Pancho Villa begins raising funds for a campaign against Calles, including oil company executives unhappy with Calles's policy on Mexican oil, Catholic reactionaries, friends made in Hollywood, and even Aimee Semple McPherson's Angelus Temple.\n\nNovember 3rd, 1926: Nellie Tayloe Ross, a progressive 'dry' Democrat, is narrowly re-elected as governor of Wyoming, defeating Republican Frank Emerson; the same day, corrupt 'wet' Democrat Ma Ferguson, having won a bruising primary fight earlier in the year, is re-elected governor of Texas.\n\nNovember 8, 1926: Benito Mussolini is present at the commissioning of the first Italian battleship of the Vittorio Veneto class.

Her main battery of 12\" Mle 1909 twin-mounts would be replaced with 340mm/45-caliber Mle 1912 twin mounts, while her secondary battery of 9.4\" twin mounts would be replaced with modern, faster-firing 8\"/50 Mle 1924 twin mounts and her flak belt would be modernized.\n\nDecember 21st, 1926: French ace René Fonck wins the Orteig Prize, flying a Keystone K-47A Pathfinder biplane from Roosevelt Airfield in New York to Paris Le Bourget, accompanied by navigator Charles Clavier.\n\nDecember 25th, 1926: A general strike in Cologne turns into a riot as local police are goaded into brutality.\n\nDecember 26, 1926: Rioters, strikers, and various other malcontents hole up in the main building of the University of Cologne.

She displaces 27000t, is powered by turbine engines, and can travel up to 26 knots. Her only remaining sister, Languedoc, was in danger of being canceled back in August 1925, but the naval threat from Italy forced PM Herriot to restore funds for the ship; she's expected to commission in about 18 months.\n\nApril 5, 1927: Deutschland, the first new German large cruiser, launches from her slip at the Deutsche Werke shipyards in Kiel. She is ostensibly a 12000t cruiser, though the actual displacement will likely be higher; nonetheless, it will be consistently reported as 12000t. Deutschland will mount similar armament to the British County-class large cruisers under construction, but will have lighter armor. Armament is planned to consist of a main battery of two triple 12\"/56-caliber SK C/27 mounts, a secondary battery of three triple 5.9\"/60 SK C/25 mounts, six of the planned 4.1\"/65 SK C/29 AA mounts, eight 37mm cannon and ten 20mm cannon, along with two triple mounts for 21\" torpedoes. Speed is projected to be 34 knots.

The Chinese Communist Party seizes control of Nanchang; much to the surprise of the Nationalists, the workers in the city also rise up and join the communists. Zhou Enlai takes over political leadership of the city, while Zhu De is given command of the nascent People's Liberation Army. Over the next few days, the city is besieged by Chiang Kai'shek, who is unable to defeat the PLA. However, the city has few supplies, and quickly runs out of food.

This division in the opposition was largely why the policy was able to pass.\n\nOctober 7, 1928: Shanty Hogan wins Game 3 of the 1928 World Series in the Polo Grounds in dramatic fashion, hitting a walk-off grand slam off Yankees pitcher Tom Zachary. It would be the New York Giants' only win of the Series.\n\nOctober 11, 1928: Juan Trippe, CEO of Pan American Airways, buys 10 Keystone-Loening K-66 Air Yacht twin-engine nine-seat flying boats.

However, the comfortable Republican House majority passed the bill.\n\nMay 19, 1929: A protest outside the Excelsior movie theater in Tananarive, Madagascar against policies discriminating against the Malagasy fizzles, even though it was held on a public holiday and during a strike by medical school students. The nationalists and Communists who had planned the protest had intended for French Communist Edouard Planque to enter the theater with a dog, then to begin their protest, shouting that the French were discriminatory in favor of dogs over Malagasy; Planque failed to show, having accidentally slept in, and a rainstorm led to significantly reduced turnout.\n\nMay 20, 1929: Despite calls for reprisals from some of the more reactionary colons, including the head of the Ligue des Interets Economiques de Madagascar, Governor-General Marcel Olivier ignores the protest. A few prominent loudmouths are briefly detained, but nothing much comes of it, particularly since the strike - and thus the best opportunity for the nationalists - blows over by the end of the week.\n\nAlso on this day, the British aviation company Blackburn establishes an American subsidiary with General Motors, the Blackburn Aircraft Company, 90% owned by GM and 10% owned by Blackburn.

In Birmingham, West Austen Chamberlain scrapes through with a majority of 31 in a straight fight with Labour because enough Liberals voted for him because of his internationalist, pro League of Nations foreign policy.\n\nMay 31, 1929: Stanley Baldwin resigns and Ramsay Macdonald becomes Prime Minister.

At 2.65 tons, the L3/28 is a very light vehicle; it is also rather inexpensive, allowing Mussolini to expand his army rapidly.\n\nAugust 8, 1929: In the Twickenham by-election caused by the elevation of William Joynson-Hicks to the peerage as Viscount Brentford, Labour gains the seat from the Conservatives by a majority of 242.\n\nAugust 9, 1929: The dissatisfaction with Baldwin in the Conservative Party after its defeat in the general election, receives a boost after the Twickenham by-election with the start of a Baldwin Must Go (BMG) campaign orchestrated in the Beaverbrook and Rothermere press.\n\nAugust 27, 1929: Bessie Coleman wins the First Women's Air Derby, beating such rivals as Amelia Earhart, Florence 'Pancho' Barnes, Louise Thaden, and Thea Rasche to Cleveland.

In those days Conservative leaders were not elected, rather they 'emerged' after consultations with Conservatives in Parliament and in the country. Amery is a leading tariff reformer and is strongly committed to the cause of Imperial preference. Chamberlain supports protection but without the ideological intensity of Amery. While Chamberlain has the support of most of the shadow cabinet and the liberal wing of the party, Amery is supported by the bulk of the party who want tariff reform, and by the Beaverbrook and Rothermere press.\n\nSeptember 14, 1929: Senate President Borah, despite his own personal opposition, can do nothing but sit and watch as the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act, by now incorporating agricultural tariffs as well (in spite of McNary-Haughton already providing agricultural supports), is passed after a few months of horse-trading among Senators and speeches by anti-tariff Democrats. By the end of the month, the House and Senate bills are reconciled, and Hoover, despite personally opposing the bill, signs it, hoping to gain political advantage.\n\nSeptember 19, 1929: John Davidson, the Chairman of the Conservative Party organisation, announces that the bulk of the Conservative Party in Parliament and the country want Leopold Amery to be the leader of the party.

Yrigoyen can travel up to 30 knots, and is considered by the Argentines to be more than a match for the Chilean navy's carrier.\n\nNovember 20, 1929: After a meeting of the shadow cabinet, Leopold Amery, the leader of the Conservative party, announces its commitment to a protectionist policy of imperial preference with tariffs on food imports from outside the British Empire.\n\nNovember 21, 1929: Austen Chamberlain and Winston Churchill resign from the shadow cabinet because of their opposition to its new trade policy.\n\nAlso on this day, the German Third Cavalry Division, led by Gerd von Rundstedt and supported by Ernst Rohm's Sturmabteilung and the Jungdeutscher Ordern - but not by the NVB - seize the railway lines, telegraph stations, and other key facilities in Berlin, Dortmund, Hamburg and Koenigsberg, staging a coup d'etat. The coup is backed by a number of colonels and lesser officers, and the First and Third Infantry Divisions see half their combat strength turned traitor. Rundstedt plans to name Werner von Blomberg President of Germany and impose a quasi-fascist military regime, but Blomberg, knowing that Rundstedt does not have complete control over the military, demurs.\n\nNovember 22, 1929: Blomberg rejects Rundstedt's offer, as do other leading officers and a variety of nationalists, but Werner Freiherr von Fritsch accepts the offer of President of Germany. Rundstedt apparently was unwilling to accept the presidency himself. Admiral Hans Zenker, commander of the Reichsmarine, formally denounces the coup, and begins planning to retake Koenigsberg and Hamburg; his fleet largely remains loyal, and the few traitorous officers are detained quickly. German Communists and Socialists call for new general strikes, hoping to end the coup the way that the Kapp Putsch fell apart; the Communists also plan to use force to help defeat the plot. The NVB declares that it was not involved in planning the coup; leadership refuse to commit to supporting or opposing it.\n\nNovember 23, 1929: Deutschland arrives in Hamburg from Kiel, escorted by two destroyers and six torpedo boats; the large cruiser's twelve-inch guns provide fire support for loyalist First Infantry Division troops, backed by local left-wing paramilitary organizations, particularly the Rotfrontkampferbund (Red Front Fighters' League).

It has 28 Conservative MPs and 41 Conservative Peers. Baldwin, now a backbencher, does not join the new party.\n\nJanuary 19, 1930: Shanghai Story, starring Anna May Wong, Richard Loo and Charles Bickford, is released.

She was the last Myoko-class cruiser, though she was a bit larger and longer than her three sisters, displacing 15,200t instead of 13,700t and having a length of 209m instead of 205m, allowing her to carry a second floatplane and an improved torpedo bulkhead system. Ashigara was relatively mid-sized for a cruiser, armed with three triple 10\"/48 mounts, eight single 4.7\"/45 AA mounts, two twin 13mm AA machine guns, and four triple 610mm torpedo tubes.

The acting of Bela Lugosi in the protagonist role is given strong positive reviews.\n\nFebruary 21, 1931: Engineers Alexander P. de Seversky, Alexander Kartveli, and Michael Gregor, backed by investments from Edward Moore, Paul Moore and Prescott Bush, among others, found the Seversky Aircraft Corporation, with corporate headquarters in Farmingdale, Long Island.\n\nFebruary 27, 1931: Seversky purchases the struggling EDO Aircraft Company from founder and owner Earl Dodge Osborn.\n\nMarch 3, 1931: Attempted coup d'etat by Japanese ultranationalists succeeds; Kazushige Ugaki becomes prime minster.

M, while generally staying true to Lang's original idea, has one important change: the killer is not captured, and indeed kills the police detective who has been following him as the film's climax, then goes on to continue killing. This gives the film a massively more nihilistic tone. However, it is still wildly successful throughout Europe. M is widely recognized as a spiritual sibling to The Ninth Room on the Right, and though it lacks supernatural elements, is soon regarded a classic in film de terreur surnaturelle.\n\nMay 16, 1931: Ninth Room on the Right's leading actor, Bela Lugosi, wins an Academy Award for his part in the film.
