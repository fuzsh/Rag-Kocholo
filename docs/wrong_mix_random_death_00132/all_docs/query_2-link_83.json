        "text": "The Bible Today\n\n\"For professional students of the Bible who want a thorough explanation of and guide through the science of textual criticism, this is the book. Written by two scholars who themselves are synonymous with the best of modern textual criticism, this excellent work covers the whole range of issues.\"\n\nReligious Studies Review\n\n\"An authoritative introduction to New Testament textual criticism by two of Germany's preeminent textual scholars. Rhodes's translation...is commendably accurate and readable. The book will prove invaluable to beginning students for its overview of editions of the Greek New Testament from Erasmus to NA26, for its sketch of the first four centuries of textual transmission, and especially for its exhaustive explanation of the textual apparatuses found in today's popular editions. . . More advanced scholars will appreciate the book's informed survey of early versions and its detailed descriptions of all the important extant Greek manuscripts.\""
