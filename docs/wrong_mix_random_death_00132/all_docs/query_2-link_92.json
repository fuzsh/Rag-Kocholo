        "text": "If you plan on taking the family camping this summer, check out the current deals on family camping tents on Amazon.\n\nThere’s a lot to consider when buying a tent for a family trip, e.g., size, accessibility, material, frame type and more. The first step is to understand what your family needs, first, in terms of size and second, in terms of priorities.\n\nDo you need individual bedrooms and, if so, how many?\n\nDo you care more about high ceilings or more ventilation?\n\nWhat kind of weather do you plan to use it in?\n\nThe answers to these questions will help guide your purchase.\n\nOutdoor essentials\n\n$99.99 (save 38%) List Price: $160.00$160.00\n\n$38.50 (save 30%) List Price: $55.00\n\n$25.98 (save 35%) List Price: $39.95\n\n$29.59 (save 31%) List Price: $42.99\n\n$23.99 (save 20%) Typical price: $29.99\n\n$21.21 (save 39%) List Price: $34.98\n\n$16.96 (save 11%) Typical price: $19.15\n\n$42.49 (save 15%) List Price: $49.99\n\n$167.99 (save 16%) List Price $199.99\n\nDiscover how a budget-friendly camping getaway can offer quality family time in the great outdoors\n\nFamily tent options\n\nThe most common you’ve probably seen is the dome tent, which basically has two malleable tent poles that run through the middle and provide structure for the tent, while creating its shape. These are easy to set up, come in variable sizes and provide plenty of room, but could be impacted by wind.\n\nLarger-sized dome tents are an option, but you can also look for multi-room tents specifically designed for families. Multi-room tents will offer divided spaces allowing for privacy or storage space. With these tents, you’ll have the same risk of being adversely affected by wind, and tents this size are typically not as easy to assemble and transport, but you can still find some great ones for their price.\n\nColeman Montana\n\nThe Coleman Montana, a dome tent built to hold 6-8 people, weighs about 20 pounds and is currently 44% off on Amazon for $149.99. For that price, you’re getting a ton of value, including angled windows to keep rain out, awnings for increased weather protection, ports for extension cords and hinged doors.\n\nMost reviews report that it’s very easy to assemble and fits two full-queen-sized air mattresses when fully set up. Again, you’re getting a lot for the price.\n\nPORTAL 10-Person Camping Tent with Porch\n\nIf that doesn’t sound like enough room for your group, the 10-person camping tent by Portal is another great bang-for-your-buck option. Featuring a covered porch, large space with dividers for two rooms and a mesh ceiling for excellent air ventilation, this tent is currently listed at $259.00 with a $15 off coupon.\n\nThe polyester body is designed to prevent water seepage and even with its massive size, is still relatively easy to set up according to reviewers. This is a great option for large families.\n\nIf you’re not planning on traveling with the family, smaller, portable tents may be a better fit. A-frame tents are also relatively easy to set up and easy to transport with their lightweight frame.\n\nIf easy to transport is your highest priority, you can also check out backpack tents (the name is self-explanatory), car roof-top tents or teepee tents (with a high ceiling but only requiring 1 single rod running through).\n\nIf you’re traveling solo, air tents (the frame is made up of inflatable beams) are easier to set up for one person, but are heavier to transport due to needing an air pump.\n\nXLTTYWL Inflatable Camping Tent\n\nThe next item isn’t necessarily for large families as it is designed for four people, but it is another great option with a more homey feeling. The four-season inflatable luxury camping tent is one of a kind in that you need a pump to inflate it, but is otherwise an easy set up that leaves you with high ceilings, overhanging rope for lights, and mesh windows and doors with protection from the elements.\n\nWith plenty of space for inflatable mattresses or furniture, it’s easy to create a home like feel with this tent.
