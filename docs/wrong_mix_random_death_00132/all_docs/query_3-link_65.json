The Text of the New Testament: An Introduction to the Critical Editions and to the Theory and Practice of Modern Textual Criticism, 2d ed., rev. and enl., trans. Errol1 F. Rhodes. Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1989. xviii + 366 pp. $32.50. Since the original edition of this book in both English and German has been extensively reviewed, this review will primarily summarize the main reactions to the earlier edition and attempt to assess whether the revised edition succeeds in overcoming its weaknesses. T o call this edition \"revised and enlarged\" is an overstatement. While the revisions are many, they are largely limited to details of wording. The only substantial additions are a brief discussion of the recent synopses of the Gospels by Orchard, Boismard/Lamouille, and Swanson (pp. 263-265) and chap. 8 (pp. 317-337), which is essentially a paper read by Barbara Aland at a 1987 conference in Birmingham on textual criticism. NT textual criticism is both an art and a science. The consensus in reviews of the original edition is that the Alands' book has made a tre- mendous contribution to the science of NT textual criticism but is seriously flawed in attempting to describe its art. (The reader will appreciate the summary of issues and the citation of reviews provided in the article by Eldon Jay Epp, \"New Testament Criticism Past, Present, and Future: Reflec- tions on the Alands' Text of the New Testament,\" HTR 82 [1989]: 213-229.) Among the strengths of both editions are the descriptive lists of papyri, uncials, many minuscules, and the church fathers; the introductions to the use of the critical editions edited by Kurt Aland; and the listing of working tools for the practice of N T textual criticism. Reviewers have considered these usable, reliable, and to some degree indispensable for work in the discipline. By themselves these scientific achievements are worth the price of either edition. The main criticisms of the original edition can be grouped into four general areas. (1) There is a perceived arrogance on the part of the authors, resulting in what has been called a \"revisionist history\" of the development of NT textual criticism-a history calculated to highlight the work of the Alands and their institute at the expense of other contributions to their discipline. In particular, the work of British and American text-critical scholars is disparaged or ignored. (2) There is a circularity of reasoning by which manuscripts are evaluated on the basis of an assumed \"original text\" (apparently the critical text produced by the Miinster Institute), although\n\n74 SEMINARY STUDIES the exact procedure is unclear. The traditional text types are, as a result, replaced by two systems of categorization that are neither self-consisten t nor clearly explained. (3) In a book intended for the use of beginners, there is a remarkable lack of basic explanation and pedagogical skill. (4) There is a failure both to clarify the theoretical principles which underlie text-critical decision-making and to give the novice some inkling that there are other methods by which text-critical scholars make such decisions. Apparently the Alands read and considered the reviews of their earlier edition. The \"outrageous untruth\" regarding the International Greek New Testament Project, pointed out by Birdsall, has been corrected as called for, although without apology (J. Neville Birdsall, BT 39 [1988]: 340; cf. Aland and Aland, rev. ed., p. 24. It could be argued, of course, that the Alands would have corrected it anyway.) More significantly perhaps, the revision eliminates an incorrect statement about Greeven's synopsis that only a determined critic like Elliott would have discovered (J. Keith Elliott, TZ 39 [1983]: 248; cf. Aland and Aland, rev. ed., pp. 260-263.) How well does the revision address the four issues summarized above? A multitude of minor changes certainly could indicate a concern to eliminate or modify both self-important assertions and unnecessarily derogatory re- marks about other efforts in the field. T o cite some examples: The use of \"standard text\" to refer to Nestle-Aland26is consistently changed to \"new text\"; the derogatory remark about the International Greek New Testament Project is dropped (p. 24); instead of \"textual critics\" ignoring the role of church history in textual study, \"many NT scholars\" do so (p. 52); the \"Caesarean text\" is based on an \"uncertain\" foundation rather than a \"dubious\" one (pp. 66-67); other editions of the Greek NT are granted a level of importance (pp. 222-223);and \"this is helpful\" is added to highlight an aspect of Greeven's synopsis (p. 261). In spite of numerous changes of detail, however, the chapter on the history of textual criticism remains essentially unchanged, and British and American authors fare little better than in the original. Thus the fundamental objection to the first edition has not been dealt with satisfactorily in the revision. In the second place, the danger of circular reasoning remains in the re- vision, although chap. 8 argues with considerable cogency that the Alands' approach is an improvement upon its alternatives as a meaningful evalua- tion of the huge mass of NT manuscripts. (Still, the lack of a description and critique of alternatives, such as the Claremont Profile Method, continues to be a weakness.) The circularity arises from the fact that manuscripts are considered to be of high textual quality to the extent that they read like the text of Nestle-AlandZ6,which to a large degree was determined on the basis of judgments regarding textual quality. But the danger is considerably alleviated by two factors: (1) collations are made according to test passages in which the original reading is reasonably self-evident, at least on the basis of the Alands' \"local-genealogical\" method; (2) these test passages are fully"
