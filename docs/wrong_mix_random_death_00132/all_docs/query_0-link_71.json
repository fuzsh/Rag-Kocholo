        "text": "Conventional approaches to the Synoptic gospels argue that the gospel authors acted as literate spokespersons for their religious communities. Whether described as documenting intragroup \"oral traditions\" or preserving the collective perspectives of their fellow Christ-followers, these writers are treated as something akin to the Romantic Poets speaking for their Volk-a questionable framework inherited from nineteenth-century German Romanticism. In this book, Robyn Walsh argues that the Synoptic gospels were written by elite cultural producers working within a dynamic cadre of literate specialists, including persons who may or may not have been professed Christians. Comparing a range of ancient literature, her groundbreaking study demonstrates that the gospels are creative works produced by educated elites interested in Judean teachings, practices, and paradoxographical subjects in the aftermath of the Jewish War and in dialogue with the literature of their age. Walsh's study thus bridges the artificial divide between research on the Synoptic gospels and classics.\n\nRecent gospels scholarship has problematized oversimplified conceptions of the antique circulation of texts by drawing attention to such phenomena as accidental publication, postpublication revision, and de-publication. In this presentation, I further complicate antique circulation practices with instances of misattribution, uncontrolled textualization, limited circulation, partial publication, textual suppression, and texts that are not composed “for publication” (πρὸς ἔκδοσιν). I modulate Raymond J. Starr’s influential “concentric circles” model of the circulation or Roman literature in order to demonstrate that, like their Greco-Roman counterparts, the circulation of early Christian gospels was complex and socially constructed. The complexity of ancient publication and circulation informs the canonical gospels. I argue that the gospels were not all released or circulated in identical ways. Nor were they distributed in the same physical medium. Rather, the gospels circulated in varying ways and physical forms. Mark was written as a set of notes that was initially offered for limited circulation. As such, its native medium was the codex. Matthew, as a book composed for synagogue reading, modulated Mark’s medium and created a new composition that circulated amongst early Christian networks. Luke likewise transformed the notes that Mark handed over into a composition. Writing for Theophilus as their initial reader, the author of Luke anticipated that the narrative would reach a wider audience. As texts that literaturize their predecessor, the natural medium for Matthew and Luke was a bookroll."
