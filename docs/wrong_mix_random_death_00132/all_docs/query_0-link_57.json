W e cannot, of course, furnish them to-day, bank clearings being made np by the various clearing houses at noon on Saturday, and hence in the above the last twenty-four hours of the week have to be in all cases eetimated, as we go to press Friday night. We present below our usual detailed figures for the pre­ vious week, covering the returns for the period ending with Saturday noon, Jone 10, and the results for the corresponding week in 1898, 1897 and 1898 are also given. In comparison with the preceding week there is an increase in the aggre­ gate exchanges of one hundred and twenty two million dollars, the gain at New York being eighty five millions. Contrasted with the week of 1898 the total for the whole oountry shows an increase of SI’S per oent. Compared with the week of 1897 the current returns record a gain of 80 3 per oent, and the excess over 1890 is 73’ 1 per cent. Outside of New York the increase over 1898 is 19’9 per oent. The excess over 1897 resehee 88’5 per cent, and making comparison with 1896 the gain is seen to be 41'0 oer cent. 1899. # f N ew Y o r k .............. 1.039 203,501 7H.-42i.2aJ 22.6->4,02* 82.799.9Ci 6.155,600 B u ffa lo .............. . 2.701,0 !•: 2.(H4.*S* 1,125.

THE FIN A NCIA L SI TUA TI ON. The market has continued this week irregular. In the early days there were advances; Wednesday and Thursday there were declines. Friday the opening was better, but the market fell off again later in the day. Altogether the changes have not been material except in a few special cases. The industrial and railroad outlook remains favorable. Reports with ref­ erence to the crops are in the main construed accord­ ing to the object and inclination of the interpreter Of course the yield of winter wheat will turn out materially short; but other than that no real detri­ ment to the condition of any crop has yet been estab­ lished so far as we can observe. Earnings still show gains. Aside from these matters the gold export movement and the conditions as to the trade balances, etc., which the movement seems to establish, have been the chief influences. Mr. Austin, of the Bureau of Statistics, issued the May trade figures this week and they show results which pertainly put gold exports now in progress almost beyond comprehension. The imports of mer­ chandise in May were valued at $70,131,628, which is $1,924,000 larger than the previous month of April and $16,546,977 larger than in May, 1898; but the expoits of merchandise were $93,836,489, which is $5,029,000 larger than in the previous month of April, and shows, consequently, a net favorable merchandise bal­ ance of $23,704,000 in May, which is very large, almost beyond precedent for that month. Indeed, no May, except in 1898, ever showed such a large net of exports, while, as a rule, the balance in May has been adverse, that is a net balance of imports. These facts are cer­ tainly remarkable in view of the shipments of gold still in progress. Even this week the gold shipments have reached $3,250,000 to Europe and $1,000,000 French coin to Cuba A less favorable feature in the mer­ chandise exports, one which has for some months been anticipated, is the decline that has occurred in May in the proportion of manufactures included in that total. Heretofore the amount has been running larger than a year ago; this month it seems to be just about the same expressed in values as it was in May 1898. Of course with the rise in prices of commod­ ities the falling off in exports of manufactures could not fail to become manifest soon. rvon. l x v i d . official announcement from Comptroller Bird S. Coler that the city of New York will, on July 5, dispose of $10,025,000 of its 3b per cent corporate stock. Later on there will, of course, be still other issues by the city when the municipal legislature can be induced to take action sanctioning the same. But disregarding further additions either by New York or Philadelphia, the three offerings we have enumerated furnish an aggregate of over twenty-two millions of new bonds — in exact figures $22,010,000. The report of the Agricultural Bureau at Wash­ ington, issued last Saturday, on the condition of the country’s growing grain crops, fully bears out the ex­ pectations of a decided shortage in the yield of winter wheat the present year. The average of con­ dition for the whole United States is given as only 67-3, which compares with 90'8 at the corresponding date last year, 78-5 on June 1 1897 and83-4 the mean of the June averages for the last thirteen years. With the exception of Oklahoma the report states there is not a State or territory where the condition is not below the fifteen-year average, or the average for such shorter term as may be available for com­ parisons. The shrinkage is chiefly in the great wheat producing belt of the Central West, and particularly in Illinois and Kansas. For Illinois the condition is given only 38 against 94 a year ago, and for Kansas the average is 53 against 104. But the other States in the same belt have suffered only less in degree. In Indiana the condition is 53 against 95, in Ohio 73 against 87, in Missouri 60 against 96, and in Michi­ gan 45 against 97. On the Pacific Coast, California, where the crop a year ago was almost a total failure, has a different story to tell this year, its condition being reported 81 against 33. In Oregon, however, the average is only 87 against 101, and in Washing­ ton 76 against 103. It is obvious in view of the decided shortage here foreshadowed in the yield of the fall sown wheat that much more importance than usual attaches to the probable outcome of the spring wheat crop. On this point it is too early yet to venture any predic­ tions. The Bureau makes the average of condition for that crop 91*4 June 1,1899, against 100-9 June 1, 1898, but this somewhat less favorable start signifies nothing, as the outcome will be controlled by the weather conditions of the next two months. The area seeded to spring wheat is a little smaller than that for 1898, the figures being 17,845,000 acres, against 18,315,000 acres. It is evident that in the winter wheat belt the results as to the other agricultural products, and particularly corn, will be of great moment this season. In such States as Kansas and Illinois, a deficiency in corn added to the deficiency in wheat might mean not only a de­ cided contraction in the grain tonnage of the rail­ roads, but also cause somewhat of a setback in general trade. On the other hand, it is possible to conceive of a corn harvest so abundant as to count as a full off­ set to the loss in wheat. For oats the average for the country at large is reported 88-7 against 98-0 last year. As to the probabilities regarding corn, it is not possible to sa.y anything definite. A favorable fact is that thus far there has been an abundance of moisture. A good deal of stress is being laid at the moment on the prospective investment demand likely to be engendered by the coming July interest and dividend disbursements, which are certain to be heavy. It seems important to note therefore that an especially large supply of new municipal bonds is coming on the market the latter half of the present month and the beginning of the next month. On Thursday of this week the State of Massachusetts received proposals for $6,385,000 of 3 per cent bonds. All but $100,000 of the bonds were awarded to Kuhn, Loeb & Co. at 100-64, a price which nets 2-972 per cent to maturity. Full particulars are given in our State and City Department, page 1195. On Monday June 26, as also appears by our State and City Department, the city of Philadelphia will open bids for $5,600,000 of its $11,200,000 3£ per cent serial loans to be issued for various improvements. This loan has been long delayed by litigation, but all obstacles having been finally overcome, half the total issue is now to In the iron and steel trades a remarkable condition be placed. The present week also we have had the of things has developed. Prices are still rising in J une 17, 1890.) THE CHRONICLE. every direction, and consumers seem to be in a state of panic. Within a very short time the price of steel billets has gone up four to five dollars a ton and the price of iron one to two dollars. Steel billets at Pitts­ burg are now quoted at #31‘50 a ton against #27*00 a month ago, and but #14*75 at this date in 1898. Here then there has been an advance in twelve months of over one hundred per cent. The comparison as to iron is the same. Southern foundry pig No. 2 rules at Cincinnati now at #18 a ton; a month ago the price was #14 50, a year ago but #8 75. The “ Iron Age” says that while it is true that the bulk of current business in many lines is merely the covering of urgent needs, it is equally true that a disposition to take hold for next year’ s delivery at or near present values is developing. Con­ sumption, it says, does not seem to be checked in any direction; on the contrary, it is a question more of delivery than of price. In the mean­ time iron production keeps steadily increasing, The “ Age’s” monthly statement shows a further net addition of three to the number of furnaces in blast and an increase in the weekly product since May 1 of nearly six thousand tons, the capacity of the active furnaces being now 258,062 tons per week against 250,095 tons a month ago. On March 1 the product was only 228,195 tons per week. Stocks are growing smaller and smaller; June 1 the amount was 233,235 tons against 284,127 tons May 1 and 506,575 tons January 1, while the holdings of the American Pig Iron Storage Warrant Company were only 67,300 tons June 1 against 80,500 May 1 and 150,8r0 Jan­ uary 1. Last week’s bank return showed a well-distributed increase in loans of #10,805,400 while the specie was reduced only #1,531,500. It is a noticeable fact, how­ ever, that the loss of specie reported by the National City bank was #8,856,900. This institution also showed a loss of #6,766,100 in deposits while the de­ posits of all the banks gained #7,770,000. The state­ ment only partially reflected the withdrawals of gold for shipment to Europe during the week, but this week’s return should show the full effect upon the banks of this export movement and also in part the effect of the shipment of #2,000,000 on Tuesday of this week and #1,250,000 to-day besides #1,000,000 to Cuba. The market for money has not been in the least influenced, even sentimentally, by the gold exports to Europe and there appears to be an abundance of money not only at this centre but at the principal cities in the interior and also among the larger oountry banks outside the reserve centres. Money on ca'l, n prc onting banker’s balances, has loaned at the Stock Exchange during the week at 2 per cent and at 3 per cent, averaging about 2f percent. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday the range was from 2 per cent to 3 per cent, with the bulk of the business at 2$ per cent. On Thursday loans were made at 2J per cent and at 3 per cent, with the majority of tbe transactions at 2| per cent, and on Friday the range was again 2@3, and the bulk of the business was at 2 } per cent. Banks and trust companies quote 2 per cent as the minimum, though the majority obtain 2$ per cent. Time loans are chiefly in demand for renewals, and the supply of money for this purpose and also for new contracts is abundant, but there is little inquiry for money for short periods. Kates are 3 per cent for sixty 1151 days to four months, and 3@3^ per cent for five to seven months on good mixed Stock Exchange collateral; while with a liberal admixture of good industrial stocks 4 per cent would be de­ manded for the last named period. The inquiry for commercial paper continues urgent from all sections of the country, and while the business is good it would be larger were the offerings to increase. Rates are 3@S4 per cent for sixty to ninety day endorsed bills receivable; 3^@ 3f per cent for prime and 4Q)5 per cent for good four to six month’s single names. Banks having large correspondence note a very light inquiry for money from the interior and the majority of the country banks not only seem well supplied with funds, but their chief anxiety is how to profitably employ their money. At some of the Eastern centres the banks have large accumulations which they find it almost impossible to invest, and they are constantly in the New York market, through their correspon­ dents, for paper. The political situation in Europe has been slightly strained during the week over the change in the French ministry. The friction between the Trans­ vaal and the British Governments had very little in­ fluence upon the London markets. Subscriptions were closed in London for the Russian loan during the week and final arrangements are reported to have been completed for the conversion of the Mexican loan. The Bank of England minimum rate of dis­ count remains unchanged at 3 per cent. The cable reports discounts of sixty to ninety day bank bills in London 2 per cent. The open market rate at Paris is 2J per cent and at Berlin and Frankfort it is 4 per cent. This high rate is reported to be due to the half yearly settlements. According to our special cable from London the Bank of England gained £667,549 bullion during the week and held £31,027,391 at the close of the week. Our corres­ pondent further advises us that the gain was due to imports of £328,000 (of which £251,000 were from the United States, £71,000 from Australia and £6,000 from Egypt), to receipts of £374,000 net from the in­ terior of Great Britain, and to exports of £34,000, of which £10,000 were to Peru and £24,000 were to other countries. The foreign exchange market has been exceedingly dull, generally steady and almost featureless during the week. The demand for remittance seems to have been small and the Bupply of bankers’ bills, outside those offered in connection with gold exports, has been limited. The offerings of commercial bills has likewise been small and though 60-day sterling has commanded good figures the drawing of these bills in expectation of covering later in the season with cotton drafts has not been greatly noticeable this week. There was an export of #2,000,000 gold to Europe by the National City Bank on Tuesday. Yes­ terday Goldman, Sachs &Co. withdrew #1,250,000 for shipment on the steamer sailing to-day. Gold re­ ceived at the Custom House during the week, #398,869. Lawrence Turnure & Co. sent #1,000,000 in French coin to Cuba. Nominal rates for exchange have ranged from 4 86£ to 4 87 for sixty-day and from 4 88£ to 4 89 for sight, with the majority of the drawers quoting the lower figures. Rates for actual business have been prac­ tical,y unchanged during the week, and, as noted 1152 THE CHRONICLE. [You Lxvm. Unless this view of the South African dispute be recognized, the merits of the controversy would be in considerable doubt, even to observers in sympathy with the general movement of Anglo-Saxon progress. The bald fact of the situation is, that the South African Republic enjoys, through its treaty with Great Britain in 1881, full power over the administra­ tion of its internal affairs. It has used this power, undoubtedly, to reserve the effective right of suffrage to the Dutch inhabitants, the newcomers or “ Uitlanders” being restricted to a few formal and empty privileges, none of their elected representatives having F B I., MOW..

When this happens in the ease of an nnprogressive popular minority, with an alert and rigorous majority knocking at the doors of government, the event cannot long remain uncer­ tain. I f it be alleged that the Dutch settlers left Natal to escape English rule, took up arms suc­ cessfully to shake off such control in 1881, and now see no alternative between return of such outside domination and refusal of the suffrage to the OutlanderB, it must be answered on the other side that these disfranchised citizens and their belongings comprise two-thirds of the popula­ tion and nine-tenths of the property of the South African Republic, and that the suffrage right is certainly not denied them on the ground of their unfitness to participate in self government. Here, then, is not a republic at all, but a government which can hardly be described except as an agricultural aris­ tocracy. Even this anomaly for an industrial commun­ ity in the nineteenth century might have been patiently tolerated, if the Council and the restricted Volksraad had given enlightened government to the new comers. But as all the world has by this time learned, legisla­ tion has become narrower, more restrictive, more monopolistic, and more intensely provincial, almost in proportion as the mining industry and the cities of the Rand have grown in magnitude. To such a situation some change must have come, unless modern civilization is assumed not to hold sway in South Africa. We believe that the change would have come peacefully long before this, but for the reckless and inexcusable act of bad faith known as the Jameson Raid. It is our opinion that even now, the controversy will end in the virtual surrender of President Krtlger. The British government, having publicly taken an attitude which has the moral if not the technical right on its side, can hardly recede without a further word of protest. Sir Alfred Milner, indeed, an ex­ perienced diplomatist, plainly intimated in advance that if guch a policy were to be adopted, he would at once resign his own post of British high commis­ sioner. But if KrOger were to refuse to yield to a peremptory demand, there would be created a diplo­ matic impaste which nothing but force could break. President Krfiger is, however, too sagacious a states­ man not to know that if England were once driven to threaten and use force in the Transvaal, the end even of nominal Boer dominion would be in sight. It is quite true that in 1881 the Boers defeated the British troops in a contest over this very question, and crowned their victory with the existing treaty. It is true, also, that the average Boer citizen may have some excuse, in recalling the incidents of 1896, for indulging in hopes of intervention favorable to the Dutch by other European powers with South African interests. But the veteran “ Oom Paul” must certainly be aware that conditions differ radically to day from 1881. The surrender of the British garrisons and the crushing defeat of General Colley at Majuba Hill were made possible by the gross carelessness of com­ manders operating in a completely unfriendly country. To-day it is probable that a majority of the inhabi­ tants would favor the British side. Further­ more, the struggle of 1880 and 1881 was a half­ hearted contest on the English side, the Gladstone ministry believing that continuance of the war, in a remote agricultural community, wonld be 1153 needless and wrong — a belief which led to inadequate provision for war and to instant suit for peace. To-day not only would the prize of vic­ tory be one of the richest attainable, but the gen­ eral sense of progressive nations would justify Eng­ land’s attitude. As for Germany, it is hardly necessary to say that conditions differ radically from those in existence when the Emperor dashed off his famous'telegram to Kruger in February 1896. From a general diplomatic understanding between Ger­ many and England, affairs have advanced so far as to admit of a cordial personal interview between. Emperor William and Kiflger's most active adver­ sary, Cecil Rhoades, and Germany's intervention is now one of the most remote of possibilities. All this is perfectly well known to the astute old politician at Pretoria, whom Bismarck described as one of the two or three ablest diplomatists of his day. It is quite improbable that so expert a student of affairs would rely even on the shadowy Afrikander-Bund be­ tween the f)utch communities of the South African Republic, the Orange Free State, and the Cape. Just now it is reasonable to suppose that Ki tiger is utilizing, for his own purposes, Lord Salisbury's known aversion even to the threat of war; and he may succeed b y obstinate maintenance of his ground up to the veiy last moment in reserving more of the Boer's exclusive power than has lately seemed possible. It will be ob­ served that at the very moment when the despatches pronounce the outlook for compromise to be hope­ less, come intimations of the possible basis on which the President wonld be personally willing to extend the votiDg right to the new citizens. B U S IN E S S A C T I V I T Y A N D 1 H E S T A T E O F EMPLOYMENT. A law passed at this yi ar's session of our State Legislature, at the suggestion of Governor Roosevelt, has provided the means for the “ compiling and pub­ lishing of quarterly bulletins” by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of New Y'ork. The bureau has just issued the first of these bulletins, oovering the quarter end­ ing March 31, 1899, and it contains some useful statistical matter. Among other things tables are presented showing the membership of the trades unions in the different trades, with the number and proportions of those at work and those idle; their re la tive and absolute earnings, &c., &c. Some very brief comparisons are also made in the caae of the grand aggregates with the corresponding aggregates for 1898 and 1897, so that it is possible to see the changes that have occurred contrasted with these earlier years. Reports of this kind, if intelligently and ration­ ally compiled, possess elements of considerable use­ fulness. It is hardly possible to exaggerate the value of a really accurate record of that sort after it has been kept up a number of years, showing the percentages and numbers of those unemployed at stated periods. It would furnish one more barometer of the state of our industries, and afford an indica­ tion of the way industrial conditions are affecting the classes most dependent upon them. New Y ork is the largest State in the Union, making the facts as to its labor situation peculiarly interesting and in­ structive. Of course the statistics relate only to thn members of trades unions.

In certain industries the demand was such that nearly the entire membership found occupation. This is particularly true of the transportation branch. For instance, out of 10,*799 employes of steam roads only 197 were idle March 31, being less than 2 per cent. Among the street railway men only 9 out of a total membership of 3,150 were so unfortunate as not to find situations— in brief, the percentage of idle ness here was almost nil. In two or three depart­ ments of what are called the \"Clothing and Textile Trades” absolutely every member had employment. This statement applies especially to “ Flats, Caps and Furs” and to “ Boots, Shoes, Gloves, etc.” In the Clothing and Textile Trades, as a whole, 8*8 per cent of the men were without something to do, but only 2-4-per cent of the women. The proportions idle the w hole quarter were but 3 7 and 1*4 per cent respec­ tively. In the “ Printing and Allied Trades” only 5-6 per cent of the men and 5-3 per cent of the women were idle for the whole quarter. In \"Metals, Ma­ chinery and Shipbuilding\" 3-3 per cent of the men had been able to find no work for the quarter. Com­ parison with the results in the corresponding quarter of last year shows that the condition of employment improved in all the leading trades represented in organized labor, with the exception of the building trades, already referred to, and the tobacco trades, in the latter of which some changes are going on that are affecting the women workers with especial se­ verity. The pamphlet also gives detailed returns, in the same form, for the December quarter of 1898, and these are particularly useful in showing the fluctua­ tions of employment in certain trades, and also tbe part played by the soason in affecting the extent of employment. We have referred above to the winter weather as accounting for the large percentage of un­ employed in the building trades. That this is the true explanation is evident when we look at the figures for the December quarter and see that the number of union members without any work in that quarter was only 6'3 per cent of the whole, as against 2GT per cent for the March, 1899, quarter. The long­ shoremen similarly had work in the autumn and very little in the winter. On the other hand the tailoring trade was very dull during the autumn, while it gave very good employment during the winter. The re port notes an unusually large percentage of idlentsa on the last day of December in the Clothing and Textile trades (it amounting to over 60 per cent), and points out that this is largely accidental, being a consequence of inventory taking on the last day of the year. The holiday season, too, it says, must inevit­ ably affect figures of employment on December 31. This is a defect that should be overcome in subse­ quent returns. In some way it should be fonnd possible to avoid results which must inevitably mis­ lead a great many people. It would be well, too, to guard more carefully against clerical and typographi­ cal errors, of which we find a number in the pamphlet. 1155 W H A T TO D O T O P R E V E N T R A I L R O A D R A T E WARS. In the “ Forum” for June, under the title of “ A New Departure in Railroad Management.” Mr. .J. WMidgley, formerly Chairman of the Southwestern Railway Association, has an article in whicn he dis­ cusses the question as to what expedients are availa­ ble to the railroads for the prevention of rate wars in the struggle for competitive traffic. The discus­ sion has reference, of course, to the peculiar situa­ tion which has arisen in the railroad world since the decisions of the United States Supreme Court adverse to the legality of the Trans Missouri and Joint Traffic Associations. The principles there laid down make it impossible for the carriers to combine for the pur­ pose of fixing or maintaining rates, and yet unity of action among them is necessary to prevent ruinous strife and reckless competition. Mr. Midgley dwells upon the urgency of the need, both from the standpoint of the railroad investor and from that of the wage-earning classes employed in the service of the roads, lie shows that according to the last complete report of the Inter-State Commerce Commission tbe railroads of the United States, aggre­ gating 184,428 miles, were capitalized stock and bonds for $10,635,008,074 ; of this amount $5,270,365,819 was funded debt. Parenthetically we may say that Mr. Midgley gives this latter amount $5,364,642,255, but he has made a mistake in drawing off the figures. Of the outstanding stock 7010 per cent did not, in 1897, pay any dividend; while 16-59 per cent of the funded debt, exclusive of equipment trust obligations, was in the same unprofit­ able category. Alongside of these facts, he places the suggestive one that 41-41 per cent of the 67-06 per cent which it cost to operate the railroads consisted of wages and salaries paid to employes—a total, for 1897, of $465 601,581. In other words the companies disbursed $752,524,764 in the operation of their lines of road, which was 67-06 per cent of their gross earn­ ings from all sources for the same period. Mr. Midgley employs words we have often used ourselves when ho says there can be no lasting or compbte return to national prosperity while the largest single interest in the country is practically disabled. Under normal conditions, when the rail­ roads are permitted to operate profitably, they are the chief employers of labor, the principal purchasers of iron and w-ood, and the best customers for numerous other products. If, however, they are forced to econ­ omize, the stress upon them is reflected in a reduction of the running-time of mills, manufactories and kin­ dred industries ; and until those works are revived by a multiplicity of orders, trade in general will languish, capital in vast suras will continue to lie idle, real estate will be a burden, and armies of unemployed men will roam over the land or loiter in the cities. The picture is not overdrawn. What then is the remedy. How are the railroads to secure just com­ pensation for their services, now that recourse cannot be had to pools, nor to compacts to maintain agreed rates. Mr. Midgely passes in review the various plans to this end which have been suggested in the past. He refers to tho proposal of the late Jay Gould, who suggested the formation of a company which should lease the traffic, passenger or freight, of a number of railroads in a given territory—just as the express and sleeping car business is conducted by separate THE CHRONICLE. corporations. If it is competent, says Mr. Midgley, to lease the carriage of passengers in chair and sleeping cars or the transportation of high class or perishable goods by express, it must b« equally so to lease the carriage of passengers in ordinary coaches, and the transportation of freight of all descriptions, to corporations that will under­ take to perform the services satisfactorily to the pub­ lic on terms acceptable to the lessors. But Mr. Midgley simply presents this plan for consideration without recommending it. Another plan is that with which Mr. Huntington’s name has been iden­ tified It was brought forward about the same time as the scheme of Mr. Gould. It provides for the formation of a central company, the shares of which shall be allotted in equitable proportions to the sub sidiarv corporations that would be merged therein It would be practicable to start with any number of railroads operating in a given section: and if a majority should deem it to their interest to unite, the economies that would be introduced, and the reBu'ts likely to be achieved, would be such as to ren­ der it expedient for all others traversing the same territory to seek admission. Mr. Midgley says un­ doubtedly greater obstacles would attend the incep­ tion of this plan, because of the difficulty of satisfying each company to be merged that it would be consider­ ately treated in the allotments in the central com­ pany. Moreover, it would represent an aggregation of capital the colossal magnitude of which might provoke hostility at the outset. “ Yet it is here pre­ sented as a practicable plan for the conservative operation of properties whose traffic affairs are now like a majestic ship afloat on a tempestuous sea, without rudder or compass, and with the sky overcast by day and by night.” Mr. Midgley’s preference is for a wholly diffeient plan. He points out that while the decision in the Joint Traffic case prohibits railroads from agreeing to maintain established rates of fare and freight, it does not estop any of them from adopting the same tariff that a competitor may announce. A railroad is at liberty, under its charter, to publish such tolls as it may elect, and can enforce the same, subject only to the proviso that they shall be reasonable and not excessive or unduly preferential; hence it would not contravene the Joint Traffic decision were the charges thus stated to be identical with those promul­ gated by a rival company. The inhibition lies against associations of common carriers agreeing to maintain certain fixed rates, because such pro­ ceed ure would tend to stifle competition. Allusion is made to Justice Beckham’ s statement that the good sense of the managers must be relied on to avert un­ seemly strife, a statement which Mr. Midgley thinks anticipates the point that the chartered right to pre­ scribe reasonable rates, determined in the manner here indicated, necessarily involves the authority to require their strict observance. Consequently he argues it would bo entirely competent for the highest traffic officer of a given road to insist upon strict conformity by his subordinates, with the company's published charges; and the fact that, in so doing, he had duplicated the prices of a competitor or of a number of rivals that were in positions to share the traffic, would not in the slightest degree invalidate the act. In effect this is the plan the carriers have adopted the present yoar, and gr»at success has attended the effort, for not in years have rates been so closely ad­ 'v^ Lxvm hered to as they have since the 1st of January. But it will be admitted that the scheme has been tried under very favorable conditions. Business has been active, the crop movement large and general traffic heavy, thus providing exceptional employment for the facilities of the roads. Suppose now the conditions reversed—suppose the crop movement contracting and general business shrinking, with not enough traffic to go around: resulting in a general scramble anions the roads for what little there may be. That is the time when the true test will come. How would Mr. Midgley provide for this contingency? He evi­ dently foresees such a time, for he makes the obser­ vation that the railroads are largely to blame for the hapless conditi n in which the law has left them. If the outcome should be, he remarks, the advent of an order of men who mean precisely what they say, who will intelligently instruct and who will insure that they are literally obeyed, then what has been viewed as a disaster may not prove altogether so. He would have the owners of the properties realize their predicament and the urgent necessity for reform. He urges the election of directors who will co-operate with leading bankers of acknowledged reputation and courage. “ A few such firms would be sufficient to con­ trol wisely the operations of all companies comprised in Trunk Line and Central Traffic territory, with similar machinery for the direction of affairs west of Chicago and St. Louis.” “ The method would be for the bankers in question to acquire, by purchase, deposit, or acting as trustees, sufficient securities of the companies de­ scribed, to give them a controlling voice in their man­ agement. Each firm could delegate one of its mem­ bers to devote the time necessary to discharge properly the duties confided to the board; and the latter could employ, as secretaries or agents, traffic experts who could intelligently and promptly report on all questions as they arose. Through those officers advices could be communicated to the ex­ ecutives of each road, conformity with which would avert demoralization, insure economy in operations, confer benefits upon the community, accord fair com­ pensation to employes, and assurance to thousands of patient and dependent ones, whose savings would thereby be protected. Under the circumstances mentioned, the wishes of the board refe/ied to would have the force of law ; and no railroad officer would be disposed to disregard them.” This is a plausible scheme, in line with somewhat analagous suggestions that have at various times been made by others in the past, and unless Congress provides proper remedial legislation, it or some other similar plan will eventually have to be resorted to. If those who believe in seeing competition stimu­ lated to the point of destruction should urge that such an arrangement would provide a rigid and in­ flexible system of rates, then the reply is that no other result could follow even in the case of govern­ ment ownership. Mr. Midgley’s remarks on this aspect of the case are pertinent and to the point. In the event that the Government had complete control of the properties by purchase, is it to be presumed, he asks, that the Eederal authorities would permit parallel lines to compete with each other regardless of cost or reason, or would those intrusted with their management be required to maintain strictly the tariffs which the Government would pre­ scribe? Obviously, there would be no variation from tho published schedules, under penalty of removal or THE Jose 17, 1899.] 1157 CHRONICLE. worse punishment. “ Does it then comport with the dignity of a great and conquering nation,” he asks, “ to do what no other country does, whether republic, limited monarchy, or despotism; natuely, hamper and fetter the railroad corporations with unjust restric­ tions, withhold from them liberty of co-operation, deny them the right to agree and maintain rates which shall be reasonable, and at the same time de­ cline to assume the responsibilities that must necessarilyattach to ownership?” R A I L R O A D GROSS A N D N E T E A R N IN G S. Our compilation of the gross and net earnings of United States railroads for the month of April reveals no new feature, i t shows continued favorable re­ sults. In brief, the statement records $3,771,073 in­ crease (5-46 per cent) in the gToss receipts, and $1,521,613 increase, or 7‘73 per cent, in the net earnings. There were in April the present year quite a number of adverse influences and conditions. There had been in March some contraction in the grain movement: in April, however, this shrinkage reached large proportions. In addition the month had one less business day than the same month last year, April 1899 having contained five Sundajs against only four in April, 1898. Furthermore, navigation on the Great Lases opened last year in April, whereas the present year it was delayed until the 1st of May. Had navigation been open, the trunk lines running from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario to tidewater would undoubtedly have received a considerable tonnage in grain from the lakes for transportation to the sea­ board. This they missed. In the case of roads like the Northern Pacific and Oregon Navigation, there was a loss on the Alaskan business which last year was so heavy by reason of the Klondike gold excite­ m ent; these roads, too, had a diminished grain ton­ nage on their lines to the Pacific Northwest. In Colorado the snow blockade on the Colorado Midland was not raised until April 14. In April of last year there were few decreases of any kind among the separate roads, and not any, either in gross or net, for as much as $30,000. This year we have six decreases for over $30,000 in the gross and ten in the net, nearly all of which are ex­ plained by what has been said above. Against this limited number of decreases the increases are as heretofore very numerous. A full list of them in our usual form is annexed.

This is the first dividend to stockholders. The claims of the depositors were paid in full within fifty-eight days after the suspension of the bank, on October 3. — The directors of the Globe National bank of Providence, R. I., capital $300,000, surplus and undivided profits $112,964, have recommended to the stockholders the voluntary liqui­ dation of the hank and the division o f the assets. -The rea­ son assigned by the directors is the “ unprofitable condition attendant upon national hanking in the community.” Marsden J. Perry, President of the hank, says that owners of more than three-fourths of the stock approve the plan. Therefore it will probably be carried into execution. To this condition of the banking business in Providence is also doubtless due the unanimous decision last week of the stock­ holders of the American National Bank of that city to re­ duce its capital from $1,437,650 to $1,000,000, leaving the surplus and undivided profits at $60,000 and paying stock­ holders 30 per cent of the par value of the stock reduced. There are twenty-six banks in Providence, all except one being national, and the aggregate capital is $14,932,800, while the deposits are but little more than $20,000,000. There are also four trust companies in Providence, having an aggregate capital of $2,381,500 and deposits of about $27,000,000. There would seem, therefore, to he an over-supply of banking fa­ — The stockholders of the National Bank of North Am er­ ica almost unanimously voted on Wednesday in favor of the proposition of the directors to increase the par of the stock from $70 to $100. This will be done by the declaration of a cash dividend, as we stated two weeks ago, of $30 per share out of the undivided profits, thereby increasing the captital from $700,000 to $1,000,000. After this dividend has been m|ide the surplus of the bank will be $500,000. — The Union Trust Company of Newark, N . J ., was in­ corporated on Wednesday in that city with a capital of $1,000,000.

Saturday, June 3 , 1899. Business has been very restricted upon the Stock Exchange this week, partly because the last settlement of the month began on Saturday last,and ended only on Wednesday evening, and partly because the account was found to be much larger than had been anticipated. There was no difficulty in arranging it, But the amount of money that had to be borrowed was considerable. And as pay-day fell on the last day of the month, a day when the joint-stock banks make up tbeir monthly balance sheets, and when large pay­ ments always fall due, money was fonnd to he scarce and dear. Extensive amounts had to be borrowed from the Bank of England. The closing of the N ew York Stock 1160 THE [ vol. l x v i u . CHRONICLE.

According to all appearances at present there will be as great a strin­ gency in Germany in the autumn as there was last year. And it is reasonable to suppose that with the wonderful activity in trade throughout the United States when the crops are beiDg moved money will be in very strong demand. Therefore the more careful thinkers are of opinion that in the autumn we shall see high rates in London. B at it is quite probable that in the meantime rates here m ay fall away.
