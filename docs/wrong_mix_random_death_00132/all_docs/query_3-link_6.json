        "text": "Critical edition of the Greek New Testament\n\nNovum Testamentum Graece (The New Testament in Greek) is a critical edition of the New Testament in its original Koine Greek, forming the basis of most modern Bible translations and biblical criticism. It is also known as the Nestle–Aland edition after its most influential editors, Eberhard Nestle and Kurt Aland. The text, edited by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research, is currently in its 28th edition, abbreviated NA28.\n\nThe title is sometimes applied to the United Bible Societies (UBS) edition, which contains the same text (its fifth edition referred to as UBS5, contains the text from NA28). The UBS edition is aimed at translators and so focuses on variants that are important for the meaning whereas the NA includes more variants.\n\nThe Greek text as presented is what biblical scholars refer to as the \"critical text\". The critical text is an eclectic text compiled by a committee that compares readings from a large number of manuscripts in order to determine which reading is most likely to be closest to the original. They use a number of factors to help determine probable readings, such as the date of the witness (earlier is usually better), the geographical distribution of a reading, and the likelihood of accidental or intentional corruptions. In the book, a large number of textual variants, or differences between manuscripts, are noted in the critical apparatus—the extensive footnotes that distinguish the Novum Testamentum Graece from other Greek New Testaments.\n\nMost scholars view uncial text as the most accurate; however, a few authors, such as New Testament scholar Maurice A. Robinson,[1] linguist Wilbur Pickering,[2] Arthur Farstad and Zane C. Hodges claim that the minuscule texts (the Byzantine text-type) more accurately reflect the \"autographs\" or original texts than an eclectic text like NA28 that relies heavily on manuscripts of the Alexandrian text-type. This view is referred to as the \"Byzantine priority theory\".[3][4] The theory has been criticized by Gordon Fee[5] and Bruce Metzger[6] among others. Since the majority of old manuscripts in existence are minuscules, they are often referred to as the Majority Text. It is worth noting, though, that the Majority Text as a whole is classified by the editors of the NA28 (of whom Metzger is one) as a \"consistently cited witness of the first order,\" meaning that whenever the text presented differs from the majority text this is recorded in the apparatus along with the alternate reading.[7] Other consistently cited references include the full corpus of papyrus manuscripts available to the authors as well as a wide range of other manuscripts including a selection of both minuscules and uncials.[7]\n\nThe Novum Testamentum Graece apparatus summarizes the evidence (from manuscripts and versions) for, and sometimes against, a selection of the most important variants for the study of the text of the New Testament. While eschewing completeness (in the range of variants and in the citation of witnesses), this edition does provide informed readers with a basis by which they can judge for themselves which readings more accurately reflect the originals. The Greek text of the 28th edition is the same as that of the 5th edition of the United Bible Societies' The Greek New Testament (abbreviated UBS5) although there are a few differences between them in paragraphing, capitalization, punctuation and spelling.[8]\n\nIn 1898 Eberhard Nestle published a handbook of textual criticism, and in 1898 published the first edition of a Greek New Testament under the title Novum Testamentum Graece cum apparatu critico ex editionibus et libris manu scriptis collecto.\n\nThe text of this Greek New Testament was later combined with the editions of Constantin von Tischendorf (Editio octava critica maior), The New Testament in the Original Greek of Westcott and Hort, and the edition of Richard Francis Weymouth. It was edited by the Württemberg Bible Society in Stuttgart. This edition eliminated the extremes of Tischendorf, such as partiality to Sinaiticus, and of Westcott and Hort, such as partiality to Vaticanus.[9]\n\nEberhard's son Erwin Nestle took over after his father's death and issued the 13th edition in 1927. This edition introduced a separate critical apparatus and finally introduced consistency to the majority reading principle.[10] In the apparatus only a few minuscules were included.\n\nKurt Aland became the associate editor of the 21st edition in 1952. At Erwin Nestle's request, he reviewed and expanded the critical apparatus, adding many more manuscripts. This eventually led to the 25th edition of 1963. The most important Papyri and newly discovered Uncials, as 0189, a few Minuscules (33, 614, 2814), occasionally also lectionaries were taken into account.\n\nMembers of the Editorial Committee of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament comprise:\n\nUBS1, 1966\n\nKurt Aland, Matthew Black, Bruce Metzger, Allen Wikgren.[13]\n\nUBS2, 1968\n\nKurt Aland, Matthew Black, Bruce Metzger, Allen Wikgren.\n\nUBS3, 1975\n\nKurt Aland, Matthew Black, Carlo Maria Martini, Bruce Metzger, Allen Wikgren.\n\nUBS4, 1993\n\nBarbara Aland, Kurt Aland, Johannes Karavidopoulos, Carlo Maria Martini, Bruce Metzger\n\nUBS5, 2014\n\nBarbara Aland, Kurt Aland, Johannes Karavidopoulos, Carlo Maria Martini, Bruce Metzger in co-operation with the Institute for New Testament Textual Research, Münster[14]\n\nIn 2011 the Global Board of the United Bible Societies appointed a new editorial committee that will prepare future editions of the Nestle–Aland Novum Testamentum Graece as well as of the Greek New Testament. The committee consists of Christos Karakolis (University of Athens, Greece), David Parker (University of Birmingham, United Kingdom), Stephen Pisano (Pontifical Biblical Institute, Italy, a university of the Holy See[15]), Holger Strutwolf (University Münster, Germany), David Trobisch (Museum of the Bible/Green Collection Oklahoma City, US) and Klaus Wachtel (University Münster, Germany).[16]\n\nA more complete set of variants is listed in the multiple volume Novum Testamentum Graecum – Editio Critica Maior. A small number of textual changes in the most current edition were incorporated in the 28th edition of the Nestle–Aland,[17] published in 2012. Papyri 117-127 were used in this edition.\n\nThe NA28 text is published by Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft (the German Bible Society).[18]\n\nGreek:\n\nNovum Testamentum Graece, Standard 28th edition, ISBN 978-3-438-05140-0 (2012).\n\nNovum Testamentum Graece, Large Print 27th edition, ISBN 978-3-438-05103-5 (1993).\n\nNovum Testamentum Graece, Wide Margin 27th edition, ISBN 978-3-438-05135-6\n\nNovum Testamentum Graece, 28th edition with A Concise Greek-English Dictionary of the New Testament (by B.

Verses in which any one of the seven editions differs by a single word are not counted. This result is quite amazing, demonstrating a far greater agreement among the Greek texts of the New Testament during the past century than textual scholars would have suspected […]. In the Gospels, Acts, and Revelation the agreement is less, while in the letters it is much greater.\"[19] For over 250 years, New Testament apologists have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.[20]\n\nBook Verses Variant-free verses Percentage Average variants per page Matthew 1071 642 59.9% 6.8 Mark 678 306 45.1% 10.3 Luke 1151 658 57.2% 6.9 John 869 450 51.8% 8.5 Acts 1006 677 67.3% 4.2 Romans 433 327 75.5% 2.9 1 Corinthians 437 331 75.7% 3.5 2 Corinthians 256 200 78.1% 2.8 Galatians 149 114 76.5% 3.3 Ephesians 155 118 76.1% 2.9 Philippians 104 73 70.2% 2.5 Colossians 95 69 72.6% 3.4 1 Thessalonians 89 61 68.5% 4.1 2 Thessalonians 47 34 72.3% 3.1 1 Timothy 113 92 81.4% 2.9 2 Timothy 83 66 79.5% 2.8 Titus 46 33 71.7% 2.3 Philemon 25 19 76.0% 5.1 Hebrews 303 234 77.2% 2.9 James 108 66 61.6% 5.6 1 Peter 105 70 66.6% 5.7 2 Peter 61 32 52.5% 6.5 1 John 105 76 72.4% 2.8 2 John 13 8 61.5% 4.5 3 John 15 11 73.3% 3.2 Jude 25 18 72.0% 4.2 Revelation 405 214 52.8% 5.1 Total 7947 4999 62.9%\n\nA 2008 comparison of the textual and stylistic choices of twenty translations against 15,000 variant readings shows the following rank of agreement with the Nestle–Aland 27th edition:[21]\n\nAbbreviation Name Relative agreement NASB New American Standard Bible 1 ASV American Standard Version 2 NASB New American Standard (1995 update) 3 NAB New American Bible 4 ESV English Standard Version 5 HCS Holman Christian Standard 6 NRSV New Revised Standard Version 7 NET New English Translation 8 RSV Revised Standard Version 9 NIV New International Version 10 NJB New Jerusalem Bible 11 REB Revised English Bible 12 JNT Jewish New Testament 13 GNB Good News Bible 14 NLT New Living Translation 15 DRA Douay-Rheims (American edition) 16 TLB The Living Bible 17 MRD Murdock Peshitta translation 18 NKJV New King James Version 19 KJV King James Version 20\n\nAlexandrian text-type\n\nByzantine text-type\n\nCaesarean text-type\n\nList of Bible verses not included in modern translations\n\nList of major textual variants in the New Testament\n\nTextual criticism\n\nTextus Receptus\n\nWestcott-Hort\n\nWestern text-type\n\nHolmes, Michael W.
