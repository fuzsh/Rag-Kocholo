        "text": "Ad Fontes (founded. 2018) has studied 3600 news sources, 700 podcasts and 474 TV/viideo programs, evaluating them on a two-point methodology.. In some circles, it's simply referred to as \"The Chart\" -- a mark of its reach and growing influence.\n\nThe bias rating, on the horizontal axis, ranges from most extreme left to middle to most extreme right. The reliability rating, demonstrated on the chartâ€™s vertical axis, rates sources on a scale from original fact reporting to analysis, opinion, propaganda and inaccurate/fabricated information.\n\nhttps://adfontesmedia.com/interactive-media-bias-chart/\n\nNews Source Ratings: Profiles by Title\n\nAlthough not all sources from The Chart are listed on this page, it's sometimes an easy way to find and isolate descriptions of major news and broadcast outlets. Profile pages describe methodology, and provide overall scores for both reliability and political \"lean.\" They link back to the larger Ad Fontes interactive Chart, so you can see a news outlet in context and in comparison to others.\n\nInteresting to Note: Many source profiles include content samples (individual articles or a particular broadcast), with reliability/bias ratings.\n\nReliability scores for articles and shows are on a scale of 0-64. Scores above 40 are generally good; scores below 24 are generally problematic.\n\nScores between 24-40 indicate a range of possibilities, with some sources falling there because they are heavy in opinion and analysis, and some because they have a high variation in reliability between articles.\n\nBias scores for articles and shows are on a scale of -42 to +42, with higher negative scores being more left, higher positive scores being more right, and scores closer to zero being minimally biased, equally balanced, or exhibiting a centrist bias."
