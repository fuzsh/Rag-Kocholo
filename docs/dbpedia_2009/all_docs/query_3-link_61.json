        "text": "Certification FAQs\n\nWhat is the FAC-C Modernization effort?\n\nOFPP’s FAC-C Modernization fosters a culture of lifelong learning for acquisition professionals. The FAC-C Modernization memo, dated January 19, 2023 updated the training and certification requirements for civilian contracting professionals and provided additional professional development opportunities through the introduction of credentials. The memo updated the certification program to a single-level certification FAC-C (Professional) that included a new curriculum, an updated competency model, and a professional certification exam. FAI developed three informational videos - one for the acquisition workforce, one for supervisors, and one covering some Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nWhat are the requirements for FAC-C (Professional)?\n\nTraining: You will need to complete four core training courses – CON 1100 (Contract Foundational Skills), CON 1200V (Contract Pre-Award), CON 1300V (Contract Award) and CON 1400V (Contract Post-Award).\n\nExperience: You will need to meet the minimum requirement of twelve months full-time experience applying a representative sample of the technical contracting common competencies.\n\nProfessional Exam: You will need to receive a passing score on the Contracting Professional certification exam. The professional contracting exam is a closed book, 150-question proctored exam on contracting competencies. An optional exam prep course is available to assist student preparation for the exam - CON 3910. Work closely with your supervisor, who will help you secure on-the-job training and experiential opportunities during your first year.\n\nIf I complete the training classes, can I request a legacy FAC-C certification after Sept. 30, 2023?\n\nNo, per the OFPP policy memo, the last day to request a FAC-C legacy was September 30, 2023.\n\nDid the competency model change?\n\nYes - a new competency model took effect on February 1, 2023. The new model is relevant and applicable across DoD, Federal Civilian agencies and industry. The new competency model aligns and simplifies the previous model and details both buyer and seller tasks, and includes an industry perspective.\n\nAre there any educational requirements for the FAC-C (Professional)?\n\nThere is no separate education requirement for certification, but OPM’s 1102 Hiring Qualifications standards remain in effect.\n\nWhat about continuous learning point (CLP) requirements for the FAC-C (Professional)?\n\nThe continuous learning point requirement remains at 80 hours until April 30, 2024. Effective May 1, 2024 (the start of the next common CL period) the continuous learning points required to maintain the FAC-C (Professional) certification will increase to 100 hours for every two year common period.\n\nWhat is a credential?\n\nA credential is designed to document your knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform a specific function, skill, or set of tasks. Credentials provide the knowledge and associated skills to perform job-centric, niche, and/or emerging functions in the acquisition environment. Credentials do not replace certifications or certification-related requirements. Instead, a credential is a curated learning package focused on a specific knowledge or skill area and includes multiple learning assets totaling 20 - 80 training hours. Credentials will provide just-in-time, on-demand training to acquisition workforce members in support of the lifelong learning model. For more information, review FAI’s credential page.\n\nDo credentials have continuous learning requirements?\n\nNo, credentials do not have continuous learning requirements. In fact, earning a credential is one of many ways to earn continuous learning points towards your certification requirements.\n\nHow do I earn a credential?\n\nTo earn a credential, acquisition workforce members need to complete the predetermined requirements for the specific credential, which may include a combination of one or more training courses along with other learning assets such as videos, games, simulations, and/or a capstone assessment. Credentials are earned through FAI CSOD. For more details on credentials, see FAI’s credential page.\n\nI have a DoD Contracting DAWIA certification in contracting. How can I become FAC-C certified?\n\nContact your agency Acquisition Career Manager (ACM) or your small agency representative (SAR) for specific directions on applying for a FAC-C (Professional) using your DAWIA certification. At a minimum when you apply for your FAC-C (Professional), you will need to provide proof of your continuous learning points.\n\nA DAWIA certification in contracting is equivalent to a FAC-C (Professional), provided the continuous learning criteria for FAC-C (Professional) has been met. Requirements for continuous learning can be found on the Continuous Learning page.\n\nI currently work for DoD. How can I obtain FAC-C (Professional)?\n\nFAC-C (Professional) is limited to individuals who work for federal civilian agencies.\n\nCan federal contractor employees earn Federal Acquisition Certifications?\n\nNo. Federal Acquisition Certification (FAC) programs are only intended for federal government employees.\n\nWhen a person transfers to a new agency, must their warrant be accepted also?\n\nContracting warrants, or Certificates of Appointment, are position specific. Warrants are granted to acquisition workforce members because of the position they hold at the time the warrant is granted. When a workforce member moves from position to position within an agency, the warrant does not necessarily move with them. The same is true when a workforce member moves from agency to agency. The warrant does not move with them.\n\nContracting Certification Exam - CON 3990V\n\nWhat is the passing score?\n\nThe passing score is 70% or higher.\n\nHow many questions are on the exam?\n\nThere are 150 questions, each randomly selected from a comprehensive database, ensuring that each exam delivered differs slightly from the next. FAI and DAU employ a common industry practice of periodically reviewing the performance of exam items to determine whether adjustments are needed to any exam questions.\n\nIs the CON 3990V Contracting Certification Exam open or closed-book?\n\nThe CON 3990V Contracting Certification Exam is completely closed book. Exam candidates will not be able to use or reference any subject material during the exam, to include but not limited to notes, books, computers, personal devices, etc.\n\nWhen does a candidate become eligible to take the exam?\n\nOnce all required training has been completed, (CON 1100V, CON 1200V, CON 1300V and CON 1400V), an exam candidate will be able to access the CON 3990V Contracting Certification Exam in FAI CSOD. Within 24 hours after registration, they will receive a welcome email from Pearson VUE (pearsonvueconfirmation@pearson.com) with detailed instructions on scheduling the exam. Exam candidates will not be able to register for the exam without the link provided in the PearsonVUE welcome email which will contain information on how to schedule the exam.\n\nHow is the exam delivered?\n\nThe exam is delivered by Pearson VUE, a commercial test service provider under contract with FAI. Exam candidates may choose one of two ways to take the exam: 1) In-person at a Pearson VUE test center; or 2) Virtually on a personal computer using OnVUE--a Pearson VUE software client application. This link provides excellent information for exam candidates for both options.\n\nIf a candidate decides to take the exam using the OnVUE application, they will have to download a software add-on. Additionally, exam candidates will have to conduct a mandatory system check prior to taking the exam. Please check the system requirements for the OnVUE application.\n\nAre there any advantages to taking the exam in-person at a test center vs. virtually using OnVUE?\n\nAlthough the exam is the same regardless of delivery method, historical data reflects an advantage to taking the exam in-person vs. virtually. Statistically speaking, the passing rate is ~5% higher for tests taken at a test facility. There are several factors that may contribute to the delta in the rates, i.e., IT/connectivity issues, increased test anxiety in the virtual environment, early termination due to examinee test environment compromise, etc. As such, it is STRONGLY recommended that examinees take exams at a physical Pearson VUE test location, and only choose the OnVUE virtual option by exception.\n\nWhere are the in-person testing facilities?\n\nWhen an exam candidate chooses to schedule “at a test center”, the search function will default to Pearson Professional Centers (PPC)’s based on the zip code in their FAI CSOD profile. If they are located near a DoD installation, they can also search to see if there is a test center on a base/post nearby, choosing the “Military Community” link below the search bar in the “Find a Test Center” page.\n\nWhat if there are no Pearson Professional Centers (PPC), or military on-base test centers within commuting distance from the exam candidate’s home or near their duty location?\n\nIf a test center search yielded no PPC’s or on-base location test centers within commuting distance to the candidate’s home or near their duty location, the best option would be to take the test virtually using OnVUE. If testing virtually is not a viable option, then they will need to work through their supervisor to secure a travel authorization prior to scheduling an exam appointment.\n\nWhat if a candidate needs to cancel or reschedule an exam?\n\nIt is no problem to cancel or reschedule a scheduled exam, as long as it is at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled appointment date and time.\n\nAre there any study materials available for the Contracting Certification Exam?\n\nHere are some study options for exam candidates:\n\nCON 3910 Contracting Certification Exam Prep Course, an online course within FAI CSOD is automatically assigned when an exam candidate registers for CON 3990V.\n\nFCN 3920 - Contracting DAWIA/FAC-C Certification Prep Course, a 5-day virtual instructor-led course which includes a pre-assessment, relevant content review, discussions, practice quizzes, and a post-assessment which emulates the Contracting Certification exam itself.\n\nA FAR Better View game which helps gain familiarity with the FAR parts and their titles.\n\nFAI also plans to have some live study sessions in a game-like environment in the near future.\n\nIs there a fee for candidates to take the exam?\n\nNo, all exam fees are paid by the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI). If a candidate is a “no-show”, the Government will still be charged for a full exam fee and the candidate will have one failed exam attempt on their record.\n\nIs there anything specific exam candidates should be aware of before registering for CON 3990V?\n\nExam candidates should ensure that both their first and last name in their FAI CSOD profile matches their official Gov't ID or state ID. Pearson VUE requires an ID check prior to starting the exam, and if the names do not match, candidates will not be allowed to sit for the exam.\n\nHow much time is allotted to take the exam?\n\nCandidates will be allowed three (3) hours to take the exam - this time encompasses all “seat time” at the Pearson VUE test facility, and includes the exam intro, tutorial, 150-question exam, breaks, and any pre-submission review. There are no breaks allowed if the exam is taken virtually via onVUE.\n\nWhat material is covered in the exam?\n\nCandidates will need to be able to demonstrate a foundational understanding of the Contracting Common Technical Competencies and related job tasks found in the Contracting Competency Model. The questions in the exam, and more importantly, the correct answers, are derived from the policy and guidance in the FAR and, very minimally, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) as it relates to the competencies and job tasks in the Contracting Competency Model. Exam candidates should be familiar with the titles of the following FAR Parts: 1, 2, 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 31, 33, 42, 44, 46, and 49.\n\nHow many questions are on the exam for each of the competencies in the DoD Contracting Competency Model?\n\nThe table below depicts the distribution of questions in the exam per competency:\n\nIs there any TDY or travel required to take the Exam?\n\nFAI expects that there will be a Pearson VUE test location within commuting distance from most everyone’s home of record or duty station. In the rare event there is not a Pearson VUE test site available within commuting distance, and if testing virtually is not a viable option, then the exam candidate must receive travel authorization through their agency prior to scheduling the exam.\n\nIf someone passes the CON 3990V exam, can they avoid taking the required certification courses?\n\nNo. Completion or fulfillment of the certification courses, CON 1100V, 1200V, 1300V, and 1400V, are required for certification. CON 3990V is a separate and distinct FAC-C (Professional) requirement from the four courses.\n\nCan the requirement for the CON 3990V Contracting Certification Exam be met through fulfillment?\n\nNo, in order to obtain the FAC-C (Professional), candidates must take and pass the CON 3990V Contracting Certification Exam, fulfillment for this requirement is not an option.\n\nWhat happens if an exam candidate fails?\n\nAfter each attempt, they receive a detailed diagnostic report showing scores in the four main competency areas. This report can assist them with pinpointing areas in which they can improve and help them plan their study efforts. The exam candidate’s Agency may recommend actions such as retaking training or setting intervals between attempts, providing guidance as needed. If a candidate fails the exam on their first attempt, FAI recommends taking FCN 3920, a five-day virtual instructor-led course, before trying again. However, if the individual has already completed FCN 3920, they do not need to retake it. After each unsuccessful attempt, FAI advises candidates to thoroughly review their exam performance feedback with their supervisor and study CON 3910 prep course materials. Candidates may attempt the exam up to three times within a year. FAI mandates a 30-day gap between exam attempts for preparation and coaching.\n\nWhat happens if a candidate fails the third attempt?\n\nUpon the third unsuccessful attempt within a 12-month period, candidates must review their exam feedback and CON 3910 and FCN 3920 materials. All remedial steps taken by the candidate must be validated and endorsed by their Agency before attempting the exam again.\n\nCan someone who has failed the exam get a copy of the exam questions and answers missed?\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to provide copies of specific exam questions and answers missed. Our commitment to fairness and academic integrity prevents us from releasing exam questions, as doing so could compromise the integrity of future exams and potentially provide an unfair advantage to other students. Exam candidates are provided comprehensive diagnostic reports after each exam attempt, which breaks down scores by competency area, helping them identify areas for improvement and will help focus their study efforts effectively.\n\nWhat should I do if I have a disability and require reasonable accommodation for the Contracting Certification Exam?\n\nIf you require a reasonable accommodation for the Contracting Certification Exam due to a disability, ensure you have an agency-approved accommodation letter detailing your needs. Email a copy of this letter, along with the approved accommodations, to fairegistrar@gsa.gov. Once sent, await confirmation from FAI, who will work with Pearson VUE to update your profile accordingly. Note that some comfort aids are pre-approved and do not require prior authorization. These aids will be allowed in the testing room upon visual inspection by Test Center staff. Common accommodations include extra time, breaks, a lamp, a separate room, or a reader. If you have any further questions or need assistance, both FAI and Pearson VUE are available to help.\n\nWhere can I submit any questions, concerns, or feedback about the exam that hasn’t been addressed in any of the policy, FAQ’s, or other guiding documents or websites?\n\nSubmit an inquiry to the DAU help desk or through the Pearson VUE customer service link.\n\nFAC-P/PM CERTIFICATION\n\nHow do I know if I’m subject to the Federal Acquisition Certification in Program and Project Managers (FAC-P/PM)?\n\nCheck with your Acquisition Career Manager (ACM) or small agency Representative (SAR).\n\nHow do I find my ACM/SAR?\n\nGo to the ACM/SAR directory on this website.\n\nTo whom does the FAC-P/PM Certification apply?\n\nThe FAC-P/PM applies to all Federal employees of executive branch agencies EXCEPT those covered under 10 USC, such as the Department of Defense who are assigned as a program and/or project manager with an agency determined level of certification. Private industry or contractors are not eligible for FAC-P/PM certification.\n\nWhat is required for FAC-P/PM Certification?\n\nYou can satisfy the competency requirements through successful completion of certification training, completion of comparable education or certification programs, or demonstration of or evidence provided of the required knowledge, skills, and abilities. Additional guidance can be found on this website under the Certification tab/ FAC-P/PM, or through your agency acquisition career manager, or small agency representative (SAR).\n\nWhere do I find courses to begin the certification process?\n\nAcquisition workforce members should register through FAI CSOD and consult their agency acquisition career manager (ACM) or small agency representative (SAR).\n\nCan we use bureau/agency developed courses in lieu of vendor courses or do they need to be approved by FAI first?\n\nYes, if your agency ACM/SAR has determined a course meets training requirements, it can be used to satisfy that coursework area.\n\nIs FAC-P/PM certification sufficient for a project manager in Information Technology (IT)?\n\nThe FAC-P/PM certification policy provides a core-plus specialty certification for P/PMs involved in managing IT projects and programs. There are not ascending levels of certification for this specialty certification, however, to receive the FAC-P/PM/IT specialty certification, the workforce member must first be certified at FAC-P/PM mid-level, have at least two years experience managing IT projects, and meet the performance outcomes in the IT PM competency model.\n\nI have considerable experience in project management. Must I start the certification process at the Entry level?\n\nAchieving each certification level in progression from entry- through senior-level is not required; however, P/PMs may only be certified at a certain level after they achieve all competencies for that certification level. In addition, lower level competencies needed to perform at the level being certified must be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the certifying agency. Contact your acquisition career manager (ACM) or small agency representative (SAR) for certification guidance.\n\nI am being considered for assignment to a “major acquisition/investment.” Must I have my P/PM certification to be given this assignment?\n\nThe policy that established FAC-P/PM states that project and program managers must be senior-level certified for such assignments. However, this certification must be attained within one year of such an assignment – not before you are initially assigned.\n\nWhat happens if I am not able to attain senior-level certification within a year of such an assignment?\n\nThe agency’s Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), or his/her designee, may extend in writing, on a case-by-case basis, the date upon which a P/PM must be certified by an additional 12 months, if it is in the best interest of the agency. Written justification shall be provided that includes the reason for and conditions of the extension, and the agency’s Acquisition Career Manager (ACM), small agency representative (SAR), or designee shall maintain all supporting documentation. Per Dec. 16, 2013, Memo on Revisions to the Federal Acquisition Certification in Program and Project Managers (FAC-P/PM) from OFPP.\n\nI’ve been tasked as a new Program Manager and am not certified. Now what?\n\nAgencies assign personnel to be program and/or project managers and determine the appropriate level of certification they should hold. This is a decision involving the level of risk, complexity, cost and impact of the program to the agency mission. Unless an extension is granted, new program/project managers who are not certified have twelve months from the date of assignment to the project/program to achieve certification. Per Dec. 16, 2013, Memo on Revisions to the Federal Acquisition Certification in Program and Project Managers (FAC-P/PM) from OFPP.\n\nShould certification packages be sent to FAI?\n\nCertification packages are approved at the agency level. Acquisition Workforce members should always contact their agency’s acquisition career manager (ACM) or small agency representative (SAR) with questions concerning certification, continuous learning, and other questions. FAI does not process or approve certification packages or continuous learning.\n\nWhen applicants submit a certification or fulfillment package is there a required form that must be completed?\n\nThe agency provides the application process and template. Contact your acquisition career manager (ACM) or small agency representative (SAR) for certification guidance.\n\nWhy must I meet the FAC-P/PM continuous learning requirements?\n\nFAC-P/PM describes core, minimum competencies that are considered essential for successful program and project management. If you are required by your CAO to attain P/PM certification you must not only acquire these competencies and have a certain number of years of experience associated with each of three levels, you must also earn 80 continuous learning points (CLPs) every two years to maintain the currency of your certification. CLPs are required to maintain a current knowledge base, develop critical thinking abilities, have an awareness of innovations and leading-edge technologies to achieve successful acquisition outcomes. Contact your agency ACM or SAR for more information.\n\nWhat are examples of acceptable skills currency training and continuous learning points?\n\nSee the guidelines for continuous learning. These guidelines reflect best-in-practice recommendations for continuous learning. Agencies retain flexibility and supervisors remain responsible for working with program and project managers to identify those activities and opportunities of greatest benefit to the professional development of an individual. The training, professional activities, education and experience that are used to meet the CLP requirements must be job related.\n\nWho keeps track of my Continuous Learning Points?\n\nIndividuals are responsible for maintaining continuous learning records, and agency ACMs, SARs, or their designees, will monitor the continuous learning requirements to ensure certifications remain active. Continuous Learning progress can be tracked on the Continuous Learning Individual Progress (CLIP) dashboard in the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD) system.\n\nFAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD) FAQs\n\nThe Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) are pleased to announce that we have completed the transition from the Federal Acquisition Institute Training Application System (FAITAS) to the FAI Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), a Defense Acquisition University (DAU) instance of CSOD.\n\nWe understand that, as we all get more comfortable with the new system, the Acquisition Workforce (AWF) at-large will have questions about FAI CSOD. As with all large-scale system changes, we want to ensure all users are informed and have access to answers and information in these FAQs, which are updated frequently.\n\nFAI has partnered with DAU to provide service and support for FAI CSOD.

Keeping your session active or logging back in may overwrite the change you made.\n\nI completed an online training course, but my FAI CSOD transcript is not reflecting a completion status. How do I get this corrected?\n\nIf you completed a CSOD online course and your transcript is not showing a completion status, submit a ticket via the ServiceNow Online Portal with a copy of the Completion Certificate or the completion confirmation email that you received after completing the online course and request an update to your training record.\n\nDAU Help Desk (via ServiceNow Online Portal): https://services.dau.edu/psp?id=public_portal\n\nNOTE: You must provide the Completion Certificate or the completion confirmation email in order for your training record to be updated.\n\nMy FAI CSOD transcript is not reflecting the correct training status (e.g., No Show, Withdraw, Fail) for an instructor-led training session. How do I get this corrected?\n\nIf your transcript shows an inaccurate training status (no show, withdraw, fail) for an instructor led training session, use the table below to contact the Registrar team of the agency that conducted the training session and request an update to your training status.\n\nI am registered for instructor-led training, but I have not received any information about how to access the training. What should I do? Who should I contact?\n\nIf you are registered for instructor-led training (ILT), but you have not received any information about how to access the training, do not wait until the first day of class to contact someone. At least one week before a class begins, you should contact the Registrar team of the agency conducting the training.

They all address the same competencies and job requirements. The difference might be that some agencies prioritize their own employees before allowing others to get a seat, they charge a fee to employees of other agencies, or they conduct the training over different periods of time.\n\nFor example, FCR 201 consists of 40 hours of training. Training sessions might be conducted 8 hours per day over 5 days, 5 hours per day over 8 days, or 4 hours per day over 10 days.\n\nAlways consult your agency’s ACM for training requirements particular to your agency.\n\nFind contact information for your agency’s ACM on the FAI.gov ACM Page.\n\nAm I able to print copies of course completion certificates and acquisition certifications?\n\nYes.

If you need to establish an FAI CSOD account, click here for log-in assistance.\n\nHow many Continuous Learning Points (CLPs) do I need?\n\nTo maintain your FAC-C or FAC-P/PM, you must earn eighty (80) CLPs every two years. To maintain your FAC-COR Level II and III, you must earn forty (40) CLPs every two years (with the exception of Level I CORs, who only require 8 CLPs every two years). This is outlined in the Federal Acquisition Certification guidance for each specialty. Be sure to check with your Agency for additional continuous learning requirements that may be needed.\n\nWhat are examples of acceptable training and activities that would allow me to earn continuous learning points? How much credit can I receive for the different types of training and activities?\n\nContinuous learning opportunities should be used to obtain training in core competencies, maintain critical acquisition skills and obtain agency specific training. Review Continuous Learning FAI.gov. If you have a specific question about a course or activity, please see your agency ACM or SAR.\n\nWhat will happen if I don't meet the required number of training hours every two years?\n\nContracting Officers (COs) may have their warrants suspended or revoked until the CLP requirement is met. CORs may have their appointment suspended or rescinded until their CLP requirement is met. Program/Project Managers may be removed from the program or project.\n\nWhat’s the difference between online training (OLT) and virtual instructor-led training (vILT) and why should I care?\n\nThese names and phrases are for different flavors of online training. It’s important to familiarize yourself with them so you can better understand how to find and register for the training you seek.\n\nOnline Training (OLT) – online training is made up of self-paced, online material (e.g., videos, documents, slides, etc.) available “on demand” 24/7. Students have unlimited attempts to earn 80% or higher on each post assessment within the curriculum to pass the OLT. Students can bypass the course material and proceed directly to the post assessment, but can not jump around on the post assessment exams. Exams must be passed in sequential order.\n\nVirtual Instructor-Led Training (vILT) – vILT classes are essentially classroom training delivered online. They are not “on demand” classes you complete at your pace. They are synchronous which means there are specific times when the instructor and students meet at the same time in structured online settings.\n\nFCN, FCR, FPM, FAC, etc. What do all of these letters mean?\n\nThese are course identification prefixes that federal civilian agencies have agreed to use to make finding the type of training they offer and students seek consistent and easier. Review the table below to get a better understanding of the prefixes used by federal civilian agencies. The Defense Acquisition University uses a slightly different set of IDs for their training courses and continuous learning modules.\n\nPrefixSubjectFACFAI Continuous Learning ModulesFQNAcquisition ManagementFAUAuditingFCECost EstimatingFCMContract ManagementFCNContractingFCRContracting Officer’s Representative (COR)FENEngineeringFEVEarned Value ManagementFFEFacilities EngineeringFFMBusiness, and Financial ManagementFGRGrantsFINIndustrial/Contract Property ManagementFIRInformation Resource ManagementFLDLeadership and DevelopmentFLGLogisticsFMSFacility Management ServicesFPMProgram ManagementFPQProduction, Quality, and ManagementFRQRequirements ManagementFSASoftware Acquisition ManagementFSESystems Planning, Research, Development, and EngineeringFSTScience and Technology ManagementFTETest & Evaluation\n\nWhat are FAI’s policies about their training, attendance policies, wait lists, no shows, etc.?\n\nFAI’s Student Training Guidebook contains all of the policies for participating in FAI-provided training.\n\nCan anyone register for training through FAI?\n\nOnly federal employees can register for training through FAI because FAI training is funded by the Acquisition Workforce Training Fund. Some training resources, like our Acquisition Seminars, Knowledge Nuggets, and Podcasts are available through our Media Library, but the bulk of our assets are only available to federal employees through FAI CSOD.\n\nHow much does training through FAI cost?\n\nFAI training is free. There is no tuition cost to students or their agencies. FAI training is funded by the Acquisition Workforce Training Fund.\n\nCan the Acquisition Workforce Training Fund (AWTF) be used to pay for contractor training?\n\nNo. The AWTF’s statutory purpose is to support the federal acquisition workforce.\n\nThe federal acquisition workforce is defined in the implementing statute 41 U.S.C. § 1703. Section 1703(a) states “for purposes of this section , the acquisition workforce of an agency consists of all employees serving in acquisition positions…” The AWTF is authorized in 41 U.S.C. § 1703(i). Subsection (i)(1) states “the purposes of this subsection are to ensure that the Federal acquisition workforce…” This Subsection authorizing the AWTF specifically uses the term Federal acquisition workforce which, as earlier defined, are employees of an agency, not contractors. Therefore, the AWTF cannot be used to pay for training contractors.\n\nWhen did LinkedIn Learning become available in FAI CSOD?\n\nLinkedIn Learning became available on Jan. 16, 2024.\n\nMy agency does not offer LinkedIn Learning. How will the members of my agency who have an FAI CSOD account complete LinkedIn Learning courses?\n\nFAI purchased LinkedIn Learning licenses for federal workforce members in FAI CSOD. If your agency does not have LinkedIn Learning, they can use these licenses.\n\nHow do my workforce members get access to LinkedIn Learning in FAI CSOD?\n\nThey already have access! They simply need to click on a LinkedIn Learning course to activate their account.\n\nIf my agency purchased LinkedIn Learning for our workforce, should they use FAI licenses?\n\nWe encourage workforce members who have an agency LinkedIn Learning license to use that license.\n\nIf my agency purchased LinkedIn Learning for our workforce, will the training courses they complete in the agency LinkedIn Learning automatically transfer to their FAI CSOD profile?\n\nNo, these are two different LinkedIn Learning accounts. It is not possible to link the accounts at this time. However, users can submit an external continuous learning activity request to have the training they completed in their agency LinkedIn Learning account be added to their FAI CSOD Transcript.\n\nHow many CLPs are granted for LinkedIn Learning courses completed?\n\nCLPs are granted for LinkedIn Learning courses that meet the requirements for CLPs. Some micro learning assets (less than 30 minutes) and/or learning assets that don’t have an assessment have a zero CLP value.\n\nHow can I tell what courses in FAI CSOD are LinkedIn Learning courses?\n\nThe provider for the course will say “LinkedIn Learning.” LinkedIn Learning courses also appear as an “Online Class.\""
