        "text": "Most states and U.S. territories have hate crime statutes that are enforced by state and local law enforcement in state and local courts. Hate crime laws in states and territories vary widely across jurisdictions.\n\nBias motivations: Different jurisdictions define hate crimes to include different bias motivations.\n\nPenalty enhancements: Laws in some jurisdictions increase the sentence for crimes motivated by identified factors.\n\nData collection: Some jurisdictions require collecting data on hate crimes. Data provides better transparency into crimes that are occurring and can help states allocate support and resources to communities in greatest need.\n\nEven if a state or territory does not have a hate crimes law, hate crimes can still be reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nFederal Bias Categories Included by State Laws\n\nFederal laws protect against certain crimes motivated by race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, and disability. The bias categories included in state laws vary. The table below indicates which of the categories included in federal hate crimes laws are included in each state’s laws. State laws may also include additional types of bias not listed on this chart.\n\nKEY: Yes ⚫ | No ◯"
