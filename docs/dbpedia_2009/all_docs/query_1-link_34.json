        "text": "Overview\n\nAd Fontes Media rates Talking Points Memo in the Skews Left category of bias and as Generally Reliable/Analysis OR Other Issues in terms of reliability. Talking Points Memo is a news and opinion website launched in 2000 by journalist and blogger Josh Marshall. It features articles about politics and public policy, with a focus on abuses of power. Talking Points Memo is headquartered in New York City, with a bureau in Washington, D.C.\n\nOverall Score\n\nThe following are the overall bias and reliability scores for Talking Points Memo according to our Ad Fontes Media ratings methodology.\n\nReliability: 37.97\n\nBias: -11.46\n\nPanels of analysts from Ad Fontes Media regularly review representative sample content to rate it for reliability and bias. Each panel of analysts comprises one left-leaning, one right-leaning, and one center-leaning analyst.\n\nThe team considers a variety of factors when rating content. To determine its reliability score, we consider the content’s veracity, expression, its title/headline, and graphics. We add each of these scores to the chart on a weighted scale, with the average of those creating the sample content’s overall reliability score.\n\nTo determine sample content’s bias score, we consider its language, its political position, and how it compares to other reporting or analysis from other sources on the same topic. We add each of these scores to the chart on a weighted scale, with the average of those creating the content’s overall bias score.\n\nThe bias rating, demonstrated on the Media Bias Chart®️ on the horizontal axis, ranges from most extreme left to middle to most extreme right. The reliability rating, demonstrated on the chart’s vertical axis, rates sources on a scale from original fact reporting to analysis, opinion, propaganda and inaccurate/fabricated information.\n\nReliability scores for articles and shows are on a scale of 0-64. Scores above 40 are generally good; scores below 24 are generally problematic. Scores between 24-40 indicate a range of possibilities, with some sources falling there because they are heavy in opinion and analysis, and some because they have a high variation in reliability between articles.\n\nBias scores for articles and shows are on a scale of -42 to +42, with higher negative scores being more left, higher positive scores being more right, and scores closer to zero being minimally biased, equally balanced, or exhibiting a centrist bias.\n\nIndividual Content Sample Scores\n\nThese are the most recent content samples that Ad Fontes Media analysts have rated for this source."
