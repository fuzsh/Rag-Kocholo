        "text": "Critical Thinking on Critical Minerals\n\nThe current planned capacity for lithium processing in the U.S. is on track to meet demand from domestic battery factories. However, current planned capacity for nickel, cobalt, and graphite still fall well short of future demand.\n\nAs temperatures rise, so do energy bills. Energy justice should be a federal priority as the extreme heat crisis exposes energy security gaps.\n\nThe establishment of the Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation (FESI) was a vital first step, but its value depends on what happens next.\n\nHow do you create a tool for all types of users to navigate supply chain issues and logistics problems? With collaboration and innovation.\n\nNot all agricultural education is built the same. Should it be? In a new podcast series, we explore how technical assistance can meet the diverse needs of farmers across local and regional food systems."
