        "text": "As part of fulfilling its mission to safeguard the financial system and promote national security, FinCEN, through its Financial Institution Advisory Program, issues public and non-public advisories to financial institutions concerning money laundering or terrorist financing threats and vulnerabilities for the purpose of enabling financial institutions to guard against such threats. Advisories often contain illicit activity typologies, red flags that facilitate monitoring, and guidance on complying with FinCEN regulations to address those threats and vulnerabilities. Financial institutions may use this information to enhance their Anti-Money Laundering (AML) monitoring systems for more valuable suspicious activity reporting."
