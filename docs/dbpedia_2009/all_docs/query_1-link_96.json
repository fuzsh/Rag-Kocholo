        "text": "WASHINGTON (TND) — U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona is refuting the claim that he fromthe National School Board Association (NSBA).\n\nThe NSBA memo asked for action from the Department of Justice and/or the Federal Bureau of Investigation against those who were threatening school board members and teachers following a string of contentious school board meetings across America.\n\nMost notably, the letter compared protesting parents to \"domestic terrorists,\" sparking outrage. The NSBA later apologized for the memo and took it down, but a copy still remains hosted\n\nThe allegationCardona requested the memo stems from NSBA emails obtained by PDE through a public records request.\n\nShould this allegation be true, it would reveal that this administration's pretextual war on parents came from the highest levels,\" PDE President Nicole Neily said to\n\nWriting in an email to NSBA member Marnie Maldonado in October, NSBA Secretary-Treasurer Kristi Swett says Chip Slaven, who was interim executive director of the NSBA at the time, was \"writing a letter to provide information to the White House, from a request by Secretary Cordona,\" according to the leaked emails.\n\nThe White House and NSBA were also allegedly in communication for weeks before the NSBA's offending memo was released. Emails also allegedly show the memo was being \"prepared\" following a \"meeting with White House staff.\"\n\nAppearing on CBS Mornings on Wednesday,Cardona the allegation when asked about it by anchor Tony Dokoupil.\n\n\"Did you solicit anything from that school board association and should the DOJ and FBI have gotten involved in this at all?\" asksDokoupil.\n\nWe didn't ask for that letter, we didn't... um, I think the real focus should be how do we authentically engage parents and I think moving forward, we have to have a better strategy across the country to listen to parents and to make sure they are engaged in the process,\" Cardona answers. \"But no, specifically with that letter we had no... we didn't request that... there was no involvement in that.\n\nFollowing up on his question,Dokoupil asks if Cardona agreed with FBI and DOJ involvement.\n\n\"I believe any threats toward any elected official is unacceptable and whatever steps need to be taken to make sure that doesn't happen, should be,\" Cardona answers. \"Because I know, especially across the country, our board members are often volunteers who want to help their community and they should be protected.\"\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland and the DOJ with Cardona, asserting in their own memo“threats against public servants are not only illegal, they run counter to our nation's core values.”\n\nGarland, in the DOJ memo, called upon the FBI to \"use its authority\" against those who use violence, or threaten to use violence, against school boards and teachers.\n\nConservative watchdog group Judicial Watch against the DOJ, seeking what, if anything, the federal government did in response to Garland's memo.\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton, along with other critics, saw Garland's memo as politically motivated, targeting parents who were opponents to critical race theory.\n\n“The Biden administration wants to target parents as ‘terrorists’ by abusing the FBI and DOJ to intimidate parents who oppose the racist and anti-American critical race theory agenda,” said Fitton. “And now Judicial Watch had to file a federal FOIA lawsuit because the agencies are in cover-up mode over this shocking abuse of power.”"
