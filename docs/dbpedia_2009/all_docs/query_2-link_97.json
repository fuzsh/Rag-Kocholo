        "text": "The Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (ODASD), Environmental Management & Restoration (EM&R), launched the Department of Defense (DoD) Environmental Cleanup Communication and Outreach (ECCO) Initiative in the fall of 2022 to enhance dialogue and communication with community residents, Restoration Advisory Board (RAB) members, environmental regulators, and other stakeholders. A priority of the ECCO Initiative is to examine the effectiveness of existing dialogue and communication methods currently used across the military departments and throughout the environmental cleanup process with RABs, community outreach events, and print, web, and social media. DoD intends to use lessons learned and the findings from the initiative to inform best management practices and develop communication tools that DoD personnel can implement to better convey environmental cleanup information to the public and affected communities.\n\nThe ECCO Initiative includes installation visits and in-person attendance at Restoration Advisory Boards and other public forums by DoD personnel, and one-on-one interviews with community members and stakeholders in which participants are voluntarily asked communication related questions. The following installations visits are planned or in progress thus far:\n\nFormer Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove and Biddle Air National Guard Base, Pennsylvania (15-16 March 2023)\n\nDavis-Monthan Air Force Base and Morris Air National Guard Base, Arizona (18-19 April 2023)\n\nFort Monroe, Virginia (3-4 May 2023)\n\nCamp Grayling Joint Maneuver Training Center, Michigan (16 May 2023)\n\nFormer Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan (17-18 May 2023)\n\nPease Air National Guard Base and Former Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire (20-21 July 2023)\n\nFort Devens, Massachusetts (30-31 August 2023)\n\nNaval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington (17-18 October 2023)\n\nInput will help DoD:"
