It can appear as practices within an institution or accepted social norms. Since whiteness works almost invisibly, we may not always be aware of how it manifests in our daily lives. Thinking critically about your social conditioning and the values you have adopted as fact, ask yourself:\n\nWhat are some aspects of whiteness you’ve internalized?\n\nHow can these be hurtful to you and others?\n\nWhat are some ways you plan on combating them?"
