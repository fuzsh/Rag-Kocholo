        "text": "WASHINGTON (TND) — Following a string of contentious school board meetings across America involving parents upset over critical race theory, theNational School Board Association (NSBA) sent a letter to President Joe Biden, asking for action against those who were threatening school board members and teachers.\n\nMost notably, the letter compared protesting parents to\"domestic terrorists,\" sparking outrage among parents who were lawfully and peacefully attending school board meetings to voice their concerns about public education in their communities.\n\nNow, according to NSBA emails obtained byParents Defending Education (PDE) through a public records request,Education Secretary Miguel Cardona the memo.\n\nWriting in an email to NSBA memberMarnie Maldonado in October,NSBA Secretary-Treasurer Kristi Swett says Chip Slaven, who was interim executive director of the NSBA at the time, was \"writing a letter to provide information to the White House, from a request by Secretary Cordona,\" according to the leaked emails.\n\nThe obtained emails allegedly show collaboration between the NSBA, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Education when it comes to the NSBA's desire for the government to intervene.\n\nThe White House and NSBA were also allegedly in communication for weeks before the NSBA's offending memo was released. Emails also allegedly show the memo was being \"prepared\" following a \"meeting with White House staff\".\n\nShould this allegation be true, it would reveal that this administration's pretextual war on parents came from the highest levels,\" PDE President Nicole Neily said to\n\nThe NSBA said in its memo, “America’s public schools and its education leaders are under an immediate threat,” and asked for“federal law enforcement and other assistance to deal with the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation.”\n\nThe Biden administration was asked by the NSBA to use statutes, such as the Patriot Act, to stop the threats and violence directed at schools considered to be“the equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.\"\n\nThe NSBA later apologized for the memo and took it down, but a copy still remains hosted\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland , and the DOJ released which asserted, “threats against public servants are not only illegal, they run counter to our nation's core values.”\n\nGarland, in his memo, called upon the Federal Bureau of Investigation to \"use its authority\" against those who use violence, or threaten to use violence, against school boards and teachers.\n\nA conservative watchdog group against the DOJ, seeking what, if anything, the federal government did in response to Garland's memo.\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton, along with other critics, saw Garland's memo as politically motivated, targeting parents who were opponents to critical race theory.\n\n“The Biden administration wants to target parents as ‘terrorists’ by abusing the FBI and DOJ to intimidate parents who oppose the racist and anti-American critical race theory agenda,” said Fitton. “And now Judicial Watch had to file a federal FOIA lawsuit because the agencies are in cover-up mode over this shocking abuse of power.”"
