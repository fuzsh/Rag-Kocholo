        "text": "NPR has formally punished Uri Berliner, the senior editor who publicly argued a week ago that the network had \"lost America's trust\" by approaching news stories with a rigidly progressive mindset.\n\nBerliner's five-day suspension without pay, which began last Friday, has not been previously reported.\n\nYet the public radio network is grappling in other ways with the fallout from Berliner's essay for the online news site The Free Press. It angered many of his colleagues, led NPR leaders to announce monthly internal reviews of the network's coverage, and gave fresh ammunition to conservative and partisan Republican critics of NPR, including former President Donald Trump.\n\nConservative activist Christopher Rufo is among those now targeting NPR's new chief executive, Katherine Maher, for messages she posted to social media years before joining the network. Among others, those posts include a 2020 tweet that called Trump racist and another that appeared to minimize rioting during social justice protests that year. Maher took the job at NPR last month â€” her first at a news organization.\n\nIn a statement Monday about the messages she had posted, Maher praised the integrity of NPR's journalists and underscored the independence of their reporting.\n\n\"In America everyone is entitled to free speech as a private citizen,\" she said. \"What matters is NPR's work and my commitment as its CEO: public service, editorial independence, and the mission to serve all of the American public. NPR is independent, beholden to no party, and without commercial interests.\"\n\nThe network noted that \"the CEO is not involved in editorial decisions.\"\n\nIn an interview with me later on Monday, Berliner said the social media posts demonstrated Maher was all but incapable of being the person best poised to direct the organization.\n\n\"We're looking for a leader right now who's going to be unifying and bring more people into the tent and have a broader perspective on, sort of, what America is all about,\" Berliner said. \"And this seems to be the opposite of that.\"\n\nHe said that he tried repeatedly to make his concerns over NPR's coverage known to news leaders and to Maher's predecessor as chief executive before publishing his essay.\n\nBerliner has singled out coverage of several issues dominating the 2020s for criticism, including trans rights, the Israel-Hamas war and COVID. Berliner says he sees the same problems at other news organizations, but argues NPR, as a mission-driven institution, has a greater obligation to fairness.\n\n\"I love NPR and feel it's a national trust,\" Berliner says. \"We have great journalists here. If they shed their opinions and did the great journalism they're capable of, this would be a much more interesting and fulfilling organization for our listeners.\"\n\nA \"final warning\"\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the interview were singular.\n\nBerliner provided me with a copy of the formal rebuke to review. NPR did not confirm or comment upon his suspension for this article.\n\nIn presenting Berliner's suspension Thursday afternoon, the organization told the editor he had failed to secure its approval for outside work for other news outlets, as is required of NPR journalists. It called the letter a \"final warning,\" saying Berliner would be fired if he violated NPR's policy again. Berliner is a dues-paying member of NPR's newsroom union but says he is not appealing the punishment.\n\nThe Free Press is a site that has become a haven for journalists who believe that mainstream media outlets have become too liberal. In addition to his essay, Berliner appeared in an episode of its podcast Honestly with Bari Weiss.\n\nA few hours after the essay appeared online, NPR chief business editor Pallavi Gogoi reminded Berliner of the requirement that he secure approval before appearing in outside press, according to a copy of the note provided by Berliner.\n\nIn its formal rebuke, NPR did not cite Berliner's appearance on Chris Cuomo's NewsNation program last Tuesday night, for which NPR gave him the green light. (NPR's chief communications officer told Berliner to focus on his own experience and not share proprietary information.) The NPR letter also did not cite his remarks to The New York Times, which ran its article mid-afternoon Thursday, shortly before the reprimand was sent. Berliner says he did not seek approval before talking with the Times.\n\nBerliner says he did not get permission from NPR to speak with me for this story but that he was not worried about the consequences: \"Talking to an NPR journalist and being fired for that would be extraordinary, I think.\"\n\nBerliner is a member of NPR's business desk, as am I, and he has helped to edit many of my stories. He had no involvement in the preparation of this article and did not see it before it was posted publicly.\n\nIn rebuking Berliner, NPR said he had also publicly released proprietary information about audience demographics, which it considers confidential. He said those figures \"were essentially marketing material. If they had been really good, they probably would have distributed them and sent them out to the world.\"\n\nFeelings of anger and betrayal inside the newsroom\n\nHis essay and subsequent public remarks stirred deep anger and dismay within NPR. Colleagues contend Berliner cherry-picked examples to fit his arguments and challenge the accuracy of his accounts. They also note he did not seek comment from the journalists involved in the work he cited.\n\nMorning Edition host Michel Martin told me some colleagues at the network share Berliner's concerns that coverage is frequently presented through an ideological or idealistic prism that can alienate listeners.\n\n\"The way to address that is through training and mentorship,\" says Martin, herself a veteran of nearly two decades at the network who has also reported for The Wall Street Journal and ABC News. \"It's not by blowing the place up, by trashing your colleagues, in full view of people who don't really care about it anyway.\"\n\nSeveral NPR journalists told me they are no longer willing to work with Berliner as they no longer have confidence that he will keep private their internal musings about stories as they work through coverage.\n\n\"Newsrooms run on trust,\" NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben tweeted last week, without mentioning Berliner by name. \"If you violate everyone's trust by going to another outlet and sh--ing on your colleagues (while doing a bad job journalistically, for that matter), I don't know how you do your job now.\"\n\nBerliner rejected that critique, saying nothing in his essay or subsequent remarks betrayed private observations or arguments about coverage.\n\nOther newsrooms are also grappling with questions over news judgment and confidentiality. On Monday, New York Times Executive Editor Joseph Kahn announced to his staff that the newspaper's inquiry into who leaked internal dissent over a planned episode of its podcast The Daily to another news outlet proved inconclusive. The episode was to focus on a December report on the use of sexual assault as part of the Hamas attack on Israel in October. Audio staffers aired doubts over how well the reporting stood up to scrutiny.\n\n\"We work together with trust and collegiality everyday on everything we produce, and I have every expectation that this incident will prove to be a singular exception to an important rule,\" Kahn wrote to Times staffers.\n\nAt NPR, some of Berliner's colleagues have weighed in online against his claim that the network has focused on diversifying its workforce without a concomitant commitment to diversity of viewpoint. Recently retired Chief Executive John Lansing has referred to this pursuit of diversity within NPR's workforce as its \"North Star,\" a moral imperative and chief business strategy.\n\nIn his essay, Berliner tagged the strategy as a failure, citing the drop in NPR's broadcast audiences and its struggle to attract more Black and Latino listeners in particular.\n\n\"During most of my tenure here, an open-minded, curious culture prevailed. We were nerdy, but not knee-jerk, activist, or scolding,\" Berliner writes. \"In recent years, however, that has changed.\"\n\nBerliner writes, \"For NPR, which purports to consider all things, it's devastating both for its journalism and its business model.\"\n\nNPR investigative reporter Chiara Eisner wrote in a comment for this story: \"Minorities do not all think the same and do not report the same. Good reporters and editors should know that by now. It's embarrassing to me as a reporter at NPR that a senior editor here missed that point in 2024.\"\n\nSome colleagues drafted a letter to Maher and NPR's chief news executive, Edith Chapin, seeking greater clarity on NPR's standards for its coverage and the behavior of its journalists â€” clearly pointed at Berliner.\n\nA plan for \"healthy discussion\"\n\nOn Friday, CEO Maher stood up for the network's mission and the journalism, taking issue with Berliner's critique, though never mentioning him by name. Among her chief issues, she said Berliner's essay offered \"a criticism of our people on the basis of who we are.\"\n\nBerliner took great exception to that, saying she had denigrated him. He said that he supported diversifying NPR's workforce to look more like the U.S. population at large. She did not address that in a subsequent private exchange he shared with me for this story. (An NPR spokesperson declined further comment.)\n\nLate Monday afternoon, Chapin announced to the newsroom that Executive Editor Eva Rodriguez would lead monthly meetings to review coverage.\n\n\"Among the questions we'll ask of ourselves each month: Did we capture the diversity of this country â€” racial, ethnic, religious, economic, political geographic, etc â€” in all of its complexity and in a way that helped listeners and readers recognize themselves and their communities?\" Chapin wrote in the memo. \"Did we offer coverage that helped them understand â€” even if just a bit better â€” those neighbors with whom they share little in common?\"\n\nBerliner said he welcomed the announcement but would withhold judgment until those meetings played out.\n\nIn a text for this story, Chapin said such sessions had been discussed since Lansing unified the news and programming divisions under her acting leadership last year.\n\n\"Now seemed [the] time to deliver if we were going to do it,\" Chapin said. \"Healthy discussion is something we need more of.\"\n\nDisclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by Deputy Business Editor Emily Kopp and Managing Editor Gerry Holmes. Under NPR's protocol for reporting on itself, no NPR corporate official or news executive reviewed this story before it was posted publicly."
