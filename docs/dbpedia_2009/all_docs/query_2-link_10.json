I need help un-redacting a set of documents I just received from the agency, related to its legal work on the trillion-dollar platinum coin. If you’re not already getting FOIA Files in your inbox, sign up here.\n\nAhhhhh, the trillion-dollar-coin. It’s the bête noir of some economists who see such a thing as, at best, a harebrained thought experiment. It’s an economic elixir for others who view it as a way to circumvent the unhealthy cycle of national debt crises."
