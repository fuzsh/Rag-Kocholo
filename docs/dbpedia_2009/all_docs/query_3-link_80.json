Federal funding agencies have sought to clarify longstanding policies and issued new guidance. Federal law enforcement agencies have increased prosecutorial activity in unison with the federal funding agencies, and Congress has signed new legislation and sought information on how the academic research community is responding to this evolving issue.\n\nThe primary thrust of the USG’s concerns fall into four buckets:\n\nPeer review violations\n\nFailure to disclose substantial foreign resources:\n\nForeign employment arrangements\n\nForeign grant support that creates problems with overlap, or over-commitment\n\nNon-disclosure of substantial foreign research support\n\nfree labor (visiting scholar/student funded by a foreign source)\n\nTalents awards\n\nForeign grants – Hidden transfers of information, know-how, data, person-time\n\nFailure to disclose significant foreign financial Conflict of Interest:\n\nEquity in foreign companies\n\nForeign patents that leverage US tax-payer funded work\n\nCompliance with Regulatory Requirements: U.S. Export Control laws and regulations establish a set of requirements for the transfer of technology and data to foreign countries and/or foreign nationals in the U.S and sanctions from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) restrict interactions with individuals or entities on the sanctions list.\n\nThe Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) provides some examples of behaviors that can increase risk and harm the research enterprise.\n\nCommunications, Guidance, Regulations, and Policies from Federal Agencies and USG\n\nThe federal funding agencies, Congress, the federal agencies, and the White House have all issued some form of communication, guidance, new regulations or policies related to dealing with the issue of undue foreign influences on research integrity. Likewise, Higher Education Organizations such as the American Council on Education have issued briefings and position papers on this topic. Below you will find a list of source documents from each agency or organization.\n\nNational Institutes of Health [NIH]\n\nIn August 2018, Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Francis Collins issued a Foreign Influence Letter to Grantees and testified to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee regarding concerns about systematic programs of foreign influence in U.S. research.\n\nNIH Protecting U.S. Biomedical Intellectual Innovation WebPage [NEW 7.16.2020]\n\nNIH and the biomedical research enterprise have a long history of International collaborations with rules of engagement that allow science to advance while also protecting intellectual capital and proprietary information of the participating countries. These rules of engagement also are designed to limit bias in the design, conduct, and reporting of NIH-supported research. This page describes actions that NIH, institutions, and researchers can take to protect U.S. biomedical intellectual innovation. The principles described here align with those announced by the White House's Office and Science and Technology Policy in June 2020.\n\nNIH Director Collins Dear Colleague Foreign Influence Letter\n\nIn December 2018 and June 2019, the NIH Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD) released a report entitled ACD Working Group for Foreign Influences on Research Integrity identifying recommendations around communication and awareness; risk mitigation; and monitoring, actions, and consequences.\n\nNIH Advisory Committee to the Director Foreign Influence Report June 2019\n\nNIH Advisory Committee to the Director Foreign Influence Report December 2018\n\nIn July, NIH issued NOT-OD-19-114 clarifying and reminding the research community of NIH policies on Other Support and Foreign Components.\n\nReminders of NIH Policies on Other Support and on Policies related to Financial Conflicts of Interest and Foreign Components NOT-OD-19-114 July 10, 2019\n\nFrequently Asked Questions Other Support and Foreign Components Initial Posting: June 19, 2019\n\nNational Science Foundation [NSF]\n\nNSF Commissioned JASON Report\n\nNSF commissioned the report to enhance the agency’s understanding of the threats to basic research posed by foreign governments that have taken actions that violate the principles of scientific ethics and research integrity. With the official receipt of the report, NSF will now begin the process of analyzing its findings and recommendations.\n\nNEWS ALERT: US National Science Foundation reveals first details on foreign-influence investigations [NEW July 2020] https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02051-8\n\n“The US National Science Foundation (NSF) has for the first time released figures on the actions it has taken against researchers found to have violated rules on the disclosure of foreign ties. Since 2018, the agency has reassigned, suspended or terminated grants, forced institutions to return funds or barred researchers from applying for future funding in 16–20 cases in which rules weren’t followed, according to Rebecca Keiser, the agency’s first chief of research security strategy and policy. All of these were cases in which the NSF’s Office of Inspector General, an independent body responsible for oversight of the agency and its grant recipients, had investigated and made recommendations on how to handle sanctions. Separately, the inspector-general referred an undisclosed number of criminal and civil cases involving fraud and nondisclosure to the US Department of Justice. Furthermore, in the past two months, seven universities have contacted the NSF directly with information on faculty members who might have violated rules.”\n\nNSF- Statement of The National Science Board on Security and Science October 23, 2018 NSB-2018-42\n\nProposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide January 2020\n\nNSF Dear Colleague Research Protection Letter 7.11.19\n\nThe NSF Dear Colleague letter outlined a few steps it is taking to mitigate the risks in concert with other agencies and stakeholders. Highlights from the letter:\n\nCitizenship Requirements\n\nTo ensure that NSF is applying consistent standards to all staff members, each of whom has access to sensitive merit review and other information, we issued a requirement in April 2018 that rotators working onsite at NSF must be U.S. citizens or have applied for U.S. citizenship.\n\nDisclosure Requirements\n\nSince 1978, NSF has required senior project personnel on proposals to disclose all sources of support, both foreign and domestic.\n\nProposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide\n\nA renewed effort is now underway to ensure that existing requirements to disclose current and pending support information are known, understood, and followed.\n\nFor example, in May, we published in the Federal Register a proposed clarification of our proposal disclosure requirements (open for public comment through July 29). Our draft NSF Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide includes clarifications regarding reporting requirements for both current and pending support and professional appointments.\n\nTo streamline the process for providing these disclosures to NSF, we are proposing use of an electronic format for submission of biographical sketches, including disclosure of all appointments. As currently envisioned, this will become effective in January 2020. We are also working to develop an electronic format for disclosure of current and pending support information.\n\nForeign Government Talent Programs\n\nFinally, we are issuing a policy making it clear that NSF personnel and IPAs detailed to NSF cannot participate in foreign government talent recruitment programs. There is a risk that participation in foreign government talent recruitment programs by NSF personnel and IPAs will compromise the ethical principles that bind us. Moreover, such participation poses significant risks of inappropriate foreign influence on NSF policies, programs, and priorities, including the integrity of NSF's merit review process—risks we simply cannot accept.\n\nDepartment of Energy [DOE]\n\nDOE Directive O 486.1A, Foreign Government Sponsored or Affiliated Activities September 4, 2020\n\nTo ensure the continued flow of scientific and technical information consistent with the Department of Energy’s (DOE) broad scientific mission, while also ensuring protection of U.S. competitive and national security interests and DOE program objectives; preventing potential conflicts of interest, e.g., financial interests, conflicts of commitment, and outside employment, which may undermine the DOE research enterprise; and limiting unauthorized transfers of scientific and technical information. Cancels DOE O 486.1, dated 6-7-2019.\n\nScience Article on DOE Policies February 8, 2019\n\nDOE Directive regarding Foreign Government Talent Recruitment, June 7, 2019\n\nDOE Order 486.1: \"To ensure the continued flow of scientific and technical information consistent with the Department of Energy’s (DOE) broad scientific mission, while also ensuring protection of U.S. competitive and national security interests and DOE program objectives; and limiting unauthorized transfers of scientific and technical information.\"\n\nDepartment of Defense [DOD]\n\nDepartment of Defense Letter raising awareness of efforts to combat foreign influences on research integrity. The letter highlights the efforts of JCORE - Joint Committee on the Research Environment\n\n\"In his September 16, 2019. letter to the research community. Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), described a new OSTP-led interagency Joint Committee on the Research Environment (JCORE).\n\nDoD is an active participant in JCORE, and in its sub-committee on Research Security, which is initially focused on coordinating four lines of Federal effort:\n\ncoordinating outreach and engagement\n\ndisclosure requirements for participation in federally funded research\n\nbest practices for academic research institutions\n\nmethods for identification, assessment, and management of risk\n\nThis work will help agencies that fund Federal research to develop common standards for identifying and adjudicating conflicts of interest and conflicts of commitment from these disclosures. It will also help agencies that fund Federal research to clarify consequences for failing to make these disclosures.\"\n\nDepartment of Defense Memo - Actions for the Protection of Intellectual Property, Controlled Information, Key Personnel and Critical March 20, 2019\n\n“The National Defense Authorization Act (NOAA) for FY 2019, Section 1286, pages 443- 445, directs the Secretary of Defense to establish an initiative to work with academic institutions who perform defense research and engineering activities: 1. To support protection of intellectual property, controlled information, key personnel, and information about critical technologies relevant to national security; and 2. To limit undue influence, including through foreign talent programs, by countries to exploit United States technology within the Department of Defense research, science and technology, and innovation enterprise.”\n\nProhibition on Procurement of Foreign-Made Unmanned Aircraft Systems [DARS Tracking Number: 2020-O0015] [May 29, 2020]\n\nEffective immediately, unless an exception applies or a waiver is granted, contracting officers shall not enter into or renew a contract for the procurement of—\n\nAn unmanned aircraft system (UAS), or any related services or equipment, that—\n\no Is manufactured in the People’s Republic of China or by an entity domiciled in the People’s Republic of China;\n\no Uses flight controllers, radios, data transmission devices, cameras, or gimbals manufactured in the People’s Republic of China or by an entity domiciled in the People’s Republic of China;\n\no Uses a ground control system or operating software developed in the People’s Republic of China or by an entity domiciled in the People’s Republic of China; or\n\no Uses network connectivity or data storage located in, or administered by an entity domiciled in, the People’s Republic of China; or\n\nA system for the detection or identification of a UAS, or any related services or equipment, that is manufactured—\n\no In the People’s Republic of China; or\n\no By an entity domiciled in the People’s Republic of China.\n\nThis prohibition does not apply to procurements for the purposes of: counter-UAS surrogate testing and training; or intelligence, electronic warfare, and information warfare operations, testing, analysis, and training.\n\nThis class deviation implements the procurement prohibition under section 848 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Pub. L. 116-92).\n\nDepartment of State [DOS]\n\nThe State Department has issued a new determination under the Foreign Missions Act, requiring members of the Chinese diplomatic corps to notify the State Department when making visits to educational and research institutions, among other entities.\n\nThe Department’s determination requires U.S.-based personnel of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) foreign missions (including personnel at the embassy and consulates of the PRC and those on temporary assignments conducting official business for the PRC government) to notify the State Department’s Office of Foreign Missions in advance of:\n\n- Official visits to educational institutions\n\n- Official visits to research institutions, including National Labs\n\n- Official meetings with state officials\n\n- Official meetings with local and municipal officials\n\nChinese diplomats only need to inform the Department of these types of meetings. They do not need the State Department’s permission to visit educational institutions. The State Department indicated that the PRC government has chosen to prevent American diplomats from gaining access to Chinese campuses for educational and cultural programming, including programs that encourage students to study at American educational institutions. The new policy for PRC officials is a result of this situation.\n\nNYT Article Under New Rule, Chinese Diplomats Must Notify State Dept. of Meetings in U.S.\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA]\n\nGic 12-01 Class Deviation Implementing Nasa Restrictions On Funding Activities With The People's Republic Of China (Prc) Effective April 25, 2011\n\n“NASA is restricted by specific applications of Section 1340(a) of The Department of Defense and Full-Year Appropriations Act, Public Law 112-10 (NASA's 2011 continuing resolution), and Section 539 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriation Act of 2012, Public Law 112-55 (NASA's FY 2012 appropriation) from using funding appropriated in the Acts to enter into or fund any grant or cooperative agreement of any kind to participate, collaborate, or coordinate bilaterally in any way with China or any Chinese-owned company, at the prime recipient level or at any subrecipient level, whether the bilateral involvement is funded or performed under a no-exchange of funds arrangement.”\n\nSenate and NIH Correspondence\n\nSen.

In addition, Congress, NIH, and Federal intelligence agencies have raised concerns about foreign threats to the integrity of U.S. medical research and intellectual property at institutions of higher education. Our objective will be to determine whether institutions of higher education (1) managed NIH awards to ensure allowability of costs in accordance with Federal and award requirements, and (2) met Federal conflict-of-interest requirements.\n\nhttps://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/summary/wp-summary-0000467.asp\n\n\"The National Institutes of Health Has Limited Policies, Procedures, and Controls in Place for Helping To Ensure That Institutions Report All Sources of Research Support, Financial Interests, and Affiliations\"\n\nSeptember 25, 2019 Audit (A-03-19-03003)\n\nhttps://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/oas/nih.asp\n\nSTAT Article \"NIH must better protect research from foreign influence, federal watchdog says\"\n\nHigher Education Organizations Science and Security Resources\n\nAssociation of American Universities Science and Security Resource Document\n\nAssociation of Public & Land-Grant Universities [APLU] and Association of American Universities [AAU] Actions Taken by Universities to Address Science and Security Concerns\n\nFederal Law Enforcement Activity\n\nHarvard Chemistry Chair Placed on Leave After Federal Gov.

UC and its primary funders of sponsored research urge you, in the strongest terms possible, to disclose information about any and all other support, foreign components, or current and pending support, whether it’s provided through an organization or directly to you as an individual, as well as reporting all projects and activities that require a time commitment. Below we highlight a few of the notices from NIH and NSF on the importance of full disclosure.\n\nNIH [PHS]\n\nSee NIH NOT-OD-21-073, NIH NOT-OD-19-114, NIH FAQs Other Support, Foreign Components, FCOI\n\nOther Support\n\nOther Support includes all resources made available to a researcher in support of and/or related to all of their research endeavors, regardless of whether or not they have monetary value and regardless of whether they are based at the institution the researcher identifies for the current grant. This includes but is not limited to:\n\nResources and/or financial support from all foreign and domestic entities, that are available to the researcher. This includes but is not limited to, financial support for laboratory personnel, and provision of high-value materials that are not freely available (e.g., biologics, chemical, model systems, technology, etc.). Institutional resources, such as core facilities or shared equipment that are made broadly available, should not be included in Other Support, but rather listed under Facilities and Other Resources.\n\nConsulting agreements, when the PD/PI or other senior/key personnel will be conducting research as part of the consulting activities. Non-research consulting activities are not Other Support.\n\nIn-kind contributions, e.g. office/laboratory space, equipment, supplies, or employees or students supported by an outside source.

When a recipient organization discovers that a PI or other Senior/Key personnel on an active NIH grant failed to disclose Other Support information outside of Just-in-Time or the RPPR, as applicable, the recipient must submit updated Other Support to the Grants Management Specialist named in the Notice of Award as soon as it becomes known.\n\nProgram Director/Principal Investigator or Other Senior/Key Personnel must sign the Other Support document to certify the accuracy of the information submitted. Each PD/PI or senior/key personnel must electronically sign their respective Other Support form as a PDF prior to submission.\n\nNote: NIH will require the above in January 2022.\n\nWhat to disclose?\n\nNIH Applicants must:\n\nList all positions and scientific appointments both domestic and foreign-held by senior/key personnel that are relevant to an application including affiliations with foreign entities or governments. This includes titled academic, professional, or institutional appointments whether or not remuneration is received, and whether full-time, part-time, or voluntary (including adjunct, visiting, or honorary).\n\nReport all resources and other support for all individuals designated in an application as senior/key personnel – including for the program director/principal investigator (PD/PI) and for other individuals who contribute to the scientific development or execution of a project in a substantive, measurable way, whether or not they request salaries or compensation. Information must be provided about all current support for ongoing projects, irrespective of whether such support is provided through the applicant organization, through another domestic or foreign organization, or is provided directly to an individual that supports the senior/key personnel’s research efforts.\n\nReport all current projects and activities that involve senior/key personnel, even if the support received is only in-kind (e.g. office/laboratory space, equipment, supplies, employees). All research resources including, but not limited to, foreign financial support, research or laboratory personnel, lab space, scientific materials, selection to a foreign “talents” or similar-type program, or other foreign or domestic support must be reported.\n\nProvide the total award amount for the entire award period covered (including facilities and administrative costs), as well as the number of person-months (or partial person-months) per year to be devoted to the project by the senior/key personnel involved.\n\nWhen to disclose?\n\nAll pending support at the time of application submission and prior to award must be reported using “Just-in-Time Procedures” by providing all information indicated above. Applicants are responsible for promptly notifying NIH of any substantive changes to previously submitted Just-in-Time information up to the time of award, including “Other Support” changes that must be assessed for budgetary or scientific overlap. Further, if other support, as described as above, is obtained after the initial NIH award period, from any source either through the institution or directly to senior/key personnel, the details must be disclosed in the annual research performance progress report (RPPR). Post-award, recipients must address any substantive changes by submitting a prior approval request to NIH in accordance with the NIHGPS section on “Administrative Requirements—Changes in Project and Budget—NIH Standard Terms of Award.”\n\nForeign Components\n\nWhat to disclose?\n\nNIH requires recipients to determine whether activities it supports include a foreign component, defined as: The existence of any “significant scientific element or segment of a project” outside of the United States, in other words\n\nperformance of work by a researcher or recipient in a foreign location, whether or not NIH grant funds are expended and/or\n\nperformance of work by a researcher in a foreign location employed or paid for by a foreign organization, whether or not NIH grant funds are expended.\n\nIf a recipient determines that a portion of the project will be conducted outside of the U.S., the recipient then will need to determine if the activities are considered significant. If both criteria are met, then there is a foreign component. To aide with what may be considered significant, click on the FAQ link below.\n\nWhen to disclose?\n\nThe addition of a foreign component to an ongoing NIH grant continues to require NIH prior approval, as outlined in the NIHGPS, Section 8.1.2 , Prior Approval Requirements.\n\nNote: If an activity does not meet the definition of foreign component because all research is being conducted within the United States, but there is a non-U.S. resource that supports the research of an investigator and/or researcher, it must be reported as other support. For example, if a PD/PI of an NIH-funded grant has a collaborator outside of the U.S. who performs experiments in support of the PD/PI’s NIH-funded project, this would constitute a foreign component, regardless of whether the foreign collaborator receives funding from the PD/PI’s grant. Additional funding from a foreign source for the NIH-supported research of a PD/PI at a U.S. institution would not constitute a foreign component but would necessitate reporting as other support.\n\nNSF\n\nSee Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide: NSF Comments on Current and Pending Support Page II-23 June 2020\n\nCurrent and Pending Support\n\nNote: The requirement to use an NSF-approved format for preparation of current and pending support will go into effect for new proposals submitted or due on or after October 5, 2020. In the interim, proposers must continue to prepare this document in accordance with the guidance specified in the PAPPG (NSF 20-1). NSF, however, encourages the community to use the NSF-approved formats and provide valuable feedback as we enhance them for the October implementation.\n\nCurrent and pending support information must be separately provided through use of an NSF-approved format, for each individual designated as senior personnel on the proposal. Current and pending support includes all resources made available to an individual in support of and/or related to all of his/her research efforts, regardless of whether or not they have monetary value. Current and pending support also includes in-kind contributions (such as office/laboratory space, equipment, supplies, employees, students. In-kind contributions not intended for use on the project/proposal being proposed also must be reported .\n\nCurrent and pending support information must be provided for the proposed project, for ongoing projects, and for any proposals currently under consideration from whatever source , irrespective of whether such support is provided through the proposing organization or is provided directly to the individual.\n\nThe total award amount for the entire award period covered (including indirect costs) must be provided, as well as the number of person-months (or partial person-months) per year to be devoted to the project by the individual.\n\nConcurrent submission of a proposal to other organizations will not prejudice its review by NSF, if disclosed. If the project (or any part of the project) now being submitted has been funded previously by a source other than NSF, information must be provided regarding the last period of funding.\n\nFacilities, Equipment and Other Resources\n\nThe Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources document assesses the adequacy of the resources available to perform the effort proposed to satisfy both the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts review criteria. Proposers should describe only those resources that are directly applicable. Proposers should include an aggregated description of the internal and external resources (both physical and personnel) that the organization and its collaborators will provide to the project, should it be funded. Such information must be provided in this section, in lieu of other parts of the proposal (e.g., Budget Justification, Project Description). The description should be narrative in nature and must not include any quantifiable financial information. Reviewers will evaluate the information during the merit review process and the cognizant NSF Program Officer will review it for programmatic and technical sufficiency.\n\nAlthough these resources are not considered voluntary committed cost sharing as defined in 2 CFR § 200.99, the Foundation does expect that the resources identified in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section will be provided, or made available, should the proposal be funded. Chapter VII.B.1 specifies procedures for use by the grantee when there are postaward changes to objectives, scope or methods/procedures.\n\nUC and Sponsor Policies\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nDefinitions:\n\nA Financial Conflict of Interest exists when the Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines that an Investigator’s Significant Financial Interest is related to a NIH-funded research project and could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct or reporting of the NIH-funded research.\n\n\"A conflict of interest in research exists when the individual has interests in the outcome of the research that may lead to a personal advantage and that might, therefore, in actuality or appearance compromise the integrity of the research.\" NAS, Integrity in Scientific Research\n\nRelevant UC and Sponsor Policies\n\nUC NSF Policy\n\nUC NIH (PHS) Policy\n\nInstitutional Conflicts of Interest RPAC Memo 11-05\n\n45 CFR Part 50\n\nFinancial Conflict of Interest NOT-OD-18-160 Investigator Disclosures of Foreign Interests\n\nConflict of Commitment\n\nA conflict of commitment occurs when a faculty member’s outside activities interfere with the faculty member’s professional obligations to the University of California.\n\nRelevant UC Policies\n\nAPM 025\n\n“Conflict of Commitment and Outside Activities of Faculty Members” This policy defines which outside professional activities must be disclosed to the University, approved prior to engagement, and/or reported annually. This policy limits the amount of time a faculty member may devote to outside professional activities and describes the requirements when involving a student in outside professional activities. It defines activities as Category I, II, or III, and includes a Prior Approval form as well as an Annual reporting form. All faculty who are not members of a Health Sciences Compensation Plan (HSCP) are subject to this policy; however, faculty holding appointments of less than 50 percent time are not subject to the annual reporting and prior approval requirements.\n\nAPM 240\n\nThis policy is specific to academic deans, defined as a head of a division, college, school, or other similar academic unit, with administrative responsibility for that unit. APM 240-20c outlines additional restrictions on outside professional activities for Deans beyond the requirements of APM 025/671.\n\nAPM 246\n\n“Faculty Administrators (100% Time)” Faculty Administrators who are appointed at 100% time are primarily responsible for administrative duties, but maintain their underlying faculty appointment. A Faculty Administrator holds a concurrent University faculty appointment. APM 246-20c outlines additional restrictions on outside professional activities for Faculty Administrators beyond the requirements of APM 025/671.\n\nAPM 671\n\n“Conflict of Commitment and Outside Activities of Health Sciences Compensation Plan Participants” Faculty who are members of a Health Sciences Compensation Plan (HSCP) have additional requirements related to Outside Professional Activities, specific to income earned while engaged in outside professional activities. This policy also defines monitoring, compliance, and consequences for non-compliance. Faculty members appointed in Health Sciences schools that are not participants in the Health Sciences Compensation Plan are subject to APM-025.\n\nUC Export Control Policy\n\nThe Export Control Policy sets expectations for roles and responsibilities, the designation of local Export Control Officer, and provides a framework for location export control programs. Federal export controls regulate items, information, and services, taken, sent or provided to other countries and technology shared with foreign nationals in the U.S. These controls are intended to protect U.S. economic interests and national security. The University maintains an open academic environment in support of its mission of teaching, research, and public service. At the same time, export control laws and regulations control the conditions under which certain information, technologies, and commodities can be shared.\n\nKey elements of export control compliance\n\nRestricted party screening\n\nConsiderations for hosting foreign visitors\n\nInternational shipping and hand-carry review\n\nIdentify and safeguard controlled technology\n\nThe University is committed to complying with all U.S. export control laws. This Policy applies to all members of the University community, Faculty and Other Academic Appointees, Staff, Students and Non-employee participants in University programs and to all University activities.\n\nExport control violations can result in civil and criminal penalties against the University, and/or assessment of fines or imprisonment of an individual.\n\nFor export control questions contact Marci Copeland, Systemwide Associate Director of Export Controls at (510) 987-9580 marci.copeland@ucop.edu or your location Export Control Officer.\n\nFAQs\n\n1. What is UC/ECAS doing to address the issue?\n\nECAS has designed a series of compliance measures to address concerns related to foreign influence while ensuring our university’s commitment to fundamental research and maintaining our ability to apply academic freedom.\n\nECAS Strategy Foreign Influence Compliance Plan\n\nForeign Influence Audit\n\nThis systemwide audit will identify and evaluate categories of federal grants for potential factors contributing to higher levels of risk related to foreign influence and review grants for compliance with requirements associated with foreign influence risk.\n\nEscalation Protocol\n\nEach year, UC receives over $5 billion in research contracts and grants from a combination of federal, state, corporate, and non-profit sponsors. The majority of these awards $3.2 billion come from the federal government. Most of the University’s federal fudging is provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). With increasing frequency, federal agencies such as NSF are expressing concerns and inquiring about international engagements at research universities. As the largest recipient of funds from the NSF and NIH and in response to these and other developments, ECAS developed an Escalation Protocol to ensure that federal agency inquiries are appropriately and consistently tracked, escalated, reviewed and investigated across the UC system. This protocol provides a level of campus-wide and centralized visibility to connect separate but potentially related inquiries.\n\nMoratorium on any future engagements with Huawei\n\nTo address recent federal developments that increase the University’s risk associated with engagements with Huawei, the Office of Graduate Studies and ECAS worked closely with Vice Chancellors for Research to develop and outline restrictions on engagements with Huawei. The moratorium restricts any future engagements with Huawei, calls for the cessation of all pending projects, gifts, purchases or other engagements and requires locations to wind down existing agreements and consider risks associated with engagements with Huawei’s U.S. subsidiaries.\n\nEducation and Training Campaign\n\nSystemwide Ethics & Compliance Briefing for Researchers\n\nThis training module will address general ethics and compliance matters and matters related specifically to researchers, such as disclosing affiliations with foreign entities to the federal funding agencies.\n\nForeign Influence Website\n\nCovering the following content areas:\n\n- Disclosing requirements for all international activities and affiliations in grant applications\n\n- Overview of current federal funding policies and regulations and grant procedures\n\n- Best practices for data security while traveling abroad\n\n- A resource page for federal grant policies and regulations, UC systemwide contacts, campus-level contacts, Academic Personnel Manual policies related to conflict of commitment, and conflict of interest.\n\nSystemwide Webinar [NEW 7.20.20]\n\nIn the SCCE Institute of Higher Education General Session on June 2, 2020, ECAS discussed the federal government’s recent concerns regarding foreign interests and potential threats to the research enterprise. The session included a review of federal funding agency disclosure requirements, federal enforcement activities, ECAS compliance overview, and a look at what is on the horizon. ECAS will roll-out systemwide webinars focused on UC’s response to foreign influence compliance, as well as Export Control compliance in 2020/2021.\n\nA series of short, easily digestible, infographics on the highest risk areas. The concept is to share the infographics with the campuses for easy distribution to Departments, Research Administrators, Faculty, Sponsored Projects Offices, etc.\n\n2. Who should I contact if I need clarification on how to comply with a policy, regulation, or generally need help understanding disclosure requirements?\n\nBelow you will find a list of links to campus resources such as Sponsored Projects Offices, Research Compliance Offices, Export Controls Offices.
