Nurses make a difference as trusted advocates who ensure individuals, families, and communities receive quality patient care and services.\n\nFor the public: Celebrate National Nurses Week by sharing a photo of your favorite nurse (or nurses) on social media with the hashtag #ThankANurse or donate to the American Nurses Foundation to show your support.\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, X, and LinkedIn for National Nurses Week updates and surprises."
