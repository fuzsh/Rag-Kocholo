        "text": "The American Red Cross does not send out emails to anyone who has not already applied online to a specific job posting on our careers website. If you have received an email offering you a job at Red Cross without previously applying for a job, please be aware that it is a scam/phishing email. It is a federal crime for a person to pose as a Red Cross representative for the purpose of fraudulently soliciting, collecting, or receiving money or material. If you receive a scam/phishing email supposedly from Red Cross, please report it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Internet Crimes (IC3) Unit. The Red Cross urges people to not provide any personal or financial information to unknown individuals.\n\nYour resume tells your story, and it’s okay if it is more than one page. It should be as concise as possible and still be able to share why you should be a part of our team. Other activities share more about you and the things that you’re passionate about both in and outside of the workplace.\n\nYou will receive an email containing a link to your digital certificate once your instructor completes the necessary submission paperwork. Digital certificates can be viewed, printed or shared online and can be accessed anytime through your Red Cross account. You can also access your digital certificate by visiting our “Find My Certificate” page and following the instructions.\n\nClass participants and employers can also visit the Find My Certificate page and enter the ID found on the digital certificate (or scan the QR code) to access a copy of the valid certificate.\n\nIt’s easy to get access to your digital certificate with the Red Cross if the class was taken within the past three years. Simply visit our “Find My Certificate” page and follow the instructions.\n\nIf you required a printed certificate, call 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) and select the prompt for \"Training and Certifications\" for assistance. To help process your request, please have the following information available when you call: course name, course location, date, instructor's name and your name.\n\nMost Red Cross certifications, including First Aid/CPR/AED, CPR/AED for Professional Rescuers, and Lifeguarding, are valid for two years from the course completion date. If more than two years has passed, you will need to take another class to get recertified.\n\nIf you already have a Red Cross account, you can update your personal information online by logging into your Red Cross account. If you currently do not have a Red Cross account, you may contact Donor Care by calling 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2.\n\nWe encourage you to create an account to manage your activity with the American Red Cross and to track the impact you’ve provided by supporting our efforts. To create an account, please sign up here.\n\nReceipts for mail or phone donations are typically sent within 3 weeks following when the Red Cross receives your gift. For online donations, a printable receipt is sent via email and saved to your Red Cross account within minutes of the successful transaction.\n\nIf you did not receive a receipt for a financial gift you've made, please contact Donor Care by calling 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2. You can expedite your request by completing our online inquiry form.\n\nIf this appears to be an authorized charge, your financial institution authorized the charge, but our anti-fraud protection rejected the attempted charge to protect your security and information. While you may see a hold on your account, no funds have been withdrawn or will be withdrawn from your account. The hold should lift in 1-3 business days. If this was an intended donation or you have additional questions, Please contact Red Cross Donor Care by completing our online inquiry form or calling 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2.\n\nWe are sorry to hear that you had difficulty making a donation. Donations are sometimes declined due to the following reasons:\n\nYour personal information did not match with the credit/debit card entered\n\nYou are currently outside of the US and/or using an international credit card\n\nYou are within a corporate or government firewall\n\nOur fraud protections blocked your transaction. Because we value donor privacy, we have strict protections in place to prevent fraudulent charges.\n\nIf you have attempted to donate online and received a ‘donation declined’ message, please check with your bank to see if the transaction actually went through.\n\nWe appreciate your gift to the American Red Cross and would like to share with you alternate ways to give a gift:\n\nCall 1-800-Help Now (1-800-435-7669) or 1-800-257-7575 (Spanish).\n\nMail your donation to your local Red Cross or to the American Red Cross at:\n\nPO Box 37839,\n\nBoone, IA 50037-0839\n\nYou may receive support by completing our online inquiry form. For a faster response, please have the details of your transaction ready when you contact us.\n\nIf you are located outside the U.S., please contact your National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society to determine the best way you can provide support.\n\nWe understand that many donors are motivated to give during a specific disaster. If you would like to support a specific disaster please write the name of that event on the memo line of your check . Designated donations for a specific disaster will be used for that event; however in the rare case where donations surpass the Red Cross expense for that disaster, the remaining contributions will be put to use serving the recovery needs of the affected communities.\n\nDue to space limitations, we only offer select giving options online which enable us to meet the needs of the people we serve in your community and around the world. By supporting these programs, you give the Red Cross the resources and flexibility essential to respond to disasters and other emergencies immediately, when assistance is needed the most. For additional assistance in donating to an option not listed, please contact Donor Care at 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2 or fill out or online web form.\n\nYes. You can make your donation a \"tribute\" to someone—in their honor, or in memory of a lost loved one. This information is entered in the Honor/Memorial section of the donation form on www.redcross.org. The American Red Cross will mail a Tribute card to your recipient announcing that an Honor or Memorial donation was made by you. You will also receive a card acknowledging your gift.\n\nWhen making a donation via www.redcross.org, you can select “Make a Tribute Gift” to make a donation in memory or in honor of someone. From here you can choose to send a printed card or an e-card. A printed card will take 5-7 business days to arrive and an e-card is sent automatically. When making a donation over the phone, please inform the representative that you would like to make your gift in honor/memory of an individual. For donations made by mail, please enclose a document with the name of the recipient. After the initial donation is made, Donor Care can not mail a printed card, but an e-card link will be emailed to you.\n\nA bequest by will or revocable Trust can be tailored to complement your personal and financial goals and also support the Red Cross. If you include the Red Cross in a bequest provision, please notify us so that we ensure your wishes can be fulfilled. Your notification will be treated confidentially.\n\nUnrestricted Gift: A gift that can be used where the need is greatest\n\n“I give, devise, and bequeath to the American National Red Cross, Washington, DC and / or the American Red Cross _____ (Specific Chapter Name) in, _________(City, State), _______(Dollars)* to be used for its general purposes.”\n\n*Rather than leaving a sum certain, you can include language that refers to a percentage of your estate or a description of the property you wish to give.\n\nYes, Just as the American Red Cross helps people in the U.S. prepare for, respond to and recover from disaster, we also relieve suffering globally. The American Red Cross is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, an intricate support system made up of 187 Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross. When a national society requests assistance, its partner societies coordinate a unified response to avoid duplication, fill gaps and enhance service delivery. In instances where American Red Cross assistance has not been requested, we will not accept designated gifts for the disaster.\n\nThe American Red Cross takes every precaution to protect our donors' information. When donors submit sensitive information on redcross.org, their information is protected both online and offline. We use high grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us. The companies we work with to process credit card transactions also use high grade encryption and security protocols. The American Red Cross employs error checking procedures to make certain transactions are processed completely and accurately. As necessary, changes are made to improve our systems. Additionally, independent external and internal audits are conducted to ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site. Committed to the protection & privacy for all of our users, it is the policy of American Red Cross to continually enhance our fraud protection systems and our other processes to fight identity theft. In addition to maintaining privacy and security controls over information you share with us, the American Red Cross works to accurately process your contribution information. During business hours (M-F, 9am - 5pm EST) our Donor Care staff is available to answer questions about your financial donation at 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2, or visit our website at www.redcross.org/contact-us.\n\nUnfortunately, due to logistical constraints the Red Cross does not accept or solicit individual donations or collections of items. Items such as collected food, used clothing and shoes must be sorted, cleaned, repackaged and transported which impedes the valuable resources of money, time, and personnel.\n\nThe Red Cross does accept bulk quantities of product and services when these items meet our service delivery needs. These donations typically come from manufacturers, suppliers, and/or distributors that can package the items in bulk, palletize them and transport them directly to Red Cross sites. Financial contributions allow the Red Cross to purchase exactly what is needed for a disaster relief operation. Monetary donations also enable the Red Cross to purchase relief supplies close to the disaster site which avoids delays and transportation costs in getting basic necessities to disaster victims. Because the affected community has generally experienced significant economic loss, purchasing relief supplies in or close to the disaster site also helps to stimulate the weakened local economy..\n\nWe applaud your desire to help a family at a difficult time, but unfortunately gifts for a specific family or person cannot be made through the Red Cross. We are committed to helping every family in need recover from emergencies by providing food, clothing, shelter and other essential services and supplies based on need. Special contributions for a specific family violate our principles of providing help equally to all who need it.\n\nYour email address is required so we can send you a proper acknowledgement of your gift. Details of your donation are found in this email, which you can print or save for tax purposes. The American Red Cross will not sell, trade, or share personal information about our financial donors with anyone else, nor will we send mailings to our financial donors on behalf of other organizations, unless a donor has given us specific permission to do so.\n\nYes, Please select DONATE NOW in the upper left-hand corner of the page to set up automatic credit card donations. Once you select the cause you wish to support, you will be presented with the opportunity to make your gift monthly. You may also contact our Donor Care Department at 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2 or complete our online inquiry form.\n\nOur Red Cross street fundraisers can also help you set up monthly donations.\n\nIf you set up your monthly gift through redcross.org, you may make changes to your monthly giving donation by logging into your Red Cross account. All changes that you make are processed immediately. If you do not have an account, you may contact our Donor Care department by calling 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2 and we will handle it for you. Donor Care may process your request the same month, or the following month, depending upon when we receive your call.\n\nIf you set up your monthly gift through a Red Cross street fundraiser, please contact American Red Cross Donor Care at 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2 or complete our online inquiry form.\n\nIf you currently have a Red Cross account and would like to cancel a recurring monthly donation, you can do so by logging into your account. If you do not have a Red Cross account, or need to cancel a single payment of a recurring donation, you can contact American Red Cross Donor Care at 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2 or complete our online inquiry form. For quickest assistance, please have the details of your transaction ready when you contact us.\n\nOur monthly donors receive a year end cumulative statement reflecting the prior year's total contributions. This statement is sent electronically in February. If you haven’t received your statement by the end of February, email or call us right away at 1-800-RED CROSS, option 2 and we’ll help you get what you need. Please note that this statement will only contain donations made through the monthly program and other online donations made through www.redcross.org.\n\nThe Red Cross is unable to accept individual donations or collections: The American Red Cross understands that during times of disaster, donors are moved to help victims by the images they see and hear in the media. But the Red Cross does not accept or solicit individual donations or collections of items due to logistical constraints that are often associated with the acceptance of them. Items such as collections of food, used clothing and shoes must be sorted, cleaned, repackaged and transported which impedes the valuable resources of money, time, and personnel. The Red Cross, in partnership with other agencies, suggests that the best use for these types of donations is to support non-profit organizations within your community.\n\nFrom a computer, visit the GET ASSISTANCE section of www.redcross.org and click on “Find An Open Shelter.” Red Cross shelters that are currently open will be indicated with a flag on the map and in a list on the right side of your screen. By clicking on either the flag or the name of the shelter a new box will appear on the map with the address of the shelter. You can also use the search box to find shelters close to a specific address or within a certain zip code.\n\nDuring an emergency, knowing loved ones are safe can provide great peace of mind. That’s why the Red Cross provides helpful tips for connecting with loved ones if you are separated during a disaster or emergency. In certain circumstances, such as if your loved one is elderly, is a military member or veteran, or if you were separated due to an emergency evacuation, your local Red Cross chapter may be able to provide additional assistance.\n\nEven in times of war, there are restrictions on whom you can fight and how you can fight them. International humanitarian law (IHL) is a set of universal rules which place basic limits on how war is waged. They protect people who are not fighting, like civilians, and people who can no longer fight, like sick and wounded soldiers or those that surrender.\n\nOn August 12, 1949, the four Geneva Conventions in their current form came into being. Now adopted by the United States and every other nation, they are the cornerstone of international humanitarian law, also known as the law of war or the law of armed conflict.\n\nInternational humanitarian law and human rights law are complentary. Both aim to protect the life, health and dignity of individuals.\n\nIHL contains rules that govern the conduct of war and provide protections for the vulnerable, such as civilians and wounded soldiers. These laws only apply in times of war and all parties to a conflict must follow them.\n\nHuman rights law applies in peacetime but does not contain any restrictions on how wars can be fought. These laws apply during both war and peace. Moreover, unlike IHL, some human rights can be suspended in times of national emergency.\n\nA major objective of IHL is to protect civilians. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, civilians are to be protected from murder and permitted to lead normal lives, if security allows. The principle of distinction strictly prohibits the deliberate targeting of civilians or their property.\n\nHowever, if an attack is on a military target and in line with the military objective, the fact that civilians could also be killed does not necessarily make it unlawful.\n\nThe protection of children in wartime is another important part of IHL. In addition to general protections for civilians, children must also be protected against any form of abuse if they fall into the hands of the enemy. The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols of 1977 lay down a series of special protections that recognize the particular vulnerability of children and their needs in armed conflicts.\n\nIHL also prohibits children from taking part in hostilities. It requires that children under 15 not be recruited into the armed forces, and that \"all feasible measures\" be taken to ensure that they do not take a direct part in the fighting. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the recruitment of children under the age of 18, although children ages 15 to 18 can still join voluntarily.\n\nUnfortunately, international humanitarian law is not always observed. Sometimes, violations result from a lack of discipline amongst troops. Other times, one side may believe that humanitarian law does not apply to their own actions because the other side is not following the same rules. Yet, humanitarian law is binding in all situations.\n\nAll nations are legally obligated to uphold IHL in the midst of war and are required to enact domestic laws to enforce legal sanctions against violators. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) is an example of this legislation in the United States.\n\nLegal action against alleged perpetrators of violations of IHL can also take place before an international tribunal, as was the case after World War II and follwing the conflicts in Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The International Criminal Court can also exercise jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in situations where national systems are either unable or unwilling to prosecute alleged perpetrators.\n\nAs a “federally chartered insturmentality of the United States”, the American Red Cross is charged with carrying out the purposes of the Geneva Conventions. The Red Cross is obligated on behalf of the people and the government of the United States to help Americans know and respect these laws and the humanitarian principles they reflect.\n\nIn the United States, international humanitarian law education is a responsibility shared by the Department of Defense which focuses on service members, and the American Red Cross which focuses on the general public. At hundreds of Red Cross chapters throughout the country, staff and volunteers help adults and youth understand international humanitarian law and its relevance to daily life.\n\nIf the rules are going to be obeyed during armed conflict, they must be understood before armed conflict breaks out. With armed conflicts ongoing around the globe and significant American millitary operations overseas, the need for understanding of these rules is as critical as ever.\n\nBy understanding the difference IHL makes to millions of people around the world and close to home, you can contribute to the reduction of suffering. By sharing this information with others, you can help build greater awareness of IHL and the need for humanity in the midst of war. Exposing Americans to humanitarian issues also inspires students, parents and educators to make positive choices and contributions in their lives, communities and beyond.\n\nYou can make a difference. Ask your local Red Cross chapter how you can get involved or email us at IHLaw@redcross.org.\n\nThe American Red Cross provides opportunities to learn more through its international humanitarian law program that offers an introductory level course that raises awareness about the Geneva Conventions, the basic rules of international humanitarian law, and the role of the Red Cross during armed conflict. Through a hands-on approach utilizing group activities, class discussion and compelling multimedia, this course invites participants to reflect on their images and perceptions of armed conflict and explore the powerful and fundamental concept of human dignity even in the midst of war. The American Red Cross also offers the Exploring Humanitarian Law educational toolkit for students and educators. To find out if a chapter near you is offering the half-day course or other opportunities, please contact your local chapter or email us at at IHLaw@redcross.org.\n\nThe Red Cross is also unable to accept collections of items such as clothing, food or cleaning supplies. The cost to sort, package and distribute these types of items is almost always greater than the cost of purchasing the items locally, and it is logistically impossible to distribute the items as the sender intended. In rare cases, the Red Cross can only accept bulk quantities of product and services from manufacturers, suppliers, and/or distributors as in-kind donations. In-kind product must be non-expired, palletized and transported at the donor's expense. See this page for more information.\n\nThe American Red Cross helps to reconnect thousands of refugees, immigrants and other individuals with their families each year by partnering with our sister Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world to locate missing loved ones separated by war, conflict or disaster. Visit your local American Red Cross chapter or call our free national helpline at 844-782-9441 for more information about our international family tracing services.\n\nIf you are concerned about a U.S. citizen living or traveling in another country, call the U.S. Department of State at 1-888-407-4747 for assistance.\n\nThroughout the world, all Red Cross and Red Crescent activities have one central purpose: to help those who suffer without discrimination. The American Red Cross works closely with our sister societies—who share and promote the same humanitarian values—to improve basic living conditions of those in chronically deprived and marginalized areas of the world. Depending on the needs within their respective countries, the local Red Cross society may provide slightly different services day-to-day, but in a crisis we are able to leverage our unparalleled access, community presence, local knowledge and trust to assist in a coordinated and consistent way.\n\nThe emblems are universally recognized symbols of assistance for the victims of war and disaster. The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols spell out how the red cross, red crescent and red crystal are used to protect people, vehicles and structures during war as well as identify routine humanitarian services within a country. International humanitarian law also specifies the use, size, purpose and placing of the emblems as well as the penalties for misuse. While these emblems are not intended to convey a religious or political affiliation, certain countries opt to use one over the other for cultural appropriateness. The red crystal is an optional emblem, equal in status to the red cross and red crescent, but used only in environments where another emblem could be perceived as not being neutral. In addition, though not included in the Geneva Conventions, the red shield of David identifies the Magen David Adom, the national humanitarian society in Israel.\n\nInvoices and statements will be available within 24-48 hours of being produced without waiting for conventional mail.\n\nYou can download data from the invoices to your own computer in various formats (HTML, PDF, Comma/Tab Delimited).\n\nPayments can be made and tracked online, without writing and mailing checks. Quick Pay discounts will be easier to obtain due to the faster turnaround time.\n\nElectronic messaging is easier on the environment than producing paper and engaging resources to process mail.\n\nInvoice Central includes an Export function that enables you to download invoice and payment information in standard formats for input in your A/P application. Simply choose Export from the main navigation bar. Optionally, you can work with us to integrate invoice data directly into your back office system. This takes some work on our part and yours, but it enables you to minimize human interaction and free your staff to work on exceptions, analysis and other tasks. If you are interested in this type of integration, email us at InvoiceCentral@redcross.org for further information.\n\nThe word \"Ombuds\" (pronounced \"ahm – buhds\") comes from a Swedish term meaning \"a person who has an ear to the people.\" It is used world-wide to designate independent, impartial and confidential offices that receive inquiries from designated groups of people and work to achieve fair and equitable resolutions.\n\nAn Organizational Ombuds provides confidential, off-the-record and impartial guidance to assist in resolving concerns or problems relating to an organization's mission, programs, or workplace. As an independent and neutral resource, the Ombuds works with people inside and outside of the organization to promote fairness and resolve problems effectively. An ombuds also keeps track of the kinds of issues that are raised to report that data back to the organization to support systemic improvements.\n\nAn Organizational Ombuds does not conduct formal investigations or accept complaints for the organization. Rather, the Ombuds encourages people to voice concerns before they turn into crises or degrade the organization's operations and reputation. Informal conflict management approaches are used to assist in the resolution of concerns.\n\nThe Ombuds Office maintains the confidentiality of the information it receives and the identities of the people who contact the office. We will not identify you or disclose identifying issues and concerns shared with us to anyone unless we request and receive permission during the course of our informal discussions. An exception to confidentiality occurs when we believe that disclosure is necessary to address an imminent risk of serious harm.\n\nWithout breaching confidentiality, the Ombuds Office will use the information shared to help improve the American Red Cross. By tracking and reporting general trends we observe, we can help build a stronger American Red Cross. And we will do so as a completely neutral, confidential, informal and independent resource.\n\nThe Ombuds Office does not retain any permanent information that would potentially identify the individuals involved in a matter.\n\nUnfortunately, RWTC is not available in every chapter in the U.S. As of 2011, it is available in 52 Red Cross chapters. The program was first developed in 2000 as a partnership between the American Red Cross of Greater Chicago and W.W. Grainger, Inc. With the support of W.W. Grainger, Inc. as the National Founding Sponsor, RWTC rolled out as a national pilot program limited to a number of chapters. The goal of the three-year pilot program was to have 16 chapters working in partnership with 100+ corporate partners with several thousand trained RWTC volunteers in place and to have created a model that can be efficiently replicated nationwide. With the success of the demonstration project the RWTC program has grown and is now available in several American Red Cross chapters across the country. Please check with your local Red Cross for more information on program locations.\n\nPlease contact Marcela Espinoza, National RWTC Program Manager at marcela.espinoza@redcross.org or (917) 416-9004.\n\nRWTC is a \"top down\" program, where the management of a company signs on before employees are recruited. The recruitment of volunteers for RWTC is usually conducted by the partner company itself. (Some companies send e-mails or post information about the program on an Intranet site. Others place it in the company newsletter). Companies partner with their local Red Cross chapter, recruiting employees as volunteers who then are trained by the chapter as disaster-response volunteers. Partner companies commit to making these employees available for service at least one day per year. When a local, large-scale disaster occurs, the Red Cross contacts their RWTC company liaisons, who then call their RWTC employee volunteers into action. The chapter then assumes responsibility for their deployment and management.\n\nYes. Our commercial general liability insurance covers volunteers for personal liability that they may incur while acting as agents of the Red Cross. A volunteer is considered to be an agent of the Red Cross when he or she is acting under the direct control and supervision of the Red Cross and within the scope of his or her Red Cross duties. We normally do not indemnify another party in these situations. Also, workers’ compensation does not extend to volunteers in most situations. Full details of insurance coverage are available upon request.\n\nAlthough Ready When the Time Comes was originally, and still is, designed to provide chapters with local RWTC corporate employee volunteer teams, some corporations and other Non Government Organization partners have occasionally expressed a positive interest in deploying their employees on large, national disaster operations.\n\nRWTC corporate volunteer employee team are encouraged to deploy beyond their unit, but we ask that they give us a work week; that is, travel on a weekend, work for five days and return on a weekend; although we’d welcome a longer commitment.\n\nThe partner and the deploying team will be fully briefed and understand the potential hardships they may encounter, including berthing in staff shelters, adverse weather and working conditions, physical and medical restrictions, as well as the need for just-in-time training at the operation. We will try to deploy teams closest to the Disaster Relief Operation first and then expand opportunities from there. The decision to deploy RWTC teams beyond the unit is ultimately based on the needs of the relief operation. We want to ensure that our partner teams have the best possible experience; and that their talents and experience are fully utilized on the operation.\n\nPossible deployment to any disaster operation is initiated and coordinated through the affiliated chapter.\n\nIf you have a corporate team that has expressed an interest in sending a RWTC team out to one of our ongoing relief operations, contact Marcela Espinoza at marcela.espinoza@redcross.org or by phone at (917) 416-9004 and we will work with you and our DSHR staffing to see if we can make this happen.\n\nThe American Red Cross helps to reconnect families separated internationally by war, disaster, migration and other humanitarian emergencies. Requests can be accepted from family members who were in contact before the emergency situation separated them. A sufficient amount of information on the missing family member is needed to initiate a search. Service may not be available in all countries or all areas of specific countries due to security restrictions or accessibility barriers. If you would like to initiate an international search for a family member, please contact your local American Red Cross office.\n\nWhen countries become signatories to the Geneva Conventions, their governments agree to apply certain protections to non-combatants (POWs, civilians, etc.) during armed conflict. They also agree to help people locate family members separated by armed conflict. Each country is required to establish a single Red Cross or Red Crescent that works with other members in this global network to trace missing relatives, among other responsibilities. Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, started tracing during the American Civil War when she carried messages between wounded soldiers and their families. More than a century later, the American Red Cross continues to provide information, comfort and relief to families separated by wars, disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.\n\nIf you live outside the United States, you should contact the Red Cross or Red Crescent in your own country. You can view a list of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies on the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies website at www.ifrc.org. Criteria for accepting cases varies from country to country, and your local Red Cross or Red Crescent will be able to direct you to appropriate resources within your country.\n\nNo. The Red Cross serves anyone who wishes to obtain documentation or learn the fates of family members they were separated from during the Holocaust or World War II. The criteria for accepting a case is that the separation occurred in Europe between 1933 and 1957 as a result of Nazi actions.\n\nIt is well known that the Nazis and their collaborators imprisoned or killed more than 11 million people including 6 million Jews who were especially targeted for extermination. Polish Catholics, clergy, gypsies, Jehovah's Witnesses, Ukrainians, Russian soldiers, homosexuals, and the disabled were also targets for forced labor, medical experiments, and murder.\n\nThe American Red Cross Restoring Family Links program can help to search for the documentation required by many of the restitution funds, including documentation of forced labor or internment in a concentration camp. There are numerous restitution funds available from many different sources. For information on the requirements of particular funds, we recommend that you first consult the Guide to Compensation and Restitution for Holocaust Survivors, published by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference), which can be accessed at www.claimscon.org.\n\nDuring disasters, if you see or hear about any instances of people misusing the Red Cross name or logo to collect funds on behalf of disaster victims, or any other types of disaster-related fraud, please call the National Center for Disaster Fraud (a program under the U.S. Department of Justice), toll-free, at (866) 720-5721, or email the NCDF at disaster@leo.gov. All calls and emails will be treated as confidential.\n\nIn non-disaster situations, if you believe that someone is posing as a Red Cross employee and fraudulently soliciting, collecting, or receiving money or material, please report it to us.\n\nThe American Red Cross does not send out emails to anyone who has not already applied online to a specific job posting on our careers website. If you have received an email offering you a job at Red Cross without previously applying for a job, please be aware that it is a scam/phishing email. It is a federal crime for a person to pose as a Red Cross representative for the purpose of fraudulently soliciting, collecting, or receiving money or material. If you receive a scam/phishing email supposedly from Red Cross, please report it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Internet Crimes (IC3) Unit. The Red Cross urges people to not provide any personal or financial information to unknown individuals.\n\nThe mission of Red Cross Service to the Armed Forces is to provide humanitarian support to service members, veterans and their families around the clock, around the globe, under a trusted symbol.\n\nService to the Armed Forces ensures that current members of the miltary and their families have worldwide, 24-hour access to timely and reliable emergency communications, case management services, and access to emergency financial assistance from the military aid socieities. The Red Cross also supports service members and their families at Veterans Affairs (VA) and military hospitals, in communities throughout the U.S., and on military installations around the world. The organization continues to enhance existing programs and establish new services to meet the needs of today’s service members, veterans and their families.\n\nMilitary service is unique, frequently separating families for extended periods of time and often placing loved ones in harm’s way. Red Cross emergency communication services keep families in this unique situation connected when an emergency occurs back home. Our 24/7 communications system enables military families to apply to military aid societies for emergency financial assistance.\n\nWith the exception of these two unique services, the Red Cross provides similar services to both military and civilian populations, including disaster assistance and access to preparedness training and education.\n\nEven at a time when families can stay connected through e-mail and cell phones, the Red Cross communications service is critical during times of emergency. Red Cross workers are able to quickly verify the circumstances of a family emergency and provide a verified and confidential report to a service member’s commanding officer. This helps military authorities make timely, informed decisions on when, and whether, to send someone home armed with the best information available. When days, hours and minutes matter, the Red Cross is able to help make a trusted connection.\n\nVisit our “Find My Certificate” page and follow the instructions.\n\nIf you require a printed certificate, contact 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) and select the prompt \"Training and Certification\" for assistance. To help process your request, please have the following information available when you call: course name, course location, date, course instructor's name, and your name. Most Red Cross certifications, including First Aid/CPR/AED, CPR/AED for Healthcare Providers, and Lifeguarding, are valid for two years from the course completion date. If more than two years has passed, you will need to take another class to get recertified.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about becoming an instructor, visit our “Become a Red Cross Instructor” landing page.\n\nIf you’re ready to get started, you have two options:\n\nContact the Training Support Center at 1-800-RED CROSS (select the prompt for “Training and Certification”).\n\nEmail the Training Support Center with your name, request to become an Instructor and names of the courses you’d like to teach.\n\nInstructors who teach non-Red Cross programs may qualify for a quick and free bridging process. Be sure to have your current Instructor certifications available when calling the Training Support Center to get the paperwork.\n\nParticipants must be 11 years old, by the last day of the course they are taking, to receive a certificate for Red Cross Babysitter's Training. This age was selected as most states require children to be 11 before they can be left alone for short periods without adult supervision. However, local or state regulating agencies may have different age requirements to be able to babysit; check with your local child welfare and/or police for local requirements in your area. You may receive different answers, so ask for a written copy of the statutes and/or regulations that pertain to your location.\n\nYes. Lay responders will find most people in cardiac arrest on the ground. Moving the person from the ground to an elevated surface will delay CPR and affect the outcome. For successful completion, during the CPR/AED assessment scenario, participants must check the person, give approximately 2 minutes of CPR and operate the AED with the manikin on the ground. However, for skill practice, an accommodation may be made to have the manikin on an elevated surface that is firm, flat and stable.\n\nParticipants in the Basic Life Support course may demonstrate the primary assessment and the CPR skill as they would perform it in their environment of care. For example, depending on their scope of practice, they may demonstrate the primary assessment and CPR skill on an elevated surface that is firm, flat and stable which would be used in the scope of their care, such as a hospital bed or stretcher. Or they may demonstrate these skills on the ground.\n\nNinety cents of every dollar the American Red Cross spends is invested in humanitarian services and programs. The other ten cents supports our general operations and helps ensure we are ready to respond wherever and whenever help is needed. (For more information, please see our annual reports and other publications or our Where Your Money Goes page.)\n\nAdding an additional 2.5% to the amount of your donation will help cover processing fees and other expenses associated with the processing of your gift. This fee is not required to make a financial gift. You may choose to add the additional amount at the time of your online donation."
