        "text": "On this page:\n\n“There is no denying that [journalism] does not only inform people but also helps people shape opinions regarding various socio-political scenarios.”\n\nA Research Guide for Students\n\nDepending on the publication a newspaper article will be written about local, national or international current affairs/events.\n\nIntroduction to Newspaper Articles\n\nThere are many types of newspapers, from school/university publications to large news outlets like the Daily Mail, or Guardian. Local papers will focus more on events in and around the community, for example they may cover community fates or markets. They’ll also have stories about local people. They will still be written in a professional and formal way but may have a more conversational tone.\n\nUnlike local papers, national publications will focus more on events that effect the wider populous. They will also report on noteworthy international events, such as crises and wars, but also sporting and entertainment events like the Olympics. They advertise to a much wider audience than local papers and need to relate to most of the population.\n\nPurpose of a Newspaper Article\n\nNews articles are written to inform and educate readers on current affairs/events. They are used to provide readers with information they need/want to know about the world around them. You will either be told what to write your article on or have a choice of topics related to the module this assessment is for.\n\nNewspaper articles give as much information as possible at the time of publication; if a journalist writes about an ongoing case there may be limited information available, so they might interview people related to the case, or try find background information to help inform readers more.\n\nNews articles are written on a whole range of topics due to the large target audiences of newspapers. Most papers will have several sections ranging from current national and international affairs to sports and celebrity news. There are some papers, however which solely focus on a specific topic, therefore have a smaller target audience.\n\nBe sure of your topic and potential target audience.\n\nExample: there are sporting papers which mainly report on sporting events and news. Whereas some others focus on business and economic current affairs.\n\nThe Reliability Spectrum\n\nNormally when writing a public communication piece you want to be looking at examples to get a feel for their tone. However, with newspapers there is also a need to think about the range of reliability that they represent.\n\nWhen thinking about the press, we could look at it as a spectrum on the basis of reliability due to the variety of articles and news outlets.\n\nIf you are writing to inform, aim for your work to be on the objective end of the spectrum where you stay impartial, leaving personal opinions out of your work. Whereas, if you are writing to persuade or analyse consider moving down the spectrum. Here we find the likes of Letters to the Editor and Opinion Pieces; work that is critical and has more focus on the writer's opinions.\n\nWhen writing any form of article ensure that you are not creating fake news (false or misleading information presented as news). Use reliable sources and cite all references to keep your work credible, think of this as any other assessment. You will lose marks for not using and citing references correctly. Use our Referencing Guide to ensure you use the correct referencing system.\n\nThe reliability spectrum can be highly influenced by politics and the political view points of journalists, editors and sometimes owners of publications which will determine the tone of their articles. Your assessment brief will determine where your work sits on the spectrum, depending on whether you've been asked to inform, educate or persuade.\n\nExample: If you've been asked to persuade you may state your opinion, but ensure these are informed opinions that are backed up."
