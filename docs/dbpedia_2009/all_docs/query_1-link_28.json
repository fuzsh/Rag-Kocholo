        "text": "CMS created the Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers, their families, and caregivers compare nursing homes more easily and to help identify areas about which you may want to ask questions. The Nursing Home Care Compare web site features a quality rating system that gives each nursing home a rating of between 1 and 5 stars. Nursing homes with 5 stars are considered to have much above average quality and nursing homes with 1 star are considered to have quality much below average. There is one Overall 5-star rating for each nursing home, and separate ratings for health inspections, staffing and quality measures.\n\nCaution: No rating system can address all of the important considerations that go into a decision about which nursing home may be best for a particular person. Examples include the extent to which specialty care is provided (such as specialized rehabilitation or dementia care) or how easy it will be for family members to visit. Visits can improve both the residents' quality of life and quality of care, it may be better to select a nursing home that is very close over one that may be, rated higher but far away. Consumers should therefore use the Web site together with other sources of information for the nursing homes (including a visit to the nursing home) and State or local organizations (such as local advocacy groups and the State Ombudsman program).\n\nThe Downloads section below contains the Five-Star Quality Rating System Technical Users' Guide that provides in-depth descriptions of the ratings and the methods used to calculate them.\n\nThe Related Links section below contains a link to the Nursing Home Care Compare web site where you can find and compare nursing homes near you.\n\nWhat’s New -\n\nJanuary 7, 2022\n\nQSOG Memo QSO-22-08-NH, Nursing Home Staff Turnover and Weekend Staffing Levels, has been posted. This memo describes the addition of staff turnover and weekend staffing measures to Care Compare.
