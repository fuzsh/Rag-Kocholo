        "text": "Background\n\nResources\n\nWaivers\n\nThe Build America, Buy America Act (BABAA) requires all federal agencies, including FEMA, to ensure that no federal financial assistance for “infrastructure” projects is provided unless all of the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in the project are produced in the United States.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has revised Title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (2 C.F.R.) to add a new part 184 and revise 2 C.F.R. § 200.322, to provide guidance to federal agencies on how to apply the domestic preference requirements as set forth in BABAA. OMB also issued OMB Memorandum M-24-02, Implementation Guidance on Application of Buy America Preference in Federal Financial Assistance Programs for Infrastructure, which provides supplemental implementation guidance to federal agencies on: (1) the application of a Buy America preference to federal financial assistance programs for infrastructure; and (2) the process for waiving such a Buy America preference, including the circumstances under which waivers may be justified as consistent with applicable law and policy. These revisions are effective for subject FEMA awards issued on or after Oct. 23, 2023.\n\nFor subject FEMA awards issued between Jan. 2, 2023- Oct. 22, 2023, 2 C.F.R. Part 184 and OMB Memorandum M-24-02 do not apply. Instead, see OMB Memorandum M–22–11, Initial Implementation Guidance on Application of Buy America Preference in Federal Financial Assistance Programs for Infrastructure for BABAA implementation guidance.\n\nPrograms and Definitions\n\nPlease see the following links for key definitions of federal financial assistance, as well as the full lists of FEMA federal financial assistance programs for which BABAA does and does not apply.\n\nSubject to BABAA\n\nDefinitions\n\nNOT Subject to BABAA\n\nFEMA Resources\n\nThese FEMA resources will provide clarity on the applicability of the BABAA requirements to FEMA financial assistance programs and implement a transparent process for waiver requests.\n\nRead the Policy\n\nRead Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIssuing \"Buy America\" Waivers\n\nPer section 70914(b) of BABAA, FEMA may waive the application of a \"Buy America\" preference under an infrastructure program in any case in which FEMA finds that:\n\nApplying the domestic content procurement preference would be inconsistent with the public interest (public interest waiver);\n\nTypes of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities or of a satisfactory quality (nonavailability waiver); or\n\nThe inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25% (unreasonable cost waiver).\n\nPublic Comment Period\n\nAs outlined in OMB Memorandum M-24-02, before issuing a waiver, FEMA must make publicly available on FEMA’s website a detailed written explanation for the proposed determination to issue the waiver and provide at least 15 days for public comment on the proposed waiver. FEMA uses this website to post proposed waivers for public comment from the \"Buy America\" preference requirement for a FEMA program.\n\nFEMA Waivers\n\nApproved General Applicability Waivers\n\nApproved Project Specific Waivers\n\nProposed Waivers for Public Comment\n\nThere are no proposed waivers for public comment at this time. Waivers will be posted here as available.\n\nMore Information\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact your applicable point of contact for more information, including:"
