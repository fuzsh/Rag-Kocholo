        "text": "Gov. Gavin Newsom opened his June 25 State-of-the-State speech with a warning about “the destruction of democracy” in our midst. In another branch of state government, the word “democracy” has never before been so liberally sprinkled among the remarks of state legislators.\n\nSupremely cynical it is, then, were the governor’s and the Legislature’s recent roles in a very undemocratic action of having an initiative on tax increases, signed by 1.4 million people, tossed off the November General Election ballot by the Supreme Court of California.\n\nThe court’s June 20 decision on Legislature of the State of California v. Weber completed a rare trifecta of having all three branches of state government allied against the will of the people as expressed through their very democratic actions.\n\nThe case concerned the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act, which argued right up front, “Californians are overtaxed. We pay the nation’s highest state income tax, sales tax, and gasoline tax. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, California’s combined state and local tax burden is the highest in the nation. Despite this, and despite two consecutive years of obscene revenue surpluses, state politicians in 2021 alone introduced legislation to raise more than $234 billion in new and higher taxes and fees.”\n\nBackers of the Taxpayer Protection Act believe official Sacramento has loosened or slipped the reins of Proposition 13 (1978), Proposition 62 (1986), Proposition 218 (1996), and Proposition 26 (2010). “Contrary to the voters’ intent, these measures that were designed to control taxes, spending and accountability, have been weakened and hamstrung by the Legislature, government lawyers, and the courts, making it necessary to pass yet another initiative to close loopholes and reverse hostile court decisions.”\n\nThis challenge was taken as an affront to the Legislature and Governor Newsom, who were petitioners in the case against the Act, and they won.\n\n“We typically review constitutional challenges to an initiative after an election in order to avoid disrupting the electoral process and the exercise of the franchise,” ruled the Court. “We found preelection review to be appropriate because [u]nder such circumstances, deferring a decision until after the election not only will defeat the constitutionally contemplated procedure . . . but may contribute to an increasing cynicism on the part of the electorate with respect to the efficacy of the initiative process.”\n\n“Cynicism”? Cynical choice of words that.\n\nHere’s a great example of cynicism. Fearful that the Taxpayer Protection Act would pass, the Legislature put Assembly Constitutional Amendment 13 on the ballot that “would amend the Constitution to increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any state or local measure would be approved by the voters only if the proportion of votes cast in favor of the initiative measure is equal to or greater than the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose.”\n\nPerhaps as a way to tamp down the anger caused by the Supreme Court’s decision to toss the Taxpayer Protection Act, ACA 13 has been moved to the 2026 General Election ballot.\n\nIt should be remembered that the Legislature doesn’t have to go through the signature-gathering process for ballot measures that common folk do.\n\nThe Legislature also doesn’t have to abide by the deadlines common folk do. Whereas June 27 was the deadline for initiatives to be placed on the November ballot, or removed by the backers of measures that made it, legislators gave themselves until July 3.\n\nAll very cynical and hardly democratic.\n\nJohn Kabateck is California state director for the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB)."
