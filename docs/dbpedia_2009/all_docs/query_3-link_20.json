        "text": "Under the Biden-Harris Administration, EPA has restored scientific integrity and accelerated the pace of research and actions needed to tackle the PFAS crisis and protect American communities.\n\nLearn more about PFAS.\n\nLearn more about EPA's PFAS Strategic Roadmap.\n\nSince January 2021, EPA has taken bold actions, including:\n\nFinal CERCLA Hazardous Substances Designations for PFOA and PFOS\n\nIn April 2024, EPA finalized a critical rule to designate two widely used PFAS – PFOA and PFOS – as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as Superfund. This step improves transparency and accountability to clean up PFAS contamination in communities. In addition to the final rule, EPA issued a separate CERCLA enforcement discretion policy that makes clear that EPA will focus enforcement on parties who significantly contributed to the release of PFAS chemicals into the environment.\n\nLearn more about the final CERCLA designation and related actions.\n\nFirst-Ever National Drinking Water Standard for PFAS\n\nIn April 2024, EPA issued the first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standard to protect communities from exposure to harmful PFAS. The final rule will reduce PFAS exposure for approximately 100 million people, prevent thousands of deaths, and reduce tens of thousands of serious illnesses. EPA concurrently announced a further $1 billion to help states and territories implement PFAS testing and treatment at public water systems and to help owners of private wells address PFAS contamination.\n\nLearn more about EPA’s final PFAS drinking water regulation.\n\nUpdated Interim Guidance on PFAS Destruction and Disposal\n\nIn April 2024, EPA released updated interim guidance on the destruction and disposal of PFAS-containing materials, building on earlier guidance from 2020. The updated guidance reflects the latest, best available science to provide information that managers of PFAS wastes can use to evaluate the most appropriate destruction, disposal, or storage method and prioritize the use of technologies with the lowest potential for environmental release.\n\nLearn more about the updated interim guidance.\n\nAction to Cut PFAS from U.S. Government Custodial Contracts\n\nIn April 2024, EPA and the General Services Administration announced changes to GSA’s custodial specification to ensure that cleaning products purchased for federal buildings are free of toxic PFAS. Federal Contractors will be required to use products certified to ecolabels such as EPA’s Safer Choice or certain GreenSeal® certifications.\n\nLearn more about this announcement.\n\nProposed Resource Conservation and Recovery Act PFAS-Related Rules\n\nIn February 2024, EPA released two proposed regulations under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to protect communities from PFAS and other emerging chemicals of concern. These rules would add nine PFAS to the list of RCRA hazardous constituents and would assure that EPA’s regulations clearly reflect EPA’s and authorized states’ authority to require cleanup of the full range of substances that RCRA intended.\n\nLearn more about these proposed rules.\n\nMethods for Measuring PFAS in the Environment\n\nIn January 2024, the EPA released three methods to better measure PFAS in the environment:\n\nFinal EPA Method 1633, a method to test for 40 PFAS in wastewater, surface water, groundwater, soil, biosolids, sediment, landfill leachate, and fish tissue.\n\nFinal EPA Method 1621, which can broadly screen for the presence of chemical substances that contain carbon-fluorine bonds, including PFAS, in wastewater.\n\nOther Test Method (OTM)-50, which measures 30 volatile fluorinated compounds in air.\n\nLearn more about final Methods 1633 and 1621.\n\nLearn more about OTM-50.\n\nRequiring Toxics Release Inventory Reporting for Seven Additional PFAS\n\nIn January 2024, the EPA announced the automatic addition of seven PFAS to the list of chemicals covered by the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), consistent with the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act. TRI reporting will be required for these seven PFAS for the 2024 reporting year.\n\nLearn more about the addition of these PFAS to TRI.\n\nFinal Significant New Use Rule for Inactive PFAS\n\nIn January 2024, the EPA finalized a rule that prevents companies from starting or resuming the manufacture or processing of 329 PFAS that have not been made or used for many years without a complete EPA review and risk determination. Without this rule, companies could have resumed uses of these PFAS absent notification to and review by the EPA.\n\nRead more about the Inactive PFAS Significant New Use Rule.\n\nSecond Annual PFAS Strategic Roadmap Progress Report\n\nIn December 2023, the EPA released its second annual report on PFAS progress. The report highlights significant accomplishments achieved under the EPA’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap and aligns with the Biden-Harris Administration’s all-of-government strategy to protect communities from the impacts of forever chemicals.\n\nLearn more about the Second Annual PFAS Roadmap Progress Report.\n\nFinal Rule to Enhance PFAS Toxics Release Inventory Reporting\n\nIn October 2023, EPA released a final rule that will improve reporting on PFAS to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) by eliminating an exemption that allowed facilities to avoid reporting information on PFAS when those chemicals were used in small concentrations. Under this new rule, EPA will receive more comprehensive data on PFAS and looks forward to sharing these data with our partners and the public.\n\nLearn more about the Final Rule to Enhance PFAS Toxics Release Inventory Reporting.\n\nFinal Rule to Require Reporting for PFAS Manufactured and Used in the United States\n\nIn October 2023, EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register that will provide EPA, its partners, and the public with the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. This final rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) will require all manufacturers (including importers) of PFAS and PFAS-containing articles in any year since 2011 to report information to EPA on PFAS uses, production volumes, disposal, exposures, and hazards.\n\nLearn more about the Final Rule to Require Reporting for PFAS Manufactured and Used in the United States.\n\nAdding PFAS as a National Enforcement and Compliance Initiative\n\nIn August 2023, EPA finalized its National Enforcement and Compliance Initiatives for 2024-2027, including “Addressing Exposure to PFAS.” This initiative will focus on implementing EPA’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap and hold responsible those who manufactured PFAS and/or used PFAS in the manufacturing process, federal facilities that released PFAS, and other industrial parties who significantly contributed to the release of PFAS into the environment.\n\nLearn more about EPA’s NECIs for 2024-2027.\n\nInitial Nationwide Monitoring Data on 29 PFAS in Drinking Water Systems\n\nIn August 2023, EPA released the first set of data collected under the fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 5). These new data will improve EPA’s understanding of the frequency that 29 PFAS and lithium are found in the nation’s drinking water systems, and at what levels. As part of UCMR 5, EPA is conducting the most comprehensive monitoring effort for PFAS ever, at every large and midsize public water system in America, and at hundreds of small water systems.\n\nLearn more about UCMR 5 and the data EPA has released.\n\nNew Framework to Prevent Unsafe New PFAS from Entering the Market\n\nIn June 2023, EPA released a framework for addressing new and new uses of PFAS under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The framework will ensure that before these chemicals are allowed to enter into commerce, EPA will undertake an extensive evaluation to ensure they pose no harm to human health and the environment.\n\nLearn more about the framework to prevent unsafe new PFAS from entering the market.\n\nAdvance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to Inform Potential Future CERCLA Regulations\n\nIn April 2023, EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) asking the public for input regarding potential future hazardous substance designations of PFAS under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund. This request for input and information follows EPA’s September 2022 proposed rule to designate two PFAS — perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and their salts and structural isomers — as hazardous substances under CERCLA.\n\nLearn more about the advance notice.\n\nNational drinking water standard to limit six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\n\nIn March 2023, EPA took a key step to protect public health by proposing to establish legally enforceable levels for six PFAS known to occur in drinking water, fulfilling a foundational commitment in the Agency’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap. Through this proposed rule, EPA is leveraging the most recent science and building on existing state efforts to limit PFAS to provide a nationwide, health-protective level for these specific PFAS in drinking water.\n\nLearn more about the proposed rule\n\n$2 Billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Funding for PFAS and Emerging Contaminants in Drinking Water\n\nIn February 2023, EPA announced the availability of $2 billion from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address emerging contaminants, including PFAS, in drinking water across the country. This investment, which is allocated to states and territories, will be made available to communities as grants through EPA’s Emerging Contaminants in Small or Disadvantaged Communities grant program. These funds will promote access to safe and clean water in small, rural, and disadvantaged communities while supporting local economies.\n\nLearn more about this funding.\n\nInactive PFAS Significant New Use Rule\n\nIn January 2023, EPA proposed a rule that would prevent anyone from starting or resuming, without a complete EPA review and risk determination, the manufacture, processing or use of an estimated 300 PFAS that have not been made or used for many years, known as “inactive PFAS.” In the past, these chemicals may have been used in many industries in a variety of ways, including as binding agents, surfactants, sealants and gaskets, and may also have been released into the environment. Without this proposed rule, companies could resume uses of these PFAS absent notification to and review by EPA.\n\nRead more about the proposed Inactive PFAS Significant New Use Rule.\n\nFinal Effluent Limitations Guidelines Plan 15\n\nIn January 2023, EPA released its final Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELGs) Plan 15, including a determination that revised ELGs and pretreatment standards are warranted for reducing PFAS in leachate discharges from landfills. Plan 15 also announced an expansion of the ongoing study of PFAS discharges from textile manufacturers and a new study of POTW influents to publicly owned treatment works.\n\nLearn more about Effluent Limitations Guidelines Plan 15.\n\nPFAS Analytic Tools\n\nIn January 2023, EPA released a new interactive webpage, called the PFAS Analytic Tools, which bring together multiple sources of information on PFAS in one place. These tools will help the public, researchers, and other stakeholders better understand potential PFAS sources in their communities.\n\nView the new PFAS analytic tools.\n\nMemo on Addressing PFAS in Clean Water Act Permitting\n\nIn December 2022, EPA issued a companion memo providing guidance to states on how to use the Clean Water Act’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting program to reduce harmful PFAS pollution. This memo expands upon an earlier memo issued to EPA Regions in April 2022 and is a critical step in EPA’s efforts to restrict PFAS at their source.\n\nRead the December 2022 memo (pdf).\n\nProposed Rule to Enhance Reporting of PFAS Data to the Toxics Release Inventory\n\nOn December 5, 2022, EPA proposed a rule that would improve reporting PFAS to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) by, among other proposed changes, eliminating an exemption that allows facilities to avoid reporting information on PFAS when those chemicals are used in small, or de minimis, concentrations. Because PFAS are used at low concentrations in many products, this rule would ensure that covered industry sectors and federal facilities that make or use TRI-listed PFAS will no longer be able to rely on the de minimis exemption to avoid disclosing their PFAS releases and other waste management quantities for these chemicals.\n\nRead more about the proposed rule to enhance reporting of PFAS data to the Toxics Release Inventory.\n\nProposed Hazardous Substance Designation for PFOA and PFOS\n\nOn August 26, 2022, EPA issued a proposal to designate two of the most widely used PFAS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, or Superfund. This rulemaking would increase transparency around releases of these harmful chemicals and help to hold polluters accountable for cleaning up their contamination.\n\nRead more about the rule.\n\nNew Drinking Water Health Advisories and $1 Billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Funding\n\nIn June 2022, EPA released four drinking water health advisories for PFAS. EPA also announced that it is inviting states and territories to apply for $1 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law grant funding to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants in drinking water, specifically in small and disadvantaged communities.\n\nRead more about the Health Advisories.\n\nLearn more about the Emerging Contaminants Grant.\n\nNational PFAS Testing Strategy Test Order\n\nOn June 6, EPA issued its first test order under EPA’s National PFAS Testing Strategy, a key component of the Agency’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap. Test orders under the Toxic Substances Control Act are the first step under the National PFAS Testing Strategy to protect human health and the environment from the potential risks of PFAS. The information from these initial orders will provide the Agency with critical information on more than 2,000 similar PFAS that fall within these categories.\n\nLearn more about the National PFAS Testing Strategy.\n\nAdding Five PFAS to Contaminated Site Cleanup Tables\n\nIn May 2022, EPA took an important step forward to protect people from PFAS by adding five PFAS to a list of risk-based values for site cleanups. These values, known as Regional Screening Levels and Regional Remedial Management Levels, help EPA determine if response or remediation activities are needed. EPA’s action provides the Agency with critical tools needed for Superfund and other Agency programs to investigate contamination and protect people from these PFAS chemicals using the latest peer-reviewed science.\n\nRead more about these updates.\n\nClean Water PFAS Actions\n\nIn April 2022, EPA announced three clean water actions that advance progress under EPA’s PFAS Strategic Roadmap:\n\nDraft Aquatic Life Criteria for PFOA and PFOS\n\nEPA proposed the first Clean Water Act aquatic life criteria for PFAS, focusing on two of the most well-studied chemicals in this group: PFOA and PFOS.
