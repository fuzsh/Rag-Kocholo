        "text": "What will you leave history about your attitudes, interests and life? There are hardly any memoirs, or personal papers of clergy within the Cathedral Archive. Dean Arthur Lake is one of the few that something more is known about. He was one of a series of deans in the early seventeenth century who led the Cathedral before the civil war.\n\nArthur Lake was the brother of Sir Thomas Lake, who was the knight principal Secretary of State to King James VI and I. He was educated for a while at Southampton’s free school, then Wykeham’s school and from there he was elected a probationer fellow of New College, Oxford. After two years he was made perpetual fellow of that University’s College in 1589. He was made a fellow of Wykehams College, near Winchester around 1600, and three years later Master of the Hospital of Saint Cross. In 1605 he took the degrees in Divinity and was installed as Archdeacon of Surrey. He was promoted to become the Dean of Worcester in April 1608. He was later made Bishop of Bath and Wells on 8th December 1616. He is described as carrying “himself the same in mind and person, showing by his constancy, that his virtues were virtues indeed: in all kind of which, whether natural, moral, theological, personal, or pastoral, he was eminent, and indeed one of the examples of his time. He always lived a single man, exemplary in his life and conversation, and very hospitable[i].”\n\nThe biography in the front of his writings, published after his death, borders on the hagiographical, but if treated with caution, provides useful information[ii]. Lake was said to be humble, affable and, in an era when distinctions of rank were prized, even the poorest found it easy to gain access to speak to him[iii].\n\nLake was said to be austere in his diet, not eating any supper four times a week[iv]. He also apparently was not one for outward show, but enjoyed the company of fellow scholars. This contradicts his biographer’s later claim that Lake was a very hospitable and generous host, who at Worcester Deanery, “entertained the better sort with that splendour, and the meaner with that bountie and munificience, that the whole countrie rings of to this day” [v].\n\nIf Lake’s biographer depicts at times a frugal way of life, he also noted that he used his wealth to help others. This could be by helping the poor in the streets or those who came to his gates, or in helping poorer students get a university education through funding exhibitions (scholarships)[vi]. He funded lectures at New College Oxford in Hebrew and Mathematics. His biographer claimed he founded libraries at Worcester and Wells Cathedrals[vii]. These libraries had existed since the middle ages. Worcester does hold a printed set of St. John Chrysostom’s writings donated by Lake. He donated other books to Wells Cathedral Library. He was also appointed Vice Chancellor of Oxford for a year. On his death he left most of his books to New College Oxford[viii].\n\nLake’s surviving sermons and meditations on psalms or religious themes were published posthumously. Their analysis is thankfully a job for theologians. He was certainly seen as a great preacher of his day due to his knowledge of the Bible and the writings of the Early Church Fathers.\n\nOccasionally, his sermons offer a glimpse into Lake’s wider thinking. There was an important sermon he gave in front of King Charles I, the Lords, and others of the Upper House of Parliament in July 1625 on references in the Book of Kings[ix]. In this he compared Biblical references of the plague to the experiences of England in the early seventeenth century and related it to problems that affected contemporary peoples’ lives. He criticized the rich’s selfish behaviour in not sharing food with the poor in times of great hardship, people’s poor behaviour when they did not follow Christian principles, the dangers of wars which often brought famine and pestilence, as well as the need to protect society against recusants.\n\nIn an Easter sermon preached to the court at Whitehall published in 1629, Lake, as Bishop of Bath and Wells, gave a view of the country’s economic problems.\n\n‘The evil of the days wherein we live do give me occasion to complain, not only that there is variety of corruption in trades, dangerous, because some are over thriving, but also of the decay of trades no less dangerous, because there are so many thousands that have no means to thrive at all. Governors give order for houses of correction, and no doubt but if they were better used, vagrants might be restrained thereby, but there must be moreover an increase of trades that must employ the common people…; while the gentleman depopulates the country, and the usurer and victualler are become the chief tradesmen of incorporations, what wonder is contrary to God’s law and the King’s whole land be filled with miserable poor. There is no true, at least no full remedy for this evil, but they to whom the care of distributive justice is committed must revive and quicken the commutative, and make our land according unto that good opportunity which God has given us, a house of merchandize.’[x]\n\nWhat Lake meant was a society should work by ‘commutative justice’, ensuring that nobody suffered hardship as a result of the trading practices of another. To do this, the ruler had what Lake described as ‘distributive justice’ or rewards and punishments: A plea for protection against speculation and unjust profiteering brought on by an economic downturn.\n\nAs Dean, Lake managed church business. Property agreements would be drawn up in his name and all Treasurer’s accounts would have to be signed off by the Dean and Chapter. He earned over c.£132 per year[xi]. Lake contributed £20 towards the new organ, built in the Cathedral in 1613[xii]. This donation matched that of Bishop Parry and the City of Worcester’s contribution, all three of whom contributed the largest gifts of money for the project.\n\nSo, Lake was genial, intelligent, a great preacher, favoured by the King, and a respected man in society who donated money to help the Cathedral’s musical tradition and for educational purposes. Perhaps historians will shed more light on his attitudes in future years.\n\nDavid Morrison\n\ni Anthony Wood, Athenae Oxonienses.
