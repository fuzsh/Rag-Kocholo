One precocious six-year-old boy piped up and said, “My mommy prays with me every night!”\n\n“That’s wonderful,” said the pastor. “What does she say when she prays with you? Do you use a certain prayer?”\n\n“Oh, no,” the boy replied, “She just says, ‘Thank you, God. He’s in bed!'”\n\n* * * * *\n\nYou Can’t Beat a Dead Horse Joke\n\nThe country pastor approached the deacon one Sunday after worship. “Say, deacon,” he said. “A horse died out in front of the church during worship.”\n\n“Well, it’s the job of the pastor to look after the dead,” replied the deacon. “Why tell me?”\n\n“You’re right, it is my job,” said the pastor. “But we always notify the next of kin first.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nAfter the third time that the father told his son and daughter to be quiet in church, the daughter pouted and asked, “Why do we have to be quiet in church?”\n\nHer brother quickly chimed in, “Because people are sleeping!”\n\n* * * * *\n\nSpare Parts\n\nThe keynote speaker was in such a hurry to get to the venue that when he arrived and sat down at the head table, he suddenly realized that had forgotten his dentures.\n\nTurning to the man next to him, he whispered, “I forgot my teeth!”\n\nThe man said, “No problem.” With that he reached into his briefcase and pulled out a pair of dentures. “Try these,” he said. The speaker tried them. “Too loose,” he said.\n\nThe man dug around in his briefcase again. “Here, try these.”\n\nThe speaker tried them and responded. “Too tight.”\n\nThe man didn’t seem taken aback at all. He dug around in his briefcase again. “Here. I have this pair. Give them a try.”\n\nThe speaker smiled. “They fit perfectly.” He ate his meal and gave his speech without any further troubles.\n\nAfter the event concluded, the speaker went over to thank his benefactor and return the spare parts.\n\n“I want to thank you for coming to my rescue. Where is your office? I’ve been looking for a good dentist.”\n\n“Oh, I’m not a dentist,” the man replied. “I’m the local funeral director.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nOverhead on Noah’s Ark\n\n1. “Did anyone think about bringing a couple of umbrellas?”\n\n2. “Hey, there are more than two flies in here!”\n\n3. “Wasn’t someone supposed to bring some shovels?”\n\n4. “Okay, who’s the wise guy who let the mosquitoes on board?”\n\n5. “Don’t make me pull this ark over and come back there!”\n\n6. “Steak for dinner? We didn’t bring any steak with us. Uh.Oh.”\n\n7. “Are we there yet?”\n\n* * * * *\n\nJesus Returns\n\nThe pastor was working in his office one day when the church secretary came scurrying through the door, out of breath.\n\n“Pastor, Pastor, I have news!” she said, trying to regain her composure.\n\n“Well, what’s the news?” asked the perplexed pastor.\n\n“Jesus is coming. He’s back, and he’s coming here right now. What should we do?”\n\nThe pastor smiled, turned back to his computer and answered, “Look busy.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nFollowing the pastor’s fiery sermon on sin, one recent convert soughth him out for a clarification.\n\n“I’m not sure if i’ve actually died to sin,” he said, “but it makes me sick to my stomach on a regular basis.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nOur church has a singles ministry called SALT (Single Adults Learning Together). During a recent service, our minister mentioned SALT in the announcements. “If any of you are single,” he told the congregation, “be sure to check out SALT. Those initials stand for …” The minister paused a moment before continuing. At last he seemed to remember their meaning. “They stand for Single Adults Living Together.”\n\n–Carolyn Bolz, Riverside, CA. Today’s Christian Woman, “Heart to Heart.”\n\nHow to Keep a Child Still in Worship\n\nThe pastor recalls, “After a recent worship service the mother of a fidgety seven-year-old boy told me how she finally got her son to sit still and be quiet. About halfway through the sermon, she leaned over and whispered, ‘If you don’t be quiet, the preacher is going to lose his place and will have to start his sermon all over again!’ It worked!”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThings you’ll never hear in church:\n\n– Hey! It’s MY turn to sit on the front pew!\n\n– I was so enthralled, I never noticed your sermon went over time 25 minutes.\n\n– Personally, I find witnessing much more enjoyable than golf.\n\n– I’ve decided to give our church the $500.00 a month I used to send to TV evangelists.\n\n– I volunteer to be the permanent teacher for the Junior High Sunday School class.\n\n– Forget the denominational minimum salary: let’s pay our pastor so s/he can live like we do.\n\n-I love it when we sing hymns I’ve never heard before!\n\n-Since we’re all here, let’s start the worship service early!\n\n-Pastor, this winter we’d like to send you to this Bible seminar in the Bahamas.\n\n– Nothing inspires me and strengthens my commitment like our annual stewardship campaign!\n\n* * * * *\n\nA distraught man sought the advice of his wise pastor. “I was born blind,” he exclaimed, “But some people tell me that if I had more faith I could be healed.”\n\nThe pastor paused a moment before speaking.\n\n“I see you carry a cane,” she said. “Whenvever people say that, hit them over the head with the cane. Then tell them if they had more faith it wouldn’t hurt!”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThere was a very gracious lady who was mailing an old family Bible to her brother in another part of the country.\n\n“Is there anything breakable in here?” asked the postal clerk.\n\n“Only the Ten Commandments,” answered the lady.\n\nThe Pope and the Business Man\n\nDuring an audience at the Vatican, a businessman approached the Pope with an offer: Change the last line of the Lord’s prayer from “give us this day our daily bread” to “give us this day our daily chicken.” and KFC will donate $10 million to Catholic charities. The Pope declined. Two weeks later he was back, this time with a $50 million offer. Again the Pope declined. A month later the man offers $100 million, and this time the Pope accepts.\n\nAt a meeting of the Cardinals, The Pope announces his decision in the good news/bad news format. The good news is… that we have $100 million for charities. The bad news is that we lost the Wonder Bread account!\n\n* * * * *\n\nAfter two hours of meeting, the chair of Committee on Church Growth was ready to call it a night.\n\n“Unless anybody has another idea besides calling every service Easter or Christmas,” she said, “I’ll accept a motion to adjourn.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nSome ministers were talking about death and dying over coffee at the local cafe. “What would you want people to say about you at your funeral?” one of them asked.\n\n“I’d want people to say, ‘He was a great and compassionate humanitarian who cared about those in need,” responded a recently retired minister.\n\n“I’d like for people to say, ‘He was a good father and husband, a man whose life was a fine example for others to follow,” intoned another.\n\n“Oh, I’d like for people to remember me for my fine sermons and church growth,” said the newest member of the group.\n\nA grizzled old farmer leaned over from the next table and said, “That’s all well and good, fellas, but I’d rather hear ’em say ‘Look, he’s moving!'”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Best Way to Pray\n\nA priest, a minister and a guru sat discussing the best positions for prayer, while a telephone repairman worked nearby\n\n“Kneeling is definitely the best way to pray,” the priest said.\n\n“No,” said the minister. “I get the best results standing with my hands outstretched to Heaven.”\n\n“You’re both wrong,” the guru said. “The most effective prayer position is lying down on the floor.”\n\nThe repairman could contain himself no longer. “Hey, fellas,” he interrupted. “The best prayin’ I ever did was when I was hangin’ upside down from a telephone pole.”\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nCan I Get a Testi-money?\n\nIt was testimony time at the church stewardship committee meeting.\n\n“I’m very rich,” one man said. “I am very rich because God has blessed me. I am rich because when I was a young man, with only $1 in my pocket, I heard an address by a missionary. The Spirit told me to give everything I had to that missionary. So I gave that dollar.”\n\nA fellow committee member tapped him on the shoulder. “I dare you to do it again,” she said.\n\n* * * * *\n\nA Cat-achism Baptism\n\nThe young son of a Baptist minister was in church one morning when he saw for the first time the rite of baptism by immersion. He was greatly interested in it, and the next morning proceeded to baptize his three cats in the bathtub.\n\nThe first kitten bore it very well, and so did the other young cat, but the old family cat rebelled. It struggled with him, clawed and tore him, and got away.\n\nWith considerable effort he caught it again and proceeded with the ceremony. But she acted worse than ever, clawed at him, spit, and scratched his hands and face.\n\nFinally, after barely getting her splattered with water, he dropped her on the floor in disgust and said: “Fine, be an Atheist.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nPurely Academic\n\nPhilosophy is a game with objectives and no rules.\n\nMathematics is a game with rules and no objectives.\n\nTheology is a game whose object is to bring rules into the subjective.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhile shaking hands with the pastor after worship, Mrs. Jones noticed that he had a rather bad cut on his face.\n\n“Why pastor, what happened? How did you cut your face?,” she asked.\n\n“Well, I was thinking about my sermon this morning while I was shaving,” the pastor replied. “I guess I wasn’t concentrating and cut myself in the process.”\n\n“That’s too bad,” Mrs. Jones replied. “Next time you should concentrate on your shaving and cut your sermon.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nAnd those bulletin blooper continue with more zingers from actual church publications. Enjoy!\n\nThe sermon this morning: ‘Jesus Walks on the Water.’ The sermon tonight: ‘Searching for Jesus.’\n\n————————–\n\nLadies, don’t forget the rummage sale. It’s a chance to get rid of those things not worth keeping around the house. Bring your husbands.\n\n————————–\n\nRemember in prayer the many who are sick of our community.

Say ‘Hell, to someone who doesn’t care much about you.\n\n————————–\n\nDon’t let worry kill you off – let the Church help.\n\n————————–\n\nIrving Benson and Jessie Carter were married on October 24 in the church.

They worked just fine, but the Rev. Jones ordered them removed after someone scrawled a note on the wall next to it: “For the pastor’s latest sermon, push here!”\n\n* * * * *\n\nA Little Help from Joseph\n\nOne day during our children’s sermon, I was telling the kids about how the angel came to Mary to tell her about how she would help bring Jesus into the world. One little girl seemed puzzled about this whole scene. Then another child asked what I thought the first thing Mary would have asked for after the angel left her. Instantly this little girl chimed in with “I’ll bet she asked for a little help from Joseph!\n\n* * * * *\n\nSeen on the door of a church nursery:\n\n1 Corinthians 15:51\n\n“Behold, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Sidestitch Spouse\n\nAt Sunday School they were teaching how God created everything, including human beings. Little Johnny seemed especially intent when they told him how Eve was created out of one of Adam’s ribs. Later in the week his mother noticed him lying down as though he were ill, and said, “Johnny, what is the matter?” Little Johnny responded, “I have pain in my side. I think I’m going to have a wife.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhat Denomination?\n\nA woman went into a post office to buy some stamps for her Christmas cards. What denomination do you want ? asked the lady at the counter. ‘Good God!’ she replied, Has it come to this? I suppose you’d better give me twenty Catholic and twenty Presbyterian.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSPELLCHECK CHURCH BULLETIN BLOOPERS\n\nThe spring retreat will be hell May 10th and 11th.\n\nThe senior choir invites any member of the congregation who enjoys sinning to join.\n\nThe outreach committee has enlisted twenty-five members to make calls on people who are not afflicted with any church.\n\nThe third verse will be sung without musical accomplishment.\n\nThe agenda was adopted. The minutes were approved. The financial secretary gave a grief report.\n\nPastor is on vacation. Massages can be given to the church secretary.\n\nUshers will eat latecomers.\n\nAttend and you will hear and excellent speaker and heave a healthy lunch.\n\n*****\n\nPECANS IN THE CEMETERY\n\nOn the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just inside the cemetery fence. One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.\n\n“One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,” said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.\n\nAnother boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, “One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me…”\n\nHe just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.\n\n“Come here quick,” said the boy, “you won’t believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!”\n\nThe man said, “Beat it kid, can’t you see it’s hard for me to walk.” When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.\n\nStanding by the fence they heard, “One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.”\n\nThe old man whispered, “Boy, you’ve been tellin’ me the truth. Let’s see if we can see the Lord…?”\n\nShaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.\n\nAt last they heard, “One for you, one for me. That’s all. Now let’s go get those nuts by the fence and we’ll be done…”\n\nThey say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe pastor’s college-age daughter came running to her in tears. “Mom, you gave me some terrible financial advice!”\n\n“I did? What did I tell you?” said her mother.\n\n“You told me to put my money in that big bank, and now that big bank is in trouble.”\n\n“That’s one of the largest and best banks in the state,” she said. “There must be some mistake.”\n\n“I don’t think so,” she sniffed. “They just returned one of my checks with a note saying, ‘Insufficient Funds’.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nEino, a Finn from Cook County in northern Minnesota, was an older, single gentleman who was born and raised a Lutheran. Each Friday night after work, he would fire up his outdoor grill and cook a venison steak.\n\nNow, all of Eino’s neighbors were Catholic…..and since it was Lent, they were forbidden from eating meat on Fridays. The delicious aroma from the grilled venison steaks was causing such a problem for the Catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest. The priest came to visit Eino, and suggested that Eino convert to Catholicism.\n\nAfter several classes and much study, Eino attended Mass…..and as the priest sprinkled holy water over Eino, he said, “You were born a Lutheran and raised a Lutheran, but now you are Catholic.”\n\nEino’s neighbors were greatly relieved, until Friday night arrived, and the wonderful aroma of grilled venison filled the neighborhood.\n\nThe priest was called immediately by the neighbors and, as he rushed into Eino’s yard, clutching a rosary and prepared to scold Eino, he stopped in amazement and watched……\n\nThere stood Eino, clutching a small bottle of water which he carefully sprinkled over the grilling meat, and chanting: “You were born a deer, and raised a deer, but now you are a walleye.\n\n* * * * *\n\nShare and Share Alike\n\nA couple whose marriage was on the rocks sought the advice of their pastor. The pastor encouraged them to patch up their quarrel and keep their vows, but the couple was adamant.\n\n“Well,” said the pastor, “you know the consequences if you insist on a divorce. Remember this: you must divide your property equally.”\n\nThe wife flared up. “You mean the $4,000 I have saved up? I must give him half? My money?”\n\n“Yes,” said the pastor. “He gets $2,000. You get $2,000.”\n\n“What about my furniture? I paid for that.”\n\n“Same thing,” answered the pastor. “You split it equally.”\n\nThere was a challenging gleam in the wife’s eye. “What about our three children?”\n\nThe pastor was stumped at first but then quickly came up with a Solomonic solution. “Go back and live together until your fourth child is born. Then you take two children and your husband takes two.”\n\nThe wife shook her head. “No, I’m sure that wouldn’t work out. If I depended on him, I wouldn’t have the three I’ve got.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Stud\n\nTwo priests die at the same time and meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates. St. Peter said, “I’d like to get you guys in now, but our computer is down. You’ll have to go back to Earth for about a week, but you can’t go back as priests. So what else would you like to be?”\n\nThe first priest says, “I’ve always wanted to be an eagle, soaring above the Rocky Mountains.”\n\n“So be it,” says St. Peter, and off flies the first priest.\n\nThe second priest asks, “Will any of this week ‘count’, St. Peter?”\n\n“No,” he says. “I told you the computer’s down. There’s no way we can keep track of what you’re doing.”\n\n“In that case. I’ve always wanted to be a stud.”\n\n“So be it,” says St. Peter, and the second priest disappears.\n\nWhen the computer is running again, God asks St. Peter to recall the two priests. “Will you have any trouble locating them?”\n\n“The first one should be easy,” says St. Peter. “He’s somewhere over the Rockies, flying with the eagles. But the second one could prove to be more difficult” He’s on a snow tire, somewhere in North Dakota.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe New Baby\n\nAfter the birth of his baby brother, a little boy was thoroughly annoyed at all of his crying and screaming.\n\n“Where did we get him anyway?” he asked his mother.\n\n“He came from heaven!” his mother replied.\n\n“Well I can see why they threw him out!” the boy replied.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFine Dining and Divine Frugality\n\nGod greets Mother Teresa at the Pearly Gates. “Thou be hungry, Mother Teresa?” saith God. “I could eat,” Mother Teresa replies. So God opens a can of tuna and reaches for a chunk of rye bread and they share it.\n\nWhile eating this humble meal, Mother Teresa looks down into Hell and sees the inhabitants devouring huge steaks, lobsters, pheasants, pastries and fine wines. Curious, but deeply trusting, Mother Teresa remains quiet.\n\nThe next day God again invites Mother Teresa to join him for a meal. Again, it is tuna and rye bread. Once again looking down, Mother Teresa can see the denizens of Hell enjoying caviar, champagne, lamb, truffles and chocolates. Still Mother Teresa says nothing.\n\nThe following day, mealtime arrives and another can of tuna is opened. Mother Teresa can’t contain herself any longer. Meekly, she says: “God, I am grateful to be in heaven with you as a reward for the pious, obedient life I led. But here in heaven all I get to eat is tuna and a\n\npiece of rye bread and in the Other Place they eat like emperors and kings! Forgive me, O God, but I just don’t understand…”\n\nGod sighs. “Let’s be honest, Mother Teresa,” he says. “For just two people, does it pay to cook?!”\n\n* * * * *\n\nFred was very old, sick, and doctors said he would not l and dying. There was an elderly man at home in his bed, dying. He smelled the aroma of his favorite chocolate chip cookies baking in the kitchen downstairs, and he wanted one last cookie before he died. His life fading, he made his way down the stairs and crawled into the kitchen where his wife was busily baking cookies.\n\nWith his last remaining strength, he crawled to the table and was just barely able to lift his withered arm to the cookie sheet. As he grasped a warm, moist chocolate chip cookie, his favorite kind, his wife suddenly whacked his hand with a spatula.\n\nGasping for breath, he asked her, “Why did you do that?”\n\n“Those are for the funeral.\n\n* * * * *\n\nNot Broken\n\nAfter examining the miserly tips left by a church group, our waitress was not pleased. Looking toward my table, she grumbled, “These people come in with the Ten Commandments and a ten-dollar bill, and they don’t break any of them!”\n\n+ + + + +\n\nEverybody Pull!\n\nAn out-of-town pastor drove his car into a ditch in a desolated area. Luckily, a local farmer came to help with his big strong horse, named Buddy. He hitched Buddy up to the car and yelled, “Pull, Martha, pull!” Buddy didn’t move.\n\nThen the farmer hollered, “Pull, Peter, pull!” Buddy didn’t respond.\n\nOnce more the farmer commanded, “Pull, Jezebel, pull!”\n\nNothing.\n\nThen the farmer nonchalantly said, “Pull, Buddy, pull!” And the horse easily\n\ndragged the car out of the ditch.\n\nThe pastor was most appreciative and very curious. He asked the farmer why he called his horse by the wrong name three times.\n\nThe farmer said, “Oh, Buddy is blind and if he thought he was the only one\n\npulling, he wouldn’t even try.”\n\nStewardship Application: Buddy’s sort of like a church member on stewardship Sunday. Christians need to know others have “skin in the game” too. Don’t holler “Whoa, mule!” before you even get started. Make it a team effort–even if you have to pull in the “invisible” reserve players.\n\n* * * * *\n\nMary was surprised to receive $10 from her uncle for her birthday. The uncle asked how she was going to spend it.\n\nMary said, “I’m taking it to Sunday School to put in the offering. God’s gonna be just as surprised as I was at not getting a dollar like usual!”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe new minister in the local congregation learned that one of the wealthiest members on the roll was not a regular contributor or attender, so he made a phone call.\n\n“From all appearances your business is doing quite well, yet you haven’t given a penny to your own church,” the pastor began. “Wouldn’t you like to help us in ministry this year?”\n\nThe lapsed member replied, “Did you know that my mother is ill, with extremely expensive medical bills?”\n\n“Um, no,” mumbled the pastor.\n\n“Or that my brother is blind and unemployed? Or that my sister’s husband died, leaving her broke with four kids?”\n\n“I … I … I had no idea.”\n\n“So,” said the member, “if I don’t give them any money, why would I give any to the church?”\n\n* * * * *\n\nAn archeologist, a pastor, and an entomologist were discussing the ongoing search for Noah’s ark.\n\n“I have faith that we will find it one day,” opined the pastor.\n\n“I agree,” said the archeologist, “but you need my scientific skill and expertise.”\n\n“You’re both wrong,” sniffed the entomologist. “I can guarantee that the ark will never be found.”\n\n“How can you be so sure?” asked the other two.\n\n“Well, if it’s true Noah included two of every critter, then the termites have taken care of the evidence,” replied the entomologist.\n\n* * * * *\n\nA preacher went into his church and he was praying to God. While he was praying, he asked God, “How long is 10 million years to you?” God replied, “1 second.” The next day the preacher asked God, “God, how much is 10 million dollars to you?” And God replied, “A penny.” Then finally the next day the preacher asked God, “God, can I have one of your pennies?” And God replied, “Just wait a sec.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Preacher and his Horse\n\nA circuit-riding preacher trained his horse to go when he said, “Praise the Lord,” and to stop when he said, “Amen.” The preacher mounted the horse, said “Praise the Lord,” and went for a ride in the nearby mountains.\n\nWhen he wanted to stop for lunch by a mountain stream, he said, “Amen.”\n\nHe took off again, saying “Praise the Lord.”\n\nThe horse started heading toward the edge of a cliff on a narrow mountain trail. The preacher got excited and said, “Whoa!” Then he remembered and said, “Amen,” and the horse stopped just short of the edge. The preacher was so relieved that he looked up to heaven and said, “Praise the Lord!”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Chief Hog\n\nA church secretary answered the phone and heard the caller say, “I want to talk to the chief hog of the trough.”\n\n“Sir,” she replied, “that is no way to talk about the Reverend. He is the pastor of this church.”\n\n“Sorry, Lady,” he said. “I just wanted to donate $100,000 to the church.”\n\nQuickly she said, “Just a minute.

The agent who opened the letter was so impressed, touched, and amused that he sent the little boy a $5.00 bill, thinking this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy. The little boy was delighted with the $5.00, and sat down to write a thank-you note to the Lord. It said: Dear Lord, Thank you very much for sending me the money. However, I noticed that for some reason you had to send it through the IRS and as usual, those jerks deducted $95.\n\n*****\n\nHYMN # 365\n\nA minister was preaching a sermon about the evils of alcohol.

Three days later the squirrels were back.\n\nThe Lutherans came up with the best and most effective solution.

Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.\n\nAnother boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, “One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.”\n\nHe just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.\n\n“Come here quick,” said the boy, “you won’t believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls.”\n\nThe man said, “Beat it kid, can’t you see it’s hard for me to walk.” When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.\n\nStanding by the fence they heard, “One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me…”\n\nThe old man whispered, “Boy, you’ve been tellin’ me the truth. Let’s see if we can see the Lord.”\n\nShaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.\n\nAt last they heard, “One for you, one for me. That’s all. Now let’s go get those nuts by the fence and we’ll be done.”\n\nThey say the old man made it back to town a full 5 minutes ahead of the kid on the bike.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Christian barber had been thinking he should share his faith with his customers more, and one night in pryer he decided to witness to the first customer who walked in the next morning.\n\nSoon after he opened his shop the first man came in and said, “I want a shave!”\n\nThe barber said, “Certainly. I’ll be with you in a moment.” He went in the back of his shop and prayed: “Lord, I’m going to witness to this man, so help me to know just the right thing to say.

It happened again the next week!\n\nThe following Sunday, he watched as the offering was collected and saw an elderly woman put the distinctive pink envelope on the plate. This went on for weeks until the pastor, overcome by curiosity, approached her.\n\n“Ma’am, I couldn’t help but notice that you put $1,000 a week in the collection plate,” he stated.\n\n“Why, yes,” she replied, “every week my son sends me money, and I give some of it to the church.”\n\nThe pastor replied, “That’s wonderful. But $1,000 is a lot; are you sure you can afford this? How much does he send you?”\n\nThe elderly woman answered, “$10,000 a week.”\n\nThe pastor was amazed. “Your son is very successful; what does he do for a living?”\n\n“He is a veterinarian,” she answered.\n\n“That’s an honorable profession……I had no idea they made that much money,” the pastor said….”Where does he practice?”\n\nThe woman answered proudly, “In Nevada…He has two cat houses, one in Las Vegas, and one in Reno!!!”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe village pastor was known for his weakness for trout.

Take the beach chair and the Bible to the water’s edge, sit down in the beach chair, and put the Bible in your lap. Open the Bible; the wind will rifle the pages, but finally the open Bible will come to rest on a page. Look down at the page and read the first thing you see. That will be your answer, that will tell you what to do.”\n\nA year later the businessman went back to the priest and brought his wife and children with him. The man was in a new custom-tailored suit, his wife in a mink coat, the children shining. The businessman pulled an envelope stuffed with money out of his pocket, gave it to the priest as a donation in thanks for his advice.\n\nThe priest recognized the benefactor, and was curious. “You did as I suggested?” he asked.\n\n“Absolutely,” replied the businessman.\n\n“You went to the beach?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\n“You sat in a beach chair with the Bible in your lap?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\n“You let the pages rifle until they stopped?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\n“And what were the first words you saw?”\n\n“Chapter 11.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe choir director became peeved when a buzzing insect distracted the singers during practice.

Further down the road, Our Lord came upon a blind man, had compassion on him, and healed him. A little further down the road, Jesus came upon a man sitting on the curb sobbing his heart out. Jesus asked him what was wrong.

Else has been with us for many years and for every one of those years, Someone did far more than a normal person’s share of the work.\n\nWhenever there was a job to do, a class to teach, or a meeting to attend, one name was on everyone’s list, “Let Someone Else do it.” Whenever leadership was mentioned, this wonderful person was looked to for inspiration as well as results; “Someone Else can work with that group.”\n\nIt was common knowledge that Someone Else was among the most generous givers in our church. Whenever there was a financial need, everyone just assumed Someone Else would make up the difference.\n\nSomeone Else was a wonderful person; sometimes appearing superhuman.

So what else would you like to be?”\n\nThe first priest says, “I’ve always wanted to be an eagle, soaring above the Rocky Mountains.”\n\n“So be it,” says St. Peter, and off flies the first priest.\n\nThe second priest asks, “Will any of this week ‘count’, St. Peter?”\n\n“No,” he says. “I told you the computer’s down. There’s no way we can keep track of what you’re doing.”\n\n“In that case. I’ve always wanted to be a stud.”\n\n“So be it,” says St. Peter, and the second priest disappears.\n\nWhen the computer is running again, God asks St. Peter to recall the two priests. “Will you have any trouble locating them?”\n\n“The first one should be easy,” says St. Peter. “He’s somewhere over the Rockies, flying with the eagles. But the second one could prove to be more difficult” He’s on a snow tire, somewhere in North Dakota.”\n\n*****\n\nA man died and went to heaven. He was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter who led him down the golden streets.

But the next day he pulled the starter rope again and again, but it would not start, no matter what he tried.\n\nFinally he called the seller and accused him of deception. “I said the mower runs great, NOT that it starts great,” the man reminded him. “But there is a secret. You have to cuss at the mower — really let it know who’s boss.”\n\nThe preacher was aghast. “I haven’t cussed in years,” he said. “I don’t think I remember how.” The seller chuckled a bit and said, “Well, if you keep pulling on that starter rope, eventually it’ll all come back to you.”\n\n*****\n\nFun Quotes\n\n“Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.” Benjamin Franklin\n\n“Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.” Albert Einstein\n\n“How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg?

Several weeks later the pastor bumped into him again. This time the man wore a pair of kakhi slacks, penny loafers and a buttondown shirt. “Why didn’t I see you at church?” the pastor asked. “Well,” the man began, “Last Sunday I showered, shaved and put on the clothes you gave me.

He responds that he has faith in god and god will give him a miracle.

He arrives at the gates of heaven with broken faith and says to Peter, I thought God would grant me a miracle and I have been let down.” St. Peter chuckles and responds, “I don’t know what you’re complaining about, we sent you three boats and a helicopter.”\n\n*****\n\nA Sunday school teacher challenged her children to take some time on Sunday afternoon to write a letter to God.

There are too many good programs that you’re missing.\n\n6. Procrastinate more. You didn’t want to do it anyway.\n\n5. Drink more alcohol. It’s no fun being sober.\n\n4. Start being more superstitious.\n\n3. Spend more time at work. The boss won’t approve time off anyway.\n\n2. Stop bringing food from home. There are plenty of fast food restaurants.\n\n1. Take up a new habit. Smoking? Swearing? Drinking? All three?\n\n*****\n\nThe pastor was out Christmas shopping for his family when he saw a great train set display in the high-end toy store. After 10 minutes of rapt watching, he told the sales woman, “I’ll take it.”\n\n“Your son will really like it,” she beamed.\n\nThe pastor thought a moment and said, “In that case, I’ll take two.”\n\n*****\n\nA guy bought his wife a beautiful diamond ring for Christmas.\n\nAfter hearing about this extravagant gift, a friend of his said, “I thought she wanted one of those sporty four-wheel-drive vehicles.”\n\n“She did,” he replied. “But where was I going to find a fake Jeep?”\n\n*****\n\nThe pastor always used the phrase, “It might be worse,” when some calamity would come his way. One day a friend said to him, “I’ve something to tell you, and you won’t be able to use your favorite phrase. I dreamt last night that I died and went to hell.” “It might be worse,” said the preacher. The friend came unglued: “man alive, how could it be worse?” to which the pastor replied: “it might be true.”\n\n*****\n\nNo sooner had the church installed hot-air hand dryers in the rest rooms when the pastor called for them to be removed. The units worked fine, but some wag had written on the wall above the dryer in the men’s room, “Push button for a sample our pastor’s preaching.”\n\n*****\n\nFour pastors were on vacation when one of them confessed he had a problem with alcohol. He knew these men, his most trusted and valued friends, would quietly help him.\n\nThe second pastor said that he too, had a secret vice — gambling.\n\nThe third pastor confided that lust was a really big issue for him.\n\nThe fourth pastor announced that he also had a problem: gossip.\n\n*****\n\nTwo ministers met in the after life. One said, “Isn’t heaven wonderful after the parish ministry?”\n\nThe other said, “This isn’t heaven!”\n\n*****\n\nFor the umpteenth time Mrs. Jones told her pastor, “I’m so scared! My husband says he’s going to kill me if I continue to come to your church.”\n\n“Yes, yes, my child,” replied the pastor, tired of hearing this before. “I will continue to pray for you, Mrs. Jones. Have faith – the Lord will watch over you.”\n\n“Oh yes, he has kept me safe thus far, only…..”\n\n“Only what, my child?”\n\n“Now he says if I keep coming to your church, he’s going to kill YOU!”\n\n“Well,” said the pastor. “Perhaps it’s time to check out that little church on the other side of town.”\n\n*****\n\nA bishop visited a church in his jurisdiction. Only three people turned up to hear him preach.\n\nHe asked the pastor, “Did you publicize my visit?”\n\n“No,” replied the pastor, “but word seems to have gotten around anyway”.\n\n*****\n\nTwo pastors were discussing the decline in morals in the modern world.\n\n“I didn’t sleep with my wife before I was married,” said one clergyman self-righteously, “Did you?”\n\n“I don’t know,” said the other. “What was her maiden name?”\n\n*****\n\nLying in the hospital bed, a dying man began to flail about and make motions as if he would like to speak. The pastor, keeping watch at the side of his bed, leaned quietly over and asked, “Do you have something you would like to say?”\n\nThe man nodded, and the pastor handed him a pad and pen.\n\n”Use this to write a note and I will give it to your wife. She’s on her way.”\n\nGathering his last bit of strength, the scrawled his message and then died.\n\nThe pastor folded the note without reading it, then maintained a vigil until the wife arrived. When she came, he handed her the note, “His last words,” the pastor said. She fainted when she read, “GET OFF MY OXYGEN HOSE!”\n\n*****\n\nThe young pastor was excited when they asked him to preach one Sunday in prison, but he was also very nervous .\n\nOn the day he arrived at the prison, he was greeted by a large group of prisoners waiting to hear him. As the young pastor walked and stood behind the pulpit, he said, “Good morning. It’s so good to see you here!”\n\n*****\n\nA man had a habit of grumbling at the food his wife placed before him at family meals. Then he would ask the blessing.\n\nOne day after his usual combination complaint-prayer, his little girl asked, “Daddy, does God hear us when we pray?”\n\n“Why, of course,” he replied. “He hears us every time we pray.”\n\nShe pauses on this a moment, and asked, “Does he hear everything we say the rest of the time?”\n\n“Yes, dear, every word,” he replied, encouraged that he had inspired his daughter to be curious about spiritual matters.\n\nHowever, his pride was quickly turned to humility…\n\n“Then which does God believe?”\n\n*****\n\nWhen the pastor arrived at the family’s house for dinner, the little girl informed him that her mama was cooking buzzard for dinner.\n\n“We’re having chicken,” her father reassured the pastor.\n\n“But daddy,” the daughter exclaimed, “I heard Mommy tell you we were having the old buzzard for dinner.”\n\n*****\n\nA climber fell off a cliff, and as he tumbled down, he caught hold of a small branch wedged in the rock.\n\n“HELP! IS THERE ANYBODY UP THERE?” he shouted.\n\nA majestic voice boomed through the gorge:\n\n“I will help you, my son, but first you must have faith in me.”\n\n“Yes, yes, I trust you!” cried the man.\n\n“Let go of the branch,” boomed the voice.\n\nThere was a long pause, and the man shouted up again, “IS THERE ANYONE ELSE UP THERE I COULD TALK TO?”\n\n*****\n\n“Thanks for the generous donation,” the church treasurer said, looking at a check she had just been handed.\n\nThe donor smiled. “Well, you can thank the Holy Spirit.”\n\nThe treasurer rolled her eyes. “C’mon. It wasn’t that generous.”\n\n*****\n\nThe greatest surprise of Mary’s life was receiving a dollar on her fourth birthday. She carried the bill about the house and was seen sitting on the stairs admiring it.\n\n“What are you going to do with your dollar?” her mother asked.\n\n“Take it to Sunday School,” said Mary promptly.\n\n“To show your teacher?” Mary shook her head.\n\n“No,” she said. “I’m going to give it to God. He’ll be as surprised as I am to get something besides pennies.”\n\n*****\n\nMy first job was working in an orange juice factory, but I got canned…couldn’t concentrate.\n\nThen I worked in the woods as a lumberjack, but I just couldn’t hack it, so they gave me the ax.\n\nAfter that I tried to be a tailor, but I just wasn’t suited for it …mainly because it was a so-so job.\n\nNext I tried working in a muffler factory but that was too exhausting.\n\nThen I tried to be a chef — figured it would add a little spice to my life, but I just didn’t have the thyme.\n\nI attempted to be a deli worker, but any way I sliced it, I couldn’t cut the mustard.\n\nMy best job was being a musician, but eventually I found I wasn’t noteworthy.\n\nI studied a long time to become a doctor, but I didn’t have any patience.\n\nI became a professional fisherman, but discovered that I couldn’t live on my net income.\n\nI managed to get a good job working for a pool maintenance company, but the work was just too draining.\n\nSo then I got a job in a workout center, but they said I wasn’t fit for the job.\n\nAfter many years of trying to find steady work I finally got a job as a historian until I realized there was no future in it.\n\nMy last job was working at Starbucks, but I had to quit because it was always the same old grind.\n\n*****\n\nThe visitor was curious when he saw the Bible verse on the door from 1 Corinthians 15:51: “Behold, I tell you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.”\n\nIt all became clear when the visitor realized the door was to the nursery.\n\n*****\n\nRecreation is my shepherd, I shall not stay at home; It maketh me to lie down in a sleeping bag; It leadeth me down the interstate each weekend.\n\nIt restoreth my suntan; It leadeth me to state parks for comfort’s sake. Even though I stray on the Lord’s Day, I will fear no reprimand, for I am relaxed; My rod and reel they comfort me.\n\nI anointed my skin with oil, My gas tank runneth dry; Surely my trailer shall follow me all the weekends of summer, And I shall return to the house of the Lord this fall.\n\nBut by then, it will be hunting season and football season, And that’s another psalm.\n\n*****\n\nQ: How many independent Baptists does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: Only one – any more than that and it might seem like an ecumenical activity.\n\nQ: How many Presbyterians does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: It doesn’t matter, as long as it’s done decently and in order.\n\nQ: How many Unitarians does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: Two. One to write a solemn statement which will affirm that: This light bulb is natural, a part of the universe, and evolved over many years by small steps. And we seek for each light bulb the fullest opportunity to develop itself to its full electrical potential. The second Unitarian’s job is to read this statement and then write the obligatory criticism and dissent.\n\nQ: How many missions magazine editors does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: Just one — they’re trained to bring light to a dark world.\n\nQ: How many atheists does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: None – there’s no point, since atheists refuse to see the light.\n\nQ: How many Quakers does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: Ten to sit around in a circle until one feels an inner light.\n\nQ: How many Lutherans does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: Thirteen – one to change the bulb and 12 to sit around talking about how much they miss the old bulb.\n\nQ: How many creationists does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: None – they just wait for God to say “Let there be light.”\n\nQ: How many Calvinists does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: If God has predestined the light bulb to shine, it will change itself.\n\nQ: How many Brethren does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: Change? What is this change you speak of?\n\nQ: How many campfire worship leaders does it take to change a light bulb?\n\nA: Just one, but soon all those around can warm up in its glowing.\n\n*****\n\nThe greatest surprise of Mary’s life was receiving a dollar on her fourth birthday. She carried the bill about the house and was seen sitting on the stairs admiring it.\n\n“What are you going to do with your dollar?” her mother asked.\n\n“Take it to Sunday School,” said Mary promptly.\n\n“To show your teacher?” Mary shook her head.\n\n“No,” she said. “I’m going to give it to God. He’ll be as surprised as I am to get something besides pennies.”\n\n*****\n\n“What did you learn in Sunday school?” the grandfather asked the little boy after church.\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Nothing?” replied the grandfather. “Didn’t you study Jesus?”\n\nThe boy scowled. “No, he wasn’t even there.”\n\n*****\n\nDuring a Lutheran worship service a man began to be moved by the Spirit.\n\nOut loud he said “Amen!” People around him were a little disturbed.\n\nThen louder he said, “Hallelujah!” A few more people were becoming disturbed.\n\nLouder still he shouted “Praise Jesus!”\n\nAn usher moved quickly down the aisle. He bent over and whispered to the man, “Sir! Control yourself!”\n\nThe man exclaimed, “I can’t help it. I got religion!!!”\n\nTo which the usher responded, “Well you didn’t get it here!”\n\n*****\n\nDefinitions:\n\nBulletin: 1)Something to read during the sermon; 2)a fan used in churches without air conditioning; 3)your receipt for attending church.\n\nChoir: A group of people who sing loudly enough to enable the rest of us to lip-sync all hymns.\n\nRecessional hymn: The final hymn, and usually the quietest of all hymns because so many parishioners have already left before it is sung.\n\nUshers: The only guys in the church who still do not know the actual seating capacity of a pew.\n\nRelics: Older members who still remember when to sit, stand, and kneel during worship. *****\n\nA Nun was taking a shower one day and she heard the door bell ring, she yelled “Who is it?”\n\nAnd the person ringing the door bell yelled, “I’m the blind man.”\n\nSo the Nun got out of the shower and wrapped her hair in a towel, she didn’t bother putting a towel around herself.\n\nShe opened the door and said, “What do you want?”, and the man said, “I’m here to check your blinds.”\n\n*****\n\nA man who died is refused entry into heaven. “There’s no record of you having done a good deed,” St. Peter explained. “Have you?”\n\nThe man thinks and replies, “Well, there was this one time when I was driving down the highway and saw a group of thugs assaulting this poor girl. I stopped, grabbed my tire iron, walked up to the leader of the gang and yelled ‘Leave her alone, you sick, deranged animals!’ ”\n\nImpressed, St. Peter asks, “When did this happen?’\n\n“About two minutes ago.”\n\n*****\n\nAs the substitute preacher was greeting the congregation he made the statement, “You know, a substitute preacher is like a piece of cardboard in a broken window. He fills the space, but after all, he’s not the real glass.” He then proceeded with his sermon. After the service, a lady approached him trying to pay him a compliment by saying, “You weren’t a replacement after all. You were a real pane.\n\n*****\n\nA middle-aged woman has a heart attack and is taken to the hospital. While on the operating table she has a near death experience. During that experience she sees God and asks if this is it. God says no and explains that she has another 30 years to live.\n\nUpon her recovery she decides to just stay in the hospital and have a face lift, liposuction, breast augmentation, tummy tuck, etc. She even has someone come in and change her hair color. She figures since she’s got another 30 years she might as well make the most of it.\n\nShe walks out of the hospital after the last operation and is killed by an ambulance speeding by. She arrives in front of God and complains, “I thought you said I had another 30 years.”\n\nGod replies,” I didn’t recognize you.”\n\n*****\n\nAll four churches in the small town had a serious problem with squirrel infestation.\n\nThe Presbyterians decided that it was predestined that squirrels be in the church and that they would just have to live with them.\n\nThe Methodists decided they should deal with the squirrels lovingly in the style of Charles Wesley. They humanely trapped them and released them in a park at the edge of town. Within 3 days, they were all back in the church.\n\nThe Catholics also humanely trapped them and attempted to teach them the “rhythm” method which of course did not work.\n\nThe Lutherans had the best solution. They confirmed the squirrels, and now they see the animals only at Christmas and Easter.\n\n*****\n\nA pious man who had reached the age of 105 suddenly stopped going to church. Alarmed by the old fellow’s absence after so many years of faithful attendance the pastor went to see him. He found him in excellent health, so the pastor asked, “How come after all these years we don’t see you at services anymore?”\n\nThe old man looked around and lowered his voice. I’ll tell you, Pastor,” he whispered. “When I got to be 90 I expected God to take me any day. But then I got to be 95, then 100, then 105. So I figured that God is very busy and must have forgotten about me ….. and I don’t want to remind Him.”\n\n*****\n\nThe Preacher’s Lament\n\n“If I express myself on a subject, I’m trying to run things.\n\nIf I’m silent, I’m dumb or have lost interest.\n\nIf I’m often at my office (preparing messages), why don’t I get out and learn what’s going on.\n\nIf I’m out when they call, why am I not tending to business, or studying for a message.\n\nIf I’m not at home at night, I’m out having a good time.\n\nIf I’m home, I’m neglecting important outside contacts and activities.\n\nIf I don’t agree with persons, I’m bullheaded.\n\nIf I do agree, I don’t have any ideas of my own.\n\nIf I don’t do what I’m requested, I’m a very poor pastor or minister.\n\nIf I do agree, well, that’s what I’m paid for.\n\nIf I give someone a short answer, I’m “too big for my britches.”\n\nIf I attempt to explain the pros and cons of an issue, I’m a know-it-all.\n\nIf I’m well dressed, I think I’m a big sho"
