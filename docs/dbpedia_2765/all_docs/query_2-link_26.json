        "text": "Adapted by Amy Friedman and illustrated by Jillian Gilliland\n\nFOR 15 years the great magician and enchanter known as Merlin watched over a boy named Arthur. Arthur was special. In truth, he was the son of King Uther and his queen, the fair Igraine. Only Merlin knew this secret, for he had sent the boy to be raised by the good Sir Ector.\n\nOne day Sir Ector took his son Kay to joust in his first tournament. Arthur rode along to serve as Kay's squire. In the excitement of the day, Arthur forgot to bring Kay's sword, and when he realized his error, he rode off in haste to find another sword.\n\nAs he passed the church courtyard, he noticed a sword strangely embedded in a large stone. Rather than ride all the way home, Arthur stopped, and with no effort at all drew the sword from the stone.\n\nArthur did not know that the sword had been placed there years before by a wise man. And he did not know the prediction: The sword would remain stuck in the stone until it was claimed by a true king.\n\nWhen the astonished knights saw this boy carrying the sword that so many had tried and failed to move, they could not believe their eyes. Many demanded to know what trickery he had used. Then Merlin appeared and drew back Arthur's sleeve. There on his arm was the mark of the dragon, proof that Arthur was the son of the last king, Uther Pendragon.\n\nMany proud knights, angered by this strange happening, declared war against Arthur. Among his enemies was the warrior King Pellinore. One day, in his fury, King Pellinore lashed out and killed a young man who swore allegiance to young King Arthur.\n\nFurious, Arthur mounted his horse. \"I will avenge my friend's death,\" he cried as he rode toward Pellinore. But Arthur was inexperienced at fighting. As they fought, the crowd gathered and stared in hushed anticipation. They gasped when Arthur fell, badly wounded. He lay upon the ground, his sword broken. King Pellinore moved swiftly forward.\n\nBut Merlin was watching, as he always did. At the moment it seemed Arthur would die, Merlin cast Pellinore into a deep sleep, and Pellinore sank to the ground. The others stared in disbelief and fell back, awed by this spectacle.\n\nMerlin went to Arthur's side, and when he saw the deep wounds, his eyes filled with tears. \"I do not have the power to heal you, Arthur,\" he said softly. \"We must go to find help. \" He helped the young king to his horse, and then mounted his own. They rode slowly into the forest together.\n\nAfter a while they came to a tiny stone hut. There a hermit stood, bent over a fire, stirring a boiling pot of magical herbs.\n\n\"Merlin,\" said the hermit as the two men entered the hut, \"I knew you would be coming soon. The birds told me an old enchanter and a wounded knight would soon come to me. So, who is this boy? \" Before he spoke, Merlin helped Arthur to lie on a pallet of straw. Then he turned to the hermit. \"This is Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon. His life is meant to be filled with glory, but if you do not heal him, all will be lost. I must ask you to cure the youth so that we may continue our journey. \" The hermit scratched his long, white beard as he listened carefully to Merlin's words. \"Worry not,\" he said at long last, and set to work.\n\nTwo days and nights passed. Arthur tossed and turned, in terrible pain. And then on the third day he awoke refreshed and healed. At once Merlin led him to their horses. \"We must go now,\" he said to Arthur. \"We have a long journey before us. \" Arthur trusted Merlin. Though he shivered in the cold morning air, he said nothing. He pulled his cloak tightly around him, and the men rode deeper into the forest.\n\nThey rode through tall trees and undergrowth so thick it seemed as if the horses galloped on air. They crossed rocky streams and slippery banks, and Arthur cocked his head, for on the cool breeze he thought he heard voices. \"Arthur is coming,\" the wind whispered.\n\n\"Arthur is coming. \" The branches of the trees seemed to be arms, beckoning him, and the sky was filled with a bright light, as if a beacon were lighting their path. With each mile they traveled, Arthur felt his strength increase.\n\nAt last they emerged from the forest and came to the shores of the bluest lake Arthur had ever seen. At the far side of the lake misty islands rose out of the water, and in the distance gentle hills rose to the sky.\n\n\"What is this place? \" Arthur asked, his voice filled with wonder. \"I feel at peace here. \" \"Avalon,\" Merlin answered. \"And remember this place, Arthur, for you will never see it in this same way again. Here the Lady of the Lake reigns. \" Merlin led them to the edge of the water. When they dismounted, Arthur knelt down and cupped his hands to drink. The water made his fingers tingle with cold and something more; when he tasted it, he knew that this was, indeed, the purest water imaginable. Then, suddenly, Arthur felt blazing heat and he looked over the water.\n\nIn the center of the lake, a slender, pale arm dressed in glistening white satin came out of the water, holding in its hand a mighty sword, its blade shining brighter than the sun. \"This is your sword, Arthur,\" said Merlin. \"On the day you were born, swordsmiths in Avalon began to forge this for the time when you would come to claim it. It is made of gold and decorated with jewels, and on its hilt is engraved its name: Excalibur. The Lady of the Lake has held it in trust for you. Now you must ask her for it. \" As Merlin spoke, a beautiful woman rose out of the water.\n\nDressed in silk as blue as the lake itself, she glided across the water as if she were a swan. \"The sword is yours, Arthur,\" she said. \"Go and claim it, but in return you must grant me whatever gift I ask, whenever I ask. \" Arthur promised without thinking, and the Lady led him to a small boat moored among the reeds. At once she vanished.\n\nArthur and Merlin climbed into the boat. Without a sound, without any effort, the boat sped to the middle of the lake, and Arthur leaned out and took hold of Excalibur. The arm disappeared beneath the water's surface.\n\n\"Remember this, Arthur,\" Merlin said. \"In that plain beyond this lake and these hills, you will fight your final battle. And when you do, before you draw your last breath, you must return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. \" Arthur, still stunned by this moment, suddenly heard the Lady's voice again. \"Use your sword well, King Arthur, and remember, as long as you wear the sheath I now give to you, you will never lose blood through battle wounds. \" As she spoke these words, a jeweled scabbard, attached to a belt of silk embroidered with dragons, was fastened around Arthur's waist.\n\nIt would be many years before he would return to the vale of Avalon, the place, where, forever, his wounds would be healed. But Arthur always remembered the Lady of the Lake and his promise to her.\n\nUniversal Press Syndicate BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 603696"
