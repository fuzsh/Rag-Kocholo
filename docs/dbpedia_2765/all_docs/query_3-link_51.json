I first encountered its fascinations as an undergrad in a Humanities seminar: a unit devoted to arguments for the existence of God both disoriented and intrigued me when I found myself simultaneously convinced by both Anselms’ and Aquinas’ rather incommensurate God proofs. How could this be? A commitment to the academic study of religion as my life’s work assumed more specific shape as a result of a semester study abroad, living and learning in the Old City of Jerusalem.\n\nCurrently, the specific kinds of questions that most animate me include: How do the various religions of the world treat women? What resources does the Bible provide for the dilemmas of global climate change and socio- economic injustices? What meaning and purpose might be wrested from biblical narratives that convey violence-especially violence against women? I enjoy exploring these questions both in and out of the classroom, with students and in my writing, at Susquehanna and in the religious community to which I belong.\n\nFor respite and recharging, Susquehanna’s location in central Pennsylvania makes it easy to get off into the woods to ski, hike, meditate, and just “be.” As well, time with family and friends, and travel-both nationally and internationally-are important to me.
