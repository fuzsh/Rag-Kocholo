        "text": "With a growing student body and new construction projects taking place on campus, parking and getting around campus has become increasingly more difficult. Mines recognizes the need for improvements to make life a little easier for the campus community. To that end, the Parking Services Office is excited to announce some new upcoming enhancements to campus parking and transit options, which are sure to improve your experience!\n\nBeginning this month, Mines is rolling out the first of several key strategies that you can expect to see over the course of the next year.\n\nRTD ECO-PASS FOR ALL!\n\nStudents have long benefitted from access to RTD’s EcoPass, which allows for unlimited rides on RTD buses and trains—24 hours a day/7 days a week/365 days a year. Now, that option is being extended to all faculty and staff as well.\n\nAvailable immediately, all staff and faculty (both full and part-time) will be able to obtain the RTD EcoPass, free-of-charge, from the Parking Services Office. With this benefit, you will have 24/7/365 access to RTD’s network of buses and trains, allowing you to leave the car at home and commute to campus for free! To obtain your pass, visit the Parking Services office in McNeil Hall (Room 127) or email a headshot to parking@mines.edu and request to pick up the pass when it is ready!\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF PARKING GARAGE #2 HAS BEGUN!\n\nWork has started on the construction of a second parking garage on the Mines campus. The garage will be located at Arapahoe Street, between 17th and 18th Streets, on the site of the current Lot I. The new parking structure will hold approximately 870 vehicles and will be outfitted with charging stations and an indicator system to easily identify available spaces. The new parking garage is expected to open by Fall 2024.\n\nNEW TEMPORARY PARKING ALTERNATIVES\n\nWith the closure of Lot I for construction of a new parking garage and other ongoing building projects, the Parking Services Office is arranging for new temporary parking lots to accommodate additional parking capacity until the new parking garage is open. Temporary lots are being explored for the following locations:\n\nMaple Street Tennis Courts\n\n19th Street and Illinois\n\nMines Park\n\nUnited Methodist Church (off campus)\n\nSPLASH Aquatic Center (off campus)\n\nThese lots are not immediately available but as they come online, specific announcements will be made about the opening of these lots and the regulations associated with each.\n\nCOMING SOON: NEW CAMPUS SHUTTLE PROGRAM\n\nColorado School of Mines has partnered with Undergrad & Grad Student Government and the City of Golden to launch a new campus shuttle program. The program will provide free shuttle service in and around campus and to popular areas near campus, including Mines Park, Jackson Street/Safeway, Downtown Golden, the RTD “W” Line Station, and South Golden Road. This service will operate on 10-minute intervals and will be a free, hop-on/hop-off service (no pass required). Accessible service will also be provided. This service is expected to begin with limited service July 5, 2023 with a complete launch prior to the Fall 2023 semester. Stay tuned for further details and announcements on this exciting program!\n\nIf you have additional questions regarding parking on campus, please visit Parking Services, McNeil Hall (Room 127) or email Parking@mines.edu."
