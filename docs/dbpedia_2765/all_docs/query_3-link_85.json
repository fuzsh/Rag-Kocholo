        "text": "Early Years\n\nTecumseh, whose name in Shawnee means “shooting star” or “blazing comet,” was born in 1768 in the western Ohio Valley to the Shawnee chief Puckeshinwa and his wife Methoataske. According to legend, he was given his name because at his birth a meteor or comet was seen in the sky.\n\nAfter Puckeshinwa was killed at the Battle of Point Pleasant (Lord Dunmore’s War), Methoataske migrated to Missouri with other tribe members, leaving Tecumseh and his siblings behind to be raised by their older sister Tecumapease.\n\nTecumapease taught Tecumseh the tenets of Shawnee culture; his older brother Cheeseekau taught him how to be a warrior. By his teenage years, Tecumseh had come to despise Americans after witnessing the atrocities they committed against the Shawnee people and their land; however, the brutal tactics some Indians used to fight the white man also horrified him.\n\nIn the late 1780s, Tecumseh participated in a series of raids on settlers, then accompanied his brother Cheeseekau and a small band of Shawnee warriors to Tennessee to join a group of Cherokee Chickamauga. After Cheeseekau was killed, Tecumseh became leader of the Shawnee band and returned to Ohio to help Chief Bluejacket battle the U.S. Army.\n\nTreaty of Greenville\n\nUnder Bluejacket’s direction in 1791, Tecumseh led a scouting party to help defeat General Arthur St. Clair’s army at the bloody Battle of Wabash. He then fought at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on the Maumee River, where General Anthony Wayne and his army decisively defeated the Indians, and both sides signed the Treaty of Greenville which forced the Indians to forfeit much of their land in the Northwest Territory.\n\nTecumseh refused to sign the treaty, however, because he felt the Indians didn’t own the land they’d given up. He believed the land was shared by all Indians and could not be negotiated away. Nonetheless, Native Americans abided by the Treaty of Greenville, although white settlers and their leaders did not.\n\nProphetstown\n\nBy the early 1800s, Tecumseh had settled in Ohio and was a respected leader, war chief and orator. In 1805, his younger brother Lalawethika experienced an alcohol-induced vision and declared his intent to lead Indians on a quest to reclaim their lands and culture. He changed his name to Tenskwatawa and became known as “the Prophet.”\n\nAfter correctly predicting a solar eclipse in 1806, the Prophet gained hordes of Indian followers from various tribes. In 1808, Tecumseh and the Prophet moved their growing multi-tribal alliance to Prophetstown, near the Wabash and Tippecanoe rivers in present-day Indiana.\n\nBattle of Tippecanoe\n\nTecumseh traveled far to recruit disgruntled Indians to his pan-Indian alliance. In powerful speeches, he rallied them to his cause by warning that the only way to overcome their invaders was to unite and resist the American way of life.\n\nIt was while he was away on one of these recruiting trips in 1811 that Indiana Territory’s Governor (and future U.S. president) William Henry Harrison marched his forces toward Prophetstown with the intent of destroying the village.\n\nTecumseh had warned his brother not to fight until their confederacy was stronger, but the Prophet ignored his advice and attacked Harrison’s army despite a tenuous ceasefire having been reached. After two hours of intense fighting at the Battle of Tippecanoe, Harrison defeated the Indians who then abandoned Prophetstown, leaving it open for Harrison to ransack and burn.\n\nA few months later, Tecumseh returned to Prophetstown and found both the village and his hard-won Indian coalition destroyed.\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nTecumseh rallied his remaining followers during the War of 1812 and joined British forces in Michigan, playing a key role in defeating American forces at the Siege of Detroit.\n\nAfter Detroit’s fall, Tecumseh joined British Major-General Henry Proctor’s invasion of Ohio and fought against Harrison and his army. After Harrison invaded Canada, the British were forced to flee, and Tecumseh and his men grudgingly followed suit. Harrison pursued them to the Thames River where Tecumseh was killed on October 5, 1813.\n\nTecumseh was an esteemed leader, a powerful chief and a gifted orator. His death dismantled his pan-Indian alliance in the Northwest Territory. Without Tecumseh to lead them, most remaining Native Americans in the region moved to Indian reservations and ceded their land.\n\nThough Tecumseh never lost sight of his goal to unite Indian tribes, his influence was not enough to defeat America's military and save the Indian way of life.\n\nGeneral Isaac Brock, Commander of the British Forces at Amherstburg, may have summed up Tecumseh’s life best when he said of him, “A more sagacious or a gallant warrior does not, I believe, exist.”\n\nSources"
