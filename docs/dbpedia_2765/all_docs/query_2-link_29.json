        "text": "The Road Commission continuously evaluates road conditions to identify replacement, repair, and maintenance items. Project lists are developed with priorities based on the evaluation of data such as:\n\nPASER Road Ratings\n\nTraffic Volumes\n\nCapacity and Congestion Issues\n\nAccident History\n\nMaintenance Problems\n\nFunding Sources\n\nEach year the Road Commission gathers input from local governmental officials, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO), and the general public to determine improvement needs and develop a 5-year Strategic Improvement Plan.\n\nImprovement needs not included in the Strategic Improvement Plan are typically addressed through the recurring, day-to-day maintenance activities by the Road Commission.\n\nSince 100% of the costs associated with resurfacing or other surface treatments applied to Subdivision Streets have been paid by the Townships and/or residents, the Townshipâ€™s determine which Subdivision Streets are selected.\n\nWhen a construction project impacts the normal use of a county road, warning devices such as barrels, signs, and arrow boards are placed in accordance with a traffic control plan.\n\nThe basic objective of a traffic control plan is to permit construction work within the county road right of way in an efficient and effective manner, while maintaining a safe, uniform flow of traffic.\n\nThe construction work and motorists, bicycles, and pedestrians traveling through the work zone must be given equal consideration when developing a traffic control plan. Each traffic control plan is developed to be consistent with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).\n\nThe Road Commission relies on the cooperation of various news media in publicizing the implementation of major road closures and detours as a method of keeping the public well informed."
