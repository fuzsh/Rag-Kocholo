        "text": "Q: Dear Professor,\n\nWould you say something in your column this week about King Arthur?\n\nA: This week’s question comes from a local student whom one imagines is more intrigued by the Arthurian legend than the actual character who may have lived in the brief period between Roman and Saxon rule in fifth-century Britain.\n\nBut it’s a fun subject nonetheless, with a few religious implications.\n\nAt the outset the obvious must be stated that almost the whole of the Arthurian legend is exactly that, a legend, and has almost no historical reality to it.\n\nAside from a handful of Welsh legends and a few references in not very contemporary documents, most of the Arthur legend comes from the period after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.\n\nWhat appears in modern films about King Arthur is normally so preposterous that it is neither early British, nor medieval.\n\nOne celebrated film I endured showed Arthur and his knights of the round table swimming in a castle moat. Aside from the doubtful abilities of a man to actually swim in metal battle armor, the fact that moats were often used as cesspools for human waste and refuse makes it all the more colorful an image.\n\nYet another film showed Arthur and the knights actually sitting down to dine at the famous round table in their battle armor again. One hopes they wiped off the blood of their enemies first.\n\nA little historical background is in order. The territory now known as England, but then occupied by the Celtic peoples, was conquered by Claudius Caesar in the first century A.D.\n\nThe last effective Roman emperor in the West, Honorius, withdrew the legions from Britain about A.D. 395. The Saxon conquest was largely accomplished by the sixth century A.D.\n\nIf there was an Arthur, he would have lived between these two regimes, Roman and Saxon. Archeological evidence make it clear that Christianity was present in Britain in the Roman period, and one very elegant mosaic found at Hinton St. Mary’s, and now in the British Museum, depicts Christ as a clean-shaven Roman in a toga.\n\nBut Christianity was to a large degree extinguished by the Saxon conquests, although significant elements remained, particular in Irish, Welsh and other Celtic monasteries and communities.\n\nThe Saxon conversion to Christianity began around 597 with the arrival of St. Augustine of Canterbury at the command of Pope Gregory I. If there was ever an Arthur, it is very far from clear that he was ever a Christian king, however he was later depicted.\n\nBefore debunking King Arthur, let us consider what evidence we have for the celebrated British king. A ninth-century document called the Historia Brittonum refers to Arthur fighting the Saxon invasions in the post-Roman period of Britain.\n\nCiting an older source, named Nennius, the Historia Brittonum said this Arthur fought 12 great battles, the last of which was at Mount Baden.\n\nAnother document from the 10th century, called the Welsh Annals, makes a similar reference.\n\nIn 1998, a stone was uncovered in Cornwall, a traditional site for the Arthurian legend, which bore the inscription, “Artognou,” suggesting a link to Arthur. It seems more likely that it is tied to a word meaning “bear knowing” in old Breton.\n\nOther more critical historians have observed that Arthur does not appear at all in the more credible Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, nor does the sixth-century text “On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain,” which laments the Saxon invasions.\n\nOne historian argued that no other mythological figure has wasted so much time of historians. Another dryly observed, “King Arthur should be deposed.”\n\nThe legends we know of as belonging to King Arthur come to a large degree from the 12th-century historian Geoffrey of Monmouth, who completed his epic “History of the Kings of Britain” in 1138.\n\nThis work described the history of Britain from its founding by an escapee from the Trojan War right into historical times. It is in Geoffrey’s work that we find the first references to Sir Kay, Sir Bedevere, Guinevere, Arthur’s father Uther Pendragon and the wonderful sword Excalibur, although his spellings are very different from these familiar ones.\n\nHere is the origin of the Round Table and the stories of so many of Arthur’s knights, their battles and adventures.\n\nGeoffrey’s work was immensely popular and copies of it circulated all over western Europe and it was translated into a number of languages.\n\nIt was also an inspiration for the French romantic poets, such as Marie of France and Chr tien de Troyes, who added the stories of the Quest for the Holy Grail, Sir Perceval, the Fisher King, the character of Lancelot and his doomed affair with the queen.\n\nOne contemporary of Geoffrey claimed that he was given to “inordinate lying” and it must be admitted that aside from some contemporary Welsh sources, he has absolutely no credible historical sources.\n\nOne popular medieval legend summarized the value of Geoffrey’s work in this story:\n\nOnce upon a time a poor monk was troubled by demons, who tormented him by night. To drive off the devils, the other monks placed a copy of St. John’s Gospel on the monk’s chest, and the demons fled in terror before the Word of God.\n\nBut one night the monks could not find their gospel and so they substituted Geoffrey’s work on the victim’s chest as a rue to fool the demons.\n\nOn seeing this book, the demons charged forward at the monk in evil delight to find such a pack of lies as a welcome.\n\nThat said, it was the monks who kept copying Geoffrey, so they must have loved his stories as well.\n\nDoubtless the best comment on the legends of King Arthur comes from the British statesman Sir Winston Churchill, and I can offer no better analysis to my young questioner who prompted this article.\n\nWhen asked if he believed in any of the historical value of the Arthurian legend Churchill replies as follows.\n\n“It is true. All of it and every word of it is true. And if it’s, not, it should be.”"
