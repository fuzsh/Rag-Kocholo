        "text": "Theano \"Teddy\" Essa Pelkey Saginaw, Michigan\n\nPassed away on August 3, 2024, in Saginaw. She was born on November 4, 1924, in Traverse City to the late Frank and Beatrice Anjakos.\n\nShe proudly graduated from Arthur Hill High School with the class of 1942. Following graduation, she attended university, becoming a much loved and successful teacher and educator.\n\nTeddy was a remarkable soul who touched the lives of many with her kind and caring nature. Known for her involvement in the community and church, she always strived to learn new things and spread joy wherever she went. Teddy was a lifelong and faithful member of Michigan Avenue Baptist Church. She civically served her community as the former president of the Saginaw Culture Club, was a member of Saginaw County Association of Retired School Personnel (SCARSP), and the Beta Sigma Phi sorority. Her elegance and grace were apparent to all who had the pleasure of knowing her. Beyond her social persona, Teddy had a passion for culinary adventures and exploring new restaurants. A true foodie at heart, she found joy in sharing meals with loved ones. Teddy enjoyed traveling the world but especially to McCollum Lake with her family, practicing watercolor artistry, sewing beautiful creations as a talented seamstress, indulging in a round of golf, and playing bridge with her friends. Her affinity for gardening produced stunning blooms that brightened many days, while her love for literature led her on countless adventures within the pages of books. Teddy's legacy lives on through shared memories and enduring love.\n\nLeft to cherish Teddy's memory are two daughters: Aileen (James) Kushon and Cheryl (William) Zinz; five grandchildren: Carrie (Corby) Horlings, Sarah (Jefferson) Wiggins, Erin (Thomas) Reou, Megan McGregor, Jeffrey Zinz; seven great-grandchildren: Benjamin, ZoÃ« Jayne, Sophia, Sydney, Jillian, Thane, Jack; brother: Frank (Jacqueline) Anjakos; and many dear and special friends.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her beloved husband, Robert Pelkey; her parents; daughter: Renee McGregor; granddaughter: Kelly McGregor; and two sisters: Lila Lovay and Pauline Goetz.\n\nPer Teddy's wishes, cremation has taken place. A memorial service will take place at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, September 7, 2024, at Michigan Avenue Baptist Church, 203 S. Michigan Ave., Saginaw, Michigan, 48602. Rev. Carol McCleary will officiate. Friends are welcome to visit with the family from 10:00 a.m. until the time of service. In lieu of flowers, those wishing to show an expression of sympathy may consider a memorial contribution to Michigan Avenue Baptist Church or a charity of your choice. Please share your thoughts and memories with the family at the church or through our website at www.casefuneralhome.com."
