        "text": "One© Jerry Holsopple & Kristin Kennedy, photographers, by permission.\n\nWhat Matters to You\n\nWhat are all the ways we use\n\nand experience water, bread, and wine?\n\nHow might those experiences also describe\n\nan experience of God?\n\nWhat are the sounds or voices of God?\n\nWhat is your experience of God\n\nand those in your congregation\n\nwhile participating in Baptism and Holy Communion?\n\nWhat Matters to Us\n\nJust some water, just a simple meal of bread and juice, but for us in the United Church Christ, what is simple means much more. We celebrate two sacraments. One is Baptism. The other is Holy Communion which is also often called the Lord’s Supper or Eucharist. Sacraments are our ritual acts in worship life when the Holy Spirit uses water, bread, and wine to make visible the grace, forgiveness, and presence of God in Christ.\n\nThe preamble of our constitution simply states the UCC “recognizes” these two sacraments. Recognition, however, is more than a mere casual acknowledgment. Recognition is a deep way of seeing and experiencing God and God’s action in these rites. Recognition recalls Jesus Christ and his own baptism (Mark 1:9-11), his call to baptize others (Matthew 28:16-20), and the invitation to become one with Christ and one another in baptism (Romans 6:1-4). Recognition remembers Jesus’ meals with his followers and the Last Supper (Luke 22:7-13), discovers his continuing presence in the breaking of bread (Luke 24:30-31a), and anticipates a great banquet for all God’s people (Luke 14:15-24). Recognition is not only an individual act, but one we share with other Christians throughout the world.\n\nWhat happens at Baptism and Holy Communion. What do they mean? Our Book of Worship and the words we use to celebrate the sacraments reflect a variety of meanings. These understandings we share in common with many other Christians, and are also reflected in the World Council of Churches’ ecumenical agreement calledBaptism, Eucharist and Ministry .\n\nThrough water at baptism, God embraces you — no matter who you are — and brings you into Christ’s Church. You become vital not only to a local church, but the wider Church. You share in the life, death, and resurrection of Christ. The church also promises to love, support, and care for you throughout your whole life. Baptized, you now participate fully in life of the Church and God’s realm.\n\nAt Holy Communion, we share a simple meal of bread and wine. Here, we experience the presence of Christ again. Together, around God’s welcome table, we recall God’s loving acts especially in Jesus, we experience our oneness in Christ, hope for a time when all will be fed, and anticipate the fullness of God’s love and justice throughout creation.\n\nPractices of the sacraments vary among our congregations. A 2004-2006 UCC worship survey details our range of practices. Some congregations baptize infants through adults, while others seem to begin baptism with older children. All use water, but the amount varies from a small amount to full immersion in a body of water. Most often, a pastor baptizes “in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,” others use additional expressions of the Triune God. Baptism occurs within a worshiping congregation and, as the entry rite into Christ’s Church, occurs only once.\n\nThe frequency of Holy Communion ranges from seldom to weekly, but is most often celebrated monthly. Some use a common loaf of bread and a cup; others use wafers and small communion cups. Some receive communion in the pews, others join together at the front of the worship space. Some congregations reserve Communion for those who are both baptized and confirmed, while others invite all regardless of baptism or confirmation. Increasingly children are welcome to the Table at their parent’s discretion.\n\nAll our emphases seem to come together in the sacraments. Christ claims us, and we belong to Christ. God offers an extravagant welcome, and we share in it. God keeps covenant with us, and we unite as one with Christians throughout the world. God offers a vision of justice and love, and we are inspired to live it. Together, through water, bread, and wine, we know the still-speaking God.\n\nFrom your own experience of baptism and Holy Communion, what do they mean to you? How might the meanings have changed over time?\n\nWhen have you participated in a baptism or Holy Communion that was particularly meaningful? Pray a prayer such as “O God, what are you saying and revealing to us about our own congregation’s practice of the sacraments?”\n\nPeople Matter\n\nWhat are ways that you see James Fouther expressing the sacraments in his own life?\n\nIf you have been baptized, what do you know about the event? What has it come to mean to you?\n\nWhat is your prayer for James? After hearing his story, what might God be saying to you?\n\nNow a grown man with children of his own, James Fouther celebrates the early days of his life. “What do I know about my baptism? I was baptized as an infant at the Congregational Church of Park Manor UCC in Chicago. My mom just recently sent me my Certificate of Baptism and a baptism day letter from Reverend Dr. Arthur Gray who baptized me.” Fouther talks about how he didn’t think much about his baptism until he was a young adult. He was dating a woman who said if they were going to truly get serious he would have to be re-baptized in her church. “Whoa! That relationship ended in a crash!” Fouther declares, “I realized all of a sudden that my own baptism and church family was as important to me in my twenties as when I was a baby and youth.” Now as a pastor in Denver at the United Church of Montbello ,that church of his baptism back in Chicago, thousands of miles away, is still incredibly important to him. Grace poured out, the sacraments have stuck, and they are central to his ministry.\n\nReverend Dr. Fouther pastors a church that is an ecumenical or federated congregation. The church was founded by the Presbyterian Church U.S.A., the United Methodist Church, as well as the UCC. At both the water of baptism and gathered at the communion rail, they celebrate their oneness in Christ. “At communion each first Sunday of the month, when that ‘private’ moment comes when members receive the bread and the juice, we are squeezed right next to somebody else who is receiving communion. Older members are squeezed right next to children and youth. Folks not only nod at each other at the rail, but when tears begin to fall from someone’s face there is a person, usually on each side, to embrace them and help with a tissue or two.”\n\nFouther points out that some things have changed since his childhood. As a youth, he had to wait until after confirmation to receive communion. Reflecting on the wisdom and gifts of his own children, he declares, “All who claim Jesus Christ as Savior, all our children come to the table. My prayer is that our children experience the same oneness in Jesus Christ that our adults know and experience.”\n\nFouther speaks of bridging a postmodern world and the timeless message of the gospel of Jesus Christ. At the table and gathered together at baptism, he invites those who are children, youth, and adults, those who are unchurched and those who come from a variety of traditions, to lavish in the grace and goodness of Christ who makes us one.\n\nBible Matters\n\nCommunity in Communion: 1 Corinthians 11:17-33\n\nBegin with a time of silence. Ask God to guide your understanding of scripture. Slowly read 1 Corinthians 11:17-33 aloud. Ask yourself:\n\nWhat disturbs me about this passage?\n\nWhat seems to be at stake here?\n\nIf I were to paint a picture of Holy Communion among the folk at Corinth,\n\nwhat do I guess it would look like?\n\nConsider the historical setting of Paul’s writing to the church at Corinth. He was concerned with the factions within the church. The church was more divided than united as they participated in Holy Communion. The sacramental meal was part of a common meal where some gorged on food and drink, and others went hungry. Rather than a time that expressed oneness in Christ, it highlighted a division between those who had much and those who had little. Social differences were accentuated.\n\nPaul connects Holy Communion with the ethical implications of the sacrament by pointing back to Jesus’ sharing at the Last Supper. He provides the “words of institution” (“that the Lord Jesus on the night he was betrayed took the loaf of bread…” found in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26) not so much as a word-for-word script for future celebrations, but rather to point out the origin of the meal as a sharing in Christ’s offering-of-love presence. Communion expressed Christ’s life, death, and resurrection in behalf of others. True participation in Christ’s meal transformed unjust social relationships as well as personal “hungers.” Paul called on the Corinthians to partake in the meal in a worthy manner. He insisted, “Examine yourselves, and only then eat of the bread and drink of the cup” (verse 28).\n\nEnter silence again. Be aware of any thoughts or insights that occur at prayer. Then prayerfully reflect on questions as these:\n\nHow is our congregation different from or similar to the Corinthians?\n\nWhat difference does vividly remembering Jesus at his Last Supper make to participation in Holy Communion today?\n\nHow do I prepare to participate in Holy Communion? What might it mean for me, for our congregation, to examine ourselves?\n\nWhat are the differences that participation in Christ’s presence at Holy Communion make to both individuals and a gathered community?\n\nOne more time, rest in silent prayer.\n\nPrayer Matters\n\nPreparing Hearts for Baptism\n\nThe prayer over the water of baptism found in Book of Worship is a beautiful retelling of God’s blessing through water in all of history. When someone is baptized, they participate again in God’s story of salvation, liberation, and new birth. As you anticipate your own baptism or that of another, imaginatively rehearse the baptismal story. This exercise is not an imitation of baptism, but rather intended to prayerfully bring the story to life when you actually participate in baptism.\n\nBreathe deeply, aware of God’s presence, and pour water in a small basin. Pray the words slowly, pausing often during the verses of the prayer. Imagine the stories of salvation rising from the water. At the end of the words, finally dip your hands in the water and then fold them in prayer. Continue to pray in silence, open to God, sensitive to any understandings, feelings, or convictions that may emerge.\n\nThanksgiving and Blessing over the Water\n\nWe thank you, God, for the gift of creation called forth by your saving Word.\n\nBefore the world had shape and form, your Spirit moved over the waters.\n\nOut of the waters of the deep, you formed the firmament and brought forth earth to sustain life.\n\nIn the time of Noah,\n\nyou washed the earth with the waters of the flood,\n\nand your ark of salvation bore a new beginning.\n\nIn the time of Moses [, Aaron, and Miriam],\n\nour people Israel passed through the Red Sea waters\n\nfrom slavery to freedom and crossed the flowing Jordan\n\nto enter the promised land.\n\nIn the fullness of time, you sent Jesus Christ,\n\nwho was nurtured in the water of Mary’s womb.\n\nJesus was baptized by John in the water of the Jordan,\n\nbecame living water to a woman at the Samaritan well,\n\nwashed the feet of the disciples,\n\nand sent them forth to baptize all nations by water and the Holy Spirit.\n\nBless by your Holy Spirit, gracious God, this water.\n\nBy your Holy Spirit save those who confess the name of Jesus Christ\n\nthat sin may have no power over them.\n\nCreate new life in baptized this day\n\nthat may rise in Christ.\n\nGlory to you, eternal God,\n\nthe one who was, and is, and shall always be,\n\nworld without end. Amen.\n\nWorship Matters\n\nIt’s True: We Are One at Baptism!\n\nJohn U. Miller, both executive director of the Capitol Area Council of Churches and pastor of the Evangelical Protestant UCC in Albany, New York, has worked with others to design a program that celebrates baptism as incorporation into the full body of Christ.\n\nAt any congregation’s request, the “Ecumenical Witnesses of Baptism” program, sponsored by the area council of churches, will send representatives from the wider church to participate in any baptism. Often, participants may include representatives from the Roman Catholic Church, Presbyterian Church USA, United Methodist Church, Reformed Church in America, or Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Each congregation that invites the representatives may involve them in a variety of ways in the service — from liturgist to mere witness. Often, it is the ecumenical representative that offers the baptismal certificate to those baptized.\n\nThis spirit of the ecumenical witness program is at the heart of UCC understanding of Baptism. Encourage the practice of witnesses from other denominations at all baptisms celebrated at your congregation.\n\nFrom Prayers and Patterns from Worship (Cleveland: Local Church Ministries, United Church of Christ, 2004) 25.\n\nGod’s World Matters\n\nConnecting Sacraments with the Stuff of Life\n\nIn the sacraments, water, bread, and juice — ordinary stuff of life — convey the presence of Christ to the world. Born of water, Christians forever connect the basic gift with new life and oneness in Christ. Can we ever again simply take God’s gift of water for granted? Fed with the bread of Christ, we are filled and transformed. Can we forget those who go without bread? God is present in the gifts. As Christians, God calls us to be stewards of the common stuff. In gratitude, blessed with the sacraments, we are called to share water and bread with the world.\n\nView the DVD, Troubled Waters, and discover how the UCC is doing its part to raise the justice issues surrounding the immediate and future availability of life-giving, life-sustaining water. Most vulnerable to the depletion of water are those on the margins, the poor, and the powerless. In gratitude for the sharing of God’s goodness at Baptism and at the table, how do we work for adequate water and bread for those who suffer from little?"
