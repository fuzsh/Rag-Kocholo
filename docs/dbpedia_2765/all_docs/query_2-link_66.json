        "text": "By Jason Hamilton\n\nPublished on:\n\nWe all know of King Arthur, Merlin, or Lancelot. But there are literal thousands of other characters that are or have been part of the mythos, not to mention various groups they belonged to. This is my list, from all the research I’ve been able to find, of Arthurian characters and groups.\n\nWhat’s on this List of Arthurian Characters and Groups?\n\nThere are a lot of characters that have become part of the Arthurian mythos throughout the years. Many have gone through multiple iterations and interpretations from authors across the British Isles, France, Germany, and much more.\n\nThis list combines both characters and groups from the Arthurian legends. While it is hard to be fully comprehensive, we encourage you to let us know if there are any important characters that you would include. You can do so through our contact page, social media, or in the comments.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this list! If you like it, you might want to consider visiting our Arthurian Legends Hub for similar resources. Check it out!\n\nTable of Arthurian Characters\n\nThe following table is the comprehensive list of EVERYTHING that I’ve found so far. If you’d like something a little more curated, with the most famous Arthurian Characters, scroll past the list to see the content below.\n\nGroups or Types of Arthurian Characters\n\nIn the Arthurian legend, there are several categories of characters, including:\n\nKnights of the Round Table: These are the most famous of Arthur’s knights, including Lancelot, Gawain, Tristan, Galahad, and Percival, among others.\n\nRoyalty: King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, and King Mark are some of the central figures in the legend.\n\nWizards and Faerie: Merlin the wizard is one of the most famous characters in the Arthurian legend, but there are also other magical figures, such as Morgan le Fay and the Lady of the Lake. Any characters such as Gloriana in The Faerie Queene or various Giants seen throughout the legends would fit into this category.\n\nThe Women of Arthurian Britain: The damsels in the Arthurian legend are often the center of a given story, often need to be rescued by the knights or providing motivation for a quest. They include such as Elaine of Astolat and Iseult.\n\nPeasants and Commoners: Characters such as Kay the Seneschal and Tom a’Lincoln play important roles in the stories as well.\n\nSaints and Holy Figures: Characters such as St. Joseph of Arimathea and St. Illtud play important roles in the legend.\n\nSaxons and Romans: There are many characters that are not British in origin, such as Cerdic of Wessex, who was a Saxon, or Lucius, who was a Roman.\n\nWe’re going to be taking a look at the main characters in each of these categories, but first, let’s start with some of the most important characters in Arthurian Legend.\n\nThe Big Players\n\nThese are the most important characters in Arthurian legend, and most of the stories involve these characters in some way.\n\nKing Arthur: King Arthur is the central figure in the Arthurian legend, known for his bravery, wisdom, and leadership. He is depicted as a powerful king who defeated the Saxons and established a vast empire and is best known through works such as Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia Regum Britanniae and French Arthurian romances, which introduced elements and characters that have become integral to the Arthurian story, such as Guinevere, Merlin, and the Holy Grail.\n\nMerlin: Merlin is a legendary figure featured in the King Arthur myth, known for being a mage, with several other main roles, usually depicted as a composite of historic and legendary figures, born of a mortal woman and sired by an incubus, known for prophecy and shapeshifting, who engineers the birth of King Arthur and serves as his advisor until his disappearance or death.\n\nGuinevere: Guinevere was the queen of Great Britain and the wife of King Arthur in Arthurian legend, with a prominent role in the love affair with Lancelot and being depicted as everything from a villainous traitor to a noble lady, with her character being shaped by her relationship with Lancelot in many versions and assuming more active roles in modern adaptations.\n\nLancelot: Lancelot du Lac, one of the greatest Knights of the Round Table, is depicted as King Arthur’s close companion and the lord of Joyous Gard and personal champion of Queen Guinevere. He becomes central to the Arthurian romance tradition as a hero of many battles, quests and tournaments who also has a tragic love affair with Guinevere and causes a civil war that leads to the downfall of Arthur’s kingdom.\n\nMorgan Le Fay: Morgan Le Fay is a complex character in the Arthurian legend who has undergone changes throughout different texts. She was originally depicted as the ruler of Avalon and a healer, but later became more of an antagonistic figure towards King Arthur and was associated with paganism and female sexuality. Morgan Le Fay’s duality and her ability to use magic have made her a popular subject in contemporary texts, where she is sometimes portrayed as good, evil, or somewhere in between.\n\nMordred: Mordred is a complex character in the Arthurian legend who has been portrayed as both a knight and a traitor. He is usually depicted as the villainous son of King Arthur and Morgause who desires to claim the throne and is eager to bring about the end of Camelot. Mordred is often portrayed as being in love with Queen Guinevere and fighting Arthur for both the throne and her heart. Depending on the interpretation, Mordred is either killed by Arthur or kills him at the Battle of Camlann. He is widely considered a villain and is even included in the lowest circle of Hell for traitors in Dante Alighieri’s “Inferno.”\n\nGawain: Sir Gawain is a legendary knight who is best known from the 14th century romantic epic poem “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.” He is the half-brother of Mordred and the son of Morgause and King Lot and is often depicted as a model of chivalry and goodness. In “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” Gawain defends King Arthur against a mysterious knight who challenges the king to a strange game. Gawain accepts the challenge and beheads the Green Knight, only to go on a quest to find him a year later and prove his greatness as an honorable knight.\n\nElaine of Astolat: Elaine of Astolat is a character in the Arthurian legend who is known for her unrequited love for Lancelot. Her story is told in Sir Thomas Malory’s “Le Morte d’Arthur” and Alfred Tennyson’s ballad “The Lady of Shalott.” Elaine nurses Lancelot back to health after he is wounded in a tournament, but he leaves her to return to Guinevere. Elaine dies of a broken heart, and her image as a woman whose love goes unrequited has inspired many paintings and works of art.\n\nMorgause: Morgause is a female character in the Arthurian legend who is sometimes confused with her sister Morgan Le Fay. Originally called Anna in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s “History of the Kings of Britain,” Morgause’s character was fleshed out in Thomas Malory’s “Le Morte d’Arthur.” In this version, she marries King Lot of Orkney and has four sons with him, all of whom serve Arthur as Knights of the Round Table. However, she is also the mother of Mordred through an affair with King Arthur, and her unlucky affairs lead to her death. Despite this, contemporary portrayals of Morgause have not been favorable, leaving room for writers to reclaim her story.\n\nGalahad: Galahad is a legendary knight known for being the noblest knight chosen by God to discover the Holy Grail. He is the son of Lancelot and is famous for his purity, which is linked to his success in finding the Holy Grail. Galahad’s reputation as a sinless knight is a stark contrast to his father Lancelot’s reputation for extramarital affairs, and his virginity has become an important aspect of his story in the Arthurian legend.\n\nThe Lady of the Lake: The Lady of the Lake, also known as Viviane or Nimuë, is a powerful and influential figure in the Arthurian legend. She resides in a castle beneath the lake that surrounds Avalon and is responsible for gifting Arthur with Excalibur, bringing him to Avalon to heal him, and raising Lancelot. Her relationship with Merlin is also a subject of debate, with some stories depicting her as his lover and teacher of magic, while others show her as the one who imprisons him. The Lady of the Lake’s morally ambiguous character is typical of many female characters in the Arthurian legend.\n\nTristan: Tristan is the legendary hero of the Tristan and Iseult story, first recorded in the 12th century, in which he falls in love with the Irish princess Iseult while escorting her to marry King Mark of Cornwall, leading to an adulterous relationship and eventual banishment and death. He is also featured in Arthurian legends as a skilled knight and friend of Lancelot.\n\nIseult: Iseult is a legendary Irish princess who is the main character in the Tristan poems and the opera Tristan und Isolde, famous for her love affair with Tristan after they accidentally drink a love potion and their tragic end when Tristan is killed by King Mark and crushes Iseult in a tight embrace as his final act.\n\nJoseph of Arimathea: Joseph of Arimathea is a biblical figure who is said to have taken the body of Jesus after the crucifixion. He is also a figure in the Arthurian legend, where he is said to have brought the Holy Grail to Britain.\n\nUther Pendragon: Uther Pendragon is the father of King Arthur and the previous king of Britain. He is often depicted as a brave and just ruler who paved the way for his son’s rule.\n\nIgraine: Igraine is the mother of King Arthur and the wife of King Uther Pendragon. She was originally married to King Gorlois before the latter was killed in battle. Her daughters Morgause, Elaine, and Morgan were a result of that prior marriage.\n\nKnights of the Round Table\n\nThe most famous group in the legends of King Arthur are the Knights of the Round Table, the famed group of Knights who worked with Arthur to bring about a medieval utopia in Camelot.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of figures reported as members of this order, but some of the most common include the following:\n\nAccolon: Accolon is a character in Arthurian legends who is a lover of Morgan le Fay and is killed by King Arthur in a duel involving the magic sword Excalibur.

with Arthur using the real Excalibur, which ends with Accolon’s death and Morgan’s revenge by stealing and losing Excalibur’s protective scabbard.\n\nAglovale: Aglovale de Galis is the eldest son of

Arthurian legend who is the father of Olwen and the uncle of Goreu, and is the primary antagonist in the story of Culhwch and Olwen, where he is defeated by Culhwch and his companions after completing a series of impossible tasks.\n\nWomen of Arthurian Britain\n\nThough many of these figures are not as well known as some of the men in the Arthurian Legends, these stories are filled with some of the greatest female characters in all of medieval literature.\n\nIndeed, many of these more minor character make up a huge inspiration for me and what I’m creating with my own Arthurian Legends universe.\n\nBlanchefleur: Blanchefleur is a popular High Middle Ages female given name with multiple fictional characters named as such in Arthurian romance, including Tristan’s mother, the heroine of Floris and Blanchefleur, daughter of Theirry in Garin le Loherain, and wife of Percival.\n\nBrangaine: Brangaine is the handmaid and confidante of Iseult of Ireland in the Arthurian legend of

Elaine of Benoic is the wife of King Ban, birth mother of Lancelot, and known as the Queen of Great Sorrows after the conquest of their kingdom and the death of her husband, and she becomes a nun along with her sister Evaine, the widowed wife of King Bors and mother of Sir Lionel and Sir Bors, in the Vulgate Cycle, while in an alternate version from the Italian rewrite Tavola Ritonda, she is named Gostanza and dies of distress shortly after Ban’s death and Lancelot’s premature birth.\n\nElaine of Corbenic: Elaine, also known as Amite and Elizabeth, is a character from Arthurian legend known as the “Grail Maiden” or the “Grail Bearer” and is the daughter of the Fisher King, King Pelles of Corbenic, and the mother of Galahad from her rape of Lancelot, derived from Percival’s sister and possibly also from Arthur’s sister and linked to Amice from Meraugis de Portlesguez, and connected to the sovereignty goddess of Ireland, Ériu.\n\nElaine of Garlot: Queen Elaine of Garlot is a daughter of Gorlois and Igraine, sister to Morgan and Morgause, half-sister to Arthur, wife of King Nentres of Garlot, mother of Galeschin and Elaine, and her name was changed to Elaine by Thomas

the stories having similarities of the protagonist questioning her love, going on a dangerous trip, and eventually reconciling after proving her loyalty.\n\nGuinevere (see above)\n\nIgraine (see

and Olwen,” who is won by Culhwch after he completes a series of difficult tasks set by her father.\n\nRagnell: Dame Ragnell, a hag in the Arthurian legend, appears in the story “The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell,” where she offers the answer to the question “What do women want?” to King Arthur in exchange for the marriage of Sir Gawain. Despite her initial appearance as a foul creature, she transforms into a beautiful maiden and teaches Sir Gawain a lesson in sovereignty and the power of choice. The true identity and motives of Dame Ragnell remain a mystery and her role in the story raises questions about the nature of women, magic, and the consequences of appearances.\n\nVivianne: Vivianne is another name for the Lady of the Lake. Sometimes this is a separate figure from Nimue. Other times, she is simply the main Lady of the Lake and there is no Nimue present.\n\nSaints and Holy Figures\n\nSome of the earliest stories involving King Arthur and his knights actually come from an old genre of medieval literature known as the “Lives of the Saints”. In these stories, and in others, several prominent\n\nCadoc: Saint Cadoc was a 5th-6th century Abbot of Llancarfan in Wales who founded many churches in Cornwall, Brittany, Dyfed, and Scotland and was known as “Cattwg Ddoeth the Wise” with a collection of his maxims included in the Myvyrian Archaiology and is listed in the Roman Martyrology under 21 September and is important to the case for the historicity of King Arthur as one of seven saints’ lives that mention him independently of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s “Historia Regum Britanniae”.\n\nCarantoc: Saint Carantoc was a 6th-century abbot, confessor, and saint in Wales and the West Country, credited with founding Llangrannog, Ceredigion, Wales and St Carantoc’s Church, Crantock, and his name is listed among the Cornish Saints.\n\nDerfel: St. Derfel Gadarn is a 6th-century Celtic Christian monk and saint who was a noted warrior and is said to have been one of seven survivors of the Battle of Camlan and a member of King Arthur’s court in medieval Welsh tradition, later becoming a wandering hermit and eventually an abbot of Llantwit and Ynys Enlli.\n\nIlltud: St. Illtud is a 6th-century Welsh abbot venerated as the founder and teacher of the Bangor Illtyd, an early center of learning in Llanilltud Fawr, that educated many famous saints such as Saint David and Gildas, though there are few reliable sources about his life story.\n\nJoseph of Arimathea (see above)\n\nSaxons and Romans\n\nBesides the Britains, the two biggest groups of characters that make appearances in the Arthurian Legends are the Saxons and Romans. The Saxons in particular are a powerful force at this time, and take a prominent place in the Battle of Badon.\n\nBut the Romans (somewhat anachronistically) also take part, and fight with Arthur for control of Britain in several versions of the myth.\n\nCerdic of Wessex: Cerdic is described as the founder and first king of the Saxon kingdom of Wessex in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and is claimed to be the ancestor of later West Saxon kings, but his origin, ethnicity, and existence are debated and he was originally known as the king of the Gewissae folk or tribal group.\n\nHengest and Horsa: Hengist and Horsa are legendary Germanic brothers said to have led the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes in the invasion of Britain and Hengist is said to have become the first Jutish king of Kent, although they are now widely considered to be mythical figures.\n\nLucius: Lucius Tiberius/Hiberius, a fictional Western Roman procurator/emperor from Arthurian legend, is depicted as being killed in a war against King Arthur after he invades the lands of Arthur’s allies on the continent and demands tribute, with theories about his origin ranging from being misspelled from Glycerius to being a reflex of the god Lugh.\n\nOverall, there are thousands of interesting characters to explore in the Arthurian Legends.
