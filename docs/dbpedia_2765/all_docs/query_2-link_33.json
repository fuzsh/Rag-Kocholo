        "text": "Biographical sketch—\n\n[transcript of an obituary in The Merrill Daily Herald, Merrill, Wisconsin, 30 December 1936, pages 1-2.]\n\nMerrill Pastor Passes Away In Madison Hospital\n\nRev. A.F. Perkins, Pastor Here Since 1931, Dies As Result of a Nervous Breakdown\n\nThe Rev. Arthur F. Perkins, Presbyterian pastor here since 1931 and central figure in a controversy with the Winnebago presbytery since which ended in his resignation from the Presbyterian church of the United States and organization of a new church in this city died last night at 8:30 oâclock in the Wisconsin General Hospital at Madison.\n\nHis death followed a nervous breakdown precipitated last summer, members of his loyal flock said, by the unfair trial and persecution preceding his resignation.Â While he had been in a serious condition his passing occurred unexpectedly.\n\nHis wife, Mrs. Marie Heroux Perkins who had been with him constantly during his illness until he was moved from a sanatorium in Missouri to the Madison hospital, was visiting at the home of R.B. Page, trustee of the new church congregation, when she received word of his death.Â His son, Dale Perkins, Wausau, and his daughter, Mrs. Paul Nagler, Milton Junction, came here today.\n\nThe passing of the Rev. Perkins brought forth expressions of regret and sympathy for the family from all sides.Â During his pastorate in this city and particularly during his ecclesiastical trial before the Winnebago Presbytery, Mr. Perkins gained many friends and supporters from among those outside as well as within his own congregation.Â The respect and esteem in which he was held knew no denominational bounds."
