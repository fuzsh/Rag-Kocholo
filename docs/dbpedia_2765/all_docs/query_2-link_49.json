        "text": "Clossie Sular Johnson, 62, of Thornton, passed away on Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nClossie will be available for viewing at Groesbeck Funeral Home on Friday, Aug. 9, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Funeral services will take place at 10 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, at Central Baptist Church in Thornton, with Reverend Tracy Sims and Brandon Verm officiating. Burial will be in the Thornton Cemetery.\n\nMembers of the Limestone County Fire Departments will serve as honorary pallbearers. Active pallbearers will be Demarcus Bolts Jr., James Hutchison, Jamison Brantley, Nehemiah Gray, Walter Hewitt, and Bryan Blanton.\n\nClossie was born on Dec. 18, 1961, in Thornton to Earl Johnson and Willie Ruth Ferguson. He spent his childhood in Dallas and Thornton, where he lived for 14 years and graduated from Groesbeck High School.\n\nAs a child, Clossie aspired to become a police officer. At the age of 11, in Dallas, he was hit by a car, leading to multiple fractures. The odds were against him, but he persevered and spent the next two years in a complete body cast. Despite being given only six months to live by doctors, it’s impressive how long he’s been active running for the past 51 years. In Dallas, he was a difficult child for the family to keep up with due to his frequent visits to the police and fire stations. It then was clear his passion for serving was unmistakable.\n\nClossie lived in Thornton throughout his adult life and was widely known in Limestone County due to his extensive volunteer work. He contributed his time to Groesbeck Hospital, security, traffic control at rodeos and school events, and helped with funerals across the county. He also served as a volunteer firefighter. Clossie particularly enjoyed accompanying medical staff on helicopter transports and took pride in wearing his uniform, complete with black pants and dress shoes.\n\nClossie was dedicated and passionate about helping others, regardless of whether he knew them personally or received payment. Whether he was mowing, cutting trees, moving hay, or assisting with cows, Clossie found joy in every task and took pride in his willingness to lend a hand.\n\nHe was an outdoors enthusiast who relished swimming, fishing, and simply relaxing on the porch. Clossie loved fishing, whether in stock tanks or at Lake Limestone, and often brought his catch home for the family to enjoy. He took pride in his cooking, often boasting about his skills with steaks and his nickname, “Fry Daddy.” Dancing was a great passion of his; he enjoyed dancing at parties, weddings, and clubs to any music, though country, especially Keith Whitley, was his favorite. He also loved watching TV, with his favorites being Sanford and Son (which he could watch all day), Adam-12, and Gunsmoke.\n\nClossie met life’s challenges with a smile, living each day to the fullest. His sole regret was not owning his own home, a dream he finally achieved ten months ago. He was incredibly proud of his new home, which represented the realization of a long-held ambition.\n\nHe was deeply connected with his family, particularly with his Neason family (Bill, Elizabeth, and Melissa) in Thornton. Known for his sense of humor and enjoyment of joking, he was a social butterfly with a loving disposition, winning the affection of many. As a devoted member of Central Baptist Church in Thornton, his strong faith inspired his sister Patty to join the church as well, which played a significant role in restoring her faith in God. He was surrounded by loved ones until his last breath and will be greatly missed by many friends and family.\n\nClossie was preceded in death by his father, Earl Johnson; ohnson\n\nstepfather, Herman Reed; brothers, Frank Bolts and Larry Bolts; grandfathers, Charlie Reed and Arthur Ferguson; uncle, Charles Arthur Ferguson; and aunt, Lois Moss.\n\nHe is survived by his mother, Willie Ruth Reed of Thornton; his sister, Pam Ferguson of Irving; his brother, Dwight Ferguson of Thornton; his sister, Esell Johnson of Tyler; Patty Johnson of Harker Heights; his brother and sister- in-law, RL and Edie Johnson of Thornton; his brother, Arthur (Deacon) Johnson of Thornton; his aunt, Peaches Moss of Fort Worth; his cousin, Frank Garrett of Dallas; his brother Herman Reed Jr. of Mexia; his sisters, Ruby, Varion, Iveydell, Dione and Melinda; his nephews, Demarcus Bolts Sr. (Bo), Tramond Bolts (Donyell), Bryan Blanton, Derrick Ferguson, and Cedric Johnson. He is also survived by his nieces, LaQuivus Matthews Bolts (Quivie) and Jacqueline Johnson (Nana), along with a host of other nieces, nephews, cousins, and extended family.\n\nAcknowledgement from Family - During this challenging time, the support from Clossie’s friends and community has been immensely comforting. Your prayers have bolstered our faith, your words have uplifted our sorrowful hearts, your presence has offered us a shoulder to lean on, and your thoughtful gestures have helped us maintain our strength. The beauty of the flowers, the kindness of each card, donations, telephone calls, personal visits and kind words have all added a glimmer of light to a somber situation. We are profoundly grateful for everything you’ve done to console us, whether through your words, actions, or gestures. Thank you sincerely."
