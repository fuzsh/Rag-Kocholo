        "text": "“ You know, all that ever mattered to me was loyalty. It was all I knew. It was all I ever believed in... „ —Arthur Morgan to John Marston in \"The Bridge to Nowhere\"\n\nArthur Morgan is a central character and the primary protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nArthur Morgan was born circa 1863[1] to Beatrice and Lyle Morgan in the northern United States.[2] As a child, his mother died of unknown causes, while his father was a petty criminal and outlaw. In 1874, when Arthur was 11 years old, his father was arrested for larceny. Morgan later witnessed his death and, despite a strained relationship with him, still donned his hat and kept a picture of him.[3][4]\n\nAround 1877, Arthur was found as a \"wild delinquent\" and picked up off the streets by Dutch van der Linde and Hosea Matthews.[5] Viewing the pair as surrogate father figures, Arthur came to share Dutch's vision of a life lived free from the constraints of civilization and the rule of law. The pair taught him how to read, write, hunt, fight, shoot, and ride, becoming their first protégé as well as one of the founding members of the Van der Linde gang.\n\nArthur found a pet dog named Copper at some point whom he grew particularly close to and occasionally took baths with. Although Arthur had difficulty controlling him, he admired the dog's spirit. Copper later passed away and Arthur kept a picture of him on his wagon. He also acquired a mare at some point named Boadicea whom he became fond of, although she passed away sometime before the gang's arrival at Colter.\n\nAs a young adult, Arthur met a girl named Mary Gillis where the two fell deeply in love and even became engaged. He befriended her younger brother Jamie and taught him horseback-riding. However, Arthur's preference for a life of crime coupled with the prevalent disapproval of Mary's family, most strongly from her father ultimately caused their relationship to fall apart and the pair separated.\n\nIn 1884, Arthur was sent out fishing and pridefully returned with three beautiful bass. The gang celebrated with a big feast and toasted him all night long. The following week, Arthur and Dutch walked in the local market where it was revealed that he had simply purchased the bass from a fish monger, much to his embarrassment.[6]\n\nIn 1885, Arthur met a 12 year-old boy named John Marston who had been saved by Dutch from being lynched by a group of Illinois homesteaders. John was inducted into the gang and raised alongside Arthur with the pair growing as close as brothers. Dutch instilled the boys with his anarchist worldviews against a corrupt government and preached that revenge was a fool's game. Over the years, Arthur and John became regarded as Dutch's favorite 'sons'.\n\nIn 1887, Arthur participated in the gang's first major bank robbery alongside Dutch and Hosea. At 2 o'clock, the trio burst into the banking house of Lee and Hoyt and managed to make off with $5000 in gold. After the robbery, they lingered in town, going to hovels, shanties, and orphanages handing out money, envisioning themselves as 'Robin Hood' figures.[7] It was following this event where Arthur became a wanted man.\n\nSome years later, Arthur met and slept with a 19 year-old waitress named Eliza, resulting in her becoming pregnant with their son, Isaac. Although Eliza knew of Arthur's lifestyle, she accepted whatever support he offered to her and their son. Arthur, not wanting to promise anything he couldn't keep, said that he would do right by them. He would periodically visit Eliza and Isaac every few months and stay with them for days at a time. Arthur remembered fondly of Isaac as a 'good kid'.\n\nTragically one day, however, Arthur arrived at their home and saw two crosses outside. He knew immediately that they were both dead, and later learned that they had been shot and killed by robbers, all for ten dollars.[8] This traumatic incident hardened Arthur as a result as he never truly coped with the pain and gave him the understanding to not live the life of an outlaw and expect good things to happen to him.\n\nIn 1894, a prostitute named Abigail Roberts joined the Van der Linde Gang. At some point, she fell in love with John Marston and became pregnant with their son named Jack. Arthur became a surrogate uncle figure towards him growing up. John however refused to accept responsibility over the boy and soon left the gang. Around a year later, John returned, while Dutch and the majority of the gang welcomed him back with open arms, Arthur felt betrayed by his actions and a rift was formed between the two which steadily grew over the years.\n\nBy 1898, the gang had found itself in Montana. During their stay, Hosea caught several large salmon during a fishing trip and planned to prepare a feast for the whole camp. However, the feast was cut short when Copper found and ate the fish, passing away soon after.[9] After a fire, in which Arthur's old journal was lost, and some trouble up north, the gang traveled south and east, taking a slow and tortuous trail down through the Northern Grizzlies to throw off anyone tracking them. They then spent several months in the wilderness. During the winter, they stuck mostly to the western foothills of the mountain.\n\nWhile traversing the Grizzlies, several new members were picked up and brought into the gang. A young teenager, Lenny Summers, and a drifting outlaw, Charles Smith. Arthur had generally fair opinions of the pair, eventually forming close bonds with the two. Later on, the gang came across Jenny Kirk, a young woman abandoned by the roadside. The most recent member inducted into the gang was Micah Bell, a hot-headed career outlaw who saved Dutch's life in a shootout. Although Dutch found a liking to Micah, Arthur openly disliked him for his tendencies.\n\nBy the spring of 1899, the gang had arrived in West Elizabeth and decided to hide in plain sight just outside Blackwater, a town undergoing the process of industrialization. The gang began to scope out many leads, including Arthur and Hosea, who were planning a hefty real estate scam. Despite this, Dutch was also planning something big. Supported by Micah, Dutch began working on plans to rob a ferry laden with riches coming to town. Hosea and Arthur were reluctant despite Dutch's beliefs. His plan was to carry out the heist then flee west, possibly into New Austin. Then, after Arthur and Hosea carried out their scam, they would join the gang the following day.\n\nUnfortunately, the ferry heist did not go as expected. At some point during the robbery, the gang was ambushed by the Pinkertons, causing a massive firefight known as the Blackwater Massacre. Arthur and Hosea arrived late, and by then, the gang was barely holding on.[10] Several gang members were killed or seriously injured, and they fled the area in an \"almighty scramble,\" north into the mountains in hopes of avoiding the law. Arthur suspected that the heist might have been a set up.\n\nEvents of Red Dead Redemption 2\n\nColter Chapter\n\nAfter the botched ferry heist, Dutch and the gang are forced to flee Blackwater and attempt to cross the mountains west to evade law enforcement. Not long after taking shelter in the abandoned mining town of Colter, Dutch and Arthur go looking for either John Marston or Micah Bell, both of whom went scouting ahead. Arthur and Dutch find Micah, who informs them of a homestead he found, which appears to have a party going on inside. They stop at the homestead to ask for help, where they encounter members of the O'Driscoll Boys. After meeting them, a gunfight breaks out, which results in the deaths of the O'Driscolls. After looting the ranch, they encounter Sadie Adler, whose husband was killed by the O'Driscolls. Taking pity on her condition, they bring her back to camp. Not long after returning, Arthur is asked by Abigail Roberts to find John Marston, who has gone missing. Arthur and Javier Escuella find John seriously wounded and scarred across the face after being attacked by wolves. They bring him back to camp, where he begins to recover.\n\nA few days later, Dutch plans an ambush on the O'Driscoll camp, which is situated nearby according to an O'Driscoll they interrogated at the homestead. The gang attacks the camp, and after defeating them, find dynamite and information about a train belonging to Leviticus Cornwall that the O'Driscolls intended to rob. On their way back to Colter, they come across an O'Driscoll that they previously saw being reprimanded by Colm. Arthur volunteers to catch him and succeeds, learning that his name is Kieran. The gang ties him up in the stables, starving him for information.\n\nDue to the gang's hasty escape from Blackwater, food and supplies were in short supply. Arthur ventures out with Charles Smith to find some food, during which Charles gives Arthur a bow and tells him that he'll have to use it, due to the hand injury which the former sustained during the failed ferry robbery. The two share a friendly conversation, discussing their history both in and outside of the gang, while Charles provides Arthur with some hunting tips. Arthur manages to take down two deer, and so he and Charles return to camp with enough food to last the gang for the next few days.\n\nIn order to fund their escape from the mountains, Dutch has the gang rob the Cornwall train. However, the detonator that the gang planned to use fails, so they have to chase after the train. Arthur, Lenny, and Javier jump onto the train from above, although Javier falls off immediately and Lenny also slips, but manages to grasp onto the carriage. After Arthur helps him up, the two manage to fight their way through the train and slay most of the guards, before the rest of the gang arrives and finishes off the remaining few. The gang then use dynamite to enter the private car, where they manage to find some highly-valuable state bonds. Dutch then leaves Arthur to deal with the last three guards as he wishes, all of whom had surrendered; their fate is therefore left to the player. After dealing with them, Arthur rides back to Colter.\n\nHorseshoe Overlook Chapter\n\nAfter the thaw comes in, the gang leaves the mountains for a new location in The Heartlands, near the town of Valentine. Arthur goes to the saloon in Valentine, where he meets Javier, Charles, and later Bill. A bar fight breaks out after Bill drunkenly attacks someone after entering the saloon. After fighting off some men, Arthur eventually engages a huge, burly man named Tommy, who overpowers Arthur and throws him out the saloon window on to the muddy street outside. After a bitter brawl, Arthur defeats him and beats him severely, stopping only when Thomas Downes pleads for him to do so. After the fight has ended, Arthur is called over by Dutch, where he meets Josiah Trelawny again. He learns that Sean MacGuire is alive, and they make plans to rescue him. Dutch sends Arthur to accompany Trelawny, Charles Smith and Javier Escuella in rescuing Sean. During the rescue attempt, Arthur takes part in the frontal assault along with Trelawny and Javier, while Charles scouts from a distance. After a bloody firefight with the bounty hunters, Sean is rescued and the gang members return to camp, throwing a party celebrating his safe return.\n\nArthur also goes on a hunt for a \"1000 pound bear\" with Hosea, who gives Arthur a raven black Shire horse, of which he can choose to either sell or keep at the stables in Valentine. The two set out to Grizzlies East to find the bear. After setting some bait, the two wait for the bear, who attacks them. Hosea thanks Arthur for saving his life and gives him a map of Legendary Animals. The two can either part ways or go back to camp together.\n\nArthur proceeds to interrogate the O'Driscoll that the gang captured in the mountains. Dutch calls Bill over to castrate Kieran with burning hot tongs if he doesn't reveal the location of Colm O'Driscoll. Kieran then says that he's at Six Point Cabin, and is accompanied there by Arthur, John, and Bill. Upon reaching the hideout, the trio stealthily take out some of the O'Driscolls, before a shootout eventually ensues. Arthur enters a cabin in the hope of finding Colm but is instead surprised by an O'Driscoll goon. Before Arthur can be killed, Kieran appears and fatally shoots the O'Driscoll, saving Arthur's life. Arthur then threatens him after Colm is not there, believing that he set them up. Kieran points out that he wouldn't have saved Arthur's life if that were the case and, with some more prompting from John and Bill, Kieran is allowed to stay with the gang. Arthur can also go buffalo hunting with Charles at some point during this chapter, and he can also rob the homestead of Chez Porter with Javier.\n\nAt some point, Arthur will receive a letter from Mary Linton, who asks Arthur to meet her. After reading the letter, Arthur is told by Leopold Strauss that he needs to recover a debt from Thomas Downes, a rancher. Arthur goes to Downes Ranch and confronts Mr. Downes. Thomas says that he is destitute, prompting Arthur to beat him. Eventually, Thomas' wife Edith arrives, saying that her husband is ill and they truly are destitute, leading to Arthur leaving the ranch. Arthur can meet Mary soon afterward, who tells him that her brother Jamie has been inducted into a batty cult known as the Chelonians. If Arthur agrees to help her, he will find Jamie with them near Cumberland Forest. Arthur scares them off and then chases the escaping Jamie, eventually catching him and shooting the gun out of his hand when he tries to kill himself, before returning him to Mary.\n\nAfter returning from a scouting mission, Lenny Summers tells Arthur and Dutch that Micah started a gunfight in Strawberry after getting drunk and subsequently killed two O'Driscolls, which led to his arrest. Before attending to Micah, Arthur brings Lenny to Valentine for a drink to calm his nerves, and both of them get very drunk. Once he has sobered up, Arthur heads for Strawberry to rescue Micah. The Sheriff refuses to release Micah, so Arthur breaks the bars on his cell and a firefight ensues, with Micah immediately killing his cellmate, who was an O'Driscoll. Arthur says to Micah that they need to leave immediately, but Micah refuses, saying he has something to do. The two are forced to kill almost every lawman in the town until at last Micah arrives at a house and knocks on the door, kills the man living there and his wife, and retrieves his prized revolvers from them. The two then flee on their horses and fight off the pursuing lawmen, after which Arthur berates Micah for his recklessness for the unnecessary violence and going back for the guns. Micah says that he won't return to Dutch until he does something to redeem himself - he asks Arthur to meet him somewhere nearby to carry out a robbery.\n\nAfterwards, Arthur goes out to meet Micah, as promised earlier, and so they set out to rob a stagecoach that Micah found out about from his O'Driscoll cellmate. After commandeering the carriage, they are then attacked by O'Driscolls, who try to rob them. Arthur and Micah eventually manage to fight them off from the other side of a river, allowing the two to finally claim the money. Later on, while at camp, Abigail asks Arthur to take Jack Marston fishing at the Dakota River. While there, they are approached by Andrew Milton and Edgar Ross; agents of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. Milton reveals that they caught and killed Mac Callander, and tells Arthur that in exchange for turning Dutch in he will be spared the noose. Arthur angrily refuses and takes Jack back to camp after the agents leave.\n\nJohn contacts Arthur and tells him that he heard of a train that will be moving through Valentine. He suggests that in order to get the train to stop, Arthur should steal a stagecoach carrying Cornwall oil. Arthur can steal the stagecoach, and rendezvous with Sean, Charles, and John. After putting the stagecoach in front of the train, it screeches to a halt and the gang boards it. Charles deals with the engineer, John goes down the train with a bag for the loot, and Arthur provides some encouragement for those not so willing to give. He then goes looking for Sean, who was supposed to have been dealing with the baggage car, only for him to have gone. Arthur eventually finds him in a tussle with a guard, who Arthur kills. The robbery is then cut short, with the law descending upon them. The four gang members are forced to flee and manage to escape the law.\n\nJohn, who thinks they still need more money, talks to Arthur and tells him that he hears of a herd of sheep coming in. He tells Arthur to buy a sniper rifle and they ride up to a hill, shooting bullets at the ranch-hands. They flee, and Arthur corrals the sheep to the auction. The man who runs the auction recognizes the sheep and says if they pay him twenty-five percent of all profits, he will keep his mouth shut. This sum falls to eighteen percent after John negotiates with him. Arthur and John then go to the nearby saloon, where they meet Strauss and Dutch. During the meeting, Leviticus Cornwall and his hired guns capture Strauss and John. Dutch and Arthur rescue them, before fighting their way out of the town back to camp. Realizing that they can't stay in the area, Dutch sends Arthur and Charles to investigate Dewberry Creek, a possible camp location suggested by Micah. Arthur and Charles instead discover a German mother and her children, with their father missing. Charles manages to trace the father to Clemens Point, where they fight off some bandits and free him. Arthur returns him to his family while Charles returns to the others to divert the caravan to Clemens Point, a much better location for camp.\n\nClemens Point Chapter\n\nAfter moving to the new camp location, Hosea, Arthur, and Dutch go out riding. They encounter Sheriff Leigh Gray, who has captured Trelawny due to him running an illegal gold prospecting operation. After Arthur recaptures a group of outlaws who escaped, Trelawny is released. In addition, Gray decides to deputize Arthur, Dutch, and Bill Williamson in order to crack down on a Lemoyne Raiders moonshine operation. With the help of Deputy Archibald MacGregor, the three gang members succeed in bringing down the moonshine operation, earning favor with the Sheriff.\n\nDutch tells Arthur to go to Caliga Hall to gather more information about the Gray family. He ends up talking to Beau Gray, who asks him to go to Braithwaite Manor and deliver a letter to his secret lover, Penelope Braithwaite. After delivering the letter to her, she gives him one of her own back, to give to Beau. The letter will say that Penelope is planning on going to a women's suffrage rally. The news that Penelope is going to a women's suffrage rally alarms Beau, and he tells Arthur that her life is in danger, offering him money if he will help him save her. Arthur and Beau ride up to the carriage where the protesters will be riding in, and when they are unsuccessful in convincing her to leave, Arthur is tasked with driving the carriage to protect her. At Penelope's request, Arthur takes Beau away to save him from his cousins. Arthur is subsequently paid by Beau, before he then returns to camp.\n\nDutch grows concerned over Trelawny's disappearance and sends Arthur and Charles to find him. They find the caravan he had been staying in, which has blood on the floor and signs that Trelawny had left in a hurry. The two track his trail to a small camp, where they discover some of his belongings. The pair are attacked by two bounty hunters at the camp, whom they promptly subdue. They interrogate one of the bounty hunters, who reveals that Trelawny is being held at a nearby farmhouse. The duo ride over and find him being escorted into a cabin by a few bounty hunters. They attack the bounty hunters, and they flee into the nearby tobacco field. The two venture into the field, and hunt down the remaining bounty hunters, before returning to Trelawny. He insists that he told them nothing, and they bring him back to camp safely.\n\nLater on, Arthur is asked by Uncle if he wants to join a stagecoach robbery. Along with Charles and Bill, Arthur accepts the offer. Unfortunately for them, the stagecoach turns out to be owned by Cornwall, who has hired a small army of private mercenaries to protect the stagecoach. After robbing the stagecoach, the gang members are forced to flee to a nearby barn, where they attempt to hide. The hired guns, however, find them and light the barn on fire while opening fire on them at the same time. The men are forced to fight their way out of the barn and into the forest, where they engage some of Cornwall's men in combat before escaping back to camp.\n\nNot long after, Lenny approaches Arthur and tells him that after talking to some of the black community in Rhodes, he has learned that the Lemoyne Raiders have a large store of military-grade weapons stockpiled. Arthur agrees to rob the raiders, and he and Lenny ride to where Lenny's contacts said to go to. The two men see a coach coming by, and they follow it at a safe distance before coming upon Shady Belle. The two attack the manor, and after eliminating the Lemoyne Raiders there, take the coach and drive it away. Some other raiders attempt to intercept them but are vanquished by the two. After getting back to camp, Arthur claims a Bolt Action Rifle from the stash as his own and says they will sell the rest to get some more cash for the camp. Arthur can also take part in various robberies with other gang members, such as robbing a homestead with Sean, robbing a stagecoach with Sean and Mary-Beth, and another stagecoach with Bill and Tilly. Aside from this, he can go fishing with Kieran at some point, and later with Javier.\n\nAlmost immediately after returning, Bill and Karen Jones approach Lenny and Arthur and propose robbing the Valentine bank, which they have already collected information on. After a bit of prodding, he agrees, and the four ride to Valentine. Karen pretends to be either a lost girl or a harlot, and after confusing the guard, knocks him out. Arthur can then either place dynamite on the safes to blow the locks off, or silently crack them. On the way out, they are attacked by the law, but the four gang members succeed in fighting their way to safety. Afterward, Arthur rides to Downes Ranch, to get the money from Edith Downes that her husband owed.\n\nAt some point, the gang hears that the O'Driscolls have planned a truce meeting for Dutch and Colm. Although Hosea instantly sees it as a trap, Dutch agrees to check it out, after some persuasion from Micah. Arthur, who is also suspicious, accompanies them. He is sent to be a sniper on a cliff overlooking the meeting but is captured by the O'Driscolls and later imprisoned in their hideout, as well as being shot in the shoulder. Colm reveals himself to Arthur and says that they captured Arthur as a way of luring Dutch so that they could give him to the Pinkertons. After Colm leaves, Arthur cauterizes his wound and makes his escape back to camp, where he takes a few weeks to recover.\n\nThe gang will then decide that in order to get some more money for their stores, they will rob both the Braithwaites and the Grays. Arthur will first go with Sean, and the two will light the Gray's tobacco fields on fire using moonshine, in exchange for a significant sum of money from the Braithwaites. He will then go with John and Javier, and the two will go to Braithwaite manor, and steal the family's prized horses. Although they are told by Tavish Gray that they can sell the horses to a horse-fence for five-thousand in cash, this proves to be a lie and they end up with a measly seven-hundred. The gang is then told by the Grays to meet them at Rhodes for a potential job opportunity. Bill, Micah, and Sean go to Rhodes, shortly followed by Arthur, however, it turns out to be an ambush. Sean is shot dead almost immediately, and Bill is taken captive by the Sheriff. Micah and Arthur clear the street, before confronting Sheriff Gray and his deputies. Sheriff Gray exits his office holding Bill hostage, but is immediately shot and killed by Arthur, before deputies are then gunned down by Arthur and Micah. Afterwards, Arthur expresses his affection for Sean and asks Bill to give him a proper burial.\n\nUpon returning to camp, Arthur hears that the Braithwaites have taken Jack captive, in revenge for stealing their horses. A large posse of gang members attack Braithwaite Manor, and after a long fight take Catherine Braithwaite captive. After she refuses to reveal the location of Jack, they burn down her manor. She then reveals that her sons gave him to Angelo Bronte, an Italian crime lord living in Saint Denis, before running into her burning home as the gang leaves her. After returning to camp, Agents Milton and Ross appear once again with a proposition for Dutch to turn himself in, in exchange for the rest of the gang being allowed to flee and be pardoned. The offer is turned down and Milton leaves, promising to return with fifty men. The gang then quickly prepares to relocate to Shady Belle, which Lenny and Arthur had previously cleared of Lemoyne Raiders. John and Arthur will go to scope it out and kill the remaining Raiders. Once this is done, the gang will move into their new home.\n\nSaint Denis Chapter\n\nAfter relocating to Shady Belle, John, Dutch, and Arthur go to Saint Denis, to find out where Bronte lives. Arthur eventually learns he lives at a mansion near the river after chasing a street urchin that stole from him, and the trio goes to confront him. The three gang members enter the house, and after almost starting a gunfight with his men, they strike a deal: John and Arthur will deal with a group of grave-robbers, and in exchange, Bronte will give Jack back. The two men go the graveyard, and after being ambushed by the criminals, gun them down. They then grab their loot and escape before the law shows up. The two will return to Bronte with the loot, and Bronte will release Jack, after offering Dutch an invite to the Mayor's party.\n\nBill, Hosea, Arthur, and Dutch will arrive at the Mayor's party, and quickly break up so that they can pursue different leads. Arthur will hear a servant talking about Leviticus Cornwall, and after being prompted by Dutch, will follow him. Arthur will steal documents relating to him, before fleeing the mansion and meeting up with the rest of the gang. Although Bill complains that they have found no leads, Hosea will say he has a few, including a potential riverboat robbery involving a high stakes poker game, and even Lemoyne National Bank.\n\nAfter hearing about the riverboat tip, Trelawny decides to use it to their advantage. He pulls some strings and succeeds in getting Javier, Strauss, Arthur and himself on board as well as befriending the dealer to rig a poker game. While onboard, Javier manages to pose as a guard on the riverboat and Strauss finds a seat in Arthur's view. Arthur then gets into the poker game with Desmond Blythe and some others on the boat, and with Strauss's help in cheating, Arthur wins. After losing all of his money to Arthur, Blythe offers one final bet, in which he uses his Reutlinger pocket watch as credit. Arthur accepts Blythe's offer and beats him. The pit boss arrives and congratulates Arthur on his win, before escorting both him and Javier upstairs to the vault where the Reutlinger is located. After he opens up the vault, Javier and Arthur point their guns at him and tell him to surrender his hidden pistol. While Arthur loots the vault, the pit boss draws a second hidden gun, so Arthur is forced to shoot him. Unfortunately, the sound of the gunshot alerts the guards, who rush to see what happened. Arthur and Javier reunite with Strauss and Trelawny, but the guards discover that they were the culprits and attack them. After fighting off some of the guards, the group jump off the ship and swim to shore, where they divide the spoils.\n\nLater on, Arthur goes to talk to an Indian chief named Rains Fall. He finds him at Saint Denis, along with his son Eagle Flies. Rains Fall tells Arthur that the US Army plans on moving his tribe off of their land, and he has a proposition for him. He asks Arthur to steal incriminating documents from the Cornwall Refinery, which could potentially put a stop to their relocation. Arthur accepts, and later sneaks into the refinery using a wagon destined for the storage area. After forcing a man to give him the papers, he makes his escape. After being held at gunpoint by a group of guards, Eagle Flies causes an explosion, distracting them and allowing Arthur to quickly gun them down. The two escape together, after which Eagle Flies pays Arthur and says that he hopes that the documents will help.\n\nIn camp, Susan tells Arthur that Tilly has been kidnapped by the Foreman brothers and that they need to go and rescue her. They come across a safehouse and rescue Tilly, before setting off to find Anthony Foreman, the leader. After he is captured, he is brought back to Tilly, where the player is given a choice to either kill him or spare him, with Susan advocating the former, and Tilly the latter. No matter which option is chosen, Tilly will not be disturbed by the Foreman brothers ever again.\n\nSadie asks Arthur to talk and tells him that Kieran has disappeared and she is worried about him. Almost immediately after she has finished speaking, Kieran's decapitated body comes into camp and O'Driscolls assault the gang. The gang attempts to hold them off at the road, but are forced to retreat inside the plantation house. It is then that Dutch realizes that Sadie is outside, and is fighting for her life. Arthur charges out and kills the people attacking Sadie, but she refuses to go inside, preferring to avenge her husband. The two engage members of the enemy gang, and force the O'Driscolls to retreat.\n\nAt some point in this chapter, Arthur can join Micah in robbing a stagecoach, bringing Bill along. As well as this, he can also rob a stagecoach with Lenny, although it proves to be a setup. Additionally, Arthur can also go rustling with Uncle.\n\nDutch tells Arthur to come over and tells him that the two of them, as well as Lenny, are going to rob the Saint Denis trolley station after getting a tip from Angelo Bronte. The three break into the station and hold the clerks at gunpoint, before realizing that only ninety dollars are in the vault. The three then attempt to escape, but police are now everywhere. They board a trolley and use it to ride out of the city centre. The trolley eventually crashes, forcing the three to fight the policemen on foot. Eventually, they commandeer a stagecoach and ride to safety. Dutch then comments on how he thinks Lenny saved them, and Arthur gives them each fifteen dollars.\n\nLater, Arthur is contacted by Mary, who asks him to meet her in Saint Denis. Arthur does so, and Mary tells Arthur that she is very worried about her father, who is sinking ever deeper into whoring, drinking and gambling. Mary eventually encounters her father, who storms out soon after she begins talking to him. To find out what he’s doing, Mary and Arthur tail him, witnessing him vomit, and then meeting Ashton, who Mr. Gillis sells a brooch to. Recognizing it as a family heirloom from her mother, Mary confronts him about it while Arthur chases Ashton to get the brooch back. After retrieving the brooch, Arthur gives it to Mary and asks where her father went, to which Mary responds by saying that she doesn’t know and no longer cares. She then invites Arthur to go to the theatre with her, where the player can choose if they’d like to go or not. Afterwards, Mary asks Arthur to run away with her, but Arthur declines, saying that he is a wanted man which would only put her in danger, and that he has people to take care of. Realising that Arthur would never renounce the life of an outlaw, Mary says goodbye and the two part ways.\n\nBack at camp, Dutch asks Arthur to come to the balcony, and he tells him that he and Hosea can't agree on what to do next and that he is the tiebreaker. Dutch says that he wants to kill Angelo Bronte for tricking them, and says it will make robbing the bank easier. Hosea, meanwhile, says the plan is foolhardy, and will only endanger them. Arthur sides with Dutch and the two go to Lagras where they are going to broker a deal with a fisherman named Thomas. Dutch talks to him, and they agree that they will aid him in finding his assistant who has gone missing. In exchange, he will ferry the gang to Bronte's mansion. The three men find him in the swamp, bring him to the boat, and start rowing back to Lagras. Unfortunately, along the way, they are attacked by a massive alligator. He bites the young man's leg and throws him into the water. They pull him out, then shoot at the giant alligator, scaring it off, before returning to Lagras.\n\nWhen Arthur returns to Lagras, the gang boards Thomas's boat and make their way toward Angelo Bronte's mansion. Once there, the gang gets shot at and takes cover and opens fire on the guards positioned in the courtyard. Reinforcements arrive, but the gang secures the area, and approach the door. Arthur blasts the lock off of the door, and the gang begins clearing the rooms. Arthur goes upstairs and enters a room, only to be surprise attacked by the crime lord. After subduing Bronte, Arthur carries him downstairs, and they head toward the boat. Unfortunately, policemen hear the gunshots and arrive, forcing the gang to fight their way to the boat. Once on the boat, they set off to Lagras, planning on ransoming back Bronte. Bronte, however, believes that the gang will turn on Dutch for money. He offers thousands of dollars to whoever kills Dutch, and when no one takes him up on the offer, begins insulting Dutch. An enraged Dutch responds by drowning Bronte and then throwing his body overboard to be ravaged by alligators, shocking the rest of the gang.\n\nBack at camp, Dutch and Hosea finalize the plan for the robbing of the Saint Denis Bank. The gang readies and rides out the next morning, and on the ride, Dutch goes over the plan. Hosea and Abigail will cause a diversion to divert police away from the bank, while the rest of the gang will enter the bank's front doors. Once inside, Arthur loots the safe, when suddenly the Pinkertons arrive. The bank is completely surrounded, and Agent Milton calls for them to surrender, holding Hosea hostage. After refusing Dutch's pleads for negotiation, Milton shoots Hosea in the chest, killing him. The gang attacks the Pinkertons in full force and a shootout ensues. Dutch instructs Arthur to use dynamite to blow a hole through the side of the bank in order to create a path of escape. Arthur blows open the wall and makes his way to the rooftop, where he proceeds to lay down cover fire so the gang to make a run for it. The gang joins Arthur on the roof without John, who has been captured by the Pinkertons. As the group tries to escape on the roof, Lenny is gunned down by Pinkertons, and Arthur pauses a moment to mourn his fallen friend. The gang then make their way to an abandoned building where they wait until nightfall, before heading to the docks where they hope to find a boat to ferry them away. Unfortunately, the police have the area under heavy surveillance, and they cannot continue. Charles causes a distraction, allowing the rest of the gang to reach the dock. They then board a ship destined for Cuba, but the boat sinks and Arthur is separated from the rest of the gang.\n\nGuarma Chapter\n\nArthur washes up on the shore of Guarma and searches for civilization. He comes upon the gang at a campfire, but the reunion is cut short by the arrival of the local military, who arrest them and transport them in shackles to jail. Along the way to the jail, rebels bombard the soldiers with bullets. In the confusion, Arthur collects keys from a dead soldier's corpse and uses them to unlock the shackles. After killing off the guards leading them, Hercule Fontaine, the revolutionary leader tells the gang to follow him. As they rush away, Javier is shot in the leg by reinforcements, and they are forced to leave without him. Despite this, Hercule leads the remaining gang to a small rebel outpost, stocked with rifles. Reinforcements soon arrive, but the gang and Hercule are ultimately victorious. They then proceed to a church turned rebel outpost called La Capilla.\n\nAfter arriving at La Capilla, Arthur rests for a short time, before setting out to find a way off the island. One of the two things he does to get off the island is going with Dutch to rescue Javier. The two of them go to a cave where an old lady named Gloria is. Dutch pays her a gold ingot to lead them through the cave, up to a ladder that would bring them up to Aguasdulces. It is then that she demands more money, and when Dutch can't pay the rest of the promised money, she pulls a knife on him. Dutch then grabs her, and kills her, prompting dismay from Arthur. The two of them then enter Aguadulces, where they see Colonel Fussar and a group of soldiers, who are dragging Javier along with a donkey and beating him for information on who the gang are. The pair quickly begins looking for ways to find a distraction, which they find in the sugar refinery. Dutch cuts up the bags of sugar, spilling it all over the floor, before they blow up the furnace. In the distraction, they fight their way to Javier. After Dutch picks him up, they flee the settlement, until they reach the river of Arroyo de la Vibora. At the river, Arthur tells Dutch to take Javier while he holds the bank. Waves of enemies assault his position, but Arthur prevails and departs.\n\nArthur then goes and investigates a group of workers who have disappeared. Arthur is unfortunately captured, and imprisoned with two other militants. A guard approaches him and is about to beat him up when he attacks. Arthur swiftly slays the guard, and then with another militant sneak through the camp. They save three men from execution, before engaging and defeating the soldiers.\n\nAfter doing this, he goes with the gang to Cinco Torres. Here, they see a Cuban warship approaching, and swarms of enemies attacking. The gang and Hercule shoot at them from above, until they reach the fort. Hercule, Dutch, and Arthur then rush out and clear out the soldiers that are preparing to take the fort. They then rush back to the top of Cinco Torres and man the cannon as the warship approaches. After many shots, the warship falls, and they begin planning on making their escape off the island.\n\nThe gang is preparing to leave when they see a gun battery preventing their escape. Realizing it has to be silenced, the gang assaults the battery, and Arthur blows up the cannons. They then set out cutting their way to the ship. While fighting Aguasdulces, Arthur breaks into the worker's cabin to find the captain and is put on gunpoint by Levi Simon. Dutch breaks in, and puts Simon on gunpoint before Fussar aims his own gun at Dutch. The standoff ends when Arthur kicks the ship captain his rifle, and he kills Simon by shooting him in the chest. Fussar flees the cabin in the confusion and runs. They then set out fighting their way to the ship in earnest, when they find Fussar has occupied the final tower with a machine gun. Arthur blows down the tower, killing Fussar and allowing the gang to depart the island at last.\n\nArthur arrives at Van Horn Trading Post, where he steals a horse to return to Shady Belle. The site is abandoned when he gets there, but he finds a letter written by “Caroline” which says that they are at Lakay. As he prepares to head out, a group of Pinkertons arrives; Arthur either leaves silently and without alerting them or fights them. Regardless of his choice, he heads to Lakay immediately after. When he arrives, he finds the entire gang who weren't stranded on Guarma. They welcome him and Abigail informs Arthur of John’s imprisonment at Sisika Penitentiary before the rest of the gang arrive. However, their reunion is cut short by the arrival of Agent Milton and a group of Pinkerton agents who attack the camp, with the help of Sadie and Bill they repel the attack with the aid of the Gatling gun. Sadie then asks Arthur to meet her at some point in Saint Denis so they can brainstorm how best to break John out of prison.\n\nDutch orders Arthur to clear out an old hideout called Beaver Hollow, home to a group of cannibals called the Murfree Brood, Arthur brings Charles along, and Arthur tells Charles about Guarma while he tells Arthur about the scramble to flee to Lakay. Eventually, whether through canoe or horse riding, they eventually reach Beaver Hollow. The pair sneaks through the camp, quietly killing the enemies until the alarm is sounded. The two then forcibly storm the hollow and clear out all the enemies. In doing so, they find a young girl named Meredith, who had been captured and tortured by the Brood. Arthur takes her back to her mother in Annesburg, before returning to the Hollow where the rest of the gang has assembled. Drunk, Molly then stumbles into the camp and says that she was the rat, telling the Pinkertons about the Saint Denis Bank robbery. While the rest of the gang looks on shocked, Susan puts an end to her by peppering her with a shotgun.\n\nBeaver Hollow Chapter\n\nIf Arthur has high Honor: While in Annesburg, Arthur notices Edith Downes, the wife of the late Thomas Downes whom he contracted tuberculosis from. Arthur walks up to her and she becomes very angry at him, saying that it's his fault that her husband is dead and her son is working in the mines. Feeling horrible for what he did, Arthur brings Archie back from the mines and gives him some money to help rebuild their lives. Unfortunately, Edith does not want to leave and continues practicing prostitution to make money for the family. Arthur confronts her about this out in the woods and finally convinces her to leave town.\n\nArthur goes to Saint Denis to meet Sadie, but is seized by a violent coughing fit and collapses. A stranger escorts him to a clinic, and a doctor named Joseph R. Barnes diagnoses Arthur with tuberculosis, having contracted it from Thomas Downes several months earlier. Arthur is overcome with emotion at this news, as such an illness would mean certain death. The news shakes Arthur to his core and ultimately causes him to change and become a better man.\n\nArthur meets up with Sadie following his diagnosis. She says that she wants to survey the prison to make sure that John is actually there before launching a rescue attempt, and has paid a hot air balloon operator, Arturo Bullard, to give Arthur a tour. Arthur then uses the balloon to inspect Sisika Penitentiary to see if John is still there. He spots John working field detail and the guard opens fire, forcing them to leave. When they reach the mainland, Arthur spots Sadie being chased by a group of O'Driscolls and opens fire upon them from the balloon. Bullard is shot and killed by the rival gang, and the balloon crashes. Arthur and Sadie then engage the assailants in a bloody gunfight in which they are victorious.\n\nArthur then heads to the docks at Copperhead Landing, located a few miles from Sisika Penitentiary, to help Sadie break John out of prison. Abigail protests that she should come, but Sadie and Arthur shut her down saying that she would be an extra burden. Abigail reluctantly accepts this and thanks them for what they are doing, before Arthur and Sadie sail and dock along the islands shore. The pair climb a watchtower that overlooks the fields, and take down the guard in the tower, before opening fire and killing two other guards in the fields. They take a prison guard named Milliken captive, and Milliken tells them that John is not working that day. With Milliken hostage, they march up to the main gate of the fortress and tell them that they want to trade John for the guard. They make the trade, and the three flee the island with enemy guards hot in pursuit.\n\nArthur is called on by Dutch and Micah to go help them confront Cornwall in Annesburg. They hide in the harbor, near to where Cornwall is expected to arrive. Dutch waits with Arthur, while Micah is sent to follow one of Cornwall's aides. After hearing Cornwall talking to the Pinkertons, Dutch reveals himself. He demands that Cornwall give him $10,000, his boat, and safe passage out of the country. Cornwall refuses, and Dutch shoots him in the chest, killing him. Pinkertons and hired guns swarm the gang, and the three men narrowly fight their way out of town. During the operation, Micah manages to steal papers from the Cornwall company, which he and Dutch keep so that they might make plans.\n\nArthur eventually heads to Saint Denis with Sadie and Dutch to ensure Colm is hanged. Arthur and Dutch disguise themselves as police officers and Sadie disguises herself as a lady of high society, all to lessen the chances of them being recognized. They find two O'Driscolls in the crowd and realize that there is a sniper on top of the building. Arthur eliminates the sniper, Dutch and Sadie capture the O'Driscolls, and with no one left to save him from the noose, Colm is hanged. Sadie then kills both her hostage and Dutch's in a fit of rage, leading to a shootout. After the O'Driscolls are dealt with, Dutch and Sadie return to Beaver Hollow, followed by Arthur.\n\nArthur receives a letter from Mary, which says that she wishes to cut ties with him, as it is the only way she can move on, while expressing regret that they could never be together. As well as sending Arthur a letter, she also sends him back his wedding ring. Mary was, however, unaware that Arthur was terminally ill with Tuberculosis and that he would die soon.\n\nThe papers that Micah stole reveal a large shipment of dynamite being transported from Annesburg to Saint Denis, so Bill and Arthur are sent to intercept it and take it for the gang. They go to Van Horn Trading Post and set up an ambush: Bill plays drunk in the middle of the road and Arthur positions himself afar so that he may act as a sniper. When the stagecoach stops, the two open fire on the guards and seize the carriage. Waves of hired guns pursue them, but the pair manage to fend them off and escape with their lives. Once they get to safety, Micah instructs John to take the dynamite to Bacchus Bridge, and then asks Arthur to join him there later on to set up the dynamite.\n\nArthur is also tasked by Strauss to go after two debtors: a deserter from Fort Wallace named J. John Weathers, and Arthur Londonderry, a miner. Arthur first goes after Weathers, who offers supplies from the wagon to pay off his debt, only to be attacked by soldiers who were after him. Arthur is forced to help Weathers defend the wagon, but the wagon is set alight by a lantern and destroyed. After killing the soldiers, Arthur sees Weathers lead a Wapiti Indian woman who he is in a relationship with and sees the situation they’re in. Weather’s offers a locket for the debt, leaving Arthur with the choice of accepting it or absolving the debt. Arthur then goes after Londonderry, only to find out that he has died. Arthur then goes after the widow looking for the money, but after finding her and seeing that she and her son are destitute, Arthur can choose to either absolve the debt, or do that in addition to giving Mrs. Londonderry some money to live on.\n\nArthur returns to camp, angry at the suffering Strauss had caused. He tells Strauss to get up and takes him over to where his belongings are. Confused at what Arthur is doing, Strauss protests, but Arthur ignores his attempts at reconciliation. He throws money at Strauss' feet and orders him to leave, which Strauss does.\n\nArthur meets with John by Bacchus Bridge, and the two blow it up in order to cut off the government supplies. This endeavor almost costs them their lives, as they are almost struck by the train. Afterwards, John tells Arthur that he is afraid for his family due to Dutch's descent into madness. Arthur tells John that he agrees, and John tells him that Abigail thinks that she knows where the money is. Arthur tells him to investigate further and talk to him afterwards.\n\nEagle Flies rides into Beaver Hollow and tells the gang that the army stationed at Fort Wallace has taken their horses, and he needs help to get them back. Dutch, seeing an opportunity to damage the government, agrees. He calls for Charles and Arthur to follow him, the two worry seeing Dutch take advantage considering Dutch’s recent changes in behavior and the four men ride east, where they plan on stealing horses from a government ferry. The four of them swim to the boat, sneak on board, and knock out the guards. They then grab the horses and flee back to shore. After reaching the shore, Eagle Flies and Dutch take the horses back to the reservation, while Arthur goes to meet Rains Fall.\n\nArthur reaches the reservation and meets Rains Fall. After the Indian chief realizes that Arthur has tuberculosis, he tells him that he has some things that could ease the pain and they go riding out onto the mountain looking for the herbs. While traveling, a man named Captain Monroe asks for his help, and Arthur pledges to help him. After gathering up all the herbs, the two go to a sacred place to the Wapiti, only to find it burned and its sacred objects were gone. After realizing that it was the Army's doing, Arthur sneaks into the camp, steals the objects back, and gives them to Rains Fall, who thanks him. The two then return to camp and separate.\n\nArthur goes and meets up with Monroe, who shows him a young child who has caught smallpox, due to Colonel Favours stopping a shipment of vaccines from reaching the reservation. Disgusted by this, Arthur demands that Monroe show him where the shipment is traveling. He then rides after the wagon carrying the vaccines and steals them back. He then returns to the reservation with the supplies and gives them to Monroe.\n\nAt the order of Dutch, Arthur meets up with him and a group of Indians led by Paytah and Eagle Flies. Dutch tells him that they plan on trapping the soldiers in the canyon to tar and feather them. However, Arthur sees that Dutch is simply using them and not helping them. He tries to dissuade Dutch from being involved, only to be disappointed when Dutch brushes off his concerns. Reluctantly, Arthur gets to work; he and Dutch place dynamite next to the trees and wait for the soldiers to arrive. When they do, Dutch pushes the detonator and the trees collapse, blocking the road. The group demands that the soldiers surrender, but Army reinforcements arrive and swarm the would-be ambushers. Arthur, Dutch, and the Indians fight their way down the pass, but the majority of the Indians are killed or captured, forcing Arthur and Dutch to run. They flee to the top of a cliff, and after being surrounded by the army, jump to the safety of the waters below.\n\nFollowing the capture of Eagle Flies, a meeting is called between Colonel Favours and Rains Fall. Rains Fall asks Arthur and Charles to come along, and Arthur agrees due to pleading from Charles. During the meeting, Arthur breaks out in a fit of coughing and has to take a break in a tent. In the tent, he hears that Favours plans on executing Monroe, and puts himself on his guard. After the meeting breaks down, Favours arrests Monroe and announces his plans to execute him. Charles and Arthur attack, grab him and flee. They hide behind a rock and defeat the army in a long battle, before taking the captain to Emerald Station.\n\nCharles and Arthur learn that Eagle Flies is being held at Fort Wallace, and decide to break him out. They cross the river and ride up the fort, where they wait until night. They then slay several sentries silently with bows, before climbing the back wall with a rope. They then slay several guards on the walls, before attacking the army and fighting their way into the jail. After releasing Eagle Flies, they blow a hole in the back wall and run to canoes lying along the river. Although soldiers attempt to shoot them out of the canoes, they succeed in escaping the area, and Charles brings Eagle Flies back to his father.\n\nEagle Flies shows up at Beaver Hollow with a large force of warriors from the reservation and tells the gang that the army raided the reservation. He then asks for the gangs to help in destroying the Cornwall company refinery in retaliation. It is then that Rains Fall rides in, and begs for his tribe not to go to war. They instead ride off, leaving the gang behind. After a quick discussion, the majority of the gang follows. When they arrive at the scene, they see many that many of the Wapiti Indians have been killed. Arthur soon spots Eagle Flies, and the gang splits into two groups – with Arthur leading a force to rescue Eagle Flies. They succeed in rescuing Eagle Flies, and then meet up with Dutch's force near the warehouse. After fighting to the warehouse doors, Dutch and Arthur enter, and take the government bonds. As they leave, however, a pipe bursts, which incapacitates Arthur. Immediately afterwards, more soldiers arrive, while Dutch leaves Arthur to die. Just before he can be killed by the soldiers, however, Eagle Flies appears and kills the soldiers in rapid succession, only to be fatally shot in the abdomen by Colonel Favours himself. Favours then turns towards Arthur to kill him too, but Arthur manages to shoot and kill him first. He then exits the warehouse, and after a brief exchange with Dutch over the latter abandoning him, Arthur takes Eagle Flies back to the reservation with Charles and Paytah. When they reach the reservation, Eagle Flies succumbs to his wounds, while Arthur says goodbye to Charles, who stays with the Indians to help them escape the Army. Soon after leaving the reservation, Arthur suffers from a second, severe coughing fit and falls into unconsciousness. Luckily for him, the German family who he had helped earlier that year find him and take him to Annesburg, where Arthur regains consciousness.\n\nDutch announces to the gang that they are pulling off one more big heist, before leaving the country. He tells them that they are going to rob an Army train going through Saint Denis, containing payroll and supplies to repair Bacchus Bridge. They ride to Saint Denis, but the train goes right through the city and so they are forced to go in pursuit of it. After boarding the train, swarms of enemies assault the gang, and although Arthur fights them off, John is shot in the left shoulder after uncoupling a burning train carriage. Dutch says that he will rescue him, and goes after him while the rest of the gang eliminate the final soldiers guarding the train and take the loot. After this, Dutch appears and tells him that John had died, leaving Arthur saddened.\n\nAs they return, they come across Tilly, who says that Abigail has been captured. Dutch and Micah decide to leave her, followed by the others. Refusing to leave his old friend to die and have Jack become an orphan, Arthur and Sadie go to Van Horn where she is being held. Arthur covers Sadie from a lighthouse while she fights her way through the town, but after reaching the building where Abigail is being held, she is ambushed by two Pinkertons and captured. Arthur then fights his way through the town to rescue her and kills the guards who she was ambushed by, only to be held at gunpoint by Agent Milton. Milton tells him that Micah betrayed the gang and fed information to the Pinkertons since his return from Guarma, before being locked in a struggle with Arthur. Suddenly, Abigail shoots Milton in the temple with Sadie’s revolver, killing him and saving Arthur. Arthur takes Abigail back to Tilly and Jack, and tells them to leave with Sadie, while he confronts Micah. Before she leaves, Abigail gives Arthur the keys to Dutch's money stash and tells him where to find the money before saying goodbye.\n\nArthur walks into camp, and announces that Micah is the traitor, which results in Micah and Arthur drawing on each other. At first, no one is willing to take sides, until John stumbles into camp saying that Dutch left him to die. Susan also sides with Arthur, and threatens Micah with a shotgun. Unfortunately for her, Javier announces that Pinkertons are coming, distracting her and allowing Micah to kill her. The rest of the gang unites behind Dutch and Micah, but Pinkertons arrive before Arthur and John can be killed by the others. Arthur and John escape through the cave, where Arthur reveals to him that Micah is the rat. After reaching the surface Arthur tells John that his family are safe at Copperhead Landing, and tells him to make a good life for him and his family with second chance he has before they are forced to escape into the woods, with Dutch and the others on their tail, exclaiming that John and Arthur are traitors. Eventually, Arthur and John have their horses shot from under them, forcing them to go on foot after killing Pinkerton attackers. Arthur then has a difficult choice to make: he can either return for the money or assist John's escape.\n\nIf Arthur helps John to escape: Arthur continues on with John and the two head towards the mountains. Eventually, Arthur tells John to continue alone while he holds off the Pinkertons, before giving him his hat and belongings. John reluctantly parts ways with Arthur, while the latter is attacked by Micah; both men fall from a ledge onto the ground below, and subsequently engage in a fistfight. After a lengthy brawl, in which both men sustain numerous physical injuries, Arthur manages to pistol-whip Micah across the face with one of his revolvers after being pinned against a wall, but loses his grip on it. Arthur then crawls towards this revolver in order to kill Micah, but is ultimately prevented from doing so by Dutch. Arthur tells Dutch again that Micah is the rat, that he gave him everything, and that John is the only one who made it, while Micah picks up another of his revolvers from the ground and prompts Dutch to come with him and get the money. In the end, Dutch discontentedly walks away, abandoning both Arthur and Micah.\n\nHigh Honor: After Dutch abandons him, Micah angrily walks away from the area, leaving Arthur to die. Arthur then crawls to the edge of the cliff and witnesses his final sunrise as he passes away, succumbing to his tuberculosis, his injuries, and exhaustion.\n\nLow Honor: Instead of fleeing after Dutch walks away, Micah approaches Arthur and aims a revolver at his head, vengefully claiming that Arthur is not better than him. Micah then shoots Arthur in the forehead, killing him instantly, before laughing, spitting on his corpse, and leaving.\n\nIf Arthur goes back for the money: Arthur gives John his hat and belongings and leaves John to flee by himself, before fighting his way back to the gang's camp, where he manages to find the sack of money in Dutch's chest inside the cavern. As he exits the caves, he is suddenly attacked by Micah and stabbed in the side with his own knife. After wrestling Micah off him and taking back his knife, Micah takes out his own blade and the two engage in a knife fight.\n\nHigh Honor: Eventually, Arthur manages to slash Micah's left eye, blinding it. Enraged, Micah tackles Arthur to the ground and tries to stab him, but to no avail, as Arthur bites Micah's hand and punches him in the face, forcing him off. Dutch arrives to break it up but, after Arthur re-iterates that Micah betrayed the gang, Dutch decides to abandon both of them, despite Micah dismissing the claim as \"nonsense\". Micah then leaves, taking the sack of money which Arthur took from the chest. Arthur is left to die, and watches the sunrise shortly before he succumbs to his Tuberculosis, his initial stab wound, and exhaustion.\n\nLow Honor: Instead of slashing Micah‘s left eye during the fight, Arthur loses his balance and is tackled to the ground. Micah manages to stab Arthur in the chest during the struggle before Dutch arrives to break it up. Arthur says again that Micah is the rat and demands that Dutch kill him, but Dutch walks away. Arthur then begins to crawl away, but Micah approaches him with a knife in hand and finishes Arthur off by stabbing him in the back.\n\nDepending on how Arthur died, a deer basking in the sunlight (High Honor) or a coyote in the rain (Low Honor) is seen, while the song \"Crash of Worlds\" by Rocco DeLuca plays in the background (its tone differs according to Honor). At some point after his death, Arthur's body was found by Charles Smith, who buried him in a beautiful location facing the evening sun, the way he would have wanted. The grave can be found in Ambarino, northeast of Bacchus Bridge.\n\nEpilogue\n\n“ He did save us, yeah. None of us would be here today if it weren't for Arthur. „ —Abigail Marston to Jack Marston\n\nArthur's attempt in giving Marston a second chance in life proved fruitful as, eight years later, John and his family manage to buy land in Beecher's Hope to live a new life as ranchers.\n\nYears after Arthur's death, Mary is seen visiting his grave, mourning his loss, as well as an eagle or a coyote, depending on his honor.\n\nArthur's death is avenged in 1907 when John, Sadie and Charles manage to track down Micah and his gang at Mount Hagen. Micah gets his comeuppance and is jointly killed by John and Dutch for betraying the Van der Linde gang to the Pinkertons. Ironically, John's act of hunting down Micah and avenging Arthur's death ultimately leads to Edgar Ross kidnapping his family and his own death four years later.\n\nAfter the player has reached 100% completion, a short cutscene plays where John visits Arthur's grave. John will be shown completing Arthur's journal while uttering the words \"Guess we're just about done, my friend\" before the cutscene transitions back to normal gameplay.\n\nCharacter\n\nPersonality\n\n“ There's a good man within you, Arthur, but he is wrestling with a giant. „ —Mary Linton to Arthur Morgan in her letter\n\nArthur Morgan is a cold, brooding outlaw who often resorts to violence and has very few qualms about killing. At his worst Arthur could be extremely ruthless and completely unsympathetic to the people he hurts. Despite being capable of committing such violence, Arthur does have a playful side to his personality that comes out around those he is friendly with. He isn't above joking or employing sarcasm with his friends. Notably Arthur was kind and polite to John Marston's then-four-year-old son, Jack, having a gentle demeanor around the young boy in contrast to his threatening persona.\n\nDespite his ability to commit great acts of violence Arthur has his own moral code and doesn't believe in what he deems as unnecessary killing, especially if it endangers himself or those he cares about. Dutch also raised Arthur to believe that revenge is a fruitless endeavor. It seems that Arthur strictly believes that violence should be cold, necessary and without feeling, never out of personal enjoyment or without reason.\n\nArthur cannot be bought, bullied or intimidated, regardless of an antagonist's size, strength, wealth or power. He is fully self-aware of his imposing nature and the effect that his own force of intimidation can have on others. Although Arthur demonstrates time after time that he fears no man, he does fear for the safety of those he cares about. Supremely confident in his ability to handle any situation or overcome any adversary, Arthur rarely shows any hesitation and will engage in combat even when outnumbered. Despite Arthur's usual bravery and calm demeanor, he does display a rare moment of fear when he confides in Sister Calderón, revealing to her that he is afraid of his own impending death as a result of his terminal illness.\n\nIn his own terms Arthur is aware that he is a “bad man” and clearly understands that his behavior is morally wrong, though he justifies his own actions as being different from most criminals, as the Van der Linde gang carries a philosophy that Arthur genuinely believed could help people. As time went on however, Arthur realized this philosophy was a ruse or an \"excuse\", as John Marston would later put it.\n\nArthur's degradation of faith in Dutch caused him to go through an existential crisis. Because Dutch had raised Arthur since he was a young teen, his philosophy was primarily the only thing Arthur ever believed in up until the gang’s downfall. As the gang fell apart, Arthur realized that social issues were more complex than he had ever thought, and that these issues were beyond the gang's ability to control. Perhaps most disturbing to Arthur was seeing how easily Dutch could influence younger, disenfranchised men such as Eagle Flies to commit acts of violence for him. Undoubtedly this gave Arthur a new perspective on his own childhood and how Dutch had been taking advantage of him.\n\nWith his faith in Dutch and the Van der Linde gang crushed, and learning that he is terminally ill with tuberculosis, Arthur gained insight into his own feelings, opening up to Rains Fall about traumatic experiences including the death of his own son, Isaac. He also said how his terminal diagnosis made him see the world \"more clearly\", telling Mary-Beth that the world seemed \"better, almost\". In the end, one of Arthur's last objectives was to protect John Marston's family, and to secure Dutch’s hidden money for them in order to hopefully build a better life for themselves, making all the suffering that the gang had gone through worth something in the end. Regardless of Arthur's honor, the gang's decline, Dutch’s descent into madness, and learning of his own imminent doom, Arthur sought to secure a future for the people he cared about; a future he could never live to see but one he could guarantee.\n\nRegarding Arthur's general attitude, he is stoic and humble, and never feels a need to prove himself to other members of the gang. Arthur has, in various forms and for various reasons, been called an \"idiot\" and a \"fool\" by others, but often brushes off these criticisms. The only criticisms that seem to affect Arthur are from Mary Linton, his former lover. Though he often kept his complicated, mixed feelings about his past with her to himself, Arthur quietly pondered what his life could have been like had he and Mary stayed together.\n\nArthur is cunning and rather intelligent, and demonstrates more self-awareness than almost everyone else in the gang, allowing him to maintain his cool demeanor, especially under pressure, and not fall under the weight of vindicating himself.\n\nUnlike most people during the time period, Arthur is quite progressive in his views concerning women and minorities. He is seen to be disgusted by racism and has no qualms with the women doing work traditionally associated with men. Regarding his religious beliefs, Arthur mentions that he's irreligious, but he does appear to believe in some form of afterlife.\n\nArthur's honor can affect his overall personality as a whole; with high honor Arthur can be seen as a selfless person who will think of others and more practically about situations, such as when he realized that the gang was fighting for an idea that didn't work anymore, and how he realized that the women and Jack would surely die if he didn’t help them leave the gang. With low honor Arthur can be seen as a selfish person thinking of himself solely, such as caring about his own survival, even prioritizing revenge on Micah and getting the gang's money stash over helping John and his family.\n\nAppearance\n\n“ There was a feller I used to see with you, few years back. He was... tall... and a moody face? „ —Joe Butler to John Marston\n\nAs seen in an old photograph on Arthur's wagon, before 1899, Arthur was seen as a young man wearing a brown vest and trousers with a bandana around his neck.\n\nAs of 1899, Arthur is approximately 36 years of age, with a muscular build perfect for his position, with a head of thick, light brown hair and blue eyes. He also has a scar near his chin, which leaves a bald patch visible in his beard around level 2 and 3.\n\nArthur's physical appearance can be influenced by the player. The player can choose his hair style, clothing, and cleanliness.\n\nPlayers must also take basic care of Arthur, which in turn influences his weight. A healthy Arthur will retain his stocky appearance. Over-feeding him will lead to weight gain, giving him more health but limiting his stamina, while neglecting nutrition will thin Arthur out, negatively affecting his health but increasing his stamina.\n\nDuring his time on Guarma, Arthur's face becomes red and sunburnt, with both his hair and beard growing progressively longer as there is no way to shave or cut his hair. Arthur is also underweight, due to a lack of food, and he only wears one outfit, the remnants of the suit he wore during the Saint Denis bank heist.\n\nAfter returning from Guarma, Arthur's health takes a turn for the worse as his tuberculosis progresses. He looks increasingly sickly and his face becomes pale, with his eyes becoming watery and red in the corners; he also develops eye bags, as a result of constant coughing. Arthur also loses his muscular appearance and becomes extremely thin. Once his sickness worsens, Arthur becomes permanently underweight, and cannot return to a healthy weight through any means.\n\nRelationships\n\nMain article: Arthur Morgan/Relationships\n\nAs Arthur is the protagonist of the game, he has relationships with important characters related to him in the game. Arthur can partake various relationships throughout his life as an outlaw especially within the Van der Linde gang or outside of it.\n\nMission appearances\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2\n\nAs the protagonist, he appears in all missions until the end of Chapter 6. His voice can be heard immediately after either \"Fatherhood, for Idiots\" or \"Jim Milton Rides, Again?\".\n\nSkills\n\n“ Well, he's surely big but his intelligence is a matter of some conjecture. „ —Hosea Matthews facetiously describing Arthur.\n\nOne of the Van der Linde gang's most prominent members, Arthur is Dutch's strongest, most reliable, and most versatile disciple. Dedicated and commanding a broad skill set, he is always willing and able to do whatever is needed in a given situation to help the gang as a whole or its individual members.\n\nArthur is widely regarded by allies and foes alike as the single-most dangerous member of the Van der Linde gang, and he is recognized and feared as its primary enforcer. By 1899, his reputation is such that fellow gang members and enemies regularly comment on his ability and stature in the gang. On multiple occasions, he is the target of attempted ambush, assassination, capture, or bribery, with Pinkerton and rival gang leaders hoping to eliminate him or turn him against Dutch and the gang.\n\nHis proficiency, versatility, and ferocity, combined with his natural strength and toughness, prove him to be a peerless combatant. From antiques such as the Volcanic Pistol to modern Mauser Pistols, his competency with a variety of weapons and fighting styles in itself makes Arthur an invaluable asset. Arthur is seen to be one of the gang's best gunslingers, if not the best, rivaling if not surpassing Micah. Furthermore, along with Charles, he is the best melee fighter in the gang. One of the most notable displays of Arthur's physical dominance comes during the infamous Valentine bar brawl. Here, in a matter of minutes, he rescues Bill and Javier, knocks out three opponents in succession, and single-handedly defeats the colossal Tommy (reputedly the town's toughest resident) by nearly beating him to death, even after being defenestrated. This incident in itself establishes a lasting reputation of formidability for Arthur in the town.\n\nEven when afflicted with advanced tuberculosis, and near death, Arthur is still able to hold his own against Micah, leaving him with a severe beating or, if Arthur's honor is high, blinded in one eye. Although occasionally susceptible to surprise, when fully healthy he scarcely encounters a physical contest that he cannot overcome or, if necessary, escape. He repeatedly leads Van der Linde gang members in defeating vastly numerically superior forces of law agents, soldiers, and rival gang members.\n\nArthur's skills go beyond those purely necessary for physical confrontation, however. A skilled interrogator, he proves capable of using not only intimidation and force but also charm and charisma in order to elicit payment and information. He often displays a working knowledge of - or quick ability to learn - how to operate machinery or transportation, including steam locomotives. Although there is no evidence that he ever received any formal training or education, his journal entries demonstrate a natural talent for writing and art.\n\nAlthough Arthur is usually humble about his mental prowess, he is in many ways quite intelligent. He consistently demonstrates strong leadership, a cunning aptitude for strategy, and an accurate intuition for how plans will succeed or fail. He also proves to be a keen judge of character, often correctly assessing the actual intentions, deceptions, and capabilities of those around him. Hosea remarks that he believes Arthur's modesty hides a sharp mind that is far more acute and observant than Arthur tends to convey. Furthermore, Arthur's temperament is another key asset. He rarely loses his cool and prioritizes the situation at hand rather than get caught up by his emotions. This is demonstrated multiple times when he witnesses friends being killed, or himself betrayed, but carries on dealing with whatever tasks he has. However, Arthur is willing to show his ruthlessness when necessary, quickly putting down people who try to threaten or insult him. This leads to him being seen as an imposing and intimidating figure.\n\nArthur demonstrates an enormous capacity to acquire wealth and material for the Van der Linde gang through hunting, scavenging, fishing, crafting, gambling, robbing, looting, loan collecting, and various other means. The gang's ledger serves as ample testimony to Arthur’s resourcefulness, as he can prove able and willing to produce far greater quantities of money, food, medicine, herbs, pelts, stolen items, contraband, and other goods for the gang than all other gang members combined.\n\nArthur is proficient in wilderness survival. Though he claims that he never got the hang of shooting a bow during a conversation with Charles, he nonetheless picks up the skill quite quickly. His time riding with the gang has taught him how to live on the fringes of society. Arthur is able to track, hunt and skin animals with the skill of a seasoned outdoorsman. Unlike John, he is also a skilled herdsman, being able to round up and lead multiple animals such as a flock of sheep with ease. Arthur also knows how to swim, and is a master equestrian.\n\nDead Eye Targeting\n\nLike other protagonists in the Red Dead series, Arthur can use the trademark Dead Eye ability to slow time to a crawl and carefully pick out shots to cripple or kill his enemies. Unlike previous entries, Arthur's use of the ability is also capable of pinpointing critical areas of the target as the player levels up the skill.\n\nEagle Eye\n\nIntroduced in Red Dead Redemption 2 as a representation of Arthur's well-developed survivalist skills, this new gameplay mechanic highlights animal tracks, objectives, and other points of interest, allowing the player to track targets effectively over long distances.\n\nQuotes\n\nMain article: Arthur Morgan/Quotes\n\n\"Where's our money!?\" – Morgan to Thomas Downes, https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/File:RDR_2_Arthur_Morgan_WheresOurMoney.ogg\n\n\"Always, Dutch.\" – Morgan to Dutch on having his back, https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/File:RDR_2_Arthur_Morgan_AlwaysDutch.ogg\n\n\"Listen to me.

We can only move on. „ —Arthur to John Marston; a line Arthur remembers during \"A Fork in the Road\", if his Honor is high\n\nTrivia\n\nArthur is Rob Wiethoff's (who portrays John Marston) favorite character.[11]\n\nIn the \"PLAYER\" menu, Arthur and John have different descriptions under \"Wellbeing\". Arthur's description says \"Sickness can not be easily cured\". John's says the same, with the addition of \"John will not get sick\".\n\nDespite seeming to be the protagonist of the story, Arthur wears a black hat, which is normally associated with the villain in old western stories, while Micah, who is depicted as the antagonist, wears a white hat, which is usually associated with the hero of such stories. This reflects the more conventional view of the outlaws being evil and the law being good, and also foreshadows Micah's betrayal.\n\nAccording to Agent Milton, Arthur has amassed a $5,000 bounty with the US Government, which is equivalent to roughly $150,000 in today’s currency.[12]\n\nArthur may be of Welsh ancestry, as both his forename and surname have Welsh origins. Sean MacGuire makes fun of this, constantly calling Arthur \"English\", asking him about his parents' history, and generally needling him over Wales' historically close ties with England. Although Arthur is generally indifferent to Sean's teasing and does not correct it, in one missable interaction at camp, he tries to push back on the claim, replying \"my family weren't even English\" when Sean addresses him as \"the proud English man.\"\n\nFurthermore, the name of Arthur's former horse, Boadicea, is strikingly similar to that of a Celtic queen who battled the Romans in Wales. Arthur's grave is also the only one with a Celtic cross on it.\n\nWhen replaying missions from chapters 1 to 6, Arthur will always wear his default Gunslinger Outfit, with the collar closed unless changed (with the exception of missions in Colter, which will see him wear his winter shotgun jacket, and missions in Guarma, where he wears his Guarma clothes), as well as the Tennessee Walker acquired during the mission \"Outlaws from the West\". Arthur will also have his default level 3 hairstyle and level 3 facial hair. Additionally, some rare weapons, such as Midnight's Pistol and Otis Miller's Revolver, are available for him to use.\n\nDespite Arthur not being able to enter New Austin via legitimate means, players can use glitches to get him there. Arthur still has unique drawings for points of interest, as well as voice lines and interactions with specific characters in New Austin that can still be triggered, indicating that it was originally possible for Arthur to travel to New Austin at some point in development.\n\nWhen playing as John in 1907, Arthur's grave is available to visit after the mission \"Simple Pleasures\". Arthur’s level of Honor will affect the overall look of his grave; if Arthur had high honor, his tombstone will be clean and flowers will be around his grave. Contrarily, if Arthur had low honor, his tombstone is more weathered and no flowers are seen.\n\nAdditionally, if Arthur had high honor, the writing on his tombstone will be “Blessed Are Those Who Hunger And Thirst For Righteousness”, whereas if Arthur had low honor, his tombstone will instead say “Blessed Are Those Who Mourn For They Will Be Comforted”.\n\nBoth quotes come from the biblical \"Sermon on the Mount\"; John's epitaph comes from the same speech.\n\nDuring Chapters 5 and 6, Arthur loses his stocky appearance, instead becoming underweight and sickly-looking. However, if players make Arthur eat too much and make him overweight, he will gain his overweight appearance, which only disappears if players change outfits.\n\nThis was changed in a update however, and after \"A Fork in the Road\" he will only gain the benefits from eating a limited amount of food, with a message (You are sick. While sick, you will only gain the benefit from consuming a limited amount of food and drink.) appearing if the player attempts to over eat, and the player will have to wait for several in-game hours before Arthur will benefit from eating again. However, he will still suffer the core drain from consuming cigarettes and liquor, but won't get any benefit, after the message has been shown.\n\nIn \"The Veteran\", Arthur mentioning that he was born somewhere in the northern United States which may be a reference to his actor Roger Clark being born in New Jersey, which is in the northeast United States.\n\nA further reference to Clark's birthplace of New Jersey is stated in \"Favored Sons\", when Arthur tells Dutch that one of the fallen U.S. Army soldiers they are looting is \"some poor fool from New Jersey.\"\n\nArthur's actor, Roger Clark, cites Japanese filmmaker Toshiro Mifune,[13] actor John Wayne,[14] the persona of professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin,[15] and Rob Wiethoff's portrayal of John Marston in the original Red Dead Redemption as influences for his acting as Arthur.[16]\n\nThe story contains an explicit reference to the legend of King Arthur, which Jack Marston mentions reading in the epilogue mission \"The Wheel.\" John Marston talks about liking the names in the story, and gives Jack the nickname \"Lancelot.\" Arthur's last name could also be seen as a reference to King Arthur's greatest enemy Morgan le Fay. Some scholars have described the Western genre as emerging out of early Knight-errant literature. This allusion presents an obvious thematic connection between the Knights of the Round Table and the Van der Linde gang, both groups of violent men attempting to live by a moral code. Many versions of Arthurian legend focus on King Arthur struggling to keep Camelot together while it crumbles due to in-fighting, paralyzed by his own decency.\n\nArthur's time of death carries some symbolism in itself, as he was raised by the leader of the gang and eventually died not long after its disbanding, as he gave the gang all the formidable years of his life. His death in 1899 also has its own meanings; as his values and ideas are not fit for the 20th century world, which is stated by Micah during the final mission when he said \"Arthur's been dead a long time, this is a new century.\"\n\nTwo of the spirit animals that Arthur sees differ depending on his Honor.\n\nIf Arthur's Honor is high, he sees a beautiful buck in the sunlight, often seen in the golden sunshine. According to the entry on \"Deer Symbolism & Meaning\" on the compendium \"World Birds\" by Garth C. Clifford, there are a great number of symbolic meanings that are attributed to deer. In China, the deer is a sign of good luck, happiness, longevity, and fortune. In Christianity, \"The deer biblical meaning, because of deer characteristics like simplicity and innocence, symbolizes the Faithful. It is often represented as stooping to drink from the four rivers of the Evangelists, the rivers of the Gospel, and so typifies those desirous of baptism\" (which can explain the buck drinking from streams in Arthur's visions). In Celtic symbolism, the deer of the Haltstatt period \"became an object of ownership and sacrifice\" (which is why Arthur selflessly gives his life to help John and his family escape the Van der Linde gang), and the animal \"was the symbol of the Celtic God Cernunnos – Deer God – who had antlers\"; it is often added that \"Among the Gauls, the deer is the lord of the Animals. The deer antler symbolism represents the trees and it also became symbolic of abundance, fertility, [and] renewal.\" In dreams such as Arthur's, a deer \"tells you to walk gently on this Earth in balance, and beauty, and in honor of everything and everyone around you. The deer symbolism is that you must be kind to nature and respect her and honor the abundance we have around us. Treat everyone and everything as our equal; treat others the way we ourselves want to be treated.\" It is said that dreaming of deer and bucks \"means you must be mindful of your actions\", that the animal is symbolic of letting go of control, and that \"Deer antler symbolism is linked to renewal, rebirth, and hope, as they shed and reform every year\", as it is often indicated to him that beneath the bad things \"paradise awaits\" and that \"It's only in dying that we live\" (a foreshadowing of the final vision in which the buck turns toward the sunrise, as if to lead the soul of the high-honor Arthur to heaven). It is said that seeing a deer is \"good luck, good fortune, and abundance\" (as indicated when he sees the buck toward the end of \"A Fork in the Road\"); as for the stag symbolism, it \"means that this is an intuitive time, so pay close attention to what is happening around you. There may be an opportunity for you to release something that no longer serves you. So be prepared to enter a new phase that brings new opportunities.\"[17]\n\nIf Arthur's Honor is low, he sees a twisted, black-furred coyote in the night rain. According to the entry on \"Coyote Symbolism & Meaning\" by Clifford, the general symbolic meaning of the coyote \"is a jokester, playfulness, adaptability, seeing the truth behind it, a complex and cunning personality, wisdom, and cleverness\", often representing \"two sides of the same coin, being a troublesome creature, but a good fortune sign.\" The coyote \"teaches us to find the equilibrium between wisdom and foolishness\", though it is \"not a simple teacher\". In Chinese and Japanese folklore, \"the white coyote symbolism is complimentary, while the black coyote meaning is evil\", which is why the low-honor Arthur is often portrayed as the latter coyote. In the context of Christianity, \"the coyote’s spiritual meaning is of a poor creature that would not deserve attention or respect otherwise, but that even this insignificant and disgraceful animal is better than his people\", and there is \"a Christian child's story of a coyote hunting a cat, in which it lures its prey away from safety step by step so that it could catch and kill it. The meaning of coyotes, in this case, is an analogy to Satan that tempts you away from the righteous path,\" which kind of foreshadows the way that Micah Bell (a personification of evil) will kill Arthur in both low-honor endings. In Celtic symbolism, the coyote \"is not a very common animal in these parts, but it is associated with dogs and wolves\" (the latter of which \"also guide the dead and are closely linked to Hades – the God of the underworld\"[18]), and its spirit guide, much like the wolf, \"is present in the Otherworld to accompany the dead, as some believe\", which could be why the coyote in the final dream is turning toward the cave that could symbolize Hades, a terrible fate for the low-honor Arthur. When he sees a coyote in his dreams, they often signify a profit he gains from other people's misery, and its symbolism \"might also be of a thief, trickster, or a dangerous situation awaiting you.\" Clifford concludes that to implement the coyote's energy, \"we need to pay close attention and learn from its playful and deceiving teachings.\"[19]\n\nArthur is the second protagonist in the Red Dead series to be killed off in his respective game, the first being John Marston in the first Redemption title. However, Arthur is chronologically the first.\n\nIn the mission replay section of the menu, Arthur appears along with John in the picture representing \"Epilogue, Part 1\", despite Arthur not appearing in the epilogues. Instead, the image of him and John is from the \"Red Dead Redemption\" mission, during the standoff.\n\nIn \"The Artist's Way\", when the player attends Charles Châtenay's art exhibition at Galerie Laurent in Saint Denis, they can find a photograph portrait of Arthur.\n\nSome Stranger side-missions can be started with Arthur at first but must be completed with John due to parts of the mission requiring the player to travel to New Austin, an area that Arthur is not allowed to enter by default. However, with the use of glitches, finishing said side missions with Arthur results in appropriate dialogue.\n\nUnlike John, Arthur almost never says the word \"fuck\", except during the camp song \"One-Eyed Riley\", when insulting the Murfree Brood by calling them \"kin-fucking bastards\", and a third time in a random encounter where he can say \"go fuck the deal\".\n\nArthur may hum songs when he travels in the wild. This can only happen when riding his horse at a trotting pace.\n\nWhen Arthur gets drunk, he will sing songs the gang often sings at camp loudly when riding his horse. His body will also tilt slightly when riding.\n\n\"The Haraway\" outfit in Red Dead Online is based on Arthur's \"Summer Gunslinger\" outfit.\n\nArthur died circa 36 years old and was affected by tuberculosis. This is the same age as when the famous gunslinger John Henry \"Doc\" Holliday died in real life, who was also afflicted with tuberculosis.\n\nDuring a Q&A panel at SacAnime 2019, Roger Clark revealed that in an earlier draft of Red Dead Redemption 2, Arthur was supposed to have a newborn child that froze to death on the way to Colter at the beginning of the game. This was eventually scrapped, but the idea of Arthur previously having a son became part of his backstory in the form of Isaac.[11]\n\nIf Arthur donates $20 to the Quincy Harris Memorial Hall, his name can be seen immortalized once the construction is completed on a plaque in 1907.\n\nGallery\n\nMain article: Arthur Morgan/Gallery\n\nReferences"
