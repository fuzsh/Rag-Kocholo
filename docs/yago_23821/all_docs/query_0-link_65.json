        "text": "Just about the greatest thriller to ever turn a moviegoer’s knuckles white, Henri-Georges Clouzot’s The Wages of Fear is to nail-biter cinema what Raymond Chandler is to detective fiction: pretty damn essential. For pure thriller mechanics, it’s a textbook in step-by-step screw-tightening, while those looking for something of more substance will find themselves swimming in the stuff.\n\nThe South American village of Las Piedras is located just past the edge of nowhere, baking in the sun and providing just the correctly seedy backdrop for a batch of sallow Europeans to abuse the locals and laze about the cantina, to the pained chagrin of its hapless owner. There’s no work, the road doesn’t go anywhere, and a plane ticket out it too expensive. It’s the kind of place where dead-enders show up after getting kicked out of the Last Chance Saloon, a hole for dying in.\n\nThat does not mean there is no money to be made and hearts to break. The most dashing of the dead-enders is Mario (Yves Montand), a dashing and immoral louse who sponges off his hardworking roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli), acts abusively towards his erstwhile girlfriend, the barmaid Linda (played with va-va-voom naïveté by the director’s wife Vera Clouzot), and affects a wry above-it-all attitude.\n\nInto this hotbed of atmospheric slack drops Jo (Charles Vanel), a former smuggler who had to light out fast from another town and washes up in Las Piedras. Jo and Mario senses a kindred Gallic scoundrel spirit in each other, preferring to stick with their own rather than bother building relationships with the locals (the two might be crooks, but their colonialist superiority runs deep).The two pair up and start desultorily looking for whatever scam that will get them out of town. Clouzot puts the screws to his largely detestable characters by providing them that break, but making it something that only somebody with a death wish would ever consider.\n\nAt a nearby oil field run by the Southern Oil Company — an American-run concern that exemplifies heartless and crushing capitalism at its most rapacious (one character bleakly notes that wherever oil is, the Americans aren’t far behind) — an accident killed several workers from Las Piedras and left a raging fire. The solution? Hire four men to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerin 300 miles to that field, where it will be used to stop the fire. These men would have to be suicidal, of course, as the road is rough and the nitro unstable enough that a pothole could set it off. The payload packs enough wallop that the trucks drive a half-hour apart to ensure that if one explodes it doesn’t take the other out as well.\n\nCalling the job a suicide run doesn’t quite cut it. But $2,000 is a lot of money.\n\nDozens of the local dead-enders eager to get out of Las Piedras jump at the chance. Mario and Jo end up one truck, while the other is manned by Luigi and Bimba (Peter van Eyck), a walking skeleton of a fatalist whose years of imprisonment by the Nazis appears to have helped put life’s dangers into perspective.\n\nThe drive itself an eye-clawing, gut-twisting exercise in tension. The trucks grind along at a painfully slow pace when the roads are good, and even slower when not. There’s a stretch where the road is so rutted that the only way to not jostle the nitro is to floor it and fly over the ruts. Later, the drivers hit a spot where the only way around a corner is to back the trucks onto a rickety wood platform built over a deep ravine; the agonizing creaking and swaying is edited together with a nerve-shredding precision that has rarely been equaled since. When Jo says, “I’ve died 50 times since last night,” Mario takes it as whining, but it feels more like an understatement.\n\nNot surprisingly, every challenge the drivers face is a litmus test for what kind of men these four are, a sort of reverse Treasure of the Sierra Madre (which came out a few years before and mined a similar seam of cynicism, albeit in a somewhat glossier package). The fuse is lit but the explosion waits, and waits, and even when it comes it hasn’t really come, because there’s something even worse just around the corner.\n\nClouzot’s view of mankind’s time on the planet could charitably be described as Hobbesian: solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. That viewpoint is given extra gloom by some triple-espresso jolts of mid-century existential despair, sheer misanthropy, and an angry anti-Americanism that was potent enough in 1953 to result in several cuts from the original release. It all paints a bleak enough picture that Sam Peckinpah appears to have lifted Clouzot’s opening shot (a child torturing cockroaches) to kick off his comparably heartwarming The Wild Bunch.\n\nWhile Clouzot’s film is suffused with rage at the evil being done to the world (the oil company’s rape of the countryside) and those done by mankind to each other, it’s an impotent sort of rage, made hopeless by cold reality. Mario talks with Jo about how nice Luigi is to him, doing all the cooking and everything, only to gratuitously add — in the director’s voice, one’s tempted to think — “chump.” A woman prays to the Virgin Mary only to see behind the statue a corpse hanging from a tree; one of the Europeans who’d given up trying to get out of Las Piedras. Clueless and cruel appear to be the only settings for humanity here, with occasional nods given to competence in the face of danger.\n\nThere’s a critique of modern capitalism to be found somewhere within the film’s depiction of rapacious corporations and opportunistic scavengers, but also a human critique as well. Nobody and nothing gets off easy here. After all, what is one to do with men who are driving bombs-on-wheels that feature signs reading “No smoking within 50 feet” while they puff away in the cab?\n\nThe Wages of Fear is a frantic, vicious, existentialist howl that still manages to laugh. It goes grinning into the void.\n\nA version of this article was originally published at filmcritic.com"
