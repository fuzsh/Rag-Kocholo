        "text": "\"A masterpiece of suspense\" Christopher Nolan\n\nBased on the 1950 French novel Le Salaire de la peur and critically hailed upon its release, The Wages of Fear propelled its director Henri-Georges Clouzot (Les Diaboliques) to international fame, and is rightly considered a classic of cinema.\n\nIn a squalid South American village, four desperate men are hired by an American oil company to embark on a treacherous journey, transporting a volatile cargo of nitro-glycerine to a massive oil well fire. Friendships and courage are pushed to the limit in this nail-biting thriller by a director who would go on to be dubbed the ‘French Hitchcock’."
