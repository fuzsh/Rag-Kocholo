        "text": "Before directing his first feature, Henri-Georges Clouzot (The Wages of Fear, Diabolique) spent ten years learning the ropes. During this prolific period as a screenwriter he learned cinematic grammar and began to forge his style. To better know and understand Henri-Georges Clouzot, you have to discover these rare films, of which he was one of the principal architects. Kino Classics is proud to present CLOUZOT: THE EARLY WORKS, which collects six varied features he worked on from 1931-1933: frothy comedies, boxing dramas, musicals and melodramas. The set includes his directorial debut â€“ the short film The Terror of Batignolles (1931), which anticipates his canonical thrillers to come."
