        "text": "Howard Hawks' Only Angels Have Wings and John Huston's The Treasure of Sierra Madre grimly merged together in what is now considered one of the greatest pure white-knuckle procedural thriller situations ever conceived of due two equally masterful takes on Arnaud's authentic, explosive expatriate material: Clouzet's more effectively blunt and direct, Friedkin's more hysterically hellish and atmospheric. Still 70 years later among the bleakest, most expertly-crafted visions of what it might feel like to live inside intense, violent levels of precarity and expendability; grueling, primitive, existential, and—as written about ad nauseam (because it's true!)—unbearably tense. It's easy to see how the macho death drive and filthy, fatalistic desperation would eventually inspire just about everything Peckinpah but especially The Wild Bunch.…\n\nI went into the screening of wages of fear without a clue as to the subject matter; knowing only that it was a classic, it was well regarded, and it was two and a half hours long. Because of its girth, it was an unusual choice for a Thursday evening with the neighbours. We had an early ( for us ) dinner and brewed the coffee extra strong.\n\nAs the opening scenes unfolded, I was convinced that this was a stage inspired psychological mystery come character study. We’re presented with the dilapidated South American town of Las Piedras, and its sub culture of trapped Europeans. The way in is seemingly easy, the way out near impossible. We see the pecking…\n\nThe Wages of Fear is as exciting and nerve-rattling now as it must have been 65 years ago. Just be patient for the first hour while it establishes character background. It’s worth it since the next eighty minutes keep you pinned to your seat. In South America, four men have to navigate a transport truck over mountainous terrain while carrying lethal nitroglycerin. The roads are narrow and narrower, and increasingly hazardous – the slightest bump can blow them up. They want to move slowly, but on necessary occasions they have to crank up the speed. And other times, they have to move across shallow but untrustworthy streams and motes. Do you really think all four will make it? This Henri-Georges…\n\nThe Wages Of Fear is a film that doesn't really seem to fit in with its time. It also doesn't seem to fit easily into any category relating to its origin. Furthermore, it's still quite unlike many films that have ever been made.\n\nHere, you have a mid-1950s French-Italian action adventure thriller that features dialogue in at least four different languages, has at least three or four different scenes that surely put it at odds with censors around that time (especially Vera Cluzot on all fours scrubbing the floor and leaving nothing to the imagination), and lasts, in the version I saw, over two and a half hours long.\n\nIt seems to defy easy categorisation and doesn't really fit into…\n\nThere is so much tension in The Wages of Fear. At any moment things may explode, whether that be through violent confrontations between men, accidents in unsafe terrain, or literally explosive cargo. The enemy here is man, where survival depends on co-operation and people are forced into dangerous circumstances through desperation. The Wages of Fear relies on a lot of cruel dramatic irony, meaning none of the main characters have any guarantee of living to the end. For its time the film is unsparingly brutal, sending characters into an inferno they have little chance of surviving. But people need money to live, and will provide their own blood to get it. The Wages of Fear builds so much atmosphere, creating…\n\nThe Wages of Fear opens with the close-up of some swarming insects and a hand annoying them with a stick. The shot then widens to portray a barely dressed black boy, in the middle of the only street of a miserable Central America village where the squalid life of four adventurers takes place. Like the insects seen in the opening, the film's protagonists prove unable to master their own destiny, which - similar to the hand holding the stick - will decide on their life and death. Trapped in a motionless hell that forces them into a state of abandonment and despair, these men with no past decide to sell their lives by lending themselves to the dangerous mission of…\n\nFrom the director of Les Diaboliques, The Wages of Fear is one of Henri-Georges Clouzot's best-known works that remains as effective today as it was back during its time of release. Certainly amongst the finest examples of suspense in cinema history, the thrilling manner in which it manages to sustain its nail-biting tension for the majority of its runtime makes it an instant classic.\n\nSet in an isolated South American village, The Wages of Fear tells the story of 4 men who in order to escape from their miserable lives accept a handsome-paying but highly-dangerous job of driving two trucks over mountain dirt roads. The trucks are loaded with the extremely volatile nitroglycerine which might go off at the slightest…\n\nThe Wages of Fear is two films in one. The one that quite rightly entrances everyone who watches it is a 90-minute, white-knuckle suspense thriller. That movie is a masterclass in the building of tension through non-events, and the way in which otherwise innocuous close-ups can make you hold your breath for fear of shaking something loose on screen.\n\nThe less discussed movie hidden within The Wages of Fear is the 60 minutes with which the film begins, an hour long prison drama in which men make their own kind of peace with the grimy fishbowl in which they are trapped. In this drama, men are forced to reckon with themselves and one another, and become part of an ever-shifting…"
