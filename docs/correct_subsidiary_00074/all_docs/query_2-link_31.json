        "text": "patents up the wazoo\n\nIf Apple bought TiVo, they'd have pretty much all the IP for set-top boxes in terms of DVR functionality.\n\n*With such a patent portfolio at its disposal and with Apple's cash reserves to fund IP protection, Apple could put a big hurt on the cable companies with their DVR wares.\n\n*TiVo filed a lawsuit against Dish Network (Echostar) over the Dish Player PVR once Dish started throwing in their offering for free with their regular service. The suit is not on antitrust groups but on patent infringement.\n\n*TiVo has never sued Microsoft for the UltimateTV product, nor any of the machines that Windows Media Center PC OS runs atop. There is no evidence that the recent detente (sic) between Microsoft and TiVo in terms of using the TiVo-To-Go Service with Windows Media/Pocket PC portable devices include any sort of payola to cover Microsoft's own IP violations of TiVo's intellectual property in the past.\n\n*TiVo has not sued Comcast over their deployment of the Motorola DVR series. Comcast is/was a shareholder in TiVo. However, that is not a barrier to suing; 3dfx wound up suing Sega over tearing up their contract to supply the graphics chipset in the Dreamcast when Microsoft successfully pressured Sega to opt for the NEC PowerVR chipset instead. The backstory to that was NEC complained to Microsoft over the deal and Microsoft made Sega change chipsets since Microsoft paid for the Dreamcast development (it ran WinCE) and everyone should consider the Dreamcast as the Xbox-beta (or alpha).\n\n*Likewise, TiVo has not sued Charter or Time Warner Cable for offering the Motorola or Moxi set-top boxes.\n\n*TiVo could also challenge DirecTV over supplying a DirecTV branded DVR based upon the design by NDS. NDS of Britain is a company owned by Rupert Murdoch whose News Corp. (aka \"Fox\") owns 33% of DirecTV stock. It is Murdoch's meddling that is forcing DirecTV to \"change\" platforms, not a grand design on DirecTV's part to ruin TiVo. If Apple does not buy TiVo, I expect Murdoch to snap it up so he has leverage with the IP portfolio to make sure all the cablecos offer any new channels News Corp. decides to debut. Murdoch picked quite a fight with Time Warner when he launched Fox News and Time Warner refused to carry the network on the Time Warner Cable systems. That was a very expensive fight that Murdoch would most likely want to avoid. NDS has yet to ship working software that matches TiVo, even after boasting for 3 years now that they'd be superior.\n\n*If Apple wanted to dominate the DVR IP, they'd have to buy up ReplayTV (and finally put that product line out of its misery) from D&M Holdings, which is Denon. A few years back (and I can't recall if it was the Replay under SonicBlue or not), ReplayTV and TiVo slugged it out in court over IP...after wasting tons of money, they cross-licensed their portfolios. If memory recalls, ReplayTV licensed some of their IP to Scientific Atlanta for their set-top boxes. TiVo has licensed their IP for some of Sony's DVR products in Japan.\n\n*And of course, Hauppage, ATi, and Nvidia must also have IP in terms of DVR like features on the PC platforms via their tv tuner cards.\n\nAll in all, he who holds these patent porfolios and wishes to actually enforce them would be far more successful facing down the cablecos and satellite providers than a company just entering the market today. All the more reason for Apple to acquire TiVo.\n\nTiVo recently shot itself in the foot when it declined to partner with Comcast to become their DVR provider. TiVo thought they deserved more money than Comcast was offering, and so they walked away. Comcast (one of the largest, if not the largest cable companies in the US) started their own (inferior) system, leaving TiVo out in the cold. Hence the resignations of TiVo's management and poor stock performance in recent months...it's not clear whether they have a future.\n\nI purchased a TiVo back in January and tried it for a month...while I loved the interface and ease of use, I was disappointed in the HD space ($100 after-rebate model says 40 hours, but it's more like 23 hours if you want any sort of decent quality) and most notably in the lack of dual tuner functionality (through no fault of TiVos, of course, but still a problem). So I returned my TiVo to Best Buy after 30 days for a full refund and got my one month TiVo subscription fee refunded (still feel guilty about that), and signed up for Comcast's DVR. Dual-tuner, 60 hours recording time, everything consolidated in one set-top box, no equipment fee, lower monthly fee...lots of advantages. The interface isn't nearly as slick as TiVo, and I've had some problems with the Comcast's Motorola unit overheating, but it's liveable.\n\nDual tuners is the deal-breaker for me...find a way to allow TiVo access to play nicely with the cable company equipment, and I'll be a TiVo owner. I'd like to see what Apple can do with the TiVo technology and product offerings, but as it stands right now, TiVo is dead in the water.\n\nnuckinfutz said:\n\nOther than Steve Jobs and Avi Tevananian just how much talent do you think Apple really got with NeXT? Tivo has more talent than you know...do a search on Strangeberry, Tivo's last aquisition and you'll see some intriguing talent that Apple could bring into the fold.\n\nSteve Jobs, CEO - previously of NeXT\n\nJon Rubinstein, VP iPod division - previously of FirePower Systems and NeXT\n\nBertrand Serlet, VP Software Engineering - previously of NeXT\n\nAvie Tevanian, Chief Technology Officer - previously of NeXT\n\nThat's pretty much the entire engineering braintrust at Apple, all from NeXT.\n\nYou're forgetting a key component. Tivo has 3 million subscribers. Thus we need to look at how long it would take Apple to\n\n1. create the hardware and software\n\n2. create a userbase\n\nNot easy to do even if you have the right components. Buying Tivo allows Apple to start on the 3rd floor rather than the ground floor. They could engender good will by lowering the monthly fees to $8.95 or so.\n\nThey get a ready made infrastructure and marketing campaign. Tivo is known like kleenex and Xerox. It's the branding that is so important. It's also a potential bedrock to infuse more Apple services in the future. iTMS support, Airport and other technologies.\n\nYou've got to be joking. TiVo is 'known like Kleenex and Xerox'??? Apple needs marketing help and brand recognition from TiVo??? The last I heard, Apple is doing pretty well in the consumer space with iTMS, iPod, and Mac Mini. TiVo's 3 million subscribers is a drop in the bucket for Apple. Apple is gonna sell 500 million songs this year. That alone is more in revenues than TiVo's 3 million subscribers have to offer.\n\nThe key for Apple--if and when they go into selling video content--is to leverage iTunes. iTunes has far more market penetration potential than anything TiVo has to offer. It's Apple's ultimate trojan horse (the good kind).\n\nTiVo's business is fundamentally different from Apple's. TiVo loses money on its hardware to sell its service. Apple provides software and service to sell its hardware (more akin to ElGato). So if Apple ever acquires TiVo, it's not for their business model.\n\nAs I said before, if Apple wants to get into the DVR business, it makes more sense for them to acquire ElGato. ElGato's products are complementary. They would help sell more Macs. You were talking about iLife integration. Well EyeHome already does that--way better than what TiVo has done so far.\n\nDoctor Q said:\n\nApple and music go together. Apple and video go together. Apple and consumers go together. So this isn't an unreasonable avenue for a possible Apple investment.\n\nI read a business article about TiVo last week, and it said their business is helped by their many loyal fans, who want them to succeed and swear by their product. Sound familiar?\n\nYou're not kidding. When I was waiting for FedEx to ring my bell with my new Tivo, I hopped on over to http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/\n\nYou think questions get answered in here fast? Had it up and running in less than 10 minutes (it really is easy and intuitive to use). Best piece of technology I ever bought (next to my Macs, of course). I never watch live TV anymore.\n\nThat being said, the only reason I can see for Apple to but them is for their programming expertise. As good as Tivo is, I don't see them lasting due to people not getting the technology (Macs anyone?) and cable/satellite providers providing cheap alternatives for the lemmings.\n\nGregGomer said:\n\nI doubt it, TiVo is about the most unituitive DVR I've ever used. We personally use the old Microsoft Ultimate TV that they don't make any more, because, I know this makes no sense, but it has the best user interface of any I've seen and is fast, and just easy to use. Where as the TiVo I have to hit sometimes 10 more buttons/steps just to set up a recording. Infact most DVRs that I've used that are user friendly, comcast or ReplayTV all mimic the UltimateTV interface. Where as TiVo, I'ts just not intuitive, which just isn't apple. Plus it seems to be missing all the things we all love about Apple, cool features and integration to the digital hub world. So unless Apple was planning to release a new revised version under with a new OS and new features, but benefiting from the TiVo name... it just doesn't make sense.... And even then, they could ride the iPod name almost as well as the TiVo name, granted by buying TiVo they buy into a huge user base. But other then that... I just don't see how it benefits them. As TiVo just needs an general overhaul.\n\nI couldn't disagree more. I absolutely love my Tivo and its interface. My brother has Replay TV so I've seen theirs. Are you aware of all the remote shortcuts that exist? Check out http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/index.php?s=\n\nand search \"remote shortcuts\".\n\nA. Regarding their declining customer base, Apple would be buying Tivo mainly for their technology, not their customer or revenue stream. Of course they will try to maintain and grow the standalone Tivo sales...\n\nApple could develop their own tech for this, but it's far easier to just buy Tivo whose stock is in the dumps right now. Apple has the cash, Tivo is a drop in the bucket.\n\nB. This technology will not only be for Macs, it will be for the next-generation iPod as well. Imagine an iPod that had Tivo-level functionality with iPod grace and UI. It would really put the current crop of video players to shame. I can already see Jobs at the next MacWorld, talking about the 'torturous interface' that current video players have...\n\nI think the key to making the video thing work is to make it like television/ Tivo where content is automatically refreshed. Not only that, but all your Mac devices will work together in this aspect. Fire up your Tivo.app from any Mac or iPod or regular television in the house (except your Shuffle), and access your Tivo-recorded content...\n\nCurrent movie player devices use the music library paradigm, which is totally wrong for video. Regular people watch movies on DVD and VCR, they don't have an overwhelming need to encode DivX movies to a handheld video player so they can watch Spider-Man 2 while on the can. OTOH, fresh broadcast content makes much more sense for a portable video player- you can watch the news or a short sitcom while on the bus or whatever.\n\nActually, I can almost guarantee this is the direction Apple will go- I know they will make it work. And the people will love it.\n\nI've been generally pessimistic about convergence and home media networks, because I think for the general consumer they are far more trouble than they are worth. OTOH, I think Apple using Tivo technology could actually make it work well enough that people will want it and buy it.\n\nOne of my key factors for my bullishness on Apple stock has been that they willl eventually come out with new consumer electronics products besides the iPod. I think this is where they're going to go.\n\nI hope this deal goes through- it will really signal Apple's next major move beyond digitial music."
