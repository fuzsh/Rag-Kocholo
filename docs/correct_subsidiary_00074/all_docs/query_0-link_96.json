        "text": "The objective of the research is to map the literature based on a Systematic Literature Review on the theme of startups and to highlight some theoretical gaps based on publications of high-reputation scientific journals. The period from 1990 to 2019 was defined for the elaboration of this study. We use the excel spreadsheet, in addition to the HistCite ™, VOSviewer, IRATUMEQ, and R Studio packages. The results show that the typology of the startups evaluated, after reading 68% of the articles, organizations are characterized as a group of new companies, that is, relatively young and inexperienced when compared to the most stable and mature in organizational development. They refer to those that are in the initial stage and are susceptible to the influence of various factors, such as investors, supplier customers, partners, etc., and should think strategically about how to act and, this concerns a group of dynamic startups that work with innovations.\n\nNever before in the history of India, a successful initiative was taken by Government of India by announcing a campaign by Indian Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi at Vigyan Bhavan Auditorium in New Delhi during his speech on 15 August 2015. Even No-one would have been thought about its huge success at that moment. But now, just look at the magical moves taken by this unbelievable movement in the business world of India. Success is not the result of a single stroke. No doubt various parameters were fixed at different levels to encourage Startup journey. So many convincing factors worked diligently to ensure its success. However, it has covered a long journey of success despite of various hurdles. Not only it has been promoted in India but also it has been cherished globally. Huge population, Hidden talent in educated youth, Readiness of Investors, Technical advancement and different Government schemes like DIGITAL INDIA, STAND-UP INDIA, MAKE IN INDIA AND SWARAJ and many more pushed it enough to flourish around the world. A startup defines us to be our own boss and of course meeting the demand for employment by others that requires a lot of patience and tactics. It is a well-organized and disciplined way of using several factors like basic idea, market strategies, level of competition, and Techno-Pro attitude especially in the present scenario of entrepreneurship before putting huge steps to accomplish the journey. Different and severally important elements play an effective role in entrepreneurial success like availability of Infrastructural facilities, government rules and regulations and funds availability during various phases of growth. History shows the ups and downs of this journey by revealing various examples of its success or failure within a short span of time after mentioning the actual causes responsible for .The paper titled 'STARTUPS-A NEW PARADIGM FOR YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS' depicts the entire story of its coming into existence with the current status.\n\nHow does a young, “peripheral” country develop the cultural infrastructure - the myths and stories - it needs to inspire creation of the heroic forces for creating successful enterprises in a hypercompetitive, globalising world? The article presents the ‘first act’ of the true story of the establishment and early challenges faced by an ambitious new venture, New Zealand-based Pacific Lithium Limited (PLL), and its founding entrepreneur, Robin Johannink. Somewhat untypical for a formal business case report, the structure of the story presented here is strongly informed by Vogler’s (1998) “mythic structure of the heroic journey” and inspired by de Jong’s (1999) application of the mythic structure to what he notes as the heroic task of establishing a new business enterprise. The second part of the article presents observations drawn from the Pacific Lithium story, and outlines our approaches for extending the learning one can make from contemporary heroic tales of enterprise such as the one presented here. The author concludes that de Jong appears quite correct when he suggests that “as a scalable, replicable piece of social code, [the mythic structure of the heroic journey] could be as profound as the biological code Watson and Crick found in DNA” (de Jong, p. 159) Related: Mellalieu, P.

Thus, the study is characterized as qualitative, descriptive and multiple cases, in which data collection took place through semi-structured interviews with two entrepreneurs from Itajubá (MG) startups. The criteria of representativeness, availability and minimum working time were established for choosing the participants. The content analysis was carried out through the categories: female trajectory, leadership and barriers. The main results about female management are associated with the female trajectory, especially by childhood, family support and professional career; leadership characteristics of respect, equality, democracy and participation leading to transformational leadership; and challenges for the entrepreneurship practice such as discrimination, harassment and reconciliation between professional, personal and intimate life. The main contributions of...\n\nBusiness incubators have been highlighted as vital contributors and value-creation organizations to entrepreneurs during their venture developments by offering them multiple resources and specialized support. Notwithstanding, several authors call attention to the significant literature gap concerning research focusing on entrepreneurs’ daily lived incubation experiences to understand their perspectives on incubators. This study aims to explore which aspects are perceived as creating value or limiting the venture development of 16 founders of technology-based startups by interviewing them. Ultimately, it contributes valuable insights about incubation factors that enhance or hinder their overall incubation experience. It suggests that entrepreneurs consider intangible resources and social and relational aspects as the most enriching dimensions of their incubation experiences and concludes with the services they consider to be more important.
