        "text": "SuperSync Basics\n\nSuperSync is software for Mac and Windows that lets you compare and merge all of your music libraries on multiple computers and devices. If you have music and video libraries at home, the office, on laptops, on iPods, iPhones, and disk drives, SuperSync can help you move and sync your iTunes content from one library to another, easily and intuitively.\n\nSuperSync can read a single library or two libraries at the same time. In SuperSync, we refer to these libraries as the Local and Remote Libraries. Once SuperSync reads your library/libraries, you can use the SuperSync's Get, Put, and Sync actions to move music between your two libraries.\n\nLocal and Remote Libraries\n\nThe Local Library is a music library on the machine that SuperSync is running on. By default, the Local Library is set to read the iTunes Library on that machine. For example, if you run SuperSync on your laptop, SuperSync will connect to that laptop's iTunes Library.\n\nNote: The Local Library can also be set to other types libraries. This is an advanced topic that is discussed in detail in the \"Configuring the SuperSync Local Library\" section in this manual.\n\nThe Remote library is the one you are comparing your Local Library. In most cases, the Remote Library will be the music library from another computer running SuperSync. For example, if you have a laptop and a desktop both running SuperSync, the desktop will be the Remote Library for the laptop.\n\nNote: The Remote Library can also be set to other types libraries such as an iPod, another hard drive, or another networked computer running SuperSync. This is an advanced topic that is discussed in detail in the \"Configuring the SuperSync Remote Library\" section in this manual.\n\nTech Info: SuperSync is a client/server application. The SuperSync server is turned on/enabled by default so that SuperSync computers can connect to each other. You can enable/disable the SuperSync Server feature in SuperSync's Preferences window. To access a SuperSync computer from outside your firewall, you'll need to know a little more about IP addresses and port numbers, which is described in more detail in the SuperSync Server and WAN Access sections later in this manual.\n\nThe Local and Remote Libraries are two distinct libraries that may contain some, or all, or no tracks in common. That's where SuperSync comes in. SuperSync connects the two libraries and and lets you compare and sync tracks between the two libraries.\n\nViewing Libraries With SuperSync\n\nSuperSync displays your music library/libraries in the SuperSync Window (see image below):\n\nThe SuperSync window is where you can play, compare, search, and sync tracks from different libraries. It also gives provides the status of various SuperSync features and actions such as transfer status, SuperSync Server status, iTunes actions, etc.\n\nNote: More information about this window and it's features/actions can be found in the \"SuperSync Window\" section in this manual.\n\nWhen viewing tracks, you will notice a a colored dot next to them. This dot identifies where the track exists and whether or not it has been synchronized in both libraries. The following is a list of the possible colors you may see:\n\nGray dot: located in Local Library. If you are viewing two libraries, the track is unsynchronized (i.e. not in the Remote Library)\n\nBlue dot: located in Remote Library. The track is unsynchronized (i.e. not in the Local Library)\n\nGreen dot: Synchronized track. Track is in both Local and Remote libraries.\n\nTurquoise dot: Synchronized track. Track is in both Local and Remote libraries. Turquoise tracks are usually omitted so that you don't see two of every synchronized track.\n\nTransferring/Syncing Files With SuperSync\n\nFiles can be transferred between the Local and Remote libraries using the following SuperSync actions:\n\nGet:\n\nThis action transfers the selected content from the Remote Library to the Local Library\n\nPut:\n\nThis action transfers the selected content from the Local Library to the Remote Library\n\nSync:\n\nThis action Syncs the selected content between the two libraries so content matches on both computers.\n\nNote: You can use Get, Put, and Sync on a single track, tracks from an artist, genre, etc., and tracks of a particular type (e.g. MP3, M4A, etc.) or on an entire library.\n\nCleaning Up Your Libraries\n\nSuperSync groups your libraries' content in standard groups/views such as Music, Movies, TV Shows, etc. In addition to these, SuperSync also groups songs by other criteria such as File Duplicates (tracks that are identical), Possible Duplicates (tracks that are very similar based but don't aren't an exact duplicate), tracks without artwork, tracks with missing track numbers, etc.\n\nIn the SuperSync Window, you can use the Filter Tree to select tracks these groups/views to quickly identify tracks that you may not want to transfer between your libraries. By using SuperSync's Get Info, Compare Tracks, Track Comparison, Remove Duplicates, and Put in Trash/Empty Trash features, you can get additional info about your tracks so you can determine which files to keep, ignore, fix, and/or delete.\n\nListen to Your Libraries From Anywhere!\n\nIn addition to all the features listed above, SuperSync allows your library to viewed/listened to from any device that has a web browser. SuperSync's Web Server feature publishes your Local Library via a web interface. You can then point any computer with a web browser to special SuperSync website and view and listen to your content.\n\nNote: SuperSync's Web Server feature is enabled by default but it can be disabled/enabled in SuperSync's Preferences window in the Network tab.\n\nTech Info: The SuperSync Web Server is typically only available to computers on your local network and not computers from outside your network (e.g. computers on the internet). If you wish to publish your Local Library to computer's outside your network, you will need to make sure your computer is accessible from outside your network. Please read the WAN section in this manual for more information.\n\nSuperSync Basics Wrap Up\n\nWe have now covered the basic concepts and features of SuperSync. Our next section, SuperSync Quick Setup Guide, provides step by step instructions on how to setup and use SuperSync for the first time.\n\nThe SuperSync Window\n\nThe SuperSync Window contains several different buttons, panes, lists, and tool bars for viewing status, sorting tracks, and controlling SuperSync. This section describes the different features of this window.\n\nNote: In addition to this documentation, SuperSync uses \"Tooltips\" that allow you to get more information about a particular window control. Move and hold your mouse cursor over a status item/button/control in the SuperSync Window to get additional text description of that object.\n\nThe top of the SuperSync Window contains SuperSync's Music Controls, Status Pane, Sync Buttons, and Search and Preference Buttons.\n\nMusic Controls:\n\nVolume adjustment, previous track, play/pause, and next track.\n\nStatus Pane\n\nSuperSync's Status Pane provides the current status/configuration of different SuperSync features. The information displayed in the status pane can be selected by selecting different commands under SuperSync's Status menu. You can scroll through the status display options by clicking on the pane.\n\nNote: The Status Pane changes dynamically as needed to show relevant status changes but you can the Status Pane by using the Lock Status command from the Status menu. The Status Pane can display the following information:\n\nSystem Status: This option displays the SuperSync version number and how system resources are being used by SuperSync. You should never need to know the number of running threads or the maximum memory however this is useful if you experience a slowdown and you see you're out of memory, this could be useful in submitting a report or just signaling a restart.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for this option is +1\n\nLibrary Status: This option displays information about the tracks in each library.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for this option is +2\n\nPlayer Status: This option displays status of the SuperSync player, including current track time and name. The status pane is blank when this option is selected and no song is playing.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for this option is +3\n\nServer Status: This option displays status related to SuperSync when it acts as a music server.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for this option is +4\n\nTransfer Status: This option displays the status of any current uploads or downloads.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for this option is +5\n\nSelection Status: This option displays information about the currently selected track(s). Select a single track to see flag information. Select multiple tracks and see what can be synchronized.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for this option is +6\n\niTunes Status: This option displays iTunes connection information, including whether any updates are being performed. Selecting this item will trigger a check to see if the iTunes XML file has changed, and if possible, will rescan the library.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for this option is +7\n\nThe last menu item, Lock Status: This option lets you keep the status pane on the current mode\n\nNote: Clicking on the status pane will switch to the next status mode. SuperSync will try to switch the status to the most relevant mode unless locked.\n\nSync Buttons:\n\nThe Sync buttons are used to transfer songs between two libraries. These button are only enabled when you are connected to both a Local and Remote library.\n\nGet Button:\n\nCopies the selected track(s) from the Remote Library to your Local Library\n\nSync Button:\n\nThis button synchronizes tracks between two libraries. If multiple tracks or an entire view is selected (e.g. the All Unsynchronized view), the Sync button will copy to and from both libraries.\n\nPut Button:\n\nCopies the selected track(s) from your Local Library to the Remote Library\n\nSearch and Preferences Buttons:\n\nThe Search and Preferences Buttons allow you to search your libraries, show all tracks in the Track List (i.e. resets the Track List to show all songs after using search or selecting other views), and open SuperSync's preferences. These buttons are always enabled for use.\n\nShow All Button:\n\nResets/Refreshes the Track List. Use this command to show all tracks after using the Find/Search command or to force the Track List to update to show new tracks that have been added.\n\nFind Button:\n\nOpens the Find Dialog. Use this button to search specific content in your libraries.\n\nPrefs Button:\n\nOpens SuperSync's Preferences window.\n\nFilter Tree\n\nThe Filter Tree pane allows you to quickly select and view content from your library/libraries. This list puts your content into several categories: Library Sources (when viewing two libraries), Track Kinds, Flags and Filters, Problems, File Types, and Playlists. When you select a category, SuperSync will show all content within that category (e.g. selecting Music shows all your Music files, selecting File Duplicates shows all songs that have duplicates, etc). You can also right-click on a category and select the 'Filter These' command to filter/hide those tracks.\n\nTech Tip:\n\nYou can combine the Library Sources view with the Track Kinds, Flags and Filters, Problems, or File Types views to see tracks that match the combined criteria. For example, you can select \"Local - Unsynchronized\" and then select the \"Movies\" view to only show tracks that haven't been synchronized (criteria 1) that are movies (criteria 2). You can then select the resulting tracks in the track list and perform sync functions on those tracks.\n\nThe following is a list of the different sources/views within the Filter Tree and what they show:\n\nLibrary Sources - Library Sources is only shown if you are connected to a Remote Library. It is hidden when you are only viewing your Local Library. The following is the list of possible Library Sources:\n\nDefault View:\n\nDisplays tracks from both Local and Remote Libraries excluding synchronized tracks.\n\nAll Unsynchronized:\n\nDisplays tracks from both Local and Remote Libraries that have not been synchronized.\n\nLocal - All:\n\nDisplays all tracks in the Local Library.\n\nLocal - Unsynchronized:\n\nDisplays tracks from the Local Library that have not been synchronized with the Remote Library.\n\nLocal - Synchronized:\n\nDisplays tracks from the Local Library that have been synchronized with the Remote Library.\n\nRemote:\n\nDisplays all tracks in the Remote Library.\n\nRemote - Unsynchronized:\n\nDisplays tracks from the Remote Library that have not been synchronized with the Local Library.\n\nRemote - Synchronized:\n\nDisplays tracks from the Remote Library that have been synchronized with the Local Library.\n\nAll Tracks:\n\nDisplays tracks from both Local and Remote Libraries including synchronized tracks.\n\nTrack Kinds Filters\n\nMusic:\n\nDisplays all music files in the Track List. This view matches iTunes' Music view.\n\nMovies:\n\nDisplays all movie files in the Track List. This view matches iTunes' Movie view. Excludes TV Show tracks.\n\nTV Shows:\n\nDisplays all TV show files in the Track List. This view matches iTunes' TV Shows view. Excludes movie tracks.\n\nPodcasts:\n\nDisplays all podcast tracks. This view matches iTunes' Podcast view.\n\niTunes U:\n\nDisplays all iTunes U tracks. Non-audio/video files such as PDF and PowerPoint attachments are not shown.\n\nBooks:\n\nDisplays all audiobook tracks. This view matches iTunes' Books view.\n\nMusic Video:\n\nDisplays all music video tracks.\n\nVideo Files:\n\nDisplays all video files (e.g. music videos, movies, etc.)\n\nFlags and Filters\n\nPurchased:\n\nDisplays all Purchased tracks.\n\nCompilation:\n\nDisplays all tracks that are part of a compilation.\n\nMarked:\n\nDisplays all tracks that have been marked within SuperSync using the Mark command.\n\nIn Trash (Local):\n\nDisplays all tracks that have been placed in SuperSync's Trash. Items in SuperSync's Trash are only deleted after using the Empty Trash command from SuperSync's Action menu. Tracks will be removed from SuperSync's Trash if you quit before emptying the trash.\n\nIn Trash (Remote):\n\nUnchecked: These tracks are \"unchecked\" in iTunes.\n\nProblem Filters\n\nMeta Data Mismatch: Displays synchronized tracks that are in both the Local and Remote libraries but the track's meta data doesn't match (e.g. the Local track has a 1 star rating and the Remote track has a 5 star rating). SuperSync's Update Meta Data action will resolve these issues.\n\nNot On Found : Displays tracks that are listed in a library but are not actually on a hard disk. These tracks are also known as orphaned tracks.\n\nMissing Track #: Displays tracks that are missing track number tags. You can fix these tracks by modifying the tracks' track number info within iTunes by using iTunes' 'Get Info' command.\n\nMissing Tags: flags music tracks that are missing one or more of the Album, Artist, or Genre tags. You can use this to filter out music that is not well-tagged.\n\nCopy Error: Displays tracks that did not sync to another library due to a copy error such as read/write error, out of disk space, track not found, or copy refused.\n\nCopy Skipped: A track was skipped and not copied, usually because it conflicts with another track on the destination library.\n\nFile Path Not Safe: Displays tracks that have characters in their file name that are illegal on certain platforms (e.g. apostrophe (') aren't allowed on Windows, but are allowed on the Mac.). Other characters in the whole file path can cause this flag, including: : (colon), *, |, <, >, \". Files and directories that start with a space. Two consecutive spaces are not allowed on some systems. Also flags tracks with file names that have an unknown unicode character.\n\nOutside of Music Dir: This track is located outside the main library directory that is set in iTunes. In iTunes, under the advanced preferences, you can view or set the main library directory.\n\nIncomplete Albums: Displays tracks that are part of an incomplete album (e.g. an album that has 10 tracks but you only have 9 tracks)\n\nNo Artwork: Displays tracks that do not have embedded artwork. Note, tracks can show artwork in iTunes and not have embedded artwork.\n\nDuplicates Filters\n\nFile Duplicates:\n\nDisplays tracks that are duplicates based on file size, CRC, format, etc. You can clean up File Duplicates using SuperSync's Track Comparison or Remove Duplicates features.\n\nFormat Duplicates are tracks appear to be in both AAC and MP3 format.\n\nPossible Dup (same lib):\n\nDisplays tracks that are possible duplicates in the same library where artist, album and title match. SuperSync's Track Comparison or Remove Duplicates features can help determine which files are true duplicates.\n\nPossible Dup (dif lib) :\n\nDisplays tracks that are possible duplicates across two libraries where artist, album and title match. SuperSync's Track Comparison or Remove Duplicates features can help determine which files are true duplicates.\n\nCloud Filters : See Cloud Overview for more information.\n\nCloud Only:\n\nTracks that are not currently on your computer, but are on iTunes iCloud. They will need to be downloaded (using iTunes) before they can be used by SuperSync.\n\nCloud Upgradable:\n\nTracks that are available in a higher bitrate quality.\n\nCloud Low Bitrate Upgradable:\n\nTracks that are encoded below 128kbps that may be upgraded if re-encoded.\n\nCloud Total Tracks:\n\nNumber of tracks imported into iTunes Match.\n\nMatched:\n\nTracks that have been identified (Matched) by iTunes that are available in a high-quality format.\n\nPurchased:\n\nTracks that you have purchased from iTunes.\n\nUploaded:\n\nTracks that have been uploaded to the iTunes Match service.\n\nIneligible:\n\nTracks that cannot be uploaded or matched\n\nLocal Only:\n\nTracks that are not on your computer, but are on iTunes iCloud. They will need to be downloaded (using iTunes) before they can be copied used by SuperSync.\n\nError:\n\nTracks that could not be uploaded. Possibly a bad or corrupt track, or an uploading problem. Check the track.\n\nDuplicate:\n\nTracks that are duplicates that were not uploaded to iTunes Match.\n\nFile Types View\n\nAA Files: Displays AA (Audible) files.\n\nM4A Files (AAC): Displays M4A (AAC) files.\n\nM4B Files (AAC): Displays M4B (AAC) files.\n\nM4P Files (Protected): Displays M4P (protected) files.\n\nM4V Files: Displays M4V files.\n\nMP3 Files: Displays MP3 files.\n\nMP4 Files: Displays M4A files.\n\nMPG Files: Displays MPG files.\n\nWAV Files: Displays WAV files.\n\nOgg Vorbis Files: Displays OGG files.\n\nMP2 Files: Displays MP2 files.\n\nAAC Files: Displays AAC files.\n\nWAV Files: Displays M4P (protected) files.\n\nAVI Files : Displays AVI files.\n\nAIFF Files : Displays AIFF files.\n\nM4P Files : Displays M4P files.\n\nMOV: Displays MOV files.\n\nRingtone: Displays Ringtones.\n\nPlaylist View\n\nIf your Local Library is an iTunes library, the Filter Tree will show your iTunes Playlists ('standard playlists' and Smart Playlists). If your Remote Library is also an iTunes library, the Remote library's playlists will also be shown.\n\nPlaylists are displayed in fashion similar to iTunes' playlists. In SuperSync playlists are also color coded. Gray playlists are in the Local Library, Blue playlists are in the Remote Library, Green playlists are playlists that are in both library (but may not have the same tracks).\n\nSuperSync can synchronize playlists. For more information, read the Playlist Synchronization section later in this manual.\n\nLocal Folder\n\nLocal Playlist\n\nLocal Smart Playlist\n\nRemote Folder\n\nRemote Playlist\n\nRemote Smart Playlist\n\nSynchronized Folder\n\nSynchronized Playlist\n\nSynchronized Smart Playlist\n\nArtwork Pane\n\nThe Artwork pane display a selected track's artwork if the track has artwork embedded within the file. You can show/hide the Artwork pane by using the selecting the Show Artwork command in SuperSync's Controls menu.\n\nNote: tracks can either have embedded artwork (i.e. artwork is part of the file) or have artwork external to the file in iTunes' artwork database. SuperSync can only view and transfer artwork if the artwork is embedded into the track.\n\nTrack List:\n\nThe Track List displays a cumulative listing of all of your libraries' files, along with information about their synchronization status and location. Each column can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on the column header. Selecting different sources/views from the Filter Tree changes or using the Find Dialog changes what tracks are shown in the Track List (although you can always use the 'Show All' button/command to reset the Track List). The following describes the Track List's different columns and their functionality:\n\nThe Source column uses colored icons to indicate the location and sync status of a track. Read the Source Icons heading later in this section for a list of possible icons and their definitions.\n\nThe Flags column uses letter flags to indicate any particular status of note for each file. Read the Flag Icons heading later in this section for a list of possible icons and their definitions.\n\nThe Title column displays the title of each file.\n\nThe Artist column displays the artist of each file.\n\nThe Album column displays the album of each file.\n\nThe Track column displays the track number of each file.\n\nThe Genre column displays the genre of each file.\n\nThe Size column displays the file size of each file.\n\nThe Time column displays the song length of each file.\n\nThe BR column displays the bit rate of each file.\n\nThe Kind column displays the file type (e.g. MP3, M4V, MP4, etc.)\n\nThe Rating column displays the Rating of a track. Note: Ratings are set in iTunes.\n\nMore columns of track information can be displayed or disabled in the View tab in SuperSync's Preferences window.\n\nStatus Footer\n\nAt the bottom of the SuperSync window is the SuperSync Status Footer. This Status Bar displays the status of SuperSync and its various features.\n\nThe Status Bar contains the following fields:\n\nVersion Number\n\nShows the SuperSync Version Number. Please note that all computers running SuperSync should have the same version number.\n\nLocal Library Status\n\nShows Local Library's Total Track Count and Sync Percentage (if Remote Library is connected). If you place and hover your mouse cursor over this field, a tooltip will appear with additional information about your Local Library.\n\nRemote Library Status\n\nShows Remote Library's Total Track Count and Sync Percentage (if Remote Library is connected). If you place and hover your mouse cursor over this field, a tooltip will appear with additional information about your Remote Library.\n\nGet Status\n\nShow current number of tracks being transferred from Remote Library to Local Library. This field is only active when you are transferring tracks between two libraries.\n\nPut Status\n\nShow current number of tracks being transferred from Local Library to Remote Library. This field is only active when you are transferring tracks between two libraries.\n\niTunes Status\n\nWhen any library is set to iTunes, SuperSync tells iTunes to add/remove/update tracks to the iTunes database as files are transferred between libraries. This field reports the current updates that SuperSync is sending to iTunes. Note, in some cases, you may notice this field as 'stuck' in the process of updating. If this happens, switch to iTunes as iTunes may have a dialog open preventing SuperSync from sending its update commands.\n\nNew File(s) Status\n\nShows the number of tracks added to your library from a remote computer.\n\nSuperSync Server Status\n\nDisplays the status of the SuperSync Server (Offline or Server Running). If this field reports 'Offline' as the status, other SuperSync computers will not be able to connect to this computer. Note, you can enable/disable the SuperSync Server in SuperSync's Preferences in the Network tab.\n\nSource Icons\n\nAll files in your library have a colored dot next to them:\n\nGray dot means a local, unsynchronized track\n\nBlue dot means a remote, unsynchronized track\n\nGreen dot means a local synchronized track.\n\nTurquoise Green dot means a remote synchronized track, on your remote library. These tracks are usually omitted so that you don't see two of every synchronized track.\n\nPie charts are used to give you an idea of how much of each album, artist, and genre are synchronized. Blue is remote library, gray is local, and green is synchronized.\n\nFlag Icons\n\nTracks in your library may have different \"flags\" associated with them. Flags can represent a state of the track that helps you manage your music. A short description is available for any track by setting the Status menu to Selection Status.\n\nSet the Status menu to \"Selection Status\" and click a single track. For each flag icon, you'll see a brief description of the flag.\n\nSuperSync tries to keep the flag information relevant, so only some information is displayed in the Track Table for each Track. Here are the flags and their meanings.\n\nFlag Description Local Unsynchronized - In local library and not remote library Remote Unsynchronized - In the remote library and not in the local library Local Synchronized track - This exact file is in both libraries Remote Synchronized track - This exact file is in both libraries. To avoid showing all synchronized tracks twice, this is normally filtered. File duplicate: The content matches another track. The tags and file name may not match. Not found on Disk: Track does not appear to be on the disk where it should be. A rescan is recommended. File exists only on the cloud. It must be downloaded (in iTunes) before it can be played or copied with SuperSync. Compilation: Music track part of a compilation No Track Number - An audio file without a track number tag File Copy Error; The file was not synchronized. May be network error, or read/write error. Incomplete; Not part of an entire album. A perfect track is part of a complete music album that has all the tags defined. Used for those who like to collect full albums. Possible Duplicate: Tags suggest track may be duplicated in the same library. Possible Duplicate: Tags suggest track may exist in the other library. Contains a file path that may not be legal on all computer systems. File is outside of root library path. Files outside the root path may be on an external drive or other location. In Get Queue; Marked for downloading from remote site or library In Put Queue: Marked for uploading to your remote library MP3 File Type M4A File Type M4A File Type AA/Audio book MP4 File Type Movie File Local Playlist Local Playlist In trash - To be deleted\n\nSuperSync Window Settings\n\nThe SuperSync Window can be modified in several ways. You can resize the Filter Tree column and Track List columns by moving your mouse cursor to the border of a column until your cursor changes to a resize cursor ( or ) and then dragging the border.\n\nYou can also control the Track List's font size and the columns shown in the Track List by. You can access these settings in SuperSync's Preferences in the View tab.\n\nSuperSync Window Wrap Up\n\nNow that you have learned about the SuperSync Window's features, you can proceed to the next section in our manual, SuperSync Menus. This next section describes all of the SuperSync's menus and their use.\n\nMenus\n\nMost of SuperSync's functionality can be accessed via the SuperSync Window but there are additional features available via SuperSync's Menu bar and contextual menus.\n\nTech Note:\n\nThe menu bar is the bar at the top of the SuperSync window that starts with the FILE menu. Contextual menus are menus that appear when your right-click within certain parts of the SuperSync window. Menu bars don't change but contextual menu bars may change depending on where you clicked within the SuperSync window.\n\nImportant Note:\n\nSuperSync's Menu commands are identical on both Mac and Windows. However, due to OS standards, certain commands are located in different menus.

This next section describes all of the SuperSync's Preferences window and their use.\n\nSuperSync Quick Setup Guide\n\nSyncing Between Two iTunes Libraries Over A Network\n\nThis guide walks you through the setup and syncing of two iTunes Libraries over a network using SuperSync.\n\nFor the purpose of this guide, we will be using the following scenario:\n\nTwo computers (Computer #1 and Computer #2)\n\nBoth computers are connected to the same network/LAN\n\nBoth computers use iTunes to manage that computer's music, movies, etc.\n\nBoth computers have different content in their libraries\n\nBoth libraries will be 'Sync'ed' so both computers have the same content\n\nBoth computers will use SuperSync's to 'Get', 'Put', and 'Sync' files between the two iTunes libraries\n\nIf you are using a different configuration, please read this guide since the concepts in presented here will also help you understand the basics of SuperSync. Other configurations, such as syncing with a network drive are discussed later in this manual.\n\nTip: Before attempting a complete synchronization, at least for the first time, you should synchronize only one or two files to make sure they're going where you expect them.\n\nNote: All of the Quick Start guides below assume that you are using iTunes as your default local music library. Typically your Local Library is configured to us iTunes and you then connect to various \"remote\" libraries such as iPods,iPhones, disk drives, and other networked SuperSync libraries.\n\nComputer #1 and Computer # 2 Setup\n\nInstall and launch SuperSync on Computer #1. When the SuperSync starts, SuperSync will connect to your iTunes library and show it's content.\n\nNote: The first time you launch SuperSync, SuperSync will ask you if you want to enable the SuperSync Server and setup a password for server access. If you see this screen, you can enter it now, or later in the next steps.\n\nOpen SuperSync's Preferences ( ,) via SuperSync's FILE menu (Mac) or EDIT menu (Windows).\n\nNext click Network Preferences tab. Enable/Check the 'Enable SuperSync Server' and the 'Accept Music Uploads From Other Networked SuperSync(s)' checkboxes. These checkboxes will allow your computer to be seen by other computers running SuperSync.\n\nVerify that the SuperSync Server is running by looking at SuperSync's Status Bar. In the lower right-hand corner of the SuperSync Window, the server status should change from \"Publishing [yourServerName] to \"Server Running [yourServerName]\"\n\nNote: If the SuperSync Server isn't running, confirm SuperSync's Preferences (Step 2). If you still have issues starting the SuperSync Server, see the Server Help and the Network Trouble Shooting Guide.\n\nOnce you verify that the SuperSync Server is running, the configuration on this computer is complete. Leave SuperSync running since we will be connecting to it later in this quick start.\n\nRepeat Steps 1-5 on Computer #2 (and any other computers if you have more than a 2 client SuperSync license).\n\nConnecting To A Computer Running SuperSync\n\nFrom Computer # 1, in SuperSync's Remote menu, select the 'Connect to LAN Server' command and then select your Computer # 2.\n\nAfter selecting your Computer #2, SuperSync on Computer #1 will connect to Computer #2's library.\n\nNote: You can initiate the connection from either computer since the SuperSync Server is running on both computers.\n\nTech Info: The Connect to LAN Server looks for other SuperSync computers via Bonjour. If you don't see your other computer, you can manually enter your other computer's IP address by using the 'Connect to Server' command in the Remote menu.\n\nOnce SuperSync connects to the other library, SuperSync will connect to that computer and display both libraries (the Local and Remote libraries) in the SuperSync Window.\n\nAt this point, both libraries are connected. We will now use SuperSync to compare and sync content between the two libraries.\n\nQuickly Determine Which Songs Need To Be Synced\n\nNow that you are viewing Computer #1 and Computer #2's libraries, we will use SuperSync's Filter Tree to quickly determine which songs need to be synced from either the Local or Remote library's point of view. To do this, follow these steps:\n\nOnce SuperSync is connected to another library, you will see 'Library Sources' in SuperSync's 'Filter Tree' pane.\n\nThis shows the tracks that are in your remote library, where blue tracks are Remote Only, and Turquise tracks are in both the local library and remote library.\n\nBy clicking on one of the Library sources, you can see tracks that are synchronized (in both libraries), unsynchronized (in just the local or remote library) or any combination.\n\nSelect the 'Local Unsynchronized' view to see songs that are on your computer (aka the Local Library) but not in the Remote Library.\n\nSelect the 'Remote Unsynchronized' view to see songs that are in the Remote Library but not on your computer (aka the Local Library)\n\nSelect the 'Default View' view to see all the tracks in your library.\n\nOther views can show unsynchronized tracks, synchronized tracks, All local or remote tracks, etc.\n\nFilters are covered in detail in the Main Window section.\n\nNote: When viewing tracks, you will notice a a colored dot next to them. This dot identifies where the track exists and whether or not it has been synchronized in both libraries. The following is a list of the possible colors you may see:\n\nGray dot:\n\nlocated in Local Library. If you are viewing two libraries, the track is unsynchronized (i.e. not in the Remote Library)\n\nBlue dot:\n\nlocated in Remote Library. The track is unsynchronized (i.e. not in the Local Library)\n\nGreen dot:\n\nSynchronized track. Track is in both Local and Remote libraries.\n\nTurquoise dot:\n\nSynchronized track. Track is in both Local and Remote libraries. Turquoise tracks are usually omitted so that you don't see two of every synchronized track.\n\nYou have now selected the key views for determining which songs need to be synced. In the next section, we will be selecting tracks and syncing them between the two libraries.\n\nSyncing Songs Between Two Libraries\n\nNow that you are have viewed your identified your unsynchronized tracks, we will use SuperSync's Get, Put, and Sync commands to move tracks between the two connected libraries. Since this is your first time syncing songs, we will start by selecting individual tracks to transfer between computers. We will later sync multiple tracks between your computers. To do this, follow these steps:\n\nIn SuperSync's Track List, find a unsynchronized track (either a Local track [ gray dot] or Remote track [ blue dot]).\n\nTo sync an unsynchronzied song:\n\nSelect one or more Gray tracks and click Sync or Put button copy them to the Remote SuperSync library\n\nSelect one or more Blue tracks and click Sync or Get button copy them to your Local SuperSync library\n\nOnce you use the Get, Put, or Sync actions, SuperSync will open the Transfer Status Window and show you the status of your transfer(s).\n\nNote: The Transfer Status Window shows detailed information about your transferred files such as number of songs transferred, total size (in MB) of transfers, number of files skipped (due to duplication or errors), iTunes Updates (SuperSync telling iTunes to make updates to its database), etc.\n\nOnce your tracks have been transferred, SuperSync will update its Track List and, if necessary, tell iTunes (on either your computer or the Remote computer) to update its database for the newly added songs.\n\nYou can confirm that your files were transferred successfully by opening iTunes on either computer. Please note that transferred files may not appear immediately since iTunes may take a few moments to complete its database updates. You can also use the ''Local Synchronized' and 'Remote Synchronized' views in SuperSync to see if your synced songs appear as 'synced' (with either a green dot or turquoise dot).\n\nIf you wish to sync more individual tracks, repeat Steps 1 through 4. If you want to synchronize all the songs between both libraries, you can select an entire view and then select the Get, Put, or Sync actions.\n\nYou have now learned how to transfer songs between two libraries using SuperSync.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt this point, you have connected two iTunes libraries on two different computers and synced tracks using SuperSync. This is the way SuperSync is most commonly used but there are many other ways of using SuperSync. You can use SuperSync to listen to your music, share/stream your music via web browser, copy songs from an iPod, iPhone, iPad, etc, sync and backup your data to an external drive, etc. The rest of this section quickly describes how you can sync your Local Library with other types of Remote libraries. It also describes different ways to access your libraries (e.g. via a web browser or via SuperSync across the Internet/WAN).\n\nAdditional Quick Setup Guides\n\nImport tracks and playlists from an iPod or iPhone\n\nUnder the Remote Menu, select \"Connect to iPod or iPhone...\"\n\nConnect an iPod by USB.

(e.g. 12.34.56.78:5360)\n\nSuperSync Quick Setup Wrap Up\n\nWe have now covered the most common way of setting up and using SuperSync. Our next section, The SuperSync Window, describes the SuperSync Window's features and use.\n\nSetup\n\nPreferences\n\nSuperSync's user preferences can be configured from the Preferences window. This window can be accessed by selecting Preferences from SuperSync's FILE menu (Mac) or EDIT menu (Windows) or by clicking the Prefs icon in SuperSync's toolbar.\n\nThis will open the Preferences window:\n\nThe Preference window contains the following tabs:\n\nGeneral Settings\n\nNetwork Settings\n\nProxy Settings\n\nUpload Settings\n\nMeta Update Settings\n\nView Settings\n\nColor Settings\n\nFilter Settings\n\nSchedule Settings\n\nTivo Settings\n\nSuperSync Preferences Wrap Up\n\nSuperSync's Preferences allow you to enable and customize various SuperSync features. In many cases, the defaults for these settings will meet your needs. When you are finished reading this section, proceed to the next section in our manual, Configuring the Local Library.\n\nConfiguring the Local Library\n\nWhen you first launch SuperSync, SuperSync loads a 'Local Library'. This library is what will be used as a source and destination for tracks when Syncing. The Local Library is essential 'your library' and is typically located on your computer or on a hard drive connected to your computer.\n\nBy default, SuperSync uses your iTunes Library as its Local Library. However your Local Library can be set to use other types of libraries. If you plan on using iTunes as your library, you can skip to the Configuring The Remote Library section later in this manual. Otherwise, keep reading to learn about configuring your Local Library...\n\nIf SuperSync didn't find your iTunes library, or if you use another music player, you can follow the instructions below to import your music manually.\n\nTo configure your Local Library, go to SuperSync's LOCAL menu and select the Configure Local Library command. The Configure Local Library will open.\n\nThe Use my iTunes Music Library (recommended) option connects to iTunes and uses its library.\n\nThe Read Media Files From Mass Storage option uses folder/directory on any hard drive (e.g. a folder on your desktop or one on a USB connected hard drive) for the Local Library. When using this option, iTunes syncing features such as meta data (play counts, ratings, etc) are not enabled. Selecting the Next button will take you to a screen where you can specify the folder you want to use.\n\nThe New Music Library On Hard Drive uses an empty folder for your Local Library. The purpose of this option is to use a completely blank library that will receive tracks from a remote library for backup/mirroring purposes. When using this option, iTunes syncing features such as meta data (play counts, ratings, etc) are not enabled. Selecting the Next button will take you to a screen where you can specify the folder you want to use.\n\nImportant Note: For maximum integration with iTunes, set your local library to import and synchronize with iTunes.\n\n[Return to the SuperSync Table of Contents Section in this manual]\n\nConnect to a Remote Library\n\nConfiguring the Remote Library\n\nSuperSync lets you see two music libraries at once - the Local Library and Remote Library. SuperSync connects to a 'Remote Library' and displays its contents side-by-side with the Local Library so that you can choose which tracks need to sync'ed, deleted, modified, etc.\n\nIn most cases, you'll be using the library from another SuperSync computer as your Remote Library. You can configure the Remote Library to different types of libraries such as a folder/directory on a network server, an iTunes Library on your computer but under a different user account, the library on an iPod/iPhone/iPad, or the library on a another computer running SuperSync.\n\nOnce you know what type of library you want to connect to, you can use the Configure Remote Library command (in SuperSync's REMOTE Menu) to set up the connection to that library. This will open the Configure Remote Library window.\n\nSelect Connect to another networked SuperSync server to connect to another computer running SuperSync.\n\nSelect Read media files from mass storage (disk, network drive, etc) to connect a folder/directory that contains your music library.\n\nSelect Read an alternate iTunes Music Library XML File (read-only) to connect to an another iTunes based library via the iTunes XML file. The iTunes XML contains pointers to the actual location of the iTunes as well as meta data about the library such as star rating, play counts, etc.\n\nOnce you select and configure any of the library types listed above, you will be connected to that library and both your Local and Remote Libraries will appear side-by-side in the SuperSync Window. Once your Remote library is open, you can proceed to the Syncing Your Libraries section in this manual.\n\nAdditional Information About Remote Libraries\n\nQuickly Connect To Common Remote Library Types\n\nOnce you know what type of Remote Library you want to connect to, you can skip the Remote Library Configuration screens and use the Connect to... and Read... commands under the REMOTE menu to quickly connect to that type of library.\n\nNote: Before you can connect to another computer running SuperSync, you'll need to enable the server on another SuperSync that is configured with the library you'd like to sync to. To enable the SuperSync server, go to the section on Network Settings under the preferences.\n\nUpdating The Remote Library\n\nIn some cases, changes may be made to the Remote Library while you are viewing it. For example, say you are viewing a Remote Library on another computer and someone on the other computer imports a CD. To view these changes you can either close the connection to the Remote Library (by using the Close Remote Library command under the Remote menu) or you can simply go to SuperSync's Remote menu and select the Rescan Remote Library command. Any changes made to the library since the last rescan are reflected in the library display. This option is not available if a remote library is not connected or available.\n\n[Return to the SuperSync Table of Contents Section in this manual]\n\nConnect to another networked SuperSync server\n\nSuperSync can connect to another computer running SuperSync if that computer has the SuperSync Server enabled.\n\nTo connect to a SuperSync Server over your (LAN) network, you can either:\n\nselect the Connect To Server command from the SuperSync Remote menu.\n\nuse the Configure Remote Library command (in SuperSync's REMOTE Menu) and then select the Connect to another networked SuperSync server option.\n\nThis will open the Connect to Server window that configures the connection to a SuperSync Server.\n\nTo connect to a networked SuperSync server, you need the host name/IP address/domain name, port number, and password (if the Server has a password set). Enter the host name/IP address/domain name in the Host field and, if needed, the server's password in the Password field. Click Next to proceed.\n\nTech Note: If the server is not running on port 5360, the SuperSync default, enter the IP address, a colon, then the port number, such as: 192.168.0.100:5000. In most cases, you will not need to change the SuperSync Server's port but some network administrators and users may want change this for various reasons.\n\nEnable/Check the Remember Username and Password checkbox to connect to this SuperSync Server without having to continuously enter your password information.\n\nTip: Your password data will be saved in a text file in SuperSync's Settings Directory. While the passwords are encoded for protection they can be decoded with some effort. For this reason, we do not recommend you use commonly used passwords for your SuperSync Server passwords.\n\nWhen you have entered the SuperSync Server's info, click the Next button and follow the on-screen instructions to connect to this Remote Library. Note, this window shows all the SuperSync Servers you have connected to so that you can quickly select and connect to a server.\n\nTip: You can connect to a SuperSync Server running on your local network (aka LAN) in one step by selecting that computer in the Connect to LAN server submenu in SuperSync's Remote menu.\n\nTip: Use the \"Check my IP address...\" command under the Tools menu to get your computer's IP address. You can then use this address to connect from another SuperSync computer.\n\nOnce you have connected this library, its contents will appear side-by-side with your Local Library in the SuperSync Window. You can now proceed to the Syncing Your Libraries section in this manual.\n\n[Return to the Configuring the Remote Library Section in this manual]\n\nRemote Library on a Mass Storage Device\n\nSelecting the Read media files from mass storage (disk, network drive, etc) radio option in the Configure Remote Library window opens a window where you can set the location of the Remote Library.\n\nClick Set under Music Library Directory to select this select the folder/directory where your music library is located. To use an create a new music library from scratch, just select an empty folder/directory.\n\nClick Next to continue the remote library configuration process. After clicking Next, a new window appears to give confirmation of any directory changes or to notify you that no directory changes were made. If you wish to select a different directory, click Previous to return to the directory selection window. Clicking Finish (only available from the confirmation window) saves any changes and closes the Remote Library setup and connect to this library.\n\nNote: You can set this library to be a 'Read-Only Library'. This means that SuperSync can 'Put' tracks from this library into your Remote Library but it cannot copy tracks (aka Get) tracks into this library.\n\nOnce you have connected this library, its contents will appear side-by-side with your Local Library in the SuperSync Window. You can now proceed to the Syncing Your Libraries section in this manual.\n\nImport a directory or hard drive into your music library\n\nSelect Configure Remote Library from the Remote menu\n\nSelect Read music/video files from mass storage (disk, network drive, etc.) and click Next\n\nClick Set... to set the hard drive or directory you'd like to import and click Next.\n\nSelect one or more Blue tracks you'd like to import and click \"Synchronize\"\n\nMonitor the Transfer Status Window to see how many files remain to be copied\n\nAfter copying the files SuperSync will also add the files to your iTunes library\n\nWhen finished, close the Remote library.\n\n[Return to the Configuring the Remote Library Section in this manual]\n\nImport Tracks from another iTunes library\n\nSuperSync can compare and retrieve tracks from another iTunes Library that is on a hard drive. You can use SuperSync to merge libraries that are on the same computer (in different accounts) or if you have several old computers with iTunes content, copy the libraries to an external disk and use SuperSync merge them into your main library.\n\nThis feature is useful if you want to import/backup an iTunes library that's on a hard drive or a different iTunes library on a different user account on your computer. For instance, if your spouse has some of your music in their library, you can retrieve tracks and playlists with a few simple steps.\n\nTo do this, use SuperSync to connect to an alternate iTunes XML Library as a remote library. Apple's iTunes creates this XML library and keeps it up to date in each account's Music directory. SuperSync can read the library and help you compare and merge the remote tracks into your SuperSync/iTunes library. iTunes Libraries accessed this way are read-only meaning that you can transfer tracks, playlists, meta data, etc into your library but you will not be able to modify the contents of a remote iTunes library. You can run SuperSync in multiple accounts and connect from one account to another account's library and do two-way syncing, one account at a time.\n\nIf you are going to connect to an iTunes library in another account, see the note below about setting up account permissions.\n\nInstructions\n\nTo access the alternate iTunes XML file, you can either:\n\nselect the Connect To Server command from the SuperSync Remote menu and then select the Read an alternate iTunes Music Library XML File (read-only) option and click next. This will open a screen where you can Set the location of the iTunes XML file connection. Set the location of the XML file and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the connection to this library.\n\nuse the Read iTunes XML command (in SuperSync's REMOTE Menu). This will open a screen where you can Set the location of the iTunes XML file connection. Set the location of the XML file and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the connection to this library.\n\nNote: the iTunes XML file is typically located in the iTunes folder (that is usually in a folder called Music). If you are accessing the file that is another user's account, locate that user's account folder and then find the iTunes or Music folder within the user account folder.\n\nOnce the alternate iTunes library is connected via SuperSync, its contents will appear side-by-side with your Local Library in the SuperSync Window. You can now proceed to the Syncing Your Libraries section in this manual.\n\nNote: iTunes libraries connected this way are read-only. This means that you can transfer track from this library to your Local Library but SuperSync cannot put tracks into this library.\n\nAccount Permissions\n\nAccessing an Alternate iTunes library XML file on a different user account requires that your account have privileges to access the folder/directory where that iTunes XML file and linked music library are located.\n\nAs a security measure, account A can't access the music on account B. However, account B can grant read access privelege to the user of account A. To do this, account B user will need to log in and add A to the list of users who can access the music library.\n\nTo do this, locate the iTunes XML file for account B, and the location of the music directory that the iTunes content resides in.\n\nSelect the parent directory of both files and right-click to \"Get Info\" for the directory. Add read-permission for the user A who you will be allowing access to your music via SuperSync.\n\nIf you want to sync in both directections (allow user B to access user B's music) user A will need to grant read-permission to their music library folder(s) for user B.\n\n[Return to the Configuring the Remote Library Section in this manual]\n\nSynchronizing\n\nSyncing Your Libraries\n\nSynchronizing Tracks\n\nSynchronization is the primary function of SuperSync. It allows you to grab and play music files from different libraries, either locally (on your machine's hard drive) or remotely.\n\nTracks are color coded by SuperSync: Gray=Local Track, Blue=Remote Track, Green=Synchronized (in both)\n\nThe three buttons in the upper right are used to synchronize tracks and playlists:\n\nGet\n\nUse the \"Get\" button (or action) on a Blue (Remote) track to get it from the remote and copy it to your Local (iTunes) library.\n\nPut\n\nUse the \"Put\" button (or action) on a Gray (Local) track to put a copy on the remote library. The remote library can be another SuperSync, a directory of music. Putting is not allowed on \"read-only\" libraries such as iOS devices. Putting tracks to a Remote SuperSync library requires that the upload settings are set to allow track uploads.\n\nSync\n\nThe Sync button acts as a \"Put\" on local unsynchronized tracks, and acts as a \"Get\" on Blue remote tracks. It is the equivalent of pressing the Get and Put buttons and is a handy way to copy any unsynchronized track.\n\nIn all cases, when able, SuperSync makes a physical copy of the track you are getting or putting, making it available in both libraries.\n\niCloud\n\niCloud and iTunes Match users: You'll need to use iTunes to download any tracks that you want to access with SuperSync. We recommend having a master library with all of your cloud tracks downloaded so they can be sync'd with other machines.\n\nSynchronization of Tracks\n\nBlue and Gray tracks can be selected for synchronization by selecting the track and then clicking either the Get, Put, or Sync button in the SuperSync window. You can also access these commands by right-clicking a track and selecting the Get, Put, or Sync actions. Multiple files can be selected in a range by holding down Shift while clicking or by individually added to the selected group by holding down Command (CTRL on Windows) when clicking.\n\nIf the Get, Put, or Sync buttons are disabled (grayed out) and you have selected an unsynchronized track, the synchronize action may not be allowed due to several reasons. Check the \"Selection\" in the Status menu to see an explanation.\n\nDuring the synchronization process, SuperSync copies the selected track(s) into the designated library (Remote or Local depending on which direction the track is being copied). The status of this transfer is displayed in the Transfer Status Window that opens when you begin a Sync action. This window can also be displayed by pressing +T or selecting Transfer Status from SuperSync's File menu.\n\nStep 1:\n\nOpen a remote library from the Remote menu. You should see both libraries overlaid, with tracks color coded by Local Only (Gray), Remote Only (Blue), or Synchronized (Green/Teal).\n\nStep 2:\n\nSelect a Blue (Remote) track and click the \"Get\" button to Transfer it to your Local iTunes library.\n\nSelect a Gray (Local) track and click the \"Put\" button to Transfer it to the remote library. The library must be accessible and writable. (iOS libraries are not modifiable. Remote SuperSync libraries may be set to \"read only\" or disallow Track uploads, a setting that can be changed in the \"Upload Preferences\".)\n\nStep 3:\n\nOnce a track has been synchronized, it should turn green, meaning that it is in both libraries.\n\nVerify that the file you just copied was copied from one library to the other. Make sure it has been saved in the location that you expect.\n\nOnce you are happy with the results of a single \"Get\" or \"Put\" operation, you can select more tracks to \"Sync\". The Sync button will \"Put\" any gray tracks and \"Get\" any blue (remote) tracks.\n\nCAUTION\n\nBefore you Sync multiple tracks, it is highly recommend that you select just one or two tracks to sync. Sync them, and make sure they are going into the other library as you expect.\n\nSetting File Destination\n\nUse the General Settings to set the location of files added to your library by SuperSync.\n\nSynching Multiple Tracks\n\nYou can easily get, put or synchronize multiple tracks at one time. For instance, to sync all tracks by a particular artist, select the name of the artist in the Artist Table and click the Get, Put, or Sync button.\n\nYou can also select all tracks (using Select-All from the Edit Menu). From there, you can click the Get, Put, or Sync buttons. However, we would caution you to only do this after you are an experienced SuperSync user.\n\nLearn More\n\n[Read the Syncing Meta Data Section in this manual]\n\n[Read the Syncing Playlists Section in this manual]\n\n[Return to the SuperSync Table of Contents Section in this manual]\n\nSyncing Playlists\n\nSuperSync helps you sync your playlists from one library to another.\n\nTo get a playlist from a remote library, that library must be open in SuperSync as a Remote Library. Remote libraries that support playlists are SuperSync Networked Libraries.\n\nFirst, make sure that you see the Playlists in the left hand SuperSync Tree. Under the Controls menu, you can make sure that Show Playlists is checked.\n\nColor coding is used to help identify Remote, Local, and Synchronized Playlists.\n\nBlue Playlists , Smart Playlists , and Folders are only on the remote library.\n\nGray Playlists , Smart Playlists , and Folders are only on your local iTunes library.\n\nGreen Playlists , Smart Playlists , and Folders are in both libraries.\n\nSelect a playlist and you'll see the tracks that are in the playlist.\n\nThe three buttons in the upper right are used to synchronize tracks and playlists:\n\nGet\n\nUse the \"Get\" button (or action) on a Blue (Remote) playlist to get it from the remote and copy it to your Local (iTunes) library. Any tracks that are needed will be downloaded first.\n\nPut\n\nUse the \"Put\" button (or action) on a Gray (Local) playlist to put a copy on the remote library. The remote library must be another networked SuperSync library. Putting is not allowed on \"read-only\" libraries such as iOS devices. Putting a playlist to a Remote SuperSync library requires that the upload settings on that machine are set to allow track uploads.\n\nSync\n\nThe Sync button acts as a \"Put\" on local unsynchronized tracks, and acts as a \"Get\" on Blue remote tracks. It is the equivalent of pressing the Get and Put buttons and is a handy way to copy any unsynchronized track.\n\nIf you are replacing the contents of a Playlist that already exists, you will be asked if you want to do so. Always read the \"Are you sure...\" warnings carefully. If you are not sure, say no!\n\nSynchronizing Smart Playlists\n\nSyncing Smart Playlists is covered in the next section.\n\n[Read the Syncing Tracks Section in this manual]\n\n[Return to the SuperSync Table of Contents Section in this manual]\n\nSynchronization Tips\n\nSynchronizing multiple music libraries can be tricky if your music is not well tagged or has come from many different places. Files may be missing identifying tags, some tags may be out of synch, or named slightly differently, or the same album may be encoded different ways. Managing a large library may take several iterations of pruning, copying, checking, and re-importing.\n\nAs a general rule, synchronize a few tracks initially and make sure they transfer to the right location. Click \"Show All\" to force an update... and check that they show up in iTunes, if you're using iTunes.\n\n[Read the Synchronize Meta Data Tips Section in this manual]\n\n[Return to the SuperSync Table of Contents Section in this manual]\n\nSyncing Meta Data\n\nSuperSync has a powerful utility to help track down modified tracks that differ in two libraries. The Meta Data Updater allows you to find tracks that contain the same music data but the meta tags are different.\n\nMeta tags are fields inside a music or video track that describe the data on the track. For instance, album name, artist, genre, track number, disc number, year, composer, etc are all MP3 tags. Ratings and Played Counts is meta data that is only stored by iTunes, but can still be tracked and sync'ed by SuperSync.\n\nExample\n\nYou have one track in two libraries. But in one library, you modify some of the tags -- for instance you correct the spelling of the artist. The next time you connect to both using SuperSync, those two tracks should show as sync 'd with the meta data mismatch flag set.\n\nTo sync the meta data on both libraries, you would select the track that has the meta mismatch flag icon set, and right click on the track (or use the Action menu) to select \"Update Meta Data\". A dialog will let you verify the direction of the tag updates (updating the local or remote library version). Click yes to confirm and the file should be updated in SuperSync and in iTunes in both libraries.\n\nTo see the differences between the tracks, select the track and use the \"Compare Tracks\" under the Action menu. The Compare Tracks feature can be used to compare any two selected tracks, or if only one track is selected, it will let you compare the closest match. Use Get Info to access all similar tracks associated with a track.\n\nThis feature it will modify the tags of your music. Use only on a few tracks at a time and verify the changes are what you expect.\n\nConfiguration\n\nTo use Meta Data Updating, you need to sync between two networked SuperSync applications. Both SuperSync applications must have their Local Library be configured as an iTunes library. An upload password is required, and the \"server\" must be configured to allow remote changes.\n\nConfigure the meta data update feature in SuperSync by going to the Meta Data Settings in the preferences. You can also allow or deny letting remote users modify your meta data in the Upload tab. in the Preferences window.\n\nUsage\n\nFiles that have mismatched meta data will have the icon. Select the track and right-click update meta data or select that from the Action menu.\n\nA dialog will prompt you about what changes you can make:\n\nCarefully go through the list of suggested changes.\n\nSwap lets you change the direction of changes. SuperSync takes a guess as to what changes you want to make but sometimes you'll may want to to manually change which track you're updating.\n\nOnce you are satisfied with the checked items, click the OK button to start the process of updating the tracks. Tracks will either be updated on your local iTunes library, or on the networked remote SuperSync/iTunes library.\n\nIf you want to get more details about a particular track, select the track and click the Update... button. A dialog will display the changes and individual meta tag updates can be enabled or disabled.\n\nSwap lets you change the direction of changes. SuperSync takes a guess as to what changes you want to make but sometimes you'll want to manually change which track you're updating. In the rare case where you want to update some items in one direction and other meta data items in the other direction, you can do this by updating the meta data twice - selecting the items to move by checkbox.\n\nGet Info... to learn more about the two tracks you are working with. One track will be a local iTunes track. The other will be a remote networked SuperSync library.\n\nYes - Initiates the copy of meta data transfer. This will show a progress dialog until it is complete or returns an error message.\n\nNo - Skips this item and does not update anything.\n\nCancel - Exits all meta updates if others were selected for updating.\n\nBe sure to read the warning dialog and confirm your updates carefully. These changes cannot be undone. If you accidentally set the meta data to an incorrect value, you'll need to manually go into iTunes and update the tags from iTunes get Track Info dialog.\n\nUse care when allowing remote updates to your library. Be sure you trust the users who have upload privileges.\n\nIf you are making changes to your one library but do not want to accidentally modify the other library, you can set your library to read-only access in the Meta Data Settings.\n\nSuperSync does not do the actual updating of meta data -- we pass the request to iTunes. If iTunes cannot do it, an error will be returned. Some tracks are not modifiable, so some error messages may be \"normal\".\n\nNote:\n\nThe UPDATE META DATA command is only available when a) two libraries are connected within SuperSync b) a track is in both libraries but some meta data is different (as shown by the meta data icon) and c) at least one of those tracks is selected.\n\nThe easiest way to update these tracks is to first select the META DATA MISMATCH view in the SuperSync Filter Tree, select a track and then select the UPDATE META DATA command from the ACTION menu.\n\n[Return to the SuperSync Table of Contents Section in this manual]\n\nThe Transfer Status Window\n\nThe transfer window is one of the best ways for you to get a picture of what is going to be transferred from one library to another.\n\nIn the transfer window, you'll see the number of tracks to be copied, the size of your library, and the general progress of file transfers. As new files are set to be synchronized, they will be added to either the upload or download queue. Remember, uploading is sending files from the local library to the remote library and downloading is getting music from the remote library and adding it to your local library.\n\nTotal Tracks is the number currently in your library. If transfers are in progress, the total number after all are synchronized.\n\nTotal Size is the current size of your library, and the total size predicted when synchronization is complete. You can use this total size number to help determine how many more tracks can be added to a library of a fixed size.\n\nRemaining shows the number of tracks, bytes, and time remaining for transfers.\n\nSynchronized shows the percentage of synchronized tracks currently in your library. This percent should increase with each track copied.\n\nMusic Directory is the root directory of your libraries, or the IP address of the remote server. Hold the mouse over this field and you'll see a full description of the file path.\n\nFiles Copied shows the number of files successfully transferred and their combined size.\n\nSkipped shows the number of tracks that were skipped, due to a similar duplicate, exact duplicate, or because the receiving SuperSync has upload restrictions\n\nErrors are the number of tracks that did not copy due to some kind of error. This could be a simple communication error that retrying might fix, or it could be the source file is missing, or some other error.\n\niTunes Updates shows the number of tracks needed to be added and or removed from iTunes. When a file is added to a SuperSync library that is linked to your iTunes library, it will need to be added to iTunes. Likewise, when you empty the trash of any local tracks that are in iTunes, they'll need to be removed from iTunes after being deleted from SuperSync. To pause iTunes updates, select File > Pause iTunes Updates from the application menu .\n\nServer Updates shows the number of tracks needed to be added and or removed from your SuperSync server, if enabled. Server updates help keep the library on your disk in sync with the library that is accessible via the network. To pause server updates, select File > Pause Server Updates from the application menu .\n\nThe commands available in the Transfer Window help you manage your synchronization process.\n\nYou can Pause and Resume the synchronization process. The pause command will pause uploads and downloads. (If you want to pause iTunes Updates, you'll need to do that under the File > Pause iTunes Updates menu.)\n\nThe Clear Copied button lets you clear successfully copied files from the table of copy operations.\n\nThe Clear Skipped button clears all tracks in the transfer table that were skipped.\n\nThe Clear Errors button clears all transfers that did not complete due to any type of error.\n\nTo automatically clear successful transfers, enable the Auto Clear check button. This keeps the window free from items that should not need your attention.\n\nEach item in the table can be right-clicked to get further information and access additional commands. The first command is \"Get Info\" (to show transfer details and status, plus the standard track information.) Retry lets you schedule a transfer for another attempt. You can also Remove any individual transfer.\n\nindicates files that are being sent to your designated new music directory. The Upload Synchronize Queue reflects the status of files being uploaded to the remote server. Both transfers can be paused by clicking the Pause button. Pausing the queue will pause further processing after a file finishes copying.\n\nWhen a file has been synchronized (existing on both local and remote libraries), it appears in the main viewer window with a green sphere in the Source column.\n\nIf a remote library does not support uploads (read-only) then the upload queue will be unavailable. Read-only libraries include imports from read-only media (CD/DVD media), iPods, and DAAP servers that have uploading disabled. Currently, only SuperSync supports DAAP music uploads.\n\n[Return to the SuperSync Table of Contents Section in this manual]\n\nSetting Up NAS Access\n\nNAS Overview\n\nInstall and Configure SuperSync for NAS\n\nDownload and Install\n\nSuperSync for many NAS systems is available to download from the SuperSync.com web site. However, some NAS systems have their own update mechansim and are available through the web interface.\n\nIf you downloaded the SuperSync for NAS application, use your NAS's application installer to install or upgrade SuperSync.\n\nSee Installation Notes for more details.\n\nConfigure\n\nThe set of instructions to configure SuperSync Server are common for all the NAS systems. Hence, all NAS users should follow the steps below.\n\nSuperSync Server intelligently integrates with NAS to automatically identify your music directories on NAS. However, you can also manually configure the same through the admin interface of SuperSync Server.\n\nThe web admin interface of SuperSync Server allows you to:\n\nCheck SuperSync Server status\n\nModify media location\n\nChange Admin Password\n\nSet Read/Write Access\n\nAccess logs for troubleshooting\n\nTo access the Web Admin Interface, once the SuperSync server is installed on your NAS, follow the steps below:\n\nClick on the SuperSync Icon on the NAS Dashboard. It should open the SuperSync Server Web Music Player\n\nClick on the Admin Tab\n\nThe default username and password is admin/admin\n\nTo Check SuperSync Server Status, Click Status\n\nTo Modify Media location, click on Media\n\nTo change admin password, click Password\n\nThe first time you run SuperSync on your NAS, it will do a library rescan. This can take a while, and you'll see the progress of the scan in the Admin page.\n\nPasswords\n\nThe default username is admin and the default password is admin.\n\nSetting passwords for SuperSync is used to protect access to your media library.\n\nThere are two types of passwords: SuperSync application, and web passwords. The first type is used when you connect from the SuperSync desktop to the NAS SuperSync. Web Passwords allow users to access the web player and web admin pages.\n\nIf you lose your password, you'll need to reset it. One way is to delete the SuperSync app from your NAS and re-install it. However, you'll all settings (but not your media files.) You can also delete the SuperSync etc/users.json file using the Terminal. This is somewhat advanced and requires terminal access to the NAS and command line experience. Roughly, the steps are:\n\nStop SuperSync on the NAS using the app manager\n\nEnable SSH on your the NAS using the settings or control panel page.\n\nLaunch Terminal (on OS X) or Putty (Windows) or any SSH terminal program\n\nConnect to your NAS using your admin user/pass for the system.\n\nRun the command: find / -name users.json\n\nThis should return a full path for the file. On QNAP, it might be: /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/.qpkg/SuperSync/etc/users.json\n\nCopy the full path and type: rm then paste. For instance, on QNAP it would be:\n\nrm /share/CACHEDEV1_DATA/.qpkg/SuperSync/etc/users.json\n\nRestart the SuperSync app on the NAS and log in with admin/admin\n\nAccessing & Managing iTunes music\n\nThe set of instructions to configure SuperSync Server are common for all the NAS systems. Hence, all NAS users should follow the steps below.\n\nCopy, Sync & Manage iTunes music on NAS using SuperSync Server\n\nTo access, copy and manage iTunes music on NAS from your local Windows and Mac, you need the Desktop version of SuperSync.\n\nConnect from the desktop SuperSync to the NAS SuperSync and you can instantly see which tracks are on the NAS, which are on your desktop, and which are in both and \"synchronized\". The missing tracks can be transferred either ways.\n\nSuperSync Server and SuperSync Desktop communicate smartly and intuitively with each other within your local network to automate and simplify your entire iTunes music management within the network.\n\nThe SuperSync Desktop version on your PCs and Macs, along with SuperSync Server on NAS, allows you to:\n\nEffortlessly put all your iTunes music on your NAS\n\nEasily Sync, Transfer, Merge, Manage iTunes music and libraries with all computers and laptops\n\nCreate a common master library/music repository for all your iTunes music\n\nAccess as you want, Wherever you want\n\nTo Copy, Sync & Manage iTunes music on NAS from your local Windows and Mac computers, follow the steps below:\n\nInstall SuperSync Server on your NAS. Follow installation instructions to install SuperSync Server to your NAS.\n\nDownload and install SuperSync Desktop version on all your Macs and PCs.\n\nLaunch SuperSync Desktop version on the computer you want to access the music from NAS.\n\nClick on the Remote tab at the top menu of your SuperSync Desktop\n\nClick on SuperSync Server option. Your NAS SuperSync Server would be listed there, named as SuperSync. Click on SuperSync.\n\nYour desktop SuperSync is now Connected to SuperSync Server on your NAS.\n\nFrom the connected computer, you can: Sync, Merge, Transfer, Repair, Get Tracks, Upload Tracks from your local music library to the NAS.\n\nLearn more about the Sync-Merge-Manage process of SuperSync Desktop.\n\nYou can also directly Sync-Merge-Manage your iTunes music across your desktop/laptop computers using the respective SuperSync Desktop versions.\n\nIf you have any questions, need help understanding the process or have a generic query, please feel free to contact our support team.\n\nShared Network drive Setup\n\nUsing a shared network drive for iTunes is a good way to have multiple computers share a common music library. However, some care should be used to get the best experience out of iTunes and SuperSync.\n\nTwo types of users can share music from the shared drive. At least one master library user is needed for full NAS access by both user types.\n\nMaster Library Users have their main iTunes library pointing to a shared network drive. All Master Library users will have access to all of the tracks on the disk.\n\nSubset Library Users have a subset of the Master library on their computer and do not access the network drive directly within iTunes. This type of user is good for laptop users, since you want to keep access to your network library when you're not connected to the network drive. Subset library users can get and put music to the master library over a network.\n\nMaster Library User Setup\n\nTo begin, you'll need to have a network drive that is accessible by all machines that you want to have complete access to the master library. We recommend using a NAS that has AFP and/or SMB support. The drive should automatically connect on reboot (See final notes below if it doesn't).\n\nIn iTunes, set the library location to point to the directory on the NAS where you have your media library. To do this, go to iTunes, Edit Preferences, click on the Advanced tab, then change the \"iTunes Music Folder\" location. In the screen image below, we have the NAS mapped to the \"G:\\\" drive, however on a Mac it can be a network URL or other mapped network location.\n\nIf you have your library pointing to your default music directory, you may need to move the content to the new location. Warning: once you change the location of your library, moving the tracks to the new drive location may cause you to lose your playlists, ratings, play counts, and other iTunes specific meta data. However, selecting the checkbox \"Automatically keep my Library Organized\" in iTunes may help.\n\nOnce this is complete, run SuperSync and go to File: Local Library Info. Verify that Kind is set to iTunes and Music Directory is set to the location of your network drive and directory.\n\nNext, you may want to do a File: \"Local Library Rescan\". Verify the results and make any recommended changes you wish.\n\nYou can repeat this process on multiple computers around the office or house that you want to act as Master Library Users.\n\nRescan Often\n\nAt this point, the only problem is that when tracks are added to or removed from the network drive by any computer or user, those changes will not automatically show up in all the other user's iTunes.\n\nAny time music is added or removed to/from the network drive, a Rescan Local Library will be required on each computer that is running as a master user and has an out of date iTunes. The rescan feature can be run manually as needed or can be scheduled to run periodically. We recommend doing it manually and always make sure the network drive is attached and online.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nIf you have multiple \"master library\" machines connected to the same network drive as described above, you should not transfer tracks between the two libraries using SuperSync's Remote Network access. This is because both machines are pointing to the same drive location, so copying files could result in duplicates, especially if either computer has not recently been rescanned. Instead, local rescans should be used to find new music added to the network drive. You can still use SuperSync to connect to a remote library that points to a completely different networked SuperSync library, or connect to another disk drive or iPod.\n\nSynching Playlists Between Master Libraries\n\nAdvanced users who are careful can attempt to sync playlists as a remote share. To do this, connect to a master library using SuperSync's Remote Network access.\n\nDO NOT SYNC TRACKS IF BOTH MACHINES ARE SET TO USE THE SAME NETWORK DRIVE.\n\nHowever, if the tracks are synchronized, you can select a preset and \"get\" it or \"put\" it.\n\nSubset Library Users\n\nHaving a subset of the music from the master is ideal for users who don't want to have all the music from the NAS on their computer. If you've got a laptop, you almost certainly want to set your library up as a subset of the master.\n\nRunning iTunes as a subset of the master library requires no additional setup on iTunes. iTunes should have your library location in the default location or somewhere on a local hard drive.\n\nNext step is to load SuperSync and make sure that your local library type is set to iTunes and your library location is correct from the File: Local Library Info... dialog.\n\nTo connect to the NAS drive, there are two ways. Connect to Remote Networked SuperSync library, or set the remote library up as a disk-based Remote library.\n\nThe recommended way is to connect to another remote networked SuperSync on the LAN that is set up as a master user. (See above!) This allows you to quickly connect to the master library and access iTunes specific information, including playlists, ratings, and video information. To connect to a master library, go to the Remote->Connect to a LAN Server menu. If you need to, you can also connect to the server by entering the IP address of the server into the Connect to Server... dialog. The remote machine you are connecting to must be running the SuperSync server and firewalls may need to be modified to allow SuperSync traffic.\n\nThe second method of accessing the music on the NAS is to set the remote library as a disk share under the Remote->Configure Remote Library... dialog.. Point SuperSync to the location of your NAS media directory. Clicking Finish will import the tracks from the NAS into SuperSync. From there, tracks can be added to your library or uploaded to the NAS using the standard synchronization techniques.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOne question we get a lot: Can I have set up a computer with both types of libraries - so that I have a full time connection to my music when I'm at home, but also have a subset of music for when I take my laptop out of the house? The answer is.. sort of! You could use iTunes support for multiple libraries.. Or connect to the master library using Apple's \"Home Sharing\".\n\nOne tip we can share is that sometimes when you reboot a computer, the network share is offline. When you start iTunes with it pointing to the offline directory, iTunes won't be able to find your music. To prevent this, you can create an alias (or Windows shortcut) of your iTunes application, save it somewhere on the network drive, then use that to start your application. If your hard drive is offline, your Mac or PC should prompt you to connect the drive!\n\n[Return to the SuperSync Table of Contents Section in this manual]\n\n[Return to the Troubleshooting Section in this manual]\n\nAnalyze and Repair\n\nSuperSync Library Overview\n\nThe Library Overview Window is accessed from the File menu, or -B, and provides an overview of one or two of your libraries.\n\nOn the left is your local (usually iTunes) library. On the right is the Remote library, if open.\n\nHover over any statistics and you'll see a description of the filter, how many matches there are, and how many tracks can be synchronized.\n\nClick on a statistic and matching will be displayed in the main window. The Get, Put and Sync buttons will be updated to work on the tracks visible in the Main Window.\n\nBefore doing synchronizing, we recommend you Analyze and Repair your library and Remove Duplicates.\n\nActions\n\nAnalyize and Repair lets you scan your local library for tracks that are missing and broken tracks.\n\nClose Remote Library lets you quickly close a library, so you can compare and merge a second library.\n\nGet Tracks - Gets unsynchronized Remote tracks that are displayed in the Main Window.\n\nPut Tracks - Puts unsynchronized Local tracks to the Remote library from the Main Window.\n\nSynchronize Tracks - Gets and Puts unsynchronized tracks.\n\nCloud Setup or Cloud Overview - are for users of iTunes Match users.\n\nRescanning your Library\n\nAny time a track gets moved, added, or deleted, there is a chance that your libraries (as maintained by iTunes) may be out of sync with what is actually in the library. For example, if you move a folder full of songs into a library outside of iTunes or if you manually delete some tracks from your music library folder outside of iTunes, iTunes will not know about these changes and neither will SuperSync. This causes 'orphan tracks'. If you try to play or view a track that is not there/orphaned, the track will be marked as \"Not there\" and it won't be played.\n\nSuperSync's Rescan Local Library looks for these changes and updates your Local Library (and iTunes if your Local Library is set to iTunes) with the changes.\n\nTo use this feature, go to SuperSync's LOCAL menu and select the Rescan Local Library command. This will open the Rescan Options window.\n\nSet the 'Add New Tracks To Library', 'Delete Links To Missing Tracks', and 'View and Confirm Changes' checkboxes and then click the the Start Rescan button.\n\nRescanning a Local Library will take some time depending in the size of your library.\n\nNote: We recommend that you enable/check the 'View and Confirm Changes' check box the first time you use this feature.\n\n[Return to the SuperSync Table of Contents Section in this manual]\n\nRemoving Duplicates\n\nRemoving duplicates is one of the most common frustrations of managing a large collection of music.\n\nSuperSync offers several tools to compare tracks and remove duplicates.\n\nRemoving Tracks by adding them to the SuperSync trash and/or deleting them from iTunes involves the risk of losing a track you wanted to keep. Always back up your library and proceed with caution when adding tracks to the trash or removing them from iTunes.\n\nThe SuperSync tools for duplicate removal are: Duplicate Flags filters, Track Comparison Dialog, and \"Remove Duplicates...\"\n\nDuplicate Flags Filters\n\nOn the left hand tree, you should see a group of filters called \"Duplicates\". If you don't see them, enable the \"Show Filters\" from the Status Menu.\n\nSelect a filter to view the tracks that match. The two numbers in parenthesis show the counts for the local, remote libraries.\n\nFile Duplicates Displays tracks that are duplicates based on file size, CRC, format, etc.\n\nThere may be some file duplicates that you do not want to remove, for instance, iTunes Match will often return the exact same song when the song is on two albums (e.g. a Greatest Hits album and the original). Here your library will contain two bit-for-bit copies of the music, but the tags will have two different albums listed. In that case, deleting the duplicate is not recommended, so that you can keep your albums complete.\n\nFormat Duplicates are tracks appear to be in both AAC and MP3 format. Some people want to have both an MP3 and AAC format, but some people only want one or the other, or the highest bitrate version available.\n\nSupe"
