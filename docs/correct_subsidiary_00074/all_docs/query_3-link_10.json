        "text": "State of the Tivo:<BR><BR>TiVo doesn't make any money on the hardware, their reference designs are licensed for (pretty much) free. Licensees can use the factories Tivo already has relationships with or set up their own production line. They're also allowed to make hardware improvements, though few do, and most just use the reference designs from an existing production line and twiddle with the case colors.<BR><BR>Tivo Series 2 hardware profile has changed remarkably little in the years it has been out. No addt'l memory. No built-in ethernet. Indeed the USB performance of the latest variations is worse then previous models. <BR><BR>There are Tivo/DVD players and Tivo/VHS players but those are trivial add-ons. There is a DirecTV HD model but it is soon to be obsoleted as DirectTV changes satellites and encoding methodologies. Tivo has demo'd HD Tivos for years but their integration with cable boxes has been problematic and the CableCard 1 spec. was unsuitable, now hopes are on for more once CableCard 2 is out.<BR><BR>On the other hand Tivos software is remarkably standardized & stable. Several years ago it was rebuilt so any Series 2 software could run on any Series 2 box. Thus while DirectTV hasn't passed on the latest system softwares to their DirecTivos it's a pretty easy hack to self-install it and get all of the latest features.<BR><BR>What is really odd about this, in a world where hardware & software versions bump almost daily and every season brings a new round of implementations, is that Tivo bought out startup Strangeberry, and got it's uber-programmer Arthur van Hoff (a legend at Sun, founder at Marimba) & team, and nothing has really shipped from them in the nearly 2 years since.<BR><BR>Strangeberry was, by most accounts, working on a streaming media device that could handle and distribute disparate sources and destinations. The coders were well-known Java folks. Tivo does have their HMO software, which is now an automatic free upgrade to much of their hardware base, but that development *preceded* the Strangeberry purchase. Since then, little attributable to that has shown up.<BR><BR>There is a 2nd generation HMO hidden on most Tivo's; with improved APIs, sound & pictures at the same time are now possible, but formats are still minimal and performance is lackluster. The Tivo clients are also bare-bones, indeed their Mac client broke with the MacOS X \"Tiger\" update months ago and though 3rd parties have devised work-arounds Tivo has never bothered to update their software.<BR><BR>There has been some interesting action on the community software front. The Galleon server is able to offer up email, RSS, movie times, weather, webcams, etc. to the Tivo. But it remains a great 3rd party product showing what can by done with a Tivo, not what Tivo is doing.<BR><BR>Oh, there was a Tivo-To-Go thing about porting Tivo-video to handhelds & the like but that has been wholly eclipsed by the video iPod. And, as noted, Tivos software on the Mac has been broken for months. So after hoops it can go to the shrinking PocketPC market - woo hoo. (Yes, there are hacks, but nothing iTunes-easy)<BR><BR>The same with Tivos head-end. Tivo-Central is still a craptacular interface that coulda been coded by an entry-level intern. The promised downloads-from-Netflix have been dropped after content licensing issues. Scheduling integration with Yahoo! is nice but of little interest to most.<BR><BR>So what does TiVo have to offer for Buying-Season-'05? Discounts. <BR><BR>No new hardware on the horizon. Unable to manage HD due to the locked-in cable systems they await a usable interface. No Series 3 hardware/capability upgrade in sight. A retrofitted Tivo-lite interface due on Comcast DVR boxes next year. Still the best interface, still the most reliable, but keeping up with the competition? Hardly.<BR><BR>(My dream? Apple licensing Tivo's patents, coming out with a Mac Mini-esque Media Center with DVR, Asterisk VOIP, editing, web-interfaces, scaled streaming to mobile devices, iTunes Store & DSS downloads, etc. But that'd just be using Tivos huge patent library & created market, nothing really \"Tivo\".)\n\nI paid the lifetime subscription just because I figured I would recoup my costs in less than 3 years. I'm almost through the first year and to some extent wonder if I made a good choice.<BR><BR>After two months my DirecTV receiver autoupdated it's firmware and broke channel changing via serial cable on all local channels below 100; back to the slow IR blaster I went. I delt with customer service drones for an hour and then gave up. Tivo blames DirecTV and DirecTV either doesn't even know what you're talking about or blames Tivo. <BR><BR>As others pointed out Tivo's software is crap, their hardware suffers from lagging, and there is no ethernet even on the revision two models! I have mine plugged into ethernet with the USB adapter, but I'm hosed still because it's only USB 1.1 <BR><BR>All of these things have been surprises along the way and leave a bitter taste in my mouth. I haven't heard of Tivo doing anything to appease their customer base.<BR><BR>You would think they could introduce a new hardware line, give existing customers a sweet subscription deal on upgrading... Hell for new kickass hardware and upgrading my subscription for say.. 50-100 bucks for the lifetime.. I might do it."
