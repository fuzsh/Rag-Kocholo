        "text": "They’re weapons in the war on terrorism. They’re tools for patrolling the US-Mexico border. They’re trackers of drug smugglers.\n\nIncreasingly, military agencies, government agencies and universities in the US are employing drones — small, nimble unmanned aircraft — to put eyes in the sky for an array of purposes. But as sexy as drones are, one expert suggests that we shouldn’t be fixated so much on the aircraft itself but on the capabilities of the aircraft.\n\n“It’s not about the drone. It’s about information. It’s about data. Drones are there to collect information,” said Sean Varah, CEO of MotionDSP, which provides software that dissects data from videos shot with drones.\n\n“It’s the processing of the information they collect that’s actually the interesting [part],” he added. “You put up a drone in the air not because you want to play around with your remote-control drone.”\n\nRather, someone sends a drone into the air to answer a question or solve a problem. One question could be, “How can we better monitor drought conditions?” To get that answer, a government agency or a university might dispatch a drone to gather data about water supplies in local lakes, rivers and streams — data that could be hard to collect on foot or from a helicopter.\n\n“Drones can get to places that humans can’t,” Varah said, “or they can get there in a much safer way than people can.”\n\nOne drone use that’s gaining ground: search-and-rescue operations carried out by public safety agencies. For instance, a drone can aid in the hunt for a missing child in the rough terrain of a national park.\n\n“Search and rescue is a very good example of something that drones can be very good at,” Varah said.\n\nThat’s why the Austin Fire Department in Texas teamed up last year with researchers at Texas A&M University. The department and the university are testing the use of drones for emergency response, including search-and-rescue missions.\n\n“In the future, I see this technology as being part of every fire department’s response protocol. Robotics will augment the capabilities of emergency response and provide confirmation that this technology is worth the attention it deserves,” said Richard Davis, assistant chief of the fire department.\n\nRecently, Varah’s company announced it’s collaborating with several drone research sites in the US that are studying how to apply this technology to the public safety, oil and gas, agriculture, health and wildlife sectors. Those sectors are beginning to embrace technology that’s been prevalent in the military for about 10 years, Varah said.\n\n“Only in this past year have they become really commonplace. It’s a really new thing,” he said.\n\nAcknowledging the “very valid” privacy concerns raised by drone critics, Varah said, “I’ve seen all the good things you can do with aircraft that have cameras. … You can really help people, and that’s what I’m looking forward to.”\n\nAs this technology evolves and more users adopt it, he added, “These drones are going to provide a much richer source of information for us.”\n\nClick here to register for NAB Show.\n\nThought Gallery Channel:\n\nThought Leaders\n\nYears of video are recorded and uploaded to the cloud each day to sites like YouTube, Vine, and Facebook from devices like mobile phones, personal drones, or home surveillance cameras. With the new capabilities of computer vision technology, we have the ability to mine this visual data to get valuable insights about what’s happening in the world. However, video content has largely been ignored in the conversation about big data.\n\nVideo as a data source has the power to give us information about how people interact with the world around them unlike any other data source. Video provides real-time data about behavior happening in the present, not just the past — whether it’s traffic patterns for the commute in and out of San Francisco or what time most kids get home from school in Palo Alto, California.\n\nVideo data stored in the cloud is exploding. Nest, Google’s internet of things investment, just bought Dropcam, a home security camera company. Silicon Valley companies are building fleets of satellites that will orbit the earth and be able to take thousands of high resolution photos or record video for up to 90 seconds of any spot, and revisit that spot several times per day. Inexpensive consumer drones like the DJI Phantom are selling in the thousands per week. Much of that data captured by these technologies is being uploaded to public sites such as YouTube where anyone can access them.\n\nHow can we extract value from all this video, in the way that we do from other “big data” sources?\n\nTo move forward, we have to get past our current fixation on the devices — drones being the largest example — and focus on the software that will extract the useful data they collect, and the answers that can come from that data. To find these answers we need to have a way to mine video content for data.\n\nUntil now, extracting intelligence from video content has mostly “manual,” through human observation — literally, a human watching the video and writing down what is happening. Think about a documentary filmmaker “logging” their footage, marking down interesting occurrences in the video, what they are, and when they occur. This was the process for police and FBI who mined hours of surveillance video collected after the Boston Marathon Bombings to find moments where the bombers passed the cameras.\n\nTo make video data into useful big data, we need to leap beyond this. We need true video analytics, powered by computer vision. Current search technology looks at the metadata stored with videos — like tags you include when you upload a YouTube video (“science”, “kids,” “cat dancing” or other keywords). Or, some sites use still image techniques (like classification) to find objects, cars, or company logos in videos. True video analytics involves using computer vision algorithms to analyze video pixels automatically, and over time — not only identifying objects in the scene, but also tracking their movements and behavior. With true video analytics you can track patterns of movement of hundreds of objects in the scene, as well as their size, shape, speed, and direction of movement.\n\nTo see the influence that data gathered from video would have, let’s take a mundane government question like, “Is it worth it to invest in new infrastructure to address traffic issues in the Bay Area?” Here in Burlingame, local citizens wanted a new crosswalk built across a busy intersection. The town had to employ a full-time person to stand and manually count every adult and child that crossed that intersection over a week — in order to measure how many citizens would benefit from that investment. This could have been accomplished with a single surveillance camera and video analytics, measuring people (adults, kids), and vehicles, turning the data into something that is actionable (and provides good ROI).\n\nWe could assess things like how many, and what type of vehicles are using a new highway overpass? Were the tax breaks given to the company who asked for it worth it? Is the local sewage facility operating within regulations? Are there sewage outflows after heavy rains? How big are they?\n\nOver the longer term, as video analytics of aerial or space data become more widely accessible, it will change the way we understand the world. It will give everyone access to the data that, until recently, only militaries and intelligence agencies had at their disposal. It will let everyone see for themselves what is really happening around the world and disrupt the current notion of the big data revolution. This is true freedom of information and it is on the horizon.\n\nThought Gallery Channel:\n\nThought Leaders\n\nPictured Above: The DJI Phanton 2 Vision + is a popular experimental camera platform for non-commercial video production. Photo courtesy DJI.\n\nMulticopters may prove to be the most game-changing newsgathering and production tool since the pneumatic microwave mast.\n\nMere weeks after a quadcopter crashed on the White House lawn, several drones said to be quadcopters were seen over landmarks in Paris France including the Eiffel Tower and the US embassy. Let’s start by acknowledging that drones are in and on the news and it’s not always good. As uncomfortable as drones can make a lot of people feel, they also promise to be a powerful and game-changing tool useful for many groups of professionals from farmers to video production companies and newsrooms. And, they’re fun to learn about and fly.\n\nRight now, if you want a velvet smooth 6’-150’ live pedestal-up camera shot during a scene you either need a real helicopter with an expensive gyro-stabilized camera mount or a giant jib arm. Once government decides how to govern a rapidly expanding drone population while maintaining public safety, the cost of all the hardware needed to create that same live scene will drop to about half the price of a nice new camera tripod system.\n\nWhen legal, producers and directors can get fabulous shots with significantly more flexibility and control, at HD, 4K or better resolutions on a camera platform that costs pennies to launch and operate. Compared to an average helicopter jet fuel consumption rate of about 30 GPH, and paying the pilot, who passes along maintenance fees, licensing fees, hangar fees, the cost of the camera, gyro-mount, and travel time, it doesn’t take many helicopter hours to pay for a squadron of always-ready rechargeable drones that shoot and transmit HD or UHD to local receivers. We’ve all seen small cameras fixed atop ENG microwave masts. News drones are an exponential improvement to that concept.\n\nThe problem for right now is that it’s not legal to fly a drone in the USA for commercial purposes. A few one-time commercial drone flight permissions have been granted but are quite rare. However, in the USA many indicators imply the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is preparing to ease up on commercial drone-flying requirements and restrictions and lead with some needed rules and guidance specific to small commercial drones. While broadcasters are among many businesses that could benefit from new rulings, permissions and requirements, imagine the congestion problems as affordable private and commercial drones proliferate.\n\nThe Syma X5 is nearly standard size quadcopter and an excellent basic flight trainer.\n\nCue the 400’ tsunami\n\nNot intended as legal advice, but at this moment the key general flight rule to follow is to never fly in or near controlled airspace, such as an airport. Flying below 400’ in unrestricted airspace feet for fun but not money is not a U.S. federal offense. However, people’s attitudes and local laws vary. Some cities, areas and events ban drone flights outright.\n\nIn areas where there are no drone bans, pilots still risk prosecution for reckless endangerment and/or obstruction of police or emergency services (both felonies), and/or invasion of privacy, which could be upgraded to a federal offense.\n\nAre you insured for drone flight liability? Do not assume your auto, home, professional or company insurance will cover any injury or property damage claims or lawsuits should you have a drone accident. In other words, be careful where you fly and what and who you fly over. Learn, experiment, play and have fun, stay mindful, responsible, cool and professional, and don’t use the images commercially.\n\nA drone is loosely defined as any remotely guided unmanned aircraft or vessel. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) typically describes an airborne drone too small for a person to ride in. Many UAVs are fixed wing aircraft built to travel long distances at higher speeds, built primarily for military missions such as remote surveillance or to blow things up.\n\nA more public-friendly subset of UAVs are multicopters, which include tricopters, quadcopters, pentacopters, heaxcopters, and octocopers. Sometimes they’re called a sUAS (Small Unmanned Aircraft System). In this article, all will be generically referred to as quadcopters because right now, that’s what most are. Regardless of the number of rotors and size, quadcopters are all birds of a feather so to speak, because they are specifically designed to be ultra-stable, ultra-mobile aerial platforms that are ultra-easy to fly. Last century, Sci-fi writers and dreamers called this concept a skyhook.\n\nThe CX-10 is called the world’s smallest quadcopter and it flies like the big ones.\n\nA car is a car\n\nFiats compare to Ferraris the way the operational features, controls and flight characteristics of “toy” quadcopters compare with their most expensive and exotic quadcopter counterparts under manual control. If you can start and drive one, you can start and drive the other. They just respond and handle a little differently.\n\nThe flight control learning curve is like learning to ride a bicycle. Adding a camera is like learning to ride a Harley after mastering a bicycle. Some high-end quadcopter systems, (we can’t say “professional” quadcopter because that would imply illegal activity) are available with an extra hand controller unit to allow a second operator to control the camera.\n\n“Toy” quadcopters are quite practical for live learning. Without an on-board camera they are an easily replaceable real-time training device. “Toy” quadcopters sell for prices so low that nearly anyone can afford to practice and learn by trial and error. A worst-case learning disaster with a 5 ounce “toy” quadcopter might result in USD $50 worth of damage, tops. Don’t belittle the word “toy.” In the eyes of current federal law, all legally operating quadcopters are toys.\n\nFun Fact: Most small “toy” quadcopters are pre-programmed to do one-button, in-flight flips and rolls that have nothing to do with cameras.\n\nThe Hubsan X4 is another inexpensive quadcopter training device. Note: It uses the battery connector for an on-off switch.\n\nInexpensive quadcopters are available from multiple sources, mostly on the Internet. Prices for complete quadcopter ready-to-fly systems with controller and charger start around USD $20. It won’t come with camera at that price but you can learn how to fly a generic quadcopter platform for the price of dinner. Several larger and more stable camera-less models from various manufacturers are available at Amazon.com and other sources for under USD $60.\n\nAnother digit takes you to the higher-end of the camera-less quadcopter world. For about USD $600 you can purchase one of the most popular and sophisticated quadcopters designed for video production and aerial photography in the world, a DJI Phantom 2 (without a camera or gimbal). A gimbal and camera such as a GoPro can be added later although at that point there are more high-end quad and octocopters to investigate.\n\nA camera and gimbal added to a DJI Phantom 2 would fit between the landing gear. In a crash, the landing gear is the only protection for the camera and gimbal.\n\nQuadcopters and accessories often ship directly from Asia and can require a few weeks for delivery. The parts that are most frequently damaged during flight are the blades and blade guards. Order extras when ordering a quadcopter and keep them on hand so training isn’t interrupted by a learning experience. Spare parts are inexpensive but they may take a month or more to get.\n\nDanger, danger\n\nEven the tiniest 4.2 ounce $20 toy quadcopter can be dangerous. Sharp, rapidly-spinning quadcopter blades can bruise or cut skin, or seriously damage an eyeball. Nearly all quadcopters are powered by ultra-lightweight Lithium Polymer (LiPo) power cells. LiPo cells produce the large amount of sustained current needed for the brushless motors without adding much weight. They can get hot. Improperly charging LiPo batteries or a short circuit can cause a fire. Most quadcopters include built-in over-current protection in case a blade jams or collides, but a few have been reported to catch fire when overloaded.\n\nQuadcopters achieve airborne stability with pairs of props pitched in opposite directions. Although a quadcopter may appear to float in the air, it has no fixed wings and it glides like a dumbbell. One can drop from the sky for a number of reasons, usually related to operator confusion, distraction or error. They’ve also been attacked and taken down by eagles and hawks.\n\nA fully loaded quadcopter system can weigh as much as a two liter bottle of pop. The more a quadcopter system costs and weighs, the harder it crashes and the more likely it will be to cause serious expensive damage and injury to what it hits, and to the craft, landing gear, camera and gimbal. Quadcopters come pre-programmed to auto-land or return to home by GPS and land when its battery runs low but they aren’t exactly fail-safe. Clearly, collision avoidance and fail-safe operation is where the technology is headed. Imagine what that will bring.\n\nThis personal squadron for fun and training cost less than $150.\n\nRight now, it’s safest to start learning indoors with a smaller and lighter “toy” first so nobody gets hurt. Consider it learning to drive a stick shift in a parking lot. GPS, cameras, gimbals and camera controls and automatic navigation will come with time. For now, let’s start with basic quadcopter principles and piloting.\n\nQuadcopter Phraseology\n\nA few quadcopter-centric acronyms and unique features help explain the technology. FPV is First Person View, meaning the remote operator can observe live video from an on-board video camera. Like everything video, FPV quality improves with budget.\n\nESC is the acronym for Electronic Speed Controller. An ESC is used to separately control the speed of each motor. The Flight Control System is a network of controls that allow the remote operator to pilot the craft by ESC. It may be a single chip or a system integrating a gyroscope, accelerometer, barometric altimeter and GPS system to track movement and/or hold position. When the integrated package is housed in single unit it’s sometimes called the IMU (Inertial measurement unit).\n\nSome advanced Flight Control Systems include pre-programmed GPS flight points and flight memories. This allows not only repetition, but it can fully automate autonomous operation without the need of remote RF signal control.\n\nWithout or without RF control, three basic technologies make quadcopters possible: ESCs, LiPo batteries and multi-axis gyroscopes. Most quadcopter gyroscopes are 6-axis — forward/back, up/down, left/right, pitch, yaw, and roll. Pitch, yaw and roll describe rotation about the three perpendicular axes. More technologies such as active GPS positioning, active optical or sonar altitude control, lightweight broadcast microwave transmitters, lightweight 4K cameras and efficient 360 degree camera gimbals make serious quadcopters seriously useful newsgathering and production tools.\n\nMost quadcopter remote controllers operate in the 2.4 GHz Bluetooth band. Controller distance ends at about 25-50 yards for toys. Better systems can range 1000 yards or so, depending on conditions. Most RF video backhaul distances will be less. Most quadcopter RF control systems are at 4 or 6-channel, meaning you can fly in the same area with a few other quadcopters operating at 2.4 GHz.\n\nPre-flight Briefing\n\nAs we prepare for our first flight, you might have noticed that the printed instruction translations that came with your quadcopter might be a little vague. In Part 2 of this series, we’ll translate the translations, grab the remote controller, power-up, take off, fly, land, recharge, repeat and shoot some video.\n\nThought Gallery Channel:\n\nThought Leaders"
