Defined Terms.\n\nAny capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement.\n\n(a) “Board” shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.\n\n(b) “Cause” shall mean (i) Stockholder’s refusal or willful and continued failure to substantially perform Stockholder’s duties with the Company; (ii) Stockholder’s refusal or willful and continued failure to substantially follow and comply with the specific and lawful directives of the Board, as reasonably determined by the Board, (iii) Stockholder’s willful commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty resulting in material economic or financial injury to the Company, or (iv) Stockholder’s conviction of, or plea of guilty or no contest to, the commission of a felony.\n\n(c) “Change in Control” shall mean (i) a sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (ii) a sale by the stockholders of the Company of the voting stock of the Company to another Company and/or its subsidiaries that results in the\n\nownership by such Company and/or its subsidiaries of eighty percent (80%) or more of the combined voting power of all classes of the voting stock of the Company entitled to vote; (iii) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving Company or (iv) a reverse merger in which the Company is the surviving Company but the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise.\n\n(d) “Code” shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\n\n(e) “Common Stock” shall mean the common stock of the Company.\n\n(f) “Good Reason” shall mean (i) a material reduction in the nature or scope of Stockholder’s responsibilities, or the assignment to him of duties that are materially inconsistent with his position (in each case as compared to Stockholder’s responsibilities, duties or position immediately after the Merger); (ii) the Company’s material reduction of Stockholder’s annual base salary or bonus opportunity, each as in effect immediately after the Merger (other than a reduction in salary or bonus opportunity which is part of, and generally consistent with, a general reduction of similarly situated employees’ salaries and/or bonus opportunities); (iii) the relocation of the Company’s offices at which Stockholder is principally employed immediately following the Merger such that Stockholder’s one-way daily commute from Stockholder’s principal residence to the Company’s offices at which Stockholder is principally employed is increased by more than fifty (50) miles; or (iv) a Change in Control of the Company.\n\n(g) “Restricted Stock” shall mean shares of Common Stock issued to Stockholder upon the consummation of the Merger and made subject to restrictions under this Agreement.\n\n2. Acquisition of Stock/ 83(b) Election.\n\n(a) Upon consummation of the Merger, all of the shares of Strangeberry common stock held by Stockholder (or common stock issued upon conversion of Stockholder’s preferred stock) shall be exchanged for Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.6 of the Merger Agreement and shall become subject to this Agreement and the restrictions set forth herein (the “Restrictions”). To the extent that this Agreement conflicts with the terms of the Founder Stock Purchase Agreement, dated April 30, 2002, between Strangeberry and the Stockholder, the terms of this Agreement will govern.\n\n(b) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, Stockholder shall make an effective election with the Internal Revenue Service under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (an “Election”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder to include in gross income for the taxable year in which the Closing Date occurs the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Common Stock over the amount paid (within the meaning of Section 83(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) for such Common Stock. The Stockholder represents that Stockholder has consulted any tax consultant(s) that Stockholder deems advisable in connection with the acquisition of the Common Stock or the filing of an Election. THE STOCKHOLDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS THE\n\nSTOCKHOLDER’S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT THE COMPANY’S TO FILE TIMELY THE ELECTION, EVEN IF THE STOCKHOLDER REQUESTS THE COMPANY OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON THE STOCKHOLDER’S BEHALF.\n\n3.

The Restricted Stock and stock assignment shall be held by the secretary in escrow, pursuant to the Escrow Instructions attached as Exhibit B hereto, until the Restricted Stock is forfeited or until the Restrictions lapse, or until such time as this Agreement no longer is in effect. Upon the lapse of the Restrictions on the Restricted Stock, the escrow agent shall upon request deliver or direct the Company’s transfer agent to deliver to Stockholder the certificate or certificates representing such Restricted Stock in the escrow agent’s or transfer agent’s possession belonging to Stockholder, and the escrow agent shall be discharged of all further obligations hereunder; provided, however, that the escrow agent or, upon direction from the escrow agent, the Company’s transfer agent, shall nevertheless retain such certificate or certificates as escrow agent (or transfer agent) if so required pursuant to other restrictions imposed pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n(b) In the event that share certificates representing the Restricted Stock are generated prior to the applicable vesting and release date, such certificate will bear a legend in substantially the form set forth below.\n\nTHE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE UNDER THE TERMS OF THAT CERTAIN RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT BY AND BETWEEN TIVO INC.(THE “COMPANY”) AND THE HOLDER OF THE SECURITIES.

Lapse of Restrictions.\n\nThe restrictions set forth in Section 4 on shares of Restricted Stock shall lapse upon satisfaction of the following, provided that Stockholder provides continuous service to the Company or a Subsidiary through each of the following dates:\n\n(a) The Restrictions will lapse with respect to 25% of the shares of Restricted Stock on the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date;\n\n(b) The Restrictions will lapse with respect to 25% of the shares of Restricted Stock on the first anniversary of the Closing Date; and\n\n(c) The Restrictions will lapse with respect to the remaining 50% of the shares of Restricted Stock in substantially equal installments on the last day of each month during the twelve-month period commencing with the first anniversary of the Closing Date, such that the Restriction will lapse with respect to 100% of the shares of Restricted Stock on the second anniversary of the Closing Date.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Restrictions will lapse on 100% of the shares of Restricted Stock on the date of any termination of Stockholder’s employment by the Company or a Subsidiary without Cause or by Stockholder for Good Reason.\n\n6.

No Right to Continued Employment.\n\nNothing in this Agreement shall confer upon Stockholder any right to continue in the employment or other service of the Company, any parent or any Subsidiary or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company, any parent or any Subsidiary, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge Stockholder at any time for any reasons whatsoever, with or without Cause.\n\n8.

The Stockholder is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Stockholder understands that he (and not the Company) shall be responsible for its own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n(h) Should any provision of this Agreement be determined by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable, the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall remain enforceable.\n\n(i) This Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event the Merger Agreement terminates prior to the consummation of the Merger.\n\n[Signature page follows.]"
