        "text": "Kevin Maney,\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTiVo CEO Michael Ramsay, a Scottish engineer, sounds like Shrek. I keep thinking he'll say: ''Layers. Onions have layers. Ogres have layers.'' But no.\n\nHe does, however, stand in Shrek-like defense of who he is. Ramsay believes that innovation and killer products can win the day over price wars and the clout of big cable companies -- a stand that some say could kill the company.\n\nRamsay brought to market a beloved device that has had the greatest impact on the way people use TV since Zenith introduced the Space Command 400 remote control in 1956.\n\nUsers adore TiVo in a way that rarely happens in technology. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell, a devoted user, has called TiVo ''God's machine.''\n\nBut Ramsay is getting pounded on Wall Street and in the press. Last week, Ramsay said he will step down as CEO once he finds a successor but will remain chairman. He and James Barton founded the company in 1997. Some reports said TiVo's board pressured Ramsay to step down, but board member Geoff Yang says it was Ramsay's idea. ''Mike brought this up 15 months ago,'' Yang says.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramsay presses on. ''My philosophy is that success is what happens when everyone says you're going to die,'' he says.\n\nBy that definition, TiVo must be poised for takeoff.\n\nAnd maybe it is. At headquarters in Alviso, Calif., last month, Ramsay showed me new technologies TiVo plans to roll out over time. Ramsay is going after a very Apple-like strategy: create cool stuff so people will become loyal fans and pay a premium.\n\n''We're not for everybody,'' Executive Vice President Brodie Keast chimes in. ''We're for who wants the best.''\n\nOK, so until the iPod, such a strategy never worked too well for Apple. But bear with me here.\n\nTiVo was the first digital video recorder, or DVR. The device makes it simple to record TV shows so you can watch them when you want. TiVo is to the VCR what e-mail is to U.S. Postal Service mail -- a much better means to an end.\n\nMore than any previous invention, TiVo has detached TV shows from TV networks. If you own a TiVo, you don't care what channel a show is on. TiVo scoops up everything you want from all the channels and stores it. TiVo users tend to watch TiVo instead of channel surf.\n\nIn the next generation, TiVo wants to detach shows from television itself.\n\nThis starts with TiVoToGo, unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show a couple of weeks ago. It's a way to dump a show recorded on TiVo onto a laptop computer hard drive, so you could take the show with you on an airplane. Five years from now, Ramsay says, a TiVo box won't care where programming comes from or where it's going.\n\nA lot of content might still come in over cable-TV lines from traditional broadcasters. But ''about 20% of television will come in over broadband Internet,'' Ramsay predicts. That content might be video produced for a Web site or movies downloaded from the likes of Netflix or Movielink. Some might be digital home movies, photos or music stored on your home PC.\n\nUsing in-house software called Strangeberry, which TiVo is reluctant to talk about, future TiVos could juggle all the varied content, connecting to all your gadgets over a wireless network. You'd bring a TiVo machine home and turn it on, and it would find and connect to your TVs and computers, Ramsay says.\n\nUsing a TiVo interface on any TV screen or computer, you'd tell TiVo what to find and save and where to send it. TiVo could pluck a video off the Web to show on TV or grab a bunch of Johnny Bravo cartoons to pump into a handheld video player so you could watch them on the train ride to work.\n\n''One remote, a single interface, and it'll be like having 5 million channels,'' Ramsay says. ''Today's DVRs will look old in five years.''\n\nOK, but the vision is not unique. At CES, Bill Gates previewed a similar future for Microsoft's Media Center PCs. Then again, TiVo incites such passion from owners because the company is so good at making things simple to use. Microsoft tends to make things about as simple as an Umberto Eco novel. TiVo might have an edge there.\n\nStill, you want Microsoft as a competitor as much as you want water moccasins in your toilet bowl. Plus, TiVo has to contend with Comcast and other big cable companies, which are starting to rent out Motorola and Scientific-Atlanta DVRs for less than it costs to buy a TiVo (about $100) and pay the monthly service fee ($12.95).\n\nAnalysts, investors and customers wonder whether TiVo can hold on until it gets to Ramsay's vision of the future. The stock closed Tuesday at $4.31, down from about $13 in March. Chatter on the Web among TiVo users and hackers is ominous. ''TiVo will probably die,'' says a post on the Web site Slashdot. ''They have the entire TV industry against them.''\n\nComments like that bring out a bit of ogre in Ramsay. ''This is not a binary market,'' he says. ''It's a massive market. Our market is everybody who watches television worldwide.''\n\nThat leaves a lot of room: DVRs are just beginning to take off. Only about 4% of U.S. homes own a DVR now, but that will shoot to 41% in five years, according to Forrester Research.\n\n''We'll always be a brand of choice -- the easiest to use,'' Ramsay says.\n\nPerhaps TiVo can ride elegant design and excellent technology to a decent share of an exploding market. Maybe its fans, who include Oprah Winfrey, Jay Leno and former quarterback Joe Montana, will help see the company through.\n\nBut it sure won't be easy. The Microsofts and Comcasts have moved into Ramsay's swamp and won't be leaving anytime soon.\n\nTo see more of USAToday.com, or to subscribe, go to http://www.usatoday.com\n\n?
