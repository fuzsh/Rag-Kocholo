        "text": "As Slashdot was kind enough to post, the San Francisco Chronicle has an article about a hacker or group of hackers that are calling for massive website defacements as part of a warped (and highly illegal) contest, to occur entirely on July 6th. I considered not submitting the story to avoid drawing attention to it. After all, this could end up being the next \"Y2K\" where everyone sits around waiting for the doomsday that doesn't occur. To those who don't think I should've posted the story, I apologize -- but suggest you read the rest of this article to understand my reasoning.\n\nIt's entirely possible that very few, if any, websites will be defacde that day. It's even possible that more may happen now that warnings are on high-traffic sites such as Slashdot; call it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nSlashdot's reader pool contains a great many folks who own web servers or are site administrators, such as myself. Certainly there are a few black hats in the crowd, but for the most part, the audience is people in the trenches of the technology industry. I can't think of a better place to reach the people who's pagers would actually be ringing or vibrating on Sunday if/when defacements occur.\n\nAlso, the story had already been picked up by mass media, such as the S.F. Chronicle. Since it was already being published to the general population, I feel that more good than harm would come from highlighting the issue in the technical community.\n\nMy apologies to the others who rely on web/e-mail services from gotclue.net, as I've probably made this server a more likely target by drawing attention to the issue. I'll be reviewing patches and packages over the next few days and making some fresh backups, just in case. If I can have my cell phone ring on Sunday but, by doing so, keep a thousand other cell-phones from ringing for the same reason, so be it."
