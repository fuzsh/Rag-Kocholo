        "text": "Strange how the timing is, and frankly I only noticed it because the first project is on Opus -- the best comic strip character ever -- but, according to Variety, Miramax and Dimension Films have struck a deal with Wild Brain to co-finance and co-produce CGI films (see article).\n\nGiven the content of my previous post -- about Iger kissing off Pixar for the non-sequential of you out there -- this could mean either that Disney is looking for a back door play for a new CGI player (although they pointed to their own efforts with Chicken Little) or Harvey Weinstein is adding a valuable asset to his Dimension stew to take with him when he goes, if he goes.\n\nIn Miramax's favor, given its current budget limitations, is that the deal calls for the co-financing of the pictures with Dimension/Miramax to distribute worldwide and fully-financed (by Wild Brain) straight to DVD fare pushing through the same pipeline. Of course, it will be a test of the newly lean Miramax's ability to exert the same marketing and distribution prowess it has exhibited in its past (see article on the miramAX).\n\nWild Brain CEO Jim Miller hopes that his experience overseeing Warner Brothers' co-production deals will help the company to drive through cost effective ($50 million) animation efforts every nine months.\n\nThe other side of the coin is that relationships like this will allow Miramax to have a steady stream of pictures without taxing its checkbook.\n\nFurther analysis has been provided by BusinessWeek.\n\n--------\n\nIn an interesting piece in The New York Times, Laura M. Holson takes a look at the continued integration of Universal into the folds of GE's NBC Universal, and Bob Wright's in depth interest in how it works (see article).\n\nKnown for a very organized and systematic operating model, employing \"Six Sigma,\" GE is bringing that discipline into the film studio and this article examines that impact on marketing and operations. With an $800 million operating budget that includes production and marketing costs, GE is interested in understanding the rationale for salaries, marketing spends and budgets.\n\nIn the most interesting thought to arise from the article, Wright pepper Stacey Snider, Universal Pictures' chairwoman, \"with questions about how the studio greenlights movies.\" Perhaps he can let the rest of the world understand too.\n\n--------\n\nA very good and detailed analysis from the Hollywood Reporter on the final proof in the pudding of the importance of DVD revenues to studios (see article):\n\nNielsen Monitor-Plus estimates that the home entertainment divisions of the top nine movie studios spent $887.5 million to market their titles in 2003, up nearly 26% from $705.6 million in 2002.\n\nWith an overall per-title average of nearly $1.6 million and $3 to $4 million spends on large grossing films, studios are working hard to push revenues in the lucrative home video window.\n\nAnd it's getting crowded and accelerated just like the theatrical window. According to the article, because big box retailers are providing the discs at a discount for the first week of sales, 50% of total sales can be derived during this period. So studios need to roll out bigger campaigns earlier to drive awareness and sales during this week.\n\nNot unlike the creeping, some would argue racing speed, of advertising dollars at the box office, DVDs are demanding higher investment for their higher return (and margins).\n\nThe world is speeding up and the cost of controlling it skyrocketing.\n\n--------\n\nUnbelievable that studios could even consider the value and existence of the post-25 market, but USA Today presents a fairly detailed analysis (especially for them) of this summer's movies that attracted older audiences (see article).\n\nSo why should the young-run studios focus on older audiences? Money!\n\nYet shifting demographics, economics, politics and consumer tastes...are prodding studios to offer more adult-themed summer choices and get them on more screens than ever before. These plot- and character-driven films, which often eschew overblown action scenes, computer-generated effects and implausible story lines... Unlike blockbusters that open big and fade fast, many have staying power. \"Fahrenheit [9/11]\", \"[The] Notebook\" and \"De-Lovely\" are currently posting higher weekly grosses than \"Shrek [2]\", \"[Harry] Potter\" and other early summer biggies.\n\nThe article focuses on three factors that may have driven this past summer's senior oriented lineup: cheaper costs for higher profits, the rise of older women, a shortened awards season. The first is straight forward, the theory being that older audiences need less expensive fare to enjoy a film and arrive in droves. Frankly, it would be interesting if Hollywood could adopt this message for more films (see the success of \"Napoleon Dynamite\" and \"Garden State\").\n\nThe second is the most pointed, that there are hordes of older woman with purse strings and disposable income that are willing to plunk it down on a ticket when attracted by a film. And the third is interesting in that with the Oscars earlier and studios not wanting to dump product in December to get lost among the flotsam and jetsam there appears to be an effort to push movies more evenly across the year.\n\n--------\n\nDave Kehr has an interesting piece in the New York Times where he is explores a side effect of the Sony-MGM transaction: multiple studio branding. Sony already has Screen Gems, Sony Picture Classics, Columbia and TriStar. It will be acquiring the United Artists brand from MGM. While it is fair to argue that with the exception (at best) of Disney, Miramax and Pixar -- and the rise of Focus Features -- there is very little in the way of coherent brand identity in studio labels.\n\nKehr argues that for the first time since studios still owned both the theaters and the stars in the 30s and 40s, Sony might have the opportunity to intelligently assign pictures to different logos that could create specific identity for each logo.\n\nWhat does this mean financially? Well marketing and money are very close siblings -- though often of the bickering variety -- and anything that might strengthen market awareness of your product (movie) is a good thing. And in general, as studios utilize a variety of stars across a variety of genres, it is a difficult approach for most studios to take. Disney and Pixar have that kid-friendly thing to fall back on and Miramax tends to focus on Oscar-type fare that employ a small stable of artists. Absent this, it makes more sense to market to film concept and stars.\n\nSony could potentially have the opportunity to manage a number of brands if it allocates product appropriately. However, it would need to give each brand a distinct identity and presence (including website and campaign and animated logo). It is a potentially expensive proposition and one that studio marketing teams are unfamiliar with.\n\n--------\n\nOkay, a little off topic, but with the announcement of the pseudo-AI capabilities of characters in The Sims 2 (see article) and the mainstreaming of video game character movies, episodes and music videos, it would appear that a new form of entertainment is taking significant hold.\n\nStick with me here, it's not gonna happen tomorrow or even in a year or two, but imagine the convergence of immense computing power, unlimited storage capability, large flat screen televisions, controllable animated avitars and easy to use digital editing software. MTV has already embraced the trend of home-made animated content from video games (generally online worlds) that arose with groups like Windspire Entertainment and its Star Wars Online music videos and Red vs. Blue done in a style it's creators call \"machinima.\" It has a new show \"Video Mod\" premiering on MTV2 September 18 at 9:30 p.m. ET, that \"transforms music videos by injecting a unique video game environment and featuring characters from one or even a few video games.\" And let's not forget about Playboy's spread \"Gaming Grows Up\" that demonstrates the graphics leaps that game design and animation have taken.\n\nSo what am I saying? Well, the fear for the industry used to be that digital technology would allow actors to be replaced by digital replicants that directors could control and voice on their own (the premise of S1m0ne). I think what is more legitimate is that we will see animated content arising from anonymous characters available in video games, especially online universes where players could cooperate and create an ensemble event. And that leads to a larger question: will the wider availability of easier-to-use and more satisfyingly sophisticated content creation tools further fracture the consumption of mass media? And where do the dollars go?\n\n--------\n\nIn a letter delivered to the Board of The Walt Disney Company on Thursday evening, Michael Eisner officially acknowledged his intention not to seek a new term as CEO after his contract expires in 2006. Presumably intended as part of an end of fiscal year review letter (he has just completed TWENTY years in office, Eisner aluded to the trials and tribulations of the last year or so which found Disney battling against reduced tourism, a middling economy and a foundering network as well as former dissident Board member and company namesake brother (Roy E. Disney).\n\nBy delivering this announcement two years in advance of the turnover, and having publicly stated that Bob Iger would make a strong successor, Eisner is apparently seeking to create a smooth transition and a way for Disney to progress and grow, though he will have to navigate two years as a lame duck. Major shareholder CalPERS issued a statement to that point.\n\nThis news brings about interesting possiblities in Disney's talks with Pixar (perhaps back on?) and the Weinsteins.\n\nThe letter was released by Disney as an 8-K filing with the SEC. Expect widespread commentary and analysis to follow: ABC Online, Variety, E! Online, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal (subscription required), and The New York Times.\n\n--------\n\nMaking news for like the thirtieth day in a row, TiVo, along with ReplayTV, have confirmed that they will be including technology in future versions of their DVRs that will limit both the amount of time pay-per-view (PPV) movies will be saved as well as the number of times a movie can be watched. (see article)\n\nThis move was likely at the behest of both cable and satellite companies, as well as the studios themselves. In the everchanging ecosystem that digital technology is laying waste to, content is become available and flexible -- movement of pristine copies between viewing and storage devices -- in a way that makes content providers and distributors nervous.\n\nNever before have consumers had the opportunity to control and maintain a library of quality content and the toll takers are reasonably nervous. What we are witnessing through this effort, various legislation, and other technical tools is the battle between content provider and content consumer and who will control the consumption of said content. With DRM, storage and transmission costs dropping is that providers will seek to provide controlled consumption across an array of pricing plans. What we should see - albeit in a number of years -- is the eradication between alternative post-theatrical windows: there won't be \"home video,\" \"PPV,\" \"VOD,\" \"rental,\" \"purchase.\" Instead, consumers will choose how much they are willing to pay for what type of access (one-time, temporary, permanent) and how soon that access will available.\n\nPity the providers who are comfortable with today's business model and not preparing adequately for tomorrow.\n\n--------\n\nNewsweek reported in it's September 13th issue that a partnership deal is all but done between Netflix and TiVo (see article). In a move most people will respond to with \"Oh. Yeah!\" the two companies are planning to work together to deliver Netflix VOD straight to the home via TiVo boxes and broadband pipes.\n\nAnswering the question of what Netflix and TiVo need to do to survive in a world of Blockbuster delivery service, cable VOD offerings and services like Moviebeam and Movielink, this extension of both services might be the competitive spark they need.\n\nTiVo had already been exploring extending its technology through its purchase of Strangeberry -- a company with technology to deliver content to a TiVo box through cable or dsl broadband. A partnership with Netflix provides it with the content source it needs without requiring it to acquire expertise outside of its own areas of expertise.\n\n--------\n\nTime Warner, seeking to undercut Sony's involvement, is putting its cash pile and lowered debt levels to shift to an all cash offer for MGM, thought to be $4.5 billion, as reported today in Variety (see article). It's still unclear who will come out on top as Sony is purported to be willing to put $4.7 billion in cash on the table as part of their reportedly \"complicated\" offer, per an article in today's Los Angeles Times (see article).\n\nRegardless of the party that may or may not become ultimately victorious in this Hollywood safari, it's likely that MGM's production activities will cease as a separate endeavor, with projects brought under the large film groups of either WB or Sony. As for MGM's successful home video group (highlighting the attraction the library titles), let's hope there's not too much redundancy in the new organization.\n\nOf course, at the end of the day MGM may still chug along as a second tier major studio without any of the conglomerate leverage of its competitors.\n\n--------"
