        "text": "Arthur van Hoff, principal engineer at TiVo, resigned in late February, he confirmed Wednesday. His resume posted to his Web site indicated he left the digital video recorder company this year. He joined TiVo in 2004, after TiVo acquired his start-up Strangeberry. Technology developed at Strangeberry has become the basis for TiVo's Home Media Engine, an open platform to allow developers to build Java applications for Series2 DVRs.\n\nAt TiVo, he was the lead architect for the TiVoToGo feature--allowing subscribers to transfer recorded shows on their DVRs to PCs--and the HME project.\n\nVan Hoff said he still believes in what the company is doing but added it was time to move on."
