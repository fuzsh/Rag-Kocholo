Gérard Debreu, 1921-2004, was a French economist, mathematician and Professor of Economics at the University of California, Berkley. He was the winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1983, for including new analytical methods into economic theory and for his contributions to the general equilibrium theory.

Along with Kenneth Arrow he published the way-out paper, “Existence of an Equilibrium for a Competitive Economy”, 1954, in which, using mathematical analysis, he demonstrated the existence of a general equilibrium.

Debreu is also the author of the book “Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium”, 1959, where, using modern mathematics, he exposes a synthesis model of the market economy, based on the variables of price and the expressive equations from the different markets, and that relate in an efficient and coordinated way.
