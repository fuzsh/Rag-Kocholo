There are lecture notes for Graduate Microeconomics (Economics 202 and Economics 203). The notes on General Equilibrium discuss in particular the proof of existence theorems for equilibria in economic models using the Kakutani Fixed Point Theorems.\n\nHomepage for Mark Walker at the University of Arizona\n\nMark Walker is Karl Eller Professor of Economics at the University of Arizona. He makes available from his homepage notes for lecture courses that he teaches, including Economics 519: Mathematics for Economists and Economics 501B: Microeconomics.\n\nVideos of Lectures by Gérard Debreu\n\nGéerard Debreu was one of the leading economists in the development of mathematical economics from the 1950s onwards. His paper with Kenneth Arrow proving the existence of equilibria in economic models with producers and consumers was published in 1954. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1983.\n\nGérard Debreu, Lecture 1 of 4 on Economic Theory (1987) (UC Erskine webcast, June 15, 1987, available on YouTube)\n\nNote that Debreu was presented with a microphone 1 minute and 25 seconds into this lecture, and the audio improves!\n\nGérard Debreu, Lecture 2 of 4 on Economic Theory (1987) (UC Erskine webcast, June 19, 1987, available on YouTube)\n\nGérard Debreu, Lecture 3 of 4 on Economic Theory (1987) (UC Erskine webcast, June 22, 1987, available on YouTube)\n\nThis video is mislabelled as Lecture 4 of 4 on YouTube.\n\nGérard Debreu, Lecture 4 of 4 on Economic Theory (1987) (UC Erskine webcast, June 26, 1987, available on YouTube)\n\nThis video is mislabelled as Lecture 3 of 4 on YouTube.\n\nFurther Videos"
