        "text": "BERKELEY, Calif. -- Gerard Debreu, winner of the 1983 Nobel Prize for economics, described himself Monday as an mathematical 'extremist' who was 'overjoyed' that the Nobel Committee did not hold that against him.\n\nThe professor at the University of California at Berkeley also told reporters that he attributed his success to luck. The French-born economist cited his education in France and the 'marvelous' research facilities at Berkeley.\n\nAdvertising\n\nDebreu, 62, said he had not decided what to do with the $200,000 in prize money attached to the Nobel.\n\nHe was cited for refining Adam Smith's classic theory of supply and demand. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences hailed Debreu's attempt to bring objectivity to the field of economics.\n\n'I have applied serious mathematics to economic theory,' he said. 'For many years I have been an extremist, really, by applying more advanced mathematics than most. I am overjoyed that the Nobel Committee did not hold extremism against me.'\n\nHe observed, 'It is not easy to keep distant in the social sciences. I try to be objective, but am not deluded about the difficulty of achieving that.'\n\nKenneth Arrow, a 1972 Nobel winner and Debreu's research partner, said the honor to his associate was 'fully deserved.' He said Debreu's work 'has been marked by the highest degree of originality and integrity.'\n\nArrow, of Stanford University, described the field -- general economic equilibrium -- as how different parts of the economy relate to each other.\n\nDebreu said that his major concern now 'is that the research environment here will be preserved, and that I will have time to conduct more research.'\n\n'I hope that my life will not change,' he said. 'People have less time for research and that's the most serious drawback I can see.'\n\nHe also said current fellowship programs and scholarships were being threatened by budget cuts and 'research cannot go on without more funds.'\n\n'There is a danger of not providing opportunity to gifted mathematicians who turn away from a career in the field because they can't get funding in the most productive years of their lives.'\n\nAsked his opinion of Reaganomics, Debreu replied: 'The kind of work I have done during my entire professional life is not to deal with economic policy. I try to take the scientific approach that requires some kind of detachment from day-to-day economic policies.'\n\nUniversity Chancellor Ira M. Heyman said in a statement: 'We are greatly pleased by the honor he has brought to the Berkeley faculty as its 11th Nobel laureate.'\n\nThe urbane, bespectacled scholar was born in the French city of Calais and received his doctorate at the University of Paris in 1956. He moved to Berkeley in 1962 and became an American citizen in 1975."
