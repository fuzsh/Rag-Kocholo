        "text": "Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium.\n\nDEBREU, Gerard.\n\nItem Number: 79534\n\nNew York: Yale University Press, 1959.\n\nLater printing of one of the most important works in mathematical economics. Octavo, original wrappers. Presentation copy, inscribed by the author on the title page, “For Malcolm Dole Gerard Debreu.” The recipient Malcolm Dole was an hemist known for the Dole Effect in which he proved that the atomic weight of oxygen in air is greater than that of oxygen in water and for his work on electrospray ionization, polymer chemistry, and electrochemistry. Inscribed books by Debreu are rare, especially of this seminal text.\n\n\"Theory of Value is Debreu's classic book...which presents a rigorous yet succinct exposition of the theory of general economic equilibrium, follows a logical and structured direction. Having outlined in the opening chapter the mathematical concepts and results used in the rest of the book, Debreu then discusses the concepts of a commodity and prices, producer behavior, consumer behavior, equilibrium, the relationship between equilibrium and Pareto optimality, and uncertainty\" (Vane and Mulhearn, The Nobel Memorial Laureates in Economics)."
