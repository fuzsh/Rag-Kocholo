        "text": "To get an idea of the research in the field of mathematical economics you can look at some journals devoted to the subject, as the Journal of Mathematical Economics and Economic Theory.\n\nYou can realize that, in this field, there is a heavy use of advanced mathematical theory, not only applications of well-known mathematical tools, even if not trivial, but an original mathematical research.\n\nThe Fields medalist Stephen Smale, is perhaps the most famous example of a mathematician who worked in the field of economics.\n\nIn his famous Mathematical Problems for the Next Century. Mathematical Intelligencer. 20 (2): 7–15 (1998), Smale included an economic problem among the open mathematical problems of the XXI century: the 8th problem of the Smale’s problems is an economic question:\n\nExtend the mathematical models of General Equilibrium Theory to include price adjustment.\n\n(general equilibrium theory is one of the fields of economics where there is a heavy use of mathematics).\n\nAnother well-known mathematician who subsequently devoted himself to economics was Charambolos Aliprantis.\n\nAliprantis is the founder of the above mentioned journal Economic Theory, and he is known for his use of functional analysis and Riezs spaces in economic theory, see for example his books Locally Solid Riesz Spaces With Applications to Economics or Positive Operators, Riesz Spaces, and Economics\n\nGame theory, as suggested by the name, is not applied. Fixed point theorems, measure theory and other abstract areas abound. A lot of very succesful game theorists have math PhDs.\n\nA lot of people will claim that game theory has applications, and this is true for a few topics like auction-theory, but a lot of it is purely abstract, the alleged aplications being illustrative stories whose highest math level is around 'averages' and 'which of these two numbers is bigger', so that a business student can grasp it without a lot of additional study.\n\nThere are also 'applied game theory' fields, but I would argue these seldom use high level math, there is a strong delineation."
