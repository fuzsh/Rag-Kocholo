        "text": "THE award of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science to Gerard Debreu of the University of California at Berkeley was a welcome affirmation of the value of basic research in that subject. Professor Debreu is the purest of pure economists. He has left it to others to deal with the pressing problems of inflation, poverty, developing less-developed countries, and the rest. Instead, he has devoted his career to the enduring problems at the foundations of economics.\n\nIn large part, he was attracted by the intellectual challenge those problems present. But he was also motivated by the conviction that the solutions to the pressing problems depend sooner or later on solving the fundamental ones.\n\nIt is not easy for a noneconomist to appreciate what those fundamental problems are or what Professor Debreu has contributed to our grasp of them. I shall explain only one of them - the one where he made his most notable contribution.\n\nThis problem is a legacy of Adam Smith. Compared with Gerard Debreu, Adam Smith was an intensely practical man. One of Smith's principal purposes in writing ''The Wealth of Nations'' was to attack the tangle of mercantilist regulations and restrictions that then hobbled the economy of England.\n\nIn the course of this attack, he wrote his most famous passage:\n\n''As every individual, therefore, endeavors as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of greatest value; every individual necessarily labors to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it . . . and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.''\n\nThose words carry immediate conviction, and they have served as the unifying principle of economics ever since they were written. But they do not bear close inspection. Where is the assurance, for example, that a host of businessmen flocking to an industry that promises high profits will not so flood the market that their products sell for less than they cost? How, in general, could Adam Smith be so sure that without any coordination millions of businessmen would produce just the amounts of millions of commodities that the smooth working of the economy requires? Smith's explanation of the invisible hand - occupying barely a page - does little to answer such questions.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
