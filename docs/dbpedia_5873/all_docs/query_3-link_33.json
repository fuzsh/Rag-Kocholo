        "text": "(1921–2004). French-born American economist Gerard Debreu was awarded the Nobel prize for economics in 1983 for his work on equilibrium in market supply and demand.\n\nBorn in Calais, France, on July 4, 1921, Debreu served in the French Army during World War II. He worked at the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris from 1946 to 1948 and at the U.S.-based Cowles Commission for Research in Economics from 1950 to 1961. He earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Paris in 1956. In his monograph Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium (1959), Debreu provided the mathematical underpinnings for the phenomenon of equilibrium in supply and demand that was first articulated (as the “invisible hand” that leads self-seeking men unwittingly to aid society) by Adam Smith in 1776. Debreu also developed methods by which to analyze the factors that influence equilibrium.\n\nDebreu joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, in 1962 and served there for some 30 years as a professor of economics and, later, of mathematics as well. He became a U.S. citizen in 1975. Debreu died in Paris on Dec. 31, 2004."
