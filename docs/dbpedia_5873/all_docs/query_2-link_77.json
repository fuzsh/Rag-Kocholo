        "text": "Great men can leave without much noise but outlast their own lives. “J’ai toujours répugné à me lancer dans une action dont je ne puisse penser que d’une façon ou d’une autre, elle pourrait contribuer au bien public.” (“I've always been reluctant to embark on any action that I didn't think would somehow contribute to the public good.” Marcel Boiteux, in a private letter) I’m sad to learn that Marcel Boiteux has passed away on 6 Sept. aged 101. A École normale supérieure graduate in mathematics, he is not as known in the economics community as his classmate Gérard Debreu (from the Arrow-Debreu model* fame and 1983 Nobel prize in Economic Sciences**) but he was a kind of separated twin to Gerard Debreu. The two very promising students were separated on a toss in 1948 as their professor had to chose between them for a Rockefeller fellowship to visit American universities***. A trip that set Gérard Debreu on his academic career path. Marcel Boiteux stayed in France and joined EDF in 1949 where he theorised and implemented the pricing of electricity at marginal cost or the regulation of a natural monopoly and, somehow, he paved the way of the theory of information and the related principal-agent model that underpins the supervision of large public companies. He has been one of these French economists who were elected as President of The Econometric Society (1959) without formally having a PhD. He was one of the fathers of the French civil nuclear energy program and France’s nuclear industry development. He was and will remain a model to any economist: addressing complex issues with robust skills and turning the solution into action to change the world for the better. Anyone interested in the transition to net zero unknowingly owes him a huge debt for provided the theoretical underpinning of the management of the grid and the electricity market. Monsieur, you will be missed. May you rest in peace, may we learn from you and live up to your legacy. * The formalisation of the general equilibrium model which, with prefect competition, convex preferences and demand independance always has a price equilibrium. This results underpins much of economics as we know it as we either assume these assumptions (sometime unknowingly) and the associated result or analyse situations where some of these conditions do not hold. ** Yes, I know the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. *** For the French readers, see the story here : https://lnkd.in/eMH46M8n Jean Tirole Christian Gollier Patrick Bolton Patrice Geoffron Karsten Neuhoff Renaud Crassous Charles Weymuller"
