        "text": "Math major undergrad here. Just finished reading Debreu's Theory of Value. It really got me excited about economics. Is Debreu still hot as an area of research? I'd be most interested in doing PhD wherein I do theory and then test for whether the model is true. That way I'd have the option of going to industry if the academic market did not pan out. Hoping for some good advices.\n\njokes aside think about strucutural econometrics meets AGE/CGE if you want to test the theory. I don't think the AGE/CGE guys really ever did solve that one.\n\nMarx has the best placement record of them all.\n\nHis general equilibrium solution is also by far Pareto superior to all the rest.\n\nWhat's AGE? CGE is computational general equilibrium, but...?\n\nGE has no testable implications, so presumably there is no way to test it anyway?\n\nGuys, its me again, I'm a 34 year old MBA student with 12 years of real-world experience trying to get into an Economics PhD program this year and any tips you could give me would be much appreciated. This is a big step in my life and I don't feel like I can do it without my Internet friends.\n\nIn that way, you will never get out.\n\nI'd be most interested in doing PhD wherein I do theory and then test for whether the model is true.
