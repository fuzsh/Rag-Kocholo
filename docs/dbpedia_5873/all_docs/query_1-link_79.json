        "text": "Milton \"Friedman (1912-2006) was an influential American economist and Nobel laureate. Friedman was known for his strong advocacy of free-market capitalism and his belief in the power of individual choice and limited government intervention. Friedman was associated with the Chicago School of Economics, a group of economists who emphasized the importance of free markets and economic liberalism.\" Milton Friedman was awarded the Nobel prize in Economic Sciences in 1976 \"for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory, and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy.\" https://lnkd.in/dVTsBiYA --- #economics #economists #nobelprize #historyofeconomicthought\n\n\"Kenneth J. Arrow (1921-2017) was an American economist and Nobel laureate known for his significant contributions to the fields of economic theory and social choice theory.(...) Arrow's most famous work is arguably his \"impossibility theorem\", which demonstrated that it is impossible to create a voting system that satisfies simultaneously 5 desirable properties: no dictatorship, individual sovereignty, unanimity, freedom from irrelevant alternatives, and uniqueness of group rank. (...) Kenneth Arrow's most important work however may be his contributions to general equilibrium theory. He proved, with Gérard Debreu, the existence of general economic equilibrium, he analyzed the relationship between equilibria and optima, and he extended equilibrium theory to cover the case of uncertainty and volatility. (...) In 1951, Arrow presented the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics and their proofs without requiring differentiability of utility, consumption, or technology, and including corner solutions. (...) He introduced the notion of contingent commodities, or Arrow-Debreu securities, which incorporate uncertainty into the general equilibrium theory of allocation. (...) He also greatly contributed to information economics, endogenous growth theory, operations research, and health economics\" --- #economics #economists #nobelprize #generalequilibrium #historyofeconomicthought"
