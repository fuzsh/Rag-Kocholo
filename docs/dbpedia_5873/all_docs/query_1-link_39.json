        "text": "This list of Nobel laureates by university affiliation shows the university affiliations of individual winners of the Nobel Prize since 1901 and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences since 1969. The affiliations are those at the time of the Nobel Prize announcement.[1] Universities all adopt different metrics to claim Nobel affiliates, some generous while others more stringent, since some only count academicians at the time of announcement while others include all visitors and professors of various ranks as well. Inconsistency thus may occur between those official counts and what this list states.[2]\n\nNobel laureates by affiliation[1] Laureate Discipline Year of award Affiliation Physics 2003 Argonne
