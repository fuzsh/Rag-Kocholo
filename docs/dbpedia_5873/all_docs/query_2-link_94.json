        "text": "When Peter Diamond was a graduate student at MIT in the early 1960s, he spent much of his time studying the elegant new models of perfectly functioning markets that were all the rage in those days. Most important of all was the general equilibrium model assembled in the 1950s by Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu, often referred to as the mathematical proof of the existence of Adam Smith’s “invisible hand.” Working through the Arrow-Debreu proofs was a major part of the MIT grad student experience. At least, that’s what Diamond told me a few years ago. (If I ever find the notes of that conversation, I’ll offer up some quotes.)"
