        "text": "My Research\n\nMy theoretical and empirical work is broadly on international capital flows, bubbles and production networks. I have also started a project that applies game theory to understand international relations. My policy work focuses more broadly on trade and investment in East Asia and the Japanese economy.\n\nInternational capital flows\n\nTheoretical work\n\nFinancial market imperfections lead to higher than optimal saving and cause capital flows from poor to rich countries (confirmed in a panel analysis in Brueckner et al. 2023), which results in cross country income differences in the long run (see Kikuchi and Stachurski, 2009). Under certain parameter conditions (bifurcation analysis) endogenous cycle emerges leading to permanent fluctuations of international capital flows (see Kikuchi and Stachurski, 2009; Kikuchi and Vachadze, 2018, Kikuchi et al. 2018).\n\nEmpirical work\n\nIn a panel analysis we find that an increase in foreign debt, in response to a decrease in the sovereign credit default swap, leads to an increase in investment and GDP growth (see Kikuchi and Tobe 2021). This is in line with our theoretical finding above. In a firm-level dataset on outbound multinational activity from China we find that the establishment of a Big-5 bank subsidiary or branch is associated with a significant increase in subsequent years in Chinese firms' likelihood to establish an overseas subsidiary in that host country (see Chor et al. 2018). This suggests that Chinese banks establish overseas subsidiaries to circumvent the kind of financial imperfections identified in our theoretical models.\n\nBubbles\n\nTheoretical work\n\nAsset price bubbles can crowd in investment when financial market imperfections suppress capital accumulation by increasing national saving (see Hillebrand et al. 2018). Bubbles in capital goods can crowd in investment in a small open economy by absorbing international capital flows when the capital goods can be used as collateral (see Kikuchi and Thepmongkol, 2020). Similarly, bubbles can emerge in utility-yielding goods such as housing when banks take housing as collateral (see Hillebrand and Kikuchi, 2015).\n\nProduction networks\n\nTheoretical work\n\nWhen firms have a convex cost function and face market transaction costs they produce at a point where the marginal costs of in-house and market-based operations are equalized. In such model the scale of production gets larger as firms are located more downstream resulting in hierarchical production networks (see Kikuchi et al. 2018). The decentralized market solution can be obtained by a central planer solving a dynamic programming problem. The model can be applied to explain the size distribution of management layers as well as cities among others (see Kikuchi et al. 2020).\n\nSelected Publications\n\nCoase Meets Bellman: Dynamic Programming and Production Networks\n\nTomoo Kikuchi, Kazuo Nishimura, John Stachurski and Junnan Zhang\n\nJournal of Economic Theory, 196, 105287, 2021.\n\nCapital Bubbles, Interest Rates and Investment in a Small Open Economy\n\nTomoo Kikuchi and Athakrit Thepmongkol\n\nJournal of Money, Credit and Banking, 52, 2085-2109, 2020.\n\nVolatile Capital Flows and Financial Integration: The Role of Moral Hazard\n\nTomoo Kikuchi, John Stachurski and George Vachadze\n\nJournal of Economic Theory, 176, 170-192, 2018.\n\nTransaction Costs, Span of Control and the Structure of Production Chains\n\nTomoo Kikuchi, Kazuo Nishimura and John Stachurski\n\nTheoretical Economics, 13, 729-760, 2018.\n\nEndogenous Inequality and Fluctuations in a Two Country Model\n\nTomoo Kikuchi and John Stachurski\n\nJournal of Economic Theory, 144, 1560-1571, 2009.\n\nInternational Asset Markets, Nonconvergence, and Endogenous Fluctuations\n\nTomoo Kikuchi\n\nJournal of Economic Theory, 139, 310-335, 2008."
