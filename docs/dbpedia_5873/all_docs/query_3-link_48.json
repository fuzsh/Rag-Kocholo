        "text": "\"Kenneth J. Arrow (1921-2017) was an American economist and Nobel laureate known for his significant contributions to the fields of economic theory and social choice theory.(...) Arrow's most famous work is arguably his \"impossibility theorem\", which demonstrated that it is impossible to create a voting system that satisfies simultaneously 5 desirable properties: no dictatorship, individual sovereignty, unanimity, freedom from irrelevant alternatives, and uniqueness of group rank. (...) Kenneth Arrow's most important work however may be his contributions to general equilibrium theory. He proved, with G√©rard Debreu, the existence of general economic equilibrium, he analyzed the relationship between equilibria and optima, and he extended equilibrium theory to cover the case of uncertainty and volatility. (...) In 1951, Arrow presented the first and second fundamental theorems of welfare economics and their proofs without requiring differentiability of utility, consumption, or technology, and including corner solutions. (...) He introduced the notion of contingent commodities, or Arrow-Debreu securities, which incorporate uncertainty into the general equilibrium theory of allocation. (...) He also greatly contributed to information economics, endogenous growth theory, operations research, and health economics\" --- #economics #economists #nobelprize #generalequilibrium #historyofeconomicthought\n\nHow can different generations join forces for a better world?

Moving through time and history, he discusses strategy‚Äôs varying ideas, motivations, and manifestations across human endeavors. Beginning with Jane Goodall‚Äôs study of primates and ending with modern Bounded Rationality Theory, the story plunges through the dimensions of human conflict, analyzing the protagonists and factors that precipitated political, social, and revolutionary movements, as well as war. Like an expert dramatist, Freedman moves nimbly to and from sequences of events as they occurred, without ever imposing a moral judgment but constantly examining causal factors and consequences. Discussed here are a breadth of well-known strategists like Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Machiavelli, and Liddell Hart, as well as lesser-known and seemingly unstrategic characters like Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi and Max Webber. However, the unity and harmony of thought are maintained in what can only be characterized as the primacy of power and clashes of will. Those looking for specific applications in academic disciplines will be happy to find the foundation of strategic thought behind Business, Management, Economics, and Politics without ever getting bogged down by the noise of sensationalism or opinion."
