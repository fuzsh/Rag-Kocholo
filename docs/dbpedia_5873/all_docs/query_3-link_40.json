        "text": "\"Years ago, I was involved in organising conferences with Christopher Zeeman, who was one of the founders of catastrophe theory and the head of the mathematics department at the University of Warwick. He used to organize rencontres between mathematicians and people from other disciplines, and we organized one between economists and mathematicians. We had some great mathematicians—John Milnor, Steve Smale, Rene Thom, and others—wonderful mathematicians.\n\nAnd on the other side, we had Gérard Debreu, Hugo Sonnenschein, Werner Hildenbrand, and a whole group of very distinguished mathematical economists. After the first two, three hours, I think it was Milnor who said: “We all know that you guys can do mathematics, you do not have to show us. Everybody does his own thing. You want to show us that you are good at doing certain sorts of mathematics; that is fine. But we are interested in the economic problems. We thought that you were going to tell us about economic problems and we were going to use our mathematical tools to help you. But all you are telling us is the mathematical tools that you use and how you are doing well with them. But that is not going to create much”. I think that was absolutely right. After that, the economists were rather silenced and started shifting in their seats uncomfortably. Debreu never said very much anyway, but it was clear he was very insulted, because basically he liked to think of himself as a mathematician.\"\n\nhttp://evonomics.com/macroeconomics-alan-kirman-blind-alley/\n\nI relalose people can't say it in public but the obvious reason to screen students for high mathematical ability is that a) it acts as an IQ filter and keeps the intelligent floor of grad students at a reasonable level, and b) it fpaetially filters out people who want to study social science for purely ideological or activist reasons.\n\nEven if the students end up not doing highly mathematical work, that's fine. It's more about controlling input quality\n\nIf you want to see what the profession would look like without a math filter then this is not hard to imaghbe. Just take a walk over to the aociooogy and political science departments and see what you find\n\nNo, Milnor said he was expecting the economists to present them with \"problems\" that might require new tools. They were bored with hearing about the math of general equilibrium and game theory, mostly fixed point theorems, of course, which the economists were presenting as something solved and done, not as an unsolved problem. So, Milnor at least, if not the rest, was annoyed and dissatisfied.\n\nAs someone who actually knows or has known some of these folks, some of whom are no longer among the living, as well as Alan Kirman, the point is well made, and resembles what happened at a meeting of economists and physicists at the Santa Fe Institute in the late 80s when it was getting set up. The economists went on about all the theorems they had proven, especially again about general equilibrium theory, and the phsyicists made fun of them for avoiding unsolved problems and empirical analysis. Some of what came out of that one was parts of modern econphysics.\n\nAs for the mathematicians, a couple of those did make efforts to do some work in economics with their favored tools. Steve Smale did some stability stufies of equilibrium manifolds, essentially some exetensions of Arrow-Debreu stuff, so not all that sneering of Debreu as implied by Kirman's remarks (and Debreu was indeed a quiet and proud man who had studied math in Paris with the leaders of the Bourbaki school such as Cartan). Also, catastrophe theorist, Zeeman, wrote the first paper using that theory in economics to analyze instability of stock markets, arguably a problem that had not been studied well with mathematical tools, and his paper has come to be widely cited. Both the papers by Smale and by Zeeman appeared in the Journal of Mathematical Economics in its first issues, and this meeting Kirman reported on was linked to the starting of that journal."
