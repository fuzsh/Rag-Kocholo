        "text": "18/06/2024\n\nAttacks on oil refineries in Russia are becoming more frequent. In early June 2024, for example, adrone attack on the \"Lukoil\" refinery was reported. So theRussian government has classified data on fuel production. Shortly before this, the Financial Times reported that the USA allegedly asked Ukrainenot to strike Russian oil refining facilities.\n\nConsidering that many foreign oil investors own shares in Russian oil and gas giants, could this somehow influence the partners' loud political statements?\n\nForeign investors in the Russian oil-gas sphere\n\nOSINT specialists from Molfar agency analyzed about 30 of the largest Russian oil and gas companies, such as Rosneft, Gazprom, and Lukoil. Numerous oil investors and companies from Russia's eastern partners and European and American companies were identified among their owners.\n\nBlackRock, Vanguard Group, and other companies from the USA are shareholders in Russian oil companies\n\nBlackRock, a US-based asset management company, is one of the key investors in the Russian oil and gas sector. In \"Gazprom,\" they hold a 1.2% stake, which amounts to approximately $1.285 billion, according to Financial Times data from February 2024. BlackRock has frozen its assets but maintains its stake in Russian companies. Additionally, according to their 2023annual report, the company owned61,000 shares of the Russian oil and gas company “Novatek.”\n\nTheVanguard Group'sreport as of October 31, 2023, shows that the company owns 1.4 thousand shares of the Russian \"Novatek.\" In January 2022, shortly before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine,Vanguard Group and BlackRock alsoinvested around $1.3 billion in \"Gazprom.\" As of February 2024, Vanguard Group values its 282.6 million shares at zero US dollars (1,2,3).

Morgan has a stake in \"Rosneft.\" As ofOctober 2023, their assets' value was estimated at $137,900. Representatives of the companystated that they are exiting Russia. However,Russian media reports thatJP Morgan Bank International, a Russian subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase Bank, has increased its assets over the past two years. As of October 2023, one of J.P. Morgan's funds owned shares in \"Gazprom,\" valued at $298,000.

The company also noted that it could not sell its stake due to shareholder agreements, which prohibit selling any TotalEnergies asset to one of the principal shareholders of \"Novatek,\" who are under sanctions. As of December 31, 2023, TotalEnergies still held 19.4% of the shares in \"Novatek\" (1,2).\n\n\"Nord Stream\" and German companies with shares in Russian oil and gas companies\n\nGermany has companies interested in the Russian oil and gas business. Analyzing open data, Molfar identified two German companies that hold shares in the \"Nord Stream\" project —Wintershall Dea AG with a 15.5% stake, and PEG Infrastruktur AG (E.ON) with a 15.5% stake, valued at$2.6 billion according to thereport.\n\nA few words about Nord Stream.

In December 2022, a Swiss courtgranted a six-month “bankruptcy stay” to Nord Stream 2 AG.

It specializes in extracting, producing, trading, and transporting various raw materials, including oil and natural gas, metals, and grain.\n\nOn December 7, 2016, Rosneftsigned an agreement to sell 19.5% of its shares (worth $11 billion) to a joint venture between Glencore and Qatar Investment Authority. Officially, the stake was considered equally divided between Glencore and the Qatari company, but Glencore contributed only €300 million and claimed ownership of just a 0.57% stake. In March 2022, Glencorestated that it had not acquired any new stakes in the Russian company. Still, their participation in Rosneftremained unsold until December 2023 due to Russian authorities freezing any sale of \"Rosneft\" shares.\n\nAs ofJanuary 2024, Glencore, through its subsidiary Rambero Holding, held a 31.28% stake in RussNeft.\n\nChinese Companies with Stakes in Russian Oil and Gas Companies\n\nThe Chinese companyCNPC holds a 10% stake in Novatek's \"Arctic LNG 2\" projects and a 20% stake in the \"Yamal LNG\" project.\n\nAnother Chinese company,CNOOC, also holds a 10% stake in \"Arctic LNG 2.\" TheSilk Road Fund has a 9.9% stake in \"Yamal LNG.\"\n\nOther Foreign Companies with Stakes in Russian Oil and Gas Companies\n\nForeign Investments in Russian Oil through Kazakhstan\n\nAnother way to profit from Russian oil and gas is through investments made via Kazakhstan.\n\n15% of Russia's oil refining capacity was lost after Ukrainian strikes\n\nIn official statements, most Western investor companies claim to be exiting the Russian market. Some assert they still cannot sell their shares due to international sanctions. Some have openly stated that they do not intend to leave Russia, such as the Indian company “ONGC Videsh Ltd.” Additionally, some only announce their exit, like the Dutch companiesSchlumberger &Firma Radius-Servis &GeoFit & Petroalliance &NafraMax.\n\nThus, many foreign companies remain among the oil investors in the Russian oil and gas business. Our analysis did not find their comments regarding the strikes on Russian refineries. Meanwhile, some politicians from the countries where these companies operate have criticized the strikes on Russian refineries.\n\nIn the USA, calls were made to stop the attacks on Russian refineries. During aconversation between Zelensky and US Vice President Kamala Harris in February 2024, it was reportedly suggested that attacks on targets in Russia cease. The Biden administration's overall stance is critical of such actions, as they believe these strikes could lead to increased oil prices. However, some politicians in the United States haveexpressed support for Ukrainian strikes.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjournéstated that Ukraine is acting in self-defense and that Russia is the aggressor.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary David Camerondeclared that Ukraine is entitled to use weapons provided by the UK to strike targets in Russia, and that the decision should be made by Kyiv.\n\nAs of April, Ukrainian strikes had destroyedapproximately 15% of Russia's refining capacity. Likely, many foreign oil investors' exit or freezing of assets has also impacted oil production. From March 14 to 20, refineries processed 5.03 million barrels of oil per day, which is lower than the average for the previous 13 days. In the first quarter of 2024,seven Russian refineries stopped operating due to attacks by Ukrainian drones.\n\nRussia was threatened with a fuel shortage, so itturned to Kazakhstan, requesting 100,000 tons of gasoline. It had previously made a similar request to Belarus. Meanwhile, in May 2024, oil and gasrevenue increased by 39% to 793.7 billion rubles."
