The agreement was signed today at a meeting of the Japan Association for Trade with Russia and NIS and the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren).\n\nThrough the International Center for Innovation, Yokogawa and Gazprom Neft will cooperate in development of advanced process control systems and other innovative solutions for Gazprom Neft's refineries. As such, Yokogawa will assist in the training of Gazprom Neft engineers and supply cutting-edge process control technologies. The International Center will be established next year and will be located in Saint Petersburg.\n\nYokogawa and Gazprom Neft have long worked closely with each other. In 2008, two companies signed a strategic partnership agreement with Gazprom Neft. Under this agreement, Yokogawa has supplied its control systems to Gazprom Neft on a priority basis and has strengthened its customer services by establishing technical centers.\n\nThrough the provision of the latest plant control technologies and the training of technical personnel, Yokogawa will continue to expand its industrial automation business in Russia and contribute to this nation's growth.\n\nAbout Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom Neft\n\nGazprom Neft is a subsidiary of Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom, a global energy company.

The company changed its name to Yokogawa Electric CIS Ltd. in 2005 and has been aggressively expanding business not only in Russia but also in other CIS nations.
