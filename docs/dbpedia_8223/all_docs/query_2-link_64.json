        "text": "As required by section 43 of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (‘the Sanctions Act’), the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs has provided this guidance to assist in the implementation of, and compliance with, The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the ‘Regulations’), as amended from time to time.\n\nThe following instruments have made amendments to this instrument.

It additionally provides guidance on best practice for complying with the prohibitions and requirements; the enforcement of them; and circumstances where they do not apply.\n\nThis document is intended to be read alongside more detailed sanctions guidance published by departments including the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), Department for Transport (DfT), Home Office and HM Treasury, through the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI). This document contains links to those key sources of sanctions guidance, which will be regularly maintained and updated on GOV.UK. It is designed to give an overview of the prohibitions and requirements in the Regulations and, where appropriate, direct readers to further detailed guidance. This document is current on the date of publication.\n\n1. Prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019\n\nThe Regulations impose financial, director disqualification, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions for the purposes of encouraging Russia to cease actions which destabilise Ukraine, or undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.\n\nIn order to achieve the stated purposes, the Regulations impose a number of prohibitions and requirements. In order to enforce these, the Regulations establish penalties and offences, which are set out in detail in the corresponding report under section 18 of the Sanctions Act in relation to criminal offences.\n\nThe prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Regulations apply within the territory of the United Kingdom (UK) (including Northern Ireland) and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they are in the world. UK persons includes British nationals, as well as all bodies incorporated or constituted under the law of any part of the UK. Accordingly, the prohibitions and requirements imposed by the Regulations apply to all companies established in any part of the UK, and they also apply to branches of UK companies operating overseas.\n\nThe maritime enforcement powers contained in Part 10 of the Regulations apply in relation to British ships in international or foreign waters, ships without nationality in international waters and foreign ships in international waters.\n\nIt is prohibited to intentionally participate in any activities if you know that the object or effect of them is directly or indirectly to circumvent the prohibitions imposed by the Regulations or to enable or facilitate the contravention of those prohibitions.\n\nIf you are unclear about any aspect of the Regulations, in particular about whether action you are considering taking could contravene the Regulations, you are advised to seek independent legal advice.\n\nProhibitions and requirements for the financial, director disqualification, trade, aircraft, shipping and immigration sanctions contained in the Regulations are set out below.\n\n1.1 Non-government controlled territory of Ukraine\n\nThe territorial scope of certain measures in the Regulations is ‘non-government controlled Ukrainian territory’. This is defined in regulation 2 as ‘Crimea and non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts’.\n\n‘Crimea’ is further defined as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol.\n\n1.2 Designation of persons\n\nThe Regulations provide that the Secretary of State may designate persons by name for the purposes of the financial and/or director disqualification and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions if they are, or have been, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in regulation 6 of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)).\n\nThe Regulations also make provision for the Secretary of State to provide that persons of a specified description are designated persons for the purposes of the financial and/or immigration and/or aircraft and/or shipping and/or internet services sanctions.\n\nThe UK Sanctions List provides details of the people designated under the Regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been designated.\n\n1.3 Specification of ships\n\nThe Regulations provide that the Secretary of State may specify a ship for the purposes of shipping sanctions if the ship is, has been, or is likely to be, involved in a relevant activity (as defined in regulation 57F of the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (as amended)).\n\nThe Regulations also provide that the Secretary of State must specify a ship by its International Maritime Organization number or, where it is not reasonably practicable to identify it by that number, by any other means that the Secretary of State considers appropriate.\n\nThe UK Sanctions List[WH1] provides details of the ships specified under the Regulations, and details of the sanctions in respect of which they have been specified.\n\n1.4 Financial sanctions\n\nAsset freeze and making available provisions\n\nThe Regulations impose financial sanctions through a targeted asset freeze on designated persons and prohibitions on making funds or economic resources available. This involves the freezing of funds and economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles) of designated persons and ensuring that funds and economic resources are not made available to or for the benefit of designated persons, either directly or indirectly.\n\nMore information on financial sanctions can be found in the OFSI guidance.\n\nOFSI is the authority for implementing the UK’s financial sanctions on behalf of HM Treasury. OFSI helps to ensure that financial sanctions are properly understood, implemented and enforced in the UK. Further information on how OFSI implements financial sanctions can be found on the OFSI pages of GOV.UK.\n\nOther financial and investment restrictions\n\nThe Regulations prohibit a person from directly or indirectly dealing with a transferable security or money market instrument if it has a maturity exceeding 30 days, and was issued after 1 August 2014 by:\n\nSberbank, VTB bank, Gazprombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB), Rosselkhozbank (as listed in Schedule 2)\n\nan entity incorporated or constituted in a country other than the UK which is owned by one or more of the five banks listed above\n\nan entity acting on behalf of or at the direction of those five banks named above or an entity incorporated or constituted in a country other than the UK which is owned by one or more of those five banks\n\nIt is also prohibited for a person to directly or indirectly deal with a transferable security or money market instrument if it has a maturity exceeding 30 days, and was issued after 12 September 2014 by:\n\nOPK Oboronprom, United Aircraft Corporation, Uralvagonzavod, Rosneft, Transneft or Gazprom Neft (as listed in Schedule 2)\n\nan entity incorporated or constituted in a country other than the UK which is owned by one or more of the six entities listed above\n\nan entity acting on behalf of or at the direction of those six entities named above or an entity incorporated or constituted in a country other than the UK which is owned by one or more of those six entities\n\nIt is prohibited for a person to directly or indirectly deal with a transferable security or money-market instrument if it has a maturity exceeding 30 days, and was issued on or after 1 March 2022 by:\n\nan entity incorporated or constituted under the law of the UK and owned by one or more of the entities listed in Schedule 2\n\nan entity acting on behalf or at the direction of the above\n\nIt is prohibited for a person to directly or indirectly deal with a transferable security or money-market instrument if it has a maturity exceeding 30 days, and was issued on or after 1 March 2022 by:\n\na person connected with Russia (this is defined in regulation 19A(2), and is subject to the exclusions in regulation 16(4D)(a))\n\nan entity owned by such persons\n\nan entity acting on behalf or at the direction of any of the above\n\nIt is prohibited for a person to directly or indirectly deal with a transferable security or money market instrument if it was issued:\n\non or after 15 December 2022\n\nby a relevant entity (i.e. a person who is not a person connected with Russia)\n\nfor the purposes of making an investment in relation to Russia (see below)\n\nIt is also prohibited for a person to directly or indirectly deal with a transferable security or money-market instrument which was issued on or after 1 March 2022 by the Government of Russia (as defined in regulation 6).\n\nLoan and credit arrangements\n\nThe Regulations prohibit a person from directly or indirectly granting or entering into any arrangement to grant a new loan or credit, with a maturity exceeding 30 days to:\n\nthe entities listed in Schedule 2\n\nan entity which is incorporated or constituted under the law of a non-UK country and owned by one or more of the entities listed in Schedule 2, or an entity acting on behalf of or at the direction of either that entity or an entity listed in Schedule 2\n\nan entity which is incorporated or constituted under the law of the UK and owned by an entity listed in Schedule 2, on or after 1 March 2022\n\na person connected with Russia (this is defined in regulation 19A(2), and is subject to the exclusions in regulation 17(5))\n\nThe Regulations prohibit granting a new loan or credit arrangement to a relevant entity for the purposes of making an investment in relation to Russia.\n\nThe Regulations prohibit a person from providing funds to a relevant entity where the purpose of making those funds or economic resources available is to enable a relevant entity to grant a loan that is otherwise prohibited under regulation 17.\n\nThe Regulations also prohibit a person from directly or indirectly granting or entering into any arrangement to grant a new loan or credit to the Government of Russia (as defined in regulation 6), on or after 1 March 2022.\n\nCorrespondent banking relationships and sterling payments\n\nThe Regulations prohibit a UK credit or financial institution from establishing or continuing a correspondent banking relationship with a designated person (or a credit or financial institution which is owned or controlled by such a designated person). In this context, a “designated person” is a person designated for the purposes of regulation 17A.\n\nThe Regulations also prohibit a UK credit or financial institution from processing a payment (in any currency) to, from or via, a designated person, or a credit or financial institution owned or controlled by a designated person.\n\nThe Regulations make clear that, for the purposes of the prohibition in regulation 17A(2), processing does not include the initial crediting of a payment to an account which is in the name of a UK credit or financial institution (and not in the name of a customer).\n\nInvestments in relation to non-government controlled Ukrainian territory\n\nThe Regulations prohibit:\n\ndirectly or indirectly acquiring, extending a participation, or acquiring any ownership interest in land located in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory\n\ndirectly or indirectly acquiring, extending a participation, or acquiring any ownership interest in an entity which has a place of business located in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory (“a relevant entity”)\n\ndirectly or indirectly granting any loan or credit, entering into any arrangement to grant a loan or credit or otherwise provide funds, including equity capital, to a relevant entity or for the purpose of financing the relevant entity\n\ndirectly or indirectly establishing any joint venture in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory or with a relevant entity\n\nproviding investment services directly related to the activities referred to in the 4 bullet points above\n\nProvision of financial services for the purpose of foreign exchange reserve and asset management\n\nThe Regulations prohibit a UK individual or entity from providing financial services for the purpose of foreign exchange reserve and asset management to:\n\nthe Central Bank of the Russian Federation\n\nthe National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation\n\nthe Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation\n\na person owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any of the persons above; or\n\na person acting on behalf of or at the direction of any of the persons above\n\n“Foreign exchange reserve and asset management” means activities relating to the reserves or assets of the persons listed above. Such reserves or assets include money market instruments (including cheques, bills and certificates of deposit); foreign exchange; derivative products (including futures and options); exchange rate and interest rate instruments (including products such as swaps and forward rate agreements); transferable securities; other negotiable instruments and financial assets (including bullion, such as gold); and special drawing rights. For example, it is prohibited to provide financial services to carry out transactions with the Central Bank of the Russian Federation involving its gold.\n\nInvestments in relation to Russia\n\nThe Regulations prohibit:\n\ndirect acquisition of any ownership interest in Russian land and persons connected with Russia\n\nindirect acquisition of any ownership interest in Russian land and persons connected with Russia for the purpose of making funds or economic resources available directly or indirectly to, or for the benefit of, persons connected with Russia\n\ndirect or indirect acquisition of any ownership interest in entities (which are not persons connected with Russia) for the purpose of making funds or economic resources available directly or indirectly to, or for the benefit of, persons connected with Russia\n\nestablishing joint ventures with a person connected with Russia\n\nopening representative offices and establishing branches and subsidiaries in Russia; or\n\nthe provision of investment services directly related to all activities above\n\nTrust Services\n\nThe Regulations prohibit:\n\nthe provision of trust services to or for the benefit of persons designated for the purposes of this measure, and\n\nthe provision of trust services to or for the benefit of persons connected with Russia unless those services were provided immediately prior to the day the regulations come into force pursuant to an arrangement that has effect at that time\n\n“Trust services” means:\n\nthe creation of a trust or similar arrangement;\n\nthe provision of a registered office, business address, correspondence address or administrative address for a trust or similar arrangement;\n\nthe operation or management of a trust or similar arrangement;\n\nacting or arranging for another person to act as trustee of a trust or similar arrangement.\n\nTrust services are provided “for the benefit of” where the person (“P”):\n\nis a beneficiary of a trust or similar arrangement,\n\nis a potential beneficiary in a document from the settlor relating to a trust or similar arrangement (such as a letter of wishes), or\n\nhaving regard to all the circumstances, P might reasonably be expected to obtain, or be able to obtain, a significant financial benefit from the trust or similar arrangement.\n\n“beneficiary”, “potential beneficiary” and “settlor”, in relation to an arrangement similar to a trust, means those individuals who hold equivalent or similar positions to those described in the sub-paragraphs above in respect of a trust.\n\nSuspension of Banking Act 2009 requirement to recognise third-country resolution actions\n\nThe Regulations disapply the Bank of England’s statutory duty under section 89H(2) of the Banking Act 2009 to make a decision in respect of recognition notifications from third-country resolution authorities where:\n\nthe resolved bank or financial institution is a designated person subject to an asset freeze; or\n\nthe resolved bank or financial institution is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such a designated person.\n\nThis means that the Bank of England will not make a decision under section 89(H)(2), that is to recognise, partially recognise or refuse to recognise a third-country resolution action, for as long as the resolved institution in question is designated as subject to an asset freeze or is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a person who is designated as subject to an asset freeze under the Russia Regulations.\n\n1.5 Director disqualification sanctions\n\nWhere a person is designated under regulation 5 for the purpose of director disqualification sanctions under regulation 19B, this means that they are subject to the provisions of section 11A of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 (CDDA) and Article 15A of the Company Directors Disqualification (Northern Ireland) Order 2002 (CDD(NI)O).\n\nThe effect of the provision is to disqualify persons designated for this purpose under regulation 5 from being a director of a UK company or directly or indirectly taking part in or being concerned in the promotion, formation or management of a company.\n\nUnder section 11A of CDDA (and, in Northern Ireland, under the equivalent Article 15A of CDD(NI)O), it will be an offence for a person subject to ‘director disqualification sanctions’ as set out in section 3A of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA) to act as a director of a company or directly or indirectly to take part in or be concerned in the promotion, formation or management of a company, unless a licence has been issued by virtue of the powers granted in section 15(4A) of SAMLA and set out in regulation 64A.\n\nCompanies House and the Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland) are responsible for recording information about director disqualification sanctions in their respective Disqualified Director Registers. Companies House is responsible for annotating the Companies Register and preventing registration of a disqualified director’s appointments. The Insolvency Service will assess and grant or refuse licence applications on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Insolvency Service also has the power to bring prosecutions for breaches of the legislation, and, where appropriate, to refer cases to other law enforcement agencies for potential prosecution.\n\n1.6 Trade sanctions\n\nThe Regulations impose trade prohibitions relating to:\n\nmilitary goods and military technology (as specified in Schedule 2 to the Export Control Order 2008)\n\nany thing which falls within Chapter 93 of the Goods Classification Table[^1], other than military goods\n\ndefence and security goods and defence and security technology (as specified in Schedule 3C) and including interception and monitoring goods and interception and monitoring technology)\n\ndual-use goods and technology (as specified in Annex I to Council Regulation 428/2009 as retained by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (‘the Dual-Use Regulation’))\n\nspecial materials and related equipment and materials processing (as specified in Parts 1A and 1B of Schedule 2A to the Regulations)\n\ncritical-industry goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2A to the Regulations)\n\nquantum computing and advanced materials goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2E to the Regulations)\n\naviation and space goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2C to the Regulations)\n\njet fuel and fuel additives (as specified in Part 8 of Schedule 2A to the Regulations)\n\nmaritime goods and maritime technology (defined by reference to Chapter 4 (Navigation Equipment) and Chapter 5 (Radio-Communication Equipment) of Annex 1 of Merchant Shipping Notice 1874(a))\n\ninfrastructure-related goods (as specified in Part 3 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations)\n\nenergy-related goods (as specified in Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the Regulations) and energy-related services\n\noil refining goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 2D to the Regulations)\n\nluxury goods (as specified in Schedule 3A to the Regulations)\n\nG7 dependency and further goods (as specified in Schedule 3E to the Regulations)\n\ngoods originating in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory\n\niron and steel products (as specified in Schedule 3B to the Regulations) and associated ancillary services\n\niron and steel products processed in a third country (as specified in Part 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 3B to the Regulations) and associated ancillary services, from 30 September 2023\n\nmetals (as specified in Schedule 3BA to the Regulations)\n\noil and oil products (as specified in Schedule 3F to the Regulations)\n\nthe supply or delivery by ship of oil and oil products under the commodity codes 2709 and 2710 from Russia to and between third countries and related services\n\ncoal and coal products (as specified in Schedule 3H to the Regulations)\n\nliquefied natural gas (as specified in Chapter 4L to the Regulations).\n\ngold, gold jewellery and products related to gold (as specified in Schedule 3G to the Regulations)\n\nbanknotes denominated in sterling and any official currency of the European Union\n\ngoods which generate significant revenues for Russia (as specified in Schedule 3D and Schedule 3DA to the Regulations)\n\ndiamonds and diamond jewellery (as specified in Schedule 3GA to the Regulations)\n\ncertain diamonds processed in third country\n\nRussia’s vulnerable goods (as specified in Schedule 3I to the Regulations)\n\nprovision of technical assistance, armed personnel, financial services or funds, or associated brokering services where such provision enables or facilitates the conduct of certain military activities\n\nservices relating to a relevant infrastructure sector in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory\n\nservices relating to tourism in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory\n\ninternet services\n\nprofessional and business services (as specified in Chapter 6B to the Regulations)\n\nTechnical Guidance on interception and monitoring\n\nThere are circumstances (set out in the relevant lists of controlled items) in which certain items are not controlled, for example when body armour or a helmet is accompanying a person for that person’s own protection. Please check the relevant lists as applicable.\n\nEnergy-related goods, infrastructure-related goods, aviation and space goods, oil refining goods, G7 dependency and further goods, luxury goods, iron and steel products, metals, revenue generating goods, Russia’s vulnerable goods, coal and coal products, oil and oil products, gold and diamonds are identified by reference to commodity codes in the Goods Classification Table. The UK Tariff sets out a system for the classification of goods for importers to ascertain the applicable rate of import duty for their goods. It is this system of classification that is used in the Regulations in order to determine whether these goods are within scope of the prohibitions.\n\nThis means that where commodity codes are used in the Regulations, the relevant goods are those which would be classified under the relevant commodity code (applying the rules in the UK Tariff) if the goods were being imported to the UK.\n\nSome of the listings of commodity codes in the Regulations have an “ex” before the code. Where this “ex” appears before a commodity code this means the prohibitions in the Regulations do not apply to all of the items under that commodity code. The prohibitions will only apply to those items that (1) would be classified under the commodity code and (2) match the description given next to the relevant “ex” code entry in the Regulations.\n\nEuropean Union sanctions measures as pertain to the import and export of goods automatically apply in Northern Ireland. Traders should refer to the UK Integrated online Tariff and the Northern Ireland Integrated Online Tariff to confirm what import duties apply in Northern Ireland. EU import and export restrictions on goods are detailed in Council Regulations (EU) No 833/2014 as amended from time to time. Be sure to consider the most updated version of that Regulation.\n\nFurther detail on these trade prohibitions, including key terminology used, is explained below. Please have regard to the relevant legislation which contains full definitions of terms used herein.\n\nExport of goods\n\nThe concept of ‘export’ is set out in customs legislation, but is further detailed in Paragraph 32 of Schedule 1 to the Sanctions Act, which clarifies that “export” means export from the UK, but does not capture where goods are removed to the Isle of Man from the UK. For the purposes of Chapter 4JA (gold jewellery and relevant processed gold), the concept of ‘export’ refers to export from Russia, which is defined within the chapter itself.\n\nThe export prohibitions at regulation 22 (restricted goods) prohibit the export of certain goods to Russia as well as exports that are for use in Russia. This means that, even if the immediate destination is not Russia, the prohibition may still apply.\n\nRegulation 30B prohibits the export of relevant restricted goods to non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.\n\nRegulation 40 prohibits the export of energy-related goods to, or for use in, Russia.\n\nRegulation 46B prohibits the export of luxury goods to, or for use in, Russia. According to Part 2 of Schedule 3A (Luxury Goods), “sales price! threshold means the sales price of the item or quantity specified excluding value added taxes but including freight/transport costs.\n\nRegulation 46M prohibits the export, supply or delivery and making available of sterling or European Union denominated banknotes to, or for use in, Russia or to a person connected with Russia.\n\nRegulation 46N prohibits the export of jet fuel and fuel additives to, or for use in, Russia.\n\nThe export prohibitions in Chapter 5 (infrastructure-related goods) prohibit certain exports to and for use in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory. This means that, even if the immediate destination is not non-government controlled Ukrainian territory, the prohibition may still apply.\n\nRegulation 46Y prohibits the export, supply or delivery, and making available of G7 dependency and further goods to, or for use in, Russia.\n\nRegulation 46Z30 prohibits the export of Russia’s vulnerable goods to, or for use in Russia. This measure came into force on 1 January 2023.\n\nExporters should check the ultimate end use of goods and may apply for a licence or contact the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) if they know or think the items may be used in Russia or in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.\n\nA sanctions licence is not required for exports of non-military goods covered by the Regulations from Northern Ireland to an EU Member State where the final destination is Russia or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory (as applicable). You will however have to comply with any licensing requirements that apply in the relevant EU Member State for the onward export to Russia or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory. You will also have to comply with any other licensing requirements under UK export control legislation as applicable.\n\nImport of goods\n\nThe concept of ‘import’ is set out in customs legislation but is further detailed in Paragraph 33 of Schedule 1 to the Sanctions Act. This clarifies in particular that goods removed to the UK from the Isle of Man are not to be regarded as imported. Paragraph 34 details limited exceptions to this.\n\nThe import prohibitions in regulation 23 (arms and related materiel), regulations 46D and 46IB (iron and steel products), 46IG (metals) regulations 46S and 46XB (Schedules 3D and 3DA revenue generating goods), regulation 46Z4 (oil and oil products), regulation 46Z18 (coal and coal products), 46Z16K (diamonds and diamond jewellery) and 46Z25 (liquefied natural gas) cover goods that are consigned from Russia and goods that originated in Russia. This means that even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from was not Russia, the prohibition may still apply.\n\nThe import prohibitions in regulation 47 cover imports of goods which originated in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory. This means that even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from was not non-government controlled Ukrainian territory, the prohibition may still apply.\n\nThe import prohibition in regulation 46Z11 (Chapter 4J) covers gold (Part 2 of Schedule 3G) that originates in Russia, where this is exported from Russia on or after 21 July 2022. This means that even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from was not Russia, the prohibition may still apply if the Russian origin gold was exported from Russia on, or after, 21 July 2022.\n\nThe import prohibition in regulation 46Z16B (Chapter 4JA) covers gold jewellery (Part 3 of Schedule 3G) that originates in Russia, where this is exported from Russia on or after 29 October 2022. This means that even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from was not Russia, the prohibition may still apply if the Russian origin gold jewellery was exported from Russia on or after 29 October 2022.\n\nThe import prohibition in regulation 46Z16C (Chapter 4JA) covers relevant processed gold, defined as gold (Part 2 of Schedule 3G) that has been processed in a third country and incorporates gold that, on or after 21 July 2022, originated in and has been exported from Russia. This means that even if the immediate place the goods were shipped from or processed in was not Russia, the prohibition may still apply if the goods incorporate gold that originated in and has been exported from Russia on or after 21 July 2022.\n\nTherefore, importers should check the original place goods were consigned or exported from and apply for a licence or contact DBT’s Import Controls Team if they think the items may have originated in or have been consigned from Russia or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.\n\nA sanctions licence is not required for imports from an EU Member State into Northern Ireland of non-military goods covered by the Regulations which originate in or are consigned from Russia or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory (as applicable). You will however have to comply with any licensing requirements that apply in the relevant EU Member State for the original import into the customs territory of the EU. You will also have to comply with any other licensing requirements under UK import control legislation as applicable.\n\nThe import prohibition in regulation 46IA and 46IB (Chapter 4CA) on relevant iron and steel products processed in third countries which incorporate relevant iron and steel products of Russian origin applied from 30 September 2023. Please refer to the Notice for Importers for specific guidance on the scope of the measure, and how businesses can demonstrate compliance.\n\nThe import prohibition in regulation 46Z16R (Chapter 4JC) on certain diamonds processed in third countries and of Russian origin applies from 1st March 2024 for diamonds larger than or equal to 1 carat or 0.2 grams (or equivalent) in weight. Please refer to the Notice for Importers for specific guidance on the scope of the measure and how business can demonstrate compliance.\n\nSupply and delivery of goods\n\nSupply and delivery prohibitions in the Regulations prohibit a person from directly or indirectly supplying or delivering certain goods from a third country to a place in Russia (or to non-government controlled Ukrainian territory in respect of Chapter 5, infrastructure-related goods) or from a place in Russia to a third country and between third countries.\n\nRegulation 24 (restricted goods), regulation 41 (energy related goods), regulation 46B (luxury goods), regulation 46N (jet fuel and fuel additives), regulation 46Y (G7 dependency and further goods), and 46Z30 (Russia’s vulnerable list) prohibit the direct or indirect supply or delivery from a third country to a place in Russia.\n\nRegulation 30C prohibits the direct or indirect supply or delivery of relevant restricted goods from a third country to a place in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.\n\nRegulation 46F (iron and steel products) prohibits the direct or indirect supply or delivery of certain iron and steel products from a place in Russia to a third country.\n\nRegulation 46II (metals) prohibits the direct or indirect supply or delivery of metals from a place in Russia to a third country.\n\nRegulation 46M (banknotes) prohibits the direct or indirect supply or delivery or making available of sterling banknotes or any banknotes denominated in any official currency of the European Union to a person connected with Russia. It also prohibits making available such banknotes for use in Russia.\n\nRegulation 46XD (Schedule 3DA revenue generating goods) prohibits the direct or indirect supply or delivery of revenue generating goods listed in Schedule 3DA from a place in Russia to a third country.\n\nRegulation 46Z9B (Maritime transportation of certain oil and oil products to and between third countries) prohibits the direct or indirect supply or delivery by ship of oil and oil products under the commodity codes 2709 and 2710 from a place in Russia to a third country or between third countries.\n\nRegulation 46Z16M (diamonds and diamond jewellery) prohibits the direct or indirect supply and delivery of diamonds and diamond jewellery from a place in Russia to a third country.\n\nRegulations 24(4) and 41(4) specify that for the purposes of those prohibitions a “third country” is a country that is not the UK, Isle of Man or Russia. Regulation 49(4) specifies that for the purposes of that prohibition a “third country” is a country that is not the UK, Isle of Man or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.\n\nMaking available or acquiring goods and technology\n\nProhibitions in the Regulations (aside from those in Chapter 5) on making certain goods or technology available (e.g. through a sale) include directly or indirectly making them available for use in Russia or to a “person connected with Russia”. Some of the prohibitions also prohibit directly or indirectly acquiring certain goods or technology which originate in Russia or which are located in Russia or from a person connected with Russia.\n\nFor Schedule 3D revenue generating goods (regulation 46T), oil and oil products (regulation 46Z5), coal and coal products (regulation 46Z19), and liquefied natural gas (regulation 46Z26), the direct and indirect acquisition of those goods, which originate in or are located in Russia, with the intention of those goods entering the United Kingdom is prohibited.\n\nFor gold (regulation 46Z12) and gold jewellery (regulation 46Z16D) the direct and indirect acquisition of those goods, which originate in and which are located in, or (in the case of gold jewellery) have been exported after 29 October 2022 from Russia, with the intention of those goods entering the United Kingdom is prohibited.\n\nFor iron and steel products (regulation 46E), metals (regulation 46IH), Schedule 3DA revenue generating goods (regulation 46XC), and diamonds and diamond jewellery (regulation 46Z16L), the direct and indirect acquisition of those goods, which originate in Russia or are located in Russia is prohibited regardless of whether the person acquiring them intends to bring the goods into the United Kingdom.\n\nRegulation 42 prohibits making energy related goods available for use in Russia or to a person connected with Russia.\n\nProhibitions in Chapter 5 on making infrastructure-related goods available include directly or indirectly making them available for use in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory or to a “person connected with non-government controlled Ukrainian territory”.\n\nRegulation 21 sets out when a person is to be regarded as “connected with” Russia and when a person is to be regarded as “connected with” non-government controlled Ukrainian territory (and this applies where these terms are used in other trade prohibitions in this Part of the Regulations).\n\nTransfer of technology\n\nProhibitions in the Regulations on the transfer of certain technology include transfer to a place in Russia or a person connected with Russia.\n\nRegulation 26 (restricted technology) also prohibits transfer to persons outside the UK or to a place outside the UK, where the transfer is from a place in Russia.\n\nThe term ‘transfer’ is defined in Paragraph 37 of Schedule 1 to the Sanctions Act, which states that it ‘means a transfer by any means (or combination of means), including oral communication and that transfer of goods on which the technology is recorded or from which it can be derived, other than the export of such goods.’\n\nWhere restricted technology is contained within a good, that good would be classified, respectively, as a restricted good under the accompanying goods-related provisions. This includes information contained on USB memory devices, laptops, tablets and the like.\n\nTechnical assistance\n\nThe term “technical assistance” in relation to goods or technology is defined in regulation 21, which states that it means:\n\ntechnical support relating to the repair, development, production, assembly, testing, use or maintenance of the goods or technology, or\n\nany other technical service relating to the goods or technology\n\nProhibitions apply where the technical assistance relates to certain specified goods or technology.\n\nThe prohibitions apply to the direct or indirect provision of such technical assistance in relation to goods covered by an export prohibition (1) to persons “connected with Russia” or (2) for use in Russia, except those in Chapter 5 which apply where the provision applies (1) to persons “connected with non-government controlled Ukrainian territory” or (2) for use in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.\n\nThis means that, even if the person to whom you are providing the relevant technical assistance is not in or “connected with Russia” (or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory, for Chapters 2A and 5), the prohibition may still apply if the goods or technology to which the technical assistance relates are for use in Russia (or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory, for Chapters 2A and 5). Therefore, if you are providing technical assistance, you should check whether the goods or technology may be used in Russia or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory, as appropriate, and apply for a licence or contact ECJU if so.\n\nRegulation 46A prohibits the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance to or for the benefit of persons designated for the purpose of this regulation, where that assistance relates to an aircraft or ship. The persons designated for the purposes of this provision are set out in the UK Sanctions List under ‘sanctions imposed’.\n\nThe prohibition applies in relation to any aircraft or ship. You should carry out your own checks to determine to whom, or for whose benefit, you are providing technical assistance related to aircraft or ships.\n\nIn relation to goods covered by prohibitions on import, [supply and delivery or acquisition], the measures apply to the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance relating to the import, [supply and delivery] or acquisition of the prohibited goods.\n\nThe following Regulations prohibit the direct or indirect provision of technical assistance to specific arrangements:\n\nRegulation 27 (relating to restricted goods and restricted technology)\n\nRegulation 30F (relating to relevant restricted goods and relevant restricted technology in relation to non-government controlled Ukraine)\n\nRegulation 43 (relating to energy-related goods)\n\nRegulation 46A (relating to aircraft and ships)\n\nRegulation 46BA (relating to luxury goods)\n\nRegulations 46G and 46IC (relating to iron and steel products)\n\nRegulation 46O (relating to jet fuel and fuel additives)\n\nRegulation 46V (relating to Schedule 3D revenue generating goods)\n\nRegulation 46XE (relating to Schedule 3DA revenue generating goods)\n\nRegulation 46Z (relating to G7 dependency and further goods)\n\nRegulation 46Z7 (relating to oil and oil products)\n\nRegulation 46Z14 (relating to gold)\n\nRegulation 46Z16E (relating to gold jewellery)\n\nRegulation 46Z16F (relating to relevant processed gold)\n\nRegulation 46Z16N (relating to diamonds and diamond jewellery)\n\nRegulation 46Z16S (relating to certain diamonds processed in a third country)\n\nRegulation 46Z21 (relating to coal and coal products)\n\nRegulation 46Z27 (relating to liquefied natural gas)\n\nRegulation 46Z31 (relating to Russia’s vulnerable goods)\n\nRegulation 51 (relating to infrastructure-related goods in relation to non-government controlled Ukraine)\n\nFinancial services and funds related to goods and technology\n\n‘Financial services’ refer to any services of a financial nature in many different forms including insurance and banking. Financial services include payment and money transmission services. The full definition of ‘financial services’ can be found in Section 61 of the Sanctions Act.\n\n‘Funds’ means financial assets and benefits of every kind, including cash, securities and interest. The full definition of ‘funds’ can be found in Section 60 of the Sanctions Act.\n\nTrade sanctions prohibitions on the provision of financial services and funds apply where they relate to certain specified goods or technology.\n\nThe prohibitions in the Regulations apply to the direct or indirect provision of financial services, and the direct or indirect making available of funds to persons connected with Russia (or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory, in respect of Chapters 2A and 5).\n\nThese prohibitions also prohibit the direct or indirect provision of financial services or funds in pursuance of or in connection with specific arrangements involving Russia (or non-government controlled Ukrainian territory in respect of Chapters 2A and 5).\n\nThe following regulations prohibit the direct or indirect provision of financial services to specific arrangements:\n\nRegulation 28 (relating to restricted goods and restricted technology)\n\nRegulation 30G (relating to relevant restricted goods and relevant restricted technology in relation to non-government controlled Ukraine)\n\nRegulation 44 (relating to energy-related goods)\n\nRegulation 46BB (relating to luxury goods)\n\nRegulations 46H and 46ID (relating to iron and steel products)\n\nRegulation 46P (relating to jet fuel and fuel additives)\n\nRegulation 46W (relating to Schedule 3D revenue generating goods)\n\nRegulation 46XF (relating to Schedule 3DA revenue generating goods)\n\nRegulation 46Z1 (relating to G7 dependency and further goods)\n\nRegulation 46Z8 (relating to oil and oil products)\n\nRegulation 46Z9C (relating to maritime transportation of certain oil and oil products)\n\nRegulation 46Z15 (relating to gold)\n\nRegulation 46Z16G (relating to gold jewellery)\n\nRegulation 46Z16H (relating to relevant processed gold)\n\nRegulation 46Z16O (relating to diamonds and diamond jewellery)\n\nRegulation 46Z16T (relating to certain diamonds processed in a third country)\n\nRegulation 46Z22 (relating to coal and coal products)\n\nRegulation 46Z28 (relating to liquefied natural gas)\n\nRegulation 46Z32 (relating to Russia’s vulnerable goods)\n\nRegulation 52 (relating to infrastructure-related goods in relation to non-government controlled Ukraine)\n\nBrokering services\n\nThe definition of ‘brokering services’ is set out in regulation 21, which states that it means any service to secure, or otherwise in relation to, an arrangement, including (but not limited to):\n\nthe selection or introduction of persons as parties or potential parties to the arrangement\n\nthe negotiation of the arrangement\n\nthe facilitation of anything that enables the arrangement to be entered into, and\n\nthe provision of any assistance that in any way promotes or facilitates the arrangement\n\nThe Regulations prohibit the direct or indirect provision of brokering services where they relate to specific arrangements. Those arrangements are set out in:\n\nRegulation 29 (non-UK activity relating to restricted goods and restricted technology)\n\nRegulation 30H (non-UK activity relating to the non-government controlled Ukrainian territory limited goods and non-government controlled Ukrainian territory limited technology)\n\nRegulation 45 (non-UK activity relating to energy-related goods and energy-related technology)\n\nRegulation 46BC (relating to luxury goods)\n\nRegulations 46I and 46IE (relating to iron and steel products)\n\nRegulation 46Q (relating to jet fuel and fuel additives)\n\nRegulation 46X (relating to revenue generating goods)\n\nRegulation 46XG (relating to Schedule 3DA revenue generating goods)\n\nRegulation 46Z2 (relating to G7 dependency and further goods)\n\nRegulation 46Z9 (relating to oil and oil products)\n\nRegulation 46Z9D (relating to maritime transportation of certain oil and oil products)\n\nRegulation 46Z16 (relating to gold)\n\nRegulation 46Z16I (relating to gold jewellery and relevant processed gold)\n\nRegulation 46Z16P (relating to diamonds and diamond jewellery)\n\nRegulation 46Z16U (relating to certain diamonds processed in a third country)\n\nRegulation 46Z23 (relating to coal and coal products)\n\nRegulation 46Z29 (relating to liquefied natural gas)\n\nRegulation 46Z33 (relating to Russia’s vulnerable goods)\n\nRegulation 53 (non-UK activity relating to infrastructure-related goods and goods from non-government controlled Ukrainian territory)\n\nOther service provisions\n\nCertain other services are prohibited in the Regulations. These include the provision of certain services which enable or facilitate certain military activities, insurance and reinsurance services, energy-related services, infrastructure-related services, tourism-related services, internet services, other professional and business services, which in the Regulations refers to accounting, advertising, architectural, auditing, business and management consulting, engineering, IT consultancy and design, and public relations services, legal advisory services.\n\nAs set out in regulation 30, the direct or indirect provision of the following services is prohibited where such provision enables or facilitates the conduct of military activities carried on or proposed to be carried on by the Russian military or any other military end-user who is a person connected with Russia:\n\na) technical assistance\n\nb) armed personnel\n\nc) financial services or funds, or\n\nd) brokering services in relation to an arrangement whose object or effect is to provide, in a non-UK country any of the services mentioned in paragraphs (a) - (c)\n\nProvisions on insurance and reinsurance services are set out in regulation 29A and prohibit the direct or indirect provision of insurance and reinsurance services where it relates to aviation and space goods and aviation and space technology.\n\nThe prohibitions apply to the direct or indirect provision of insurance and reinsurance services (1) to persons “connected with Russia” or (2) for use in Russia. This means that, even if the person to whom you are providing the relevant insurance or reinsurance service is not in or “connected with Russia” (as defined in Regulation 21), the prohibition may still apply if the goods or technology to which the service relates are for use in Russia.\n\nIt would not apply where the insurance is for the benefit of the non-Russian owner of the items, rather than their user or operator. Nor does it apply where the items either remain in Russia as the result of the termination of a lease and against the lessor’s will; or are being flown out of Russia in the process of returning them to their owner.\n\nThe provision of insurance and reinsurance services in respect of a satellite where the only nexus with Russia is that it is orbiting over Russia, or broadcasting to Russia (and where the insurance and reinsurance services will not be provided to a person connected with Russia), would likewise not come within the scope of these prohibitions.\n\nTherefore, if you are providing insurance or reinsurance services you should check whether the goods or technology may be used in Russia, and apply for a licence or contact ECJU if so.\n\nProvisions on energy-related services are set out in regulation 46 and prohibit the direct or indirect provision of “relevant energy services”, defined as certain “specified services” necessary for an “oil or gas exploration or production project” in Russia. The specified services being drilling, well testing, logging and completion services, and the supply of specialised floating vehicles.\n\nProvisions on infrastructure-related services and tourism-related services are set out in regulation 54 and prohibit the provision of services relating to certain specified infrastructure sectors or services relating to tourism in non-government controlled Ukrainian territory.\n\nProvisions on internet services are set out in regulation 54A and require social media companies, and internet service providers, to take reasonable steps to prevent their users from encountering or accessing services or content online directly generated, shared or uploaded by a designated person. Application store providers must also take reasonable steps to prevent users from using their services to download or access internet services provided by a designated person. Designations for the purposes of these measures will be made by the Secretary of State and published on the UK Sanctions List.\n\nTherefore, if you are an internet service provider, or provide a social media service or application store for internet service applications, then you should check whether an entity has been designated by the UK Government for this purpose and take the necessary action to ensure compliance with the prohibitions.\n\nRegulation 46K prohibits the provision of interception and monitoring services to, or for the benefit of, the Government of Russia (as defined in Regulation 6).\n\nTechnical guidance on interception and monitoring\n\nProhibitions on the provision of professional and business services (accounting, advertising, architectural, auditing, business and management consulting, engineering, IT consultancy and design, and public relations services) are set out in regulation 54C. These prohibit the direct or indirect provision of such services to persons connected with Russia.\n\nThe provision of legal services is likely to be restricted under a number of regulations (for example, the circumvention regulations at Regulations 19 and 55). Regulation 54D supplements these general restrictions and specifically prohibits legal advisory services in relation to certain activity which would be prohibited if done by a UK person or taking place in the UK.\n\nProvision of services via any or all of modes of service supply 1, 2, 3, or 4, as defined under the World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), to any person connected with Russia is covered by the prohibitions. This would include the cross-border supply of such services by a UK services provider to another company incorporated under Russian law and the provision of services to Russian residents who are temporarily located in another country, including the UK.\n\nPlease refer to Schedule 3J in the Regulations for the definitions of prohibited services. Several of these definitions are presented as references to Central Product Classification (CPC) codes. Where they are presented in this way, it is recommended that you review your activity against the correct version (for example: Provisional, 1.0, 1.1, 2, or 2.1) and individual code numbers (for example, “CPC 8671 – Architectural services”) that correspond to each prohibition. This information will enable you to navigate to the relevant definitions at the following link: CPC Codes.\n\nThough the accounting and auditing services definitions are based on CPC codes, they are defined in Schedule 3J for clarity, given the differences in exceptions and licensing which apply to these two sectors. The definition of accounting services is based on the Provisional Central Product Classification (CPC) Codes 1991 and includes CPC 86212 Accounting Review Services, CPC 86213 Compilation of Financial Statements services, CPC 86219 Other Accounting Services and CPC 86220 Bookkeeping Services, except tax returns. The definition of auditing services is also based on the Provisional CPC Code 1991, CPC 86211 Financial Auditing Services.\n\nThe definitions of business and management consulting and public relations services are not based on CPC codes, but instead on Extended Balance of Payments Services classification (EBOPS) 2010 and includes EBOPS 10.2.1.3 - (Business and management consulting and public relations services includes advisory, guidance and operational assistance services provided to businesses for business policy and strategy, and the overall planning, structuring and control of an organization.)\n\nThe Department for Business and Trade (DBT) has overall responsibility for trade sanctions licensing.

The Regulations also confer powers on the Secretary of State and harbour authorities to issue port barring directions to the master or pilot of a specified ship. The Regulations provide the Secretary of State with a power to control the movement of Russian ships or specified ships by requiring them to leave or enter specified ports, proceed to a specified place or remain where they are.\n\nThe Regulations prohibit the registration of ships owned, controlled, chartered or operated by designated persons or persons connected with Russia on the UK Ship Register and confer powers on the Secretary of State to direct the UK Ship Registrar to terminate the registration of such ships.\n\nThe Regulations also confer powers on the Secretary of State and harbour authorities to detain Russian ships or specified ships at ports or anchorages.\n\n‘Russian ship’ is not a term used in the Regulations. However, it is used in this shipping section of the guidance to aid understanding and readability. It means a ship which is:\n\nowned, controlled, chartered or operated by a designated person\n\nowned, controlled, chartered or operated by persons connected with Russia\n\nregistered in Russia, or\n\nflying the flag of Russia\n\nThese sanctions do not apply to other ships originating from or destined for Russian ports; ships carrying cargo to or from Russia are not within scope of the transport sanctions unless they fall within the definition of a Russian ship or specified ship as above. These Regulations do not apply to ships (that are not otherwise included in the Regulations) with Russian crews or Masters, unless they are a designated person.\n\nThe Regulations also provide the Secretary of State with the power to issue directions in relation to the movement of British cruise ships, preventing them from entering any ports located in Crimea, or in the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Such a direction can be given to any master or pilot of a British ship which is a cruise ship (defined as a ship which is providing cruise services).\n\nAircraft sanctions\n\nThe Regulations prohibit a Russian aircraft which is owned, chartered or operated by persons connected with Russia or designated persons from overflying the United Kingdom or landing in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn addition, they provide a power for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to refuse to register an aircraft or for the Secretary of State to direct the CAA to terminate the registration of an aircraft that is owned or operated by a designated person or chartered by a designated person.\n\nThey confer direction making powers for the Secretary of State, air traffic control and airport operators regarding aircraft movements in United Kingdom airspace and at United Kingdom airports. The Regulations also provide a power for the Secretary of State to direct an airport operator to secure the detention of a Russian aircraft at an airport or to secure the movement of a Russian aircraft to a specified airport.\n\nRussian aircraft is defined as an aircraft:\n\nowned, chartered or operated by a designated person, or a person connected with Russia, or\n\nregistered in Russia\n\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) is ultimately responsible for the implementation of these transport restrictions, some of which are enforced through the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, harbour authorities, National Air Traffic Services Limited (NATS), Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and airport operators.\n\n1.8 Immigration sanctions\n\nThe effect of the Regulations is to impose a travel ban on persons designated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of being made subject to immigration sanctions under the Sanctions Act. Such persons are excluded persons for the purposes of Section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971.\n\nDesignated individuals will be refused leave to enter or remain in the UK. Any application they make for a visa to travel to the UK, including for transit purposes, will be refused. Any foreign national who is subject to a travel ban under the Regulations, and who is currently in the UK, will have their permission to stay in the UK cancelled and steps will be taken to remove them from the UK.\n\nIf you are the subject of an immigration sanction and try to travel to the UK, carriers are required to deny you boarding.\n\nFurther information on how the Home Office deals with those who are subject to a travel ban can be found on the Home Office pages of GOV.UK.\n\n1.9 Information and record keeping\n\nPart 8 of the Regulations places obligations on relevant firms (the definition of which is set out in the Regulations) to report information to HM Treasury about known or suspected designated persons or about persons who may have committed an offence under the Regulations.\n\nPart 8 places further obligations on relevant firms to report to HM Treasury the nature and amount or quantity of any funds or economic resources that it knows or suspects that it holds for the Central Bank of Russia, Russian Ministry of Finance, Russian National Wealth Fund, persons owned or controlled directly or indirectly by these entities or persons acting on behalf of or at the direction of these entities.\n\nIt also grants powers to HM Treasury to request information from, amongst others, a designated person, including powers to request the production of documents. It also establishes offences for failing to comply with these requests (including for providing false information).\n\nPart 8 of the Regulations places an obligation on persons designated under the Russia regime to report the nature, value and location of their assets.\n\nPart 8 also establishes information powers and record-keeping responsibilities in relation to the trade sanctions contained in the Regulations. It provides for offences for failing to comply with any of those requirements or intentionally obstructing an official in the exercise of those powers.\n\nIf you have obligations or responsibilities under Part 8 of the Regulations, it is important that you familiarise yourself with them. If you are unclear of your obligations or responsibilities, you are advised to seek independent legal advice.\n\n2. How will these sanctions measures be enforced?\n\nThe Regulations make it a criminal offence to contravene the trade, aircraft, shipping and financial sanctions, as well as to enable or facilitate a contravention of, or to circumvent, any of the prohibitions in the Regulations. They also prescribe the mode of trial and penalties that apply to such offences. In some cases, offences related to contraventions of prohibitions in the Regulations are contained within other legislation, such as the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (CEMA).\n\nIn addition to the below, further details on offences and penalties can be found in the corresponding report under section 18 of the Sanctions Act.\n\n2.1 Financial sanctions\n\nBreaches of financial sanctions are a serious criminal offence. Any breach of the main financial prohibitions in the Regulations is an offence that is triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 7 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both).\n\nOffences under regulations 70(6), 70A(6) and 74 (information offences in connection with financial sanctions under the Regulations) are summary offences only and carry a maximum sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment or a fine (which in Scotland or Northern Ireland may not exceed level 5 on the standard scale) or both.\n\nOFSI is responsible for monitoring compliance with financial sanctions and for assessing suspected breaches. It also has the power to impose monetary penalties for breaches of financial sanctions and to refer cases to law enforcement agencies for investigation and potential prosecution.\n\nOFSI works with other parts of government, supervisory bodies and regulators to consider all cases reported to it, sharing relevant information accordingly.\n\nIf you find out that a person or organisation you are dealing with is subject to the financial sanctions detailed in the Regulations, you must immediately:\n\nstop dealing with them\n\nfreeze any assets you are holding for them\n\ninform OFSI as soon as possible by either emailing ofsi@hmtreasury.gov.uk or by calling their general enquiries line: +44 (0)20 7270 5454\n\nMore detailed information on OFSI’s approach to compliance and enforcement can be found in [OFSI’s guidance].(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-faqs)\n\n2.2 Director disqualification sanctions\n\nBreach of disqualified director sanctions is an offence under CDDA and CDD(NI)O. The Insolvency Service is responsible for monitoring compliance with disqualified director sanctions and for assessing suspected breaches of the main prohibitions and the licensing prohibitions. It also has the power to bring prosecutions for breaches under section 11A CDDA and refer cases to other law enforcement agencies for potential prosecution.\n\nUnder section 13 of CDDA (and in Northern Ireland, under Article 18 of CDD(NI)O), a person guilty of acting in contravention of the new section 11A (in Northern Ireland, Article 15A of CDD(NI)O) will be liable (a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for not more than 2 years or a fine, or both; and (b) on summary conviction, to imprisonment for not more than 6 months or a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or both.\n\n2.3 Trade sanctions\n\nAny breach of the trade sanctions prohibitions in the Regulations is triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both). Any breach of the trade licensing provisions is also triable either way and carries a maximum sentence on indictment of 2 years’ imprisonment or a fine (or both).\n\nThe prohibitions and requirements imposed by UK sanctions regulations apply within the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland and in relation to the conduct of all UK individuals wherever they are in the world. They also apply to UK companies incorporated or established in the UK, and to branches of UK companies overseas.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is responsible for enforcing the licensing restrictions and investigating suspected offences.\n\nHMRC undertakes a preliminary assessment into all credible intelligence / allegations of Trade Sanctions offences. HMRC has a range of enforcement options available such as education, warning letters, issuing compound settlements, seizures / disruptions and in the most serious of cases, referral to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration for prosecution.\n\nIf you discover that there is a breach of any of the trade prohibitions or licensing provisions, you should report the irregularity to HMRC as soon as possible, using the online tool to report fraud relating to import and export.\n\nFor goods and associated services, if you discover that you have breached any of the trade prohibitions or licensing provisions, you should report the irregularity to HMRC (sometimes known as ‘voluntary disclosure’) as soon as possible. If the irregularity was found on an Export Control Joint Unit compliance audit, the compliance inspector will have informed HMRC and you are strongly advised to do the same. Guidance is available on how to make a voluntary disclosure.\n\nFor accounting, advertising, architectural, auditing, business and management consulting, engineering, IT consultancy and design, and public relations services, if you discover that you have breached any of the trade prohibitions or licensing provisions, you should voluntarily disclose the irregularity by reporting it to DBT.\n\nOfcom is responsible for monitoring compliance with trade sanctions in relation to internet services, and for assessing suspected breaches.

In exercising these powers, DBT seeks and considers views from other government departments.\n\nIn making decisions on whether to grant a licence to permit something which would otherwise be prohibited under Part 5 of the Regulations, the Secretary of State will consider each application on a case-by-case basis to determine whether granting a licence would be consistent with the stated purposes of the sanctions regime and any UN or other relevant international law obligations.\n\nLicences granted will not permit activity in respect of Northern Ireland that is not consistent with EU sanctions regulations as they apply via the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n\nFor some prohibitions there are some specific activities that DBT considers are likely to be consistent with the aims of the sanctions. These are set out in the table below. If you think that your proposed activity falls within one of these specific descriptions you should make this clear and explain why you believe this to be the case in your application for a licence.\n\nYou should not assume that a licence will be granted or engage in any activities prohibited by trade sanctions until your licence has been granted.\n\nProhibition description Prohibition reference Considerations for licensing Prohibitions on the import, acquisition, export, making available, transfer, supply, or delivery of military goods or technology to, from, or for use in, Russia.
