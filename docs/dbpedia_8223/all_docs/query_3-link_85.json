        "text": "Gazprombank is the channel the West has set up for itself to keep paying for gas deliveries imported from Russia. The financial arm of Russian energy giant Gazprom and the country's third largest financial institution, it has been largely spared the waves of financial sanctions imposed by the West to weaken Moscow in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe European Union (EU) has made no secret of this decision. When the 27 member states took the unprecedented decision to disconnect seven Russian banks from the international Swift financial system in early March, they did not include Gazprombank on their list because of the heavy dependence of several European countries on Russian gas.\n\n\"Gazprombank is a low profile bank, it does not advertise too much, it is not listed on the stock exchange, its shareholding is not obvious. Its boss, Andrei Akimov, has not had a political career and stays away from the media,\" summarized a financier who knows the establishment well. In the shadow of the gas giant Gazprom, the bank nevertheless serves the interests of the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin's close circle.\n\nCentral player in the Russian economy\n\nThe banking establishment has developed rapidly and become a central player in the Russian economy. It finances companies in the mining, chemical and energy sectors, from oil exploration and the nuclear industry to equipment manufacturers.\n\nA financial tool at the heart of the country's major industrial projects, the bank is notably the co-lender of the Yamal-Europe project to build a gas pipeline linking Siberia with Europe. It has also expanded into retail banking, albeit on a small scale, with nearly five million individual customers, to collect deposits and build a network of branches throughout the country.\n\nThe institution has also opened subsidiaries and offices abroad, including one in Switzerland. \"Gazprombank has thus been able to work with all the international banks, through syndications, to finance its projects,\" said Matthieu Lacaze, a former commodities banker. \"It has also recruited foreign bankers to learn the business of international banking, bond issues.\"\n\nClose links with the Kremlin\n\nIn 2005, Kirill Shamalov, a 23-year-old law graduate from Saint Petersburg University, joined the legal department of Gazprombank. In 2013, he became Mr. Putin's son-in-law, marrying his youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova. He did not linger in the company, but his immense fortune, which he owed to Gazprombank, is indicative of the close ties between the establishment and the Kremlin."
