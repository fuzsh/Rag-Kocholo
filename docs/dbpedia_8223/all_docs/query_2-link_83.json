        "text": "PJSC Gazprom avtomatizatsiya is the general system integrator for automation, metrological support and communication facilities of PJSC Gazprom.\n\nThe company provides a full range of services for R&D, design and survey work, production, supply, installation, commissioning, service and maintenance, overhaul of APCS systems, IC, metrology, communications, telecommunications, instrumentation and power equipment. For more information on the company's products and services, see the Business Areas subsection.\n\nIn the ranking \"TAdviser100: The largest IT companies in Russia ranks 8th.\n\nPerformance indicators\n\n2022: Revenue growth by 45.2% to RUB 28.247 billion\n\nAt the end of 2022, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya 's revenue increased by 45.2% to 28.247 billion rubles (revenue from financial statements for 2021-2022 excluding VAT). In the ranking \" TAdviser100: The largest IT companies in Russia 2023,\" such an indicator allowed the company to take 20th place.\n\nHistory\n\n2023: Lawsuit and bankruptcy claim from Sampleks\n\nOn October 11, 2023, it became known that Sampleks LLC went to court with a demand to bankrupt Gazprom's system integrator, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya. According to available information, the process is related to unpaid debts.\n\nSamplex is a Russian manufacturer of insulated steel pipes and connecting parts that are used in the construction and reconstruction of oil and gas facilities. The company's website says that the geography of activities covers all the main oil and gas regions of the Russian Federation - from the Barents Sea in the north-west to Kamchatka in the east. Customers are the largest subsoil users of Russia, such as Rosneft, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Novatek.\n\nAccording to CNews, in the framework of the bankruptcy case, Sampleks demands to take interim measures in the form of a ban on shareholders to reorganize Gazprom avtomatizatsiya, and government agencies to amend the Unified State Register of Legal Entities in relation to the company. A possible reason for going to court is the debt of Gazprom Automation under the contract for the supply of goods, which was concluded in March 2022. In accordance with the terms of this document, Sampleks supplied Gazprom with products worth 332.4 million rubles for the Bovanenkovo-Labytnangi-Long-Yugan-Nadym Technological Communications facility. The customer accepted the goods, but did not pay for them in full.\n\nIn March 2023, Sampleks went to court, demanding the return of 161.6 million rubles: this claim was satisfied in full. Gazprom avtomatizatsiya is also obliged to pay a penalty of 5.3 million rubles. Thus, the total amount is 166.9 million rubles. It is also noted that from September to October 2023, at least three more companies filed lawsuits against PJSC Gazprom avtomatizatsiya for a total of 181.3 million rubles.[1]\n\n2021\n\nGazprom avtomatizatsiya reached a loss of 4.8 billion rubles\n\nIn 2021, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya 's revenue decreased by 27% compared to 2020, amounting to 19.45 billion rubles, follows from the company's financial reporting. The company received a net loss of about 4.8 billion rubles against a net profit of 50.8 million rubles a year earlier. In the ranking TAdviser100: The largest IT companies in Russia 2022 the company \"Gazprom avtomatizatsiya\" took 31st place. The revenue from the financial statements for 2020-2021 is indicated. Excluding VAT.\n\nThe Gazprom avtomatizatsiya report for 12 months states that the decrease in revenue in 2021 is due to the withdrawal from projects for facilities in Omsk: for the project for the construction of the ELOU-AUT complex (primary oil processing unit) located on the territory of Gazpromneft - ONPZ, for the complex of construction, installation and commissioning works at the treatment facilities \"Gazpromneft-ONPZ.\" The scope of work planned for 2021 was not fulfilled for these facilities.\n\nThe construction of the ELOU-AVT primary oil processing plant at the Omsk Oil Refinery is carried out as part of the second stage of a large-scale modernization of Gazprom Neft's oil refining assets, indicated on the Gazprom avtomatizatsiya website. The latter is the general construction contractor of the ELOU-AVT complex of the Omsk refinery.\n\nThe project has been going on for several years. In 2021, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya sued its contractor for this project, SK Sibmontazhproekt, citing the fact that the company violated the terms of the contract. SK Sibmontazhproekt became a contractor in 2020, now it is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings initiated at its own request in October. Omsk media wrote that its employees had complaints about the payment of salaries.\n\nAs for the net profit of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya, its decrease is largely due to a decrease in \"other income,\" according to the company's annual statements. What we are talking about here, in \"Gazprom avtomatizatsiya\" did not specify TAdviser. In 2021, the company received \"other income\" in the amount of about 670 million rubles, of which about 10 million are income from participation in other organizations. In 2020, similar indicators amounted to about 6 billion and 95 million rubles, respectively.\n\nCommercial expenses of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya in 2021 increased by 9%, management - by 14%. The main reason for this was unplanned expenses associated with a change in the structure of the company, indicated in the financial accounting. In 2021, the average number, including part-time and civil law employees, decreased by 125 people. The main decrease was due to the reduction in the number of a separate unit of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya in Omsk.\n\nGazprom avtomatizatsiya does not comment on its financial results and the project at Gazpromneft-ONPZ.\n\nThe company sees promising areas of activity in 2022, first of all, participation in infrastructure projects for the reconstruction and development of the Unified Gas Supply System, the implementation of design, construction and installation works and the supply of equipment to key facilities of the Gazprom Group, its annual report says.\n\nThe sales policy of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya for 2022 does not imply sharp changes - the priority remains the market of Gazprom enterprises and ensuring complex supplies of products for such key projects as MG Power of Siberia, Kovyktinskoye NGKM, SMG UkhtaTorzhok (3 lines), etc.\n\nAt the same time, it is planned to expand and scale work on entering sales markets that are third-party in relation to the Gazprom group. The company notes in its reporting that, due to its specialization, it is dependent on orders from Gazprom companies and other enterprises of the industry, which makes it sensitive to changes in demand on their part and the risks arising in connection with this.\n\nCEO changed in \"Gazprom avtomatizatsiya\"\n\nAccording to the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, in December 2021, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya changed its general director. Instead of Dmitry Zhuravlev, Nikolai Bobrikov was appointed to this position. According to TAdviser, Dmitry Zhuravlev no longer works not only in this company, but also in Gazstroyprom, where he was previously employed part-time.\n\n2020\n\nRevenue and profit \"Gazprom avtomatizatsiya\" showed a sharp decline. COVID-19 is to blame, but not only\n\nGazprom avtomatizatsiya 's revenue (excluding subsidiaries) in 2020 decreased by 42.24% compared to 2019, to 26.803 billion rubles excluding VAT, which follows from the company's annual report. This allowed her to take 23rd place in the ranking of TAdviser100: The largest IT companies in Russia 2021.\n\nThis decrease in turnover is largely due to the fact that in 2019 the period of the main supplies of equipment for the construction of the Amur GPP fell, the company explains in its annual report. The revenue indicator was also affected by the closure of a significant part of the construction of the ELOU-AVT complex (electric demineralization plant, atmospheric-vacuum pipe - primary oil processing plant) located on the territory of Gazpromneft - ONPZ, and the construction of the Power of Siberia main gas pipeline.\n\nThe decrease in the amount of revenue was also affected by the epidemiological situation in the country associated with COVID-19.\n\nIn the context of an unstable economic situation in 2020, caused by the threat of the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19, the main indicators of the company's activities could not be due to an absolutely stable order portfolio, the annual report said.\n\nAnd net profit in 2020 decreased even more - from about 2.26 billion to 50.83 million rubles - that is, 44.5 times. The decrease in net profit is largely due to a decrease in income from participation in subsidiaries, explains in the annual report of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya. This revenue item showed a decrease from 2.35 billion to 95 billion rubles.\n\nAt the same time, in 2020, commercial expenses of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya decreased by 55%, and management expenses by 20%. The main reason that influenced this was the reduction in the wage bill. In 2020, labor costs decreased by 17.2% compared to 2019.\n\nAt the same time, the average number of employees, including part-time and contract workers, did not decrease, but grew by 2%, to 1.22 thousand people. And labor productivity in 2020 compared to last year decreased by 43%, the data are given in the annual report of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya.\n\nThe priority for the company remains the market of Gazprom Group enterprises. In 2021, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya connects promising areas of its activities primarily with participation in the projects of the Gazprom Group, as well as with participation in the project of a large-scale modernization of Gazprom Neft's oil refining assets at the Omsk Refinery.\n\nAt the same time, the reduction in Gazprom's investment program and the reduction in Gazprom avtomatizatsiya 's order portfolio indicates as one of the main risks for itself.\n\nThe financial indicators of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya, we can say, to some extent followed the indicators of its main customer: the profit attributable to the shareholders of PJSC Gazprom in 2020 decreased by 88.7% compared to the previous year, or 8.8 times. If in 2019 it amounted to more than 1.2 trillion rubles, then in 2020 - only 135.3 billion rubles. The main reasons for the decline were the depreciation of the ruble and the fall in gas[2] prices, [3].\n\nThe priority area of ​ ​ activity of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya, as in previous years, is the development of its own production, according to its annual report. In 2021, it will be aimed at bringing to the market the following types of products: serial automated control systems using only domestic software products; consumption measuring equipment and gas quality control systems using in-house electronics; serial automobile gas-filling compressor stations in a monoblock mobile version and a number of other products.\n\nGazprom avtomatizatsiya notes the continuation of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its activities in the 1st quarter of 2021, which follows from its quarterly report. During this period, year-on-year, its revenue decreased by 26.8%, to about 2.57 billion rubles, and the net loss increased year-on-year by 23 times, to 636.8 million rubles.\n\nThe largest co-owner of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya got rid of his stake in the company\n\nIn October 2020, businessman Avsholum Yunaev ceased control in Gazprom avtomatizatsiya, follows from the company's message on the information disclosure website. He joined the company, which was previously part of the Gazprom group, in 2014. By the time he left it, Yunaev owned 65.57% of the voting shares through the Investment Company Parity, Production Company Energy Union and Energoactive organizations controlled by him. Now these organizations no longer participate in Gazprom avtomatizatsiya.\n\nAccording to \"Gazprom avtomatizatsiya,\" the shares of these companies passed to three new shareholders. The largest share - 24.99% - was received by Magras LLC. The company was formed in 2004. According to the database of legal entities Kontur.Fokus, \"its only participant is Sergey Zabarchuk, who is also the co-founder of the law firm of the same name.\n\nHowever, the business associated with projects in the gas industry is not new for Sergei Zabarchuk. He has experience as a general director at Stroygazconsulting-Sever, a company from the Stroygazconsulting group of companies. Until 2013, it was one of Gazprom's main construction contractors.\n\nA share of 24.43% of voting shares was received by Gazstroyprom JSC. It was founded in 2018 and is positioned on its website as a multidisciplinary company that performs a full range of work as part of the implementation of infrastructure projects for the production, processing and transportation of natural gas. It also says that its customers are enterprises of the Gazprom group.\n\nThe ownership structure of Gazstroyprom according to the databases of legal entities is not obvious, since this joint-stock company is not public. In the list of Gazprom affiliates in March 2020, this company was still present as belonging to the Gazprom group, but was later excluded from it. Gazstroyprom is no longer present in the list of Gazprom affiliates for September 2020.\n\nAccording to the Interfax agency, Gazstroyprom was created by Gazprom and Gazprombank on the basis of the assets of Stroygazconsulting cleared of debts and court claims[4].\n\nIn June 2020, RBC wrote with reference to sources that Gazstroyprom was conceived as a new single supplier of Gazprom, which would be formed by the consolidation of contractors[5] of[6]According to the newspaper, against this background, several top managers of Gazprom's three large contractors - Stroygazmontazh, Stroytransneftegaz and Gazprom avtomatizatsiya - previously took senior positions at Gazstroyprom. Among them, RBC also named Dmitry Zhuravlev, general director and co-owner of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya: in December 2019, he became the first deputy general director of Gazstroyprom.\n\nA share of 16.15% of voting shares went to Odeon LLC. According to the database of legal entities Kontur.Fokus, \"the only founder of this company, formed in 2019, is Vladimir Ruchkin. Odeon owns 16.09% of ordinary shares in Lengazspetsstroy, follows from the report of the latter for the 2nd quarter of 2020. This company is the main construction asset of the Stroygazmontazh group. One of the largest projects in which Stroygazmontazh acts as a contractor is the construction of the Power of Siberia gas pipeline.\n\nAccording to the database of legal entities Kontur.Fokus, \"as of September 30, 2020, in addition to Avsholum Yunaev's companies, the largest co-owner of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya is also Dmitry Zhuravlev, who owns a share of about 20% in the company through Energy Solutions LLC.\n\nChanges in the ownership structure of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya were preceded by a successful year in terms of financial indicators: its revenue in 2019 excluding the turnover of subsidiaries increased by 36%, to 46.4 billion rubles, net profit - by 451%, to 2.26 billion rubles. At the end of 2019, the company paid record dividends - about 2 billion rubles, according to the Kontur. Focus database.\n\nAt the same time, in 2019, the number of new government contracts concluded by Gazprom avtomatizatsiya significantly decreased compared to 2017 and 2018. So, if in 2018 she entered into about 60 state contracts, then in 2019 their number decreased to 8 contracts. And in the first 10 months of 2020, the company does not have a single new concluded state contract, according to data in the database \"Kontur. Focus.\" By coincidence, in July 2019, Gazprom left Mikhail Sirotkin, one of the main procurement curators, who worked in the group for almost 20 years.\n\nIt follows from the same base that as of 2020, there are a total of 18 organizations potentially related to Gazprom avtomatizatsiya, the total revenue of which at the end of 2019 amounted to about 31 billion rubles. The largest of them in terms of turnover is Servicegazavtomatika: its revenue in 2019 reached about 14 billion rubles.\n\nAccusation of Colonel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Dmitry Zakharchenko of taking bribes from the head of \"Gazprom avtomatizatsiya\" for \"general patronage\"\n\nIn February 2020, it became known that the Investigative Committee of Russia (TFR) accuses the ex-colonel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Dmitry Zakharchenko of two new episodes of receiving bribes \"for general patronage.\" In total, from 2007 to 2016, the former deputy head of the T department of the GUEBiPK received about 850 thousand rubles. from the management of the Gazpr om avtomatizatsiya company. The bribe was handed over to a police officer in the form of payment for rest at the Grand Hotel Polyana and Polyana 1389 Hotel and Spa at ski resorts in Sochi.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, for the remuneration of specific services, an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs did not provide, but only carried out general patronage of bribe-givers.\n\nAccording to the TFR, Mr. Zakharchenko committed the crime at the end of 2015. Then the officer was already the deputy head of the department \"T\" of the GUEBiPK. As the investigators established, out of selfish motives, the accused Zakharchenko agreed to provide \"general patronage\" to Avsholum Yunaev, who in the same 2015 was elected to the board of directors of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya OJSC, and in February 2020 is the chairman of the board of directors of this structure. Mr. Yunaev thanked his patron by paying for the New Year's holiday in 2015-2016 in Sochi's Grand Hotel Polyana and Polyana 1389 Hotel and Spa. A two-week stay in these hotel complexes cost Mr. Zakharchenko almost 850 thousand rubles.\n\nWe also note that Avsholum Yunaev is not on the TFR lists among those accused of giving a bribe. Apparently, he was released from criminal liability in connection with active repentance.\n\nLawyer Yuri Novikov, representing the interests of Dmitry Zakharchenko, told Kommersant that his client does not admit his guilt in the alleged crimes and he does not understand the essence of the accusation.\n\nAnother lawyer Valery Tunikova said that in the episode with Mr. Yunaev, according to her, there is no corpus delicti.\n\n\"Dmitry Viktorovich (Zakharchenko. - 'Kommersant') remembered this story. His neighbor Yunaev offered vouchers, which for some reason could not be used by his relative or acquaintance, and Zakharchenko bought them, \"she noted[7].\n\n2019: Gazprom avtomatizatsiya profit up 451%\n\nGazprom avtomatizatsiya 's revenue (excluding subsidiaries) in 2019 increased by 36% compared to 2018, to 46.4 billion rubles, according to the company's annual report.

In ON Oracle the reporting for 2019, the company notes that it has completed work in full on equipment maintenance and software maintenance in Gazprom's gas production and gas transmission subsidiaries.\n\nAt the same time, in 2019, one of the new such contracts fell through. The annual report says that there was a cancellation of the competitive selection procedure organized by Gazprom for the provision of equipment maintenance and maintenance services for Oracle software for Gazprom Inform, in which Gazprom avtomatizatsiya was recognized as the winner. Due to the cancellation of the competitive selection procedure, an agreement with Gazprom avtomatizatsiya was not concluded.\n\nAccording to the database of legal entities Kontur.Fokus, \"the number of new concluded state contracts in 2019 at\" Gazprom avtomatizatsiya \"has significantly decreased compared to 2017 and 2018. So, if in 2018 it entered into about 60 state contracts, then in 2019 their number decreased to 8 contracts. And in the first half of 2020, the company does not have a single new state contract in the database.\n\nThe largest in 2019, according to Kontur.

At the same time, management expenses also increased by 8.8%, to 998.8 million rubles. Among the factors that influenced the increase in management expenses, the annual report cites: an increase in the amount of depreciation of fixed assets, the amount of travel expenses due to the emergence of new remote facilities, an increase in the cost of renting office premises, etc.\n\nAt the time of publication of the material, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya can not comment on the financial results of its activities at the request of TAdviser.\n\nThe rate of decline in sales volumes decreased from 23% in 2016 to 10% in 2017, despite the negative impact of macroeconomic indicators and a decrease in investment programs of major customers, the company said in a report.\n\nThere, the company notes that according to the results of its work in 2017, it \"as a whole managed to maintain the target fuel and energy complex market.\" The main consumers of the company's products and services in 2017, as before, were Gazprom and its subsidiaries.

This made it possible to expand the range of equipment produced.\n\nActively implementing the import substitution program, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya over the past year has launched the production of 14 units of new products with an average share of domestic components of 95%. The development and organization of production also required certain costs, the company told TAdviser. - Due to these factors, the indicators that are projected to grow next year have slightly decreased.\n\nGazprom avtomatizatsiya added that in 2015 it is possible to generally state a slowdown in the growth rate of the market segment against the background of external negative factors. The portfolios of orders for the industry as a whole decreased due to the suspension of the implementation of a number of projects.\n\nAfter leaving Gazprom, the group's companies continue to be the main customers of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya: services and work for them in 2015 accounted for 97% of its total revenue.\n\nThe company's plans include the development of business in sales markets external to Gazprom. The annual report of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya notes that it is faced with the task of becoming a \"recognized leader\" in the Russian market for the implementation of complex projects in the field of automation, communications, informatization, electricity, metrological support, gas distribution and production of equipment for gas engine fuel for fuel and energy complex companies.\n\nLife after shareholder change\n\nThe transition from the Gazprom group to a new shareholder was the most important event of the past year for Gazprom avtomatizatsiya, according to the company's corporate bulletin published in May 2015.

So, by February 2014, six new deputy CEOs (including acting ones) and the chief accountant appeared in Gazprom avtomatizatsiya.\n\nThe first personnel changes began in August-September 2013 with the appointment of the first deputy general director Maxim Isaev, deputy general director for economics and finance - Dmitry Nikonchuk and deputy general director for commercial issues - Artem Krestyaninov.\n\nKrestyanov, in particular, is the director of Investgazavtomatika, a subsidiary of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya, combining this position with the position of a member of the board of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya. Isaev had previously worked at Gazprom avtomatizatsiya (then still called Gazavtomatika): in 2008-2009. he served as the first deputy general director of this company, and later moved to a similar position at Gazprom inform.\n\nThe previous first deputy general director Anatoly Naumets, who, after the dismissal of Yuri Raushkin, served for some time as the head of the company, as well as Alexei Davydov, who worked at Gazprom avtomatizatsiya as the head of the financial and economic department, and the former deputy general director for commercial issues Anatoly Viktorovich Sementsov were prematurely removed from the board of the board.\n\nThe company did the same with respect to Albina Valeryevna Panova, who worked at Gazprom avtomatizatsiya as chief accountant. Instead, first acting Chief Accountant, and then Chief Accountant Vladimir Taran was appointed.\n\nSubsequently, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya also appointed a new deputy general director for corporate relations Vitaly Pokhodenko, acting deputy general director for corporate protection and personnel Vladimir Myatlev and acting deputy general director for information and management systems Alexander Kalinin, whose candidacy for appointment to the position of deputy is planned to be agreed at the end of February.\n\nThus, by February 2014, only the deputy general directors for administrative activities, for the implementation of complex projects, for science and informatization, as well as the chief engineer remained from the old team of top managers at Gazprom avtomatizatsiya.\n\nMass change of chapters in \"daughters\"\n\nAs it became known to TAdviser, from the moment of the appointment of a new general director in June 2013 to October, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya changed the heads of six of its twenty subsidiaries: Servicegazavtomatiki, Gazpriborautomatiki, Saratovgazavtomatiki and Kaliningazpriborautomatiki and Investazavtomatiki.\n\n\"Servicegazavtomatika,\" in particular, was headed by Vyacheslav Rumyantsev, who has been working in the oil and gas industry since 2002. Immediately before his appointment, he worked as the general director of KOTEK, which provides recruitment services and other services to companies in the fuel and energy complex.\n\nRoman Taganov became the new director of Gazpriborautomatika. He has been working in the structure of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya since 1999, where he went from design engineer of the Kaliningradgazavtomatika plant to director of the Kaliningradgazpriborautomatika company.\n\nGazavtomatika is now led by Grigory Zybin, who has been working in the oil and gas industry since 1992. Before his appointment, he served as head of the Bureau of Engineering GUIs of the Gazavtomatiki engineering association.\n\nSaratovgazavtomatika was headed by Gennady Filippov, who had previously held the position of chief designer and first deputy general director of the BINAR Association, formed by employees of the RFNC-VNIIEF nuclear center and specializing in the development, production and implementation of software and technical means of complex ACS industrial facilities.\n\nSergey Salnikov was appointed the new director of Kaliningradgazpriborautomatika, who had worked for this company for 13 years by the time of his appointment, holding positions from laboratory programmer to software chief engineer.\n\nInvestgazavtomatika, which was one of the first to change its leadership with the arrival of the new general director of the parent company, is now headed by Artem Krestyaninov, who combines this position with the leadership of the commercial block Gazprom avtomatizatsiya as deputy general director for commercial issues.\n\n2012\n\nRevenue reduction by 30% to 38 billion rubles\n\nThe revenue of the management company Gazprom avtomatizatsiya (excluding subsidiaries) in 2012 decreased by about 30% - from 55.58 billion rubles. up to 38.88 billion rubles, and net profit decreased by 1.44% from 489.30 million rubles. up to 482.26 million rubles. In 2011, these indicators, on the contrary, showed growth: revenue increased by 197% - from 28.18 billion rubles. compared to 2010, and net profit - by more than 150% compared to 2010.\n\nThe annual report of the company, issued in June 2013, states that the fall in revenue in 2012 was due to a decrease in the supply of oil and gas equipment, and in 2011, a sharp increase in volumes was associated with the completion of the most important construction projects: the North European gas pipeline and the Bovanenkovsky oil and gas condensate field.\n\n\"In 2012, there were no such significant facilities and, accordingly, the limits on the capital construction plan of Gazprom were significantly lower than the level of the previous year,\" the Gazprom Automation report says. - For other types of activities, volumes remained either at the same level or increased. \"\n\nAmong the work in the field of informatization carried out by the Gazprom avtomatizatsiya management company in 2012, the report mentions the completion of the project to create an information and management system for Gazprom's material and technical resources , the modernization of Gazprom Inform's computing infrastructure and the completion of the creation of an automated information and computing resource management system for this company, the design of a regional data transmission network for 20 Gazprom subsidiaries, the beginning of the design of the 2nd stage of the Moscow data center, etc.\n\nIn the direction of the general integration system, Gazprom avtomatizatsiya conducted an examination of 366 pre-design and design documents, of which 299 were for automation projects. In addition, the company took part in 16 tests of third-party automation systems, including factory, acceptance and interdepartmental trials.\n\nThe total net profit of twenty Gazprom avtomatizatsiya subsidiaries in 2012 amounted to RUB 823.868 million (excluding subsidiaries), a decrease of 5.6% compared to 2011.\n\nThe Kaliningradgazavtomatika plant, Investgazavtomatika and the Saratovgazavtomatika plant turned out to be profitable, the net profit of which in 2012 amounted to 242.706 million rubles, 201.857 million rubles. and 137.758 million rubles. respectively.\n\nThree subsidiaries of Gazprom avtomatizatsiya ended the year with a net loss: the installation and commissioning company Astrakhangazavtomatika - 22.217 million rubles, Volgogazavtomatika - 6.32 million rubles. and Volgogradgazavtomatika - 730 thousand rubles.\n\nSubsidiaries.

Judging by the text of the letter signed by the acting Head of the Department for the Investigation of Organized Criminal Activities in the Field of Economics Victor Tsymbal, the investigation did not subside at all, but works fruitfully, but without any press releases, detentions and the like. The letter states that the investigation established the fact of theft only through one intermediary company for 2009 from Gazprom OJSC more than 300 million rubles. The entire supply chain through intermediary firms was opened, their CEOs were questioned, who testified that their actions were managed by Gazavtomatika OJSC. Moreover, the investigation, judging by the text of the letter, already has the first candidates for suspects from among the managers of subsidiaries of Gazavtomatika OJSC.\n\nHowever, a NG source also said that the whole story is not taken very seriously inside Gazprom: there is an opinion that such an asset as Gazprom is unlikely to seriously shake the special services - the role of the gas giant in the life of the country is too great.\n\n2010\n\nSearches of the Investigative Committee\n\nOn January 21, 2010, the Investigative Department of the FSB of Russia opened a criminal case on the fact of extortion of Part 3 of Art. 30 (paragraphs \"a\" and \"b\") and part 4. Art. 204 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation in relation to the first deputy general director of Servicegazavtomatika Yuri Tkachenko. The latter, in fact, extorted a multimillion-dollar illegal cash reward from one of the company's subcontractors. Tkachenko, it seems, acted with a group of persons by prior conspiracy.\n\nOn January 26, 2010, the powers of Alexander Kochetov, director of Firm Servicegazavtomatika LLC, were terminated ahead of schedule.\n\nIn February 2010, a press release was issued by the Investigative Committee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, revealing the theft at Gazprom of more than 60 million rubles. during the supply of products by Gazavtomatika OJSC. As part of the investigation, searches were carried out at Gazavtomatika OJSC, its subsidiaries Investgazavtomatika LLC and Servicegazavtomatika Firm LLC, as well as a number of other structures. By this time, Shamkin had already been fired from Investgazavtomatika. As it turns out, his powers were terminated ahead of schedule on December 24, 2009. According to the investigation, unreasonably involved intermediaries involved in the acquisition of power equipment for the needs of Gazprom by subsidiaries of Gazavtomatika were identified in the procurement chain. The Investigative Committee argued that the cost of the equipment was deliberately overestimated. That is, it was about banal fraud. A criminal case was initiated on the fact that a group of persons committed theft of funds by fraud on an especially large scale (part 4 of article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).\n\nAt the same time, as Irina Dudukina, a representative of the Investigative Committee under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, told the Vzglyad newspaper, \"all these companies sold equipment to each other, as a result, the cost of goods paid by Gazprom increased many times. A chain of eight to nine intermediaries worked. \" What is curious, at the time of this statement, according to Dudukina, \"the persons involved in the case have not yet been determined.\" But, the interlocutor of the newspaper promised, \"the suspects will appear.\"\n\nGazavtomatika, Investgazavtomatika and Servicegazavtomatika (see above 2007) were involved, according to the investigation, in fraud.\n\nOn March 12, 2010, the board of directors of Gazavtomatika OJSC again elected Raushkin as general director for three years.\n\nAt this time, Gazavtomatika OJSC is a member of Gazprom Tsentrremont LLC holding company with influential patron managers originally from St. Petersburg, including the right hand of the general director - Sergey Palkin. After that, the incident with the investigation of the Investigative Committee came to naught.\n\n50th Anniversary Celebrations, Leadership Awards\n\nAt the end of 2010, the 50th anniversary of Gazavtomatika OJSC is celebrated with fanfare - Alexey Miller, Chairman of the Board of Gazprom OJSC, personally congratulates the management of Gazavtomatika OJSC, especially noting that \"the staff of OJSC Gazavtomatika is coping with all the tasks...\" At the same time, Deputy Director of Gazprom Tsentrremont LLC Sergey Palkin was awarded a special award by Gazprom for his outstanding contribution to the development of the gas industry.\n\n2007: Yuri Rauskin appointed CEO\n\nIn 2007, the general director of the small company Gazpromavtomatika from Orenburg, Yuri Rauskin, was appointed to the post of general director of Gazavtomatika OJSC.\n\nIn 2007, Raushkin signed an order to create a subsidiary of Gazavtomatika OJSC under the name Gazavtomatika Trading House (later renamed Investgazavtomatika LLC[8]. Judging by the official version of the company's website, the trading house was created to be a representative of Gazavtomatika OJSC for the sale of products produced by Gazavtomatika subsidiaries. The position of director in the newly created trading house is received by Gennady Shamkin, who came to this post from the post of general director of Krechet LLC. \"Krechet\" is a hunting and sports complex in the Smolensk outback, which has everything you need to relax VIP guests.\n\nSoon the management is changing in the \"Company\" Servicegazavtomatika \"(another\" daughter \"of OJSC\" Gazavtomatika \"), which is engaged in the repair and maintenance of automation systems. Alexander Kochetov becomes the director of the company.\n\nIn 2008, Gazavtomatika Trading House signed an agreement with Krechet LLC on \"organizing training for customer persons (that is, Gazavtomatika) on the territory of the contractor (hunting farm).\" The editorial office of Novaya Gazeta has two documents confirming the payment of 3.4 million rubles to Krechet for the services rendered. And 5 million rubles[8].\n\nSince 2008, OJSC Gazavtomatika has been the general system integrator in the field of automated control systems of OJSC Gazprom.\n\nSince 2009, OJSC Gazavtomatika has been acting as the Competence Center for the creation of IT systems of OJSC Gazprom.\n\n1993: Conversion to \"Gazautomatika\"\n\nSince 1990, VNPO Soyuzgazavtomatika has undergone a number of reorganizations and in 1993 was transformed into OAO Gazavtomatika. OJSC \"Gazavtomatika\" operates on the basis of the Charter approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders, registered in the Moscow Registration Chamber on August 5, 1993 (certificate of the MCI series No. 007.322) and entered in the State Register of Enterprises (certificate No. 3380.21 of June 20, 1994, OKPO 00159093).\n\n1972: Creation of Soyuzgazavtomatika\n\nIn 1972, on the basis of the All-Union Scientific Research and Design Institute for Automated Control Systems in the Gas Industry (VNPIASUgazprom) and SKB Gazpriboravtomatika, the All-Union Scientific and Production Association for Automation of Management of Gas Industry Enterprises Soyuzgazavtomatika was formed. The association consolidated in a single organizational structure the entire process of creating new automation tools and systems and automated control from research and development to commissioning.\n\nBy 1980, six research institutes and design bureaus, a computing center, seven assembly and adjustment trusts and departments, and three experimental plants functioned in the structure of VNPO Soyuzgazavtomatika.\n\n1960s: Becoming\n\nThe history of OJSC \"Gazprom avtomatizatsiya\" begins in 1960 with the formation of the Special Design Bureau for Instrumentation and Automation and Telemechanization of Trunk Pipelines - SKB \"Gazpriborautomatika,\" which can be called the founder of technical progress in terms of automation of the gas industry, since it was actually the first specialized organization that together solved the problems of creating and developing industrial production, as well as the introduction of automation and telemechanics tools and systems.\n\nBy the mid-60s. SKB'Gazpriborautomatika', having passed the shortest period of formation and development, turned into an active engineering and design organization with a solid scientific, technical, production and installation base. An experimental plant was built in Kaliningrad, a production experimental base was created in Moscow, an organized installation and commissioning department. Subsequently, branches of SKB \"Gazpriborautomatika\" are created at the Kaliningrad Experimental Plant, in Kharkov, and then in Saratov. The structure of the organization includes the Saratov Experimental Plant.\n\nAreas of activity\n\nAutomation and dispatching.
