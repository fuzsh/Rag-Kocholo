        "text": "The Nord Stream 2 project, being pursued by Gazprom, has taken today another important step towards its implementation, responding to the need of the European Union for additional gas imports and thereby improving security of supplies to Europe.\n\nNord Stream 2 AG signed financing agreements for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project with ENGIE, OMV, Shell, Uniper and Wintershall.\n\nThese five European energy companies have committed to provide long-term financing for 50 % of the total cost of the project, which is currently estimated to be €9.5 billion. Each European company will fund up to €950 million. Gazprom is and will remain the sole shareholder of the project company, Nord Stream 2 AG.\n\nThe financial commitment by the European companies underscores the Nord Stream 2 project’s strategic importance for the European gas market, contributing to competitiveness as well as medium and long-term energy security especially against the background of expected declining European production.\n\nThe 1,220-kilometer Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters a year, will provide a direct link between reliable Russian gas reserves and European gas consumers from the coast of Russia via the Baltic Sea to Greifswald, Germany. Construction work will begin in 2018 and will be completed by the end of 2019.\n\nProject company\n\nAbout Nord Stream 2\n\nNord Stream 2 is a planned pipeline through the Baltic Sea, which will transport natural gas over 1,200 km from the world’s largest gas reserves in Russia via the most efficient route to consumers in Europe. Nord Stream 2 will largely follow the route and design of the successful Nord Stream pipeline. With Europe’s domestic gas production projected to halve in the next 20 years, Nord Stream 2’s twin pipeline system will help Europe to meet its future gas import needs, with the capacity to transport 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year, enough to supply 26 million European households. This secure supply of natural gas with its low CO2 emissions will also contribute to Europe’s objective to have a more climate-friendly energy mix with gas substituting for coal in power generation and providing back-up for intermittent renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar power.\n\nwww.nord-stream2.com\n\nMedia Contact: Jens D. Müller – Spokesperson - Media Relations Manager - +41 41 418 3636 - press@nord-stream2.com.\n\nProject shareholder\n\nAbout Gazprom\n\nGazprom is a global energy company focused on geological exploration, production, transportation, storage, processing and sales of gas, gas condensate and oil, sales of gas as a vehicle fuel, as well as generation and marketing of heat and electric power.\n\nGazprom views its mission as ensuring a reliable, efficient and balanced supply of natural gas, other energy resources and their derivatives to consumers.\n\nGazprom holds the world’s largest natural gas reserves.
