        "text": "UK, EU and US Sanctions on Russia and Belarus update as of 24 July 2024\n\nWith the rapid expansion of UK, EU and US sanctions on Russia and Belarus in recent weeks - and with more in the regulatory pipeline - we set out:\n\nWhat's New (to 24 July)\n\nA 5-step checklist for assessing how your activities may be affected\n\nA Sanctions Summary\n\n1. WHAT'S NEW\n\nUK\n\nOn 19 July 2024, OFSI added seven new FAQs to its UK Financial Sanctions FAQs. The FAQs relate to:\n\nTrust Services Sanctions (see new FAQs 92 – 97 in the \"Russia\" section). These cover topics including (i) what activity is prohibited by the trust services sanctions; (ii) the trust services General Licence; (iii) who the trust services sanctions apply to; and (iv) the impact on the trust services sanctions when an asset freeze is in place.\n\nThe National Settlement Depository General Licence (General Licence INT/2024/4919848 - see further below and new FAQ 98 in the \"General Licensing\" section). This confirms that conversions of depositary receipts to local line qualify as a sale, transfer or divestment under the new General Licence.\n\nOn 18 July 2024, the UK published a call to action regarding President Putin's \"shadow fleet\" of oil tankers, transporting Russian oil in circumvention of Russian sanctions. The call to action has been endorsed by the nations of the European Political Community and the EU, reaffirming the joint aim to \"address the risks that the ‘shadow fleet’ poses to the environment, maritime safety and security in Europe and beyond, the integrity of international seaborne trade, and respect for international maritime law.\" On the same day, the UK also sanctioned 11 oil tankers said to form part of Putin's \"shadow fleet\". The sanctioned ships include Rocky Runner, Dynamik Trader and Fighter Two.\n\nOn 10 July 2024, the UK High Court gave judgment in Hellard v OJSC Rossiysky Kredit Bank & Ors. The judgment discusses the test for \"control\" in light of the Mints and Litasco judgments. It breaks down control into 4 types:\n\nDe jure control: this exists where there is an absolute legal right to exercise control;\n\nActual present de facto control: this exists where the putative controller is manifestly \"calling the shots\" (to adopt the language used in Mints) with no legal right to do so;\n\nPotential future de jure control: this would exist where, although the designated person enjoyed no current legal right of ownership or control, the designated person had the legal means to obtain ownership or control; and\n\nPotential future de facto control: this would exist where although there was no evidence that the putative controller was currently exercising de facto control, there is some good reason to believe that the putative controller could, if they wished, exercise control in some manner.\n\nThe judgment seems to strengthen the argument that President Putin does exercise at least existing de facto control over large state-owned companies such as Gazprom, but this remains shrouded in ambiguity.\n\nOn 4 July 2024, it was reported that the UK National Crime Agency has applied to Westminster Magistrates' Court for a forfeiture order of £1.1 million from Peter Aven, a Russian oligarch alleged to have been involved in supporting the Russian Government. The application was made on the basis that the funds, which have been frozen since 2022, are derived from criminality, namely shifting money to evade sanctions. The application marks a departure from UK authorities' usual approach of temporarily freezing assets and could set a precedent for future cases.\n\nOFSI has issued various General Licences, including:\n\nGeneral Licence INT/2024/4919848, which allows for the sale, divestment or transfer of financial instruments held at the National Settlement Depository and the payment of safe keeping fees.\n\nGeneral Licence INT/2024/4881897 (Payments to UK Revenue Authorities). The General Licence allows permitted payments to be made to Revenue Authorities by, or on behalf of, a designated person. Permitted payments are defined as being all payments owed by or due from a UK designated person to the Revenue Authorities, either at the point of, or after, their designation, including tax, duty, national insurance contributions, penalties or interest. The General Licence also includes reporting and record-keeping requirements.\n\nGeneral Licence INT/2024/4888228 (Payments for Statutory Audits). The General Licence allows permitted payments to be made to Statutory Auditors by, or on behalf of, a designated person. Permitted payments are defined as being any remuneration receivable by Statutory Auditors for the Statutory Audit of accounts. There is also various reporting and record-keeping requirements.\n\nEU\n\nOn 17 July 2024, the newly elected European Parliament passed a resolution to restate the continued support of MEPs for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. The resolution also restates the conviction that Russia must compensate financially for the destruction it has caused, indicating that the Parliament want a \"sound legal regime for the confiscation of Russian state-owned assets frozen by the EU\". The Resolution was adopted by 495 votes in favour, 137 against and 47 abstentions.\n\nThe EU has updated various chapters of its Consolidated Sanctions FAQs:\n\nOn 2 July 2024, various FAQs were updated (relating to Provision of Services, Divestment from Russia, State-owned Enterprises, General Questions and Targeted Vessels). Of note, the FAQs on State-owned Enterprises provide guidance on when an entity is subject to both a transaction ban (under Article 5aa of Regulation 833/2014) and an asset freeze (under Regulation 833/2014).\n\nOn 12 July 2024, the Oblasts FAQ was updated to reflect that as at 12 July 2024, the city of Zaporizhzhia and the city of Kherson are under Ukrainian control.\n\nOn 15 July 2024, the \"No Re-Export to Russia\" Clause FAQ was updated to include a new question regarding whether the no re-export to Russia clause requirement is necessary for public contracts. The FAQs explain the exemption for public contracts concluded with a public authority in a third country or with an international organisation, which was introduced in the EU's 14th sanctions package.\n\nOn 29 June 2024, the EU extended sanctions measures against Belarus, which approximate those already in place against Russia. The measures are intended to mitigate the circumvention of Russian sanctions stemming from the high degree of integration between the Russian and Belarusian economies. These include measures that:\n\nRequire EU exporters to include a \"no-Belarus\" clause in contracts, to prohibit the re-export to Belarus of sensitive goods and technologies;\n\nRequire certain EU suppliers of common high priority items (and their non-EU subsidiaries) to implement due diligence mechanisms to assess risk of diversion to Belarus;\n\nExtend the export ban on dual-use / advanced goods and technologies;\n\nProhibit the import of gold and diamonds from Belarus, as well as helium, coal and mineral products, including crude oil;\n\nProhibit the provision of certain services to the Belarus government and its representatives, including certain accounting and auditing services; architectural and engineering services; and advertising and market research services;\n\nProhibit the transit of sensitive goods and technologies via Belarus;\n\nRequire EU parent companies to undertake best efforts to ensure that their non-EU subsidiaries do not undermine EU sanctions; and\n\nProvide for EU operators to claim compensation from damage caused by Belarusian individuals and companies due to sanctions implementation and expropriation.\n\nOn 28 June 2024, the EU announced measures designating two individuals and four companies for circumventing Russia sanctions and materially supporting the Russian Government. Those that were designated include:\n\nDimitry Beloglazov and companies LLC Titul, JSC Iliadis and Rasperia for the creation of a complex circumvention scheme which allowed Oleg Deripska (already subject to EU restrictive measures) to sell frozen assets for an economic benefit.\n\nPJSC TransContainer, Russia's largest railway container operator, and its General Director, Mikhail Kontserev. The Council allege that PJSC TransContainer's revenues increased throughout 2023 due to the flow of Belarusian cargoes and the company's participation in an illegal weapon trade scheme with North Korea, in support of the Russian Government.\n\nOn 28 June 2024, German customs investigators arrested four individuals accused of exporting over 170 luxury cars to Russia, in contravention of Russian sanctions. The arrests were made after raids and searches on 24 residential and business premises. Five cars were seized in addition to 300,000 euros in cash. The authorities also obtained a substantial freezing order over approximately 13.3 million euros, said to be the proceeds from the car sales.\n\nUS\n\nOn 10 July 2024, OFAC issued General License No. 13J, which authorises US persons or entities owned or controlled by US persons to, amongst other things, pay taxes, purchase permits and pay import duties in respect of transactions prohibited by Directive 4 under Executive Order 14024 (Prohibitions Related to Transactions Involving the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation). This is provided that the transactions are incidental and necessary to the ordinary day-to-day operations in Russia of the US persons or entities.\n\nOn 9 July 2024, the US Department of Justice announced that Nikolay Goltsev and Salimdzhon Nasriddinov pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit export control violations for their roles in a global procurement scheme on behalf of sanctioned Russian companies, including Russian military companies. Goltsev and Nasriddinov are scheduled to be sentenced on 10 December and 11 December respectively. They each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.\n\nOn 8 July 2024, OFAC removed Alexey Panferov from its Russia sanctions list. No reasons were given for the de-listing. Panferov had been listed since March 2022 for alleged links to PJSC Sovcombank.\n\nOn 2 July 2024, former vice president of KanRus Trading Company Inc., Douglas Robertson, pleaded guilty for his role in a years-long conspiracy to circumvent US export laws by filing false export forms with the US Government and selling and exporting sophisticated and controlled avionics equipment to customers in Russia without the required licenses. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for 3 October 2024.\n\n2. YOUR 5-STEP CHECKLIST\n\nWhich countries’ sanctions apply to your activities?\n\nThe UK, EU, US and other countries’ sanctions typically must be observed if there is a sufficient nexus to confer jurisdiction, that is if:\n\ntheir nationals (individuals) are involved, wherever they are in the world (in the case of US sanctions, this includes US permanent residents/Green Card holders);\n\nany part of a transaction is conducted within their territory or airspace; and\n\nlegal entities incorporated or constituted under their law, including foreign branches are involved; or\n\nwith respect to US sanctions, if a transaction is conducted in US dollars or clears through the US financial system, or data is routed through servers in the US, or other back office support or facilitation is provided by US persons (including service requests to an equipment supplier). Non-US persons may be penalised if they cause US persons to violate US sanctions, for example omitting reference to the involvement of a sanctioned party or jurisdiction to a financial transaction involving a US person.\n\nUK sanctions may also apply to non-UK persons outside the UK if there is a sufficient nexus. This will depend on the facts of each case but could include:\n\ntransactions using clearing services in the UK;\n\nactions by a local subsidiary of a UK company;\n\nactions directed from within the UK; and/or\n\nfinancial products or insurance bought on UK markets but held or used overseas.\n\nAdditionally, US ‘secondary sanctions’ may be applied to non-US persons outside the US in the absence of any US nexus if a transaction involves sanctionable conduct that would be prohibited to a US person and that is determined by the US authorities to be a ‘significant’ transaction or otherwise provides material support to a sanctioned party. Whether a transaction is ‘significant’ is based on a number of open-ended criteria e.g. the size, number and frequency of transactions.\n\nFurther, US export control restrictions may apply even if sanctions do not. For example, US export controls will apply if US-origin goods, software or technology located in a third country are re-exported, regardless of whether a U.S. person is involved in the transaction.\n\nAre any of your business partners subject to an asset freeze?\n\nThe UK, EU, US and others have imposed asset freezes (‘blocking sanctions’ in US terms) on most Russian banks and strategic industries (e.g. defence, transport, research, media and aerospace), and senior individuals in the Russian government, state-owned corporations and major businesses, including family members, and they are continuing to add new names to their national lists of such ‘designated persons’.\n\nAn asset freeze generally requires those within the scope of the national sanctions, as described at step 1 (above), to:\n\nfreeze any assets of the designated parties that they may hold and to report these to their authorities;\n\nnot make any funds or economic resources available to them, directly, indirectly or for their benefit;\n\nIn addition, US restrictions go further and in effect also prohibit all transactions with the designated (i.e. listed) party.\n\nThe same restrictions also apply to any non-designated entity that is:\n\n‘owned’ by a designated party or parties. The US threshold is 50% or more, while the UK and EU thresholds are ‘more than 50%’. The US and the EU (in guidance) consider the criterion met if the aggregated ownership of two or more designated parties exceeds the threshold. The UK (also in guidance) recognises aggregated ownership only if there is evidence of a joint arrangement between two or more designated parties; or\n\n(in the UK/EU, not the US) ‘controlled’ by a designated entity (i.e. able to ensure the affairs of the undesignated entity are conducted in accordance with their wishes, for example through controlling a majority of voting shares or having the right to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors).\n\nIt is often challenging to reach a definitive view of whether this ‘control’ criterion is applicable, for example if a majority shareholder becomes sanctioned and passes some of their shares to unsanctioned family members or to business associates. If you would like assistance on these issues, do get in touch.\n\nIf you do business with Russia or Belarus, you should screen your business partners - banks, suppliers, customers, distributors – against the applicable national sanctions lists and, given the current rapid pace of developments, set up alerts for new designations, in order to be able to identify any relevant new sanctions measures without delay. In some instances, the measures include exceptions or general licences that provide for a wind-down period, but others may have immediate effect. Note that asset freezes on Russian banks may prevent you from receiving or making payments to business partners or to employees.\n\nIt should also be noted that, while there are many similarities between the respective national lists, there are also significant differences. For example, a Russian company might be subject to EU sanctions but not to UK or US sanctions. In such cases, it may be possible for UK persons to do business with the Russian company provided that there is no EU nexus (as described in step 1 above), including that any EU nationals are recused.\n\nAre any of your activities affected by other financial sanctions?\n\nShort of an asset freeze, sanctions measures may restrict or prohibit:\n\ngranting new loans or credit (including payment terms);\n\nsanctioned banks from clearing payments in certain currencies;\n\ndealing in transferable securities and money market instruments issued by sanctioned parties;\n\nthe size of bank deposits by nationals of sanctioned countries;\n\nthe access of sanctioned banks to the SWIFT messaging systems; transactions with the Russian Central Bank and certain State-owned enterprises;\n\nnew investment or acquisitions and the provision of investment services.\n\nThe screening of your business partners, including banks, should check for the application of any of these restrictions. However, note that there may be exceptions, grounds for licensing and/or wind-down periods.\n\nAre your products or services restricted?\n\nTrade sanctions may restrict or prohibit:\n\nthe sale, supply, transfer or export to Russia/Belarus, directly or indirectly, of certain goods and technology beyond those that are normally subject to export controls. This generally includes related financial services, brokering and technical assistance (e.g. repair, maintenance). The restrictions may be focused on only certain designated entities. There may be exceptions, grounds for licensing and/or wind-down periods;\n\nthe import, purchase, transport or insurance of certain goods or technology from, or originating in, Russia/Belarus – notably including oil - with similar related provisions as those for exports;\n\naccounting, tax consulting, business and management consulting, public relations, architectural, engineering, IT consultancy, legal advisory and trusts services;\n\nclosure or airspace and ports to aircraft and ships;\n\nmore wide-ranging embargoes on most finance and trade with certain regions (previously Crimea, now extended to the occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk).\n\nDo you have the right measures in place to mitigate your risks?\n\nGiven the evolving and expanding scope of sanctions, have you audited your compliance programmes and contractual commitments to make sure you are mitigating any risks? For example, have you:\n\nUpdated your compliance policies and procedures, ensuring they are proportionate and workable?\n\nReviewed your technology infrastructure to support your day-to-day compliance (e.g. with on-boarding clients and service providers or providing IP/geolocation support for your KYC process)?\n\nTailored and updated your training for your compliance leads and others across your business?\n\nReviewed whether your contracts enable you (or the counterparty) to suspend or terminate it without liability or serious risk of challenge, whether through a specific sanctions provision or other clauses such as the material adverse change clause?\n\n3. YOUR SANCTIONS SUMMARY\n\nWe set out below a high-level overview of the current UK, EU and US sanctions in addition to asset freezes (as set out above).\n\nPlease note that exceptions, grounds for licensing and wind-down periods often apply to specific sanctions; if you would like an analysis as to the legality of a particular transaction, trade or matter, do get in touch.\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\n\nFinancial services:\n\nA ban on dealing with transferable securities and money market instruments or issuing new loans or credit with a maturity exceeding 30 days to:\n\nwhere issued since 2014, an entity listed in Schedule 2 (including Sberbank, VTB Bank, Gazprombank, VEB, Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft) or their non-UK subsidiaries;\n\nwhere issued since 1 March 2022, UK subsidiaries of Schedule 2 entities; a “person connected with Russia” (an individual located in or ordinarily resident in Russia, or an entity domiciled, incorporated or constituted under the law of Russia); an entity owned by or acting on behalf/at the direction of such as person; or the Government of Russia;\n\nwhere issued on or after 16 December 2022, by a person not connected with Russia where the purpose of the loan or credit is to make a new investment in Russia;\n\nA ban on UK credit or financial institutions establishing or continuing a correspondent banking relationship with, or processing payments to from or via, a designated person;\n\nA ban on financial services for foreign exchange reserve and asset management to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the Russian National Wealth Fund and the Ministry of Finance, and persons owned or controlled directly or indirectly by them or acting on their behalf or direction;\n\nA ban on new investment, specifically the:\n\ndirect acquisition of any ownership interest in Russian land and entities connected with Russia;\n\nindirect acquisition of any ownership interest in Russian land and entities connected with Russia for the purpose of making funds or economic resources available to, or for the benefit of, persons connected with Russia;\n\ndirect or indirect acquisition of any ownership interest in entities with a place of business in Russia (which are not persons connected with Russia) for the purpose of making funds or economic resources available (directly or indirectly) to, or for the benefit of, persons connected with Russia;\n\nestablishment of joint ventures with a person connected with Russia;\n\nopening of representative offices and establishing branches and subsidiaries in Russia; and\n\nprovision of investment services directly related to the above; and\n\nSelected Russian banks removed from the SWIFT messaging system.\n\nTrade:\n\nExports\n\nA ban on the export, supply and delivery, and making available of the following goods and technology, and related services, to Russia:\n\nmilitary and internal repression items;\n\nadvanced technology items: dual-use, ‘critical industry’, special materials, quantum computing, aviation, maritime and space;\n\na wide range of items mainly for the manufacturing sector and luxury items;\n\ninfrastructure-related, energy-related and oil refining items, and jet fuel;\n\nsterling or EU denominated banknotes; and\n\nthe supply and delivery of certain revenue generating goods from Russia to third countries, except those with important humanitarian or civilian use such as certain agricultural and energy-related goods.\n\nImports\n\nA ban on the import or acquisition of the following goods and technology consigned from or originating in Russia, as well as related services:\n\noil and oil products, LNG, and coal and coal products;\n\niron and steel items, including of Russian iron and steel goods that have been processed in third countries;\n\na range of materials and manufactured items generating revenue for Russia;\n\ngold and gold jewellery;\n\ndiamonds, including certain diamonds processed in third countries, and diamond jewellery;\n\na 35% tariff on imports of certain goods originating in Russia and Belarus; and\n\ncertain Russian metals, and articles thereof, including copper, nickel, aluminium, lead, zinc, tin, tungsten and other base metals.\n\nServices\n\nA ban on the provision of the following services:\n\nmaritime transport, insurance and other financial services for ships carrying Russian crude oil/refined oil products to or between third countries, unless the crude oil/refined oil products has been sold below a specific price cap;\n\ntrust services, accounting, business and management consulting, public relations, advertising, architectural, auditing, engineering and IT consultancy and design services to persons connected with Russia;\n\nlegal advisory services to any person who is not a UK person in relation to any activity which would, if carried out by a UK person or in the UK, contravene UK sanctions on Russia, except legal representation, compliance with UK statutory obligations and whether an act complies with UK sanctions.
