        "text": "Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on February 4 signed the order allowing Gazprom Neft to establish a private military company.\n\nThe existence of private military groups has gained attention both in and outside Russia following the Wagner Group’s brutal violence in Africa and Ukraine. The Wagner Group’s paramilitary unit of mercenaries is financed and owned by oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, a criminal who served nine years in jail for robbery before establishing close ties with Vladimir Putin.\n\nThere are several other ragtag groups that operate as small private armies, but with close ties with the Defence Ministry and Russian military intelligence service (GRU).\n\nOne such is the Patriot, affiliated with Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu.\n\nGazprom Neft will be the first in the Arctic formally allowed to have its own private military company (PMC).\n\nIn the order, Prime Minister Mishustin points to the law on Fuel and Energy Complex facilities and grants “the right to establish a private security organization” - the same designation as used for the Wagner Group.\n\nGazprom Neft is the oil-producing subsidiary of Gazprom. The company holds many licenses in Siberia, including fields in the Yamalo-Nenets and Khanty-Mansi autonomous areas. In the European Arctic, Gazprom Neft is the owner of Prirazlomnoye, Russia’s only offshore oil production in the eastern Barents Sea.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Ob Bay, the company operates the “Arctic Gate” terminal with oil from the Novy Port field.\n\nIn the Kola Bay, north of Murmansk, Gazprom Neft conducts ship-to-ship reloading with the supertanker “Umba” which receives oil from the company’s Arctic fields.\n\nGazprom Neft itself has not commented on which tasks its new private military company will get."
