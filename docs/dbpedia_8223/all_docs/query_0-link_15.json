A Russian company, part of the Gazprom group, has now placed subsidiaries of Italian and German companies under 'temporary external management'.\n\nThese measures, targeting legitimate economic activities, are yet another proof of Russiaâ€™s disregard for international law and rules.\n\nRussia confirms to be an unpredictable actor also in the economic field, and has created a business climate which is arbitrary and hostile towards foreign investors.\n\nThe European Union calls on Russia to reverse these measures and seek acceptable solutions with European companies targeted by them."
