Gazprom International Ltd. ILLC began a competitive process to sell its North Sea assets. The company has placed a call for bids on Gazprombank's e-trading platform.

The company plans to sell its share of Wintershall Noordzee BV (WINZ), a 50-50 joint venture with its European partner Wintershall Dea, and 100% shares of Gazprom International UK Ltd., a subsidiary which holds 24% interest in the Sillimanite gas field development (OGJ Online, Dec. 21, 2023).

The transaction also includes the sale of 100% of the shares of Gazprom UK Ltd., a company that holds Gazprom UK Resources SA which has 20% interest in the Noordzee-operated Wingate gas field development. WINZ also holds interests in a consortium participating in Sillimanite and Wingate gas field developments. Sillimanite and Wingate produced an average of 3,800 boe/d in 2023.

Gazpromâ€™s main producing projects are K18-Golf, Wingate, Q1-B, Q1-D, and Sillimanite, which account for about 90% of the company's extracted products. Extracted natural gas is delivered to the EU market on spot contracts.
