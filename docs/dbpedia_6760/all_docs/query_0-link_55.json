        "text": "Jan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa is a public university, with its history that traces back to 1971. At present, the University comprises 4 faculties with more than 40 fields of study, with bachelor's, master and doctoral degrees. It offers postgraduate studies & courses and opens new fields of study accommodating the needs raised by employers and sought-after skills most requested on the marketplace. The University community is created by 648 academic staff who provide education to students from different corners of the country and the world.\n\nThe Alma Mater…\n\nJDU is the former Higher Teacher Education School, which was transformed into a university. The event, so important for the entire academic community of Częstochowa, was celebrated on 1 October 2004.\n\nThe history of our Alma Mater reaches back to the year 1971. Following the decision of the Council of Ministers of the time, a Teacher Training College was established. In 1974 it was transformed into a Higher Teacher Education School. The employees of the University who remember that historical event for Częstochowa and the region stress that establishing a graduate school of humanities was of great importance for the fast-developing city. Many people acknowledge that it was an unprecedented decision, as those days the authorities showed much more favorable attitudes towards technical universities. Graduates in engineering science were in demand by dynamically developing industrial plants of the region. First diplomas for the completion of vocational education and training studies were awarded in 1973. The first Master of Arts and Master of Science diplomas were granted by the School authorities in 1977.\n\nThe beginnings of our Alma Mater were quite modest. The College and the early HTES had only 2 faculties: the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences and the Faculty of Pedagogy.\n\nFor the last 50 years, Jan Dlugosz University has been developing rapidly and growing in strength. Now the University comprises 4 faculties: the Faculty of Philology and History, the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, the Faculty of Pedagogy, the Faculty of Art, and two inter-faculty teaching units: the Foreign Language Study Centre and the Physical Education and Sports Centre. At present, Jan Dlugosz University offers over 40 fields of study of:\n\nFirst cycle programs (undergraduate studies) with bachelor’s degrees.\n\nSecond cycle programs (graduate studies) with master’s degrees, as well as engineer’s degrees.\n\nThird cycle (Ph.D.) programs: in Chemistry, Physics, History, Literary Studies and Linguistics.\n\nMoreover, at JDU there are over 60 forms of postgraduate programs.\n\nThe University has the right to confer the postdoctoral degree in History. Proceedings are pending to acquire the right to confer additional certifications in other fields of study.\n\nThe strength of the Alma Mater is its staff who work hard on extending and consolidating the achievements of the University. Currently, JDU employs 648 teachers. Among them, there are 440 academics and 148 independent ones, of whom 30 are titular (full) professors.\n\nJDU is involved in the popularisation of education in its various forms among elderly people. About 650 students - retired members of our community attend different courses of study offered by the University of the Third Age.\n\nAnastasiya Gepp / Pexels\n\nCooperation with foreign academic centers is an important element of recognition and classification of any school. Our Alma Mater has a long and extensive tradition in this field. So far, the authorities of JDU have concluded multiple agreements concerning collaboration with different centers of science and research worldwide. The cooperation has resulted in exchange programs for students and academic staff. The results of the implementation of numerous bilateral agreements and jointly finance research projects are applied in practice by both civil engineering and military industries.\n\nThe Main Library is a real treasure of the University. Its collection comprises almost 300 thousand items, i.e. books, science journals, documents and a collection of special titles. The librarians are very active in propagating reading; they organize numerous exhibitions devoted to issues important for the region, history, and art.\n\nAcademics can publish all the results of their research at Jan Dlugosz University Publishing House, which is recognized not only regionally and nationally, but also on an international scale. Its representatives take part in the most important book-fairs in Poland and Europe. The House provides publications devoted to different fields of study.\n\nJDU boasts a planetarium, a new attraction for students and all the inhabitants of the region of Częstochowa, which is equipped with one of the most technologically advanced projection instruments in the world.\n\nAcademic sports develop rapidly. The JDU student-athletes compete in sporting events organized by academic centers all over the country and abroad. They are classified among the best sportsmen and sportswomen of all universities in Poland.\n\nAcademic authorities of our Alma Mater closely watch the political and social transformations taking place in Poland and in Europe, especially the fast-changing demands of the labor market, which is a crucial factor in tailoring the educational offer of the University. Thus, the academics of JDU introduce new systems of education, and cooperation with foreign educational centers, not only with member states of the European Union but also with states outside the Union, e.g. in Eastern Europe."
