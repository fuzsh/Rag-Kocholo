        "text": "Jan Długosz University in Częstochowa is a community proud to have nearly a 50-year history. That history forms our traditions which sustain our ambitions to improve the academic centre of Częstochowa – so it is associated with dynamic research, high quality education, and the highest challenges for student enlightenment, open to culture, art, sport and the world. Today’s modern campus does not only educate students and doctoral candidates, but is, above all, a center that encourages economic and social development for the whole region. Being the region’s envoy, the University inspires action and serves the residents of the city, voivodeship, Poland and Europe. We endeavor to improve the quality of our University every day. New directions of study, specialties, titles and academic degrees are opened. Our staff engage in new areas of research, participate in scientific, scholarship and art exchange, and boast accomplishments tied to initiative and inventiveness... For you and myself, I intend that our University evolves positively, aware of its status and significance for where it functions; for it to be a valued and solid partner for other centres of knowledge, and for other institutions in Poland and abroad.\n\nJan Długosz University in Częstochowa is a public university, with its history that traces back to 1971. At present, the University comprises 4 faculties with more than 40 fields of study, with bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. It offers postgraduate studies and courses, and opens new fields of study accommodating the needs raised by employers. The University community is created by 648 academic staff who provide education to students from different corners of the country and the world.\n\nThe history of our Alma Mater reaches back to the year 1971. Following the decision of the Council of Ministers of the time, a Teacher Training College was established. In 1974 it was transformed into a Higher Teacher Education School. The employees of the University who remember that historical event for Częstochowa and the region stress that establishing a graduate school of humanities was of great importance for the fast-developing city. Many people acknowledge that it was an unprecedented decision, because those days the authorities showed much more favourable attitudes towards technical universities. Graduates in engineering science were in demand by dynamically developing industrial plants of the region. First diplomas for the completion of vocational education and training studies were awarded in 1973. The first Master of Arts and Master of Science diplomas were granted by the School authorities in 1977.\n\nJDU is involved in popularisation of education in its various forms among elderly people. About 650 students - retired members of our community attend different courses of study offered by the University of the Third Age.\n\nCooperation with foreign academic centres is an important element of recognition and classification of any school. Our Alma Mater has long and extensive tradition in this field. So far, we have concluded multiple agreements concerning cooperation with different centres of science and research worldwide. The cooperation has resulted in exchange programmes for students and academic staff. We implement bilateral agreements and jointly finance research projects whose results can be applied in practice by both civil engineering and military industries.\n\nThe Main Library is a real treasure of the University. Its collection comprises almost 300 thousand items, i.e. books, science journals, documents and a collection of special titles. The librarians are very active in propagating reading; they organize numerous exhibitions devoted to issues important for the region, history and art."
