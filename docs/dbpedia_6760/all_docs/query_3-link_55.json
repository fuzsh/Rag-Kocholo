        "text": "On February 2-5, 2024, the JDU delegation participated in the Polish Universities Fair in Chicago. There was also a meeting with the Consul General of the Republic of Poland in Chicago, Dr. Paweł Zyzak, and a meeting with representatives of the scientific community. In addition to NAWA, 12 universities took part in the delegation to Chicago. Together with NAWA, the co-organisers of the events responsible for promotion primarily on site were: the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in Chicago, the Association of Polish Teachers in America, the Polish Institute in New York, the Copernicus Center, Fulbright Poland, Polonium Foundation. Our University was represented by a two-person delegation: dr Andrii Galaidin, specialist for foreign relations and dr Bartosz Stuła, an academic at the Faculty of Humanities of JDU, President of the Erasmus Student Club. The fair of Polish universities was visited by about 300 people (teens, parents, teachers, school heads, representatives of Polish diaspora organisations). There was a visible interest in the offer of NAWA programmes, as well as of Jan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa, by the Polish diaspora living in Chicago. Participation in the fair was a great opportunity to present the educational offer and the possibility of studying at our University. The meeting from the \"Polish Science & International Mobility\" series gathered over 20 people, not counting the Polish delegation. There were representatives of the Polish scientific community, Polish diaspora organisations, scholarship holders on exchanges, and American scientists. The represented universities are the University of Illinois Chicago, Northeastern Illinois University and the Illinois Institute of Technology, to name but a few."
