        "text": "STER program in the discipline of Linguistics\n\nPolish and/or English in the European context: history – media – discourse – culture\n\nThe project is co-financed from the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA) and from the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme Knowledge, Education, Development, a noncompetition project entitled “Supporting the institutional capacity of Polish HEIs through the creation and implementation of international study programmes” implemented under Measure 3.3 Internationalisation of the Polish higher education, specified in the application for project cofinancing No POWR.03.03.00-00-PN16/18.\n\nProject number: PPI/STE/2018/1/00006\n\nProgram description\n\nThe recruitment for the Doctoral School for students not holding Polish citizenship under the STER program starts on May 6, 2019!\n\nJan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa participates in the STER program and opens recruitment for the Doctoral School for candidates from abroad wishing to write a doctoral dissertation in the field of Humanities in the discipline of Linguistics.\n\nFrom the second semester, there is a possibility to be granted a STER scholarship funded by the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA) and European Social Fund for the best scholarly results and achievements. In this way participation in the STER program, to a big extent, will facilitate the foreign doctoral students to conduct their scientific research in the discipline of Linguistics at Jan Dlugosz University Doctoral School in Częstochowa.\n\nWhy is it worth applying to the STER program?\n\nStudies are free of charge and last 8 semesters in a stationary mood.\n\nGuaranteed scholarships – all the non-native doctoral students receive a monthly scholarship throughout the 8 semesters. From the 2nd semester on, depending on the achieved results 50% of non-native participants of the STER program will receive scholarships in the amount of 5.000 PLN gross. The remaining participants of the STER program will receive the statutory doctoral scholarship.\n\nDoctoral exam (after the 8th semester) in the discipline of Linguistics.\n\nIndividual educational program.\n\nUpgrading students’ knowledge of foreign languages (including Polish).\n\nSome practicalities\n\nUndertaking study abroad is an exciting time, which requires effective and careful step-by-step preparation.

The must-be-submitted documents and other specific requirements vary from country to country, therefore it is highly recommended to ask the local Polish Embassy. Although, in every student visa application, the required documents are:\n\nAcceptance letter from the university,\n\nVisa supporting letter,\n\nMedical insurance,\n\nBank statement meaning proof of sufficient means for living and returning from Poland,\n\nOriginal passport,\n\nTickets,\n\nVisa fee,\n\nVisa application.\n\nRemember that a Polish national/student visa allows you to study in Poland and travel for short periods to other Schengen countries only. If you plan to go in and out of Poland many times, apply for a multiple entry visa.\n\nIn case of being granted a student visa, when you are traveling to Poland, please carry your acceptance letter from the university. At the border control when entering Poland and consequently the European Union first time, you will be asked about the purpose of your trip and if necessary, requested to provide proof of that purpose.\n\nInsurance\n\nEach student is required to have valid insurance, which entitles you to the use of medical care in Poland, for the duration of the studies. The citizens of the Member States of the European Union should have a European Health Insurance Card / EHIC issued in the country of origin.\n\nContact\n\nSchool office\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nProfessor UJD, dr hab.
