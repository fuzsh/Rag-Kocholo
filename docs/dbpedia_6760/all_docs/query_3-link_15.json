        "text": "JDU is the former Higher Teacher Education School, which was transformed into a university. The event, so important for the entire academic community of Częstochowa, was celebrated on 1 October 2004. Since June 1, 2023, our University has been operating under a new Polish name and has joined the group of classic Polish universities (by the Act of 14 April 2023 signed on May 1, 2023 by the President of the Republic of Poland).\n\nThe history of our Alma Mater reaches back to the year 1971. Following the decision of the Council of Ministers of the time, a Teacher Training College was established. In 1974 it was transformed into a Higher Teacher Education School. The employees of the University who remember that historical event for Częstochowa and the region stress that establishing a graduate school of humanities was of great importance for the fast-developing city. Many people acknowledge that it was an unprecedented decision, as those days the authorities showed much more favourable attitudes towards technical universities. Graduates in engineering science were in demand by dynamically developing industrial plants of the region. First diplomas for the completion of vocational education and training studies were awarded in 1973. The first Master of Arts and Master of Science diplomas were granted by the School authorities in 1977.\n\nThe beginnings of our Alma Mater were quite modest. The College and the early HTES had only 2 faculties: the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences and the Faculty of Pedagogy.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, by the decision of the European Education and Culture Executive Agency in Brussels (EACEA), Jan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa was granted the status of a European University. Only a few Polish universities can boast such a success. In the opinion of the University authorities, this will further deepen the internationalisation of JDU and increase its recognition in Europe and in the world.\n\nThe Main Library is a real treasure of the University. Its collection comprises almost 370 thousand items, i.e. books, science journals, documents and a collection of special titles. The librarians are very active in propagating reading; they organise numerous exhibitions devoted to issues important for the region, history and art.\n\nFor the last 50 years, Jan Dlugosz University has been developing rapidly and growing in strength. Now the University comprises 6 faculties with over 60 fields of study with:\n\n- first cycle programmes (undergraduate studies) with bachelor’s degrees\n\n- second cycle programmes (graduate studies) with master’s degrees, as well as engineer’s degrees\n\n- third cycle (PhD) programmes\n\n- 35 forms of postgraduate programmes\n\n- postdoctoral degrees\n\n- double diplomas\n\n- courses & training\n\nCertainly, it is worth emphasizing that the University has obtained the consent of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education to launch the medical faculty (July 14, 2022) and conduct recruitment for the first year of studies! Another important event influencing the expansion of the educational offer was obtaining permission to launch a long-cycle master's degree programme in the field of pharmacy (May 8, 2023).\n\nMultidisciplinary by nature, the Doctoral School of Jan Dlugosz University in Czestochowa is a perfect place to start a research career. It provides doctoral programmes conducted in 13 fields of: chemical sciences, philosophy, physical sciences, history, linguistics, literary studies, musical arts, fine arts & art restoration and health sciences. The School is authorised to confer doctoral degrees in the disciplines of pedagogy, legal sciences, health sciences, safety sciences and physical culture.\n\nThe strength of the Alma Mater is its staff who work hard on extending and consolidating the achievements of the University. Currently, JDU employs 740 teachers. Among them there are around 480 academics and 180 independent ones, of whom about 60 are titular (full) professors.\n\nCooperation with foreign academic centres is an important element of recognition and classification of any school. Our Alma Mater has long and extensive tradition in this field. So far, the authorities of JDU have concluded multiple agreements concerning collaboration with different centres of science and research worldwide. The cooperation has resulted in exchange programmes for students and academic staff. The results of the implementation of numerous bilateral agreements and jointly finance research projects are applied in practice by both civil engineering and military industries.\n\nThe fast-changing demands of the labour market is a crucial factor in tailoring the educational offer of the University. Thus, the academics of JDU introduce new systems of education (dual studies), modern teaching & learning approaches (tutoring system or online learning). Students have an opportunity to increase their multilingualism by taking free of charge courses in so-called rare languages.\n\nRectors:\n\n1. 1971-1977 doc. dr Marian Jakubowski, pedagogy\n\n2. 1977 -1980 prof. dr hab.
