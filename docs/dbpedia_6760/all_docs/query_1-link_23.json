        "text": "The fifteenth century was a very important period in the history of the Polish State and nation. It had a particular significance for the development of national consciousness. The union of the Polish kingdom with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1385) changed not only the boundaries of this new and unified state called the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but also created new and specific conditions for the development of the nation. The different nationalities of the jagiellonian state, Poles, Ruthenians, Lithuanians, Germans, Jews, and Armenians played an important role in the lively exchange of cultural experience on the basis of a sometimes uneasy partnership. Poland guaranteed privileges to the lords, both spiritual and temporal, to the gentry, and to the patricians, estates that had emerged in the course of the fourteenth century. These were united by common sentiment and desire for a strong political foundation. The urban and rural populations of both Polish and non-Polish speakers were bound together by loyalty to the Crown and its territory. Like other groups in late-medieval Europe they saw such a political union as advantageous.\n\n1 For relevant general histories of late-medieval Poland, see especially Gieysztor, A. and Kieniewicz, S., eds., A History of Poland (Warsaw, 1968), pp. 133–207Google Scholar; Halecki, O., A History of Poland (London, 1978), pp. 65–127Google Scholar; Davies, N., God’s Playground: A History of Poland, 2 vols (Oxford, 1982), 1, pp. 115–55Google Scholar; Davies, N., Heart of Europe. A Short History of Poland (Oxford, 1986), pp. 291ffGoogle Scholar. For a more specific topic and detailed bibliography, see Borkowska, U., ‘The funeral ceremonies of the Polish kings from the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries’,JEH, 36 (1985), pp. 513–34.Google Scholar\n\n4 Długosz, J. Annales seu cronicae incliti regni Poloniae, lib. I—VIII, ed. Dabrowski, J., 4 vols, (Warsaw, 1964-75)Google Scholar [hereafter A with the number of the volume]. Since notali of Długosz’s Annales have been re-edited, the earlier edition is also quoted in the present paper: Historiae Poloniae, lib. xii, vols 1—5 in Opera Omnia, vols 10—14, ed. Przezdziecki, A. (Cracow, 1873-9)Google Scholar [hereafter H]. Other works used as the basis of the present study are Liber beneficiorum dioecesis Cracoviensis, vols 1-3 in Opera Omnia, ed. Przezdziecki, A., vols 7-9 (Cracow, 1863-4)Google Scholar [here after LB]; Vita beatae Kunegundis, ed. Polkowsi, I. and Pauli, Z., ibid, vol 1 (Cracow, 1887), pp. 183–336Google Scholar [hereafter VK]; Vita sanctissimi Stanislai Cracoviensis episcopi, ibid., pp. 1-180 [here after VS];, Vitae episcoporum Poloniae, ibid., pp. 337-547 [hereafter VE]; Epistolae … ab anno 1447-1448, ibid., pp. 597—638 [hereafter E]; also Vitae episcoporum Plocensium, ed. Ketryzyñski, W. in Monumenta Poloniae Historica, vol. 6 (Lvov, 1893), pp. 592–619.Google Scholar\n\n10 Highly significant in this context is die manner in which Długosz describes Poland in the period of feudal disintegration. He speaks of the country as if it were a sick and torn body. Having united part of the territories in 1295, Przemysław deliberated with his Council as to how ‘tenerum et molle Regni Poloniae corpus coalesceret et in virile robur evaderet’, A, IV, p. 287.\n\n13 This was a significant trait of Długosz’s mentality. For instance, he blames the bishops of Kamień for harming themselves and the Kingdom ‘fraudendo et primarium ecclesiae Caymenensis fundatorem et dotatorem, Boleslaum videlicet Chabri Poloniae Regem, et eius piam et devotam ordinationem adulterando’, VE, p. 341. He sharply criticizes the religious Orders, which have departed from the intentions of their founders, and have thus brought the wrath of God upon themselves, LB, III, pp. 103,106-7,222.\n\n23 VE, pp. 345, 519. The terms ‘the Polish Church’, ‘the Polish episcopate’, which appear countless times in the writings of Długosz, deserve all the more attention because they appear so rarely in earlier chronicles such as Gallus Anonymous, Wincenty Kadlubek, the Wiekopolska Chronicle, and the Silesian sources. Attention to the emphasis placed on the national character of the Church was drawn by Guenée, B., L’Occident aux xive et xve siècles (Paris, 1971), p. 238.Google Scholar\n\n27 VE, pp. 469,472; H, III, p. 501. There are exceptions such as Rudolph of Rüdesheim, whom Długosz supported as a candidate to the see of Wrocław [Eubel, 2, p. 270]. The chronicler must here have been convinced that the papal legate had a positive attitude towards Poland. Possibly he viewed his candidature solely through the prism of the positive resolution of the Polish-Teutonic conflict which Rudolph helped to bring about in 1466."
