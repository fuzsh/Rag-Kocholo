        "text": "Introduction\n\nWater-only fasting (WF) is an absolute cessation of food consumption while consuming water at libitum. This type of fasting is believed to improve health and can help motivate a healthy diet and lifestyle changes.1,2 It has been found that this type of intervention stimulates physiological effects that are potentially favorable to health. They include enhanced ketogenesis, modulated hormone activity, reduced inflammation and oxidative stress symptoms, lipolysis, autophagy, and improved physical and emotional well-being.3,4 When taking into account the above data, it can be concluded that even prolonged fasting may not deteriorate health condition, and even have therapeutic values. The WF intervention is defined as a “zero calorie diet”.5 –7\n\nWhen using WF, it is crucial to remember to maintain the safety of people participating in such experiments. They should be monitored for possible adverse effects caused by WF, such as: increased uric acid and creatinine blood concentrations, decreased glomerular filtration, or other serious health complications.8,9 Ketosis, which develops from the first days of fasting, is its metabolic consequence. In the early days of starvation, which is considered a mild and stable state, ketone bodies are an alternative source of energy substrates for the nervous system and other body cells, the metabolism of which depends on glucose.\n\nThe concentration of ketone bodies, such as β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), increases after just a few days of fasting. They show neuroprotective effects by increased mitochondrial respiration ensuring the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).10 –12 Moreover, ketone bodies can promote the excitability of neuronal membranes, the occurrence of autophagy, while reducing inflammation and inhibiting the production of free radicals.13 Conversely, acidosis stimulates the unfavorable process of calcium release from bones.14 In addition, ketones that persist in the body for an extended period of time can prevent or reverse abnormalities in heart energy metabolism that occur during fasting.15 The disadvantageous effect of short-term total fasting is the deterioration of bone formation markers. However, the most noticeable change that occurs during fasting or caloric restriction is weight loss, this reduction applies to both fat-free mass and body fat.16,17\n\nWhen undertaking WF, it is recommended that an individual drink 2-3 liters of fluid daily, especially in the form of mineralized water. This partially covers the body's needs to keep the balance of particular minerals.18,19 It should be emphasized that the minerals contained in these waters are well absorbed, often much better than those from food, which is an important attribute in times of fasting. On the other hand, the low water consumption accompanying WF, in the absence of nutrients supplied with food, can lead to a significant loss of sodium and potassium from the body and the occurrence of hypovolemia, which threatens the safety of people using this type of intervention.20 Therefore, in order to assess the clinical status and safety of WF individuals, the levels of natremia, kaliemia and volemia should be monitored.5\n\nStudy Objective\n\nThe presented study was aimed at determining whether the 8-day WF undertaken by a group of men was a safe practice for their body. This thesis was verified by examining somatic changes, water-mineral and protein balance, kidney function and the intensity of perceived stress before and after the 8-day WF.\n\nResults\n\nThe mean value of perceived stress measured with the PSS-10 was found to be higher on the first day of WF than after the 8th day of the intervention in question. The average result obtained in the PSS-10 for the entire group was 23.83 ± 4.73, which is classified on the borderline of 7th and 8th sten score as high values. However, after 8 days of WF, the average score obtained in the PSS-10 for this group was 12.76 ± 3.45, which is classified on the borderline of 4th and 5th sten score as low and average values.\n\npresents the age of studied men and their somatic data. The results indicate a significant influence of WF especially on: Body Weight (BW); Body Height (BH); Body Fat (BF); Fat Free Mass (FFM); Total Body Water (TBW); Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA).\n\nTable 1.\n\nVariableBeforeAfterMean ±SDMean ±SDSignificance (p)Age50.25±14.1850.25±14.18NSBW [kg]79.38±10.7973.42±10.26p<0.001BH [cm]178.67±4.54178.67±4.54NSBF

the intervention.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe stress burden is considered to be the risk of developing civilization diseases, and thus pro-health activities can be used, such as fasting.23 After performing the PSS-10, it was found that 8-day WF reduced the level of perceived stress from 23.83 ± 4.73 (classified as high stress level) to 12.76 ± 3.45 (classified on the border of moderate and low stress level). The 8-day WF can be considered an acute form of stress for the body that increases immunity, while chronic stress impairs the body's ability to produce a strong immune response.24 Among the many other effects of fasting on the body, one should mention its therapeutic impact on neurological diseases or the activation of autophagy.25 The effects of fasting are modified by various factors and it has been shown that in the group of amateur athletes, it improved mental flexibility, increased anger and intensified cognitive functions.26 In turn, in the group of obese elderly women, fasting was found to cause fatigue and prolonged reaction time in the two-choice reaction time test, decrease mental flexibility and activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.27 In addition, fasting reduced negative affect and led to the withdrawal of symptoms in drug users.28\n\nIn addition to modifying changes in the nervous system that occur during fasting, there is also a reduction in glucose consumption and an increased metabolism of ketone bodies. With regard to our subjects, after 8 days of WF, a significant increase in the plasma concentration of β-HB was found, which largely supplies energy to the brain during fasting.17,29 It is an efficient energy system due to the fact that β-HB possesses an intrinsic high heat of combustion. In addition, this compound reduces the production of reactive oxygen species and inflammation.30,31 β-HB also plays a crucial role in cell signaling that may have important implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of metabolic diseases.10,11 Based on the results of the presented research and the results of studies by other authors cited above, it is impossible to explain the mechanism of reducing the perceived stress by the 8-day WF. However, this is a positive adaptive change that helps to consciously continue fasting for many days.\n\nThe use of WF for 8 days also affected the dehydration of studied men, which translated into water sparing (reduced water content in the body as well as reduced urine volume) and has been described by other authors.32,33 The occurring dehydration was also manifested as a significant reduction of plasma osmolality. However, it should be acknowledged that this dehydration takes a mild form, as urine osmolality, osmotic clearance and free water clearance were unchanged after 8 days of WF versus the pre-intervention study.\n\nIn terms of ion metabolism in the body among studied men, it was reported that the concentration levels of sodium, total calcium and magnesium in the serum decreased significantly after 8 days of WF. With regard to calcium and magnesium, this adverse effect in the serum was completely compensated by the kidneys, as no differences were noticed in their concentration or daily excretion, nor in the clearance, filtration or fractional excretion in the urine after the 8-day CWF versus the values ​​recorded before the fasting intervention. A different picture of changes was observed in relation to sodium, as its serum concentration decreased below the reference value (hyponatremia) after the fasting intervention. An effective response to this unfavorable change was sodium sparing in the body, as its concentration levels in urine, clearance, daily and fractional urinary excretion were significantly reduced after 8 days of WF, with unchanged filtration. This indicates increased reabsorption of this mineral in nephron tubules. The occurrence of hyponatremia in conditions of fasting has also been described by other authors.34 Hyponatraemia is defined as serum sodium below 136 mmol/L, which occurred after 8 days of WF.35 Hyponatraemia is considered a serious clinical complication that can even be fatal and should therefore be properly diagnosed and treated.36 In our study, hyponatremia, along with hypoglycaemia, were the main factors in reducing plasma osmolality. Accompanying hyponatremia and sodium sparing, decreased daily and fractional urine excretion of potassium, urea and uric acid, with reduced volume of more acidic urine excreted during the 8-day WF, was an attempt to compensate and maintain the water-mineral balance of the body. On the other hand, it must be pointed out that maintaining the water-mineral balance after 8-days of WF was not possible, although urine osmolality, osmotic clearance and free water clearance did not change statistically when compared to the state before the application of the 8-day WF.\n\nBeing aware that changes in the water-mineral balance may have extensive negative effects on the body, it is necessary to increase medical supervision over the safety of fasting men already at this stage of fasting.\n\nOther unfavorable effects of the 8-day WF included elevated serum uric acid concentration levels, which significantly exceeded the upper limit of the reference value.37 At the same time, no compensatory reaction of the kidneys was observed, as the daily and fractional urinary excretion of this compound, as well as its clearance during the 8-day WF, were significantly reduced, despite its increased filtration versus the values ​​reported before this intervention. Although uric acid acts as a strong antioxidant, which determines the antioxidant potential of plasma in humans in about 60%,38 when it enters the cellular environment, it activates oxidative stress.39,40 This promotes the oxidation of lipids, proteins, DNA and carbohydrates.41 As a result of the intensification of oxidative stress in hyperuricemia, both nephritis and systemic inflammation may also occur.42,43 Moreover, it has been shown that hyperuricemia causes significant changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics, resulting in a loss of renal autoregulation.44 Also, it leads to hypertension, insulin resistance, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic syndrome.45\n\nIn the light of the above data, it should be concluded that the 8-day WF leading to hyperuricemia is an absolute contraindication for use in patients with renal diseases. On the other hand, no negative acute events that could be associated with hyperuricemia were observed in healthy men participating in this study. However, it does not mean that such effects may become apparent at a later time. Therefore, it would be justified to undertake further research in this direction.\n\nAlthough the 8-day WF resulted in a significant reduction in body weight and the absolute values ​​of BF, FFM, TBW, BMI and BSA (p <0.001), no significant, adverse changes in the serum or in urine concentration of creatinine, protein or urea were observed. In addition, it was noticed that the daily urea excretion was significantly reduced after this intervention. It should also be noted that although the urea filtration did not change, its clearance and fractional excretion decreased significantly. These data indicate an increased reabsorption of urea in the renal tubules, which together led to the beneficial phenomenon of sparing the body's protein reserves. Therefore, it can be concluded that the protein balance after the 8-day WF was still maintained. In this respect, it should be recognized that the 8-day WF was not yet a dangerous intervention for the body, because in such earlier stages of fasting, processes like increased lipolysis, fat oxidation, ketone bodies synthesis, controlled glucose production and uptake, and less glucose oxidation protect the protein mass against catabolism.46 It was found that only in the final phase of starvation was there a significant loss of muscle mass and protein content, inhibition of its synthesis and increased breakdown of muscle proteins.47,48 It is during this late stage of starvation that the degraded proteins provide the carbon chains to the synthesis of newly formed glucose.46\n\nSome of the results of biochemical and physiological tests underwent statistically significant changes under the influence of the applied 8-day WF and exceeded the reference values ​​for healthy people whose diet met physiological criteria, but at the same time no acute, negative clinical changes were observed. The literature suggests that negative health effects caused by WF are extremely rare.49 The lack of reference values ​​for individual biochemical and physiological variables occurring during this type of starvation necessitates increased clinical control or discontinuation of this type of intervention. Clinical experience shows that staying in the conditions of hyponatraemia, hyperuricemia or low blood glucose levels caused by WF for many days is unfavorable.\n\nCertain scientific reports can be found in the literature on the beneficial use of WF for the health.50 In order for prolonged, several days or longer, fasting to bring benefits to the body, participants need to master the art of leading the body out of the state of fasting to the ability of tolerating physiological nutrition. This is as important as the fasting process itself, and an inept return to physiological nutrition can lead to serious health consequences and even death.51 Therefore, the men participating in the present study were instructed on the principles of nutrition for the next 7 days after stopping WF."
