        "text": "All reviews of published articles are made public. This includes manuscript files, peer review comments, author rebuttals and revised materials. Note: This was optional for articles submitted before 13 February 2023.\n\nPeer reviewers are encouraged (but not required) to provide their names to the authors when submitting their peer review. If they agree to provide their name, then their personal profile page will reflect a public acknowledgment that they performed a review (even if the article is rejected). If the article is accepted, then reviewers who provided their name will be associated with the article itself.\n\nView examples of open peer review.\n\nDear Authors,\n\nYour work is great and interesting but need some corrections and adjustments prior the publication.\n\nIn accordance with the reviewer reports, I suggested modifying the text following their advice which surely iwill mprove the quality of your work.\n\nIn particular, English form and grammar need substantial revisions in accordance with the advice provided by the revisors.\n\nSome technical aspects need more clarifications.\n\nThis additional comment provided by one reviewer, in my opinion, should not be addressed because the background and the motivation for the KTK choice is well written and clarified by your introduction section.\n\n1) I am not sure how the cultural factors and various contexts of Physical activity referred to Chinese children may reflect on the requested tasks for the KTK test. I don’t understand why you didn’t investigate the reliability, validity and cultural suitability of TGMD3 instead, because it is a measurement tool that can give different results when it is used in different cultural backgrounds (Hulteen et al., 2022).\n\n[# PeerJ Staff Note: Please ensure that all review and editorial comments are addressed in a response letter and any edits or clarifications mentioned in the letter are also inserted into the revised manuscript where appropriate. #]\n\n[# PeerJ Staff Note: The review process has identified that the English language must be improved. PeerJ can provide language editing services - please contact us at copyediting@peerj.com for pricing (be sure to provide your manuscript number and title) #]\n\nBasic reporting\n\nDear Authors, I appreciate your work and contribution to this topic. I will try to help You raise the quality of the work.\n\nEnglish is professional, but I recommend asking a colleague who is an expert in the field and a fluent English speaker to do a language correction because in some places synonyms are used in not clear way.\n\nThe introduction clearly shows the context, the gap in knowledge and aims of the study. The literature is adequate and up-to-date.\n\nPlease adjust the text and remove single letters like “a” on the end of the lines.\n\nExperimental design\n\nThe research meets the aims and scope of the journal. Research questions are well defined. It is stated how research fills an identified knowledge gap.\n\nThe research seems to meet technical and ethical standards.\n\nLines 42-45: there are older and more original (rooted) publications defining physical fitness – it is worth to cite the older as well as the newest approach\n\nLine 134 – please change to “turns” or “tries”\n\nLines 135-141 – please reframe and add more details – how long was the run up, line 137 – does it mean that in the first attempt there were 5 pillows? And what happened next?\n\nWhat is more – HH test need coordination to complete it, but it need more strength or dynamic lower limbs force to reach a high result.\n\nLine 145 – please change tests to tries.\n\nWhat is more – the JS test need coordination but includes also speed and dynamic force of the lower limbs, so it is not fully justyfied to write that the KTK test do not involve physical fitness (line 84)\n\nLines 155-156 – add what statistical parameters\n\nLine 180 – please change to videorecorded\n\nLines 210 – 213 – please move to the “participants” section and remove repetitions\n\nLine 268 “The fragile result of this study could be related to the specificity of each assessment” – not informative sentence – please reframe\n\nLine 273 – all in all is very colloquial, please change (f.e. To sum up) or remove\n\nLines 286-294 – please move to a separate section – limitations of the study\n\nAnother limitation is the fact that the participants came from one region-city and one single school – this could have had a significant impact on the results.\n\nLines 296-300 – the conclusions section needs to be totally reframed. Conclusions should be clear and consistent and answer the research questions, confirm the hypothesis or be consistent with the aims of the study. Conclusions should be based only on the results that are presented in the study.\n\nLines 297-300 can be put in the discussion section\n\nValidity of the findings\n\nRaw data files are provided and can be opened.\n\nConclusions section needs reframing - see above comments.\n\nThere is no information about funding and possible conflicts of interests\n\nBasic reporting\n\nDear Authors and Editors:\n\nI appreciate your contribution to the preparation of this work, the subject matter discussed in the text is interesting from the point of view of the practical application of an easy and cheap diagnostic method in monitoring children's fitness. It can shed new light and thus increase the potential of the diagnostic tools used (battery tests). However, I have some suggestions and recommendations that can improve the quality of your work and make it easier to interpret.\n\nBasic reporting\n\nThe structure and language of the article are good and acceptable, allowing the reader to easily understand its content. However, a few errors in terms of correctness and clarity could be improved by using language correction. This will help to enhance the quality of the language used in the article.\n\nLine 77 - change the wording \" a number of\"\n\nLine 113 - replace the phase \" the aim of our study was\"\n\nLine 141-142 - rewrite of clarity\n\nLine 143 - no article \"the\"\n\nLine 151 - fix the agreement mistake \"test\" and \"points\"\n\nLine 160 - change the verb form \"were\"\n\nLine 162 - change to a genitive case \"authors\"\n\nLine 168 - no article \"the\"\n\nLine 181 - change preposition 2x \"from\"\n\nLine 190 - change the wording \" in accordance with\"\n\nLine 207 - correct article usage \"data\" use \"the\"\n\nLine 218 - change the spelling \"specialties\" on \"specialities\"\n\nLine 223 - change the name font \"BROWN2\" to the same in the references\n\nLine 224 - add a hyphen between \"low level\"\n\nLine 241 - change the verb form \"were\" to \"was\"\n\nLine 271 - add a hyphen between \"high reliability\"\n\nLine 277,279 - correct article usage \"the Cronbach's\"\n\nLine 280 - remove the comma after \"subitems\"\n\nLine 282 - change the wording \"In order to\"\n\nLine 288 – 289 – Rewrite for clarity\n\nLine 295 – 296 – Rewrite for clarity\n\nLine 305 – change the noun form 2x \"assessments\"\n\nLine 324 - correct article usage \"overall\"\n\nLine 324 - change the wording \"in a comprehensive manner\"\n\nRaw data\n\nI propose making the raw data available in a different file extension, e.g. CSV or Excel because it is a small database that does not contain a large number of rows and columns. Of course, the SAV-type extension is acceptable but is used only in professional statistical analysis programs (commercial). If the work is to be easy to analyze for other scientists, I would suggest changing to CSV - import from this file format is more common in the world.\n\nExperimental design\n\nThe main limitation of this validation project is the small number of people tested in relation to the difficulty of performing the test. The test is easy and does not require any financial outlay. Therefore, it was possible to extend the duration of the project and to test more children in different age ranges. The description of the project is easy to repeat for other researchers, so it will certainly be verified in another research group in the future.\n\nValidity of the findings\n\nNo major comments. Correct construction of this section.\n\nOnly the lack of a section with a clear indication of the further direction of the team's research."
