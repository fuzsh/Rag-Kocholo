        "text": "March 19, 2018\n\nVery good collection of stories written by Jan Długosz, in the fifties of last century one of the best Polish climbers, also an instructor and precursor of innovative climbing techniques who died in the Tatra mountains at the age 33. This volume contains stories that are placed both in Polish mountains but also shows his accomplishments in the Alps and the Caucasus. It reads partly as a reportage and account of first pioneering climbs but also as a great adventure novel. Długosz freely mixes facts and fiction, sometimes stretches it and doesn't shy away from metaphysics spiced with magic. It’s illustrated with many photos both places and climbers. In Poland it deservedly has status of cult novel and classics of the genre. It has its historic merits as well as it evokes plenty authentic events and people.\n\nThere are some chilling stories especially the one that recounts tragic attempt of first ascent the central Pillar of Frêney of Mont Blanc that ended tragically with death of four alpinists. The same very one that Długosz with some other climbers reached some weeks later. I love mountains but due to my fear of heights some paths and peaks stay for me unreachable so that I’m limited to easier and not so exposed mountain trails. I’m not saying that kind of writing compensates my inability but definitely the book is not only for mountain lovers. It also shows this more human face of alpinism and times when climbing was more about adventure and friendship and coping with own abilities than money and sponsors and feeding frenzy."
