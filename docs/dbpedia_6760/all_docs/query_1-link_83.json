        "text": "And Franks were none Germanic, most likely speaking a form of Latin as the Prussians described by Jan Dlugosz , XV Cent.AD did.\n\nPrussians spoke Baltic language, not Latin.\n\nWhen it comes to Jan Dlugosz and Prussians:\n\nDługosz writes, when describing events in year 1043, military campaigns of Polish prince Casimir I the Restorer:\n\n\"(...) In mentioned battle fought in Mazovia, at the banks of the Vistula, 2000 enemies were captured and 15000 were slain. (...) After this victory, achieved with God's help over Masław, Prussians, Yotvingians and other barbarians (...) even Prussians themselves, forced to dependency from the Polish king, totally surrendered to his power. Obtaining from king Kazimierz the promise of releasing Prussian prisoners, and accepting the imposed ransom, Prussians remained in the state of allegiance and submission to Poland, paying annual tribute to the Polish people. Under the reign of king Kazimierz, thanks to his amazing efforts and great fame, finally justice and absolute peace prevailed over the country. (...)\"\n\nMasław was an usurper who took power over eastern Polish land of Mazovia after the \"pagan reaction\" temporarily overthrew Christianity in Poland (causing overall chaos). Masław's Mazovia allied with Prussians, Yotvingians and \"other barbarians\", when he was invaded by Casimir.\n\nAfter the defeat, Masław escaped to Prussian lands. He tried to convince them to break their acknowledgement of sovereignity of Poland over them and to fight against Poland once again. But Prussians were mad at Masław due to the losses they suffered and decided to kill him.\n\n=======================================\n\nAnd then under year 1064 Jan Długosz has the following event:\n\n\"King of Poland defeats once again the rebelling and refusing to pay the agreed tribute Prussians, forcing them by war to pay it.\"\n\n========================================\n\nThen under year 1091 Długosz writes again:\n\n\"Polish duke conquers the rebelling Pomeranians and Prussians.\"\n\nThen he describes the battle of Rzeczen (Rechen) in 1091, in which Pomeranians allied with Prussians were defeated by Polish forces.\n\nAnd after that Polish victory, as Długosz writes:\n\n\"(...) Exhausted by that fight, Pomeranians and Prussians, returning to submission, surrender themselves with all of their possessions to prince Władysław and intensely ask him for forgiveness. Prince easily forgave them, believing that in the future they would remain loyal. But he took away from their ownership and administration all of their most important strongholds, giving them under administration of his trusted knights. He also ordered to burn some strongholds, mainly ones located at the border, to even more deprive those people of opportunities for rebellions. (...)\"\n\n=====================================\n\nBut just one year later - in 1092 - there was another rebellion (despite all of preemptive measures applied in 1091):\n\n\"(...) Polish prince expected, that after smashing the rebellion of Prussians and Pomeranans he was going to breathe easy that year, but unexpectedly messangers came and told him that the Prussians and the Pomeranians were once again rising their heads with greater stubborness and that after the calamitous rebellion had once again started, they tortured and killed his governors and starosts (...) Hurt by that heavy injustice the Polish prince flared up with such a rage, that to take revenge for unjust death of his knights and to smash the rebellion, with a small unit, but of very well trained soldiers - because shortage of time did not allow him for mobilizing a larger army - without hesitation in February he marched towards Pomerania. Dividing his forces for two parts, one under command of Sieciech, Voivode of Kraków and a military commander, on a rapid march he advanced back and forth across entire Pomerania and Prussia, ordering his soldiers to plunder and burn villages. He stayed there for almost entire period of the Lent [so until April], but fasting was not observed by his soldiers. After gathering a large number of captives, cattle and war booty, due to the fact that Pomeranians and Prussians were hiding inside forests or other inaccessible places and didn't fight back much, he decided to return to Poland. (...)\"\n\nEtc., etc., etc.\n\nDomen said:\n\nAnd then under year 1064 Jan Długosz has the following event:\n\n\"King of Poland defeats once again the rebelling and refusing to pay the agreed tribute Prussians, forcing them by war to pay it.\"\n\nAnd here more details about 1064:\n\n\"(...) Peace signed with Bohemia, was soon broken by war against Prussians. Because those barbarians not only rebelled against Poland once again and refused to pay the tribute which was regularly paid until that time, but also carried out frequent raids of Polish territory. And they constructed a border stronghold (...) and supplying it with a strong garrison, they continued to raid gradually more freely and farther, in order to harm the Poles and to plunder them. Rightly disturbed by this injustice, the Polish king besieged their stronghold. For a long time attempting to conquer it - as it was defended by its naturally defensible location and artificially constructed earthworks, and the Prussians were guarding it outstandingly - achieving nothing, he decided to abort the siege. (...) The king was thinking how to lure the Prussians into the open field, as they were avoiding pitched battles, limiting their actions to deceitful raids. Thus, entering Pomerania, the Polish king waited for arrival of the Prussians, as at that time they did not expect his invasion of their lands. And the king was not disappointed by his anticipations. Thanks to information provided by scouts, he found out, that the barbarians gathered large forces and that they made a stop... in order to, on the following day..., invade Polish frontiers, to sow destruction and robbery. The king, impatiently concerned about time, anxious that the barbarians after noticing his arrival could escape back to their hiding places in forests and swamps, known only to them - immediately advanced with his forces against the enemies. (...) Polish forces approach the enemies and without much effort slaughter them in an ambush while they are sleeping and defenceless, so that only a handful of Prussians, which in confusion managed to escape, retreated from invaded by them Pomerania and agreed to pay the appointed tribute to the Polish king in the future. (...)\"\n\n=======================\n\nDomen said:\n\nBut just one year later - in 1092 - there was another rebellion (despite all of preemptive measures applied in 1091):\n\n\"(...) Polish prince expected, that after smashing the rebellion of Prussians and Pomeranans he was going to breathe easy that year, but unexpectedly messangers came and told him that the Prussians and the Pomeranians were once again rising their heads with greater stubborness and that after the calamitous rebellion had once again started, they tortured and killed his governors and starosts (...)

(...)\"\n\nAnd finally in 1093, also this Prussian rebellion was smashed:\n\nUnder 1093 Długosz writes:\n\n\"(...) The Polish prince, gathering from all lands subjected to his power a mighty army consisting of horsemen and foot soldiers, returns back to Pomerania at the beginning of Summer. Not attempting to capture strongholds and forts, he plunders farms, crops and burns abandoned houses. Marching back and forth through entire Pomerania, he now turns against the Prussians, who previously provided help to Pomeranians. Plundering in similar way and destroying with burning fire the Prussian lands, he took a huge number of captives and cattle. Pomeranians and Prussians, losing during that invasion all of their property and estates which previously fueled their courage during rebellions, were to such an extent broken and humiliated, that they decided to send envoys to prince Władysław, and offered him their total submission and subordination, in exchange asking only for his forgiveness of their sins. Władysław replying to them in a kind-hearted way (...) ordered them and all of those who did not participate in the plot to hope for the best, and he demanded all of them to gather at his court in order to legitimize the reconciliation with their lord and natural heir. And when they finally gathered, he either executed or deported to other provinces of his realm all of the mutineers and conspirators, reprieving the rest of them. (...)\"\n\nHere is the Part about Prussians and Lithuanians.\n\nJan Dlugosz\n\n\"The Prussians are reputed to be a fierce, cruel people, immersed in idolatry and the worship of demons, so blind in their errors that they worship as gods the sun, moon and stars, as well as animals, birds and fire. They hold certain woods, lakes and streams sacred, and in those no man may hunt, fish or cut timber. They have their own language, which is partly derived from Latin and somewhat like the language of the Lithuanians, with whom they have various gods, ceremonies and festivals in common.\n\nThey have a high priest whose order must be scrupulously obeyed under penalty of death; he lives in the capital which is called Romowe, after Rome. The word for high priest in their language is Criwe.\n\nThe Prussians, Lithuanians and Samogitians have largely the same customs, language and origin.\n\nIt is said that at the time of the civil war between Cesar and Pompey they left their homes, wherever these were, and came to settle in these lands by the sea, where they now live.\n\nThey built their settlements deep in the forest, protected by rivers, lakes and swamps. Their pronunciation of words may differ, as it does in Polish, Czech and Ruthenia today, but otherwise their languages are similar in many respects. They do not consider that they have a common stem or language; in deed, the Prussians claim a quite different ancestry, for they will tell you that after the Carthaginians leader, Hannibal, was defeated by the Romans, he fled to the Bithynia and found refuge there. He persuaded Prussians, king of the Bithynians, to take up arms against the Romans on his behalf.\n\nThere was a pitched battle in which the Bithynians were soundly defeated, after which Prussians and most of his people fled to these northern shores where they now live, Prussians, giving his own name to their new country. Traces of these Bithynians are still to be found: indeed some Prussians are still able to speak their old language, to the extent that they can perfectly understand Aeolian, Dorian and Ionian Greek.\n\nThe Prussians buy their wives and make them work like slaves. They burn the bodies of the dead together with their horses, arms, clothing and other things dear to the hearts. Otherwise, they are by nature hospitable and friendly. They indulge in bouts of drunkenness, achieved, for wine is not known to them, by drinking fermented mare's milk, which is inebriating.\n\nThey do not consider that they have been sufficiently hospitable to a friend or guest until they see him well and truly intoxicated. Their womenfolk are as ardent topers as the men.\n\nPrussians can have an unlimited number of wives, just as many as each can afford to buy; consequently they do not respect them, but force them to perform the servile duties of slaves.\"\n\nHere is the Part about Prussians and Lithuanians.\n\nSome other parts from D&#322;ugosz (from 1st Book of his Annals - describing Ancient times):\n\n\"(...) Then comes the Northern Sea, which is sometimes called the Sarmatian Sea, because along its coasts the Sarmatians - that is the Poles - have their seats and cities: of them two are the finest ones, Lubeck (in Polish Bukowiec) and Gdansk, founded by Poles. (...)\"\n\n\"(...) The first man of the family of Japheth*, named Alan, came to Europe with three of his sons, whose names are: Isycon, Armenon, Negno. Isycon had four sons: Frank, Roman, Momaur and Brit, who was the first to name Britannia after himself and settled there. The second son of Alan - Armenon - had five sons: Soch, Valgot, Cebid, Burgund and Langobard. And the third son of Alan, Negno, was a father of four sons, and their names are: Vandal, from whose name called themselves the Vandals, who now call themselves the Poles (...)\"\n\n*Japheth, son of Noah.\n\nSo as you can see, according to D&#322;ugosz both Sarmatians and Vandals were Polish people.\n\nMost likely that&#8217;s why the sea is called Baltic = Bal &#8211; tic from Dece &#8211; Bal, Hani-Bal.\n\nUnfortunately for this theory, in Annals of Jan D&#322;ugosz this sea is called Northern Sea or Sarmatian Sea (see above).\n\nBaltic Sea is a more recent name of this sea - probably derived from the Baltic people (not inversely).\n\nIn Ancient times this sea was also not called \"Baltic\", but Scythian Sea, Sarmatian Sea, Northern Sea, etc.\n\nAnd let's continue the translation of this fragment:\n\nHere continuation:\n\n\"(...) third son of Alan, Negno, was a father of four sons, and their names are: Vandal, from whose name called themselves the Vandals, who now call themselves the Poles. (...) Second son of Negno was Nognons Targ, third was Saxo, fourth was Bogor. Thus from Isycon - first son of Alan - originated the Franks, the Romans, and other nations of the Latins and Allemanians. From second son of Alan originated the Goths and the Langobards. Finally from Negnon - third son - originated various nations across entire Europe, including: entire Rus up to its eastern edges, Poland the biggest of all lands, Pomeranians, Kashubs, nations of Sweden and Sarnia (which is now called Saxony) as well as Norway. From third son of Negnon, called Saxo, originated Czechia and Moravia, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola (now called Dalmatia), Lissa, Croatia, Serbia, Pannonia, Bulgaria and Eliza. (...)\"\n\nAbout the Baltic Sea\n\nWhile Tacitus called it Mare Suebicum[3] after the Germanic people of the Suebi, the first to name it also as the Baltic Sea (Mare Balticum) was eleventh-century German chronicler Adam of Bremen. The origin of the latter name is speculative. It might be connected to the Germanic word belt, a name used for two of the Danish straits, the Belts, while others claim it to be derived from Latin balteus (belt).[4]\n\n[ame=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea]Baltic Sea - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\n\"The first man of the family of Japheth\"\n\nWhen we go to the Bible interpretation of History I keep away from it for obvious reasons\n\nIt definitely transmits something but not clear at all."
