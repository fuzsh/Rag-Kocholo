My apologies to any other Hollywood Italians I might have omitted.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n\"E pluribus unum\" Latin motto on the Great Seal of the United States \"I am not Italian. I was born in Brooklyn.\" Statement attributed to Al Capone1 \"Everyone is Italian!\" Television advertisement for Fazoli's, the fast-food chain serving \"Italian\" food\n\nFor the better part of four decades, I have dedicated my professional life to the study of issues associated with the highbrow culture of medieval, Renaissance, and contemporary Italy. Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Cellini, Titian, Rossellini, Fellini are the names associated with my scholarship or my translations, and even though I have strayed from my original training in literature and political thought by devoting a good deal of time to Italian cinema, I have always been committed to figures and topics that are far removed from ethnic studies. My interest in Italian culture, however, has never been motivated by any desire to recover an Italian heritage lost through emigration to America. Although I have a vaguely Italian name (one that may have been spelled differently when my paternal grandfather arrived in this country from Sicily) and now teach in a graduate doctoral program offering advanced university degrees in Italian, my early ethnic, religious, and regional background was resolutely Scottish, Presbyterian, and Southern. When I attended what was then a staunchly Calvinist institution, Davidson College offered only one year of Italian upon demand when a professor of Spanish, Donald Tucker, could free himself to teach the course. From that wonderful language instructor, I was able to take only an intensive Spanish course the summer before I spent my junior year abroad in France, not Italy. Almost as an afterthought, I spent my second European summer living for several months with an Italian family in Rome and trying to teach myself Italian grammar with no more than a tattered copy of Speroni and Golino's Basic Italian as my guide. I lived in a Liberty building\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\non the Tiber River, about as far from the Sicilian countryside of my father's ancestors as one could get. Only at the University of Oregon in a Comparative Literature Program did I begin the serious study of Italian language and literature, inspired not by my ethnic background but by my interest in political theory, Machiavelli, and the Renaissance. My efforts to do so were encouraged by two generous and humane professors, Chandler Beall and Emmanuel Hatzantonis, both of whom provided models of Italianate erudition that have always remained to inspire me. When I am asked by Italians in Italy where my grandfather lived in Sicily, I always reply \"Corleone\" in order to watch the momentary and embarrassed astonishment on their faces. Thus, what ethnic roots I profess from Sicily are those I learned about from the movies—strictly Hollywood Italian origins, not authentically Italian American ones. I outline my background to emphasize that Hollywood Italians can make no experiential claims to a personal knowledge of the Italian American experience. And, as I said earlier, it is not motivated by a search for my ethnic \"roots,\" but rather by my work—a number of books and articles on Italian cinema—the cinema shot at Cinecittà in Rome rather than on the lots and studios of Hollywood. After years of examining how Italians represented themselves in their own national cinema, it seemed logical and appropriate to take a look at how Americans, some of them Italian Americans, represent the same group of people after they are transported to another culture and another country or, subsequently, after they grow up in that other culture and country. Curiosity and an admiration for a variety of these films motivated this choice, not a search for personal identity. The subtitle of the book (Dagos, Palookas, Romeos, Wise Guys, and Sopranos) makes it obvious that some of the images discussed are ethnic or racial stereotypes. The high-water mark of Italian emigration to America coincides roughly with the rise of the cinema industry in America, and the evolution of Hollywood Italian images reflects, to some extent, the ethnic prejudice against this particular ethnic or minority group. As many historians and sociologists have noted, Italians in this country were not initially considered Caucasian and were despised as even lower forms of humanity than their ill-treated black compatriots. Nonetheless, as true as such historical facts may be, they are insufficient grounds, in my opinion, to justify a serious examination of Hollywood Italians in the American cinema. Only Hollywood's interesting and cinematically significant representations of Italians throughout the history of American film art can do that. The history of Hollywood Italians seems to follow a course all its own. Although regrettable examples of ethnic prejudice may still occur at the\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nexpense of individual Americans of Italian descent, America has fallen in love with all things Italian. No longer the country where starving civilians pleaded for surplus Hershey bars from victorious American liberators, Americans now identify Italy with high-fashion products delivered by Armani, Ferragamo, Missoni, Prada, Zegna, and many other recognizably peninsular brand names, not with the scrubby, dirty, and illiterate day laborers, organ grinders, and shoeblacks of the beginning of the last century who were once so frequently depicted and disparaged in the popular imagination. People who once laughed at my father's family as \"spaghetti benders\" now argue about the merits of Super Tuscan vintages, balsamic vinegar from Modena, and make their own pesto or pasta fresca. Nothing is more chic than renting a villa in Tuscany. While almost all foreign languages except Spanish are in decline, Italian enrollments in American institutions of higher learning have remained remarkably stable and no longer depend upon students with names ending in a vowel. The number of Italian Americans who have become heads of corporations, important government officials, writers, and professionals is enormous and still growing, and many (but not all) of the \"Little Italies\" of the past century have long ago been transformed by moves to upscale suburbs and other dramatic demographic shifts. In many cases, they remain vividly recollected only in photographs, movies, and memory. Italian Americans have, by and large, assimilated into the American mainstream as much or even more than many other ethnic groups. And they have almost always done so not by claiming the status of victim, all too popular a means of gaining the attention of the press or the government in the facile multicultural politics of today, but by believing in the American dream: that hard work and education would ultimately result in progress, and economic betterment, and a place at the table, so to speak. The contemporary politics of multiculturalism disparages the myth of the \"melting pot,\" a term invented by Israel Zangwill—a member of another once despised minority—a Jew who was not even an American citizen. The phrase E pluribus unum means \"one out of many,\" a phrase that comes from one of a group of some ten pseudo-Vergilian poems in the Alexandrian style called the Appendix Vergiliana. One of these poems is called Moretum (meaning a kind of salad or hash). America's Founding Fathers probably mistakenly identified this Latin text as Vergilian, since as gentlemen farmers, they were so fond of Vergil's Georgics. The original line that suggested the motto on our Great Seal is actually color este pluribus unus (\"many colors blend into one\") and refers to the making of a salad with various ingredients and a pestle. 2 Perhaps rather than focusing upon the metaphor of the \"melting pot\"—an image\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nsuggesting that the individual identity of the various components being blended together is basically obliterated—we should return to the original Vergilian context of the term, which is more like the making of a stew, soup, or a salad than an alloy. In any good stew, soup, or salad, the different ingredients can always be identified; even while taken together, they create a unique taste different from that of any single ingredient. Moreover, taken together, the mixture produces something different from and better than the sum of the individual parts that go into the final dish. Today, Italian Americans certainly belong in the mainstream, but Hollywood Italians continue to stand out as a group in the Hollywood pantheon, remaining far more \"ethnic\" than their real counterparts. Most of the \"Little Italies\"3 on the silver screen have resisted the temptation to retire to the suburbs with greater tenacity than those actually in the metropolitan areas of the United States. Yet the currently most famous Hollywood Italians of the suburbs, the members of the New lersey Soprano family, share all the common preoccupations of the suburban soccer moms and businessmen commuters with whom they live, including sessions with a psychiatrist to cure their \"agita? Thus, the focus of this book is not upon the flesh-and-blood Italian Americans that one may encounter everywhere, but their surrogates, far fewer in number and more vivid in our collective imagination, that we encounter in the movies. In the movies, to a far greater extent than in our daily lives, these characters remain identifiable by their Hollywood representations not as Italian Americans but as \"Hollywood Italians.\" Here, they are predominantly but not exclusively from New York, and here they are frequently presented as gangsters, prizefighters, Latin lovers, and poor emigrants—not corporation presidents, mayors, or college professors. In their worst moments, they become identified with stereotypes based upon ethnic, religious, or racial prejudice. In their most sublime artistic representations, as in The Godfather trilogy or The Sopranos, they have captured the popular imagination and even the admiration of generations of Americans while providing Hollywood with some of its greatest folklore, its most moving narratives, as well as some of its most original personalities. Al Capone thought of himself as an American, not an Italian, and so, by the way, did Frank Capra, even though he, unlike the Chicago gangster, was born in Sicily. But Italian stereotypes have an interesting history. During the years immediately preceding World War II and while the conflict was being waged by the Fascist regime, Benito Mussolini used to disparage the United States as a mongrel nation populated by gangsters and Negro jazz\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nmusicians, both stereotyped images derived primarily from the movies. Yet, most Italians had relatives in the United States and no doubt took his statements with a large grain of salt. Mussolini's son Romano eventually became an accomplished jazz pianist despite his father's views, although he himself was probably not aware of the enormous contribution to the development of this \"black\" form of American music by musicians of Italian descent. The point is simple: people are generally more sophisticated about dealing with stereotypes in their cultures than is generally assumed or acknowledged. Although the Hollywood movies portraying Hollywood Italians may often be based on stereotypes, similar cultural depictions throughout history have likewise produced outstanding works of art. The best example in the English-speaking world is that of Elizabethan England and its lovehate relationship with the Italy of the Renaissance and the Reformation. 4 Hollywood cinema may fruitfully be compared to the Elizabethan theater and English culture generally in the way they regarded Italians of the Renaissance. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Europe, Italy represented a school for all sorts of new ideas, values, and artistic forms. Her universities were the envy of every other civilized country. Her art and literature flourished under the influence of humanistic encounters with a revived Classical tradition. Her political thought was the most original and energetic of any, especially that of Machiavelli, whose realistic and often shocking views on necessity and pragmatism in governmental affairs disturbed Northern European sensibilities, if not their political practice. It is not by accident that Shakespeare and other Elizabethan dramatists located so many of their works in the Italy of their day, since Italy represented the place where the intellectual and artistic action was, just as Paris was the focal point for European culture in the nineteenth century and Germany became the capital for European science shortly thereafter. Italy was also home to the Roman Catholic Church, engaged in territorial disputes within the peninsula and in a heated religious battle with dissenters and heretics of all kinds throughout Europe. Despite their pan-European connections, the dominant personalities managing the Vatican were almost always Italians. Arguably no political or dynastic history is bloodier than that of England, yet Elizabethans enjoyed placing perfidious counselors and courtiers, poisoners, and murderous adulterers in an Italian context, perhaps understanding that any direct criticism could be life threatening. \"Old Nick\"—a preexisting nickname for the devil—became that of Machiavelli, who was incorrectly identified with the unchristian notion that any means are justified by any ruler's ends. Scandalous rumors about the incestuous relationships within the Borgia\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nfamily—a pope, Alexander VI; his son, Cesare, Machiavelli's ideal prince; and his daughter, Lucrezia—were circulated by anti-Catholic and antiItalian polemicists in both Huguenot France and then Protestant England. All this culminated in a portrait of a nation whose culture embraced godless materialism, corruption in the church, unscrupulous and treacherous dealing wherein one's word could be broken without prejudice and cruelty devised and carried out by sadistic rulers. Obviously, a nation ruled by such figures as Mary Queen of Scots, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, and Oliver Cromwell needed no lessons in double-dealing or violence from their Mediterranean counterparts. Yet, besides becoming the School of Europe in the fine arts, literature, education, and general good manners during the Renaissance, an aspect of Italian culture that caused the peninsula to be the envy of the nation, Elizabethan and Renaissance England also regarded Italy with fear, suspicion, and prejudice inspired by religious, philosophical, and essentially racial differences. Italy became, in short, what is called in the academic world the \"Other\" for many writers and thinkers of the period—a fascinating world that drew people to it but also a siren's song that could easily destroy true religion and moral behavior. In many cases, the Italian characters that populated the Elizabethan imagination—Shakespeare's Iago or Shylock, Jonson's Volpone, and so many lesser figures—represented clearly stereotypical characters. Many of the most interesting characters created by such dramatists had Italian sources in Bandello, Boccaccio, Ariosto, or Cinthio. Yet, who would reject Shakespeare's Othello or The Merchant of Venice solely because the protagonists reflect difference? Hollywood Italians play a similar role in the American cinema. Produced by an industry that was shaped substantially by recent emigrants from the non-Mediterranean cultures of Central Europe, as Neal Gabier and others have shown, 5 cinematic representations of Hollywood Italians quite naturally embodied the ambivalent views of Italians that Americans of recent and much earlier vintage held of these new and colorful arrivals—they were different. Not surprisingly, they became in the American imagination a reflection of the Other. Yet, when these representations are examined carefully, they reveal a great deal of begrudging admiration, interest, and envy. Representations of Hollywood Italians are, in short, as complex as the new art form that depicted them and as multifaceted and fascinating as the very real flesh-and-blood emigrants who would, over several decades, become mayors of New York City (Fiorello La Guardia, Rudy Giuliani), idolized pop singers (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin), Hall of Fame baseball players (loe DiMaggio), as well as famous Wise Guys (Al\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nCapone, Lucky Luciano), fearless Palookas (Jake La Motta, Rocky Marciano), and seductive Romeos (Rudolph Valentino, Frank Sinatra, John Travolta). I have organized Hollywood Italians out of chronological or historical order. Since Hollywood films with Hollywood Italians have largely been genre pictures, the most obvious subcategories being that of Wise Guys, Romeos, and Palookas, the interesting developments in such representations often take place more within a genre than across generic or chronological boundaries. That is to say, one gangster film featuring protagonists of Italian descent may have far more to do with another similar gangster movie of an earlier era, to which it is artistically indebted, than with a film about a Hollywood Italian prizefighter or Latin lover that is its contemporary. And the history of that generic development through time may be more important to the history of the cinema than the interrelationships between different genres. This is most obviously true in the case of The Sopranos, a work best considered not as a television series but, rather, as a collection of films created by an auteur with complex scripts and production values that few television series have ever even attempted to equal. Moreover, The Sopranos reflects a postmodern fascination with its gangster-film ancestors and of Hollywood Italian Wise Guys that could only emerge from a very sure grasp of film history on the part of its creators. It is often said that the American cinema represents a fascinating chronicle of American history.6 Hence, it should be revealing to explore how American films have portrayed the basic experience of coming to America and living in an ethnic area, and how they have expressed the essential values nearly all commentators on Italian American life define as most important: those surrounding la famiglia.7 With that foundation, it is then possible to appreciate such figures as Palookas, Romeos, and Wise Guys (funny or not), and Sopranos that populate the Hollywood Italian universe. Acknowledgements I am grateful to Gian Piero Brunetta of the University of Padua for asking me to write an essay on Italian Americans in the Hollywood cinema that was the inspiration for this book. My thanks also go to Tulane University and my students in a seminar there on Hollywood Italians I offered at that institution as the Mellon Visiting Professor in the spring of 2000. A grant from the Department of French & Italian and from the Institute for the Arts and Humanities at Indiana University helped me procure photographic illustrations for this work. My manuscript has profited from a\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nclose and sympathetic reading by my old friend Harry Geduld, who has forgotten more about the Hollywood cinema than I shall ever learn. My wife Julia also read the manuscript carefully and, once again, saved me from any number of stylistic blunders. Finally, I owe a huge debt of gratitude to my peerless editor, Evander Lomke, who knows every line of the Godfather trilogy by heart.\n\n1 •\n\nD a g o s :\n\n*\n\n•\n\nH o l l y w o o d\n\nH i s t o r i e s\n\nI m m i g r a t i o n , a n d from\n\nthe\n\nL i t t l e Silent\n\nEra\n\no f\n\nLafamlgLia, I t a l i e to the\n\ns Present\n\n\"Ain't nothing but trash, every one of them... dago... greasy wop... we don't need your kind ...\" The citizens of New Orleans (voice-over opening of Vendetta)1 \"Common labor, white $1.30 to $1.50.

In fact, the early emigrants to America from Italy had been primarily\n\n18\n\nHollywood Italians\n\npolitical refugees and middle-class professionals, who experienced little ethnic prejudice. Yet, in only a few decades after the opening of Ellis Island in the harbor of New York City on January 1,1892, millions of Italians, mostly from the Mezzogiorno—the South of Italy—had crossed the Atlantic and come to the United States to begin a new life. And, of course, faced with the personal, cultural, political, and economic characteristics of this very different group of Italians, American attitudes toward them changed drastically. The volume of the traffic was intense, but not everyone discovered his or her fortune in America. In fact, between 1880 and 1924, fewer than half of the 4.5 million Italians who came to America remained. 5 Italian emigration has always been identified with New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, and other predominantly eastern cities, but there were substantial populations of Italians who came to the South, particularly through the thriving port city of New Orleans. In Louisiana after the departure of many ex-slaves to the North had created a labor shortage, Louisiana began to encourage the arrival of Italian workers, even employing advertisements bragging about the Mediterranean quality of life in the region. In almost no time, the farming knowledge and the entrepreneurial skills of the Italian emigrants led them to successful ventures in the vegetable and fruit markets of the city. The famous French Market that is today the Mecca of tourists actually became an Italian market, and much of the French Quarter, particularly around Decatur Street, became a Little Italy. Italians found work on the docks of the booming harbor, while other farm laborers worked in strawberry fields in the countryside or the sugarcane fields.6 Visitors to the city and state today are often surprised both by the number of Italian names on New Orleans stores, shops, and businesses, and by the large number of Italian names encountered, now primarily in the suburbs around Métairie, that only serve to emphasize the early massive presence of this group of emigrants, most of whom were Sicilians. New Orleans is the setting for the film Vendetta (1999), a relatively highbudget film shot for Home Box Office, which has also produced The Sopranos. This accurate and compelling adaptation of Richard Gambino's book, entitled Vendetta, narrates the chilling account of America's largest lynching as it took place in New Orleans on March 14,1891. Its victims were not African Americans, as most might expect, but, rather, eleven Italian Americans who had just been acquitted of the crime of murder or who would soon be tried for the same crime but would undoubtedly have been found innocent of the crime for which their compatriots had just been acquitted. The event sparked a wave of anti-Italian emotions all over America, which provoked a grave political crisis between the United States and Italy, and the prejudice that emerged from the lynching, which was widely discussed\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n19\n\nin American papers and magazines for some time after the event, was to a great extent responsible for the ongoing identification of Italian American emigrants with lawlessness and the Mafia.7 Vendetta treats the problems associated with Italian emigration to the South in the late nineteenth century, and although films about Italian gangsters are treated in another chapter, the connection between Italians and the Mafia so indelibly etched in the American imagination was born in the aftermath of the event dramatized in this film. When the American cinema soon afterward began to portray various kinds of emigrants arriving in the urban centers of the North in numerous brief films dating from as early as the first decade of the twentieth century, the association of Italian emigrants with the Mafia had already been made and was assumed to be true. Hollywood merely looked to the popular press for its subject matter. Nicolas Meyer's direction of Vendetta creates a well-crafted film with seamless editing, numerous establishing shots, a Hollywood love interest between a young emigrant who is arrested but escapes lynching (Gaspare Marchesi, the son of Antonio Marchesi who was lynched) and an Irish girl named Meagan. Grainy photographs of impoverished and emaciated Italian emigrants arriving at the port of New Orleans open the film and an intertitle warns us that the film is a faithful recording of history, BASED ON A TRUE STORY is the film's first frame. The cast is excellent. Christopher Walken plays James Houston, the villainous Southern racist whose plot to take over the docks and the fruit trade from an Italian businessman, Joseph Macheca (Joaquim de Almeida), leads to the assassination of the local sheriff, Chief Hennesy (Clancy Brown), who has refused to use the law against the Italians unless there is some proof of their criminal activity. Four men murder Hennesy at night in the Italian section of town, and rumor spreads that his last words were: \"The dagos did it.\" Houston, the mayor of the city, and a group of prominent businessmen associated with the power elite of the old South called the Committee of Fifty, chaired at one time by Edgar H. Farrar of the Board of Trustees of Tulane University, all apparently conspired to rid the city of the rising economic power of the Italians,8 who had by the time of the lynching gained control of most of the docks and most of the vegetable and fruit trade in the city. Subsequent to the lynching, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance on April 25,1892, that was aimed at destroying any Italian commercial presence on the docks, giving control of them to the new Louisiana Construction and Improvement Corporation, one of whose principals was none other than James Houston, who engineered the lynching. Moreover, another ordinance attempted to block Italian longshoremen from further work on the docks by giving that privilege to a union made up of white and black men\n\n20\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nbut excluding Italians. When Italian longshoremen and prominent Italian businessmen protested, Mayor Shakspeare addressed them on May 16, 1891—only four months after the lynchings—in the following tone: I and every other decent citizen am disgusted with the Dago disturbances and determined that they shall end immediately.... You have not learned the lesson taught your race by the people of New-Orleans, it seems, and I want you when you leave here to go home and tell your friends that if you make any more trouble, the police and Mayor of this city will not consider themselves responsible for the loss of you and yours. . . . I intend to put an end to these infernal Dago disturbances, even if it proves necessary to wipe every one of you from the face of the earth. 9 The shockingly racist tone of the speech perfectly reflects the attitude of the power elite of New Orleans who felt threatened by the rising economic importance of a group they despised not just as a different ethnic group but also as a different race. Vendetta is most persuasive as a historical reconstruction of this pivotal event in Italian American history when it reproduces, often verbatim, the statements of the historical characters involved in the script. Moreover, the relaxed norms against the graphic depiction of violence on the screen in the particular case of this film allow the shocking nature of the lynchings and the merciless racial killings of the Italian American victims to be vividly portrayed. The irony of the film, of course, is that Joseph Macheca—the most prominent and wealthy of the Italian American businessmen—was born in America and fought in the Civil War on the Union side to prevent just such racist treatment of African-American slaves. Like Al Capone, Macheca was a domestic Italian, not an imported one. Vendetta will never rank at the top of anyone's list of memorable representations of Italian Americans. But like so many Hollywood films about the phght of blacks in a racist society, Vendetta reminds America of the kind of obstacles Italian Americans had to overcome in order to be considered \"white\" and worthy of being assimilated into the American dream. The Hollywood Italians depicted in it are unique: they are almost the contemporaries of the figures depicted in the early era of the silent cinema, the poor emigrants in the urban ghettos of the North who were soon to be the focus of a number of popular movies. Unlike the Hollywood Italians of the early silent cinema, however, their representations are refracted through an entire century of social change in America. The purpose behind the style of their representation is to redress a wrong committed a century ago, something\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n21\n\nvery far from the minds of early directors of silent cinema. In Vendetta, Mayor Shakspeare and James Houston frequently pronounce the word \"Mafia\" incorrectly—placing the stress on the last syllable rather than the first, as everyone has since learned to do. The nefarious association between poor Italian American emigrants and organized crime the New Orleans lynching did so much to effect would continue long after Americans learned to pronounce the word correctly. Vendetta is an important movie because it sets out to reverse a century of negative images. The Silent Cinema Depicts the New\n\nArrivals\n\nThe mass arrival of Italians to American shores coincided almost exactly with the invention and growth of the cinema. An impressive number of works treating Hollywood Italians appeared during the early days of the silent cinema.10 Unfortunately, few of these films are on video or DVD formats. Without access to archives or research libraries, the movie-going public is largely cut off from access to these fascinating documents of the ways of visualizing early Hollywood Italians. D. W. Griffith (1875-1948), perhaps the greatest of all American directors in this period, did a number of Biograph pictures between 1907 and 1913 with Italian stories, including The Greaser's Gauntlet (1908), In Little Italy (1909), The Violin Maker of Cremona (1909), and Pippa Passes (1909)—a transposition of the Browning poem of the same name to the United States. His Italian Blood (1911) portrays a hot-blooded and jealous husband who is almost driven by his wife to murder his own children. Although The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912), Griffith's film about gangsters in the cities, does not identify the criminals with any specific ethnic group, it helped to establish the popularity of a genre that had already been linked to Hollywood Italians even before Griffith. Griffith's At the Altar (1909) employs another Hollywood Italian stereotype—the jealous, irrational, and vindictive Italian lover who attempts to get revenge upon another man who is successful in love. Another of his works, In Life's Cycle (1910), focuses on a brother and sister: the man becomes a priest, while the woman is seduced and abandoned by a fickle lover, resulting in an illegitimate child. Even when sympathetic to Hollywood Italian subjects, these early films embrace a stereotype of the Italian as a creature controlled by emotions and passions, a stereotype obviously indebted to Elizabethan drama, grand opera, and the sentimental theater of the nineteenth century. Still, a number of these films shed some light on the problems Italian emigrants encountered when they reached America. Works such as Pasquale (1916; William D. Taylor, director); A Roadside Impresario (1917; Donald Crisp,\n\n22\n\nHollywood Italians\n\ndirector); The Ordeal of Rosetta (1918; Emile Chautard, director); Tony America (1918; Thomas N. Heffron, director); Society Snobs (1921; Hobart Henley, director); Puppets of Fate (1921; Dallas M. Fitzgerald, director); Little Italy (1921; George Terwillinger, director); and The Man in Blue (1925; Edward Laemmle, director) depict the conflict that may arise when members of different ethnic groups fall in love or marry. Many of these films employ scenes set in Italy itself and often depict the immigration of the principal characters to New York City or other urban centers in the East. The most common connections between ethnic groups are, not surprisingly, given their common religion, between Italians and the Irish. Head Over Heels (1922, Victor Schertzinger, director), for example, examines the trials and tribulations of an Italian girl as she tries to assimilate into New York's WASP culture. Rose of the Tenements ( 1926; Phil Rosen, director), produced by Joseph Kennedy, Sr., the father of the future president, presents three different ethnic groups. Rose, an Italian flower girl, is the orphan of a deceased Italian gangster (again the Mafia raises its ugly role in stories about immigration). She is reared by a Jewish couple along with an Irish-American boy named Danny, with whom she falls in love and eventually marries after he has a brief encounter with political activism, during which he is falsely accused of being a bomb-throwing Bolshevik.\" After the development of the early star system in the silent cinema, several Hollywood films cast popular leading actors as Italians in Italy (not Little Italy). Ronald Colman and Lillian Gish starred in The White Sister (1923; Henry King, director), a melodramatic account of an Italian noblewoman who is defrauded of her inheritance and becomes a nun. Victor Fleming remade it in 1933 with Clark Gable and Helen Hayes. In The Wages of Virtue (1924), Gloria Swanson must choose between the Italian who has saved her from drowning and an American. She prefers the latter. Regardless of the locale of such films, they associate Italy itself—like Little Italy—with passion, romance, and potential violence.\n\nT h e Italian (1915) and the Hollywood Immigrant Experience\n\nItalian\n\nHistorians are unanimous in praising The Italian (1915; Reginald Barker, director) for its complex portrayal of the Italian immigrant. The wellknown dramatic actor George Beban stars as Beppo Donnetti, who comes to New York to seek his fortune and make a new life for his wife and child. The legendary Thomas Ince (1882-1924) produced the film. Ince's work is renowned for careful construction, well-crafted scripts, and sophisticated production values. Originally entitled The Dago, its title was apparently\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n23\n\nchanged at Beban's request: his career reflects a sincere interest in immigrants, and in their representation in theater and film. Only a few years later, he played the lead in another immigrant film about Italians, One More American (1918; William De Mille, director), the story of the conflict between an Italian and an Irish ward boss who attempts to keep the Italian's family from entering Ellis Island but who is eventually foiled at the last minute. 12 A number of aesthetic elements sets The Italian apart from the other films treating the Italian immigrant experience. In the first place, this is a feature film (six reels), not a one- or two-reeler. Its melodramatic plot reflects a serious sense of artistic construction, aimed at milking the last bit of emotion out of the audience. George Beban's outstanding performance shows his roots in the dramatic theater. The settings are also interesting, even if not realistic by today's standards. Finally, the depiction of the tragic story of Beppo shows a certain sympathy for the character of the poor Italian bootblack but also includes a callous disregard for depicting Italian immigrants in a stereotypical manner, an attitude that no doubt reflected the opinions of the majority of Americans at the time. Its plot is simple and compelling. Beppo Donnetti is a Venetian gondolier who falls in love with Annette Ancello, goes to New York to make their fortune, and brings her to marry him when he has earned enough money as a bootblack. While in New York, he encounters an Irish ward boss, Big Bill Corrigan, who pays him the money he needs to send for Annette if he will help garner the Italian vote for his candidate, Alderman John H. Casey. As the intertitle puts it, Corrigan says: HERE'S A LITTLE PRESENT FOR YOU. HAVE YOUR WOP FRIENDS VOTE FOR THIS GUY. Annette arrives,\n\nand they soon have a son named Tony, but a heat wave causes their son to contract an illness (probably yellow fever or cholera, a typical disease of the urban ghettos), and the doctor sends Beppo for pasteurized milk, without which the baby will die. On his way to buy the milk, two non-Italians rob Beppo, and when he sees them later and attacks them, he ends up in jail after Corrigan refuses to help him. We can only imagine what the Irishman said about lawless Italians, since there is, of course, no sound track, but the impressive action shot depicting Beppo dragged along by Corrigan's car represents one of the high points of the film with the complexity of its photography. While he is in jail, his son dies, and Beppo plans a vendetta against Corrigan, whose daughter is also ill. But when he sees the little girl in her crib and recognizes, as the sentimental intertitle puts it, THE GESTURE THAT WAS LITTLE TONY'S is the same as that of Cor-\n\nrigan's daughter, his anger subsides, and later he is seen mourning over the grave of his lost son.\n\n24\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nThe Italian (1915; Reginald Barker, director).

Reproduced from the Collections of the Library of Congress.\n\nThe viewer is struck by a number of interesting features in this film. It opens and closes with George Beban wearing a smoking jacket and holding a pipe, in what is obviously an upper-class living room. He picks up a book that is entitled \"The Italian by Thomas H. Ince and C. G. Sullivan\" and begins to read it, as the film fades to the monastery mentioned in the first paragraph of the book. At the close of the film, when Beppo is placing flowers on his son's grave, we return to Beban closing his book, obviously moved by the story he has read, while curtains are drawn over the last frame in imitation of the closure of a play, thus reminding us that Beban is a dramatic actor. Why employ such a strange parenthesis to enclose the narrative? One obvious explanation is to convey that Beban is a legitimate theatrical performer. According to accounts of the making of this movie, Beban had to be practically coerced into taking the part and demanded a salary for his work quite out of line with payments for film actors. Clearly he wanted to protect his reputation. Since we know that Beban insisted on changing the title of the film from The Dago to The Italian and also acted in the previously mentioned One More American, another major film on\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n25\n\nThe Italian (1915; Reginald Barker, director). Beppo (George Beban) as a bootblack in New York City. From Library of Congress Film Stills Archive. Reproduced from the Collections of the Library of Congress.\n\nItalian immigration, it is also likely that he felt sympathy for oppressed immigrants. By showing that a blue-blooded aristocrat in a silken smoking jacket could be moved by Beppo's story, Beban clearly takes the side of the unfortunate Italian gondolier. Other aspects of the film are worth noting. The Venice scene was shot in Venice, California (and therefore was relatively convincing), while the New York City scenes are shot in San Francisco. There are, however, the peddlers, the open fire hydrants during the heat wave, and the urban bustle we have come to associate with New York scenes at the turn of the century. Some of the Italian features of the film are less persuasive. Beppo may be a gondolier, but his costume, and those of the peasants shown in the opening scenes of the film, clearly come from Southern Italy. Beban supposedly bought his costume from a Sicilian immigrant, so this may not be surprising. Certainly Ince and his director could tell little difference between a Venetian and a Sicilian. Nonetheless, the intertitles reflecting conversations spoken by Beppo actually mimic the kind of Pidgin English that would have been spoken by Italian immigrants. When he sees his son for the first\n\n26\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nThe Italian (1915; Reginald Barker, director). The Italian as a creature of emotions— Beppo (George Beban) pictured in close-up as a wild animal over the injustice of his daughter's death. From Library of Congress Film Stills Archive.

When he tries to save his son, he is made to say: i MUST GET-A-DE-MILK OR MY BABEE IS DIE. I prefer to believe\n\nthat this kind of language is employed in a search for linguistic realism, not to belittle the character. Moreover, a letter written to Annette to bring her to America displays perfectly correct Italian (for a man who is not university educated) before the audience sees the English translation, thereby emphasizing the production's desire for accuracy. Despite making obvious mistakes, Beppo clearly represents a character worthy of pity and respect. The melodramatic plot obviously aims at moving the audience's emotions, not unlike the many other tearjerkers of the silent cinema. Silent films are notoriously difficult to present to modern audiences, but even the most cynical spectators may be moved by Beppo's plight. This is one silent movie with real staying power. Beppo's portrayal in The Italian certainly contains many of the elements that characterized the superstition, prejudice, ignorance, and lack of empathy on the part of Americans of the period who viewed the great Italian\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n27\n\nThe Italian. Beppo dragged by a car, one of the most complex sequences in the film. From Library of Congress Film Stills Archive. Reproduced from the Collections of the Library of Congress. influx into the United States with a jaundiced eye. After all, even Ince, who produced the film, originally called it The Dago, and the Irish ward boss's attitude in the film denigrating Italians as wops is far from unusual. Unlike Vendetta, which has a century of social change behind it, including the contemporary multicultural attitude that all ethnic groups are victims, and which clearly sides with the embattled Italian immigrants in New Orleans, The Italian pictures the plight of Beppo from the outside—with compassion and pity but from a slightly patronizing position that is clearly superior to its subject matter. Like so many of his compatriots, Beppo embodies the perceived Italian penchant for the vendetta, and no amount of Americanization—symbolized in the film by the shaving of the omnipresent Italian American black mustache after Beppo arrives in New York City—seems to diminish this almost universal stereotype. But the figure is represented with great dignity and even comic twists, making Beppo a far more lovable figure than we might expect. So much in love with his future wife that he daydreams while poling his gondola in Venice, he runs into a bridge, knocking himself into the canal. Later in New York, when his son is born, he is so excited that he runs into a peddler, who seems to be a Jewish merchant of\n\n28\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nEastern European origin, creating a chaotic scene outside his tenement. When the angry peddler and the crowd that has gathered to support him learn that Beppo has become a father, they all become friendly, and Beppo stands them all to drinks at the local bar. In short, what emerges from The Italian is an unusually complex view of tenement life and multiethnic immigration in America, and the film consequently retains its value not only as social history but also as a work of art. A n i m a l Crackers (1930)\n\nand Ethnic\n\nHumor\n\nIn fashioning a history of Italian immigration in America through the cinema, the amusing contribution of Chico Marx and the Marx Brothers' films cannot be ignored, even though they are in no way intended to be realistic. Leonardo \"Chico\" Marx (1887-1961) made a career out of imitating Italian American accents in his comic films. His screen name Chico seems vaguely Italian but apparently derived from the result of a typo in the spelling of his real nickname \"Chicko,\" referring to his passion for beautiful women (\"chicks\"). The error was never corrected after the actor realized that the new spelling was most appropriate to his screen persona. The characters Chico portrayed in a series of zany comedies—Chico in Monkey Business (1931), Baravelli in Horse Feathers (1932), Chicolini in Duck Soup (1933), and Fiorello in A Night at the Opera (1935)—all have in common representations of Italian ethnicity, but the classic example of this type of ethnic-comic character may be seen in Animal Crackers (1930; Victor Heerman, director), with Chico playing the role of Signor Emanuel Ravelli, a musician hired to perform at a reception given by a wealthy socialite, Mrs. Rittenhouse (Margaret Dumont), for an African explorer named Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding (Groucho Marx). A rich art dealer, Roscoe Chandler (Louis Sorin), brings an expensive painting to present to the party, Beaugard's After the Hunt. During the party, Ravelli performs a number of comic routines involving linguistic mistakes, malapropisms, and generally off-the-wall one-liners, his Italian accent appearing when most useful comically and then disappearing whenever not needed. First-generation Jews and Italians, not to mention other linguistic and ethnic groups, grew up alongside each other in New York's Lower East Side tenements, and as Charles Musser has rightly noted, living there was a constant struggle to understand different accents, languages, pronunciations: first-generation immigrants might never get the hang of it, but their children's ears would be more attuned to the meanings, and therefore the comic possibilities, of such wordplay in dramatic or film dialogue.13 In Animal Crackers, the comic force of the film comes not just\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n29\n\nfrom Chico's pseudo-Italian American dialogue but also from the fact that characters such as Spaulding and Ravelli are obviously Jews pretending to be something else—in Spaulding's case, a WASP explorer, in Ravelli's case an Italian musician whose name recalls that of the French composer Ravel and which Mrs. Rittenhouse confuses with ravioli. This role playing lies at the core of the film. Suspecting that Mr. Chandler, the art collector, is a fake, Ravelli recognizes him from a birthmark on the arm as Abe Cabibble, a fish seller from Prague, who is obviously yet another Jew passing himself off as a WASP in high society. When Ravelli asks how Chandler managed to transform himself from Cabibble to Chandler (\"How did you get to be Roscoe W Chandler?\"), Chandler/Cabibble replies: \"Say, how did you get to be an Italian?\" Not only for Chandler but for the audience as well, Ravelli deflects the pertinent question with the remark: \"Never mind. Whose confession is this?\" The characters in Animal Crackers, not just the Jewish-Italian Ravelli but each of the other Marx Brothers, parody stereotypes associated with ethnic groups—the dominant WASP culture, the Jewish culture producing the anarchic humor of the film, and the Italian immigrant whose linguistic routines pay homage to their common origins in the tenements of the Lower East Side. Nothing about these images pretends to be even remotely associated with a realistic portrayal of life in the urban ghettos from which they originate, but their comic send-ups of social role playing surely indicate the heightened awareness members of ethnic groups had about the role language and stereotypes may play. Animal Crackers, in particular, embodies a democratic comic spirit in its undermining of society's barrier between different ethnic groups. After all, if three Jews can pretend to be African explorers, WASP art collectors, and Italian musicians, just how meaningful is ethnic identity? If ethnic identity can be assumed and put on or taken off like a dinner jacket, perhaps much of society's preoccupation with social rankings and appearances matters very little in the long run.\n\nThe Great Depreddion and Hollywood Christ in Concrete (1949)\n\nItalian\n\nLaborers:\n\nChrist in Concrete, a novel by Italian American bricklayer and writer Pietro Di Donato (1911-92), remains for many historians of the Italian American experience the \"prototypical 'ethnic' novel.\"14 Relegated to the category of proletarian novel, ethnic novel, or even Italian American novel, Di Donato's masterpiece bested John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath in a selection by the Book-of-the-Month Club in 1939, when both novels appeared. Christ in Concrete began as a prize-winning short story, a narrative that eventually became the first chapter of the novel. Its adaptation by director\n\n30\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nEdward Dmytryk may arguably be an improvement on what is a fine novel, although it languished for many years in storage without being distributed.15 A masterpiece, Christ in Concrete is also one of the few Hollywood films treating the subject of the Italian American worker with dignity, infusing its protagonist with a tragic grandeur and complexity worthy of great drama. It also depicts quite believably the difficulties Italian workers faced in the building trades, one of the major occupations in which they made important and lasting contributions to the building of the urban spaces they inhabited. One of the few American films to depict people at work, Christ in Concrete also offers one of the first Hollywood representations of Italian Americans that reflect the influence of Italian cinema—specifically, the postwar neorealist film. It was produced as a B movie with a brief shooting schedule (60 days) and a low budget ($500,000). Its producer, Ron Geiger, had been responsible for the distribution of Roberto Rossellini's Open City (1945) and Paisan ( 1946). Most likely, Geiger envisioned Dmytryk's film as a means of cashing in on what he perceived to be a relatively small but profitable market for starkly realistic films with ethnic Italian themes in the wake of the popular works of Rossellini, De Sica, and other Italian directors. Initially, Geiger may have considered Rossellini to direct the adaptation of Di Donato's novel. Dmytryk cast an Italian actress, Lea Padovani, as Annunziata, the wife of the Italian mason and construction worker Geremio (Sam Wanamaker), who is the film's protagonist. Although always notoriously unwilling to acknowledge any influence on his work from other directors or films, Dmytryk admits in his memoir: \"I had seen a young player perform exceptionally well in an obscure Italian film. Her name was Lea Padovani.\"16 It is virtually certain that the film Dmytryk mentions is // sole sorge ancora (1946, released as Outcry) by Aldo Vergano (1891-1957). It would have been almost impossible for Dmytryk, one of Hollywood's most talented Bfilm directors, to ignore Italian neorealism or German Expressionism, each of which influences certain aspects of the cinematic style of the film. Born of emigrant parents from the Ukraine, Dmytryk himself ranked among the Hollywood leftists eventually cited for contempt by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. At the very time Christ in Concrete received the Premio Pasinetti at the ninth Venice Biennale Film Festival, Dmytryk was serving a prison sentence as one of the Hollywood Ten. Because he eventually \"named names\" and was removed from the blacklist, he was, like director Elia Kazan, never forgiven by many Hollywood activists and fellow travelers. During the production in England, both lead actor Sam Wanamaker and scriptwriter Ben Barzman were essentially in exile from America as a result of their leftist or Communist affiliations, and subsequent\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n31\n\nChrist in Concrete (1949; Edward Dmytryk, director). Geremio (Sam Wanamaker) and Annunziata (Lea Padovani) celebrate their wedding day as the Italian immigrants assemble for a traditional Italian festival together.\n\ninvestigation by the House committee. These key individuals, all of whom had obvious ideological pretensions in their art, shared a great many general political and social beliefs with many of the leftist directors in Italy, such as Vergano or Visconti, who played an important part in the neorealist movement. Christ in Concrete was distributed in Italy after the Venice festival as Cristofra i muratori (literally \"Christ among the brickmasons\"), and the Italian print suppressed the initial opening scenes of the work, transforming the picture into a more clearly chronological movie rather than emphasizing its flashback—all more typical of American film noir under the influence of German Expressionism. The Italian print was thus closer in spirit to neorealist narrative than the original American version, and it is no surprise that contemporary critics such as Guido Aristarco, Alberto Moravia, Henri Agel, Giorgio Moscon, and Amedée Ayfré,17 all of whom contributed in significant ways to reviewing and popularizing neorealist films in Italy, praised Dmytryk's work. Christ in Concrete adapts only \"Geremio,\" the first of five sections that make up the original novel. Its ideological message clearly reflects the leftist\n\n32\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nleanings of its makers, and in no other American film of the period is the dignity of manual labor so strongly championed. A belief in the dignity and nobility of manual labor, one of the principal characteristics of Italian American men, has been so integral a part of the Italian American experience that it has often been blamed for the failure of Italian Americans, especially in the first half of the twentieth century, to take full advantage of higher education as a means for rising into the middle class, as other ethnics, the Jews in particular, have done so successfully. Geremio's story unfolds in a long flashback that takes up most of the screen time. The film opens, however, with a brilliant sequence that is almost a classic textbook demonstration of film noir style: the steaming manhole covers so familiar to viewers of films set in New York City are faithfully reproduced in the English studio, not on location; the strange and threatening angles of the tall buildings symbolize Geremio's drunkenness; the flashback that follows the opening sequence structures the entire film and undercuts the strictly chronological order of the narrative favored by Italian neorealists but popularized by the inheritors of German Expressionist style who produced Hollywood's B movies. Before we learn of Geremio's story in the flashback, Dmytryk uses Kathleen (a figure not found in the original novel) to juxtapose Geremio's Italian American ethnic heritage to his desire to achieve assimilation as an American ethnic. Kathleen is played by Kathleen Ryan, a member of Ireland's Abbey Theatre, whose brogue is unmistakable in Christ in Concrete. Kathleen represents the ever-present temptation to assimilate, to purchase the American Dream at the price of losing one's ethnic identity. Viewing manual labor as less than \"respectable,\" she would obviously rather have a husband or a lover who clerks in a grocery store or sells shoes—a white-collar occupation at all costs, even at lower wages. Geremio's wife Annunziata remains fanatically attached to the idea of buying her own house much as Beppo's wife in The Italian, who would not permit herself to be brought to America until Beppo had a place of his own in which to welcome her. Her fanatic need for this home drives Geremio to overwork and eventually, although indirectly, causes his death and the death of all his comrades. Besides the clash of cultures revealed in the juxtaposition of the Irish American Kathleen and the very Italian Annunziata who, unlike Geremio, seems to have no desire to become Americanized, a second and even more important confrontation in the film departs drastically from the novel. Geremio's eventual death, buried in the wet concrete of a construction project that is flawed by too little protection for the workers he supervises, seems to be determined less by blind fate or an inscrutable divine plan than as political retribu-\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n33\n\ntion for his ultimate betrayal, not so much of his wife and family but his proletarian comrades at the infamous \"job.\" Dmytryk's ideological message derives from his portrayal of Geremio's relations to the other Italian workers on the construction site. After the supervisor Murdin offers $100 to the fastest bricklayer, Geremio must choose between the temptation to take all of the money as a single, individual worker (the path of bourgeois individualism) and the ideal of proletarian solidarity, working as a team and dividing the prize money between the five comrades who function, as the men describe it, as five sticks in a bundle. In this instance, Geremio stifles his baser capitalist instincts and works for the common good. When the Great Depression of 1929 destroys the prosperity of the construction industry, Geremio begins to change. In addition, we see some disastrous consequences of the failure of American capitalism, the driving force behind the Italian dream of paved streets of gold in America. A pathetic scene, not unlike a later equally moving scene in De Sica's neorealist classic Umberto D ( Umberto D., 1951), shows Geremio in an encounter with a friend begging outside a shop window. To emphasize the destructive force of purchasing the house, Dmytryk invents another ethnic character not found in the novel, an older Slavic immigrant named laroslav, who agrees to let Geremio and Annunziata pay for the house on long-term credit when he could more easily sell it to someone with the cash to purchase it immediately. Geremio's greatest sin is his entrance into the higher echelons of the construction industry. loining the ranks of the padroni, he becomes foreman of Murdin's dangerous demolition project, ultimately sacrificing the safety of his friends. Now he is even forced to eat alone, setting himself off physically as well as ideologically from his former comrades. In the movie, unlike the novel, Geremio first breaks faith with his fellow workers; later he betrays his marriage as well. But both his affair with Kathleen and his work as a foreman reflect his refusal of proletarian solidarity with his friends. Geremio is allowed the opportunity to confess his sins to his comrades on Good Friday (an appropriate day for contrition), and the moving speech he delivers to his fellow workers causes them to accept him back into their company with the simple humanity of the Italian working class. Turning his back on the padroni comes too late, however, and he dies as a working-class figure of Christ, or as one perceptive critic noted, as a modern Job, whose destiny remains tragic but as obscure as that of the biblical patriarch. His horrible death, drowned in a set of wet concrete with his arms outstretched reminiscent of Jesus on the cross, emphasizes the bittersweet reality of the American Dream for so many of his compatriots.\n\n34\n\nHollywood Italians\n\n*\n\n»•*,*! $f*\n\n*\n\n'\n\n•\n\n*\n\n-\n\n%\n\n' • * •\n\nLi.\n\nChrist in Concrete (1949; Edward Dmytryk, director).

Geremio is a figure worthy of comparison to Arthur Miller's Willy Loman,\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n35\n\nand his death, like Loman's, represents a modern American capitalist version of a classical tragic hero. F r o m H e r e t o E t e r n i t y (1953): Hollywood Eve of the Attack on Pearl Harbor\n\nItalians\n\non the\n\nDirector Fred Zinnemann's adaptation of James Jones's best-selling novel From Here to Eternity (1951) received thirteen Oscar nominations, won eight awards, and relaunched the entertainment career of Frank Sinatra (1915-98), whose popularity as a singer had begun to wane before he reinvented himself as a Vegas entertainer in the 1960s. Rumored maneuvers necessary for Sinatra to land the role produced another great episode in Italian American cinema: the character of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) in The Godfather (1972), an Italian American singer and godson of the Mafia boss who lands a similarly coveted role in a film and salvages his career through the famous expedient of the bloody horse's head under the producer's silk sheets. From Here to Eternity., Jones's Thin Red Line (1961), Norman Mailer's Naked and the Dead (1948), and Joseph Heller's Catch-22 (1961)—among the best known of the American novels treating World War II to have been written by authors who actually served in the conflict— are all characterized by a visceral distaste for the regimentation, erasure of individuality, and mindlessness the authors perceived in military life. The title of Heller's book has itself become a proverbial shorthand expression for absurd situations with no solution. From Here to Eternity contains so many controversial topics (prostitution, illicit sexual encounters, cruelty and sadism in the armed forces) that many American filmmakers at the time felt it would be difficult to adapt the novel for the screen without running afoul of the censors. A second-rate company commander, Captain Dana Holmes (Philip Ober), seems more interested in winning the regimental boxing championship than in being a good soldier, and the individual actually leading his company is a thirty-year non-commissioned officer, First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster). Warden ends up carrying on an illicit affair with Holmes's lonely wife Karen (Deborah Kerr). The plot revolves around Holmes's attempt to force a bugler, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) to fight as a middleweight in the regimental competition; Prewitt's friendship with his Italian American buddy, Private Angelo Maggio (Sinatra); and the parallel affairs involving Warden and Karen Holmes, on the one hand, and Prewitt's infatuation with a prostitute who calls herself Lorene (Donna Reed), on the other. The film adaptation of Jones's novel continues its attack upon the brutality of Army life and its destruction of individuality. While Sergeant Warden\n\n36\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nadmires Prewitt's abilities as a bugler and as a soldier, he thinks his stubborn refusal to give in to Holmes represents a stupid personal decision. Prewitt remarks: \"A man don't go his own way, he's nothing.\" Warden's response juxtaposes the philosophy of rugged individualism espoused by Prewitt with the motto of the organization man that will be so important in the 1950s: \"Maybe back in the days of the pioneers, a man could go his own way. But today, you gotta play ball.\" As Maggio tells the boxers who threaten Prewitt as he is playing pool, \"the guy don't have to fight if he don't want to without gettin' kicked around.\" From Here to Eternity also presents an ugly form of ethnic prejudice aimed at Italian Americans in the person of Maggio. In the New Congress Club, a bordello masquerading as a social club, Maggio runs afoul of the Sergeant of the Guard at the stockade of the Schofield Army Barracks. \"Fatso\" Judson—played by Ernest Borgnine—who was of Italian American descent and soon to win an Oscar for his altogether different role as the mild, soft-spoken Italian American butcher of Marty (1955)—insults Maggio's sister while the soldier is showing the friends in his outfit a picture of his family of fifteen people. At various times in the film, Judson calls Maggio a \"little Mussolini,\" a \"tough monkey,\" but mostly a \"wop.\" At one point, Maggio provides his famous response—\"Only my friends call me wop\"—and begins a brawl that requires Warden's intervention to prevent Judson from attacking Maggio with a switchblade knife. Later, it is significant that Maggio addresses Prewitt with a term made famous by Roberto Rossellini in his epic neorealist film Paisan (1946, Paisà) only a few years earlier: \"Enjoy yourself, paisan. . . .\" The English term paisan derives from the Italian word paisano, itself derived from the word paese, meaning town or village: a paisano is therefore someone from one's hometown, a countryman, a close friend. This is the word that American servicemen learned in Sicily when they landed on the island to liberate it in 1943, a term of friendship and community that was used by both the Italian natives and their GI liberators. And it is a word employed by Italian Americans as well. Still more significant is that Prewitt begins to call Maggio paisan thereafter in the film and eventually kills Judson in a knife fight to avenge Maggio's death in the stockade due to Judson's brutality and torture. From Here to Eternity presents a masculine world where soldiers such as Prewitt, Warden, and Maggio are married to their respective careers in the military, not their female objects of desire. The most significant element in the representation of this particular Hollywood Italian, Angelo Maggio, is that Maggio becomes, along with Robert E. Lee Prewitt, the embodiment of the American belief in rugged individualism and rejection of conform-\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n37\n\nFrom Here to Eternity (1953; Fred Zinnemann, director). Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra) is overmatched when he tries to tangle with \"Fatso\" Judson (Ernest Borgnine) and is restrained by Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift). ity, an ideal not previously associated with Italian Americans. Part of Hollywood's stereotypical Italian image continues—Maggio drinks, loves to carouse, and basically allows his instincts to rule his reason. But fundamentally, this \"typically Italian\" emotionalism seen in the silent cinema's Hollywood Italians does not alter the fact that now an ethnic, a representative of the \"Other,\" stands for values as American as apple pie, while the more recognizably WASP or Anglo figures, such as Captain Holmes, embody an ethnic of conformity that the film critiques as basically un-American. Unlike the novel's relentless dissection of Army ethnic prejudice, conformity, and anti-individualism, the film mutes these themes in comparison to Jones's original narrative. In the novel, Holmes's treatment of Prewitt passes unnoticed, whereas in the film he is forced to resign in disgrace, guaranteeing a happy ending of sorts. Prewitt, a poor Kentucky kid named after a Confederate general who defended the institution of slavery, and Maggio, a Hollywood Italian, paradoxically stand for the freedom of the individual to follow his or her own path. Tragically, they both die for their troubles—Maggio tortured in the stockade, Prewitt shot when trying to return to his unit after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n38 T h e R o s e Tattoo (1955): Ethnic Community\n\nHollywood Italians Generational\n\nConflict\n\nand\n\nTennessee Williams's play The Rose Tattoo (written in 1948, produced in 1950, and published in 1951) reflects a happy period in the playwright's life: the time spent in New Orleans where Williams fell in love with his longtime companion, Frank Merlo, a member of the large Sicilian community in the Louisiana area. Although Daniel Mann's film adaptation of the play was shot in Key West (another favorite Williams haunt, along with Rome), a screenplay written by Williams himself depicts life in an Italian American community in Louisiana, where most of the adults, including the priest, still speak Italian while their children are bilingual. Despite the film's emphasis upon the link between being Sicilian and being emotional, a universal Hollywood stereotype, its convincing portrait of an ethnic community owes much to Williams's own observations of Louisiana's Italian Americans in the late 1940s. The rose has always been a popular symbol for passion and love, but Williams gives this shopworn image a new twist. His play and the film for which he wrote the script revolve around a rose tattoo first associated with a very WASP platinum blond named Estelle (Virginia Grey), who enters the opening sequence by leaving a Bourbon Street tattoo parlor and announcing to some inquisitive children that she has just had a rose tattooed over her heart. She then goes to the home of Serafina Delle Rose (Anna Magnani), a seamstress living in a small fishing town on the outskirts of New Orleans, to ask her to make a shirt out of rose-colored silk cloth for her lover, who, she says, is as \"wild as a Gypsy.\" Estelle goes off to the Mardi Gras Club in New Orleans where she is a blackjack dealer, while Serafina speaks to her sleeping husband, who is a truck driver/smuggler and informs him that she is pregnant. After suddenly leaving the house abruptly without even saying goodbye or remarking on his forthcoming child, he is killed during a police ambush in the countryside. Subsequently Estelle turns up at Serafina's home dressed in mourning, and we discover that her lover was Serafina's husband Rosario—something apparently everyone in the tightly knit Sicilian community knew except Serafina and her daughter—and her neighbors attack Estelle, shouting \"assassina\" in Italian until she is rescued by the parish priest. The film then cuts to a period three years later (no dates are given but judging from the cars in the film, the time frame is more or less contemporary). Although Serafina sews all the prom dresses for the entire Italian community, she refuses to allow her daughter Rosa (Marisa Pavan) to dress up for the prom and graduation from high school. Rosa wants to be an American girl, free to follow her fancies, whereas Serafina expects her to\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n39\n\naccept the sick and self-indulgent life of mourning that she believes she must embrace for the rest of her life. Rosa meets a young sailor named Jack Hunter and stays out with him late, telling her mother she has been studying civics with him. When her mother refuses to believe this obvious excuse, Rosa's parody of her mother's Sicilian-accented English reflects the conflict of two generations: \"You don't study no civics tonight.\" Why do you talk like you just came over in steerage. This isn't Sicily and you're not a baronessa. You do sewing. Daddy... Daddy hauled bananas, he hauled bananas and something under the bananas \"The Sheik of Araby\" resounds on the player piano. This musical motif was originally inspired by one of Rudolph Valentino's most famous movie performances, and it continues to play throughout The Rose Tatoo to emphasize the power of love that eventually triumphs. Rosa feels ashamed of her mother's Sicilian attachment to her dead father, based on self-delusion. The rest of the film progressively destroys Serafina's illusions about her husband Rosario and offers a parallel between the passion Rosa feels for Jack and what Serafina begins to feel for a happy-go-lucky Sicilian named Alvaro Mangiacavallo (Burt Lancaster). Serafina learns of her husband's unfaithfulness from two loose women eager to encounter men attending a political convention in New Orleans: one of them has asked Serafina to sew a blouse for the occasion. They, too, know about Estelle's affair with Rosario, eventually reacting to Serafina's puritanical attitudes by telling her that Estelle not only had an affair with him but that she, too, bought \"a rose tattoo on her c h e s t . . . same as the macaroni's....\" Serafina's passion for her errant husband had always been expressed within the bounds of holy matrimony, but now Rosa's budding sexuality becomes almost aggressive. She tells Jack that you learn to dance with a man by feeling his moves with your body and that he has made her feel like a woman for the first time in her life. Serafina's sexuality lies dormant underneath her surface morality like a volcano, while she sees Rosa as \"a wild thing\" and even forces Jack to promise in front of a statue of the Madonna that he will respect Rosa's \"innocence.\" Of course, she has made sure that Jack is Catholic as well. Their exchange also demonstrates their conflicting cultures, Sicilian and American: JACK: I guess Sicilians are very emotional people. SERAFINA: I want nobody to take advantage of that.\n\n40\n\nHollywood Italians JACK: YOU got the wrong idea about me, Mrs. Delle Rose. SERAFINA: H u m m m . . . . I know what men w a n t . . . not to eat ice cream or dance on the floor.... no and boys are the same, only younger.\n\nAlvaro Mangiacavallo appears after almost half the film has run: he is slightly crazy, unmarried, and simpatico in the extreme. Moreover, when Serafina offers to darn his shirt, his muscular body arouses her sexual interest: \"Madonna Santa, my husband's body with the head of a clown! A clown that smells like a goat!\" She offers him the silk shirt she has sewn after he announces that he is an eligible bachelor and has nothing more than \"love and affection in a world that's lonely and cold\" to offer. Now Alvaro starts up the player piano, and \"The Sheik of Araby\" theme song takes on renewed meaning. Serafina's iron resolve to honor her husband begins to melt. Alvaro shows her a rose tattoo he has had placed on his chest to show her how much he loves her, but this only inspires her to force Alvaro to take her to the Mardi Gras Club to confront Estelle, still hoping to learn that her husband was always faithful. In an emotional scene near her blackjack table, EsteUe actually bares her breasts to show Serafina her tattoo—discreetly turned away from the camera's eye! Serafina's response is to return home, smash the urn containing her husband's ashes, eventually accepting Alvaro's comic but authentic suit for her affections. The final scene shows Alvaro singing a comic song in Italian (\"rondinella felice\" or \"happy little swallow\") with the approval of the entire neighborhood. Serafina is also reconciled with her daughter, approves of her marriage to Jack, and once again she starts the player piano with its theme song of \"The Sheik of Araby\" as she invites Alvaro into her home with the beguiling remark: \"Now we can go on with our conversation.\" A crazy neighbor that according to Serafina has the evil eye (the maVocchio) closes the film with a cackle and a final judgment: \"Them Italians is at it again . . . and a truck driver in the household.\" Tennessee Williams knew the Sicilian community of New Orleans quite well, thanks to his partner Frank Merlo. He lived in the French Quarter, at the time populated primarily by Italian immigrants. Moreover, he apparently wrote The Rose Tattoo for Anna Magnani, an actress he met and admired in Rome during the years immediately following the American occupation of Rome and whose voluptuous earthiness he had obviously admired in such neorealist classics as Open City and The Miracle (1948) by Roberto Rossellini, who had also been her lover at one time. What is striking about this film is the stellar performance that earned Anna Magnani an unheard-of honor, the Oscar for Best Actress, a prize never be-\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n41\n\nfore bestowed on an Italian actress and one that would not be repeated until Sophia Loren won the same award for Vittorio De Sica's Two Women (1959, La ciociara). Her performance strikes a believable although highly emotional note, one that seems not so much a stereotypical portrait of a Sicilian woman as a replay of the unforgettable role she fulfilled in Rossellini's Open City: earthy, voluptuous, passionate, and comic in the most serious and humane sense of this term. The film portrays in a memorable way two generations in conflict within a vibrant ethnic community that offers emotional support for both the traditional Sicilian values of the old country—what many scholars of the Italian American experience have labeled la via vecchia[t>—and the new and more open values of the New World in which she now lives with her daughter, who must negotiate a safe passage between these two sometimes mutually exclusive systems of morality. As a historical document, The Rose Tattoo depicts an ethnic community that has not been solely reconstructed by the nostalgic power of memory, unlike many of the films explored later on in this chapter. The Hollywood Italians of both the play and its film adaptation belong to an ethnic world that was, at the time the play and film were presented, still very much alive in Southern Louisiana. The film also embraces the new ways of loving in America: Serafina's arranged marriage as a young bride from Sicily ended in death and betrayal because of a blond WASP hussy, but the marriage of Jack and Rosa and the love affair between Serafina and Alvaro promise to end happily (a completely unusual conclusion for a Tennessee Williams play or film adaptation) precisely because these new passions are founded upon a typically American openness to a freer and more honest expression of basic human emotions.\n\nM a r t y (1955): Fafoo Juddon FalL in Love Ernest Borgnine (1917- ) was frequently typecast as a heavy in numerous supporting roles, such as that of Fatso Judson in From Here to Eternity, not to mention similar parts in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), The Dirty Dozen (1967), and especially The Wild Bunch (1969). Subsequently, on the popular television series McHale's Navy (1962-66), he demonstrated a range of acting talents that included comedy. His performance in Marty earned him an Oscar for Best Actor, as well as acting awards from the New York Film Critics, the Golden Globes, and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, while Delbert Mann received an Oscar for Best Director, and the film won an Oscar as the year's Best Picture. Some of the most interesting films of the 1950s were in contention for awards that year (East of Eden, The Rose Tattoo, Picnic, Rebel without a Cause, Bad Day at Black Rock), and the actors\n\n42\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nThe Rose Tattoo (1955; Daniel Mann, director). After years of acting like a traditional southern Italian widow, Serafina (Anna Magnani)finallysucceeds in laughing and having fun with a happy-go-lucky Sicilian bachelor named Alvaro (Burt Lancaster).\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n43\n\ncompeting for recognition included Sal Mineo, James Dean, Frank Sinatra, and Anna Magnani, to mention only the most famous. Yet, Marty's simple story line and its moving account of a timid Italian American butcher working in an Italian American neighborhood in the Bronx was the surprise winner of most of the attention during that year's ceremonies. The film was produced by an independent company set up by Burt Lancaster and Harold Hecht, and was developed from a television play written by Paddy Chayefsky (who received the Oscar for Best Screenplay). Burt Lancaster, fresh from the triumph of From Here to Eternity, provided the narration for the film's trailer, in which he describes (self-interestedly, of course, as its producer) the film as \"the most beautiful love story I've ever seen in a movie\" and notes that the film's location, East 187th Street and Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, was near where he was born. He also emphasizes the fact that the neighborhood was characterized by \"many racial strains\" and that New York was \"just a huge collection of neighborhoods.\" Essentially, he is arguing that they intended to make an ethnic picture, and indeed, Marty provides a fascinating portrait of the different attitudes toward love between generations in a manner that recalls The Rose Tattoo. Marty, of courses, focuses upon the male Italian American, not the female. Marty Piletti is an overweight and awkward butcher, who has graduated from high school, served in the Army until the age of twenty-four, and returned home to a household of six siblings, all of whom are married except him. As a student, he was no intellectual but did well in high school, excelling in tough subjects (German, math). The obligations he felt to help his family and his five other brothers and sisters kept him from taking advantage of the GI Bill, and he, therefore, never attended the university. Now aged thirty-four, all his siblings are married and some already have families, but Marty remains stuck at home with his mother Theresa (Esther Minciotti) who constantly nags him about finding a wife. Frustrated by his failure to find love, he has practically given up because underneath his burly exterior, Marty possesses a sensitive soul that completely negates the stereotypical macho, Latin Lover image of the Italian American male. At the local bar where other single bachelors of the neighborhood hang out, Angie (Joe Mantell) and Marty exchange the film's memorably sad but funny Unes: ANGIE: What do you feel like doing tonight? MARTY: I dunno, Angie. What do you feel like doing? These two sentences become the film's mantra. At home, Marty finally explodes at his mother's nagging insistence upon marriage and reveals his inferiority complex:\n\n44\n\nHollywood Italians Whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased after enough girls in my life. I . . . I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called up a girl this afternoon, and I got Ma, a real brush-off, boy!... I'm just a fat, little man. A fat ugly man whaddaya want from me? Whaddaya want from me? I'm miserable enough as it is.\n\nFinally driven to distraction, Marty and Angie go to the Stardust Ballroom, a local dance hall, where the miracle occurs: he meets a high-school chemistry teacher named Clara Snyder (Betsy Blair) who is being dumped by her blind date, and Marty's compassion for the girl kindles an immediate attraction between the two lonely hearts. Marty dries her tears, confesses that he, too, cries a lot, and explains his good-natured character by the pain he has suffered: \"You don't get to be good-hearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a . . . a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel.\" This Cinderella story pairing the traditional ugly duckling with the antithesis of the ethnic Latin Lover becomes more complicated with a sub-\n\nMarty (1955; Delbert Mann, director). A lonely bachelor named Marty Piletti (Ernest Borgnine) tries to change his habitual bad luck with women after he meets a high-school chemistry teacher named Clara Snyder (Betsy Blair).\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n45\n\nplot involving Marty's mother Theresa and her sister Caterina (Augusta Ciolli). The two Italian women, immigrants who still speak their native language, are obsessed by a paradoxical but natural obsession for Italian or Italian American mothers: while they want their sons and daughters to marry and have children, they also fear they will be forced to live alone once they have no husband for whom to cook and clean. Thus, sons become surrogates for departed husbands. When confronted with Clara in her home, dread of abandonment quickly strikes Theresa, and when Clara volunteers the opinion that she feels young married couples should have their privacy, Theresa Piletti begins to echo her sister's paranoid fears, declaring: It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you Itsa very sad thing whena you son hasa no place for you in his house... you gotta have a housa to clean. You gotta have children to cooka for. Dese are the terrible years for a mother. Clara's innocent remark that mothers need more to give their lives meaning than their children receives the sarcastic reply: \"Well, thatsa whata they teach you ina New York University? Inna real life, it no work out like this. You wait until you are a mother.\" Once Clara has left the house, Theresa declares that college girls are only one step removed from hookers and orders Marty not to bring her back because she is not Italian. One point in her favor, Clara's Catholicism, does not emerge at this point. Traditional mythology maintains that when an Italian American male has a choice to make between his mother and his wife or girlfriend, the mother always wins. And indeed, this seems to be the direction the film is heading as Marty fails to call Clara at the appointed time for a second date and heads off to the bar with his bachelor friends. At the bar, three of them carry on a completely chauvinist discussion about how Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer novels demonstrate the proper attitude toward women. Angie and Marty's other friends criticize Clara (they classify women they don't like as \"dogs\"). Suddenly Marty hears the film's famous refrain, only now spoken by others (\"What do you feel like doing, Angie?\" \"I dunno. What do you feel like doing?\" \"I dunno.\"). In a moment of courage, he tells his friends that they are wasting their time, that he had a wonderful time with the woman they dismissed as a \"dog,\" and rushes to a public phone booth to call her. The film ends with Marty talking to Clara. The simple, uncomplicated narrative line of Marty, not unlike equally simple yet eloquent storylines of Italian neorealist classics from only a few years earlier, struck a chord in audiences all over the world. Who has not had fears and disappointments when attempting to meet the other sex?\n\n46\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nWho but the most disagreeable, egomaniacal Latin Lovers? Part of the power of Marty is that it succeeds in treating such a theme with an Italian American lead. Rather than a modern Romeo, Marty lacks even the modicum of those social graces usually associated with Italian men, who are supposed to sweep women off their feet with their good looks, their charm, and their animal sex appeal. Ernest Borgnine plays against his usual role, and the film undercuts the ethnic stereotypes we frequently associate with Italian lovers. In spite of the memorable performances of both Borgnine and Betsy Blair, however, perhaps the most memorable sequences of the film involve the two Italian widows: Esther Miniciotti and Augusta Ciolli provide completely authentic characterizations of an earlier generation of female immigrants who came to America, like Serafina Delle Rose in The Rose Tattoo, committed to a life given over completely to the care of their husbands, husbands who frequently disregarded their self-sacrificial definition of the tasks of motherhood. Marty's attachment to a strong, independent American (but Catholic!) woman such as Clara holds out the promise that the third generation of Italian American sons and daughters may well adopt a very different cultural model than that of the self-effacing and sacrificial—yet controlling—wife and mother who gives her husband and family everything, leaving no meaning in her life when her family leaves home. Little Italy ad Paradide Lodt in Postwar America: Hollywood Italians in M a c (1992), B i g N i g h t (1996), A B r o n x Tale (1993), H o u s e h o l d S a i n t s (1993), L o v e w i t h T h e P r o p e r Stranger (1963), ItalianAmerican (1974), M o o n s t r u c k (1987), True L o v e (1989), and M y C o u s i n V i n n y (1992) It is a commonplace that Italian American immigrants took longer to emerge from the laboring classes to reach the middle and upper-middle classes in America than other groups who arrived in America at approximately the same time. In this regard, Jewish immigrants are most frequently cited, and indeed, the canonical novel of the Italian American experience, Christ in Concrete, even contains a Russian Jewish character named Louis Molov, the friend of Geremio's son Paul, who realizes (unlike Geremio, whose culture stresses the nobility of manual labor, not book learning) that education and books are the ticket out of the ghetto where immigrants were condemned to physically demanding, low-paying, lowprestige jobs. Louis's book of choice is, ironically, Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class, and to the contemporary reader, Louis seems destined to make a career as a professional or even a university professor\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n47\n\nunlike his Italian American neighbors who will spend an additional generation in their rise out from the depths of the working class. Even as late as the mid-1950s in Marty, the timid butcher admits that his trade has low social status and regrets not receiving proper university training, especially since (as noted) he was very good in tough subjects in high school. The immigrants who settled in America by 1920 had children like Marty who later served in the American armed forces during World War II and were subsequently eligible for the GI Bill, the ticket to advanced education for many. Their children, a third generation of people of Italian descent, found it much easier to move on to higher education and to climb the ladder of success in America. Today, during the first decade of the twenty-first century, chief-executive officers of major corporations, university presidents, and high-ranking politicians and professional people with Italian names or Italian origins are so numerous that they need not be listed. And in the Hollywood cinema, as the dedication to this book suggests, Italian Americans have recently played a significant role in shaping the image of Hollywood Italians in the mass media. As America has transformed itself into a homogenized land of shopping malls and suburbs rather than a collection of individual urban ghetto villages in metropolitan centers that initially welcomed foreign immigrants, the present generation of filmmakers has looked back on the past of their childhood and the world their fathers and mothers made with understandable nostalgia for the family, community, religious values, and the memories of that period. Mac, a film directed by actor John Turturro and dedicated at its conclusion to the memory of his father Nicholas R. Turturro, celebrates the same working-class values of dedication to a high tradition of craftsmanship that has characterized Italian builders since the cathedrals of the Middle Ages and Renaissance were constructed in the Old Country. Set in the Italian section of Queens in 1954 (exactly the same period depicted in Marty with far less nostalgia), this interesting film traces the conflicts between the three Vitelli brothers: Mac (John Turturro), Vico (Michael Badalucco), and Bruno (Carlo Capotorto). Mac also continues a practice common since the 1970s, from Scorsese and Coppola to The Sopranos—that of casting large numbers of authentic Italian Americans as Hollywood Italians, giving the film a truer ethnic flavor. As the credits roll, its powerful opening image of booted feet striding through mud and wet concrete on a construction site visualizes its major theme of the nobility of manual labor that Christ in Concrete celebrated in a more obviously ideological manner. A number of musical pieces, such as Italian folk songs carried over from the Old Country, Enrico Caruso, and music from Verdi's opera // trovatore, provide nostalgic ethnic commentary, and unlike the sound tracks of other films in\n\n48\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nthis period depicting Hollywood Italians, the music here looks primarily toward the past rather than toward contemporary songs by popular groups, as is so typical of the films by Scorsese and others of his generation. As each of the three brothers approaches their father's coffin at a wake, the director constructs a spooky scene in which the dead father inspires a personal memory in the life of each brother as a boy. In three flashbacks, Mac learns honesty by being sent to one of his father's customers who tries to avoid paying his father for the work he has done for him; Vico learns to urinate on his soft hands to avoid the blisters that construction work causes; and Bruno watches as his father paints a fresco-like narrative painting on their staircase. Then, this stern first-generation patriarch reminds his three offspring of the simple values that he has inculcated in them: By the work one knows the workman Rome wasn't built in a day. You remember . . . there's only two ways to do something... my way and the right way, and they are both the same. The archaic wailing of Italian-speaking women dressed in the traditional black widow's weeds of the Mezzogiorno at the funeral drives the point home that these values are both ancient and foreign—imported into the New World. Mac accepts his father's advice as the golden rule. As he puts it, happiness is \"loving your job . . . every job is like a . . . first love.\" Nonetheless, Bruno is really more interested in painting and Vico likes a good party more than construction and carpentry. Unlike his brothers, Mac is obsessed with placing studs in the proper place to make a sound wall, not the cheaper, sleazier method of spacing studs further apart to save a few cents, as his Polish boss forces him to do. He convinces his two brothers to go into construction on their own, building four houses on spec near an insane asylum and a cow pasture that reeks of manure, land they can afford to purchase with the meager funds at their disposal. The shrieks of the inmates and the stench of the fields almost destroy any chance of finding customers for the homes, but Mac's manic drive to complete four well-built houses that are the antithesis of the contemporary Levittown mass-produced domiciles prevails. His single-minded determination finally alienates his brothers so that they abandon him just as he is about to launch a second and much more ambitious project. In the process, Vico and Bruno also reject the traditional values of their father and their heritage. In effect, they have been Americanized in the sense that they adopt the values of the dominant culture, not those of the patriarch or his son Mac. In a moving conclusion, Mac brings his young son to see the four beautiful homes he and his brothers built and tells him that in his grandfather's\n\nDagos: Hollywood Histories of Immigration\n\n49\n\nMac (1992; John Turturro, director). The three Vitelli brothers—Bruno (Carlo Capotorto), Mac (John Turturro), and Vico (Michael Badalucco)—bid on a lot, gambling that they can make a profit from building a house on spec.\n\nday, people still cared about craftsmanship and the necessity of doing honest, competent work with their hands. In what would have constituted a rebuttal to the image of success offered by The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1955), Sloan Wilson's best-seller that depicted an entirely different set of 1950s values, Mac warns his son: \"Not today. Today, it's the man who can talk who's respected. Before it was the man who could d o . . . they were ones looked up to . . . to reach the goals it's nice, it's p l e a s a n t . . . it's the doing that's the thing.\"19 Most likely Turturro was inspired to make this film by an understandable desire to honor his father and his Italian American cult of craftsmanship and perhaps to pay homage to an Italian film made only a few years earlier by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Good Morning Babylon (1989). In that work, the Tavianis depicted a pair of Italian immigrants who learn the craft of building from their father who has worked on Italian cathedrals and later share their construction skills in Hollywood with D. W. Griffith, employing the detail of an elephant from the façade of the cathedral in Pisa as the basis for the design of an elephant that plays a crucial role in the\n\n50\n\nHollywood Italians\n\nBabylonian set of Intolerance and makes their fortunes in America as set designers. At the close of the film, Griffith makes a speech that implicitly embraces the idea of filmmaking as a craft not unlike the building of the great medieval and Renaissance cathedrals in Italy.20 Like Mac, which was Turturro's directorial debut, Big Night is actor Stanley Tucci's first effort as a director, with the assistance of Campbell Scott. This film, too, is set in an Italian American community in the 1950s but in New Jersey, not New York City. This light-handed and well-directed comedy also casts doubt not only on American values but on Italian American culture as well, identifying it with the new consumer society of the 1950s through the metaphor of cooking rather than carpentry.
