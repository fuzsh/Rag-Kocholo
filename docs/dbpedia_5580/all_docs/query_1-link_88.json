In\n\nthe 1920s, his father left the Corriere della Sera and moved to the United States, where he directed\n\nthe Italian-American newspaper Corriere d'America from 1923 to 1931.[1]\n\nAfter completing his studies in Italy and at Columbia\n\nUniversity, Barzini Jr. worked for two New\n\nY\n\nork newspapers, such as the New Y\n\nork World.[1] In 1928, together with Richard Washburn Child,\n\nformer\n\nAmbassador\n\nto\n\nItaly\n\nand\n\na\n\nsupporter\n\nof\n\nBenito\n\nMussolini,\n\nhe\n\nghostwrote\n\nThe\n\nAutobiography of Benito Mussolini.[2] He returned to Italy in 1930 to become a correspondent for\n\nCorriere della Sera.[1]\n\nHis\n\nfather\n\nhad\n\npro-Fascist\n\nsentiments\n\nand\n\nhad\n\naccess\n\nto\n\nhighest\n\npolitical\n\ncircles\n\nof\n\nBenito\n\nMussolini's\n\nFascist\n\nregime.\n\nLuigi\n\nJr.,\n\nhowever,\n\nfrequented\n\nyoung\n\ndissidents\n\naround\n\nGaleazzo\n\nCiano, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mussolini's son-in-law.[1]\n\n[edit] Panay Incident\n\nAs the Corriere della Sera Asian correspondent, he went to China.
