        "text": "A few years ago a large number of people began to feel anxious about a growing distrust of America which was making itself manifest in Western Europe and which was paralleled by a similar distrust of Western Europe in America. This feeling caused considerable apprehension on both sides of the Atlantic and in 1952 I felt that it was of the first importance to try to remove this suspicion, distrust, and lack of confidence which threatened to jeopardize the postwar work of the Western Allies. I therefore approached H.R.H. Prince Bernhard, Dr Paul Rykens, and M. Paul van Zeeland with the suggestion that we should organize some unofficial and private meetings to discuss the difficulties and dangers which were causing us so much anxiety. To these meetings we would invite influential and reliable people who carried the respect of those working in the field of national and international affairs and whose personal contact with men at the summit of public activity could help to smooth over these difficulties. Acting on the advice of my three friends, I approached about a dozen other people, viz.: Mr. Marshal of the R.A.F. Lord Portal of Hungerford, Ambassador Quaroni, and Signor de Gasperi. In our view the improvement of relations between America and Europe ought not to be undertaken through any special publicity or propaganda, since it was of far greater consequence to us to have mutual understanding and goodwill among men occupying the highest positions in the life of each country than to try to influence the man in the street directly. We had to consider how it would be possible to hold frank and full discussions on these problems. In official international meetings, which are attended by representatives accompanied by a retinue of experts and civil servants, there are few opportunities for discussion, for three reasons: 1 Through fear of indiscretion, representatives discuss only the problems, not their mutual reactions or the reactions those problems would provoke among the Western countries. 1 They are swamped by details and practical considerations instead of being able to go to the core of the subject under discussion. 3. If they are not able to reach agreement on a certain point they shelve it in order to avoid giving the impression of disunity. Consequently, incidents occur which could have been foreseen and which are almost unavoidable in such circumstances. On the other hand, when international meetings take place between representatives of only a few countries not all interrelated problems can be discussed, because there is no adequate representation to emphasize the points of all individual countries.\n\nThere is an interesting saying in Nigeria which I have used a couple of time here; it asks a busy body the rhetorical question \"who send you market\" In truth, who sent me into the market of trading in knowledge and perspectives. It is against the rhetorical question that sharing my report of the recently concluded Development Studies Association conference at SOAS fits in perfectly and not too difficult a task. What is difficult for me currently is why I want to burden readers with such a sketchy account. As with twisted narrations, the third episode can be the last and the last one could be the first as well. In this case, I started the ritual of stepping into this intellectual space from the University of Leeds (the alma mater of the new British Prime Minster), then I found my way to Bournemouth University and before this last one I attended an online webinar (Asixoxe-Let's Talk), finally I traveled to the heart of London to attend DSA conference where over 500 participants paid over three hundred pounds each to share their research findings with counterparts in the temple of knowledge."
