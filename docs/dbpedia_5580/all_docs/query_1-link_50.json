He is one of the minor villains on this Wiki, was a supporting villain in The Godfather Game and used to be one of the richest mobsters in the American underworld before Bruno Tattaglia thwarted him.\n\nVictor was also one of Shao Kahn's henchmen during the New Era events and was one of the many responsible for Shao's rise to power in Outworld once more.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn on 16 January 1985/15 BH, Victor first became involved with his father's business during the Castellamarese War, where he became known as a valuable asset to the family. He was also known to have a cold, calculating streak similar to his father. He held his office at Victor's Hotel in New Town prior to 2004, where he moved to Hotel Medicine for strategic purposes. There is some certain proof that Victor is a closet homosexual under the fake name \"Eduardo Balisteri\". It is unknown why he hide his sexual orientation so badly, as his father has never been known to have anything against LGBT's. Victor also made deals with Willy Aquilare and Sonny-Boy Granzella to sell his family some diamonds and other rubies, earning him the nickname \"Diamond God\", before Granzella's death.\n\nRole in the War and Capture[]\n\nHe was known as an expert marksman with a pistol, and often personally carried out hits and missions for his father, in a somewhat similar role to Sonny Corleone, although Barzini was always accompanied by an army of bodyguards, who managed to keep him alive throughout the Five Families Mob War.\n\nVictor managed to stay alive due to his laying low in public, although he attended the funeral of Tony Bianchi with his father, despite having rather low views on the lawyer. He was eventually drawn out whilst holding the funeral for his fallen capo, Domenico Mazza at the St. Charlotte's Church in Mid Town. The procession was ambushed by Charlie Trapani, who killed the entire army of bodyguards, yet Barzini escaped.\n\nEmilio ran to the entrance of Chateau Toledo, but was captured by police officers who were bribed by Charlie beforehand to capture him for interrogation at the Corleone Mansion.\n\nFreedom[]\n\nOn 19 July of 2013, Michael Corleone called Al Neri to a meeting with him and Pennino at the mansion, however when Al Neri crossed the gate many cars carrying Barzini soldiers disembarked and began to attack. The bloody battle ended with the defeat of the Corleones. After the battle ended, Paul Fortunato turns out to be the head of the operation and frees Victor to plan their next move.\n\nFor years, it was known that Victor did the basic sith all other Fortunato Regime members did, like planning to rule the whole France, Europe and America itself through the mob's connections with the DeVazzi Family. He, like all the other surviving members of his father's empire, still lives in America, in the same mansion as his ex-boss Fortunato used to live. Victor also voted for grandfather, Francesco, to win the presidential elections of the United States of America under the false name Frank Kenson, defeating Hillary Clinton. Victor also claims he convinced Paul to vote for him in hopes of changing America despite Fortunato being a member of the Democratic party.\n\nOn 2 June, 2016, Victor killed Samuele Gorginni by shooting him in the chest with a Dillinger in a short shootout between the Fortunatos and Tattaglias.\n\nTaking over as the Don[]\n\nOn January, 2019, Victor convinced Fortunato's girlfriend, Barbra Lindhoffen, to date one of his men instead (who turned out to be Milan Petrovič) of Paulie, a manipulation he succeeded in. With that out of the way, Victor was free to assassinate Paul and takeover back the Barzini mob for himself, convincing all of Fortunato's men to join his glorious cause. Main factors contributing to Victor into killing Paul were the fact that as Barzini's son, he wanted to lead the family himself as heir to his father and because Don Fortunato disrespected his father many times during his reign.\n\nAs the Don of the Barzini Family, Emilio II convinced the Tattaglia Family to join him by his side in running the United States of America with the DeVazzi Family, despite being on thin ice with the former for many years.\n\nNew Era events[]\n\nWhen the Keeper and Goddess of Time, Queen Almeida, began preparing to undo the history of man to create the miraculous New Era events, Barzini is one of the many time displaced people to arrive in the present North Outworld, specifically during the execution of Lord Farquaad, alongside with Outworld's ex-ruler, Shao Kahn, Red Harlow, Bruno Tattaglia, Grizzly, Raiden, Javier Escuella, and the past human versions of Liu Kang, Kung Lao, and Jade.\n\nWhen Shao fights his brother, Kotal Kahn for the throne of Outworld, erupting the coliseum into chaos from all sides, Victor and the others decide to help Shao and Barzini, along with Escuella, shoot at and fought Kotal's Army with his Dillinger, they were all primitive and weak anyway. After getting his booty kicked by Jade as did most of Shao's newest allies, Barzini escapes with Shao and the others when Leopold Strauss arrives to whisk Shao's group away to safety in the Kytinn Hive. Barzini and Bruno were the last two to enter the portal.\n\nAt the Hive, Victor and the others watch as Javier personally swears his loyalty to Shao Kahn but also warns him not to trust Strauss, while he also learns about Kotal. Not long after, Almeida herself arrives, offering the deposed Emperor a greater empire in her New Era and promises him that he will get his Outworld back but tells him he will have to use its armies to protect her and her hourglass as she prepares to undo the history of man.\n\nBarzini, his buddy Bruno and the others remain at Shao's side as he moves them to the Tarkatan Camps on the edges of Outworld's wasteland beaches, where he prepares his army and allies to slaughter them all, being aware of Baraka's betrayal thanks to Almeida's clever manipulations. However, Kotal Kahn and Jade sneaked into the camp for a preemptive strike, which resulting in a botch as they were both captured by Shao, Victor personally held Jade down to the ground. Barzini and the rest of Shao's allies are then seen slaughtering the Tarkatans to bits, Victor using his Dillinger and Magnum to blow their heads off.\n\nBack at Kahn's Coliseum, Shao is getting ready to execute Kotal, but before he can land the fatality, Princess Kitana storms in, leading the remaining Tarkatans and Ponys under one banner to take over Outworld once again from Shao, but that failed miserably. After a long battle, Kitana and her minions are defeated, and despite the fact that Kotal was freed from his guillotine, he was no longer the Emperor and was only a minor help in Kitana's rebel assault.\n\nAfter Shao finally takes his purpely purple planet back in peace, Bruno, Victor and the others are seen in his throne room, only for them to be seen taking a portal back to Earth, minus Farquaad and Harlow, as one lives on Orinion while the other serves Shao on his own planet.\n\nToday, Victor is currently needing some help from the Tattaglia Underboss, Bruno, in extincting the last of the Corleones and some Westside Rollerz who are planning on moving into the Barzini Family's turf in New York City. In return for this ginormous help, Victor will help Bruno kill off his brother, Luigi Tattaglia, and his most loyal followers so Bruno can become the Don of the Tattaglia Family in his stead.\n\nThe pair succeeded in this plan and thus, Bruno became don of his own family, for the very, very first time. Then the two moved to US to New Jersey to expand.\n\nConquering New Jersey[]\n\nDon Barzini later moved his bags and his sags and along with Tattaglia arrived to New Jersey in the States to settle and expend, gonna be the enemy, gonna smile & destroy. Initially, both Tattaglia and Victor respected and valued each other. Following their greedy attitudes however, it was seen that the two Dons divided their empire shortly, firmly. After a while, Bruno and Victor gradually fell out, leading to a \"mob war\" of sorts. Victor would antagonise Bruno, albeit never attempting an assassination on him.\n\nVictor soon enlisted Marco the Clopper into his family after inspecting his cum and benis size plus hardcorness in BDSM. During the mob war, Victor lost nearly everything invested there and even in New York, being under pressure from Marco (literally), the police, politicians, judges and Tattaglia men. Even worse, his trusted ally and booker, Leopold Strauss, betrayed him as was expected from that snake. However, things began to change from bad to good a lil'. Victor gained the valuable Pringles shipment stolen from Tattaglia when the chips started becoming too expensive in the markets, which dealt him a hard blow and he had to switch back to Lays. On June, 2020, Barzini was having an affair with Marco and then dinner at the biggest restaurant in town, but they were suddenly attacked by assassins sent by Tattaglia and led by Willie Sissy. Both men luckily survived just as Marco was about to pull out and they killed their assassins (minus Willie), but the restaurant was destroyed in the process. Marco and Victor then went to Willie's apartment to finish the assassin after finding out his address from one of their stalkers. Vicor killed Willie by smashing his head against the pavement.\n\nAround that time, Victor also lost the Project's trust and alliance thanks to Bruno convincing them to throw him out and so Bruno took his place.\n\nVictor then plotted a chain of assassinations on Tattaglia's men: Thomas Elliot, Tony Jacobs, Strauss, and finally Bruno himself. Elliot and Jacobs were killed, but Victor and Mark failed to kill either Strauss or Bruno.\n\nHowever, Bruno escaped back to France thx to fearing for his life, while Victor became the most powerful man once again. In August, he sent Marco and the others to steal some crates filled with Toblerone, but were really diamonds meant to be sold for far greater profits than the chocolate Marco and the guys were led to believe. Barzini then discovered that Marco had cheated on him with one of his men, Adolphe Chaput, and was furious as all hell. Barzini then had the Clopper be put under a watch, under the watchful eye of Milan Petrovič. When Marco and Adolphe had a date and sex later at the Hotel, Vic find out about it and ordered both men to be murdered. Marco was assassinated, but Adolphe managed to thwart his own death, killing Petrovič while Strauss testified against the man who was once his boss (even if for a lil' while): Victor himself. Of course Leo would do that.\n\nBarzini was sentenced to life imprisonment or at least 50 years. Only 13 days after his imprisonment, Chaput died from complications of COVID-19 and Barzini got released via Gary Bluechart.\n\nThe 9-Man Clan[]\n\nThe Clan was created when Gary Bluechart randomly selected a few yumans with fighting experiences and hired them to fight in his wars for some oil on freaking Ochanep soil. Queen Almeida suggested Gary on which people to pick. These men are Scout, Sarg. Morganson, Octavio the Clown, Drew Galloway McIntyre, JACK, Woody, Kano, Leopold Strauss, and of course, Victor Barzini, who was selected to lead the bunch.\n\nDuring one of their missions in Arizona, the Clan found out they were not alone in the state, as Ochanep's Globgloglabgalab was after them after their recent attack of the planet.\n\nAs the team was heading back to their base to hide after taking a briefcase from Ochanep, Strauss and Woody noticed that their newly bought French bread from Joey's Baked Goods had tumours. Because of this the team believed that they only had five days left to live, so Victor and Scout arranged a meeting with all of the members, where they would exchange their last wishes before they would kick the bucket. However, Scout ruined the meeting by making fun of Barzini, and only Morganson was able to make his wish; get some gold from Fort Knox, steal their intentions. Hagers lying dipped in oil, yelling \"Muh Freedum!\", typical of 'Mericans. Scout later apologised and tried to ask Victor for some help to be more charismatic and to learn some tricks of the trade as he wants to go on a serious date with one of Barzini's employees, Eileen Medicine. After Scout failed to impress Medicine thanks to his clumsiness and beta attitude, Medicine got word from Woody and Strauss that the team was not suffering from tumours and it was just the bread that was mutated, and not them, they already got the COVID-19 to be worried about anyway. Morganson then finally finds out that the presence that's been following them from the hostile planet was a large, evil Globgloglabgalab, who planned on eating and killing all of the 9 men from the spicy Clan. However, Glob couldn't do jack sith as he was shoot all over by all of the team members, especially Octavio the Clown. After Glob escaped back to his realm, Scout was sad as hell as he couldn't get on a date with Medicine, only for Victor to laugh at his face with his Frenchy laugh.\n\nDeath[]\n\nSarg. Eric Morganson got rid of him by blowing off his head with his shotgun as he thought he was a traitor to the Clan. RIP forever Victor.\n\nOwn told Bio[]\n\nHey baby! It's me, old brown eyes, Emilio the II. I sing, I swing, and ring-a-ding-ding, I'm a French icon! I set out on my path to be one of the modern French gangster as a kid, hanging out and shooting thugs for cash in nightclubs and bars. I liked quite a few hit songs like Come Fly With Me and Theme from New York New York. (You're looking at my suit. It wouldn't hurt to clean yourself up, kid. Have a little respect for yourself.) During Five Families Mob War, I was deemed \"Unfit for Combat\" by my father although it's suspected that he just \"paid a lot of money\" in order to make me \"avoid going to war.\" But I like to think I helped out my family in my own funny little way - by making boatloads of cash and slamming choice broads! I won an award for being the best basketball player in France, although I never really played basketball and my father said he \"paid some folk\" for that award, but who cares? It's all mine! You might know my family from a little video game called The Godfather Game (breaking the fourth wall, lol). The original one and all upgraded versions, baby! I was known for having things my way and whether or not having things my way meant getting a little help from my men, well, I can't quite say. Wink.\n\nIn Rap Battle[]\n\nVerse 1[]\n\nWow!\n\nWhat's wrong with your face, baby? Yikes!\n\nWith does teeth when you're through, there'll be no dust left to bite!\n\nChrist! Newsflash kid: this is show business!\n\nShow some class when you're dressed, shave that bush off yo' lips!\n\nBoo! You like the band Queen, huh? Ain't that sweet?\n\nYou dance like a pope on a bicycle race with no seat!\n\nThat's what's wrong with you people, you'll do anything to get famous!\n\nYou changed your name to Elvis Smoth. You should've been Luciano Fabbri!\n\nFrogmeister?\n\nVerse 2[]\n\nEasy, Jaws o' Life, I can't stand a racist!\n\nI love the colords and the queers, just ask Winston Handyman.\n\nLook, we all wannah swing, baby, but you took it too far.\n\nYou play Italian roulette, and you lost the draw!\n\nNo.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"The Corleones ain't worth my spit!\"\n\n— Victor Barzini\n\n\"Go to hell and take your family with you!\"\n\n— Victor to Trapani\n\n\"Watcha' gonna do, punk!?\"\n\n— Victor\n\n\"You can't make me talk.\"\n\n— Emilio's son when in captivity\n\n\"Please, spare me; I can help you.

He could be any one of us!\"\n\n— Victor on who the infiltrator to the Clan could be\n\nHit detail[]\n\nAs the Underboss of Barzini family, Victor is the strongest hit target you will have to face in the game. In addition, he has a mass number of bodyguards who are more powerful than generic Barzinis, even more or less all of them are Soldatos or Security guards.\n\nTrapani killed all of Victor's bodyguard army which were maybe a handful although not impossible. Strangely, Victor was a coward, more like brains than brawn, and he ran away no matter how many guards he still had, possibly referencing that he only wants to fight if he is sure that he can win and his bodyguards can take care of his enemy. But, Victor could take a lot of damage as he has the highest health of any hit targets.\n\nBut Victor did fight back with a Magnum which is common among underbosses, causing high amount of damage when hit. However, Trapani had a hired crew member and the police on his side, and they mostly took care of Barzini's goons while Charlie went after Victor, however it was actually a police officer who successfully captured him for interrogation at the Corleone Mansion.\n\nPersonality and traits[]\n\nA smooth and nasty individual, Victor was always impeccably dressed, even when going on jobs. Despite this, he was a brutal fighter and a master planner who managed to keep his attacks on the Corleones concealed by using bribed cops on the street to look the other way. When finally cornered, he tried to escape, and when captured he mocked Charlie with words \"pussy\" and \"coward\" as he didn't kill him, despite cowering like a pussy at the Corleone mansion later.\n\nVictor is also backstabbing and manipulative, being able to convince the entire Fortunato mob to join him by his side in killing Paul Fortunato, including his own girlfriend he had been with for years. However, Victor only saw these acts as some \"greater good\", which is kind of true, really.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHis rapping background was leather pink chair covering, and his opponent was Cuneo lawyer Edwin Smoth.\n\nVictor Barzini's net worth was around $9 billion, about $7 billion less than Tony Montana had. It is known he had so much money by selling drugs, owning most of France, being an Underboss for his dad's family, and being a part of the Project, however those numbers could very well be exaggerated and they were.\n\nHe had a similar style of quotes as Spy from TF2, who also sang his theme song.\n\nPolitical Policies[]\n\nIdeology: Centre-Left\n\nEconomic Policy: Neo-Capitalism\n\nReligious Policy: None, possibly atheism or so-called Barzininism\n\nWar Policy: Pro-Military\n\nAbortion: Neutral, mostly pro\n\nRacial equality: Pro, anti in the past\n\nLGBT rights: Pro\n\nSubsidised healthcare: Anti\n\nGun control: Anti\n\nProtecting the environment: Neutral, mostly anti\n\nTax cuts for the wealthy: Pro af\n\nBook and Street Smarts[]\n\nBook Smarts: Lower than average (it took him years to betray Fortunato, and if he hadn't saved him he'd be the Corleone's whipping boy forever)\n\nStreet Smarts: Higher than average (took his organisation over from Fortunato easily and made it very powerful and allied to the Tattaglias)\n\nGallery[]\n\nTheme song[]"
