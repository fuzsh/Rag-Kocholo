        "text": "Landschlacht, Switzerland, Monday 2 June 2019\n\nThursday was Ascension Day, a holiday commemorated in both Thurgau Canton (where my wife works) and in St. Gallen Canton (where I work), and, to our mutual surprise, we found ourselves both free from the obligations of employment simultaneously.\n\nA miracle almost as spectacular as someone rising to Heaven in a cloud!\n\nWe decided to visit the Hundertwasser Exhibition at the Kunstmuseum in Lindau, Germany, by taking a train to Romanshorn, then another to Rorschach Harbour and then finally a boat across the Lake of Constance to Bavaria’s only port.\n\nThis post is not that story, though it is this story that inspires this post.\n\nIn thinking about how my wife and I interacted on yesterday’s day trip I invariably compare it to other times we have travelled together.\n\n(For previous posts about Porto, please see Canada Slim and the War of the Oranges as well as Canada Slim and the Station Sanctuary of this blog.)\n\nThe wife and I have been together for 23 years – she IS tough – and we always somehow muddle through.\n\nWe forgive one another.\n\nShe forgives me for being wrong and I forgive her for pointing out how truly wrong I can be!\n\nSadly, the amnesia of our conflicts is sometimes not as permanent as it should be….\n\nPorto, Portugal, Wednesday 25 July 2018\n\nIt is a warm day in this the most western country of Continental Europe and happily we are in a city we both like.\n\nPorto is more than a twee tourist trap of little more than pomp and ceremony, like Lisboa the Portuguese capital.\n\nPorto is Portugal’s Chicago, a busy commercial centre, whose fascination lies in its riverside setting and day-to-day life.\n\nMake no mistake there are sites in Porto worth seeing….\n\nThe riverside barrio of Ribeira with waterfront cafés and restuarants\n\nThe landmark Clérigos Tower\n\nThe Sé, Porto’s cathedral\n\nThe contemporary art gallery and park at the Fondacao de Serralves\n\nThe port wine lodges across the Douro River in Vila Nova de Gaia\n\nA Douro River cruise\n\nThe bridges that span the Douro: the Ponte Dom Luis I, the Ponte Infante, the Ponte María Pia\n\nThe Salào Árabe of the Palácio da Bosa\n\nAbove: Images of Porto\n\nWe had walked through the cathedral square the day previously, but this morning we were determined to explore all the sites that surrounded it.\n\nBut the morning began badly.\n\nA wardrobe malfunction made us return back to our B & B bedroom.\n\nThen we discovered the English language guidebook we were dependent upon had somehow gone missing.\n\nWe returned once again to the room, didn’t find it, so we were forced to find a bookshop and buy the book anew.\n\nWe made our way back to the Sé and then she discovered her German-language guidebook was not to be found with us.\n\nShe rushed back to the room and left me in the bright sunshine waiting her return.\n\nSet on a rocky outcrop, a couple of hundred metres from Sao Bento Station, Porto’s Cathedral, the Sé, commands fine views over the rooftops.\n\nI look up at the Sé’s North Tower, the one with the bell, and my eyes trace the worn bas-relief depicting a 14th century ship – a reminder of the earlier days of Portugal’s maritime epic, when sailors inched nervously down the west Saharan coastline not knowing what dangers were ahead.\n\nPerhaps my wife’s impatience with the morning was partially affected by our cathedral visit, for the Sé’s interior is a disquieting, disastrous doomsday design of Baroque blended with rough Romanesque and gargantuan Gothic architecture that has a spirit as gloomy as a bride and groom forced to wed whom they do not love.\n\nThe Sé is redeemed its ghastly first impressions once the senses escape into the cathedral cloisters, with walls lovingly draped with glowing azulejos and a grand staircase that ascends to the breathtaking chapterhouse for panoramic perspectives of the world from the windows.\n\nThe Sé is a holy seductress with a mask of beauty that barely conceals a darkness and depth that dares not expose itself to the light.\n\nThe Sé is not an intimate ingress of inspiration but rather a stern sorrow-laden scourge of sin and sacrifice designed to intimidate and threaten those unworthy of salvation.\n\nThe old dowager lacks teeth, her majesty missing, her glory gone, her gloom inescapable.\n\nThe wife returned to retrieve her German-language Müller Guide which I should have packed in my rucksack and didn’t.\n\nBoys, or men who eternally and internally remain boys, are book-bearing beasts of burden meant to be present but unobtrusive, to be seen but not heard.\n\nI sit in the sun with clear directives to accomplish as set by my bothered bride.\n\nI must plan our progress for the rest of the day.\n\nPlanning is never a prospect I embrace, for invariably my plans falls short of her perception of what a perfect plan entails.\n\nI soak the warmth of the sunbaked stone into my already weary bones and tired mind.\n\nI am unmoving and unmoved, immensely immovable.\n\nOn the south side of the Sé stretches the grandiose facade of the Paco Episcopal, the medieval archbishop’s palace, where the first King of Portugal was crowned and spent his wedding night.\n\nLike the Sé, the Paco is a mishmash of architectural elements: a Rococo stairway lined with carved granite flowers, Neoclassical doorways with Baroque decor, priceless furniture of luxurious lifestyle exposed to penny-pinching voyeuristic peasants, a lodging financed by a love of God with 17th century Indonesian cabinets hewed from blood and sweat, toil and tears hatefully demanded by harsh Portuguese taskmasters, religious paintings ironically produced in the secular scene of the first Portuguese Republic (1911 – 1956).\n\nThe Palace does not intice nor excite me.\n\nBut the notion of politics and history does, as I read A.H. de Oliveira Marques’ A Very Short History of Portugal and I wonder, as I often do, at what compels a man to demand better from those who would rule him.\n\nThe reckless courage that is required to speak truth to power and demand justice from the unjust has always fascinated me.\n\nI am a foreigner living in Switzerland and though my lot as a Canadian is far more fortunate than that of other nationalities exiled here, there does exist inequalities and injustices enforced by the Swiss upon those who were not born in the Helvetian Republic.\n\nJust to name a few: taxation without any or only minor representation, difficulty to find employment matching the expat’s experience and the unnecessary requirement that rejects qualifications not obtained within Switzerland, the blatant racial and religious profiling done at border crossings by unsympathetic customs pitbull police, the sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant, xenophobia encouraged by the eternally re-elected party in power, the bureaucracy that is bathed with greed and complexity, the fortress mentality of a nation determined to remain neutral yet one that profits from the spoils of war, a people who confuse quality of life by quantity of franks in silent bank vaults and wonder why having it all isn’t so much fun….\n\nI often want to climb the stairs to our apartment building’s roof and shout obscenities down upon the unsuspecting neighbourhood of Landschlacht.\n\nBut I lack the courage, for attention garnered may mean expulsion, and, for better or worse, Switzerland has been my home for nine years.\n\nI am a whisper on the Internet, a voice without echo, in a world blind to everything but the square screen of the preset mobile device upon their palms.\n\nI think about what we could tour next.\n\nThe house behind the Sé at Rua de Dom Hugo 32 was once the home of the poet and writer Guerra Junquiero whose works reflected the revolutionay turmoil of the Republican era.\n\nToday the Casa Museu Guerra Junquiero exhibits the Iberian and Islamic art, the Seljuk pottery, glassware and glazed earthenwear that he had collected over his lifetime, in rooms that recapture the atmosphere of the poet’s last home.\n\nMy guidebooks speak of the Junquiero Museum but none lavishes praise upon it, primarily for the reason that all is written only in Portuguese.\n\nAbílio Manuel Guerra Junqueiro (1850 – 1923) was a Portuguese top civil servant, a member of the Portuguese House of Representatives, a journalist, author and poet.\n\nHis work helped inspire the creation of the Portuguese First Republic.\n\nJunqueiro wrote highly satirical poems criticizing conservatism, romanticism and the Church, leading up to the Portuguese Revolution of 1910.\n\nHe was one of Europe’s greatest poets.\n\nBorn in Freixo de Espada à Cinta, Trás-os-Montes, Portugal to José António Junqueiro Júnior, a supply trader and farmer, and wife Ana Maria Guerra.\n\nHis mother died when he was only three years old.\n\nHe completed his secondary studies in Bragança and at sixteen, he enrolled at the University of Coimbra to study theology.\n\nGuerra Junqueiro began his literary career in a promising way in Coimbra in the literary journal A Folha, directed by the poet João Penha, of which later he was editor.\n\nAbove: Bust of Joao Penha (1838 – 1919), Braga, Portugal\n\nHere Junquiero created friendly relations with some of the best writers and poets of his time, a group generally known as the Generation of 70.\n\nGuerra Junqueiro from a very young age began to manifest remarkable poetic talent, and already by 1867 his name was included among the most hopeful of the new generation of Portuguese poets.\n\nIn the same year, in the book entitled The Portuguese Aristarchus, appreciating the book Vozes Sem Echo (Voices without Echo), published in Coimbra in 1867 by Guerra Junqueiro, an auspicious future was already foreseen for its author.\n\nIn Porto, on the same date, another work appeared, Baptismo de Amor (Baptism of Love), accompanied by a preamble written by Camilo Castelo Branco.\n\nIn Coimbra, Junqueiro published the Lira dos quatorze anos (The Book of Fourteen Years), a volume of poetry, and the poem Mysticae nuptiae.\n\nIn Porto, in 1870 the Vitória da Franca (Victory of France) was published, then later republished in Coimbra in 1873.\n\nIn 1873, when a republic was proclaimed in Spain, Junquiero wrote the vehement poem À Espanha livre (To free Spain).\n\nJunqueiro concluded his study of law also in 1873.\n\nHe became secretary of the governors of Angra do Heroísmo, Azores, and later of Viana do Castelo.\n\nIn 1874 his poem A morte de D. Joao (The death of D. João) achieved great success.\n\nCamilo Castelo Branco dedicated an article to him in the Nights of Insomnia, and Oliveira Martins, in the magazine Arts and Letters.\n\nAbove: Camilo Castelo Branco (1825 – 1890)\n\nIn Lisbon, Junquiero was a contributor of prose and verse, for political and artistic journals, such as The Magic Lantern and António Maria, with the collaboration of drawings by Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro.\n\nIn 1875 Junquiero wrote O Crime, a poem on the murder of Ensign Palma de Brito, the poem Aos Veteranos da Liberdade (To the Veterans of Freedom) and the volume of Contos para a infancía (Tales for Childhood).\n\nIn Diário de Notícias (The Daily News) he also published the poem Fiel e Na Ferra da Ladra (Fiel and the Story of Feira da Ladra).\n\nIn 1878 he published in Lisbon the poem Tragédia infantil.\n\nJunquiero collaborated to several periodical publications, namely: Atlantida (1915-1920), Branco e Negro (1896-1898), Brazil Portugal (1899-1914) (1884-1885), The Press, The Universal Illustration (1884-1885), The Portuguese Illustration (1885-1891), Sunday’s Newspaper (1881-1888), The Reading (1894-1896), Light and Life (1879), The West (1878-1915), Renaissance (1878-1879), The Pantheon (1880-1881), The Portuguese Republic (1901-1911), Azulejos (1907-1909), in the Tourism magazine, begun in 1916 and in the newspaper O Azeitonense (1919-1920).\n\nA great part of the poetic compositions of Guerra Junqueiro is reunited in the volume A Musa Em Férias (The Muse on Vacation), published in 1879.\n\nThis year he also wrote the poem O Melro (O Blackbird), which was later included in A Velhice do Padre Eterno (The Old Age of the Eternal Father) of 1885.\n\nIdílios e Sátrias (Idylls and Satires) was a translated and collected volume of short stories by Hans Christian Andersen and others.\n\nAbove: Hans Christian Andersen (1805 – 1875)\n\nAfter a stay in Paris, apparently for treatment of digestive disease contracted during his stay in the Azores, Junquiero published in 1885, in Porto, A Velhice do Padre Eterno (The Old Age of the Eternal Father), a work that provoked bitter retorts by the clerical opinion, represented in the press, among others, by the canon José Joaquim de Sena Freitas.\n\nAbove: José Joaquim de Sena Freitas (1840 – 1913)\n\nControversial with regard to religion, other writings of anticlerical nature by its author have been found in periodical publications like The Lucta and The Light (1919 -1921).\n\nWhen the conflict with England over the “pink map“, which culminated in the British Ultimatum of 11 January 1890, Guerra Junqueiro became deeply interested in this national crisis and wrote Finis Patriae (The end of country) and A Cancao do Ódio (The Song of Hate), to which Miguel Ângelo Pereira wrote the music.\n\n(The 1890 British Ultimatum was an ultimatum by the British government delivered on 11 January 1890 to Portugal.\n\nThe ultimatum forced the retreat of Portuguese military forces from areas which had been claimed by Portugal on the basis of historical discovery and recent exploration, but which the United Kingdom claimed on the basis of effective occupation.\n\nPortugal had attempted to claim a large area of land between its colonies of Mozambique and Angola including most of present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia and a large part of Malawi, which had been included in Portugal’s “Rose-coloured Map“.\n\nIt has sometimes been claimed that the British government’s objections arose because the Portuguese claims clashed with its aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway, linking its colonies from the south of Africa to those in the north.\n\nAbove: British colonies (pink), Portuguese colonies (purple)\n\nThis seems unlikely, as in 1890 Germany already controlled German East Africa, now Tanzania, and Sudan was independent under Muhammad Ahmad.\n\nRather, the British government was pressed into taking action by Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company was founded in 1888 south of the Zambezi and the African Lakes Company and British missionaries to the north.\n\nAbove: Cecil Rhodes (1853 – 1902)\n\nWhen Portugal acquiesced to British demands, it was considered as a breach of the Treaty of Windsor (1386) and seen as a national humiliation by republicans in Portugal, who denounced the government and the King as responsible for it.\n\nOn 14 January, the progressive government fell and the leader of the Regenerador Party, António de Serpa Pimentel, was chosen to form the new government.\n\nAbove: António de Serpa Pimental (1825 – 1900)\n\nThe progressivists then began to attack the King, voting for republican candidates in the March election of that year, questioning the colonial agreement then signed with the British.\n\nFeeding an atmosphere of near insurrection, on 23 March 1890, António José de Almeida, at the time a student in the University of Coimbra and, later on, President of the Republic, published an article entitled Bragança, o último, considered slanderous against the King and led to Almeida’s imprisonment.\n\nAbove: António José de Almeida (1866 – 1929)\n\nOn 1 April 1890, the explorer Silva Porto (1817 – 1890) immolated himself (set himself on fire), wrapped in a Portuguese flag in Kuito, Angola, after failed negotiations with the locals, attributed to the Ultimatum.\n\nThe death of the well-known explorer of the African continent generated a wave of national sentiment and his funeral was followed by a crowd in Porto.\n\nOn 11 April, Guerra Junqueiro’s poetic work Finis Patriae, a satire criticising the King, went on sale.\n\nIn the city of Porto, on 31 January 1891, a military uprising against the monarchy took place, constituted mainly by sergeants and enlisted ranks.\n\nThe rebels, who used the nationalist anthem A Portuguesa as their marching song, took the Paços do Concelho, from whose balcony, the republican journalist and politician Augusto Manuel Alves da Veiga proclaimed the establishment of the republic in Portugal and hoisted a red and green flag belonging to the Federal Democratic Centre.\n\nThe movement was, shortly afterwards, suppressed by a military detachment of the municipal guard that remained loyal to the government, resulting in 40 injured and 12 casualties.\n\nThe captured rebels were judged. 250 received sentences of between 18 months and 15 years of exile in Africa.\n\nA Portuguesa was forbidden.\n\nDespite its failure, the rebellion of 31 January 1891 was the first large threat felt by the monarchic regime and a sign of what would come almost two decades later.\n\nThe British Ultimatum was considered by Portuguese historians and politicians at that time to be the most outrageous and infamous action of the UK against its oldest ally.\n\nThe 1890 ultimatum was said to be one of the main causes for the Republican Revolution, which ended the monarchy in Portugal 20 years later (5 October 1910) and the Lisbon assassinations of the Portuguese king (Carlos I of Portugal) and the crown prince on 1 February 1908.\n\nAfter the British Ultimatum and the political crisis associated, he was involved in the political debate in 1891, writing some best sellers that had huge impact on public opinion, contributing to the discredit of the Portuguese monarchy and the success of the Portuguese Republican Party in the 1910 Portuguese Revolution.\n\nThe 5 October 1910 revolution was the overthrow of the centuries-old Portuguese monarchy and its replacement by the Portuguese Republic.\n\nIt was the result of a coup d’état organized by the Portuguese Republican Party.\n\nBy 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal was in deep crisis: British pressure on Portugal’s colonies, the royal family’s expenses, the assassination of the King and his heir in 1908, changing religious and social views, instability of the two political parties (Progressive and Regenerador), the dictatorship of João Franco and the regime’s apparent inability to adapt to modern times all led to widespread resentment against the Monarchy.\n\nThe proponents of the republic, particularly the Republican Party, found ways to take advantage of the situation.\n\nThe Republican Party presented itself as the only one that had a programme that was capable of returning to the country its lost status and place Portugal on the way of progress.\n\n(Why does this sound so familiar?)\n\n(Make Portugal great again?)\n\nAfter a reluctance of the military to combat the nearly two thousand soldiers and sailors that rebelled between 3 and 4 October 1910, the Republic was proclaimed at 9 o’clock of the next day from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho in Lisbon.\n\nAfter the revolution, a provisional government led by Teófilo Braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the Constitution in 1911 that marked the beginning of the First Republic.\n\nAbove: Joaquim Teofilo Fernandes Braga (1843 – 1924)\n\nAmong other things, with the establishment of the republic, national symbols were changed: the national anthem and the flag.\n\nThe revolution produced some civil and religious liberties, although there were no advances in women’s rights and in workers’ rights, unlike what had happened in other European countries.\n\nThe First Portuguese Republic (Portuguese: Primeira República Portuguesa; officially: República Portuguesa, Portuguese Republic) spans a complex 16-year period in the history of Portugal, between the end of the period of constitutional monarchy marked by the 5 October 1910 revolution and the 28 May 1926 coup d’état.\n\nThe sixteen years of the First Republic saw nine presidents and 44 ministries and has been described as consisting of “continual anarchy, government corruption, rioting and pillage, assassinations, arbitrary imprisonment and religious persecution“.\n\nThe latter movement instituted a military dictatorship known as Ditadura Nacional (national dictatorship) that would be followed by the corporatist Estado Novo (new state) regime of António de Oliveira Salazar.\n\nAbove: António de Oliveria Salazar (1889 – 1970)\n\nKidnapped and driven off into darkness after Salazar snatched power in 1928, Portugal was absent from the Second World War and through most of the 20th century was economically isolated and politically smothered.\n\nPortugal is rich with potential and a certain backwardness adds to the charm.\n\nIt is easy to fall in love with this fair land on this final edge of the world, though it could use a bit more self-confidence and a lot more marketing of itself and its heritage.)\n\nJunquiero married Filomena Augusta da Silva Neves on 10 February 1880.\n\nThe couple had two children: Maria Isabel Guerra Junqueiro on 11 November 1880 and Júlia Guerra Junqueiro in 1881.\n\nHe died in Lisbon at the age of 72.\n\nIn 1940 Junqueiro’s daughter donated his estate in Porto that became the Guerra Junqueiro Museum.\n\nChronology of Guerra Junquiero:\n\n1850: Born in Ligares, Freixo de Espada a Cinta\n\n1864: The Book of Fourteen Years\n\n1866: Studies theology at the University of Coimbra;\n\n1867:

given by Wikipedia and Google, but who was the man?\n\nHow should we categorize him?\n\nShould we?\n\nCan we?\n\nWas he a mere bureaucratic drone who dabbled in poetry?\n\nOr a poet who dabbled in government work?\n\nDid his writing incite a revolution or did it merely capture the spirit of the times?\n\nAs I sit in the sun my mind should be planning our travel itinerary for the day so to placate my wife upon her return.\n\nBut instead I think of Junqueiro and his Museum I won’t mention to the wife, already unhappy with the start of our first full day in Porto.\n\nI think instead of the power of the printed word and of the impossibility, even through the written expression of a writer’s thoughts, of truly knowing another person.\n\nThough it may be acknowledged that it is surely difficult for us to know a Portuguese poet long dead from nearly a century ago, it must also be acknowledged that even those we presently love remain unsolved mysteries to us.\n\n“We are all patchwork, and so shapeless and diverse in composition that each bit, each moment, plays its own game.\n\nAnd there is as much difference between us and ourselves as between us and others.” (Michel de Montaigne, Essais)\n\nAbove: Michel de Montaigne (1533 – 1592)\n\n“Each of us is several, is many, is a profusion of selves.\n\nSo that the self who disdains his surroundings is not the same as the self who suffers or takes joy in them.\n\nIn the vast colony of our being, there are many species of people who think and feel in different ways.” (Fernando Pessoa, Livro do Desassossego)\n\nAbove: Fernando Pessoa (1888 – 1935)\n\nI think of the mix of contradictory emotions that fill me anticipating my wife’s return, both eagerly awaiting and decidedly dreading her return.\n\nI think of how each of us carries around inside ourselves whole worlds.\n\nI am more than a sweaty balding head.\n\nI am also a tear-softened soul.\n\nI think of how much life I might still have before me, how open my future might be, how much could still happen, how much there might still be experienced.\n\nCan anyone see beneath my mask that I am a mix of modesty and immodesty, of conformity and eccentricity, that within me lies a silent rage aimed at a pompous world, an unbending defiance against the world of show-offs whose only real accomplishment is their accidental connectivity to realms of power and prestige denied the average man?\n\nI sit in the sun, uncertain of what to suggest next, unwilling to face my wife’s disapproval at what she will perceive to be laziness instead of confusion.\n\nPerhaps we travel not to experience another world, but to flee from our own experience, simultaneously running to and from life.\n\nPortugal is a land always in the shadows, a land of foggy fishing villages and tiny hamlets set deep in cork forests.\n\nIt is a land of mournful fado wailing and legendary sightings of the Virgin Mary.\n\nCritics, most of them Portuguese, call Portugal the graveyard of ambition, the kingdom of mediocrity, where the national pastime is complaining and the ambitious leave.\n\nAs late as 2005, Portugal still had 13% of women who couldn’t read, less than 50% of children who made it to high school and was the lowest earner of the EU.\n\nPorto, historically the country’s wine distribution centre, is said to be the hardest working part of Portugal:\n\n“Lisbon plays, Porto pays, Coimbra prays.”\n\nI want to visit the archbishop’s palace and the poet’s place, for I take great comfort from the calm of everything past.\n\nSo often I am alone with my thoughts, even when surrounded by a cacophony of chaotic conversations convulsing from a crowd.\n\nMy mind is sealed and my tongue falters in failing to express the vaulted thought.\n\nMy wife speaks and my ears hear and my heart listens, but my mind is my own, adrift on its own adventure, lost in its own odyssey.\n\nI am reminded of my reading on the flight the day before, of the writing of Amadeu Prado, as invented by Swiss writer Pascal Mercier in his book Night Train to Lisbon:\n\n“Of the thousand experiences we have, we find language for one experience at most and even this one merely by chance and without the care it deserves.\n\nBuried under all the mute experiences are those unseen ones that give our life its form, its colour and its melody.\n\nThen, when we turn to these treasures, as archaeologists of the soul, we discover how confusing they are.\n\nThe object of contemplation refuses to stand still, the words bounce off the experience and in the end, pure contradictions stand on the paper.”\n\nWhat benefit is there in being the archaeologist of one’s self, to dig for buried experience?\n\n“Given that we can live only a small part of what there is in us, what happens to the rest?”\n\nThe Wikipedia photo of Junquiero shows a man of intelligence and self-confidence and boldness.\n\nOr is what I perceive only an observation of qualities I wish I possessed beneath the mask I wear?\n\nYet the contradiction that is a man’s character sometimes wonders could something be made different from my life, that there may be more to me than anyone knows.\n\nIn the centre of the city, in the centre of my life, I sit in the sun in the square of the cathedral.\n\nI reflect how we live in an age rushing through a timeless universe only appreciated when contemplated quietly and calmly.\n\nI think of the life of a man I never knew, a poet whose words I never read, who wrote in a language I never spoke.\n\nIs Junqueiro only identifiable by what he did and the words he wrote?\n\nWas there more to the man than anyone besides himself could ever possibly know?\n\n“Is there a mystery under the surfaces of human action?\n\nOr are human beings utterly what their obvious acts indicate?”\n\nThe words that Junquiero wrote, the words I have never read, are they expressions of eternally, essentially, the same things others have said before?\n\n“Words are so horribly frayed and threadbare, worn out by being used millions of times.\n\nDo they still have any meaning?\n\nNaturally, the exchange of words functions.\n\nPeople act on them.\n\nThey laugh and cry.\n\nThey go left or right.\n\nThe waiter brings the coffee or tea.\n\nBut that’s not what I want to ask.\n\nThe question is:\n\nAre they still an expression of thoughts?\n\nOr only effective sounds that drive people here and there because the worn grooves of babble incessantly flash?“\n\nPerhaps I should follow the advice of Marcus Aurelius when he writes in his Meditations:\n\n“Do wrong to thyself.\n\nDo wrong to thyself, my soul, but later thou wilt no longer have the opportunity of respecting and honouring thyself.\n\nFor every man has but one life….\n\nThose who do not observe the impulses of their own minds must of necessity be unhappy.“\n\nAbove: Marble bust of Marcus Aurelius (121 – 180)\n\nShe returns to me still sitting in the sun, with little progress on the planning made.\n\nI imagine her thinking:\n\n“What is the point of having a husband if he does not do what he is told?”\n\nI imagine that she feels the weight of the world on her shoulders having a man about who is so completely useless at times.\n\nI smile foolishly and say pointless words to defend my pointlessness.\n\nI don’t mention Junquiero’s house and she never asks.\n\nI also know I would be frustrated being in a museum whose signage I couldn’t read, despite the unfair expectation that a Portuguese museum have any other language besides Portuguese for a poet unknown outside of Portugal.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, she plans for us.\n\nThe morning has been shot to hell, so lunch across the Douro River in Gaia might inspire us.\n\nLike the animal I am, I respond greedily to the prospect of food.\n\nI know there is no excuse for my behaviour and no words to justify it, so I don’t bother trying.\n\nAbove: Vila Nova de Gaia\n\nAs I rise to my feet, carefully – I am just recovering from an accident where I broke both my arms – I think of Prado who never existed and Junquiero who no longer exists, then I focus on matters at hand.\n\nThe universe may be timeless but our vacation time is not.\n\nBut reading Mercier’s novel and learning of Junquiero’s life has inspired me.\n\nI will ask when I can at random bookshops for the poems of Junquiero available in English translation.\n\nAbove: Livraria Lello, Porto\n\nI know that the rhythm and subtlity of his poetry will be inadequately conveyed in translation, but I also know the painfully slow process of translating the original Portuguese into English I understand will somehow destroy the passion with which I started to read.\n\nNonetheless there is too little poetry in my life and even the muse of love has her limits and I must make amends for this deficiency.\n\nI will return from the vacation and do the things I must do.\n\nWork where and when I can.\n\nMeet my obligations to others as best as I can.\n\nI will seek no evil to see, no evil to hear, no evil to speak.\n\nI remain a true husband, a good friend and loyal employee.\n\nBut my mind is my own and my words, as imprecise as they can be, will seek to speak my mind.\n\nPerhaps through reading poetry I shall find the means to express myself.\n\nI am my own archaeologist of my own self.\n\nSo much generated from simply sitting in the sun.\n\nSources: Wikipedia / Google / Lonely Planet Portugal / Rough Guide Portugal / Pocket Rough Guide Porto / Matthew Hancock, Xenophobe’s Guide to the Portuguese / A.H. de

Catholic Church and both groups will call themselves Christian.\n\nAnd as the Earth spins around the Sun, from the Dark Continent of Africa to the Canadian tundra, Christians will kneel on this day to receive the elements of their own version of the eternal Eucharist as written in the Bible that speaks of how God sent His Son whose sacrifice somehow saved our wretched souls and whose resurrection conquered death for all of us, despite death being our destiny.\n\nIn Jerusalem and parts of the planet where the Great Diaspora has led them over centuries, others, wrapped in the prayer shawls that their ancestors wore in the desert, recite the Torah, as their Rabbi lovingly guides a wand across sacred text that Yahweh spoke to His Chosen People.\n\nAnd within the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, and anywhere where the Qu’ran reigns the mind, five times a day, the faithful prostrate themselves towards Mecca, towards Mohammed’s holy city, and show their devotion to Allah, who also remains God the Father of Christianity and Yahweh of the Jews and yet is unrecognizable as the same God of Abraham said to be the originator of all three great religions.\n\nSame deity, different names, different practices, same intolerance too often seen by those who claim this deity as their own.\n\nIn a tiny house by the Ganges River at the foot of the Himalayas, a Hindu Swami will not speak today, but will continue his devotional silence that, with the exception of three days each year, he has kept for years.\n\nIn Yangon, the monks of Shwedagon sit alone and together with the eternal in the tranquil silence and privacy of their Buddhist shrine, as do the Zen monks in Kyoto, spending most of the day sitting immovable in the lotus position, as they seek to plumb with absolute absorption the Buddha-nature that lies at the centre of their being.\n\nWhat a freaky fellowship, an odd misplaced madness, this is, this seeking of something divine that defies description or definition, voices raised in desperate disparate ways, sacrificing precious life to a God of life that cannot be proven not to exist.\n\nSuch strange ethereal harmony, each faith claiming superiority over every other belief, no individual religion understanding the others, and yet united in lifting their voices to the heavens in the hopes that what binds the universe will spare a moment for those who are naught more than carbonated stardust.\n\nAre the faithful foolish or the unbelieving unredeemable?\n\nWe cannot know.\n\nAll we can do is try and listen carefully, with full attention to each voice as it in its turn addresses the divine that lies within and without us.\n\nReligions wrap the globe in their comfort, with histories stretching back into the forgotten mists of time, that still motivates more people today than ever before.\n\nNothing unites us more nor divides us more than religion does.\n\nWho should we follow?\n\nWhat should we believe?\n\nShould Christians worship in ornate cathedrals bedecked with icons or consider even steeples divine desecrations?\n\nHow should Muslims decide between Sunni and Shi’ite or feel about Sufism?\n\nMust a Jew be orthodox to call himself a true Jew?\n\nAnd let us wonder as Buddhists ponder different traditions of Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana philosophies.\n\nMillions live by a faith.\n\nMore than three quarters of the world’s population consider that they belong to a religion, however little or much they do about it.\n\nCommunities of people who share practices and beliefs gather in special buildings for worship or meditation and seek to live lives in special ways in the world.\n\nWhether we care to acknowledge it or not, religion has been the resource and inspiration for virtually all the most enduring art, architecture, music, drama, dance and poetry that the world has known, in search and expression of that which endures when all else passes away.\n\nWe must decide if faith has relevance in these digital days, our modern minds, our computerized lives.\n\nAs every religion mixes universal truths with local peculiarities we must lift out the former from the latter and embrace that which speaks to what is generically human in us all.\n\nThis is not easy for the irreverent, for religion is rich in rites and laden in legends.\n\nThis is not simple for those whose lives are reigned by rationalism, for the claim that the universal principles of faith are more important than rites and rituals is like contending that the trunk of a tree is more important than the branches, leaves or roots of that tree.\n\nI know that when I seek to understand the religious impulse, that I myself lack, this is akin to trying to comprehend the incomprehensible.\n\nThe mind that is mine struggles to grasp how Hindu’s holy Kali Temple in Calcutta revers two million cows to the point of nuisance while fakirs offer their bodies to bedbugs as sacrifice.\n\nI find myself conflicted between the stillness of Bethlehem and department stores blaring “Silent Night” from stereos above plastic reindeer and overweight Santas.\n\nI seek to define the divine amidst images of crucified Christs and chocolate bunnies and Easter eggs.\n\nI wallow in a mire of confusion as to how Crusades can be Christian or Jihads holy, or how a God of love co-exists with witch slaughter in Salem, monkey trials in Tennessee and Grand Inquisitions in Spain.\n\nI, like billions before me and aeons after me, seek the meaning to my existence in the hope that my short span of life has worth.\n\nI am reminded of a Faustian fable of a man who climbed to the top of a mountain and seized hold of the Truth.\n\nSatan, suspecting sedition from this mortal upstart, directed a demon to tail the determined seeker.\n\nWhen the demon reported with alarm the man’s success, Satan was not in the least bothered by the bulletin.\n\n“Don’t worry.“, Satan yawned.\n\n“I will tempt him to institutionalize the Truth.”\n\nThe empowering theological and metaphysical truth of faith is inspirational, but the religious institutions built around this truth are often not.\n\nReligion is constituted of people with their inbuilt frailities, vices and virtues.\n\nWhen the vices get compounded by masses, the results are horrifying to the point where one might suggest that faith should be left outside the hands of humanity.\n\nBut faith without the faithful would have left no mark upon humanity’s history, for better or for worse.\n\nHad faith remained as only aloof disembodied insight and had not embraced institutions and rituals, then faith could not have established traction on history or upon men’s souls.\n\nWhat is important is to not get lost in the smoke and ceremony of rite and ritual, but instead we need to sift religion for the truths they try to preserve, the wisdom that maintains our world.\n\nAs T.S. Eliot so wisely phrased it:\n\n“Where is the knowledge that is lost in information?\n\nWhere is the wisdom that is lost in knowledge?”\n\nAbove: Thomas Stearns Eliot (1888 – 1965)\n\nI categorically reject the premise that one religion is superior to another, for it is this comparison that is the most odious aspect of all institutions, for, as Arnold Toynbee observed:\n\n“There is no one alive today who knows enough to say with confidence whether one religion has been greater than all others.”\n\nAbove: Arnold Toynbee (1852 – 1883)\n\nIt must be admitted that though I seek to embrace the world, I am incorrigibly myself and I know that the tale I am about to tell might be quite differently written had I been a Burmese Buddhist, a Turkish Muslim, a Nepalese Hindu, a Serbian Orthodox, a Swiss Catholic or a Polish Jew instead of a Canadian humanist with delusions of fluency.\n\nWe live in a world of wonders.\n\nLands across the planet are our neighbours, China is around the corner, the Middle East is our backyard, my younger colleagues and close companions with backpacks go everywhere, while I – who often remain at home in this wee hamlet of Landschlacht – have access to an endless parade of books and videos and visitors from abroad.\n\nIt isn’t so much that East meets West as it is humanity is being flung at one another, hurled across distances at jet speed, information invading our impatient intelligence within the breath between atoms.\n\nDiogenes, twenty-five hundred years ago, exclaimed:\n\n“I am not an Athenian or a Greek but a citizen of the world.”\n\nAbove: Diogenes (412 – 323 BC)\n\nToday we have the possibility to not only think of ourselves by the nations we found ourselves born in, but rather we have the opportunity to judge our heartbeat by the pulse of the planet.\n\nWe need to understand the faiths of others if we are to meet them as allies or antagonists, so that we can avoid military engagement through diplomacy.\n\nWe need to understand one another through our faiths so we can enjoy the world vision it offers us.\n\nOr put another way….\n\nWhat do they know of England, who only England know?\n\nHow can we truly understand our beliefs if we never question them by comparison with others?\n\nHow truly enriching our lives become when we truly understand what belonging means to the Japanese, to sense with a Burmese grandmother what passes in life and what endures, to comprehend with the Hindu that our personalities mask the Infinite within, to follow the paradox of a Zen monk who assures you that everything is sacred but refrains from acts that are unholy, to feel the comfort that confession offers the devout Catholic….\n\nFor as language opens the mind to understanding other people, faith enlarges the heart to compassion and love for humanity.\n\nTrue faith, not a dull habit but a living passion, confronts the individual with the momentous wisdom that life can offer.\n\nFaith calls a soul to the highest adventure, a journey across the landscape of the human spirit.\n\nIt is the siren call to confront reality as it is, to master the self.\n\nIt is a lonely journey, a personal quest….\n\n“A sharpened edge of a razor, hard to traverse,\n\nA difficult path is this – the poets declare!”\n\n(Alfred Toynbee, Civilization on Trial)\n\nLos Alamos, New Mexico, 16 July 1945\n\nToday is the day that the chain reaction of scientific discoveries that began at the University of Chicago and focused here at Site Y has reached the final culmination.\n\nNo one has been more instrumental in this project’s achievement than the director of the Los Alamos Project, Robert Oppenheimer.\n\nAll eyes are upon him closely this morning.\n\nAbove: Robert Oppenheimer (1904 – 1967)\n\n“He grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off.\n\nHe scarcely breathed.\n\nHe held on to a post to steady himself.\n\nWhen the announcer shouted “Now!”, there came this tremendous burst of light, followed by the deep-growling roar of the explosion, his face relaxed in an expression of tremendous relief.”\n\nThe first atomic bomb is a success.\n\nWhat flashed through Oppenheimer’s mind during those moments were two lines from the Bhagavad-Gita in which the speaker is God:\n\n“I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds;\n\nWaiting that hour that ripens to their doom.”\n\n(The Bhagavad Gita is a discourse between Krishna and Arjuna set in a chariot at the start of the Mahabharata War.)\n\nThus began an age in which violence and peace continue to confront each other more fatefully than ever before.\n\nIn India, Gandhi’s name became, in the middle of the 20th century, the counterpoint to those of Stalin and Hitler, but not just for the British withdrawl from the Subcontinent in peace, but, more importantly, for his lowering a barrier even more formidable than that of race in America.\n\nGandhi renamed India’s untouchables harijan – God’s people – and raised them to human stature.\n\nIn doing so, Gandhi provided the non-violent strategy and the inspiration for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s civil rights movement in the United States.\n\nGandhi’s inspiration was revealed in his autobiography:\n\n“Such power as I possess for working in the political field has derived from my experiments in the spiritual field.\n\nTruth is the sovereign principle and the Bhagavad-Gita is the book par excellence for the knowledge of truth.”\n\nAbove: “Mahatma“(“the Venerable“) Mohandas Gandhi (1869 – 1948)\n\nOn a grey day in October 2017, a stone’s throw from the grim North Circular, that drab ring road that encircles London’s northern suburbs of Neasden, I would follow my curiosity and thirst for truth eternal to a Hindu temple.\n\nA temple both alien and appropriate in the homeland of English, in the heart of an empire that once dominated my own birth country of Canada and whose sovereign remains our head of state, from a religion with roots in the land of India – that living coalition of religions and languages where one billion congregate and of which 80% call themselves Hindu – with 30 million adherants dispersed throughout the world.\n\nOn that day I would visit the largest traditional Hindu temple outside India (as recognized by Guinness World Records), Neasden’s 8th Wonder of the World, the Crown Jewel of Hinduism, one of Reader’s Digest‘s 70 Wonders of the Modern World, Time Out London‘s Seven Wonders….\n\nThe BAPS Shri Swamirayan Mandir Hindu temple.\n\nIt would not make me a Hindu nor make me feel any more knowledgeable about Hinduism than I felt before, but, nevertheless, my morning visit left impressions with me that still remain….\n\nLondon, England, 26 October 2017\n\nShri Swaminarayan was not my first visit to a Hindu temple (and I have a feeling that it won’t be my last), for on a visit to Singapore in the spring of 2014, en route to the Perth wedding of friends in Western Australia, I visited Sri Mariamman Temple, paradoxically located in the Lion City’s Chinatown district.\n\nSri Mariamman is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore and I still remember the temple’s incredible, brightly coloured gopuram (tower) above the entrance, covered in kitsch plaster images of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and (Oppenheimer’s) Shiva the Destroyer, as sacred cow sculptures graze the boundary walls.\n\nI had a three-day stopover in Singapore and in the process of trying to cram so much into my consciousness in a very short time Sri Mariammen is a blurred memory amongst many that I saw during my short sojourn in the city-state.\n\nI recall also seeing the Peranakan Museum, the Raffles Hotel, the Chinatown Heritage Centre, the Buddha Tooth Relic Museum, the Taoist Temple of Heavenly Happiness (Thian Hock Temp), Little India, Changi Prison, the Night Safari, Sentosa Island and Pulau Ubin.\n\nI remember Little India, not for the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple with images of Kali, wearing a garland of skulls and ripping out the insides of her victims, but rather for the Bismallah Biryani Restaurant’s mutton kebab.\n\nHindu temples in Singapore were, for me at the time of my visit, only part of a tightly squeezed adventure and a list of must-sees rather than research for right or righteous religion.\n\n(Thinking of Singapore and Perth I see future posts about them….)\n\nI might not have bothered with London’s BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Manhir at all had not my wife purchased for us two London Passes, offering free entry to over 60 attractions, as well as free public transport on buses, tubes and trains, and strongly suggested I use mine as much as possible during the days of the medical conference she would attend that week.\n\nToday would be the first day that I would view London unaccompanied by my spouse during the week.\n\nIt was not my first visit to London….\n\n(I had spent a couple of days on my own in 1995, mostly walking along the Thames rather than doing much exploring as a lack of money dogged my days then.\n\nI spent a day and an evening in 2010 with my good friend Iain and his beautiful companion – now his spouse since the aforementioned Perth wedding – Samantha, visiting Greenwich Observatory and seeing the show Avenue Q in the Theatre District, with time to enjoy life walking well and dining fine.)\n\nBut this was the first time I would attempt to deliberately explore London on my own without having to worry excessively about money.\n\nI approached the Project alphabetically from the pages of the London Pass Guide.\n\nAs the ArcelorMittal Orbit (London’s tallest sculpture), the All Hallows by the Tower Church (where William Penn was baptized, John Quincy Adams was married and Archbishop William Laud was buried), Apsley House (with the oldest surviving grand piano in the UK) and the Arsenal Stadium Tour & Museum – (Football was never so crucial a sport to me as Canadian ice hockey or American baseball.)(Iain, an Everton fan, would never have forgiven me such a sacrilege.) – didn’t strike me as “must-see-before-I-die” / bucket list attractions, BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Manhir seemed the place to start.\n\nAnd I must admit the attraction was attractively described:\n\n“BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir is a masterpiece of traditional Hindu design and exquisite Indian workmanship in the heart of London.\n\nUsing 5,000 tonnes of Italian and Indian marble and the finest Bulgarian limestone, it was hand-carved in India before being assembled in London in just 2.5 years.\n\nSince it opened in 1995, this renowned place of worship has attracted over 400,000 visitors every year.\n\nCome and marvel at the intricate carvings, experience a traditional Hindu prayer ceremony, or learn about the world’s oldest living faith.“\n\nI took the Tube from our hotel’s neighbourhood way out to Stonebridge Park Station and wandered lost for an hour until I reached Neasden in the London Borough of Brent.\n\nIt may seem at first thought that Neasden is an unusual spot for a Hindu temple, but then Neasden has always been an unusual spot in its own right.\n\nNeasden’s name meant “nose hill” and referred to the small promontory at the western end of the Dollis Hill Ridge upon which the hamlet sat.\n\nThe countryside hamlet land was once owned by St. Paul’s Cathedral and consisted of only several small buildings around a green near the site of the present Neasden roundabout until the mid-19th century.\n\nIn 1823 Neasden was no more than a “retired hamlet” with six cottages, four large farms, a pub and a smithy gathered around the green.\n\nThe Brent Reservoir (aka the Welsh Harp Reservoir from the name of the aforementioned pub) between Henden and Wembley Park, that straddles the boundary between the Boroughs of Brent and Barnet, was completed in 1835 and was breached in 1841.\n\nThe breaking of the dam on the River Brent resulted in folks dying and many fields and meadows under water.\n\nToday the Brent Reservoir is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and home to the great crested grebe, the gadwall, the shoveler, the common pochard, the tufted duck and the common tern, as well as eight species of warbler – a total of 253 species of bird life.\n\nAs well the Reservoir possesses 31 species of butterfly, 15 species of dragonflies and is also the residence of grey squirrels, red foxes and bats.\n\nIn 1960 the Reservoir hosted the Women’s European Rowing Championships.\n\nToday the Welsh Harp Open Space surely sees not only rowboats and sailboats but those of the Hindu faith enjoying the magic of this unglamourous corner of suburban tranquillity.\n\n(Not fishermen though, as fishing is strictly forbidden.)\n\nIn 1873 Neasden had a populace of 110 and the horse was the main form of transport.\n\nAs London grew, the demand for horses in the capital soared, so in the second half of the 19th century Neasden farms focused on rearing and providing horses for the City.\n\nTown work was exhausting and unhealthy for the horses….\n\n(It ain’t so wonderful for humans either.)\n\nIn 1886 the RSPCA formed a committee to set up the Home of Rest for Horses with grounds in Neasden, where, for a small fee, town horses were allowed to graze in the open for a few weeks.\n\nThe urbanization of Neasden began with the arrival of the railway.\n\nThe first railway running through Neasden was opened for goods traffic in 1868 with passenger services following soon after.\n\nIn the 1890s change led to a conscious effort to create a village atmosphere.\n\nAt this time, the Spotted Dog became a social centre for local people.\n\nBy 1891 Neasden had a population of 930, half of whom lived in the village.\n\nDespite the presence of the village in the west, it was the London end that grew fastest.\n\nIn 1893 the Great Central Railway got permission to join up its main line from Nottingham with the Metropolitan.\n\nThe Great Central set up a depot south of the line at Neasden and built houses for its workers.\n\nThe Great Central village was a “singularly isolated and self-contained community” with its own school and single shop, Branch No. 1 of the North West London Co-operative Society.\n\nIt is now part of a conservation area.\n\nThere was considerable sporting rivalry between the two railway estates and a football match was played every Good Friday.\n\nBy the 1930s the two railways employed over 1,000 men.\n\nNeasden Hospital was built in 1894 and closed in 1986.\n\nApart from the railways, Neasden was dominated by agriculture until just before the First World War.\n\nIn 1911, Neasden’s population had swelled to 2,074.\n\nBy 1913, light industry at Church End had spread up Neasden Lane as far as the station.\n\nIn the 1920s, the building of the North Circular Road, a main arterial route round London, brought another wave of development.\n\nIt opened in 1923.\n\nThe 1924 British Empire Exhibition led to road improvements and the introduction of new bus services.\n\nTogether with the North Circular Road, it paved the way for a new residential suburb at Neasden.\n\nThe last farm in Neasden was built over in 1935.\n\nThe Ritz Cinema opened in 1935, and Neasden Shopping Parade was opened in 1936, considered then to be the most up-to-date in the area.\n\nAll of Neasden’s older houses were demolished during this period, except for The Grange.\n\nThe Spotted Dog was rebuilt in mock-Tudor style.\n\nIndustries sprung up in the south of the area, and by 1949, Neasden’s population was over 13,000.\n\nThe Post Office Research Station was located nearby in Dollis Hill.\n\nThere the Colossus computers, among the world’s first, were built in 1943-1944, and underneath them the Paddock Wartime Cabinet Rooms had been constructed in 1939.\n\nNeasden Power Station, which was built to provide power for the Metropolitan Railway, was closed and demolished in 1968.\n\nThe post-war history of Neasden is one of steady decline.\n\nLocal traffic congestion problems necessitated the building of an underpass on the North Circular Road that effectively cut Neasden in half and had a disastrous effect on the shopping centre by making pedestrian access to it difficult.\n\nThe decline in industry through the 1970s also contributed to the area’s decline.\n\nBut nonetheless Neasden has somehow survived, largely due to a succession of vibrant immigrant communities keeping the local economy afloat.\n\nNeasden Depot continues to be the main storage and maintenance depot for the London Underground’s Metropolitan line (and is also used by trains of the Jubilee line).\n\nIt is London Underground’s largest depot and as such it is a major local employer.\n\nThe Grange Tavern (previously called The Old Spotted Dog) on Neasden Lane was closed in the 1990s and demolished to make way for a block of flats, bringing to an end the inn that had stood there for around two centuries.\n\nAnother old pub, The Pantiles, which stood on the North Circular Road was converted into a McDonald’s restaurant.\n\nThe Swedish furniture retailer, IKEA opened its second UK outlet in Neasden in 1988.\n\nOn 14 July 1993, in an MI5 anti-terrorist operation, a Provisional IRA man was arrested in his car on Crest Road carrying a 20 lb bomb.\n\nIt came just over a year after the Staples Corner bombing just over 500 yards away, which devastated the junction.\n\nIn 1995, Neasden became the unlikely home of the biggest Hindu temple outside India: the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, known locally as the Neasden Temple.\n\nIn 2004, the shopping centre area was partially redeveloped by the Council in an effort to reverse its fortunes.\n\nThe Grange, which had housed a museum about the people of Brent, was closed by the Council in 2005.\n\nThe 2004 redevelopment proved to be unpopular with local businesses, as it changed the layouts of parking, thus forcing customers and local trade to pass by due to the parking restrictions of the redevelopment.\n\nNeasden was once nicknamed “the loneliest village in London” and “God’s own borough“.\n\nNeasden has achieved considerable notoriety thanks to the British satirical magazine, Private Eye.\n\nSince early in its history (when the magazine was actually printed in Neasden) the magazine has used Neasden as an exemplar of the suburban environment in pieces parodying current events, personalities, and social mores (for example, the University of Neasden).\n\nSpoof sports reports in the magazine usually feature the perennially unsuccessful football team, Neasden F.C. with their manager, “ashen-faced” Ron Knee and their only two supporters, Sid and Doris Bonkers.\n\nNeasden was one of the locations in the TV documentary Metro-land.\n\nIn it, Sir John Betjeman described Neasden as “home of the gnome and the average citizen” (the former a reference to the preponderance of gnome statuettes in suburban front gardens, but possibly also a nod in the direction of the Eye’s fictional proprietor, Lord Gnome).\n\nBackground music was provided by William Rushton’s recording of Neasden (1972):\n\n(“Neasden\n\nYou won’t be sorry that you breezed in.“)\n\nIn a celebrated spoof of the Early Music phenomenon which grew enormously in the late 1960s, Neasden was selected by BBC Radiophonic Workshop composer David Cain as the home of a fictional ensemble dedicated to historically-informed performances on authentic musical instruments from an indeterminate number of centuries ago.\n\nIt was thus that in 1968, listeners to BBC Radio 3 were given a recital by the Schola Polyphonica Neasdeniensis whose members performed on the equally fictional Shagbut, Minikin and Flemish Clackett.\n\nAthletico Neasden was an amateur football team of mostly Jewish players, which played in the Maccabi (Southern) Football League in the 1970s and 1980s and were named after the place, though they didn’t actually play in the area.\n\nThe team eventually merged with North West Warriors to form North West Neasden.\n\nDavid Sutherland’s children’s novel A Black Hole in Neasden reveals a gateway to another planet in a Neasden back garden.\n\nDiana Evans’s 2006 novel 26a details the experiences of twin girls of Nigerian and British descent growing up in Neasden.\n\nWillie Hamilton reported in ‘My Queen and I‘ that the Victorian Order medals were made on a production line in Neasden from used railway lines.\n\nA pirate radio station, Dread Broadcasting Corporation, credited as Britain’s first black music radio station, was broadcast from a Neasden garden between 1981 – 1984.\n\nIn the Dangermouse episode “Planet of the Machines“, Dangermouse and Penfold arrive back in Neasden from the planet in the Baron’s space time machine.\n\nKonnie Huq and Matt Cooke from BBC TV present the Your News programme from Neasden.\n\nSo all of this begs the question:\n\nWhat in the name of Krishna is a Hindu temple doing here?\n\nPerhaps there is wisdom to be found in the old Hindu proverb:\n\n“The lotus blooms in splendour, but its roots lie in the dirt.”\n\nLet me be frank.\n\nNeasden is a glum place, especially after the glamour of the City has been seen, thus the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir seems to rise majestically above the dismal, between-the-world-wars housing like a welcome oasis of sight.\n\nSo sudden and grandiose does the Mandir appear that the viewer wonders whether it is a mirage, a shimmering dream, conjured up by one’s overactive imagination.\n\nHere in London’s loneliest village is an experience of India’s glorious tradition and faith, a legacy that seems to have evolved over millennia rather than appearing miraculously on the landscape in a mere 30 months.\n\nSince the Mandir opened in 1995, this renowned place of worship has attracted over half a million visitors a year.\n\nThe inventory of visitors, including your humble blogger, has incorporated prime ministers and presidents, royalty and religious leaders, artists and industrialists, school children and journalists, the devout and the merely curious.\n\nIt is impossible to catalogue all the appelations, emotions, inspirations and experiences that this Mandir has evoked.\n\nOn a personal profound level, the Mandir is a pavilion of peace and promise, a dissolver of disquiet, a messenger dispelling misunderstanding, a statement of hope and faith for the future.\n\nI am fascinated by the power of belief and teamwork and the spirit of volunteerism that made the Mandir possible.\n\nIn June 1970, the first BAPS Mandir in Britain opened in a converted disused church in Islington, North London, by Yogji Maharaj.\n\nIn 1982, having outgrown the Islington temple, the congregation moved to a small former warehouse in Neasden.\n\nThe present Mandir was designed by Pramukh Swami, a 92-year-old Indian sadhu (holy man) and is made of 2,828 tonnes of Bulgarian limestone and 2,000 tonnes of Italian marble, which was first shipped to India to be carved by a team of 1,526 sculptors.\n\nAbove: Pramukh Swami (1921 – 2016)\n\nIt was built and funded entirely by the Hindu community.\n\nThe entire project took five years, although the Neasden construction itself was completed in a mere 30 months.\n\nIn November 1992, the temple recorded the largest concrete pour in the United Kingdom, when 4,500 tons were put down in 24 hours to create a foundation mat 1.8 metres / 6 feet thick.\n\nThe first stone was laid in June 1993.\n\nTwo years later, the Mandir was complete.\n\nDesigned according to the Shilpa-Shastras, a Vedic text that develops Hindu architecture to metaphorically represent the different attributes of God, it was constructed almost entirely from Indian marble, Italian marble, Sardinian granite and Bulgarian limestone.\n\nNo iron or steel was used in the construction, a unique feature for a modern building in the UK.\n\nFrom the conceptual design and vision of Pramukh Swami, the architect C. B. Sompura and his team created the Mandir entirely from stone.\n\nIt is a shikharbaddha (or pinnacled) mandir:\n\nSeven-tiered pinnacles topped by golden spires crowd the roofline, complemented by five ribbed domes.\n\nThe temple is noted for its profusely carved cantilevered central dome.\n\nInside, serpentine ribbons of stone link the columns into arches, creating a sense of levitation.\n\nLight cream Vartza limestone from Bulgaria was chosen for the exterior, and for the interior, Italian Carrara marble supplemented by Indian Ambaji marble.\n\nThe Bulgarian and Italian stone were shipped to the port of Kandla in Gujarat, where most of the carving was eventually completed, by over 1,500 craftsmen in a workshop specially set up for the project.\n\nMore than 26,300 individually numbered stones pieces were shipped back to London and the building was assembled like a giant three-dimensional jigsaw.\n\nThe Mandir was inaugurated on 20 August 1995 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the spiritual leader of BAPS – the organisation behind the temple.\n\nThe entire Mandir complex represents an act of faith and collective effort.\n\nInspired by Pramukh Swami Maharaj, more than 1,000 volunteers worked on the building, and many more contributed and solicited donations, or organised sponsored walks and other activities.\n\nChildren raised money by collecting aluminium cans and foil for recycling – the biggest can collection in English history – 7 million cans collected by 1,500 children.\n\nThe Mandir serves as the centre of worship.\n\nDirectly beneath each of the seven pinnacles seen from the outside is a shrine.\n\nEach of these seven shrines houses murtis (sacred images) within altars.\n\nEach murti is revered like God in person and devoutly attended to each day by the sadhus (monks) who live in the temple ashram.\n\nBeneath the Mandir is the permanent exhibition ‘Understanding Hinduism‘.\n\nThrough 3-D dioramas, paintings, tableaux and traditional craftwork, it provides an insight into the wisdom and values of Hinduism.\n\nVisitors can learn about the origin, beliefs and contribution of Hindu seers, and how this ancient religion is being practised today through traditions, such as the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampraday.\n\nThe Mandir is open to people of all faiths and none.\n\nEntrance is free, except to the ‘Understanding Hinduism‘ exhibition where there is a £2 fee, which was covered by the London Pass.\n\n(A note about BAPS….\n\nBochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sanstha (BAPS) (Bocāsanvāsī Akshar Purushottam Sansthā) is a Hindu religious and social organization within the Swaminarayan branch of Hinduism.\n\nBAPS was established on 5 June 1907 by Shastriji Maharaj after leaving the Vadtal Gadi of the Swaminarayan Sampraday.\n\nIt was formed on the founder’s interpretation that Swaminarayan was to remain present on Earth through a lineage of Gunatit Gurus (or Akshar) dating all the way back to Gunatitanand Swami – one of Swaminarayan’s prominent devotees.\n\nGunatitanand Swami was succeeded by Bhagatji Maharaj, Shastriji Maharaj, Yogiji Maharaj, Pramukh Swami Maharaj and Mahant Swami Maharaj.\n\nDue to the organizational emphasis on the Akshar Purushottam doctrine, it essentially forms the organization’s middle name.\n\nThe fundamental beliefs of BAPS include the spiritual guidance through the living Akshar (or Guru) who is believed to have attained oneness with Swaminarayan.\n\nMahant Swami Maharaj is the current Guru and the president of the organization.\n\nAs a global, well-established Hindu organization, BAPS actively engages in a range of endeavors aimed at spirituality, character-building, and human welfare.\n\nThe activities span religious, cultural, social, and humanitarian domains.\n\nThrough these activities, it aims to preserve Indian culture, ideals of Hindu faith, family unity, selfless service, interfaith harmony and peaceful coexistence.\n\n55,000 volunteers and 3,300 temples serve 3,300 communities around the world.\n\nAs of August 2018, BAPS has approximately 1,560 saints (or sadhus), among the most saints in one sanstha in Hinduism.\n\nAs part of its efforts towards community outreach, BAPS also engages in a host of humanitarian and charitable endeavors, by which its volunteers serve neighbors and communities.\n\nWith total assets of 17.5 billion USD, BAPS is able to contribute to a lot of welfare and public service works.\n\nThrough BAPS Charities, a non-profit aid organization, BAPS has spearheaded a number of projects around the world in the arenas of healthcare, education, environmental causes and community-building campaigns.)\n\nFor the Hindu community, the Mandir is a unifying force that installs pride and dignity with a zeal to serve society.\n\nEvery week, hundreds of faithful devotees, young and old alike, gather for prayers and services.\n\nThe annual Diwali and New Year’s festivals are witnessed by thousands of devotees and well-wishers.\n\nDiwali is a spectacular celebration that falls in the month of November, a festival of lights and fireworks that celebrates the triumph of good over evil.\n\nEvery year 35,000 children visit the Mandir.\n\nWhat exactly is a Mandir, you ask?\n\nA Mandir is a Hindu place of worship, literally a place where the mind becomes still and the soul floats freely to seek the source of life, bliss and meaning, a place to pause for a moment to pray, reflect and absorb the peaceful ambiance.\n\nThe problem is that the Mandir is a place that takes religion seriously, and though it is listed as a tourist attraction, the Mandir is anything but one.\n\nHere, there is no pandering to curiosity seekers.\n\nIt is not a place to go rifling through the Hindu faith to light on what has shock value, for the focus on what is bizarre and outside one’s experience is the crudest kind of vulgarization of faith.\n\nBehind the ceremony and ritual, we seek what is of deepest concern to ourselves, that search for the essential similarity in human nature.\n\nHinduism is, like true faith, like other religions, not a dull habit but a raging fever, a pounding pulse that gives its adherants all that is startling about life itself.\n\nThe Mandir in the suburbs of Neasden is as unbelievable to the eyes as a garden in the Sahara.\n\nThis spectacular edifice, this the largest Hindu temple outside India, includes seven spires (shikhars), six domes, 193 pillars and 55 different ceiling designs.\n\nThe Mandir‘s visual splendour and tranquil atmosphere have spontaneously generated poetic expressions and sentiments.\n\nThe media have dubbed the Mandir as “hallucinogenic” and described the profuse carvings as “frothy milk on a cappuccino“.\n\nDeities and motifs representing the Hindu faith spring from the ceilings, walls and windows.\n\nThe impressive monument is supported by a 1,070-foot long pageant of extraordinary stone elephants and a 610-foot long ornately carved outer wall.\n\nThe Narayan Sarovar, a water body that embraces the monument on three sides, gives the Mandir an aura of a traditional place of pilgrimage.\n\nThe Mandir is entered through the richly carved portico of the Grand Haveli (cultural complex), welcoming you into a majestic wooden courtyard with soaring teak columns and oak panels.\n\nElegant peacocks, delicate lotus flowers and royal elephants beckon in greeting, with the carpet designed to compliment the motifs.\n\nWood for the Haveli was sourced from sustainable forests, and for each tree felled, ten saplings were planted.\n\nThe Haveli Prayer Hall is a pillar-less assembly area that measures 2,750 square metres and seats over 2,500 worshippers.\n\nThe Hall incorporates environment-friendly features such as light wells, energy-saving lighting and a heat exchanger which uses thermal energy dissipated by the congregation to heat other parts of the complex.\n\nHere is the venue for weekly assemblies and regular festivals.\n\nThe heart of the Mandir is its murtis (the sacred images of the deities who are revered as living gods), ritually infused with the presence of the divine.\n\nHindus worship murtis to express and enhance their loving relationship with that which is holy.\n\nMurtis are the soul of the Mandir, making it a sacred place of worhsip wherein God resides – the home of God.\n\nThe shrine’s foundations are His feet, the pillars His knees, the inner sanctum His stomach, the throne His heart, the murti His soul, the shikhars His shoulders, the bell His tongue, the lamp His breath, the lion His nose, the windows His ears, the ringed stone on the shikhar His neck, the golden pot His head and the flags His hair.\n\nThe entire Mandir is revered as a divine manifestation.\n\nIn total, there are 11 shrines with 17 murtis, including Ganesh, Hanuman and Swaminarayan – this last to whom the Mandir is dedicated.\n\nThe murtis are ritually served by dedicated sadhus (monks) who live in the Mandir.\n\nBefore sunrise, the murtis are awakened by the sadhus and the shrine doors opened for the first of five daily artis (prayers), the Mangala Arti.\n\nAn arti is a ritual wherein a specific prayer is recited to a poetic format with music while the sadhus wave a lighted lamp in front of the murtis.\n\nThe sadhus recite some shlokas (prayers), serve the murtis, offer them food and bathe them and close the shrine doors.\n\nFeeding and bathing of the murtis continues throughout the day.\n\nThe shrines are opened again for the second aarti, the Shangar Arti, and remain open from 0900 to approximately 1100, when the shrines are closed and offered thal (hymns).\n\nAt 1145, the shrines are opened for the midday arti, the Rajbhog Arti, and the thal is recited before the murtis.\n\nThe shrines are closed after this to allow the murtis to rest during the afternoon.\n\nThe shrines reopen at 1600 until 1830 for darshan.\n\nThe Sandhya Arti (sunset arti) follows at 1900.\n\nThereafter, a selection of prayers are recited by the devotees including dhun (where the names of God are chanted and verses of praise are sung).\n\nThe shrines are closed again for approximately one hour so they can be offered their final meal by the sadhus.\n\nThe murtis are then prepared for the night and adorned in their evening attire by the sadhus.\n\nThe shrines are opened a final time for the Shayan Arti (night-time arti) with the lights dimmed and music lowered.\n\nThe devotees recite a few hymns, gently sending the murtis to sleep, before the shrines are finally closed for the night.\n\nThe elaborately carved pillars, friezes, ornate ceilings and the magnificent dome provide an aesthetic and elevating atmosphere to the sanctum sanctorum of the Mandir.\n\nThe murtis of the Mandir – Bhagwan Swaminarayan, Guru Parampara, the avatars of Sanatan Dharma, Shri Akshar-Purushottam Maharaj, Shri Radha-Krishna, Shri Sita-Ram, Shri Shiv-Parvati, Shri Ganeshji and Shri Hanumanji – exude a heavenly calm and beauty.\n\nDon’t despair if you can’t decipher who is who and what is what, for, to understand all of this, one needs to be steeped in Hindu history and Indian heritage.\n\nHere prayers are whispered, songs of praise are heightened and the soul rejoices beyond the frontiers of mundane existence to experience the divine peace of God.\n\nIt is a nucleus of socio-spiritual activities for the benefit and elevation of individuals, families and society.\n\nIt inspires a society free from violence, crime and addiction.\n\nIt infuses people with a spirit of selfless service, to live in tune with God and in harmony with humanity.\n\nOr at least these are the Mandir’s intentions.\n\nAn hour of lost and bewildered walking finally led me to a procession of French teenagers who were scrutinized carefully by the burly security that met us.\n\nHere at 105 Brentfield Road, as in most places that devote time and attention to unearthly divinity, apparently God has a strict dress code that must be adhered to before you will be allowed to worship Him.\n\nClothing must be respectable, respectful.\n\nShorts and skirts must be below knee-length and footwear removed upon entering the Mandir complex.\n\nNo one smokes on the premises.\n\nVideo and photography are forbidden upon entry.\n\nMobile phones must be turned off and no food or beverages are allowed on the premises.\n\nBy the time I reach the security shed where backpacks are stored upon long shelves and make my way into the Mandir I am immediately summoned by personnel into the Prayer Hall where row upon row of folding chairs support a large collection of English senior citizens let loose here on this most unusual excursion.\n\nThe film is agonizingly long and as I am not officially a part of this senior set, despite the balding pate and silver mane that is mine, I extrude myself as quietly as I can and find myself lining up to enter the Inner Sanctum with the aforementioned French and some Indian devotees.\n\nHindu worship (puja) involves images (murtis), prayers (mantras) and diagrams of the universe (yantras).\n\nThe simplest yantra is a circle within a square within a rectangle, with four gates to represent the four directions of the universe.\n\nHindu temples are based on this design, although still open to endless additions and variations in decoration.\n\nCentral to worship is the icon, or sacred image, which together with the temple, is believed to both house and represent a manifestation of God.\n\nAn icon can be worshipped at home or in a temple.\n\nMost Hindu worship at home more often and the majority of Hindu homes have a shrine, where at certain times different members of the family make offerings and say prayers.\n\nMost Hindus worship individually, not in a communal service.\n\nWorship involves mantras (vibrating sounds that summon the murti) and prasad (the offering of gifts).\n\nWhile many prayers and offerings are made for the fulfillment of wishes, the ultimate objective is the offering of the self to become one with God.\n\nCentral to this worship is darshan (seeing and being in the presence of the central murti).\n\nThe best time to visit the Mandir is just before 1145, when the rajbhog arti ceremony is performed.\n\nLit candles are waved in front of the embodiments of the murtis, accompanied by a musical prayer performed by drums, bells, gongs and a conch shell.\n\nIt is truly a haunting and uplifting experience.\n\nAbhishek is the ancient Hindu practice of pouring water over the sacred image of God to honour Him and to attain His blessings.\n\nIn this Mandir, abhishek of the sacred image of Nilkanth Varni (or Bhagwan Swaminarayan) is performed daily to the chanting of Vedic verses, including the ancient prayer of peace (the Shanti Paath) and the recital of the 108 auspicious and liberating names of Varni (the Janmangal Namavali), in a ceremony that lasts 15 minutes.\n\nThe abhishek is done by devotees on days of special significance to them or to seek blessings for personal reasons.\n\nThe Abhishek Mandap is a marble chamber on the lower floor of the Mandir, housing the sacred image of Shri Nilkanth Varni, the teenage form of Bhagwan Swaminarayan to whom the Mandir is dedicated.\n\nThe chamber is clad in Brazilian and Italian marble and embellished with intricate traditional designs.\n\nAt the chamber’s heart lies the murti of Varni in gilded brass.\n\nHe is depicted in mid-step, emaciated, yet looking calm and resolute.\n\nWith matted hair and a small gutko (handwritten manuscript of excerpts from sacred texts) wrapped in a kerchief around his neck, Varni is wearing nothing but his loincloth tied at the waist by a jute cord.\n\nIn his left hand, Varni carries a dand (a wooden staff) and a kamandalu (a drinking pot made from dry gourd), both common marks of Hindu ascetism.\n\nWho was Varni?\n\nAfter renouncing his home at the tender age of 11, Bhagwan Swaminarayan embarked upon an epic journey of spiritual awakening that took him around India, into Nepal and Tibet, and through Myanmar and Bangladesh.\n\nDuring this time, he became to be known as Nilkanth Varni.\n\nBarefoot and alone, Nilkanth walked almost 8,000 miles over seven years, blessing the land and liberating numerous spiritual aspirants along the way.\n\nCarrying no maps, no food and no money, Varni crossed raging rivers, faced ferocious animals and survived the freezing heights of the Himalayas.\n\nHis solitary journey is a story of courage, kindness and enlightenment, and the inspiration for the naming of the Mandir.\n\nBut can the non-believer understand Hinduism?\n\nI have tried and what I have concluded is the following….\n\nHinduism is the world’s oldest ongoing living religion, practised as early as 6500 BC.\n\nIt has, unlike Christianity or Islam, no one single founder, but is rather a collective of experiences of ancient seers over the centuries.\n\nAccording to Hinduism’s adherents, Hinduism teaches one to see the presence of God in everything and thus honour the whole of creation.\n\nYou can find God in the world of everyday affairs as readily as anywhere else.\n\nWith this perspective, there are no heathens nor enemies.\n\nMany Hindus acknowledge Christ as a divine man, while believing that there have been many as such, including Rama, Krishna and the Buddha.\n\nEveryone, even Canada Slim your humble blogger, has the right to evolve spiritually and will, at some time, realise the truth.\n\nHindus believe that souls are not limited to one life – many lives offer many chances for spiritual elevation.\n\nLike many religions, this faith has rigorous rules.\n\nPeople are responsible for every action they perform, through the Law of Karma.\n\nHindus believe in one supreme, all-powerful God, the Creator, who has a divine form, is immanent (eternal), transcedent and the grantor of spiritual liberation (moksha).\n\nJews, Christians and Muslims view the worship of God in the form of one chosen ideal.\n\nHindus view and represent God in innumerable forms.\n\nEach form (avatar) is but a symbol that points to something beyond.\n\nNo one form can truly encapsulate God’s actual nature, so an entire array is needed to complete the picture of God’s aspects and manifestations.\n\nEach representation’s vocation is to introduce the human heart to what it represents but what it itself is not.\n\nThough each representation points equally to God, the Hindu devotee tends to form a lifetime attachment to one, the ishta, the form of the divine the devotee wishes to adopt.\n\nThis worship of sacred images of God is called murti puja.\n\nAfter all, love assumes different nuances according to the relationship involved.\n\nHindus believe in Karma that the soul reaps fruit – good or bad – which is experienced either in this life or in future lives.\n\nThey believe in reincarnation (punar-janma), that the soul is immortal, repeatedly born and reborn in one of millions of lifeforms until it attains spiritual liberation (moksha).\n\nMoksha is the release of the soul from this perpetual cycle of births and deaths, remaining eternally in the blissful presence of God.\n\nDharma is how we choose to live our lives according to divine law, which values service, sacrifice, humility, duty, devotion, purpose, fidelity, respect and integrity among other positive practices and virtues.\n\nThis divine law is believed to be revealed by the authority of the Vedic scriptures, the four Vedas – the Samhita, the Brahmana, the Aranyaka and the Upanishad.\n\nAnd in a model of efficiency these are encapsulated in the Shikshapatri, a book of moral conduct in 212 succinct Sanskrit verses.\n\nIn a nutshell of simplicity:\n\nDo not steal.\n\nDo not eat meat.\n\nDo not consume alcohol or other intoxicants.\n\nDo not commit adultery.\n\nMaintain purity of conduct.\n\nHindus claim a proud heritage:\n\nthe world’s first university (700 BC), Takshashila, India\n\nthe invention of the Zero, which makes the binary system and computers possible\n\nthe invention of the decimal system\n\nthe invention of geometry and trigonometry\n\nthe value of pi – the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle\n\nthe prior formulation of the Pythagorean Theorem (which says that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle equals the sum of the square of the two sides) (For me, mathematics is as arcane and mysterious as faith.)\n\na theory of the revolution of the Earth 1,000 years before Copernicus\n\na formulation of the law of gravity 1,200 years before Newton\n\nan idea of the smallest and largest measures of time from a kratl (34,000th of a second) to a kalpa (4.32 billion years)\n\nthe practice of surgery 2,600 years ago with 125 types of surgical instruments for 300 different operations\n\nI did not leave the Mandir of London as a convert to Hinduism, but what my visit showed me was worth the effort.\n\nLife holds more than what one is experiencing now.\n\nPeople need to live for something which makes life worthwhile, a quest for meaning and value beyond oneself.\n\nLife holds other possibilities beyond our own experience.\n\nHinduism holds that underlying the human self and animating it is a reservoir of being that never dies, is never exhausted and is unrestricted in consciousness and bliss.\n\nHinduism sees the mind’s hidden continents as stretching to infinity, infinite in being, infinite in awareness, infinite in joy.\n\nHindus believe that there are multiple paths to God, each calling for a distinctive mode of travel, each starting from the kind of person one is.\n\nWe all play the roles our personalities dictate, cast in this moment in the greatest of all tragi-comedies, the drama of life itself in which we are all simultaneously co-authors and actors, powered less by reason than by emotion.\n\nTo find meaning in this drama, in the mystery of existence, is life’s final and fascinating challenge.\n\nLife is a training ground for the human spirit.\n\nThe world is the soul’s gymnasium, both a school and a training field.\n\nHindus believe that the world is lila, God’s plan, that the goal of life is life itself.\n\nThe various major religions are alternate paths to the same goal to find meaning to our lives beyond ourselves.\n\nThe various religions are but different languages through which God, should God exist, speaks to the human heart.\n\n“Truth is one.\n\nSages call truth by different names.”\n\nDifferences in culture, history, geography and temperament all make for diverse starting points.\n\nIs life not more interesting as a result of its infinite variety in endless combinations?\n\nI may not always understand that which is out of my experience, but the benefits of trying to go beyond my experience are boundless.\n\nSources: Wikipedia / Google / Understanding Hinduism Exhibition Guidebook, BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir / John

mesmerized by museums and attracted to artefacts of days gone by.\n\nOr perhaps you long for a lengthy siesta where your hardest decision is how much sunscreen to wear today.\n\nThe Canary Islands have what you want, however you want it, but being all things to all people means this is a place of contradictions.\n\nThe Islands lie off the coast of Africa yet they are European.\n\nThe Canary Islands form a Spanish archipelago and the southernmost autonomous community of Spain located in the Atlantic Ocean, 100 kilometres (62 miles) west of Morocco at the closest point.\n\nThe Canary Islands, which are also known informally as the Canaries, are among the outermost regions (OMR) of the European Union proper.\n\nIt is also one of the eight regions with special consideration of historical nationality recognized as such by the Spanish Government.\n\nThe Canary Islands belong to the African Plate, like the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla on the African mainland.\n\nThe seven main islands are (from largest to smallest in area) Tenerife, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro.\n\nThe archipelago includes much smaller islands and islets: La Graciosa, Alegranza, Isla de Lobos, Montaña Clara, Roque del Oeste and Roque del Este.\n\nIt also includes a series of adjacent roques (those of Salmor, Fasnia, Bonanza, Garachico and Anaga).\n\nIn ancient times, the island chain was often referred to as “the Fortunate Isles“.\n\nBut delving into Canarian history the casual observer has to ponder the question:\n\nFortunate for whom?\n\nHistorically, the Canary Islands have been considered a bridge between four continents: Africa, North America, South America and Europe.\n\nAnd it has been their strategic location that has been both a blessing and a curse to those who have chosen to make the Islands their home.\n\nAbove: Flag of the Canary Islands\n\nThe archipelago’s beaches, climate and important natural attractions, especially Maspalomas in Gran Canaria and Teide National Park and Mount Teide (a World Heritage Site) in Tenerife (the third tallest volcano in the world measured from its base on the ocean floor), make it a major tourist destination with over 12 million visitors per year, especially Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.\n\nImagine living on an island where more people around you are tourists than residents.\n\nTourists are, by their very nature, selfish in that the pleasure principle dominates their every thought.\n\nMost care nothing about those who reside there except in how the locals cater to their needs.\n\nThere is nothing new under the sun.\n\nThe islands have a subtropical climate, with long hot summers and moderately warm winters.\n\nThe precipitation levels and the level of maritime moderation vary depending on location and elevation.\n\nGreen areas as well as desert exist on the archipelago.\n\nRain seems rare and snow something never seen.\n\nDue to their location above the temperature inversion layer, the high mountains of these islands are ideal for astronomical observation.\n\nFor this reason, two professional observatories, Teide Observatory on the island of Tenerife and Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, have been built on the islands.\n\nThe day sky is cloudless.\n\nThe night sky stretches to infinity and beyond.\n\nThe horizon beckons with promise.\n\nSo it may be reasonable to assume that piracy has existed for as long as the oceans were plied for commerce.\n\nPiracy is an act of robbery or criminal violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties.\n\nThose who engage in acts of piracy are called pirates.\n\nPrivateering uses similar methods to piracy, but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation, making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors.\n\nDue to the strategic situation of this Spanish archipelago as a crossroads of maritime routes and commercial bridge between Europe, Africa and America, this was one of the places on the planet with the greatest pirate presence.\n\nIn the Canary Islands, the following stand out:\n\nThe attacks and continuous looting of Berber, English, French and Dutch corsairs\n\nThe presence of pirates from this archipelago who made their incursions into the Caribbean.\n\nPirates and corsairs, such as François Le Clerc, Jacques de Sores, Francis Drake, Pieter van der Does, Murat Reis and Horacio Nelson, attacked the islands.\n\nAmong those born in the archipelago who stands out above all is Amaro Pargo, whom the monarch Felipe V of Spain frequently benefited from his commercial incursions.\n\nDuring the time of the Spanish Empire, the Canaries were the main stopover for Spanish galleons – galleons seeking to be laiden with treasure – on their way to the Americas, which came south to catch the prevailing northeasterly trade winds.\n\nSailing off the coast of Africa the closest of the Canaries to be reached is the Island of Lanzerote and thus it became the first Canary Island to be settled.\n\nLanzerote is the northernmost and easternmost of the autonomous Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIt is located approximately only 125 kilometres (78 miles) off the north coast of Africa and 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) from the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nCovering 845.94 square kilometres (326.62 square miles), Lanzarote is the fourth largest of the islands in the archipelago.\n\nWith 149,183 inhabitants, it is the third most populous Canary Island, after Tenerife and Gran Canaria.\n\nLocated in the centre-west of the island is Timanfaya National Park, one of its main attractions.\n\nThe island was declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in 1993.\n\nThe island’s capital is Arrecife.\n\nThe Phoenicians may have visited or settled there, though no material evidence survives.\n\nThe first known record came from Roman author Pliny the Elder in the encyclopaedia Naturalis Historia on an expedition to the Canary Islands.\n\nThe names of the islands (then called Insulae Fortunatae or the “Fortunate Isles“) were recorded as Junonia (Fuerteventura), Canaria (Gran Canaria), Ninguaria (Tenerife), Junonia Major (La Palma), Pluvialia (El Hierro), and Capraria (La Gomera).\n\nLanzarote and Fuerteventura, the two easternmost Canary Islands, were only mentioned as the archipelago of the “purple islands“.\n\nThe Roman poet Lucan and the Greek astronomer and geographer Ptolemy gave their precise locations.\n\nSeveral archaeological expeditions have uncovered the prehistoric settlement at the archaeologic site of El Bebedero in the village of Teguise.\n\nIn one of those expeditions, by a team from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and a team from the University of Zaragoza, yielded about 100 Roman potsherds, nine pieces of metal, and one piece of glass.\n\nThe artefacts were found in strata dated between the 1st and 4th centuries.\n\nThey show that Romans did trade with the Canarians, though there is no evidence of settlements.\n\nLanzarote was previously settled by the Majos tribe of the Guanches, though the Romans did not mention them.\n\nGuanches were the aboriginal inhabitants of the Canary Islands.\n\nIn 2017, the first genome-wide data from the Guanches confirmed a North African origin and that they were genetically most similar to modern North African Berber peoples of the nearby North African mainland.\n\nIt is believed that they migrated to the archipelago around 1000 BC or perhaps earlier.\n\nThe Guanches were the only native people known to have lived in the region before the arrival of Europeans, as there is no evidence that the other archipelagos (Azores, Cape Verde, Madeira) were inhabited before Europeans arrived.\n\nAfter the Spanish conquest of the Canaries they were ethnically and culturally absorbed by Spanish settlers, although elements of their culture survive to this day, intermixed within Canarian customs and traditions such as Silbo (the whistled language of La Gomera Island).\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Canary Islands were ignored until 999, when the Arabs arrived at the island which they dubbed al-Djezir al-Khalida (among other names).\n\nAn account of the Guanche population may have been made around AD 1150 by the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi in the Nuzhatul Mushtaq, a book he wrote for King Roger II of Sicily, in which al-Idrisi reports a journey in the Atlantic Ocean made by the Mugharrarin (“the adventurers“), a family of Andalusian seafarers from Lisbon.\n\nThe only surviving version of this book, kept at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, and first translated by Pierre Amédée Jaubert, reports that, after having reached an area of “sticky and stinking waters“, the Mugharrarin moved back and first reached an uninhabited island (Madeira or Hierro), where they found “a huge quantity of sheep, which its meat was bitter and inedible” and, then, “continued southward” and reached another island where they were soon surrounded by barks and brought to “a village whose inhabitants were often fair haired with long and flaxen hair and the women of a rare beauty“.\n\nAmong the villagers, one did speak Arabic and asked them where they came from.\n\nThen the king of the village ordered them to bring them back to the continent where they were surprised to be welcomed by Berbers.\n\nApart from the marvelous and fanciful content of this history, this account would suggest that Guanches had sporadic contacts with populations from the mainland.\n\nAl-Idrisi also described the Guanche men as tall and of a reddish-brown complexion.\n\nDuring the 14th century, the Guanches are presumed to have had other contacts with Balearic seafarers from Spain, suggested by the presence of Balearic artifacts found on several of the Canary Islands.\n\nAbove: (in red) The Balearic Islands\n\nIn 1336, a ship arrived from Lisbon under the guidance of Genoese navigator Lancelotto Malocello, who used the alias “Lanzarote da Framqua“.\n\nA fort was later built in the area of Montaña de Guanapay near today’s Teguise.\n\nCastilian slaving expeditions in 1385 and 1393 seized hundreds of Guanches and sold them in Spain, initiating the slave trade in the islands.\n\nWhere there is profit to be found on the open seas there will be those who will seek to claim it.\n\nSlavery and piracy differ only in that the plunder of the former is the lives of human beings.\n\nThe violence used by both is indistinguishable from the other.\n\nFrench explorer Jean de Béthencourt arrived in 1402, heading a private expedition under Castilian auspices.\n\nBethencourt first visited the south of Lanzarote at Playa de Papagayo, and the French overran the island within a matter of months.\n\nAbove: Jean de Béthencourt (1362 – 1425)\n\nThe island lacked mountains and gorges to serve as hideouts for the remaining Guanche population and so many Guanches were taken away as slaves.\n\nOnly 300 Guanche men were said to have remained.\n\nThe Castilian conquest of the Canary Islands began in 1402, with the expedition of Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle (1340 – 1415) to the island of Lanzarote.\n\nGadifer would invade Lanzarote and Fuerteventura with ease since many of the aboriginals, faced with issues of starvation and poor agriculture, would surrender to Spanish rule.\n\nAt the southern end of the Yaiza municipality, the first European settlement in the Canary Islands appeared in 1402 in the area known as El Rubicón, where the conquest of the Archipelago began.\n\nIn this place, the Cathedral of Saint Martial of Limoges was built.\n\nThe cathedral was destroyed by English pirates in the 16th century.\n\nThe diocese was moved in 1483 to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias).\n\nIn 1404, the Castilians (with the support of the King of Castile) came and fought the local Guanches who were further decimated.\n\nThe islands of Fuerteventura and El Hierro were later similarly conquered.\n\nIn 1477, a decision by the royal council of Castile confirmed a grant of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, with the smaller islands of Ferro and Gomera to the Castilian nobles Herrera, who held their fief until the end of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1585, the Ottoman admiral Murat Reis temporarily seized Lanzarote.\n\nIn the 17th century, pirates raided the island and took 1,000 inhabitants into slavery in Cueva de los Verdes.\n\nFrom 1730 to 1736, the island was hit by a series of volcanic eruptions, producing 32 new volcanoes in a stretch of 18 kilometres (11 miles).\n\nThe priest of Yaiza, Don Andrés Lorenzo Curbelo, documented the eruption in detail until 1731.\n\nLava covered a quarter of the island’s surface, including the most fertile soil and 11 villages.\n\n100 smaller volcanoes were located in the area called Montañas del Fuego, the “Mountains of Fire“.\n\nIn 1768, drought affected the deforested island and winter rains did not fall.\n\nMuch of the population was forced to emigrate to Cuba and the Americas, including a group which formed a significant addition to the Spanish settlers in Texas at San Antonio de Bexar in 1731.\n\nAnother volcanic eruption occurred within the range of Tiagua in 1824, which was less violent than the major eruption between 1730 and 1736.\n\nThus the island has become a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve protected site.\n\nAccording to a report in the Financial Times, this status was endangered by a local corruption scandal.\n\nSince May 2009, police have arrested the former president of Lanzarote, the former mayor of Arrecife and more than 20 politicians and businessmen in connection with illegal building permits along Lanzarote’s coastline.\n\nUNESCO has threatened to revoke Lanzarote’s Biosphere Reserve status, “if the developments are not respecting local needs and are impacting on the environment“.\n\nThe President of the Cabildo of Lanzarote denied “any threat to Lanzarote’s UNESCO status“.\n\nPiracy upon the open sea beside the shores of Lanzarote may be a thing of the past but greed remains eternal.\n\nTeguise, Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Sunday 2 December 2018\n\nAs described in a previous post of this blog, my wife and I arrived on the island and drove from the airport near the island capital of Arrecife to the resort town of Costa Teguise where we overnighted for the entirety of our stay on Lanzarote.\n\n(Please see Canada Slim and the Royal Retreat of this blog.)\n\nAbove: Lanzarote Airport\n\nOur previous research gleaned that Sunday was m"
