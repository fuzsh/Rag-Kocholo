The girl died of spring fever, but he locates the boy, Michael (who is called Henry Johnson whilst living at a foster family).\n\nTommy visits Michael's home and gives him a card with their information on it, despite the protests of his adoptive mother, Mrs. Johnson.\n\nAn increasingly unhinged Arthur continues to struggle with war trauma, when he inadvertently beats an opponent to death in the boxing.\n\nTommy questions Finn and his friend, Isaiah, about what happened, and he tells them to get their stories straight because they just told two different ones.\n\nTommy tells Arthur that they'll look after the boy's mother and it'll be fine. Tommy is unsympathetic to Arthur, who tries to open up about his PTSD, and tells him to \"shut the door on it\" like he did, because the war is over and its been over for a long time. Arthur is pissed and slams him into the mantel, telling him that he isn't Tommy and everyone fucking knows it. Tommy forces Arthur to look at his reflection before discarding him on a chair. Tommy leaves before coming back inside and removing the bullets from Arthur's gun and chucking a bottle of alcohol into the fire.\n\nCampbell speaks to Moss, who has been working for the Peaky Blinders, and tells him that as of that moment, he is now back on the side of the \"angels\", and he is going to be working as a double agent.\n\nWhen Tommy tells Polly that son must choose to contact her if he wants, she fires her gun at the ceiling in impotent rage before heading out on an emotional bender at the newly re-opened Garrison Pub, culminating in a druken one night stand.\n\nFinn goes to speak to Arthur, who isn't planning on going to the re-opening of the Garrison. Finn introduces him to a drug he calls \"Tokyo\", and Arthur goes to the pub very high and full of energy. Tommy pulls him aside and tells him that he should only take Tokyo on race days and for grand openings, because they've both seen a horse after they've been doped and its no good.\n\nTommy asks Ada to speak to Polly for him, because no one can get through to her. Polly says that she doesn't want a conversation, she wants an address.\n\nNovember 13\n\nAfter going home the next morning, Polly meets her son, Michael Gray, who has come to Birmingham to see her.\n\nThe Irish factions continue to fight amongst each other in Birmingham. Campbell insists to Moss that he doesn't regret what happened with Grace and that he doesn't have any bad memories. Moss mumbles to himself that Campbell has lost his bloody mind.\n\nTommy, Arthur and John are interviewing men. One man, Digbeth Kid, comes in and they make fun of him for naming himself after Billy the Kid and watching too many pictures. Digbeth has a wooden gun and a gun belt that his sister made for him out of an old blacksmith's apron.\n\nThey decide that since he's the first man without a record that they've interviewed all days, they'll be hiring him on. He says that he can't write and they say that its okay because Finn can't read.\n\nPolly and her estranged son, Michael, catch up after about twelve years apart. Always the maternal figure, Polly finally has her biological son in her life.\n\nArthur and John burst in Polly's door playing at cowboys, still making fun of Digbeth Kid. Tommy introduces the boys to their cousin, Michael. Tommy welcomes him to the Shelby family.\n\nNovember 20\n\nTommy and John meet with Corporal Billy Kitchen, who says that he's ready for active service. He's just come out of the hospital for a bullet wound. Tommy wants Billy to be the head of a brigade, and he'll have a hundred men under his command.\n\nLater, Michael is heading over to the Garrison to call his adoptive mother to let her know where he is, when Tommy intervenes and urges him to tell her he's coming home. Michael wants to stay in Birmingham, and get to know Polly and his Blinder cousins better. Despite Polly's dreams of respectability, Michael dreams of being a bad boy. Tommy replies, \"Yup, you're Polly's son all right\".\n\nTommy and his new recruits head to Camden Town to get to work with Alfie Solomons and his new army of bootleg distillers posing as bakers. Orientation doesn't go so well though for one guy who ends up getting his teeth knocked out, so that Alfie can make it clear that he is the boss.\n\nAda pulls a gun when she hears the door opening, but its just Tommy, who has kept a key to her house. She demands that she hand it over. Tommy wants Ada to find rooms for his men, but she knows the kind of conditions he will keep them in and doesn't want to. Tommy stands to leave and Ada tells him that there have been coppers and gangsters outside watching her house. He says that if he didn't have people watching the house, he couldn't sleep.\n\nPolly takes Michael to see the house that Tommy gave her. She tells him that she has taken on a maid and she has made up a room for him; she wants to spend the week there together, getting to know each other.\n\nArthur is confronted by Mrs. Ross, the mother of the boy he killed in a boxing match. She pulls a gun on him but it misfires and shoots the mirror behind the bar.\n\nArthur lunges toward her, but then empties the gun of bullets, and tells her that she'll be compensated financially. Broken and furious, she flips over the table and screams, \"Somebody has got to stop you people!\"\n\nTommy meets up with Major Campbell, pointing out that the Birmingham police have amusingly put him up in a hostel run by a semi-retired prostitute and brothel owner, indicating that they know of Campbell's secret activities.\n\nCampbell returns to his rooms and insists that his landlady take off her clothes. When she is stripped to her shift, he tells her to stop, and he only wanted to know if it was true. He tells her to tell the policemen that he knows, and when his judgement comes, he will be the one who is laughing.\n\nNovember 22\n\nSabini decides to send a message to Tommy, and has his men kill one of the Shelby gang currently in jail for illegal bookmaking, the Digbeth Kid - in reality the chap is just a naïve had obsessed with Billy the Kid who dreams of being a gangster, and it was his first time being arrested.\n\nNovember 23\n\nTommy calls a family meeting and swears revenge for the death of Digbeth Kid. He also announces that they plan to buy a race horse, thus giving them a credible reason to infiltrate the race courses dominated by Sabini's men.\n\nPolly's son Michael comes with them to the auction, despite Polly's protests. At the auction they meet May Carleton, an attractive well-to-do horse trainer, who enjoys the company of bad boys. Needless to say, Tommy's interest is piqued.\n\nAs they are about to leave the auctions, Tommy and his gang are ambushed but they kill the assailants. In another episode of blind rage, Arthur beats the man practically to death.\n\nMichael, who has watched it all calmly, makes it clear that he wants to stay with his new family.\n\nNovember 30\n\nTommy attends the funeral of the Digbeth Kid, whose real name was Harold Hancox, only to get a slap in the face from a mourner, before paying off the family for their trouble.\n\nDecember[]\n\nDecember 6\n\nTommy makes his way to meet Inspector Campbell, who needs him to carry out another assassination, this time of Field Marshal Henry Russell.\n\nUpon arrival, Tommy realizes Campbell and the pro-Treaty Irish Republicans have been working together all along. Tommy informs Campbell that Donal Henry is a spy and that the only way he'll carry out the assassination is if Henry is killed.\n\nHenry's body is soon found in a pile of coal, and Tommy starts planning the assassination.\n\nIn London, Arthur, whose cocaine habit is scaring his younger brother, leads the Blinders in tearing up the Eden Club belonging to Italian gang lord Darby Sabini. Arthur ruins Mario's face with glass and announces that the club is under new management, by order of the Peaky Blinders.\n\nTommy is looking at Henry Russell's record when his fingers touch his temple and find blood. He puts the folder away and pours himself a drink. Lizzie tells him that someone's here for the accountant job. Polly's son, Michael, wants the job. He says that he wants to help Tommy make the business mostly legal and he wants to be proud of the family. Tommy tells him to call his mother and wishes him luck.\n\nDecember 7\n\nThe Corleone children; Angelo, Sonny, Connie, Tom, Fredo, and family friends; Salvatore, Peter, and Carlo gather in their dining room to surprise Vito Corleone on his 54th birthday, and Sonny introduces Carlo to Connie for the first time.\n\nAngelo announces that he has left college and decided to help Sammy Rabuto run the Corleone operation in New Bordeaux and he leaves in fourteen months on February 6th, 1923, leaving Sonny extremely furious, Tom incredulous, and Fredo the only supportive brother.\n\nWhen Vito is heard at the door, all but Angelo leave the room to greet him and sing.\n\nDecember 8\n\nTommy invites May Carleton to the house to see a \"real gambling den\", because she's interested in seeing one. Tommy has hired May to train his new horse, whose name is Grace's Secret.\n\nHer box truck isn't coming until midday, so Tommy takes May to the Garrison.\n\nIn the Garrison, Tommy pours May a glass of gin. She is surprised that he doesn't water it down with anything and he offers her cordial. Tommy asks May if she wants to have sex with him. May says that she is purely there for the horse. May did her research on him and while he doesn't exist on a register, he did register for the war. Finn tells them that her box truck has arrived.\n\nTommy and Polly initially clash over whether or not Michael should be given the job, but eventually they come to an agreement. Tommy will pay Michael a higher wage than he advertised and keep him away from the old business, putting him in charge of the new one. Polly and Tommy spit into their palms and shake on it.\n\nDecember 9\n\nThe following morning, its Friday, Michael's birthday. Arthur comments that they need to find him a lady of the night and Polly is offended. Tommy gifts him a gold pocket watch so that he'll never be late for work. The brothers welcome him to the business and toast to him.\n\nDecember 12\n\nTommy's distillery in Camden Town prepares to send five hundred bottles of Scotch whiskey to Prohibition-hit America, thanks to the deal with Churchill for an export license.\n\nDecember 15\n\nTara Marston is born to Jack and Michelle Marston.\n\n1922[]\n\nJanuary[]\n\nJanuary 9\n\nTommy is looking over the books when he notes that they've made 600 pounds on olives. Arthur tries to cover and say that that's for olives and onions for the drinks, but Tommy knows better. He reminds Arthur that they're only supposed to take a cut of the cocaine that the dealers sell, but they don't sell directly; the Home Secretary is cracking down and he doesn't want this to ruin everything else. Tommy asks him how much of that 600 was paid for by him, and Arthur pours himself another drink, saying that its under control. Tommy tells him that he put Arthur down there because people are afraid of him, but if he doesn't straighten up. he'll give the position to John.\n\nTommy looks over a file in his parked car. A policeman approaches him and tells him that he can't park there and needs to move on. Tommy tells him that he's just lost, and turns the car back on. Taking out his pocket watch, he notes that it only took 23 seconds for him to be noticed by the policeman.\n\nTommy visits Ada's home in London, and is met by James. Tommy is initially rude to James, thinking him a new boyfriend of Ada's,but Ada tells him that he is gay writer and he is not interested in her.\n\nAfter learning that James isn't after his sister, Tommy is a lot nicer and even shakes his hand. Ada tells Tommy that James doesn't know that she's a Shelby. Tommy tells her that he doesn't have any kids, so he has set up a trust fund, and the beneficiaries will be John's kids and Karl, but he needs her signature in order for Karl to benefit. Ada takes the paper and asks him if he is sick; he tells her that he is just putting his affairs in order like any other man would.\n\nJanuary 13\n\nOver in Camden Town, Alfie Solomons sits down with Darby Sabini to talk business, but first, flags are waved and bread is served.\n\nThey agree to a truce, and war against the Peaky Blinders.\n\nTommy invites himself over to May Carleton's mansion to see just how the other half live and get a progress report on his horse. She reveals that she has lived alone since her husband's death, and allows herself to be seduced by Tommy.\n\nMichael and Jeremiah Jesus' son, Isaiah, go to grab a drink after work at the Marquis of Lorne.\n\nIsaiah and Michael get into a fight with a man named Paddy, who refuses to drink in the same pub as a black man. The fight quickly stops when Lucifer, using the name Angelo Corleone, steps in breaks up the fight without a whiff of breaking a sweat, and tells Paddy that Michael is Polly Shelby's son.\n\nMichael discovers his family's terrifying power and their allies even worsen terrifying power, when Arthur and John, with the help of Angelo, hears about his scuffle.\n\nLucifer and the two then burn the pub to the ground along with the man who instigated the fight.\n\nJanuary 14\n\nOn Tommy's return to Birmingham, he gets the details of his assignment from Campbell. Tommy assures Campbell that if he is killed, he'll have Campbell killed.\n\nIn Tommy's office, he pulls out a letter, dials a number, asks to be connected to the Ritz Hotel in London, and waits. On the other end, a man with a New York accent (who is Grace's husband, Clive Macmillian) picks up. Tommy doesn't say anything, and disconnects from the line. Grace asks him who it was, and he says that the line disconnected, with Grace suspecting it was Tommy.\n\nJanuary 21\n\nAlfie Solomons invites Arthur and Billy Kitchen over for Passover at the distillery. Things escalate rather quickly after Alfie sacrifices the goeat named after Tommy Shelby, and shoots Billy Kitchen in the head. He has his men tie up Arthur Shelby, and wait for the police to haul him off to jail for the murder of Billy Kitchen.\n\nAt the same time, Polly's son Michael is thrown behind bars by Major Campbell for the burning down the Marquis of Lorne pub.\n\nJanuary 22\n\nTommy goes to see May Carleton and check on his filly. May introduces him to Mick, whom she calls the best horseman in England. Mick says he has heard about Tommy, to which Tommy replies that based on reports he has been given, that he likes to waste money. Tommy says he's spending 2 pounds a month on worming powder for the horses. Mick asks if he wants a horse with worms. Tommy tells him the horses get the worms from their water troughs, and all can be resolved by adding goldfish to the water trough, because they will eat the worm eggs.\n\nMicky scoffs at the idea, saying it must be a gypsy thing. Tommy tells him no, its an accounting things; goldfish only cost a penny each. Mick storms away, telling them he can dispense of the Veterinarian altogether.\n\nWalking back to the estate, May tells Tommy she told the maids only one fire would be needed for the night, insinuating Tommy will not stay in the quest quarters, he will spend the night in her room.\n\nAt estate, a maid tells May there is a telephone call, but it isn't for her, it is for Tommy.\n\nAn infuriated Tommy meets with Campbell at a church. He simply informs Tommy that his reason for throwing Arthur and Michael in jail was to motivate Tommy to properly carry out his task, since he now believes Tommy is not afraid to die having wrapped up his affairs for that very event. Threatening Tommy's life is not enough to make it certain he will obey him. He needed the threat of life and death over Tommy's family as well. He also threatens Ada, because he knows her address in London. Campbell leaves Tommy with a quote his father used, \"to make sure your dog obeys you, you have to show 'em the stick once in a while.\"\n\nTommy receives a phone call from Grace. They agree to meet sometime soon.\n\nTommy has a family meeting where he is informed of the gang's business losses due to the coppers. John informs Tommy that the Eden Club (as well as their other pubs) has been raided by the coppers and returned to the ownership of Darby Sabini and Alfie Solomons. Esme has news for Tommy. Polly says she shouldn't be allowed to speak, because the meeting is for family only, and Esme is not family by blood. Tommy hears her out, and she says she spoke to Johnny Dogs; the Lees are kin, and the Lee family can give them men for a few nights.\n\nPolly says it is men that have done the damage and put them in this position in the first place. Tommy disregards Polly and tells Esme they need men and will take up the Lee family's offer. Polly tells Tommy that she will be taking Michael away from the Shelby family when he gets out of prison and that \"this life is bad, this life is all bad.\"\n\nAs John is bringing the car around, Esme tells Tommy his gypsy half is the strongest, and if he wants to ride away and live life, she hears that \"France is the new place to go, they still let you get lost there.\" Tommy tells her that he and John have already been to France. He grabs Esme by the face and tells her if she ever talks about getting lost again, he will cut her frrom this family. Esme's response is \"what family?\"\n\nJanuary 24\n\nRealizing that Tommy won't get Michael out of prison soon enough, Polly takes the matter into her own hands. Campbell offers to release Michael the next morning but only in return for a sexual favor. Polly agrees to this deal.\n\nJanuary 25\n\nThe next day, Michael tells her they told him what she did to get him out of jail. He fails to understand the generosity of her sacrifice, and is instead embarrassed and disgusted by what his mother has done.\n\nGrace lies to her husband, Clive Macmillian, and runs out to see Tommy, where after some abruptly harsh conversation, Tommy informs her that he simply wanted to skip the past, so Tommy takes her to see Charlie Chaplin in person.\n\nTommy takes a highly satisfying moment to telephone Campbell and inform him that he is about to sleep with Grace.\n\nAfter they button up, Tommy asks to see Grace again and she informs him that she and her husband have been trying to have a baby, and that she may be the cause of her infertility.\n\nTommy urges her to tell her husband the truth.\n\nJanuary 26\n\nJohn visits Arthur, who regrets not doing more with his life, at the prison. He tells Arthur that he already knows what he's got to do and he's not going to hang.\n\nFebruary[]\n\nFebruary 4\n\nJohn blows up the residence of Field Marshal Henry Russell in order to relocate the assassination that Tommy must carry out.\n\nTommy visits May Carleton to confesses that he still loves Grace and that they should break up, but May is unable to let him go. May says that while his horse may only come in 5th, or 6th, May has resolved to win Tommy over.\n\nArthur gets released from jail thanks to John's efforts.\n\nFebruary 6\n\nTommy reveals to Inspector Campbell that his new location of Henry Russell's assassination will take place at the Epsom racetrack on Derby day.\n\nFebruary 21\n\nThe first Galactic War begins throughout the neighboring galaxy to the Milky-Way Galaxy, the Andromeda galaxy.\n\nAngelo Corleone discovers that beings from the Andromeda galaxy, takes their fight to the galaxy of the Milky-Way.\n\nUpon discovering that the Galactic war is about to reach Earth, Lucifer decide to shield the planet.\n\nLucifer then creates powerful invisible shield out of nothing and then he places it in Earth's atmosphere, to protect the planet from any outside spaceships and landing pots from a different galaxy; effectively destroying any spaceship or landing pot from a different galaxy.\n\nApril[]\n\nApril 1\n\nKarl I dies.\n\nApril 6\n\nDowntown Cab Company is founded in East Vinewood, Los Santos.\n\nApril 28\n\nAmara Canepa is born.\n\nMay[]\n\nMay 17\n\nEnema is founded.\n\nMay 23\n\nColleen O'Brien is born in New Rochelle, New York.\n\nMay 25\n\nAndrew Hagen is born to Thomas Hagen and Teresa Camastra in New York City, New York, United States.\n\nMay 27\n\nChristopher Lee is born.\n\nMay 31\n\nTommy writes a letter to the editor of the New York Times, explaining the situation with the British Intelligence Service and Winston Churchill, who is having him perform a high-profile assassination on behalf of the crown.\n\nTommy names Chester Campbell and gives the sealed envelope to Ada, who is ordered to mail it if Tommy fails to return from Epsom, where the Derby is being held.\n\nAda's new housemate, James, accompanies Tommy to Camden Town where he has a sit-down with Alfie Solomons.\n\nTommy tells James to stand outside, before he goes into the distillery to see Alfie, who has plans of his own. He wants to get Tommy to sign over 100% of his business before he shoots him dead. Tommy responds by revealing that he and James have a grenade trip-wired to a barrel of rum and if anyone other than Tommy walks outside the door, James is to blow up the joint.\n\nAlfie can't tell if he is bluffing, and after some back and forth, Tommy agrees to give Alfie 35% of his business. Tommy walks out to greet James, who is very much alive.\n\nTommy has gotten the murder charge against Arthur withdrawn after three months, just in time to join the Lees and head off to the races.\n\nPolly has empited the company safe, laying a load of cash in front of Michael and telling him to take the money and start a new life for himself away from Birmingham. She would like to persuade him further, but has her own errand to run.\n\nMajor Campbell is taking absolutely no chances with Tommy's assassination, and wants him taken out as soon as its done. He uses the help of the Ulster Volunteer Force.\n\nBefore they get to the races, Tommy explains to the Peaky Blinders and their gypsy allies that they must take over Darby Sabini's race track licenses, and that he will be creating a diversion to distract the police from their actions.\n\nAt Epsom, Tommy speaks to May, telling her that he will meet her when he is done with his tasks for the day. He is just about to kick his plan into gear at the races when he gets accosted by Grace, who tells him that she is pregnant and carrying his child. He tells Grace that he will meet with her at the end of the day to speak further.\n\nTommy enlists the help of his secretary, ex-prostitute Lizzie Stark to help him carry out his plan. Her job is to distract Field Marshal Henry Russell by taking him off somewhere private.\n\nA packed bar clears as the start of the race is announced, leaving just Tommy and Major Campbell alone. Campbell yet retains his sense of self-deluded righteousness, while Tommy tells him \"today, it will be me dead or you. But whoever it is, they will wake up in hell tomorrow.\"\n\nTommy's plan doesn't exactly turn out as he hoped. He is delayed in getting to Lizzie, who is sexually assaulted by the Field Marshal Henry Russell.\n\nWhen Tommy does arrive, his gun jams, but he grabs his target's own pistol and shoots Russell dead.\n\nThe assassination is the diversion that Arthur, John and the Peaky Blinders gang need to hold up Darby Sabini's bookmakers and burn their licenses while the police are distracted.\n\nTommy's smug showdown with an apparently defeated Darby Sabini is only ruined when Campbell's hired men rush in and kidnap Tommy, placing him in a vehicle and driving off.\n\nGrace and May wait for Tommy to turn up but instead find each other. May speaks of the business allegiance she has with Tommy, while Grace reminds her that the horse Grace's Secret is named after herself.\n\nPolly Shelby corners Major Campbell in a phone booth whilst he is on the phone with Winston Churchill bragging about his success, and aptly shoots him in the chest. The matriach strides through the bar with a bloodstain on her dress as behind her, Campbell slumps to the ground dying in the booth.\n\nTommy is carted out to an abandoned field where he faces certain death. He faces his execution with a mixture of anger at the approaching end to his weary acceptance that death has stalked him much of his life. But after Tommy enjoys his final cigarette, one of the three would-be assassins shoots the other two in the head and leaves Tommy lying in a grave, confused and alive. The man says \"At some point in the near future, Mr. Churchill will want to speak to you in person, Mr. Shelby. He has a job for you.\" He tells Tommy to go home.\n\nBack in his office, Michael Gray informs Tommy that he has turned down Polly's money to work for Tommy and make real money. Tommy speaks with him and also makes an announcement that he is planning on getting married.\n\nJune[]\n\nJune 10\n\nJudy Garland is born.\n\nJune 28\n\nErik Bauersfeld is born.\n\nAugust[]\n\nAugust 9\n\nPerla Robinson is born.\n\nAugust 19\n\nJucepi Giordano Leone is born in Sicily.\n\nSeptember[]\n\nSeptember 17\n\nCharles Shelby is born to Tommy Shelby and Grace Burgess.\n\nSeptember 26\n\nAngelo Corleone is awarded the Navy Cross and is pictured in the Life Magazine.\n\nOctober[]\n\nOctober 25\n\nThe Russian Civil War ends.\n\nNovember[]\n\nNovember 6\n\nCharles Laveau officially founds his worldwide movement against the Sheriff Walter \"Slim\" Beaumont, at his compound on the edge of the Bayou in the outskirts area of Delray Hollow.\n\nNovember 22\n\nArseny Pavel Janus is born in Belarus.\n\nDecember[]\n\nDecember 7\n\nArthur Andrews is born.\n\nDecember 30\n\nThe Soviet Union is founded.\n\n1923[]\n\nJanuary[]\n\nJanuary 14\n\nBest Oil is founded as a part of Trago Gasoline and Oil Company.\n\nJanuary 29\n\nThomas Burke is diagnosed with live cancer and given 6-8 months to live.\n\nFebruary[]\n\nFebruary 5\n\nJon Gravelli is born in Meadow Hills, Liberty City.\n\nFebruary 6\n\nAngelo Corleone returns home to New York, but decides to help out Vito Corleone with some business in New Bordeaux.\n\nAngelo travel to New Bordeaux instead of Vito Corleone and takes care of some business. Angelo arrive in New Bordeaux, to help out Vito Corleone with some business in New Bordeaux.\n\nUpon arrival, Angelo is greeted by his brother and best friend Ellies. The two share a hug and a cold beer as they catch up with one another, they get in Angelo's car to drive them home.\n\nAlong the way, Ellis tells of their father's and Rabuto's anticipation of Angelo's return and brings up how he's been dealing marijuana through a friend in Empire Bay behind their father's back. When his friend suggested branching into heroin, he decided to suggest it to Sammy and their father and Rabuto flipped out, saying they don't need the feds up their ass and he will have no part in dealing dope to children of the neighborhood.\n\nEllis continues to say he and Giorgio decided to go in on it together and as long as they stay out of Delray Hollow and Frisco Fields their fathers will never know. They will sell mostly in the French Ward and Giorgio's Uncle Lou won't say a word as long as he gets a taste of the action.\n\nWhen Ellis suggests Angelo come in with them, he tells him that he is unsure and he just wants to lay low for a while and just helps their father with minor of mostly legal operations in New Bordeaux.\n\nAs they enter the bar, Sammy Rabuto is overjoyed to see his godson back in New Bordeaux, and they share a drink and toast as Sammy expresses his pride in his godson. Angelo is also reunited with another one of his mentors, Padre Giacomo, whom he is known since his days in Santa Michelle's Orphanage.\n\nAfter the homecoming, a tired Angelo decides to spend his night in the basement rather than his bedroom, amusing his brother Ellis as he does.\n\nFebruary 7\n\nThe next morning, Angelo discovers Sammy and Ellis arguing about money and asks what is going on. Sammy claims he has things under control but Ellis disagrees, storming out of the room.\n\nWhen Angelo asks what has Ellis so riled up, Sammy says they are having problems with the Haitian Mob but avoids discussing it further. Instead he sends Angelo off to help Padre Giacomo at the soup kitchen.\n\nAngelo tells the Padre that he was only home say his goodbyes and then he was off to California to start a new life \"working in a shipyard as an apprentice welder\"; however, this plan changed once Angelo found out about Sammy's trouble with the Haitians.\n\nWhile serving gumbo at the Warm Hearts Neighborhood Kitchen, Angelo makes small talk with some of Delray Hollow's locals. Suddenly the Haitian Mob shows up and begins shooting the place up.\n\nAfter Angelo has taken care of them, he returns home to get the truth from Sammy about what is really going on.\n\nSammy explains that six or seven months ago folks in the Hollow started getting robbed, and it didn't take long for them to figure out it was the Haitians. Soon after they went after the lottery, a numbers racket that is the major source of legal revenue for the New Bordeaux faction of the Corleone crime family. Their income from the lottery was impacted to the point that they were three months behind in their kickbacks to Sal Marcano.\n\nWhile Sammy says he can deal with Marcano, he agrees its time to put an end to the Haitian probelm and sends Ellis and Angelo to handle it. He explains the Haitians must be holed up in an old shanty town in the Bayou and gives Angelo a number to call for the weapons. He insists this be done away from there, as the last thing people in their neighborhood need to see is racial crimes of white men killing black men or vice versa. He wants it done quiet. He warns them both to be careful because the Haitians are a hard people, not to be underestimated.\n\nAngelo makes his way through the Haitian camp until he reaches their leader, Baka Desir. He tells him he made a big mistake by going after folks in the Hollow, and he breaks his neck. To his surprise, an angered and emotional woman suddenly appears from a cupboard and begins cursing and beating on his dead corpse.\n\nShe claims he had kept her prisoner, beat and used her repeatedly; when Angelo tries to reassure her that its over, she claims it will never be over, and runs out.\n\nAfter making his way back out of the camp, Angelo meets with Ellis and the two make their escape. On the way back, Ellis explains that this thing with the Haitians has been weighing heavily on Rabuto and that he has begun to think that Rabuto no longer has it in him to deal with things anymore. He is afraid that if the day comes that Sammy is longer around, and the same with their father Vito, everyone will be relying on them and they need to be ready. Angelo insists that is a long way off.\n\nBack at the bar, Sammy tells Angelo how the local news shows the names of the boys killed in the war and how Angelo's father used to watch and wonder if that was the day he finally sees Angelo's name on the list. Angelo shrugs it off, saying that never happened, but Sammy says a man has only so much luck in life.\n\nHe lets Angelo in on a plan to set things right with Sal Marcano as Vito Corleone made a deal with Marcano years earlier, and tells Angelo to meet Marcano at the country club the next day. Sammy explains that he needs to do whatever Sal asks, for all their sake. Angelo agrees.\n\nFebruary 8\n\nThe next day, Angelo meets Giorgi at the country club, and the two spend a moment reminiscing before they join Sal and Angelo is introduced to Vito Scamenta. Having served in the military himself, Vito inquires about Angelo service record before excusing himself as Sal and Angelo get down to business.\n\nOnce he is gone, Sal complains about how Vito has been a pain ever since the Commission sent him down from Empire Bay fifteen years earlier. He the explains why he asked to meet Angelo and goes over the plan for the Federal Reserve job with him. He then brings up the problem Sammy has been having with taking care of business. Impressed with Angelo's quick action in resolving Sammy's problem, he suggests that its time to make a change in leadership.\n\nThinking Sal is referring to Ellis, Angelo says he doesn't think he is ready to take over just yet. Sal interrupts and lets Angelo know that he wants him running Delray Hollow and the New Bordeaux Corleone faction, an offer he quickly refuses out of loyalty to Sammy Rabuto and everything he has done for him. Sal claims to be a little disappointed but says that he gets where Angelo is coming from and expresses approval over his loyalty.\n\nWhen Angelo asks if Sal still wants him to do this deal, Sal says he definitely does and gives his word that when the job is done Angelo should be more than square with him.\n\nFebruary 12\n\nThomas Burke, Danny's father and owner of Burke's Iron & Metal wanted his son to take part in the Federal Reserve heist in the hope that Sal Marcan would forgive him and return his home district of Pointe Verdun to him run again.\n\nBurke developed the special drill the group was to use to drill through the vault floor and is busy testing it out when Angelo arrives at the scrapyard.\n\nAngelo the the boys have a beer and catch up, while Thomas goes over the plan with them, explaining how they will need a boat to move the drill into position through the canals.\n\nAfterwards, Angelo and Giorgi leave to finalize their plans.\n\nFebruary 13\n\nAngelo Corleone and his friend Giorgio Marcano are in Bayou Fantom making their final preparations for a job they are about to do, robbing the Federal Reserve.\n\nOnce they are finished, Angelo and Giorgi gets into the armored truck and make their way to the job.\n\nAlong the way, the two discuss the poor sap they left behind. Giorgi asks Angelo about his time in France and Italy, and he tells a shocking story about a woman who tossed her baby into the water after being told she was only allowed to bring one thing on board the evacuation boat, her baby or the pig she had with her. Her reasoning for this was that she could always have another baby.\n\nAs they approach the Federal Reserve, Giorgi tells Angelo that the guards may not be keen on him carrying a gun, so Angelo decides to leave it under the seat. He also apologizes in advance for any racial insults the guards may give toward Angelo and says that if he goes along with it, its nothing personal.\n\nAngelo and Giorgi pass off their forged IDs and get into the building posing as part of the burn crew bringing in old currency for disposal. They have $238,546 in mostly in small bills. The money is supplied by Vito Scamenta, an associate of Giorgi's father who runs the Italian gang, which represents part of his end of the job.\n\nGiorgi leads the way while Angelo carries the money to the burn room in the basement. When they arrive Giorgi distracts the guard with idle conversation while Angelo takes him out, after which they break into the vault room and Angelo again takes out the guards in there.\n\nOnce everything is clear, Angelo and Giorgi breaks into the vault with a combination Vito managed to get his hands on and begin bagging up the cash. Unfortunately Giorgi triggers an alarm when he enters a second secure cage and all hell breaks loose. The two now have to hold off the guards until their friends Danny and Ellis finish drilling their way up from the cistern below.\n\nAngelo and Giorgi are still holding off the guards as they await Danny and Ellis breaking through from below. After several minutes, Angelo says the guards will cut them down the second they try to leave so Danny needs to get them out now.\n\nDanny gets the idea of using dynamite to blow the hole bigger so the two can drop down to them. Things don't go as simple as planned, as they bring the entire vault down to the canals below, pinning Danny's leg under the rubble.\n\nThe group gets in the boat just as they need to escape the police chasing them through the canals beneath the city.\n\nWhen they finally do they head to the streets above and attempt to blend in with the crowd of Mardi Gras revelers as they look for a payphone to call for a ride.\n\nBecause Danny's leg is badly injured, Angelo decides to carry him, hoping to pass him off as drunk if anyone notices.\n\nAs they work their way through the crowded streets, they get to a phone and call Sammy, who tells them to meet at a nearby grocery store where he will have a car waiting. However, its not until they realize the police have their description and are currently looking for them. Angelo decides to split up and let his friends get away while he causes a distraction for the cops.\n\nWhile his friends head off, Angelo fires a shot in the air, and then leads the police on a chase through the French Ward, eventually making it to his friends in the waiting car; however, Giorgi somehow got separated from them.\n\nAfter evading the police, three head back to the bar, where Sammy counts it up as a little over 2 million dollars per split and sets aside what he owes Sal, throwing in a little extra for his trouble. As they rejoice and celebrate their windfall, Sammy declares that this isn't just money, its freedom, and no one will be standing over any of them again.\n\nAs they toast their success, Sal and Giorgi Marcano arrive and join in the celebration. Sal recounts how he heard things went sideways and Angelo had to save their asses, telling Sammy he should be proud of him. While he brings his men to collect his cut, he kisses Sammy (also known as the \"Kiss of Death\") once on each cheek as he nods to his son Giorgi.\n\nAs Sal distracts the group with calls for celebration, Giorgi tells Angelo he is possibly the baddest motherfucker he has ever laid his eyes on as he pulls out his gun and tells him he shouldn't have said no as he shoots him in the head (Angelo falls to the floor and starts bleeding from the bullet hole in the head, due to his loss of angelic immortality, for a reason unknown to Angelo, but in reality, its because he deep down wants to get closer to humanity, and celestials self-actualize with it affecting them in every way). Ellis is then stabbed numerous times by Ritchie Darwin, and Danny is shot in the head by Giorbi while Sal shoots Sammy several times in the back, firing one last round into his temple.\n\nAs they leave, Giorgi sets fire to the bar and the bar slowly starts to burn down.\n\nPadre Giacomo has a feeling that something is wrong at Sammy's bar, and drives from French Ward and down to the Hollow, to confirm that nothing is wrong. That night, Giacomo doesn't know what brought him there at Sammy's bar. Luck, divine providence, or something else (by divine providence he means God almighty sending him a sign of his son, the Devil, is in trouble. With this being the only time that God would ever care about his own son. God also told Giacomo in that prayer, that Angelo is Lucifer Morningstar, the Devil, and that Angelo's real name is Samael).\n\nAs Giacomo arrives, he finds Angelo barely alive and unconscious on the floor and drags him to safety. As he did so, Angelo wake up long enough to tell him to call his brother, Jim Corleone, and so he did immediately.\n\nDue to his loss of angelic immortality, Angelo spends the next two months in a coma recovering, while Padre Giacomo tends to his injuries the best he can.\n\nFebruary 25\n\nVinewood sign is built.\n\nMarch[]\n\nMarch 2\n\nHollywood sign is built.\n\nMarch 8\n\nThe Shelby family, most notably Tommy Shelby, begins living at the Arrow house after Tommy Shelby bought the place.\n\nMarch 14\n\nThe British Colonial Office attempts to settle the racial problems in Kenya.\n\nMarch 15\n\nHolis Dupree is arrested for the murder of two young black men, Lamont Harris and Trey McCall, due to the color of their skin, and he tries to pass it off as him fearing for his life and murdering them in self-defense.\n\nMarch 21\n\nFrancis Jonathan Smith is born in Riverdale.\n\nMarch 25\n\nSix weeks later, when Angelo finally recovers, John fills him in on what he has learned about the Marcano crime family. The Father tries to dissuade Angelo from the path he is planning to go down, telling that none of this is going to bring any of them back. Angelo explains that its not about bringing them back, or even exacting some street justice. Its about making Sal Marcano feel what its like to lose everything, and Angelo says to watch as he takes it all away from him. Father Giacomo gives him one final warning, \"This is a one-way road, Angelo, and once start down it, there ain't no turning back.\"\n\nAs he walks out, Angelo replies, \"You taught us kids to turn the other cheek, not fight back. Problem is, that don't work. Not in the real world.\"\n\nAs Angelo drives to Sammy's Bar, he and John discuss their conversation with Father Giacomo. John is worried the Padre might cause problems for them, but Angelo reassures him that Father Giacomo knows every low-life thing he has ever done in the past and has yet to rat him out.\n\nWhen John asks what his plans are, Angelo explains that after he got back Marcano offered him the Hollow, saying it was time for Sammy to retire. He thinks his refusing Sal's offer is what got everyone killed. John explains that its not like Sal was going to throw Sammy a retirement part, what there is only one way out of that life and Angelo knows that.\n\nWhen pressed, Angelo reveals his plan to take over the city, district by district. Marcano wanted him to run th Hollow, but by the time he is done he will be running the whole city. This is exactly what John wanted to hear, but asks if Angelo thinks he is up to it after being shot in the head, due to losing his immortality. Angelo says while he may have lost a step or two, but it will come back to him. It always does.\n\nJohn also explains that most of the cops in New Bordeaux are in Sal's pocket and if they see him fighting with Marcano's goons, they will come after him every time. Angelo shrugs it off, and John tells him \"Remember that you aren't immortal anymore, so you be careful\". Angelo exits the car as he replies \"I know, brother, I don't need immortality while fighting and killing weak humans, so don't you worry.\" John tells him that they will figure out how Angelo can get his angelic immortality back; right before Angelo walks away.\n\nAs Angelo enters the burned out shell of Sammy's bar, he is suddenly overcome with flashbacks of the night his family was massacred, reliving the moment they were killed on by one.\n\nShaking it off, Angelo heads into the basement, where he remembers Sammy telling him the story of the pocket watch he gave him when he headed off to the war back in January 1915. As the memories flash through his mind he uses his combat knife to shave his head and face.\n\nMarch 27\n\nAfter being called over to his house by Father Giacomo, Angelo arrives at the Father's house. They begin to talk and Giacomo tells him that God came to him in a prayer and told him that Angelo is the Devil, also known as Lucifer Morningstar, and that he is birth name is Samael. Angelo then tells Father Giacomo everything from the beginning of time till now, for example; how the multiverse was created, and how he was cast from Heaven.\n\nMarch 28\n\nThe following morning, Angelo leaves Sammy's bar and heads over to the Blue Gulf Motel, where John has set up his tac-center and has planned the takeover of the Marcano crime family. Using equipment he stole from the FBI, John has managed to set up a state-of-the-art intelligence gathering and tactical operations center where he will gather all the intel Angelo will need to take over the Marcano crime family.\n\nWhile Angelo was convalescing, John did some digging around looking for local assets to recruit and came up with three possibilities. For now, Angelo is most concerned with Delray Hollow, so John tells him of the Haitian Mob, who are back up and running after Angelo killed their leader, Baka Desir. They are not pleased that Marcano has given the Hollow to the Dixie Mafia to run and Angelo is just as determined not to let them destroy everything Sammy had built up.\n\nWhile John doesn't know who replaced Baka, he knows where they hang out and suggests Angelo interrogate one of them to get to their boss. He tells Angelo that once he is done to come back because he is about to finish something Angelo will want to see.\n\nAngelo then heads over to the Haitian warehouse where they are known to hang out and waits for someone to show up.\n\nMarch 29\n\nAfter waiting for 25 hours someone finally shows up, Angelo interrogates him, he is told that he will find their leader at the Pierced Heart voodoo shop.\n\nAfter breaking into the shop, Angelo waits for the leader to arrive.\n\nThe leader shows up at the Pierced Heart, and to Angelo's surprise its the same woman he saw with Baka Desir at the Haitian Camp; it seems her being held there against her will was all an act. He tells her he wants her help taking down Marcano, and she says that a few months ago he was trying to kill her but now he wants her help. Angelo says that with Marcano backing the Dixie Mafia, it won't be long before they come after her and the Haitians.\n\nCassandra explains that the reason Sammy and her were at war was because he was two-faced, pretending to care about his district while being in Marcano's back pocket and doing what he was told. She demands that once she has control over the Hollow, she runs it as she sees fit, on questions asked. Angelo agrees on the condition that he would be given access to Cassandra's muscle and connections and that he also maintains 90% of profits every week and month.\n\nShe explains that Marcano replaced Sammy with Ritchie Darwin, an evil man who likes to torture young colored girls by taking them into the woods and hunting them like animals. She claims he killed her sister that way, saying a small locket is all she has left of her. She tells Angelo that Darwin's men operate out of the First Baptist Church and an old theater called Carmela's, named after Don Corleone's wife Carmela. She suggest Angelo start by talking with Charles \"The Voice\" Laveau, one of her men who can tell him more about the operation.\n\nCassandra Fayette is then officially recruited by Angelo Corleone into his part of the Corleone crime family; The New Bordeaux faction.\n\nApril[]\n\nApril 2\n\nAngelo meets with Charles Laveau, aka \"The Voice\", to find out more about the prostitution racket being run out of Carmela's. He tells Angelo that its run by Michael Baskin, who turned it into a brothel and forces black women to work as prostitutes, pleasing the desires of white men. He says that if Angelo lets those girls go, he will likely get Baskin's attention. He suggests Angelo start by speaking with Sheila, a woman who works the coat check at Carmela's.\n\nOnce he is through with saving the young black girls, John calls Angelo back to his tac-center to give him a portable radio to use for contracting his various associates. Angelo then heads back to speak with the Voice, who tells him that bringing down Baskin's pimps, \"Dirty\" Gert Delong and \"Rooster\" Russell DeSaulniers, should be enough to bring Baskin out of hiding.\n\nApril 3\n\nOnce they are dead, Angelo heads back to Carmela's the following morning, where he kills Michael Baskin and hands the place over to Cassandra Fayette to run for him.\n\nLater on, Angelo meets with John, who fills him in on the heroin racket run out of the First Baptist Church by Charlie Kincaid. He says Charlie stays away, so Angelo will have to put the squeeze on his operation to get him to turn up. From what John can gather, Charlie is only in it for the money, so they think he may beturned to work for them. John then tells Angelo about New Bordeaux's communication grid and that getting a system of wiretaps up and running should be fairly easy. All Angelo has to do is install a TL-49 Fuse on each Junction Box and he can listen in on intel for the whole area.\n\nAfter this, Angelo sets off to take down the smack racket. He interrogates Charlie's pushers, one of whom is his cousin Nathaniel, who tells him about Charlie's enforcers, Doug Marcheti and Deacon Caruso, whom Angelo kills.\n\nApril 4\n\nOnce he has torn down the entire operation, Angelo gets word from John that Charlie's wife is expecting a baby soon. This leads John to believe that Angelo will be able to turn Charlie and have him work for them.\n\nAfter Angelo confronts and recruits Charlie into his organization, he turns the operation over to Cassandra Fayette to run.\n\nApril 5\n\nAngelo walks into the Pierced Heart to find Cassandra sharpening a knife as Jesse, a member of the Dixie Mafia, sits tied to a chair. Angelo questions him for the whereabouts of Ritchie Darwin and Jesse says he is hiding out at Baron Saturday's Fun Park with a group of his men because Giorgi Marcano is on the warpath and wants Ritchie dead.\n\nAfter Jesse spills all he knows, Angelo takes Cassandra's knife and cuts him loose, allowing him to leave. When Cassandra protests, Angelo says he is no threat to anyone and to let him run on home to his mama.\n\nNext, Angelo heads to Baron Saturday's and works through the men until he corners Ritchie in the park office.\n\nDragging him back into the park, Angelo tells Ritchie he is there not for his heroin but to make him pay for what he did to Sammy Rabuto and his brother, Ellis Corleone.\n\nRitchie tries to talk his way out of it by saying it was all Giorgi's idea, but Angelo doesn't care. As Angelo ties Ritchie's neck to the Ferris wheel, he begs for his life, saying the decent thing to do would be to let a man get in a prayer before you kill him. Angelo replies that he can pray on the way up, then starts the ride.\n\nWith the Dixie Mafia out of the way, Angelo and Cassandra need to talk about what is next for the Hollow.\n\nAngelo returns to Cassandra and lets her know Darwin is dead. She questions Angelo's choice of stringing him up on the Ferris wheel, and he says that after killing Sammy and Ellis, he got what he deserved. Cassandra then quotes Psalms 58:10, saying \"The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.\" She then tells Angelo that goes both ways.\n\nCassandra explains that her men are struggling with the notion that they now have to answer to the same man who killed Baka Desir and wiped out half their numbers. Cassandra says that gestures carry weight, and if Angelo were to help her man Emmanuel, that is a gesture that would go a long way to calm their nerves. She explains that he oversees her reefer operation at the boathouse. If Angelo helps him, she will see to it that he gets a portion of the profits.\n\nAngelo makes his intentions clear, telling her that he expects a portion of everything, not just the weed, as it will cost a lot of money to take down Marcano. Angelo tells her that he expects 90% of the profits of everthing, and that if she refuses he will kill her and drag her soul to Hell. Cassandra assures him he will get his cut and the two part ways.\n\nApril 15\n\nA few days later, Angelo heads back over to John's motel room to see the other potential allies he managed to dig up. Angelo is shown the dossiers on two of the city's finest scumbags, Thomas Burke and Vito Scamenta.\n\nOnce John brief him, Angelo heads out to see them both.\n\nAngelo goes to see Vito at Benny's Ristorante in River Row, only to find a group of Sal Marcano's men guarding the place while one of them beats Vito inside.\n\nOnce Angelo rescues Vito, the two talk and decide to work together to take down Marcano.\n\nApril 16\n\nAngelo goes to see Connie Demarco, who tells him about the contraband racket run by Roy Thibideaux. He informs Angelo that if he busts up the contraband racket enough he will definitely get Roy's attention.\n\nLater that day, after busting up Roy Thibideaux's racket, Angelo confronts and recruits Roy Thibideaux into his organization.\n\nApril 17\n\nThe next morning, Angelo speaks with Jock Blanchard to find out about the union extortion racket run by Andy Turetto. It seems Turetto is squeezing everyone for more union dues, and those who can't pay don't get a permit to work.\n\nAngelo confronts and recruits Andy Turetto into his organization.\n\nApril 24\n\nAngelo heads to the slums of River Row to meet up with Vito. Greece is holed up in a shack at the end of the block with some prostitutes. As they approach, a group of Marcano's men show up and Greece jumps out a window and takes off. Angelo and Vito get into Vito's car and chase after him. Angelo suddenly notices Greece is driving his car and wonders how he got his hands on it.\n\nThe two chase him down and Angelo knocks him out cold before putting him in the trunk of Vito's car. Unfortunately all the commotion has attracted the attention of the police and now they need to lose them.\n\nAfter that, they take back to Vito's place, where he goes to work on Greece. They finds out that Sal was worried Vito knew about his casino plans and would blab to the Commission about it.\n\nAs it turns out, Vito and Angelo knew nothing about the casino, so they question him further and find out that Sal has paid off a lot of politicians to get the laws changed, making gambling legal in New Bordeaux.\n\nOnce they have all the information Greece knows, Vito turns on his chum grinder to dispose of Greece and turn him into fish food. Michael Greece is presumed dead to the public and Marcano crime family.\n\nWith River Row back under Vito's control, Angelo reminds him of their deal, and that he expects a 90% cut of everything he makes. Vito then says Angelo could go see his associate Alma Diaz to see if she needs any help supplying the rackets with profitable contraband.\n\nA few hours later, Angelo goes to see Burke at Duffy's Irish Pub in Point Verdun. He will be reluctant to join Angelo, forcing him to take Burke on a madman drive until he gives in.\n\nAfterwards, Angelo meets with Burke back at Burke's Iron & Metal and they discuss the situation in Pointe Verdun.\n\nApril 25\n\nAngelo speaks with Nicki Burke, who tells him the man running the Sweetwater Distillery is named Carl Bevers. His family runs their shine through the business and sells it to local shops. He moves his stills around, but rumor has it he keeps a map for his drivers. Angelo decides the best way forward would be to convince one of them to tell him where that map is.\n\nAfter disrupting Bevers' racket up enough, Angelo goes to Sweetwater Distilley and confronts Carl Bevers, and Angelo recruits Bevers into his organization.\n\nLater on, Angelo goes to Mr. O'Connor's Irish Pub to talk with Bear Donnelly, who tells him about Sonny Blue and his protection racket. He apparently lets the Butcher's loan shark and protection guys use the facility for their operations, but Sonny only comes around when he needs to scare his people into shape. They are currently holding one of their own, a man named Ralph McNairy, who was caught skimming and sent there until he gives up where he stated the money. Bear thinks he may give up the goods if Angelo was to get him out of the situation he is in.\n\nAngelo return to Roberdeaux Meat Packing Plant.\n\nWhen he confronts Sonny Blue, Angelo decide to recruit him into his organization, and takes over the Roberdeaux Meat Packing plant aka Protection racket.\n\nApril 26\n\nAngelo arrives at Burke's to find him making preparations for the Butcher's arrival.\n\nAngelo is surprised to hear he is coming there, but as it turns out Burke just got off the phone with him, having told him that if he wanted to settle up, he would be waiting there. This angers Angelo, who tells Burke that you never tell your enemy where you will be setting up an ambush. Burke, however, thinks Angelo is taking things way too seriously.\n\nJust then Nicki Burke rushes in and says that the Butcher is hot on her tail and that she will head up the tower and calls them out with the spotlight as they arrive. Burke shows Angelo some barrels full of a petrol mix he is located around the area, stating that a bullet will set them off and take out whoever is nearby. He sends Angelo up to the roof while he heads to the top of the tower to snipe the Butcher's men just as they begin arriving. Burke gives Angelo one final piece of advice, that if he tries to cut and run, he will plant him in the ground himself.\n\nAfter the group has taken out all of the Butcher's men, Angelo goes after him. As he lay on the ground, he attempts to fire an empty weapon at Angelo, who suggests he should have saved a bullet or two. As Burke explains what he has planned for him, the Butcher warns the two that they will be dead next, before being hauled off to meet whatever fate Burke has in store for him.\n\nMay[]\n\nMay 4\n\nOne week later, Angelo meets with Burke, he finds him drunkenly singing \"The Last Rose of Summer\", an old Irish ditty, while drinking moonshine from a mason jar. He says to Angelo that when they first met he thought to himself that \"This Chalky bastard is either the luckiest son-of-a-bitch that ever lived, or the kind of man who invites rotten damn luck.\" Burke was sure it was the latter but admits he was wrong about Angelo.\n\nAngelo suggests he thank him by calling him by his name, to which Burke agrees. Burke goes on to say how he is spent his whole life scratching and clawing at anyone who came along, even if they were there to help, and it had gotten him nowhere. There is no sense in changing, and the only way is forward.\n\nAngelo lets him know that with Irish Point back in his hands, he will be expecting Burke to bring in as much money as he can, giving 90% to Angelo, as going after Marcano will be expensive. While Burke isn't happy having someone looming over him, he says a deal is a deal. Before heading off to torture Barbero, he tells Angelo to speak with Nicki, who will need help getting the moonshine operation up and running.\n\nMay 16\n\nTwo weeks later, Angelo calls his first sitdown with his new capos at the Eaglehurst Plantation to explain the plan to take down Sal Marcano.\n\nAfter the three arrive, they begin to argue and threaten one another. Angelo enters and puts a stop to their fighting, saying its going to take all of them to take down Marcano, so he doesn't want to hear any more of this nonsense. He says that it doesn't matter if they trust one another, because he doesn't trust any of them, while reminding them that it doesn't change the fact that he dismantled Roman Barbero's operations, killed Ritchie Darwin and his Dixie Mafia goons and saved Vito from being killed by Greece's men. Angelo informs them that they can either fall in line or get out now, but anyone who leaves will get their name added to his list, right beneath Marcano's.\n\nOnce they settle down, Angelo lays out his plan. To bring down an organization the size of Marcano's, they need to eliminate the people at its base and then work their way up. Just killing Marcano won't accomplish anything, as one of his brothers will take over and they will be right back where they started. So they will go after the lieutenants first, seizing their territory before moving onto the capos. Once the lieutenants and capos are gone, Marcano will be on his own and vulnerable. That is when they will go after him.\n\nThe territory they take over along the way will be divided up as Angelo sees fit.\n\nFinally, Angelo fills them in on Sal's casino project in North Lake, and how he plans to go legit once its complete. All of Sal's money is tied up in it, so once he figures out what they are up to, his options will be limited. More importantly, its an emotional attachment. Emotions make people irrational and greedy, so that is where they will hit him.\n\nAfter the meeting, Angelo speaks with John. He tells him that the photos were a nice touch, but he is going to need more actionable intel on the lieutenants, such as their places of business and where he can find them. John assures him they will be ready when he is and says he is even managed to recruit some \"concerned citizens\" who will be more than happy to share what they know about the Marcano crime family.\n\nMay 18\n\nThomas Burke finally kills Roman Barbero after three weeks of torturing Barbero.\n\nMay 21\n\nAngelo stops by Benny's Ristorante to find Vito cooking his mother's bucatini recipe. He asks if she still lives in Empire Bay, but Vito explains that she passed a while ago. When Angelo goes on to ask if he has any folks back in Empire Bay, Vito remains silent for a moment, then hands him a newspaper. Its an article about Chet Carbonale, a city councilman who is up for re-election. He tells Angelo he needs a favor.\n\nVito Scamenta enlists the help of Angelo Corleone to kill the men he believes responsible for the death of his friend, Joe Balvano.\n\nVito explains that Carbonale and his pals killed a friend of his, and its taken him twelve years and a lot of money to track this guy down. He says he will make it worth his while, as well as consider it a personal favor. Vito says the guy is a real prick and nobody can stand him, so Angelo ought to be able to find someone to give up his location easily.\n\nIn Downtown, Angelo interrogates Stan Caramanci, Albert Pinto, Scott Roget. When they give Angelo the location of Carbonale, he recruits Stan Caramanci, Albert Pinto, and Scott Roget into his organization.\n\nAngelo travel to Frisco Fields, and upon arrival, he confronts and kills Chet Carbonale and his men.\n\nAngelo returns to River Row, and tells Vito that Carbonale is dead and so is his men.\n\nMay 25\n\nThe next name Vito gives Angelo is Nestor Rourke, or Nestor the Molester as Vito refers to him. Nestor deals smut for peep shows. He suggests Angelo talk to his old crew, Mikey \"Patch\" Venditti, Edgar \"Smokey\" Berlusconi, and Leonard Ferrante, until one of them gives up his location.\n\nAngelo interrogates Venditti, Berlusconi, and Ferrante. When they give him the location of Rourke, Angelo decide to recruit them.\n\nIn Southdowns, Angelo confronts and kills Rourke and wipes out his whole crew.\n\nAfter returning to Vito in River Row, Angelo tells him and Rourke and his crew are all dead.\n\nMay 26\n\nThe Ensanglante cult reemerge in New Bordeaux after years in hiding.\n\nJune[]\n\nJune 4\n\nThe next name on Vito's list is Paulie Biancardi. As it turns, starting with Lucky may have turned out to be a goldmine, with people coming out of the woodwork to pay their respects to the scumbag at his funeral. But the only one Vito cares about is Paulie. If Vito had his way, Paulie would die nice and slow, blubbering for his mother as Vito took him apart piece by pierce. Vito wants Angelo to make him hurt.\n\nIn the cemetery in Southdowns, Chet Carbonale's funeral is held. Upon arrival, Angelo kills Paulie Biancardi and his crew.\n\nIn River Row, Angelo returns to Benny's Ristorante and tells Vito Biancardi and his men is dead. Vito asks if he made Paulie suffer, but Angelo tells him he did, and if Vito wanted it handled like Greece, he could have brought him back to Vito. Angelo goes on to say that Vito's friend must have been something else if it took all these guys to bring him down. Vito replies that a couple of them sold him out and screwed him when he went to them for help. As for how they all ended up in New Bordeaux, Vito explains that the Commission gives Sal extra leeway on how he runs things, and in return, he takes whoever they send him and makes them part of his organization.\n\nJune 5\n\nThe next guy on Vito's list is Luca Guidi. Being paranoid, Luca is afraid someone is out to get him and has gone into hiding. Vito suggests that Angelo put the fear of God into some of his men until one sees the light and gives him up.\n\nAfter interrogating Heath Matarazzo, Lucio Fabrizi, and Pluto Rapino, they give Angelo the location of Guidi and he decide to recruit Matarazzo, Fabrizi, and Rapino.\n\nAngelo soon learns that Luca is hiding out with his men at his warehouse on the outskirts of Barclay Mills.\n\nUpon arrival, Angelo kills Luca Guidi and his whole crew before returning to Vito in River Row.\n\nJune 6\n\nThe last guy on Vito's list is Dario Murtas. Dario thinks he is a tough guy, actually calling Vito and telling him where he would be; hiding out at his island stronghold in Bayou Fantom.\n\nIn Bayou Fantom, Angelo kills Dario Murtas and all his men. Once he is dealt with, Angelo returns to Vito, who tells a sombering tale of his best friend Joe Balvano and the series of events that led to his death.\n\nVito tells Angelo that after Vito and Joe killed Falzone, the two leave the observatory. Joe is uneasy when he notices a large group of Varganzi's men outside, but Vito assures him everything is alright. While Vito joins Leo Gifacchi in his limo, Joe is led to another vehicle with some of Varganzi's men for what he thinks is going to be a night of celebration at the cathouse. A short while into the drive, the car he is riding in turns a different direction from Vito's. Joe was being taken to answer for his role in starting a war with the Triads.\n\nVito continues the conversation by saying four or five years after Vito was sent to New Bordeaux, he got word that one of the guys he had seen driving off with Joe was running his mouth. He was drunk, unable to hold his liquor, and was overheard going on about some loudmouth Leo Gifacchi wanted him to put down. That same loudmouth cost this guy his front teeth and cracked one of his eye sockets. Vito knew nobody would take Joe Balvano down without a fight.\n\nVito ends the conversation with saying Joe got loose and left Empire Bay, eventually going to Chicago thinking a couple of guys up there help, but instead they turned on him. In the end, they beat Joe relentlessly. Cut his hands off. Smashed his face all to hell. When it was over, they didn't leave much for anybody to find.\n\nWhen Angelo asks if he was sure it was Joe, Vito replies confidently that if it wasn't him - if Joe was still alive, he would have found a way to contact him by now.\n\nJune 8\n\nAt Cassandra's request, Angelo heads to the First Baptist Church and meets with Emmanuel to see what help he needs. Emmanuel isn't happy to be working with Angelo, as what he did to Baka Desir and their at the Haitian Camp is still fresh in his mind.\n\nWhen asked about his past in Haiti, Emmanuel explains that he was a Hougan, or priest, who helped refugees by getting them out of the country and away from President \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier. It was not his choice to leave his home and come to New Bordeaux, but he is trying to make the best of the situation. He gives Angelo the details on the weed runs and sends him on his way.\n\nAfter Angelo returns from the first weed drop, he and Emmanuel speak further. Emmanuel speaks of his wife, who died in Haiti. When Angelo tries to sympathize with him, Emmanuel takes exception and claims their losses are nowhere near the same.\n\nPapa Doc had Emmanuel's wife tortured trying to locate him. His children were bludgeoned to death in order to save bullets. When he last saw his wife her eyes had ruptured from the electro shock. His son's face had been caved in and his little girl had been decapitated. Emmanuel says that he and Angelo have nothing in common, explaining that just because Marcano is an evil man who kills, it doesn't mean his victims are innocent.\n\nAngelo says that innocence is not something that exists around people like them, at least not for long, and he doesn't even remember what it looks like anymore. Emmanuel replies that he used to, but the bloodier he gets, the quicker that picture fades.\n\nJune 9\n\nAfter Angelo returns from his second weed run, he and Emmanuel speak more about his experiences running refugees in Haiti. Angelo asks him how many people he helped escape, to which Emmanuel answers that he can only remember those he could not save.\n\nAngelo calls him on this, saying that he remembers every one of the villagers he helped evacuate in Vietnam, all forty-three of them, and asks again how many Emmanuel got out. He replies two hundred and twenty-six. They ran boats every night for ten months, mostly women and children because men had either enlisted or disappeared. They had more refugees than they knew what to do with. Many of them didn't survive the trip, but dying on the boat running from Papa was better than the alternative.\n\nEmmanuel says that if you would have told him fifteen years ago that all this would happen, he would have called crazy. He believed he would die an old man, surrounded by his family.\n\nJune 13\n\nAfter Alma settled in over at Skidaway Durables, Angelo pays her a visit to see how he can help. She needs someone to keep the warehouses full, which keeps the money coming in, and asks Angelo to start hitting trucks full of contraband from the Dixie Mafia down in Bayou Fantom.\n\nOnce Angelo agrees to help out, Alma goes on to tell Angelo that he didn't just save Vito's life, he brought back the real Vito. She hasn't seen this side of him in a really long time, and she doesn't want him going back to the way he was. She asks what's going to happen after Angelo is done giving Marcano what he deserves, it its back in the freezer for Vito.\n\nAngelo asks her if she would believe him if he said no, to which Alma replies that she wouldn't. However, she believes very few people these days, and if Vito says this is the way things are, then that is how they are. Angelo gives her his word that he wouldn't betray Vito Scamenta. She goes on to suggest that if there are any of Greece's men left in River Row. Angelo should deal with them, which will make it easier to conduct their business.\n\nAngelo enters Alma's office to hear her mumbling to herself in Spanish, \"Cono, no necesito este mierda.\" He asks if there is trouble, to which Alma replies \"Yeah, my whole life\".\n\nShe goes on to explain that she has received a letter from her grandmother, who writes her to wish her mother a happy birthday. Alma saw her mother being dragged away back in Diez De Octubre. She then shakes it off and says its nothing.\n\nAngelo then tells her he has a truck full of contraband stashed and ready for her guys, and that everything went smoothly; he also agrees to help bring in more. Alma tells him that she got a tip from a guy she had sex with the night before about a warehouse she has had her eye on. It turns out that they have some new shipments she wants, and she tells Angelo that if he sees any of their delivery trucks, bring them to her she will see what she can salvage.\n\nJune 14\n\nWhen Angelo returns to Alma, she mentions a song she thought she'd forgotten. Angelo asks if its from Cuba, and she explains that her grandmother had sent her this mental time bomb. The song was playing when the Policia came for her parents.\n\nShe recalls that her father wasn't political, being a clerk for the government, but he had a drinking buddy, Mr. Roberts. He was a white guy, always around and very political. He managed to slip out of the country before Castro started putting down spies and traitors. Her parents weren't so lucky or smart. When the men came for them, her father was shot on the spot and her mother was taken away and never seen again. All she has left is her grandmothers, who managed to get out of the country.\n\nAngelo asks if she has ever thought about going back to look for her mother. Alma says that a few years earlier she heard her mother was at de Pinos before it was shut down, but she didn't hear anything after that. She sometimes thinks Angelo and Vito have the right idea: screw the past and kill everyone that gets in the way of what is coming next.\n\nHowever, Alma does want to know what happened to her mother, if she is alive or not. She thinks she might be able to set aside enough money to smuggle herself back in and see what she can find out, maybe put that part of her life to rest.\n\nJune 19\n\nAngelo and Nicki talk about old times and her brother Danny, and she asks him if he went quick. Angelo tells her that no good can come from going down this road, but Nicki insists, and he tells her that Danny was shot in the head and seemed to go quick. As Angelo is leaving, she suggests that he deal with any of Barbero's men who might still be hanging around the neighborhood.\n\nWhen Angelo returns with the first shipment of moonshine, Nicki mentions running into Denny McGill, a name Angelo hasn't heard in years. Denny is married with four kids, and the oldest, Rachel, is six. Nicki comments that for her to have kids there would have to be some kidn of ransom involved. She then says that people like Denny are always asking her when she is gonna settle down and have a family.\n\nThis makes her feel like there is something wrong with her, but Angelo reassures her that she is doing fine. While he senses that there is more she would like to tell him, Angelo doesn't press the issue further. Instead, he tells her not to worry about what other people think.\n\nJune 20\n\nWhen Angelo returns from the second run, he and Nicki begin to talk of her father. She tells Angelo that her old man is very pleased with him, but her father's feelings toward her are not as good. She admits to Angelo that she is in love with a woman named Darlene, and her father doesn't approve.\n\nWhen Nicki was young, she thought her dad hung the moon and was everything to her, but one day he looked at her like he knew, which broke her heart. Angelo tells Nicki that if she ever turns her back on her father, just make sure she can live with it.\n\nJune 25\n\nBonnie Harless meets a waitress Anna McGee.\n\nJuly[]\n\nJuly 3\n\nBonnie Harless recruits Anna McGee into the Ensanglante cult, believing she is destined to give birth to \"The Blessed\".\n\nJuly 5\n\nAngelo was in a coma when they laid Sammy Rabuto and Angelo's brother Ellis to rest, so he never had a chance to say his goodbyes. Father Giacomo hopes that if he can give Angelo a little closure, maybe they could shift his focus away from the Marcanos, and he might have a chance at a normal life.\n\nThe Father has Angelo drive them to Sammy's Bar where it all began. He tells Angelo that its a hard thing to let go and say goodbye, but Angelo insists that saying goodbye won't give him what he wants.\n\nChanging the subject, the Father brings up Angelo's aunt Lily, saying she called to check up on yesterday. She has it set in her mind to fix up Sammy's Bar despite it being a burned out shell, and she has always been a woman of determination.\n\nGiacomo recalls how after Petra died, Sammy went to a dark place and buried the loss deep down. He started running prostitutes out of the back of the bar at all hours of the night. Finally one night, Lily marched in with the fire of God inside her and kicked out all the girls, Sammy's crew, and even the customers. She laid into Sammy, telling him he was doing wrong by Petra, but more importantly, he was doing wrong by his godsons, sending the message that their godmother didn't matter. From that point on, there was no more prostitution in Sammy's Bar.\n\nWhen they arrive at Sammy's Bar, they are surprised when a young woman carrying a knife comes running out, her hands covered in blood. She runs to them, screaming \"Help me! Oh god, they're coming!\" They look up to see a masked man and his partner walking out of the bar, telling Anna to come back inside.\n\nAs Father Giacomo takes Anna out of harm's way, the man yells that she has not been cleansed and demands he bring her back. Angelo springs into action and quickly takes the men out, then returns to Anna and Father Giacomo.\n\nFearing its not safe, Angelo wants them out of there while he looks into what's going on. The Father decides to take her to an apartment owned by one of his parishioners who is out of town, where she'll be safe. Father Giacomo leaves with Anna and tells Angelo to meet them when he is done here.\n\nAngelo enters Sammy's B"
