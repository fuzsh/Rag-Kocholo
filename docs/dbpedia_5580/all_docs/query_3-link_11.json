        "text": "By Samantha Rutt\n\nA hit-and-run incident in Patchogue March 2023, which claimed the life of 25-year-old Nicholas Puzio, has spurred local leaders into action. Puzio, a resident of Farmingville, was tragically struck by two separate vehicles while crossing Route 112. Both drivers fled the scene, leaving him to die.\n\nHit-and-run collisions are those in which at least one person involved in a crash flees the scene before offering any, or sufficient, information or aid to the other involved person or fails to properly report the crash. Hit-and-run violations – which are criminal offenses – can create additional burdens for law enforcement and for families looking for remediation as well as medical and insurance support.\n\nAlthough Long Island roads are among the deadliest, few drivers involved in crashes that kill pedestrians or cyclists face criminal charges. That is, unless they are caught after fleeing the scene, or it can be proven they were drunk, under the influence of drugs or speeding.\n\nWalk Safe Long Island, a collaborative of health and transportation safety educators from Nassau and Suffolk counties, says over the past three years in Nassau and Suffolk counties, 515 people have been hit and injured while walking, jogging or biking.\n\nPedestrian safety continues to be a serious concern. The Institute for Traffic Safety Management & Research states that from 2016 to 2020, pedestrians accounted for almost one quarter of the fatalities on New York’s roadways.\n\nAccording to information from the National Center for Health Statistics, Long Island averages 18.2 roadway deaths per month. However, in the summer months this number trends upward as it nearly doubled, reaching 31 in August of last year.\n\nIn response, state Sen. Dean Murray (R-East Patchogue) and Assemblyman Doug Smith (R-Holbrook) introduced “Nick’s Law” in 2023. The proposed legislation aims to increase penalties for those convicted of leaving the scene of an incident involving a death. The move comes in the wake of a lenient six-month sentence handed down to one of the drivers involved in Puzio’s death, highlighting the inadequacies of current laws.\n\n“Two drivers made reckless choices and left my son dying in the street. Who does that? Does anyone have regard for human life? The laws in New York State are far too lenient,” Puzio’s mother, Terry Puzio, voiced her anguish and frustration in a statement.\n\nUnder current laws, individuals caught fleeing the scene of a fatal incident face a Class D felony and a fine of up to $5,000. “Nick’s Law” would elevate the crime to a Class B felony with a fine of $30,000. This increase in penalties is aimed at deterring drivers from fleeing the scene to avoid harsher consequences for other offenses such as driving under the influence.\n\nThe need for this legislation is represented by the alarming statistics. According to multiple sources, in 2023, Suffolk County alone witnessed 16 fatal hit-and-run incidents. This year, multiple similar incidents have already occurred, including the recent death of 22-year-old volunteer firefighter Christopher Hlavaty in East Patchogue.\n\nHlavaty’s mother, Janine Hlavaty, shared her desire for the bill’s passage in a statement, saying, “My hope for the passage of ‘Nick’s Law’ is that people will think twice before leaving the scene of these horrific, life-altering accidents.”\n\nThe push for “Nick’s Law” has garnered support from local lawmakers and officials who have emphasized the importance of holding hit-and-run drivers accountable.\n\n“When people can face lighter sentences if they are involved in an accident while drunk or on drugs by leaving an injured person in the road, there is a clear benefit to them to run and hide. That is unacceptable and it must be changed as soon as possible,” state Sen. Mario Mattera (R-St. James) said in a statement.\n\nThe community’s outcry and the introduction of “Nick’s Law” showcases a collective demand for justice and safety on the roads. For now, the community awaits legislative action, hoping that “Nick’s Law” will bring about the change to deter future hit-and-run tragedies and provide justice for those who have lost their lives on the roads of Long Island.\n\nBy Serena Carpino\n\nHayduk Engineering recently celebrated the opening of its new office near MacArthur Airport.\n\n“The firm’s move became necessary because of the growth of the firm over the past 10 years. The addition of dozens of new employees resulted in the need for an expanded office space, leading to relocation from the former office space,” Hayduk’s director of business development, Peter Scully, said. He is a former NYSDEC regional director and Suffolk County deputy county executive.\n\nStephen G. Hayduk, who founded the company in 1984, began as a one-man operation from his house. Over the past 40 years, his firm has grown to 42 employees in what can be described as a “rags to riches” story.\n\nAfter dropping out of Deer Park High School, Hayduk worked as a truck driver on Long Island before enlisting in the U.S. Army Aviation School at 18 years old. He spent three years serving in the Vietnam War as a member of the U.S. Army 57th Assault Helicopter Company.\n\nAccording to Hayduk, Vietnam motivated him to improve himself. “I was a good student but I was interested in other things, not college. Vietnam helped me with my maturity and to put things back into perspective. When I came back, I used the GI Bill to go to college. So, even if it was in many ways a negative experience, I turned it into a positive one,” he said.\n\nHayduk returned to Long Island in 1971 and soon enrolled in Suffolk County Community College, earning his associate degree in 1974. He furthered his education at Rochester Institute of Technology, graduating in 1976 with high honors and obtaining a bachelor’s degree.\n\nOver the next several years, Hayduk gained experience at local engineering firms, even becoming the chief engineer of a 75-employee firm. At the same time, he taught courses in the engineering technology division at SCCC.\n\nIn 1984, he founded Hayduk Engineering. That same year, he earned the Young Engineer of the Year award from the New York State Society of Professional Engineers and the Suffolk County Chapter of the NYSSPE.\n\nThe NYSSPE Suffolk County Chapter awarded him the 1990-91 Engineer of the Year. In 1991, Hayduk helped with the construction of the Suffolk County Vietnam Veterans Memorial, located atop Bald Hill. He described this experience as “a very emotional time with thousands of people there.” It inspired him to have a reunion and, two years later, Hayduk met with 75 members of his unit and a Green Beret in Florida.\n\nIn 1992, Suffolk County Executive Robert Gaffney (R) appointed Hayduk as the commissioner of the county’s Department of Public Works. Hayduk served in this position for five years, during which time he shut down his own firm.\n\nAs commissioner, Hayduk held many responsibilities, including the maintenance of county buildings, highways, bridges and waterways. In addition, he oversaw hazardous and toxic waste removal, county fleet maintenance and other related tasks. He also served as the chairman of the Suffolk County Sewer Agency, Dredging Project Screening Committee and the Space Management Steering Committee.\n\nIn 1997, Hayduk decided to return to operating Hayduk Engineering. He managed the firm as a sole proprietorship before turning it into an LLC in 2002.\n\nYears later, in 2015, Hayduk Engineering was certified by New York State as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business.\n\n“Hayduk Engineering’s status as both a New York State Certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business and federally Certified Service-Disabled Veterans Business Enterprise has contributed significantly to the growth of the firm since 2016,” Scully said.\n\nToday, the firm is run by Hayduk and his son, Stephen. They provide many services, including civil and site engineering, highway engineering, water and wastewater engineering, stormwater management and construction administration. The firm’s clients include both private sector customers, including developers and owners of private sewer plants and government agencies, including the Nassau County and Suffolk County departments of public works, the towns of Babylon, Brookhaven, Smithtown and Southampton, the New York State Thruway Authority, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, New York State Department of Transportation, the Long Island Rail Road, Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the State University of New York, among others.\n\nHayduk’s work has been recognized with numerous awards, including several for the Town of Smithtown Callahan’s Beach project and for Best Engineering Firm courtesy of Long Island Business News.\n\n“The company is continually recruiting new staff and anticipates hiring additional employees in the months and years ahead,” Scully said.\n\nBy Ava Himmelsbach\n\nAmong growing anticipation to hear the plans and propositions of the United States presidential candidates, the long-awaited first presidential debate for the 2024 election is scheduled to take place this Thursday, June 27.\n\nWith this political face-off right around the corner, TBR had a question for locals: “What topics would you like to see addressed in Thursday’s presidential debate?”\n\nPhotos by Ava Himmelsbach\n\nMuriel and Patricia, Smithtown\n\nMuriel and Patricia are interested to see how the candidates will address various relevant topics. “Well, number one is immigration,” Patricia mentioned. “Climate control is important,” Muriel later brought up.\n\nAdditionally, Muriel and Patricia shared that they would like to hear about the economy in the presidential debate. They are curious to hear how the candidates will speak about topics such as the housing market, Wall Street and student loans.\n\nBarbara Thompson and Kevin Thompson, Islip\n\nBarbara Thompson and Kevin Thompson, Former Islip residents now residing in Florida. They hope to hear conversations free of banter and full of respect in the upcoming debate. “There should always be things on the docket regarding our educational systems and our welfare systems, of course,” Kevin noted. “And the subject of firearms, it’s all a very debatable thing, but no one seems to be making any decisions regarding it. They all seem to be fighting over it.” Barbara added that she and Kevin now reside close to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a place devastated by a mass shooting in 2018. This tragedy has contributed to their attention to the topic of firearm ownership.\n\nAmong these concerns and curiosities involving the topic of firearms, Barbara and Kevin also stated that they hope Thursday’s debate includes topics of social security for the future, welfare for the elderly and aid for immigration.\n\nNancy and Paul\n\nNancy and Paul highlighted their interest in topics related to immigration and the economy, as well as oil and its sources. They are both curious to see how the subject of the economy will be addressed in the debate. Paul specified that he is interested to hear more about economic changes that may arise under the elected candidate.\n\nNancy and Paul declined for their picture to be taken or other personal information to be included.\n\nMike and Kristen, Port Jefferson\n\nMike emphasized “dealing with foreign affairs” as the primary topic that he hopes is discussed in the debate. He mentioned the need for attention toward the country’s global relations, noting his interest in “strengthening our relationships overseas” and “eliminating the possibilities of going to war.”\n\n“Mental health concerns for everyone should be covered,” added Kristen. They both agreed that access to health care, including care for mental health, should be addressed.\n\nIn recent months, our community has witnessed a surge in hit-and-run incidents, leaving families heartbroken and raising serious concerns about road safety. The tragic incident in March 2023, when 25-year-old Nicholas Puzio of Farmingville was struck and left to die by two separate vehicles, and the hit-and-run incident that recently killed 22-year-old firefighter Christopher Hlavaty of East Patchogue underscore the need for action. This rise in hit-and-runs not only devastates families but also places a heavy burden on law enforcement and emergency services.\n\nHit-and-run incidents, defined as collisions where drivers flee the scene without providing aid or information, are a growing menace. Current penalties for these offenses, such as a Class D felony and a fine of up to $5,000, are insufficient deterrents. In response, elected officials have introduced “Nick’s Law,” which proposes to elevate the crime to a Class B felony with a fine of $30,000. This legislation aims to ensure that those who commit these acts face more appropriate consequences.\n\nOne significant factor contributing to the increase in hit-and-run incidents is distracted driving. Drivers today face numerous distractions that can divert their attention from the road, including texting, making phone calls and using apps as well as many other potential factors such as interacting with infotainment systems, consuming food or beverages, engaging in conversations or attending to children or pets; billboards, roadside activities and other incidents can divert a driver’s attention.\n\nWhile legislative action such as “Nick’s Law” is crucial, it is equally important for pedestrians to take proactive steps to ensure their safety. Here are some measures pedestrians can adopt:\n\n● Wear bright or reflective clothing, especially at night or in low-light conditions.\n\n● Always cross at designated crosswalks and obey pedestrian signals.\n\n● Avoid using headphones or mobile devices while walking near traffic.\n\n● Ensure drivers see you before you cross the street.\n\n● Where there are no sidewalks, walk on the side of the road facing oncoming traffic.\n\n● Just like drivers, pedestrians should avoid walking near roadways while impaired.\n\nAs a community, we must work together to address the dangers of distracted driving and the rise in hit-and-run incidents. Drivers need to minimize distractions, stay vigilant and prioritize safety. Pedestrians must take precautions to protect themselves and remain aware of their surroundings.\n\nThe push for “Nick’s Law” is a reflection of the collective demand for justice and safer roads. However, it will take a concerted effort from both drivers and pedestrians to make our roads safer for everyone. As we honor the memories of those we have lost, such as Puzio and Hlavaty, we must commit to safer practices on our roads and support legislation that holds reckless drivers accountable.\n\nTogether, we can combat the rise in hit-and-run incidents, ensure justice for victims and create a safer community.\n\nPutting the record straight\n\nIn response to Drew Biondo’s “A letter correction” in last week’s Letters to the Editor, I wholeheartedly stand by my declaration that “all elected trustees attended and sat at the dais,” regarding the town hall meeting about the East Beach bluff.\n\nFor the record, Drew Biondo was not elected. He was appointed. So yes, all elected trustees attended and sat at the dais.\n\nKathianne Snaden\n\nFormer Port Jeff Deputy Mayor\n\nPort Jefferson\n\nProm season is upon us\n\nProm season is upon us and there is probably no greater community tradition than the Port Jefferson Senior Prom. Since 1958, the senior prom has been a highly anticipated community event in our village. Valued partnerships with the school district, Village Hall, code enforcement and local businesses allow the Prom Committee to create a one-of-kind event not only for the senior class, but for the entire community.\n\nWe’ve been fortunate to have the extraordinary commitment of parents and community volunteers — some of whom have been volunteering with the prom for decades — to support us all along the way. Now, after a busy year of fundraising, creating, painting and constructing, we ae ready to build the prom!\n\nWe begin Prom Build on Thursday, June 27, at 9 a.m. and will continue through Prom Night on Monday, July 1. We encourage community members to come lend a hand and take part in the transformation of the high school gym into an awe-inspiring venue, complete with custom designed vignettes, props and theatrical lighting. On July 1, we proudly show our creation to the public from 4-6 p.m., with the Drive-Up Procession and Red Carpet entrance following afterward.\n\nIf you have never experienced the excitement of the Prom Build, we invite you to join in the amazing transformation of the high school. If you have volunteered at the prom before, we hope to see you and your friends again this year. The senior prom truly embodies the spirit of volunteerism and community, with volunteers of all ages and backgrounds working together to carry on the beloved tradition that is the Port Jefferson Senior Prom.\n\nPaul Braile\n\nPresident, Port Jefferson\n\nSenior Prom\n\nMay day\n\nRussian nuclear missiles from Cuba have targeted the very heart and soul of America and shall be more destructive than Pearl Harbor.\n\n“Lord, what fools these mortals be” (Shakespeare). God bless America\n\nLeonard Henderson\n\nPort Jefferson\n\n1 of 8\n\nMore than 250 students from 65 Suffolk County schools entered science projects in the 2024 Elementary School Science Fair hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory on June 8.\n\nStudents used the scientific method to explore all kinds of questions about their favorite things and the world around them. The annual fair organized by Brookhaven Lab’s Office of Educational Programs celebrated and showcased all projects submitted, ranging from finding the best detangler for Barbie dolls’ hair to using a hand-crafted wind tunnel to test wing shapes for the best lift.\n\n“Our judges enjoyed reading through the projects and were impressed with questions, ideas, and designs,” Amanda Horn, a Brookhaven Lab administrator who coordinated the science fair, said before announcing the winning projects. “We certainly have some future scientists and engineers here today.”\n\nLocal teachers and Lab staff volunteered as judges to pick the top spots and honorable mentions for each grade level, from kindergarten to sixth grade. The competition also included a Judges’ Choice award for creative questions.\n\nStudents who earned first place in their grade level received medals and ribbons, along with banners to hang at their school to recognize the achievement. All participants received a ribbon in recognition of having won their grade level competition at their school.\n\nScience Fair awards\n\nThe following students earned first place in their grade level:\n\n◆ Kindergartener Eden Campbell, Ocean Avenue Elementary School in Northport for “Tasting Color.” Eden’s project explored whether the color of food affects its taste. What was her favorite part of the experiment? “Eating the jellybeans,” she said.\n\n◆ First grader Milan Patel, Ocean Avenue Elementary School in Northport for “How Does the Direction of a House Affect the Amount of Heat Absorbed from the Sun?”\n\n◆ Second grader Advika Arun, Bretton Woods Elementary School in Hauppauge, for “Slower and Steadier the Safer it Will Be.” For her experiment, Advika crafted small parachutes to test which materials fostered a slow and safe landing. She found that nylon worked the best. “I liked the part where we dropped them and we saw the speed they went,” she said. She added of her first-place win, “I’m really excited!”\n\n◆ Third grader Isla Cone, Love of Learning Montessori School in Centerport, for “The Impact of pH on Boba.” Isla tested food-friendly liquids with different pH levels to find out which could form boba, the round and chewy pearls found in bubble tea. She confirmed that boba spheres occurred in liquids with a pH between 4 and 10. “I wanted to do a project that was related to food,” she said. “My favorite part was getting to eat all the stuff!”\n\n◆ Fourth grader Jude Roseto, Cutchogue East Elementary School in Cutchogue, for “Rise of the Machines: AI vs. Human Creativity Writing.”\n\n◆ Fifth grader Luke Dinsman, Northport Middle School in Northport, for “Maximizing Moisture — Nature Knows Best.” In his project, Dinsman found that homemade, natural moisturizers worked better than store-bought lotions at treating the dry skin he experiences as a swimmer. A shea body butter with beeswax turned out to be the best option. Making the lotions and testing them was the best part of the process, Luke said. He added, “It’s just a really cool project.”\n\n◆ Sixth grader Owen Stone, East Quogue Elementary in East Quogue for “Can Common Foods Help Grow Potatoes?”\n\nJudges’ choice\n\nKindergarten: John Jantzen, Sunrise Drive Elementary School in Sayville\n\nFirst Grade: Julianna Zick, West Middle Island Elementary School in Middle Island\n\nSecond Grade: Timothy Donoghue, Riley Avenue Elementary School in Calverton\n\nThird Grade: Charlotte Sheahan, Pulaski Road School in East Northport\n\nFourth Grade: Dominick Padolecchia, Sunrise Drive Elementary School in Sayville\n\nFifth Grade: Isabella Maharlouei, Raynor Country Day School in Speonk\n\nSixth Grade: Zoe Wood, Northport Middle School in Northport\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nKindergarten: Michael McCarthy, Pines Elementary School in Smithtown; Scarlett Luna, Hampton Bays Elementary School in Hampton Bays; Autumn Vlacci, Riley Avenue Elementary School in Calverton\n\nFirst Grade: Tyler Paino, Bretton Woods Elementary School in Hauppauge; Logan Pierre, Brookhaven Elementary School in Brookhaven; Nora Boecherer, Edna Louise Spear Elementary School in Port Jefferson\n\nSecond Grade: Charlotte Tholl, Forest Brook Elementary School; Gabi Opisso, Cutchogue East Elementary School in Cutchogue; Matthew Ingram, Ocean Avenue Elementary School in Northport; Erios Pikramenos, Frank J.

Students peered through microscopes, learned how fuel cells and solar panels work, became junior beamline operators, and more.\n\nBy Daniel Dunaief\n\nThe montage played in my mind even before I stepped out of the car at the Old Field Club last weekend. My father and older brother were pedaling ahead of me, too fast for my thick, stocky legs to keep pace. My younger brother and mother were behind me, too slow for my taste and my level of impatience.\n\n“Pe-dal fa-ster,” I recalled grimacing through crooked, gritted teeth, hoping that I could hear whatever magic words my father and older brother were exchanging.\n\nPushing on a bicycle that didn’t have any gears and struggling against a wind that always seemed to be blowing in my face, I only caught up to them when they circled back. Determined as I was not to cut corners or shorten my ride, I reached the end of West Meadow Beach, stopped for a few seconds to rest my legs and restarted the pursuit.\n\nI could also picture the numerous times I stood on the shore, searching for the perfect skimming rock, bringing a collection to the water’s edge and waiting my turn to try to send a rock far from shore.\n\nMore dramatic weather scenes also played in my head, as I pictured waves frozen in place by a prolonged stretch of cold weather. I’m sure I love winter beaches because of those moments when I felt like I owned the isolated sand sculpted by the same powerful wind whose fingers tried to reach through any holes in my coat or open air spaces to stab at exposed skin.\n\nAfter heavy rainstorms, I recalled stopping on my ten-speed bike, staring at the flooded road that turned the road into a canal.\n\nAnd then there was last Saturday, as I drove up to the entrance to the club, waiting for a valet to park my car and to celebrate the wedding of the son of a close friend and former coworker of my wife.\n\nWe entered the club, took our glass of champagne and made our way to the benches outside, where other people my wife knew greeted her and compared notes about the changes in their lives since they last saw each other.\n\nWhile overlooking the water, we listened as my wife’s friend’s son, whom I recall seeing years earlier eating ice cream and “making memories,” exchanged vows each of them wrote to mark this incredible occasion. My wife’s friend’s son expressed his eagerness to start his own family.\n\nI watched carefully as my wife’s friend had a perma-grin plastered on her ageless face, reveling in this couple that seemed to melt into each other’s arms for their first dance. The family I didn’t know at all also seemed pleased, albeit in a more buttoned down and restrained way, as they clapped for the happy couple.\n\nThen, of course, the music, which served as a starter’s gun for my wife and me at these events, began, sending us vaulting out of our seats and onto the dance floor.\n\nLife was so different for me now, as an appreciative guest for this loving event, but also for the world. People took out their cell phones to take pictures of this endless love, they exchanged cell phone numbers, and smiled at a camera atop a giant mirror on the dance floor that developed a sequence of photos.\n\nSeveral grandparents enjoyed the celebration, beaming with pride at their children and grandchildren.\n\nThey likely had even more memories flooding through their mind than I, as they could recall the birth of their own children and grandchildren, with yet another magical turn of the time wheel to the next generation.\n\nWhen these grandparents were considerably younger, they couldn’t have attended such a wedding, as the loving couple are both men.\n\nHere they were, supporting their grandson, who floated across the room with his husband and expressed his keen appreciation for the guests who came to celebrate this momentous day.\n\nI wonder what ways the world might change between now and when we, if we’re fortunate enough, get to celebrate a similar event for future generations.\n\nFor me, that night was yet another memory on a familiar road that has served as the backdrop for my life’s journey. Even as I replay the celebration, I can hear the words of several ABBA songs, like “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme” and “Lay all your love on me.”\n\nBy Leah S. Dunaief\n\nSpeaking of our health, which we often do with friends, there were a couple of interesting bits of news this week in that department.\n\nProbably the most dramatic is the idea that by delaying the onset of menopause, a woman’s life and good health might be extended. The health benefits that women have before menopause lessen as we age past that mark. So current longevity research is asking if the whole picture could be slowed. And so, Dr. Jill Biden announced from the White House a new health initiative to pursue this concept, with Dr. Renee Wegrzyn steering the research.\n\nOvaries, which seem to play a role throughout a woman’s lifetime, not just until menopause, are the main focus. “Researchers think that prolonging their function, better aligning the length of their viability with that of other organs, could potentially alter the course of a woman’s health—and longevity research overall,” according to Tuesday’s front page story in The New York Times.\n\nUsing hormones like estrogen and progesterone, ovaries communicate with every other organ in the body. When they stop communicating, “all kinds of problems arise.” They stop when the eggs that they carry are gone, at which point risk increases for dementia, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and other age-related diseases and lifespan, according to The Times. Women whose ovaries have been prematurely removed for other health reasons are at greater risk, which suggests that even after all the eggs are gone, ovaries may still play a protective role.\n\nAll of this is subject to much further investigation. Researchers are not sure whether aging negatively affects the ovaries or if the ovaries cause other organs to age. But prolonging ovarian function in lab animals does seem to improve their health and longevity. This encourages further research into reducing the number of eggs lost by a woman during each menstrual cycle, thus preserving ovarian function. (Women shed may eggs many cycle but one ovulates). A current drug, rapamycin, which is an immunosuppressant used in organ transplants, is being studied for that role.\n\nAnti-aging research is highly popular among scientists these days.\n\nAnother surprising article in the same issue of The Times, this one in the ScienceTimes section, has to do with our sense of smell. Though it lessens with age (and might as the result of infections, like Covid), “A diminished ability to smell is associated with worsening memory, cognition and overall well-being—as well as dementia and depression.” The good news is that such a situation may be reversible.\n\nWe can train our noses with smelling exercises, and our ability to smell, in turn, may improve not only depression but also help remember words faster. One explanation for this is “the areas of the brain involved in smelling are uniquely connected to parts involved in cognition, such as the prefrontal cortex.” Further to the point, “The olfactory system is the only sensory system that has a direct superhighway projection into the memory centers and the emotional centers of your brain,” according to Professor Michael Leon of the University of California, Irvine.\n\nSo take out products from your kitchen cabinets and alternately smell cinnamon, honey, coffee, wine or others and sniff each of them at least 30 seconds at a time, once in the morning and once more at night. Small studies have indicated this not only tests one’s power to smell but also enhance cognitive abilities.\n\nFinally for this column, I would like to quote the Times’ article on the Walking Cure for Lower Back Pain. Although those with pain may be loathe to exercise, movement can strengthen muscles that support the back and ease the pain. This is a conclusion that is supported with any number of studies over the past few years.\n\n“Researchers found that regular exercise combined with physical education was the most effective way to prevent lower back pain from recurring,” according to The NYT.\n\nWalking can help strengthen the support muscles at the base of the spine. When they weaken, it can lead to pain.\n\nSo, as the song goes, “Shake, Shake, Shake Your Booty,” for good health."
