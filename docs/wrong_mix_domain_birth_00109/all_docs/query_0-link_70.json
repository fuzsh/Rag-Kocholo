        "text": "Hi everyone, here are our five musical recommendations of the week!\n\nThis week our five music recommendation are:\n\n1. Every 100 Years: The Woody Guthrie Songbook by Woody Guthrie (Format: Print Book):\n\n2012 would have been the 100th birthday of American singer/songwriter Woody Guthrie. To mark his extraordinary achievements in songwriting, we are releasing this souvenir centennial songbook. Woody Guthrie wrote over 3,000 songs in his lifetime, yet only 300 or so were ever recorded. At the invitation of Guthrie’s daughter, Nora Guthrie, contemporary singer/songwriters have set music to Guthrie’s previously unpublished lyrics. Musicians such as Billy Bragg, Wilco, Dropkick Murphys, Jonatha Brooke, Jay Farrar, Tom Morello, Lou Reed, The Klezmatics, Hans-Eckardt Wenzel, Madeleine Peyroux, Janis Ian, Sarah Lee Guthrie & Johnny Irion, and Woody’s son, Arlo Guthrie, have shown us how timeless Woody’s words are. Every 100 Years is a compilation of 100 Woody Guthrie songs that run the gamut from work songs, love songs and union & protest songs, to topical songs and children’s songs. The book features his classics such as: This Land Is Your Land * Jesus Christ * Do Re Mi * Pretty Boy Floyd * Roll On Columbia * Pastures of Plenty * Deportee * Riding in My Car * and more, as well as hits from the next generation of Guthrie co-authors: California Stars * I’m Shippin’ Up to Boston * The Jolly Banker * Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key * Hoodoo Voodoo * Ease My Revolutionary Mind * Ingrid Bergman * My Peace * Mermaid’s Avenue * Happy Joyous Hanukkah * Every 100 Years * and many others.

Songs of Work And Protest: 100 Favorite Songs of American Works Complete With Music And Historical Notes by Edith Fowke & Joe Glazer (Format: Print Book):\n\nNo other form could capture the history of the labor movement better than the songs sung in times both bitter and courageous by coal miners and textile workers, railroad men and steelworkers, farmers, seamen, and cow-hands as they worked to supply the nation’s needs and as they worked to defeat political and industrial tyranny, child labor, hunger, poverty, and unemployment. This collection includes a hundred songs of the people, as they have been sung at one time or another on the workers’ long road toward freedom and justice, together with the stories of the genuine situations from which they sprang.\n\nThey are straight trade union songs and ditties; specific songs of miners, textile workers, steel, and railway workers and farmers; typical working songs of sailors, canalers, lumberjacks, and cowboys; songs of the hardships that working men and women have to face during times of depression; philosophic songs and ironic comments on the economic system; songs that grew out of the fight against slavery; and songs expressing the dreams of people of many lands throughout the ages. Often set to tunes of familiar folk songs, popular songs, and gospel hymns, these are the songs by which unions organized and which the members of each labor group sang out. They are songs sung to words by itinerant wanderers, unlettered farmers, and factory hands; songs by Joe Hill, Ralph Chaplin, Joe Glazer, Merle Traive, Woody Guthrie, the Almanac Singers; songs by famous poets such as Burns and Blake. Most of the songs are American in origin. A few, drawn from England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Israel, and the Philippines, remind us that the fight for freedom knows no boundaries. The songs are presented with simple piano accompaniments and guitar chords to encourage their use in group singing.\n\nThis collection includes 100 songs from the history of the labor movement, together with the stories of the genuine situations from which they sprang. Includes songs by Joe Hill, Ralph Chaplin, Joe Glazer, Merle Travis, Woody Guthrie, the Almanac Singers, and others from around the globe. “Union Maid,” “Joe Hill,” “We Shall Not Be Moved,” and many more.\n\nThe songs of work and the songs of protest are, in a very important sense, the songs of the New World, capturing the stirring sounds and deep emotions of people over hundreds of years on the march to build a better world. Whether you are looking for material for singing or whether you are looking for material on the struggles of the labor movement, there will be much in this important collection for song and for thought.\n\n–\n\n3. Songs of the Suffragettes sung by Elizabeth McKnight (Format: Music CD):\n\nOriginal Album Description: It is hard to believe in modern times that the issue of women’s suffrage once wracked the nation. Riots, demonstrations, and indignant editorials highlight the history of this long battle that finally ended in 1920 with the 19th Amendment. Liner notes by Irwin Silber include a brief history of the suffrage movement, lyrics and background on the 16 tracks, and black-and-white political cartoons.\n\nSong List:\n\nColumbia’s Daughters\n\nUncle Sam’s Wedding\n\nKeep Woman in Her Sphere\n\nLet Us All Speak Our Minds\n\nThe Taxation Tyranny\n\nThe Promised Land\n\nThe Suffrage Flag\n\nWinning The Vote\n\nGive the Ballot to the Mothers\n\nSong of Wyoming\n\nGoing to the Polls\n\nWhere Are Your Boys Today!\n\nThe Yellow Ribbon\n\nHallelujah Song\n\nOh, Dear, What Can the Matter Be!\n\nThe New America\n\n–\n\n4. A Treasury of Library of Congress Field Recordings by Various Artists (Format: Music CD):\n\nThirty Library of Congress field recordings from 1933 to 1946, compiled and thoroughly annotated by Stephen Wade. There are many Library of Congress collections, but the diversity of performances on this disc might make one of the better selections for someone who’s interested enough in folkloric recordings to have just a few, as opposed to an academic who wants to hear as much as possible. There’s Appalachian folk music, African-American spirituals, nursery rhymes by black Mississippi children, rural Southern blues, and even an a cappella ballad by a Harvard-educated judge. There are a couple of well-known performers as well: Woody Guthrie does “The Gypsy Davy,” and Sonny Terry has a trademark puffing harmonica workout on “Lost John.” But largely these are folks who performed mostly for their neighbors or houses of worship. It’s not the point of a collection such as this to illustrate how this music influenced pop, but there are some real interesting renditions of songs that later became famous in other hands: “Blood-Strained Banders” (done here by Jimmie Strothers) was adapted into “Good Shepherd” by the Jefferson Airplane; “Sea Lion Woman” (Christine and Katherine Shipp) was done by Nina Simone, and “Another Man Done Gone” (Vera Hall) was covered by John Mayall. There’s also the first recorded performance of “Rock Island Line” (by inmates at an Arkansas penitentiary in 1934), which became a folk music standard and eventually started the skiffle craze in England.

Putumayo Presents Women’s Work by Various Artists (Format: Music CD):\n\nIn 1996 the interest in singer-songwriters was cresting and women were a big part of the emerging trend. The songs they wrote were not about fanciful dream images; they came from real life and were insightful, bitter, funny, and often painfully intimate. While a vanguard of younger artists were just finding their way, established performers were also being rediscovered, and the two groups gave each other considerable inspiration and support. These 13 songs are an amazingly accurate time capsule of a period when the vogue finally shifted to include singers who used small forces to sort out big problems and overwhelming emotions. Romances go sour, philosophy brings cold comfort, and reality is sometimes too much to stomach, but the women keep going as best they can despite craziness, opposition on various fronts, and their own frailty. With Ani DiFranco, Janis Ian, Vonda Shepard, and Toni Childs. –Christina Roden, Amazon Review\n\nSong List:\n\n1. Cradle And All – Ani DiFranco\n\n2. The Wolf – Catie Curtis\n\n3. When The Silence Falls – Janis Ian\n\n4. Maryland – Vonda Shepard\n\n5. Just Enough – Toshi Reagon\n\n6. Notion – Barbara Kessler\n\n7. Letting Go – Fiona Joyce\n\n8.

Sally Field won an Oscar for her portrayal of the title character.\n\nFilm Synopsis by Hal Erickson, AllMovie: Norma Rae finds Sally Field cast in the title role, a minimum-wage worker in a cotton mill. The factory has taken too much of a toll on the health of Norma Rae’s family for her to ignore her Dickensian working conditions. After hearing a speech by New York union organizer Reuben (Ron Leibman), Norma Rae decides to join the effort to unionize her shop. This causes dissension at home when Norma Rae’s husband, Sonny (Beau Bridges), assumes that her activism is a result of a romance between herself and Reuben. Despite the pressure brought to bear by management, Norma Rae successfully orchestrates a shutdown of the mill, resulting in victory for the union and capitulation to its demands. Based on a true story, Norma Rae is the film for which Sally Field won her first Oscar; an additional Oscar went to David Shire and Norman Gimbel for the film’s theme song, “It Goes Like It Goes.”\n\n–\n\nVideos of the Week:\n\n9 to 5 by Dolly Parton\n\n–\n\nBread And Roses by Judy Collins\n\n–\n\nBusted by Ray Charles & Johnny Cash\n\n–\n\nColumbia’s Daughters by Elizabeth McKnight\n\n–\n\nHard Working Man by Brooks & Dunn\n\n–\n\nI’m Working On A Building by The Carter Family\n\n–\n\nJoe Hill by Joan Baez\n\n–\n\nNorma Rae Title Sequence\n\n–\n\nOld Doc Brown by Hank Snow\n\n–\n\nSolidarity Forever by Pete Seeger\n\n–\n\nThere Is Power In A Union by Billy Bragg\n\n–\n\nT.R.O.U.B.L.E. by Elvis\n\n–\n\nUnion Burying Ground by Woody Guthrie\n\n–\n\nWhich Side Are You On by Pete Seeger\n\n–\n\nWorking At The Car Wash Blues by Jim Croce\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nLinda Reimer, SSCL\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nPrint References\n\nThe Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitburn\n\nOnline References\n\nAllMusic: https://www.allmusic.com/\n\n–\n\nOnline Catalog Links:\n\nStarCat\n\nThe catalog of physical materials, i.e. print books, DVDs, audiobooks on CD, etc.\n\nThe Digital Catalog (OverDrive)\n\nThe catalog of e-books, downloadable audiobooks and a handful of streaming videos.\n\nABOUT LIBRARY APPS: OverDrive & RBDigital:\n\nYou can access digital library content on PCs, Macs and mobile devices.

Reading her work is like suddenly being able to see the matrix.” —Jonny Sun, author of everyone’s a aliebn when ur a aliebn too\n\nBecause Internet is for anyone who’s ever puzzled over how to punctuate a text message or wondered where memes come from. It’s the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the English language, why that’s a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal about who we are.\n\nLanguage is humanity’s most spectacular open-source project, and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and jargon with dizzying speed. What’s more, social media is a vast laboratory of unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time.\n\nEven the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it. Internet linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet experience influences whether you prefer “LOL” or “lol,” why ~sparkly tildes~ succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread.\n\n–\n\nDragons of Autumn Twilight by Margaret Weiss & Tracy Hickman (Format: eBook):\n\nLifelong friends, they went their separate ways. Now they are together again, though each holds secrets from the others in his heart. They speak of a world shadowed with rumors of war. They speak of tales of strange monsters, creatures of myth, creatures of legend. They do not speak of their secrets. Not then. Not until a chance encounter with a beautiful, sorrowful woman, who bears a magical crystal staff, draws the companions deeper into the shadows, forever changing their lives and shaping the fate of the world.\n\nNo one expected them to be heroes.\n\nLeast of all, them.\n\n–\n\nMoon of the Crusted Snow: A Novel written by Waubgeshig Rice and read by Billy Merasty (Format: Downloadable Audiobook):\n\nA daring post-apocalyptic novel from a powerful rising literary voice\n\nWith winter looming, a small northern Anishinaabe community goes dark. Cut off, people become passive and confused. Panic builds as the food supply dwindles. While the band council and a pocket of community members struggle to maintain order, an unexpected visitor arrives, escaping the crumbling society to the south. Soon after, others follow.\n\nThe community leadearship loses its grip on power as the visitors manipulate the tired and hungry to take control of the reserve. Tensions rise and, as the months pass, so does the death toll due to sickness and despair. Frustrated by the building chaos, a group of young friends and their families turn to the land and Anishinaabe tradition in hopes of helping their community thrive again. Guided through the chaos by an unlikely leader named Evan Whitesky, they endeavor to restore order while grappling with a grave decision.\n\nBlending action and allegory, Moon of the Crusted Snow upends our expectations. Out of catastrophe comes resilience. And as one society collapses, another is reborn.\n\n–\n\nNever Have I Ever: A Novel by Joshilyn Jackson (Format: eBook):\n\n“Wonderful—suspense and surprises, real characters, and a scary, ominous backbeat. This feels like the book Jackson was born to write.” —Lee Child, New York Times bestselling author\n\nNamed a Best Book by USA Today • People • Wall Street Journal • Time • Entertainment Weekly • Bustle • and many more!\n\nFrom New York Times bestselling author Joshilyn Jackson, a twisting novel of domestic suspense in which a group of women play a harmless drinking game that escalates into a war of dark pasts\n\nIn this game, even winning can be deadly…\n\nAmy Whey is proud of her ordinary life and the simple pleasures that come with it—teaching diving lessons, baking cookies for new neighbors, helping her best friend, Charlotte, run their local book club. Her greatest joy is her family: her devoted professor husband, her spirited fifteen-year-old stepdaughter, her adorable infant son. And, of course, the steadfast and supportive Charlotte. But Amy’s sweet, uncomplicated life begins to unravel when the mysterious and alluring Angelica Roux arrives on her doorstep one book club night.\n\nSultry and magnetic, Roux beguiles the group with her feral charm. She keeps the wine flowing and lures them into a game of spilling secrets. Everyone thinks it’s naughty, harmless fun. Only Amy knows better. Something wicked has come her way—a she-devil in a pricey red sports car who seems to know the terrible truth about who she is and what she once did.\n\nWhen they’re alone, Roux tells her that if she doesn’t give her what she asks for, what she deserves, she’s going to make Amy pay for her sins. One way or another.\n\nTo protect herself and her family and save the life she’s built, Amy must beat the devil at her own clever game, matching wits with Roux in an escalating war of hidden pasts and unearthed secrets. Amy knows the consequences if she can’t beat Roux. What terrifies her is everything she could lose if she wins.\n\nA diabolically entertaining tale of betrayal, deception, temptation, and love filled with dark twists leavened by Joshilyn Jackson’s trademark humor, Never Have I Ever explores what happens when the transgressions of our past come back with a vengeance.\n\n–\n\nSisters of Summer’s End by Lori Foster (Format: eBook):\n\nAs the summer ends, friendship begins…\n\nWhen single mom Joy Lee abandoned her old life to take a job at a lakeside resort, she found something that her family’s wealth and influence could never buy: peace of mind. Not easy to come by for the once-burned divorcée who keeps everyone at a distance. But when her new friend, Maris, dares her to take a chance with the drive-in’s charismatic new owner, everything changes for Joy and her young son.\n\nA difficult childhood has left Maris Kennedy with definite priorities. Her job running Summer’s End, the camp store and café, comes first. Always. Nothing could ever make her risk that hard-won security—especially not her free-spirited colleague. But the more she encourages Joy to open herself up to new experiences, the more Maris begins to wonder what she, too, might be missing.\n\nLearning how to trust will bring Joy and Maris together. And soon they form a friendship that leaves them as close as sisters—and open to love where they least expect it…in Summer’s End.\n\n–\n\nPRINT BOOK SUGGESTIONS:\n\nA Better Man: A Chief Inspector Gamache Novel by Louise Penny:\n\nCatastrophic spring flooding, blistering attacks in the media, and a mysterious disappearance greet Chief Inspector Armand Gamache as he returns to the Sûreté du Québec in the latest novel by #1 New York Times bestselling author Louise Penny.\n\nIt’s Gamache’s first day back as head of the homicide department, a job he temporarily shares with his previous second-in-command, Jean-Guy Beauvoir. Flood waters are rising across the province. In the middle of the turmoil a father approaches Gamache, pleading for help in finding his daughter.\n\nAs crisis piles upon crisis, Gamache tries to hold off the encroaching chaos, and realizes the search for Vivienne Godin should be abandoned. But with a daughter of his own, he finds himself developing a profound, and perhaps unwise, empathy for her distraught father.\n\nIncreasingly hounded by the question, how would you feel…, he resumes the search.\n\nAs the rivers rise, and the social media onslaught against Gamache becomes crueler, a body is discovered. And in the tumult, mistakes are made.\n\nIn the next novel in this “constantly surprising series that deepens and darkens as it evolves” (New York Times Book Review), Gamache must face a horrific possibility, and a burning question.\n\nWhat would you do if your child’s killer walked free?\n\n–\n\nContraband by Stuart Woods:\n\nStone Barrington is caught in the web of a national smuggling operation in the latest action-packed thriller from the #1 New York Times bestselling author.\n\nStone Barrington is getting some much-needed rest and relaxation in the Florida sun when trouble falls from the sky–literally.

But they run into a problem: the evidence keeps disappearing.\n\nFrom the laid-back Key West shores to the bustling Manhattan streets, Stone sets out to connect the dots between the crimes that seem to follow him wherever he travels. His investigations only lead to more questions, and shocking connections between old and new acquaintances. But as Stone must quickly learn, answers–and enemies–are often hiding in plain sight .\n\n–\n\nThe Last Good Guy by T. Jefferson Parker:\n\nIn this electrifying new thriller from three-time Edgar Award winner and New York Times bestseller T. Jefferson Parker, Private Investigator Roland Ford hunts for a missing teenager and uncovers a dark conspiracy in his most personal case yet.\n\nWhen hired by a beautiful and enigmatic woman to find her missing younger sister, private investigator Roland Ford immediately senses that the case is not what it seems. He is soon swept up in a web of lies and secrets as he searches for the teenager, and even his new client cannot be trusted. His investigation leads him to a secretive charter school, skinhead thugs, a cadre of American Nazis hidden in a desert compound, an arch-conservative celebrity evangelist–and, finally, to the girl herself. The Last Good Guy is Ford’s most challenging case to date, one that will leave him questioning everything he thought he knew about decency, honesty, and the battle between good and evil…if it doesn’t kill him first.\n\n–\n\nThe Oysterville Sewing Circle by Susan Wiggs:\n\n“Stitched together with love, this is a story just waiting for your favorite reading chair. With her signature style and skill, Susan Wiggs delivers an intricate patchwork of old wounds and new beginnings, romance and the healing power of friendship, wrapped in a lovely little community that’s hiding a few secrets of its own.”— Lisa Wingate, New York Times Bestselling author of Before We Were Yours\n\nThe #1 New York Times bestselling author brings us her most ambitious and provocative work yet—a searing and timely novel that explores the most volatile issue of our time—domestic violence.\n\nAt the break of dawn, Caroline Shelby rolls into Oysterville, Washington, a tiny hamlet at the edge of the raging Pacific.\n\nShe’s come home.\n\nHome to a place she thought she’d left forever, home of her heart and memories, but not her future. Ten years ago, Caroline launched a career in the glamorous fashion world of Manhattan. But her success in New York imploded on a wave of scandal and tragedy, forcing her to flee to the only safe place she knows.\n\nAnd in the backseat of Caroline’s car are two children who were orphaned in a single chilling moment—five-year-old Addie and six-year-old Flick. She’s now their legal guardian—a role she’s not sure she’s ready for.\n\nBut the Oysterville she left behind has changed. Her siblings have their own complicated lives and her aging parents are hoping to pass on their thriving seafood restaurant to the next generation. And there’s Will Jensen, a decorated Navy SEAL who’s also returned home after being wounded overseas. Will and Caroline were forever friends as children, with the promise of something more . . . until he fell in love with Sierra, Caroline’s best friend and the most beautiful girl in town. With her modeling jobs drying up, Sierra, too, is on the cusp of reinventing herself.\n\nCaroline returns to her favorite place: the sewing shop owned by Mrs. Lindy Bloom, the woman who inspired her and taught her to sew. There she discovers that even in an idyllic beach town, there are women living with the deepest of secrets. Thus begins the Oysterville Sewing Circle—where women can join forces to support each other through the troubles they keep hidden.\n\nYet just as Caroline regains her creativity and fighting spirit, and the children begin to heal from their loss, an unexpected challenge tests her courage and her heart. This time, though, Caroline is not going to run away. She’s going to stand and fight for everything—and everyone—she loves\n\n–\n\nTidelands by Philipa Gregory:\n\nThe #1 New York Times bestselling author and “one of the great storytellers of our time” (San Francisco Book Review) turns from the glamour of the royal courts to tell the story of an ordinary woman, Alinor, who cannot bear to conform to the life that lies before her.\n\nMidsummer’s Eve, 1648, England is in the grip of a civil war between renegade king and rebellious parliament. The struggle reaches every corner of the kingdom, even the remote tidelands —the marshy landscape of the south coast.\n\nAlinor, a descendant of wisewomen, trapped in poverty and superstition, waits in the graveyard under the full moon for a ghost who will declare her free from her abusive husband. Instead, she meets James, a young man on the run, and shows him the secret ways across the treacherous marsh, not knowing that she is leading disaster into the heart of her life.\n\nSuspected of possessing dark secrets in superstitious times, Alinor’s ambition and determination mark her out from her neighbors. This is the time of witch mania, and Alinor, a woman without a husband, skilled with herbs, suddenly enriched, arouses envy in her rivals and fear among the villagers, who are ready to take lethal action into their own hands.\n\nIt is dangerous for a woman to be different.\n\n–\n\nHave a great week!\n\nLinda Reimer, SSCL\n\nOnline Catalog Links:\n\nStarCat\n\nThe catalog of physical materials, i.e. print books, DVDs, audiobooks on CD, etc.\n\n–\n\nABOUT LIBRARY APPS:\n\nYou can access digital library content, i.e. eBooks & downloadable audiobooks, on PCs, Macs and mobile devices.\n\nFor mobile devices simply download the Libby app, for eBooks & downloadable audiobooks, or the RB Digital app, for on-demand magazines, from your app store to get started.

With that in mind, I’m going to mix up the format of the weekly music posting and suggest five library materials, a mix of books, music CDs and DVDs, that focus on music and musicians.\n\nAnd I will continue to include a weekly section of suggested videos as those seem to be quite popular!\n\nAlso of note, if you’d like to request a title, book, CD or DVD, be held for you at the library simply click on the photo of the item and you’ll be re-directed to online catalog, StarCat, where you can enter your library card and PIN to request desired item.\n\nThis week our five music recommendation are:\n\nDust & Grooves Adventures In Record Collection by Elion Paz (Format: Print Book):\n\nA photographic look into the world of vinyl record collectors—including Questlove—in the most intimate of environments—their record rooms.\n\nCompelling photographic essays from photographer Eilon Paz are paired with in-depth and insightful interviews to illustrate what motivates these collectors to keep digging for more records. The reader gets an up close and personal look at a variety of well-known vinyl champions, including Gilles Peterson and King Britt, as well as a glimpse into the collections of known and unknown DJs, producers, record dealers, and everyday enthusiasts. Driven by his love for vinyl records, Paz takes us on a five-year journey unearthing the very soul of the vinyl community. – From The Publisher\n\n–\n\nFolk Jazz Trio (2011) by David Grisman (Format: Music CD):\n\nDavid Grisman’s musical interests have been so varied that he is impossible to categorize stylistically, one of the reasons he has long described his playing everywhere as “Dawg Music.” This is a bit of an unusual outing, as it consists of a trio with bluegrass/folk guitarist/vocalist Jim Hurst, Grisman (mostly on mandolin), and his son Samson on bass. Hurst has previously covered Roger Rasnake’s “Cold Hard Business” and this version features his strong vocal and potent solos all around. The deliberate Latin-flavored “Vaya con Dios” was a hit for Les Paul & Mary Ford and also covered by Mel Tormé, Nat King Cole, and numerous vocalists, though the trio tackles it as an intimate instrumental. “Sally Ann” is a decades-old traditional favorite of bluegrass pickers; the trio’s interpretation seems effortless and Samson Grisman does a splendid job playing with the two veterans. Hurst and Grisman share the vocals in the traditional sorrowful country ballad “Mary of the Wild Moor,” while Samson take the lead vocal in a potent version of the late John Hartford’s “I Wish We Had Our Time Again.” Stephen Foster’s “Beautiful Dreamer” is one of his best-loved songs; Grisman’s shimmering mandolin lead stands out in this performance. The rest of the CD is equally strong, and the only shortcoming of the album is the omission of composer credits, as both musicians and fans may want to seek out earlier recordings of tunes unfamiliar to them for comparison. Highly recommended.

It is about a third larger than an album cover and somewhat weighty and it features more than 500 pages of beautiful photos of the Rolling Stones. The first half of the book shows the Stones in the sixties and the second half offers photos from 1978 to 2015. The sixties photos not only show the Stones but offer glimpses of that dramatic place in time that was the 1960s. As this is a heft book, weighing in at about 14 pounds – you might want to request it so you can pick it up at the Circulation Desk!\n\nHere is the official description of the book: The kind of fame and success The Rolling Stones have achieved in their 50-years and counting career is without parallel; their most famous riffs and catchiest lyrics are indelibly engraved in our collective memory. With their bluesy rock ‘n’ roll and mesmerizing off and onstage presence, the Stones redefined the music of the 1960s and 1970s and paved the way for rock as we know it today. They also set the standard for how a rock band should look and behave.

While she’s enjoyed a long and eclectic career that’s spanned six decades, to many Baez will always be the earnest, crystal-voiced activist she was in the early to mid-’60s, and much of her career since has been devoted to honoring what was good about her formative years without being chained to her past. Whistle Down the Wind, released in 2018 as Baez was beginning what she pledged would be her last major concert tour, is the work of an autumnal Joan Baez, but also one who hasn’t turned her back on her music or her principles. The glorious soprano notes of Baez’s glory days are clearly out of reach for her here, but her phrasing remains thoughtful and emotionally strong, and if her voice isn’t quite what it once was, it’s still lovely and full of authority. The mood of these ten songs (which include compositions by Tom Waits, Josh Ritter, Anohni, and Mary Chapin Carpenter) is generally downbeat and sometimes doleful, but Baez fills her performances with strength and commitment that are impressive in their quiet defiance. In songs like “The President Sang Amazing Grace” and “I Wish the Wars Were All Over,” Baez makes clear she’s still committed to a better world without attaching herself to polemics that will be dated in ten years. And the production by Joe Henry is superb, matching Baez’s vocals with subtle but simpatico accompaniment from a studio band that knows how to shine while making room for the protagonist. Whistle Down the Wind is a portrait of an artist who, at the age of 77, has not given up on her muse or her ideals, and while it’s subtle, it’s also a deeply moving piece of work that demands attention.

But each man holds his own secrets, in addition to the monumental mystery that none of them has ever stopped puzzling over since a Memorial Day weekend right here on the Vineyard in 1971.

Nora is biding her time with her youngest son, who is convinced that a mysterious beast is stalking the land around their home.\n\nMeanwhile, Lurie is a former outlaw and a man haunted by ghosts.

The stories and legends surrounding the decrepit property are countless and contradictory, but one thing is clear: there are people willing to pay a great deal to determine the legal ownership of the house. When Harlowe and her friends agree to investigate the mystery behind the manor, they do so on the assumption that they’ll be going down in history as the ones who determined who built Spindrift House – and why.\n\nThe house has secrets. They have the skills. They have a plan. They have everything they need to solve the mystery. Everything they need except for time. Because Spindrift House keeps its secrets for a reason, and it has no intention of letting them go. Nature abhors a straight line. Here’s where the story bends.\n\n—–\n\nRocket To The Morgue by Anthony Boucher:\n\nLegendary science fiction author Fowler Faulkes may be dead, but his creation, the iconic Dr. Derringer, lives on in popular culture.

So when he is stabbed nearly to death in a room with only one door, which nobody was seen entering or exiting, Foulkes suspects a writer. Fearing that the assailant will return, he asks for police protection, and when more potentially-fatal encounters follow, it becomes clear to Detective Terry Marshall and his assistant, the inquisitive nun, Sister Ursula, that death awaits Mr. Foulkes around every corner. Now, they’ll have to work overtime to thwart the would-be murderer―a task that requires a deep dive into the strange, idiosyncratic world of science fiction in its early days.\n\nWith characters based heavily on Anthony Boucher’s friends at the Manana Literary Society, including Robert Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, and Jack Parsons, Rocket to the Morgue is both a classic locked room mystery and an enduring portrait of a real-life writing community. Reprinted for the first time in over thirty years, the book is a must-read for fans of mysteries and science fiction alike.\n\n—–\n\nBook descriptions are provided by the publishers unless otherwise specified.\n\n—–\n\nHave a great week!\n\nLinda Reimer, SSCL\n\nOnline Catalog Links:\n\nStarCat\n\nThe catalog of physical materials, i.e. print books, DVDs, audiobooks on CD, etc.\n\n–\n\nABOUT LIBRARY APPS:\n\nYou can access digital library content, i.e. eBooks & downloadable audiobooks, on PCs, Macs and mobile devices.\n\nFor mobile devices simply download the Libby app, for eBooks & downloadable audiobooks, or the RB Digital app, for on-demand magazines, from your app store to get started.

It is above all a stinging indictment of the ill-fated war in Iraq and the heavy tolls it continues to exact on its people.”—Khaled Hosseini, author of The Kite Runner\n\nThe world is Rita Khoury’s oyster. The bright and driven daughter of a Boston-area Irish-Arab family that has risen over the generations from poor immigrants to part of the coastal elite, Rita grows up in a 1980s cultural mishmash. Corned beef and cabbage sit on the dinner table alongside stuffed grape leaves and tabooleh, all cooked by Rita’s mother, an Irish nurse who met her Lebanese surgeon husband while working at a hospital together. The unconventional yet close-knit family bonds over summers at the beach, wedding line-dances, and a shared obsession with the Red Sox.\n\nRita charts herself an ambitious path through Harvard to one of the best newspapers in the country. She is posted in cosmopolitan Beirut and dates a handsome Palestinian would-be activist. But when she is assigned to cover the America-led invasion of Baghdad in 2003, she finds herself unprepared for the warzone. Her lifeline is her interpreter and fixer Nabil al-Jumaili, an equally restless young man whose dreams have been restricted by life in a deteriorating dictatorship, not to mention his own seemingly impossible desires. As the war tears Iraq apart, personal betrayal and the horrors of conflict force Rita and Nabil out of the country and into twisting, uncertain fates. What lies in wait will upend their lives forever, shattering their own notions of what they’re entitled to in a grossly unjust world.\n\nEpic in scope, by turns satirical and heartbreaking, and speaking sharply to America’s current moment, Correspondents is a whirlwind story about displacement from one’s own roots, the violence America promotes both abroad and at home, and the resilience that allows families to remake themselves and endure even the most shocking upheavals.\n\n–\n\nForgiving Waters by Kenneth L. Capps:\n\nWhen the paths of an old cowboy and two young trespassers—-one black and one white—-cross, many lives are changed forever. Beauregard Lee Kelso grew up in a time of racial division and rampant prejudice. Now, at an age that is way past retirement, he struggles with decisions of his past that won’t allow him peace of mind. Kevin and Leonard are looking for some good fishing in one of the pasture watering holes when they cross onto Kelso’s land. This book is the winner of a 2012 Readers’ Favorite Honorable mention and a Gold (first place) Award in the 2013 Indie Next Generation Award for First Novel.\n\n–\n\nOut of the Dawn Light by Alys Clare:\n\n“Clare’s captivating first in a new medieval series dramatizes the clash between the old pagan ways and Christianity in 11th-century England. In 1087, with the death of William the Conqueror, the common people are in a rebellious mood. Meanwhile, Lassair, a 14-year-old girl from a Fenland village with special gifts, is learning to be a healer. When two young men ask her to use her skills to locate a hidden treasure, she can’t refuse. Lassair joins the men on an arduous trek across East Anglia to the coast, where they unearth a 500-year-old solid gold relic. This relic, Lassair realizes, has the power to cause immense harm. Clare (The Joys of My Life and 11 other Hawkenlye mysteries) brings the people of the period to vivid life with close attention to such matters as food, clothes and religious belief. Engaging characters, like Lassair’s obnoxious sister and her storytelling grandmother, enhance a well-crafted plot that builds to a chilling climax.” Reed Business Review\n\n–\n\nPond: A Novel by Claire-Louise Bennett:\n\nImmediately upon its publication in Ireland, Claire-Louise Bennett’s debut began to attract attention well beyond the expectations of the tiny Irish press that published it. A deceptively slender volume, it captures with utterly mesmerizing virtuosity the interior reality of its unnamed protagonist, a young woman living a singular and mostly solitary existence on the outskirts of a small coastal village. Sidestepping the usual conventions of narrative, it focuses on the details of her daily experience—from the best way to eat porridge or bananas to an encounter with cows—rendered sometimes in story-length, story-like stretches of narrative, sometimes in fragments no longer than a page, but always suffused with the hypersaturated, almost synesthetic intensity of the physical world that we remember from childhood. The effect is of character refracted and ventriloquized by environment, catching as it bounces her longings, frustrations, and disappointments—the ending of an affair, or the ambivalent beginning with a new lover. As the narrator’s persona emerges in all its eccentricity, sometimes painfully and often hilariously, we cannot help but see mirrored there our own fraught desires and limitations, and our own fugitive desire, despite everything, to be known.\n\nShimmering and unusual, Pond demands to be devoured in a single sitting that will linger long after the last page.\n\n–\n\nRiver of Darkness by Rennie Airth:\n\nSo you thought British detectives had to focus on “the colonel in the drawing room with a candlestick” solutions? Newcomer Airth blasts that stereotype with this tale of serial murder set in post-World War I Britain, featuring the debut of Inspector John Madden, a veteran whose experiences in the trenches give him an edge in tracking and capturing the killer. Meanwhile, Dr. Helen Blackwell entices Madden to employ psychiatric theories shunned at the time by Scotland Yard to explain and predict the killer’s behavior. Airth develops a situation that presages today’s much-touted psychological profiling and serves to build an almost excruciatingly suspenseful plot. In addition, his deft handling of the emotional aftereffects of war gives the work an added sense of purpose. Fans of Thomas Harris will enjoy this book and can take heart in knowing that another Madden tale is already in the works. Nancy McNicol, Hagaman Memorial Lib., East Haven, CT, Library Journal Review.\n\n–\n\nPRINT BOOK SUGGESTIONS:\n\nBeijing Payback: A Novel by Daniel Nieh:\n\n“Propulsive. . . . Highly enjoyable. . . . It sets up a sequel, one that I very much look forward to reading.” —The New York Times Book Review\n\nA fresh, smart, and fast-paced revenge thriller about a college basketball player who discovers shocking truths about his family in the wake of his father’s murder\n\nVictor Li is devastated by his father’s murder, and shocked by a confessional letter he finds among his father’s things. In it, his father admits that he was never just a restaurateur—in fact he was part of a vast international crime syndicate that formed during China’s leanest communist years.\n\nVictor travels to Beijing, where he navigates his father’s secret criminal life, confronting decades-old grudges, violent spats, and a shocking new enterprise that the organization wants to undertake. Standing up against it is likely what got his father killed, but Victor remains undeterred. He enlists his growing network of allies and friends to finish what his father started, no matter the costs.\n\n–\n\nBeyond Charlottesville: Taking a Stand Against White Nationalism by Terry McAuliffe with a forward by John Lewis:\n\nThe former governor of Virginia tells the behind-the-scenes story of the violent “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville―and shows how we can prevent other Charlottesvilles from happening.\n\nWhen Governor Terry McAuliffe hung up the phone on the afternoon of the violent “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, he was sure Donald Trump would do the right thing as president: condemn the white supremacists who’d descended on the college town and who’d caused McAuliffe to declare a state of emergency that morning. He didn’t. Instead Trump declared there was “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.” Trump was condemned from many sides himself, even by many Republicans, but the damage was done. He’d excused and thus egged on the terrorists at the moment when he could have stopped them in their tracks.\n\nIn Beyond Charlottesville, McAuliffe looks at the forces and events that led to the tragedy in Charlottesville, including the vicious murder of Heather Heyer and the death of two state troopers in a helicopter accident. He doesn’t whitewash Virginia history and discusses a KKK protest over the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. He takes a hard real-time behind-the-scenes look at the actions of everyone on that fateful August 12, including himself, to see what could have been done. He lays out what was done afterwards to prevent future Charlottesvilles―and what still needs to be done as America in general and Virginia in particular continue to grapple with their history of racism.\n\nBeyond Charlottesville will be the definitive account of an infamous chapter in our history, seared indelibly into memory, sure to be cited for years as a crucial reference point in the long struggle to fight racism, extremism and hate.\n\n–\n\nBorder Son by Samuel Parker\n\nIt’s been years since Edward Kazmierski has seen his wayward son. In fact, it’s been years since he has allowed thoughts of Tyler to even enter his mind. The last place he knew Tyler to be was in an El Paso jail six years ago. Then, in one day, he receives a cryptic phone call telling him that his son needs him in Mexico, another from a federal agent searching for Tyler, and a visit from two men he hopes to never meet again.\n\nSouth of the border, the chain of events set into motion by an impulsive act will almost certainly lead to death–for Tyler and for those who try to help him. But before Ed can recover his son, he will have to tear down the wall that has been built up between them.\n\nWith insight and artistry, Samuel Parker brings the dusty and dangerous streets of a Mexican border town into sharp focus in this suspenseful reimagining of the Prodigal Son story.\n\n–\n\nThe Liberation of Paris: How Eisenhower, De Gaulle, and Von Choltitz Saved the City of Light by Jean Edward Smith:\n\nPrize-winning and bestselling historian Jean Edward Smith tells the dramatic story of the liberation of Paris during World War II—a triumph that was achieved through the remarkable efforts of Americans, French, and Germans, all racing to save the city from destruction.\n\nFollowing their breakout from Normandy in late June 1944, the Allies swept across northern France in pursuit of the German army. The Allies intended to bypass Paris and cross the Rhine into Germany, ending the war before winter set in. But as they advanced, local forces in Paris began their own liberation, defying the occupying German troops.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, the leading figure of the Free French government, urged General Dwight Eisenhower to divert forces to liberate Paris. Eisenhower’s most senior staff recommended otherwise, but Ike wanted to help position de Gaulle to lead France after the war. And both men were concerned about partisan conflict in Paris that could leave the communists in control of the city and the national government, perhaps even causing a bloodbath like the Paris Commune. Neither man knew that the German commandant, Dietrich von Choltitz, convinced that the war was lost, dissembled and schemed to surrender the city to the Allies intact, defying Hitler’s orders to leave it a burning ruin.\n\nIn The Liberation of Paris, Jean Edward Smith puts this dramatic event in context, showing how the decision to free the city came at a heavy price: it slowed the Allied momentum and allowed the Germans to regroup. After the war German generals argued that Eisenhower’s decision to enter Paris prolonged the war for another six months. Was Paris worth this price? Smith answers this question in his superb, dramatic history of one of the great events of World War II—published seventy-five years after the liberation.\n\n–\n\nMeet Me In Monaco by Hazel Gaynor:\n\nSet in the 1950s against the backdrop of Grace Kelly’s whirlwind romance and unforgettable wedding to Prince Rainier of Monaco, New York Times bestselling author Hazel Gaynor and Heather Webb take the reader on an evocative sun-drenched journey along the Côte d’Azur in this page-turning novel of passion, fate and second chances…\n\nMovie stars and paparazzi flock to Cannes for the glamorous film festival, but Grace Kelly, the biggest star of all, wants only to escape from the flash-bulbs. When struggling perfumer Sophie Duval shelters Miss Kelly in her boutique to fend off a persistent British press photographer, James Henderson, a bond is forged between the two women and sets in motion a chain of events that stretches across thirty years of friendship, love, and tragedy.\n\nJames Henderson cannot forget his brief encounter with Sophie Duval. Despite his guilt at being away from his daughter, he takes an assignment to cover the wedding of the century, sailing with Grace Kelly’s wedding party on the SS Constitution from New York. In Monaco, as wedding fever soars and passions and tempers escalate, James and Sophie—like Princess Grace—must ultimately decide what they are prepared to give up for love.\n\n—–\n\nBook descriptions are provided by the publishers unless otherwise specified.\n\n—–\n\nHave a great week!\n\nLinda Reimer, SSCL\n\nOnline Catalog Links:\n\nStarCat\n\nThe catalog of physical materials, i.e. print books, DVDs, audiobooks on CD, etc., http://starcat.stls.org/client/en_US/default\n\nABOUT LIBRARY APPS:\n\nABOUT LIBRARY APPS:\n\nYou can access digital library content, i.e. eBooks & downloadable audiobooks, on PCs, Macs and mobile devices.\n\nFor mobile devices simply download the Libby app, for eBooks & downloadable audiobooks, or the RB Digital app, for on-demand magazines, from your app store to get started.
