        "text": "James has also become active in the preservation and restoration of other historic instruments such as the French Cristal Baschet and Ondes Martenot plus has begun performing early syncopated jazz and mid-century moderne styled period-piano repertoire within a multitude of other specialist musical activities generally considered of marginal cultural impact and predominantly subject to the periodic whims of amateurs and enthusiasts.\n\nJames was born in Philadelphia in 1950 and began formal organ training at the age of 12. At the age of 16, he replaced his teacher, Leonard ‘Melody Mac’ MacClain in concert when the latter suffered a heart attack before the performance, and that exposure put him on an international touring circuit. James attended Indiana University’s School of Music as a student of concert and church organ performance, earning his bachelor’s and master’s degrees under the tutelage of Dr. Oswald G. Ragatz.\n\nSilent Film Organ Performance:\n\nJames began performing silent films in October, 1969 and soon in full scale revival performances together with symphony orchestras beginning in 1971. From 1975 to 1989, James was the final employed staff “Resident Organist for the Ohio Theatre” in Columbus, Ohio having revived a bygone era professional position vacated in 1942. James had his organ concerto with orchestra debut with the Chicago Symphony in Orchestra Hall in 1984. James toured in the 1980s with silent film stars Lillian Gish and Charles ‘Buddy’ Rogers, providing musical accompaniment on national tour revivals of their motion pictures.\n\nJames “follows the technique and style of the old-time accompanists, cueing the music exactly to the action and mood on the screen.”\n\nIn 1998, James began simultaneously serving as House Organist for the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, House Organist for the Paramount Theatre in Seattle and House Organist for the Historic Everett Theatre in Everett, Washington.\n\nHe also has tour appointments as Theatre Organist for the San Diego Symphony, silent film organist for the Stanford Theatre and the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, continuing to encompass many additional positions over the years since.\n\nMost popular of James’ silent movie offering is his “Tribute to Lillian Gish” the so-called ‘First Lady of the Silent Film’ with whom he toured for 6 years back in the 70s and 80s as her personal music-for-film accompanist in her one-woman show tours.\n\nGlass armonica performance:\n\nDennis James plays the Franklin glass armonica and has collected other vitreous music instruments including several Francis Hopkinson Smith’s 19th century Grand Harmonicons, one of the few surviving Beyer 18th c. Glass-cords, and modern glass instrument inventions such as verrophone, the cristal d’ Baschet, along with a wide variety of glass flutes and glass bells.[4] He is currently constructing an expanded version of the French Bouteillophone creating a touring continuo instrument for 18th c. ensemble repertoire plus developing his own glass instrument invention, the Mesmerphone. James played his glass instruments on Marco Beltrami’s film scores for The Minus Man (1999) and The Faculty (1998). “I first became aware of glass instruments at about the age of 6 while visiting the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. I can still recall being mesmerized by the appearance of the original Benjamin Franklin armonica then on display in its own showcase in the entry rotunda of the city’s famed science museum.” In the interest of historical and philological accuracy, James adheres to Franklin’s original name, “armonica” without the “h”.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015 James served as the initial appointed Lecturer in glass music studies at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, designing a glass music studies program that including graduate level student instruction in Seraphim and Armonica (the first such academic appointment in the history of the field).\n\nJames performed glass armonica contributions to six of Linda Ronstadt’s popular music CD album projects, including Winter Light and the Grammy Award-winning “Dedicated to the One I Love” and “Trio II” featuring Dolly Parton and EmmyLou Harris.\n\n“Linda explained she had first heard the sounds of rubbed glass some 15 years before, just where, though, escapes her to this day. She kept that ethereal sound in her mind all those years and it was during the orchestra sessions and post-session mix on the track “A River for Him”, written by Emmylou Harris, that Linda had the inspiration to add the glass tones”, says James.\n\nJames appeared on Late Night with David Letterman with Ronstadt. “It was a great surprise. A sort of unspoken message in the air to me before the broadcast was ‘Do not say anything on the air!’ After all, these things are Linda’s appearances. When David Letterman leaned over his desk and directed a question to me I simply froze – on playback of the dub I can see myself caught and unable to speak. I received a glance from Linda that said to me it was OK and so when he tried again I called back a flip one liner and on things went from there”, says James.\n\nJames recorded for Sony-Classical release an album Featuring several glass music instruments, Cristal: Glass Music Through the Ages co-produced by Ronstadt and Grammy Award-winning producer John Boylan. James plays the glass armonica, the cristal and the seraphim on the CD in original historical compositions for glass by Mozart, Scarlatti, Schnaubelt, and Fauré. James collaborates with the Emerson String Quartet, operatic soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, and Ronstadt.\n\nOrgan Performance Positions:\n\nDennis currently is the appointed (2010) “Theatre Organist for the Washington Center” a professional position in the Washington Center for the Performing Arts in Olympia, Washington, the appointed (2010) “House Organist” for the Historic Coleman Theatre, Miami, Oklahoma, the Cinequest Festival silent film organist for California Theatre in San Jose, California and Silent Film organist for Stanford Theatre in Palo Alto, CA.\n\nARIVE EARLY & EXPERIENCE FOXBURG!\n\nBefore the 2:00 PM concert in Lincoln Hall, arrive early to stop by the Red Brick Gallery to enjoy the transcendent Nature Photography of JOHN M KARIAN in the Upstairs Gallery at the Red Brick Gallery, which opens at 12 noon on Sunday, July 31 – or view the exhibit after the concert from 4 to 6 PM during the Meet the Artist wine and cheese reception with Dennis James and John M Karian.\n\nFind that special gift for a wedding, anniversary or for yourself in the first floor Gift Shop with offerings of talented RBG Cooperative Artists – from jewelry and purses, to pottery and artisan wood cutting boards.
