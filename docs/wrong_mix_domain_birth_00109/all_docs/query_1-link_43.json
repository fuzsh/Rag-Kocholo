        "text": "Birmingham native Emmylou Harris hasn't exactly leaped into the political fray in her home state, but the singer-songwriter dipped a toe in during a recent concert in New York City.\n\n\"I love Alabama, and it'll always be my home state,\" Harris said during a Dec. 3 performance at Town Hall, according to Page Six. \"There's a lot of weird stuff going on down there right now, but there are a lot of good people in Alabama, and I believe things are changing.\"\n\nPresumably, the \"weird stuff\" on Harris' mind is the same thing that's gripped political watchers across the nation: the controversy surrounding Alabama's Dec. 12 special election for a seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe election, which pits Democrat Doug Jones against Republican Roy Moore, has been rocked by allegations that Moore, 70, had improper sexual contact with teenage girls in the 1970s, when he was in his early 30s and the deputy district attorney of Etowah County. Moore has denied the allegations, pointing to a political witch hunt."
