        "text": "April 2: Emmylou Harris was born in 1947, Happy Birthday!\n\nEmmylou Harris (born April 2, 1947) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. She has released many chart-topping albums and singles over the course of her career, and has won 12 Grammys and numerous other awards.\n\nHer work and recordings include work as a solo artist, bandleader, an interpreter of other composers’ works and as a singer-songwriter, and a backing vocalist and duet partner. She has worked with numerous leading artists including Gram Parsons, John Denver, Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton, Roy Orbison, The Band, Mark Knopfler, Delbert McClinton, Guy Clark, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Bright Eyes, Rodney Crowell, John Prine, Neil Young, and Steve Earle.\n\nEmmylou Harris, Tulsa Queen.\n\nThe Hot Band: Albert Lee, Emory Gordy, John Ware, Glen D Hardin, Rodney Crowell, Hank Devito.\n\nFrom 1977 Old Grey Whistle Test:\n\nBorn April 2, 1947 (age 68)\n\nBirmingham, Alabama, United States Genres Folk, country rock, country,bluegrass, rock, pop, alt-country Occupations Singer-songwriter, musician Instruments Voice, guitar Years active 1969–present\n\nBy the 1990s, Harris started receiving less airplay as mainstream country stations began shifting their focus to the youth-oriented “new country” format. As with Brand New Dance, 1993’s Cowgirl’s Prayer—Harris’ first studio album after her switch to Elektra Records—was critically praised but received very little airplay, and its lead single, “High Powered Love” charted very low, peaking at No. 63, prompting her to shift her career in a new direction.\n\nIn 1995, Harris released one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the decade, Wrecking Ball, produced by Daniel Lanois, best known for his work with U2, Peter Gabriel and Bob Dylan. An experimental album for Harris, the record included Harris’s rendition of the Neil Young-penned title track (Young himself provided guest vocals on two of the album’s songs), Steve Earle’s “Goodbye”, Julie Miller’s “All My Tears”, Jimi Hendrix’s “May This Be Love”, Kate and Anna McGarrigle’s “Goin’ Back to Harlan” and Gillian Welch’s “Orphan Girl”. U2’s Larry Mullen, Jr. showed up to play drums for the project. The album received virtually no country airplay whatsoever, but did bring Harris to the attention of alternative rock listeners, many of whom had never listened to her music before.\n\nAlbum of the day, Wrecking Ball:\n\n– Hallgeir"
