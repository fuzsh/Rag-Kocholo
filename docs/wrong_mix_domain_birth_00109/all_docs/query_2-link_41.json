        "text": "Acclaimed country singer/songwriter Emmylou Harris has had a prolific career as both a solo artist and a collaborator.\n\nHarris released her first album Gilding Bird in 1969. But it wasn't until she Gram Parsons, former leader of the country-rock band the Flying Burrito Brothers, that her career gained momentum.\n\nShe became Parson's protege, singing on his debut solo album 1973's GP and his follow-up 1974's Grievous Angel. But, before his second album was released, Parsons had died of a heart attack.\n\nHarris regrouped from the loss of her mentor and friend, releasing her major label debut Pieces of the Sky in 1975. It featured covers of the Beatles, Merle Haggard and budding songwriter Rodney Crowell. She followed it up with Elite Hotel in 1976.\n\nTwo more albums came quickly thereafter, 1977's Luxury Liner and 1978's Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town, before Harris shifted gears and turned to a more traditional country sound with her 1979 release Blue Kentucky Girl. It ended up winning the Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal Performance.\n\nThe following year, she dueted with Roy Orbison on the single 'That Lovin' You Feelin' Again', which went on to win the Grammy for Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group.\n\nAfter releasing more traditional country albums, Harris experienced crossover success when her cover of 'Mr. Sandman', from her 1981 album Evangeline, hit the top 40 chart.\n\nHarris moved to Nashville in 1982 and began writing her own songs. While much of her early records feature covers, Harris co-wrote 1985's The Ballad of Sally Rose and set the stage for the rest of her songwriting career.\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Harris has regularly collaborated with other musicians, including Linda Ronstadt, Bob Dylan and Neil Young.\n\nIn the mid-80s, Harris released the collaborative album Trio with Dolly Parton and long-time friend and collaborator Linda Ronstadt. Trio 2 followed in 1999. She also contributed her vocal talents to the O Brother Where Art Thou? soundtrack, which won the 2002 Grammy for Album of the Year.\n\nHarris released her 26th studio album Hard Bargain in 2011. That same year, the Academy of Country Music honored Harris with the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award. In 2018, the Grammys gave her its Lifetime Achievement Award."
