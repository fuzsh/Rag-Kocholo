        "text": "DPAC offers a variety of Accessible Seating & Accessible Services to make our performances and facilities accessible to all.\n\nAccessible entrances, parking, restrooms, and seating options including a variety of wheelchair accessible locations and companion seating.\n\nADA compliant ramp access and elevators to all lobbies and seating areas.\n\nCourtesy shuttles from nearby parking areas, curb-to-seat wheelchair assistance and listening devices at every event.\n\nPlus, audio description, captioning, and sign language interpretation upon request.\n\nAccessible Services - We’re here to help!\n\nFor additional information, questions or more specific details on accessibility or any accommodation or service listed below, please contact us via e-mail at AccessibleServices@DPACnc.com.\n\nAccessible Seats - Ticket Purchases\n\nTo purchase Accessible Seats, please visit the Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina Ticket Center\n\nFor additional information, questions or details on an accommodation or service not listed below, please contact us via e-mail at AccessibleServices@DPACnc.com.\n\nAccessible Seating\n\nAccessible Parking\n\nAccessible Restrooms\n\nListening Devices\n\nDrop-off / Pick-up & Courtesy Wheelchairs\n\nAudio Description\n\nCaptioning\n\nSign Language Interpretation\n\nService Animals\n\nDPAC offers a diverse selection of entertainment. Not all productions will appeal to or be appropriate for every guest or for all ages. Ticket buyers should take responsibility for making informed decisions regarding their purchases. We recommend visiting the official website of each show to learn more about the show you are coming to see at DPAC. If you ever have questions about the content or appropriateness of a show, please contact us at GuestServices@dpacnc.com.\n\nStanding and Dancing at Concerts: DPAC is proud to welcome all types of concerts to our stage. Sometimes during the course of a concert performance, audience members will show their enthusiasm by standing and dancing, especially when encouraged by the performers to do so. Unless directed by the show, we do not ever enforce a must sit policy at concerts. For most concerts, this would not be acceptable to the performers on stage who often love it when the crowd is moved enough by the performance to stand. This is especially true for rock shows and for seats closest to the stage.\n\nPlease know that DPAC does not have a “no standing” policy and in most situations will allow guests to stand even if they block the view of the stage for other guests. If your view is ever blocked by a standing or dancing guest, please contact an usher and we’ll attempt to find alternative seating.\n\nCurrently, this event has not approved using our video screens. Please feel free to check back closer to the event for updates. If approved, we will post notice here.\n\nFor many concert, comedy, and special events at DPAC, we offer added views of the stage with two big screens (size: 16’ x 9’) hung to the sides of the stage or above the stage. These big screens can add to the visual experience of our concert, comedy, and special events and give guests seated farther from the stage what we like to call “a tenth row view”. Approval to use these screens always rests with the visiting show and about half of all concert and comedy events do use these screens."
