        "text": "Artist: Darin & Brooke Aldridge\n\nHometown: Shelby, North Carolina\n\nSong: “Emmylou” (First Aid Kit cover)\n\nAlbum: Inner Journey\n\nLabel: Rounder Records\n\nIn Their Words: “When we were choosing songs for this album project, Brooke and I were poring through YouTube videos looking through Emmylou Harris songs, when this tune popped up. We immediately were drawn to it and decided to record it.” — Darin Aldridge\n\n“The song seemed perfect for us as a couple that makes music together. There’s not a day that goes by that Darin and I don’t share a smile and wonder how we got lucky enough to find each other. Years of searching and praying for that exact moment when love would find us. Little did we know what started out as the same musical goals and ambitions would bring our hearts together in a marriage and a career of music.” — Brooke Aldridge\n\nPhoto courtesy of Darin & Brooke Aldridge"
