        "text": "Before my Dad bought our first television in 1950, Saturday nights in Anniston, Alabama, belonged to radio station WSM (Nashville) broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nWe had one radio, I preferred “Big Band” music from the 1940s, and Mom and I associated country music with honky-tonks where Dad had spent lots of time as a young man. Only much later when I became interested in our sharecropper roots in Northeast Alabama did I pay attention.\n\nAs a teenage “preacher boy,” I should have connected “shape note” singing in country churches where I preached and which my father attended as a boy to the secular music he listened to on Saturday nights. Watching film-maker Ken Burns’ sixteen hour PBS special on country music connected the dots for me. At the end of the series I felt the same pride as when millions of American readers last year voted Harper Lee’s novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, the nation’s favorite novel.\n\nOur story really began with immigrants from Europe, who brought fiddles, ballads, and minor key music, and African slaves who brought not only the knowledge of banjoes and drums, but the horrific memory and pathos of the “Middle-Passage” from their homeland. In time, newer musical currents and the expansion of the plantation/slavery system forced “white” roots music into remote parts of Appalachia, and its “black” equivalent to the Mississippi Delta and Alabama Black Belt.\n\nBurns granted musicians from Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, and Oklahoma due credit; but the heart of the series dealt with Alabama. The first segment pivoted quickly from origins in Europe and Africa to the seminal influence of North Carolina’s Carter family and Alabama’s Jimmie (James Charles) Rodgers. Although the film identified Rodgers’ with Meridian, Mississippi, he signed a legal document late in life claiming his birth place as Geiger (Sumter County) Alabama. His mother died when he was a boy, so he grew up with relatives in Southwest Alabama and Southeast Mississippi. Work as a brakeman on trains running from Birmingham to Meridian helped supply his nickname, “The Singing Brakeman,” and his musical repertoire, which included yodeling.\n\nHank Williams followed in his wake. Born in Mount Olive (Butler County),Williams introduced honky-tonk glitz and African American blues that he heard from “Tee Top,” a Montgomery street musician who traded guitar lessons for meals and money.\n\nPerfecting his song-writing and singing in endless performances in dives filled with working class whites, he moved in time to the nationally broadcast “Louisiana Hayride” in Shreveport, Louisiana, then to Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry where his high lonesome blues dominated country music charts from the end of the Second World War to his death at age 29. The famous Rose-Acuff studio recorded 89 of his songs during the first months of 1952 alone. More than 20,000 fans grieved at his 1953 funeral, perhaps more “fans” than had listened to Jefferson Davis’s inaugural address as president of the Confederacy. And nearly seventy-five years later, his grave remains a shrine visited by hundreds-of-thousands of admirers annually. Burns devoted nearly two of his sixteen hours to William’s musical legacy.\n\nThe first class of the Country Music Hall of Fame included both Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers, and in 2010 the Pulitzer Prize Committee awarded Williams a posthumous citation for his “craftmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.”\n\nLess famous Alabama contemporaries spread Alabama country music far and wide. The Jared Maddox family moved from their sharecrop home to California’s central valley during the Great Depression, joining “Oakies” (Oklahoma residents) and “Arkies” (Arkansans) in harvesting row crops. They traveled part-way on foot before following the custom of the day, illegally jumping aboard a freight train. Having grown up listening to the Carter family and Jimmie Rodgers, the Maddox brothers and sister, Rose, formed one of the most successful “hillbilly” bands of the 1930s.\n\nNot every “famous” singer departed for Nashville or California. In fact, the tiny Sand Mountain hamlet of Henagar remained the center of Sacred Harp acapella music and provided the next generation of Alabama musicians. Brothers Rabon and Alton Delmore of Elkmont grew up singing the haunting sacred music common in the hill country’s rural Baptist churches.\n\nThey introduced close harmony, male duet singing to the Grand Ole Opry, and in the 1930s traveled throughout the Eastern U. S. in the company of African American harmonica player, Deford Bailey, refusing to eat in restaurants that would not serve their companion. Ira and Charlie Louvin of Henagar perfected and expanded the Delmore duet style of country blues in the 1940s and 1950s, when their songs topped the country charts 22 times. Decades later Emmylou Harris, born in Birmingham but already popular in the Northeast for her contemporary folk and rock compositions, discovered the Louvin brother harmonies, incorporated them in her repertoire, and launched a spectacular career crossing over from younger audiences to traditional rural and working class people.\n\nUnfortunately, Burns terminated the story of country music’s evolution before the appearance of Randy Owen, Jeffrey Cook, and Teddy Wayne Gentry from DeKalb County on Sand Mountain. They formed a band with the generic name, “Alabama,” introduced a new-age sound, combined wonderful musicianship with compelling lyrics (“Mountain Music;” “My Home’s in Alabama;” “Dixieland Delight”), and won group entertainer of the year award five consecutive years. Their 41 number one country records and total record sales of more than 75 million rank as one of the greatest commercial successes in music history. They did for country music what University of Alabama football did for sport: establish a new benchmark for excellence.\n\nThe fusion of black and white roots music did not begin with Hank Williams/Tee Top or the Delmore brothers/Deford Bailey. But it is certain that no one did more to integrate American music than Sam Phillips of Florence (where he was a contemporary of W. C. Handy, the black musician often incorrectly called the “father of the blues,” which he popularized among whites but learned in the Mississippi Delta).\n\nFamiliar with shape note, hillbilly, rhythm-and-blues, gospel, other traditional music, and blues, Phillips moved to Memphis after the Second World War where he established Sun Records. Demonstrating a keen ear for the ecclectic musical scene on Memphis’s Beale Street which incorporated all these forms, he produced the first “rock-and-roll” record in 1951. Combining the spirited Pentecostal beat that Elvis Presley grew up with in Tupelo, Mississippi, with the Delta blues of B.B. King, both of whom he “discovered,” he also first recorded Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Howlin’ Wolf, and Charlie Rich.\n\nIt would not be a stretch for me to revise Burns narrative from an Alabama historical perspective. Country music was born in British ballads and fiddle tunes and in Africa’s jiggling banjoes and rhythmic drums, traveled to America on ships full of hopeful immigrants and terrified slaves, shrank into Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, and Alabama’s Black Belt, survived there in rural churches and honky-tonks, exploded nationwide in the 1920s with the Carter family and Jimmie Rodgers, then took the world by storm (even returning to its English origins through its influence on the Beatles)."
