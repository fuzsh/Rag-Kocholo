A registration statement covering the debentures in that amount was filed on Jan. 10 with the SEC. The offering, is expected to be made around Jan. 30, after the registration statement becomes effective, through an under¬ writing group headed by The First Boston Corp. The plans for the financing were announced by Kempton Dunn, Fresident, who said the directors chose long-term debentures as the best medium through which to raise these additional funds at this time The company's capital program is now estimated to require approxi¬ mately $17,000,000 during 1957 and between $12,000,000 and $15,000,000 in 1958. The program is designed to increase manuiacturing facilities, improve operating efficiency and replace worn and obsolete equipment. Present-plans anticipate expansion of maganese steel foundries, in¬ creased manufacturing facilities for several hydraulic products and possibly the construction of a second plant for the manufacture of cast steel freight car wheels. The program also includes a new plant for high quality aluminum castings for the aircraft industry. In addition to the $12,000,000 obtained from the sale of the debentures, depreciation accruals will generate approximately $14,000,C00 during the years 1957 and 1958. The balance of the funds which may be needed for capital expenditures and working capital are expected to be obtained from retained earnings.—V. 184, p. 2437.
