        "text": "Marine Applications of Paxman Diesel Engines\n\nNon-Naval Vessels\n\nRelated Pages:\n\nPaxman Diesel Engines since 1934 • Paxman Engine Type Identifiers • Diesel-Electric Marine Propulsion • The Blockade Runners (Vee RB)\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is clear that from the time Paxman launched its first range of diesel engine in 1927, the Company had its eye on the marine market. Its first publicity booklet about these oil engines (Publication No 931, issued in 1927) was entitled Marine Oil Engines for Auxiliary Work, Lighting Sets, Etc. It was not long before the Company began to supply engines for marine propulsion as well as auxiliary duties and, during the 1930s, Paxman successfully established itself in both these markets, selling to the Navy and to commercial owners. During the Second World War the Company was fully occupied building engines for the British Admiralty. After the war the Royal Navy continued to be a very important customer but non-naval marine markets also came to provide a major stream of business. By February 1978 Paxman had built more than 1,200 RPHs alone, for auxiliary duties in commercial vessels. A large proportion of these were for electrical power generation on cargo ships, such as the SD.14 Liberty Replacement Ships built by Austin & Pickersgill during the 1960s and 1970s. Paxman has continued to supply engines for non-naval marine applications, both propulsion and auxiliary, up to the end of the 20th century and into the new millennium.\n\nIt would be impossible to compile a comprehensive listing of non-naval marine installations of Paxman diesels. The page is intended to give a flavour of the wide range of non-naval vessels for which Paxman has supplied engines, and of typical applications.\n\nIf you have suggestions for additions, corrections or other improvements to this page please do contact me with details.\n\nDetails of naval vessels supplied with Paxman engines can be found on the pages Marine Applications : Royal Navy and Overseas Navies - Surface Ships and Paxman Submarine Engines.\n\nVessels of the 1930s\n\n'DEV Lochfyne' - Coastal Passenger Vessel\n\nBuilt by William Denny & Brothers Ltd of Dumbarton for David MacBrayne (1928) Ltd to operate on the Clyde and the West Coast of Scotland.

Three Paxman 4-cylinder auxiliaries.\n\n'Vehicular Ferry No. 4' - River Clyde Ferry\n\nBuilt by Ferguson Brothers (Port Glasgow) Ltd for the Clyde Navigation Trust. Completed in 1938, this vehicle ferry plied between Govan and Partick, in Glasgow. The passage time was estimated to be about two minutes, followed by a four minute wait at the end of each journey. Because of the rise and fall of the tide, about 12 foot at the crossing, the vessel was equipped with an elevating platform which could be raised or lowered to the level of the quay at all states of the tide. The ferry had twin screws at each end but no rudders, being steered solely by the screws.

Two 12RPHM, each rated 400 bhp at 1,000 rpm, for propulsion, each driving a propeller through an oil operated MWD 3:1 reduction gearbox. The two propulsion engines and an additional three 12RPH engines drove five Merryweather four-stage centrifugal fire and salvage pumps. One further 12RPH spare engine was carried.\n\n'Orlik' - Seine Netter\n\nA 46 ft Danish-built seine netter owned by Tom Sleight Ltd, Grimsby. Original single-cylinder semi-diesel of continental manufacture was replaced, circa 1955, by a 4RPHM, driving a variable pitch propeller through a 3:1 reduction gearbox. (photo ref 5149)\n\n'East Bank' - Seine Netter\n\nOwned by Tom Sleight Ltd, Grimsby. One 4RPHM propulsion engine. Paxman, in collaboration with the owners, carried out a fully instrumented sea trial on 'East Bank' throughout the whole of a 17-day fishing trip. Paxman wished to acquire data about the actual operating conditions and performance of an RPH engine in a fishing vessel of this type.\n\n'Ling Bank' - Seine Netter\n\nOne of many seine netters owned and operated by Tom Sleight Ltd of Grimsby, who not only owned their own vessels but also provided the services needed ashore for some skippers who owned their own boats. Most of these skippers were Danes as seine netting was a Danish development. Ling Bank was fitted with one 4RPHM propulsion engine, rated 160 bhp, circa 1957.\n\n'Cullen Bay' - Seine Netter\n\nRe-engined circa 1957 for a Danish owner by Tom Sleight Ltd Marine Diesel Service (Grimsby) Ltd. One 4RPHM propulsion engine, developing 105 shp.\n\n'Streymoy' - Seine Netter\n\nA Danish seine netter. Original single cylinder semi-diesel replaced by a vee 4RPHM Series II, rated 133 bhp at 1,000 rpm, 153 bhp at 1,200 rpm, driving a variable pitch propeller through a reduction gearbox.\n\nA number of typical 65 foot Danish-type seine netters were re-engined with 4RPHM propulsion engines, for both Danish and British owners. The Danish boats had originally been fitted with single cylinder hot-bulb semi-diesels made by builders like Tuxham of Copenhagen. These were relatively large for their output, 95/105 bhp (at 300 rpm ?) and weighed about 6 tons. John Cove has commented that re-engining was sometimes done without thinking of the fact that a Paxman engine weighed about the same as the flywheel of the semi-diesel. Unless ballast was added to compensate, the stabilty of the whole boat would be reduced and unless crews were very careful the powerful winches used could pull the whole boat over.\n\nAt least three Danish seine netters were engined (possibly by Tuxham who had agreed special prices with Paxman) with one 6RPHM each, 337 bhp at 1,200 rpm, for operators Lars Pederson, A/S Omø Fargefart and Gerda Jørgensen.\n\n'Well Bank' - Seine Netter\n\nBuilt by J S Doig (Grimsby) Ltd for the Delga Fishing Co Ltd, Grimsby. One 4RPHM, installed circa 1957, developing 105 shp and driving a Slack & Parr variable pitch propeller.\n\n'Pacific Pearl' - Seine Netter\n\nBuilt at the Matsumoto Shipyards, Dollarton, British Columbia, in about 1957, for a Vancouver fishing company. One 6RPHM for propulsion, developing 230 shp. Speed 10.8 knots.\n\n'Cap Fagnet III' - Trawler\n\nBuilt by Ateliers et Chantiers de la Seine Maritime, in 1956, for Société de Pêcheries de Fécamp of France to operate in Newfoundland waters. LOA 245 ft, beam 37 ft 9 in, draught 19 ft 4 in, making it, at the time, one of the largest diesel-electric trawlers in the world. Three 8YLCZ, rated 800 bhp (543kW electrical) at 800 rpm, ordered from Paxman in 1955 and despatched in June the following year. Each engine direct-coupled to Sautter-Harle tandem DC generators, 510kW for propulsion and 150kW for other requirements. Two propulsion motors, each rated 960 bhp at 850 rpm, driving through reduction gears to a single propeller.\n\nThe diesel-electric arrangement successfully met the need for a high passage speed (12½ knots when loaded) combined with a low trawling speed (3 to 4 knots). The average trip was of 100 to 120 days duration, only 16 of which were on passage to or from the fishing grounds.\n\nEngine room of the 'Cap Fagnet' with its three 8-cylinder YL engines.\n\nThe contract in Paxman's records specifies that the engine nameplate was to be inscribed 750 bhp at 750 rpm but that the actual contract rating was to be 800 bhp (543kW electrical) at 800 rpm. The difference was puzzling until John Cove, who was closely involved with the project, emailed to say he had forgotten this detail but that it is fairly easy to see the reason looking at the power figures given above. The contract rating of 800 bhp per engine would be sufficient to produce 549kw if one assumes a generator efficience of 92%. But each engine was coupled to a generator capable of 510 + 150 =660kW, so even if the engines were run at 800 rpm they could not match the potential output of their generators.\n\nThe two propulsion motors are quoted as 960 bhp, which refers to the power into the propeller shaft. So, assuming 92% efficiency for these too, each of them can draw 1,043 bhp which equates to 778kW - a total of 1,556kW at full power. To this must be added 300kW for auxiliary purposes, giving a total of 1,856kw, which is in pretty good agreement with the contract rating but more than could be attained at 750rpm engine speed.\n\nJohn thinks the idea of the lower rating on the plate was to provide a safety margin, and perhaps to keep the fishermen ignorant of the inbuilt margin, because any fisherman returning home with a catch is going to run the machinery flat out. Fishermen are well known for interfering with overload stop settings on their engines to get more power and this has adverse effects on life between overhauls. There is also the point that when the ship is not going full speed to and from the fishing grounds, it is always actively fishing and control is from the bridge and will require occasional bursts of power. The engineers would have found it difficult to shut down one engine for a while for maintenance unless the others had a little bit in hand.\n\nJohn also recalls some information that was given at the time as to why no further ships of this kind were built. The machinery was just too complicated for fishermen and required a qualified electrical engineer in charge at all times. Such people found that with their qualifications they could find a much more attractive job than working on a fishing boat and it became very difficult to find qualified staff ready to join once they had heard what life on a fishing boat was like.\n\n'MV World Unity' - Tanker\n\nBuilt by Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd in 1956 for North-American Shipping and Trading Co (London) Ltd. One 6RPHZ driving a 100kW alternator set.\n\n'Susie' - Pusher Tug\n\nBuilt in 1957 and operated by Société de Transport, Lagos. Two 8RPHM, each 255 bhp, for propulsion.

Two 8RPH auxiliaries, each driving 125kW generator sets at 900 rpm.\n\n'Royal Wood', 'Royal Pulp', 'Royal Board' and 'Royal Paper'\n\nFour ships built for AB Statens Skogsindustrier (Swedish State Forest Industries), Stockholm, between 1957 and 1959, by AB Gävle Varv, Gävle, Sweden. Each ship was fitted with a 12 cylinder YLCM engine, producing 1,395 shp at 776 rpm, for propulsion. The ships had a speed of 12.5 knots and were 499 tons, designed to be so because of a Swedish law which dictated that ships over 500 tons gross had to have three mates and three engineering officers. These ships and their engines were mentioned in an article published in the Swedish marine magazine Länspumpen, issue 2008:3, pp. 31-32.\n\nRight: Royal Wood\n\nA similar ship, 'Lanrick', was built by AB Gävle Varv for George Gibson of Leith.\n\n'Yola' - Pusher Tug\n\nBuilt by Yarrow Shipbuilders, Scotstoun, in 1958 for United Africa Co Ltd, London.

Two 16RPHM, (each developing 435 bhp?) for propulsion.\n\n'Tyee Shell' - Oil Tanker\n\n1,890 ton tanker built by Collingwood Shipyard, Ontario, in 1958, for Canadian Shell Tankers Ltd, to operate on the west coast of Canada. Two 8YLCM propulsion engines, each producing 804 shp at 750 rpm, driving a single screw through two scoop-controlled fluid couplings to a single MWD 4:1 reverse/reduction gearbox. Two 8RPHZ auxiliaries driving 200kW generator sets and one 4RPHZ driving a 100kW set.\n\n1970 renamed Artic Trader, 1983 renamed River Shell, 1995 renamed Horizon Montreal. 2004 sold to Aurora Holding and renamed Alysia S1. 2005 sold to Guyana and renamed New Horizon.\n\n'MV France I' and 'MV France II' - Meteorological Vessels\n\nBuilt by Forges et Chantiers de la Mediterranee, Le Havre, circa 1958, for the French Government. Diesel-electric propulsion. Three 8YLCZ per vessel, each rated 860 bhp (600kW electric) at 720 rpm and 940 bhp (655kW electric) at 900 rpm. Each engine driving a Jeumont tandem 220kW AC alternator and a DC generator; the AC supply for the services load and DC for the propulsion motors. The engines for France I were despatched in June 1958 and those for France II in October that year.\n\nA Paxman file note says that the alternators were to run at 720 rpm which would indicate that the higher 900 rpm power rating would be for propulsion power only. The vessels would be required to spend long periods on station, presumably in the mid-Atlantic, where one engine would be run to provide electrical power for services and a small amount of propulsion power to enable the vessel to hold its position against wind and current. When travelling to or from station much more power would be required and two or three engines would be run with only one running at 720 rpm.\n\nIn October 2015 I received an email from Mike Hull who had recently visited La Rochelle and its maritime museum. There he found MV France I. Much to his surprise and delight, he was able not only to go on board the vessel but also visit the engine room (open to visitors) and view the three 8YL engines.\n\n'Pinar del Rio', 'Las Villas', 'Matanzas' and 'Habana' - Bulk Sugar Carriers\n\nBuilt by the Atlantic Shipbuilding Company, Newport, South Wales, between 1958 and 1960, for the Cuban Government. Each with two 16YLCM, each developing 1,680 shp, coupled to a single output Renk reverse/reduction gearbox for propulsion. Three 6RPHZ auxiliaries, each developing 149 bhp at 850 rpm and direct coupled to a Campbell and Isherwood 100kW, 220 volt generator.\n\nJohn Cove was aboard 'Pinar del Rio' when she made her first trip out of the dock in Newport where she was built. He recalls: \"We had a couple of bits of excitement on the trip. They opened the dock gate and the ship went ahead towards the opening. She was not quite straight so the helmsman attempted to make a course correction. This made matters much worse and we headed for the dock wall. I was on deck and braced myself for the inevitable impact but, when we hit the dock wall, the ship's gunwhale and bulkhead above deck level made a good 'crumple zone' and although they got very badly bent inwards there was little shock involved.\n\nIt transpired that the steering wheel and the rudder were operated electrically and, although Atlantic Shipbuilders has checked that the rudder did indeed move when the wheel was moved, nobody had thought to check that it moved the correct way. So they uncrossed the wires and we proceeded to sea.\n\nWhen we opened up the engines to full power the engine room filled with thick acrid smoke and had to be evacuated, although the engines could still be controlled from the bridge. We had time to see that the smoke was coming from the exhaust pipes which were now hot for the first time. They were lagged with asbestos cloth and it transpired that the yard had rather foolishly painted them before applying the lagging, so we had to wait until all the paint had burned off and the engine room ventilators had cleared the smoke before we could go back in there.\"\n\n'Samson' - Floating Crane\n\nTwin-screw 60 ton floating crane built by Lobnitz & Co of Renfrew in 1959 for Mersey Docks & Harbour Board, Liverpool.

Originally schemed as a 14,000 ton vessel, when built SD.14s were approximately 15,000 tons dw. They were planned as low cost 'standard' vessels, built to a basic specification to which options could be added. Most were built by Austin & Pickersgill Ltd (who developed the SD.14) and the neighbouring yard of Bartram & Sons Ltd, on the River Wear. Some were built under licence by Hellenic Shipyards in Greece. The first SD.14s were completed in February 1968 and it is said that ultimately over 200 were built.\n\nPaxman supplied large numbers of RPH engines as auxiliaries for SD.14s, particularly in the late 1960s and during the 1970s. It supplied them for probably 140 or more SD.14s. Some SD.14s had medium-speed auxiliaries, where specified by owners who preferred this type of engine to the faster running RPH.\n\nAll SD.14 vessels had three generator sets. Initially the basic design specified 170kW alternators, to provide the minimum power required to meet the electrical load. The introduction of additional equipment, chosen from a list of optional items, resulted in a higher base load than was originally planned. This resulted in a change to the specification which, by late-1969, was three 6RPHXZ (turbocharged) auxiliaries, coupled to MacFarlane 218kW brushless alternators, running at 1,200 rpm. From the summer of 1970 this was further upgraded to three 6RPHCZ (turbocharged and intercooled) auxiliaries, rated at 409 bhp, coupled to MacFarlane 280kW, 440 volt, 3-phase, 60-cycle alternators, running at 1,200 rpm. For higher outputs 8- and 12-cylinder RPHs were supplied. Using 12RPHXZ and 12RPHCZ auxiliaries, generator outputs of up to 570kW per set could be offered. A later development of the SD.14 was the B.26, a small 26,000 tonne bulk carrier. These all had three 8RPHCZ Mk 7 generator sets.\n\nOne of the first SD.14 ships to be built was ''MV Nicola', for Mavrolean Brothers, 15,000 tons d.w. (pictured right). This had three 6RPHXZ auxiliaries, driving 218kW alternator sets.\n\n(see The Motor Ship, May 1967.

Paxman supplied two stand-by emergency generator sets for the QE2, each driven by a naturally-aspirated 12RPHZ Series II engine. The sets are located high in the hull, at the stern, under a swimming pool. The engines have radiator cooling which allows the sets to be used even when the ship is in dry dock. As at 2008 the engines were still regularly tested and in good order.\n\nThe emergency sets were built under Paxman Contract Nos 58913 and 58914 (Engine Nos 650036/1 and /2) and despatched on 19th April 1967, not long before QE2 was launched. The sets were built on an underbase, similar to Paxman's industrial generator sets, and had AEI alternators, rated 350kW at 1,200 rpm.\n\n'MV Lakeshell' - Oil Tanker\n\nBuilt by Marine Industries Ltd, Sorel, Quebec, Canada, in 1969, for Shell Canada Ltd.

Renamed Pentalina-B, it was used on the service between Gills Bay and St Margaret's Hope on Orkney. When replaced on this route in 2009 it was sold to a company intending to operate it around Cape Verde. During a Lloyds survey on the port main engine, this was found to be in such poor condition that a major overhaul became necessary. The ship eventually sailed and, after having to put into a French port en-route for repairs because it was taking in water, arrived in Cape Verde and was put into service. In June 2014 the ferry ran aground on rocks at Cape Verde, during a storm, becoming a total loss.\n\n'Esso Northumbria' - Oil Tanker\n\nBuilt by Swan, Hunter Shipbuilders Ltd, Wallsend in 1970 for Esso Petroleum.
