        "text": "In 1941 Montanan had a cameo in the April 21st edition of Life Magazine. On pages 34 and 35 was a brief article entitled: ‘A Messerschmitt 110, Gift from the R.A.F., Arrives here for Study by U.S. Engineers’, which read:\n\n“At Los Angeles, April 5, U.S. aeronautical engineers got their first good look at a Messerschmitt 110, Germany’s fast deadly destroyer plane which has given R.A.F. pilots their stiffest competition and English production experts their worst headache in the Battle of Britain. Shot down virtually intact and presented to the U.S. by the British Air Ministry for study and inspection, the bullet-scarred fighter shown on these pages repudiated once and for all the popular misapprehension that German planes are gimcrack affairs, flimsily constructed and inadequately equipped. Aeronautical experts at Vultee Field, where it was assembled for examination, declared that in materials as well as design the Messerschmitt 110 was the equal of Britain’s and America’s best planes.”\n\n“Designed for combat and escort work, the Me-110 does better than 365 m.p.h., has a range of 800 miles, packs four machine guns and two cannon in its nose and a swivel gun aft, and seats a crew of three – pilot, radioman and gunner. Though eight-gunned, more maneuverable Spitfires and Hurricanes have shot down many a Me-110, their short range keeps them close to base. Before Britain can hope to carry offensive war to Germany, it must develop something comparable to this big bi-motored destroyer. U.S. engineers admired its clean lines, marveled at the perfection of its rugged 1,150 h.p. fuel-injection Daimler-Benz motors. Only criticism they uttered concerned inadequate armor for the cockpit, a blind spot in the belly.”\n\nAccording to historian John Vasco:\n\n“The Messerschmitt Bf 110 passed by Britain to the USA was Bf 110 D-0/B which belonged to the 2nd Staffel of Erprobungsgruppe 210 (the second Squadron of Test Wing 210) It carried the unit markings of S9+CK. 'S9' denoted the unit; 'K' denoted 2nd Staffel, and it was aircraft 'C' within the Staffel. It arrived in the USA in April 1941 aboard the SS Montanan.”\n\n“It was shot down on 15th August 1940 following the unit's raid on Croydon airfield, to the south of London. The pilot, Oberleutant Alfred Habisch, made a good belly-landing at Hawkhurst in Kent, and he and his wireless operator/rear gunner, Unteroffizier Ernst Elfner, became prisoners of war.”\n\nIt was taken to Vultee Aircraft Inc. for engineering study, and there is some evidence it was sent to Martin and perhaps other manufacturers as well. Between the time it was shot down and shipped to America on the Montanan it was put on display on one or more London streets, and later in Hendon Park, northwest London.\n\nMontanan’s next to last voyage departed Baltimore around May 15th, 1942. That voyage departed Bombay September 19th, 1942, Cape Town October 13th, Trinidad November 14th and arrived in New York on November 25th, 1942. This period was the peak of German U-Boat successes during the war.\n\nOne interesting thing that the crew list reveals is that Montanan was already armed by the time they left Baltimore, which was very early for many of these older vessels. At the end of the crew list they penciled in the names of twelve Navy Armed Guard.\n\nOnly seven of her Merchant Mariner crew stayed with Montanan for her next, and what would be her last voyage. These men were:\n\nMaster McGahan\n\nGraham Griffiths, who advanced from 2nd Mate to Chief Mate\n\nGeorge Bailey, who advanced from Jr. 3rd Mate to 3rd Mate\n\nRadioman Kenneth Goss\n\nA.B. Anderes Thevik\n\nChief Engineer Wallace Tyler\n\nPurser Leonard Skilling\n\nThe entire Navy Armed Guard complement was exchanged for a larger group of 28 men, which I will detail later.\n\nMontanan was lucky enough to survive the disastrous year of 1942 and at the end of December Montanan was in Baltimore, MD. Rather than head east across the Atlantic as per the previous voyage, they headed down the U.S. East Coast, west (as part of convoy GZ20 – Guantanamo to Cristobal) through the Panama Canal to California, and then westward across the Pacific to Australia.\n\nOn March 15th, 1943, the same day the U.S. Southwest Pacific Force became the U.S. 7th Fleet, the Montanan arrived in Brisbane, Australia and was “check-ranged”.\n\nOn March 16th, 1943 McGahan made a withdrawal of $700 from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, at Perth near Freemantle.\n\nMontanan departed Freemantle, Western Australia on March 20th, 1943 as part of the small convoy OW3 which also consisted of:\n\nS.S. Harrison Gray Otis – a new American Liberty Ship on her maiden voyage, she was also operated by American-Hawaiian SS Co. She would be damaged by a magnetic limpet mine attached by an Italian frogman in August near Gibraltar and later scrapped.\n\nM/V Lowlander – an older former Italian steamer seized in the US after Pearl Harbor and given to the British under Lend-Lease who operated her under the Port Line. She survived the war and was scrapped in 1961.\n\nS.S. Winslow Homer – a new American Liberty ship on her maiden voyage, she was operated by Agwilines, Inc. She survived war and was scrapped in 1972.\n\nS.S. Zane Grey – a new American Liberty ship on her maiden voyage, she was operated by Isthmian Steamship Co. She also survived the war and was scuttled off the coast of North Carolina in 1974.\n\nThey were initially escorted by the Royal Australian Navy light cruiser HMAS Adelaide to position 20° 24’ S, 93° 42’ E, about 500 miles south southwest of the Cocos Islands, where escort duties passed to the Royal Navy’s Armed Merchant Cruiser HMS Worcestershire (F 29).\n\nThey arrived safely in Colombo, Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka) on April 2nd. It is unclear when Montanan departed Colombo, but she appears to have been bound for Bandar Shahpur, Iran.\n\nThe Montanan reportedly went down in less than eight minutes. Radio Operator Ken Goss was unable to get a distress signal off.\n\nIt is remarkable that they were able to get all four boats away in that amount of time, and lucky that the hit was forward and none of the boats were damaged in the attack. It is assumed that the boats were already swung out and ready for lowering.\n\nAfter the Montanan went down the crew rowed around amongst the wreckage looking for any other survivors. The muster revealed four men were missing.\n\nSecond Mate Frank Munkasey’s boat found Master McGahan’s body floating within a few hours and retrieved it. According to his report, artificial respiration was attempted but unsuccessful. They assumed the captain died from shock and exposure. They collected his personal papers and then buried him at sea.\n\nMaster McGahan’s papers included:\n\nSeaman Passport [number redacted] issued at Washington on June 23rd, 1942.\n\nMaster’s License [number redacted] issued to Charles H. McGahan at New York on May 22nd, 1941.\n\nSocial Security Card [number redacted] issued September 26th, 1939.\n\nDraft registration certificate, Local No. 140, Brooklyn, NY April 25th, 1942.\n\nUnited States Coast Guard identification card [number redacted] issued at Baltimore on May 11th, 1942.\n\nAddress card showing his address as 1223 Avenue P, Brooklyn, NY, telephone Dewey 9.5702.\n\nLetter of Credit from the National City Bank of New York, dated January 7th, 1943, in the sum of $14,000 [around $190,000 in 2013] – one withdrawal shown on March 16th, 1943 of $700, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, at Perth.\n\nLetter of Identification for above Letter of Credit dated January 7th, 1943.\n\nOne pocket memo book of addresses.\n\nSlop chest account (reg. no. 219) Connor Trading Company, Baltimore, MD December 31st, 1942, corrected bill no. 4419 for cigarettes and tobacco, in the sum of $924.\n\nSlop chest account – Clothing from Aaron M. Cohen, 516 South Broadway, Baltimore, MD, December 28th, 1942 – 3 pages ( No. 1 $104.55; No. 2 $537.82; No. 3 $431.40).\n\nOne letter (secret) No. C.5/254 issued by Naval Staff office, Freemantle, Western Australia on March 19th, 1943, addressed to the captain of the S.S. Montanan.\n\nCopy of letter from United States Coast Guard, 42 Broadway, NY dated January 13th, 1943, file no. MIN. V 64306.\n\nThe lifeboats appear to have been separated soon after. It’s not clear if this was due to the weather, or if the officers in charge in each boat deliberately decided to go their separate ways.\n\nBoat No. 2 was found by the fishing dhow Naranpasha on Saturday, June 5th, about 48 hours after the sinking. As was typical, the dhow didn’t have any radio equipment, so the allies still had no idea they had lost a vessel or had a Japanese submarine operating in their waters. No location is known for this rescue, but it assumed the lifeboat had been blown deeper into the Arabian Sea as the dhow made for India rather than Masirah.\n\nThe first indication the allies had that anything was wrong was a possible submarine sighting reported by some US Army Air Corps DC-3 Dakotas being transported to the China, India, Burma (CIB) theater on June 7th, four days after the sinking. The event was recorded in No. 244 Squadron’s Summary of Events:\n\n“7.6.43, 0800, Signal received from Masirah that submarine sighted 10 miles N.E. of island by 2 American Aircraft at 0530 hours.” Keep in mind No. 244 had a ground stop in effect while they investigated their engine failures. Then, one hour later: “0900, W/O Daenke, F/Sgt. Tregonning, Sgt. Kelly proceeded to Masirah for operational duties in view of submarine scare.” The Bisley wasn’t identified but this crew usually took BA.488.\n\nNo. 212 Squadron was busy escorting convoy BP.82 (Bombay to Bandar Abbas), but also received notification of a possible submarine and at 0436 on June 8th Catalina FP.175 “B” took off and set course “ZYUZ 4905” to carry out a square search pattern for a U-boat. The crew consisted of:\n\nSgt. J. Gallagher. (Captain).\n\nP/O A.D.H. Gray. (2nd Pilot).\n\nF/O G. E. Cooper. (Navigator)\n\nSgt. A. Davies.\n\nSgt. M. Lowe.\n\nSgt. B. Rees.\n\nSgt. J. McKay.\n\nSgt. J. Spry.\n\nSgt. H. Price.\n\nSgt. Gallagher was John Edward Gallagher, and according to William Barrie, was known simply as \"Johnny Gallagher\". Barrie also recalled Gallagher was the son of the MP for Glasgow, Scotland and one of the best young pilots in the squadron. He did his Catalina flight training at NAS Pensacola, FL, and was one of 4,000 British and Commonwealth aviators trained there.\n\nThe flight of FP.175 did not go as well as planned for its crew, but would be key in the rescue of Montanan’s survivors.\n\nAccording to the squadron’s Record of Events:\n\n“Aircraft was carried south of track by strong westerly wind. 1210 [time, 7.5 hours after they took off from Korangi Creek] VPHH 1515 [map grid location] a smoke float was sighted and a lifeboat containing 14 persons close by. 1230 Signal to Base requesting permission to land passed via Masirah. 1310 [40 minutes later] No reply from Korangi. Masirah signaled asking for position and clarification of message [no doubt puzzled by a report of survivors]. Captain decided to land to pick up occupants of lifeboat. All safety precautions were taken and fully stalled landing made. A swell was running and as aircraft slowed up swell broke over nose and crushed it. The pilot attempted to take off but inrush of water too powerful. Captain gave order to abandon aircraft leaving by the forward hatch with the second pilot. The remainder of the crew launched dinghies and left by blisters. The aircraft was completely submerged except for the tail in 3 minutes and finally sank 40 minutes later. The crew were picked up by the lifeboat.”\n\nSince nothing more was heard from FP.175 and they failed to return on schedule, the Naval authorities were notified. No. 244’s Summary of Events does not specifically mention it, but No. 212’s noted that:\n\n“Bisley’s of No. 244 Squadron searched during evening but sighted nothing.”\n\nIt obviously didn’t work out as well as they hoped, but at least now the allies knew they were looking for merchant seamen survivors (although not from which ship just yet), had a downed aircrew to rescue as well and confirmation that in all likelihood they had a real enemy submarine in their backyard. There had not been an enemy submarine attack in this area for 8 months (ironically it was I-27 then as well), and it must have come as quite a shock.\n\nBoth squadrons rapidly began committing more resources to the effort. To complicate matters, the British had a rather large convoy WS.29 en route from South Africa. It had broken up near Aden into smaller A, B, & C groups, portions of which were heading north to where all the action was, including the large liner Athlone Castle, which would later have a role in the saga. No. 212 focused on protecting these vessels.\n\nAt 1400 on the 9th 244’s Summary of Events noted:\n\n“Signal received from Masirah that Bisley BA.656 sighted and made attack on a 200’ submarine. Unfortunately depth charges did not leave aircraft. Later signal disclosed that same aircraft had been ditch near Um Rasas [near No.212’s flying boat base]. P/O Tulley being the pilot. Reason being that port engine took fire and aircraft could not maintain height on one engine.”\n\nWith Pilot Officer Tulley in BA.656 were his navigator F/Sgt. Stone [no relation] and gunner F/Sgt. Thomas. Fortunately, all three men survived the ditching. I attempted to confirm the Japanese perspective on this attack, but so far no luck.\n\nAt 0212 on June 10th No. 191 squadron entered the mix and Catalina FP.315 “Y” with Squadron Leader A. Brown and crew took off on search for missing Catalina FP.175. As per the squadron’s report;\n\n“Aircraft was diverted to search for U-Boat attacked by Bisley of No. 244 Squadron, S.E. of Masirah. Signal received from Masirah that U.S.A.A.F., D.C.3 had sighted lifeboat towing two rafts, 50 miles S.W. of Masirah and believed crew of FP.175 aboard. Y/191 sighted lifeboat and rafts during evening, dropped food and map and ascertained that crew of FP.175 on board. Y/191 landed Masirah 2010.”\n\nAt 0710 on June 10th No. 212’s Catalina FP.202 “D” piloted by G. Myers took off from Jiwani and set course for Ras al Hadd. At 1025 they received a message from base directing them to:\n\n“Cover position MKUZ 0623 down wind on route to Masirah.”\n\n\"1116 (location MKUZ 0623) investigated area nothing suspicious sighted set course Masirah. 1254 Cape Abu Rasas set course VPHB 5418. 1318 Commenced Square search 1326 sighted floating boxes investigated nothing sighted. 1330 message from Masirah lifeboat being towed to Ras Hilf by dhow. 1332 signaled Ras Hilf are dinghies O.K. 1340 (location VPQR 1748) set course Ras Hilf. 1400 (location ZYHB 1722) circled dhow with lifeboat in tow. 1440 set course Ras Hilf. 1500 message from Masirah “Survivors landed suggest continue U-boat hunt”. 1510 (location ZYHB 1729) over dhow towing two rubber dinghies signaled to Ras Hilf giving position. 1542 (location VPHB 5418) commenced square search visibility 5 miles. 1553 message from Base “Continue sortie until PLE return Jiwani. Refuel and return to Base [Korangi Creek].\"\n\nIt's clear from these communications that the authorities on Masirah still had no idea of the scope of the event. Several other Catalinas were searching as well and reported the following:\n\nFP.201 “J” flown by Squadron Leader A.F. Johnson –\n\n“2009 landfall 15 miles North of Masirah commenced search for survivors. 2030 (location ZYHB 1938) over survivors – 1 lifeboat, 1 dinghy on shore. 1 dinghy being towed by dhow. 2128 Waterbourne [landed] Masirah.”\n\nPerhaps from information from the lifeboat and dinghy that had reached shore the British finally knew the ship the Merchant survivors were from, and noted:\n\n“Information received from Masirah indicated that survivors sighted by FP. 175 were part of crew of American Hawian [sic] Co. S.S. MONTANAN torpedoed on June 3, 100 miles South of Masirah with loss of five lives. Survivors landed Masirah.”\n\nFP.234 ‘G” flown by Flight Lieutenant N.T. Marix, and in addition to normal flight crew was carrying Flight Lieutenant J. Wilson as Medical Officer noted –\n\n“0700 Cape Jidufah (location MKVZ 2035) sighted small dinghy requested position of lifeboat, request ignored. 0755 (location MKUZ 1247) sighted Merchant Vessel 600 tons course 225 6 knots identified itself as “KNUSDE”. 0925 (location VPQR 2544) commenced CLA search MLA 231 26 miles to starboard 16 miles to port 1 ½ miles visibility. 1050 (location VPHB 5418) commenced square search. Message to Ras Hilf “Please check last position of lifeboat and signal back in latitude and longitude.” 1400 message from Masirah Position 1958 N 3818 E on course Masirah, suggest search south coast and inland, 1540 landed Umm Rasas. 1555 Airbourne. 1613 Cape Abu [Rasas?]. 1642 sighted Catalina D/212 requested position. 1810 (location VPHB 5818) commenced square search message from Base position of Dinghy (location ZYHB 1729). 2015 (location ZYHB 1917) sighted survivors on Masirah Island. 2041 landed Umm Rasas.”\n\nBoat Nos. 1, 3 and 4 managed to reach Masirah Island on Thursday, June 10th. British Admiralty War Diaries for this period indicate one person from this group died in transit.\n\nThe next day at 1952, Catalina FP.315 piloted by No. 191 Squadron Leader A. Brown landed at Korangi Creek from Masirah carrying 4 members of FP.175’s crew and 5 survivors from the Montanan. About an hour later at 2045 FP.201 piloted by No. 212 Squadron Leader A.F. Johnson (DFC) landed carrying 5 members of FP.175’s crew and 10 survivors from the Montanan. The survivors were transported by ambulance to the nearby U.S. Military Hospital at Malir.\n\nIt is assumed that these 15 Montanan survivors were those in most urgent need of medical attention. The transport of the remaining 39 survivors from this group were not mentioned in the squadron’s records, so may have been transported to the main airport at Karachi by either USAAF DC3’s or a BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation) passenger version of the Vickers Wellington that was used in the area.\n\nIn the mean-time, the survivors from Boat No. 2 were transferred from the dhow Naranpasha to HMIS Baroda, a Basset Class Indian Navy Armed Trawler on Thursday, June 10th. It’s unclear how the two vessels found each other. Baroda had arrived in Bombay on May 31st and isn’t mention in Admiralty reports until June 20th while escorting a convoy (BM.54) from Bombay to Colombo. Locations are not noted, but it is assumed the transfer occurred much closer to Bombay than Masirah as according to British Admiralty War Diaries Baroda landed the eight survivors at Port Okha, India only one day later on Friday, June 11th. The Admiralty War Diaries went on to note that boat No. 2 originally had ten men, but unfortunately two died in transit. The survivors were interrogated in Bombay on Monday June 14th.\n\nThe combined 54 survivors that had originally landed at Masirah appear to have been flown from Karachi to Bombay where they were re-united with the 8 survivors from lifeboat No. 2 for transport back home on the British Union Castle liner Athlone Castle.\n\nWhen it was all said and done casualties included:\n\nFalco, Frank, age unknown, O.S from Brooklyn, NY.\n\nLademan, Jerome Emmett, 22, Signalman 3rd Class, USN AG from Milwaukee, WI\n\nLane, Hobert, Jr., age unknown, Seaman 1st Class, USN(R) AG from Peach Creek, WV\n\nMcGahan, Charles H., 64, Master from Brooklyn, NY\n\nPhillips, Luther Don, 30, Deck Engineer from Matoaca, VA\n\nSchroeder, Gustav Anton, 55, 2nd Cook from Philadelphia, PA\n\nTyler, Wallace M., 40, Chief Engineer from Alameda, CA\n\nTo date, I have not been able to locate any additional information on Frank Falco.\n\nSecond Cook Gustav Anton Schroeder was originally from Saint Gall, Switzerland, immigrated to America in 1911 and became a citizen in 1918. He left behind a wife, Carrie and son Wayne.\n\nThe two Navy Armed Guards, Lane and Lademan, were reported missing, presumed lost, and therefore were likely two of the original four (including Master McGahan) that were lost in the initial attack. They are listed on the “Tablets of the Missing” at the North Africa American Cemetery in Carthage, Tunisia. They were both posthumously awarded the Purple Heart.\n\nLuther Phillips joined the Merchant Marine immediately after Pearl Harbor. He was married to Pearl Audrey Pottage and was memorialized along with 12 other men the tiny village lost during the war on a monument erected right after the war. He was lost just one month shy of his 31st birthday. One interesting detail about Phillips is that his date of death is listed as June 16th, not the 3rd when Montanan was lost. This could simply be an indicated that it took some time to formally declare him deceased, or could be an indication he survived the initial sinking and lifeboat voyages only to later succumb to his injuries in Milar or Bombay. This doesn’t quite add up, however, since all casualties were accounted for by the 11th; four missing from the initial attack, one lost in transit from the main group that reached Masirah, and two lost in transit from Lifeboat No. 2. Hopefully one day his family will find the site and be able to confirm.\n\nI profile Captain McGahan and Chief Engineer Tyler later in this article.\n\nThere were 36 Merchant Mariner survivors:\n\nAndrezeyewski, Stephen Alexander, 22, Wiper from Baltimore, MD\n\nBailey, George W., 28, 3rd Mate from San Francisco, CA\n\nBaker, Robert W., 34, Messman from New York City, NY\n\nCabellero, Anibel, 23, Messman from Ponce, PR\n\nCarrington, Clement H., 32, Messman from Brooklyn, NY\n\nCenteno, Max, 28, Messman from Brooklyn, NY\n\nChoi, Phillip. 29, 3rd Assistant Engineer from Philadelphia, PA\n\nCoakley, Daniel, 22, O.S. from Medway, MA\n\nConners, Harry P., 60, Chief Cook from Cumberland, KY\n\nDavisson, Frank L., 19, Oiler from Clarksburg, WV\n\nEisengraeber, Robert D., 26, O.S. from Minneapolis, MN\n\nEpps, Warner Malyord, 25, Messman from Baltimore, MD\n\nEstrella, Jose Del, 29, Wiper from Aja Jardo, PR\n\nFinn, Elmer David, 39, Wiper from Baltimore, MD\n\nGoss, Kenneth Edward, 34, Radio Operator from Chicago, IL\n\nGriffiths, Graham, 27, Chief Mate from Clifton Heights, PA\n\nHoffmann, Herman, 24, 4th Assistant Engineer from Berlin, NJ\n\nHovde, Arne Wessel, 23, A.B. from Baltimore, MD\n\nLambert, Earl Newton, 25, A.B. from Philadelphia, PA\n\nLargent, James Guy, 54, Oiler from Morgentown, VA\n\nLazer, Jacob J., 23, Fireman from Hartford, CT\n\nMann, Chalmers, 41, Engine Dept. from San Francisco, CA\n\nMitchell, Roy Clifford, 36, A.B. from Baltimore, MD\n\nMorris, James D., 22, Fireman from Detroit, MI\n\nMunkasey, Frank, 32, 2nd Mate from New Brunswick, NJ\n\nNuguid, William Dungo, 45, Steward from Tucson, AZ\n\nNungezer, Hermann Timothy, 24, Bos'n from Jacksonville, FL\n\nParks, William L., 22, Deck Dept. from Brunswick, GA\n\nPauley, Ronald Cebert, 28, A.B. from Baltimore, MD\n\nRiley, Norman Benton, 51, 2nd Assistant Engineer from Ypsilanti, MI\n\nSkilling, Leonard B., 42, Purser from Cutati, CA\n\nSmith, Robert Cecil, 42, 3rd Cook from Cumberland, KY\n\nSuchan, Wensel John, 22, Fireman from Pittsburgh, PA\n\nThevik, Anders, 42, A.B. from Minneapolis, MN\n\nWheeler, Paul Wesley, 46, 1st Assistant Engineer from New York City, NY\n\nWills, William Michael, 30, Oiler from N Braddock Heights, PA\n\nRegular visitors to the sight might recognize Chief Mate Graham Griffiths name. He had already survived the Texan’s sinking in March of 1942 while acting and 2nd Mate. He was one of several American-Hawaiian officers I’ve found to date that survived multiple sinkings, and along with Earl Manning (Alaskan, Cape San Juan) was one of two men I’ve found that survived both a German U-boat attack and a Japanese submarine attack.\n\nSecond Mate Frank Munkasey had transferred from the Illinoian in October. After their return, Munkasey became Chief Mate on the American-Hawaiian liberty ship John Harvard.\n\nIn addition to the Merchant Mariners, there were 26 U.S. Navy Armed Guard survivors:\n\nKilborne, S.W., Lt.\n\nArlington, E.L., G/M\n\nCaruso, A.G., B/M\n\nAnton, C.G., Seaman\n\nBalvin, J.O., Seaman\n\nElkins, K.P., Seaman\n\nGrays, M.L., Seaman\n\nHadley, S.R., Seaman\n\nHandy, Robert N., Seaman\n\nHeadle, Boyd Charter, Seaman\n\nHautseche, A.W., Seaman\n\nHadstate, C. Jr., Seaman\n\nHalliday, J.F., Seaman\n\nHeiken, R.B., Seaman\n\nKevotkos, C., Seaman\n\nLouvar, R.P., G/M\n\nMcGee, C.B., Seaman\n\nNolan, L.E., Seaman\n\nSchmidt, R.D., Seaman\n\nSkelton, R., Seaman\n\nStokes, J.F., Seaman\n\nSmith, J.D., Seaman\n\nTysinger, F.C., W/T\n\nWells, J., Seaman\n\nWhited, A., Seaman\n\nWiggington, L.W., G/M\n\nAs mentioned previously, the survivors were consolidated in Bombay for transport home.\n\nFort Mumford is often cited as an example of one of Fukumura’s atrocities, where he is alleged to have machine-gunned the survivors, only one of whom survived. This was one of Fort Mumford’s seaman gunners named Horace Bailey. I was curious and did some digging myself, and to date I can find no evidence that Fukumura murdered the survivors, only innuendo.\n\nWhile it’s true that Mr. Bailey was the sole survivor, there are three other factors that may explain the high loss of life:\n\nAccording to Fort Mumford’s ship movement card at the British National Archives, the vessel was carrying ammunition along with aircraft and landing craft as deck cargo.\n\nThe vessel sank within minutes (always a cause of high casualties) according to Bailey, and according to the British Admiralty War Diary for this period he: “saw no sign of his ship, enemy craft or survivors”.\n\nNo distress signal was sent and no one knew to look for survivors until she was reported overdue on April 13th, more than three weeks after the sinking, and Bailey’s account would not be known until after his rescuers arrived in Mikindani on May 6th, three weeks after that.\n\nBailey’s experience is detailed in the book ‘The Quiet Heroes – British Merchant Seamen at War’ by Bernard Edwards (2005, ISIS Large Print Books, ISBN 075319905X, 9780753199053) in Chapter 18 – ‘The Lone Survivor’.\n\nAccording to Edward’s book, Bailey was in his bunk when the torpedo hit during the watch changeover at 8:00pm when there would be a large number of crew on their way to or from their stations. He saw a huge flash of light through the port hole in his quarters and was thrown from his bunk by the explosion(s). He scrambled through a hatch up to the after deck and what he found there was utter devastation.\n\nHe was all alone. His way to the boat deck was blocked by a jumble of smashed aircraft parts and crates that had been on deck. To me this is another indication that the explosives they had been carrying had gone off. Typically a torpedo striking below the waterline would not do that much damage to the deck cargo unless the cargo was directly above the blast, which would in turn destroy the deck as well.\n\nHe worked his way aft through the debris looking for a raft, which he could not find. He made for the rail, only then realizing he had forgotten his life jacket in his quarters. Just as he climbed over the rail and prepared himself to jump the ship began to roll over and take its final plunge, causing him to lose his grip and fall outwards. At first he was dragged down with the ship but then broke free and shot to the surface. He found a piece of wreckage and climbed on top. He stood up and peered through the darkness, trying to spot any other survivors. He called out but there was no answer. Awhile later he thought he heard voices and again call out. Still no answer. At daybreak, no one was seen, only debris.\n\nHe was in quite a predicament. He had no food, no water, and had several deep cuts in his legs and feet from crawling through the mangled deck cargo. He cleaned his wounds as best he could with salt water and packed them algae. For four days he floated under the scorching sun and pondered his fate. On the fourth day he had some relief from a passing rain shower, collecting the rain water in a small container he had salvaged the first night.\n\nOn the fifth day, March 25th, he was rescued by an Indian dhow (no. 443) traveling from the Malabar Coast to Mikindani, Tanganyika in East Africa. The crew of nine tended to his injured leg, by this time black with gangrene. His leg was saved and he was able to walk ashore unassisted by the time they reached Mikindani on May 6th.\n\nBailey makes no mention of machinegun fire in his account. Author Edwards leaves the door open to the possibility, but provides no reason other than “the Japanese were notorious for such things”. Edwards also does not cite his source for the detailed account.\n\nOn March 24th, 1943 I-27 made another failed attack, this time on an unidentified tanker northwest of the Chagos Archipelago.\n\nFukumura and I-27 returned to their base at Penang on April 9th, 1943 after 42 days at sea with one enemy ship to their credit. Not a great start, however their next patrol would more than make up for it.\n\nSecond War Patrol\n\nOn May 1st, 1943 the I-27 departed their base at Penang on the second war patrol with Fukumura in command.\n\nAt 0556 on May 7th at the eastern entrance to the One and Half Degree Channel, Fukumura torpedoed the Dutch motor vessel Berakit en route from Colombo to Durban.\n\nCorpses are still being found washed up on shore.”\n\n“H.M.S. Whaler Atmoshere arrived on the evening of the 29th June and her Commander, Lt.-Commander Falwasser, R.N.R., conducted an examination of the wreck with the Political Agent and the Dahpu’s Commander on the morning of the 30th June. By that time the whole length of the ship had settled on the harbour bed, and only her forecastle, bridge deck, foremast, and funnel are now showing over water.”\n\n“The force of the explosion was such that debris was hurled into the Agency Tennis Court behind the Agency and a piece of it broke the verandah of the Treasury Officer’s house on the sea front. The ship was anchored at only 2-3/4 cables length from the Agency.”\n\n“S.S. Dahpu was a Norwegian ship owned by Messrs. Wallem & Co., of Bergen and requisitioned by the Royal Norwegian Government on the outbreak of War and held by the Master on its behalf. Separate reports have been submitted.”\n\n“It has now been established that S.S. Dahpu was torpedoed and the propellor [sic] of the torpedo has been found by the diving party [Note: on July 5th]. One of the three wounded Indian crew has died of his injuries. Messrs. Gray Mackenzie are trying to salvage as much as possible from the wreck.”\n\nAccording to warsailors.com;\n\n“The tail of a 21\" torpedo with many Japanese characters and with the number 390 inscribed in several places was later recovered in Muscat harbour. The torpedo was apparently similar to German ones, with twin propellers double the size of British propellers. It had a twin cylinder engine. The recovered parts were dispatched to Kilindini for investigation.”\n\nSee here for more information.\n\nUpon hearing the news of Dah Puh's loss in Muscat harbor, No. 244 Squadron dispatched Bisley BA.524 with Sgt. Nash (Pilot), Sgt. Keir (Navigator) and Sgt. Sublet (Gunner) to search Muscat and points north, apparently to no avail. No. 212 Squadron appears to have dispatched Catalina FP.201 “J” on an Anti-submarine Patrol that morning as well with:\n\nFSgt. O’Meara. (Captain).\n\nSgt. S. Ives. (2nd Pilot).\n\nSgt. H. Carr (3rd Pilot).\n\nW/O. D.W. Penn. (Navigator)\n\nSgt. S. Sharman.\n\nSgt. L. Trowbridge.\n\nSgt. J. Pate.\n\nSgt. J. Scott.\n\nSgt. A. Bassett.\n\nSgt. R. Bradbury.\n\nAlso, with no sightings.\n\nAbout a week later, in the early morning hours of July 5th, 1943 Fukumura boldly attacks the large (for the theater) convoy PA-44, which consisted of:\n\nSS Alcoa Prospector, American C1-B cargo ship operated by Alcoa Steamship, Co.\n\nMV British Diligence, British Tanker operated by the British Tanker Co., Ltd.\n\nSS Capsa, British Tanker operated by Shell Tankers, U.K.\n\nSS Empire Coral, British Tanker operated by the Eagle Tanker Company, Ltd.\n\nSS Esso Baytown, American Tanker operated by ESSO Shipping Co.\n\nSS Esso Charleston, American Tanker operated by ESSO Shipping Co.\n\nSS Gazana, British passenger/cargo vessel operated by the British India Steam Navigation Co., Ltd.\n\nSS George E. Badger, American EC2-S-C1 Liberty Ship operated by Grace Line, Inc.\n\nMS Hermion, Norwegian cargo ship operated by Orient Steam Navigation Co., Ltd.\n\nSS John Fitch, American EC2-S-C1 Liberty Ship operated by Weyerhaeuser Steamship Co.\n\nMacuba, tanker owned by NV Petroleum Maats. “La Carona”. This was the Dutch Shipping arm of Shell (Anglo-Saxon was the British arm) .\n\nMV Pan Gothia, Swedish Tanker operated by Rederi A/B Pagota\n\nMV Pegasus, Swedish Tanker operated by Rederi-A/B Transoil (Sunk by U-197 on July 24th)\n\nThey had departed Khasab Bay, Oman on Sunday, July 4th and were en route to their first stop in Aden, which the survivors reached on Tuesday, July 15th. Most of the vessels had departed Abadan, Iran on July 2nd, including Alcoa Prospector.\n\nThe convoy was escorted by the Bathurst class corvette HMIS Bengal (J-243) and the Bangor Class minesweeper HMIS Orissa (J-200). The attack likely occurred shortly before No. 244 squadron arrived for air escort, typically at dawn.\n\nAccording to Moore, the attack on Alcoa Prospector happened as follows;\n\n“At 0510GCT, a torpedo struck the starboard side of the #4 hold below the water line. The explosion ruptured the shaft alley and blew holes in the bulkhead between #4 hold and the engine room flooding the engine room. The main engines were stopped as the ship settled by the stern. By July 9th, the ship had drifted to 25-40 North/57-38 East. HMIS Bengal (J-243) attempted to tow the ship to keep her from going aground but was unsuccessful. The ship anchored at 1000 on July 9. At 1400, the tugs Tavana and Zurmand, owned by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, towed the ship to Bandar Abbas where she anchored on July 10.”\n\n“The ship was abandoned about 5 minutes after the attack by all hands in 2 lifeboats, and 4 rafts, with the exception of the Armed Guard officer and 10 of his men. The men in the boats and rafts were picked up immediately by the Bengal. On July 6 at1230, the Navy officer, 13 of his men, 3 ship’s officers, and two seamen reboarded the ship. The Master [Ernest Henke] returned aboard at 0500 on July 7. After the ship was anchored at Bandar Abbas, the remainder of the crew returned aboard.”\n\nAs noted, after the attack Bengal stayed with the Alcoa Prospector and the Orissa continued on to Aden with the rest of the convoy. It’s not clear if either escort attempted to counterattack the I-27.\n\nThe Alcoa Prospector was a C1-B built by Bethlehem Steel Co., Staten Island, NY. She was originally laid down as Cape Ann, but was delivered to Alcoa Steamship Co., Inc. as Alcoa Prospector on March 25th, 1941. After the attack, temporary repairs were made in Bandar Abbas, but she would not serve for the remainder of the war. She was towed to Karachi on February of 1944, then on to Bombay by the Liberty Ship John A. Poor. In October of 1945 she finally arrived back in the United States, but her damage was so extensive it was estimated it would take $616,000.00 and 60 days to repair her. As she originally cost $1,959,454.00 the repairs were nearly one third of her value, and with the war over and a glut of vessels available it was decided to scrap her, which did not occur until January of 1951.\n\nWith that many tankers in the convoy, Alcoa Prospector was likely not the intended target. With the escorts alerted and aircraft arriving, Fukumura was not able to press the attack. As it stood, it was an enormously successful patrol for the I-27 and Fukumura. Four vessels sunk and one damaged for a total of 18,176 tons and 6,797 tons respectively. On par with some U-boat commanders.\n\nFukumura would later (on November 20th, 1943) receive a letter of commendation for this patrol from the Commander in Chief, Imperial Japanese Navy Combined Fleet, Admiral Mineichi Koga.\n\nThey returned to their base at Penang, Malaysia on July 14th, 1943, after 74 days at sea. By the time they got there, Japanese Radio Intelligence had indentified Montanan as “Montana” from intercepts.\n\nCaptain Marten S. Kruisinga\n\nAccording to historian Sander Kingsepp;\n\n“Among the I-27 officers, who participated in that patrol the best known one was her torpedo officer, Lieutenant (later Commander) Koichiro Suwa (Etajima class 64/graduated 23 Mar 1937). Suwa became the Commanding Officer of I-166 in 1944 and survived her sinking by the British HMS Telemachus. Later on he was appointed the CO of RO-55, lost in 1945.”\n\nKingsepp also informed me that the Radio/Code officer aboard the I-27, named Kikuyoshi Yoshida, wrote a memoir of his wartime experiences entitled; Igō dai 27 sensuikan no katsuyaku : angō-chō no sensuikan senki (Submarine I-27 in action: memoirs of a submarine encryption officer), 1995, Hatsubai Seiunsha Publisher, ISBN-10: 4795264198, ISBN-13: 978-4795264199. Unfortunately, the book is currently only available in Japanese, but Kingsepp has kindly translated portions that relate to this patrol.\n\nAccording to Kingsepp, the book also does;\n\n“mention Master Kruisinga of the Berakit though; according to its author, the latter was quite a character. The submariners were sympathetic to his plight and actually attempted to provide him with better food during the rest of the cruise”.\n\nThe hospitality would end soon after their arrival in Penang. Captain Kruisinga was transported to a secret interrogation camp on the Japanese mainland run by the Imperial Japanese Navy called Ōfuna. It was located in Kamakura, outside Yokohama, Japan. Official POW’s were managed by the Imperial Army. This was the only camp run by the Imperial Navy and it was not reported to The International Red Cross. Although it was an interrogation center, it was officially called “The Navy Yokosuka Guard Unit Ueki Detachment.\" as a cover. Here prisoners, mainly officers, were kept “off the grid” so to speak, and many were tortured for information they may have possessed. As a ship’s captain, Kruisinga may have had information on routings, codes and procedures the Japanese would have been interested in.\n\nMost accounts of Ōfuna are pretty terrible and from American military prisoners that arrived just after Kruisinga had left. The facility was rather small and from its opening on April 6th, 1942 to the camp’s liberation on August 21st, 1945 only 1,000 prisoners were known to have been processed through there. Prisoners were kept in solitary confinement in 4ft x 8ft cells and there was strict no-speaking policy. Violations were met with severe beatings. In good weather they were allowed out to “exercise”, but were fed a diet estimated at 500 calories per day, mainly consisting of nothing more than a ball of white rice. You can read more about Ōfuna here, here and here.\n\nAfter the war, Ōfuna’s Commander, Yokura Sashizo, was tried and convicted of war crimes and sentenced to 25 years hard labor.\n\nOn January 24th, 1944 Kruisinga was handed over to the Army and officially became a Prisoner of War at camp Tokyo 8-D (No.8 Dispatched camp - a former name of Tokyo No.9 Branch camp). This was a labor camp in Ashio, Japan and the POW’s were forced to work in a copper mine. Ashio is in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, approximately 87 miles north of Tokyo in a mountainous region. It is now part of the city of Nikkō.\n\nUnfortunately, one month after his arrival at Ashio, Kruisinga died of catarrhal pneumonia on February 25th, 1944. This was just 4 days after his 43rd birthday, and less than 10 months after his capture. His remains were cremated but it is not clear if they were buried.\n\nHe was one of 15 Dutch POWs that died from pneumonia that winter alone, and apparently the only civilian. He was likely already in a very weakened condition from months of abuse at Ōfuna, and still wearing what was left of his same tropic weight uniform he had on when he abandoned ship. He would not have been provided with winter clothing. Temperatures at Ashio for January-February range from a high of 31° F during the day to low of 17° F at night. You can read more about Ashio here and here.\n\nKruisinga left behind a wife, Teena (neé Fenenga, 1901 - ?) whom he married in 1939 and daughter, Nellie.\n\nMarten Seis Kruisinga was born in Rotterdam, Holland on February 21st, 1901. He was the only son of Marten S.G. Kruisinga (1868 – 1936) and Jeanette Krusinga neé Coerkamp (1870 – 1913). He had a younger sister, Jacoba Kruisinga (1902 - ?).\n\nHis Merchant Mariner career appears to have begun at the end of World War I. Below is a partial list of sailings I was able to assemble:\n\nUnfortunately, Larchbank sank in less than 2 minutes, resulting in a high loss of life. 40 sailors including her Master, William A. McCracken and 6 gunners are lost. See here for a list of her Merchant seamen casualties.19 sailors and 4 gunners were rescued by the British SS Tahania and the American SS Panama and were landed at Ceylon. Note: some sources state the Panaman (American-Hawaiian SS Co.) rather than Panama took part in the rescue, however Panaman appears to have been occupied in convoy duty in the North Atlantic during this time period.\n\nAfter a patrol of just 26 days, I-27 arrived back in Penang on September 24th, 1943. For this patrol Fukumura received credit for damaging the 7,176 ton Lyman Stewart (“damaging” is a bit of a stretch), sinking the 5,151 ton Larchbank plus the bonus of the two MTB’s at 32 tons apiece, although apparently not the eight amphibious craft.\n\nIt is unclear why the patrol was so short, but the I-27 may have had some mechanical issues as I-27 went to Singapore for another overhaul. They arrived back in Penang on October 11th, 1943.\n\nFourth War Patrol\n\nI-27 departed Penang on October 19th 1943 to raid enemy shipping in the Gulf of Aden, which was the first time they had ventured that far west.\n\nBetween October 30th and 31st they reconnoitered the port of Al Mukalla and the anchorage at Maqatin al Kabir northeast of the main British port of Aden, Yemen.\n\nOn November 1st, 1943 Lt. Commander Fukumura was promoted to Commander.\n\nBy November 10th 1943 I-27 had worked their way down to entrance to the Red Sea where they torpedoed the 7,219-ton British SAM-class Liberty ship Sambo (Master J.D. Smith). She was on her maiden voyage from Iquique, Peru, to Suez with nitrate and general cargo. SAM technically stood for \"Superstructure Aft of Midships\", however some historians suspect it was more than coincidence that the ships were provide by \"Uncle Sam\". Sambo was originally launched as Edwin Joseph O'Hara but delivered August 12th, 1943 as Sambo for the MOWT (Ministry of War Transport) under the 'Lend-Lease' program. She was operated by Cunard White Star, Ltd.\n\nAccording to ‘Liberty: The Ships That Won the War’ by Peter Elphick (2006, Naval Institute Press, ISBN-10: 1591144515);\n\n“Two successive explosions came in the early afternoon, one each in Nos. 4 and 5 holds. After that there was a smaller third explosion right aft, presumably as the after magazine went up. Then, within a space of five minutes, the ship blew up and sank, again probably aided by the nitrite cargo which is not the safest commodity to carry around. Only one boat got away, and after picking up men who had been blown off the ship into the water, it had thirty-five souls on board. All nine gunners, the ship’s carpenter and two engine-room hands were missing and believed killed in the explosion. The survivors were picked up before dark by the Norwegian Helgøy. It was Captain Smith’s considered opinion, one which was supported by other members of the crew, that the initial explosions were caused by a mine rather than a torpedo as they appeared to be under the ship rather than on the side. The Naval Staff Officer at Aden ventured the opinion that the mine may have drifted away from the British minefield off Perim [sic], the edge of which was only ten miles from the scene.”\n\nAs noted, three sailors and nine gunners were lost, and 34 sailors and one gunner were rescued by the Norwegian freighter MS Helgøy, sailing independently from Suez to Aden to join convoy AKD 6.\n\nAs this was I-27’s first attack, the opinion of Sambo’s Master Smith initially caused some confusion amongst the British authorities as to whether Sambo had struck a mine or been torpedoed. On the 13th they noted\n\n“Evidence that this was a mine is far from conclusive and I am reluctant to remove sweepers from their present A/S escort duties while submarines are known to be operating in Gulf of Aden. Suggest vicinity of sinking be declared a dangerous area until sweepers are available to investigate your 121830 (re sweepers to skim vicinity in which SAMBO is alleged to have been mined) refers. (Commander in Chief, Eastern Forces 130802Z to Commander in Chief Levant, (R) Com. Aden, F.O.R.S.C.A., Commander in Chief Mediterranean.)”\n\nI-27 temporarily withdrew from the area and on November 18th torpedoed another British SAM-class Liberty ship, the Sambridge off the north coast of British Somaliland some 300 miles east southeast of the previous attack.Sambridge was also on her maiden voyage, although on a leg from Colombo to Aden with 365 tons of general cargo and 1,000 tons of sand ballast. Sambridge was originally launched as John E. Wilkie but delivered July 20th, 1943 as Sambridge for the MOWT (Ministry of War Transport) under the 'Lend-Lease' program. She was operated by T. & J. Brocklebank, Ltd.\n\nAccording to Elphick’s book;\n\n“Sambridge managed by T. & J. Brocklebank and commanded by Captain A.S. Bain, was making for Aden from Bombay. Torpedo nets were not streamed as they had previously been damaged in bad weather. It was early evening when the Japanese submarine I-27, Commander Fukumura Toshaiki, fired two torpedoes at the ship, the first passing astern, the second exploding in the engine-room killing the Second and Fourth Engineers and two hands. The vessel caught fire and in under two minutes the midships section was burning fiercely. Captain Bain later reported that ‘No. 4 boat was lowered without my orders and had pulled off with only nine members in it.’ With his ship now well ablaze, Bain ordered abandon ship.”\n\n“His report goes on:\n\n‘I got into No. 2 lifeboat and ordered it lowered, intending to remain alongside taking only as many of the crew with as I thought safe, as the boat had a large quantity of water in it. I instructed the Chief Officer and those remaining on board to take to the rafts, adding that I would take them in tow. The boat drifted away from the ship towards the stern. All 4 rafts were successfully released and by 1900 hours . . . everyone was clear of the vessel’.’\n\n“On his own admission, then, Bain had broken the unwritten but golden rule, that the captain should always be last to leave a sinking ship (unless of course, there are special reasons making that impossible, which manifestly was not so in this case).”\n\n“Some men had been blown into the water by the blast and were picked up, several of them suffering from severe burns. Captain Bain went on:\n\n‘Saw light which we thought was No. 4 boat and headed towards it, but saw wake of submarine heading this way. Ship suddenly exploded and sank.’”\n\n‘Submarine surfaced and closed and ordered me alongside. I obeyed . . . at the same time instructing my crew to deny all knowledge of Captain’s whereabouts if questioned. [Author’s note. Nothing wrong with that, it was standard procedure.]’\n\n‘In broken English a Japanese asked for Master, Chief Officer and Radio Officer. We replied, they had gone down with the ship. [Again, standard procedure].’\n\n‘Whilst being questioned our lifeboat washed up on to sub causing it to swamp and throwing out some of the gear including several oars. I ordered painter cut, which did not please the Japanese who ordered us along their lee side. Whilst doing this I conferred with the Second Officer and we decided that it looked as though someone would have to board the sub. Having denied all knowledge of the Master and Chief Officer we could not suddenly produce them: I said that failing all else I would go aboard, but my Second Officer bravely volunteered to do so if it became necessary.’\n\n“By that time the Japanese were scrutinizing everyone by torchlight [flashlight].”\n\n‘Greaser Byrne who was severely burned with the skin hanging off his back, volunteered to board sub. The Japs simply laughed at him and pushed him back. Japanese then asked Second Officer who he was and ordered him aboard. He was ordered to climb to the conning tower and as he did so he called out ‘Cheerio’, then disappeared from view.’\n\n‘Ordered to cast off and as we were pulling away towards the rafts I heard a burst of machine gun fire. Everyone crouched down, then a second burst was heard which I was afterwards told went over the rafts, one bullet hitting the raft on which the Chief Officer was lying. I do not think any injury was intended – but I consider it was an act of deliberate terrorism. Sub steamed away surfaced southerly.’\n\n“On the following morning the men in the Captain’s boat and the rafts were picked up by the SS Tarantia and subsequently landed at Aden. The men in No. 4 boat were later rescued by a British frigate and landed at Port Said, were Gunner Zappa, who was apparently in charge, was questioned as to why they had abandoned ship without orders. ‘No satisfactory answer was given’, said the author of the relevant report.”\n\n“As well as breaking the golden tradition, Captain Bain had permitted a more junior officer to be taken away a board a Japanese submarine in his stead, an act of cowardice for which there can be no excuse. It is of little wonder therefore, that at Aden after Bain had made his report to the King’s Harbour Master there, that the Navy did not want much to do with him. However, this reaction seems to have come as a surprise to Bain, for he made an official complaint about being treated with discourtesy. Bain also considered that the repatriation arrangements made for him and his crew were unsatisfactory – ‘no money for cigarettes or comforts’ and, ‘The King’s Harbour Master was always too busy to see me’. Greaser Michael Bryne, who had volunteered to board the submarine, died from his burns in hospital in Aden. In June 1944 he was given a Posthumous Commendation. Apprentice Hugh Jones who had manned an oar in the captain’s boat with a broken arm, was awarded the British Empire Medal on the same date. No one at the time knew what had happened to twenty-seven year-old Second Officer Henry Scurr.”\n\nAccording to Scurr's award announcement in the London Gazette, December 11th, 1945;\n\n“The Second Officer showed outstanding courage and devotion to duty. After the ship had been sunk the submarine, which was Japanese, surfaced, approached one of the boats and demanded the whereabouts of the Master, Chief Officer and Chief Engineer. Answers to these questions were evasive, but Second Officer Scurr, realizing the danger to his senior officers, volunteered to go on board the submarine. He was taken prisoner and so sacrificed his freedom and chances of safety.”\n\nSambridge is another Fukumura attack where some sources allege he machine gunned the survivors. Other than the odd comment by Captain Bain, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Fukumura intended to murder the survivors, and in fact a cursory look reveals that the casualties on Sambridge were actually quite light. Lighter, in fact, than her aforementioned sister ship, the Sambo. Four sailors were lost, and 37 sailors and 11 gunners were rescued by the British transport Tarantia and the frigate HMS Teviot.\n\nCaptain Bain even conceded that the Japanese did not intend injury, however his assertion that it was some attempt to terrorize the survivors is odd as well. The survivors were clearly already suitable terrorized by the attack, so much so the captain was willing to sacrifice his honor and one of his junior officers to save himself. I believe Fukumura intended to patrol on the surface for a time, and so the gunners were simply clearing their guns in preparation for defending themselves against any potential attacks by allied anti-submarine patrol aircraft. The reference to machine gun fire in Bain’s report was picked up by subsequent authors and eventually twisted around to be an actual murder of survivors. This despite the fact that the four casualties were all attributable to the second torpedo striking the engine room where the men were on duty, and not a single survivor was wounded, much less killed by gunfire.\n\nAdmiralty reports note that the survivors attempted to send a distress signal using an emergency set, but the equipment caught fire before the transmission was completed. The following day the Tanrantia came upon the survivors and sent their own signal 18 hours after the sinking.\n\nI-27 headed back west towards the entrance to the Red Sea and on November 27th Fukumura reconnoitered Birim Island and its anchorage in the Strait of Bab al-Mandeb.\n\nAt 1630 on November 29th, 1943 I-27 torpedoed and sank the 4,824-ton Greek steamer Athina Livanos about 50 miles from the entrance to Red Sea. Nine of her sailors and two of her passengers were lost.\n\nAccording to the Admiralty war diary for the period, Athina Livanos sank in only 30 seconds, which would not be enough time to get the boats away. They were lucky more men were not lost. The diary went on to state:\n\n“searches by Vincents from Aden Nov. 30th did not sight submarine, 2 Wellingtons searching December 1st sighted possible submarine same area while a French Potez reported submarine at periscope depth off Obokh [sic: Obock] same date.”\n\nThe Vickers Vincents were likely from No. 8 Squadron, which had flown the enormous bi-planes out of Khormaksar, Yemen since 1935. They were in the process of finally being phased out. The Wellingtons were brand new Mk. XIII’s that had just been delivered to No. 8 squadron and the newly formed No. 621 Squadron. Wellingtons from these squadrons would take part in the loss of the infamous U-852 the following May. The (Free) French Potez could one of any number of Potez (manufacturer) aircraft flown from what at the time was French Somaliland (present day Djibouti) at the southern entrance to the Red Sea.\n\nFukumura withdrew from the Straights and on December 2nd successfully torpedoed another Greek freighter, the 4,732 ton Nitsa en route from Calcutta to Aden. They were only about 85 miles southeast of Aden at the time.\n\nAccording to the Admiralty War Diary from December 5th; “29 survivors from SS Nitsa landed Berbera”. Berbera is a port in British Somaliland (present day Somalia) almost directly due south of Aden on the south shore of the Gulf. Eleven of Nitsa’s crew were reportedly lost.\n\nThe day after Nitsa was sunk and about 40 miles to the southeast, I-27 attempted to sink the 7,126 ton British freighter Fort Camosun. It is unclear exactly what happened, but it is assumed that the vessel was struck by one or two dud torpedoes. Enough for Fort Camosun to realize they were under attack and issue a distress call. The damage could not have been too severe, however, as rather than head to nearby British ports the Fort Camosun proceeded all the way to Calcutta. Admiralty reports suggest she was in the company (at least temporarily) of the Flower class corvette HMS Jasmine (K23). Eastern Fleet War Diaries also show that HMS Jasmine had left Aden the same day escorting convoy AKD 8 bound for Kilindi, arriving on the 12th.\n\nThe Khedive Ismail tragedy was all but forgotten for many years, until one of her survivor’s sons, a gentleman named Brian J. Crabb started researching his father’s service. His father, Percival “Buster” Crabb was a stoker on the Khedive Ismail and was able to survive by squeezing through a port hole as the vessel sank. Brian’s research eventually led to his writing the book ‘Passage to Destiny: Story of the Tragic Loss of the S.S.Khedive Ismail’ (1997, Paul Watkins Publishing, ISBN-10: 1900289105).\n\nThere are now many varying accounts available on the web, and a few unanswered question about what exactly occurred that day. According to Hackett and Kingsepp’s trustworthy combinedfleet.com website, Crabb’s account seems to be the most accurate.\n\nIn summary, here is what is believed to have occurred:\n\nOn February 5th, 1944 the troop convoy KR.8 departed the port of Kilindini, Mobassa, Kenya bound for Colombo, Ceylon. The convoy was comprised of:\n\nSS City of Paris (10,902 tons)\n\nSS Ekma (5,108 tons)\n\nSS Ellenga (5,196 tons)\n\nSS Khedive Ismail (7,290 tons)\n\nSS Varsova (4,701 tons)\n\nThe five transports were carrying a total of 6,311 Army troops, Royal Navy personnel, medical staff, and members of the Women's Territorial Service (WTS).\n\nThe convoy escort out of Kilindini was provided by the old heavy cruiser HMS Hawkins (D 86), the flower class corvette HMS Honesty (K 285), and two Banff class sloops, HMS Sennen (Y 21) and HMS Lulworth (Y 60). HMS Hawkins was nearing the end of its usefulness, was reportedly not even equipped with anti-submarine gear, and to put it bluntly, was more of a target than a deterrent.\n\nAt some point on their voyage up the east coast of Africa, the corvette and sloops were relieved by the destroyers HMS Paladin (G 69) and HMS Petard (G 56), probably before the convoy turned east to transit the Arabian Sea. A third destroyer, HMS Penn (G 77) was intended, but could not take part as she was still under repair.\n\nOn February 12th, 1944, the I-27 sighted the convoy moving towards them at 13 knots about 60 miles southwest of the One and a Half Degree Channel, and submerged to attack.\n\nAccording to Admiralty reports:\n\n“Convoy included HAWKINS and 5 ships in 3 columns [so only two rows deep]. 3 cables apart 13 knots no zigzag. PALADIN and PETARD about 45° on bows of convoy carrying out broad zigzag.”\n\nAccording to combinedfleet.com:\n\n“Fukumura closes in from ahead to attack, probably intending to target heavy cruiser HAWKINS, the leader of the port column, from the starboard quarter of the convoy. He dives under the screening destroyers without being detected and raises his periscope for a snap shot only 50 yards astern of VARSOVA, the leading ship of the starboard column. Fukumura then fires a spread of four torpedoes at the cruiser, partially overlapped by KHEDIVE ISMAIL (Capt Roderick C. Whiteman), the leading ship of the center column.”\n\n“Three gunners on the stern gun platform of VARSOVA sight a dark green periscope protruding some 3 ft above the water and traveling towards KHEDIVE ISMAIL at 4 kts. They attempt to target it, but their gun cannot be depressed deep enough.”\n\n“At 1433 (convoy time), KHEDIVE ISMAIL receives a torpedo hit to her starboard side engine room and starts to list to starboard. The aft mast collapses and the adjacent superstructure caves in, while the after hatch covers are blown upwards. Approximately 5 seconds later the second torpedo strikes the boiler room forward, directly below the ship's funnel, causing a major explosion inside the ship.”\n\n“Once on her beam ends, KHEDIVE ISMAIL breaks in two; the stern sinks first, the bow upends and then corkscrews beneath the surface only one minute and 40 seconds after the first hit, at 00-57N, 72-16E. Of 1,511 passengers and crew 1,279 are lost, including a total of 77 women.”\n\nThe large number of female casualties, the largest in the war, was especially tragic. The sinking in general was the 3rd highest loss of life for a British troopship during the war (the others being 1) Lancastria with 4,000+ souls lost and 2) Laconia with 1,658 souls lost).\n\nCombinedfleet.com continued:\n\n“Two remaining torpedoes, one of them a surface runner, pass ahead and astern of HMS HAWKINS, forcing her to take evasive action. The two destroyers each turn 180 degrees outwards while the convoy scatters, to regroup at 02-41N, 74-49E.”\n\n“Multiple periscope sightings are reported by different vessels and confusion ensues. At 1436 Lt Edward A.S. Bailey's HMS PALADIN first establishes an asdic (sonar) contact N of the position of the now-sunken KHEDIVE ISMAIL, dropping a pattern of ten depth charges near the stern of the retreating HMS HAWKINS. PALADIN then chases a false contact and at 1449 drops a single depth charge at a periscope detected by the steamer CITY OF PARIS. PALADIN's next attack with ten depth charges against an unreliable target fails, but then a new contact is detected. After her asdic operator reports hearing a noise resembling the blowing of ballast tanks, nine depth charges are dropped at 1502.”\n\n“Commander Rupert C. Egan's HMS PETARD likewise chases several contacts about a mile SW of the sinking. The first target is lost during the approach. At 1500, PETARD drops a pattern of seven depth charges, followed by eight depth charges five minutes later. After the final attack with nine depth charges at 1513, this contact is lost. Following an unsuccessful sweep to the westward, at 1536 Cdr Egan gives permission to pick up the survivors from KHEDIVE ISMAIL.”\n\nAdding to the tragedy, Petard made at least one depth charge run through the survivors, the safety of the rest of the convoy taking precedence over that of survivors. Fukumura was alleged to have been hiding under the survivors, but there is no hard evidence of this.\n\nFukumura was likely more pre-occupied with trying to slowly maneuver away from the escorts. In all his former attacks except the Alcoa Prospector (convoy PA-44) he was fortunate to have found vessels traveling independently, and may have never faced the terror of concerted depth charge attacks by formidable escorts, as frantic and disorganized as the counter-attack initially was. Japanese defensive doctrine would have called for I-27 to move only when the escorts moved and at slow speed to limit the possibility of detection. As I-27 was already within the convoy perimeter and the Khedive Ismail sank so rapidly, they were naturally within close proximity to the survivors. Assuming he was using them as some sort of human shield is just that, an assumption only.\n\nThe logic is quite circular. Later authors, in an effort to re-enforce their allegations that Fukumura was some sort of monster that somehow intentionally picked the ship in the convoy with the most women on board and cowardly hid amongst them often point to the Fort Mumford and Sambridge attacks as proof, both of which I’ve shown as false atrocity claims. In the Fort Mumford and Sambridge attacks they point to the Khedive Ismail attack as proof of Fukumura’s ruthlessness. There were definitely some Japanese submarine commanders that crossed the line, and those stories are well documented, but I’ve seen nothing in my research to prove that Fukumura was a member of that despicable club. I’m all for calling someone to task, as long as it is backed up with facts.\n\nCombinedfleet.com went on:\n\n“At 1620, the stationary I-27 suddenly surfaces about a mile and a half off PETARD's and PALADIN's starboard quarter, down by the stern. Both destroyers open fire from all guns, claiming numerous hits. PETARD passes close to I-27's stern and fires a pattern of three depth charges set to 50 feet. These cause no visible damage and the submarine starts to move, steering 250º at 4 knots and simultaneously correcting her trim.” [Note that this may have damaged I-27’s rudder.]\n\n“The CO of HMS PALADIN decides to ram the submarine to prevent her from diving again. At 1621, when 600 yds away from the submarine, he receives an order from PETARD not to ram. HMS PALADIN turns away to port, grazing the submarine's port foreplane with her starboard side. The impact tears an 80-feet long gash 12 inches below PALADIN's waterline, flooding her engine and gearing rooms, two fuel tanks, and the after magazine. The destroyer goes dead in the water, but fires two depth charges, one of which explodes right under the I-27's bows. Now fighting the increasing list, the destroyer lowers her scrambling nets to pick up the last survivors from KHEDIVE ISMAIL.”\n\n“Two minutes later five gunners scramble from I-27's conning tower in an attempt to man the deck gun [aft of the conning tower on the Type B1’s]. PALADIN's No. 2 Oerlikon[20mm] AA gun opens fire from 400 yards distance, blowing one of them overboard and killing the others. I-27 increases her speed to 8-10 knots, going round in circles and still down by the stern. PETARD fires a number of 4-in rounds that riddle I-27's conning tower, disable one of the periscopes and the deck gun.”\n\nAt this stage I-27 is obviously severely crippled. She apparently can't dive, has lost steering control and can't make enough speed on the surface to get clear or bring her torpedoes to bear, can't control her trim either due to a malfunction of her automatic trim system, flooding, or both. Her conning tower is riddled and her 20mm and 5in weapons disabled, and she is likely blinded.\n\nCombinedfleet.com finished:\n\n“Since the high-explosive shells seem to inflict no apparent damage to the submarine's pressure hull [they carried no armor piercing rounds], the officers of PETARD discuss the possibility to board the I-27 and storm its conning tower with Sten guns and hand grenades, or to plant explosive charges on its hull. Both plans are given up as too dangerous.”\n\n“At 1700, PETARD commences launching single torpedoes, six of which miss the target one by one. At 1723, the seventh torpedo [fired by local control] finally strikes the crippled submarine, blowing her in half. As the column of water settles, the bow and stern are seen sinking at 01-25N, 72-22E. An oil slick and pieces of decking are sighted in the area, but no survivors.”\n\nAs far as any Japanese survivors from the I-27 it does seem highly unlikely, although several Admiralty reports make mention of a single survivor, but no other information has come to light in the years since. On the wikipedia page for HMS Petard it makes a disturbing, but un-sourced reference that implies several survivors were left to the sharks.\n\nIt must have been an excruciating 23 minutes for the crew of the I-27 as they slowly circled, hearing the splash of torpedoes and the high pitched whine of their approach. Each time they must of thought ‘this is it’, as they worked frantically to overcome the multiple system failures that prevented them from diving, maneuvering, ramming, firing back or even running away. Of course, surrendering was apparently not an option for the Japanese either.\n\nOne wonders what the British would have done had their remaining torpedoes failed to hit their mark or failed to explode. Petard had two quad-torpedo launchers, and so had one torpedo remaining if No. 7 failed. It’s unclear if they had the ability to quickly reload. Their depth charges and main armament, while capable of damaging the surfaced submarine had already proven ineffective in destroying her. HMS Hawkins had the firepower to blow the I-27 out of the water, but was miles away by this stage. About the only option Petard had left was to ram I-27 themselves, which would likely result in crippling their vessel as well. This with their companion Paladin already crippled and in a sinking condition without immediate assistance.\n\nLuckily they were successful, and were able to assist Paladin, get her stabilized, and towed her to Addu Atoll for temporary repairs. HMS Petard had the distinction of being the only allied warship during the war to sink a submarine from all three major Axis powers (The first two while under command of Lt. Cmdr Mark Thornton (DSC)); the German U-559 on October 30th, 1942, the Italian Adua class submarine Uarsciek on December 15th, 1942, and the Japanese I-27 on February 12th, 1944. Petard survived the war and was eventually broken up in 1967. Her commander during the I-27 encounter, Egan, reportedly committed suicide in 1948, some allege over lingering guilt for dropping depth charges amongst the survivors. Paladin was out of commission for five months, but returned to action before the war’s end, served in the post war navy and was eventually broken up in 1962.\n\nEventually, about a month after the incident on May 15th, 1944 the I-27 was presumed lost by the Japanese in the Indian Ocean. Commander Fukumura was posthumously promoted Captain at this time, and then on the 25th promoted to Rear Admiral.\n\nThe I-27 was removed from the Navy List on July 10th, 1944. With the loss of the Khedive Ismail and the damage of HMS Paladin, Fukumura became the third highest scoring Japanese submarine commander of the war.\n\nAncestry.com for information on Charles H.
