The many letters and emails Barry has sent to me during the course of this book’s preparation represent a full-blown history of SeaLand and the container industry. I have been especially fortunate in having access to two different, but parallel, oral history projects that were recently commissioned to record the history of containerization. One of these was done by and for the Smithsonian Institution, the other by the McLean Foundation, and they are identified in more detail in various notes. A word of caution is in order, however, about such oral history accounts. They represent spontaneous recollections and are not products of scholarship and research. I have used quotations from both projects rather freely throughout the text. It should be remembered, though, that while the various individuals who are quoted themselves played critical roles in the development of the container ship industry, their recollections can be colored by the passage of time and may not be accurate in all respects. How a principal remembers things, however, can often be as informative as a more literal rendition. Another special word of thanks must be offered to Geoffrey and Nancy Parker of Alexandria, Virginia, for providing me with access to the papers and documents of the McLean Foundation. Nancy Parker is the daughter of the late Malcom McLean, the onetime trucker from North Carolina who, many years ago, grew impatient when teamsters along the New Jersey waterfront took so terribly long to load a consignment of freight aboard a waiting cargo\n\nship, freight that he had driven north. But this is getting ahead of our story. Countless others have given freely of their time to share recollections with me. They are too numerous to mention. You know who you are, though, and to all my sincere thanks.\n\nviii : : : acknowledgments\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe weather in New York was hardly auspicious on Thursday, April 26, 1956. A cold rain fell on and off throughout the day, and the afternoon temperature never got beyond the mid-forties. While a crowd of 15,866 fans ignored the weather and attended the twenty-second day of the spring meet at Jamaica Race Track in Queens that afternoon, a scheduled night baseball game at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan between the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers was cancelled owing to the inclement conditions. New Yorkers in search of entertainment that April evening were better advised to consider something indoors. Undoubtedly, many went to the movies. Among the options, Invasion of the Body Snatchers was playing at several neighborhood theaters, while in midtown Manhattan, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit was drawing crowds at the Roxy. Anyone in the metropolitan area who decided to spend a quiet evening at home could have tuned in to Channel Four and watched Groucho Marx star in You Bet Your Life at eight o’clock, followed by an episode of Jack Webb’s Dragnet at eight-thirty. Two important political stories emerged from Washington that April day a half-century ago. One was an announcement that Vice President Richard Nixon, after earlier hesitation, would remain on the Republican ticket when President Dwight David Eisenhower sought reelection in the fall. The second story involved bipartisan agreement in the House of Representatives over a massive new road-building program that Eisenhower had earlier proposed, an initiative that would be financed from an increase in the federal motor fuel tax and would soon lead to the design and construction of the Interstate Highway System. Along the New York waterfront, the usual assortment of passenger and cargo ships sailed in and out of port. The French Line’s Liberte´ backed away from North River Pier 88\n\nshortly before noon and departed for the channel ports of Europe, while later in the afternoon, Moore-McCormack’s Brazil set sail from Pier 32 at the foot of Canal Street, bound for Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires. Earlier that morning, Italian Line’s Saturnia completed a fifteen-day crossing from Trieste when it tied up at Pier 84. All three vessels were veteran ocean liners that had been built before World War II and restored to luxury passenger service afterward. Less glamorous but considerably more numerous in New York Harbor that day were thirty or more cargo ships of various shapes and styles that arrived from places as diverse as Aruba, Gibraltar, and Hamburg and docked at piers along the East River and the Hudson River, as well as in South Brooklyn. Longshoremen then began to unload whatever cargo the various ships had brought to New York, a job that took days. Another two dozen freighters (see appendix C) set sail from New York that April day bound for ports the world over—Yokohama, Manila, Le Havre, Havana— after an equally lengthy process of having cargo stowed and secured on board. Something that very few people in and around New York could possibly have known or understood on that rainy and overcast day fifty years ago was that the seemingly routine departure of an apparently run-ofthe-mill T-2 tanker on a coastwise voyage to Houston, Texas, would prove to be one of the most important maritime milestones in the long history of the port of New York, fully the equal, in the opinion of many informed observers, of a departure up the Hudson River to Albany in 1807 by a vessel that Robert Fulton called the North River Steamboat. The T-2 tanker in question had been built in Sausalito, California, in 1945. It measured 10,572 gross registered tons, was 524 feet long, and bore the rather curious name Ideal X. The T-2 design was a standard wartime tanker whose profile would predominate in world petroleum trade for the better part of a quarter-century. It featured a stack and machinery aft, a pilot house with distinctive porthole-like windows atop a small deck house amidships, and open decks fore and aft where access ports to the vessel’s carrying tanks were to be found. Ideal X was registered in the United States and flew the blue and white house flag of the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company of Mobile, Alabama. When it pulled away from Berth 24 at the foot of Marsh Street in Port Newark, New Jersey, headed out to sea, and set a course for Houston that day, though, Ideal X was not merely another empty tanker traveling back to Texas in ballast to pick up additional petroleum product. A new and temporary spar deck, as it was x : : : introduction\n\ncalled, had been installed several feet above the vessel’s weather deck, and as Ideal X headed down Newark Bay and turned into the Kill Van Kull, fifty-eight brand-new trailer trucks were securely fastened to fore-and-aft slots in the spar deck. All were decorated with a catchy name that PanAtlantic Steamship had selected for what was, really, a new style of maritime operation: Sea-Land Service. It was not the first time that trailer trucks had gone to sea. What was new, though, was the fact that the trailer trucks aboard Ideal X that day were not really trucks at all, in any ordinary sense. They were, to use a term that would be coined presently, containers—boxes, so to speak, that had been lifted off their detachable running gear on the pier and hoisted aboard the vessel by dockside cranes to be re-stored atop different wheels for delivery to their final destinations once the ship reached City Dock Number 10 in the Port of Houston six days later. The style of transport that the Ideal X pioneered in New York on April 26, 1956, would grow in popularity and importance over the next halfcentury and become the standard and routine way that most ordinary cargo moves across the world’s oceans. In the early years of the twentyfirst century, commodities such as petroleum, coal, grain, and iron ore are still transported at sea in bulk. Automobile manufacturers have found that specialized vessels allowing new vehicles to be driven on and off ship are perfect for their purposes, and while such car carriers are efficient and effective, many would insist that their boxy design makes them the least graceful-looking vessels ever to sail the seven seas. Large and high-value cargo of various shapes and kinds typically travels aboard different kinds of ro/ro—roll on and roll off—vessels that are functionally, although not at all visually, similar to car carriers. But hoisting detachable containers aboard distinctive oceangoing vessels called container ships is the way most other cargo now travels at sea. Whereas Ideal X cleared New York Harbor and headed for Houston in 1956 with a capacity load of fifty-eight containers secured to its newly installed spar deck, over the next halfcentury the concept would evolve to the point where the newest and largest container ships about to enter service today are vessels capable of transporting in excess of nine thousand containers per trip.1 The largest container ships in the world’s merchant fleet today are far too big to transit the Panama Canal, while even larger vessels are on the drawing boards and will undoubtedly take to the seas in the years ahead. In the chapters that follow, I will look into the history of the containership industry and its relationship to evolving patterns of world commerce introduction : : : xi\n\nand transport. It is, I think, a fascinating story that has gone largely untold for far too long, and yet it is a critical element of a global economy that is more dependent on overseas trade than ever before in world history. The emergence of containerization as the dominant form of cargo transport at sea has had a profound impact on vessel design, on the size and location of cargo ports and terminals, and on the relationship of various modes of freight transport one to another—motor carriers, railroads, steamship lines.2 While the pages that follow endeavor to sketch the broad outlines of the container-ship industry at large, my method is to focus in some detail on the evolution of a single company and the impact of the container revolution on the development and operation of a single port city. The company is the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, the one that inaugurated container transport on April 26, 1956. The Pan-Atlantic house flag no longer flies from the mast of any ship, but the Sea-Land Service the company inaugurated a half-century ago is today part of the largest container operation in the world, a company whose main office is located across the North Atlantic in the city of Copenhagen, Denmark, a short walk along the waterfront from the famous statue of Hans Christen Andersen’s ‘‘little mermaid,’’ in fact. The company calls itself the A. P. Moeller Group. As for the seaport whose dynamics have been altered so totally by something that began on a rainy and overcast April Thursday a halfcentury ago, when a T-2 tanker called Ideal X slipped away from its berth in Port Newark, steamed out to sea, and set a course for Houston, Texas: that harbor is the port of New York.\n\nxii : : : introduction\n\n1\n\nCARGO SHIPS, AMERICAN STYLE A PRIMER\n\nOceangoing cargo ships have never rivaled passenger liners—or, for that matter, sailing ships, naval vessels, or paddlewheel steamboats—as objects of general interest and curiosity. The famous Liberty ships of World War II may stand as something of an exception to this generalization, but their fame is surely more a function of the role they played in ensuring Allied victory than of any inherent charm or grace they may have exhibited as examples of the shipbuilder’s art. To be sure, many enthusiasts regard cargo ships with genuine affection. But if one looks through the shelves of a general bookstore in the section called ‘‘transport by sea,’’ for every title one finds that concerns itself with cargo vessels—assuming, of course, that one finds any—there will likely be two dozen books about passenger liners, famous and otherwise. And of the two dozen, half or more may well be about a single ship that had the singularly bad fortune of striking an iceberg and sinking in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean during the dark of an April night in the year 1912. (If our imaginary bookstore browser does find that single title dealing with cargo ships, well that it might be Richard Pollack’s recent work The Colombo Bay, a wonderful narrative that describes a five-week voyage from Hong Kong to New York via the Suez Canal in the fall of 2001 aboard a container ship working for P&O Nedlloyd—a company we shall learn more about in subsequent chapters.1) Clearly, this publishing imbalance reflects some basic economic reality in the marketplace of books about ships. But it is an imbalance that is unfortunate, and it is unfortunate for a number of reasons, not least of them that cargo\n\nships are just plain interesting. It is unfortunate because cargo ships have played a singular role in the history of waterborne commerce. It is unfortunate because the evolution of cargo ship design provides a fascinating glimpse into naval architecture and marine engineering. It is unfortunate because while the swift passenger liners of yesteryear have disappeared, their role assumed by jet airliners—and, perhaps, to a lesser and different extent, by leisure-oriented cruise ships—contemporary cargo ships are critical for the maintenance of world commerce and trade that is increasingly international and global in its scope. Our story is about a single category of cargo ships, those specialized vessels that are known today as container ships—less formally, ‘‘box boats’’—and whose voyages across the waters form a critical link in a worldwide supply chain that delivers merchandise to department stores, parts and components to factories, and just about anything that can be placed inside a container that is eight feet wide, eight-and-a-half feet high, and forty feet long to just about any recipient imaginable.\n\nThe United States Shipping Board An important advancement in cargo ship development took place as the United States mobilized for possible participation in World War I. Under the aegis of a federal agency called the United States Shipping Board, established in 1916, a flotilla of merchant ships was designed and built to support the nation’s possible entry into the Great War and address whatever logistical challenges would be involved in sustaining American Expeditionary Forces fighting across the North Atlantic in the fields of France. Armistice came too quickly for this well-intentioned effort to have any substantial impact on the outcome of the conflict. By war’s end, 470 vessels had been completed, while an additional 1,300 or so hulls were delivered between 1918 and 1922. These vessels became the heart and soul of the country’s postwar merchant marine. Various classes of standard wartime designs, the most notable among them being the colorfully named Hog Islanders, worked for such U.S. steamship companies as the Grace Line, Lykes Brothers, Moore-McCormack, and the Ward Line.2 During this era there were dozens upon dozens of steamship companies operating deepwater merchant vessels that flew the U.S. flag. By most accountings, at the end of World War I the U.S. merchant fleet was second only to that of Great Britain in the number of oceangoing ships it owned and operated.3 2 : : : box boats\n\nThe Great Depression took a toll on the nation’s steamship companies. Few were able to acquire new vessels to replace and upgrade cargo fleets that, despite the influx of some relatively new tonnage from the Shipping Board, were beginning to show their age. Passage of a federal statute called the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, though, was an important turning point. This legislation combined a New Deal interest in invigorating the nation’s dormant industrial base with a concern for future international engagements, the latter a policy that ran counter to general isolationist tendencies that had taken root in much of the country in the years after the Armistice.4 Following the enactment of this law in 1936, the new United States Maritime Commission, successor agency to the earlier Shipping Board, undertook responsibility for developing a new set of standard specifications to upgrade the nation’s merchant fleet.\n\nThe Merchant Marine Act of 1936 The Commission identified nine categories of vessels, each given a letter designation: P stood for passenger ships, for instance, B identified various designs of barges, and L was the code letter for bulk carriers designed for Great Lakes trade. Two Maritime Commission designs are of direct bearing on container-ship history: C for oceangoing cargo ships, and T for tankers. Numerals were added to the letter designations to identify subclasses, with cargo ships identified as C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4—the higher the number, the larger the vessel. A C-1 was a modest-size cargo vessel of just over four hundred feet in length and 7,000 deadweight tons that was suited to offshore or interisland trade. At close to 10,000 deadweight tons and 460 feet in overall length, a C-2 was a good deal larger and became the most popular subclass among the various Maritime Commission cargo designs. C-3s and C-4s were even larger. The United States Navy had input into the C-2 design, particularly its hull form, and many such vessels would later serve as fleet auxiliaries. Preliminary specifications for the C-2 were circulated by the Maritime Commission in 1937, and efforts were made to solicit construction bids from shipyards in 1938. There were some complications in the bidding process that required adjustment, but the first C-2 vessels to be delivered included the Donald McKay, turned out by Sun Shipbuilding in Chester, Pennsylvania, in June 1939 for Moore-McCormack, and the Challenge, built by the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Kearney, cargo ships, american style: a primer : : : 3\n\nNew Jersey, a month later and delivered to the American-Hampton Roads Line.5 Donald McKay was diesel-powered, a feature that was included as an option in the overall C-2 specification but not one that would be widely adopted, while Challenge was powered by a steam turbine engine, the more common C-2 power plant. In all, between 1940 and 1945, 240 cargo ships were built in the United States that can be identified as C-2 vessels. Of this total, only twenty-two were diesel-powered. The entire class became an important national asset during World War II, some even being converted into troopships. With passage of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 at war’s end, large numbers of C-2s became available to begin the systematic rebuilding of the nation’s peacetime merchant marine.6 The Maritime Commission’s C-3 was a larger version of the C-2. Its deadweight tonnage was almost 12,000, it measured 492 feet in length, and in its civilian configuration it could include provision for as many as a hundred passengers in addition to cargo. Some C-2s featured passenger accommodations, but they were far more limited, a typical C-2 carrying, perhaps, no more than a dozen passengers. Both the C-2 and the C-3 featured a profile that can be called conventional for cargo ships of the era. The pilothouse and funnel were located atop a deckhouse that was positioned slightly astern of midships, and cargo hatches were found both forward and astern of this superstructure. At 522 feet in length, the C-4 design was not only the largest of the Maritime Commission’s cargo ships of the late 1930s, but it also had a profile that could be rather different from the C-2 or the C-3. Most C-4s featured a wheelhouse and superstructure that was located well forward, with a second deckhouse closer to the stern topped off by the vessel’s funnel. In this basic cargo configuration, two holds were located forward of the wheelhouse, four holds were found between the wheelhouse and the second deckhouse, and the seventh hold was close to the stern. So designed, the C-4 did not prove terribly popular with U.S. steamship companies. The most interesting adaptation of the basic design, though, was that forty-five of them were built from the keel up as troopships. In such a configuration, a C-4 could accommodate as many as three thousand soldiers and their equipment. C-4 transports participated in landings throughout the Pacific theater during the war’s final months, and many continued in troop service during the Korean conflict and on into the 1960s. While there were minor variations among subclasses, a basic C-4 was 520 feet long with a deadweight tonnage of almost 15,000.7 4 : : : box boats\n\nIt can safely be said that the C-4 lent itself to more creative postwar adaptations than did any of the other Maritime Commission cargo ships. The Air Force, for example, outfitted two as missile-tracking ships in the 1960s, while United States Lines chartered a number of C-4 troop ships shortly after VE Day to assist in the transport of war brides and immigrants from Europe to the United States. Other C-4s were converted into hospital ships, tankers, even bulk carriers for the Great Lakes trade. More to the point, C-4s would play a very important role in the early years of the container-ship industry. Petroleum-carrying merchant ships were also included in the Maritime Commission’s effort to develop a set of updated designs for the nation’s merchant fleet in the late 1930s. Tankers typically featured a small deckhouse amidships that was topped off by the vessel’s wheelhouse, with a separate superstructure at the stern where the vessel’s funnel and ventilators were to be found, not totally unlike the profile of basic C-4 cargo ships, although this was a design that was popular in the petroleum trade since the nineteenth century, long before the days of the Maritime Commission. Between the dual superstructures and forward of the amidships one, tankers featured a broad and open main deck where valves and other gear were located that controlled the loading and unloading of product into the vessel’s carrying tanks. Tanker designs generated by the Maritime Commission in the late 1930s were identified, simply enough, as the T-1, T-2, and T-3, with tankers built to T-2 specifications constituting the bulk of the wartime fleet that transported millions of barrels of petroleum across the Atlantic and the Pacific in support of the war effort. Following hostilities, T-2 tankers were conveyed to private operators and formed the backbone of the country’s fleet for many years. A typical T-2 tanker had an overall length of 526 feet and a deadweight tonnage of 10,600.8 The U.S. Maritime Commission and its private sector partners that designed and built various classes of merchant vessels in the years after 1936 were surely—and quite deservedly—proud of their accomplishments. Even they would surely be surprised, though, by the extraordinary longevity of much of their handiwork. A quarter-century after VJ Day, various U.S.-flag steamship companies were expanding their fleets with new tonnage. And yet often as not, such ‘‘new’’ vessels involved the upgrading of veteran C-2s, C-4s, and T-2s, often cutting a vessel in half and splicing a new midbody section into its hull, a procedure often described in the trade press as ‘‘jumboizing.’’ cargo ships, american style: a primer : : : 5\n\nWorld War II Cargo ships built to Maritime Commission specifications would play a critical role during World War II. But transoceanic logistical challenges that were at the heart of the Allied war effort required a more dramatic response than merely accelerating the construction pace of conventional C-2 and C-3 cargo ships. Thus was born the famous Liberty ship, and after it the Victory ship. Neither was a state-of-the-art cargo vessel. At 441 feet in length, a Liberty Ship was comparable to a C-2 in size, but with a top speed of only 10.5 knots, it was substantially slower. Liberty ships and Victory ships were given letter designations by the Maritime Commission so they could be categorized along with the other standardized designs such as the C-2 and the T-2. Because they were developed as part of the nation’s emergency mobilization for war, Liberty ships were identified as EC-2 vessels—E for emergency, C for cargo—while vessels built to Victory specifications were identified as VC-2s.9 The genius of the Liberty ship was that it could be produced quickly, it could be produced in quantity, and it could be produced without undue compromise of the nation’s ability to concentrate its heavy shipbuilding resources on warships and other higher-value construction. The Liberty ship, for instance, was powered by an utterly conventional, even outmoded, triple-expansion reciprocating steam engine. Basic C-2 specifications called for more efficient steam turbine power plants with diesels as an option, but the nation’s capability to produce steam turbines was more than fully subscribed for other tonnage—warships and T-2 tankers, for instance. So the Liberty ship program relied on an older engine design, one that could be produced in quantity without affecting the nation’s ability to produce sufficient numbers of turbine engines for other vessels that needed them more. Also central to the overall design was the matter of marine reduction gears, critical hardware that was in especially short supply since, before the war, United States shipyards imported substantial quantities of such gears—and the machine tools to produce them—from Germany. Reduction gears were necessary to step down the high-revolution output of a steam turbine engine before linking it to a propeller shaft, while reciprocating steam engines could be tied directly to the shaft without such gearing. Many war-built T-2 tankers, on the other hand, were powered by steam turbine engines, but in a revision of the Maritime Commission’s original specifications, their propulsion was achieved by connecting the 6 : : : box boats\n\nturbines to electric generators and then powering the vessel’s propeller with an electric motor, another way to avoid the need for specialized marine gearing. The Victory ship was yet another wartime cargo vessel that was produced in quantity. While it was superior to the Liberty in several important specifications, it, too, was not the equal of the C-2 in speed. (Some have called the Victory a no-frills version of the C-2.) U.S. shipyards turned out 2,751 Liberty ships starting with the Patrick Henry of 1941, making this design without any doubt the largest single class of seagoing merchant vessels of any and all time. Placed end-to-end, 2,751 Liberty ships would form a line more than two hundred miles long, and American shipyards supplemented this production by turning out 534 Victory ships. Following hostilities, massive fleets of government-owned Liberty and Victory ships were available, almost immediately, to restore the American merchant marine to prewar capability. Indeed at war’s end and for several years afterward, the American merchant marine would enjoy a distinction it never did before and will undoubtedly never achieve again: It was the largest oceangoing merchant fleet on the face of the earth. In 1946 there were some 130 U.S.-flag steamship lines, and the country’s merchant fleet included 4,422 deepwater vessels of 1,000 gross registered tons or greater.10 Although they would soldier on for lesser operators for many years, Liberty and Victory ships would see relatively brief careers in postwar merchant service for the major U.S.-flag steamship lines. The style of cargo ship that American companies preferred was the faster and more modern C-2. As these were mustered out of government service during the late 1940s, they quickly replaced Liberty and Victory types and became the heart of the country’s cargo fleet for the next decade and a half. Some new cargo ships that were built immediately after the war were variations of the C-4 design. A whole subclass of C-4s that featured a more conventional cargo-ship profile—deckhouse and funnel slightly astern of midships—was built in the late 1940s and identified as Mariner-class vessels. Capable of making twenty knots, the Mariner class was really a different breed of vessel from wartime C-4s, although thanks to their length, Mariner class vessels were categorized as C-4s in Maritime Commission notation. In any event, all of the original Maritime Commission designs would not only continue in postwar cargo service, but also, because they were cargo ships, american style: a primer : : : 7\n\nso readily available and, not incidentally, because they were well designed and soundly built, would become the raw materials, so to speak, that naval architects would use to design and build the world’s first generation of container-carrying vessels. Table 1.1 displays basic comparative information about various standard cargo ships developed under the auspices of the Maritime Commission.\n\nLoading and Unloading Cargo Something common to virtually all cargo ships in the first half of the twentieth century was how they were loaded and unloaded—very, very slowly. Cargo was carried in below-deck holds, open spaces that were reached through large hatches located on the surface of the main deck, sometimes referred to as the weather deck. Cargo ships were outfitted with a forest of masts, posts, and booms adjacent to the various hatch covers, equipment that was used to hoist cargo aboard ship from an adjacent wharf, and then lower it into one of the ship’s holds for stowage below deck. Wharves where cargo vessels docked often included elevated steelwork that hoisting gear aboard ship could use as leverage to extend the ship’s reach onto the pier. Cargo could also be hoisted aboard ship by cranes table 1.1.

While the hoisting of cargo from pier to ship, or from ship to pier, was a mechanized process, making use of such equipment as gantries and forklift trucks, much of the overall effort involved extensive manual labor. Cargo that had been delivered by truck or train to one end of a pier in advance of a ship’s departure had to be moved to a point where it could be reached by a ship’s cranes and hoists, and once lowered into the hold, gangs of longshoremen would be required to ensure that the cargo was stowed in such a way that it would neither be damaged nor cause any damage during a potentially rough voyage across the sea. Given the uncertainties of cargo ship schedules, freight was often delivered to a pier days and even weeks before it could be loaded aboard a vessel, thus creating another series of problems and difficulties, not the least of which were multiple opportunities for pilferage from cargo indiscriminately stored on piers for lengthy periods of time. Reflecting on these uncertainties, a steamship executive would later claim that it typically cost his company more to move a quantity of cargo a few hundred feet from the street in front of a pier to the hold of a ship than it did to transport it across the sea from one port to another.11 Such a style of service has long been referred to as break-bulk cargo operation. Break-bulk cargo is characterized by its multiplicity and diversity. In place of a single commodity that could be carried in indiscriminate bulk—coal, say, or petroleum, or grain—in break-bulk operations, cargo arrives in any number of different shapes, sizes, and configurations. In break-bulk service, a cargo ship might carry barrels of cooking oil, cartons of grocery products, office equipment in irregular shapes and sizes, bales of textile, machinery, bags of coffee beans, automobile parts, and so on. Given the investment of time and effort that was required to load and unload a break-bulk cargo ship, it was not uncommon for a vessel assigned to the busy transatlantic trade route between New York and the channel ports of Europe to spend as much time in port loading and unloading cargo, over its lifetime, as it did steaming across the ocean.12 Because loading and unloading in a port city was a lengthy task largely performed by local stevedores, seamen who toiled aboard oceangoing cargo ships had considerable free time to spend ashore as their vessels were serviced for the outbound voyage. An entire subculture would develop around these sailors and the often disreputable waterfront establishments they frequented in the various ports they visited. Today, with cargo ships, american style: a primer : : : 9\n\ncontainer ships completing their terminal operations in hours, not days, the very idea of a smoke-filled waterfront cafe´ whose patrons are largely lonely merchant seamen from countries the world over is as dated a concept as the horse and buggy or high-button shoes. Commercial establishments that cater to the needs of merchant seamen in ports throughout the world today are convenience stores that offer such services as the sale and rental of DVDs and videotapes, plus such basic merchandise as toiletries, snack food, cigarettes, and prepaid telephone cards. They also typically include banks of pay telephones, and even online computer terminals, for contacting family and friends back home. It was within an older context, with the loading and unloading of cargo ships a process that consumed inordinate amounts of time, that a trucker out of Fayetteville, North Carolina, ventured north to the port of New York in late November 1937. The man was not merely a hired driver; he also owned the vehicle he had navigated north to the New Jersey waterfront opposite midtown Manhattan. His truck carried bales of export cotton from North Carolina that would be placed aboard a cargo ship of the American Export Line for shipment to Istanbul. The man grew irritated, though, when the loading of the ship’s cargo proved to be such a time-consuming process. And so, as he waited impatiently on the New Jersey waterfront and watched stevedores conducting their protracted operations, an idea began to form in his mind. ‘‘Wouldn’t it make more sense,’’ he may well have thought to himself, ‘‘if cargo could be hoisted aboard in larger lots and didn’t have to be handled so many times by so many different people? Why couldn’t my whole truck be put aboard ship, for instance, and then used to deliver its freight on the other side?’’ Eventually the truck driver found that a five-dollar tip to a gang foreman helped get his cargo loaded with a little more dispatch, but as he later picked up a shipment of roofing material in New Jersey and then drove his truck south through Philadelphia and Baltimore and Washington along U.S. Highway One on his way back to North Carolina, he kept thinking about all the time he had wasted on the Hudson River waterfront. ‘‘There has to be a better way,’’ the truck driver kept telling himself. Twenty-three years later, in 1956, when a ship by the name of Ideal X pulled away from a different pier in northern New Jersey, a one-time North Carolina truck driver by the name of Malcom McLean had a chance to demonstrate that, indeed, there was a better way.13 10 : : : box boats\n\nCoastal Steamship Service A characteristic of the American maritime scene that would be changed, and changed radically, in the aftermath of World War II was cargo service between various ports along the East Coast and Gulf Coast, as well as cargo transport between the East Coast and the West Coast. (As a matter of common terminology, coastwise generally refers to service along and between the East and the Gulf coasts, or up and down the Pacific coast, whereas intercoastal characterizes service between the East and West coasts via the Panama Canal.) Such steamship service had to function under the provisions of an important federal statute. To move cargo from one United States port to another required the use of a U.S.-flagged vessel that had been built in a United States shipyard, was owned not only by a U.S. company, but also by a company under the direct control of U.S. citizens, and, finally, was operated by U.S. seamen. The Jones Act—named after Wesley Livsey Jones of Washington State, who served in the U.S. Senate from 1909 to 1932—was passed into law in 1920 as part of an effort to stabilize the country’s postwar merchant marine.14 The Jones Act, although slightly modified, remains very much in force in the twenty-first century and will prove to be a determining factor in the subsequent history of the maritime industry. One legal requirement that the Jones Act does not make, however, and that will affect the container-ship industry in an interesting way, is that to be registered in the United States and fly the U.S. flag, a ship need not have been built in a domestic shipyard. A foreign-built vessel may be owned by a U.S. company, fly the U.S. flag, and show a U.S. hailing port on its stern. The Jones Act prohibits such a vessel from operating in domestic trade between U.S. ports, although it may operate between a foreign port and a U.S. port. Southampton to New York, yes; New York to Miami, no. Coastwise and intercoastal steamship service, as protected by the Jones Act, was an important element of the nation’s overall transport system in the years and decades before World War II. In 1939, no fewer than 165 vessels were engaged in intercoastal service, with 543 working coastwise trades. Fifteen years later, in postwar 1954, a mere 57 vessels were at work in intercoastal services, and of 283 cargo ships sailing coastwise, 230 were tankers moving petroleum from oil fields to refineries. In the late 1930s, no less than a third of all oceangoing vessels that entered the port of New York were working in wholly domestic trades.15 cargo ships, american style: a primer : : : 11\n\nThe war itself caused coastwise and intercoastal service to be curtailed severely. For one thing, oceangoing cargo ships were more needed for transoceanic assignments. What was more important, though, was that during the early years of America’s participation in the war, lurking Nazi submarines began to take an awful toll on merchant ships attempting to steam up and down the Atlantic coast.16 Coastwise and intercoastal services were resumed at war’s end, but would never achieve the importance they enjoyed during the years before Pearl Harbor. Railroads that were used as safer wartime substitutes for coastwise and intercoastal steamships retained substantial market share afterward, and the postwar era also saw a new generation of over-the-road trucks—larger rigs with powerful diesel-powered tractors on the business end—competing for many of the same markets.\n\n12 : : : box boats\n\n2\n\nTHE PAN-ATLANTIC STEAMSHIP COMPANY 1933–57\n\nA corporation founded in the Great Depression year of 1933, called the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, can hardly lay claim to the kind of long and colorful maritime heritage that one associates with the likes of, say, Cunard or Holland America. With its operational headquarters in the quiet Gulf Coast port city of Mobile, Alabama, the new company’s objective was to provide scheduled steamship service—primarily cargo, but perhaps some incidental passenger traffic as well—between ports along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Such coastwise steamship service, as it was called, represented a style of oceangoing transport that was quite popular, and reasonably profitable, in the decades leading up to World War II.\n\nThe Early Years of Pan-Atlantic Pan-Atlantic, though, would never become much of a force in coastwise trade. The more prominent coastal steamship companies of the era—Clyde-Mallory, Merchant and Miners Steamship Company, the Savannah Line— could boast long histories and were especially known for the distinctive passenger tonnage they operated. As both a new carrier and one emphasizing cargo service, Pan-Atlantic would never rival its older and more glamorous competitors. But the company offered genuine liner service—that is to say, steamship arrivals and departures at selected port cities on a regular schedule. Before Pan-Atlantic was a year old, the company’s fleet consisted of four oceangoing cargo ships, all standard designs that were built under the auspices of the United States Shipping Board as part of the\n\nnation’s mobilization for World War I. Pan-Atlantic was formally chartered on July 24, 1933, and began operations between New Orleans and ports along the East Coast five weeks later on the first of September.1 Table 2.1 provides statistical information about the initial Pan-Atlantic fleet; all four vessels were powered by three-cylinder triple-expansion reciprocating steam engines. From the outset, Pan-Atlantic was a subsidiary of the larger Waterman Steamship Company. New Orleans–born John Barnet Waterman (1866– 1937) founded the company that bears his name in 1919 as a venture that would help promote maritime commerce via the port of Mobile, and Waterman Steamship would see steady growth in the era between the two table 2.1.

Waterman began operations in 1919 with a cargo ship called Eastern Sun that it had been allocated by the United States Shipping Board. Built in Kobe, Japan, in 1918 and originally called Taifuku Maru No. 2, Waterman’s first vessel was dispatched from Mobile on a transatlantic voyage to Liverpool and Manchester, and the company began a period of steady growth. In 1926, for instance, Waterman organized a subsidiary, the Mobile, Miami and Gulf Steamship Company, while the following year saw the company establish a separate division to operate steamship service to and from Puerto Rico. The Waterman corporate family eventually included a shipyard and a stevedoring firm in Mobile, and the company even made a less than successful effort to establish a commercial airline to fly between New Orleans and San Juan.2 Like its Pan-Atlantic subsidiary, Waterman Steamship was also based in Mobile, Alabama, and from the mid-1930s onward, Waterman concentrated its efforts on international routes and service to and from Puerto Rico, as well as intercoastal operations between the East and West coasts. Pan-Atlantic was left to handle coastwise service—that is to say, operations covered by the provisions of the Jones Act, and more particularly, service between ports along the East and Gulf coasts of the United States. In addition, Pan-Atlantic vessels provided short-haul feeder service to longer liner trades that Waterman operated.3 Waterman and Pan-Atlantic thus maintained separate identities, although vessels were often chartered from parent to subsidiary and subsidiary to parent. Furthermore, the blue-and-white house flag and stack markings of each company during this era evidenced similarities in their design. When they called at the port of New York, Waterman and PanAtlantic vessels both used North River Pier 45, at the foot of Christopher Street, in Manhattan; both companies also worked out of the same sales office in New York at 19 Rector Street, and were listed in the Manhattan telephone directory under the same number, WHitehall 4-3111. In 1936, when the Pan-Atlantic fleet included four vessels, parent Waterman was operating a seventeen-vessel fleet of cargo ships. By the early 1940s, Pan-Atlantic’s fleet had increased to six cargo ships, Waterman’s to twenty-three.4 Shortly afterward, but just before America’s entry into World War II, Pan-Atlantic’s six-vessel fleet was supplemented by two turn-of-the-century cargo ships, the El Dia and the El Valle. Each was a 4,500-gross-ton vessel built in 1901 at Newport News, Virginia, for service by the Morgan Line, a maritime subsidiary of the Southern Pacific Railroad.5 After joining the Pan-Atlantic fleet, the former was renamed Pan the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 15\n\nYork and the latter Pan Crescent. (With respect to both Waterman and Pan-Atlantic, a word of caution is in order about vessel names. There was a practice, across the two related companies, to repeat popular vessel names, replacement tonnage often memorializing the name of an older vessel. Waterman’s 5,432-gross-ton Gateway City, for instance, a 1920-built cargo ship the company operated before World War II, was recalled when the same name was bestowed on a C-2 cargo ship after the war, one that would figure prominently in the development of the container-ship industry.) Executives at Waterman realized that the war in Europe would likely soon involve the United States. In June 1940, the company sent a telegram to a congressman from Alabama, William B. Bankhead, a man who was also the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. It read: ‘‘Believing that participation by the United States in the European War is inevitable and that speed is preferable to delay, Waterman Steamship Corporation requests that you advise President Roosevelt that it is ready to aid in every way it can with ships and other resources.’’6 Whether the company’s 1940 telegram had any impact is moot, but Waterman and Pan-Atlantic suspended routine civilian operations in early 1942 shortly after the United States entered World War II, and the assets of both companies were deployed on war-related assignments. Waterman was called on to operate as many as 125 cargo ships during the war, only thirty-seven of which were former Waterman or Pan-Atlantic vessels. Of the thirty-seven, though, seventeen were sunk by enemy action, and 40 Waterman officers, as well as 147 seamen, were lost aboard them. One exWaterman freighter, the 1920-built Kofresi, was deliberately sunk on June 14, 1944, to help form a breakwater off Omaha Beach at Normandy.\n\nThe Postwar Era Waterman and Pan-Atlantic resumed their prewar routes and services shortly after V-J Day. At first, Pan-Atlantic operated a fleet of five Liberty ships that it obtained under bareboat charter from the Maritime Commission. The Liberty was an emergency wartime design, produced out of necessity and with a top speed of only 10.5 knots. While vital to the war effort, Liberty ships were considerably less than state-of-the-art cargo vessels and could hardly provide competitive service in postwar commercial markets. Table 2.2 identifies Pan-Atlantic’s postwar Liberty ships. Pan-Atlantic later supplemented its five Liberty ships with two Victorystyle cargo ships, also chartered from the Maritime Commission, the Bessemer Victory and the Canton Victory.7 By 1950, though, Pan-Atlantic had 16 : : : box boats\n\ntable 2.2.

With the arrival of the C-2s, Pan Atlantic even advertised its scheduled sailings up and down the East Coast as available for limited passenger traffic, since each C-2 had accommodations for up to twelve passengers. Table 2.3 identifies the extent of the company fleet in 1955. With its seven newly acquired C-2s in service, Pan-Atlantic established two routes, each served by multiple vessels and featuring scheduled departures every seven days. Three ships were assigned to a twenty-one-day circuit out of New Orleans that included calls in Mobile, Pensacola, Tampa, Georgetown, Boston, New York, and Jacksonville before returning to New Orleans, while four ships worked a twenty-eight-day circuit that also began in New Orleans and included stops in Mobile, Panama City, Tampa, Jacksonville, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Jacksonville (again), Miami, Tampa (again), and then back to New Orleans. If all schedules were maintained as advertised, Pan-Atlantic vessels would make 1,042 separate port calls each year.8 With respect to calls at the port of New York, Pan Atlantic and Waterman were no longer using North River Pier 45, but had shifted their operations to a pier at the foot of Columbia Street along the Brooklyn waterfront. the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 17\n\nNotes\n\n1\n\ntable 2.3.

Pan-Atlantic’s parent corporation, Waterman Steamship, also acquired a substantial fleet of cargo ships from the Maritime Commission after the war for its various services. Indeed with twenty-three C-2s on its roster and an overall cargo fleet that grew to fifty-five hulls by 1949, not all C-2s, Waterman ranked third among U.S.-flag operators of oceangoing steamships in the number of blue-water vessels in its fleet and the company operated more dry cargo ships than any other U.S.-flag steamship line.10 Coastwise steamship service, though—the forte of Waterman’s PanAtlantic subsidiary—would never regain its prewar importance. Over-theroad trucks had become a more powerful force in long-haul cargo transport with the popularity of diesel-powered rigs in the postwar era, while railroads that had inherited the bulk of coastwise traffic during the war were beginning to experiment with a novel but obvious concept that could only strengthen their market share—hauling trailer trucks between distant cities atop flat cars in a style of service that quickly came to be called piggyback.11 Also in play was the fact that back in prewar 1940, certain aspects of federal regulatory control over coastwise and intercoastal steamship services had been shifted from the Maritime Commission, where they had long resided, to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), an agency with no previous experience or background in matters associated with oceangoing transport, but with a decided bias toward railroads, many have insisted, in the setting of proper rates for what had become two highly competitive modes of transport.12 It was the ICC, for instance, that Pan-Atlantic had to petition to secure authority to expand its service to Houston, Texas, as previously noted. In a contemporary context where the setting of transport rates, or even the decision to offer a given transport service, is a largely unregulated corporate activity, it is difficult to overstate the degree and level of control that the ICC once exercised. Companies had to present lengthy documentation to establish a ‘‘rate base’’ for a particular commodity, and the ICC was notorious for the degree of documentation it demanded for, and the length of time it required to act upon, a company’s request for a rate the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 19\n\nchange. And, of course, it was the ICC that issued requisite ‘‘certificates of convenience and necessity’’ that were mandatory before a given company could even provide regular service between this point and that one in the first place. An entire subculture of professionals evolved who enjoyed the designation ‘‘ICC practitioner,’’ and who earned lucrative fees by representing transport companies in their continuous and often protracted dealings with the commission.13 Another factor often cited as contributory to the decline of coastwise and intercoastal steamship service in the United States after World War II was the steadily increasing cost of stevedoring services at domestic ports. Unlike U.S.-flag steamship companies engaged in various international trades, in domestic service a steamship company was forced to pay higher U.S. wages on both ends of a voyage and all stops in between, thus increasing the impact of whatever postwar salary increases dockworkers were able to win. In prewar 1939, stevedoring for a typical intercoastal cargo voyage represented 32 percent of a trip’s overall cost. By 1953, this figure had increased to 55 percent, as determined in a study conducted by an economist from Tulane University by the name of Marvin L. Fair. ‘‘It is obvious we are witnessing the disintegration of a major industry that has been very vital to the commerce and industry of the nation,’’ Fair sadly concluded.14 Another scholar expressed matters this way: ‘‘The postwar crisis has come to coastal shipping with the speed and violence of a sea squall.’’15 As these factors began to converge in the decade after World War II and alter the character of coastwise and intercoastal steamship services, the founder and chief officer of what had become one of the nation’s larger common-carrier trucking companies felt it was time to see if an idea he had long harbored could be turned into an operational reality. Why not revive the moribund coastwise maritime industry by carrying loaded trailer trucks aboard cargo ships? So wondered Malcom P. McLean, the chief officer of North Carolina–based McLean Trucking, and a man who was understandably frustrated, back in 1937, when longshoremen in northern New Jersey took so long to offload a cargo of cotton that he had driven pierside to put aboard a waiting ship of the American Export Lines.\n\nMalcom McLean Malcom Purcell McLean was born on November 14, 1913, in Maxton Township, a farming village ninety miles south of Raleigh, North Carolina. 20 : : : box boats\n\nHis family was of Scottish descent and had lived in rural North Carolina for many generations. With little formal schooling beyond grammar school, in the late 1920s Malcom McLean went to work first as a farmer, then as the operator of a small gasoline station. One day a road-building contractor drove into McLean’s filling station and asked where he might obtain the services of a truck and driver. McLean sensed an opportunity and bought a secondhand pickup truck himself for $150 with a mere $30 down, thus inaugurating what would eventually become McLean Trucking, one of the largest motor carriers in the country.16 Malcom McLean’s principal gift was an uncanny ability to deal with numbers—particularly numbers that were preceded by dollar signs. He could perform calculations in his head that others would never attempt without mechanical assistance. Paul Richardson, a long-time colleague of McLean, once characterized the man this way: ‘‘Malcom did the new math before they ever heard about the new math.’’17 Add to this quantitative acumen an instinctive ability to find and develop resources for capital investment, and one can begin to understand some of the dynamics that helped turn Malcom McLean’s business ventures into impressive corporate success stories. During the immediate postwar period, the idea of hauling loaded trailer trucks aboard ship was being explored in a variety of ways. Like carrying trucks on railroad flat cars, it was a rather obvious alternative to consider, and the enormous logistical strategy that was at the heart of the Allied victory in the recent war offered a number of interesting possibilities. Various sizes and styles of war-surplus landing ships, for instance, offered one tantalizing set of options. On August 15, 1947, a company called American Overseas Chartering Corporation began offering an overnight trailer-ship service up and down the Hudson River between New York and Albany, a 150-mile trip, using a pair of converted U.S. Navy LST-class landing ships. (The company’s New York terminal was actually across the river at Pier 16 in Hoboken, New Jersey, slightly upriver from the spot where, in 1937, Malcom McLean grew frustrated when it took longshoremen so long to unload his truck and put its cargo aboard ship.) The ex-USN LST-970 was renamed Albany, and LST-969 became the New York for what proved to be its brief career on the Hudson. American Overseas Chartering, later reorganized as Trailerships Inc., soon faded from the scene, though, its prospects not at all being helped when union teamsters in Albany initially balked at the idea the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 21\n\nof delivering trailers the new company had transported up the Hudson from New York aboard ship, trailers that had previously been driven north by fellow teamsters. For that matter, over-the-road trailer trucks could accomplish the New York–Albany trip, even before the construction of the New York State Thruway, in a small fraction of the time it took for the converted LSTs to work their way up or down the Hudson. (Albany and New York were acquired by McAllister Brothers when they were put up for auction by U.S. marshals in September 1955, with Albany later finding work with the Chesapeake Bay Ferry District for a number of years as the cross-bay ferry Old Point Comfort.)18 A landing-ship conversion that received considerable attention in the maritime trade press envisioned service across less sheltered waters than the Hudson River. Thus was an unfinished LST-class hull sent to the Merrill-Stevens Dry Dock and Repair Company in Jacksonville, Florida, for an extensive rebuild. It emerged in December 1956 as the 8,000-grosston trailer ship Carib Queen, a vessel capable of transporting ninety-two loaded trailers and ninety-seven automobiles on their own wheels in rollon and roll-off (ro/ro) fashion. Carib Queen could also accommodate ninety-seven tons of general break-bulk cargo, and her conversion followed specifications that had been drawn up by a naval architecture firm from New York, Designers and Planners Inc.19 In early 1957 Carib Queen made a trip from the Brooklyn Army Base in New York to the historic French coastal port of St. Nazaire at the mouth of the River Loire on behalf of the U.S. Navy’s Military Sea Transport Service (MSTS), and later began a less-than-successful commercial career. Initially operated by Gulf Atlantic Transportation Company of Jacksonville, and intended for use between Key West and Havana, Carib Queen was shifted to TMT Trailer Ferry before ever entering such service and was operated by that company between Florida and San Juan, Puerto Rico, for several seasons before being returned to MSTS and eventual conversion into the missile-carrying ship Taurus. Plans were constantly under discussion in the maritime world for new constructions, not converted landing ships, that would emulate Carib Queen as ro/ro trailer ships, but on a much larger scale.20 If trailers traveling aboard railroad cars were commonly referred to as piggyback service, the advent of Carib Queen caused some in the maritime trade press to suggest that ‘‘fishy-back’’ was a proper parallel usage for trailers aboard ship. The emerging container-ship industry can only be grateful that the term never achieved popular coinage. 22 : : : box boats\n\nIn Malcom McLean’s mind, though, World War II provided a more tantalizing alternative for taking trailer trucks to sea than using converted landing craft. To maximize transatlantic capacity during the war, many ordinary T-2 tankers that were carrying precious fuel to Europe from the oil fields of America had been rigged to carry deck cargo, as well. A separate spar deck, so-called, was installed atop the tanker’s weather deck and large items of cargo such as airplanes and trucks were then secured to the spar deck, while valves and ports leading to the vessel’s petroleum-carrying tanks remained accessible beneath. Fascinating, thought Malcom McLean. Mindful of labor problems that Trailerships had encountered in Albany, one of McLean’s early milestones in his effort to transport trailer trucks at sea was securing general agreement about the idea from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the nation’s largest bargaining agent for overthe-road truck drivers. At a meeting of the union’s executive board in Miami Beach on February 16, 1954, James K. McLean, Malcom McLean’s brother and business associate, explained his company’s plans in general terms. When he was finished, Dave Beck, the union’s president, announced that the teamsters were supportive of the idea. As reported by the New York Times, Beck believed that ‘‘the project might result in some temporary displacement of drivers but the long-term effect would be to strengthen the (trucking) industry and improve employment opportunities.’’21 Had Beck and his teamsters reacted negatively to McLean’s idea and dug in their heels in opposition, it would hardly have prevented the eventual emergence of container-carrying ships. But it certainly would have caused the early years of the industry to have evolved in a much different way than they did. McLean’s initial idea was to form a partnership with an existing maritime company, one already in possession of requisite authorizations from the ICC to serve the markets he planned to enter. Because McLean initially felt that the most likely trade for container-carrying ships was transporting cotton from southern ports to the textile mills of New England, the first maritime company he considered—and would eventually acquire— was S. C. Loveland of Philadelphia, a firm that would have given him access to the ports of both New York and Providence, Rhode Island, as well as several southern harbors. Loveland was hardly a major presence in the maritime field. In 1955 its fleet consisted of a half-dozen or so unpowered barges, plus a pair of the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 23\n\nabsolutely delightful wooden-hull tugboats built in 1888.22 In terms of corporate assets, though, far more important than the Loveland fleet were the ICC authorizations the company held. At first, McLean felt that his own McLean Trucking Company would be the appropriate corporate entity for establishing a partnership with Loveland. For a variety of regulatory reasons, though, such a union never materialized. Instead, in January 1955, McLean negotiated the purchase of the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company from Waterman, after an earlier effort in the fall of 1954 to secure control of Pan-Atlantic by acquiring a block of Waterman stock ended in failure.23 McLean’s acquisition of PanAtlantic was a straight-cash transaction. The purchase price was $7 million; seven C-2 cargo ships were included in the sale. To ensure observance of appropriate ICC rules and regulations, McLean removed himself from any operating responsibilities associated with McLean Trucking—the North Carolina company he had founded and was then serving as chief officer—and put his interest in the firm into a blind trust. He then established a new corporation, McLean Securities, to serve as the parent firm of Pan-Atlantic.24 Malcom McLean’s daughter, Nancy McLean Parker, tells a delightful story about her father’s acquisition of Pan-Atlantic. After informing his family they would soon be moving from North Carolina to Mobile, Alabama, McLean cautioned everyone to keep the news confidential, since premature publicity could jeopardize the pending transaction. Young Nancy presumed such secrecy did not apply to conversations with her best friend. Problems developed, though, since her best friend’s father happened to be the editor of the local newspaper. Three months later, in April 1955, McLean went his acquisition of PanAtlantic one better. For an investment of $42 million—money that was raised by using Pan-Atlantic as collateral, with financing arranged through the National City Bank of New York and an underwriting group headed by White, Weld—Malcom McLean became the principal owner of Waterman Steamship itself. Although the term had yet to be coined, McLean’s acquisition of Waterman can be regarded as a leveraged buyout. Working through a subsidiary of McLean Securities, the C. Lee Company, an offer was mailed to Waterman stockholders to acquire their holdings at $48.00 per share.25 The transaction included thirty C-2 cargo ships, plus such Waterman subsidiaries as the company’s shipyard in Mobile, a downtown office building in the same city, a hotel and golf course at Point Clear on the far side of Mobile Bay, and various properties in Puerto Rico. 24 : : : box boats\n\nThe deal was blocked when the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary restraining order in response to a suit filed by a Waterman stockholder. The Federal Court of Appeals quickly lifted the order, though, when former U.S. Senator Millard E. Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland who had been retained as counsel by Waterman, introduced testimony to the effect that the stockholder was acting on behalf of the New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company—more popularly known as the Ward Line—a rival U.S.-flag steamship company whose own earlier efforts to secure control of Waterman had ended in failure. The plaintiff was ‘‘a mere pawn of a rival company,’’ Tydings insisted, and was approaching the whole matter with ‘‘unclean hands.’’26 With McLean and his associates now controlling in excess of 90 percent of Waterman stock, in early May 1955 a new board of directors was elected, with Malcom McLean serving as chairman, while his brother, James McLean, was named president.27 Before the first meeting of the new board was called to order, McLean’s people realized that a quorum would not be present. One of the lawyers went out into the street, approached a total stranger, and asked him if he wanted to earn fifty dollars. The man said yes and was escorted inside and elected to the board—something that apparently could happen in the absence of a quorum. The stranger’s presence allowed the meeting to proceed.28 Later in 1955, the S. C. Loveland company became part of McLean’s growing empire when it was acquired by Pan-Atlantic, and in 1957, the ICC would agree to transfer all operating rights held by Loveland to Pan-Atlantic.29 In later years, Malcom McLean would often discuss his acquisition of Waterman. He was especially pleased over a relationship he developed at the National City Bank in New York with Walter Wriston, who had earlier sought out McLean to solicit business for the bank from McLean Trucking—and thus was an obvious person for McLean to approach when he needed capital to acquire Waterman. McLean convinced Wriston that Waterman was a sound investment, and while Wriston, as an officer in the bank, had authority to approve a loan for $42 million, his superiors changed their minds and sought to reduce the amount. McLean was incensed, paid a call on the bank’s chief executives, and told them that Wriston believed the transaction amount was sound. The officers downplayed Wriston, claiming he was a new hire and little more than a clerk. McLean angrily replied, ‘‘He may be just a clerk but he’s going to be both of your bosses soon.’’30 On the strength of such passion the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 25\n\nthe loan was approved in the full amount, and as McLean had so confidently predicted, Walter Wriston eventually became president of the bank. Indeed, Wriston and McLean would maintain a cordial business relationship for the rest of their respective careers. As word of what McLean was planning to do—namely, carry loaded trailer trucks aboard ships in coastwise service—began to spread throughout the transportation industry, a consortium of railroad interests, led by the Wilmington, North Carolina–based Atlantic Coast Line, banded together and petitioned the ICC to thwart McLean’s efforts. The railroads advanced two arguments. One held that McLean had failed to divest himself fully of McLean Trucking and the ICC clearly prohibited cross ownership of rival companies providing cargo service by different modes. The second argument was that the certificates of convenience and necessity the ICC had earlier awarded Pan-Atlantic envisioned the carrying of ‘‘general cargo,’’ not loaded trailer trucks. In both cases, the ICC effectively ruled in McLean’s favor. Loaded trailer trucks were general cargo, the ICC declared, a finding that was consistent with an earlier decision it rendered in 1954 that permitted railroads to carry trailer trucks aboard flat cars without first receiving certification as motor carriers.31 McLean was required to sever his ties with McLean Trucking completely, though to remain in conformity with ICC rules since placing his stock in a blind trust, as he had done when he initially acquired Pan-Atlantic, was insufficient. As part of the realignment, McLean Industries replaced McLean Securities as the parent corporation of his new endeavor, but essentially the commission rejected the complaints raised by the railroads. Meanwhile, plans were moving along to convert Waterman’s Pan-Atlantic subsidiary into a trailer truck– carrying steamship company.32 McLean acquired Pan-Atlantic in early 1955. Shortly afterward, he filed an application with the Maritime Commission seeking ship-mortgage insurance for the construction of seven new Pan-Atlantic vessels, ships that were estimated to cost $9 million each. They were to be entirely new tonnage, designed from the keel up as ro/ro ships that would accommodate loaded trailers—conventional trailers, that is to say, that would roll on and off ship on their own wheels. As part of the pending transaction, Pan-Atlantic would trade in an equal number of wartime C-2s, vessels the Maritime Commission would then place in a reserve fleet at various anchorages located throughout the country to await any future emergency.33 26 : : : box boats\n\nIn early November 1955, Clarence G. Morse, the administrator of the Maritime Commission, announced that his agency and Pan-Atlantic had reached agreement in principle on the pending transaction. The federal government would insure as much as $55.1 million of the proposed $63 million project. The new vessels, to be built by Bethlehem Steel, would each carry 268 trailers and have a cruising speed of 19 knots. In a separate action, Pan-Atlantic was authorized by the U.S. Office of Defense Mobilization to write off 60 percent of the project’s total cost over an accelerated five-year period, a tax benefit whose purpose was to help provide the nation with up-to-date merchant vessels that could be called on by the military during future national emergencies.34 While McLean was anxious to acquire federal mortgage insurance from the Maritime Commission, as well as take advantage of tax benefits associated with accelerated depreciation, he was not seeking any direct subsidies from the government for his planned new operation, even though such assistance was available. In the years after 1936, companies that constituted the U.S. merchant marine would fall into one of two camps— steamship lines that relied on construction differential subsidies and/or operating differential subsidies provided by the federal government, and those that did not. Malcom McLean and his proposed container-ship operation belongs in the second category, not the first.\n\nThe First Container Ships Even as plans to build these new ro/ro ships were moving forward, McLean was simultaneously pursuing a project that headed in a similar but slightly different direction. He acquired a pair of T-2 tankers that had been built during World War II and in 1955 sent them to Bethlehem Steel’s Sparrows Point shipyard in Baltimore, where they were refitted with new spar decks, such as were used to haul large and bulky equipment across the North Atlantic during the war. McLean, of course, had no intention of carrying B-26 bombers or ‘‘deuce-and-a-half ’’ Army trucks aboard his reconfigured T-2s. He was turning them into trailer ships—but not, in any sense, ro/ro trailer ships. McLean had in mind a different kind of highway trailer, one that could be detached from its running gear on the pier, hoisted aboard ship by crane, and then attached to a different set of running gear once the ship reached its destination. Space aboard ship—which is to say, cubic footage—has always been both precious and limited. And while the notion of carrying loaded trailers was generally thought to be sound, why compromise a vessel’s carrying capacity, McLean reasoned, and waste so much cubic footage by the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 27\n\nincluding a vehicle’s undercarriage, when the only thing that really mattered was the trailer itself? The first of the conversions—a T-2 that McLean renamed Ideal X— steamed out of Baltimore Harbor in late 1955 to begin an extensive series of sea trials that would demonstrate to officials from such regulatory and classification agencies as the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) that the concept was sound and the vessel’s seakeeping abilities and stability would not be compromised by a spar deck full of loaded trailer-truck bodies.35 Why McLean selected the name Ideal X for his first conversion is not known with certainty. The ‘‘Ideal’’ part was supposedly a description of the new intermodal service the vessel would offer, while the ‘‘X’’ referred to the coming together of diverse transport concepts to form a single service. McLean’s second T-2, rechristened Almena for its new career with Pan-Atlantic, was also converted at Sparrows Point and was ready in time to help Ideal X inaugurate the new service in the spring of 1956.36 On the question of vessel names generally, at first Malcom McLean tried to adopt a policy he had earlier enforced at McLean Trucking: Units were identified only by numbers, and drivers were prohibited from painting identifying names or slogans on their tractor rigs, on the theory that uniformity helped ensure consistent maintenance policies throughout the fleet. And so McLean wanted to identify his new ships with generic names such as Container Ship No. 1 and Container Ship No. 2. Paul Richardson tells how McLean eventually acceded to maritime tradition after he was told how unlikely it was that a captain at sea would be willing to go down with a ship that was identified only with an impersonal number.37 A modest challenge that had to be met, of course, was designing and building a fleet of trailer trucks that were capable of being removed from their running gear for transfer aboard ship. Prototypes were designed and built by the Brown Trailer Company of Toledo, Ohio, in early 1955, and the concept was not entirely unprecedented. In 1949, for example, Brown had built a fleet of rather similar trailers for a West Coast customer who used them to ship military cargo from Seattle to Valdez, Alaska, not aboard ships but atop barges. Upon reaching Valdez, the trailers then moved inland after being hoisted onto highway-style running gear. After Brown completed work on prototypes for McLean, production model trailers, as well as sets of detachable running gear, were then turned out in quantity by both Brown as well as by the Fruehauf Trailer Company of Detroit. McLean was also able to orchestrate an agreement between the 28 : : : box boats\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Longshoremen’s Association over their respective jurisdiction in the loading and unloading of containers. Teamsters would drive a container into position at pier side and undo the clamps that were holding the container to the truck chassis on which it arrived, while longshoremen would secure hooks to the top of the container and operate the cranes that hoisted the cargo aboard ship. McLean also coined a distinctive name for the intermodal cargo operation he was poised to inaugurate. Proudly affixed to the exterior of the new trailers was a likeness of the Pan-Atlantic house flag and the simple but accurate designation Sea-Land Service. It has sometimes been suggested that McLean Trucking was the overthe-road company that operated the land portion of a Sea-Land delivery. This is quite untrue; ICC regulations prevented McLean Trucking from having anything to do with the new venture. Instead, McLean contracted with existing and independent trucking companies at either end of his New York-to-Houston route to handle pick up and delivery away from the pier, although McLean had to acquire tractors—and hire teamsters—for moving containers in the immediate terminal area. From a shipper’s perspective, what was certainly the most appealing novelty of the new Sea-Land Service was the fact that a consignment of cargo could now move from point A to point B on the strength of a single bill of lading. No contracting with a trucking company to move a shipment from factory to pier, then a separate contractual arrangement with a steamship company or a freight forwarder, and finally a third agreement with another trucking company at the destination port. In addition, no need to worry over whether the trucking company would get the shipment to the pier in time to be loaded aboard ship, not to mention, of course, a major reduction in opportunities for pilferage on the pier, and a genuine speedup in door-to-door delivery time. Ideal X and Almena entered revenue service in the spring of 1956, with the former’s April 26 departure from Port Newark, New Jersey, universally regarded as the very first time a bona fide container ship made a scheduled trip on any waterway.38 Each T-2 could accommodate fiftyeight trailer bodies, and each trailer was thirty-three feet long. Trailers were positioned eight abreast aboard ship and were secured to longitudinal slots that ran the length of the newly installed spar decks after being hoisted aboard by dockside cranes. Unlike contemporary container ships that sail the world’s oceans with containers stowed atop each other to seemingly dizzying heights, all the containers that were transported the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 29\n\naboard Ideal X and Almena were secured directly on the spar deck itself, not stacked one atop another. A second pair of converted T-2s, Maxton and Coalinga Hills, quickly followed the two vessels. Conversion work on these two was performed at Mobile Ship Repair, the yard that McLean had acquired when he secured control of Waterman in 1955. Maxton was named in honor of Malcom McLean’s North Carolina birthplace, while Coalinga Hills was the only T-2 in the Pan-Atlantic fleet to retain its original wartime name. In fact, Maxton was enrolled on the Waterman roster and chartered to PanAtlantic, while Coalinga Hills was owned by the Sword Line, of New York, and also chartered to Pan Atlantic. Like S. C. Loveland, the Sword Line was a company that McLean had earlier acquired primarily for the operating rights it held, although, as matters turned out, it was Coalinga Hills that proved to be a more important Sword Line asset. All of these facts have sometimes caused confusion about the precise number of early T-2 conversions McLean secured and operated—which, in fact, was four.39 It has often been asserted that Maxton was the first T2 that McLean acquired and converted into a container ship. This is incorrect. McLean took title to the ship that he renamed Maxton from the Marine Navigation Company in April 1956, mere days before Ideal X inaugurated container-ship service. Interestingly, Ideal X, while the first converted T-2 to enter service, was not the first McLean acquired. The vessel that McLean called Almena was conveyed to Pan-Atlantic on April 27, 1955, while the ship that would be called Ideal X was transferred to Pan-Atlantic on August 12, 1955.40 Table 2.4 provides additional information about the world’s very first fleet of container-carrying steamships. It was widely reported in the maritime trade press that in addition to carrying containers in both directions between New York and Houston, McLean also intended to have his converted T-2s transport petroleum on northbound runs from Houston to New York. Pan-Atlantic, though, only held ICC certification for the transport of general cargo. During the highly regulated 1950s, how could the company casually intrude itself into the petroleum trade? The answer is that were Pan-Atlantic’s T-2s to carry petroleum from Texas to New York, they would not do so under any ICC authority held by Pan-Atlantic but would be operating under what amounted to charter arrangements with an oil company. Major oil companies had their own fleets of tankers. In 1955, for instance, Esso Standard Oil owned and operated no fewer than fifty-two tankers, most of them wartime T-2s.

And because there was typically a backlog of product to be moved north out of Texas, oil companies were more than willing to take advantage of any available tanker capacity and make charter arrangements with the owners of such vessels. McLean’s converted T-2s would remain under ICC jurisdiction to the extent they solicited and carried general cargo—that is to say, loaded trailer trucks—on a scheduled basis between New York and Houston. As chartered petroleum carriers, however, they would assist oil companies in services that were not subject to ICC regulation. While such dual use was clearly McLean’s original intention, few, if any, of Pan-Atlantic’s converted T-2s ever transported both containers and petroleum in revenue service. Terminal operations, especially at the New York end of the run, would have been especially complicated. An inbound the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 31\n\n2, 4 2, 3\n\nT-2 would have to dock at Port Newark to unload its containers, cast off and proceed south to one of the oil terminals along Arthur Kill to discharge its liquid cargo, return to Port Newark to take on a fresh cargo of containers, and only then return to sea. Such maneuvering would have had a devastating effect on Pan-Atlantic’s ability to maintain regular schedules, and dependability would quickly emerge as an important factor in all container-ship operations.41 Ideal X and Almena, between them, were able to offer weekly service from both Port Newark and Houston. Once Maxton and Coalinga Hills joined the fleet, Pan-Atlantic was able to increase its service to every fourth day. ‘‘This stepped-up schedule is the best way we know to acknowledge shippers’ support for this new type of service,’’ Malcom McLean noted.42 Pan-Atlantic’s fleet of converted T-2 tankers received extensive treatment in the trade press of both the maritime and the trucking industries, with most articles noting that McLean was also planning to build a fleet of brand new ro/ro trailer ships to complement his more radical containercarrying vessels. But then something funny happened. McLean cancelled plans to build new trailer ships, withdrew his application to the Maritime Commission for mortgage insurance, and turned to a different kind of rebuilding project that relied on readily available C-2 cargo ships.43\n\nContainers and Only Containers In lieu of a T-2 tanker that could transport as many as fifty-eight containers topside and petroleum below deck, McLean wanted a ship that would carry containers and only containers. C-2 cargo ships already in the Pan-Atlantic and Waterman fleets were the perfect candidates to be so converted, and the New York naval architecture firm of George G. Sharp was retained to develop specifications for the project.44 Once Sharp completed design work, the actual conversions were performed at Mobile Ship Repair. The initial program included six C-2s, converted at a cost of $3.5 million apiece. The first conversion to be completed, a wartime C-2 that had been renamed Gateway City when it joined the Waterman fleet in 1950, can rightly be called the world’s very first all-container ship. That is to say, it could haul containers and only containers; it was rigged with vertical steel rails in its holds so containers could be stacked one on top of another in what would soon be called a cellular arrangement; and once newly designed hatch covers were put in place over these stacked containers, additional containers could then be placed atop the hatch covers and each 32 : : : box boats\n\nother as deck cargo. Containers could be stacked four high in Gateway City’s holds, two high on deck. Compared to the fifty-eight-container capacity of Ideal X and the other T-2s, Gateway City was able to carry 226 fully loaded containers, an almost fourfold increase. Gateway City’s deckhouse was cut back and reduced in size to allow maximum room for containers (all passenger accommodations were eliminated, for instance), its hatches were enlarged, and supplementary steelwork was welded in place to ensure no loss of structural integrity. In addition, to give the vessel added stability, outboard sponsons, as they are called, were added to the hull on each side, increasing the ship’s beam from sixty-three to seventy-two feet.45 Much of the engineering that went into Gateway City was completely new and could look to no earlier maritime work for guidance. For instance, nobody had the slightest idea how much tolerance should be allowed between the containers and the vertical cell rails that held them in place. There had to be some leeway if containers were to be hoisted on and off ship, but if there was too much, containers could shift in heavy seas and cause all manner of damage. Eventually, Pan-Atlantic decided to use three-quarters of an inch on each side in one direction, an inch and a quarter in the other. To test how effective these measurements were, a Pan-Atlantic technician bought some modeling clay in a Woolworth store in Newark. He then cut off little cubes of clay and placed them between containers and guide rails. When one of the converted C-2s returned to port after an early sea trial, the little cubes of clay were virtually undamaged, and Pan-Atlantic was pretty sure it had made the correct decision with respect to tolerances within a vessel’s cell guides.46 Another point of difference between McLean’s earlier T-2s and the converted C-2s was that the latter were equipped with onboard gantry cranes for loading and unloading cargo. No shoreside cranes were required, for each C-2 itself featured two movable cranes, one forward of the deckhouse to service the forward holds, another aft to handle the holds there. To ensure a vessel’s stability, though, Pan-Atlantic adopted a policy that prohibited the cranes from both extending outboard of a vessel at the same time, and a longshoreman stationed on the vessel’s navigating bridge enforced the policy with a system of colored signal lights. The cranes were designed by Pan-Atlantic’s own engineering staff and built by the Skagit Steel and Iron Works of Sedro-Woolley, Washington. Each crane was powered by its own 210-horsepower diesel engine and had a the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 33\n\nrated lifting capacity of 60,000 pounds. The trade journal Maritime Reporter noted that when a ship was ready for sea, the arms of the onboard cranes were ‘‘folded like a bird’s wings.’’47 The fact that the converted C-2s carried their own cranes necessitated the widening of their hulls by the addition of sponsons. The parallel tracks on which the cranes moved forward and aft were secured atop the sponsons so maximum hull width could be used for the storage of containers. Before the T-2s entered service in 1956, McLean had to make arrangements with port officials for the installation of secondhand cranes at both Port Newark and Houston. With the C-2s, no such shoreside equipment was necessary. The flexibility of these onboard cranes was demonstrated dramatically a year later, in November 1958. The Coast Guard closed the Houston ship channel when it was discovered that high-octane aviation fuel was seeping into the waterway from the damaged tanker Amoco Virginia, and normal navigation in and out of the port was suspended. Conventional cargo ships bound for Houston were forced to anchor offshore in the Gulf of Mexico until the problem was corrected. Pan-Atlantic’s Bienville, one of Gateway City’s five sister ships, with its onboard gantry cranes, was able to lease temporary space at a bulkhead in nearby Texas City, while tractors were pressed into service to shift waiting trailers to the makeshift facility from the Port of Houston.48 The maritime trade press was impressed with the quality of work that had gone into Gateway City, the monthly journal Marine Engineering going so far as to call the converted C-2 one of its ‘‘distinctive ships’’ of 1957.49 The first of McLean’s converted C-2s departed from Port Newark, bound for Miami and Houston, on October 4, 1957. Coincidentally, just as the transatlantic passenger liners Liberte´ and Saturnia were in port in New York on the day Ideal X inaugurated container service eighteen months earlier, the same two ships set sail for Europe from New York on the day Gateway City made its initial departure. Gateway City arrived in Miami two days later on the rainy morning of October 6 and tied up at Pier One in that city’s old seaport, the site of today’s Bayside Mall. Sixty-one of the vessel’s 226 trailers were unloaded in Miami, and three additional trailers were hoisted aboard before Gateway City departed for Houston several hours after arriving. As if to emphasize the efficiencies that the new container ships would bring to Miami, the first trailer to be unloaded from Gateway City was attached to its waiting chassis at 8:18 a.m. and dispatched away from the pier at 8:20, 34 : : : box boats\n\narriving at its consignee in downtown Miami at 8:30.50 Among the business executives and civic leaders on hand to welcome Gateway City on the morning of October 6, 1957, were Malcom McLean and his brother James, who hurried south from New York after Gateway City left Port Newark to witness the vessel’s arrival in Miami. In subsequent months, additional C-2 conversions joined the PanAtlantic fleet, and the converted T-2 tankers that inaugurated containership service in 1956 were soon declared surplus and sold. With its converted C-2s in operation, Pan-Atlantic quickly settled into a service pattern that featured direct service between Port Newark and Houston, as well as a four-city itinerary that left Port Newark and called at Miami, New Orleans, and Tampa before returning north.51 The most telling statistic about their new container ships that PanAtlantic frequently cited involved the time and labor savings that could be realized during loading and unloading. A conventional break-bulk cargo ship would typically require 150 or more longshoremen working for at least four full days to unload and load a vessel’s cargo. With a container ship such as Gateway City, the same task could be accomplished by a crew of fourteen in a little over a single eight-hour shift. Expressed in dollars and cents and using $2.80 per hour as a basic longshoreman’s wage rate in the mid-1950s, a conventional cargo ship might incur stevedoring charges in excess of $15,000 during a typical port call. With one of McLean’s new container ships, this figure could be reduced to less than $1,600.52 McLean himself never failed to talk about the cost savings that his innovation fostered. ‘‘We sacrifice tonnage for quick turnaround in port,’’ he said some years later. ‘‘That’s the theory of the trailership. A ship earns money only when she’s at sea. Where costs rise is in port. The quicker you can get back to sea the more money you keep.’’53 Faster port operations were not the only opportunities for cost reduction that containerization fostered, though. Cargo traveling in sealed containers was far less susceptible to the perennial risk of pilferage on the docks, and Pan-Atlantic even developed some statistics suggesting that cargo transported in containers was less likely to be damaged at sea, even during heavy weather. In early tests, Gateway City encountered gale-force winds off Cape Hatteras and experienced a roll of 23 degrees, while her sister ship, Azalea City, rolled 27 degrees. Either condition would likely have caused serious shifting of cargo and consequent damage aboard a the pan-atlantic steamship company: 1933–57 : : : 35\n\nconventional break-bulk freighter, but the containerized cargo aboard the two Pan-Atlantic vessels did not shift at all.54 Speaking at a pierside ceremony in Port Newark on October 4, 1957, before Gateway City’s initial departure, Congressman Herbert C. Bonner, a Democrat from North Carolina and longtime advocate for McLean and his maritime endeavors, called the onset of the new service ‘‘the greatest advance made by the United States Merchant Marine in our time.’’55 Elected officials have an understandable tendency to exaggerate matters, especially when standing behind a microphone or in the presence of newspaper reporters. Congressman Bonner’s remarks in Port Newark in 1957, though, were closer to an understatement than an exaggeration. Another aspect of what Gateway City foretold that day involves a story that Malcom McLean would often retell in later years. While dignitaries were enjoying a luncheon on shore, McLean wandered out onto the wharf and saw a man aboard the ship who was looking over the side and shaking his head in disagreement. McLean boarded Gateway City and asked the man what he thought of the new ship. The man turned out to be an official of the International Longshoreman’s Association (ILA). In salty waterfront language, he told McLean that from his perspective, the best outcome would be if Gateway City were to sink ‘‘right here.’’56 Despite such misgivings about containerization, though, Malcom McLean would deal honorably with the ILA, and in the years and decades following 1957, New York longshoremen would become partners in realizing the benefits of containerization. Containerization would see the onset of a guaranteed annual income for longshoremen, predictable work hours, and a portion of the savings that containerization realized used to ensure a comfortable retirement for workers whose jobs were no longer required.57 (How different such a state of affairs would be from earlier labor-management relations along the New York waterfront will be examined in chapter 3.) October 1957 would prove to be a landmark month in both New York City and the world at large. Yet, notwithstanding Con"
