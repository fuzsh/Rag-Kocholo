The entry for 13 April confirms that a test of oiling at sea was conducted with the Warrington on that date in \"clear and pleasant weather.\" Few details were given, although it appears that the tests were conducted with a 2 1/2-inch fuel hose using a method first used by the British (for details see Miller, \"Refueling Warships at Sea,\" 176).\n\n18. These were \"750-tonners\" authorized in 1908-10. Taussig's division was composed of the new \"1,000-tonners.\"\n\n19. Dinger, Ltr from USS Maumee No. TC-60, sgnd H. C.

Deck Log of USS Maumee, October 23, 1916-December 31, 1917, Log books, RG 24, NA. The entry for 28 May 1917 summarizes the events described by Dinger, thereby establishing this date as the first time that the Maumee conducted fueling at sea while under way. Nimitz's memory of the event, recalled more than forty years later in the article published by Petroleum Today, appears to be faulty in this regard.\n\n21. Friedman, U.S. Destroyers: An Illustrated Design History, chap. 2.\n\n22. Dinger Letter. Although only two hoses were used, Lt. Cdr. Dinger reported that it would be possible to obtain a transfer rate of up to 100,000 gallons per hour if additional hoses were rigged√∑an accurate projection later validated by the Brazos (AO-4) during Fleet Problem XIV (see page 43).\n\n23.

The fiscal year (hereafter abbreviated as FY) started on 1 July of the preceding year and ended on 30 June of the year budgeted; that is, FY 1917 ran from 1 July 1916 to 30 June 1917.\n\n26. Naval Appropriation Act of 29 August 1916, Public Law No. 261, 63d Cong., 3d Sess., in Tillman, Navy Yearbook 1916, 480-82.\n\n27. On 20 July 1920, the Secretary of the Navy approved a system for identifying ships that is still used today. The scheme specified the use of letter designations for specific ship types followed by a unique hull number for every vessel commissioned in the U.S. Navy. Under the standard nomenclature adopted by the navy at that time, oilers were grouped under the heading \"AO\" for auxiliary fuel oil tanker.\n\nChapter 2. NOTS, the Shipping Board, and the Acquisition of Merchant Tankers in the First World War\n\n1. Williams, The Wilson Administration and the Shipbuilding Crisis of 1917, 35.\n\n2. Incorporated as the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, under the laws of the District of Columbia on 16 April 1917 with a capital stock of $50 million assigned to the U.S. Shipping Board on behalf of the United States.\n\n3.

Denman was an attorney specializing in admiralty law appointed to the Shipping Board as a political reward for assisting Wilson's reelection campaign of 1916.\n\n5. Williams, Wilson Administration, 100.\n\n6. The four yards were: Hog Island/American International Shipbuilding Corp., Bristol Yard/Merchant Shipbuilding Corp., Newark Yard/ Submarine Boat Corp., and Wilmington Yard/Carolina Shipbuilding Co.\n\n7. The discussion in this and the next two paragraphs draws heavily on Clephane, History of the Naval Overseas Transportation Service in World War I.\n\n8. Hurley, The Bridge to France, 123-25.\n\n9. The Shipping Board originally arranged to place ammonia ice machines on new construction. The navy objected because the system could be ruptured by shell fire and escaping ammonia gas could harm the crew. The Emergency Fleet Corporation attempted to get C02 machines without success. Therefore, a separate compartment had to be built for the ammonia machines, which would take care of gas in case a shell punctured the machine.\n\n10. SecNav Annual Report FY 1918, 35.\n\n11. Taken over were: Gargoyle/Vacuum Oil Co., Gold Shell/Shell Company, Gulfport/Gulf Refining, Los Angeles/Union Oil, Topila/East Coast Oil Company, William D. Rockefeller/Standard Oil Company. A seventh tanker, the Hisco, was also acquired from the shipping board. For particulars see appendix A.\n\n12. Although no documents between the shipping board and the navy have been located for these vessels, all twelve are listed in the Ships' Data for 1919 as \"under construction\" (see U.S. Navy, Ships' Data for 1919).\n\n13.

From the record it appears probable that the Kanawha's commanding officer did not issue a report on the exercise until 5 January 1926 (see note 14). It is also likely that the results were not forwarded to the bureau until the commander in chief, Battle Fleet, issued his own.\n\n16. Since flow decreased because of increased resistance, it was necessary to keep the hose length as short as possible. This required a short towline, which increased the difficulties involved in towing, especially in heavy weather.\n\n17.

Although Admiral Land claims responsibility for getting the words \"ships and aircraft\" written into the PWA Bill (though he does concede the help of Admiral Parsons, chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, and the chief clerk of the Naval Appropriations Committee), it appears that the idea to define public works to include shipbuilding for the navy originated with Parsons in November 1932. Since Land's book was written twenty-five years after the fact, it is likely that he did not feel it necessary to elaborate further (Huske, \"Memorandum for Chief Constructor,\" Land Ms).\n\n13.

Chrmn GB to CNO, serial no. 1628, 21 December 1933, File 420-5, passim, GB Files, RG 80, NA. Prior to World War II, all ships built by or for the U.S. Navy were designed on the basis of a set of characteristics formulated by the General Board.\n\n20. Appointment to the General Board was usually the last assignment prior to retirement. It was the last tour of duty for admirals who had reached the pinnacle of their careers, but were no longer slated for higher command.\n\n21.

The original letter from the Secretary of the Navy to Heiman of 12 March 1934 has not been located in the (SC)A16/QS1 file. It seems likely that the original was written by Standley since a reference to it was also noted under the Op-12D-CD file designation as well as (SQA16/QS1.\n\n8. Corr. from Standley, as acting SecNav, to the administrator of the NRA, dated 19 March 1934, supports this contention as it indicates Standley's concern for the merchant marine (Levine, \"Politics,\" 470).\n\n9.

Availability of funds for the Dixie (AD-14) and the Curtiss (AV-4) were restricted to a specific amount set by Congress, which limited the amount of armor, armament, and ammunition that could be spent to $412,000 for the Dixie and $637,000 for the Curtiss. Because of these restrictions, there was not enough money to procure and fit the Mark 37 directors intended for these ships.\n\n15. CNO to SecNav, 5 January 1940, File A022-24/S1, BuC&R Conf.

Experiments to develop fueling at sea gear for use between destroyers and CVs had been conducted by the destroyer Tarbell and the Saratoga in 1930. It appears likely that such gear was subsequently installed on board Saratoga, thus providing the capability to pass the various lines and hoses to Kanawha as noted in the latter's deck log referenced herein (see Commandant [Mare Island Navy Yard] to Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, 5 February 1931, BuC&R File S55-[9]). This would also explain why station-keeping exercises were conducted between the Chester and the Mugford, whereby the Mugford was used to simulate the actions of the approaching ship as opposed to the ship to be fueled.\n\n22.

The importance of this exercise and the subsequent improvements made to the fueling rig described by Upton are hard to assess. Upton's account of the difficulties encountered by Kaskaskia combined with an examination of photographs of fueling-at-sea operations in the Pacific taken during World War II provide ample evidence of the problems experienced by oiler crews when attempting to conduct these operations in heavy seas. It may be that the lack of adequate fueling gear contributed to the problems encountered by Admiral Fletcher in his attempts to refuel from the Neches during the abortive operation to reinforce Wake. If such were the case, then the success of later operations can probably be attributed to the modifications suggested by Kaskaskia's crew as a result of its experience off Johnston Island. (\"The entire operation was slow and not very efficient. Our booms were too short, there were no quick releasing hooks, no quick shut off valves\" [Upton to author, 21 January 1992].)\n\nChapter 13.

In June 1941, provision was made to expand the production of turbines and gears. Contracts were subsequently awarded to General Electric for the construction of a new plant at West Lynn, Mass., and to Westinghouse for a plant at Lester, Pa. Gears formed the tightest part of the production bottleneck, however, since the machine tools to build them were so scarce that new ones had to be built. The problem was so severe that gear hobbers were later imported from England to further increase capacity (Lane, Ships for Victory, 398).\n\n14.

WSA Administrative Orders Nos. 1 and 2 (see Lane, Ships for Victory, 162). Rear Adm. Howard L. Vickery had been named a commissioner on 26 September 1940 at Land's recommendation so that there would be one commissioner in charge of construction. Vickery, a commander at the time, was first assigned to the maritime commission on 24 May 1937, as assistant to Rear Adm. Emory Land, then commissioner in charge of construction and technical activities. Commander Vickery had previously served under Land as head of the War Plans Section of Design in the Bureau of C & R and had represented the department as a member of the joint board. After Land's appointment as chairman in February 1938, Commander Vickery was made assistant to the chairman and placed in charge of all matters pertaining to construction. Vickery's appointment to commissioner entailed the passage of a special act of Congress, which permitted him to remain on the active list while serving as a civilian appointee. His meteoric rise to rear admiral (Vickery was promoted on 4 February 1942) paralleled the growth of the commission's shipbuilding program and reflected the increased importance of this activity. As the expert on production, Admiral Vickery was the driver who by daily conferences and telegrams directed, advised, and goaded the managers of the shipyards. Promoted to vice admiral in the fall of 1944, he suffered a severe heart attack shortly thereafter, which curtailed his career.\n\n7. \"Esso Albany,\" Marine Age.\n\n8. DANFS, vol. 2, passim.\n\n9.

On that date, the Pecos, which had been detached to pick up the survivors of the Langley sinking, was attacked by succeeding waves of Japanese dive-bombers (three squadrons). Though the ship put up a gallant defense, she was struck by six 500-pound bombs and straddled by three near-misses, which added to the devastation splitting seams and buckling plates below the ship's waterline. Her captain, Cdr. E. Paul Abernethy, was forced to order the ship abandoned three hours and forty minutes after the start of the attack.

Tom Blackburn, who served as a pilot aboard Santee during the ship's deployment in operation TORCH, describes an incident that illustrates the inherent suitability of these vessels for combat operations. As a Dauntless (SBD) was leaving the deck, the suspension lug holding a 500-pound depth bomb failed. As Blackburn and other onlookers watched in horror, the bomb bounced and rolled down the flight deck before falling over the bow. It exploded \"with a great roar and a mighty upheaval of water directly below the aircraft elevator.\" Aside from toppling a 300-pound director and jamming the elevator, no other damage was detected although it is claimed that the double hull oil-canned (i.e., it dished in and then snapped back) (Blackburn, The Jolly Rogers, 21).\n\nChapter 17.

Before the war, most of the large hose (i.e., 6-inch internal diameter and over) was made on a mandrel with wire inserted. The purpose of this wire was to avoid collapse when used as a suction hose. Couple this wire with heavy cotton fabric and metal flanges with five 3/4-inch bolt circles and a 12-foot length, and you had a very heavy hose that was stiff and hard to bend. \"The sheer weight of several lengths when bolted together was a tremendous task for the men to handle.\" Early in the war, new hose was available, much lighter and suitable for discharge only. Related to the author by Bob James, chief machinist mate on Kaskaskia from October 1940 to November 1945, Ltr 11 August 1992. James knows of what he speaks since he was employed by the Boston Woven Hose and Rubber Company, one of the premier suppliers of such hose, before being called to active duty in 1941.\n\n6.
