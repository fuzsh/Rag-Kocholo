        "text": "Depending on design requirements, some ships have extremely large internal volumes in order to serve their duties. Gross tonnage is a monotonic and 1-to-1 function of the ship's internal structural volume. It does not include removable objects placed outside the deck or superstructure, like the shipping containers of a container ship.\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nName Class Type Length Beam Draft Gross tonnage Status Main builder Operator ref Pioneering Spirit - Crane vessel 382 m (1,253 ft) 124 m (407 ft) 10–15 m (33–49 ft) 403,342 In service Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Allseas [1] Prelude FLNG - Floating production storage and offloading 488 m (1,601 ft) 74 m (243 ft) 17 m (56 ft) 300,000 In service Samsung Heavy Industries Shell plc [2] Bellamya Batillus class Supertanker 414.22 m (1,359.0 ft) 63.01 m (206.7 ft) 28.50 m (93.5 ft) 275,276 Scrapped Chantiers de l'Atlantique Société Maritime Shell France Batillus 275,268 Scrapped Pierre Guillaumat 274,838 Scrapped Cie Nationale de Nav [3] Prairial Scrapped [4] Seawise Giant - Supertanker 458.45 m (1,504.1 ft) 68.80 m (225.7 ft) 24.61 m (80.7 ft) 260,941 Scrapped Sumitomo Heavy Industries Orient Overseas Container Line Esso Atlantic Esso Atlantic class Supertanker 406.57 m (1,333.9 ft) 71.07 m (233.2 ft) 25.29 m (83.0 ft) 259,532 Scrapped Hitachi Zosen Corporation Esso Tankers Inc.
