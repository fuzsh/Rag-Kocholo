        "text": "John Avila, president of Spec- Tec General, Inc., recently announced that the AMOS maintenance software system will be used for all ships in the Esso International Shipping fleet. The contract was awarded to SpecTec General's Benelux (economic union comprising Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) allied company, SpecTec Consult B.V.\n\nMr. Avila stated, \"The Esso International Shipping (Bahamas) Co.\n\nLtd., operating out of their Schiedam, Netherlands, office, selected AMOS-D from a number of international competitors for spare part control and administration of maintenance history on board their ships.\n\nAMOS-D will be installed on all 27 Esso crude oil tankers ranging from 25,000 dwt to more than 300,000 dwt. The construction and installation of all databases for the six different classes of ships will take 22 months and will be performed by Esso engineers under supervision of SpecTec Consult B.V.\n\nMore than 60 engineers and superintendents will be trained in the use of PCs and AMOS-D.\n\nFor further information and free literature, Circle 66 on Reader Service Card"
