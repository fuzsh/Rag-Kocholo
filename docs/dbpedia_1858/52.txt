Twelve ships of this type were ordered by the U.S.Navy as gasoline tankers and were allocated pennant numbers AOG-64 to 75. They were single screw motor motor vessels with a deadweight capacity of 4,200 tons and were, together with the BT-2 variation, the largest of the Maritime Commission coastal tankers. Propulsion was by a four-stroke single-acting eight-cylinder oil engine with a bhp of 1,400 and geared to a single shaft, which gave a speed of 10 knots. All engine sets were built by the Enterprise Engine & Foundry Co.of San Francisco, California. Only the first thre saw naval service, construction of the remaining 9 were suspended in 1945, and the they were completed between 1946 and 1951 for civil use. The three vessels operated by the U.S.Navy were sold in 1949 to the Argentine Navy. The T2-A type tanker was another variety of the T2 design. These 5 ships were built by Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Chester, PA for the Keystone Tankship Corporation and its affiliates in 1940. The Navy took them over before construction was complete in 1942 to use as Navy oilers. They were 526 feet long, 68 feet abeam, rated at 10,600 tons gross and a deadweight tonnage of 16,300. They displaced about 22,445 tons. Propulsion was provided by geared steam turbines driving a single propeller at 12,000 shaft horsepower, giving a maximum rated speed of 16 and a half knots.

The T2-SE-A1 design was after the EC2-S-C1 Liberty Ship the most built vessel under the Maritime Commission Shipbuilding Progam. T2-SE-A1 was powered by a Turbo-Electric propul- sion, delivering 6,000 SHP (normal) and 7,240 SHP (max) giving a top rate of 15 knots with a cruising range of about 12,680 miles. All vessels operated during WWII by the War Shipping Administration and managed by various Steamship Companies. After the WWII most of the T2-SE-A1's were sold under the Merchant Sales Act of 1946 to private interests, mainly U.S.Flag Companies. 202 T2-SE-A1 were sold under this act to Foreign Compaines. The T2-SE-A1 survived as conversion nearly six decades of service (Drawing shows one T2-SE-A1 in post-war configuration). One of many conversions starting in the mid-fifthies was to increase cargo capacity, by cutting the ship in two and insert another section. In this case, In 1967 CHEVRON THE HAGUE (ex- Boonesborough) got a new fore- and midbody, with deckhouse installations now aft. Very less shows, that these was a former T2-SE-A1 tanker. The vessel was converted by Hitachi Zosen at Kawasaki, Japan within four months. Under the Exchange Act, nine ships were aquired by the Hudson Waterways Corp.in 1966 for domestic service, to carry containers, railway wagons and vehicles. Four of them were send to Newport News for vonversion. Lenghtened by insertion of a 36 ft. 6 in. section of the old midbody of FRUITVALE HILLS (MC- 2714 Marinship Hull 92 / Design T2-SE-A1). Further work was the relocation of the midship deckhouse above the deckhouse, and a new spardeck equipped with two 50 ton capacity cranes was constructed above the upper deck. Thr lower hold, 328 ft. 6 in. long, and tween deck spaces are devoid of obstructions, and a clear hatch openeing, 61 ft. x 38 ft., allows handling of diversified cargoes. Helicopters can also use the spardeck. The ships are fitted with stabilizers and can load or discharge cargo under bad weather conditions. Carring capacity is 124 tanks and 114 heavy vehicles, selfpropelled guns, bulldozers etc. Drawing shows SEATRAIN PUERTO RICO after conversion by Newport News SB & DD Co. The T3-S-BZ1 design built by Welding Shipyards Inc were considerably larger ships and were constructed to the order of the National Bulk Carriers Inc. The original request was for a tanker of approximately 23,500 tdw and about 215,000 barrels capacity, capable of 17 knots. From designs submitted by Sir Joseph W. Isherwood & Co Ltd, after model experimentation at the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, England, the first ship of the group, the PHOENIX, was constructed by Welding Shipyards in seventy-six days to launching, with a further twenty-seven days to completion. The Isherwood design included an extension of the poop over three tanks to approximately halfway along the hull, and placing the main fuel tank aft of the machinery. A short ballast tank was placed forward and a fuel tank in the forepeak, these arrangements providing for flexibility in trimming the ship. The Isherwood system of longitudinal framing, using corrugated plates and spliced brackets in the tank space, saved 120 tons of steel and a considerable reduction in welding. Practically the only welding done was in fitting huge prefabricated assemblies of up to 100 tons, which were constructed on adjacent ground and lifted by crane. Measurements of the ships were 556 ft oa, 541 ft bp x 80 ft, giving a gross tonnage of 14,160. The deadweight capacity was 23,600 tons and barrel capacity 217,000. High pressure turbines with double reduction gears were installed, developing 13,400 shp, driving a single screw and giving 17 knots. The PHOENIX was the largest all-welded tanker when built.
