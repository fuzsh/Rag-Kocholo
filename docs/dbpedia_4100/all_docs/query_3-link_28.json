        "text": "Policies that provide sustained, high-quality employment throughout a personâs life, support educational and training opportunities, and combat wage discrimination could help close earnings gaps. At the federal level, standardizing pay data collection and implementing proactive audits could help detect and combat payment discrimination, and a federal job guarantee could ensure anyone who wants a job can access one. At the state and local levels, working to ensure wages can sustain families; leveraging workforce investments to improve job quality, such as paid sick time and paid family and medical leave; and offering sector-based skills training for in-demand jobs could also better support wealth building.\n\nResearch shows that even at higher income levels racial wealth gaps remain. People of color often have additional familial financial responsibilities and fewer inheritances, so having a higher income may not be enough to accumulate wealth at rates similar to those of white families. Baby bonds (or âchild trustsâ) and reparations for Black American descendants of slavery could help close these gaps.\n\nHomeownership is the main way people build wealth in the United States. Yet in 2018, the Black-white homeownership gap reached 30.5 percentage points, its highest level in 50 years. Black homeownership rates declined the most following the 2008 housing market crisis and only started to recover in 2019, just before the pandemic hit. Though 2022 estimates suggest homeownership rates among Black, Hispanic, and Asian families are increasing, Black Americans remain the only racial group with a homeownership rate below 50 percent.\n\nStructural barriers, including occupational crowding, have created inequities in earnings and access to and participation in workplace retirement savings plans. Among families with access to retirement plans, those with lower incomes contribute smaller portions of their incomes and are more likely to withdraw money early to cover financial emergencies than families with higher incomes. Families without meaningful retirement savings are more likely to experience poverty and to depend on Social Security or safety net programs as their sole source of retirement income.\n\nTo eliminate disparities in retirement savings, policymakers could develop government-backed universal retirement accounts (such as OregonSaves), enhance job quality, expand access to payroll deduction workplace retirement savings programs, and encourage employers to offer retirement plans with features that boost participation, such as automatic enrollment. Tax subsidies could also be oriented more toward workers with average or lower earnings, such as through the retirement Saverâs Match (PDF).\n\nEmbedding emergency savings accounts into retirement accounts, as introduced in the Secure Act 2.0 (PDF), could be another option. Creating a distinction between emergency savings and retirement funds will offer participants clarity: one account serves immediate needs, while the other is earmarked for long-term retirement planning. This approach empowers employees to navigate unexpected financial crises without compromising their retirement security by resorting to emergency withdrawals.\n\nHow much savings is adequate to withstand economic shocks depends on many factors, but one month of income can be sufficient for most families enduring an unemployment spell or unexpected expenseâand can even prevent financial hardship in the long term. Yet only about half of households had this amount of liquid savings in 2022 (51 percent), which is the highest rate ever measured in the Survey of Consumer Finances. More than half of white households (57 percent) and more than one-third of Black households and Hispanic households (38 and 35 percent, respectively) had this level of emergency savings, compared with nearly three-quarters of Asian households (72 percent). These findings suggest the vast majority of Black and Hispanic households could face hardship because of common financial emergencies. Families with unpaid credit card debt may be especially vulnerable, given credit card debt constrains household budgets, even for those with higher incomes.\n\nFamilies could also benefit from policies and programs that help them save for everyday emergencies and protect their finances from economy-wide shocks. Matched savings programs, where a nonprofit entity, the government, or an employer rewards initial and regular deposits of liquid savings, have been shown to increase savings and reduce hardship. Guaranteed income programs provide predictable funds to help families meet basic needs and weather unexpected events without depleting their savings or going into debt. In addition, automatic enrollment in emergency savings accounts, which recent federal legislation permits, nearly doubles the likelihood that people will save. Finally, enhancing the countryâs automatic stabilizers, such as expanded refundable tax credits and enhanced unemployment benefits, could better protect families during economic downturns.\n\nTo help families with low incomes accumulate wealth, policymakers could consider making current tax deductions more progressive, including by limiting the mortgage interest tax deduction and using the revenues to provide a credit for first-time homebuyers. They could also consider policies that permit and incentivize families to save while they benefit from income-based safety net programs, as the bipartisan Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Savings Penalty Elimination Act would allow. Federal policymakers could also promote retirement savings through a Saverâs Match and automatic enrollment (with opt-out options) in various types of retirement accounts.\n\nIntergenerational wealth transfers vary by race because of racial disparities in wealth and earnings. One study showed that the shares of Black and white families who intend to leave a sizeable estate are similar, but Black families are less likely to be homeowners or to have the necessary large amounts of wealth and income to do so.\n\nNonprofits can look to Invest STLâs pilot program for promising strategies. The program aims to help Black residents build wealth by offering estate-planning support, a financial planner, and funds for investment and immediate debt mitigation. Local leaders can also help residents navigate the legal process to resolve land ownership through legal education and heirsâ property resolution services. In the South and central Appalachia, Black families often hand land down to younger generations without legal documentation proving ownership. Some estimate that these transfers, called heirsâ property, make up more than a third of Southern Black-owned land and are worth more than $28 billion. Families with heirsâ property may not be able to secure a mortgage or home improvement loan but are responsible for taxes and other liabilities and can have their property taken away through court-ordered sales."
