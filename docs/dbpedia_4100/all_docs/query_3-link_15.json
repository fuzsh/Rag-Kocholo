        "text": "The domestic or European ferret (Mustela putorius furo) has been domesticated for thousands of years. Ferrets have been used for hunting and fur production, as pets, and as models in biomedical research. Despite the relatively small numbers used in the laboratory, ferrets have some unique applications including study of human influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated corona virus. They have served as models for peptic ulcer disease, carotenoid metabolism, cystic fibrosis, and drug emesis screening, among others. Most research ferrets are males, due to estrus-related health problems in females. They may be housed conventionally and are easy to care for when their biology and behavior are understood. Due to the small number of ferret suppliers, animals are often shipped long distances, requiring air transport and intermediate handlers. It is important to minimize shipment stress, especially with weanling and pregnant animals. Additional expertise is required for success with pregnant and whelping ferrets and for rearing of neonates. The animals have specific dietary requirements, and proper nutrition is key. Successful housing requires knowledge of ferret behaviors including social behavior, eating habits, a general inquisitive nature, and a species-typical need to burrow and hide. Regular handling is necessary to maintain well-being. A ferret health care program consists of physical examination, immunization, clinical pathology, and a working knowledge of common ferret diseases. Various research methodologies have been described, from basic procedures such as blood collection to major invasive survival surgery. Ferrets have a distinct niche in biomedical research and are hardy animals that thrive well in the laboratory.\n\nFerrets as Animal Models in Biomedical Research\n\nIt is difficult to know exactly how many ferrets are used in biomedical research. According to the 2004 US Department of Agriculture (USDA1) Animal Care Report, a total of 1.1 million animals were used in biomedical research (APHIS 2004). Of these, 171,000 were reported in the “All Other Covered Species” category. It is likely that <10% of this number represents ferrets. Despite these relatively small numbers, ferrets have a distinct niche and some unique applications in research.\n\nOne of the earlier ferret models involved the study of human influenza, a disease to which ferrets are highly susceptible. To date, this model continues to be an important use of the ferret and includes work on pathogenesis, treatment, vaccine development, and investigation of Reye's syndrome (Maher and DeStefano 2004). The ferret is also used to study infection of the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses (Zitzow et al. 2002).\n\nIt has been determined that ferrets are susceptible to another human respiratory pathogen, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS1)-associated corona virus (Martina et al. 2003). The first eruption of this disease affected thousands of people in Asia, causing SARS to be recognized as a serious new pathogen (Stadler et al. 2003). Ferrets have been utilized to study this disease and to investigate development of a vaccine (Weingartl et al. 2004).\n\nInvestigation of airway physiology and pathophysiology is another application of the ferret in respiratory disease research. There is remarkable similarity in lung physiology and morphology between ferrets and humans. As a result, ferrets are used as a model for the study of cystic fibrosis, including a ferret airway xenograft model to study gene therapy (Li et al. 2002).\n\nIn addition to the study of respiratory diseases, ferrets have been used as a model for human gastrointestinal disease. Most notable is the ferret model for peptic ulcer disease, which has resulted from the anatomical and physiological similarity of the ferret stomach to the human stomach, and the fact that both species possess a Helicobacter gastritis-causing organism (Fox et al. 1990; Whary and Fox 2004). Ferrets have been used to study the epidemiology of this disease as well as its pathogenesis and treatment (Patterson et al. 2003).\n\nFerrets have also been useful as a model for nutrition research due to their similarity to humans in carotenoid metabolism (Wang et al. 1992). Furthermore, ferrets have been used to study the influence of carotenoids on the development of certain cancers and cardiovascular disease (Lee et al. 1999; Raila et al. 2002).\n\nIn addition to many basic research applications, ferrets have also been investigated as a nonrodent test system in pharmaceutical drug development, especially as a surrogate for dogs when test material is in limited supply (Gad 2000). A ferret model for evaluating the emetic potential of drugs is another use of the ferret in the field of drug development (Crawford et al. 2002).\n\nFinally, ferrets are used in cardiovascular research, including myocardial infarct models, in neural development and visual system studies, in skeletal research, for pediatric endotracheal intubation training, and for the investigation of renal disease secondary to toxin producing intestinal infection with Escherichia coli (Crawford et al. 2002). These uses of the ferret comprise a variety of applications that dictate necessary knowledge about selection, husbandry, health care, research methodologies, and possibly reproduction.\n\nTransport Containers\n\nThe functional design elements of transport containers are regulated by the organizations described above. These design elements include the following: viewing ports, ventilation areas, feed and watering devices, structural components that promote hygiene, and proper labeling. Stocking densities are not specifically regulated by USDA and IATA for ferrets, but the animals must be able to turn around, lie down, and make normal postural adjustments.\n\nBecause young ferrets are social animals, it is preferable to ship them in groups under most circumstances. Exceptions are sexually intact adult or breeder male ferrets (Staton and Crowell-Davis 2003). In my experience, 5 to 6 wk of age should be considered the minimum age for shipment of young ferrets without the mother. Twenty-eight days of gestation, which is the end of the second trimester, should be considered the latest time-point for shipment of pregnant jills.\n\nShipment containers for conventionally reared ferrets should be lined with contact bedding and equipped with containers for feed and water. Wire mesh or vent openings must allow for sufficient exchange of air but not compromise safety or hygiene from spilled bedding and excrement. Animals must be readily visible, and containers must be injury and escape proof.\n\nRegardless of container design, additional safeguards must be applied during very warm weather (e.g., > 85°F) due to the heat sensitivity of ferrets (Fox et al. 2002, Ch. 13). Precautions include reduction of stocking densities, provision of additional water sources, inclusion of gel packs, and possibly even delay of the shipment. Filtered containers designed for specific pathogen-free rodents are sometimes used for ferrets to prevent exposure to influenza virus while in transit. In warm weather, particular attention must be paid to ambient temperatures and stocking densities because of the reduced airflow within these containers.\n\nArrival and Acclimation\n\nRegardless of the duration of transportation, it is imperative to assess the health and general well-being of the ferrets as soon as they arrive. This assessment is especially important for young or pregnant animals, during times of climatic extremes, or in the event of shipment delays. Early intervention is key to addressing potential complications such as dehydration and stress-related diarrhea or anorexia. An appropriate acclimation interval should reflect the particular research protocol as well as the age and status of the ferrets. Young adults are resilient, but weanling and pregnant ferrets require close attention during the first 1 to 2 wk after arrival.\n\nFor ferrets, a lethargic or dehydrated condition is a medical emergency. In such a condition, a balanced electrolyte solution may be administered subcutaneously. Fluid consumption may be encouraged by offering highly palatable oral electrolyte products such as Pedialyte®, or by using multiple methods of water supply such as a water bowl in addition to automatic watering. Most ferrets are raised on automatic watering systems, so specific acclimation should not be necessary except in the case of complications or undue stress in transit.\n\nUse of a familiar diet will ease the transition, especially with young or pregnant ferrets. It is beneficial to offer a moist supplement in addition to a dry diet during the transition (Bell 1999). A thin gruel is made by adding warm water or milk replacer (e.g., kitten milk replacer) to the pelleted diet and offering it 2 to 3 times daily to encourage both food and fluid consumption.\n\nCaging Systems\n\nQuestions regarding optimal caging systems for ferrets are common. In many circumstances, facilities desire to retrofit or adapt caging from other species for ferrets. Rabbit cages are most commonly adapted because the height and square footage are generally suitable. Rabbit and ferret cages may be different with respect to the grid size of enclosure surfaces, including walls and floors. To ensure the safety of weaned and older ferrets, grid openings for all surfaces should not exceed 1 inch square (Fox et al. 2002, Ch. 13). Preweanling ferrets require a grid that does not exceed 1/2 x 1 inch. This safeguard has prompted the retrofitting of some styles of rabbit caging.\n\nBoth suspended and solid flooring are suitable for ferrets. Because ferrets have a strong natural tendency to defecate in the back corners of the cage, suspended floors with 1 inch grids will facilitate passage of stools into the drop pan below. Cages with solid walls, especially those that are designed with a bevel along the bottom, will promote waste-build up and require frequent spot cleaning. Some solid bottom floors may be used if slippage can be avoided or minimized (e.g., using cage floor liners). In this circumstance, it is necessary to provide a litter box, which ferrets can be trained to use relatively easily (Quesenberry and Carpenter 2004, Ch. 1). Ferrets are curious and playful to the point of mischievousness, so it is important to ensure that the cage is escape proof.\n\nRegardless of cage design, it is important to provide an area that accommodates a ferret's instinct for burrowing and hiding, which are examples of species-typical behavior, and its need for resting (Quesenberry and Carpenter 2004, Ch. 1). To accommodate these needs, it is necessary to provide an enclosure with a solid bottom and sides, with or without an overhead cover. Many options exist, including large dog bowls, 4- to 6-inch diameter polyvinyl chloride pipes, fabric ferret hammocks or sleeping bags, and ferret tunneling toys. Play toys may be provided, but due to the ferret's inquisitive behavior, it is imperative to scrutinize toys for safety and from potential ingestion.\n\nAs discussed above (see Arrival and Acclimation), automatic watering is optimal because most ferrets are already acclimated to this system, and mess and wastage are reduced. If bowls are used, they should be heavy crocks to prevent spillage. Feed may be offered via a J-feeder design. It is possible to minimize digging by providing a restricted access opening. If the feeder opens to the outside of the cage, the waist should be sufficiently narrow to preclude escape if the feeder is emptied. Open bowls may be used; however, their use inevitably results in digging and wastage. In addition, the use of a suspended floor design could result in inadvertent food restriction.\n\nSocial and Behavioral Needs\n\nAlthough aggressive behaviors may sometimes be observed in group housing situations (Staton and Crowell-Davis 2003), ferrets in general are social animals and benefit from being in a group (Boyce et al. 2001). Ferrets should be housed in groups or in pairs, and solitary housing should be avoided. As mentioned above (see Transport Containers), exceptions to group housing are adult or breeder hobs (males) and whelping jills (females). Even nonbreeding sexually intact males may be housed together with some supervision. Although males have been observed grasping or biting each other by the nape of the neck, this is actually normal mating behavior and it should be tolerated if it is not excessive. If the animals develop lesions due to excessive biting, it may be necessary to separate them.\n\nSocial hierarchies exist, but usually not to the detriment of an individual animal. Ferrets sleep together in groups, so the rest area that is provided should be sufficient to accommodate all of the inhabitants of a given enclosure.\n\nProperly trained care staff should handle ferrets regularly. This human contact will increase the ability of the animals to remain relaxed and comfortable during subsequent research procedures. Ferrets that are fed and watered daily but not handled regularly tend to become rambunctious and more easily frightened. Such fearful behavior may be evidenced by a vocalization best characterized as a screech. Chuckling or chortling sounds are more indicative of stimulation from play (Boyce et al. 2001).\n\nImmunization\n\nAn immunization program is an important aspect of preventive health care. Ferrets should be protected against canine distemper and rabies. A typical primary immunization protocol for weanling ferrets consists of canine distemper virus vaccination at approximately 6, 9, and 12 wk of age followed by annual booster immunization. Rabies vaccination takes place after 12 wk of age and is also followed by annual booster immunization (Quesenberry and Carpenter 2004, Ch. 2).\n\nThe safety and efficacy of commercial modified live canine distemper vaccines have been studied (Wimsatt et al. 2001). Although only a few vaccines are available, it is advisable to use only those that are licensed and approved for use in ferrets (Greenacre 2003). Presently, a modified live chick embryo vaccine (Fervac D, United Vaccines, Madison, WI) and a recombinant canary pox vectored vaccine (Purevax Ferret, Merial, Duluth, GA) are available. The first rabies vaccine approved for use in ferrets became available in 1990 (Niezgoda et al. 1997). Current recommendations regarding rabies prophylaxis in ferrets are described (Compendium 2006). Presently, there are two approved rabies vaccines available for use in ferrets (Imrab 3 and Imrab 3 TF, Merial, Duluth, GA).\n\nOne safety concern relative to immunization is the occurrence of anaphylactic reactions to one or both of the vaccines described above (Greenacre 2003; Moore et al. 2005). Potential sequelae include vomiting, diarrhea, hypersalivation, and collapse. For this reason, it is important to consider exposure potential and to maintain an available supply of emergency medicines including antihistamines, steroids, and epinephrine. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine has been used for ferrets that have demonstrated allergic signs to previous immunizations (Moore et al. 2005).\n\nPhysical Examination\n\nIn addition to immunization, the performance of routine physical examinations should be part of the health care program of any facility. The procedure with ferrets requires training in proper restraint methods and knowledge of baseline physiological parameters. The vital signs of these animals reflect their high metabolic rate. Normal body temperature ranges from 37.8 to 40°C, normal heart rate is 200 to 400 bpm, and normal respiratory rate is 33 to 36/min (Fox et al. Ch 13, 2002). Published data are available regarding normal values for hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis (Fox 1998, Ch. 7; Morrisey and Ramer 1999).\n\nDuring the physical examination, it is useful to be aware of several ferret behaviors that may confuse the assessment of an animal's state of health. For example, if ferrets are approached while sleeping, it often takes approximately 15 to 30 sec for them to become fully roused. To an inexperienced observer, it may initially appear that the ferret is severely depressed or even comatose. However, this behavior should be considered normal unless it persists. In addition, ferrets often express a shivering behavior that does not necessarily indicate ill health. Although the reason for this behavior is unknown, it may be observed when the ferret awakens from sleep or becomes excited. Finally, if a ferret is restrained by the scruff of the neck, it will often yawn as its body relaxes. Again, the significance of this particular behavioral response is unknown, but handlers should be aware that it is normal (Boyce et al. 2001).\n\nPosterior paresis is a sign that is often interpreted as evidence of neurological disease. In ferrets, it is a presenting sign that may be observed in a variety of states of ill health. Ferrets normally maintain an arched position with their backs, typical of other mustelids such as weasels. When weak or lethargic, regardless of cause, ferrets will lose this arch causing the back to become parallel with the horizontal plane. This posture results in some degree of ataxia of the rear quarters and may be a nonspecific sign. However, it also may be due to central nervous system involvement from systemic illness such as Aleutian parvoviral disease (Quesenberry and Carpenter 2004, Ch. 11).\n\nCommon Diseases\n\nAnother integral part of the health care program is awareness of common ferret diseases. Various infectious and inflammatory diseases may be observed in ferrets in the laboratory. Most neoplastic diseases occur in older animals, but some are observed in young adults.\n\nFerrets are highly susceptible to canine distemper virus. This multisystem disease is virtually 100% fatal and necessitates immunoprophylaxis (Wimsatt et al. 2001). Ferrets are also highly susceptible to human influenza viruses, as described above (see Ferrets as Animal Models in Research). Signs may be similar to distemper but are less severe and with reduced mortality (Fox 1998, Ch. 15). Because of the zoonotic potential, care should be taken to protect workers and animals from influenza through use of appropriate protective clothing and practices such as vaccination (Maher and DeStefano 2004).\n\nEnteric infectious disease in ferrets is commonly observed and may be either viral or bacterial. In neonates, rotavirus infection may cause diarrhea with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated (Fox 1998, Ch. 15). These infections typically occur within the first month of life. Dehydration or secondary bacterial infections may complicate recovery. Coronavirus infection, also termed epizootic catarrhal enteritis or ECE, causes mucoid enteritis with a high level of morbidity and variable mortality. The disease tends to be mild or even subclinical in young kits, with older ferrets showing more severe clinical signs. Supportive care is the only treatment (Williams et al. 2000).\n\nAleutian parvoviral disease has been described as a wasting syndrome in ferrets. This disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of neurological disease with signs of ataxia, paresis, or paralysis (Palley et al. 1992; Welchman et al. 1993).\n\nHelicobacter mustelae infection causes gastrointestinal disease of variable severity including subclinical, chronic, or acute gastritis, gastroduodenal ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma in ferrets (Erdman et al. 1997; Fox et al. 1990, 1997; Patterson et al. 2003). Clinical signs include inappetance, weight loss, tarry stools, severe deterioration, and acute death. Conventionally reared ferrets are presumptively H. mustelae positive, with disease becoming manifest as the result of stresses such as weaning, other illness, or experimental manipulations. Treatment includes use of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and bismuth subsalicylate, often referred to as “triple therapy” (Hillyer and Quesenberry 1997, Ch. 4).\n\nLawsonia intracellularis, previously described as Desulfovibrio spp., is the causative agent for a proliferative colitis syndrome in ferrets that is similar to syndromes observed in swine and hamsters (McOrist et al. 1995). It presents as a wasting disease with progressive weight loss and deterioration and has been noted to respond to chloramphenicol (Fox et al. 1994).\n\nOtodectes cynotis, a common ectoparasite in ferrets, causes ear mite infestation. Treatments that have been described and compared include topical use of ivermectin in propylene glycol (Patterson and Kirchain 1999). Although infestations are usually subclinical, consequences such as otitis may occur.\n\nFerrets appear relatively resistant to helminth infestation; however, routine fecal examinations are useful to verify endoparasite status. Protozoa including Coccidia and Giardia have been described but are usually present subclinically (Fox 1998, Ch. 16). Ferrets are susceptible to heartworm infestation; however, preventive treatment with ivermectin is highly effective (Quesenberry and Carpenter 2004, Ch. 6).\n\nVarious neoplastic diseases may be observed in older ferrets and include adrenal cortical hyperplasia/neoplasia and insulinoma (Wagner et al. 2001; Weiss et al. 1998). Thymic lymphosarcoma occurs in young (usually < 1 yr of age) adult ferrets and has been proposed to have a viral etiology (Batchelder et al. 1996). Other neoplastic diseases have been described (Li et al. 1998).\n\nUrinary tract diseases have also been observed and include cystitis and obstructive uropathy (Coleman et al. 1998; Li et al. 1996; Orcutt 2003). Splenomegaly is a relatively common finding in ferrets and may reflect extramedullary hematopoiesis, anesthetic administration, lymphoid hyperplasia, or lymphoma (Morrisey and Ramer 1999). Gastrointestinal obstruction from foreign bodies, including hairballs, has been described. Conservative treatment with laxatives may be curative; otherwise, surgery is indicated (Quesenberry and Carpenter 2004, Ch. 3).\n\nA polymyositis syndrome has recently been noted in ferrets. Although there are no published studies in the scientific literature to date, various reports have characterized this disease by fever, leukocytosis, hind limb weakness, and death in ferrets less than 1 yr of age (personal communication, B.H. Williams, Department of Telemedicine, US Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC, 2006). As a proposed immune-mediated event, several potential triggers have been suggested including vaccination, viral disease, and genetic predisposition.\n\nTo reiterate, maintenance of an immunization protocol along with regular physical examinations that reflect knowledge of ferret biology, behavior, and disease are integral to optimal health care. For some institutions, it is also necessary to develop a breeding program in support of their research. As described above (see Research-related Ferret Selection Criteria and Biology), some investigators may require ferret neonates for studies such as visual system development. In this circumstance, they may purchase timed pregnant jills, although another alternative is to maintain in-house breeding. If the latter option is chosen, personnel must be knowledgeable and trained in all aspects of ferret breeding and neonatal care.\n\nCare of Pregnant Ferrets\n\nWhether ferrets are bred in-house or purchased as timed pregnant jills, researchers should be aware that pregnant ferrets are subject to pregnancy toxemia. The disease is characterized by anorexia, depression, ketosis, and fatty liver (Batchelder et al. 1999; Dalrymple 2004). This metabolic syndrome is a medical emergency, and mortality of both the jill and kits can occur. Anything that results in anorexia of the jill can precipitate this syndrome through development of a negative energy state, especially in late gestation or with a high fetal burden. In my experience when neonatal ferrets are required for research, pregnant jills are typically requested in late gestation. It is strongly recommended that these animals be received before day 28 of gestation to avoid undue stress.\n\nIt is also very important to ensure that the transition to a new environment is nonstressful. A change of diet is contraindicated during this period. The diet should be made available ad libitum; offering a wet mash supplement of the diet mixed with warm water to a soft consistency will encourage food and water consumption. This supplement may be offered twice daily and should be continued throughout lactation because it will also serve to initiate the weaning process for the kits. If pregnant jills are received at the end of the second trimester, they should be housed in a cage that is suitable for parturition and equipped with a bedded nest.\n\nWhelping and Neonatal Care\n\nThe gestation period for ferrets is 41 to 42 days, with little variation. If parturition begins earlier than 40 or later than 42 days, the prognosis for a successful outcome is guarded. Little can be done to prevent early delivery, other than avoiding stresses and subsequent complications such as pregnancy toxemia. Surgical intervention should be considered if gestation reaches 43 days.\n\nIt is critical to have quiet surroundings during delivery, and the whelp nest should provide privacy for the jill. It is important to monitor parturition to prevent dystocia or entanglement of umbilical cords (Quesenberry and Carpenter 2004, Ch. 5). At the same time, monitoring should involve minimal disturbance to avoid causing the jill to leave the nest and, in extreme cases, to cannibalize her young.\n\nEven once parturition is complete, it is best to continue to minimize disturbances for the next several days. The progress of the litter may be sufficiently ascertained without removing the jill from the nest or handling the kits. After several days, it is safe to perform a closer inspection that includes weight and sex determination of the young. Cage changeover and other noisy or disruptive activities should be planned accordingly.\n\nFerret jills have strong maternal instincts, which make cross-fostering a simple procedure even when delivery dates are not coincident. Cross-fostering is especially useful given the difficulty of hand rearing neonates. Lactating jills tend to be very protective of the kits, so care should be exercised in their handling. Lactation failure may occur but is usually secondary to problems such as inadequate food or water intake, stress, or illness. Mastitis may also occur and is usually caused by β-hemolytic E. coli. Systemic illness in both the jill and kits may occur. Antibiotics and supportive care are often required, and cross-fostering may be necessary (Marini et al. 2004). Vendors should provide only pregnant jills that have a history of successful delivery and lactation to minimize complications.\n\nHandling and Restraint\n\nProper handling and restraint techniques are crucial not only for husbandry (see Social and Behavioral Needs) but also for the conduct of experimental procedures (Moody et al. 1985). Ferrets are used in a wide variety of research applications, so handling requirements may vary. For example, when ferrets are used in an acute surgical procedure, it may be necessary to handle them only for a preanesthetic physical examination and for injection of a sedative or anesthetic induction agent. For survival surgery, especially for major invasive procedures, extensive handling is required, which includes preoperative blood work and daily postoperative observations and treatments. Regardless, the key to successful nonstressful handling is acclimation of the ferret to whatever method of restraint will be required. This goal should be accomplished well in advance of initiation of the experimental procedure. Otherwise, especially with young ferrets, their rambunctious behavior may make handling difficult.\n\nFerrets are easily removed from their cage or other enclosure by being grasped by one hand around the thorax, although large males may require the use of both hands. For more complete restraint, the ferret may be grasped by the skin at the base of the neck, a procedure called scruffing. Ferrets may be retrieved from their cage in this manner or carried to a treatment table and then scruffed because the flat solid surface of the examination table facilitates grasping the ferret. As stated above (see Physical Examination), this method of restraint often produces a relaxation response that is accompanied by a yawn. It is useful for examination, oral dosing, or administration of injections. Another effective and nonstressful method of restraint involves tucking the ferret “head first” against one's waist using the crook of one's arm. Hugging the ferret in this manner appears to offer them security, which minimizes resistance. This method of restraint is particularly useful for taking a rectal temperature or giving an intramuscular injection (Scipioni Ball 2002).\n\nAnesthesia and Euthanasia\n\nAs outlined above (see Ferrets as Animal Models in Biomedical Research), ferrets are used in a variety of research applications that require anesthesia for surgery or other experimental procedures. Research includes cardiovascular, respiratory, and skeletal studies, among others. Ferrets have been described as hardy animals that make excellent surgical candidates (Mullen and Beeber 2000). Isoflurane anesthesia is often preferred, but numerous sedative and anesthetic protocols, both injectable and inhalation, have been reported (Fox 1998, Ch. 19; Mullen and Beeber 2000; Quesenberry and Carpenter 2004, Ch. 33).\n\nPerioperative considerations for ferrets are similar to those of other laboratory species, albeit with some exceptions. Because of ferret gastrointestinal physiology (see Dietary Requirements), the preoperative fast interval should be short (∼ 3 hr), especially for compromised subjects. Due to their small body size, pediatric endotracheal tubes are needed as well as a nonrebreathing system for inhalational anesthesia. Intraoperative monitoring (e.g., pulse oximetry and capnography) has been described (Olin et al. 1997). Postperative analgesics should be used preemptively and routinely, and a description of analgesic options is available (Fox 1998, Ch. 19). Techniques such as epidural narcotic administration have been assessed (Sladky et al. 2000). Ferrets are prone to hypothermia, especially during prolonged procedures. Use of warmed fluids and circulating warm water heating pads help prevent loss of body temperature (Fox 1998, Ch. 19).\n\nHumane euthanasia may be achieved by using injectable sedation or anesthesia followed by barbiturate euthanasia. The 2000 Report of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia (AVMA 2001) should be utilized for guidance on appropriate and humane methods of euthanasia."
