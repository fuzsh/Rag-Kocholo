        "text": "President Franklin D. Roosevelt signs into law legislation creating the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (converted into the Women’s Army Corps in 1943).\n\nThe S-1 Executive Committee recommends building a pilot plant based on Ernest O. Lawrence’s cyclotrons to separate uranium isotopes in Tennessee.\n\nStarting on this date, and continuing until November 15, Enrico Fermi’s group receives shipments of uranium and graphite for CP-1 and prepares them for assembly.\n\nCol. Leslie Groves is notified at 10:30 a.m. by Gen. Brehon Somervell that his assignment overseas has been cancelled and that he will take another assignment – command of the Manhattan Engineer District. Groves’ previous assignment had required overseeing ten billion dollars’ worth of construction projects, including the construction of the Pentagon.\n\nCol. Leslie Groves buys 1250 tons of high quality Belgian Congo uranium ore stored on Staten Island.\n\nCol. Leslie Groves selects Oak Ridge, TN as the site for the pilot plant. He buys Site X, 52,000 acres of land on the Clinch River. Preliminary construction work begins soon after.\n\nAt Col. Leslie Groves’ insistence the Manhattan Project is granted approval by the War Production Board to use the highest emergency procurement priority in existence (AAA) when needed.\n\nCol. Leslie Groves is promoted to Brigadier General.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer proposes that a “fast-neutron lab” to study fast neutron physics and develop designs for an atomic bomb be created. The idea at this point is for the lab to be a small research institution that would not be involved in the engineering and production of nuclear weapons.\n\nGen. Leslie Groves puts DuPont in charge of the plutonium production project.\n\nJames B. Conant recommends to Vannevar Bush that information exchange with Britain, already largely one-way (UK –> US), be sharply restricted. Bush passes this recommendation to President Roosevelt. As a result the US loses access to British work in gaseous diffusion, which seriously delays successful plant completion.\n\nCentrifuge separation is abandoned due to technical problems.\n\nGen. Leslie Groves visits the Chicago Met Lab and meets the key scientists, including J. Robert Oppenheimer. He orders key engineering decisions for plutonium production, under debate for months, be made in 5 days.\n\nGen. Leslie Groves asks J. Robert Oppenheimer to head Project Y, planned to be the new central laboratory for weapon physics research and design.\n\nVannevar Bush approves J. Robert Oppenheimer’s appointment in meeting with Oppenheimer and Gen. Leslie Groves.\n\nGlenn Seaborg reports that due to plutonium’s high alpha activity, slight amounts of light element impurities can cause a serious problem with neutron emission from alpha -> n reactions. This issue caused major concern with many project leaders, including Leslie Groves and James B. Conant, not only due to its own significance, but because it raised apprehension about the impact of other unexplored phenomena. (This issue later became moot due to the problems with Pu-240 contamination). Later in the month the Lewis Committee is formed to review progress and make recommendations.\n\nThe Military Policy Commission decides to skip the pilot plant stages and go directly from research to industrial-scale production.\n\nEnrico Fermi’s group begins constructing Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field using round-the-clock shifts. Also, Groves and Oppenheimer visit the Los Alamos, NM mesa in New Mexico and select it for “Site Y.”\n\nGeneral Leslie Groves selects Los Alamos, NM as the site for a scientific research laboratory, codenamed “Project Y”. J. Robert Oppenheimer is selected as laboratory director.\n\nDuring this month the work on gaseous diffusion is reorganized. On the strength of the Lewis Committee’s recommendation, gaseous diffusion is chosen as the principal enrichment approach. Kellex Corporation, a subsidiary of Kellog is created to build a plant, Percival Keith is put in charge. Contracts are put in place, and hiring begins for plant construction. Kellex immediately begins work on a process for producing usable barrier material on an industrial scale.\n\nVannevar Bush provides Roosevelt with an estimate placing the total cost for the Manhattan Project at $400 million (almost 5 times the previous estimate). Roosevelt approves the expenditure.\n\nPlans and contracts are made for the construction of an experimental reactor, plutonium separation plant, and Electromagnetic separation facility at Oak Ridge, TN.\n\nAfter 17 days of work, Enrico Fermi’s group completes Chicago Pile-1. It contains 36.6 metric tons of uranium oxide, 5.6 metric tons of uranium metal, and 350 metric tons of graphite. Construction is halted sooner than planned when Fermi projects that a critical configuration has been reached.\n\nAt 3:49 p.m., CP-1 goes critical. It demonstrates a k value of 1.0006, and is allowed to reach a thermal output of 0.5 watts (ultimately it operates at 200 watts maximum). This is the first sustained nuclear fission chain-reaction with the Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1).\n\nM. M. Sundt Company is appointed contractor to build Los Alamos Laboratory in a handshake deal. Sundt begins construction immediately, without plans or blueprints in order to finish as quickly as possible.\n\nGeneral Leslie Groves selects Hanford, WA as a site for plutonium production.\n\nThe Soviet Union secretly launches its own atomic program under the direction of Igor Kurchatov. The program was extremely limited throughout the war and included no more than fifty personnel.\n\nConstruction begins at Oak Ridge, TN on buildings for the Y-12 Plant — the electromagnetic U-235 separation plant.\n\nThe original construction program nears completion, and staff begins arriving at Los Alamos, NM to begin operations. From this point on the site grows non-stop through the end of the war.\n\nRichard Tolman writes J. Robert Oppenheimer about using explosives to collapse a shell into a critical mass. This is the earliest surviving reference to the idea of implosion (although this term was not used).\n\nLos Alamos, NM provides its scientists introductory lectures on nuclear physics and bomb design.\n\nAt the beginning of the month the original building plan for Los Alamos, NM is 96% complete. It is already apparent that the original construction program is inadequate to meet needs.\n\nA series of staff conferences among the roughly 100 scientific staff members are held at Los Alamos, NM. These include indoctrination lectures by Robert Serber (later published as The Los Alamos Primer) on April 5, 7, 9, 12, and 14; and meetings to plan the laboratory’s work from April 15 through May 6. The laboratory’s initial organization and leadership is worked out.\n\nSeth Neddermeyer begins research on implosion, seeking to compress hollow metal assemblies.\n\nHans Bethe is selected over Edward Teller to head the theoretical division. Teller is soon placed in charge of lower priority research on fusion weapons.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer projects that 100 g of 25% enriched U-235 will be produced by Electromagnetic Separation by 1 Jan. 1944.\n\nBy the end of the March planning sessions, the necessity of including ordnance development activity at Los Alamos was apparent. This greatly expanded the scope of work undertaken at the laboratory to engineering development, and eventually acting as prime contractor for weapon production, and manufacturer of key weapon components (including all nuclear components, and the implosion system).\n\nFencing of the reservation completed — Oak Ridge, TN is closed off to public access. Also, construction begins on plant for manufacturing gaseous diffusion barriers in Decatur, IL although no barrier materials of usable quality have yet been produced.\n\nA contract is concluded with the University of California to manage Los Alamos, NM acting as paymaster, accountant, and procurement agency. This contract (back dated to Jan. 1 for work already performed) served as the basis for University of California management of both the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore laboratories.\n\nThe Los Alamos, NM review committee approves the laboratory’s research program.\n\nSurveying begins for the K-25 Plant, the gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment plant at Oak Ridge, TN.\n\nK-25 Plant construction begins in Oak Ridge, TN.\n\nNavy Capt. William Parsons arrives at Los Alamos, NM as Ordnance Division leader to begin directing gun assembly research.\n\nWorking with cyclotron produced plutonium, Emilio Segre determines that the spontaneous fission rate is 5 fissions/kg-sec. This is well within the assembly speed capability of a high speed gun.\n\nSeth Neddermeyer conducts first explosion in the implosion research program (currently consisting of Neddermeyer, and 3 informal assistants).\n\nThe first nuclear physics experiment is conducted at Los Alamos, NM (the measurement of Pu-239 fission neutron yield), inaugurating it as a functioning laboratory.\n\nDespite the efforts of more than 1000 researchers at Kellex and Columbia University, no suitable gaseous diffusion barrier material has yet been developed.\n\nDue to lagging progress on gaseous diffusion, and continuing uncertainties about the required amount of U-235 for a bomb, General Leslie Groves decides to double the size of the Y-12 Plant.\n\nThe first Alpha Electromagnetic Separation unit for uranium begins operation. Construction staff at Oak Ridge, TN now exceeds 20,000. Also, construction begins on the cooling systems for the production reactors at Hanford, WA. Construction staff is about 5,000.\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill sign the Quebec Agreement.\n\nItaly surrenders to Allied forces.\n\nFirst shot fired in gun assembly research program at Los Alamos, NM. The focus at this point is on developing a high velocity gun for plutonium since a uranium gun would be much easier to make.\n\nJohn von Neumann arrives on a visit to Los Alamos, NM and points out the potential for high compression from implosion. This is a clear advantage for the technique which would make a bomb more efficient, and require a smaller critical mass. Edward Teller and Hans Bethe begin investigating the subject theoretically, J. Robert Oppenheimer and General Leslie Groves become very interested in its potential, and efforts to accelerate the program begin. John von Neumann agrees to work on the physics of implosion in his spare time.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer suggests recruiting George Kistiakowsky, the leading explosives research director at The Office of Scientific Research and Development, to aid an expanded implosion effort.\n\nThe first Alpha racetrack (containing 96 units) is completed. A work force of 4800 to run the Y-12 Plant has been assembled. Startup is unsuccessful due to unexplained shorts in the magnets.\n\nProject Alberta, the full scale atomic bomb delivery program, begins. Norman Ramsey appointed to select and modify aircraft for delivering atomic bombs.\n\nDuPont engineers release reactor design drawings for the first Hanford, WA plutonium production pile, 100-B, allowing construction to begin.\n\nSite preparation starts for the B-100 plutonium production reactor, B Reactor, at Hanford, WA.\n\nFirst concrete is poured for the K-25 Plant building at Oak Ridge, TN.\n\nThe top experts in England on fission weapons, many former members of the MAUD committee, depart England for the US to assist the atomic bomb project. Included are Niels Bohr, Otto Frisch, Rudolf Peierls, James Chadwick, William Penney, George Placzek, Philip B. Moon, James Tuck, Egon Bretscher, and Klaus Fuchs.\n\nThe Navy approves Philip Abelson’s plan to build a liquid thermal diffusion pilot plant for enriching uranium, the S-50 Plant.\n\nThe world’s first sample of plutonium in metal form is produced by reducing PuF4 with Ba at the Chicago Met Lab.\n\nThe X-10 Graphite Reactor pile goes critical at Oak Ridge, TN. This air-cooled experimental pile begins producing the first substantial (gram) amounts of plutonium to assist research into its properties. The world supply of plutonium at this time is 2.5 mg, produced by cyclotrons. Also, a Manhattan Project Governing Board meeting approves an ambitious implosion research program, intended to develop it to the point of usability in six months.\n\nThe first B-29 modifications begin at Wright Field, Ohio to adapt it for carrying atomic bombs.\n\nAfter attempts to bring the first Alpha racetrack into operation fail, the Y-12 Plant is shut down for equipment rebuilding.\n\nEmilio Segre measures the spontaneous fission rate of U-235 at Los Alamos, NM, and finds it lower than expected. This allows a substantial reduction in performance of the planned gun assembly method for uranium.\n\nChemical separation of reactor-produced plutonium begins, using fuel from the X-10 Graphite Reactor pile.\n\nGeorge Kistiakowsky arrives at Los Alamos, NM to assist Seth Neddermeyer in implosion research. It becomes increasingly clear that Neddermeyer’s academic research style is unsuited to directing a rapidly expanding research and engineering program.\n\nProblems with developing suitable diffusion barriers leads General Leslie Groves to switch planned production to a new type of barrier, creating months of delays in equipping the K-25 Plant for operation.\n\nPhilip Abelson, after learning about the problems with the Manhattan Project’s gaseous diffusion plant, informs J. Robert Oppenheimer about the progress in his research on liquid thermal diffusion technology. This eventually leads to the construction of the S-50 Plant at Oak Ridge.\n\nGeneral Leslie Groves and J. Robert Oppenheimer decide to plan for a fission bomb test (none was envisioned before this). Groves stipulates that the active material must be recoverable if a fizzle occurs, so the construction of Jumbo, a 214 ton steel container (25 ft x 12 ft), is authorized.\n\nThe S-50 Plant begins partial operation at Oak Ridge, TN, but leaks prevent substantial output.\n\nAn implosion theory group is set up with Edward Teller as head.\n\nWith the concrete building to house it complete, construction begins on the first reactor at Hanford, WA, the B Reactor.\n\nThe Los Alamos Governing Board reevaluates deuterium fusion research and determines that tritium would be necessary to make an explosive reaction. Priority of fusion bomb work is further downgraded.\n\nThe Y-12 Plant sends 200 grams of uranium-235 to Los Alamos, NM.\n\nGeorge Kistiakowsky becomes a full-time Los Alamos staff member, replacing Seth Neddermeyer as leader of implosion research.\n\nSix months after the start of accelerated implosion research, little progress towards successful implosion has been made. Inadequate diagnostic equipment prevent accurate measurement of implosion process, and no scheme to avoid asymmetry has yet shown promise. The current approach is to use many simultaneous detonation points over the surface of a sphere, and try different methods of inert spacers or gaps to suppress the shaped charge-like jets that form when detonation waves from adjacent initiation points merge. Spalling (the ejection of fragments) from the interior surface of the hollow core is a serious problem, as is simply getting precise simultaneous detonation.\n\nEmilio Segre has improved his spontaneous fission estimates in cyclotron plutonium (essentially pure Pu-239) to 11 fissions/kg-sec. This is still acceptable for gun assembly, but greatly narrows the margin of security.\n\nDrop tests of dummy atomic bombs begin from specially modified B-29s at Wendover, Utah.\n\nIBM calculating equipment arrives at Los Alamos, NM and is put to work on implosion research.\n\nJames Tuck suggests idea of using explosive lenses to create spherical converging implosion waves.\n\nMonsanto at Dayton, OH begins delivering polonium for initiator research. The rate is initially 2.5 curies/month.\n\nOn April 5 the first sample of reactor produced plutonium arrives from Oak Ridge, TN. Emilio Segre immediately begins monitoring its spontaneous fission rate. By April 15 he makes a preliminary estimate of a spontaneous fission rate of over 50 fissions/kg-sec (due to Pu-240 contamination), far too high for gun assembly. The report is kept quiet due to limited statistics, and observations continue.\n\nLos Alamos, NM staff exceeds 1200 employees.\n\nEdward Teller is removed as head of the implosion theory group, and also from fission weapon research entirely, due to conflicts with Hans Bethe and his increasing obsession with the idea of the Super (hydrogen bomb).\n\nTwo British scientists join Los Alamos, NM, and prove to have important impacts on the implosion program. Geoffrey Taylor (arrived May 24) points out implosion instability problems (especially the Rayleigh-Taylor instability), which ultimately leads to a very conservative design to minimize possible instability. James Tuck brings the idea of explosives lenses for detonation wave shaping (2-D lenses for plane wave generation originally proposed by M. J. Poole in England, 1942), but suggests developing 3-D lenses to create a spherical implosion.\n\nThe 50 milliwatt Water Boiler reactor goes critical at Los Alamos, NM. Holding 565 g of U-235 (in the form of 14.7% enriched uranyl sulfate), dissolved in a 12″ sphere of water, this is the world’s first reactor to use enriched uranium, and the first critical assembly constructed at Los Alamos.\n\nFirst test of the exploding wire detonator, used to achieve precise, reliable simultaneous detonation for implosion.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer replaces Seth Neddermeyer with George Kistiakowsky as director of implosion research.\n\nHans Bethe and Rudolf Peierls work on developing explosive lens concept.\n\nJohn von Neumann provides design breakthrough for the slow component for focusing.\n\nAfter visiting the uranium enrichment pilot plant at the Naval Research Laboratory, a team of Manhattan Project experts recommends that a liquid thermal diffusion plant be built to feed enriched material to the electromagnetic enrichment plant at Oak Ridge, the S-50 Plant.\n\nAllied forces launch the Normandy invasion.\n\nGeneral Leslie Groves contracts to have the S-50 Plant, intended for liquid thermal diffusion uranium enrichment, built at Oak Ridge, TN in no more than three months.\n\nExperiments with explosive lens designs begin by mid-month when 2-D models are fired.\n\nThe design for the gun gadget neutron initiator is completed.\n\nScientists at the Chicago Met Lab issue the “Prospectus on Nucleonics,” which concerns the international control of atomic energy.\n\nAir Force Lt. Col. Paul Tibbets begins organizing the 509th Composite Group, which will deliver atomic bombs in combat, at Wendover Field, Utah.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer reveals Emilio Segre’s spontaneous fission measurements to the Los Alamos, NM staff. The neutron emission for reactor-produced plutonium is too high for gun assembly to work. The measured rate is 50 fissions/kg-sec, the fission rate in Hanford, WA plutonium is expected to be over 100 times higher still. The discovery of the high spontaneous fission rate of reactor-produced plutonium was a turning point for Los Alamos, NM, the Manhattan Project, and eventually for the practice of large-scale science after the war. The planned plutonium gun had to be abandoned, and J. Robert Oppenheimer was forced to make implosion research a top priority, using all available resources to attack it. A complete reorganization of Los Alamos Laboratory is required. With just 12 months to go before expected weapon delivery a new fundamental technology, explosive wave shaping, has to be invented, made reliable, and an enormous array of engineering problems had to be solved. During this crisis the many foundations for post-war science were laid. Scientist-administrators (as opposed to academic or research scientists) came to the forefront for running large scale research efforts. Automated numerical techniques (as opposed to manual analytical ones) were applied to solve important scientific problems, not just engineering applications. The dispersal of key individuals after the end of the war later carried these insights, as well as the earlier organizational principles developed at Los Alamos throughout American academia and industry.\n\nThe Air Force begins modifying 17 B-29s for combat delivery of atomic weapons at the Glenn L. Martin plant in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nDeak Parsons assesses February 1945 as the earliest an implosion lens system can be ready for full scale test “with extremely good breaks”, and most likely late 1945.\n\nA. Francis Birch takes over the uranium gun project.\n\nAt this point the K-25 Plant is half built, but no usable diffusion barriers have been produced. The Y-12 Plant is operating at only 0.05% efficiency. The total production of highly enriched uranium to date is a few grams.\n\nDuring the fall Robert Christy suggests the “Christy gadget”, the use of a solid core that is raised to supercriticality solely by compressing the metal to twice normal density. This conservative implosion design avoids instability and spalling problems, but the period of maximum compression is brief and requires a “modulated initiator” (a neutron generator that emits a burst at a precise moment). Earlier shell designs could have relied on spontaneous fission and still achieved reasonable efficiency.\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill sign the Hyde Park aide-memoire, pledging to continue researching atomic technology.\n\nThe first RaLa implosion test shot is made in Los Alamos, NM. This diagnostic technique used 100 curies of radiolanthanum produced by the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, TN to provide an intense gamma source for making observations of implosion (essentially an internal x-ray generator). This is the largest radioisotope source ever assembled in the world up to this time.\n\nLoading uranium into the first full scale plutonium reactor, the B Reactor, at Hanford, WA is completed. This reactor contains 200 tons of uranium metal, 1200 tons of graphite, and is cooled by 5 m^3 of water/sec. It designed to operate at 250 megawatts, producing some 6 kg of plutonium a month. Fermi supervises reactor start-up.\n\nAfter several hours of operation at 100 megawatts, the B Reactor pile inexplicably shuts down, then starts up again by itself the next day. Within a few days this is determined to be due to poisoning by the highly efficient neutron absorber Xenon-135, a radioactive fission product. The reactor must be modified to add extra reactivity to overcome this effect before production can begin.\n\nThe first B-29s arrive in the Mariana Islands to begin bombing Japan. Japan has so far remained free from air attacks (except for the symbolic Doolittle raid in 1942).\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer approves plans for a bomb test in the Jornada del Muerto valley at the Alamagordo Bombing Range. General Leslie Groves approves 5 days later, provided that the test be conducted in Jumbo.\n\nY-12 Plant output has reached 40 grams of highly enriched uranium a day.\n\nThe first B-29 raid on Japan begins. 100 planes are launched, only 16 bombs hit the target factory.\n\nY-12 Plant output climbs to 90 grams of highly enriched uranium a day.\n\nWork begins on an implosion initiator for the solid core bomb, it is not clear at this point if one can be made.\n\nFirst successful explosive lens tests conducted at Los Alamos, NM, establishing the feasibility of making an implosion bomb.\n\nPolish Physicist Joseph Rotblat resigns from the Manhattan Project upon learning that an American atomic bomb will not be used against Nazi Germany.\n\nThe D pile goes critical at Hanford, WA with sufficient reactivity to overcome fission product poisoning effects. Large scale plutonium production begins.\n\nFirst Fat Man bomb assembly is completed as production gets underway. Explosive lenses and nuclear material are not yet available, the bomb assemblies are used for airdrop and ground handling practice.\n\nProcessing of irradiated uranium slugs to separate plutonium begins at Hanford, WA.\n\nThe modified B Reactor pile is restarted.\n\nY-12 Plant output reaches an average of 204 grams of 80% U-235 a day; projected production of sufficient material for a bomb (~40 kg) is July 1.\n\nUsable barrier tubes begin arriving at the K-25 Plant.\n\n160 g of plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor is on hand at Los Alamos, NM. The first shipment from Hanford, WA has not yet arrived.\n\nSubstantial production of ~0.85% enriched uranium begins at the S-50 Plant, with ten of 21 racks going in to operation.\n\nThe Dragon experiment conducted by Otto Frisch, in which a U-235 hydride slug is dropped through a barely subcritical U-235 hydride assembly, creates the world’s first assembly critical through prompt neutrons alone (prompt critical). The largest energy production for a drop is 20 megawatts for 3 milliseconds (the temperature rises 6 degrees C in that time).\n\nCurtis LeMay takes command of the Twentieth Air Force in the Marianas. The fleet contains 345 aircraft, but in three months of bombing none of the nine top priority targets have been destroyed. Also, the first stage of the K-25 Plant is charged with uranium hexafluoride and begins operation.\n\nRobert Bacher reports to Oppenheimer that a Po-210/Be-9 implosion initiator (still to be designed) is possible.\n\nInitiator tests begin. Demand for polonium from Dayton, OH rises to 100 curies/month.\n\nAdmiral Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, is notified of the nature of the atomic bomb project.\n\nTinian Island is selected as the base of operations for atomic attack.\n\nThe F reactor goes on-line at Hanford, WA, raising theoretical production capacity to 21 kg/month.\n\nUranium gun design is completed and frozen. Only planning for deployment and combat use once the U-235 is delivered is now required (although studies of an improved gun design, begun on Dec. 7 and later abandoned, are underway).\n\nPlanning for an implosion bomb test begins in earnest.\n\nLos Alamos, NM receives its first plutonium from Hanford, WA.\n\nDresden, Germany is burned down in an incendiary raid killing 50,000.\n\nMarines land on Iwo Jima, a Japanese observation post for the B-29 raids. Over the next two months 6,281 marines are killed, and 21,865 are wounded in capturing the island from 20,000 defenders.\n\nFirst stage of the K-25 Plant begins operating.\n\nA fire bomb test raid on Tokyo with 172 planes burns one square mile, the most destructive raid on Japan to date.\n\nA meeting between J. Robert Oppenheimer, General Leslie Groves, George Kistiakowsky, James B. Conant, Richard Tolman, Hans Bethe, and Charles Lauritsen is held to fix the design approach for the plutonium bomb. It is agreed that work will focus on the solid core Christy gadget, use explosive lenses, use a modulated initiator, and electric detonators. The use of Composition B and Baratol for the lenses was also decided, as was the multiple lens configuration and detonator arrangement. However none of these approaches or components have been proved yet. Solid core compression has not been demonstrated at this time. A schedule for completing research, development, engineering, and testing is also established. The (partial) goals are:Solve detonator timing problem, have detonators in full production, and begin large-scale lens production (Apr 15).Begin hemisphere shots to measure shock wave convergence (Apr 25).Demonstrate implosion compression in full scale test (May 15).Begin lens fabrication for The Trinity Test (June 4).Begin assembly of The Trinity Test Gadget (July 4).\n\nThe powerful Cowpuncher Committee is organized to “ride herd” on implosion bomb development.\n\nThe first evidence of solid compression from implosion is observed (5%).\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer officially freezes explosive lens design.\n\nGeneral Curtis LeMay launches an all-out low altitude firebomb raid on Tokyo with 334 B-29s. Flames engulf 15.8 square miles of the city, killing about 100,000 people and injuring 1,000,000 (41,000 seriously).\n\nDuring these eight days fire raids with similar tactics are launched on Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe; the second, third, and fourth largest cities in Japan. An additional 16 square miles of city are burned, killing more than 50,000 people.\n\nK-25 Plant begins production in Oak Ridge, TN.\n\nAll 21 racks at the thermal diffusion sector at the S-50 Plant finally in operation.\n\nPreparations begin at Tinian Island to support the 509th Composite Group, and to assemble the atomic bombs.\n\nRobert Oppenheimer reports that George Kistiakowsky has achieved optimal performance with implosion compression in sub-scale tests.\n\nOtto Frisch completes criticality and “zero-yield” experiments with U-235 at Los Alamos, NM. Also, President Roosevelt dies and Harry S. Truman become president.\n\nPresident Harry Truman learns of the existence of atomic bomb development from Secretary of War Henry Stimson.\n\nThe first meeting of the Target Committee to select targets for atomic bombing. Seventeen targets are selected for study: Tokyo Bay (for a non-lethal demonstration), Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, Hiroshima, Kokura, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, and Sasebo (some of these are soon dropped because they had already been burned down).\n\nInitiator Committee (Hans Bethe, Enrico Fermi and Robert Christy) selects the most promising design for fission initiator (neutron generator) to be used in the implosion bomb. The “Urchin” design is favored, and work on initiator fabrication begins. Also, first batch of supplies for the atomic bomb deployment leaves for Tinian Island from Wendover, Utah.\n\nLittle Boy is ready for combat use, except for the U-235 core. It is estimated sufficient material will be available by 1 August.\n\nCritical mass tests with plutonium begin at Los Alamos, NM.\n\nThe first Raytheon Mark II X-Unit arrives for detonation testing.\n\nThe 100-ton test is conducted. 108 tons of TNT, laced with 1000 curies of reactor fission products, are exploded 800 yards from Trinity ground zero to test instrumentation for The Trinity Test. This is the largest instrumented explosion conducted up to this date. Also, Nazi Germany surrenders to the Allies.\n\nGeneral procedures for atomic bombing are completed by D.M. Dennison, under Deak Parsons.\n\nTarget Committee reconvenes. On the committee now are J. Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann, Deak Parsons, and Hans Bethe. Meeting discusses issues combat employment of atomic bombs (e.g. proper burst height, etc.). Target list is shortened to Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, and Kokura Arsenal (Niigata is considered).\n\n464 B-29s raid Tokyo again, burning out nearly 16 square miles of the remaining city. Only a few thousand are killed, urban inhabitants have learned to flee fire bomb attacks quickly and escape the flames. Also, Operation OLYMPIC, the invasion of Kyushu (the southern Japanese island), is set for November 1.\n\nTarget Committee meets with Lt. Col. Paul Tibbets in attendance. The meeting reviews preparation for delivering atomic bombs, and status of conventional bombing of Japan. Tibbets estimates that by Jan. 1, 1946 all major cities of Japan will have been destroyed by fire bombing. The target list is now Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Niigata.\n\nSecretary of War Henry Stimson rules out Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan, as a target for atomic attack.\n\nCurtis LeMay estimates that the Twentieth Air Force will finish destroying the 60 most important cities in Japan by Oct. 1. Also, the T-5 group in the Los Alamos T (Theory) Division estimates The Trinity Test explosion yield at 4-13 Kt.\n\nScientists begin circulating Franck Report, which urges demonstration of the bomb prior to military use.\n\nThe Interim Committee, organized to guide the final conduct of the war and the post-war reconstruction and led by Secretary of State Designate James Byrnes, issues the recommendations that the atomic bomb be dropped as soon as possible, that an urban area be the target, and that no prior warning be given.\n\n509th Composite Group crews begin arriving on Tinian Island with their modified B-29s.\n\nGeneral Leslie Groves submits the target selections to General George Marshall.\n\nThe Scientific Panel of the Interim Committee, which includes Enrico Fermi, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Arthur Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, reports that it sees “no acceptable alternative” to the use of an atomic weapon against Japan.\n\nThe first implosion initiator is ready.\n\nThe Interim Committee rejects The Franck Report.\n\nOtto Frisch confirms that the implosion core design is satisfactory after criticality tests.\n\nThe United Nations charter is signed by delegates of fifty nations.\n\nGeneral Leslie Groves meets with J. Robert Oppenheimer and Deak Parsons to plan delivery of atomic bombs to the Pacific theater.\n\nFinal preparations begin at the New Mexico test site, the Jornada del Muerto at the Alamagordo Bombing Range, for the first atomic bomb test, code named Trinity. The date is set for July 16. Jumbo is not used in the test, since plutonium delivery schedules make recovery of active material (in the event of a fizzle) less important.\n\nCasting of the U-235 projectile for Little Boy is completed.\n\nMachining of the uranium reflector for The Trinity Test completed.\n\nExplosives lens casting for The Trinity Test completed.\n\nThe best available lens castings are selected for The Trinity Test.\n\nAssembly of Gadget, the first atomic bomb begins. Also, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo cables Ambassador Naotake Sato in Moscow advising him to explore using the USSR as an intermediary in surrender negotiations.\n\nThe plutonium core and the Gadget components leave Los Alamos, NM for the test site separately. Assembly of Gadget begins at 1300 hours on July 13. Assembly of Gadget’s explosive lens, uranium reflector, and plutonium core is completed at Ground Zero at 1745 hours.\n\nGadget is hoisted to the top of the 100 foot test tower, and the detonators are installed and connected. Final test preparations begin. Meanwhile, Little Boy bomb units, accompanied by the U-235 projectile, are shipped out of San Francisco on the USS Indianapolis for Tinian Island. Lastly, the only full-scale test of the implosion lens system (before Gadget) is conducted. Initial analysis indicates failure. Bethe later corrects mistaken calculations and finds that the measurements are consistent with optimum performance.\n\nAt 5:29:45 a.m., as part of The Trinity Test, Gadget is detonated in Alamogordo, NM in the first atomic explosion in history. The explosive yield is 20-22 Kt (initially estimated at 18.9 Kt), vaporizing the steel tower.\n\nPotsdam conference of President Harry Truman, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (succeeded on July 28 by Clement Attlee), and Soviet Premier Josef Stalin begins.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer suggests to General Leslie Groves that the U-235 from Little Boy be reworked into uranium/plutonium composite cores for making more implosion bombs (4 implosion bombs could be made from Little Boy’s pit). Groves rejects the idea since it would delay combat use.\n\nThe 509th Composite Group begins flying practice missions over Japan.\n\nSecretary of War Henry Stimson, in Potsdam for meeting between President Truman and Soviet Premier Stalin, receives current target list. In order of choice it is: Hiroshima, Kokura, and Niigata. He also receives an estimate of atomic bomb availability: Little Boy should be ready for use on Aug. 6, second Fat Man-type by Aug. 24, 3 should be available in September, and more each month – reaching 7 or more in December. Also, first A-bomb test unit dropped by 509th at Tinian, and combat hemispheres for Fat Man are fabricated.\n\nPresident Truman discloses the existence of the atomic bomb to Stalin (who had already been informed about it by his spies). Meanwhile, General Leslie Groves drafts the directive authorizing the use of the atomic bombs as soon as bomb availability and weather permit. It lists the following targets in order of priority: Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki. This directive constitutes final authorization for atomic attack, no further orders are issued. Also, The U-235 target for Little Boy is cast at Los Alamos, NM.\n\nPeer de Silva, the official courier for the Fat Man core, signs for 6.1 kg of plutonium at Los Alamos, NM.\n\nPresident Truman issues the Potsdam Declaration, which warns Japan of “prompt and utter destruction” and requires unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces. USS Indianapolis delivers Little Boy bomb units, and the U-235 projectile to Tinian Island. Five C-54 transport planes leave Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque with: the Little Boy U-235 target (its final component); the Fat Man plutonium core, and its initiator.\n\nThe Japanese government rejects the Potsdam surrender demand. Also, the five C-54 transports arrive at Tinian. All components for Little Boy are now on site, but no Fat Man bomb assemblies have yet arrived.\n\nThe nuclear components (target, projectile, and 4 initiators) are inserted into bomb unit number L11.\n\nThe assembly of Little Boy is completed. It is ready for use the next day.\n\nA typhoon approaching Japan prevents launching an attack with Little Boy. Several days are required for weather to clear.\n\nFat Man bomb cases F-31 and F-32 arrive on Tinian. Fat Man assembly begins. Bombing date is set for August 11.\n\nLt. Col. Paul Tibbets briefs the 509th Composite Group about the impending attack. He reveals that they will drop immensely powerful bombs, but the nature of the weapons are not revealed.\n\nAt 1500 Gen. Curtis LeMay officially confirms the mission for the next day. Lt. Col. Paul Tibbets will take over as pilot, Deak Parsons will fly as weaponeer. Lt. Col. Paul Tibbets names B-29 No. 82 the “Enola Gay” after his mother, over the objections of its pilot Robert Lewis. Little Boy is loaded on the plane. Also, Dummy Fat Man unit F33 (complete except for plutonium core) is prepared for practice bombing run.\n\n0000: Final briefing, the target of choice is Hiroshima. Lt. Col. Paul Tibbets is pilot, Robert Lewis is co-pilot. 0245: Enola Gay begins takeoff roll. 0730: The bomb is armed. 0850: Flying at 31,000 ft Enola Gay crosses Shikoku due east of Hiroshima. Bombing conditions are good, the aim point is easily visible, and no opposition is encountered. 0915:17 Little Boy is released at 31060 feet. 0916:02 (8:16:02 Hiroshima time) Little Boy explodes at an altitude of 1850 feet, 550 feet from the aim point, the Aioi Bridge, with a yield of 12.5-18 Kt (best estimate is 15 Kt).\n\nIn the absence of an immediate surrender, a crash effort begins to print and distribute millions of leaflets to major Japanese cities warning of future atomic attacks. Also, The date for dropping Fat Man is moved up to August 10, then to August 9, to avoid a projected 5 days of bad weather. This requires skipping many check out procedures during assembly.\n\nAt Foreign Minister Togo’s request, Soviet Ambassador Sato tries to persuade the Soviets to mediate surrender negotiations. Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov cancels the meeting, then announces that the Soviet Union is at war with Japan effective the next day. Meanwhile, leaflet dropping, and warnings to Japan by Radio Saipan begin (Nagasaki does not receive warning leaflets until August 10). Fat Man unit F33 is dropped in practice bomb run. Assembly of Fat Man unit F31 with the plutonium core completed in the early morning. At, 2200, Fat Man is loaded on B-29 “Bock’s Car”.\n\n0347: Bock’s Car takes off from Tinian, the target of choice is Kokura Arsenal. Charles Sweeney is pilot. Soon after takeoff he discovers that the fuel system will not pump from the 600 gallon reserve tank. 1044: Bock’s Car arrives at Kokura but finds it covered by haze, the aim point cannot be seen. Flak and fighters appear, forcing the plane to stop searching for it. Sweeney turns toward Nagasaki, the only secondary target in range. Upon arriving at Nagasaki, Bock’s Car has enough fuel for only one pass over the city even with an emergency landing at Okinawa. Nagasaki is covered with clouds, but one gap allows a drop several miles from the intended aim point. 1102 (Nagasaki time): Fat Man explodes at 1950 feet near the perimeter of the city, scoring a direct hit on the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works. Yield is 19-23 Kt (best estimate is 21 Kt). Meanwhile, J. Robert Oppenheimer cables General Leslie Groves with the following shipping schedule: 11 Aug. first quality HE unit; 12 Aug. next plutonium core; 14 Aug. another first quality HE unit.\n\nJapanese civilian and military leaders are still unable to agree on accepting the Potsdam Declaration’s surrender terms. Emperor Hirohito instead breaks the tradition of imperial non-intervention in government and orders that surrender be accepted, provided that the Emperor be allowed to retain his position. General Groves reports that the second plutonium core would be ready for shipment on August 12 or 13, with a bombing possible on August 17 or 18. President Truman orders a halt to further atomic bombing until further orders are issued.\n\nPresident Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes reply with an amended form of the Potsdam Decree that acknowledges the Emperor, but still refuses to guarantee his position. General Leslie Groves decides to delay shipping the second plutonium core and contacts Robert Bacher just after he had signed receipt for shipping the core to Tinian Island. The core is retrieved from the car before it leaves Los Alamos, NM. Also, Strategic Air Forces Carl Spaatz halts area firebombing.\n\nHenry DeWolf Smyth publicly releases his report, “Atomic Energy for Military Purposes.”\n\nSecretary of War Henry Stimson recommends shipping the second plutonium core to Tinian Island. President Truman orders area firebombing resumed. Gen. Henry Arnold, US Army Air Force, launches the largest raid on Japan of the war with over 1000 B-29s and other aircraft, carrying 6000 tons of bombs.\n\nFollowing leaflet bombing of Tokyo with surrender terms, Hirohito orders that an Imperial Edict accepting surrender be issued. At 2:49 p.m. (1:49 a.m. Washington time), Japanese news agency announces surrender.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer warns Secretary of War Henry Stimson that:Atomic weapons would improve qualitatively and quantitatively over coming years.Adequate defenses against nuclear weapons would not be developed.The US would not retain hegemony over nuclear weapons.Wars could not be prevented even if better nuclear weapons were developed.\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur arrives in Japan to oversee the formal surrender ceremony and to establish a democratic Japanese government.\n\nJapanese officials sign the formal Japanese Instrument of Surrender on board the USS Missouri.\n\nS-50 Plant completely shuts down.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer resigns as director of Los Alamos Laboratory, accepting a post at CalTech.\n\nNorris Bradbury takes over as director of Los Alamos Laboratory (a position he would hold for 25 years).\n\nPresident Truman announces that the Atomic Energy Commission will “continue its work on all forms of atomic weapons, including the so-called hydrogen or superbomb.”\n\nKlaus Fuchs is arrested by the United Kingdom for espionage.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff requests President Truman to approve all out development of hydrogen bombs and the means for their production and delivery.\n\nAfter seeking advice from the Special Committee of the NSC, Truman approves the Joint Chiefs of Staff’s request to develop hydrogen bombs. Construction of the reactors for producing tritium thought to be necessary for thermonuclear fuel commenced soon after.\n\nNiels Bohr presents his “Open Letter to the United Nations.” As early as 1944, Bohr had recognized that the creation of atomic weapons would completely change the nature of future warfare. Bohr stressed the free exchange of scientific and technological information as critical to creating the basis for peaceful cooperation between nations, and reflected on the “hopes and the dangers” of the Atomic Age.\n\nThe U.S. conducts its first nuclear detonation, Operation Ranger Shot Able, at the Nevada Test Site.\n\nEdward Teller and Stanislaw Ulam come up with a promising design (the details of which are still highly classified) to facilitate the ignition of a large mass of thermonuclear fuel by a relatively small fission explosion. Calculations based on the new design commenced immediately, most of them done by Los Alamos scientists. In addition, scientists used some of the earliest computing machines to help with calculations.\n\nThe United States Conducts the Shot Easy nuclear test on April 20, 1951 at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It was the second in the Operation Greenhouse series of nuclear weapons tests. The Easy test, meant to test a new, lighter implosion bomb, yielded 47 kilotons.\n\nThe United States begins Operation Greenhouse, a series of nuclear tests conducted at Eniwetok Atoll to test various design principles that would later become pivotal in the development of thermonuclear weapons. The purpose of these tests was to reduce the size, weight, and amount of fissile material necessary for nuclear weapons, while simultaneously increasing their destructive power.\n\nThe U.S. conducts the “George” nuclear test at Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean as part of Operation Greenhouse. The “George” test involved a device in which a relatively large fission yield was to be used to ignite a relatively small mass of thermonuclear fuel. According to Edward Teller, the success of the “George” shot was pivotal in the development of the Super and provided scientists with the confidence to proceed along further speculations of thermonuclear design principles.\n\nThe United States conducts the Baker Shot; the second nuclear test conducted in the Operation Buster-Jangle test series. It is held at the Nevada Test Site in October-November 1951. Baker is detonated on October 28, 1951, yielding 3.5 kilotons.\n\nThe US military conducts the Charlie Shot of Operation Buster, a 14 kiloton airdrop fission bomb with a composite plutonium-uranium core.\n\nThe US military conducts the Dog Shot of Operation Buster, a 21 kiloton airdrop fission bomb with a composite plutonium-uranium core.

Charlie yielded 31 kilotons, and was part of the Desert Rock IV exercises, where thousands of military personnel trained to simulate activity on a nuclear battlefield.\n\nThe United States conducts Shot Dog on May 1, 1952, the fourth in the Operation Tumbler Snapper series of nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site. Dog yielded 19 kilotons. It was part of the Desert Rock IV exercises, where thousands of military personnel trained to simulate activity on a nuclear battlefield.\n\nThe UK tests its first atomic bomb, known as Hurricane.\n\nThe United States tests its first ever thermonuclear device at Eniwetok Atoll in the South Pacific during Operation IVY. The Mike Shot yielded 10 megatons of TNT and was roughly 1000 times larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima seven years earlier.\n\nThe United States tests a second nuclear device during Operation IVY known as the “King Shot”. This device was dropped from an aircraft and exploded at an altitude of 1480 feet above its target. The explosion, which derived its energy entirely from fission, was extremely large and probably yielded somewhere around 500 kilotons.\n\nThe United States conducts the “Annie” nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site on March 17, 1953. It yielded 16 kilotons. A wood-framed house was built for the occasion as part of a civil defense study on the effects of a nuclear explosion.\n\nThe United States conducts the “Simon” test on April 25, 1953. It was the 7th nuclear detonation in the Operation Upshot-Knothole test series at the Nevada Test Site. It yielded 43 kilotons.\n\nThe United States conducts the “Harry” test on May 19, 1953. It was the 9th nuclear detonation in the Operation Upshot-Knothole test series at the Nevada Test Site. Shot Harry yielded 32 kilotons, and was the most efficient pure fission device ever detonated with a yield under 100 kt. Due to an unexpected change in the wind, “Harry” caused the highest amount of radioactive fallout of any test in the continental United States, contaminating the city of St. George, Utah. The test was later called “Dirty Harry.”\n\nU.S. military conducts Shot Grable of Operation Upshot-Knothole, the first test of a nuclear artillery shell from a 280mm AFAP (Artillery Fired Atomic Projectile). The explosion yielded 15 kilotons and was the second ever US detonation of a gun-type design nuclear weapon.\n\nJulius and Ethel Rosenberg are executed by the U.S. for passing atomic secrets to the USSR.\n\nSoviet Premier Georgy Malenkov announces that the United States no longer had a monopoly on the hydrogen bomb.\n\nThe first test of a Soviet thermonuclear device takes place. The test, which became known as Joe-4 (this had been the fourth Soviet nuclear explosion whose occurrence was announced by the United States), took place at the Semipalatinsk test site and yielded roughly 400 kilotons of TNT.\n\nPresident Eisenhower delivers his “Atoms for Peace” speech which outlines a program for the distribution of peaceful nuclear technology, materials, and know-how to many countries with less advanced research.\n\nThe United States conducts the “Bravo” test, the largest thermonuclear device in history up to that point. Bravo was a device using Lithium Deuteride as its fuel and the explosion yielded 15 megatons. The bomb was in a form readily adaptable for delivery by an aircraft and was thus America’s first weaponized hydrogen bomb.\n\nThe US conducts Shot Romeo of Operation Castle, a 11 megaton thermonuclear weapon whose observed yield was far higher than anticipated (only 4 Mt) due to a lack of understanding of the complex conditions inside of a hydrogen bomb.\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer’s security clearance is revoked by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission after numerous accusations that he passed atomic secrets to the Soviets.\n\nThe United States conducts Shot Hornet at the Nevada Test Site on March 12, 1955.

It was the third of 29 nuclear tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site in 1957 as part of Operation Plumbbob. “Priscilla” yielded 37 kilotons. Operation Plumbbob was the longest, most comprehensive test series in the continental United States and became controversial after much of the operation was declassified. Plumbbob released approximately 58,300 kilocuries of radioiodine (I-131) into the atmosphere over a four month period, producing about 32% of all civilian exposure due to continental nuclear tests.\n\nThe United States conducts the Shot Kepler nuclear test on July 24, 1957. It was the seventh of 29 nuclear tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site in 1957 as part of Operation Plumbbob. “Kepler” yielded 10 kilotons and was intended to test a ICBM warhead.\n\nThe United States conducts the Coulomb-B Shot safety test during Operation Plumbbob, a controversial series of 29 nuclear tests held at the Nevada Test Site. Detonated on September 6, 1957, Coulomb-B was intended to make sure that an accidental detonation of conventional high explosives in a nuclear device would not cause a nuclear reaction.\n\nUSSR launches Sputnik-1, the first artificial satellite in space.\n\nThe United States conducts the Coulomb-C Shot safety test on December 6, 1957 at the Nevada Test Site. The test yielded an unexpectedly high amount of 500 tons, leading to public concern over nuclear fallout.\n\nThe “Oak” nuclear test is conducted by the United States on June 28, 1958 at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. It was part of the Operation Hardtack I series.
