        "text": "A Legacy of Service\n\nFor more than a century, General Motors has answered America’s call and supported the United States Armed Forces in every major military conflict. Our many brands, including Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, Buick and previously Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Fisher Body, Electro-Motive and others, have adapted their engineering prowess and advanced production capabilities to support the war efforts. From producing trucks, tanks, powertrains and ammunition, to refitting our manufacturing facilities to deliver additional combat support materiel, to investing in cutting-edge research and development, GM has supported those wearing the colors of our nation on battlefields throughout the world. Beyond GM’s commitment to the Department of Defense, our dedication to other government agencies is just as notable. Today, GM Defense continues this storied legacy as GM’s purpose-built defense and government business leveraging its commercial investment in advanced mobility and related technologies.\n\nThe following journey through the evolution of GM Defense over the past century highlights some of the contributions made by GM since 1914. The unique imagery from our archive and historic facts captured here offer just a glimpse into our legacy of service. As the largest commercial provider of military vehicles in history, GM continues this legacy of service to global defense and government customers today, on battlefields of the future and wherever mission requirements drive us."
