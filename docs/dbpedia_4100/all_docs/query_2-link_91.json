        "text": "The National Research Foundation Competitive Research Programme (CRP) funding scheme seeks to foster the formation of multi-disciplinary teams to conduct cutting-edge research projects relevant to Singapore and society.\n\nThe CRP funds use-inspired basic research projects selected through a merit review process based on scientific excellence. The theme of the proposed research project must be motivated by an important need or problem to be solved.\n\nPast projects have made discoveries of potentially significant impact on industry and society. Click here to view these projects.\n\nThe next CRP Grant Call will resume in Mar 2024. Please check the Integrated Grant Management System (IGMS) regularly for updates on the launch dates of the CRP Categories.\n\nCRP Categories\n\nCRP\n\nSupports use-inspired basic research programmes relevant to Singapore in all areas of science and technology. Research ideas at the intersection of multiple disciplines, including biological sciences, are considered.\n\nOffers funding support for programmes of varying sizes between a period of 3 to 5 years.\n\nCalls-for-proposals are launched twice yearly.\n\nTwo-stage review process:\n\nFrontier CRP\n\n[New â more details to be released in grant call documents]\n\nSupports smaller-scale research programmes to pursue innovative use-inspired research that can potentially enable paradigm shifts and/or breakthroughs in scientific knowledge.\n\nProposals need not present existing preliminary data at the point of application, but should present a plausible scientific hypothesis.\n\nFunding cap of S$2M (including indirect costs) for 3 to 5 years.\n\nOne-stage review process for Full Proposal. Evaluation Criteria: (i) originality and ground-breaking nature of the research; (ii) significance and potential impact of the research; (iii) scientific approach; (iv) technical competencies of the team.\n\nAwarded projects will undergo a stage-gated review at the 2-year mark.\n\nThematic CRP\n\n[New â more details to be released in grant call documents]\n\nSupports use-inspired basic research programmes but with relevance to a defined thematic research area and mission.\n\nFor more info on the CRP categories, please refer to the FAQs for more details.\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nPrincipal Investigators (PIs) from institutions/organisations which fulfil the following criteria will be eligible to participate as Lead PI/Team PI:\n\nRegistered as a Public Institute of Higher Learning (IHL), Public Healthcare institution, A*STAR Research Institute, CREATE research entities, or research institutes affiliated with the Autonomous Universities (AUs)/A*STAR;\n\nHas adequate research infrastructure to support research activities; and\n\nHas the ability to take up the responsibilities of a Host Institution.\n\nPrivate sector and other entities can participate as collaborators.\n\nLead PI and Team PI(s) must fulfil the following requirements at the point of application and throughout the project duration:\n\nHold a primary and/or joint appointment(s) at eligible institution(s)/organisations(s), with a minimum time commitment of 9 months (per calendar year) in Singapore; and\n\nBe an accomplished PI with a track record of leadership ability in coordinating research program(s) and providing mentorship to research teams(s), as well as having productive research outcomes."
