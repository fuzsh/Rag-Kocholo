        "text": "Glass Shop Workshops 2024\n\nStudents will learn how to create pendants and small figures out of glass by shaping borosilicate clear and color rods into colorful pendants and small figures.\n\nThese workshops will be offered on Saturdays from 9 a.m. - 4 p.m. on the following dates: June 1, July 13, August 3, September 7, October 5, November 2, December 7. Email sprasch [at] umass [dot] edu (sprasch[at]umass[dot]edu) to register for a workshop.\n\nThe figure below was created by Brian Zhang.\n\nNATSCI 520: Science and the Art of Glassblowing\n\nInterested in learning more about glassblowing? Join our one-credit course and learn about the different compositions, safety and uses of glass and glass components for scientific endeavors and other applications. Using a small flame, glass tubing, and rod, you will learn how to design and create your own pieces.\n\nBoth Fall 2024 sections are currently filled.\n\nWe will be offering the course again in Spring 2025:\n\nThursday: 9:30 a.m.–10:20 a.m.\n\nFriday: 10:10 a.m.–11 a.m.\n\nAbout the Lab\n\nThe UMass Amherst Glassblowing Laboratory is an indispensable part of any modern research team and a core facility within College of Natural Sciences operations.\n\nThe mission of the glassblowing laboratory is to provide high quality, affordably priced standard and non–standard items, glassware modifications, repairs, and custom designs for instructional and research needs. The lab works closely with individuals in the design, fabrication, and repair of specialty scientific glass instruments.\n\nThe lab has the capacity to work with all types of glass, including borosilicate, quartz, aluminosilicate, and soft glass. The shop is fully equipped with annealing ovens, lathes, a diamond saw, a lapping wheel, and a variety of torches. Some glass parts and tubing are kept in stock to keep turnaround time to a minimum.\n\nThe glassblowing laboratory is run by Sally Prasch, a veteran laboratory glassblower with more than 40 years of experience. Please come by and see what the glassblowing laboratory can do for you. The shop is now open Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with basic services available on a walk-in basis. Service requests can be made at any time via sprasch [at] umass [dot] edu (subject: Glassblowing%20laboratory) (email to Sally Prasch.) You may also use the Glassblowing Order Form.\n\nCheck out this photo essay of the Glassblowing Lab. You can also take this virtual tour with Prasch to learn about how and why glass is used in scientific research and to see a short demonstration.\n\nLab location\n\nLederle Graduate Research Center (Lowrise) Room A19\n\n740 N.
