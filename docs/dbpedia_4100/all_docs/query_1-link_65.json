        "text": "Dr. Repperger\n\nThe Repperger Research Intern Program honors the life and work of Dr. Daniel W. Repperger (1942-2010), a scientist and mentor to many young engineers and scientists. As a researcher in the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Human Effectiveness Directorate for 35 years, Dr. Repperger’s mathematical and scientific innovations have revolutionized image and network complexity analysis. He received international recognition in haptic controllers, human-machine interface performance enhancement, and mathematical methods development. While Dr. Repperger’s significant research accomplishments helped advance the performance of Air Force airmen and the field of human-centered research, his most significant accomplishment may well be the impact he had as a kind and caring mentor of many young Air Force scientists and science and engineering students.\n\nDr. Repperger received a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University. He was a David Ross Research Fellow at Purdue from 1971-1973 and a National Research Council Post-Doctoral Fellow at Wright-Patterson AFB from 1973-1975. A member of Eta Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi, Dr. Repperger was a Registered Professional Engineer in Ohio and on the Board of Trustees of the Ohio Academy of Sciences. He was a Fellow of the IEEE, Air Force Research Laboratory, American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, the Ohio Academy of Science and the Aerospace Medical Association. Dr. Repperger authored over 400 technical journal articles, reports and conference publications, was selected as Associate Editor of five international journals and obtained 14 U.S. patents and 28 Air Force invention registrations. His honors and awards include the Harry G. Armstrong Scientific Excellence Award, Human Effectiveness Directorate Mentor of the Year, IEEE Third Millennium Medal Winner and the IEEE Dayton Fritz Russ Award. Dr. Repperger is listed in the Who's Who in Science and Engineering and the American Men and Women of Science.\n\nGaurav Sharma, PhD, ST\n\nChief Scientist\n\n711th Human Performance Wing\n\nAs the Chief Scientist for the 711th Human Performance Wing at the Air Force Research Laboratory, I invite you to submit an application to participate in our 2024 Repperger Intern program. This program posthumously honors Dr. Daniel W. Repperger, who mentored many scientists and engineers during his 35-year research career with our organization, by providing opportunities for student interns to conduct research in one of our facilities. Interns will participate under the mentorship of an AFRL scientist or engineer who has been selected to mentor because of their technical knowledge, experience and willingness to help science and engineering students enhance their learning through participation in an actual Air Force research project.\n\nPlease review the information and application instructions to determine your eligibility and then review the research projects to see if any match your research interests. If selected for one of the projects, you will be appointed to a 10-week summer research internship at one of our two research locations: Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, OH and Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX. The research appointments will be administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE).\n\nAlong with gaining first-hand research experience, you will learn the inner workings of an operational Department of Defense laboratory and develop contacts and a network that will help you in your professional career. Again, please review the information on this website carefully to understand the specifics of the program before you apply. I look forward to reviewing your application and wish you the best of luck in the selection process.\n\nGaurav Sharma, PhD, ST\n\nChief Scientist\n\n711th Human Performance Wing"
