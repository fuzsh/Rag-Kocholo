        "text": "Development of the OSRD\n\nOn June 27, 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved an order External issued by the Council of National Defense, a First World War era group of six Cabinet Secretaries, revived to coordinate support for the upcoming war effort. This order established the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), directing that the committee to “correlate and support scientific research on the mechanisms and devices of warfare…”.\n\nMuch of the NDRC's work was completed under strict secrecy, but Roosevelt's decision gave the United States an 18-month head start for employing science in the war effort. Members of the NDRC included:\n\nDr. Vannevar Bush (chairman), president, Carnegie Institution of Washington and former Dean of the faculty of engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT);\n\nProf. Richard C. Tolman (vice-chairman), dean of the graduate school and professor of physical chemistry and mathematical physics, California Institute of Technology (CalTech);\n\nDr. Irvin Stewart (secretary), chairman, Committee on Scientific Aids to Learning and former Federal Commissioner for Communications;\n\nRear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, director, Naval Research Laboratory;\n\nConway P. Coe, U.S. Commissioner of Patents;\n\nDr. Karl T. Compton, president, MIT;\n\nDr. James B. Conant, president, Harvard University;\n\nDr. Frank B. Jewett, president, Bell Telephone Laboratories; and\n\nBrigadier General G. V. Strong.\n\nThe NDRC administered its work through five divisions:\n\nDivision A - Armor and Ordnance\n\nDivision B - Bombs, Fuels, Gases, & Chemical Problems\n\nDivision C - Communication and Transportation\n\nDivision D - Detection, Controls, and Instruments\n\nDivision E - Patents and Inventions\n\nThe NDRC, however, had neither the authority nor the funds to carry research forward into development and production. Concerned that the NDRC needed additional support, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8807 on June 28, 1941 establishing the Office of Scientific Research and Development as an independent entity within the Office for Emergency Management. Vannevar Bush was appointed director of the OSRD and given the authority to enter into contracts (PDF, 2.95MB) and agreements for studies, experimental investigations and reports. James B. Conant replaced Bush as chairman of the NDRC.\n\nBush immediately undertook a survey to identify scientists in government, universities and industry that could be recruited for military-related research. Thousands of draft deferments were granted as experts were employed and contracts signed, primarily to a select group of established institutions, to further weapons research and development.\n\nAdministratively, the agency was divided on a subject basis into a Sensory Devices Committee, a Insect Control Committee, an Office of Field Services, a reorganized NDRC and a Committee on Medical Research.\n\nThe NDRC was now composed of the following divisions, panels and committees:\n\nDivision 1 - Ballistic Research\n\nDivision 2 - Effects of Impact and Explosion\n\nDivision 3 - Rocket Ordnance\n\nDivision 4 - Ordnance Accessories\n\nDivision 5 - New Missiles\n\nDivision 6 - Sub-surface Warfare\n\nDivision 7 - Fire Control\n\nDivision 8 - Explosives\n\nDivision 9 - Chemistry\n\nDivision 10 - Absorbents and Aerosols\n\nDivision 11 - Chemical Engineering\n\nDivision 12 - Transportation\n\nDivision 13 - Electrical Communication\n\nDivision 14 - Radar\n\nDivision 15 - Radio Coordination\n\nDivision 16 - Optics and Camouflage\n\nDivision 17 - Physics\n\nDivision 18 - War Metallurgy\n\nDivision 19 - Miscellaneous\n\nApplied Mathematics Panel (AMP)\n\nApplied Psychology Panel (APP)\n\nCommittee on Propagation\n\nVacuum Tube Development Committee\n\nTropical Deterioration Administrative Committee\n\nThe Committee on Medical Research (CMR) was subdivided as follows:\n\nDivision 1 - Medicine\n\nDivision 2 - Surgery\n\nDivision 3 - Aviation Medicine\n\nDivision 4 - Physiology\n\nDivision 5 - Chemistry\n\nDivision 6 - Malaria\n\nIn addition, in early 1944, the Army and Navy, with the assistance of the OSRD, established an Army-Navy-OSRD Vision Committee to investigate vision problems related to military activity. The Committee's headquarters were located at the National Academy of Sciences office building, and after the war, the Committee was reorganized as the Army-Navy-National Research Council Vision Committee.\n\nBy the end of the war, the OSRD had spent $450 million to provide U.S. and Allied troops with more powerful and accurate weapons, more reliable detonators, safer and more effective medical treatments and more versatile vehicles. Bush had expected that the relationship he forged between the military and civilian scientists - especially the dissemination of information - would change after the conflict (see his article \"As We May Think\" in the July 1945 issue of Atlantic Monthly). His wartime efforts, however, actually transformed the American research enterprise, and contributed to the \"immense military establishment\" and \"large arms industry\", lamented by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his 1961 Farewell Address. As Captain F. R. Furth, U.S.N, told scientists attending a June 1944 Symposium on Airborne Electronic Equipment (Symposium, June 15, 16 and 17, 1944, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on confidential airborne electronic equipment. OSRD collection):\n\n\"To gain this electronic superiority [in radar] has taxed to the limits the combined best efforts of our scientists and of our manufacturing facilities. It has been a battle of wits between our scientists and the enemies' scientists and it is reasonable to expect that this battle will continue until the war's end - and should not stop even then as when the war ends we must continue this research and development so as to be prepared for the next 'sneak attack.\"\n\nAlthough disbanded on December 31, 1947 and its remaining functions transferred to the National Military Establishment, now, the Department of Defense, the OSRD had proven the advantages of having a central agency organize and disseminate technical information in an easily recognizable format. At the same time, the tie between military and civilian scientific researchers, to \"continue [this] research and development,\" became permanently entwined.\n\nThe Library of Congress and the OSRD\n\nIn 1946, in connection with the termination of its war-time contractual research program, the OSRD recalled hundreds of thousands of copies of technical reports which had been prepared and issued by its contracting laboratories. Recognizing the importance of this body of technical literature to postwar research, the OSRD asked the Library of Congress to serve as the official receiving point for these reports and to undertake redistribution of the materials - in sets - to a number of centers throughout the world. Classified reports were sent to selected military installations, while unclassified sets of reports went to some 90 research libraries. Because the number of copies of particular titles varied from one to over a hundred, the sets differed greatly in their degree of completeness. Set No. 1, constituting the most nearly complete single record of World War II OSRD research, was retained by the Library of Congress and became the principal source of material for the OSRD Cataloging Project. This project got under way in 1949, but due to changing budget priorities, was discontinued in 1952 before all the material was described.\n\nIn 1960, all of the 35,000 to 40,000 hardcopy reports in the OSRD collection were declassified and made available to the public. Completed catalog records on index cards - covering thru Division 14, the Panels and the CMR reports - were filed in a card catalog that is housed in the TRS Unit. These cards contain contractor numbers, OSRD numbers, issuing group, and author and title information.\n\nIn addition to the card catalog records, the collection also includes over 400 reels of OSRD microfilm containing 15,000 of the \"most important\" research reports found in the hardcopy collection, a bound index volume to the microfilm, and 70 bound volumes of Summary Technical Reports. The Master Subject Index of the NDRC has been digitized and is available online."
