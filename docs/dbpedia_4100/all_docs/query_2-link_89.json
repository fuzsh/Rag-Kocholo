        "text": "Growth Curve\n\nSince bacteria are easy to grow in the lab, their growth has been studied extensively. It has been determined that in a closed system or batch culture (no food added, no wastes removed) bacteria will grow in a predictable pattern, resulting in a growth curve composed of four distinct phases of growth: the lag phase, the exponential or log phase, the stationary phase, and the death or decline phase. Additionally, this growth curve can yield generation time for a particular organism – the amount of time it takes for the population to double.\n\nBacterial Growth Curve. By Michał Komorniczak.

But the pattern of four distinct phases of growth will typically remain."
