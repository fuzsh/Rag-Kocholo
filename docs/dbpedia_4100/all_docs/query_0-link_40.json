        "text": "WW2 Military Hospitals European Theater of Operations\n\nThe European Theater of Operations which was to conduct the US Army’s largest and most complex land campaign of WW2 and complete the destruction of Nazi Germany, had rather modest beginnings! In agreement with its Allies, the United States Government decided to deal with ‘Germany first’ …\n\nThe initial objective was to establish Army Forces in the British Isles in order to protect them from a possible enemy invasion; another objective was to relieve a number of British troops for operations in the Mediterranean, and to reinforce the Royal Air Force with aircraft and personnel.\n\nUS Military Observers were sent to Great Britain to keep abreast of British wartime technical developments and to study the overall British war effort (the United States was not yet at war). Late 1940, the Medical Department dispatched an official Observer (Col. Raymond W. Bliss) to report on Hospitalization and Evacuation methods. American medical help had already been sent in the form of a “Contagious Disease Treatment and Control Unit”, officially designated the American Red Cross – Harvard Field Hospital Unit including a laboratory, a 125-bed Hospital, and a number of mobile investigating teams. Their task was to assist the British Ministry of Health in combating outbreaks of paratyphoid, scabies, and other diseases which were a constant threat in the crowded and bomb damaged cities.\n\nThe first US Army Military Mission to England set up its Headquarters in London, on May 19, 1941. In charge was Maj. Gen. James E. Chaney (US Air Corps) who headed the delegation formerly designated “Special Observers Group” (SPOBS). Anything that was deemed – nice to know, or necessary to know – was investigated, collected, and requested. Medical and sanitary conditions, hospital distribution, medical organization, evacuation of wounded, preventive medicine, number of beds, medical emergencies, all this information was of utmost importance to the USWD in preparation of medical planning. In mid-September 1941, Col. Paul R. Hawley (MC) was transferred to the United Kingdom to draft and prepare full plans for an American medical build-up and support in Northern Ireland and the British Isles. After the attack against Pearl Harbor, the War Department activated the Headquarters, United States Army Forces in the British Isles (USAFBI), the date was January 8, 1942, Chief Surgeon was Col. Paul R. Hawley. The same month, i.e. on January 24, 1942, another organization was created, the United States Army Northern Ireland Force (USANIF).\n\nThe first US Army medical contingents were now about to enter the “European Theater of Operations”…\n\nBackground Information:\n\nEarly World War 2 Period:\n\nFurnishing hospitalization facilities for overseas areas became another phase of the US War Department plans. Projects to garrison the Atlantic Bases got under way early in 1941; a first medical group was sent to St. John’s, Newfoundland in January, and other groups followed to Trinidad and Bermuda in April. In the fall of 1941, the very first medical units were sent to Iceland.\n\nDuring the period January – July 1942, inclusive, a large number of Hospital Units moved overseas: 2 Evacuation , 2 Surgical, 4 General, 14 Station Hospitals went to Australia – 2 Evacuation , 2 General, and 2 Station Hospitals were shipped to the South Pacific – 2 Station Hospitals were transferred to the Central Pacific – 1 General and 1 Station Hospital went to Northern Ireland – 1 General Hospital to Iceland – 2 General and 3 Station Hospitals to England – and more later embarked for India and northwest Canada.\n\nIn March 1942 the reorganization of the War Department, and the creation of three main Commands – Army Air Forces, Army Ground Forces, and Services of Supply (called ASF after March 1943), were to cause several conflicts within the United States Armed Forces. Within the War Department, and among some elements of the SOS, such as the Quartermaster Corps and the Medical Department, functions, responsibilities, authority, control, and matters of activation, training, and supply became critical subjects for constant review among AGF and SOS staff, leading to disputes about general planning for Hospitalization and Evacuation! Directives were issued June 18, 1942 compiling policies and procedures governing H & E, but were only finalized in November of the same year.\n\nMeanwhile new Hospital Units were earmarked for special task forces and deployment to North Africa (Operation “Gymnast”), Northern Ireland (Operation “Magnet”), and England (Operation “Bolero”).\n\nWorld War 2:\n\nBy March 15, 1943, the War Department had already shipped overseas, 140 Station, 27 General, 14 Field, 2 Convalescent, 3 Surgical, and 23 EvacuationHospitals.\n\nThe Surgeon General furnished adequately trained and equipped Army Service Forces Hospital units for the Theaters of Operations, where numbered Station, Field, and General Hospitals became the most important medical installations. In the years from June 30, 1943 to June 30, 1945 the Medical Department trained 189 General Hospitals, 74 Field Hospitals and 61 Station Hospitalsfor overseas service. In fiscal 1945, when the peak of overseas shipments occurred, the WD sent 81 General, 35 Field, and 8 StationHospitalsto the various Theaters of Operations. By May 1945, when the peak in Hospital beds overseas was reached, there were 335,000 fixed beds and about 87,000 mobile beds in all Theaters. The E.T.O. alone had approximately 700 Hospital units of all kinds in operation overseas at this time …\n\nDuring the period June 30, 1943toJune 30, 1945, the MD’s task of hospitalizing sick and wounded personnel exceeded that of any previous period in the history of the U.S. Army. In that same period 5,050,718 Army patients were admitted to overseas Hospitals, and 6,002,013 to ZI Hospitals! The number of patients in Hospitals overseas increased from 47,446 on June 30, 1943 to 266,466 at the end of January 1945. Effective evacuation to the Zone of Interior reduced this number to 138,486 by June 30, 1945. Meanwhile, the number of Hospital patients in the United States increased from 167,713 on June 30, 1943 to a peak of 303,102 by June 30, 1945 (at this time, the number of authorized beds for all Hospitals in the ZI was only 314,588). To cope with this situation, The Surgeon General’s Hospital program revised the ZI Hospital system, developed and perfected a system of specialized General Hospitals, provided additional General and Convalescent Hospital beds, improved the overall administration of Hospitals, and inaugurated a program of increased standards of maintenance and improvement of Hospital facilities.\n\nHere follows a tentative list of Military Hospitals active in the European Theater of Operations:\n\nConvalescent Hospitals:\n\nThe Medical Department was impressed by the effectiveness of the British Convalescent & Rehabilitation system, and as a result of their survey, it ordered the building of special reconditioning camps. A first Rehabilitation Center opened on April 19, 1943 in Worcestershire, followed by a second on October 5, 1943 in Warwickshire. These centers were at first staffed by personnel from the 16th Station Hospital, reinforced by 5 Officers and 7 EM who had trained in British Convalescent camps. The 8th Convalescent Hospital took over temporarily, while the second Center started operations with 307th Station and 77th Station Hospital personnel. These projects effectively triggered activation of US Convalescent Hospitals in the ETO, later transformed into Convalescent Centers.\n\n2d CONV HOSP – ETO 1 Nov 44 France\n\n4th CONV HOSP – 16 Oct 43 USAFBI – ETO 28 Jun 44 France – 2 Oct 44 Holland – 26 Oct 44 Belgium – 22 Mar 45 Germany\n\n6th CONV HOSP – ETO – Belgium – Germany\n\n7th CONV HOSP – ETO – England – France – Germany\n\n8th CONV HOSP – ETO 28 Apr 44 England – 9 Feb 45 France\n\nEvacuation Hospitals:\n\n2d EVAC HOSP – USANIF 27 Sep 42 – 6 Nov 42 England – 10 Feb 44 Wales – 29 Jun 44 France – 2 Oct 44 Belgium – 31 Mar 45 Germany (constituted with elements of 4th EVAC HOSP, disbanded 24 Aug 42, split in 2 different units, the 2d EVAC HOSP sent to Northern Ireland, 4 Sep 42, and the 48th EVAC HOSP transferred to India 18 Jan 43)\n\n4th EVAC HOSP – 10 Feb 40 (disbanded 24 Aug 42, redesignated 2d EVAC HOSP, embarked for Northern Ireland 4 Sep 42, redesignated 48th EVAC HOSP, embarked for India 18 Jan 43)\n\n5th EVAC HOSP – ETO 18 Dec 43 England – 15 Jun 44 France – 18 Sep 44 Belgium – 11 Mar 45 Germany (activated 15 Jun 42) (operated feeding point for transient RAMPS at Gotha) (inactivated 5 Mar 46 ZI)\n\n6th EVAC HOSP – 10 Feb 40 (disbanded 24 Aug 42, redesignated 9th EVAC HOSP, embarked for England 26 Sep 42)\n\n9th EVAC HOSP – USAFBI 26 Sep 42 – 1 Nov 44 France (constitued with elements of 6th EVAC HOSP, disbanded 24 Aug 42, supplied enlisted personnel to other units, including this Hospital)\n\n11th EVAC HOSP – ETO 16 Aug 44 S.

“Blood Banks” were set up at the 2d – 5th – 30th – 52d – 67th – 127th and 298th General Hospitals stationed in the United Kingdom The 40th – 48th – 62d – 108th – 203d – 217th General Hospitals, all located in and around Paris, France, from late Aug 44 to V-E Day, were grouped in 2 Hospital Centers, the 814th and 815th.\n\nBetween 1 May – 15 Jun 45, elements of the 9th – 50th – 61st – 62d- 78th – 83d Field Hospitals supported PW enclosures and established new PW Hospital Centers with German medics working under supervision of American Medical Battalions.\n\nBy 2 Jun 45, Third US Army operated a total of 237 Hospitals in Germany, 3 for RAMPS, 13 for DPs, and the remainder for German PWs (in that period over 3 million enemy PWs were in American hands).\n\nHospital Centers:\n\nOne of the most effective factors in meeting the extremely difficult problems of Hospital Administration was the organization of Hospital Centers and Groups. Under the original “Bolero” plans it was contemplated that the groups of Hospitals at Cirencester, Malvern, and Whitchurch would operate under so-called Hospital Centers (at the time only two were provided, the 12th + 15th –ed).\n\nSubsequently to operation of the three first Hospital Centers, a reorganization of the United Kingdom Base was formulated 1 September 1944, whereby the Base Sections were now designated Districts, such as the Southern – Western – and Eastern Districts. A major change was the setup of 7 Hospital Groups (Provisional) in order to provide for a more efficient control and operation of all Army Hospitals stationed in the United Kingdom. Group Headquarters would be commanded by a staff of 1 Medical Officer assisted by 22 other Officers and 142 EM. Activation was officially confirmed on 2 October 1944, by GO No. 15, Hq, UK Base.\n\nI Hospital Group (Prov) – Taunton, Som., UK\n\nII Hospital Group (Prov) – Blandford, Dorset, UK\n\nIII Hospital Group (Prov) – Chippenham, Wilts., UK\n\nIV Hospital Group (Prov) – Cirencester, Glos., UK (ex-15th Hospital Center)\n\nV Hospital Group (Prov) – Great Malvern, Worcs., UK (ex-12th Hospital Center)\n\nVI Hospital Group (Prov) – Whitchurch, Flints., UK (ex-6810th Hospital Center, Prov)\n\nVII Hospital Group (Prov) – Newmarket, Cambs., UK\n\nShortly thereafter, authority was requested to activate 5 additional Hospital Centers with a certain number of “cellular” units attached in order to obtain T/O units for operation of the 7 Hospital Groups. This was granted on 22 November 1944, whereby the Groups would now be known as Hospital Centers.\n\nHospital Centers were designed to save personnel and administrative resources. Such a Center was set up to include operation of a 1,000-bed Convalescent Camp while performing unified administrative services common (e.g. sanitation, laundry, finance, postal, signal, security, motor transport, laboratory, bakery, etc.) to all General Hospitals grouped under the Center. The organization was authorized to operate under T/O 8-540, dated 1 April 1942, comprising a personnel strength of 29 Medical Officers, 4 Warrant Officers, 1 Nurse, and 255 Enlisted Men.\n\nIn April 1944, the existing organization was superseded by a new T/O 8-500, dated 23 April 1944, governing a Hospital Center Headquarters consisting of 7 Officers, 1 Warrant Officer, 1 Nurse, and 23 Enlisted Men. The new organization could however borrow any additional personnel needed for the performance of its functions from the General Hospitals assigned to the Center.\n\nIn order to simplify control of the largest geographical clusters of General Hospitals in the United Kingdom, the Chief Surgeon in 1944 activated the first Hospital Centers. These were regular T/O medical units, each designed to coordinate and assist the work of a variable number of General Hospitals (between 5 and 7, and sometimes even including some Station Hospitals). The Centers centralized receiving, evacuation, supply, utilities, sanitation, transportation, laboratory, and guard activities, which resulted in an economy of personnel and an increased efficiency of operation. The very first were set up in March 1944 in the Western, Eastern, and Southern Base Sections.\n\n12th HOSP CEN – Great Malvern (established Mar 44) comprised 52d Gen Hosp – 53d Gen Hosp – 55th Gen Hosp – 81st Gen Hosp – 93d Gen Hosp – 96th Gen Hosp – 107th Gen Hosp – 114th Gen Hosp – 122d Gen Hosp – 123d Gen Hosp – 135th Gen Hosp – 155th Gen Hosp – 156th Gen Hosp – 297th Gen Hosp – 77th Sta Hosp – 123d Sta Hosp – 232d Sta Hosp – 279th Sta Hosp – 307th Sta Hosp (previously V Hospital Group, Provisional)\n\n15th HOSP CEN – Cirencester (established Mar 44) comprised 61st Gen Hosp – 91st Gen Hosp – 97th Gen Hosp – 110th Gen Hosp – 111th Gen Hosp – 160th Gen Hosp – 186th Gen Hosp – 192d Gen Hosp – 304th Sta Hosp – 306th Sta Hosp – 317th Sta Hosp – 318th Sta Hosp – 327th Sta Hosp (admitted 2,516 RAMPs for further treatment Apr/May 45) (previously IV Hospital Group, Provisional)\n\n801st HOSP CEN – Taunton (previously I Hospital Group, Provisional)\n\n802d HOSP CEN – Blandford (previously II Hospital Group, Provisional)\n\n803d HOSP CEN – Devizes (previously III Hospital Group, Provisional)\n\n804th HOSP CEN – Whitchurch (established Jun 44) (previously designated 6810th HOSP CEN, Provisional) comprised 57th Fld Hosp – 68th Gen Hosp – 82d Gen Hosp – 83d Gen Hosp – 109th Gen Hosp – 129th Gen Hosp – 137th Gen Hosp – 157th Gen Hosp – 182d Gen Hosp – 10th Sta Hosp – 33d Sta Hosp – 36th Sta Hosp – 168th Sta Hosp – 312th Sta Hosp – 316th Sta Hosp (previously VI Hospital Group, Provisional)\n\n805th HOSP CEN – Newmarket (previously VII Hospital Group, Provisional)\n\n809th HOSP CEN – Oxford (established Jan 45, not operational)\n\nPrior to 1 January 1945, Hospital Centers with a single exception were only functioning in the United Kingdom. Plans to activate 14 Hospital Centers on the continent were therefore launched, based on T/O 8-500 dated 1 January 1945 and T/O 8-500 amended 18 January 1945, with authorized reduced personnel!\n\n(note: apparently the 9th – 10th – 11th – 16th – 17th – 18th – 19th – 24th Hospital Centers planned, of which a few were briefly in operation, were all quickly inactivated).\n\nSix Hospital Center Headquarters were activated in the Southwest Pacific, such as the 26th – 27th – 28th – 821st HC).\n\nAdditional Hospital Centers were later set up on the Continent, under jurisdiction of ComZ.\n\n807th HOSP CEN – Le Mans, France (later moved to Vittel)\n\n808th HOSP CEN – Aachen, Germany\n\n809th HOSP CEN – Saint Erme, France (established Apr 45)\n\n810th HOSP CEN – (established
