Discover the remarkable story of Caribbean-born artist Guillaume Lethière, a leading neoclassical painter who has been all-but-forgotten today. The Clark is the first museum to present a monographic exhibition of Lethière’s work, featuring more than 100 paintings, drawings, engravings, and sculpture. Kathia St. Hilaire: Invisible Empires features the work of Haitian-American artist Kathia St. Hilaire, who combines printmaking, painting, collage, and weaving to create stunning works of magical realism. And don’t miss seeing our latest public spaces installation, David-Jeremiah: I Drive Thee, on view in the Clark Center and in the Manton Research Center."
