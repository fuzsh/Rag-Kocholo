        "text": "The Dark Energy Camera captures an image of the dazzling Coma Cluster, named after the hair of Queen Berenice II of Egypt. Not only significant in Greek mythology, this collection of galaxies was also fundamental to the discovery of the existence of dark matter. The theory emerged in 1937 when Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky noticed that the Coma Cluster galaxies behaved as if they were under the influence of vast amounts of unobservable ‘dark’ matter.\n\nVera C. Rubin Observatory’s 3.5-meter secondary mirror has been installed on the Simonyi Survey Telescope on Cerro Pachón in Chile. The glass mirror — made by Corning Advanced Optics and polished by L3Harris Technologies — is the first permanent component of the telescope’s state-of-the-art, wide-field optical system to be installed and will soon contribute to a better understanding of our Universe.\n\nUsing the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope at the U.S. National Science Foundation Kitt Peak National Observatory, a Program of NSF NOIRLab, astronomers have discovered the extreme orbit of an exoplanet that’s on its way to becoming a hot Jupiter. This exoplanet not only follows one of the most drastically stretched-out orbits of all known transiting exoplanets but is also orbiting its star backwards, lending insight into the mystery of how hot Jupiters evolve.\n\nToo big to be planets but too small to be stars, distant brown dwarfs are a key ingredient for understanding the history of the Milky Way. Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time will detect a population of ancient brown dwarfs about 20 times bigger than we’ve previously seen, revealing the processes that shaped our home galaxy.\n\nA festive array of bright pinks and blues makes for a remarkable sight in this image captured with the Gemini North telescope, one half of the International Gemini Observatory. Resembling a cloud of cosmic confetti, this image is being released in celebration of Gemini North’s 25th anniversary. NGC 4449 is a prime example of starburst activity caused by the interacting and mingling of galaxies as it slowly absorbs its smaller galactic neighbors.\n\nA new kind of quandary faced by modern astronomers is how to uncover cosmic gems within vast treasure troves of data. With increasingly large sky surveys underway, astronomers need innovative techniques to sift through the data quickly and effectively. So a team of astronomers have turned to the powers of artificial intelligence to find a particular type of astronomical gem that can mistakenly be overlooked when buried in an ocean of data.\n\nWith one telescope high in the Chilean mountains, and another on a towering dormant volcano, the International Gemini Observatory offers some of the world’s most pristine views of the night sky. But observing from these lofty altitudes sometimes means being close to a region of intense geological activity. So how do engineers protect the telescopes’ fragile mirrors from the risk of earthquake damage?"
