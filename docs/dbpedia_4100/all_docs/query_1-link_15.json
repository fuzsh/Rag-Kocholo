        "text": "The Plum Island Animal Disease Center operates Biosafety Level (BSL) 2, BSL-3 Enhanced, Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL-3), and Biosafety Level 3 Agriculture (BSL-3Ag) laboratory and animal research facilities. PIADC utilizes well-established, contemporary biosafety and biosecurity practices and procedures to ensure the safety and security of personnel, the facility, and the animal-disease-causing organisms under study. These measures help prevent laboratory-acquired infections, cross contamination within the facility, and the release or escape of disease-causing organisms into the environment. The stringent and rigorously observed safety and security measures for the biocontainment facility include:\n\nRestricted access to only authorized and trained employees and approved visitors subject to escort.\n\nTrained security professionals and various surveillance systems.\n\nBiocontainment laboratory facilities, such as vivarium and effluent decontamination systems operating under strict biosafety and biosecurity requirements including meeting or exceeding those required by the federal Select Agent Program.\n\nA careful and comprehensive program of preventive maintenance performed on laboratory biosafety systems including the critical back up or redundant systems that provide an extra level of protection.\n\nA well-trained and skilled operations and maintenance staff monitor laboratory air handling systems in real-time to help maintain biocontainment. The laboratory spaces on Plum Island are isolated from non-biocontainment areas using a system that draws fresh air in and filters the air before being exhausted from the facility. In addition, the inside of the biocontainment laboratory is kept at a lower air pressure than the ambient air outside. This helps ensure air inside the biocontainment laboratory does not leave the facility without first being adequately filtered.\n\nEmployees are required to take special precautions while working in a biocontainment laboratory to ensure they do not contaminate themselves or inadvertently carry disease-causing organisms outside the laboratory. To accomplish this critical biosafety objective, PIADC utilizes a combination of specialized containment equipment, facility design, trained staff, and established procedures and practices. For example, personnel are required to change clothes prior to entering the biocontainment laboratory and to remove laboratory-provided clothing and shower before leaving specific areas within the biocontainment facility, and again when leaving the biocontainment facility at the end of the work period.\n\nPrior to gaining access to the biocontainment facility, all employees and visitors must agree to observe a personal recognizant quarantine for a defined time period, which precludes these individuals from having contact with animal species that are susceptible to the disease-causing organisms under study at the facility.\n\nAll biocontainment waste that leaves the facility must undergo biological decontamination processes. These include chemical (liquid and gaseous) and physical (heat and incineration) methods.\n\nOur remote location—on an island, a mile-and-a-half off the tip of Long Island—has led to an inherent curiosity, and some misconceptions, about the nature of our work over the years. PIADC scientists conduct research on transboundary animal diseases, or diseases that are not transmissible to humans. To further clarify the nature of our work:\n\nPIADC scientists do not research human or prion diseases. We do, however, encounter and work with some zoonotic diseases across the diagnostic and training missions. Our staff are trained and certified in stringent biosecurity measures to handle these samples to assure a safe laboratory work environment.\n\nPIADC scientists do not research avian influenza.\n\nPIADC scientists do not research, and have not researched, Lyme disease. Discover more information on the history of Lyme disease.\n\nPIADC scientists do not research West Nile virus; however, the facility was asked to assist when an outbreak of West Nile virus affected horses on Long Island. PIADC scientists assisted with sample collection and the initial development and testing of a West Nile virus vaccine for horses. Discover more about the history of West Nile through the USDA and more about West Nile through the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nPIADC scientists do not perform classified research. DHS and USDA scientists submit research for peer-reviewed publication in national and international scientific journals, as well as present their research at scientific conferences."
