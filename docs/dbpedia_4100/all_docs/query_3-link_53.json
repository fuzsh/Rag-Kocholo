        "text": "The idea that ballots could be cast anywhere other than a physical precinct close to a voter’s home hasn’t always been embraced in the United States (and still isn’t in many other countries). What we in the U.S. now call absentee voting first arose during the Civil War, when Union and Confederate soldiers were allowed to cast ballots from their battlefield units and have them be counted back home.\n\nThe issue of absentee voting next became a major issue during World War II, when Congress passed laws in 1942 and 1944 related to soldiers stationed overseas. Both laws became embroiled in controversies over states’ rights and the voting rights of African Americans in southern states, so their effectiveness was muted. Subsequent laws, particularly the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) and the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment (MOVE) Act, have been more effective in encouraging voting by active service members through absentee voting.\n\nStates began passing absentee ballot laws for civilians in the late 1800s. The first laws were intended to accommodate voters who were away from home or seriously ill on Election Day. The number of absentee ballots distributed was relatively small, and the administrative apparatus was not designed to distribute a significant number.\n\nIn the 1980s, California became the first state to allow eligible voters to request absentee ballots for any reason at all, including their convenience. By 2023, 28 states and the District of Columbia adopted no-excuse absentee laws. The figure below classifies states according to their absentee/mail ballot regimes. According to data in the 2022 Election Administration and Voting Survey (EAVS), an average of 23.3% of voters in no-excuse states cast their ballots by mail, compared to an average of 5.4% in states that still required an excuse.\n\nIn a referendum that passed in 1998, Oregon went a step further than California by agreeing to issue all its ballots by mail. Washington followed suit in 2011, and Colorado in 2013. More recently, these states were joined by Hawaii and Utah, which passed laws to begin voting by mail permanently with the 2020 election. While they have not made the complete switch to an all-vote-by-mail system, California, D.C., Nevada, New Jersey, and Vermont mailed ballots to all voters in 2020, as a COVID-related adaptation. (In the same year, Montana allowed counties to decide whether to mail ballots to all registered voters in their county.)\n\nIt's important to note that although Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and Utah now distribute all their ballots by mail, voters do not return them all by mail. According to responses to the 2022 SPAE, 21% of mail ballots were returned to some physical location such as a drop box or local election office. Thus, it's more accurate to describe these states as “distribute ballots by mail” states.\n\nThe expanding opportunities to cast an absentee ballot or to vote by mail have not been uncontroversial. Perhaps the most important issues have been the question of whether expanding VBM opportunities increases voter turnout, and concerns over electoral integrity.\n\nFacilitating VBM presumably reduces the costs of voting for most citizens, so one would expect it to increase turnout, yet the scientific literature on this empirical question about turnout has been mixed. An early study of the effects of VBM on turnout in Oregon argued that its implementation had caused turnout to increase by 10%. However, subsequent research has had difficulty replicating these initial findings. More recent research, using a variety of quasi-experimental methods, suggests the causal effect of VBM in these states in presidential election years is around 2 percentage points, although it may be as high as 8 points in Colorado.\n\nThe safest conclusion to draw is that extending VBM options increases turnout modestly in midterm and presidential elections but may increase turnout more in primaries, local elections, and special elections. This modest increase likely comes in two ways: by bringing marginal voters into the electorate and by retaining voters who might otherwise drop out of the electorate.\n\nAnother question surrounding VBM is whether it increases voter fraud. Two major features of VBM raise these concerns. First, the ballot is cast outside the public eye, and thus the opportunities for coercion and voter impersonation are greater. Second, the transmission path for VBM ballots is not as secure as traditional in-person ballots. These security concerns relate both to ballots being intercepted and ballots being requested without the voter’s permission.\n\nAs with all forms of voter fraud, documented instances of fraud related to VBM are rare. However, even many scholars who argue that fraud is generally rare agree that fraud with VBM voting seems to be more frequent than with in-person voting. Two of the best-known cases of voter fraud involving absentee voting occurred in 1997 in Georgia and Miami. More recently, a political campaign manager within North Carolina’s ninth Congressional district defrauded voters by collecting unfilled ballots and then filling in the rest of it to favor the campaign’s candidate, leading to a new election.\n\nFinally, skeptics of convenience voting methods such as VBM argue that they encourage voters to cast their ballots before all the information from the campaign is revealed, thus putting early voters at a civic disadvantage. In response, as more voters cast early ballots by mail or in person, campaigns have less incentive to hold onto negative information about their opponents in the hope of gaining an advantage through an October surprise. Empirically, it's important to note that the earliest voters tend to be the strongest partisans and, thus less likely to be swayed by last-minute information."
