        "text": "Part of the History of NOAA Fisheries in the Northeast\n\n1871-1880\n\n1871\n\nThe United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, formed on February 9 is the first federal agency concerned with natural resource\n\nThe nation's first fisheries laboratory is established at Woods Hole by the U.S. Fish Commission, the forerunner of today's NOAA Fisheries Service. The first U.S. Fish Commissioner, Spencer F. Baird, selects Woods Hole for its central location, support facilities, clean water, and good access to offshore fishing sites. A survey of marine life in local waters begins. Others conduct research at Cape Hatteras and on the Great Lakes. Baird personally investigates the alleged decrease of southern New England fisheries, taking testimony from many witnesses.\n\nThe Fish Commission is directed by Congress\n\n\"...to determine whether a diminution of the number of food-fishes of the coast and lakes of the U.S. has taken place; and, if so, to what causes the same is due; and whether any and what protective prohibitory or precautionary measures should be adopted in the premises...\"\n\nBaird immediately initiates a broad spectrum of ecological research.\n\nVinal N. Edwards, the first permanent federal employee of the fisheries service is employed as an all-around technician, a position he holds until his death in 1919. Edwards had no scientific background but was often described as an \"intuitive\" naturalist with an encyclopedic knowledge of the ocean processes and marine life in and around Woods Hole.\n\n1872\n\nAmerican Fish Culturists Association appropriates $15,000 for the U.S government to begin fish culture development, adding aquaculture to the Fish Commission's charge.\n\nThe Commission's summer station is set up at Eastport, Maine, and a special herring study is made.\n\nOn October 23, 30,000 chinook salmon eggs are shipped from California to the East Coast; all but 7,000 die in transit. About 200-300 hatch and are raised to fingering size and planted unsuccessfully in the Susquehanna River in March 1873.\n\n1873\n\nThe Fish Commission's summer research station in Portland, Maine, is augmented by the loan of an 80-ton steamer from the U.S. Navy. Outer waters between Mount Desert and Cape Cod are also explored with the U.S. Coast Survey steamer Bache\n\nBaird publishes the first of the annual US Fish Commission reports on the Commission's operations and research. The series provides a much-needed outlet for scientific reports on the Nation's fisheries and oceanographic studies. The first edition details Baird's findings on \"The Condition of the Sea Fisheries of the South Coast of New England in 1871 and 1872.\"\n\n1874\n\n\"Baggage-masters will allow agents of the U.S. Fish Commission to ride in the baggage-cars and to attend to the tanks which they have charge.\" - A. J. Cassett, Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\n\nThe Commission's research work is centered at Noank, Connecticut, and an attempt is made to introduce shad to European waters.\n\n1875\n\nA combination of federal and private funds make renovation of a shed into a more permanent, two-story lab at Woods Hole complete with a windmill for pumping seawater to research aquaria.\n\n1876\n\nThe Fish Commission presents a large exhibit of fish culture methods and aspects of American fisheries at the Philadelphia International Exhibition; carp are first imported from Germany\n\n1877\n\n\"To conductors and Baggage-masters. You will permit his Fish Commission deputy's cans of living fish to be carried in the baggage cars.\" - Gen'l Superintendent, Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway Co., Cleveland.\n\nThe first successful U.S. east coast sardine cannery is started at Eastport, Maine, 43 years after the world's first sardine cannery began operating in Nantes, France.\n\nFish Commission investigations resume at Salem, Massachusetts, and later at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Federal carp ponds are established in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"The War Department furnished Baird station a military guard this year, which proved to be a very valuable acquisition.\" - Livingston Stone.\n\nThe Halifax Fishery Commission is charged with settling the amount of compensation to be paid by the United States for the privilege of fishing off the eastern Canadian Provinces and Commissioner Baird is summoned to testify. Baird's assistant, G. Brown Goode, reports that \"The information at that time available concerning the fisheries was found to be so slight and imperfect that a plan for systematic investigation of the subject was arranged and partially undertaken.\" The full study of America's fisheries and their history and status would later be published as part of the Tenth U.S. Census.\n\nThe first major monograph on the menhaden, a prolific and widely useful species, is published by G. Brown Goode, Assistant Fish Commissioner. The menhaden is still one of the Nation's most important fisheries, and research into its ecology and utilization continues today.\n\nJ.R. Shotwell, in a letter to Baird, describes the efforts of a New Jersey gas company to remove harmful products from distilled coal waste before dumping in the Delaware River.\n\n1878\n\nThe U.S. Fish Commission occupies a permanent station in Gloucester, Massachusetts to supplement fish propagation studies ongoing at the Woods Hole Station. This would eventually become the first seafood technology lab in the United States.\n\nThe first clam cannery in the United States is established at Pine Point, Maine. Also, crab is first canned at Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nThe breeding of cod and haddock is accomplished at Gloucester, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Commission publishes six annual or biannual reports totaling 5,650 pages during 1871-78 and they provide a much needed outlet for fisheries and oceanographic research papers and reports.\n\n1879\n\nCommissioner Baird initiates a landmark study on the composition of fish to determine their food and nutritive values. The research, conducted by W. O. Atwater and Charles Woods, provides important benchmark data, many of which are still useful today.\n\nThe field of fish technology opens with investigations of methods for freezing fish, and in 1882 net preservatives are studied.\n\nThe Fish Commission's summer station is located at Provincetown, Massachusetts.\n\nOyster propagation is accomplished cooperatively with the Maryland Fish Commission and under the direction of Major Ferguson. Distribution of the German carp is also initiated — a move later rued.\n\nThe Fish Commission, cooperating with the Superintendent of the Tenth U.S. Census, dispatches specialists to all parts of the Nation to study and record the biological, statistical, and practical aspects of all U.S. fisheries. The results are published in 1887 as a huge, comprehensive seven-volume work on The Fisheries and Fishery Industries of the United States.\n\nThe Fish Commission's first research vessel, the 156.5-foot U.S.S. Fish Hawk, is launched. The coal-burning steamer is built to serve as a floating hatchery in coastal waters for shad, herring, and striped bass production.\n\n1880\n\nThe Fish Commission's summer station is at Newport, Rhode Island, where the Fish Hawk operates for the season. Over 50 Commission investigators are in the field.\n\nSpencer Baird receives the first-honor prize at the Berlin Exposition from the Emperor of Germany, not only for the excellence of the Commission's fisheries display, but also owing to the international regard of Baird who was widely seen as the preeminent fish culturist for his successful promotion of fish culture and fish acclimatization—exchanging fish and fish ova throughout the world.\n\nProf. Addison E. Verrill estimates that in just 10 years, research, mainly by the Commission, has added 1,000 new species to the list of known marine creatures in New England waters—ot including finfishes. About 100 newly discovered finfishes were added during the same period on the Atlantic coast.\n\nDespite having a very stylish Washington address (1445 Massachusetts Ave.) Baird is characterized in an article \"Celebrities at Home\" as dressing in the plain and slightly old-fashioned style of a well-to-do country English farmer.\n\n\"This is ... a most wonderful fauna, vastly exceeding in richness and extent on anything known to science.\"-S. F Baird, on results of explorations of the Gulfstream slope 80 miles south of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.\n\n1881-1900\n\n1882\n\nThe lab receives its first presidential visit, from Chester A. Arthur. Arthur is taken for a collecting cruise off Woods Hole in the Commission steamer Despatch.\n\nIn April vessels report countless dead tilefish floating in an area from Georges Banks to Cape May. A conservative estimate made by Capt. J.W.Collins placed the number of dead fish at upwards of 1,438,720,000 (that's 1.43 billion fish!). Allowing 10 pounds for each fish he estimated this amounted to 288 pounds for every man, woman and child in the U.S. at the time. The mystery was never explained, but a plausible explanation for the deaths seemed to be a sudden chilling of the deeper waters along this stretch of ocean. No catch of tilefish was reported again for 15 years.\n\nIn March, the 234-foot U.S.S. Albatross, the first U.S. research vessel built exclusively for fisheries and oceanographic research, is launched. The iron-hull, twin-screw vessel was designed to conduct its marine investigations in any part of the world's seas.\n\nVolume 1, for 1881, of the Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission is published. \"... for the purpose of utilizing and of promptly publishing the large amount of interesting correspondence of the Fish Commission in reference to matters pertaining to fish culture and to the apparatus, methods, and results of the fisheries. Parts of the text were distributed signature by signature, the remainder in bound annual volumes.\" Now the quarterly, peer-reviewed journal Fishery Bulletin, this series has been in continuous publication for 115 years.\n\n1883\n\nWoods Hole, Massachusetts property is deeded to the U.S. Government for the construction of the Commission's first full-time research laboratory.\n\nBaird suggests that purer forms of salt be used to solve the problem of red cod a discoloration found in cured cod.\n\n1884\n\nConstruction of the laboratory building at Woods Hole begins.\n\n1885\n\nThe first permanent lab is completed, built on land given for the purpose by a local resident (Joseph Story Fay) with a combination of federal and private funds. The building remains useful until 1958. Because of the permanent facility, the Commission's research vessels Fish Hawk and the world-renowned Albatross begin to use Woods Hole as a base.\n\nIn summer, Atlantic shad are transported in a railroad car to the Pacific coast and planted in Washington Territory and Oregon waters. On return, clams, Tapes staminea, are collected and brought back to Woods Hole\n\nBaird writes excitedly about acquisition of female and male pygmy sperm whales taken from Atlantic waters. These whales had been known to exist only in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n1886\n\nThe Grampus, another Commission research ship, is completed, providing a revolutionary new fishing vessel design.\n\n1887\n\nOn August 19, Spencer F. Baird, first Commissioner of Fisheries, dies at Wood Hole, Massachusetts. Confined to a wheelchair in his latter days, he reportedly requested that he be wheeled around the station for final contact with his handiwork. He is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery, Washington.\n\n\"... There rises again the thought that kept recurring then, that the sea is very ancient, that it ebbed and flowed before man appeared on the planet, and will ebb and flow after he and his words have disappeared; and a singular, indefinite impression, as if something had passed that was, in some fashion, great and mysterious, and ancient like the sea itself.\"- Edwin Linton, speaking of the day of Baird's death\n\nThe Marine Biological Laboratory, private research facility, is established at Woods Hole, and staff are given free access to Commission Facilities\n\nRainbow trout, a western species, is doing so well in eastern U.S. fish culture stations that shipments of them from the west are discontinued.\n\nIn September, George Brown Goode temporarily succeeds Baird, but he resigns after 6 months to devote full time to his duties as Director of the U.S. National Museum.\n\nThe huge and extensive five-section, seven-volume review of the history and conditions of U.S. fisheries is published by the Commission. Edited by George Brown Goode, it is titled The Fisheries and Fishery of the United States.\n\n1888\n\nOn January 20, Congress establishes the U.S. Fish Commission as an independent agency of the Federal government and terminates its administrative relationship with the Smithsonian Institution. Marshall McDonald is appointed Commissioner at a salary of $5,000 per year\n\nThe Albatross sails to the Pacific Ocean where it is used for fisheries and oceanographic research and for marine mammal (fur seal) law enforcement patrols until 1914\n\nW. O. Atwater publishes the 200-page report on the nutritive values of various fishes in the Report of the Commissioner of Fisheries for 1888-1889. It provides a basic reference on proximate composition of fish and shellfish and remains valuable today for comparison of composition ranges in relation to species size and distribution\n\n1889\n\nH.V.P. Wilson publishes his classic fish embryology paper on sea bass, based on his work at the Fish Commission lab.\n\nPacific halibut is shipped to the east coast by rail, and as the market develops and demand grows, the fishery gradually extends farther offshore.\n\nThe Albatross is ordered to escort the Dawes Commission along the Pacific coast.\n\n1890\n\nThe Albatross carries two presidentially-appointed commissions to study the plight of the fur seal; their reports confirm that seal populations are being seriously harmed by pelagic (high-seas) seal hunting.\n\n1891-1900\n\n1891\n\nSeptember 6, Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts: During a southeasterly storm, United States Fish Commission schooner Grampus, bound to Woods Hole from Hyannis, ran ashore on L'Hommidieu shoal, Vineyard Sound. United States Fish Commissioner Col. McDonald, his wife and daughter, Assistant Commissioner Capt. J. W. Collins and Mrs. Bean and Patten, left the schooner in a dory, and succeeded in making a safe landing at Falmouth. The Grampus was later refloated.\n\n1892\n\nThe last of four carloads with 1,000 specimens of fish representing 40 species is delivered by the Commission to the Chicago World's Fair for a fish culture exhibit.\n\nA contract to complete a fishway at Great Falls, Virginia, on the Potomac River is accepted for $15,000.\n\n1893\n\nThe U.S. Fish Commission becomes responsible for northern fur seal research.\n\n1895\n\nMarshall McDonald steps down as commissioner of the Bureau of Fisheries and Herbert A. Gill becomes acting commissioner.\n\nThe Commission's Division of Propagation and Distribution of Food Fishes is established.\n\n1896\n\nSalmon research from the Albatross leads Congress to regulate Alaskan salmon fishing with net restrictions, closed seasons, spawning escapement requirements, etc.\n\nThe rainbow trout is now successfully acclimatized in almost every state east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n1897\n\nThe Fish Commission publishes A Manual of Fish Culture, and 60 years later it is still considered the most complete text on the subject.\n\n1898\n\nGeorge M. Bowers becomes commissioner of the Bureau of Fisheries.\n\n1899\n\nFor the first time, total Commission production of fish eggs, fry, and larger fish exceeds one billion.\n\n1900\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt signs a law for construction of the second Federal fisheries laboratory in the United States at Beaufort, North Carolina. Its first director is Henry Van Peters Wilson, a University of North Carolina professor.\n\n1901-1910\n\n1901\n\nCharles A. Wilson begins summer work at the Woods Hole Laboratory, that culminates in publication of The Copepods of the Woods Hole Region Massachusetts, a standard reference in copepod biology.\n\nThe Commission employs a fish pathologist on a part-time basis.\n\n1902\n\nThe American Fisheries Society places a granite monument to Baird at the Woods Hole Lab, where it remains today in a public park.\n\n1903\n\nBy Act of February 14, the U.S. Fish Commission and the Office of the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries are placed in the Department of Commerce and Labor which is also created by the new Act. The transfers take place on July 1.\n\nThe formerly independent Fish Commission is named the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. The new Bureau retains the scientific responsibilities of the Fish Commission and incorporates other fishery-related functions: i.e. jurisdiction, supervision, and control over the fur seal of Alaska are assumed from the Department of the Treasury.\n\n1904\n\nOne million whitefish, 100,000 brook trout, 53,000 lake trout, and 50,000 landlocked salmon eggs leave New York harbor for Argentina. Losses are later reported as only 10% except for lake trout which began hatching en route.\n\n1905\n\nIn 1905, the fishing on New England banks was revolutionized by the introduction of the otter trawl \"... which met with a great deal of opposition from many members of the industry.\" - Herbert W. Graham, writing in 1952.\n\n1906\n\nBureau testing begins on a new wooden shipping case that holds 24 trays of eggs. Each tray can hold 192,000 lake trout eggs.\n\nThe Albatross sails on a lengthy research cruise to the Aleutian Islands, Russia and Japan, making extensive biological collections and discovering hundreds of new genera and fishes. Capt. LeRoy Mason Garrett, U.S. Navy, is thrown from the vessel in a violent storm and is lost at sea.\n\n\"The 1906 cruise of the United States Fisheries steamer Albatross had for its especial object the investigation of the fish and fisheries of the Japanese seas, where the ship spent most of the time. The journey out was made by way of the Aleutian Islands, at several of which they stopped, Petropaulski, Kamchatka, and the Kuril islands. They returned by way of Honolulu. As the purpose of the expedition was the investigation of fish and marine invertebrates, and the ship was usually occupied in work offshore, their opportunities for collecting birds were rather limited, especially as their time was largely taken up by their duties in connection with the marine work, as the representative of the Bureau of Fisheries.\"\n\n— from the paper entitled \" The Birds Collected and Observed during the Cruise of the United States Fisheries Steamer \"Albatross\" in the North Pacific Ocean, and in the Bering, Okhotsk, Japan, and Eastern Seas, from April to December 1906\"\n\n1907\n\nRachel Louise Carson is born on May 27. The famed conservationist, author, marine biologist, and Bureau employee wrote \"The Sea Around Us\" (1951), \"Silent Spring\" (1962), and other books that heightened public environmental awareness.\n\nThe Albatross leaves San Francisco for a 2-1/2 year cruise to Midway, Guam, Philippines, Borneo, Dutch East Indies, and Formosa.\n\n1908\n\nA.E. Verrill completes his study of the specimens collected during the survey that began at the Woods Hole lab in 1871. The project has formed the basis of hundreds of scientific papers on invertebrates. The specimen collection includes some 2,000 species taken from 3,000 locations in New England and is eventually given to the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard with duplicates in the Peabody Museum of Yale University.\n\n1911-1920\n\nThe Albatross returns to San Francisco after a trip along the California coast in which six yearling elephant seals, thought to be extinct, are captured and sent to the New York Aquarium.\n\n1912\n\nH.B. Bigelow begins sixteen years of research on the oceanic fisheries in the Gulf of Maine. This fundamental work, along with extensive investigations with W.B. Schroeder results in the 1953 treatise Fishes of the Gulf of Maine, a standard reference in the field.\n\n1913\n\nThe Bureau of Fisheries publishes results of a massive bottom sampling program operated out of Woods Hole, describing the distribution of about 250 animal and plant species at several hundred sampling stations.\n\nThe Department of Labor is separated from the Department of Commerce, which retains the Bureau of Fisheries.\n\n1914\n\nA small office opens in Seattle's historic Smith Tower Building as an administrative center for the Bureau's Pacific coast operations.\n\n1915\n\nThe Department of Commerce and Labor becomes the Department of Commerce.\n\nCongress approves the appointment of a full-time fish pathologist to the Bureau staff.\n\n1917\n\nThe Albatross undergoes repairs for a November transfer to the U.S. Navy for the duration of WWI. It is returned to the Bureau in 1919\n\nResearch emphasis at the lab is changed from general interest to work concentrating on the immediate increase of aquatic food supplies—a change precipitated by the onset of World War I. During this time, the Navy occupies the lab.\n\n1918\n\nThe U.S. Navy takes over the Bureau's Beaufort, North Carolina fisheries laboratory in World War I to study the fouling of ship bottoms, and returns it to the Bureau in 1920.\n\nFunding is approved for the first fishery products laboratory in Washington, D.C. to house rooms for drying, smoking, canning and refrigerating of fish. An experimental kitchen is also built.\n\n1919\n\nThe Bureau reports that, \"In no branch of the fisheries is there greater need for exhaustive study than in the methods or preservation of fishery products\"\n\nVinal Edwards dies on April 5. Vinal was the first permanent employee of the Bureau of Fisheries.\n\n1920\n\nFire destroys the dining hall, kitchen, and laundry room of the Woods Hole Laboratory\n\nWith cooperation of the Naval Aviation Service and Chesapeake Bay fishermen, the Bureau inaugurates use of aeroplanes to locate menhaden.\n\n1921-1930\n\n1921\n\nThe Albatross is decommissioned and retired from service on October 29, but the scientific research into as well as the naming and cataloging of the many hundreds of thousands of specimens it has collected will continue for decades.\n\nFor the first time, Bureau of Fisheries scientists begin research to determine fat contents of fish oils at its Washington, D.C. laboratory. Such research would continue during 1926-30 at a Reedville, Virginia laboratory on menhaden oil manufacture. Later Bureau research would target the vitamin content of fish oils and other healthful and nutritional attributes of fish oils.\n\n1923\n\nHerbert F. Prytherch makes his first report on his work with artificial propagation of oysters. He works in facilities provided by the Connecticut Oyster Farms Company of Milford, Connecticut. Increased interest in molluscan culture for stock enhancement and direct sale eventually leads to establishment of a full-scale research facility at Milford, which is still a laboratory of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, concentrating on pollution effects on marine life and molluscan and finfish aquaculture.\n\n1924\n\nN.A. Cobb begins to spend his summers working at Woods Hole fisheries lab.
