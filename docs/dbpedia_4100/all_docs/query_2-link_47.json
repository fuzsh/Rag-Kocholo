        "text": "Show all FAQs\n\nCategories\n\nTrademark Help - Disclosure of Public Information\n\nI am not the applicant or registrant but my personal information is disclosed. How can I get it removed from the public record?\n\nIf personally identifying information, such as your name or address, has been disclosed in the public record for an application or registration that you are not involved with, please send an informal written request to TMFeedback@uspto.gov to remove the information from the record.\n\nTrademark Help - Fastener Quality Act - Application\n\nHow may I send in my Fastener Quality Act (FQA) application?\n\nFQA application forms are accepted by U.S. mail or email. The instructions on page two of the application contain all of the submission details. Forms should only be submitted via one method. Duplicate copies of forms are not to be submitted. If you wish to confirm receipt, please do not send a second copy with your request.\n\nShould I mail or courier a paper copy of my Fastener Quality Act (FQA) application that I have already submitted electronically?\n\nNo. Multiple copies of FQA applications could lead to duplicative charges of FQA fees and duplicative recordals. Please choose one method to submit your FQA application - email or delivery by postal service or private courier. If you have any concerns as to whether or not your submission has been received by the USPTO, you may email TMFQA@uspto.gov. Do not send another copy with your follow up email.\n\nThe application form says I must file a copy of my prior recordal. I do not have a copy of my prior recordal. How can I get a copy?\n\nPlease send requests for copies of recordals to TMFQA@uspto.gov and include an address where a copy may be mailed.\n\nHow long will it take before I know if my application has been accepted?\n\nThe USPTO processes applications for recordal and renewal in the order in which they are received. In the event a submission does not contain all of the required elements, the USPTO will return the entire application, along with a letter explaining the missing elements. No fees are processed for incomplete applications. A new application containing all of the required elements must be submitted. Generally, processing time varies from 7 to 10 working days, with delays possible due to federal holidays.\n\nOnce my application is processed, what will I receive?\n\nAfter recordal of a new application, the owner or the owner's attorney of record, if provided, will receive a Certificate of Recordal depicting the mark, the owner's information, and the date of recordal from which renewals are to be calculated.\n\nAfter processing a renewal application, the USPTO does not issue a new certificate. Renewals are noted in Office records and appear on the Insignia Registry when it is updated. The Registry is updated quarterly, typically in January, April, July, and October.\n\nAfter an alpha-numeric designation is reactivated to the original owner, the USPTO will issue a new Certificate of Recordal with the new recordal date from which to calculate renewals. When a new owner files an application for re-activation, the new owner is not issued a new recordal date and only shall remain in active status until the expiration of the five year period that began upon the issuance of the alphanumeric designation to its original owner or to any time remaining in a renewal period granted thereafter. Thus, if a new owner requests reactivation with only a few months remaining until a renewal is due, the new owner must also file a renewal application in the time allowed or in the grace period, with the required late fee.\n\nWhat if I wish to send in my FQA application by private courier or delivery service, such as DHL, Federal Express, or UPS?\n\nFQA application forms accompanied by checks or money orders for the required fees may be submitted by private courier or delivery service, though use of such methods is not encouraged. If used, however, submissions must be sent to the Trademark Assistance Center (TAC) at the USPTO's headquarters at the following address:\n\nTrademark Assistance Center\n\nMadison East, Concourse Level Room C 55\n\n600 Dulany Street\n\nAlexandria, VA 22314\n\nPrivate couriers and delivery services cannot deliver to the US Postal Service mailing address provided on the application instructions.\n\nHow do I identify FQA Fees on the Credit Card Payment Form?\n\nFQA fees are Trademark Fees, but they require a \"Description of Request\" as being an \"FQA application fee\" or \"FQA renewal fee\" or \"FQA late fee and renewal fee\" as appropriate. If the Recordal is based on a U.S. Trademark Application or Registration, the application Serial Number or Registration Number must be included in the appropriate space. In the case of an application for a new recordal of an alpha-numeric designation, the \"Description of Request\" should indicate \"New FQA alpha-numeric designation\" or \"renewal of recordal [please identify assigned alpha-numeric designation, e.g. 01PZ]\". The credit card payment form may be found on the USPTO website at http://www.uspto.gov/forms/2038-fill.pdf.\n\nTrademark Help - Fastener Quality Act - Renewal/Reactivation\n\nOur company transferred the alphanumeric designation issued by the USPTO to another party. Can the new owner reactivate?\n\nYes, an alphanumeric designation can be transferred or assigned, and reactivated upon application by the assignee. An application must include a copy of the pertinent portion of the document assigning rights in the alphanumeric designation to the new owner. The application must be filed within six months of the date of assignment. 15 C.F.R. ยง280.323(e)\n\nI received a letter saying my insignia has been declared inactive because my trademark was abandoned/cancelled/expired. Can I file a new recordal application for the same mark?\n\nUnless a new trademark application has been filed for the same mark, no. Certificates of recordal designated inactive due to cancellation or expiration of the trademark registration or abandonment of the trademark application on which the recordal is based cannot be activated. Recordals may only be based on a valid registration or pending application.\n\nI received a letter saying my insignia has been declared inactive, but I'm still using my trademark as my fastener insignia. Can I file a new recordal application for the same mark?\n\nYes, certificates of recordal designated inactive to due to the failure to maintain the recordal shall be deemed active only if the certificate holder files an application for recordal with the prescribed fee and attaches a copy of the expired certificate of recordal. 15 C.F.R. ยง280.320(e)\n\nTrademark Help - Fastener Quality Act - Amendment of Insignia\n\nOur insignia has changed slightly and we have requested that our mark be amended. Can our certificate of recordal be updated?\n\nNo. An amendment of the mark in a trademark application or registration that forms the basis for a certificate of recordal will result in the Director of the USPTO declaring the recordal inactive. The certificate of recordal shall become inactive as of the date the amendment is filed. You may file a new application for recordal of the new version of the mark on the FQA registry.\n\nTrademark Help - Fastener Quality Act - Change of Owner\n\nOur company changed its name. What must we do to update our recordal?\n\nRequests to update recordals with a change of name and/or change of address may be submitted to the FQA mailing address, or by facsimile to 571-273-8950, or to the TMFQA@uspto.gov email box. Requests regarding any change of address or change of name must be filed no later than six months after the change.\n\nOur company was bought by another company and they have acquired all of our trademarks. Do they have to file a new application for recordal of the insignia we already recorded on the FQA registry?\n\nYes, once the ownership of the trademark on which an FQA recordal is based is assigned, the recordal by the previous owner is considered \"inactive.\" The new owner may file a new application to record the same insignia on the FQA insignia registry in their name.\n\nI received a letter saying my insignia has been declared inactive because my trademark was assigned to a new owner. Can I reactivate my recordal?\n\nNo, certificates of recordal designated inactive due to transfer or assignment of a trademark application or registration cannot be reactivated. An assigned trademark application or registration may form the basis for a new application for recordal on the fastener insignia registry by the new owner.\n\nCan the Certificate of Recordal be transferred to a new owner?\n\nNo. The Certificate of Recordal may not be transferred or assigned, but it may be amended only to show a change of name or change of address.\n\nTrademark Help - Fastener Quality Act - Change of Address\n\nOur recordal is inactive. Do we still need to file an update to our name or change of address?\n\nYes. The holder must notify the USPTO of name or address changes whether the certificate of recordal is in an active or inactive status.\n\n15 C.F.R. ยง280.321\n\nTrademark Help - Fastener Quality Act - Basics\n\nWho must submit an application for recordal of an insignia on the Fastener Recordal Registry?\n\nThe USPTO does not provide assistance in determining whether or not a manufacturer of fasteners must submit an application.\n\nThe following is from the National Institute of Standards and Technology Weights and Measures Division (Phone: 301-975-4019):\n\nFasteners covered under the FQA are defined as limited to bolts, nuts, screws and studs (having a nominal diameter of 6 millimeters/0.25 inch or greater), or direct tension-indicating washers that are through-hardened (or meet a consensus standard that calls for through-hardening) and manufactured to standards and specifications of consensus standards organizations or government agencies that require a grade mark.\n\nMany fasteners are exempted from coverage including those:\n\n- that are part of an assembly\n\n- that are ordered for use as a spare, substitute, service or replacement part unless that part is in a package containing more than 75 of any such part at the time of sale or that part is contained in an assembly kit\n\n- produced and marked as ASTM A 307 Grade A;\n\n- produced in accordance with the ASTM F 432 standard;\n\n- specifically manufactured for an aircraft if the quality is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration or by a foreign airworthiness authority;\n\n- manufactured in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000, 9001, 9002, or TS16949; Quality system (QS) 9000; or other fastener quality assurance system defined by law; or\n\n- manufactured to a proprietary standard.\n\nTo encourage the use of quality management systems such as QS 9000, fasteners are exempt from the FQA if they are manufactured in a facility using such a system.\n\nWhat are the necessary FQA fees?\n\nNew applications require a US $20 fee. Renewals are also US $20. If the renewal application is submitted within the six months after the fifth anniversary of the recordal, a late surcharge of US $20 is required in addition to the US $20 renewal fee. If a renewal application is not submitted by the end of the six-month grace period, the owner must reapply for the same mark in a \"new\" application, which must be accompanied by the US $20 application fee.\n\nWhat is the Fastener Quality Act?\n\nThe Fastener Quality Act (FQA), Public Law 101-592, was signed by President George H.W. Bush on November 16, 1990. Since its enactment, the FQA has been amended three times (Pub L. 104-113, Pub L. 105-234, and Pub L. 106-34) to further clarify and define the requirements of the original FQA.\n\nThe FQA protects the public safety by: (1) requiring that certain fasteners sold in commerce conform to the specifications to which they are represented to be manufactured, (2) providing for accreditation of laboratories engaged in fastener testing, and (3) requiring inspection, testing and certification in accordance with standardized methods.\n\nTrademark Help - General - Other\n\nIs a trademark search necessary?\n\nIt is advisable to conduct a search of the office records before filing an application. A search for pending, registered and dead trademarks may be conducted on the USPTO website using the trademark search system or by visiting the Public Search Facility located on the first floor of the Madison East building at 600 Dulany St., Alexandria , VA 22313 between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.\n\nAlso, certain information may be searched at a Patent and Trademark Depository Library (PTDL). To find your nearest PTDL, go to www.uspto.gov/go/ptdl. If you need assistance in searching for trademarks, you may wish to locate a U.S.-licensed attorney specializing in trademark law. Local bar associations and the Yellow Pages usually have attorney listing broken down by specialties.\n\nWhat is a trademark and a service mark?\n\nA trademark includes any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination used, or intended to be used, in commerce to identify and distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or seller from goods manufactured or sold by others, and to indicate the source of the goods. In short, a trademark is a brand name.\n\nA service mark is any word, name, symbol, device, or any combination, used, or intended to be used, in commerce, to identify and distinguish the services of one provider from the services provided by others, and to indicate the source of the services.\n\nHow do I obtain a copy of a trademark document?\n\nThe USPTO allows you to access copies of the documents in almost all pending applications, as well as many registrations. The Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (TSDR) database allows you to view, download, and print documents contained in our electronic records. Also, for a fee you can request a copy of your trademark registration by contacting our Certified Copy Center.\n\nA copy of the trademark registration is $3 per registration. Certified copies are $15 per registration. A certified copy of the registration is also called a โtitle and status,โ as it will include the current status of the trademark and current ownership information according to our records. It will also include a certification statement, a seal, and an authorized signature affirming that the registration is an official USPTO copy. You can pay by credit card, USPTO deposit account, or by electronic funds transfer (EFT).\n\nWhere can I get information about the Trademark Expo?\n\nPlease visit our Trademark Expo page.\n\nWhat is the difference between TM and the R within the circle ยฎ?\n\nUse of the TM and SM symbols may be governed by local, state, or foreign laws and the laws of a pertinent jurisdiction to identify the marks that a party claims rights to. The federal registration symbol, the R enclosed within a circle, may be used once the mark is actually registered in the USPTO. Even though an application is pending, the registration symbol may not be used before the mark has actually become registered.\n\nThe federal registration symbol should only be used on goods or services that are the subject of the federal trademark registration.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Several foreign countries use the letter R enclosed within a circle to indicate that a mark is registered in that country. Use of the symbol by the holder of a foreign registration may be proper.\n\nWhat constitutes interstate commerce?\n\nFor goods, \"Interstate commerce\" involves sending the goods across state lines with the mark displayed on the goods or the packaging for the goods. With services, \"Interstate commerce\" involves offering a service to those in another state or rendering a service that affects interstate commerce (e.g. restaurants, gas stations, hotels, etc.).\n\nTrademark Help - General - Other - Fees & Payments - Fees โ General Information - Other\n\nWhat is the filing fee for a trademark?\n\nInformation is available in the Trademark fees section of the Fee schedule.\n\nTrademark Help - Getting Started - Other - General\n\nHow do I register my trademark?\n\nComplete an application using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS). You will need to respond to office actions and file notices of change of address, allegations of use and requests for extension of time to file a statement of use through TEAS. You can check the status of your application through the Trademark Status & Document Retrieval (TSDR) system. If you do not have access to the Internet, you can call the Trademark Assistance Center at 1-800-786-9199 (press 1) or 1-571-272-9250 to request a paper form. For further information about the applying for a trademark registration, see Basic Facts about Trademarks.\n\nShould I have an attorney?\n\nIt depends on the location of your domicile, specifically, the place you reside and intend to be your principal home or principal place of business (an entity's headquarters).\n\nYes, if you are a foreign-domiciled trademark applicant. You must be represented at the USPTO by an attorney who is licensed to practice law in the United States.\n\nNo, if you are a trademark applicant domiciled in the United States or its territories. Nevertheless, we strongly encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney who specializes in trademark law to guide you through the registration process.\n\nFor more information, see the August 3, 2019 USPTO trademark rules change.\n\nMost applicants use U.S.-licensed trademark attorneys for legal advice regarding the use of their trademark, filing an application, and the likelihood of success in the registration process, since not all applications proceed to registration. A U.S.-licensed private trademark attorney (not associated with the USPTO) may help you avoid many potential pitfalls.\n\nHow much does it cost to apply for a trademark?\n\nThe filing fees for an application filed through the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) are as follows:\n\n$250 per class of goods or services for a TEAS Plus application that meets the requirements of 37 C.F.R. ยง2.22; or\n\n$350 per class of goods or services for a TEAS Standard application.\n\nIf your application is filed based on a bona fide intent to use the mark in commerce, additional documents and fees will be required at a later time.\n\nIn general, you must file your application through TEAS, and pay the fee using a credit card, existing USPTO deposit account, or electronic funds transfer (EFT).\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Fees are subject to change and should therefore be verified before submission to the USPTO. You may obtain the current schedule of fees.\n\nWhy should I obtain a trademark?\n\nHere are some specific benefits of having a federally registered trademark:\n\nConstructive notice nationwide of the trademark owner's claim.\n\nEvidence of ownership of the trademark.\n\nJurisdiction of federal courts may be invoked.\n\nRegistration can be used as a basis for obtaining registration in foreign countries.\n\nRegistration may be filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to prevent importation of infringing foreign goods.\n\nSee Recording your trademark with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n\nSee Computer Crime and Intellectual Property section of the Department of Justice\n\nWhat is a trademark?\n\nTrademarks protect words, names, symbols, sounds, or colors that distinguish goods and services from those manufactured or sold by others and indicate the source of the goods. Trademarks, unlike patents, can be renewed forever as long as they are being used in commerce.\n\nTrademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n\nFederal trademark registration has several benefits:\n\nConstructive notice nationwide of the trademark owner's claim.\n\nEvidence of ownership of the trademark.\n\nJurisdiction of federal courts may be invoked.\n\nRegistration can be used as a basis for obtaining registration in foreign countries.\n\nRegistration may be filed with the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prevent importation of infringing foreign goods.\n\nThere are times when you may desire a combination of copyright, patent, and trademark protection for your work. You should consult an attorney to determine what forms of intellectual property protection are best suited to your needs.\n\nWhat are the benefits of federal trademark registration?\n\nOwning a federal trademark registration on the Principal Register provides several advantages, including:\n\nPublic notice of your claim of ownership of the mark;\n\nA legal presumption of your ownership of the mark and your exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on or in connection with the goods/services listed in the registration;\n\nThe ability to bring an action concerning the mark in federal court;\n\nThe use of the U.S. registration as a basis to obtain registration in foreign countries;\n\nThe ability to record the U.S. registration with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Service to prevent importation of infringing foreign goods;\n\nThe right to use the federal registration symbol ยฎ; and\n\nListing in the United States Patent and Trademark Office's online databases.\n\nMay a trademark filing company represent me before the USPTO?\n\nNo. Only a U.S.-licensed attorney may represent you before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). He or she must be an attorney licensed to practice law in a U.S. state and be an active member in good standing of the highest court of that state. Attorneys from other countries, except Canadian trademark attorneys or agents reciprocally recognized by the USPTOโs Office of Enrollment and Discipline (OED), may NOT practice before the USPTO.\n\nHow long does a trademark registration last?\n\nThe registration is valid as long as you timely file all post registration maintenance documents. You must file a \"Declaration of Use under Section 8\" between the fifth and sixth year following registration. In addition, you must file a combined \"Declaration of Use and Application for Renewal under Sections 8 and 9\" between the ninth and tenth year after registration, and every 10 years thereafter. If these documents are not timely filed, your registration will be cancelled and cannot be revived or reinstated. For more information read about keeping your registration alive.\n\nWhere can I find trademark forms?\n\nYou can find all USPTO's trademark forms in the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS). Two filing options are available for the initial application form: TEAS Plus and TEAS Standard. The TEAS application form allows you to pay by credit card, electronic funds transfer, or through an existing United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) deposit account.\n\nWill the USPTO conduct a search for me?\n\nThe USPTO cannot search your mark for you prior to filing. After filing, the USPTO will conduct a search and will refuse to register your mark if there is another registered or pending mark similar to yours.\n\nIs registration of my mark guaranteed?\n\nNo. The examining attorney will review the application and may issue refusals based on the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. ยง1051 et seq., or the Trademark Rules of Practice, 37 C.F.R. Part 2.\n\nThe most common reasons for refusing registration are because the mark is:\n\nLikely to cause confusion with a mark in a registration or prior application;\n\nDescriptive for the goods/services;\n\nA geographic term;\n\nA surname;\n\nOrnamental as applied to the goods.\n\nFor a discussion of these and other possible refusals, see Chapter 1200 of the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (TMEP).\n\nThe examining attorney may also issue requirements concerning, for example:\n\nThe goods and services listed in the application;\n\nThe description of the mark;\n\nThe quality of the drawing;\n\nThe specimens\n\nWhere can I find trademark \"sound mark\" examples?\n\nYou can play examples of sound marks at https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/soundmarks/trademark-sound-mark-examples\n\nWhat are trademark monitoring and document filing services?\n\nYou may receive unsolicited communications from companies requesting fees for trademark-related services, such as monitoring and document filing. Although solicitations from these companies frequently display customer-specific information, including USPTO serial number or registration number and owner name, companies that offer these services are not affiliated or associated with the USPTO or any other federal agency. See Caution: misleading notices for more information.\n\nTrademark Help - Getting Started - Other\n\nHow can I get the status on my pending trademark application?\n\nOnce you receive a filing receipt containing the serial number of your application, you may check the status of your application through the Trademark Applications and Registrations Retrieval (TARR) database athttp://tarr.uspto.gov/ or by calling the Trademark Assistance Center at 571-272-9250 or 800-786-9199 (press 1).\n\nCan the USPTO do a trademark search?\n\nAfter a trademark application is filed, the USPTO will conduct a search of the records as part of the official examination process. The official search is not done for the applicant but rather to determine whether a mark which has been applied for can be registered. You can conduct a search online using the trademark search system or by visiting the Public Search Facility, located on the first floor of the Madison East building at 600 Dulany St., Alexandria , VA 22313 , is open to the public from 8:00 a.m. to 8 p.m. , Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. Assignment information is also available at the Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries throughout the United States.\n\nAlso, certain information may be searched at a Patent and Trademark Depository Library (PTDL). For information on the nearest PTDL, go to www.uspto.gov/go/ptdl. If you need to locate a U.S.-licensed attorney specializing in trademark law, local bar associations and the Yellow Pages usually have attorney listings broken down by specialties.\n\nHow do I record a trademark assignment?\n\nA trademark is intellectual property that may be transferred or sold. The law permits the transfer or sale of a trademark by means of a legal document called an Assignment. A properly executed assignment transfers all rights from the existing owner to another person (referred to as the Assignee). When the trademark is transferred, the Assignee becomes the new owner of the trademark and has the same rights as the original owner. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) records all assignment documents and any document that affects title. Documents that affect title include, but are not limited to, mergers, changes of names, security agreements, various liens, licenses, probate documents, and bankruptcy petitions.\n\nTrademark assignments can be filed electronically through Assignment Center. You will need to have a USPTO.gov account with two-step verification to access Assignment Center. Assignment Center has answers to frequently asked questions about filing electronically.\n\nPlease note that with all assignments, the assignment information provided by the user will be recorded as provided and will not be verified or modified by the USPTO.\n\nFor additional information on filing a trademark assignment or documents affecting title, please call the Assignment Division between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time on normal business days at (571) 272-3350.\n\nHow long does it take to register a trademark?\n\nThere are many factors that affect how long it takes to register a trademark. Look at our application process timelines for more detailed timeline information based on your filing basis. You can check the current processing wait times to find out how long your trademark filing could take.\n\nGet information on the status of your application in the Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (TSDR) database or call the Trademark Assistance Center at (571) 272-9250 or (800) 786-9199. You should check on the status of your applications every three months.\n\nWhat resources are available if I have problems protecting or enforcing my intellectual property rights abroad?\n\nYour U.S. trademark registration grants you rights only in the U.S. If you want trademark protection in other countries, you must either:\n\nโข Submit an international application through the Madrid Protocol, or\n\nโข Submit a trademark application in each other country or regional trademark office.\n\nIf you have problems protecting or enforcing intellectual property rights in a foreign country, consult the IP Attachรฉ Program page.\n\nHow may I remove other personal information from the record?\n\nIf you erroneously submitted a document containing personal information or confidential documents other than a driver's license, social security number, credit card account number, or banking account number that you do not wish to be part of the public record, you may petition the Director of the USPTO to remove it from public view. Trademark Rule 2.25 provides that \"documents filed in the Office by the applicant or registrant become part of the official record and will not be returned or removed.\" The Director will waive this rule only if the petitioner can provide evidence that an extraordinary circumstance exists that warrants the removal of this information. As noted above, driver's licenses, social security numbers, credit card information, and banking information may be removed upon an informal written request TMPolicy@uspto.gov. Payments properly made with a credit card, charge card or bank card via the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) are confidential as well as secure, and are never made part of any publicly viewable USPTO record.\n\nThe USPTO records must always include the trademark owner's name and correspondence address and this information may be updated, but not removed. It also may be possible to provide redacted documents to replace portions of existing submissions that may be deemed personal or confidential if that information was not relied on during examination of the documents. Please note that after the USPTO renders a decision on the petition, the fee will not be refunded.\n\nLast, as noted above, all documents submitted in connection with an application or registration become part of the record for that file, including the petition itself. Therefore, if your petition is granted, the petition and redacted document will remain in the USPTO records, although the personal or confidential information will be hidden from public view.\n\nYou can file your petition through the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS). You should click on the overall Petitions Forms category from the TEAS front page and then select form number 3, Petition to the Director.\n\nCan I download trademark forms off the website?\n\nYes. You can access forms through the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS), from our apply online page. TEAS can be used to file an application for registration of a mark, response to examining attorney's Office action, notice of change of address, amendment to allege use, statement of use, request for extension of time to file a statement of use, affidavit of continued use under 15 U.S.C. ยง1058, affidavit of incontestability under 15 U.S.C. ยง1065, combined affidavit under 15 U.S.C. ยงยง1058 and 1065, or combined filing under 15 U.S.C. ยงยง1058 and 1059. Additional forms may be available through the Trademark Assistance Center at 1-800-786-9199 (or 1-571-272-9250).\n\nHow do I get a trademark?\n\nGenerally, you will be required to complete application online, check it for completeness, and submit it using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS). You will also need to respond to office actions and file notices of change of address and many other documents through TEAS. You can check the status of your application using our Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (TSDR) system. For further information about applying for a trademark registration, see Basic Facts about Trademarks.\n\nCan I apply for a Trademark online?\n\nYes. In general, you will be required to complete application online and submit it using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS). You can pay the fee by credit card, EFT, or through an existing USPTO deposit account.\n\nCan I fax in my trademark application?\n\nNo. The UPSTO will not accept an application transmitted by fax. Generally, applications must be filed electronically with the USPTO using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS).\n\nHow can I get trademark information on submitting a change of address?\n\nYou can file your change of address using the TEAS Change Address or Representation Form.\n\nHow can I change my correspondence address or owner address?\n\nYou can file your change of address using the TEAS Change of Address or Representation form.\n\nDo I need a U.S.-licensed attorney to file my trademark application?\n\nIt depends on the location of your domicile, specifically, the place you reside and intend to be your principal home or your principal place of business (an entity's headquarters).\n\nYes, if you are a foreign-domiciled trademark applicant. You must be represented at the USPTO by an attorney who is licensed to practice law in the United States.\n\nNo, if you are a trademark applicant domiciled in the United States or its territories. Nevertheless, we strongly encourage you to hire a U.S.-licensed attorney who specializes in trademark law to guide you through the registration process.\n\nFor more information about this, see the August 3, 2019 USPTO trademark rules change.\n\nWhat is the cost for filing an international application through the USPTO?\n\nAn international applicant must pay fees to the USPTO and to the International Bureau. The USPTO charges a fee for certifying international applications and transmitting them to the International Bureau, called a \"certification fee.\" The certification fee is $100.00 per class if the international application is based on a single U.S. application or registration and filed electronically, or $200 per class if filed on paper. The certification fee is $150.00 per class if the international application is based on more than one U.S. application or registration and filed electronically, or $250 per class if filed on paper.\n\nThe International Bureau requires payment of fees based on whether the reproduction of the mark is in black and white and/or in color, the particular Contracting Parties designated in the international application and the number of classes of goods and services indicated in the international application. The schedule of fees, individual fees and International Bureau Fee Calculator are posted on the WIPO web site at: http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/ . The international application fees must be paid directly to the International Bureau in Swiss francs.\n\nWhy does the USPTO make this information public?\n\nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) mandates the USPTO to provide records such as trademark applications and registrations for public inspection and copying. In order to adhere to the FOIA, trademark applications and registrations are available on the USPTO website so that the public may conveniently inspect and copy them, if desired.\n\nHow can I prevent my personal information from being placed on the USPTO website?\n\nIt is the responsibility of applicants and registrants to carefully consider the information provided to the USPTO to ensure that any information they wish to keep out of the public record is not included with their initial filing or in any subsequent filing submitted during the entire application and post-registration process. However, to file an application, certain minimum requirements must be met, including providing the owner's name and an address to receive correspondence. Any type of existing legal entity, including an individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association, or joint venture, may own a trademark. An applicant need not provide a telephone number as part of the application process, although providing a telephone number aids the USPTO in its ability to contact applicants.\n\nWill my trademark records help provide contact information for someone interested in researching my trademark?\n\nYes. The public may use records of trademark applications and registrations to identify the owner of a trademark and/or their attorneys/representatives. This information is valuable to the public and is often used to perform a clearance search when another party is considering whether to use a mark.\n\nWhy is my trademark application and registration information now appearing on Internet search engines?\n\nTrademark applications and registrations are public records. Individuals and private companies may use this public information to create third-party access to these records. Please note that the USPTO is not responsible for how these entities present this publicly available information. This information includes correspondence addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided in the initial application, as well as any changes or updates made to this information throughout the prosecution of the application or maintenance of the registration.\n\nWhat personal information may be removed from the record?\n\nDriver's licenses, social security numbers, credit card information, and banking information, can be removed upon an informal written request to TMFeedback@uspto.gov, because this highly sensitive personal information is not a filing requirement and therefore should be removed from the record immediately. Please note that any payments properly made with a credit card, charge card or bank card via the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) are confidential as well as secure, and are never made part of any publicly viewable USPTO record.\n\nWill my personal information be available to the public?\n\nYes. Please be aware that when you apply for a trademark registration you are making a public record. Accordingly, all of the information and documents you provide to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) during the prosecution of an application and maintenance of a registration are available to the public and will be viewable on the USPTO website even if the application abandons or the registration cancels or expires. Third-party websites and Internet search engines access and use this information, including your name as well as any addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses that you provide to the USPTO.\n\nHow can I see my trademark records?\n\nAs noted above, the USPTO is required by law to maintain records of trademark applications and registrations and to make them available for public inspection. Once submitted, an application becomes part of the public record and continues to be part of the public record whether the application is abandoned or the registration is surrendered, cancelled, or expired.\n\nYou can view and download documents contained in the USPTO's electronic records using the USPTO's Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (TSDR) system, at http://tsdr.uspto.gov/. To retrieve the records relating to your trademark, enter your application serial number or registration number and click the \"Documents\" button.\n\nWhat is the date of the international registration?\n\nThe date of the international registration is the date of receipt of the international application in the USPTO provided that the International Bureau receives the international application within 2 months of the date of receipt in the USPTO. If the International Bureau does not receive the international application within 2 months of the date of receipt in the USPTO, the date of the international registration will be the date of receipt by the International Bureau.\n\nCan a U.S. trademark owner file an international application directly at the International Bureau?\n\nNo. The international application must be filed through the USPTO. The USPTO must certify (review and confirm) that certain information in an international application based on a U.S. basic application or registration is the same as the information contained in the basic application or registration. The USPTO then forwards the international application to the International Bureau.\n\nWhich countries are members of the Madrid Protocol?\n\nThe countries that have joined the Madrid Protocol are called \"Contracting Parties.\" A current list of the Contracting Parties is available online at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) website: http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?lang=en&treaty_id=8.\n\nMay an applicant submit their response to the IB's irregularity notice regarding reclassification and/or amendment to the goods and/or services directly to the IB?\n\nNo. If the irregularity concerns goods and/or services or classification, the applicant's response must be submitted through the USPTO, preferably one month before the due date.\n\nMay an international application be amended through the USPTO?\n\nNo. Once an international application is submitted to the USPTO, it cannot be amended, changed, or corrected in any way. The applicant must contact the IB with any questions of concerns.\n\nCan I bring in my trademark application to your office?\n\nYes. You can hand deliver your application between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays within the District of Columbia, to the following location:\n\nTrademark Assistance Center\n\nJames Madison Building - East Wing\n\nConcourse Level\n\n600 Dulany Street\n\nAlexandria, VA\n\nGeneral - Trademark Help - Getting Started - Other\n\nWhere can I get basic trademark information?\n\nFor information about applying for a trademark, read our Trademarks basics pages that cover important topics and critical application filing tips. To understand what to expect in the overall process, view the timelines for trademark processing. If you still have questions, contact the Trademark Assistance Center at 1-800-786-9199 (press 1).\n\nHow do I do a federal trademark search?\n\nYou may conduct a search free of charge on the USPTO Web site using the trademark search system. You may also conduct a trademark search by visiting the Trademark Public Search Library, between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. at the Public Search Facility, Madison East, 1st Floor, 600 Dulany Street, Alexandria, VA 22313. Use of the Public Search Library is free to the public. You may check on the status of an application or registration through the Trademark Applications and Registrations Retrieval (TARR) database. If you do not have access to the Internet, you can call the Trademark Assistance Center at 1-800-786-9199 (press 1) or 1-571-272-9250 to check the status.\n\nIs a federal registration valid outside of the United States?\n\nNo. However, certain countries recognize a United States registration as a basis for filing an application to register a mark in those countries under international treaties. See TMEP Chapter 1000 and TMEP Chapter 1900 for further information.\n\nMay a minor file a trademark application?\n\nThe question of whether an application may be filed in the name of a minor depends on your state's law. If the minor may validly enter into binding legal obligations, and may sue or be sued, in the state in which they are domiciled, the application may be filed in the name of the minor. Otherwise, the application must be filed in the name of a parent or legal guardian, clearly setting forth their status as a parent or legal guardian. An example of the manner in which the applicant should be identified in such cases is: \"John Smith, United States citizen, (parent/legal guardian) of Mary Smith.\"\n\nWhat do I need to include in my trademark application?\n\nA completed application form submitted in hard copy or electronically as noted above.\n\nThe appropriate fee.\n\nA drawing of the mark to be registered - this is true even if the mark is just an unstylized word.\n\nSpecimens of use of the mark if the application is based on actual use in commerce.\n\nPaper applications and any accompanying communications or material should be addressed to:\n\nCommissioner for Trademarks\n\nP.O. Box 1451\n\nAlexandria, Virginia 22313-1451\n\nWhat is a drawing?\n\nThe \"drawing\" is a clear image of the mark applicant seeks to register. The USPTO uses the drawing to upload the mark into the USPTO search database and to print the mark in the Official Gazette and on the registration certificate. There are two types of drawings: \"standard character\" and \"special form.\" For more information on the different types of drawings see our page on mark drawings.\n\nWhat is a certification mark?\n\nA certification mark is any word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination thereof owned by one party who certifies the goods and services of others when they meet certain standards. The owner of the mark exercises control over the use of the mark; however, because the sole purpose of a certification mark is to indicate that certain standards have been met, use of the mark is by others. See the certification mark application page for more information.\n\nDoes the USPTO determine trademark infringement?\n\nThe USPTO examines trademark applications to determine if there is likelihood of confusion between the mark in the application and a previously registered trademark or another mark in a prior-pending application. If no conflict is found and all other statutory requirements are met, the examining attorney can approve the mark for publication. The USPTO has no powers of enforcement concerning the use of trademarks in the marketplace.\n\nSome contents linked to on this page require a plug-in for PDF file.\n\nHow can I view my documents if I cannot use TSDR?\n\nYou can access a copy of your documents by using the TDR Application Programming Interface (API), which relies on specific URLs rather than the TSDR interface presented through the USPTO website. You should follow these examples:\n\nTo access all documents for Serial Number 72131351 as a PDF, enter the following in your search box:http://tdrapi.uspto.gov/ts/cd/casedocs/bundle.pdf?sn=72131351\n\nTo access all documents for Registration Number 3,500,030 as a PDF, enter the following in your search box:http://tdrapi.uspto.gov/ts/cd/casedocs/bundle.pdf?rn=3500030\n\nTo access all documents for Reference Number Z1231384 as a PDF, enter the following in your search box:http://tdrapi.uspto.gov/ts/cd/casedocs/bundle.pdf?ref=Z1231384\n\nMy spouse owned a trademark registration and has since died. Do I own it now?\n\nPerhaps. Because this depends on state law, the USPTO cannot provide a definite answer for all factual situations. You should consider contacting an attorney. Local bar associations and phone directories usually have attorney listings. Click here for further information.\n\nWhat are \"common law\" rights?\n\nFederal registration is not required to establish rights in a trademark. Common law rights arise from actual use of a mark and may allow the common law user to successfully challenge a registration or application.\n\nWhat is \"interstate commerce\"?\n\nFor goods, \"interstate commerce\" generally involves sending the goods across state lines with the mark displayed on the goods or the packaging for the goods. With services, \"interstate commerce\" generally involves rendering a service to customers in another state or rendering a service that affects interstate commerce (e.g., restaurants, gas stations, hotels).\n\nWill my information be public?\n\nAll data you submit to the USPTO, including your phone number, e-mail address, and street address, but not your credit card and banking information, is public record and is viewable on the Internet. Do not submit personal identifying information that is NOT required for a filing, such as a social security number or driver's license number.\n\nFor more information, please consult the FAQs Personal Information in Trademark Records.\n\nWhere should I place the ยฎ symbol?\n\nThere are no specific requirements on where the \"ยฎ\" symbol should be placed relative to the mark, but most businesses use the symbol in the upper right corner of the mark. The \"ยฎ\" symbol indicates that you have federally registered your trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. It puts the public on notice that your mark is registered and that you have nationwide rights in it. You may only use the registration symbol with the mark on or in connection with the goods/services listed in the federal trademark registration and while the registration is still alive (you may not continue to use it if you don't maintain the registration or it expires). Note: Because several foreign countries use \"ยฎ\" to indicate that a mark is registered in that country, use of the symbol by the holder of a foreign registration may be proper.\n\nAre there any restrictions on use of the \"ยฎ\" symbol?\n\nThere are three important restrictions on use of the \"ยฎ\" symbol: (1) it may only be used after the mark is registered (you may not use it during the application process); (2) it may only be used on or in connection with the goods and services listed in the federal registration; and (3) it may only be used while the registration is still alive (you may not continue to use it if you don't maintain the registration or it expires). Note: Because several foreign countries use \"ยฎ\" to indicate that a mark is registered in that country, use of the symbol by the holder of a foreign registration may be proper.\n\nWhat if someone else is using my registered mark on related goods and services?\n\nYou may challenge use of your trademark by someone else in several ways, depending on the factual situation. You should consider contacting an attorney specializing in trademark law. Local bar associations and phone directories usually have attorney listings broken down by specialties. Time can be of the essence. Click here for further information.\n\nHow do I file a Statement of Use or Extension Request after the Notice of Allowance is issued?\n\nThe Applicant has six (6) months from the mailing date of the notice of allowance to file either a Statement of Use or an Extension Request.\n\nIf the applicant is using the mark in commerce on all of the goods/services listed in the notice of allowance, the applicant must submit a statement of use form, specimen and the required fee(s) within 6 months from the issue date the notice of allowance to avoid abandonment. Applicant cannot withdraw the statement of use; however, the applicant may file one extension request with the statement of use to provide more time to overcome deficiencies in the statement of use. No further extension requests may be filed.\n\nIf the applicant is not using the mark in commerce on all of the goods/services listed in the notice of allowance, the applicant must file an extension request form and the required fee(s) to avoid abandonment. The applicant must continue to file extension requests every 6 months calculated from the issue date of the notice of allowance until the statement of use is filed. A total of 5 extension requests may be filed.\n\nIf I filed based on an \"intent to use\" the mark, when must I allege actual use of the mark in commerce?\n\nYou must file your Allegation of Use either prior to the date the application is approved for publication or within six months after the Notice of Allowance is issued, unless a request for an extension of time is granted.\n\nMay I assign or transfer the ownership of my trademark to someone else?\n\nYes. A registered mark may be assigned and a mark for which an application to register has been filed may be assignable. Certain exceptions exist concerning the assignment of Intent-to-Use applications. Assignments may be recorded in the USPTO for a fee. For the guidelines for filing an assignment and the assignment form itself, click on Assignments or contact the Assignment Recordation Branch at 571-272-3350.\n\nHow can I check the status of my application?\n\nOnce you receive a serial number for your application, you can check the status of your application through the Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (TSDR) system. If you do not have access to the Internet, you can call the Trademark Assistance Center at 1-800-786-9199 to request a status check. You should check on the status of your pending application every 3-4 months. If the USPTO has taken any action, you may need to respond promptly. All USPTO actions are available for viewing using TSDR.\n\nHow long will it take for my mark to register?\n\nThe total time for an application to be processed may be anywhere from almost a year to several years, depending on the basis for filing and the legal issues that may arise in the examination of the application. You may view the application processing timelines here.\n\nWhat is the difference between \"use in commerce\" and \"intent to use\" in commerce?\n\nThe basic difference between these two filing bases is whether you have used the mark on all the goods/services. If you have already used your mark in commerce, you may file under the \"use in commerce\" basis. If you have not yet used your mark in commerce, but intend to use it in the future, you must file under the \"intent to use\" basis. An \"intent to use\" basis will require filing an additional form and fee that are unnecessary if you file under \"use in commerce.\"\n\nWhat is a specimen?\n\nA specimen is a sample of how you actually use the mark in commerce on your goods or with your services. A specimen shows the mark as your purchasers encounter it in the marketplace (e.g., on your labels or on your website).\n\nCan you register the name of a musical group or band?\n\nA band name may function as a service mark for \"entertainment services in the nature of performances by a musical group\" if it is used to identify live performances.\n\nWho may file an application?\n\nOnly the owner of the trademark may file an application for registration. The owner controls the use of the mark, and controls the nature and quality of the goods to which it is affixed, or the services for which it is used. The owner may be an individual, corporation, partnership, LLC, or other type of legal entity.\n\nMust I be a U.S. citizen to obtain a federal registration?\n\nNo. However, your citizenship must be provided in the application. If you have dual citizenship, then you must indicate which citizenship will be printed on the certificate of registration.\n\nWhere can I conduct a trademark search for trademarks in pending applications and federal registrations?\n\nYou may search the USPTO's Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) database free of charge before filing or you may wish to hire an attorney to perform the search and assess the results for you. Alternatively, you can search the database at a Patent and Trademark Resource Center (PTRC). Information about PTRC locations can be found here.\n\nDo federal regulations govern the use of the designations \"TM\" or \"SM\" or the ยฎ symbol?\n\nIf you claim rights to use a mark, you may use the \"TM\" (trademark) or \"SM\" (service mark) designation to alert the public to your claim of a \"common-law\" mark. No registration is necessary to use a \"TM\" or \"SM\" symbol and you may continue to use these symbols even if the USPTO refuses to register your mark. Those symbols put people on notice that you claim rights in the mark, although common law doesn't give you all the rights and benefits of federal registration.\n\nYou may only use the federal registration symbol \"ยฎ\" after the USPTO actually registers a mark, not while an application is pending. And it may only be used on or in connection with the goods/services listed in the federal trademark registration and while the registration is still alive (you may not continue to use it if you don't maintain the registration or it expires). Although there are no specific requirements on where the symbol should be placed relative to the mark, most businesses use the symbol in the upper right corner of the mark. Note: Because several foreign countries use \"ยฎ\" to indicate that a mark is registered in that country, use of the symbol by the holder of a foreign registration may be proper.\n\nIs registration guaranteed and can I get a refund of money paid?\n\nRegistration is not guaranteed and only money paid when not required may be refunded. For information on why registration may be refused, see Basic Facts About Trademarks.\n\nShould I conduct a search for similar trademarks before filing an application?\n\nIt is advisable to conduct a search before filing your application. See TESS TIPS for further information.\n\nWhat is a collective mark?\n\nA collective mark is any word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination thereof owned by a cooperative, an association, or other collective group or organization and used by its members to indicate the source of the goods or services.\n\nMust I register my trademark?\n\nNo. You can establish rights in a mark based on use of the mark in commerce, without a registration. However, owning a federal trademark registration on the Principal Register provides several important benefits.\n\nWhat is a service mark?\n\nA service mark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination thereof, that identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods. The term \"trademark\" is often used to refer to both trademarks and service marks.\n\nWhat is a copyright?\n\nA copyright is a form of protection provided to the authors of \"original works of authorship\" including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works, both published and unpublished. The 1976 Copyright Act generally gives the owner of copyright the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work, to perform the copyrighted work publicly, or to display the copyrighted work publicly.\n\nA copyright protects the form of expression rather than the subject matter of the writing. For example, a description of a machine could be copyrighted, but this would only prevent others from copying the description; it would not prevant others from writing a description of their own or from making and using the machine. Copyrights are registered by the Library of Congress' Copyright Office.\n\nThere are times when you may desire a combination of copyright, patent, and trademark protection for your work. You should consult an attorney to determine what forms of intellectual property protection are best suited to your needs.\n\nWhat is a collective membership mark?\n\nA collective membership mark is any word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination thereof which indicates that the user of the mark is a member of a particular organization. The owner of the mark exercises control over the use of the mark; however, because the sole purpose of a membership mark is to indicate membership, use of the mark is by members.\n\nOther - Getting Started\n\nCan I register my trademark to use on regulated products (e.g. cannabis) and activities (e.g. gambling)?\n\nApplications for trademarks used on regulated products (e.g. cannabis, drug paraphernalia, ivory, whalebone) and activities (e.g. gambling and wagering, retail stores featuring controlled substances) are subject to additional review. See more information on our Laws and regulations page.\n\nTrademark Help - Madrid Protocol - Basics\n\nWhat happens if an applicant fails to include all of the intended designated countries?\n\nThe applicant should immediately send a request to withdraw the international application to the Madrid Processing Unit (MPU) mailbox at mpu@uspto.gov. However, if the international application has already been assigned to a MPU Trademark Specialist for certification or automatically certified electronically, it may be too late.\n\nWhat other electronic Madrid Protocol forms are available?\n\nThe USPTO offers several stand-alone forms:\n\nApplication for International Registration\n\nSubsequent Designation of an International Registration - to extend protection of goods/services to additional countries or extend protection of additional goods/services to previously designated countries\n\nResponse to a Notice of Irregularity\n\nTEAS global form options for:\n\nReplacement Request - request for the USPTO to note the replacement of a U.S. national registration with a registered extension of protection\n\nTransformation Request - to request transformation of a cancelled international registration into a US national application\n\nDeclaration of Use or Excusable Nonuse under Section 71\n\nCombined Declaration of Use & Incontestability under Sections 71 and 15\n\nPetition to the Director to Review denial of certification of International Application\n\nCan a subsequent designation be submitted through the USPTO for forwarding to the International Bureau?\n\nYes. If the holder of an international registration is a national of, has a domicile in, or has a real and effective business or commercial establishment in the United States and the international registration is based on a U.S. application or registration, then the subsequent designation may be submitted to the USPTO using the electronic form provided through the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) with a USPTO transmittal fee of $100. The holder also has the option of filing a subsequent designation directly with the International Bureau.\n\nTrademark Help - Madrid Protocol - International Application\n\nHow can a U.S. trademark owner file an international application with the USPTO?\n\nGenerally, an international application must be filed electronically using the Trademark Electronic Application System for International Applications (TEASi).\n\nWhat happens after the International Bureau registers the mark in the international application?\n\nOnce the International Bureau registers the mark, the International Bureau will notify each Contracting Party designated in the international registration of the request for an extension of protection to that country. Each designated Contracting Party will then examine the request for an extension of protection the same as it would a national application under its laws. If the application meets the requirements for registration of that country, then the Contracting Party will grant protection of the mark in its country.\n\nThere are strict time limits for refusing to grant an extension of protection (a maximum of 18 months). If a Contracting Party does not notify the International Bureau of any refusal of an extension of protection within the time limits set forth in Article 5(2) of the Madrid Protocol, the holder of the international registration is automatically granted protection of its mark in that country.\n\nMay an applicant limit the goods and/or services in an international registration?\n\nYes. An applicant may either limit the goods and/or services at the time of filing the international application in the appropriate section of the form or limit them later with the International Bureau (IB) by submitting the required Form MM6 available at www.wipo.int/madrid/en/forms.\n\nMay an applicant file an appointment of representative for their international application through the USPTO?\n\nNo. An applicant must file the appointment directly with the IB on Form MM12.\n\nIf an international application is denied certification by the USPTO, may an applicant resubmit or reuse the USPTO Reference Number assigned to the denied international application when a new international application is filed?\n\nNo. Applicant may not resubmit an international application using the same USPTO Reference Number. A new international application will receive a new USPTO Reference Number.\n\nWhat happens after the international application has been submitted to the USPTO?\n\nIf the international application meets the requirements of 37 C.F.R. ยง7.11(a), then the USPTO will certify that certain information in the international application is the same as the information in the U.S. basic application or registration and forward the international application to the International Bureau.\n\nIf the international application does not meet the requirements of 37 C.F.R. ยง7.11(a), then the USPTO will not certify the international application. The USPTO will notify the international applicant of the reasons why the international application cannot be certified. The certification fee is not refundable. The international applicant may promptly resubmit a corrected international application based on the same U.S. application or registration. The certification fees must be included with the new submission. Alternatively, the international applicant can file a petition to the Director to review the denial of certification. Timeliness of petitions is paramount as the international registration date may be affected if the petition is filed too late after issuance of the denial of certification.\n\nHow does one know if a petition to the Director to review the denial of certification of an international application has been filed by an applicant and processed by the USPTO?\n\nBy using the USPTO Reference Number assigned to an international application, information concerning an international application may be obtained in Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (TSDR) under the section titled \"Madrid History\" on the \"Status\" tab. Use the \"Documents\" tab of TSDR to view the actual petition that was filed and the processing documentation issued by the USPTO in granting or denying the petition.\n\nTrademark Help - Maintaining a Trademark - Section 71\n\nMust I file any other maintenance documents in addition to ยง71 Declarations?\n\nYes, the holder of a registered extension of protection of an international registration to the U.S. must file an application for renewal of the international registration with the International Bureau (IB). 37 C.F.R. ยง7.41(a). Renewal of international registrations is governed by Article 7 of the Madrid Protocol and Rules 29 - 31 of the Common Regulations under the Madrid Agreement and Protocol.\n\nWhen must I file a ยง71 Declaration?\n\nThe owner of the registration must file a ยง71 Declaration during the following time periods:\n\nFirst Filing Deadline: File a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) on or after the fifth anniversary and no later than the sixth anniversary after the date of registration in the United States, or in the six-month grace period immediately following, with payment of the grace period surcharge.\n\nSubsequent Filing Deadline: File a Declaration of Use (or Excusable Nonuse) within the year preceding the end of each ten-year period after the date of registration in the U.S., or in the six-month grace period immediately following, with payment of the grace period surcharge.\n\nIs there a form for filing a ยง71 Declaration?\n\nYes. USPTO electronic forms for filing a ยง71 Declaration are available online at the USPTO website through Form #9 in the Registration Maintenance/Renewal Forms.\n\n>> File ยง71\n\nWhat is a ยง71 Declaration of Continued Use?\n\nHolders (owners) of registered extensions of protection to the U.S. (also called ยง66(a) registrations, registrations resulting from 79' series applications, international registrations extended to the U.S.) who wish to maintain the protection granted their mark in the U.S. pursuant to the Madrid Protocol must file an affidavit or declaration of use in commerce or excusable nonuse to avoid cancellation of protection in U.S. Such affidavits are required pursuant to Section 71, 15 U.S.C. ยง1141k, of the Trademark Act. The USPTO has no authority to waive or extend the deadline for filing a proper ยง71 Declaration. Registrations cancelled due to the failure to file a ยง71 Declaration cannot be reinstated or \"revived.\" A new application to pursue registration of the mark again must be filed.\n\nWhere can I file additional information on maintenance requirements?\n\nPlease review the additional information on Madrid Protocol Maintenance Requirements.\n\nHow do I renew my registered extension of protection?\n\nRequests for renewal of an international registration must be filed directly with the International Bureau (IB). 37 C.F.R. ยง7.41(a) A renewal can be filed during the six months before expiry of the period of protection or in the six months following the expiry of the current period of protection with the payment of a surcharge.\n\nThe term of an international registration is ten years, and it may be renewed for ten years upon payment of the renewal fee. Articles 6(1) and 7(1).

The ยง15 Declaration must be executed and filed within one year following a 5-year period of continuous use of the mark in commerce.\n\nAm I required to file a ยง15 Declaration?\n\nNo. The filing of a ยง15 Declaration is optional. An owner may choose to claim the benefits of incontestability by filing a ยง15 Declaration or may elect to retain the registration without those benefits. The term of the registration, for purpose of renewal, is not affected in either event.\n\nTrademark Help - Maintaining a Trademark - Sections 8 & 9\n\nIs there a fee for filing an application for renewal?\n\nYes. The fee for filing a ยง9 Renewal electronically using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) is $300 per class of goods/services.

To retrieve the records relating to your trademark, enter your application serial number or registration number and click the โDocumentsโ button. You can find your application serial number and your registration number on your registration certificate.\n\nHow do I renew my trademark registration?\n\nTo renew a federal trademark registration, you must file an Application for Renewal under ยง9 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง1059 in conjunction with a ยง8 Declaration. See the answer below.\n\nDoes my registration ever expire?\n\nYes. Subject to the filing of ยง8 Declarations and ยง9 Applications for Renewal, federal trademark registrations issued on or after November 16, 1989, remain in force for 10 years, and may be renewed for 10-year periods.

Section 8 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง1058. If the owner is claiming excusable nonuse of the mark, a ยง8 Declaration of Excusable Nonuse may be filed. The purpose of the ยง8 Declaration is to remove marks no longer in use from the register.\n\nIs there a form for filing a ยง8 Declaration?\n\nYes. USPTO electronic forms for filing a ยง8 Declaration and a combined 10-year ยง8 Declaration and ยง9 Renewal Application are available online at the USPTO website.\n\n>> File ยง8 โ\n\nWhere can I learn more about Excusable Nonuse?\n\nThe Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (TMEP) is available online at the USPTO website. This resource contains an explanation of excusable nonuse and examples of circumstances under which a claim of excusable nonuse has been accepted. See TMEP ยง1604.11.\n\nIn general, nonuse must be temporary, and the owner must clearly demonstrate how the circumstances prevent use of the mark in commerce and what efforts are being made to resume use. Please note that nonuse due to the decreased demand for a product does not by itself constitute \"excusable nonuse.\"\n\nWhat is a Declaration of Excusable Nonuse?\n\nA ยง8 Declaration of Excusable Nonuse is a sworn statement, filed by the owner of a registration, that the mark is not in use in commerce due to special circumstances that excuse such nonuse and is not due to any intention to abandon the mark. Section 8 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. 1058.\n\nIf my ยง8 Declaration of Excusable Nonuse is accepted, do I have to file another ยง8 Declaration when I resume using the mark?\n\nNo. Once the USPTO accepts the ยง8 Declaration of Excusable Nonuse, the owner of the registration is not required to file another ยง8 Declaration until the next statutory filing period.\n\nTrademark Help - Maintaining a Trademark - Basics\n\nWhat are the process steps and time frames for maintaining trademark registrations?\n\nView the Post Registration Timeline for all Registrations except Madrid Protocol-Based Registrations for an overview of the process steps and time frames for maintaining a trademark registration. After a registration issues, to keep the registration \"alive\" or valid, the registration owner must file specific documents and pay fees at regular intervals. Failure to file these documents will result in the cancellation of your registration.\n\nView the Post-Registration Timeline for Madrid Protocol-Based Registration for an overview of the process steps and time frames for maintaining a Madrid Protocol-based registration. After protection is granted to the international registration and a U.S. registration issues, to keep protection in the U.S., the U.S. registration owner must file specific documents and pay fees at regular intervals. Failure to file these documents will result in the cancellation of your U.S. registration and the invalidation of protection of the international registration by the USPTO.\n\nTrademark Help - Native American Tribal Insignia - Basics - Technical Information - Native American Tribal Insignia Database - Basics\n\nWhat is the Native American tribal insignia database?\n\nThe Native American tribal insignia database is a public collection database that is a component of the trademark search system, a larger database maintained by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This database records the official tribal insignia of federally or state-recognized Native American tribes, and we use it to help us examine applications for trademark registration. As part of the examination process, we determine whether trademarks may falsely suggest a connection to the tribal insignias of participating Native American tribes. See our Native American tribal insignia webpage for more information.\n\nHow can a federally or state-recognized Native American tribe request for its official tribal insignia to be included in the database?\n\nA federally or state-recognized Native American tribe may submit its official tribal insignia to the database by submitting a written request in compliance with the guidelines listed on the Native American tribal insignia webpage. You can submit your request electronically, by mail, by fax, or by hand delivery. We invite tribes to submit more than one tribal insignia. Please submit only one per request.\n\nWhen the USPTO enters a tribal insignia in the database, does it first make an official determination that the tribal insignia is the official tribal insignia of the Native American tribe that made the submission?\n\nNo. We do not investigate whether the tribal insignia is the official tribal insignia of the tribe that made the submission. We comply with every proper request to include tribal insignia in the database. See our Native American tribal insignia webpage for more information.\n\nTEASi\n\nWhen is TEASi available?\n\nWe make every effort to have TEASi available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, the site is sometimes down for scheduled maintenance, for which the USPTO generally posts advance notice. We recommend that you check the current server status and planned outages page before beginning the filing process. Sometimes the site is also down unexpectedly. Although we try to restore service as soon as possible, this does not always happen as quickly as we would hope. Because of the possibility of an unforeseen problem (such as site downtime or Internet connectivity issues), we do encourage you to plan ahead when filing papers electronically and not wait until the last minute to file time-sensitive papers with the USPTO.\n\nAll forms filed via TEASi are time/date stamped when received on the USPTO server, according to Eastern Standard Time (EST) and EST controls for purposes of determining the timeliness of a document. Any submission that arrives as of 11:59 p.m. EST will be given that day's filing date (i.e., regardless of the USPTO's \"normal\" business hours).\n\nIf your deadline is today and the document cannot be filed via TEASi due to an outage, you must use an alternative method of filing to ensure that the document is timely received in the USPTO. A deadline that falls on a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday within the District of Columbia extends the due date to the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday. 37 C.F.R. ยง2.196. See TMEP ยง308.\n\nTrademark Help - TEASi - Priority Claim Information\n\nWhat are the goods and/or services listed in an earlier filing, for which priority is claimed?\n\nIf the country of earlier filing is the United States, click the \"Retrieve GS\" button to populate Class and goods/services data automatically. Otherwise, you must use the pull-down box to enter the number of classes you wish to add, and then click on the \"Add Classes\" button.\n\nWhat are the dates of earlier filing?\n\nEnter the filing date of the application that is the basis for the priority claim. NOTE: In accordance with Article 4(c)(3) of the Paris Convention, where the last day of the six-month period from the claimed priority date is a day when the Office of origin is not open for the receipt of requests to present international applications, the six-month period will, where the international registration bears the date of the receipt by the Office of origin of the said request, be extended until the first following working day at the Office of origin; similarly, where the international registration bears the date of the receipt of the international application by the International Bureau (IB), or a subsequent date, and the last day of the six-month period is a day when the IB is not open to the public, the six-month period will be extended until the first following working day at the IB.\n\nWhat is a priority claim?\n\nAn international applicant may assert a priority claim for a trademark application filed in another country, prior to the filing of the international application. If recognized by the International Bureau (IB), this claim may result in an international registration date that is earlier than the date of filing of the international application.\n\nWhat happens when the last day of the six-month period from the claimed priority date is a date when the Office of origin is not open?\n\nIn accordance with Article 4(c)(3) of the Paris Convention, where the last day of the six-month period from the claimed priority date is a day when the Office of origin is not open for the receipt of requests to present international applications, the six-month period will, where the international registration bears the date of the receipt by the Office of origin of the said request, be extended until the first following working day at the Office of origin; similarly, where the international registration bears the date of the receipt of the international application by the International Bureau (IB), or a subsequent date, and the last day of the six-month period is a day when the IB is not open to the public, the six-month period will be extended until the first following working day at the IB.\n\nTrademark Help - TEASi - International Application FAQ's\n\nHow do I open an account at WIPOโs International Bureau?\n\nTo open a current account for the settlement of fees at WIPO's International Bureau (IB), you must file a signed request for the opening of the account, together with the payment of an initial deposit. The current accounts will be kept only in Swiss francs at the headquarters of WIPO in Geneva. An initial deposit of at least 5,000 Swiss francs (CHF) is recommended. For further information on establishing an account at WIPO, review the Current Account at WIPO's International Bureau page.\n\nWhat are the filing requirements for an international application?\n\nUnder 37 C.F.R. ยง7.11(a), the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will grant a date of receipt to an international application that is submitted through the Trademark Electronic Application System International (TEASi) and contains all of the following:\n\n1. The filing date and serial number of the U.S. basic application and/or the registration date and registration number of the U.S. basic registration;\n\n2. The name of the international applicant that is identical to the name of the applicant or registrant as it appears in the basic application or basic registration and applicant's current address;\n\n3. A statement that the applicant is entitled to file an international application in the USPTO, specifying that applicant:\n\n(i) is a national of the United States;\n\n(ii) has a domicile in the United States; or\n\n(iii) has a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the United States. Where an applicant's address is not in the United States, the applicant must provide the address of its U.S. domicile or establishment.\n\n4. An e-mail address for receipt of correspondence from the USPTO.\n\n5. A reproduction of the mark that is the same as the mark in the basic application and/or registration.\n\n6.

A list of the goods and/or services that is identical to or narrower than the list of goods and/or services in each claimed basic application or registration and classified according to the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks; and\n\n10. Fees in the nature of: (1) the USPTO certification fee, (2) the international application fees for all classes, and (3) the fees for all designated Contracting Parties identified in the international application.\n\nWill TEASi form work on mobile devices?\n\nYes, TEASi form works on all iOS, Android and Windows mobile devices.\n\nWhat is the difference between the pre-populated form and the free-text form?\n\nPre-Populated Form: The pre-populated form will automatically display the exact information that is already in the USPTO database for one specific serial number of a U.S. basic application or a U.S. basic registration number. If you do not change any data fields, the USPTO will directly submit information that must be certified to WIPO's International Bureau (IB), without independent review of this data at the USPTO. Alternatively, this form may be used where certain data fields can be changed (e.g., either narrowing the scope of the identification of goods and/or services in the U.S. basic application or registration, and/or substituting a color drawing of the mark, where the original mark is shown in the USPTO database as a black-and-white image); however, if any data field is changed, an independent review of this data will occur by the USPTO's Madrid Processing Unit before the form will be forwarded to the IB.\n\nFree-Text Form: The free-text form must be used if: (1) the application for international registration is being based on more than one serial number of a U.S. basic application or a U.S. basic registration number; (2) data is being changed in any way other than only narrowing the scope of the identification of goods and/or services in the U.S. basic application or registration and/or substituting a color drawing of the mark, where the original mark is shown in the USPTO database as a black-and-white image; or (3) the U.S. basic application being used as the basis is not yet loaded into the Office's database at the time of filing, e.g., immediately after a U.S. application was filed. Information on this form is not automatically certified, and will not be submitted directly to the IB. Instead, the form will be routed to the USPTO's Madrid Processing Unit for review. If all elements required for certification are supplied, the form will then be forwarded to the IB.\n\nTrademark Help - TEASi - Fees\n\nWhat is the IB Account Number?\n\nThe number of a current account that has been opened with the International Bureau (IB).\n\nWhat fees are associated with filing an International application for Registration?\n\nIn addition to the USPTO certification fees, there are fees that must be paid to WIPO. These WIPO fees payable in connection with the filing of an international application consist of: (1) the basic fee (WIPO's fee for processing the international application) and (2) either the complimentary fee(s) or the individual fee(s), depending on the Contracting Parties designated. An additional fee is required for the submission of any color image. The calculation can be determined from the WIPO fee calculator. The total is reflected in U.S. dollars, as converted from Swiss francs. See WIPO's website at http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/fees/ for more details.\n\nHow is the USPTO certification fee calculated?\n\nUSPTO Certification Fee: If the international application is based on one basic application or one basic registration, the fee is $100 per class based on the total number of classes in the international application. Each class only counts once, even if that class is claimed multiple times for different Contracting Party countries within the international application. The fee is $150 per class, rather than $100 per class, when the international application is based on more than one U.S. basic application or registration. These fees are for filing the international application electronically. If the international application is filed on paper, the fees will be higher.\n\nWhat is the Exchange Rate?\n\nThis is the rate being used to convert Swiss francs into U.S. dollars. This rate is obtained daily and populates the form to determine the amount due at the time of filing.\n\nWhat is the payment reference number?\n\nFor a payment already submitted and acknowledged by WIPO, the specific payment reference number assigned to the submission.\n\nWhat is the account holder?\n\nThe full name of the holder of the current account that has been opened with the International Bureau (IB).\n\nWhat is the WIPO receipt number?\n\nThe number assigned by WIPO to confirm receipt of payment.\n\nTrademark Help - TEASi - Mark Section\n\nWhat kind of characters can I use in my standard character mark?\n\nFor entry of a mark at Option #1 in the Free-Text form, the entered character(s) must appear in the USPTO accepted standard character set. From the entry made, the USPTO will create a JPG image file of the mark, required for proper processing.\n\nIf using the Pre-Populated form, the mark is automatically populated into the form and cannot be changed.\n\nWhen attaching my drawing image what is the proper size of the JPG/JPEG file? All black-and-white jpg images and color jpg images must be scanned at no less than 300 dots per inch and no more than 350 dots per inch, and with a length and width of no less than 250 pixels and no more than 944 pixels, e.g., a valid pixel dimension is 640 X 480 pixels. To ensure your image file meets these requirements, you can use a free graphic viewer, e.g., Irfanview. If you cut-and-paste an image into Irfanview, or open an image file using the program, select \"Image\" from the tool bar and \"Information\" from the drop-down choices to view the current DPI and pixel dimensions. If your image is not in the proper dimension, you can use Irfanview to change the DPI and pixel dimensions: 1) Select \"Image\" from the tool bar; 2) Select \"Resize\" from the drop-down choices; 3) Set the DPI to 300 - 350 and change the pixel dimension to within the accepted range of 250 X 944; 4) If the new image file looks acceptable to you in the new dimensions, save the image file, by selecting \"File\" from the tool bar and using the \"Save As\" feature to save the file as a JPG image. If the image is not clear, do not submit the image. Instead, seek the assistance of a graphic artist to create the properly-sized jpg file.\n\nCan an application for International Registration contain fewer classes than what is listed in the basic application/registration?\n\nYes. The application for international registration can be limited to only those classes for which you want the international registration to cover. E.g., the basic application may contain 4 total classes but all designated Contracting Parties may be limited to only 3 of those classes.\n\nWhen is a description "
