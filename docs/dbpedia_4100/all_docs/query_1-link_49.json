        "text": "More than 11,000 individuals living with cancer in the United States and Canada have partnered with Count Me In to share their experiences and help accelerate cancer research.\n\nThe Drug Repurposing Hub is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date biologically annotated collections of FDA-approved compounds in the world. Researchers anywhere can explore more than 6,000 drugs in the hub and search for possible new uses for them to jump-start new drug discovery.\n\nIn 2021, our sustainability efforts sent more than 80 percent of waste from the Genomics Platform to either a recycling facility or to an incineration plant that generates electricity.\n\nThrough Broad's Scientists in the Classroom program, Broad researchers visit every 8th grade classroom in Cambridge each year to talk about genetics and evolution.\n\nEvery summer, 18 high school students spend six weeks at Broad working side-by-side with mentors on cutting-edge research.\n\nIn November 2022, Broad’s Genomics Platform sequenced its 500,000th whole human genome, a mere four years after sequencing its 100,000th.\n\nBy the end of 2022, Broad’s COVID-19 testing lab had processed more than 37 million tests.\n\nWorking with Addgene, Broad Institute has shared CRISPR genome-editing reagents with researchers at more than 3,200 institutions in 76 countries.\n\nThe NeuroGAP-Psychosis project, a collaboration between the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to study the genetics of severe mental illness, has recruited more than 42,000 participants in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa."
