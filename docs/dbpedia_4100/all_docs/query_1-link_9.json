With a physics degree from Rollins College and a PhD in Ocean Engineering from the University of Rhode Island, she is making waves in underwater acoustics. Jade's passion for the ocean ignited during childhood beach days in Florida. This fascination fueled a #STEM-focused path, leading to a career dedicated to understanding and harnessing the ocean's potential. Her research delves into the complexities of acoustic propagation, exploring how factors like temperature, sea state, and seabed composition impact sonar performance. By unraveling these underwater mysteries, Jade is directly contributing to the Navy's mission. Her work in geoacoustic inversion is crucial for creating accurate models of the ocean floor, improving sonar detection and range accuracy. Ultimately, this leads to better-informed tactical decisions for our naval forces. As a #NREIP intern, Jade has embraced every opportunity to learn and grow. From collaborating with seasoned researchers to attending informative talks, she has immersed herself in the NRL community. \"The best part about working at NRL is the sense of fulfillment that comes from being present in a collaborative environment,\" said Jade. \"Each branch is filled with individuals that have expertise in different research areas, yet they often come together to exchange ideas and help each other out.\" We're excited to see where Jade will go next! Her dedication and talent are an inspiration to future oceanographers and scientists. üåü üåä US Navy United States Department of Defense United States Marine Corps Rollins College University of Rhode Island #NRLintern #oceanography #acoustics #STEM #research #futureleaders #navalSTEM #education #leader #DODintern #science #futuretech #NRL #NRLresearch #collaboration #revolutionize #STEMIntern #DODEducation\n\nMaking Waves for Marines: NRL's LittoralLens Showcased at Expo! üåä The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Office of Naval Research-Global (ONR-Global) TechSolutions unveiled the game-changing LittoralLens system at the Modern Day Marine Expo!
