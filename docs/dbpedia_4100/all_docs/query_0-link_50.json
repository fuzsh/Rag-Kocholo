In March, DOE submitted a Planned Change Request to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeking permission to mine and operate two underground disposal panels in the WIPP underground disposal facility. EPA wants to hear from you and is hosting public meetings in Carlsbad and Santa Fe the week of August 26th. https://www.epa.gov/radiation/wipp-news#WIPP-PCR\n\nEPA has one of two ways to decide whether to grant permission. One is through an internal administrative process. The second is through a legal rulemaking that allows the public to present legal challenges to the decision. A full rulemaking and a comprehensive review of the risks from DOE’s proposed changes is the only way to ensure nuclear safety.\n\nFurther, DOE wants to significantly expand the WIPP underground with Panels 11 and 12 and eventually mine seven additional panels – Panels 13 through 19 – to bring new types of waste to WIPP, including surplus plutonium. As a result EPA requested additional scientific data and information about how seven new panels and new types of waste would affect WIPP’s ability to contain the waste for 10,000 years.\n\nTo help you prepare public comments, the Stop Forever WIPP Coalition is hosting a virtual educational webinar on Wednesday, August 21st from 6 to 8 pm. Don Hancock, the Director of the Southwest Research and Information Center Nuclear Waste Program http://sric.org/ , and Doug Meiklejohn, the Water Quality and Land Restoration Advocate at Conservation Voters of New Mexico https://cvnm.org/ , will present about the DOE Planned Change Request, EPA’s decision making process, and how you can help stop WIPP expansion.

It was the first use of an atomic weapon in war. Its codename was “Little Boy.” It is estimated that between 90,000 and 140,000 people in Hiroshima died, the majority were civilians.\n\nThree days later, on August 9th, 1945, the United States dropped a plutonium atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan with the codename “Fat Man.” An estimated 60,000 to 80,000 people in Nagasaki were killed, including residents, undocumented foreign workers and military personnel.\n\nThe magnitude of death, horror and agony from the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki showed the world that nuclear weapons must never be used again.\n\nAt 11 am on the Santa Fe Plaza, we will come together to sing songs of peace and against nuclear weapons, to honor the victims and survivors of nuclear bombs development, testing and use around the world. We will vow to never allow another nuclear atrocity.\n\nAt 11:45 am we’ll walk to the intersection of West Alameda and Sandoval for the weekly peaceful protest, which lasts until 1 pm. We’ll display the Veterans for Peace flags, our banners that read, “Nuclear Weapons Are Illegal,” “A World Without Nuclear Weapons,” and banners with the words of the Pope about nuclear weapons being immoral. We’ll also display the Plutonium Caravan banner and signs that state that the nuclear weapons ban treaty, or the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, is now in force.\n\nIt has been 79 years since those atrocities occurred. Now some world leaders are saying the silent part out loud and urging the use of nuclear weapons to resolve conflicts.\n\nPlease join us on the Plaza and at the intersection of West Alameda and Sandoval as we work together for peace in this world.\n\nFriday, August 2nd at noon to 1 pm – Join the weekly peaceful protest for nuclear disarmament on the four corners of Alameda and Sandoval in downtown Santa Fe with Veterans for Peace, CCNS, Nuclear Watch NM, Loretto Community, New Mexico Peace Fest, Pax Christi and others.\n\nNew Mexico Water Planning Open Houses sponsored by the Office of the State Engineer, Interstate Stream Commission.

Meeting location: S. Department of Energy, Carlsbad Field Office, Skeen-Whitlock Building, Main Auditorium, 4021 National Parks Highway, Carlsbad, NM. https://www.epa.gov/radiation/wipp-news#WIPP-PCR\n\nWednesday, August 28th from 1 to 3 pm (technical meeting) and from 6 to 8 pm public meetings about DOE’s Planned Change Request for WIPP Replacement Panels 11 and 12. Meeting location: Hilton Santa Fe-Historic Plaza, 100 Sandoval Street, Canyon Ballroom, Santa Fe, NM.\n\nBackground on WIPP Planned Change Request: Replacement Panels 11 and 12\n\nOn March 14, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency received the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) letter transmitting its Planned Change Request (PCR) for the use of Replacement Panels 11 and 12 in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). This PCR serves as an official request from DOE for EPA approval, as outlined in the Agency’s WIPP Compliance Criteria (40 CFR Part 194).\n\nThe 2014 incident at WIPP and its subsequent impacts at the facility resulted in a loss of underground disposal capacity, mainly due to closures in the southern portion of the repository. With this submittal, DOE is proposing to add replacement panels 11 and 12 to recover the lost disposal capacity of approximately two panels. These panels were previously approved by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) under their hazardous waste permit in October 2023.\n\nThe Agency is currently reviewing and evaluating the PCR and supporting documentation, both for completeness and technical adequacy. EPA is reviewing the Performance Assessment (PA) calculations included with the DOE request. EPA’s decision on the DOE request will be made based on whether the submitted information indicates that the WIPP will remain in compliance with EPA’s radioactive waste disposal standards (40 CFR Part 191) with the inclusion of replacement panels 11 and 12. https://www.epa.gov/radiation/wipp-news#WIPP-PCR\n\nPublic comments due on September 16, 2024.\n\nhttp://nuclearactive.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CCNSUpdate072624mc.mp3\n\nSanta Fe Archbishop John Wester wrote a statement for last Monday’s Town Hall concerning plutonium pit production at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) hosted by National Nuclear Security Administrator Jill Hruby and the Department of Energy (DOE) Senior Advisor of the Office of Environmental Management, Candice Robertson. Jay Coghlan, of Nuclear Watch New Mexico, read the Archbishop’s statement aloud. https://nukewatch.org/\n\nThe Buffalo Thunder event drew over 500 people in person and online, possibly more than attended the Town Hall held at the Santa Fe Community Convention Center on April 4, 2023. http://nuclearactive.org/nnsa-and-doe-officials-will-be-in-santa-fe-on-tuesday-april-4th-to-answer-your-questions/\n\n“Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I’m John C. Wester, the Catholic Archbishop of Santa Fe. I regret that I can’t attend this meeting in person. Nuclear weapons were invented here in my Archdiocese. Therefore, I feel a special responsibility to address humanity’s most urgent threat.\n\n“Nuclear disarmament is a right to life issue. No other issue can cause the immediate collapse of civilization. In January 2022 I wrote a pastoral letter in which I traced the Vatican’s evolution from its uneasy conditional acceptance of so-called deterrence to Pope Francis’ declaration that the very possession of nuclear weapons is immoral. https://archdiosf.org/living-in-the-light-of-christs-peace\n\n“Therefore, what does this say about expanded plutonium pit production at the Los Alamos Lab? And what does it say about the obscene amounts of money that are being thrown at pit production, often excused as job creation?\n\n“What does this say about the fact that the [NNSA] is pursuing expanded pit production without providing the public the opportunity to review and comment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act? I specifically call upon NNSA to complete a new LANL Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement.\n\n“In two weeks, I travel to Japan for the 79th atomic bombing anniversaries. The bishops of Santa Fe, Seattle, Hiroshima and Nagasaki have a simple message for world leaders. You utterly failed to begin serious negotiations as required by the 1970 NonProliferation Treaty. In this era, you must demonstrate concrete steps toward multilateral, verifiable nuclear disarmament by the 80th bombing anniversaries a year from now. http://nuclearactive.org/four-archbishops-urge-g7-leaders-to-undertake-concrete-steps-toward-nuclear-disarmament/\n\n“I have a simple message for NNSA and the nuclear weapons labs. You’re very good at creating them. Now show us how smart you are by demonstrating how to get rid of nuclear weapons. Stop this new arms race that threatens all of civilization. Let’s preserve humanity’s potential to manifest God’s divine love toward all beings.\n\n“Yours in Christ’s love,\n\n“John C.

(see link BELOW to the recorded interview) Those sites are Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Host of KUNM-FM’s Let’s Talk New Mexico show, Megan Kamerick will facilitate the conversation about DOE’s plans to increase the number of nuclear weapons fabricated at LANL resulting in more plutonium-contaminated nuclear waste destined for WIPP. https://www.kunm.org/show/lets-talk-new-mexico/2024-07-12/nuclear-waste-wipp-lanl\n\nThen on Monday, July 22nd from 6 to 7:30 pm, key officials from DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and Office of Environmental Management (EM) will make short presentations at their in person and virtual town hall. The town hall will be held at the Buffalo Thunder Resort, located 13 miles north of downtown Santa Fe on U.S. 84 / 285 from 6 to 7:30 p.m., in the Pueblo Ballroom on the second floor. Parking is available on the north side of the building. https://www.energy.gov/em/events/northern-new-mexico-town-hall-july-2024\n\nNNSA Administrator, Jill Hruby, and EM Senior Advisor, Candice Robertson, will host the town hall and be available to answer your questions.\n\nTo register, go to: https://www.energy.gov/em/events/northern-new-mexico-town-hall-july-2024 You also email your questions ahead of time. external.engagements@nnsa.doe.gov\n\nIt is essential that the federal agencies hear your concerns!\n\nYour questions could include: What is the future of WIPP, which was supposed to be a pilot project, and closed in March 2024? https://wipp.energy.gov/ How much waste will be generated by the proposed increase during the fabrication of plutonium pits, or the triggers, for nuclear weapons at LANL? https://discover.lanl.gov/publications/national-security-science/2021-winter/pit-production-explained/ How long will WIPP remain open? DOE is saying WIPP would operate for 60 more years, or at least until 2083, or essentially FOREVER.\n\nIn the 1970s through the 1990s, DOE promised the People of New Mexico that if WIPP were opened, it would be able to cleanup and dispose of all the plutonium-contaminated waste at its sites across the country, including LANL, in 25 years and then close. But that did not happen. DOE now claims WIPP must stay open for at least six more decades to dispose of waste from LANL and other sites.\n\nThere are many resources to help you develop your comments at http://nuclearactive.org/ ; https://stopforeverwipp.org/ ; and https://nukewatch.org/ .\n\nLet’s Talk NM: Let’s talk nuclear waste production and storage, by Megan Kamerick.\n\nhttps://www.kunm.org/show/lets-talk-new-mexico/2024-07-12/nuclear-waste-wipp-lanl\n\nFriday, July 19th at noon – Join the weekly peaceful protest for nuclear disarmament on the four corners of Alameda and Sandoval in downtown Santa Fe with Veterans for Peace, CCNS, Nuclear Watch NM, Loretto Community, New Mexico Peace Fest, Pax Christi and others.\n\nThursday, July 18th from 5 to 7 pm – KAFB Bulk Fuels Facility Project – KAFB Groundwater Treatment System facility open house and site tours of the facility.

You are invited to attend either in-person or virtually. The virtual links will be available closer to the event. It is essential that the federal agencies hear your concerns!\n\nOur top concerns are the intricately linked expansion of nuclear weapons production at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the increase in plutonium-contaminated waste for disposal Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Both are DOE sites in New Mexico. As more information is revealed about the very expensive expansion plans at both sites, it is clear that DOE’s proposed doubling of the size of the WIPP underground disposal site is needed to support the proposed expansion of nuclear weapons production at LANL – all to fuel a new nuclear arms race.\n\nIn the 1970s through the 1990s, DOE promised the People of New Mexico that if WIPP were opened, it would be able to cleanup and dispose of all the plutonium-contaminated waste at its sites across the country in 25 years, and then close in March 2024. But that did not happen because DOE now needs WIPP to stay open until at least 2083 for disposal of waste produced at LANL. WIPP was not designed to operate for at least 59 more years.\n\nNone of DOE’s plans present a responsible alternative. For example, they say that over the next 50 years, nuclear weapons production will generate an estimated 57,550 cubic meters of radioactive and hazardous waste. This volume constitutes more than half of the estimated expansion capacity at WIPP and does not account for LANL’s buried plutonium-contaminated waste from the last nuclear arms race. DOE plans to keep that waste buried in unlined pits, trenches and shafts in volcanic tuff, even though radioactive and hazardous contaminants have been detected in the regional drinking water aquifer 1,000 feet below ground surface.\n\nWhat we know about the Monday, July 22nd town hall:\n\n* It will be held at Buffalo Thunder from 6 pm to 7:30 pm.\n\n* Each commenter will have three minutes to make comments.

Deterrence is rarely examined, let alone questioned, but it is often waved around like some verbal magic wand to justify extremely dangerous and exorbitant policies that threaten life on Earth. Our speakers will examine the very frightening flaws of deterrence theory that have too often brought humanity to the brink of extinction, and offer practical strategies and tactics to replace it, and to advance the cause of global nuclear disarmament.\n\nRegister here: https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_dVSI9r7FTX6R9_BUBCt0Mg#/registration\n\nThursday, July 11th in Taos, Friday, July 12th in Santa Fe, and Saturday, July 13th in Albuquerque (see below for details) – Justin Nobel speaks about his new book Petroleum 238: Big Oil’s Dangerous Secret about how a powerful industry spreads harm across the land and sickens the American people, especially their very own workers. https://www.truthdig.com/articles/it-could-be-oil-field-waste-making-you-sick/\n\nWhy this is important to folks opposing nuclear weapons and power:\n\n“With fossil fuels, essentially what you are doing is taking an underground radioactive reservoir and bringing it up to the surface where it can interact with people and the environment.”\n\n“Almost all materials of interest and use to the petroleum industry contain measurable quantities of radionuclides that reside finally in process equipment, product streams, or waste.”\n\nReadings:\n\nThursday July 11 from 5 to 6:30 pm: Book event at Society of the Muse of the Southwest (SOMOS) in Taos, NM.

All of this is threatened by an exemption from a federal law banning uranium mining in the watershed that feeds the complex river system. Uranium mining is allowed on U.S. Forest Service lands where the Pinyon Plains Uranium Mine is located less than ten miles from the Grand Canyon’s south rim. https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/grand-canyon-uranium\n\nIn December 2023, the Pinyon Plains Uranium Mine, formerly called the Canyon Mine, began mining operations. The owner of the mine, Energy Fuels Inc., plans to begin transporting extracted uranium 300 miles across the Navajo Nation to the corporation’s White Mesa Uranium Mill in southeast Utah. https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/white-mesa-uranium-mill and https://www.energyfuels.com/\n\nTribes and others in this large area know little about the corporation’s plans for transporting the dangerous materials. The federal and state agencies have done little, or none, of the required consultation with the tribes and communities about the transportation plans. The corporation has brought the threat of harm while ignoring its responsibilities to consult with those who want to keep their families safe. See links to the Uranium and the Grand Canyon panel conversation below.\n\nThe Navajo Nation passed a law against the transport of uranium across its lands. https://opvp.navajo-nsn.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/President-Nygren-signs-uranium-legislation-for-April-30.pdf It is unknown what the Nation will do when the first load leaves the mine. It is irresponsible to mine, let alone transport uranium ore through the Grand Canyon Watershed when we have already experienced the harm done to all living beings by decades of uranium mining.\n\nA recent mapping project by Stanford University shows about 23,000 abandoned uranium mines across the country. One must question beginning a new round of uranium mining when closure and cleanup of previous mining efforts have not been done. As a result, water continues to be contaminated.\n\nNew groundwater scientific studies reveal what Peoples living in and around the Grand Canyon know: that the high interconnectivity of the groundwater systems makes uranium mining not only risky, but extremely risky. https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/blog/uranium-mining-near-grand-canyon-too-risky-research-shows and https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/blog/flooding-uranium-mine-near-grand-canyon-tops-66-million-gallons\n\nTo learn more, watch the June 27, 2024 Uranium and the Grand Canyon panel conversation with a tribal leader, a health professional, an activist, and a former uranium miner. https://video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?fr=yhs-iba-3&ei=UTF-8&hsimp=yhs-3&hspart=iba&p=kjzz+news&type=teff_10019_FFW_ZZ#id=3&vid=9775763ef083421924a855a8b7311be1&action=view\n\nNavajo Nation President Buu Nygren provided an opening message. https://video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?fr=yhs-iba-3&ei=UTF-8&hsimp=yhs-3&hspart=iba&p=kjzz+news&type=teff_10019_FFW_ZZ#id=2&vid=9d88817057e55e3bb6c9803bc3b59c88&action=click\n\nGabriel Pietrorazio, of KJZZ News, hosted the event.

The nuclear-armed countries spent over $91.4 billion on their arsenals in 2023. At the same time, the corporations fabricating these weapons of mass destruction and their investors made billions in profit annually.\n\nOn Monday, June 17th, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) released its fifth annual report on global nuclear weapons spending. The report, entitled “Surge: 2023 Global nuclear weapons spending,” shows that $10.7 billion more was spent on nuclear weapons in 2023 than in 2022. The report covers how the nuclear weapons industry buys influence by financing think tanks, hiring lobbyists, and holding high-level meetings with government officials. https://www.icanw.org/global_nuclear_weapons_spending_surges_to_91_4_billion\n\nAn international campaign with one clear message: “No Money for Nuclear Weapons” will launch on Monday, September 16th through Sunday, September 22nd. Please plan to join in the activities or create your own local event. Visit the ICAN website week of action page and be sure to sign up to receive updates. https://www.icanw.org/global_week_of_action_on_nuclear_spending\n\nAs mentioned above, in 2023, the nine nuclear-armed states spent a combined total of $91.4 billion on their arsenals, which is equivalent to $174,000 per minute. The nine nuclear-armed states are: China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nThe U.S share of total spending, at $51.5 billion, is more than all the other nuclear-armed countries put together. The next biggest spender in 2023 was China at $11.8 billion, followed by Russia at $8.3 billion. The United Kingdom’s spending was up significantly for the second year in a row with a 17 percent increase to $8.1 billion. In the last five years, $387 billion has been spent on nuclear weapons globally.\n\nIn the last five years, the budget for nuclear weapons fabrication at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has nearly doubled from over $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2020 to $4 billion in fiscal year 2024 – an increase of over $1.7 billion. At the same time, New Mexico ranks 50th in child well-being and 50th in education. https://nukewatch.org/resources-and-information/economic-information/\n\nAlicia Sanders-Zakre, a report co-author, noted: “The acceleration of spending on these inhumane and destructive weapons over the past five years is not improving global security but posing a global threat.”\n\nFriday, June 21st at noon – Join the weekly peaceful protest for nuclear disarmament on the four corners of Alameda and Sandoval in downtown Santa Fe with Veterans for Peace, CCNS, Nuclear Watch NM, Loretto Community, Pax Christi and others.\n\nMonday, May 20th – PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO THURSDAY, JUNE 20th, 2024 – to EPA about its proposed rule allowing open burning / open detonation of hazardous wastes.

He has provided a stark warning about the dangers of nuclear weapons and above all the intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs and his work is being acknowledged this week. Join in virtual and live activities.\n\nIn 1971, Ellsberg became a whistleblower by giving the 7,000-page Pentagon Papers to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the New York Times, the Washington Post and 17 other newspapers. Ellsberg’s subsequent trial on twelve felony counts, posing a possible sentence of 115 years, was dismissed in 1973 on grounds of governmental misconduct against him, leading to the convictions of several White House aides and figuring in the impeachment proceedings against President Richard M. Nixon.\n\nEllsberg was a lecturer, scholar, writer and activist on the dangers of the nuclear era, wrongful U.S. interventions and the urgent need for principled whistleblowing until his death on June 16, 2023. Today, many people around the world are carrying on his legacy as a voice of reason in a nuclear weapons-armed world by working to end the threat of nuclear weapons and redirecting those funds to human needs.\n\nAll this week, live and virtual events are taking place, including webinars about the danger and cost of ICBMs; actions to divest Philadelphia from nuclear weapons; celebrations of Ellsberg’s legacy with Veterans for Peace in Seattle; and of his work to stop the doomsday machine. Monthly live events are scheduled to protest the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\nEllsberg worked to educate that ICBMs are the single greatest nuclear weapons threat in our world today. The U.S. is in the process of replacing its ICBMs. The program is already nearly 40 percent over budget.\n\nHe said, “When I say that there is a step that could reduce the risk of nuclear war significantly that has not been taken but could easily be taken, that is the elimination of American ICBMs.”\n\nJoin with RootsAction Education Fund https://rootsaction.org/education-fund and The Ellsberg Initiative for Peace and Democracy https://www.eipad.org/ to get the word out about Ellsberg’s work and the threat of ICBMs.\n\nMore information and social media posts you can use are available on the Defuse Nuclear War website. https://defusenuclearwar.org/ellsberg/ There you will find six podcasts with Ellsberg, directed by Oscar-nominee Judith Ehrlich. The series explores the dangers of nuclear weapons and the politics that drive their existence by a former nuclear war planner.\n\nFriday, June 14th at noon –Join the weekly peaceful protest for nuclear disarmament on the four corners of Alameda and Sandoval in downtown Santa Fe with Veterans for Peace, CCNS, Nuclear Watch NM, Loretto Community, Pax Christi and others.\n\nWednesday, June 19th at 6 pm – Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice – A talk by Koohan Paik-Mander about The inherent fascism of algorithms … & the militarization of society. https://www.abqpeaceandjustice.org/events\n\nMonday, May 20th – PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO THURSDAY, JUNE 20th, 2024 – to EPA about its proposed rule allowing open burning / open detonation of hazardous wastes.

One of the County’s goals is to develop and strengthen partnerships with Jemez Pueblo and Pueblo de San Ildefonso in their efforts to develop solar farms. https://losalamos.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx , Agenda Packet No. 18773-24 “Presentation and Review of Distributed Generation Impacts.”\n\nLast year, LANL proposed to construct a second 14-mile long, 115-kilovolt electrical line to mirror the existing line across the Caja del Rio in Santa Fe County, the Rio Grande and the Pajarito Plateau to bring 173 megawatts of electricity to LANL for its supercomputers. LANL also proposed upgrades to substations and infrastructure across the Plateau. A public review and comment period was provided on a draft environmental assessment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Many of the thousands of comments asked for a full environmental impact statement. LANL has not announced any decision as of yet. http://nuclearactive.org/february-15th-public-meeting-about-the-proposed-lanl-electrical-line-across-the-caja-del-rio/\n\nImportantly, since 1985, Los Alamos County and LANL have pooled their power resources through an Electric Energy and Coordination Agreement, also known as the Los Alamos Power Pool, or LAPP. Generally LANL consumes about 80 percent of the total energy produced or purchased by the LAPP. https://www.losalamosnm.us/News-articles/New-Solar-and-Battery-Contracts-Set-to-Double-Clean-Electricity-Supply\n\nOne of the County’s future energy goals is to upgrade the electric supply and distribution system. To meet these goals, the County now is proposing to conduct an Electric System Power Study to determine future system requirements. https://losalamos.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx , Agenda Packet No. 18773-24 “Presentation and Review of Distributed Generation Impacts.”\n\nNOW, through the Power Pool, there is a need for a study. This was not the case during the NEPA process for the proposed electrical line across the Caja del Rio. LANL did not describe the need for the 173 megawatts.\n\nDuring the environmental assessment public process, the Power Pool obtained 170 megawatts from a project in San Juan County, called the Foxtail Flats Solar and Battery Energy Storage System. http://nuclearactive.org/los-alamos-county-moves-forward-with-solar-power-through-proposed-electrical-line-across-the-caja-del-rio/\n\nAnother County goal is “to develop and strengthen partnerships with stakeholders.” The objective is “to continue to coordinate infrastructure construction projects as early as possible between DOE, San Ildefonso Pueblo, Department of Public Utilities and Public Works, especially for communications infrastructure.” The action is to “cooperate with DOE on a third transmission line and Partner with the Jemez Pueblo to develop a new power source into Los Alamos.” https://losalamos.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx , Agenda Packet No. 18773-24 “Presentation and Review of Distributed Generation Impacts.”\n\nThere was discussion during the June 5th meeting, which can be viewed soon on the County’s website. https://losalamos.granicus.com/ViewSearchResults.php?view_id=2&keywords=Board%20of%20Public%20Utilities\n\nFriday, June 7th at noon –Join the weekly peaceful protest for nuclear disarmament on the four corners of Alameda and Sandoval in downtown Santa Fe with Veterans for Peace, CCNS, Nuclear Watch NM, Loretto Community, Pax Christi and others.\n\nWednesday, June 19th at 6 pm – Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice – A talk by Koohan Paik-Mander about The inherent fascism of algorithms … & the militarization of society. https://www.abqpeaceandjustice.org/events\n\nMonday, May 20th – PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO THURSDAY, JUNE 20th, 2024 – to EPA about its proposed rule allowing open burning / open detonation of hazardous wastes.
