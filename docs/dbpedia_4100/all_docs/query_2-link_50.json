        "text": "The appropriate regex would be the ' char followed by any number of any chars [including zero chars] ending with an end of string/line token:\n\n'.*$\n\nAnd if you wanted to capture everything after the ' char but not include it in the output, you would use:\n\n(?<=').*$\n\nThis basically says give me all characters that follow the ' char until the end of the line.\n\nEdit: It has been noted that $ is implicit when using .* and therefore not strictly required, therefore the pattern:\n\n'.*\n\nis technically correct, however it is clearer to be specific and avoid confusion for later code maintenance, hence my use of the $. It is my belief that it is always better to declare explicit behaviour than rely on implicit behaviour in situations where clarity could be questioned.\n\nIn your example I'd go for the following pattern:\n\n'([^\\n]+)$\n\nuse multiline and global options to match all occurences.\n\nTo include the linefeed in the match you could use:\n\n'[^\\n]+\\n\n\nBut this might miss the last line if it has no linefeed.\n\nFor a single line, if you don't need to match the linefeed I'd prefer to use:\n\n'[^$]+$\n\nThis will capture everything up to the ' in backreference 1 - and everything after the ' in backreference 2. You may need to escape the apostrophes though depending on language (\\')\n\n/^([^']*)'?(.*)$/\n\nQuick modification: if the line doesn't have an ' - backreference 1 should still catch the whole line.\n\n^ - start of string ([^']*) - capture any number of not ' characters '? - match the ' 0 or 1 time (.*) - capture any number of characters $ - end of string\n\nhttps://regex101.com/r/Jjc2xR/1\n\n/(\\w*\\(Hex\\): w*)(.*?)(?= |$)/gm\n\nI'm sure this one works, it will capture de hexa serial in the badly structured text multilined bellow\n\nSpace Reservation: disabled Serial Number: wCVt1]IlvQWv Serial Number (Hex): 77435674315d496c76515776 Comment: new comment\n\nI'm a eternal newbie in regex but I'll try explain this one\n\n(\\w*(Hex): w*) : Find text in line where string contains \"Hex: \"\n\n(.*?) This is the second captured text and means everything after\n\n(?= |$) create a limit that is the space between = and the |\n\nSo with the second group, you will have the value"
