The requisite information is described in the NSF Prospective New Awardee Guide. The information contained in this Guide will assist the organization in preparing documents which NSF requires to conduct administrative and financial reviews of the organization. This Guide also serves as a means of highlighting the accountability requirements associated with Federal awards.\n\nProposers should be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in Building the Future: Investing in Discovery and Innovation - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2018 – 2022. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.\n\nOne of the strategic objectives in support of NSF’s mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at NSF recipient organizations. These organizations recruit, train, and prepare a diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF’s contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation’s most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong STEM workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.\n\nNSF will not tolerate research misconduct in proposing or performing research funded by NSF, reviewing research proposals submitted to NSF, or in reporting research results funded by NSF. For additional information, see Chapters I.D.3., IX.B., and XII.C.\n\nNSF’s mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, organizations, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.\n\nReturn to top\n\nA. Conformance with Instructions for Proposal Preparation\n\n1. Deviations from NSF Proposal Preparation and Submission Requirements\n\nUnless specified in a program solicitation, all proposals must comply with the proposal preparation instructions contained in Part I of the PAPPG or the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide. Conformance will be strictly enforced unless a written deviation authorization is received in advance of proposal submission from the cognizant NSF Assistant Director/Office Head or designee. Such deviation authorizations must be uploaded as a single-copy document and include the name, date, and title of the NSF official, and the nature of the deviation authorized. (See section C.1 below for additional information.)\n\nExcept as noted above, NSF will not accept or will return without review proposals that are not consistent with these instructions. See Chapter IV.B for additional information.\n\n2. Requests for Reasonable and Accessibility Accommodations\n\nNSF is dedicated to fostering and maintaining a diverse and inclusive digital environment that eliminates barriers and ensures our programs, systems, and services are accessible to everyone as required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended in 2017. Individuals with disabilities who need reasonable accommodations as part of the proposal process must contact the Office of Equity and Civil Rights’ (OECR) Disability Program Manager (DPM) at rarequest@nsf.gov at least 30 calendar days prior to the proposal deadline date. Individuals with disabilities who need accessibility accommodations to access NSF proposal submission and award management systems, websites and other digital content must contact the NSF Section 508 Compliance Officer at least 30 calendar days prior to the proposal deadline date. For reasonable accommodation requests, NSF may request medical documentation signed and dated by the proposer’s physician that describes a) the nature, severity, and duration of the impairment; b) the activities the impairment limits; and c) why and how the particular reasonable accommodation requested will assist the proposer.\n\nThe information provided in support of a reasonable accommodation request is confidential and available only to designated agency staff that are responsible for providing and/or coordinating accommodation services. Decisions on reasonable accommodations are made by the DPM, in concert with applicable agency officials and based on the information provided. It is important to note that the desired request may not always be the accommodation that is ultimately provided. NSF is not required to provide accommodations that impose an “undue hardship” on the operation of the organization or that fundamentally alter the nature of its programs or activities. Requests for reasonable or accessibility accommodations may not include personal use items or extensions to proposal deadline dates. All proposals must be received by the deadline date specified in the NSF funding opportunity\n\nBack to top\n\nB. NSF Disclosure Requirements\n\nAs part of the proposal preparation and submission process, all senior personnel identified on a proposal are required to submit information to assist reviewers and program staff in making informed recommendations and funding decisions. These disclosures are provided in the following proposal sections:\n\nBiographical Sketch; (see Chapter II,D.h(i));\n\nCurrent and Pending Support (see Chapter II.D.h(ii); and\n\nCollaborators and Other Affiliations (see Chapter II.D.h(iii)).\n\nIt is vital that submission of such disclosure information be taken seriously. The Biographical Sketch and Current and Pending Support documents require the individual to certify that the information provided is accurate, current, and complete. Violation of disclosure requirements may lead to criminal, civil, and/or administrative consequences as may be deemed appropriate based upon the particular facts of the violation. Violations will be thoroughly investigated by the NSF OIG and referred to criminal and/or civil offices within the Department of Justice, when warranted.\n\nDepending on the facts surrounding the violation, and consistent with due process requirements, NSF may consider a range of actions. Such actions include, but are not limited to:\n\nnon-acceptance of a proposal submitted to NSF;\n\nensuring that individual(s) who violate these requirements are not permitted to perform work under an NSF award;\n\nineligibility for participation as an NSF reviewer;\n\nsuspension or termination of an award; and/or\n\nplacement of the individual or research organization in SAM or the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) to alert other agencies.\n\nNSF will require senior personnel on potential awards to submit updated Current and Pending Support information prior to award, as well as part of the annual and final reporting process, when applicable.\n\nNSF may consider the following factors, where relevant and consistent with applicable laws and regulations, in determining the appropriate consequences for violations of disclosure requirements:\n\nharm or potential harm to NSF, the Federal Government, U.S. taxpayers, and other national interests;\n\nintent of the offender;\n\nthe offender’s knowledge of requirements;\n\npattern of violation versus isolated incident;\n\nexistence and timing of self-disclosure;\n\npolicies, procedures, and training available to the offender; and\n\nany other mitigating factors.\n\nBack to top\n\nC. Format of the Proposal\n\nPrior to submission, it is strongly recommended that proposers conduct an administrative review to ensure that proposals comply with the guidelines established in Part I of the PAPPG or the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide. The Proposal Preparation Checklist (Exhibit II-1) may be used to assist in this review. The checklist is not intended to be an all-inclusive repetition of the required proposal contents and associated proposal preparation guidelines. It is, however, meant to highlight certain critical items so they will not be overlooked when the proposal is prepared.\n\nDuring completion of the proposal setup wizard in Research.gov, the PI will be prompted to select the applicable response that describes the nature and type of proposal being developed:\n\nResearch (see Chapter II, Sections A through D);\n\nPlanning Proposal (see Chapter II.F.1);\n\nRapid Response Research (RAPID) (see Chapter II.F.2);\n\nEarly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) (see Chapter II.F.3);\n\nResearch Advanced by Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RAISE) (see Chapter II.F.4);\n\nGrant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) (see Chapter II.F.5);\n\nIdeas Lab (see Chapter II.F.6);\n\nFacilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED) (see Chapter II.F.7);\n\nCareer-Life Balance (CLB) Supplemental Funding Requests (see Chapter II.F.8);\n\nConference (see Chapter II.F.9);\n\nEquipment (see Chapter II.F.10);\n\nTravel (see Chapter II.F.11);\n\nCenter (see relevant funding opportunity and Chapter II.F.12);\n\nResearch Infrastructure (see relevant funding opportunity and Chapter II.F.13); or\n\nFellowship (see relevant funding opportunity).\n\nWhether the proposal is:\n\nA collaborative proposal from one organization (see Chapter II.E.3.a);\n\nA collaborative proposal from multiple organizations (see Chapter II.E.3.b); or\n\nNot a collaborative proposal.\n\nThe requested proposal information noted above will be used to determine the applicable proposal preparation requirements that must be followed. Proposers are strongly advised to review the applicable sections of Part I of the PAPPG pertinent to the type of proposal being developed prior to submission.\n\nAll proposals are checked for compliance with applicable requirements prior to submission in Research.gov. Additional information on NSF auto-compliance checks is available on the NSF website.\n\n1. Proposal Pagination Instructions\n\nFor proposals submitted via Research.gov, the system will automatically paginate a proposal. Each section of the proposal that is uploaded as a file should leave out page numbering unless otherwise directed within Research.gov.\n\n2. Proposal Font, Spacing, and Margin Requirements\n\nThe proposal must conform to the following requirements:\n\nUse one of the following fonts identified below:\n\nArial[6] (not Arial Narrow), Courier New, or Palatino Linotype at a font size of 10 points or larger;\n\nTimes New Roman at a font size of 11 points or larger; or\n\nComputer Modern family of fonts at a font size of 11 points or larger.\n\nA font size of less than 10 points may be used for mathematical formulas or equations, figures, tables, or diagram captions and when using a Symbol font to insert Greek letters or special characters. Other fonts not specified above, such as Cambria Math, may be used for mathematical formulas, equations, or when inserting Greek letters or special characters. PIs are cautioned, however, that the text must still be readable.\n\nNo more than six lines of text within a vertical space of one inch.\n\nMargins, in all directions, must be at least an inch. No proposer-supplied information may appear in the margins.\n\nPaper size must be no larger than standard letter paper size (8 ½ by 11”).\n\nThese requirements apply to all uploaded sections of a proposal, including supplementary documentation.\n\n3. Page Formatting\n\nProposers are strongly encouraged to use only a standard, single-column format for the text.\n\nThe guidelines specified above establish the minimum font size requirements; however, PIs are advised that readability is of paramount importance and should take precedence in selection of an appropriate font for use in the proposal. Use of a small font size makes it difficult for reviewers to read the proposal; consequently, the use of small fonts not in compliance with the above guidelines may be grounds for NSF to return the proposal without review. Adherence to font size and line spacing requirements also is necessary to ensure that no proposer will have an unfair advantage, by using smaller font or line spacing to provide more text in the proposal.\n\nBack to top\n\nD. Proposal Contents\n\n1. Single-Copy Documents\n\nCertain categories of information that are submitted in conjunction with a proposal are for \"NSF Use Only.\" As such, the information is not provided to reviewers for use in the review of the proposal. With the exception of NSF-specific proposal certifications, these documents should be submitted in Research.gov. A summary of each of these categories follows:\n\na. Authorization to Deviate from NSF Proposal Preparation Requirements (if applicable)\n\nInstructions for obtaining authorization to deviate from NSF proposal preparation instructions are provided in Chapter II.A.\n\nb. List of Suggested Reviewers or Reviewers Not to Include (optional)\n\nProposers may include a list of suggested reviewers (including email address and organizational affiliation) who they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal. Proposers also may designate persons they would prefer not to review the proposal. These suggestions are optional. Exhibit II-2 contains information on conflicts of interest that may be useful in preparation of this list.\n\nThe cognizant Program Officer handling the proposal considers the suggestions and may contact the proposer for further information. The decision regarding whether to use these suggestions, however, remains with the Program Officer.\n\nc. Proprietary or Privileged Information (if applicable)\n\nInstructions for submission of proprietary or privileged information are provided in Chapter II.E.1.\n\nSee also Chapter II.B. for additional information on Single Copy Documents.\n\nd. Proposal Certifications Provided by the Organization\n\nGovernment-wide certifications and representations are provided by the proposer on an annual basis in SAM (see PAPPG Chapter I.G.2). Note that the box for \"Disclosure of Lobbying Activities\" must be checked on the Cover Sheet if, pursuant to the Lobbying certification provided in SAM, submission of the SF LLL is required. The AOR must use the \"Authorized Organizational Representative function\" to sign and submit the proposal, including NSF-specific proposal certifications. It is the proposing organization's responsibility to assure that only properly authorized individuals perform this function.[7]\n\nSee also PAPPG Chapters II.F.8 and II.F.11 for additional information on proposal certifications.\n\nThe required NSF-specific proposal certifications are as follows:\n\n(i) Certification for Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) or Individual Proposer:\n\nThe AOR is required to complete certifications regarding the accuracy and completeness of statements contained in the proposal, as well as to certify that the organization (or individual) agrees to accept the obligation to comply with award terms and conditions.\n\n(ii) Certification Regarding Conflict of Interest:\n\nThe AOR is required to complete certifications stating that the organization has implemented and is enforcing a written policy on conflicts of interest (COI), consistent with the provisions of Chapter IX.A: that, to the best of the AOR’s knowledge, all financial disclosures required by the conflict of interest policy were made; and that conflicts of interest, if any, were, or prior to the organization’s expenditure of any funds under the award, will be, satisfactorily managed, reduced or eliminated in accordance with the organization’s conflict of interest policy. Conflicts that cannot be satisfactorily managed, reduced or eliminated, and research that proceeds without the imposition of conditions or restrictions when a conflict of interest exists, must be disclosed to NSF via use of NSF’s electronic systems.\n\n(iii) Certification Regarding Flood Hazard Insurance[8]:\n\nTwo sections of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 USC §4012a and §4106) bar Federal agencies from giving financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes in any area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as having special flood hazards unless the:\n\n(1) community in which that area is located participates in the national flood insurance program; and\n\n(2) building (and any related equipment) is covered by adequate flood insurance.\n\nBy signing the certification pages, AORs for prospective recipients located in FEMA-designated special flood hazard areas are certifying that adequate flood insurance has been or will be obtained in the following situations:\n\n(1) for NSF awards for the construction of a building or facility, regardless of the dollar amount of the award; and\n\n(2) for other NSF awards when more than $25,000 has been budgeted in the proposal for repair, alteration, or improvement (construction) of a building or facility.\n\nProspective recipients should contact their local government or a Federally-insured financial institution to determine what areas are identified as having special flood hazards and the availability of flood insurance in their community.\n\n(iv) Certification Regarding Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research (RECR):\n\nNote: The requirement specified in Section 7009 of the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (COMPETES) Act (42 USC 1862o–1), as amended, to have a plan to provide appropriate training and oversight in the responsible and ethical conduct of research to faculty and other senior personnel who will be supported by NSF to conduct research will go into effect for new proposals submitted or due on or after July 31, 2023. NSF, however, encourages the community to establish such training and oversight for faculty and other senior personnel prior to the July 31, 2023, implementation. In the interim, proposers must continue to meet the guidance specified in PAPPG Chapter IX.B.\n\nThe AOR is required to complete a certification that the institution has a plan to provide appropriate training and oversight in the responsible and ethical conduct of research to undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty, and other senior personnel who will be supported by NSF to conduct research and that such training addresses mentor training and mentorship.\n\nNSF’s RECR policy is available in Chapter IX.B. While training plans are not required to be included in proposals submitted to NSF, institutions are advised that they are subject to review upon request. NSF has provided funding to the Online Ethics Center for S&E, an online collaborative resource environment that provides resources that may be used by the institution in developing their training plan. This site contains RECR resources by discipline, provides links to published codes of ethics, as well as includes pages dedicated to resources produced or used by specific professional groups.\n\n(v) Certification Regarding Organizational Support:\n\nThe AOR is required to complete a certification that there is organizational support for the proposal as required by Section 526 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. This support extends to the portion of the proposal developed to satisfy the broader impacts review criterion as well as the intellectual merit review criterion, and any additional review criteria specified in the solicitation. Organizational support will be made available, as described in the proposal, in order to address the broader impacts and intellectual merit activities to be undertaken.\n\n(vi) Certification Regarding Dual Use Research of Concern:\n\nThe AOR is required to complete a certification that the organization will be or is in compliance with all aspects of the United States Government Policy for Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern.\n\n(vii) Certification Requirement Specified in the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, Section 223(a)(1) (42 USC 6605(a)(1)):\n\nThe AOR is required to complete a certification that each individual employed by the organization and identified on the proposal as senior personnel has been made aware of the certification requirements identified in the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, Section 223(a)(1) (42 USC 6605(a)(1)).\n\n(viii) Safe and Inclusive Working Environments for Off-Campus or Off-Site Research\n\nFor each proposal that proposes to conduct research off-campus or off site, the AOR must complete a certification that the organization has a plan in place for this proposal regarding safe and inclusive working environments. See Chapter II.E.9 for additional information.\n\ne. Certification Requirement for Senior Personnel Specified in the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, Section 223(a)(1) (42 USC 6605(a)(1)):\n\nIn accordance with Section 223(a)(1) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (42 USC 6605(a)(1)),senior personnel are required to certify in SciENcv that the information provided in their Biographical Sketch and Current and Pending Support documents are accurate, current, and complete.\n\nSenior personnel are required to update their Current and Pending Support disclosures prior to award, and at any subsequent time the agency determines appropriate during the term of the award.\n\nFalse representations may be subject to prosecution and liability pursuant to, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. §§287, 1001, 1031 and 31 U.S.C. §§3729-3733 and 3802.\n\nSee additional information on NSF Disclosure Requirements in Chapter II.B.\n\nf. Submission of Proposals by Former NSF Staff\n\nFor one year following separation from the Foundation, any communication with NSF by a former employee or IPA must be done through use of a \"substitute negotiator.\" Unless a substitute negotiator has been designated by the proposer/recipient, the Division of Grants and Agreements (DGA) or the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) will not process a new proposal with a former employee or IPA as PI or co-PI. If it has been less than a year since a former employee separated from NSF or an IPA ended their appointment and they submit a proposal, documentation from the AOR needs to be included which designates a substitute negotiator for that proposal. The substitute negotiator must be from the same organization as the PI or co-PI for whom the negotiator is required. A co-PI on a new proposal should designate the PI as the substitute negotiator. This information should be submitted as a single copy document and uploaded in the “Additional Single Copy Documents” category.\n\nBack to top\n\n2. Sections of the Proposal\n\nThe sections described below represent the body of a research proposal submitted to NSF. Failure to submit the required sections will result in the proposal not being accepted[9], or being returned without review. See Chapter IV.B for additional information.\n\nA full research proposal must contain the following sections[10]. Note that the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide may use different naming conventions, and sections may appear in a different order than in Research.gov, however, the content is the same:\n\nCover Sheet\n\nProject Summary\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProject Description\n\nReferences Cited\n\nBudget and Budget Justification\n\nFacilities, Equipment and Other Resources\n\nSenior Personnel Documents\n\n(i) Biographical Sketch(es)\n\n(ii) Current and Pending Support\n\n(iii)Collaborators and Other Affiliations (see also PAPPG Chapter II.D.1 for additional information on submission of single copy documents\n\nSpecial Information and Supplementary Documentation[11]\n\n(i) Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan (if applicable)\n\n(ii) Data Management Plan\n\nThe proposal preparation instructions for Planning, RAPID, EAGER, RAISE, GOALI, Ideas Lab, FASED, conference, equipment, travel, center, research infrastructure, and fellowship proposal types may deviate from the above content requirements.\n\nAll proposals submitted to NSF will be reviewed using the two NSB-approved merit review criteria described in greater length in Chapter III.\n\nBack to top\n\na. Cover Sheet\n\nThere are seven components of the Cover Sheet. The Cover Sheet data elements are as follows:\n\nRequested Start Date and Proposal Duration\n\nThe proposed duration for which support is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed activity. The Foundation encourages proposers to request funding for durations of three to five years when such durations are necessary for completion of the proposed work and are technically and managerially advantageous. The requested start date should allow at least six months for NSF review, processing, and decision. PIs should consult their organization’s SPO for unusual situations (e.g., a long lead time for procurement) that create problems regarding the proposed start date. Specification of a desired start date for the project is important and helpful to NSF staff; however, requests for specific start dates may not be met.\n\nRelated Letter of Intent (LOI)\n\nIf an LOI was submitted, enter the LOI ID number that was issued upon submission.\n\nRelated Preliminary Proposal\n\nIf a preliminary proposal was submitted, and the organization was either invited or encouraged/discouraged to submit a full proposal, provide the Preliminary Proposal Number.\n\nPrime Organization\n\nThe information on the Awardee Organization is prefilled on the Cover Sheet based on the login information entered. NSF uses the legal business name and physical address from the organizations’ SAM registration.\n\nThe awardee organization name, address, NSF organization code, UEI, and Employer Identification Number/Taxpayer Identification Number are derived from the profile information provided by the organization or pulled by NSF from the SAM database and are not entered when preparing the Cover Sheet.\n\nOrganizations must identify their status by checking all the applicable boxes on the Cover Sheet:\n\nFor-profit organizations must be U.S.-based commercial organizations, including small businesses, with strong capabilities in scientific or engineering research or education and a passion for innovation. See PAPPG Chapter I.E.3 for additional information.\n\nA small business must be organized for profit, independently owned, and operated (not a subsidiary of, or controlled by, another firm), have no more than 500 employees, and not be dominant in its field.\n\nA minority business must be: (i) at least 51 percent owned by one or more minority or disadvantaged individuals or, in the case of a publicly owned business, have at least 51 percent of the voting stock owned by one or more minority or disadvantaged individuals; and (ii) one whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more such individuals.\n\nA woman-owned business must be at least 51 percent owned by a woman or women, who also control and operate it. \"Control\" in this context means exercising the power to make policy decisions. \"Operate\" in this context means being actively involved in the day-to-day management.\n\nPrimary Place of Performance\n\nThe Primary Place of Performance (PPoP) information will default to the organization’s physical address. If the project will be performed at a location other than the awardee organization, provide the following information (where applicable).\n\nOrganization Name (identify the organization name of the primary site where the work will be performed, if different than the awardee);\n\nCountry\n\nStreet Address;\n\nCity;\n\nState/Territory; and\n\n9-digit Postal Code.\n\nNote that not all fields listed above are required. Research.gov specifies the fields that are required for projects that will be performed at locations other than that of the proposing organization.\n\nFor research infrastructure projects, the project/performance site should correspond to the physical location of the asset. For research infrastructure that is mobile or geographically distributed, information for the primary site or organizational headquarters (as defined by the proposer) should be provided.\n\nOther Federal Agencies\n\nIf the proposal is being submitted for consideration by another Federal agency, the abbreviated name(s) of the Federal agency(ies) must be identified in the space provided.\n\nOther Information\n\nIf any of the following items on the Cover Sheet are applicable to the proposal being submitted, the relevant box(es) must be checked.\n\nBeginning Investigator (See Chapter II.E.2) (Note: this box is applicable only to proposals submitted to the Biological Sciences Directorate.)\n\nDisclosure of Lobbying Activities (See Chapter II.D.1.d)\n\nProprietary or Privileged Information (See Chapter II.D.1.c and II.E.1)\n\nSpecial Exceptions to the Deadline Date Policy (See Chapter I.F.3)\n\nHistoric Places (See Chapter II.D.2.i(vii))\n\nLive Vertebrate Animals[12] (See Chapter II.E.4)\n\nHuman Subjects[13] (See Chapter II.E.5)\n\nFunding of an International Branch Campus of a U.S. IHE (See Chapter I.E.1) – If this box is checked, the proposer also must enter the name of the applicable country(ies) in the International Activities Country Name(s) box described below.\n\nFunding of a Foreign Organization or Foreign Individual (See Chapter I.E.6) – If this box is checked, the proposer also must enter the name of the applicable country(ies) in the International Activities Country Name(s) box described below.\n\nInternational Activities Country Name(s) – each proposal that describes an international activity, proposers should list the primary countries involved. An international activity is defined as research, training, and/or education carried out in cooperation with international counterparts either overseas or in the U.S. using virtual technologies. Proposers also should enter the country/countries with which project participants will engage and/or travel to attend international conferences. If the specific location of the international conference is not known at the time of the proposal submission, proposers should enter “Worldwide”. (See Chapter II.E.8)\n\nPotential Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) (See Chapters II.E.6 and XI.B.5)\n\nOff-Campus or Off-Site Research – For purposes of this requirement, off-campus or off-site research is defined as data/information/samples being collected off-campus or off-site, such as fieldwork and research activities on vessels and aircraft. (See Chapter II.D.1.d(viii) and II.E.9).\n\nBack to top\n\nb. Project Summary\n\nEach proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than one page in length. The Project Summary consists of an overview, a statement on the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement on the broader impacts of the proposed activity.\n\nThe overview includes a description of the activity that would result if the proposal were funded and a statement of objectives and methods to be employed. The statement on intellectual merit should describe the potential of the proposed activity to advance knowledge. The statement on broader impacts should describe the potential of the proposed activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.\n\nThe Project Summary should be informative to other persons working in the same or related fields, and, insofar as possible, understandable to a broad audience within the scientific domain. It should not be an abstract of the proposal.\n\nBack to top\n\nc. Table of Contents\n\nA Table of Contents is automatically generated for the proposal. The proposer cannot edit this form.\n\nBack to top\n\nd. Project Description (including Results from Prior NSF Support)\n\n(i) Content\n\nThe Project Description should provide a clear statement of the work to be undertaken and must include the objectives for the period of the proposed work and expected significance; the relationship of this work to the present state of knowledge in the field, as well as to work in progress by the PI under other support.\n\nThe Project Description should outline the general plan of work, including the broad design of activities to be undertaken, and, where appropriate, provide a clear description of experimental methods and procedures. Proposers should address what they want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified. These issues apply to both the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions.\n\nThe Project Description also must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a section labeled “Broader Impacts”. This section should provide a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to the achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the U.S.; use of science and technology to inform public policy; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education. These examples of societally relevant outcomes should not be considered either comprehensive or prescriptive. Proposers may include appropriate outcomes not covered by these examples.\n\nPlans for data management and sharing of the products of research, including preservation, documentation, and sharing of data, samples, physical collections, curriculum materials and other related research and education products should be described in the Special Information and Supplementary Documentation section of the proposal (see Chapter II.D.2.i(ii) for additional instructions for preparation of this section).\n\nFor proposals that include funding to an International Branch Campus of a U.S. IHE or to a foreign organization or foreign individual (including through use of a subaward or consultant arrangement), the proposer must provide the requisite explanation/justification in the project description. See Chapter I.E for additional information on the content requirements.\n\n(ii) Page Limitations and Inclusion of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) within the Project Description\n\nBrevity will assist reviewers and Foundation staff in dealing effectively with proposals. Therefore, the Project Description (including Results from Prior NSF Support, which is limited to five pages) may not exceed 15 pages. Visual materials, including charts, graphs, maps, photographs, and other pictorial presentations are included in the 15-page limitation. PIs are cautioned that the Project Description must be self-contained, and that URLs must not be used because: 1) the information could circumvent page limitations; 2) the reviewers are under no obligation to view the sites; and 3) the sites could be altered or deleted between the time of submission and the time of review.\n\nConformance to the 15-page limit will be strictly enforced and may not be exceeded unless a deviation has been specifically authorized. (Chapter II.A contains information on deviations.)\n\n(iii) Results from Prior NSF Support\n\nThe purpose of this section is to assist reviewers in assessing the quality of prior work conducted with prior or current NSF funding. If any PI or co-PI identified on the proposal has received prior NSF support including:\n\nan award with an end date in the past five years; or\n\nany current funding, including any no cost extensions\n\nInformation on the award is required for each PI and co-PI, regardless of whether the support was directly related to the proposal or not. In cases where the PI or any co-PI has received more than one award (excluding amendments to existing awards), they need only report on the one award that is most closely related to the proposal. Support means salary support, as well as any other funding awarded by NSF, including research, Graduate Research Fellowship, Major Research Instrumentation, conference, equipment, travel, and center awards, etc.\n\nThe following information must be provided:\n\n(a) the NSF award number, amount and period of support;\n\n(b) the title of the project;\n\n(c) a summary of the results of the completed work, including accomplishments, supported by the award. The results must be separately described under two distinct headings: Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts;\n\n(d) a listing of the publications resulting from the NSF award (a complete bibliographic citation for each publication must be provided either in this section or in the References Cited section of the proposal); if none, state “No publications were produced under this award.”\n\n(e) evidence of research products and their availability, including, but not limited to: data, publications, samples, physical collections, software, and models, as described in any Data Management Plan; and\n\n(f) if the proposal is for renewed support, a description of the relation of the completed work to the proposed work.\n\nIf the project was recently awarded and therefore no new results exist, describe the major goals and broader impacts of the project. Note that the proposal may contain up to five pages to describe the results. Results may be summarized in fewer than five pages, which would give the balance of the 15 pages for the Project Description.\n\n(iv) Unfunded Collaborations\n\nAny substantial collaboration with individuals not included in the budget should be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section of the proposal (see Chapter II.D.2.g) and documented in a letter of collaboration from each collaborator. Such letters should be provided in the supplementary documentation section of Research.gov and follow the format instructions specified in Chapter II.D.2.i. Collaborative activities that are identified in the budget should follow the instructions in Chapter II.E.3.\n\n(v) Group Proposals\n\nNSF encourages submission of proposals by groups of investigators; often these are submitted to carry out interdisciplinary projects. Unless stipulated in a specific program solicitation, however, such proposals will be subject to the 15-page Project Description limitation established in Section (ii) above. PIs who wish to exceed the established page limitations for the Project Description must request and receive a deviation in advance of proposal submission. (Chapter II.A contains information on deviations.)\n\n(vi) Proposals for Renewed Support\n\nSee Chapter V for guidance on preparation of renewal proposals.\n\nBack to top\n\ne. References Cited\n\nReference information is required. Each reference must include the names of all authors (in the same sequence in which they appear in the publication), the article and journal title, book title, volume number, page numbers, and year of publication. (See also Chapter II.D.2.d(iii)(d)) If the proposer has a website address readily available, that information should be included in the citation. It is not NSF's intent, however, to place an undue burden on proposers to search for the URL of every referenced publication. Therefore, inclusion of a website address is optional. A proposal that includes reference citation(s) that do not specify a URL is not considered to be in violation of NSF proposal preparation guidelines and the proposal will still be reviewed.\n\nProposers must be especially careful to follow accepted scholarly practices in providing citations for source materials relied upon when preparing any section of the proposal. While there is no established page limitation for the references, this section must include bibliographic citations only and must not be used to provide parenthetical information outside of the 15-page Project Description.\n\nBack to top\n\nf. Budget and Budget Justification\n\nThe proposal budget sets forth how much money the proposer is requesting, by category, to complete the project. The budget justification provides a more detailed breakdown of proposed spending in each category as well as a justification supporting the numbers provided in each budget category. This information is relied upon by NSF in formulating the total award amount and final award budget that is incorporated into any resultant award. (See PAPPG Chapter VI.B.1.)\n\nEach proposal must contain a budget for each year of support requested. The budget justification must be no more than five pages per proposal. The amounts for each budget line item requested must be documented and justified in the budget justification as specified below.\n\nFor proposals that contain a subaward(s), each subaward must include a separate budget justification of no more than five pages. See Chapter II.D.2.f(vi)(e) for further instructions on proposals that contain subawards. For collaborative proposals submitted by multiple organizations, each organization must include a separate budget justification of no more than five pages.\n\nThe proposal may request funds under any of the categories listed so long as the item and amount are considered necessary, reasonable, allocable, and allowable under 2 CFR §200, Subpart E, NSF policy, and/or the program solicitation. For-profit entities are subject to the cost principles contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 31. Amounts and expenses budgeted also must be consistent with the proposing organization's policies and procedures and cost accounting practices used in accumulating and reporting costs.\n\nProposals for mid-scale and major facilities also should consult NSF’s Research Infrastructure Guide as well as the relevant solicitation for additional budgetary preparation guidelines.\n\n(i) Salaries and Wages (Lines A and B on the Proposal Budget)\n\n(a) Senior Personnel Salaries & Wages Policy\n\nNSF regards research as one of the normal functions of faculty members at institutions of higher education. Compensation for time normally spent on research within the term of appointment is deemed to be included within the faculty member’s regular organizational salary.\n\nAs a general policy, NSF limits the salary compensation requested in the proposal budget for senior personnel to no more than two months of their regular salary in any one year. (See Exhibit II-3 for the definitions of Senior Personnel.) It is the organization’s responsibility to define and consistently apply the term “year”, and to specify this definition in the budget justification. This limit includes salary compensation received from all NSF-funded grants. This effort must be documented in accordance with 2 CFR §200, Subpart E, including 2 CFR §200.430(i). If anticipated, any compensation for such personnel in excess of two months must be disclosed in the proposal budget, justified in the budget justification, and must be specifically approved by NSF in the award notice budget.[14]\n\nUnder normal rebudgeting authority, as described in Chapters VII and X, a recipient can internally approve an increase or decrease in person months devoted to the project after an award is made, even if doing so results in salary support for senior personnel exceeding the two-month salary policy. No prior approval from NSF is necessary unless the rebudgeting would cause the objectives or scope of the project to change. NSF prior approval is necessary if the objectives or scope of the project change.\n\nThese same general principles apply to other types of non-academic organizations.\n\n(b) Administrative and Clerical Salaries & Wages Policy\n\nIn accordance with 2 CFR §200.413, the salaries of administrative and clerical staff should normally be treated as indirect costs (F&A). Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate only if all the conditions identified below are met:\n\n(i) Administrative or clerical services are integral to a project or activity;\n\n(ii) Individuals involved can be specifically identified with the project or activity;\n\n(iii) Such costs are explicitly included in the approved budget or have the prior written approval of the cognizant NSF Grants and Agreements Officer; and\n\n(iv) The costs are not also recovered as indirect costs.\n\nConditions (i) (ii) and (iv) above are particularly relevant for consideration at the budget preparation stage.\n\n(c) Procedures\n\nThe names of the PI(s), faculty, and other senior personnel and the estimated number of full-time-equivalent person-months for which NSF funding is requested, and the total amount of salaries requested per year, must be listed. For consistency with the NSF cost sharing policy, if person months will be requested for senior personnel, a corresponding salary amount must be entered on the budget. If salary and person months are not being requested for an individual designated as senior personnel, they should be removed from Section A of the budget. Their name(s) will remain on the Cover Sheet and the individual(s) role on the project should be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section of the proposal.\n\nFor postdoctoral associates and other professionals, the total number of persons for each position must be listed, with the number of full-time-equivalent person-months and total amount of salaries requested per year. For graduate and undergraduate students, secretarial, clerical, technical, etc., whose time will be charged directly to the project, only the total number of persons and total amount of salaries requested per year in each category is required. Compensation classified as salary payments must be requested in the salaries and wages category. Salaries requested must be consistent with the organization’s regular practices. The budget justification should detail the rates of pay by individual for senior personnel, postdoctoral associates, and other professionals.\n\n(d) Confidential Budgetary Information\n\nThe proposing organization may request that salary data on senior personnel not be released to persons outside the Government during the review process. In such cases, the item for senior personnel salaries in the proposal may appear as a single figure and the person-months represented by that amount omitted. If this option is exercised, senior personnel salaries and person-months must be itemized in a separate statement and forwarded to NSF in accordance with the instructions specified in Chapter II.E.1. This statement must include all of the information requested on the proposal budget for each person involved. NSF will not forward the detailed information to reviewers and will hold it privileged to the extent permitted by law. The information on senior personnel salaries will be used as the basis for determining the salary amounts shown in the budget. The box for \"Proprietary or Privileged Information\" must be checked on the Cover Sheet when the proposal contains confidential budgetary information.[15]\n\n(ii) Fringe Benefits (Line C on the Proposal Budget)\n\nIf the proposer’s usual accounting practices provide that its contributions to employee benefits (leave, employee insurance, social security, retirement, other payroll-related taxes, etc.) be treated as direct costs, NSF award funds may be requested to fund fringe benefits as a direct cost. These are typically determined by application of a calculated fringe benefit rate for a particular class of employee (full time or part-time) applied to the salaries and wages requested. They also may be paid based on actual costs for individual employees if that institutional policy has been approved by the cognizant Federal agency. See 2 CFR §200.431 for the definition and allowability of inclusion of fringe benefits on a proposal budget.\n\n(iii) Equipment (Line D on the Proposal Budget)\n\nEquipment is defined as tangible personal property (including information technology systems) having a useful life of more than one year and a per-unit acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the proposer for financial statement purposes, or $5,000. It is important to note that the acquisition cost of equipment includes modifications, attachments, and accessories necessary to make an item of equipment usable for the purpose for which it will be purchased. Items of needed equipment must be adequately justified, listed individually by description and estimated cost.\n\nAllowable items ordinarily will be limited to research equipment and apparatus not already available for the conduct of the work. General purpose equipment such as office equipment and furnishings, and information technology equipment and systems are typically not eligible for direct cost support. Special purpose or scientific use computers or associated hardware and software, however, may be requested as items of equipment when necessary to accomplish the project objectives and not otherwise reasonably available. Any request to support such items must be clearly disclosed in the proposal budget, justified in the budget justification, and be included in the NSF award budget. See 2 CFR §200.313 and 200.439 for additional information.\n\n(iv) Travel (Line E on the Proposal Budget)\n\n(a) General\n\nWhen anticipated, travel and its relation to the proposed activities must be specified, itemized, and justified by destination and cost. Funds may be requested for field work, attendance at meetings and conferences, and other travel associated with the proposed work, including subsistence. To qualify for support, however, attendance at meetings or conferences must be necessary to accomplish proposal objectives or disseminate research results. Travel support for dependents of key project personnel may be requested only when the travel is for a duration of six months or more either by inclusion in the approved budget or with the prior written approval of the cognizant NSF Grants and Agreements Officer. Temporary dependent care costs above and beyond regular dependent care that directly result from travel to conferences are allowable costs provided that the conditions established in 2 CFR §200.475 are met.\n\nAllowance for air travel normally will not exceed the cost of round-trip, economy airfares. Persons traveling under NSF awards must travel by U.S.-Flag Air carriers, if available.\n\n(b) Domestic Travel\n\nDomestic travel includes travel within and between the U.S., its territories, and possessions.[16] Travel, meal, and hotel expenses of recipient employees who are not on travel status are unallowable. Costs of employees on travel status are limited to those specifically authorized by 2 CFR §200.475.\n\n(c) Foreign Travel\n\nTravel outside the areas specified above is considered foreign travel. When anticipated, the proposer must enter the names of countries and dates of visit on the proposal budget, if known.\n\n(v) Participant Support (Line F on the Proposal Budget)\n\nThis budget category refers to direct costs for items such as stipends or subsistence allowances, travel allowances, and registration fees paid to or on behalf of participants or trainees (but not employees) in connection with NSF-sponsored conferences or training projects. Any additional categories of participant support costs other than those described in 2 CFR §200.1 (such as incentives, gifts, souvenirs, t-shirts, and memorabilia), must be justified in the budget justification, and such costs will be closely scrutinized by NSF. (See also Chapter II.F.7.) Speakers and trainers generally are not considered participants and should not be included in this section of the budget. However, if the primary purpose of the individual’s attendance at the conference is learning and receiving training as a participant, then the costs may be included under participant support. If the primary purpose is to speak or assist with management of the conference, then such costs should be budgeted in appropriate categories other than participant support.\n\nFor some educational projects conducted at local school districts, the participants being trained are employees. In such cases, the costs must be classified as participant support if payment is made through a stipend or training allowance method. The school district must have an accounting mechanism in place (i.e., sub-account code) to differentiate between regular salary and stipend payments.\n\nTo help defray the costs of participating in a conference or training activity, funds may be proposed for payment of stipends, per diem or subsistence allowances, based on the type and duration of the activity. Such allowances must be reasonable, in conformance with the policy of the proposing organization and limited to the days of attendance at the conference plus the actual travel time required to reach the conference location. Where meals or lodgings are furnished without charge or at a nominal cost (e.g., as part of the registration fee), the per diem or subsistence allowance should be correspondingly reduced. Although local participants may participate in conference meals and coffee breaks, funds may not be proposed to pay per diem or similar expenses for local participants in the conference. Costs related to an NSF-sponsored conference (e.g., venue rental fees, catering costs, supplies, etc.) that will be secured through a service agreement/contract should be budgeted on line G.6., “Other Direct Costs” to ensure appropriate allocation of indirect costs.\n\nThis section of the budget also may not be used for incentive payments to research subjects. Human subject payments should be included on line G.6. of the NSF budget under “Other Direct Costs,” and any applicable indirect costs should be calculated on the payments in accordance with the organization’s Federally negotiated indirect cost rate.\n\nFunds may be requested for the travel costs of participants. If so, the restrictions regarding class of accommodations and use of U.S.-Flag air carriers are applicable.[17] In training activities that involve off-site field work, costs of transportation of participants are allowable. The number of participants to be supported must be entered in the parentheses on the proposal budget. Participant support costs must be specified, itemized, and justified in the budget justification section of the proposal. Indirect costs (F&A) are not usually allowed on costs budgeted as participant support unless the recipient’s current, Federally approved indirect cost rate agreement provides for allocation of F&A to participant support costs. Participant support costs must be accounted for separately should an award be made.\n\n(vi) Other Direct Costs (Lines G1 through G6 on the Proposal Budget)\n\nAny costs proposed to an NSF project must be allowable, reasonable, and directly allocable to the supported activity. When anticipated, the budget must identify and itemize other anticipated direct costs not included under the headings above, including materials and supplies, publication costs, and computer and vendor services. Examples include aircraft rental, space rental at research establishments away from the proposing organization, minor building alterations, payments to human subjects, and service charges. Reference books and periodicals only may be included on the proposal budget if they are specifically allocable to the project being supported by NSF.\n\n(a) Materials and Supplies (including Costs of Computing Devices) (Line G1 on the Proposal Budget)\n\nWhen anticipated, the proposal budget justification must indicate the general types of expendable materials and supplies required. Supplies are defined as all tangible personal property other than those described in paragraph (d)(iii) above. A computing device is considered a supply if the acquisition cost is less than the lesser of the capitalization level established by the proposer or $5,000, regardless of the length of its useful life. In the specific case of computing devices, charging as a direct cost is allowable for devices that are essential and allocable, but not solely dedicated, to the performance of the NSF project. Details and justification must be included for items requested to support the project.\n\n(b) Publication/Documentation/Dissemination (Line G2 on the Proposal Budget)\n\nThe proposal budget may request funds for the costs of documenting, preparing, publishing or otherwise making available to others the findings and products of the work to be conducted under the award. This generally includes the following types of activities: reports, reprints, page charges or other journal costs (except costs for prior or early publication); necessary illustrations; cleanup, documentation, storage and indexing of data and databases; development, documentation and debugging of software; and storage, preservation, documentation, indexing, etc., of physical specimens, collections, or fabricated items. Line G.2. of the proposal budget also may be used to request funding for data deposit and data curation costs.[18]\n\n(c) Consultant Services (also referred to as Professional Service Costs) (Line G3 on the Proposal Budget)[19]\n\nThe proposal budget may request costs for professional and consultant services. Professional and consultant services are services rendered by persons who are members of a particular profession or possess a special skill, and who are not officers or employees of the proposing organization. Costs of professional and consultant services are allowable when reasonable in relation to the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of costs from the Federal government. Anticipated services must be justified, and information furnished on each individual’s expertise, primary organizational affiliation, normal daily compensation rate, and number of days of expected service. Consultants’ travel costs, including subsistence, may be included. If requested, the proposer must be able to justify that the proposed rate of pay is reasonable. Additional information on the allowability of consultant or professional service costs is available in 2 CFR §200.459. In addition to other provisions required by the proposing organization, all contracts made under the NSF award must contain the applicable provisions identified in 2 CFR §200 Appendix II.\n\n(d) Computer Services (Line G4 on the Proposal Budget)\n\nThe cost of computer services, including computer-based retrieval of scientific, technical, and educational information, may be requested only where it is institutional policy to charge such costs as direct charges. A justification based on the established computer service rates at the proposing organization must be included. The proposal budget also may request costs for leasing of computer equipment.\n\n(e) Subawards (Line G5 on the Proposal Budget)[20][21]\n\nExcept for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the proposer's own use which creates a procurement relationship with a contractor, no portion of the proposed activity may be subawarded or transferred to another organization without prior written NSF authorization. Such authorization must be provided either through approval specifically granted in the award notice or by receiving written prior approval from the cognizant NSF Grants and Agreements Officer after an award is issued. If the subaward organization is changed, prior approval of the new subaward organization must be obtained from the cognizant NSF Grants and Agreements Officer.\n\nIf known at the time of proposal submission, the intent to enter into such arrangements must be disclosed in the proposal. A separate budget and a budget justification of no more than five pages, must be provided for each subrecipient, if already identified. The description of the work to be performed must be included in the project description.\n\nAll proposing organizations are required to make a case-by-case determination regarding the role of a subrecipient versus contractor for each agreement it makes. 2 CFR §200.331 provides characteristics of each type of arrangement to assist proposing organizations in making that determination. However, inclusion of a subaward or contract in the proposal budget or submission of a request after issuance of an NSF award to add a subaward or contract will document the required organizational determination.\n\nNSF does not negotiate rates for organizations that are not direct recipients of NSF funding (e.g., subrecipients). Consistent with 2 CFR §200.332, NSF recipients must use the domestic subrecipient’s applicable U.S. Federally negotiated indirect cost rate(s). If no such rate exists, the NSF recipient must determine the appropriate rate in collaboration with the subrecipient. The appropriate rate will be: a negotiated rate between the NSF recipient and the subrecipient; a prior rate negotiated between a different pass-through entity and the same subrecipient, or the de minimis indirect cost recovery rate of 10% of modified total direct costs.\n\nIt is also NSF’s expectation that NSF recipients will use foreign subrecipients’ applicable U.S. Federally negotiated indirect cost rate(s). However, if no such rate exists, the NSF recipient will fund the foreign subrecipient using the de minimis indirect cost rate recovery of 10% of modified total direct costs. See also Chapter I.E.2. for additional requirements on issuance of a subaward or consultant arrangement to a foreign organization or a foreign individual.\n\nProposers are responsible for ensuring that proposed subrecipient costs, including indirect costs, are reasonable and appropriate.\n\n(f) Other (Line G6 on the Proposal Budget)[22]\n\nAny other direct costs not specified in Lines G.1. through G.5. must be identified on Line G.6. Such costs must be itemized and detailed in the budget justification. Examples include:\n\nContracts for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the proposer’s own use (see 2 CFR §200.331 for additional information); and\n\nIncentive payments, for example, payments to human subjects or incentives to promote completion of a survey, should be included on line G.6. of the NSF budget. Incentive payments should be proposed in accordance with organizational policies and procedures. Indirect costs should be calculated on incentive payments in accordance with the organization’s approved U.S. Federally negotiated indirect cost rate(s). Performance based incentive payments to employees as described in 2 CFR §200.430(f) should not be included in this section of the budget.\n\n(vii) Total Direct Costs (Line H on the Proposal Budget)\n\nThe total amount of direct costs requested in the budget, to include Lines A through G, must be entered on Line H.\n\n(viii) Indirect Costs (also known as Facilities and Administrative Costs (F&A) for Colleges and Universities) (Line I on the Proposal Budget)\n\nExcept where specifically identified in an NSF program solicitation, the applicable U.S. Federally negotiated indirect cost rate(s) must be used in computing indirect costs (F&A) for a proposal. Use of an indirect cost rate lower than the organization’s current negotiated indirect cost rate is considered a violation of NSF’s cost sharing policy. See section (xii) below. The amount for indirect costs must be calculated by applying the current negotiated indirect cost rate(s) to the approved base(s), and such amounts must be specified in the budget justification. Indirect cost recovery for IHEs is additionally restricted by 2 CFR §200, Appendix III, paragraph C.7. which specifies Federal agencies are required to use the negotiated F&A rate that is in effect at the time of the initial award throughout the life of the sponsored agreement. Additional information on the charging of indirect costs to an NSF award is available in Chapter X.D.\n\nDomestic proposing organizations that do not have a current negotiated rate agreement with a cognizant Federal agency may choose to apply the de minimis rate of 10% to a base of modified total direct costs (MTDC) as authorized by 2 CFR §200.414(f). No supporting documentation is required for proposed rates of 10% or less of modified total direct costs. Organizations without a current negotiated indirect cost rate agreement and that wish to request indirect cost rate recovery above 10% should prepare an indirect cost proposal based on expenditures for its most recently ended fiscal year. Based on the information provided in the indirect cost proposal, NSF may negotiate an award-specific rate to be used only on the award currently being considered for funding or may issue a formally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement (NICRA). The contents and financial data included in indirect cost proposals vary according to the make-up of the proposing organization. Instructions for preparing an indirect cost rate proposal can be found on the NSF website. NSF formally negotiates indirect cost rates for the organizations for which NSF has rate cognizance. NSF does not negotiate rates for entities that do not yet hold direct NSF funding, nor does NSF negotiate rates for subrecipients.\n\nForeign organizations that do not have a current U.S. Federally negotiated indirect cost rate(s) are limited to a de minimis indirect cost rate recovery of 10% of modified total direct costs. Foreign recipients that have a U.S. Federally negotiated indirect cost rate(s) may recover indirect costs at the current negotiated rate.\n\n(ix) Total Direct and Indirect Costs (F&A) (Line J on the Proposal Budget)\n\nThe total amount of direct and indirect costs (F&A) (sum of Lines H and I) must be entered on Line J.\n\n(x) Fees (Line K on the Proposal Budget)\n\nThis line is available for use only by the SBIR/STTR programs and Major Facilities programs when specified in the solicitation.\n\n(xi) Amount of This Request (Line L on the Proposal Budget)\n\nThe total amount of funds requested by the proposer.\n\n(xii) Cost Sharing (Line M on the Proposal Budget)\n\nThe National Science Board issued a report entitled \"Investing in the Future: NSF Cost Sharing Policies for a Robust Federal Research Enterprise\" (NSB 09-20, August 3, 2009), which contained eight recommendations for NSF regarding cost sharing. In implementation of the Board’s recommendation, NSF’s guidance[23] is as follows:\n\nVoluntary Committed and Uncommitted Cost Sharing\n\nAs stipulated in 2 CFR §200.1, Voluntary committed cost sharing means cost sharing specifically pledged on a voluntary basis in the proposal's budget or the Federal award on the part of the non-Federal entity and that becomes a binding requirement of Federal award.” As such, to be considered voluntary committed cost sharing, the amount must appear on the NSF proposal budget and be specifically identified in the approved NSF budget.[24] Unless required by NSF (see the section on Mandatory Cost Sharing below), inclusion of voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited and Line M on the proposal budget will not be available for use by the proposer. NSF Program Officers are not authorized to impose or encourage mandatory cost sharing unless such requirements are explicitly included in the program solicitation.\n\nIn order for NSF, and its reviewers, to assess the scope of a proposed project, all organizational resources necessary for, and available to, a project must be described in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section of the proposal (see Chapter II.D.2.g for further information). While not required by NSF, the recipient may, at its own discretion, continue to contribute voluntary uncommitted cost sharing to NSF-sponsored projects. As noted above, however, these resources are not auditable by NSF and should not be included in the proposal budget or budget justification.\n\nMandatory Cost Sharing\n\nMandatory cost sharing will only be required for NSF programs when explicitly authorized by the NSF Director, the NSB, or legislation. A complete listing of NSF programs that require cost sharing is available on the NSF website. In these programs, cost sharing requirements will be clearly identified in the solicitation and must be included on Line M of the proposal budget. For purposes of budget preparation, the cumulative cost sharing amount must be entered on Line M of the first year’s budget. Should an award be made, the organization’s cost sharing commitment, as specified on the first year’s approved budget, must be met prior to the award end date.\n\nSuch cost sharing will be considered as an eligibility, rather than a review criterion. Proposers are advised not to exceed the mandatory cost sharing level or amount specified in the solicitation.[25]\n\nWhen mandatory cost sharing is included on Line M, and accepted by the Foundation, the commitment of funds becomes legally binding and is subject to audit. When applicable, the estimated value of any in-kind contributions also should be included on Line M. An explanation of the source, nature, amount, and availability of any proposed cost sharing must be provided in the budget justification[26]. It should be noted that contributions derived from other Federal funds or counted as cost sharing toward projects of another Federal agency must not be counted towards meeting the specific cost sharing requirements of the NSF award.\n\nFailure to provide the level of cost sharing required by the NSF solicitation and reflected in the NSF award budget may result in termination of the NSF award, disallowance of award costs and/or refund of award funds to NSF by the recipient.\n\n(xiii) Allowable and Unallowable Costs\n\n2 CFR §200, Subpart E provides comprehensive information regarding costs allowable under Federal awards. The following categories of unallowable costs are highlighted because of their sensitivity:\n\n(a) Entertainment\n\nCosts of entertainment, amusement, diversion and social activities, and any costs directly associated with such activities (such as tickets to shows or sporting events, meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities) are unallowable. When costs typically considered as entertainment are necessary to accomplish the proposed objectives, they must be included in the budget and justified in the budget justification. Travel, meal, and hotel expenses of recipient employees who are not on travel status are unallowable. See also 2 CFR §200.438.\n\n(b) Meals and Coffee Breaks\n\nNo funds may be requested for meals or coffee breaks for intramural meetings of an organization or any of its components, including, but not limited to, laboratories, departments, and centers. (See 2 CFR §200.432, for additional information on the charging of certain types of costs generally associated with conferences supported by NSF.) Meal expenses of recipient employees who are not on travel status are unallowable. See also 2 CFR §200.438.\n\n(c) Alcoholic Beverages\n\nNo NSF funds may be requested or spent for alcoholic beverages.\n\n(d) Home Office Workspace\n\nRental of any property owned by individuals or entities affiliated with NSF recipients (including commercial or residential real estate), for use as home office workspace is unallowable. See 2 CFR §200.465(f).\n\n(e) Prohibition on Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment\n\nSection 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 (Public Law 115-232) prohibits the head of an executive agency from obligating or expending loan or grant funds to procure or obtain, extend, or renew a contract to procure or obtain, or enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure or obtain the equipment, services, or systems as identified in section 889 of the NDAA for FY 2019. See 2 CFR §§200.216, 200.471, PAPPG Chapter X.F, and the applicable award terms and conditions for additional information.\n\nBack to top\n\ng. Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources\n\nThis section of the proposal is used to assess the adequacy of the resources available to perform the effort proposed to satisfy both the Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts review criteria. Proposers should describe only those resources that are directly applicable. Proposers should include an aggregated description of the internal and external resources (both physical and personnel) that the organization and its collaborators, and subawardees will provide to the project, should it be funded. Such information must be provided in this section, in lieu of other parts of the proposal (e.g., Budget Justification, Project Description). The description should be narrative in nature and must not include any quantifiable financial information. Reviewers will evaluate the information during the merit review process and the cognizant NSF Program Officer will review it for programmatic and technical sufficiency.\n\nAlthough these resources are not considered voluntary committed cost sharing as defined in 2 CFR §200.1, the Foundation does expect that the resources identified in the Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources section will be provided, or made available, should the proposal be funded. Chapter VII.B.1 specifies procedures for use by the recipient when there are postaward changes to objectives, scope, or methods/procedures.\n\nBack to top\n\nh. Senior Personnel Documents\n\n(i) Biographical Sketch(es)\n\nNote: The mandate to use SciENcv only for preparation of the biographical sketch will go into effect for new proposals submitted or due on or after October 23, 2023. In the interim, proposers may continue to prepare and submit this document via use of SciENcv or the NSF fillable PDF. NSF, however, encourages the community to use SciENcv prior to the October 2023 implementation.\n\n(a) Senior Personnel\n\nThis section of the proposal is used to assess how well qualified the individual, team, or organization is to conduct the proposed activities. A Biographical Sketch (limited to three pages) must be provided separately for each individual designated as senior personnel through use of SciENcv (Science Experts Network Curriculum Vitae). SciENcv will produce an NSF-compliant PDF version of the Biographical Sketch. Senior personnel must prepare, save, certify, and submit these documents as part of their proposal via Research.gov or Grants.gov.\n\nSenior personnel include the individuals designated by the proposer/awardee organization and approved by NSF who contribute in a substantive, meaningful way to the scientific development or execution of a research and development project proposed to be carried out with a research and development award.[27]\n\nA table entitled, NSPM-33 Implementation Guidance Pre- and Post-award Disclosures Relating to the Biographical Sketch and Current and Pending (Other) Support [28] has been created to provide helpful reference information regarding pre-award and post-award disclosures. The table includes the types of activities to be reported, where such activities must be reported in the proposal, as well as when updates are required in the proposal and award lifecycle. A final column identifies activities that are not required to be reported.\n\nInclusion of additional information beyond that specified below may result in the proposal being returned without review. Do not submit any personal information in the Biographical Sketch. This includes items such as: home address; home telephone, fax, or cell phone numbers; home e-mail address; driver’s license number; marital status; personal hobbies; and the like. Such personal information is not appropriate for the Biographical Sketch and is not relevant to the merits of the proposal. NSF is not responsible or in any way liable for the release of such material. (See also Chapter III.H).\n\nThe format of the Biographical Sketch is as follows:\n\n*= required\n\n(1) Identifying Information\n\n(i) *Name: Enter the name of the senior person (Last name, First name, Middle name, including any applicable suffix).\n\n(ii) ORCID ID[29] (Optional): Enter the ORCID ID of the senior person.\n\n(iii) *Position Title: Enter the current position title of the senior person.\n\n(2) *Organization and Location:\n\n(i) Name: Enter the name of the primary organization of the senior person.\n\n(ii) Location: Enter the City, State/Province, and Country where the primary organization is located.

Examples with multiple components, such as committee member lists, sub-bulleted highlights of honors and prizes, or a listing of organizations for which the individual has served as a reviewer, are not permitted.\n\n(7) *Certification\n\nWhen the individual signs the certification on behalf of themselves, they are certifying that the information is current, accurate, and complete. This includes, but is not limited to, information related to domestic and foreign appointments and positions. Misrepresentations and/or omissions may be subject to prosecution and liability pursuant to, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. §§287, 1001, 1031 and 31 U.S.C. §§3729-3733 and 3802.\n\n(b) Other Personnel\n\nFor the personnel categories listed below, the proposal also may include information on exceptional qualifications that merit consideration in the evaluation of the proposal. While the requirement to use SciENcv for preparation and submission of the biographical sketch is for any individual designated as senior personnel, the biographical information for 'other personnel' may be freeform. The biographical information must be clearly identified as “Other Personnel” biographical information and uploaded as a single PDF file in the Other Supplementary Documents section of the proposal.\n\n(1) Postdoctoral associates\n\n(2) Other professionals\n\n(3) Students (research assistants)\n\n(c) Equipment Proposals\n\nFor equipment proposals, the following must be provided for each auxiliary user:\n\n(1) Short biographical sketch; and\n\n(2) List of up to five publications most closely related to the proposed acquisition.\n\nSuch information should be clearly identified as “Equipment Proposal” biographical information and uploaded as a single PDF file in the Other Supplementary Documents section of the proposal.\n\n(ii) Current and Pending (Other) Support\n\nNote: The mandate to use SciENcv only for the preparation of Current and Pending (Other) Support information will go into effect for new proposals submitted or due on or after October 23, 2023. In the interim, proposers may continue to prepare and submit this document via use of SciENcv or the NSF fillable PDF. NSF, however, encourages the community to use SciENcv prior to the October 2023 implementation.\n\n(a) Current and Pending (Other) Support[30] information is used to assess the capacity of the individual to carry out the research as proposed and helps assess any potential scientific and budgetary overlap/duplication, as well as overcommitment with the project being proposed. Note that there is no page limitation for this section of the proposal, though some fields have character limitations for consistency and equity.\n\n(b) Senior personnel include the individuals designated by the proposer/awardee organization and approved by NSF who contribute in a substantive, meaningful way to the scientific development or execution of a research and development project proposed to be carried out with a research and development award.[31]\n\n(c) Current and Pending (Other) Support must be provided separately for each individual designated as senior personnel through use of SciENcv. SciENcv will produce an NSF-compliant PDF version of the Current and Pending (Other) Support. Senior personnel must prepare, save, certify, and submit these documents as part of their proposal via Research.gov or Grants.gov.\n\n(d) Consistent with NSPM-33, senior personnel are required to disclose contracts associated with participation in programs sponsored by foreign governments, instrumentalities, or entities, including foreign government-sponsored talent recruitment programs[32]. Further, if an individual receives direct or indirect support that is funded by a foreign government-sponsored talent recruitment program, even where the support is provided through an intermediary and does not require membership in the foreign government-sponsored talent recruitment program, that support must be disclosed. Senior personnel must also report other foreign government sponsored or affiliated activity. Note that non-disclosure clauses associated with these contracts are not acceptable exemptions from this disclosure requirement.\n\n(e) A table entitled, NSPM-33 Implementation Guidance Pre- and Post-award Disclosures Relating to the Biographical Sketch and Current and Pending (Other) Support[33]has been created to provide helpful reference information regarding pre-award and post-award disclosures. The table includes the types of activities to be reported, where such activities must be reported in the proposal, as well as when updates are required in the proposal and award lifecycle. A final column identifies activities that are not required to be reported.\n\n(f) Do not submit any personal information in the Current and Pending (Other) support. This includes items such as: home address; home telephone, fax, or cell phone numbers; home e-mail address; driver’s license number; marital status; personal hobbies; and the like. Such personal information is not appropriate for current and pending (other) support and is not relevant to the merits of the proposal. NSF is not responsible or in any way liable for the release of such material.\n\n(g) A separate submission must be provided for each active project/pending proposal as well as in-kind contributions using the format specified below.\n\nThe formats of Current and Pending (Other) Support are as follows:\n\n*= required\n\n(i) Identifying Information\n\n*Name: Enter the name of the senior person (Last name, First name, Middle name, including any applicable suffix).\n\nORCID ID[34] (Optional): Enter the ORCID ID of the senior person.\n\n*Position Title: Enter the current position title of the senior person.\n\n(ii) Organization and Location\n\n*Name: Enter the name of the primary organization of the senior person.\n\n*Location: Enter the City, State/Province, and Country where the primary organization is located.
