For acquisition of lands and easements, boundary descriptions by metes and bounds shall be made and sealed by a licensed surveyor.\n\nSection 402. Adoption of the Official Map and Amendments Thereto.--(a) Prior to the adoption of the official map or part thereof, or any amendments to the official map, the governing body shall refer the proposed official map, or part thereof or amendment thereto, with an accompanying ordinance describing the proposed map, to the planning agency for review. The planning agency shall report its recommendations on said proposed official map and accompanying ordinance, part thereof, or amendment thereto within 45 days unless an extension of time shall be agreed to by the governing body. If, however, the planning agency fails to act within 45 days, the governing body may proceed without its recommendations.\n\n(b) The county and adjacent municipalities may offer comments and recommendations during said 45-day review period in accordance with section 408.

The fee for recording and indexing ordinances and amendments shall be paid by the municipality enacting the ordinance or amendment and shall be in the amount prescribed by law for the recording of ordinances by the recorder of deeds.\n\nSection 403. Effect of Approved Plats on Official Map.--After adoption of the official map, or part thereof, all streets, watercourses and public grounds and the elements listed in section 401 on final, recorded plats which have been approved as provided by this act shall be deemed amendments to the official map. Notwithstanding any of the other terms of this article, no public hearing need be held or notice given if the amendment of the official map is the result of the addition of a plat which has been approved as provided by this act.\n\nSection 404. Effect of Official Map on Mapped Streets, Watercourses and Public Grounds.--The adoption of any street, street lines or other public lands pursuant to this article as part of the official map shall not, in and of itself, constitute or be deemed to constitute the opening or establishment of any street nor the taking or acceptance of any land, nor shall it obligate the municipality to improve or maintain any such street or land. The adoption of proposed watercourses or public grounds as part of the official map shall not, in and of itself, constitute or be deemed to constitute a taking or acceptance of any land by the municipality.\n\nSection 405. Buildings in Mapped Streets, Watercourses or Other Public Grounds.--For the purpose of preserving the integrity of the official map of the municipality, no permit shall be issued for any building within the lines of any street, watercourse or public ground shown or laid out on the official map.

However, when the property of which the reserved location forms a part, cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless a permit shall be granted, the owner may apply to the governing body for the grant of a special encroachment permit to build. Before granting any special encroachment permit authorized in this section, the governing body may submit the application for a special encroachment permit to the local planning agency and allow the planning agency 30 days for review and comment and shall give public notice and hold a public hearing at which all parties in interest shall have an opportunity to be heard. A refusal by the governing body to grant the special encroachment permit applied for may be appealed by the applicant to the zoning hearing board in the same manner, and within the same time limitation, as is provided in Article IX.\n\nSection 406. Time Limitations on Reservations for Future Taking.--The governing body may fix the time for which streets, watercourses and public grounds on the official map shall be deemed reserved for future taking or acquisition for public use. However, the reservation for public grounds shall lapse and become void one year after an owner of such property has submitted a written notice to the governing body announcing his intentions to build, subdivide or otherwise develop the land covered by the reservation, or has made formal application for an official permit to build a structure for private use, unless the governing body shall have acquired the property or begun condemnation proceedings to acquire such property before the end of the year.\n\nSection 407. Release of Damage Claims or Compensation.--The governing body may designate any of its agencies to negotiate with the owner of land under the following circumstances:\n\n(1) whereon reservations are made;\n\n(2) whereon releases of claims for damages or compensation for such reservations are required; or\n\n(3) whereon agreements indemnifying the governing body from claims by others may be required.\n\nAny releases or agreements, when properly executed by the governing body and the owner and recorded, shall be binding upon any successor in title.\n\nSection 408. Notice to Other Municipalities.--(a) When any county has adopted an official map in accordance with the terms of this article, a certified copy of the map and the ordinances adopting it shall be sent to every municipality within said county. All amendments shall be sent to the aforementioned municipalities. The powers of the governing bodies of counties to adopt, amend and repeal official maps shall be limited to land and watercourses in those municipalities wholly or partly within the county which have no official map in effect at the time an official map is introduced before the governing body of the county, and until the municipal official map is in effect. The adoption of an official map by any municipality, other than a county, whose land or watercourses are subject to county official mapping, shall act as a repeal protanto of the county official map within the municipality adopting such ordinance. Notwithstanding any of the other terms or conditions of this section the county official map shall govern as to county streets and public grounds, facilities and improvements, even though such streets or public grounds, facilities and improvements are located in a municipality which has adopted an official map.\n\n(b) When a municipality proposes to adopt an official map, or any amendment thereto, a copy of the map and the proposed ordinance adopting it, or any amendment thereto, shall be forwarded for review to the county planning agency, or if no such agency exists to the governing body of the county at the same time it is submitted for review to the municipal planning agency. The comments of the county planning agency shall be made to the governing body of the municipality within 45 days, and the proposed action shall not be taken until such comments are received. If, however, the planning agency fails to act within 45 days, the governing body may proceed without its comments.\n\n(c) Additionally, if any municipality proposes to adopt an official map, or amendment thereto, that shows any street or public lands intended to lead into any adjacent municipality a copy of said official map or amendment shall be forwarded to such adjacent municipality for review and comment by the governing body and planning agency of the adjacent municipality. The comments of the adjacent municipality shall be made to the governing body of the municipality proposing the adoption within 45 days, and the proposed action shall not be taken until such comments are received. If, however, the adjacent municipality fails to act within 45 days, the governing body of the proposing municipality may proceed without its comments. When a municipality adopts an official map, a certified copy of the map, the ordinance adopting it and any later amendments shall be forwarded, within 30 days after adoption, to the county planning agency or, in counties where no planning agency exists, to the governing body of the county in which the municipality is located. Additionally, if any municipality adopts an official map, or amendment thereto, that shows any street or public lands intended to lead into any adjacent municipality, a certified copy of said official map or amendment shall be forwarded to such adjacent municipality.\n\nARTICLE V\n\nSubdivision and Land Development\n\nSection 501. Grant of Power.--The governing body of each municipality may regulate subdivisions and land development within the municipality by enacting a subdivision and land development ordinance. The ordinance shall require that all subdivision and land development plats of land situated within the municipality shall be submitted for approval to the governing body or, in lieu thereof, to a planning agency designated in the ordinance for this purpose, in which case any planning agency action shall be considered as action of the governing body. All powers granted herein to the governing body or the planning agency shall be exercised in accordance with the provisions of the subdivision and land development ordinance. In the case of any development governed by planned residential development provisions adopted pursuant to Article VII, however, the applicable provisions of the subdivision and land development ordinance shall be as modified by such provisions and the procedures which shall be followed in the approval of any plat, and the rights and duties of the parties thereto shall be governed by Article VII and the provisions adopted thereunder. Provisions regulating mobilehome parks shall be set forth in separate and distinct articles of any subdivision and land development ordinance adopted pursuant to Article V or any planned residential development provisions adopted pursuant to Article VII.\n\n(501 amended June 22, 2000, P.L.495, No.68)\n\nSection 502. Jurisdiction of County Planning Agencies; Adoption by Reference of County Subdivision and Land Development Ordinances.--(a) When any county has adopted a subdivision and land development ordinance in accordance with the terms of this article, a certified copy of the ordinance shall be sent to every municipality within the county. All amendments shall also be sent to the aforementioned municipalities. The powers of governing bodies of counties to enact, amend and repeal subdivision and land development ordinances shall be limited to land in those municipalities wholly or partly within the county which have no subdivision and land development ordinance in effect at the time a subdivision and land development ordinance is introduced before the governing body of the county, and until the municipal subdivision and land development ordinance is in effect and a certified copy of such ordinance is filed with the county planning agency, if one exists.\n\n(b) The enactment of a subdivision and land development ordinance by any municipality, other than a county, whose land is subject to a county subdivision and land development ordinance shall act as a repeal protanto of the county subdivision and land development ordinance within the municipality adopting such ordinance. However, applications for subdivision and land development located within a municipality having adopted a subdivision and land development ordinance as set forth in this article shall be forwarded upon receipt by the municipality to the county planning agency for review and report together with a fee sufficient to cover the costs of the review and report which fee shall be paid by the applicant: Provided, That such municipalities shall not approve such applications until the county report is received or until the expiration of 30 days from the date the application was forwarded to the county.\n\n(c) Further, any municipality other than a county may adopt by reference the subdivision and land development ordinance of the county, and may by separate ordinance designate the county planning agency, with the county planning agency's concurrence, as its official administrative agency for review and approval of plats.\n\nSection 502.1. Contiguous Municipalities.--(a) The county planning commission shall offer a mediation option to any municipality which believes that its citizens will experience harm as the result of an applicant's proposed subdivision or development of land in a contiguous municipality if the municipalities agree. In exercising such an option, the municipalities shall comply with the procedures set forth in Article IX. The cost of the mediation shall be shared equally by the municipalities unless otherwise agreed. The applicant shall have the right to participate in the mediation.\n\n(b) The governing body of the municipality may appear and comment before the governing body of a contiguous municipality and the various boards and commissions of the contiguous municipality considering a proposed subdivision, change of land use or land development.\n\n(502.1 added June 22, 2000, P.L.495, No.68)\n\nSection 503.

Review fees may include reasonable and necessary charges by the municipality's professional consultants for review and report thereon to the municipality. Such review fees shall be based upon a schedule established by ordinance or resolution. Such review fees shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary charges for similar service in the community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the professional consultant for comparable services to the municipality for services which are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants. Fees charged to the municipality relating to any appeal of a decision on an application shall not be considered review fees and may not be charged to an applicant.\n\n(i) The governing body shall submit to the applicant an itemized bill showing work performed, identifying the person performing the services and the time and date spent for each task. Nothing in this subparagraph shall prohibit interim itemized billing or municipal escrow or other security requirements. In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such review fees, the applicant shall, no later than 100 days after the date of transmittal of the bill to the applicant, notify the municipality and the municipality's professional consultant that such fees are disputed and shall explain the basis of their objections to the fees charged, in which case the municipality shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development application due to the applicant's dispute over fees. Failure of the applicant to dispute a bill within 100 days shall be a waiver of the applicant's right to arbitration of that bill under section 510(g).\n\n(ii) In the event that the municipality's professional consultant and the applicant cannot agree on the amount of review fees which are reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the municipality shall follow the procedure for dispute resolution set forth in section 510(g), provided that the arbitrator resolving such dispute shall be of the same profession or discipline as the professional consultant whose fees are being disputed.\n\n(iii) Subsequent to a decision on an application, the governing body shall submit to the applicant an itemized bill for review fees, specifically designated as a final bill. The final bill shall include all review fees incurred at least through the date of the decision on the application. If for any reason additional review is required subsequent to the decision, including inspections and other work to satisfy the conditions of the approval, the review fees shall be charged to the applicant as a supplement to the final bill.\n\n((1) amended Oct. 24, 2012, P.L.1258, No.154)\n\n(1.1) Provisions for the exclusion of certain land development from the definition of land development contained in section 107 only when such land development involves:\n\n(i) the conversion of an existing single-family detached dwelling or single family semi-detached dwelling into not more than three residential units, unless such units are intended to be a condominium;\n\n(ii) the addition of an accessory building, including farm buildings, on a lot or lots subordinate to an existing principal building; or\n\n(iii) the addition or conversion of buildings or rides within the confines of an enterprise which would be considered an amusement park.
