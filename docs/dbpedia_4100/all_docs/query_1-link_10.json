        "text": "NRL-CBD generates more than 61 direct, indirect, and induced jobs as a result of its operati​ons in Chesapeake Beach and the surrounding region.7​ This includes the military, civilian, and contractor employees responsible for carrying out the installation's mission and the employment opportunities generated by local spending on goods and services by the workforce. For a breakdown of employment type by installation, refer to the installation's economic impact analysis sheet.\n\nAccording to the FY 2021 Economic Impact of Maryland's Military Installations and the Associated Defense Ecosystem, prepared by the Maryland Department of Commerce, the annual economic output for N​RL-CBD (sum of direct, indirect, and induced impacts) is $9.8M, with a total employee compensation of $5.3M.8\n\n​\n\nThe Calvert-St. Mary's Metropolitan Planning Organization (C-SMMPO) is the regional Metropolitan Planning Organization responsible for coordinating planning activities and investment decisions related to surface transportation assets (e.g., roads, bridges, transit assets, pedestrian facilities, and bicycle facilities). Roadway congestion, construction, and transportation planning are regional concerns that impact local communities and access to NRL-CBD, potentially affecting employees, service members, and the mission. Communication between the military installation and the C-SMMPO is necessary to ensure an adequate regional transportation infrastructure that supports continued military operations.\n\nThe C-SMMPO's FY21- FY24 Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) includes a description of the schedule for which federal, state, and local funds are distributed for state and local transportation projects within the region.\n\nAdditionally, the FY 2019 – 2022 Maryland Statewide Transportation Improvement Program included a project to replace the MD 261 Fishing Creek bridge, located within one-mile of NRL-CBD. MD-261 serves at the main route into Chesapeake Beach and serves pedestrians, motorists, cyclists, and a variety of marine vessels traveling below. The project was completed in 2019 and required extensive coordination with the Navy, surrounding communities, and the State Highway Administration. Coordination with the Navy included the extension of a Navy pier that was impacted by bridge replacement.\n\n​"
