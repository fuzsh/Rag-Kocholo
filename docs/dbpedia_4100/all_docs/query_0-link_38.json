        "text": "Who owns the world’s nuclear weapons?\n\nDespite progress in reducing nuclear weapon arsenals since the Cold War, the world’s combined inventory of nuclear warheads remains at a very high level: nine countries possessed roughly 12,121 warheads as of early-2024.\n\nCombined, the United States and Russia now possess approximately 88 percent of the world’s total inventory of nuclear weapons, and 84 percent of the stockpiled warheads available for use by the military. Currently, no other nuclear-armed state sees a need for more than a few hundred nuclear weapons for national security, although many of these states are increasing their nuclear stockpiles.\n\nGlobally, the overall inventory of nuclear weapons is declining, but the pace of reductions is slowing compared with the past 30 years. Moreover, these reductions are happening only because the United States and Russia are still dismantling previously retired warheads.\n\nIn contrast to the overall inventory of nuclear weapons, the number of warheads in global military stockpiles – which comprises warheads assigned to operational forces – is increasing once again. The United States is still reducing its nuclear stockpile slowly. France and Israel have relatively stable inventories. But China, India, North Korea, Pakistan and the United Kingdom, as well as possibly Russia, are all thought to be increasing their stockpiles (see map below, click here for higher resolution image):\n\nOf the world’s approximate 12,121 nuclear warheads, roughly 9,585 are in the military stockpiles for use by missiles, aircraft, ships and submarines. The remaining warheads have been retired but are still relatively intact and are awaiting dismantlement). Of the 9,585 warheads in the military stockpiles, some 3,904 are deployed with operational forces (on missiles or bomber bases). Of those, approximately 2,100 US, Russian, British and French warheads are on high alert, ready for use on short notice (see table):\n\nEstimated Global Nuclear Warhead Inventories, 2024\n\nHans M. Kristensen, Matt Korda, Eliana Johns, and Mackenzie Knight, Federation of American Scientists, 2024\n\nThe exact number of nuclear weapons in each country’s possession is a closely held national secret, so the estimates presented here come with significant uncertainty. Most nuclear-armed states provide essentially no information about the sizes of their nuclear stockpiles. Yet the degree of secrecy varies considerably from country to country. Between 2010 and 2018, the United States disclosed its total stockpile size, but in 2019 the Trump administration stopped that practice. In 2020, the Biden administration restored nuclear transparency – a brief victory for nuclear accountability in a democratic country – but then declined to declassify any US stockpile data for 2021, 2022, or 2023. Similarly, in 2021 the United Kingdom announced that it would no longer disclose public figures for its operational stockpile, deployed warhead or deployed missile numbers. Additionally, as of 2024 both the United States and Russia have elected to no longer exchange publicly-available data about their deployed strategic warheads and launchers as mandated by the New START Treaty.\n\nDespite these limitations, however, publicly available information, careful analysis of historical records, and occasional leaks make it possible to make best estimates about the size and composition of the national nuclear weapon stockpiles. For a breakdown of the nuclear warhead categories of the different nuclear-armed states, and for links to more details overviews of each country’s arsenals, see this table:\n\nStatus of World Nuclear Forces, 2024\n\nCountryDeployed StrategicDeployed NonstrategicReserve/NondeployedMilitary Stockpile(a)Total Inventory(b) Russia1,710(c)0(d)2,670(e)4,3805,580 United States1,670(g)100(h)1,9383,708(i)5,044(j) France280n.a.10(k)290290 China24n.a.476500500(l) United Kingdom120n.a.105225225(m) Israel0n.a.909090(n) Pakistan0n.a.170170170(o) India0n.a.172172172(p) North Korea0n.a.505050(q)\n\nTotal(r)~3,804~100~5,681~9,585~12,121\n\nStatus of World Nuclear Forces, 2024\n\nHow to read this table: “Deployed strategic warheads” are those deployed on intercontinental missiles and at heavy bomber bases. “Deployed nonstrategic warheads” are those deployed on bases with operational short-range delivery systems. “Reserve/Nondeployed” warheads are those not deployed on launchers but in storage (weapons at bomber bases are considered deployed). The “military stockpile” includes active and inactive warheads that are in the custody of the military and earmarked for use by commissioned deliver vehicles. The “total inventory” includes warheads in the military stockpile as well as retired, but still intact, warheads in the queue for dismantlement. For additional guidance, see endnotes below (note: as estimates are updated, they may vary from the printed materials below).\n\nIn historical context, the number of nuclear weapons in the world has declined significantly since the Cold War: down from a peak of approximately 70,300 in 1986 to an estimated 12,100 in early-2024. Government officials often characterize that accomplishment as a result of current or recent arms control agreements, but in reality the overwhelming portion of the reduction happened in the 1990s. Some also compare today’s numbers with those of the 1950s, but that is like comparing apples and oranges; today’s forces are vastly more capable.\n\nThe pace of reduction has slowed significantly compared with the 1990s and appears to continue only because of dismantlement of retired weapons; the trend is that the military stockpiles (useable nuclear weapons) are increasing again.\n\nEstimated Global Nuclear Warhead Stockpiles\n\nHans M. Kristensen, Matt Korda, Robert S. Norris, Eliana Johns, and Mackenzie Knight, Federation of American Scientists, 2024\n\nInstead of planning for nuclear disarmament, the nuclear-armed states appear to plan to retain large arsenals for the indefinite future. As such, they are in conflict with the objective and spirit of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nAll continue to modernize their remaining nuclear forces at a significant pace, several are adding new types and/or increasing the role they serve in national strategy and public statements, and all appear committed to retaining nuclear weapons for the indefinite future.\n\nFor an overview of global modernization programs, see our contributions to the SIPRI Yearbook and the Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor. Individual country profiles are available from the FAS Nuclear Notebook in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.\n\nThe information available for each country varies greatly, ranging from the most transparent nuclear weapons state (United States) to the most opaque (Israel). Accordingly, while the stockpile estimate for the United States is based on “real” numbers, the estimates for several of the other nuclear-armed states are highly uncertain.\n\nThese nuclear weapons estimates are produced by Hans M. Kristensen, Matt Korda, Eliana Johns, and Mackenzie Knight of the Federation of American Scientists. Their work is based on the pioneering accomplishments of analysts Thomas Cochran, Robert Norris, and William Arkin, without whom this public service would not be possible.\n\nThis work is made possible through grants from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Future of Life Institute, the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, Longview Philanthropy, the New-Land Foundation, the Prospect Hill Foundation, Ploughshares Fund, and individual donors.
