        "text": "Introduction\n\nRationing and Controlling Prices\n\nDefending the Homefront\n\nWartime Research and Development\n\nWar Work & the Role of Women\n\nAdditional Online Homefront Resources\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe following is a selection of records compiled from the National Archives at Boston that illustrate different aspects of life on the homefront during World War II. More than any war before or since, the federal government was active in numerous ways, both military and civilian, at the regional level and in local communities. How was an entire country mobilized to support a war of such magnitude and to solve all the associated problems that arose? These problems could only be solved at the national level by the federal government, but the programs created had an impact on every community and every individual. Several federal agencies such as the War Manpower Commission and the Office of Price Administration were established specifically to address wartime concerns and ceased to exist soon after. The records presented here relate to four broad themes that had a direct impact on homefront life in New England:\n\n(I) rationing and controlling prices\n\n(II) defending the homefront\n\n(III) wartime research and development, and\n\n(IV) war work and the employment of women\n\nI. Rationing & Controlling Prices\n\nDuring World War II fewer manufactured goods were available because of military needs. A system of rationing and price controls were established to provide resources needed for the war and to avoid the kinds of economic problems that had resulted during World War I, such as high inflation. Government programs for rationing and price controls were administered by the Office of Price Administration (OPA) whose activities were especially important at the local level and affected virtually every household in the United States.\n\nSelected records of the Office of Price Administration, Record Group 188, NARA's Northeast Region, Boston:\n\nMinutes, July 13, 1944 (5 pages), February 5, 1944 (4 pages), New Haven, Connecticut Price and Rationing Board, Records of the War Price and Rationing Boards\n\nRadio Clips to be used during January 1944, Information Division, Records of Region 1 (Boston)\n\n\"Talking about Ration Book Four\", Lawrence J.

Defending the Homefront\n\nProtecting the important northern shipping lanes and guarding against coastal invasion was made even more urgent by the frequent presence of German submarines along the New England coast. A coalition of military and civilian groups carried out patrols in the northern ship lanes, escorted convoys, provided defenses such as mines along the coast, carried out search and rescue operations, investigated submarine sightings, and were prepared to attack the enemy when necessary.\n\nA Navy War Diary:\n\nSelections from Chapter II, Activity and Suspicious Events, April 1944, Northern Group War Diary, April 1944 (13 pages), Monthly War Diaries, Operations Officer, First Naval District, Records of Naval Districts and Shore Establishments, Record Group 181, NARA-Northeast Region (Boston).\n\nIII. Wartime Research and Development\n\nWorld War II saw a greater than ever emphasis on the importance of technology. All of the countries involved raced to develop superior technology, and the U.S. federal government established several top secret research programs that proved vital in the war, the best known of which was the Los Alamos laboratories. Less well-known was the secret project to develop the new radar technology that was established in the Boston area at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The project was officially known as the Radiation Laboratory in order to keep secret its actual purpose. In 1943 a history program was established to document this project and a young historian named Henry Guerlac was hired to guide it. While many of the laboratory records are highly technical, the records of the history office are more accessible to lay readers and provide an intriguing instance of history being recorded as it happened.\n\nSelected records from the Office of Historian, MIT Radiation Laboratory (Cambridge, Massachusetts), Records of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Record Group 227, NARA-Northeast Region (Boston):\n\nLetter, F.W. Loomis, Radiation Lab Associate Director for Personnel, to Henry Guerlac, January 5, 1943\n\nNotes of Henry Guerlac, regarding conversations with different scientists, various dates, 1943-1944\n\nNotes of Henry Guerlac from an interview with Vannevar Bush, Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), August 20, 1944\n\nNotes of Henry Guerlac from an interview with Kenneth Tompkins Bainbridge, May 11, 1943. Bainbridge was later at Los Alamos and oversaw preparations for the first nuclear test\n\nPhotograph of the Receiver Lab, 1941\n\nPhotograph of the Radiation Laboratory Steering Committee at a weekly meeting, 1943\n\nPhotograph of the D-Day invasion on a radar scope, June 6, 1944\n\nPhotograph of Cape Cod on a radar scope, nd\n\nPhotograph of a radar produced at the Rad Lab in use in Germany, February 1945\n\nIV. War Work & the Role of Women\n\nJust as the shortage of manufactured goods was a concern, there was a shortage of civilian labor because of the vast number of men who were in the military. Who would do this work, especially that which was defense related? The federal government and the war industries sought to solve the problem partly by employing women to fill the gap. Records of several agencies reflect the keen interest that was taken in the women who performed what had formerly been men's jobs at many of the federal facilities in New England. The federal government addressed the labor problem by encouraging people to work and restricting the freedom of workers to move from one job to another. Controlling and regulating the supply of labor was the function of the War Manpower Commission.\n\nA.
