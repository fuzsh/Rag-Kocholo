Reading a Chinese novel helps you see and learn a variety of Chinese characters, which not only expands your vocabulary but also demonstrates their structure in sentences.\n\nIt helps retain what you’ve learned. Language learners often forget what they’ve learned as time progresses. If you’re not immersing yourself in the language daily, it can be tricky to recall certain words or phrases. To avoid this, it’s best to pick up a book occasionally and immerse yourself through reading.\n\nIt helps improve your sentence structure. Books provide you with a variety of sentences—narrative, descriptive, informative and conversations. You’ll benefit from reading, and you’ll get a stronger sense of the different ways to position your characters.\n\nIt’s fun and relaxing. There’s nothing more relaxing than reading a book. Grab a copy of the latest novel by your favorite author translated into Mandarin, and have fun learning the language.\n\nYou can do it anywhere, at any time. Whether you’re reading your favorite Chinese novel on your Kindle, on your laptop, or physically holding a book in your hand—reading can be done anywhere, at any time.\n\nTips on How to Learn Chinese Through Books\n\nRead out loud. When you pick up a Chinese book to read, practice pronouncing the characters by reading the text out loud. It not only improves your concentration but also helps you retain what you’ve read.\n\nLook for context clues. Instead of searching for the meaning of the Chinese characters each time you stumble upon an unfamiliar word, look for context clues instead. If the same word keeps reappearing, look it up to confirm its meaning.\n\nThen, find the word in use in other Chinese content, like the videos on FluentU. The more you use new words in use naturally, the better you’ll learn them.\n\nFluentU takes authentic videos—like music videos, movie trailers, news and inspiring talks—and turns them into personalized language learning lessons.\n\nYou can try FluentU for free for 2 weeks. Check out the website or download the iOS app or Android app.\n\nP.S. Click here to take advantage of our current sale! (Expires at the end of this month.)\n\nStick to the Chinese text. Don’t depend on the English translation. The purpose of picking up a Chinese novel is to read the content in its intended language—Chinese—and learn as you’re reading.\n\nRead and reread. Practice makes perfect! It’s such a cliché but still very much applicable to all of us. While reading in a new language may be challenging, it helps you retain information to memory that you’ll be able to recall later. And, it’s all a part of the learning process.\n\nWhether you’re a fiction fan or you prefer non-fiction, there’s something on this list for everyone.\n\nChoose an option or two and enjoy reading some of the best Chinese books of all time!\n\nDownload: This blog post is available as a convenient and portable PDF that you can take anywhere. Click here to get a copy. (Download)\n\nAnd One More Thing...\n\nIf you want to continue learning Chinese with interactive and authentic Chinese content, then you'll love FluentU.\n\nFluentU naturally eases you into learning Chinese language.
