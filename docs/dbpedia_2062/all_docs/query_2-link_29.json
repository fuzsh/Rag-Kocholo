        "text": "Since she won first place in the New Concept national essay contest for high school students, Zhang Yueran has become a remarkable writer. Born in Jinan, Shandong Province, in 1982, she graduated from Shandong Shiyan Senior High School and studied English and law at Shandong University. She is currently majoring in computer science at the National University of Singapore. Through publications such as Mengya and Xinhuawenzhai, her works have made a great impact on the youth literature field. In 2002, the Mengya website praised Zhang as a brilliant writer.\n\nZhang longs to express not only the indulgence of youth and their rebellious tendencies, but more about their thoughts and experiences as they try to realize their dreams. In her novels, she is not resentful of the world or garrulous; she seems neither glossy nor impetuous; she doesn't use any literary tricks. These are all related to her deep thinking.\n\nZhang's published works include Red Shoes (Hong Xie), Ten Tales of Love (Shi Ai) and Oath Bird (Shi Niao).\n\nAccording to Chinese writer Mo Yan, \"The value of Zhang Yueran's novels is to write down the sensitive and blue mood of growing up, reflecting the inner mind of youth.\"\n\n(Translated by WU WENJIA)\n\n√Ç"
