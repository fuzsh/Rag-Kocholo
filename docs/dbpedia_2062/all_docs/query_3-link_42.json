In this video, Julius reads an excerpt in English and I read the same one from the original Chinese text üòä\n\n‚ÄúWriting a letter‚Äù by Ling Shuhua - introduction and translation by Nicky Harman www.shanghailiterary.com\n\nLing Shuhua (1900-1990) was a talented Chinese woman modernist writer, much admired by Chinese luminaries such as the poet Xu Zhimo and the writer and activist Lu Xun. She was also a well-regarded painter. Most of her writing was produced during the 1920s and 1930s, with almost nothing being published thereafter, with the exception of her (English-language) autobiography Ancient Melodies (Hogarth Press, 1953). After the war, she left China and lived in Singapore and the UK and, possibly for that reason, her reputation faded in her home country. Recently, however, her work has been republished there.\n\nTranslation duo reveal the opportunities for UK publishers within Chinese publishing www.thebookseller.com\n\nTwo Sino-Anglo translators ‚Äì one an established and long-serving figure in the scene, the other a fledgling tyro ‚Äì on piloting Chinese books into English and why it helps to be fans of the language first.\n\nJeremy Tiang wins Pen Translates grant to translate Delicious Hunger by Hai Fan www.englishpen.org\n\nThis round of PEN Translates marks ‚Äì and is marked by ‚Äì powerful regional and transnational interconnections. We have five Spanish titles speaking compellingly for the linguistic, cultural and social diversity surging from Central and Latin America; new queer writing in French from Algerian and Cameroonian novelists; two highly mobile Vietnamese feminist mysteries; Arabic fiction from an Egyptian writer living in East London and a Black Sudanese writer living in Austria; the intricacies of language from a d/Deaf perspective; the sensory world of food as experienced by Malayan Communists at war; and two stunning celebrations of the art of the short story in Farsi and Kannada. They showcase the continued invention and ambition of independent publishers and translators, and how the most vivacious and essential current writing is both formally inventive and expansively committed to solidarity.\n\nSinoist has two Dong Xi events coming up www.instagram.com\n\nAt London's Charing Cross Library on Friday 26th July: an exclusive pre-launch event with Dong Xi, author of the upcoming novel 'Fate Rewritten'.‚Å† Hosted by Sinoist editor Susan Trapp, a unique opportunity to meet the author and get a sneak peek into his latest work.\n\nPlease join the Open University and Paper Republic for the 8th session of our Modern Chinese Literature Online Book Club.\n\nBy Nicky Harman, June 24, '24\n\nFriday 12th July, 1-2pm UK time (8-9pm Beijing time).\n\nIn this session, facilitated by Nicky Harman and Emily Jones from Paper Republic, we'll be discussing the story 'Notes from a Consulting Room' by Sophie Zuo Fei (Êò®Èùû) and translated by Dylan Levi King and Yun Qin Wang (ÁéãÈüµÊ≤Å).\n\nYou can read the translation of the story in English here: Read Paper Republic: Notes from the Consulting Room and the Chinese version is available here.\n\nWe are delighted that the author Sophie Zuo Fei (Êò®Èùû) and translator Dylan Levi King will be joining us for the session.\n\nThe book club takes place online using MS teams and is held in English.

It came about because there were a fair number of people who submitted fully-translated pieces for the new Read Paper Republic \"Home\" series. We couldn't choose all of the pieces and decided to offer any whose work had not been chosen the chance to join Nicky Harman and Chen Du for an hour-and-a-half session. It was very informative, with everyone contributing. We discussed specific challenges we had while translating, the business of translation, and where to find additional resources.

Home means something different to each of us, but it means something to all of us. For our next Read Paper Republic series, we're looking for stories of home: of the quest to find one; the struggle to escape one; the battle to defend one. Fiction, non-fiction or poetry: it's all welcome.\n\nIf you are a Chinese>English translator and know of a home-related short story, essay or poems which you really like, we want to hear from you! This publication aims to support emerging translators (translators who haven't published more than one book) and we particularly welcome entries from those new to the profession.\n\nMore‚Ä¶\n\n2023 Roll-Call of Chinese Literature in English Translation\n\nBy Eric Abrahamsen, December 15, '23\n\nHere it is, the 2023 Roll Call of Chinese literature published in English translation!\n\nFirst the good news: this is an interesting and varied collection of titles, including classics, left-fielders, big names, and small(er) names. The non-fiction in particular is a wonderful spread of current events, political topics, and essays.\n\nThe slightly less wonderful news is that there's simply less of it! After several years of steadily-increasing numbers, the shelf shrank a bit this year. Of course it's impossible to know precisely why, but we will note that so much direct cultural contact between China and English-speaking countries has dried up since the pandemic: book fairs canceled, funding dried up, plane tickets expensive.\n\nThere also continues to be a marked gender imbalance: only two female poets in the poetry section; in fiction only 6 women to 16 men.\n\nRegardless, these are great offerings. Special shout-outs to Owlish, which seems to be attracting the genuine love and enthusiasm that we all wish for our books; Jeremy Tiang, who is showing up on so many literary prize lists; and the Sinoist publishing house, which accounts for more than a quarter of the books on the fiction list.\n\nAnd you're still in time for Christmas shopping!\n\nMore‚Ä¶\n\nRedacted Fantasy: China‚Äôs Dystopian Censorship of Online Fiction lacuna.org.uk\n\nChina‚Äôs crackdown on fantasy literature and video games poses a critical obstacle to readers, authors, and those who seek to make these works accessible.

In a sense, it is not at all far-fetched to claim that Chang‚Äôs writing can be read as a unique branch of Chinese literature as world literature.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì E.K.

And then things gradually start to get strange‚Ä¶flourishes of the uncanny begin to appear and the reader is quickly transported further and further away from the book‚Äôs early realist setting into a strange, dark, and increasingly unsettling universe.\n\nREAD PAPER REPUBLIC, A NEW SERIES: CALL FOR STORIES\n\nBy Jack Hargreaves, December 20, '22\n\nPaper Republic is planning a new READ PAPER REPUBLIC, our online publication featuring short fiction (to see previous editions, click here).

But can widowed accountant Su Qin ever publicly acknowledge her socially-mismatched relationship with Ding Bogang, a laid-off manual worker? Can she bear to see her ambitious and studious daughter form a romantic connection with his son? Can her obese son create the perfect family he craves? Will Ding Bogang‚Äôs silly married daughter ever get pregnant?\n\nIn a story about growing up and the complications of family life, two generations of lonely individuals come together against the odds, learning to love as they traverse the long and arduous journey of life.\n\nA Bird Translates Silence www.poetryfoundation.org\n\nWong May represents a middle ground between Pound, with his barely intelligible Chinese, and sinologists with their near-pedantic veracity. As a bilingual poet who can harness her own experience of diaspora and the long afterlives of war and displacement, she offers a lived intimacy that one hopes will become increasingly prevalent in the field of translation. ‚ÄúPoetry lives in the present‚Äîthough it happened in Tang China,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúI do not mean the poem should read like it has just been translated, but like it has just been written.‚Äù\n\nThe Open University (UK) Online Book Club - second session, 18 November 2022\n\nBy Nicky Harman, October 15, '22\n\nThe first session of the book club, held last week, was a great success. 70 + participants from all over the world discussed Yan Ge's short story Sissy Zhong, translated by Nicky Harman, with great enthusiasm.

(It's my favourite season, can you tell?)\n\nIt's been a while since the last instalment of this here newsletter came out, and a lot has happened between those heady dog days of August and now, some of which you might have missed. So wherever there are recordings of events I've included them below. And of course, if there's something that has happened in the world of Chinese lit over the past few months that isn't below, please do send in the article or link and I'll pop it in the list [website only].\n\nThe reason for this is, though you might have been waiting eagerly chewing at the bit for this issue to come out, it is nevertheless going to be the last one for a short while. Probably until early next year, in fact. We enjoy running the newsletter and putting it together, and there has been some lovely feedback about it as a resource, for which we thank you, but we need to rethink how to make it more readily sustainable and maintainable for those of us behind the scenes. In the meantime, a period of rest is in order (instead of a period of procrastination, which is what the last three months have been). We hope you'll stick around and stay subscribed for when the new issue drops into your inboxes come January or February, and if it happens that any of you have any interest in being part of running a newsletter for Chinese literature in translation on a voluntary basis, then be sure to get in touch. The same goes for if you have or know of any news that you think would fit the newsletter, now or anytime in the future; you can always email news AT paper-republic DOT org with anything Chinese-lit-related that you think worth sharing. If it's urgent, and waiting until the next issue would mean missing out, we'll post it straight onto the website and socials (Facebook, WeChat and Twitter for the time being).\n\nAnyway, this issue is review- and release-heavy. So go wonder at all the shiny new books you can spend your hard-earned cash on just in time for Christmas. Oh, and any aspiring or emerging (budding, fledgling, nascent) translators out there with a short piece of fiction or non-fiction about food which you think needs translating or you have lying about in a drawer ready-translated, keep those hungry eyes peeled for a call for submissions in the not-so-distant future.\n\nHappy holidays y'all. Here's to a smashing end of the year (we can dream, eh!).\n\nMore‚Ä¶\n\nNewsletter Issue Fifteen: Eighth Month is Best Month\n\nBy Jack Hargreaves, August 3, '22\n\nHey everyone!
