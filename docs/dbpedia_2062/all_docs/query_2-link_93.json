        "text": "A new monthly series of knowledge-sharing open sessions for literary translators and appreciators of translated works from all backgrounds and experience levels.\n\nMadhu Kaza and Jeremy Tiang will discuss translation as a form of creative writing, even if itâ€™s not always properly acknowledged as such. They will talk about the ways in which working on original fiction, non-fiction, and plays and making translation can mutually inform creative practice.\n\nThe Literary Translation Clinics are held on the third Thursday of the month and are hosted by members of the translator collective, Cedilla & Co. Each one-hour clinic will feature a presentation or conversation followed by a Q&A. Topics will range from questions and theories of craft to submissions, contracts, and other practical concerns, always with an eye to literary translation as a profession. Attendees are encouraged to bring questions from their own practice."
