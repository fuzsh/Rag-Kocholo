        "text": "An anthology of short stories, edited by Li Jingze.\n\n21 st Century Chinese Literature Series, Chinese Literature to the West.\n\nThe theme of this book is \"City\". Recommended works show rich, broad and delicate expressions and grasps of urban life. They all live in major cities in contemporary China. Their writings have evolved from the twin cities of civic literature to the incarnation of multiple cities. Narrating, in its overall form, it forms a polygonal prism that can reflect the mirror image of many cities: from the narrow lanes, alleys, and courtyards, the writer's vision diffuses into the more prosperous sections of the city. The multi-dimensional and developed literary perspective explores the multitude of shaded world conditions in the city, explores the infinite \"charisma\" hidden in the city, and points to the vast expanse of human nature.\n\n21st Century Chinese Literature, a collection of books, chooses scholars and literature critics and other seniors that are active in Chinese contemporary literature research field to be chief editors. They select literature works of different themes, forms and styles that were published in Chinese different mainstream literature publications, newspaper supplements and domestic public offerings around the year 2000. Authors include such famous ones in China’s contemporary literary world as Wang Meng, Tie Ning, Wang Anyi, Chi Zijian and Chen Zhongshi. The collection contains meticulous selection of new works, and provides readings that best reflect the features and developing trend of Chinese contemporary literature in the 21st Century for foreign readers.\n\nContent:\n\nDeng Yiguang\n\nShenzhen is Located at 22°27'-22°52'N\n\nXiao Hang\n\nThe Gift\n\nWang Shou\n\nDeath of a Playboy\n\nHan Song\n\nThe Last Subway\n\nQiu Huadong\n\nFriend of the Moon\n\nZhang Yueran\n\nWeird Auntie\n\nXu Zechen\n\nOutdoor Film\n\nXue Yiwei\n\nThe Taxi Driver\n\nWang Gang\n\nRecollections of the Hunan Cemetery\n\nCai Dong\n\nThe Holiday Monk Returns\n\nChen Qian\n\nComing Downstairs\n\nMei Yi\n\nDreamed to Death\n\nLi Zishu\n\nThe Northern Border\n\nHerausgeber: CVerlag für fremdsprachige Literatur\n\nErscheinungsjahr: 2015"
