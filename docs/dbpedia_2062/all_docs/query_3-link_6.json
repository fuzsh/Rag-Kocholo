        "text": "Political events of the mid-1920s, in which Nationalist, communist, and warlord forces clashed frequently, initiated a shift to the left in Chinese letters, culminating in 1930 in the founding of the Zuoyi Zuojia Lianmeng (“League of Left-Wing Writers”), whose membership included many influential writers. Lu Xun, the prime organizer and titular head throughout the league’s half decade of activities, had stopped writing fiction in late 1925 and, after moving from Beijing to Shanghai in 1927, directed most of his creative energies to translating Russian literature and writing the bitingly satirical random essays (zawen) that became his trademark. Among the many active prewar novelists, the most successful were Mao Dun, Lao She, and Ba Jin.\n\nMao Dun was the prototypical realist. The subjects of his socially mimetic tableaux included pre-May Fourth urban intellectual circles, bankrupt rural villages, and, in perhaps his best-known work, Ziye (1933; Midnight), metropolitan Shanghai in all its financial and social chaos during the post-Depression era.\n\nLao She, modern China’s foremost humorist, whose early novels were written while he was teaching Chinese in London, was deeply influenced by traditional Chinese storytellers and the novels of Charles Dickens. His works are known for their episodic structure, racy northern dialect, vivid characterizations, and abundant humour. Yet it was left to him to write modern China’s classic novel, the moving tale of the gradual degeneration of a seemingly incorruptible denizen of China’s “lower depths”—Luotuo Xiangzi (1936; “Camel Xiangzi,” published in English in a bowdlerized translation as Rickshaw Boy, 1945).\n\nBa Jin, a prominent anarchist, was the most popular novelist of the period. A prolific writer, he is known primarily for his autobiographical novel Jia (1931; The Family), which traces the lives and varied fortunes of the three sons of a wealthy, powerful family. The book is a revealing portrait of China’s oppressive patriarchal society as well as of the awakening of China’s youth to the urgent need for social revolution.\n\nThe 1930s also witnessed the meteoric rise of a group of novelists from Northeast China (Manchuria) who were driven south by the Japanese annexation of their homeland in 1932. The sometimes rousing, sometimes nostalgic novels of Xiao Jun and Xiao Hong and the powerful short stories of Duanmu Hongliang became rallying cries for anti-Japanese youth as signs of impending war mounted.\n\nPoetry of the 1930s underwent a similar politicization, as more and more students returned from overseas to place their pens in the service of the “people’s resistance against feudalism and imperialism.” The lyrical verse of the early Crescent Moon poets was replaced by a more socially conscious poetry by the likes of Ai Qing, Tian Jian, and Zang Kejia that appealed to the readers’ patriotic fervour. Others, particularly those who had at first gravitated toward the Crescent Moon Society, began striking out in various directions: notable works of those authors include the contemplative sonnets of Feng Zhi, the urbane songs of Beijing by Bian Zhilin, and the romantic verses of He Qifang. Less popular but more daring were Dai Wangshu and Li Jinfa, poets published in Xiandai (“Contemporary Age”), a Shanghai literary magazine. The latter wrote very sophisticated, if frequently baffling, poetry in the manner of the French Symbolists.\n\nWhile fiction reigned supreme in the 1930s, as the art of the short story was mastered by growing numbers of May Fourth writers and novels were coming into their own, probably the most spectacular advances were made in drama, largely through the efforts of a single playwright. Although realistic social drama written in the vernacular had made its appearance in China long before the 1930s, primarily as translations or adaptations of Western works, it did not gain a foothold on the popular stage until the arrival of Cao Yu, whose first play, Leiyu (1934; Thunderstorm), a tale of fatalism, retribution, and incestual relations among members of a rich industrialist’s family, met with phenomenal success. It was followed over the next several years by other critically and popularly acclaimed plays, including Richu (1936; Sunrise) and Yuanye (1937; Wilderness), all of which examined pressing social issues and universal human frailties with gripping tension and innovative dramaturgy. Political realities in future decades would force a steady decline in dramatic art, so that Cao Yu’s half dozen major productions still stand as the high-water mark of modern Chinese theatre. Yet, even though movies, television, and other popular entertainments would weaken the resiliency of this literary form, it would still serve the nation as an effective propaganda medium, particularly during the war of resistance.\n\nThe war years: 1937–49\n\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), most writers fled to the interior, where they contributed to the war effort by writing patriotic literature under the banner of the Zhonghua Quanguo Wenyijie Kangdi Xiehui (“All-China Anti-Japanese Federation of Writers and Artists”), founded in 1938 and directed by Lao She. All genres were represented, including reportage (baogao wenxue), an enormously influential type of writing that was a natural outgrowth of the federation’s call for writers to go to the countryside and the front lines. Literary magazines were filled with short, easily produced and adaptable plays, topical patriotic verse, and war-zone dispatches. Among the major writers who continued to produce work of high quality during this period were Ba Jin, Cao Yu, and Mao Dun. The short stories and novels that Sha Ding wrote in the late 1930s and mid-1940s also received acclaim from fellow writers. Ding Ling’s fictional explorations of the female psyche and the social condition of women had caught the public’s imagination in the 1920s, and in the late 1930s she established herself as the major literary figure in the communist stronghold of Yan’an. Another female writer of note at the time was Zhang Ailing (Eileen Chang), whose career as a writer began in occupied Shanghai and whose fiction featured exquisite narratives and a sense of coming destruction.\n\nThe growing dissatisfaction of intellectuals with the Nationalist government in Chongqing surfaced dramatically during the civil war that raged throughout China following Japan’s surrender, ending with the Nationalists’ retreat to Taiwan and the establishment in October 1949 of the People’s Republic of China. Most writers, feeling intense pride and welcoming the challenge, chose to remain on the mainland and serve the new government."
