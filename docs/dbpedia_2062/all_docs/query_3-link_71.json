        "text": "When reading and translating, I’ve often wondered about Chinese narrative. I knew from reading with my own children how important storytelling is for credibility and engagement, even at a very young age. How do English and Chinese narrative styles impact on us, consciously or sub-consciously? How does narrative style affect our reading and appreciation of translations? Sabina Knight is Professor of Chinese and Comparative Literature, Program in World Literatures, at Smith College, and an expert on Chinese narrative. We are delighted that she agreed to an interview with us. Thank you, Professor Knight!\n\nPlease tell us about yourself. What would you like our readers to know about you?\n\nA fascination with Chinese philosophy led me to study Chinese in college. Back then learning Chinese was rare. After an intensive year-long course, in 1986 I studied in Taipei and then at Beijing Normal University. Along with Chinese and Classical Chinese, I also learned French and Russian and studied in France and Russia. In graduate school at Berkeley, Madison, and National Taiwan University, I especially loved early Chinese poetry and modern fiction. I have been teaching at Smith College for twenty-five years, and I’m still passionate about both classical and modern literature.\n\nI have always spent a lot of time walking, and hiking in the woods. I also love to practice yoga, dance, draw, and paint watercolors.\n\nWe know you best from your Very Short Introduction. Could you tell us how you came to write this book?\n\nChinese Literature: A Very Short Introduction was a genuine labor of love. I was thrilled when Oxford University Press invited me to write for their popular Very Short Introduction (VSI) Series. (The series had by then already sold more than five million copies.) The book offered a unique opportunity to reach a broad readership.\n\nWriting the VSI inspired me to share ideas that had intrigued me for decades. The “Very Short” series has a strict limit of 35,000 words, and I wanted to make every paragraph count. I decided to weave together my most meaningful insights from my readings and projects underway. Earlier I had imagined writing full-length articles on many of the subjects in the book. (I had piles of notes, annotated articles, and works in progress.) Condensing the heart of each project into one or two key insights felt like collecting gold dust. As I wrote and rewrote the book, I felt like an explorer charting paths for readers to journey on their own. (I described some of the challenges I faced in “Writing Chinese Literary History: A Tweet for Sore Eyes.”)\n\nYou’ve also written about narrative. Could you tell us about your first book?\n\nI wrote The Heart of Time over ten years. I wanted to explore how different types of narratives allowed for greater or lesser degrees of freedom. Even earlier, already by college, I had the sense that Chinese fiction dealt with moral responsibility in ways very different from European and American literature.\n\nChina’s twentieth century was so tumultuous and painful; yet, many critics denigrated the fiction specifically because they felt that circumstances crushed the characters. Yet I was struck by the many stories and novels that still allowed the characters some degree of freedom. So I first set out to write about free will and determinism in fiction of the 1980s and 90s. How do stories depict struggles for and against freedom? Reading with attention to this question unleashed the power of Chinese fiction. My passion for larger questions emboldened me to treat the entire twentieth century in my Ph.D. dissertation, the first version of the book.\n\nAfter I started teaching at Smith College, the pressure to publish to earn tenure made writing more fraught for me. Thank goodness Harvard gave me a postdoctoral fellowship to focus on my book. That year I developed my ideas through conversations with colleagues, lectures, and workshops. I also read furiously. I reconceived the book as The Heart of Time: Moral Agency in Twentieth-Century Chinese Fiction.\n\nCould you say a little more about narrative in Chinese fiction? Is your work the first to look at narrative in Chinese fiction? Are there narrative styles that are really engrained?\n\nIt’s fun to compare ways different cultures have told stories. In the case of China, we’re already talking about many diverse cultural traditions. The area we now call China may have had as many forms of storytelling as all of Europe. The earliest writings date back three thousand years, and the development of narrative fiction owed a lot to border crossings with other traditions, such as Buddhist themes and forms from India, for example.\n\nMore broadly, narrative often served to support specific political interests, to promote faith in an ordered universe, and to cultivate moral virtues. Scholars delve into historical narratives as much as they study fiction. So both my books are indebted to earlier scholarship on Chinese narrative. It’s often difficult to draw lines between fiction and other early genres. Much history, unofficial history, and “records of the strange” purported to record events, rather than to invent stories, even though many of these writings later came to be seen as fiction.\n\nThe conscious crafting of fiction came quite a bit later, with clear examples by the fourth century and solidifying by the seventh century or so. Both before and after that time many narratives developed by accretion, rather than as the work of a single author. Other stories follow conventions of oral storytelling, or the conceit that the narrator has heard the tale from a witness. These forms, among others, have endured into the twentieth and even twenty-first century.\n\nHave Chinese narrative styles changed in the 21st century?\n\n21st-century Chinese narrative has, not surprisingly, exploded in new ways on the web. Many authors still write serious fiction in the realist, modernist, and other traditions of the twentieth century and earlier, though the degree of self-censorship has been steadily rising. Online writers often produce content so quickly that the censors can’t keep up, at least not right away. Authorities do often later take down or lock much offending content. (The government prefers realist fiction that tells the “China Story” in a good light.)\n\nThe most popular online writers have enormous followings, especially authors that post every day, often for years. One of the longest serialized novels is already about 33 times as long as Tolstoy’s War and Peace. To be commercially successful, online writers both follow formulas and respond to their readers in a speedy feedback loop that creates increasingly addictive serial narratives. Popular genres include journalistic diaries, martial arts novels, romance fiction (including same-sex), crime fiction, sci-fi, and fantasies.\n\nNarrative styles have to be suited to episodic snippets read on smartphones, and the literary merit of these narratives varies. The industry has eliminated editors and other traditional gatekeepers, but its populist market mechanism has attracted unprecedented numbers of both writers and readers. Many Chinese producers also repurpose online fiction for broadcast TV and web video series.\n\nOn your staff page, it says you seek to bring Chinese literature to wider audiences. In the past, I’ve heard English readers say that Chinese fiction doesn’t satisfy them, and Chinese people say that English readers don’t appreciate the subtlety of Chinese writing. I suspect that some of these responses relate to expectation: to storytelling techniques, narrative style, tension, tempo and so on. I’m curious to know what you think about Chinese narratives in translation.\n\nI wrote both my books to help English readers appreciate Chinese literature more. I still see three main roadblocks: available translations, cultural knowledge, and differing expectations about freedom.\n\nFirst, for a long time, a major bottleneck was the paucity of translations. Publishers were wary that Chinese fiction wouldn’t sell well. For decades it was a vicious cycle. What translators and publishers chose to promote also played a role, as did the quality of some translations. Many chose sensational works, or works that promised a window on China’s politics. Thus many excellent works never made it into English translation. (I give a talk, “What Americans See: Chinese Fiction in English Translation,” partly published in Chinese as《美国人眼中的中国小说: 论英译中文小说》.)\n\nUntil fairly recently some translators turned away from fidelity or “equivalent effect,” towards cutting, editing, or rewriting to please publishers. In some cases translators have re-written or asked authors to rewrite endings, titles, and other elements of Chinese novels. Some of these choices impose Western literary practices on the Chinese works. And despite enormous readerships in China, English-language markets play a role in determining the form and fate of Chinese fiction. Luckily, we now have many more translators, more representative works, and more faithfulness to the originals. Still, translators and publishers have to confront many misconceptions about China. Dilemmas remain. How do we weigh choices to translate well-known versus lesser-known authors? What about representing women or ethnic minority writers?\n\nSecond, it doesn’t help that many English readers have little background in Chinese culture. Laying some foundations and offering historical context were among my goals in writing Chinese Literature: A Very Short Introduction. In traditional Chinese understandings, literature, history, and thought are parts of a whole. So my book discusses philosophical foundations; poetry and poetics; and the development of classical narrative. It also explores vernacular fiction and drama, and finally literature from the Opium Wars to the contemporary period.\n\nThird, a deeper question is why English readers have found a lot of modern Chinese fiction demoralizing. I wrote The Heart of Time in part to advocate for this fiction in the face of negative reactions among English readers. For a long time many readers bemoaned that modern Chinese fiction was “depressing.” It’s not surprising, given the horrors of war, poverty, and repression in twentieth-century China. Critics have complained that the bleak narratives utterly crush the characters, leaving scant room for free will.\n\nYet many modern Chinese writers have made moral responsibility a central theme, and moral agency depends on freedom. Against deterministic worldviews, by 1917 many writers sought to create works based on the revolutionary principle that people can be the architects of their own fortunes. Yet even in works of this period many readers perceive a pervasive helplessness.\n\nThe moral power of Chinese fiction becomes clearer in light of Chinese ethics. Much traditional Chinese philosophy takes circumstances–aspects of “fate”–as more limiting than many English readers are used to. Yet that perspective still leaves room for maneuver. In The Heart of Time I discuss narrative techniques which indicate that events were not predetermined. Showing that things could have evolved in multiple ways depends crucially on a narrative’s handling of time. Rather than foreclosing freedom, twentieth-century Chinese fiction opens new perspectives on moral agency.\n\nFinally, would you tell us about your own childhood reading? Any books you particularly liked, any people or places you particularly associate with your early reading?\n\nAs a very little girl, among children’s books I liked The Story about Ping with Kurt Wiese’s illustrations. Ping is a duckling who lives with his extended duck family on a boat on China’s Yangtze River. He’s a very sympathetic character. One evening he accidentally runs away and decides to make an adventure of it. He visits with worldly cormorants, the hardworking birds who catch fish for their owners. Later he climbs aboard another boat and escapes becoming dinner only because a boy sets him free. Throughout he’s curious about the world, feisty, and brave. Still, the following evening he runs home happy to reunite with his family.\n\nA little later I loved reading Louisa May Alcott’s books, Little Women, Little Men, Jo’s Boys . . . . Then, when I was 12, I read Jane Eyre. I was entranced, though later I realized that I had missed a lot of plot subtleties. The novel nevertheless launched me on reading more nineteenth-century British fiction, and then Russian novels too. In high school I turned to American fiction. I also took French and started reading short French fiction.\n\nMy first real exposure to Chinese was to the Daoist classic, the Daodejing. When I was in high school my stepfather had a large-format edition with mysterious Chinese calligraphy superimposed on starkly beautiful black-and-white nature photos. English translations were on facing pages, and I was enthralled by both the aesthetics and the philosophy. (That edition was translated by Gia-fu Feng and Jane English, who used the romanization Lao Tsu’s Tao Te Ching.) The book made me want to study classical Chinese philosophy, though I had no idea how difficult it would be to learn modern and then Classical Chinese.\n\nFollow Sabina Knight on\n\nTwitter/X: @sabinaknight1 and @SangBina\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/sabina.knight1/\n\nEvery year, the children’s literature experts at the International Youth Library, Munich, make a selection of especially noteworthy books from the large number of review and donation copies the library receives in the course of the year.

Age: 4+. 42 pp. ISBN 978-981-18-6225-0 — Disguise | Prejudice | Stereotype | Friendship | Picture book\n\nSummary: A big, bad hairy wolf disguises himself as a sheep to research the habits of his favourite source of food, while a young sheep, disguised as a wolf, sets out to spy on her archenemies. When they meet along the way, they are so taken with each other that\n\nboth forget they are in disguise. Abandoning their missions, they decide to explore the world together. Their friendship remains unshakable, even when, one day, they hang out their fake furs to dry after a swim and see each other in their true forms. This ostensibly simple story about a friendship – illustrated in cheerful, anarchic images and sprawling childish writing – also addresses discrimination and racism: wolf and sheep can only become friends if they look beyond appearances and are not guided by prejudice toward their “enemies”. Singaporean designer and animator Josef Lee, who has won over twenty international design awards and published his first picture book in 2017, believes that picture books are\n\nan ideal way to introduce social issues to children.

ISBN 978-626-7118-33-7 — Loss | Remembrance | Climate change | Post-apocalypse | Dystopia | Picture book\n\nSummary: In a surreal, dreamlike scene, a diver explores a magical, soundless space where time stands still – a flooded city where streetlights are still on, cars are stuck in traffic and a pet bowl sits on a living room floor. He passes through submerged industrial ruins and a deforested wasteland over which whales pass by, before emerging onto a tiny remaining island. Pale blue textless pages alternate with pages in smudged yellow, where images depict a dog frantically talking to the silent diver, who obviously cannot perceive him. These are the memories that the sole survivor of a climate disaster has of his beloved pet, which are interwoven with the present reality of a post-apocalyptic world. Egretllu received the Best Book Illustration Award at the 43rd Golden Tripod Awards in 2019 for his graphic novel Hua shuo Bao Chun jie de zahuodian 話說寶春姐的雜貨店 (Talking about Sister Bao Chun‘s grocery store in pictures), published under his real name, Xu Minghong 徐銘宏.

(Series: Xinyi tuhuashu jiang) 26 pp. ISBN 978-986-161-696-4 — Rumour | Truth | Folk tale | Reversible book | Picture book\n\nSummary: An ox tells the farm dog that he is exhausted after a hard day’s work. The news spreads quickly, but each time it becomes exaggerated when passed on to another farm animal, each of which is depicted as a dark silhouette against a glowing evening sky. When\n\nthe farmer receives the news that the disgruntled ox is looking for a new owner, he feels betrayed and scolds the ox vehemently. A completely different story unfolds when you turn the book around 180 degrees: the farmer investigates the situation and the ox is granted a day of rest. A vivid depiction of the harm caused by false rumours, Niu yan fei yu is based on the fable Chuan yan 传言 (Rumour) by Xu Can 许蚕 (Xu Lingdong 许令东, b. 1974), which was published in a supplement of the Xi’an wanbao 西安晚报 (Xi’an Evening News) in 2000. Distributed in many versions on the Internet, it had already become a “classic folk tale” when advertising designer Qi Wei adapted it for his beautiful picture book. It received the Outstanding Work Award in the category Picture Book at the 11th Hsin Yi Picture Book Award in 2021.

Formosan clouded leopard | Extinction | Museum | Non-fiction | Picture book | Bilingual book\n\nSummary: Intrigued by the sight of a Formosan clouded leopard’s skin, British diplomat Robert Swinhoe (1836-1877) started to search for the mysterious animal, which plays an important role in the mythology of the indigenous Ngudradrekai and Paiwan peoples. In\n\nthe course of his quest, he collected more than 700 animal species, but left Taiwan without ever seeing a single living leopard. Over a hundred years later and after more than one decade of searching, naturalist Chiang Po-jen declared the species extinct. The stuffed specimen in the National Taiwan Museum seems to be the only remaining Formosan clouded leopard, although alleged sightings keep being reported. Attentive readers will enjoy the game of hide-and-seek that Tsou stages in this non-fiction book introducing several other species that are endemic to Taiwan. Tsou’s artworks in his distinctive retro-futuristic, surrealistic style have won various international awards. “Hide-and-seek” was selected for the BRAW [Bologna Ragazzi] Amazing Bookshelf 2023.

We wondered how things have developed over the past two to three years. Thank you, Kate, for this second interview!\n\nHi Kate, it’s a while since our last interview. How has your teaching been over the past two to three years?\n\nOver the past two years I have been teaching a wider range of levels and qualifications, including the Mandarin Excellence Programme, HSK 3 (Chinese Proficiency Test Level III) and A Level Chinese, which has been really enjoyable and has also taught me a lot too. I have had to think about how to teach Chinese literature, and how to explain different writing techniques to my students. Getting native English students to write essays in Chinese on the chosen text was new to me and I have had to think of ways to make lessons interesting and how to make progress in writing. It has also made me think about the different ways in which the UK and Chinese qualifications are tested. The HSK exam has very different requirements to the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education), such as the candidate is given mixed up characters with which they have to form a sentence, or the sentence will have a character missing and the candidate has to fill it in. Whereas the GCSE does not have these ‘puzzle’ elements.\n\nI am still buying Chinese children’s books, but have diversified into graded readers, such as 小羊上山 [Little Sheep Graded Learning] and Odanata Readers. The 小羊上山 series has colourfully illustrated picture books which come in 4 levels and within each level are graded 1-10. They have a list of characters at the back of each book which the child will need to know before attempting to read the book. There is no pinyin so the child needs to be able to read the characters from memory. That suits us at home at the moment as I have not introduced pinyin to my daughter yet.\n\nI have one book from Odanata Readers which comes in a different format from 小羊上山. It is a single book called 读故事学认字：首100字 [Learn characters by reading stories: the first 100 characters]. It comes with flashcards and is a story about two friends called Lili and Mingming. The book has pinyin as a guide and also has writing exercises and games spread throughout the story. We have not started it yet, and I am hoping to tackle it over the summer holidays.\n\nWe also have a ‘Luka’ reading robot in the form of an owl, which I got sent over from Singapore. You can put almost any Chinese children’s book in front of it and Luka will read it out loud. The child turns the pages and listens to the story. I thought it would be good for my daughter to hear someone else speaking Chinese, apart from me. However, we haven’t used it that much as her Chinese is not at a level where she enjoys sitting and listening to a story on her own. She does enjoy playing the app ‘Maomi Stars’ on my phone, on which you have to trace characters, pick the correct character from a group and also say the characters in order to win cupcakes. I’m not sure if she knows what the characters mean but it is still a great app for learning. Since joining Instagram (kt_mandarin) I have discovered a whole community of parents going through the journey of teaching their children Chinese and have found many useful websites, books, gadgets, apps and ideas along the way.\n\nHow is teaching your daughter Chinese at home going? How are you doing this? Can she read independently yet? Or do you read together? Or both? What have you found that works particularly well with you and your daughter? Or that you and your daughter particularly like?\n\nTeaching a non-native 5 year old how to read Chinese is a new challenge for me. There is no external input from her school or family members, so it is all down to me. For reading specifically, I started with 四五快读 [Quick, Read!], which is a series of 8 textbooks which introduce basic characters to young learners and gradually builds up to long sentences and stories, which the child should be able to read. I took characters from the first few chapters and made games/activities for my daughter to become familiar with them. These games included: rolling a dice and saying the corresponding character, writing in rice or sand and using mini white boards or chalk on the ground to practise characters. The book was a good place to start, as you can feel lost with which characters to teach first. However, she didn’t feel any sense of achievement from the book, which is more like a text book, so we tried 小羊上山 graded readers. She enjoyed the pictures and stories in these books and actively wanted to read them. There is a certificate at the end which she wanted to tear out once she had completed the book. I have looked ahead at the next few books and I am incorporating the new vocabulary in our daily life in preparation.\n\nCould you tell us about your favourite books? Ones that you and your daughter enjoy reading?\n\nMy daughter likes the very simple books with only one word per page. I think she finds these manageable, whereas if I read a storybook to her, the sounds do not register and she becomes bored and doesn’t want to listen. To get to a middle ground, I have bought pop-up books which engage her interest and let her see the book as more than just reading. There are some beautiful pop-up books available, and I have found them in a variety of places; second hand Chinese book groups on Facebook, Deziremi.co.uk, and Vinted. I have also bought books that speak. You can press a button and let it read a story or say vocabulary without you having to make the effort. These I have got from Usbourne and Hantastic Kids.\n\nKate Titmuss holds The Three Character Classic and Standards for Being a Good Student and Child\n\n三字经 The ‘Three Character Classic’ is a classic Chinese text written in the 13th century which is still taught to children in China today. Verses have three characters each and are used to teach children common characters, grammar structures, elements of Chinese history and the basis of Confucian morality.\n\n弟子规 translates to ‘Standards for Being a Good Student and Child’ and is another classic text taught to children in China, emphasising Confucian beliefs that a good person ‘should show filial piety at home and respect people outside, behave prudently and trustfully, love all universally, and draw close to sages’.\n\n我们的中国 [Our China] shows different regions in China and their places of interest, food and cultural highlights, by using pop up pictures or tabs which lift up.\n\n我们的身体 [Our Bodies] This book was originally written in French (Le grand livre animé du corps humain, by Pascale Hedelin, illustrated by Robert Barborini, 2019). It is so fun to read and features many moving parts on topics such as the digestive system, the five senses, childbirth, sunburn, getting ill and the circulatory system.\n\n小羊上山 [Little Sheep Graded Readers] This is a set of graded readers, the ones pictured are the first two in the series. They feature simple characters which make up short stories. At the back of each book are flashcards, short exercises and a certificate.\n\nThe Little Sheep Graded Readers have a certificate at the end of the book!\n\n读故事学认字 This book follows the friends Lili and Mingming and also have activities for the child to do throughout. It comes with a set of flashcards.\n\nYou’re also teaching at secondary and A-level. Can you tell us more about how Chinese is taught at these levels in the U.K.?\n\nI have been teaching non-native students, whose mother tongue is English. They all did very well in their GCSEs, but the jump to A Level is huge, and a lot of work needs to be done in order to get through a Chinese work of literature and be able to write an essay about it in Chinese. There are very few resources to help with the teaching of this course, so teachers need to be creative and come up with their own ideas. The book we read was ‘A Very Special Pigeon’. We made storyboards to illustrate the plot, acted out scenes from the book and did ‘close reading’ of the most significant parts of the story, where we analysed the vocabulary and language used at a detailed level. Students need to be familiar with writing styles used in the book, such as metaphor 比喻, comparison 对比 and personification 拟人, so these need to be pointed out and discussed too. The literature element of the A Level was only introduced in 2018, with the first A Level examination being taken in 2020, so past papers and exam feedback are thin on the ground.\n\nThe books on the A Level syllabus are; A Very Special Pigeon 《一个叫凤的鸽子》by Cao Wenxuan 曹文轩, Old Memories of Beijing《城南旧事》by Lin Haiyin 林海音 and Hometown《故乡》by Lu Xun 鲁迅. The vast majority of schools teach A Very Special Pigeon as it is a book written for teenagers in China and thought to be the most relatable and most easily accessible. This is the book we studied. Most students gave a lukewarm response to it and didn’t find it particularly captivating, but nor did they dislike it.\n\nI have also taught Old Memories of Beijing to native Chinese students. The book is a collection of short stories, and we are required to read 《惠安馆》 and 《爸爸的花儿落了》. I prefer these two stories because the book is considered a classic in China and many native Chinese students have read it at school before and are already familiar with it. The vocabulary is more difficult, but I enjoyed the story much more than A Very Special Pigeon. There is also a film about 《惠安馆》 which is a huge help as it helps to visualise the book in the time and place it was set – 1920s Beijing. As for Hometown, it is on my reading list and I am looking forward to reading it.\n\nFor both age groups, is there anything that you wish for that would make your teaching easier, or more enjoyable?\n\nFor young children I think there are plenty of fantastic resources to keep you busy, and sometimes it can be overwhelming to know which ones to use. There is a wide variety of books, activity sheets, online lessons, Chinese language schools, videos, apps and gadgets to help you on your learning journey, the downside would be the cost! Your average Chinese picture book is around £8-10 and online lessons can be around the same price for 45 minutes, whereas you can borrow an infinite number of English books from the library for free.\n\nAs for the A Level, I wish there was a film adaptation of A Very Special Pigeon. Some of my students have never been to China, so I think a film would help them visualise what a Chinese village would look like. As well as this, it would be great to be able to compare such a film with the book as an additional dimension. In addition to that, a revision guide or textbook would be invaluable. These are readily available for the literature works studied in French, German and Spanish, and this is something that is lacking for Chinese.\n\nChristina Matula’s Holly-Mei series was launched at the end of April with the first book The Not-So-Uniform Life of Holly-Mei. The second book The Not-So-Perfect Plan will be out soon. This is great news for fans of Holly-Mei, and wonderful for readers who like series of books. We’re delighted that Christina agreed to do an interview with us. We particularly like her comment that the Holly-Mei books are for everyone.\n\nThe Not-So-Uniform Life of Holly-Mei, by Christina Matula, illus. Yao Xiao (Harlequin, 2023). ISBN 978-1335428653)\n\nHi Christina, please tell us about yourself. What would you like our readers to know about you?\n\nI’m a Canadian children’s author of mixed Taiwanese-Hungarian heritage. As a child of immigrant parents, I’ve always been curious about other cultures and far-off places, which led me to live abroad, firstly in the UK then in Hong Kong. After moving to Hong Kong, I took the opportunity to learn Mandarin – a personal goal of mine – and it was there that I was able to really lean into my Chinese cultural heritage. Learning the language opened up the world of Chinese mythology, fables, and folktales, and made me passionate about sharing them. I had first heard the tale of Hou Yi and Chang’e, the archer and the Moon Lady [see post no. 4], in my daughter’s Chinese lesson, and I went looking for a book in English about it. I couldn’t find one, so I decided to write it myself, which became my first book, the picture book The Shadow in the Moon, about the legend behind the Mid-Autumn Festival and modern family celebrations.\n\nFor my second book, I wanted to share the joy of living in and discovering Hong Kong from a young foreigner’s perspective, particularly one who is western-raised and of Asian heritage, like myself. The Not-So-Uniform Life of Holly-Mei tells the tale of a 12-year-old girl of mixed Taiwanese-British heritage who moves to Hong Kong for her mother’s new job. It’s the first in a series of three books and they all touch on places and activities in Hong Kong that meant a lot to me when I lived there.\n\nRecently, there seems to be a growing number of books about children and teenagers of East Asian (and other) heritages trying to fit into or find their way in western (usually English-speaking) environments. Have you noticed this too? If so, what do think has changed or prompted this development?\n\nIn the last few years, I have noticed a large number of published books about the East Asian experience featuring immigrants or children of immigrant parents. I think it’s wonderful to finally see these stories out in the world – not only so readers can see themselves and their experiences mirrored in what they read, but also so readers from other cultures can find connections and develop empathy. I think this has come about because authors of East Asian heritage are ready to tell their own stories, tired of seeing books where people who look like them are relegated to supporting characters, sidekicks, or caricatures. Publishers probably also recognize that the make-up of English-speaking countries has become much more diverse and that these stories have value, not just in a business sense, but in the truth they tell. I hope that the Holly-Mei series will help to widen the lens of Asian and mixed-Asian stories and the unique perspective they can bring.\n\nMillie seems to settle into Hong Kong life very easily, whereas Holly-Mei seems to find it more difficult. Millie has a different character and interests, but there isn’t a huge age gap between them. Could you comment about their relationship and the differences and similarities in their characters?\n\nBoth Holly-Mei and Millie are written based on observations of my own family and friendship dynamics, with a hint of Jane Austen’s Lizzie and Lydia thrown in. Holly-Mei likes rules and boundaries, which help guide and comfort her, but she is also not afraid to question and challenge things. She’s not too bothered about clothes, makeup, and popularity, and spends her time being active and playing sports. Millie on the other hand is carefree and likes to do as she pleases, even if it means modifying a recipe or having a secret stash of makeup. She’s outgoing and has a naturally magnetic personality, which sometimes leads to conflict with her sister, who is envious of the ease with which Millie navigates the world. Both sisters are happy and confident in their mixed-race heritage and are eager to make the most of their Hong Kong experience.\n\nIn your Holly-Mei stories you introduce words and expressions in Mandarin, Cantonese and also Polish and Philippino foods. You also have Ah-Ma speaking in broken English. Please could you comment on this? How conscious a decision was it to do this?\n\nThe choices made in the book were deliberate. I wanted to show – through both language and food – how adaptable and open children can be as they float between a household made up of one culture and the outside environment in a different culture. Holly-Mei’s Mandarin skills are not great, as she is a second-generation immigrant and speaks English with her parents, but she still has a loving relationship with her Taiwanese grandmother, Ah-ma, and they communicate from the heart. Ah-ma’s cadence and conjugation are similar to my own mother’s way of speaking and reflect the way English was expressed around me in my childhood from my extended family and local Taiwanese community. In terms of food, Holly-Mei loves typical western-style grilled cheese sandwiches as well as the traditional Chinese jiaozi she makes with Ah-ma. She also is excited to try new dishes, like her housekeeper’s pancit and adobo, which adds to the characterization of Holly-Mei and Millie as open and appreciative of their diverse surroundings.\n\nWe’re intrigued to know more about the Holly-Mei series. Could you give us a taste of what’s to come?\n\nBook two, The Not-So-Perfect Plan is out now in the US/Canada and will launch in the UK in April 2024. It follows Holly-Mei and her friends as they participate in a city-wide competition in Hong Kong and features the Lunar New Year holiday. I’m currently editing Book three, The Not-So-Simple Question, where Holly-Mei goes on a school trip to Taiwan and thinks about what it means to be of mixed-heritage.\n\nAnne of Green Gables, by L.M. Montgomery (image source: A Mighty Girl); Are you there God? It’s me. Margaret, by Judy Blume (image source: Goodreads)\n\nFinally, would you tell us about your own childhood reading? What did you read as a child? Any favourite books or authors? Any particular person or place you associate with your early reading?\n\nI’ve always loved books with a strong female character – Anne of Green Gables is one of my favourites. Judy Blume and her books about change, coming of age, and being different always resonated with me – they have a universal appeal and I guess that is why they are still on children’s bookshelves decades later. I spent many years of my childhood in Brownies and Girl Guides – it was the books we talked about when we gathered after meetings and at camp, by flashlight in our tents, that I remember the most.\n\nI wish there had been more diverse characters in the books back when I was growing up. I don’t remember any books featuring Chinese or East Asian characters, and definitely no one mixed-race, so as a child, I felt like my sister and I were the only mixes in the world – even though we both had a very happy childhood, we knew there was something different, unique, about our situation. That’s why having diverse books is so important – so kids know there are others out there that can understand their experiences.\n\nThank you, Christina! We look forward to seeing more in the Holly-Mei series.\n\nFollow Christina Matula:\n\nwebsite: https://www.christinamatula.com/\n\ntwitter: @MatulaChristina\n\nfacebook: christinamatulaauthor/\n\ninstagram: christinamatula/\n\ngoodreads: Christina_Matula\n\nWhite Ravens is the premium label given to recently published books selected by the language specialists at the International Youth Library, Munich, as being especially noteworthy.

ISBN 978-7-5708-1121-2.\n\nSummary: Mr. Brown Bear is teaching his students how to write the number “1”. Everybody is trying very hard. Crab walks sideways and writes a “1” that seems to be sleeping. Ant writes a very small “1” that you must look hard to find. Chicken can’t hold the pen steadily and writes out a dancing “1”. Mole has bad eyesight and writes “1” like “7”. Bird finds a stick-like “1”. Dog draws a bone as “1”. Turtle writes its “1” so slowly that you need to wait patiently for it to appear. Though everyone writes “1” in different ways, Mr. Brown Bear always finds a way to understand and appreciate each student’s effort. The short and joyful story reminds readers of the time when they had just started to attend school, while Mr. Brown Bear plays the role of an ideal teacher, treasuring children’s early passion for learning.

Bilingual text: Hokkien (Taiwanese) and Mandarin.\n\nSummary: There is always something to look forward to on a hot summer day. Yellow mangoes sway on tree branches like little suns, and after a sudden tropical downpour the whole yard is filled with water. Two boys and their dog become ferrymen, rowing in a bucket. They shake the trees to let water droplets splash all over their bodies and let their clothes dry by the whispering wind. Rain is a gift, wind is a luxury, the canopy of the mango trees seems like the top of the world. Tomorrow they will play again. In this simple story, Chu Yu-Ling recreates the smells and sounds of summer in lyrical phrases and the rich, beautiful tones of the Hokkien (Taiwanese) language. For her, a picture book is a song with an overall rhythm, a song composed of pictures and text. The calm texture and few simple colours of Chu Chia-Hui’s rubbed engravings almost make the reader hear this song about the quiet feeling of pure joy on a magical day. The childhood memories conjured up in this book are shared by generations of Taiwanese.

ISBN 978-988-79458-5-7.\n\nSummary: Laika, the first dog to orbit Earth, was sent to her certain death by humans. From a dog’s point of view, that means Earth is too dangerous, and so Kaka and turtle An decide to leave on their own terms. Aboard their spaceship, surrounded by Hong Kong movie posters and street signs, they revel in memories. Even the star constellations outside remind them of their old home. When the spacecraft is hit by meteorites, they must abandon most of their treasured memorabilia, but with less ballast they land safely on Mars, their new home. Here the wind is better for kite flying and their children can jump higher. Still, they sometimes gaze fondly upon the distant blue planet Earth. When Lam Kinchoi, winner of several awards for his picture books and prints, returned to Hong Kong in 2020 from the Cambridge School of Art’s Master’s Program, he reworked the first draft of his adventure story “Journey to Mars“ into a story of contemporary Hong Kong, the title of which could also be translated as: ”Where should we emigrate to?“ [LO]\n\nThe life of a lotus seed : Yi ke lian zi de sheng ming lü cheng 一顆蓮子的生命旅程, text by Chen, Yingting 陈莹婷, illus by Huaqing 花青 (i.e. Wang Huajing) .

(Series: Lang hua duo duo 浪花朵朵) ISBN 978-7-5596-4989-8.\n\nSummary: A lotus seed falls into the mud and lies dormant until it begins to sprout the next spring. Readers can follow how it grows into a full plant, blooms, and withers away, replaced by a pod with new seeds inside. These will fall into the mud eventually, and the never-ending cycle of life will start again. Huaqing’s illustrations in the style of traditional Chinese ink paintings perfectly match the topic of this exquisite book, the life cycle of a lotus and of life itself. Emerging from the mud but forever appearing clean and elegant, the lotus has long been a spiritual symbol of life in traditional Chinese art and literature. After graduating from the Institute of Botany at the Chinese Academy of Science, Chen Yingting has devoted herself for years to popularising science. Huaqing is pursuing her doctoral degree at the School of Fine Arts within the Chinese National Academy of Arts. “The life of a lotus seed” is an excellent example of the rising number of non-fiction picture books for children in China.

(Series: Xiao tong shu) ISBN 978-7-5736-0039-4\n\nSummary: This novel is about a childhood in Jinan City about half a century ago. It was an era when children were neither given many toys nor able to spend much time with adults. However, nothing could stop their passion for playing and roaming their surroundings to learn all about everything they could. From the perspective of the first-person narrator, a young boy, readers find out how skilled children were in creating something from nothing. Liu Haiqi, one of the pre-eminent Chinese novelists for children today and recognizable by his colloquial style, is a master in capturing the aesthetic dimensions of a child’s voice and perspective.

Most are based on memories of her early years – when a little girl first tasted the bitterness of being deceived by an adult, when a father developed a strange enthusiasm for baking during the hardest years of his family’s life, when a cat came to the house unexpectedly and was cast out after four years. Those old days are brought back to life in nostalgic flashbacks so that readers get a sense of the smells and flavours, as well as the sentiments and wisdom that grew over time. Tie Ning is the author of Mei gui men 玫瑰们 (The rose door), Da yu nü 大浴女 (The large bathers), “Oh, Xiang xue” 哦,香雪 (O, Xiangxue) and many other prose works.

ISBN 978-7-5707-1225-0.\n\nSummary: A boy and a little goat meet and never separate again. They build a house and live together in what seems to be a very small world. However, it grows bigger as one follows the boy’s story, told in first-person narration: How many goats are there on earth? They are all here in my house when I have my little goat with me. How many names does a little goat have? As many as the numerous places it has been in my imagination. Time slows down as readers begin to see this world in a new way: the tender green of grass in early spring, so fresh for one to discover; a rainbow in the sunset, so beautiful it makes one cry. Xue Tao wrote this book in memory of the goat he had in his childhood. He is renowned for his children’s novels and fairy tales, including Jiu yue de bing he 九月的冰河 (The ice river of September), Xiao cheng chi 小城池 (The small castle), Da fu weng 大富翁 (The wealthy men), and “”Shan hai jing xin chuan shuo” 山海经新传说 (The new classic of mountains and seas).

Taibei: Shi lu gu shi you xian gong si (SiLoo Story), 2021. 148 pp. Age 12+. ISBN 978-626-953-470-8.\n\nSummary: Bibi, a dog, has disappeared suddenly. While her owner, a young illustrator, hoards memorabilia in her cramped apartment and dwells on her grieving and worrying, the narrative moves over to the stray dog’s universe. It is full of happiness, timelessness, and freedom. When Bibi eventually returns home, tired and weak, the woman realizes that the dog has just come back to give her a chance to say goodbye, and that she must accept the inescapable reality of his imminent death. Lin Xiaobei uses space, smudging and partial erasure of pencil strokes, light and colour, to create the artist’s and the dog’s different spheres. When sadness fades and the woman ventures out to discover the world anew, colours from the dog’s world trickle into the black-and-white portrayal of the woman’s confined life. Lin Xiaobei, who is published internationally under the pen name Bei Lynn, is an award-winning illustrator of picture books. This graphic novel in the style of a personal notebook is her first work for an older audience. [LO]\n\n[Ed: See also “The Art of Saying Farewell” by Bei Lynn, tr.

ISBN 978-986-274-568-7\n\nSummary: At first glance, the cover and each double spread of this nearly wordless picture book seem to be identical depictions of an alley with its typical homes of the Taiwanese post-war generation. Subtle differences in the pictures create the main story, while other substory lines are hidden in this almost static theatrical backdrop. The picture is anchored by the big tree on the left, a silent witness to the course of the seasons and a boy’s growing up. When he leaves home, his aging parents stay behind, neighbours move away, houses are demolished, and skyscrapers begin to loom in the background. Itinerant traders, puppet theatre performances and Tai chi exercises disappear, the alley becomes deserted. Only upon the death of his father does the protagonist return, accompanied by his own family. Remembering his roots and spending time with his loved ones is his way to cope with his regrets. Life is impermanent, but spring has come again. Xu Zhiwei has won, among others, the Xinyi Children’s Literature Award. [LO]\n\nXueting C.

The Essential Guide to Chinese Deities (Red Wheel Weiser, 2018) looks at 60 Chinese deities and their relevance today. Sinopticon: A Celebration of Chinese Science Fiction (Solaris, 2021), a collection of 13 short stories selected and translated by Xueting, won the British Fantasy Society’s Award for Best Anthology. last week!\n\nPlease tell us about yourself. What would you like our readers to know about you?\n\nAs well as translating, I write non-fiction about Chinese culture, in particular film, contemporary literature, music and tea. I love good food and cooking, have a collection of loose-leaf teas and tea sets which I use regularly, and have a pair of lovely black cats, whose names are Ravage and Scuzzy.\n\nI read somewhere that you came to the U.K. at the age of 11. What was that like for you?\n\nThat was obviously one of the biggest changes in my life, lots to adjust to. It helped that it happened in my childhood. As a child, you take almost anything as normal, I’d been moved round China quite a bit anyway, so that all helped with settling in. I have to say, that as a native of Guangzhou, I’ve never really quite got used to the cold of the British winter, or autumn.. or spring. My partner calls me a tropical fish! Living in China in the 80s and early 90s was an experience that left a deep impression on me, but I also spent some of my most impressionable years in the UK and owe much of my passion for reading to the Anglophone literary traditions. As an adult I feel firmly part of both cultures, which is why I do what I do, explain the wonders of my first home to the people of my second. It does mean that I need to be quite active in keeping up with what’s happening in China. Due to the pandemic and what’s happening here, I’ve not been able to go back for even a short visit for quite a while. So I have to make concerted efforts to stay in contact with friends.\n\nWhen translating, I constantly come across things that would be general knowledge to Chinese readers but which are not general knowledge for English readers. I imagine this is an issue in your work as well. How do you manage this?\n\nOf course, each culture has a shared consciousness that outsiders aren’t going to get, especially when you shortcut and reference them, but that’s the same with any group. If, say, you join a group of old friends for a night out, there’ll be in-jokes, friend forms, and meta language that could leave you quite disconnected. It’s actually more interesting, this day and age, that we have areas of cross-over.\n\nBut Hanyu is a language so steeped in chengyu idioms, where each contains an entire story in themselves, that I do need to bridge those gaps. I’ve taken various approaches, depending on what I feel is required. Sometimes, I would explain the allegory in a footnote, like in Jiang Bo’s 江波 “Starship: Library” 宇宙尽头的书店, where the heroine is named Ehuang 娥皇, after the demi-goddess and daughter of the legendary ruler Yao 尧. She married his successor and helped him secure his rule, and whilst this gives an idea of the character of the heroine, and this mythological tidbit is interesting, it’s not necessary to the understanding of the story, so a footnote means it’s there for those who are interested, but if you’re tied up in the story, you can simply gloss over it. On the other hand, Han Song’s 韩松 “Tombs of the Universe” 宇宙墓碑 talks about the Yiguanzhong 衣冠冢, which are empty, but dressed coffins used for burials where the bodies can’t be found. I felt English readers needed to be made aware of what they are, so I take my editor’s right to add that in. Other terms, which belong to the story, and the world of the story and the world created by the author, I will just leave in the Pinyin. Context makes them understandable, and the truly curious reader can stop and turn to google if they really want, but I feel that to over-Westernise the language is to rob the work of its heritage.\n\nYou have written on all kinds of subjects, including ghosts, ghouls, and tomb-robbing. Are there any that you particularly enjoy, or that your readers particularly respond to. What are you working on at the moment? What can we look forward to next?\n\nI’m interested in all kinds of literature, which is why it’s currently such an exciting time in China, where there’s been a flourishing of all kinds of genres. I explore this in my essay “Net Novels and the ‘She Era’: How Internet Novels Opened the Door for Female Readers and Writers in China” in The Way Spring Arrives, and I’m currently curating a selection of horror fiction. I tend to alternate between non-fiction and fiction, and see it all as part of one overarching project. I do have a sort of internal roadmap, which is based a lot on where I can see China going, what I think a western audience will develop an appetite for, what authors are investigating, and are going to be proud to put their names on. My next non-fiction will be out next year, and I’m looking forward to sharing the news when I can.\n\nPlease tell us about your childhood reading. Did you have any favourite books or reading material? Any people or places you associate with your early reading?\n\nI wasn’t particularly an avid reader until my teenage, but I do fondly remember reading books on Greek mythology, which I suppose is quite a usual thing for geeks around the world. These were in Chinese and had rather sombre, monochrome pictures, and probably not intended as nursery reading, unlike the western fairy tale books I also had with some beautifully ornate illustrations. I used to love listening to the lunchtime readings of Jin Yong’s Condor Heroes on Cantonese radio, which we would tune in on every school day. I think every child in my background probably had a set of “10,000 Whys”, which was a children’s encyclopedia which grew out of mid-century science writing in the Soviet block, and was then expanded by Chinese science writers. It was fun, and there were experiments you could read about and try yourself. That connection between the Early Russian science, SF tradition and its influences on Chinese literature was always very strong, and probably explains why I have really vivid memories of a copy of Alexander Belyaev’s “Professor Dowell’s Head”, which I must have been far too young for, but didn’t feel that different from the gruesomeness of traditional ghost stories, which I’ve always loved. When I was older, and had access to that canon of ‘respectable’ English literature that Chinese girls should read to improve their prospects, I dived straight into the Victorian era, and never gave up a chance to enjoy a mystery, or the gothic. You can certainly see the roots of this in childhood reading.\n\nThank you, Xueting, and many congratulations on winning the award last week!\n\nFollow Xueting on\n\nBlog Snow Pavilion\n\nTwitter @xuetingni\n\nInstagram @SnowPavilion\n\nGood Reads Xueting C.
