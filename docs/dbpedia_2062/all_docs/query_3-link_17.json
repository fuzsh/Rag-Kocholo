        "text": "wikipedia | MCLC | baidu | CBI | MyChineseBooks.com | Chinese Short Stories |\n\nBorn in 1976, A Yi (real name Ai Guozhu) worked as a police officer, secretary and editor before settling down at the age of 32 to the fiction he always knew he would write. After a brief stint on the editorial board of Chutzpah, a now-defunct but once highly-influential literary magazine featuring work by younger and edgier writers (like A Yi himself), he moved to the Xiron publishing company, where he is an editor of the the \"Iron Gourd\" literary-fiction imprint. Though highly esteemed by a select group of readers and writers (Li Jingze, former head editor of People's Literature Magazine regularly praises him publicly), A Yi's reputation has been slower to spread to a wider reading public (and, given the darkness of his subject matter, it might not).\n\nA Yi has produced many collections of short stories as well as longer work. Two full-length novels have appeared in English:\n\nWake Me Up at Nine in the Morning (Oneworld, 2022, translated by Nicky Harman), of which New Internationalist said, 'It’s tempting to view the book as A Yi’s unflinching take on a moral vacuum at the heart of contemporary China, but he is also lowering his bucket into a much deeper well of delicious literary misanthropy.'\n\nand\n\nA Perfect Crime, Oneworld, 2015, translated by Anna Holmwood. The Wall Street Journal said, ‘Tightly crafted…less a traditional catch-him-if-you-can crime caper and more a psychological probe into a pathological mind.’\n\nAn English translation of his story \"The Curse\" can be read here.\n\nA Yi is represented by Peony Literary Agency.\n\nSee Asymptote's Sinophone \"20 Under 40\"\n\nPhoto by Matthew Niederhauser."
