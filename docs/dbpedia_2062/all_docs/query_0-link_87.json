There are also special entries for several writers from earlier generations who are among the most significant influences on Chinese writing today—including the satirical essayist and short story writer Lu Xun, and the feminist, and queen of domestic drama, Zhang Ailing (Eileen Chang).\n\nThe biographies are complemented by five in-depth essays: Dylan Levi King assesses the changing role of the author in Chinese society, US-based academic Zhu Ping discusses women’s writing in Chinese, translator and scholar Andrea Lingenfelter provides an introduction to the rich but often neglected field of Hong Kong literature, while Emily Xueni Jin outlines the increasingly influential field of Chinese science fiction and Rachel Cheung brings us bang up-to-date with the latest in Chinese internet literature.

She spent her childhood in Aksu and in Turpan. After graduating from high school, she entered the ‘Xinjiang’ University of Language and Literature in 1960. In 1965, she graduated from the University with honors. After graduating, she became a lecturer at the same university.\n\nMs. Isa was not only a gifted teacher but also a fiery poet and a scholar whose heart was burning for the cause of her motherland and her people.\n\nMs. Isa emigrated to Turkey in 1985 due to the Chinese colonial policies and unbearable oppression of the Uyghur people. Her poetry collections such as “Love” and “Snow Tulip” were loved by Turkish readers.\n\nMs. Isa was recognized as the world’s first describer of Chinese oppression at a 1999 art exhibition in Germany. Many of her poems have been translated into German. She even taught Uyghur at the famous Goethe Institute in Germany from 2001 to 2002.\n\nMs. Isa published and translated her novel “Mahmud Kashgari” from Uyghur into Turkish in 2006 and “Yusuf Khas Hajib” in 2010.\n\nMs. Isa was a self-sacrificing and dedicated woman. Without hesitation, she dedicated her whole existence to her motherland and her people. Our people will never forget this faithful and self-sacrificing daughter.\n\nPosted by: Magnus Fiskesjö, nf42@cornell.edu\n\nZheng Min (1920-2022)\n\nPoet, translator, and cultural critic Zheng Min 郑敏 (b. July 18, 1920) has just died, on January 3, 2022, at the age of 101. Along with Mu Dan 穆旦 (1918–1977), Chen Jingrong 陳敬容 (1917–1989), and others, in the 1940s she was one of the “Nine Leaves” 九葉 poets, whose 1981 anthology was not only instructive to poets in the post-Cultural Revolution era but also constituted an important link with the poetry and poetics of the Republican era.\n\nI was surprised to see that the MCLC bibliography, which is usually so thorough, lists so few articles about her and translations of her work into English. Hopefully the following can be added to the database [they have been added–Kirk Denton]? Most of the titles below are in Géraldine Fiss’s entry on Zheng in the Dictionary of Literary Biography out this year (op. cit.), but I have added some recent translations as well as a few takes (by van Dongen, Saussy, Yeh, and Zhao) on her controversial essay ‘A look back at the end of century: Chinese language reform and new poetry in China’ 世纪末的回顾: 汉语语言变革与中国新诗创作 (Wenxue pinglun 3 (1993): 5–20).

Spence, an eminent scholar of China and its vast history who in books like “God’s Chinese Son: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan” (1996) and “The Search for Modern China” (1990) excavated that country’s past and illuminated its present, died on Saturday at his home in West Haven, Conn. He was 85.\n\nHis wife, Annping Chin, said the cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease.\n\nProfessor Spence, who taught for more than 40 years at Yale University, where his lecture classes were always in great demand, found the big picture of Chinese history in small details. His books, deeply researched, probed individual lives and odd moments that were representative of larger cultural forces, wrapping it all together with vivid storytelling.\n\n“This is a delicate spider’s web of a book, deft, fascinating and precise as Chinese calligraphy,” Diana Preston wrote in The Los Angeles Times in a review of his “Treason by the Book” (2001), about a scholar who challenged the third Manchu emperor in the early 1700s. “It is also unnerving because it conjures so much that still resonates.” Continue reading Jonathan Spence dies at 85 →\n\nA History of Taiwan Literature wins MLA translation prize\n\nThe Modern Language Association (MLA) has announced that A History of Taiwan Literature by Ye Shitao, translated by Professor Christopher Lupke (University of Alberta), is the winner of the MLA Aldo and Jeanne Scaglione Prize for a Translation of a Scholarly Study of Literature.\n\nThe MLA committee’s citation about the book: “Ye Shitao’s ‘A History of Taiwan Literature’ is a seminal work in establishing the field of Taiwanese literature and literary history in its own right. Although it is an outline of the history of Taiwanese literature, the study has an impressive scope, introducing English-speaking readers to the complexities of the literary field and discussing single authors, as well as literary societies, magazines, and cultural trends as they come together to create a national literature. Christopher Lupke’s masterful and fluid translation gives the reader the full flavor of the rhetoric and style of the original. The volume also includes extensive Japanese-language notes that, together with the introduction, ensure a better understanding of the significance of Ye Shitao’s book.”\n\nIn addition to hardcover and various e-book formats, A History of Taiwan Literature is now available in paperback from https://www.cambriapress.com/HistoryTaiwanLiterature.\n\nThis book is part of the Cambria Literature in Taiwan Series, headed by Professor Nikky Lin (National Taiwan Normal University), in collaboration with the National Museum of Taiwan Literature and National Taiwan Normal University.\n\nBen Goodman\n\nMarketing Dept.\n\nCambria Press\n\nPathlight relaunch\n\nDear friends of Chinese literature,\n\nPathlight magazine is thrilled to announce the relaunch of the journal, with a new issue “Sense of Place” available now as an ebook world-wide, and for sale as a print magazine in the US (international shipping coming soon!).\n\nPathlight magazine was founded in 2010 in Beijing, originally in collaboration with People’s Literature Magazine, to publish Sinophone short stories and poems in translation. Since then, we have been honored to present writing by up-and-coming authors as well as literary luminaries such as Nobel laureate Mo Yan. However, as the magazine was printed and distributed primarily in China, with digital copies only sporadically available, it hasn’t always been easy to get hold of Pathlight. This is about to change. We are delighted to announce that Pathlight’s first international edition, “Sense of Place,” is now available for sale in both print and ebook versions.\n\nPlease see the attached press release for more details, or visit the magazine website at https://pathlightmag.com/\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nEric Abrahamsen eric@coalhillbooks.com\n\nPeach Blossom Paradise long-listed for National Book Award\n\nCanaan Morse’s translation of Ge Fei’s Peach Blossom Paradise has been long-listed for a National Book Award.

This is a heartbreaking loss that many will find impossible to recover from. As Christopher Lupke commented on social media, Hu “was such a character and full of life.” And for me as well as for Beida, an intimate, nonconformist, and lively atmosphere is now gone. I shared my 挽联 on social media: https://www.facebook.com/pu.wang.104/posts/10157804722426642\n\nCurrently Hu’s students and followers are collecting his works, including his poems translated into other languages. A scholar and true epitome of world literature, Hu was a polyglot/polymath and worked with various translators on various occasions to render his works into English, Portuguese, and Spanish, among others. If you know any references to these works in translation, please contact me at pwang@brandeis.edu (or WeChat: wangpu101). I’ll forward the information and texts to the editing group that is still in the making back in China. Thank you very much for your assistance in advance.\n\nMay Hu Xudong rest in peace and stay forever young.\n\nPu Wang pwang@brandeis.edu\n\nHu Xudong dead at 47\n\nProfessor Hu Xudong (胡續冬, also known by his nickname 胡子) from the Institute of World Literature at Peking University passed away on August 22, at the age of 47. He has published many poem collections including 日曆之力 (The Strength of the Calendar) and essay collections like 去他的巴西 (The Hidden Passion in Brazil). He was the leading figure of a poet group based at Peking University called 五四文學社 and through his classes and social activities he created a huge impact on many students, including me. On August 26, his funeral was held in Beijing.\n\nHere is a link to some of his poems in the original China and with English translations: https://www.lyrikline.org/en/poems/10724. Here is an article dedicated to him by Wu Fei. Also, here’s a link to two articles, one by poet Liao Weitang and the other by Professor Zhu Jinjiang, published in 北京青年報.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYiwen Liu\n\nArtist Hung Liu dead at 73\n\nSource: NYT (8/22/21)\n\nHung Liu, Artist Who Blended East and West, Is Dead at 73\n\nAn immigrant from China, she once said her goal was “to invent a way of allowing myself to practice as a Chinese artist outside of a Chinese culture.”\n\nBy Holland Cotter\n\nHung Liu, a Chinese American artist whose work merged past and present, East and West, earning her acclaim in her adopted country and censorship in the land of her birth, died on Aug. 7 at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 73.\n\nThe cause was pancreatic cancer, Nancy Hoffman Gallery, which represents Ms. Liu in New York, said in a statement.\n\nHer death came less than three weeks before the scheduled opening of a career survey, “Hung Liu: Portraits of Promised Lands,” at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. She was the first Asian American woman to have a solo exhibition there.\n\n“Five-thousand-year-old culture on my back; late-twentieth-century world in my face” is how Ms. Liu described her life-changing arrival in the United States from China in 1984, when she was 36 and already an accomplished painter. Her goal in America, she once said, was “to invent a way of allowing myself to practice as a Chinese artist outside of a Chinese culture.” Continue reading Artist Hung Liu dead at 73 →\n\nPaper Republic no. 4\n\nHere at the Ides of August (well, close enough), we bring you portentous news: there’s been a changing of the guard at Paper Republic! Our esteemed colleague Yvette Zhu is stepping down from management team duties, owing to the time pressures of her actual job, that pays her an actual salary. She’s has served admirably during this time. In fact her greatest contributions have yet to see the light of day – but more about that soon! We are sorry to see her go, and secretly hope she’ll be back soon.\n\nIn the meantime, this sad news is balanced out by the addition of three new members to Paper Republic’s management team: please welcome Jennifer Wong, Megan Copeland, and Danny Parrot to the dugout! Each has their own quite distinct background, and brings their own strengths to the team. We really look forward to expanding our roster of projects with their help.\n\nWhat’s happening, otherwise? It’s Women in Translation month, that’s what! Worlds Without Borders has a list of 11 translated books by Asian women writers, and you can also check out US PEN, Lithub, the Community of Literary Magazines and Presses and many other locales for relevant reading lists. We also note that there’s currently no way to search the Paper Republic database for works by female writers, translated by female translators, and we resolve to add that capability. Continue reading Paper Republic no. 4 →\n\nPaper Republic 3\n\nHello again! You must have been champing at the bit to receive this next issue of our newsletter. Well you need wait no longer. It’s been a busy time for the PR management team, what with the delights that were the Aberdeen Festival of Chinese Translation and Bristol Translates as well as our working toward some big announcements we can make soon. Watch this space. Then there’s the small matters of the welcome distraction, the Olympics, followed eagerly by Nicky and Emily, upcoming camping trips for Jack and Eric, and big work projects and exams for Yvette and Lirong.\n\nAnyway, first for a little housekeeping. Remember back to May 2020? (I don’t know about you, but I can’t tell if it feels like yesterday or ten years ago with the past year and a bit the world has had.) So whether you do remember or not, a reminder: Paper Republic collaborated with Leeds Centre for New Chinese Writing to run Give-it-a-go, bringing together 124 translators plus ourselves to have a go at translating Deng Anqing’s “Forty Days: Growing Closer to My Parents during Quarantine” (read the joint translation here). Since then, this piece and others from the Epidemic Series have been translated into Spanish, here, here, here and here, plus, I believe, into Slovenian, somewhere. The new good news is that, more recently, Deng’s account of lockdown at home is now available in Danish, in DanmarkKina magazine #115. It feels good for PR to have played a role in giving these stories a broader, more international readership.

Fang Professor of Chinese Languages and Culture, and a longtime member of the MIT faculty in Global Studies and Languages and Comparative Media Studies/Writing, passed away on Sunday in Boston after a heart attack.\n\nFor decades, Wang was a leading scholar of the intersection of media and activism in China. Following a bachelor’s degree at National Taiwan University, she studied comparative literature at the University of Michigan and then at the University of Massachusetts, where she earned her PhD. She continued her focus on literature at Duke University, where she was faculty for 16 years and authored her first books. 1992’s The Story of Stone, which was awarded a Joseph Levenson Book Prize for the year’s best book on premodern China, explored traditional Chinese literature, but her next book, High Culture Fever: Politics, Aesthetics, and Ideology in Deng’s China (1996), marked a move toward her study of Chinese media more broadly.\n\nContinue reading Jing Wang dies at 71 →\n\nChinese Literature Today news\n\nDear MCLC Friends and Colleagues\n\nSummer greetings from the University of Oklahoma! Over the last year I assumed the Editor-in Chief position of Contemporary Chinese Thought with the understanding that after this year we will be merging CLT with CCT to launch a new title: CLTT, or Chinese Literature and Thought Today with Routledge. The new journal will continue the trajectory of CCT as an interdisciplinary hub for Chinese thought in English translation, but CLTT will expand its breadth to include Chinese literature and poetry, literary criticism, poetics interviews as well. CLTT will maintain many aspects of the award-winning design of CLT’s parent journal, World Literature Today (America’s longest-running world literature journal), so that we can continue in CLT’s tradition of marrying aesthetic attention to detail more typical of a literary trade publication with the rigor of a peer-review journal. We believe that by combining our journals’ individual strengths, we can bring more attention to the scholars and authors we translate and publish.\n\nBelow, I am including the latest CLT Editor’s Note, which goes into more detail about the up-coming issue of CLT and more details about CCT’s amazing history and our hopes for the future. Thank you all so much for your support of both CLT and CCT over the years. It has been a tremendous honor getting to know so many of you and doing our small part to get your scholarship, translations, reviews, poetry, fiction, and more out to readers. So, on behalf of my colleagues Zhu Ping and Julie Shilling, thank you again and we are genuinely looking forward to working with you all to shape the future of Chinese Literature and Thought Today. A new CFP will soon follow.\n\nOnward!\n\nJonathan Stalling\n\nEditor in Chief, Chinese Literature Today & Contemporary Chinese Thought Continue reading Chinese Literature Today news →\n\nWhat China scholars can do about Xinjiang crisis\n\nSource: University of Westminster Contemporary China Blog (7/21/21)\n\nWhat China Studies Scholars Can Do about the Xinjiang Crisis\n\nBy Guldana Salimjan\n\nIn 2019, at a dinner conversation with several established China scholars, I mentioned that it is dangerous for me to return to China and do further research because of the dire situation in Xinjiang. A professor from China was puzzled, ‘Why is that? I go back to my field site every year!’ I sighed but quickly explained to her, ‘Because right now the government has campaigns targeting Turkic Muslim people, and I am from one of these communities.’ She still expressed disbelief and continued, ‘But you are not Uyghur—they are outrageous.’ I was utterly shocked this time and my mind went blank. A friend and colleague overheard us and intervened, which prompted the professor to defend her remarks: ‘normal Chinese people’ think that Uyghurs ‘are outrageous,’ she added. She offered the excuse that because she conducted fieldwork in eastern China and predominantly Han areas, her knowledge of Xinjiang was based on the ideas of people there. This, she thought, justified her bigoted pronouncements that Uyghurs ‘are outrageous’ and not ‘normal Chinese people.’ In the end, she deferred by saying that she was actually not very informed about Xinjiang and was simply quoting her interlocutors’ opinions.
