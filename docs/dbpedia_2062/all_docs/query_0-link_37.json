        "text": "Greetings, and Happy Year of the Tiger!\n\nPaper Republic is thrilled to announce the upcoming publication of the Paper Republic Guide to Contemporary Chinese Literature, to be published March 1st, in paperback and ebook editions.\n\nIn Brief:\n\nPaper Republic’s experts have produced a timely, carefully selected guide to the leading writers and intellectuals shaping thought in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and beyond.\n\nDetailed biographical entries cover almost 100 of the most important writers working in the Chinese language today, from Anni Baby to Zhang Yueran, by way of Nobel Prize-winner Mo Yan, providing not only an insight into their lives and work, but selected recommendations for further reading in English translation. There are also special entries for several writers from earlier generations who are among the most significant influences on Chinese writing today—including the satirical essayist and short story writer Lu Xun, and the feminist, and queen of domestic drama, Zhang Ailing (Eileen Chang).\n\nThe biographies are complemented by five in-depth essays: Dylan Levi King assesses the changing role of the author in Chinese society, US-based academic Zhu Ping discusses women’s writing in Chinese, translator and scholar Andrea Lingenfelter provides an introduction to the rich but often neglected field of Hong Kong literature, while Emily Xueni Jin outlines the increasingly influential field of Chinese science fiction and Rachel Cheung brings us bang up-to-date with the latest in Chinese internet literature.\n\nThere is also a powerful introductory essay by Xiaolu Guo, the Chinese-born, UK-based novelist who was short-listed for the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2007 for her novel A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary For Lovers, and has since been nominated for the Costa Book Award, the Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje Prize and the Orwell Prize for Political Fiction.\n\nJoin us for a roundtable event celebrating the publication of the Guide on March 17th! Hosted by Aberdeen University, the free event will include Guide contributors Eric Abrahamsen, Xiaolu Guo, Emily Xueni Jin, and Andra Lingenfelter.
