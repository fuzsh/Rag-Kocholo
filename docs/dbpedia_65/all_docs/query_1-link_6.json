        "text": "Parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom, 1868 onwards\n\nNot to be confused with Electoral district of Darlington.\n\nDarlington is the parliamentary constituency for the eponymous market town in County Durham in the North East of England. It is currently represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament by Lola McEvoy of the Labour Party, who was first elected in 2024.[n 1]\n\nThe constituency was created for the 1868 election.[2]\n\nConstituency profile\n\n[edit]\n\nThe constituency is tightly drawn around the Darlington urban boundary, and is slightly less wealthy and more deprived than the UK average figures.[3]\n\nBoundaries\n\n[edit]\n\n1868–1885\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder the Reform Act 1867, the proposed contents of the new parliamentary borough were defined as the townships of Darlington, Haughton-le-Skerne, and Cockerton.[2] However, this was amended under the Boundary Act 1868, with the boundary defined as being coterminous with the Municipal Borough of Darlington.[4]\n\nSee map on Vision of Britain website.[5]\n\n1885–1918\n\n[edit]\n\nAs defined in 1868 with minor amendments.[6]\n\n1918–1983\n\n[edit]\n\nThe County Borough of Darlington.[7]\n\nThe boundaries were adjusted in 1918, 1950 and 1973 to reflect changes to the boundaries of the county borough.\n\n1983–2010\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Borough of Darlington wards of Bank Top, Central, Cockerton East, Cockerton West, college, Eastbourne North, Eastbourne South, Harrowgate Hill, Haughton East, Haughton West, Hummersknott, Lascelles, Lingfield, Mowden, Northgate North, Northgate South, North Road, Park East, Park West, and Pierremont.[8][9]\n\nNo change to boundaries.\n\n2010–2024\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Borough of Darlington wards of Bank Top, Central, Cockerton East, Cockerton West, College, Eastbourne, Faverdale, Harrowgate Hill, Haughton East, Haughton North, Haughton West, Hummersknott, Lascelles, Lingfield, Mowden, Northgate, North Road, Park East, Park West, and Pierremont.[10]\n\nMinor change to reflect new ward boundaries.\n\n2024–present\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, enacted by the Parliamentary Constituencies Order 2023, from the 2024 general election, the constituency comprises the following:\n\nThe Borough of Darlington wards of: Bank Top & Lascelles; Brinkburn & Faverdale; Cockerton; College; Eastbourne; Harrowgate Hill; Haughton & Springfield; Heighington & Coniscliffe; Hummersknott; Mowden; North Road; Northgate; Park East; Park West; Pierremont; Red Hall & Lingfield; Stephenson; Whinfield.[11]\n\nThe constituency was expanded slightly to bring the electorate within the permitted range, by adding the rural ward of Heighington & Coniscliffe from the abolished constituency of Sedgefield.\n\nPolitical history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe seat has been held by all three major parties in its long existence, but has been a marginal constituency between the Labour and Conservative parties in the years since the Second World War. Labour held the seat for 27 years from 1992 with their candidate Jenny Chapman winning the seat in 2010 with a 3,388 majority down from 10,404 in the previous election. In 2015, her majority over the Conservatives fell to 3,158. In the UK General election 2019 Conservative Peter Gibson defeated Chapman with a 3,294 majority before being defeated himself in 2024 by Lola McEvoy of Labour by a margin of 2,298\n\nMembers of
