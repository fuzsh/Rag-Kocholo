Especially when the topic is so sensitive.\n\nThere have been lots of heinous things done to this country in the name of Islam - terror attacks, FGM, treatment of women and the LGBT, intolerance of other religions, treatment of women who remove the hijab and those who leave the religion. These things should be openly discussed because they are damaging to not only the country but also Muslims who do not subscribe to extremism and want to live in peace.\n\nFGM is cultural and practised in both Islamic and Christianity faiths.\n\nA brief overview here: https://www.forwarduk.org.uk/who-we-work-with/faith-community-leaders/fgm-and-religion/\n\nWith the exception of the hijab, most of the above have/still do happen in other religions too but it seems to always boil down to Muslims having to defend themselves against the fanatics in their midst. And time and time again they tell us that these fanatics aren't what their religion is about. People are choosing not listen or believe them because it doesn't suit their agenda.\n\nWhen the Catholic priests sex abuse scandal came to light I saw a lot of anger at the church itself, but I didn't see the same level of the general Catholic faith having to answer for the crimes of a few. Why does the general Muslim population have to answer for a few of their fanatics then?\n\nI had a very sad member of my team today explaining how he and his wife and children were very scared.

Let’s hope they don’t turn up.\n\ndid the ones that were planned for yesterday actually take place? I am not aware that anything happened in Scunthorpe for example although I could be wrong.\n\nAbsolutely, I agree, the conversation about Islam needs to be what is peoples problem with Islam and I have no doubt a lot of it comes down to language used by some public figures influencing the views of some easily influenced people. Why is Islam currently the bogey man?\n\n---\n\ndid the ones that were planned for yesterday actually take place?\n\nNo, absolutely no one (I could walk to the centre from here in under 10 minutes, that’s just minutes from the supposed location).\n\n---\n\nIs it a hotel where immigrants are housed?\n\nNot that I know of, but they are in a few other places/a hotel that are in the centre (not far from there) and it’s more public knowledge that they’re in there.\n\nI am so confused by these riots.\n\nI get there is a lot of misinformation ... and a lot of whipping up of tension....\n\nBut what confuses me, is that somewhere along the line, in any riot or protest, there is a reason why so many get involved. A kernel of truth, that should be listened to....and I cant hear anyone listening or being honest about what on earth is going on.\n\nI think there is anger, I think there is frustration, I think there is poverty, And somewhere along the line there is something about racism and islamaphobia. Which maybe needs a bit more discussion and dissection? And sadly at the moment discussion seems to be immediately shut down. And what might be a legitimate concern, or total misinformation isnt allowed.\n\nFGM is cultural and practised in both Islamic and Christianity faiths.\n\nA brief overview here: https://www.forwarduk.org.uk/who-we-work-with/faith-community-leaders/fgm-and-religion/\n\nWith the exception of the hijab, most of the above have/still do happen in other religions too but it seems to always boil down to Muslims having to defend themselves against the fanatics in their midst.

Why does the general Muslim population have to answer for a few of their fanatics then?\n\nI agree, I think the abuses in other religions aren’t talked about nearly enough and that is unfair. We need to have open dialogues relating to all religions.\n\nI don't know what the government will do but I do worry that strict rules will end up coming into effect because of these riots and social media incitement. Lockdowns were somewhat normalised during covid so it wouldn't be so bad to lock people down or enact curfews \"for their own safety\" again.

Especially when the topic is so sensitive.\n\nCurfews don’t stop you from protesting\n\nTougher controls with more police presence and whatever also don’t stop you from protesting\n\nThere’s been nothing said to suggest anything that would stop people from protesting or voicing their opinions online completely.\n\nThere have been lots of heinous things done to this country in the name of Islam - terror attacks, FGM, treatment of women and the LGBT, intolerance of other religions, treatment of women who remove the hijab and those who leave the religion. These things should be openly discussed because they are damaging to not only the country but also Muslims who do not subscribe to extremism and want to live in peace.\n\nI think I phrased my question poorly but I really was asking how Islam had changed this country. As in, what have Muslims \"forced\" the UK to do, for lack of a better word.\n\nAside from terror attacks most of these things, while terrible, only affect a few and usually affect other Muslims more than they do your average Brit. And thankfully, some of the Muslims who do these things are either prevented or punished because our UK laws do not allow them.\n\nAnd I'm sure many Muslims who come from countries with stricter practices are actually grateful that the UK enables them to live a little more freely."
