        "text": "üì¢ Limerick Chamber's Call to Action for Upcoming Elections! üåü üèõÔ∏è As we approach the European Parliament, Directly Elected Mayor, and Local Elections in June, Limerick Chamber has laid out its vision for our region's future. üìú Our \"Building a Better Region\" report highlights urgent priorities: üè° Housing: We're advocating for more affordable housing options and efficient use of state lands, ensuring a blend of tenures near employment hubs. üèô City Centre Revitalisation: Implementing our detailed \"City Centre Report\" is crucial. Based on extensive surveys and 63 tailored recommendations, it's time to rejuvenate the heart of our city! üöè Transport Enhancements: From new bus routes to improved mobility plans, we're pushing for a transport network that meets daily needs and supports our business community. At European level, we emphasize enhancing energy security and supporting infrastructure projects through EU policies. üåç Locally, our first Directly Elected Mayor and councillors will play pivotal roles. Not just in policy-making but also in lobbying for our region's interests nationally and internationally. üë§ Leadership Matters: The right mayor can transform our community. We need leaders not just with visions but proven track records. üöÄ üó£Ô∏è Se√°n Golden, our Chief Economist and Director of Policy, stresses the transformative potential of the Directly Elected Mayor in addressing our community needs. Noel Gavin, President of Limerick Chamber, highlights the importance of our community shaping the future of our region. üìå Your Vote Counts! Engage with candidates, understand their platforms, and let's ensure our leaders align with our ambitions for Limerick. üîó Stay Informed: Follow us for updates: https://lnkd.in/eFrs-Nvy #LimerickElections2024 #BuildingABetterRegion #CommunityDevelopment #VoteSmart\n\nNow that the Tories have lost their majority on Cornwall Council they have no democratic mandate to take any unilateral decision on the potential disposal of Cornwall Airport Newquay and the 650 acres of land that surrounds it. Notwithstanding the many questions and serious concerns that exist in the wider community, that remain to be satisfactorily addressed and properly consulted upon, any decision must surely now be put before the full council for debate and a final vote. The fact that the Tories have seen Councillor defections from their ranks arising from the lack of transparency in this matter should be of sufficient concern to determine that only the full council can bring the requisite scrutiny to debate whether or not this proposal is in the interests of the rate payers of #Cornwall. Given the long-term implications of this proposal and the fact that we only have 9 months until the next elections, anything other than a full council vote is undemocratic and is likely to be considered an abuse of power by the now minority administration. #fullcouncilvote #democracy #actinhaste\n\nGeneral Election 2024: ‚ÄúLabour has no excuses ‚Äì it must deliver for the North East‚Äù As we get used to a new political landscape following a seismic shift in Britain‚Äôs political makeup, all of the North East‚Äôs and Cumbria‚Äôs constituencies bar Stockton West, from Darlington to the Scottish border, are now represented by The Labour Party MPs. This even includes seats such as Hexham, which has elected Joe Morris as the first Labour MP in the Northumberland constituency‚Äôs 140-year history. Coupled with the party‚Äôs performance in the local elections and Kim McGuinness becoming the first elected North East Mayor in May, Labour have never had a stronger mandate or a better opportunity to achieve lasting and positive change for the region. The North East‚Äôs business and community leaders have been quick to comment on Labour‚Äôs landslide election victory and have called on new Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and his party to ‚Äúdeliver for our region‚Äù and create ‚Äúa stronger, fairer North East‚Äù, whilst offering their support and partnership on a range of issues and projects.

Candidate Nathan Conroy Liberal Dunkley by-election 2024. Absolutely critical to vote Liberal in Dunkley By-election and put Labor last. We have to stop continuous increases in Albanese taxation. The latest fuel going up, alcohol going up and not getting 30% tax break on all incomes and now thousands more for cars is enough. Thus a Dunkley By-election thrashing will then get current Labor failures packing up to get out of our hallowed halls of Canberra government which has traditionally belonged to Liberal governments who built Australian civilisation and not Labor failures who in 20 months have destroyed Australian lifestyle for millions of people. This woman flew into Dunkley people and wants to be elected after insulting them ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù, even though Aboriginal people voted against the voice as well. Q. Why doesn‚Äôt Labor respect a democratic majority. A. Because they seek a dictatorship.\n\nThe #UK‚Äôs #LabourParty has won the 2024 #general #election, pushing out the #Conservatives after 14 years of rule. The Labour Party, headed by Sir #KeirStarmer, won 412 #parliamentary seats across the #UK, securing a landslide majority well over the 326 seats mark and saw a gain of 211 seats since the last #generalelection in 2019. As the following chart based on BBC reporting shows, the Conservatives, or #Tories as they are commonly known, trailed some way behind, having lost 250 seats since the last #parliamentaryelection - their worst #defeat ever. Among the #MPs to have lost their positions are #LizTruss, #JacobReesMogg and #PennyMordaunt. It‚Äôs brighter news for the #Greens though, who secured four seats in parliament, up from just one seat in the #HouseofCommons in the 2019 election. This puts them on par with the newly established far-right Reform UK, headed by #Brexiteer #NigelFarage, the #MP candidate for #Clacton. Farage, who is a Member of the #EuropeanParliament, has now entered the House of Commons for the first time, after seven failed attempts. Meanwhile, another notable success went to #JeremyCorbyn, who retained the Islington North seat as an independent #candidate after having been expelled from the Labour Party which he formerly led. In #Scotland, the #ScottishNationalParty saw major losses, losing 38 seats, as swathes of #voters chose to cast their #ballot instead for Labour this time round, while in Northern #Ireland, #SinnF√©in had a greater number of MPs win seats than any other party for the first time. #Starmer has said that his #UKgovernment will now work towards starting ‚Äúto rebuild our #country‚Äù, having pledged in his manifesto to, among other promises, build 1.5 million homes over the next five years, cut #NHS waiting times by adding more than 40,000 appointments a week by paying #staff more to work weekends and evenings and to recruit 6,500 more teachers and introduce free breakfast clubs at every primary school in #England. https://lnkd.in/grazVUNv\n\nWhat will that change look like? ü§î Labour's landslide win has ended 14 years of Conservatives, with Keir Starmer to become our next Prime Minister, promising to usher in a new era and provide more support for local government ‚úÖ Here are a few of the party's pledges: ‚ùó 1.5million new homes over 5 years ‚ùó Building a new generation of \"new towns\" ‚ùó Setting up Great British Energy and investing in clean energy, and making sure that local communities benefit from this infrastructure ‚ùó650,000 new jobs from Great British Energy alone Starmer's cabinet is being formed and ministers instructed to deliver these policies to stimulate growth across Britain, with Starmer claiming this is \"the sunlight of hope\" ‚òÄÔ∏è Do you think they will be able to deliver on their objectives? ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è #generalelection #labour #localgovernment #elections #parliament #publicsector #housing #property #environment #sustainablenergy #planning #london #councils #parkavenuerec\n\nYou've got questions and we've got answers! As we look ahead to the mayoral elections on 2 May, we're responding to your queries about the Mayor, the Combined Authority, and what it all means for our region. üí¨ You‚Äôve asked: Isn‚Äôt this just another layer of government bureaucracy? üó®Ô∏è In York and North Yorkshire, democratic arrangements have changed. Local government reorganisation in North Yorkshire unlocked funding for devolution and formed a unitary council for North Yorkshire. This means instead of seven district and borough councils in North Yorkshire, there is one unitary council for North Yorkshire (North Yorkshire Council) working alongside City of York Council with one combined authority. üöÄThis arrangement means more decision making has moved from central government to local leaders who know our area best. Council leaders will work with the Mayor and the Combined Authority to unlock funding to improve transport, deliver more housing on brownfield sites, create job opportunities, improve skills and training and to help the economy transition to net zero ‚Äì with more to come. üì£ Your vote in the York and North Yorkshire Mayoral election on 2 May 2024 matters because it will elect a Mayor to lead the Combined Authority. ‚û°Ô∏è Find out about the role of a mayor and make sure you take part in this election: https://hubs.ly/Q02pM0C-0 #GetReadyToVote #YourVoteMatters #yourvote #yourmayor #youryorkandnorthyorkshire"
