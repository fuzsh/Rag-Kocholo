Councillors also:\n\nRepresent the Ward where they are elected;\n\nMake decisions;\n\nDevelop and review Council policy;\n\nScrutinise decisions taken by other Councillors;\n\nCarry out regulatory, quasi-judicial and statutory duties; and\n\nCarry out community leadership and engagement roles.\n\nMost Councillors hold regular Ward Surgeries to meet residents to discuss their problems or concerns.
