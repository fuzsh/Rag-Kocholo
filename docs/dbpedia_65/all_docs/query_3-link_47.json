        "text": "Watch the event\n\nListen to the event\n\nThe Darlington Economic Campus is rapidly establishing itself as the civil service’s flagship office outside of London – and has been described by chancellor Jeremy Hunt as moving “decision makers and advisers closer to the communities we serve.”\n\nSo how has the Darlington Economic Campus changed the way policy is made? What difference has it made to the local area and is it contributing to the levelling up agenda? What are the factors behind the campus’s success and should it be used as a blueprint for future relocations? And what are the next steps in the government’s plan to relocate the civil servants from London?\n\nA recent IfG report has evaluated the impact of the Darlington Economic Campus on the civil service and the local area and set out recommendations for current and future relocations.\n\nAt this event, which was held in Darlington, there was a welcome from Nigel Robinson from PA Consulting, and a short presentation from Jordan Urban, the report’s lead author. Baroness Penn, Treasury Lords Minister, responded to the IfG's research.\n\nAn expert panel discussion followed, featuring:\n\nJo Crellin, Director General, Trading Systems at the Department for Business and Trade\n\nMike Hughes, Business and Commercial Editor at The Northern Echo\n\nBaroness Penn, Treasury Lords Minister\n\nAndrew Perkin, Business Growth and Investment Manager at Darlington Borough Council\n\nBeth Russell, Second Permanent Secretary to the Treasury\n\nThe event was chaired by Alex Thomas, Programme Director at the Institute for Government.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @ifgevents and join the conversation using #IfGcivilservice.\n\nThis event was kindly supported by PA Consulting."
