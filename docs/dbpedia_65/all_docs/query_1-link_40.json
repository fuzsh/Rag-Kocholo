        "text": "The next local election is scheduled for Thursday, 7 May 2026.\n\nThe last local election was held on Thursday, 2 May 2024.\n\nPeople who run your council are called councillors. They make important decisions, such as how the council budget is spent and which services are prioritised.\n\nEach councillor is elected for a 4-year term of office and there are 3 councillors representing each council ward in the borough. Councillors are elected every year, over a 4-year cycle (with no elections in the fourth year). This means at each election a third of councillors are elected. Upcoming election years are 2026, 2027, 2028, 2030 and on a continued cycle.\n\nFollowing an electoral boundary review, all 60 councillor seats were contested at the local election in 2022. This meant that electors were able to vote for up to 3 candidates in their ward instead of just one.\n\nAt a local election, people will vote to choose who they would like to be their local councillor. The political party with the highest number of councillors usually controls the council and decides how local services are run. Your local councillor will represent your views for the ward (area) you live in.\n\nElection notices\n\nOnce election notices are available for the next election we will add these to this section.\n\nKey deadlines\n\nOnce key dates are available for the next election we will add these to this section.\n\nLocal government election timetable for Thursday, 7 May 2026.
