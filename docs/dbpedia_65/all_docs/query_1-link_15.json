        "text": "Cyndi Hughes has lived through dramatic changes, going from a tragic childhood in Camden to thriving as a teen in West Deptford — and ultimately becoming mayor of a town of more than 90,000 people.\n\nBut South Jersey residents might be excused for not knowing her political journey: Hughes is the “first citizen” of Darlington, an English borough some 3,400 miles from her local roots.\n\n“Growing up in South Jersey, I never really thought I’d end up where I have,” said Hughes.\n\n“People here &mldr; point to my optimism and positive attitude and say that these are really ‘American’ traits,” said Hughes, who emigrated to Darlington for love in 1986. “I like to believe that’s true.”\n\nMore: You're going to start seeing your doctor at the mall. Here's why\n\nMore: From Haddon Township, around the world and back again\n\nIn starting her one-year mayoral term in May 2021, Hughes told fellow members of Darlington’s Borough Council about her youth in a very different land.\n\n“I came into this world one month after the Berlin Wall was erected (in 1961),” said the former Cyndi Beaver. “I mention this because my childhood memories include ducking and covering under my desk at school.”\n\nShe also recalled “lazy Sundays in the country” at her paternal grandmother’s house “where Polish would be spoken, kielbasa and sauerkraut in a simmering pot would be served and polkas, accordion music and laughter abounded”\n\nHughes, who still misses cheesesteaks and hoagies, said her father, Jim Beaver, worked as a shipyard electrician before starting a grocery store in Camden.\n\n“Overnight, my (two) sisters and I became corner-store girls,” she recalled.\n\nWith Hughes’ mother Bette running the store, her father and an uncle, Fred Beaver of Mount Laurel, launched a remodeling business.\n\nBut the family’s security was shattered when Hughes’ father accidentally drove into a scene of racial unrest on a Camden street in August 1972.\n\n“My father was in the wrong place at the wrong time,” she said, noting he was blinded during an attack by “brick-throwing” rioters.\n\n“My parents lost everything after that incident. It was shocking for them,” said Hughes.\n\n\"My mom did bookkeeping jobs and managed a movie theatre afterwards but my dad &mldr; went on disability payments which weren’t very much.”\n\nHughes lived for a time with her maternal grandmother in Camden “and for the next three years, free school meals, welfare benefits and food stamps kept my family afloat,” she said.\n\n“I think it was during that time I began to think about the importance of social justice, civil rights and a societal safety net for families when things went wrong for them,” she observed.\n\n“In these circumstances, people need a hand-up and that’s why I am involved in politics, to see to it that this ‘hand-up’ remains in place,\" said Hughes, a member of the left-leaning Labour Party.\n\nA turnaround came when Hughes entered her teen years: Her mother obtained a Civil Service position in the court system and the family moved to Gloucester County.\n\n“I was encouraged by a series of excellent and inspiring teachers and by the time I left (West Deptford) high school, I'd been elected president of the student council, had been the lead in many of the school plays, (and) had been crowned Miss West Deptford,\" said Hughes — noting that last achievement \"was advertised as a scholarship pageant rather than a beauty pageant!\"\n\nHer role as student council president reflected a family interest in politics.\n\n“My mom and grandfather were both trade unionists and active in the Democratic party,” said Hughes.\n\n“I remember meeting Congressman (and later Gov. Jim) Florio and being impressed by him and his dedication to the local community.”\n\nAs a senior studying political science and history at Rutgers University, Hughes took a teacher’s suggestion to spend a semester in London.\n\nDuring her studies in England, she attended a Labour Party conference — and met her future husband, Stephen Hughes.\n\nHer initial assessment of Hughes, who later served 30 years in the European Parliament before retiring: “He’s nice but I’ll probably never see him again.”\n\nHowever, after Hughes returned to the United States for graduate studies and work as a researcher, the couple had a life-altering exchange of letters.\n\n“In 1985, I wrote to Steve and he wrote to me within the same 10-day period. Our letters crossed over in the post,” Hughes recalled.\n\n“His life and mine had changed dramatically and we realized there was certainly an attraction there.”\n\nShe moved to Darlington in May 1986 and the couple wed two years later — with ceremonies in her adopted hometown in North East England and at a Pitman church.\n\n“We’ve raised our family here and have set down roots,” said Hughes, now a British citizen and the mother of two. She works as a researcher for an educational trust and serves as a magistrate.\n\nAs mayor, Hughes holds a largely ceremonial post awarded to a council member on the basis of seniority — and only once in a lifetime. The office’s regalia includes a robe and tri-corner hat, a mace and “the mayor’s chains.”\n\nThe mayor will typically “thank, congratulate and encourage residents” at events like business openings and public celebrations, Hughes said.\n\nDuring her tenure, Hughes also welcomed Prince Charles when the royal visited her town, and she officiated at naturalization ceremonies for more than 50 new Britons.\n\nHughes also raised the equivalent of more than $17,000 through events benefitting her mayoral charities. Those included The Mayor’s Song Contest, where school choirs competed for the title of “Best in Darlo.”\n\n“This year has been a truly affirming experience for me,” said Hughes, “I have received so much more by way of gratitude, love and support than I ever imagined possible as a public servant.”\n\nHughes has served 19 years over five terms on Darlington’s borough council. That’s included a decade in “the cabinet — the small ruling body that shares U.S. mayor-type duties,” she said.\n\n“My area of responsibility has been for children and young people’s services,” said Hughes.\n\n“I think it probably all boils down to wanting to help and serve others and wanting to make our community as welcoming and supportive as possible.”\n\nJim Walsh covers public safety, economic development and other beats for the Courier-Post, Burlington County Times and The Daily Journal.\n\nSupport local journalism with a subscription."
