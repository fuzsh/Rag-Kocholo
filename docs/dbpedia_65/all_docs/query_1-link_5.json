The Combined Authority is distinct from local councils, which continue to deliver local services independently. As part of a Devolution Deal, Tees Valley elected a Mayor to act as a single point of accountability to both local people and central Government. Devolution provides more control over local budgets, enabling the region to design services and boost the economy by reinvesting money back into the community.\n\nThe Mayor sets budgets and priorities for economic development, acts as an ambassador to attract investment, and oversees a £588 million Tees Valley Investment Plan. The Mayor also chairs the South Tees Development Corporation (STDC) Board, which promotes economic growth and commercial development in the Tees Valley. This includes converting assets in the South Tees area, now known as Teesworks, into opportunities for business investment and economic growth.\n\nFind more about the mayor and combined authority\n\nDurham Constabulary\n\nPolice and Crime Commissioner\n\nPolice and crime commissioners are elected in areas of England and Wales to make sure that local police meet the needs of the community.\n\nThey are responsible for:\n\nhow your area is policed\n\nthe police budget\n\nthe amount of Council Tax charged for the police\n\nthe information you get about what the local police are doing\n\nappointing and dismissing the chief constable (the most senior police officer for the area)"
