It is one of the key roles in any local party.\n\nThe Chair ensures the local party is working to an agreed vision and development plan. The Chair is accountable for ensuring the local party meets legal and party requirements and is, along with the Treasurer, one of the two signatories on the local party accounts.\n\nKey tasks\n\nThe role of Chair can vary considerably, depending on the size of the local party, level of activity, skill set of officer team and the culture and tradition of your team.\n\nIn smaller local parties, the Chair may carry out a fair amount of the work themselves; in larger parties, the role may be more of an enabler, facilitator, manager or leader of an officer team.\n\nNevertheless, there are some common responsibilities.\n\nSkills & attributes\n\nBeing a Chair can be hard work, it can be fun, and it can be hugely rewarding. The key skills you will need to use are:\n\nOrganisation\n\nInfluencing\n\nPeople management\n\nMediation\n\nPublic speaking\n\nLeadership\n\nChairs are elected each year at your local party's AGM. Any member of your local party can stand to be the Chair.\n\nYou can hold the post for a maximum of three consecutive years."
