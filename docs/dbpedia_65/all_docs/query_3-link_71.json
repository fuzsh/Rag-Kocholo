        "text": "To me, being black is having the world tell you who you're supposed to be before you've had a chance to introduce yourself. It‚Äôs knowing that you'll start many interactions on the backfoot because of people's mis/pre-conceptions about who you are, where you've come from, and how you've got to where you are today. It's the fact these preconceptions are all-too-often inaccurate, negative and rooted in age-old stereotypes. It's having to accept that you'll have to keep navigating these for the rest of your life - regardless of what you do or achieve. It's seeing the meaningful and positive contributions that most black people have made, will make, or continue to make to this country treated as 'exceptions to the rule' of what black people are 'really' like. ‚úç This blog is all about experiences of being told, directly and indirectly, how being a black man has shaped how I'm seen by different people. Some examples include: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Having successes explained as the result of [insert stereotype and/or criticism of political correctness] 2Ô∏è‚É£ Being told routinely that being black is not just the colour of your skin or heritage, it's about showing 'specific behaviours' that everyone I've ever met has defined differently. 3Ô∏è‚É£ The general acceptance that people with black skin will 'naturally' have worse educational and/or employment outcomes than their peers, because of one 'inherent cultural issue' or another. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Being asked by strangers if I sell drugs or know where they could buy them. Massive thanks to those of you who've taken the time to read these over the past few weeks. Let me know what you think of this one!\n\n\"What's the difference between a black man and a bench? A bench can support a family!\" I was 10, maybe 11, when I first heard this joke from a classmate in primary school. At the time, I was too young to fully comprehend how sinister it was or know how to respond. It's something that no child should ever have to hear or feel empowered to say. Looking back, this was just one of innumerable moments where I've been made to feel like I don't fully belong that'll stick with me for the rest of my life. Although these moments have gotten more subtle as I've got older, they've been brought on similar feelings of embarrassment, discomfort and insecurity. ‚úç This 3rd blog post below is all about how (un)welcome I've often been made to feel, simply because of the colour of my skin. It's about the experiences that have shaped my sense of belonging, such as... 1Ô∏è‚É£ Being told that you're their first 'black friend', rather than just a friend. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Being the only one in the room. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Being an easy target for ridicule and anger for no fault of your own. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Having your sense of belonging policed by people telling you what you can, can‚Äôt and never will be. 5Ô∏è‚É£ It‚Äôs being told you‚Äôre only there because you ‚Äòtick the right boxes‚Äô. 6Ô∏è‚É£ The fact that no matter how comfortable you feel, another unwelcome reminder that you‚Äôre ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô is usually just around the corner. As always, I hope you find this interesting and do let me know what you think.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the pressure of always being seen as a spokesperson for, and representative of, an entire race almost everywhere you go - whether you like it or not\" The blog (attached below) is an attempt to shed light on the experiences that led me to believe I had to 'perform to survive'. By perform, I mean consciously or unconsciously presenting inauthentic versions of myself to help navigate whatever environment I found myself in. The experience I've written about profoundly shaped how I've acted, used my voice and interacted with others. Whether it was exaggerating, downplaying, denying or even ignoring things about certain myself, I did it all to 'help' get to where I felt I needed to be. Where does this all come from? As a child, through my own experiences and those of people around me, I learnt that: 1Ô∏è‚É£ People would (often unconsciously) speak to me, see me and treat me differently in big or small ways because of my skin colour, and 2Ô∏è‚É£ Changing how I spoke and behaved was a way to slightly alter people‚Äôs perceptions of me, make myself ‚Äòstand out‚Äô less, become more ‚Äòpalatable‚Äô, and reduce some of the more direct challenges I‚Äôd otherwise have faced. To me, it felt easier to change myself than to try and change the status quo. I became a chameleon. I played whatever ‚Äòrole‚Äô was needed to help me navigate the space I was in more easily. At the drop of a hat, I would and could do things like: üó£ Significantly change my accent, tone and choice of words ü§• Outright lie about things I do and don‚Äôt like or have an interest in üò∂ Hold my tongue and not speak up against things I found offensive üòÅ Smile excessively to mask discomfort and/or to put people at ease ‚ùå Present an incredibly narrow and sanitised version of who I am, my beliefs and my background to most people Yes, denying core aspects of who I was was a deeply painful and uncomfortable experiences at times, and negatively impacted how I saw myself. But, for a long time I genuinely believed it was a price worth paying to avoid being ostracised, judged, overlooked for opportunities, treated as lesser, targeted, labelled as a ‚Äòproblem‚Äô for being my authentic self. It was the lesser of two evils. Now, I'm far less interested in taking the path of least resistance. By presenting a censored and inaccurate version of myself, I was avoiding difficult conversations with myself and others. Where I was given 'acceptance', it was wholly artificial and not based on who I really am. I was cheating myself. Whilst I don't speak up anywhere near as much as I wish I had the confidence to do, I'm the most consistent in how I present myself that I've ever been and strongly believe that should have to change who they are just to be taken more seriously or feel welcome. Whoever and wherever you are, try your best to be your authentic self and make as effort to create environments where others feel are to do the same! Anyway, please give the blog below a read and let me know what you think! üòä\n\n‚ÄúHere we go again, playing the race card!‚Äù How it feels to be a black person in this country is a question that‚Äôs always been on my mind and one that I‚Äôve been forced to reflect on a lot more in recent times. Until now, whether someone has asked me this question or I've asked myself, I‚Äôve never really been able to give a response I‚Äôm satisfied with. Why? Because it's felt impossible to coherently capture complexities, nuances, caveats and contradictions from a personal, shared and intergenerational experiences. Moreover, it's felt deeply uncomfortable to give a response that is true to who I am and leaves nothing unsaid, regardless of the audience. Over the next few weeks, I‚Äôll be sharing a series of blogs which attempt to answer this question by highlighting the peaks and troughs of my experience as a black man in the UK. Rather than telling stories about specific experiences, I've tried to showcase the persistent patterns of how the world has interacted with and treated to me - regardless of what I've done or achieved. I want to be very clear that what I share is ONLY my perspective and should not be seen as a definitive or universal black experience. Yes, my views have been shaped by those around me but I am not in a position to speak on anyone‚Äôs behalf other than my own. We are all individuals with unique stories, diverse cultural backgrounds and divergent perspectives. Why does this matter so much to me? I am not doing this to get sympathy. I have no use for that anymore. I'm doing this because I‚Äôve reached a point in life where I‚Äôm far less afraid to be outspoken, and recognise that the most uncomfortable conversations are often those with the most value and impact. As the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass said, ‚Äúif there is no struggle, there is no progress‚Äù. So no matter how painful it's been writing this, or how scary it feels to share this - it's worth it without a doubt. To those of you who read what I share, I hope what I write can: üìà Raise awareness, educate and make you think. ‚ùì Spark more curiosity into what other people‚Äôs realities might look like. ‚úç Provide prompts or starting points for having conversations with people around you. üó£ Revive a conversation that‚Äôs lost almost all it‚Äôs momentum since the aftermath of George Floyd‚Äôs death. üëê Be honest with the world, and myself, about how different life can feel. üéâ Be a small part of a far wider conversation about recognising, accepting and celebrating differences between us all. üîé Be a catalyst for us all to reflect on our experiences and behaviour and take even more meaningful steps to creating a country that is more equitable and welcoming for us all. My only ask is that those of you who take the time to read this let me know what you think in the comments or via DM, if you feel comfortable. I ask because I'm genuinely interested in all perspectives, whether you agree, disagree or want to share something totally different! Watch this space üòä!"
