        "text": "The Government Property Agency (GPA) has submitted a planning application to Darlington Borough Council to build a four-storey government hub to support the ongoing success and growth of the Darlington Economic Campus (DEC).\n\nThe government is investing around £118 million in the project, which is a significant indication of its commitment to sparking economic growth in the town and wider region; according to research from the CBI, every £1 spent in the UK’s construction sector helps create £3 of value to the wider UK economy.\n\nWhen completed, Brunswick Street will form part of a government campus of three buildings, including Feethams House and Bishopsgate House, all located within Darlington town centre.\n\nConstruction of the new government hub is set to begin later this year and be completed in early 2027. The new hub will increase the total number of Darlington-based civil servants working to over 2,300, 1,450 of whom will be located in the Brunswick Street hub. Since 2021, 762 civil service roles have been relocated to Darlington under Places for Growth.\n\nOver 800 civil servants are currently based in Darlington across eight departments, including His Majesty’s Treasury (HMT), the Department for Education, and the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), for whom Darlington is their second headquarters.\n\nThe DBT itself has more than 250 staff stationed there, over 200 of which have been locally recruited. Darlington has been a welcome addition to DBT’s Places for Growth network, which now boasts five other locations, including Belfast, Cardiff and Salford."
