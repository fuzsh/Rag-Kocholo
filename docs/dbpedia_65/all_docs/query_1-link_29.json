        "text": "1. Title and Form\n\nThe Constitution is the comprehensive organising document for the for the Green Party of England and Wales. The constitution can be amended and updated by motions raised and agreed at Spring and Autumn Conferences each year.\n\nThe last amendments to The Green Party Constitution was agreed at Spring Conference 2023 and is outlined on these pages.\n\ni) The name of the Party shall be The Green Party.\n\nii) The Party shall comprise Local Parties. Each Local Party shall be called The {geographical name} Green Party or The {geographical name} Ecology Party or a combination of both.\n\niii) For electoral purposes either the national title or the local title shall be used.\n\niv) In all publications of the Green Party the terms ‘Green Party’ and ‘Ecology Party’ shall be synonymous.\n\n[Three clauses below to add when commencement date for them is agreed]\n\nv) The legal form of the Green Party shall be a company limited by guarantee (from the Commencement Date of that company).\n\nvi) The Articles and Memorandum of the company (from the Commencement Date of that company) will stand alongside and make reference to the Constitution but will not affect any Constitutional Terms or provisions.\n\nvii) Changes to the Constitution, made in accordance with section 20 below, shall not change any of the terms of the Articles and Memorandum of Association.\n\n2. Geographical Remit and Links\n\nThe geographical remit of the party shall be England and Wales. The party shall maintain links with the autonomous Northern Ireland Green Party, and with the independent Scottish Green Party and Comhaontas Glas (the Green Party of the Irish Republic).\n\n3. Objects and Aims\n\nThe object shall be to promote the aims of The Green Party, which are:\n\ni) to develop and implement ecological policies consistent with the Philosophical Basis of the Party as expressed in Policies for a Sustainable Society;\n\nii) to that end to win seats at all levels of government;\n\niii) to organise any non-violent activity which will publicise and further the first two aims.\n\n4. Membership\n\ni) Membership is open to any person who subscribes to the object of the Party, and is not already a member of another political party, other than Green Parties abroad, subject to clause 4(vii) below.\n\nii) Membership shall be of the smallest appropriate Party. Such membership shall automatically impart membership of The Green Party, and, in each of the Regions defined in Clause 5(ii) below, membership of the appropriate Regional Party, once the national proportion of the membership has been paid.\n\niii) The rates of subscription for membership, and the proportions in which they shall be divided between Local Parties, Regional Parties and The Green Party, shall be set by the Party Conference. Following a quorate 2/3rds majority vote of GPEx, they shall be authorised to offer discounts for new members joining on direct debit, of up to a third, for a period not more than 3 months in any calendar year. Membership subscriptions and capitation rates shall be subject to regular reviews as of Green Party AGM 2001. Such reviews shall be carried out on a 3 yearly basis by GPEx in consultation with GPRC. Capitations to Regions and Local parties shall each be a weighted average subscription value per member of the relevant party.\n\niv) Membership of The Green Party shall entitle members to vote on the business of the Party and hold office in it, in such ways as are laid down in this Constitution and Standing Orders made under it, and to receive certain services.\n\nv) A Local Party may institute any form of Local Associate Membership and encourage Associates to participate in its business. The rights of such Associate Members shall be set out in the constitution of the Local Party, and those rights shall not extend beyond involvement in the Local Party. Local Associate Members shall not be considered to be members of the Green Party beyond the geographic boundaries of their Local Party, and they shall not be involved in decision making of the Party at a regional or national level, nor shall they be eligible to either contest, vote in, or nominate candidates for regional or national internal selection procedures. In the absence of any explicit provision in a local party constitution regarding the rights of Associate members to vote or be involved in the decision-making process or selection procedures of a local party, they shall be assumed not to have any such rights.\n\nvi) GPEW will carry out equalities monitoring of members, candidates, officers and office holders. The aggregated anonymised data will be presented to the AGM as part of the Equality and Diversity coordinator’s report. This section of the report will include national, regional and local actions to address issues of underrepresentation.\n\nvii) No member of the Party may be a candidate for any other party in an election for any level of government and no member of another party may be a candidate for The Green Party in any such election except in cases of joint candidacies. No member of the Party may stand as an independent candidate against properly selected Green Party candidate(s). No member may campaign for any candidate standing against a properly selected Green Party candidate.\n\nviii) The Green Party Regional Council (hereinafter referred to as the Regional Council) shall have the power to expel or suspend any person from membership and/or refuse membership to any person for a specified period if in its opinion it is in the Party’s interest to do so. Where necessary to avoid or reduce the likelihood of further harm to the Party, a member under investigation may be suspended temporarily by decision of the Regional Council or those members of it empowered to act on its behalf while that takes place, but no member may be expelled without proper consideration. The Local Party shall not offer Associate Membership to any person who has been expelled from or refused membership of the Green Party.\n\nix) As Green Party members we are committed to attempting, wherever possible, to resolve disagreement through mutual respect and discussion. In line with nationally acknowledged good practice in complaints management, wherever possible all participants in the complaints and disciplinary process at all levels of the party recognise, and are alert to, the value and priority of reaching a fair and early resolution to the case rather than an assumed future hearing. Expelling members of an organisation is painful and should be avoided wherever possible. A diversity of opinions is likely to exist within any organisation, and political difference should not automatically be the basis for expulsion of a party member. Any previous attempts at mediation should be taken into consideration before the decision to expel a member is taken.\n\nx) There shall be a Disciplinary Committee, responsible for handling all complaints of a disciplinary nature which have not been or cannot be resolved at a Local, Regional or Wales Green Party level, or by another Party body formally recognised by the Green Party Regional Council, and where mediation has been declined or been unsuccessful. The committee will comprise 22 members, two members from each region, two from the Wales Green Party elected in accordance with their respective constitutions, and two members elected biennially at the Autumn or Spring Conferences. The term of office will be two years.\n\nxi) Complaints will be considered on the following grounds:\n\na) that a member has contravened the Constitution of the Party as interpreted by Standing Orders Committee (SOC)\n\nb) that a member has made a breach of one or more of the number of Standards in the Party’s Code of Conduct.\n\nxii) There shall be a Disputes and Complaints Referral Group which will consider whether a complaint has been brought on one of the grounds specified in 4 (xi) and decide on this basis whether it should be referred to Disciplinary Committee, to another appropriate body or be dismissed.\n\nxiii) Members have the right to appeal to the Green Party’s Regional Council’s Appeals Subcommittee against decisions of the Disciplinary Committee on the following grounds:\n\na) That on the information before the Disciplinary Committee it was unreasonable for the Disciplinary Committee to find the ground of the complaint to be established.\n\nb) that there is relevant, reliable, and significant information that was not before the Disciplinary Committee that would have been likely to cause the Disciplinary Committee to find that the Ground of the complaint was not established.\n\nc) That the Disciplinary Committee’s consideration of the complaint was procedurally unfair to the member.\n\nd) That from the information presented before the Committee it was unreasonable for the Committee to award the sanction or sanctions it has imposed.\n\nxiv) The Disciplinary Committee and all appeals against it considered by the GPRC Appeals Subcommittee shall be governed by Standing Orders for Party Discipline, which can only be amended by a simple majority conference.\n\nxv) A member giving written notice of resignation shall cease to be a member of the Green Party. A member for whom the national proportion of their membership subscription is more than two months in arrears shall be issued a reminder via the appropriate local party and, if they do not respond within a further four months from the date of the reminder, shall be deemed to have left the Green Party.\n\n5. Organisation\n\ni) Local Parties may be formed by groups of members of The Green Party who shall determine their own constitution, in accordance with bye-laws to be approved from time to time by the Annual Conference.\n\nThe general practice of the Party shall be to encourage the greatest possible autonomy of each Local Party in its pursuit of the Object of the Party.\n\nii) Regional Parties: for the purpose of representation on Regional Council, The Green Party shall comprise national and regional Green Parties, hereinafter referred to as Regional Parties. The areas covered by these Regional Parties shall be as specified in Appendix A of this constitution. Each Regional Party shall determine its own constitution in accordance with bye-laws to be approved from time to time by the Annual Conference.\n\niii) Wales Green Party:\n\na) Wales Green Party shall have such rights and responsibilities and be governed by such rules as are laid down in Appendix B of this Constitution.\n\nb) The assumption of Autonomous Region status by Wales Green Party shall not affect the rights of members within that Region as provided in this Constitution and in Standing Orders, nor shall it affect the rights of any Local Party within that Region.\n\niv) All Local and Regional Parties must register the following officers with Party Office:\n\na) One or more Nominating Officers, with the task of accepting authorisations from the National Agent to nominate candidates in the local/regional party area for elections to any level of government. This person is commonly, but need not be, the Election Agent for some or all elections in the local/regional party’s area.\n\nb) A Treasurer who has the legal obligation under the PPERA to maintain proper accounts for the local/regional party. They must record all donations received and submit to The Green Party Treasurer quarterly reports of donations, copies of annual accounts and any other information required to comply with government legislation.\n\nc) A coordinator or contact person to receive general information from the national party.\n\nd) An enquiry recipient whose telephone number can be given to members of the public.\n\ne) These people must all be members of The Green Party but need not be members of the local/regional party of which they are officials. For example adjacent local parties may share some officers, or regional party officers may do some of the jobs for a local party.\n\nv) These appointments should normally be made or confirmed at the local or regional party’s AGM. Party Office should be informed of them promptly.\n\nvi) When an officer leaves their post for any reason Party Office should be informed and a replacement appointed within twenty-eight days, to enable compliance with the PPERA.\n\nvii) The constitution of each local party should include a provision for winding up the local party. If a local party has not elected the officers outlined in iv above at a meeting held in the previous 18 months then that local party may be deemed to have ceased functioning and wound up. Any decision to wind up the local party will be taken by the GPEX local party support coordinator subject to the consent of the appropriate regional party, after consulting with all members in that local party area and with officers in adjacent local parties.\n\nviii) In case a Local Party is so wound up, efforts should be made by the regional co-ordinator or others to arrange a merger with a geographically adjacent local party. In that case any funds from the defunct party should be transferred to the newly merged one; otherwise such funds should be transferred to the regional party. Capitations will also be paid to either the newly merged party or to the regional party, as appropriate.\n\nix) Each local party shall define its boundaries unambiguously and in a fashion that is determinable from a postal address, either by parliamentary constituency or by local authority boundary; and inform Party Office thereof. Local party areas so defined may cover more than one Parliamentary Constituency or local authority area but shall not overlap, nor shall a ward be split between two local parties.\n\nx) When a new local party is proposed within the area of one or more existing local parties, or an existing party wishes to split, it/they shall be deemed to be brought into existence when Party Office is so informed by the coordinator/contact people of the existing local parties and the regional coordinator as well as by the registration of the new party’s or parties’ officers.\n\nxi) In the case of a dispute of any issue relating to sections (ix) and (x) above within its region the regional party should in the first instance attempt to resolve it, involving GPRC and/or DRC as appropriate.\n\nxii) Members with interests in common may form a group subject to bye-laws approved from time to time by Conference. Members temporarily resident at an educational institution may also form a group. Such groups may be accorded some or all of the rights of a Local Party by mutual agreement with the Regional Council, subject to reference to the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee in the event of any unresolved dispute.\n\nxiii) Co-operation between Local Parties may take any form. In particular, Local Parties may federate for any appropriate purpose provided that such federations are named as in Clause 1(ii). Regional Parties may be one such federation, but federations may be formed at any other level either within or across Region boundaries.\n\nxiv) Joint PR lists involving regional or national lists of candidates that include both Green Party and non-Green Party members are permitted unless prohibited by GPEx, from whom permission must be sought. The selection of Green Party candidates on those lists shall be conducted under bye-laws prepared by GPEx and agreed jointly with the relevant region in the case of a regional list.\n\nxv) Joint candidacies between Green Parties and other parties are permitted unless prohibited by GPEx from whom permission must be sought. If GPEx prohibit joint lists or joint candidacies, then local parties or regional parties can appeal to GPRC.\n\nxvi) The business of the Regional Council shall be governed by Standing Orders.\n\nxvii) Campaigns for regional and national elections where there are single member constituencies shall be conducted by Local Parties in accordance with bye-laws approved from time to time by Annual Conference\n\nxviii) The elections and equality and diversity coordinators on the Green Party Executive will be tasked with working with local and regional parties to promote the training and conditions within the Green Party to enable it to work towards the proportion of female candidates reaching at least 50% in candidate lists in PR elections and at least 50% of General election candidates. Taking into account the need to put forward effective candidates, they will work with local/regional parties to try to ensure that female candidates will comprise at least 50% of those selected to stand for winnable seats. A report on the gender balance of candidates and elected members will be included in the Election Coordinator’s element of the GPEx report to the AGM and may also be reported to the Spring conference if it falls after a relevant election\n\nxix) The Party shall register and maintain registration as a political party in accordance with the relevant government legislation. It shall follow bye-laws approved from time to time by Conference.\n\nxx) No member may be elected to the same post or sit on the same body for more than 5 terms consecutively, nor be a member of the Green Party Regional Council for more than 3 terms consecutively.\n\nxxi) Selection for nomination to the House of Lords shall be conducted in accordance with byelaws approved from time to time by Annual Conference\n\nxxii) The Green Party are committed to providing an open and inclusive environment for activism.

The text of all Interim Policy Positions will be published on the members’ website in a dedicated Interim Policy Positions forum. This will have the same effect as raising a topic in the pre-agenda forum as a necessary prelude to proposing a policy motion to the next Conference.\n\nThe motion put to Conference will be to ratify the text in the form of an Interim Policy Statement, open to amendments as per a policy motion in the standard policy process, with the exception that an amendment cannot be ruled out of order for tending to negate the original text.\n\nPolicy Development Committee will be expected to ensure that the outcome of the debate on the Interim Policy Statement leads to a motion to update Policies for a Sustainable Society in accordance with the Conference decision; that motion will be raised through the standard policy process and will be subject to amendments as usual.\n\nix) Policies included in RoPS may be amended or deleted by the approval of a motion to Conference. In addition, all policies in RoPS should be reviewed by Policy Development Committee two years after their adoption and at regular intervals thereafter.

The officer receiving such notification shall be responsible for drawing up a form of petition and for notifying the candidate in writing that they are doing so and of the charges against them.\n\nc. The candidate targeted for de-selection shall have the right to reply to the charges at the time they are first circulated to the wider membership and will therefore be given eight working days to provide to the relevant officer up to 300 words in their defence which shall appear on the form of petition.\n\nd.
