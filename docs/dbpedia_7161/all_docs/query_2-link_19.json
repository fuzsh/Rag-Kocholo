        "text": "Where you'll study\n\nLyon, in southeastern France, is the capital of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region and a haven for lovers of outdoor activities and mountain landscapes. The University of Lyon 2, also known as Université Lumière, is the second largest public university in France, which contributes to the city’s high population of students. Located geographically and culturally in the heart of Lyon, the university has a rich heritage with a progressive outlook. A recent remodeling effort resulted in modern-style educational buildings mixed among historic 19th-century halls and classrooms. Known as one of France’s top research universities, active projects are happening in some 45 research centers organized by disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Through projects developed by its teacher-researchers, the University of Lyon 2 places research at the heart of contemporary scientific and social issues. It hosts a regular cycle of conferences, exhibitions, and live shows.\n\nYou will take classes at both the Porte des Alpes campus, in the Bron neighborhood, as well the Berges du Rhône campus, in the heart of the city."
