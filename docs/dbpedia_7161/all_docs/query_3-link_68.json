        "text": "David : Sport dans la Ville is more than just about playing sports, it's about helping you to write your resume, building a professional network.\n\nSarah : I love my city. I love Seine-Saint-Denis. I want to put the spotlight on all the talent we have here.\n\nSaid: Seine-Saint-Denis is the youngest area in France. It's a great pool of talent. Today, there's a real paradox because companies say they're looking for specific skills and our young people have those skills, but the connection doesn't happen. Our role has been to promote these skills to recruiters in France, and we're delighted that this idea has taken off thanks to partners like JPMorgan Chase.\n\nSarah: Our mission is to mobilize the best talent in Seine-Saint-Denis to meet the needs of the major companies we work with.\n\nSarah: What was attractive to me about the program led by INCO was to be in touch with the realities of large companies and how to build a business model ..... With the tools and resources I’ve received from the program, I was able to access more opportunities.\n\nDavid : Sport dans la Ville, it’s discovering what we love. Thanks to their support, I’m able to see myself starting my own trade business\n\nAnthony : All these experiences help create a true platform for young people and an environment of trust. That's how we can move forward.\n\nDavid : When we have a mentor who takes the time to listen to us, we are motivated to stay in school and build a career.\n\nSaid : Once we showed what we could achieve, other French companies also wanted to get involved. And that's the virtuous circle we started with JPMorgan Chase.\n\nSarah I'd like to be the role model that allows them to realize all their dreams.\n\nDavid If I can do it, anyone can do it.\n\nSaid We’ve proven it works. It's now time to take it to the next level."
