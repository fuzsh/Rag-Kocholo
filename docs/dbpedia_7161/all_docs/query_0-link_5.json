        "text": "Paris is the city of romance par excellence, the fashion capital and the best example of French art de vivre.\n\nParis is the city of romance par excellence, the fashion capital and the best example of French art de vivre.\n\nExploring Paris is an essential rite of passage for anyone who decides to learn French and get to know France. There are so many things to do and see in Paris that, however long you stay, it won't seem long enough. You can climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower to enjoy breathtaking views of the city, wander along the Champs-Elysées, visit the Louvre, have fun at Disneyland Paris, go shopping or window-shopping in the stores of Le Marais and the Place des Vosges.\n\nEnjoying an ice-cream or macaroons on a terrace, enjoying the parks and gardens, seeing a musical or taking part in an Escape Game are all things you can do in the capital. Paris is also a city of sport which is renowned for football (PSG) and tennis (Roland Garros and Paris-Bercy tournaments). Montmartre is the setting of Amélie, and will captivate you with its preserved authenticity. This district, which resembles a village with its paved streets, its portraitists and bistros is an absolute must-see.\n\nHow much do things cost ?\n\nGastronomic bistros and street food will satisfy your appetite. Paris has countless food options (sandwich shops, take-aways etc.). For a pizza, budget for around €8-12. For a starter, main and dessert, it all depends on the restaurant and district but you will need to shell out around €15-20. In terms of going out, a movie ticket costs €9 on average.\n\nFor shopping, the department stores on Boulevard Haussmann are the place to be. There are sales twice a year: usually for a month in January and a month at the end of June.\n\nParis, a mobile town\n\nIn terms of internet access, there are many internet cafés and free wifi in public places (libraries, parks etc.). In terms of transport, the métro (subway) and RER (regional train network) run between 6 a.m. and 1 a.m. At night, the Noctilien (night bus) runs from 0:30 to 5:30 a.m. As for taxis, they run 24 hours a day.\n\nThere are pay-per-use toilets as well as public toilets called \"sanisettes\" in all districts. In all there are 400 of these and they are free."
