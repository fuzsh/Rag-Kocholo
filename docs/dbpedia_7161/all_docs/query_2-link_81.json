        "text": "The Constitution of 4 October 1958 governs the functioning of the institutions of the Fifth Republic.\n\nThe Constitution has been revised several times, for example pertaining to the election of the President of the French Republic by direct universal suffrage (1962); the establishment of the Economic and Monetary Union; the equal access of men and women to elected offices and functions; the recognition of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (1999); the reduction of the presidential term (2000); and, most recently, to the modifications made following the adoption of the Charter for the Environment (2005).\n\nThe President of the Republic\n\nThe Head of State is elected for five years by direct universal suffrage (five-term mandate established following the referendum of 24 September 2000).\n\nEmmanuel Macron was elected eighth President of the French Republic on 7 May 2017.\n\nThe President of the Republic appoints the Prime Minister, who proposes the members of government to the President, who then appoints them (Article 8 of the Constitution).\n\nThe President chairs the Council of Ministers, enacts laws and is the head of the armed forces. The President can dissolve the National Assembly, and, in the event of serious crisis, exercise emergency powers (Article 16 of the Constitution).\n\nFor further information:\n\nThe presidential function in the Constitution\n\nPowers and responsibilities of the President of the Republic\n\nThe President of the Republic: Four questions answered\n\nThe Constitutional Council\n\nThe Constitutional Council is a jurisdictional institution. It has nine members. A special aspect of the Constitutional Council is the application of its decisions to eminently political matters: this may be ensuring that the law complies with the Constitution, especially as the latter protects rights and freedoms; or ensuring that national elections are organized fairly and transparently (presidential elections, legislative and senate elections, referendums); or checking that the conditions that justify the implementation of Article 16 of the Constitution (emergency powers of the President of the Republic in the event of major crisis) are met or are still met after a lapse of time of one month.\n\nSince Article 61-1, created by constitutional review of 23 July 2008, took effect, litigants may also submit a case to it, upon referral by the Conseil d’État or Court of Cassation, on the constitutionality of legislative provisions already enacted.\n\nFor further information:\n\nwww.conseil-constitutionnel.fr\n\nThe Prime Minister and the Government\n\nThe Prime Minister\n\nThe Prime Minister is accountable to the Parliament (Article 20 of the Constitution). He/she directs the actions of the Government action and ensures the implementation of legislation (Article 21 of the Constitution).\n\nThe Government and its make-up\n\nThe ministers are appointed by the President of the Republic, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister (Article 8 of the Constitution).\n\nUnder the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Government determines and conducts the nation’s policies.\n\nThe Government is made up of the Prime Minister, ministres d’État, full ministers, ministers delegate, ministers of state and high commissioners. The purview, competences, responsibilities and tasks of each minister are not fixed, unlike in other countries such as the United States. They are freely determined by the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic: as such, the team can be shaped to take into account current political balances, as well as the priorities they intend to implement.\n\nFor further information:\n\nwww.gouvernement.fr\n\nThe justice system\n\nFrance’s judicial authorities, which safeguard individual freedom (Article 66 of the Constitution), are divided into distinct entities between the legal jurisdictions responsible for settling disputes between individuals, and the administrative jurisdictions for disputes between citizens and the public authorities.\n\nJudicial order includes two types of jurisdictions.\n\nCivil jurisdictions:\n\nOrdinary jurisdictions (tribunal de grande instance/regional court) and specialized jurisdictions (tribunal d’instance/regional court, tribunal de commerce/commercial court, tribunal des affaires de sécurité sociale/social security affairs court and the Conseil des prud'hommes/employment tribunal, which settles disputes between employees and employers).\n\nCriminal jurisdictions:\n\nThese jurisdictions deal with three levels of offences:\n\nminor offences judged by the local criminal court (tribunal de police);\n\noffences judged by the criminal court (tribunal correctionnel);\n\ncrimes judged by the assize court (cour d’assises).\n\nThere is also a specific jurisdiction that deals with both civil and criminal matters: the children’s court.\n\nThe Court of Cassation, the highest judicial body, is responsible for examining appeals submitted against judgments handed down by the courts of appeal.\n\nAt the top of the administrative jurisdictions is the Conseil d’État, which is the court of last resort to judge the legality of administrative acts. It is also consulted for opinion by the Government concerning bills and certain draft decrees.\n\nFor further information:\n\nwww.justice.gouv.fr\n\nwww.conseil-etat.fr"
