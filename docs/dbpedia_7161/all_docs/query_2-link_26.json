        "text": "The iconic posters for the Paris 2024 Games were revealed on 4 March 2024 at Musée d’Orsay. Designed to illustrate the Games which they represent, the posters are a tradition: since the Stockholm Games in 1912, every Organising Committee has highlighted its symbols through them.\n\nThe Paris 2024 posters were created in conjunction with French illustrator Ugo Gattoni. With their rich details, they are the dream-like portrayal of a stadium-city, echoing our slogan “Games Wide Open” and reflecting our project’s ambition: to bring sport into the city.\n\nA STADIUM-CITY FOR “GAMES WIDE OPEN”\n\nThe Paris 2024 posters depict a fantasy city that also serves as a gigantic stadium, within which sit the capital’s monuments, symbols of France, various Paris 2024 competition venues and several different sports and key figures. This spectacular landscape invites spectators to dive in and discover an entire range of different details and miniature scenes that, combined, form a fascinating and extremely colourful whole.\n\nTWO COMPLEMENTARY POSTERS\n\nThe Paris 2024 posters were created using a diptych design to bring together Olympism and Paralympism. For the first time in the history of the Summer Games, the Olympic and Paralympic posters were designed together: each one can work independently, while combining to form one seamless united image that tells the overall story of Paris 2024. By uniting in this way, they highlight and celebrate the shared ambition of Paris 2024 for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games: one emblem, one slogan, one Team France!\n\nVarious elements, symbols and values representing Paris 2024, Olympism and Paralympism are featured on the posters:\n\nSymbols of the Games (Olympic rings, the Agitos, Stoke Mandeville, the Olympic motto, medals, etc.).\n\nDRAWN BY UGO GATTONI\n\nTo meet the major challenge of representing the rich and varied features of the Paris 2024 project within a single piece, Paris 2024 called on artist Ugo Gattoni to visualise the enterprise through a spectacular image.\n\nUgo Gattoni is a French illustrator born in Paris in 1988. He is renowned worldwide for his style and various creations, which have enabled him to work with leading French luxury houses. His characteristic style is marked by fantasy, surrealism, and the profusion of details. His drawings feature giant elements alongside tiny ones, and spectators are invited to lose themselves in the many different micro-stories that they tell.\n\nTo create the posters, Gattoni first embraced the vision and universe of Paris 2024, enabling him to successfully illustrate the soul of these Games. Gattoni spent more than 2,000 hours across six months of intense work producing the designs.\n\nON SALE FROM 5 MARCH\n\nAn outstanding collectors’ piece, the Paris 2024 posters will be available in several formats from 5 March with prices starting at €20. They will initially be released for sale on the online store and in the seven Paris 2024 official stores, as well as in the store at Musée d’Orsay. The posters will also be available at FNAC stores and in supermarkets at a later date."
