However, on taking up 'normal residence' in Ireland you must either exchange your driving licence or apply for a driving licence in Ireland. You are considered to be normally resident in Ireland if, because of personal and occupational ties, you usually live here for at least 185 days in each calendar year. Ireland has agreements with certain countries/states that designates them as recognised states for the purposes of driving licence exchange. We are engaging with a number of countries/states to increase this list. You can view a list of recognised states here.\n\nWhere you are a licence holder under 21 years in respect of C or CE categories, and under 24 years in respect of D or DE categories you must hold a CPC qualification to obtain these categories on your driving licence exchange. To do this you must first exchange your foreign driving licence and obtain other category entitlements. Then complete CPC and add the C and CE, or D and DE categories to your Irish driving licence where applicable, provided it is within one year of driving licence exchange.\n\nYou can exchange a licence from a recognised state online or in person at an NDLS centre.\n\nFor details on how to apply online click here.\n\nFor details on how to apply in person at an NDLS centre click here.\n\nAustralia\n\nCanada, Alberta Province\n\nCanada, British Columbia Province\n\nCanada, Manitoba Province\n\nCanada, New Brunswick Province\n\nCanada, Newfoundland & Labrador Province\n\nCanada, Ontario Province\n\nCanada, Saskatchewan State\n\nGeorgia\n\nGibraltar\n\nGuernsey\n\nIsle Of Man\n\nJapan\n\nJersey\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTaiwan\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nIf you exchanged an Irish driving licence in a recognised state for a driving licence issued by that state, you must submit that licence to the NDLS when applying for an Irish driving licence.\n\nA Recognised State driving licence may be exchanged up to a maximum of one year after it expires.

You are still required to produce your own licence for inspection when hiring a vehicle in Ireland.\n\nAll countries in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) – EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland – benefit from a 'mutual recognition' agreement in respect of driving licences.\n\nYou must hold a current and valid licence from the country you are resident in. EU/EEA licence holders who are resident in Ireland may apply for an IDP here.\n\nThere are two types of IDP:\n\n1949 UN Convention IDP.

In addition, many other countries that are not signatories to the 1949 convention recognise the IDP and accept it in their territory.\n\nYou should contact your embassy or consulate in advance of travel to confirm whether or not an IDP is recognised by Ireland.\n\nNote: even when you hold an IDP, you should always carry your own driving licence when travelling in Ireland, as you may be required to produce this licence for inspection, for example, when hiring a car.\n\nIf you hold a valid and current national driving licence from a non-EU country or non-recognised state, you may drive in Ireland for the duration of your temporary visit (up to 12 months), (for example, if you hold a valid current licence from the United States), and you hold an international driving permit from your own country, you may drive in Ireland for the duration of your temporary visit (up to 12 months).\n\nOn taking up residence you should apply for an Irish driving licence but if you cannot exchange your foreign licence, you will need to go through the learning to drive process. You must first pass a driver theory test, apply for a learner permit, complete a course of Essential Driver Training (EDT) and pass your driving test in Ireland.\n\nOn 21 January 2019 the RSA introduced a reduced EDT programme for foreign licence holders that cannot exchange their licence in Ireland. These drivers can apply to avail of reduced EDT, where they are now required to undertake a minimum of six rather than twelve driving lessons. They can also apply to be exempted from the usual six month waiting period before first time learner permit holders can sit a driving test.\n\nIf you pass your driving test, you can then apply for a full Irish driving licence. Please see requirements on how to apply for a first time Learner Permit.\n\nPlease note: Once you obtain an Irish learner permit, this will take precedence over your full foreign driving licence and all rules and regulations pertaining to the holder of a learner permit applies / e.g., display of “L” plates, must be accompanied etc.,\n\nFor more information on reduced EDT program please click here and for an application form to apply for reduced EDT and exemption of 6 months waiting period please click here.\n\nYou can apply for a driving test as follows:\n\nApply online\n\nDownload application form in English (PDF) or Irish (PDF) and send via post\n\nIn Ireland you must hold a Learner Permit for six months before applying for your test however a holder of a current full driving licence in the same category from another country (jurisdiction) for more than six months may apply for exemption from this requirement."
