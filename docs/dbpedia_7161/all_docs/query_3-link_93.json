        "text": "The warring sides in Yemen are swapping hundreds of prisoners - a move which has built hopes for a permanent ceasefire between the Saudi-backed government forces and the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.\n\nThe eight year-long civil war has led to the deaths of thousands of Yemenis, and created a major humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn 2011, a popular uprising in Yemen forced its long-standing authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.\n\nHowever, the new president was overwhelmed with Yemen's economic problems, and security problems such as attacks by jihadists. Furthermore, most of Yemen's armed forces felt more loyalty to the ousted president than they did to Mr Hadi.\n\nYemen's neighbour Saudi Arabia was alarmed by the prospect of the Houthis taking control of Yemen, fearing it would become a satellite of Saudi Arabia's rival, Iran.\n\nIn March 2015, it and other Arab states began an air campaign aimed at ousting the Houthis and restoring Mr Hadi's government.\n\nThe coalition received logistical and intelligence support from the US, UK and France.\n\nIn August 2015, coalition ground troops landed in the port city of Aden and drove the Houthis out of the south of Yemen. However, they could not dislodge them from Sanaa or the north of the country.\n\nYemen's official government is now in Aden, while President Hadi himself is based in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Houthis allied with the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to form a \"political council\" to govern the area under their control. However, in December 2017, Saleh broke with the Houthis and called for his followers to fight them. Saleh was killed and the Houthis defeated his forces.\n\nIn 2018, the Saleh loyalists joined the Saudi-led coalition. Together, they launched a major offensive against the Houthis to recapture the Red Sea city of Hudaydah. The port there is the principal lifeline for millions of Yemenis at risk of famine.\n\nAfter six months of fierce fighting, the two sides agreed a truce in the city.\n\nIn 2021, the Houthis launched an attack on Marib, the government's last stronghold in the north and the centre of an oil-rich province.\n\nFighting escalated in March this year across the province, forcing thousands of people to flee their homes.\n\nThe Houthis have attacked targets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE with ballistic missiles and drones, targeting sites including oil installations but also injuring civilians.\n\nSaudi and US officials have accused Iran of smuggling weapons such as drones to the Houthis, in violation of a UN arms embargo. Iran has denied the allegation.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition has carried out thousands of air strikes which have killed tens of thousands of people, according to the UN.\n\nThese include \"double tap\" attacks, in which the first strike hits a group of enemy troops and the second one hits the people who go to their rescue.\n\nThe UN says both sides in the civil war may have committed war crimes. Both sides deny the allegation.\n\nThe UN estimated that by the start of 2022, the conflict in Yemen had caused over 377,000 deaths, with 60% the result of hunger, lack of healthcare and unsafe water.\n\nIt says more than 11,000 children are known to have been killed or wounded as a direct result of the fighting.\n\nYemen has also suffered from one of the largest cholera outbreaks ever recorded, with 2.5 million suspected cases and about 4,000 related deaths since 2016."
