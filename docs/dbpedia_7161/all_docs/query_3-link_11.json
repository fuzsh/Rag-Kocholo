        "text": "The “big four of fashion” refers to cities that are usually leaders in innovative designs and clothing. The term fashion capital is nowadays used for the cities that hold fashion weeks.\n\nWhat city is the capital of fashion? There are a number to choose from.\n\nParis, New York, London, and Milan are the most recognizable fashion capitals of the world, but sometimes Tokyo is also added to that list.\n\nThis is what put them on the map as the fashion capitals of the world.\n\nParis\n\nWhat is the fashion capital of Europe?\n\nIt has to be Paris.\n\nFashion week in Paris is one of the most anticipated and attended compared to fashion weeks held in other cities. It hosts over 100 designers and designer brands every year, and not all of them are even based in Paris.\n\nParis has been considered the style and fashion capital of the world since the 16th century, and it has been influential in the fashion world ever since.\n\nThe fashion industry is one of the most grossing industries in France and therefore, an integral part of its economy.\n\nThere are many reasons why Paris became the fashion capital. One of them is setting fashion trends. Namely, Haute Couture and the beginning of fashion publications are only the tips of the iceberg of what France gave to the world of fashion.\n\nMoreover, notable French designers became household names in Paris and changed fashion forever. Two of them are Coco Chanel and Saint Lauren.\n\nRead the article about beloved French designer Coco Chanel and her contribution to the world of fashion in this post.\n\nNew York\n\nWhat city is the fashion capital of the US? The trendsetters definitely reside in NY.\n\nParis is not the only trendsetting city in the world. Designers based in New York challenged Parisian couture by introducing sportswear in the high fashion world back in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nNew York became synonymous with a luxurious lifestyle, hustle culture, and big brands.\n\nFashion is an integral part of life for people living in New York.\n\nThis is also the city that was first to host the fashion week, and as such, made history. The event was supposed to shed some light on American designers, but no one could have predicted what would happen next.\n\nThey made history by kick-starting the largest and the most important event in the industry that occurs each year.\n\nMilan\n\nWhat Italian city is considered the fashion capital? Look no further than Milan.\n\nMilan is also recognized as one of the big four in the fashion world. It might not have such a long history as cities like Paris, but the contribution of designers in the 20th century is what made this city a fashion capital.\n\nOf course, Milan is also the host of its own fashion week, one of the most important events for designers to showcase their work and make new trends.\n\nLondon\n\nLondon is another important city in the fashion world. The language barrier (or lack of it) plays a significant role in establishing cities such as New York and London as the global capitals in fashion.\n\nMoreover, London is populated with people from all walks of life, and this multicultural aspect is what made designers who are based in London stand out.\n\nThis characteristic and the recognizable products, along with the sense of style, allows London to compete with the rest of the big fashion capitals. It is what put this city in the 21st century on the map of the fashion capitals.\n\nLondon also hosts fashion week and has brands featuring some of the most influential designers of the century.\n\nShould Other Cities Join in?\n\nHistorically, other cities were also considered fashion capitals of the world. Some of them are Florence, Venice, and Rome.\n\nCities such as Delhi are also on the list among the influential fashion capitals. Still, their fashion week designs don’t get as much media coverage and hype as the capitals mentioned above.\n\nThe cities that host and are notable for being the fashion capitals are located in the west. Namely, Tokyo has only recently been added to the list of fashion capitals as one of the big five in the world.\n\nThis might shed light on the bias towards the westernized fashion designers that dominated the fashion industry for a long time and Eurocentric beauty standards pushed by the modelling industry."
