        "text": "Paris 2024âs beach volleyball events are scheduled from July 27 to August 10, 2024 at the Eiffel Tower Stadium in the French capital.\n\nThe Champ-de-Mars, the park located at the foot of the Eiffel Tower in the centre of Paris, becomes a temporary outdoor arena. Its configuration and location enable spectators, television audiences and athletes to enjoy an exceptional setting between the Eiffel Tower and the Ecole Militaire as part of the Paris 2024 Gamesâ concept to transform the cityâs iconic landmarks into sporting arenas and set the stage for great sporting moments against a backdrop of Parisâs magnificent monuments.\n\nParis is the capital and most populous city of France and the centre of the Ile-de-France region. With an official estimated population of over 2.1 million residents in an area of more than 105 km2, Paris is the fourth-most populated city in the European Union and the 30th most densely populated city in the world.\n\nSince the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion and gastronomy. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century it became known as the City of Light.\n\nParis is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Louvre is the most-visited art museum in the world. The Musee d'Orsay, the Musee Marmottan Monet and the Musee de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Musee National d'Art Moderne, the Musee Rodin and the Musee Picasso are noted for their collections of modern and contemporary art.\n\nParis is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the third-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport. Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Metro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily. It is the second-busiest metro system in Europe. Paris has one of the most sustainable transportation systems and is one of the only two cities in the world that received the Sustainable Transport Award twice.\n\nParis is a major sports city as well. It hosts the Olympic Games for the third time, after doing so in 1900 and 1924. However, it is the first time it hosts the Olympic beach volleyball tournaments. From 2005 to 2008, Paris organized the annual FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour Paris Grand Slam. In 2022 and 2023, the city hosted the Paris Elite16 event on the Volleyball World Beach Pro Tour at the Roland-Garros Stadium, the iconic venue of the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament. Paris hosted the 1956 FIVB Volleyball Men's and Womenâs World Championships, the Menâs Volleyball European Championships in 1951, 1979 and 2019, and the Womenâs Volleyball European Championships in 1951. Every July, the Tour de France cycling race finishes at the Avenue des Champs-Elysees in Paris. The French capital sets the stage for important competitions in many other sports as well.\n\nBecause Paris is not like any other city, it deserves every honour. The Games in the capital city promise a complete spectacle, thought out for the athletes, spectators and television audiences to offer an unparalleled experience. World-class sports venues are in the spotlight for the Olympic Games. In total, 15 Olympic sites make up a compact concept, with 21 Olympic sports (out of 32) located within 10 km of the Olympic Village."
