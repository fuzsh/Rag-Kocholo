We are at the centre of the challenges facing today’s world, and our ambition is to play an active part in the energy and environmental transition of living spaces, infrastructure and mobility, while fostering social progress as a humanist group that stands for inclusion and solidarity. We harness our fields of expertise, our quest for innovation, our business model’s strength and our teams’ engagement to strive towards a goal that our 280,000 employees share: serving a useful purpose and caring for the planet.\n\nWARNING\n\nThe name VINCI or that of its subsidiaries (VINCI Concessions, VINCI Airports, VINCI Immobilier and VINCI Energies) is being used for fraudulent purposes by individuals or organisations offering financial investments (for example, in parking spaces, in electric charging stations, etc.). The VINCI Group does not offer any such investments, and has not asked or authorised any third parties to sell this kind of product, in France or anywhere else around the world. These attempts are fake, and the VINCI Group companies are reporting them to the competent authorities whenever they come to light. If you are a victim of this fraudulent scheme, we suggest that, as soon as possible, you report the purported vendors to the competent authorities and/or report their actions on the French government website www.internet-signalement.gouv.fr. If you have any doubts, feel free to contact us: Investor contacts | Shareholder contacts"
