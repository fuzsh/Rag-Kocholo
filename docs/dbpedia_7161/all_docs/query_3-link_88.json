        "text": "You may be eligible for admission based on the completion of at least one year of full-time study* (or the part-time equivalent) in a bachelor's degree or equivalent or higher, at a recognised university or non-university higher education provider. Applicants with complex tertiary study backgrounds may be assessed on a case by case basis by the admissions office.\n\nIf you have not completed a full year, you will be assessed on your results in a recognised secondary education qualification.\n\nIf you have both a recognised secondary education qualification and bachelor's degree studies, you will be assessed based on your best result, regardless of the order in which you completed them. This means that if your ATAR or equivalent score in a secondary qualification is higher than your bachelor's degree result, your application will be considered on the basis of your ATAR or equivalent score.\n\nIf you're applying for a course with prerequisites and/or additional admission criteria, such as an interview, audition or portfolio, these factors will also be taken into account.\n\nSome courses are not available to applicants who have already started bachelor's degree studies.\n\nThese are:\n\nBachelor of Arts and Doctor of Medicine (double degree)\n\nBachelor of Science and Doctor of Medicine (double degree)\n\nBachelor of Science and Doctor of Dental Medicine (double degree)\n\nBachelor of Arts (Dual Degree: Sciences Po, France)\n\nBachelor of Economics (Dual Degree: Sciences Po, France)\n\nGuide to admission requirements for applicants with bachelor's degree studies\n\nApplicants with a pass average result in their bachelorâ€™s degree studies can apply to courses with a selection rank of up to 80.00\n\nApplicants with a credit average can apply to courses with a selection rank of up to 88.00\n\nApplicants with a distinction average can apply to courses with a selection rank of up to 94.00\n\nApplicants with a high distinction average can apply to courses with a selection rank of up to 99.50\n\nThe admission criteria published above are a guide only for eligibility to apply. Grading systems and calculations also vary across different institutions, and the above grades represent the University of Sydney grading system.\n\nYou may also be eligible for credit for previous study to carry across to your new degree.\n\nInternational articulation pathways\n\nThe University has international articulation pathway arrangements with selected overseas universities and higher education institutions. These formal arrangements can help fast-track your studies by providing you with credit towards your degree. If your institution and program is listed, credit will be awarded as part of the application for admission. A separate application for credit is not required.\n\n*Full time study is a minimum of 48 credit points at the University of Sydney or the equivalent study load at other institutions.\n\nWe may consider the results of a completed diploma or advanced diploma, including vocational education and training (VET) qualifications at that level if it was accredited by the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) or an overseas equivalent at the time you were enrolled, and is accepted by your faculty. If you're applying for a course with additional admission criteria, such as an interview, audition or portfolio, these factors will also be taken into account.\n\nYou can check AQF accreditation with the provider or look for an AQF accreditation symbol on your transcript of results or award certificate.\n\nAQF Diploma requirements\n\nApplicants who have completed a diploma in Australia with a pass average result (or overall result of competent) can apply to courses with a selection rank up to 75.\n\nApplicants with a credit average can apply to courses with a selection rank up to 81.\n\nApplicants with a distinction average can apply to courses with a selection rank up to 90.\n\nApplicants with a high distinction average can apply to courses with a selection rank up to 95.\n\nAQF Advanced Diploma requirements\n\nApplicants who have completed an advanced diploma in Australia with a pass average result (or overall result of competent) can apply to courses with an ATAR up to 76.\n\nApplicants with a credit average can apply to courses with a selection rank up to 83.\n\nApplicants with a distinction average can apply to courses with a selection rank up to 93.\n\nApplicants with a high distinction average can apply to courses with a selection rank up to 96.95.\n\nThe admission criteria published above are a guide only for eligibility to apply. Grading systems and calculations vary across different institutions and countries, and the University will assess and determine the equivalent requirements.\n\nInformation for domestic students\n\nIf you will be younger than 21 at the first census date of your prospective admission, you will also need to have completed the HSC or an equivalent acceptable secondary education qualification before your diploma will be considered.\n\nThe following accept any AQF diploma:\n\nFaculty of Science\n\nSydney Dental School\n\nSydney Conservatorium of Music\n\nThe University of Sydney Business School\n\nSchool of Education and Social Work\n\nSchool of Economics\n\nThe following accept relevant* AQF diplomas only:\n\nFaculty of Arts and Social Sciences\n\nFaculty of Engineering\n\nSydney School of Health Sciences\n\nSydney Nursing School\n\nSydney School of Architecture, Design and Planning\n\nSydney School of Veterinary Science\n\nThe following do not accept AQF diplomas:\n\nSydney Law School\n\nSydney Medical School\n\nSydney Pharmacy School\n\n* A relevant diploma means the diploma is from the same broad Field of Education as the degree you are applying for. If you are unsure if your diploma is relevant, contact admissions.office@sydney.edu.au with the details of your diploma and the University of Sydney course you want to apply for.\n\nInternational articulation pathways\n\nThe University has international articulation pathways from selected post-secondary qualifications at overseas universities, polytechnics and colleges. This includes polytechnics in Singapore. These formal arrangements can help fast-track your studies by providing you with credit towards your degree."
