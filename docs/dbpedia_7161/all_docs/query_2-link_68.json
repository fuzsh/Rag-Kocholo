        "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio â€“ Fencing at the 2024 Olympic Games wrapped up Sunday with an Ohio State alumnus on the podium. Maximilien Chastanet won bronze with France in men's team foil.\n\nChastanet was one of three Buckeye alums to compete in fencing team events this week. Eleanor Harvey and Team Canada reached the bronze medal match of women's foil, while Fares Arfa and Canada finished eighth in men's sabre.\n\nChastanet, who competed at Ohio State from 2015-18, is the third Buckeye to win a team Olympic medal. Jason Rogers earned silver with Team USA in men's team sabre in 2008 and Hannah Thompson was a silver medalist in women's team foil for the United States in 2008. Harvey won individual bronze in Paris, marking the first individual medal for a Buckeye fencer and for a Canadian fencer.\n\nChastanet started the day as the alternate for France but was inserted into the lineup during the quarterfinal match against China. The French posted a 45-35 win over the Chinese, with Chastanet 2-0-1 (14-9 touches). In the semifinals, Chastanet and France fell to Japan, with the Buckeye alum 1-1-1 (13-13). In the bronze medal match, Chastanet was 2-0-1 (14-10) to help clinch the medal.\n\nArfa, who was eighth in men's individual sabre to record the highest finish in Canadian men's fencing history, was part of the Canadian squad in men's team sabre. Canada finished eighth after dropping tough matches to South Korea, Egypt and the United States. Arfa was 1-1-1 (16-15 touches) in the quarterfinals, 3-0 (20-9) in the first classification match and 1-1-1 (15-15) vs. the United States in the seventh/eighth place match.\n\nThe women's foil individual bronze medalist this year, Eleanor Harvey and Team Canada placed fourth in the women's team event. In the quarterfinals against France, Harvey clinched the team's 38-36 victory, winning her final bout 6-3 (with the final three touches), and was 1-1-1 (8-6 touches). Against the United States in a 45-31 semifinal loss, Harvey was 0-2-1 (4-11). In the bronze medal match, Harvey and Canada were clipped by Japan, 33-32. She was 2-0-1 vs. Japan (8-4), winning both of her final bouts 3-1."
