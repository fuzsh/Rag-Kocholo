        "text": "Taxi\n\nVisitors can easily hail a cab on the street, and there are taxi ranks outside major train stations and the airport. Apps such as Uber and Bolt both operate in the city as well.\n\nBike\n\nThere are a number of bike rental services within Paris, including Vélib’ Métropole and Véligo, which allow you to rent bicycles (including electric and cargo bikes) to get around on. Although there are dedicated bike lanes across the city, Paris be very trafficky so cyclists both inexperienced and seasoned should take care.\n\nMetro & Trains\n\nThe network of underground trains in Paris may seem daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, it’s just like any other metro. Most major stations have maps available for tourists. Adults can purchase one, two, three and five-day Visite travel passes for zones 1-3 from €13.95, with kids’ (aged 4-11) passes starting at €6.95. Or you can buy Metro tickets from machines or ticket counters as you go.\n\nPlaces such as Versailles and some of the outermost neighbourhoods of Paris are reachable by train. It’s important to check if your Metro ticket is valid before you set off. You cannot use a standard Metro ticket to get to Versailles.\n\nFoot\n\nArguably the best way to get around Paris is by foot. There are many pedestrian-only streets and alleyways to explore, and, no matter the weather, walking along the Seine is one of the best experiences in Paris.\n\nFerry\n\nFrom landmark boat tours to romantic sunset river cruises, there are many options for those wanting to travel up the Seine and view the iconic banks from the water. It’s advisable to book in advance."
