        "text": "Section 1 – Purpose\n\nThis document provides guidance to federal public sector institutions on how to comply with the Privacy Act and effectively manage privacy risks as part of the privacy impact assessment (PIA) process. It presents key concepts and lays out how an institution may assess its programs and activities, including the legal requirements and privacy principles to consider.\n\nIt also clarifies the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada’s (OPC) role in the PIA process and sets out our expectations of government institutions with respect to the PIAs we receive.\n\nSection 2 – Context\n\nIn the digital age, it has become far easier to collect, store, analyze, and share huge amounts of personal information. Many Canadians have become accustomed to living and working in connected, online networks. And digitization has created new opportunities for organizations to more efficiently accomplish their tasks. As the privacy landscape continues to evolve, the Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada (TBS) policy suite, of which the Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment is a part, may also be revised. Data strategies, open government and “OneGC” are also poised to change the way government works.\n\nGovernment institutions hold much more personal information today than when the Privacy Act became law in 1983. And while more extensive and innovative uses of personal information may bring greater economic and social benefits, this also increases potential privacy risks.\n\nIndividual privacy is not a right we can simply trade away for innovation, efficiency or commercial gain. Canadians agree. An overwhelming majority – 92% – say they are concerned about their privacyFootnote 1, which suggests that having good privacy practices is not just a legal requirement, it is essential to ensuring public trust in our institutions.\n\nWe know it is not always easy. Indeed, it has become harder than ever to know for certain whether information held by a government institution could be used to identify an individual when combined with other information – for example, when combined with information available on the Internet or with information held by another government institution or a third party. This means that more information may qualify for protection as “personal information,” even though it does not directly identify an individual on its own.\n\nIn today’s environment, assessing potential privacy risks is more important than ever.\n\nWhile PIAs are currently a requirement of a TBS directive, we have recommended to Parliament that the Privacy Act be amended to require government institutions to:\n\nconduct PIAs for new or significantly amended programs involving personal information\n\nsubmit their PIA reports to the OPC before implementing a program or activity\n\nDone properly and before launching an initiative, PIAs can help ensure that legal requirements are met and that privacy impacts are either addressed or minimized, before a problem occurs. In other parts of the world such as Europe, PIAs are becoming the legal standard.\n\nSection 3 – Role of the OPC\n\nThe Government Advisory Directorate\n\nThe OPC’s Government Advisory (GA) Directorate provides advice to federal public sector institutions on specific programs and activities involving personal information. We provide advice through:\n\nconsultation\n\nreviewing PIA reports, information sharing agreements, and notifications under s. 8(2)(m) and s. 9(4) of the Privacy Act\n\nconducting advisory engagements\n\nConsultation service and report review\n\nThe OPC is pleased to offer early consultation on PIAs. However, institutions don’t need a PIA to engage with us on privacy issues. The OPC can provide federal institutions with more informal, proactive advice and guidance on programs and activities that may impact privacy.\n\nAs per the Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment, institutions must provide their completed PIA reports to the OPC at the same time they provide them to TBS. However, we encourage you to consult us long before you finalize your report. The OPC is happy to engage in informal discussions and to answer questions and provide advice to institutions early in the development and throughout the lifecycle of their programs and activities.\n\nOnce the PIA report is completed, we review the final version, and provide written recommendations where we identify additional risks or gaps. The OPC does not approve, endorse or sign off on PIA reports or on government programs or activities.\n\nThe OPC reviews all PIA reports we receive. However, we use a triage process to determine which reports will be subject to a secondary review and formal recommendations.\n\nOur triage process takes into consideration factors such as:\n\nthe sensitivity of the personal information\n\nthe number of people affected\n\nwhether there is parliamentary or public interest in the topic\n\nwhether a novel technology is used\n\nwhether the initiative relates to one of the OPC’s strategic priorities\n\nYou should submit select relevant documents, such as information-sharing agreements and summaries of security assessments to the OPC with your PIA report. We may request supplementary documents, in-person meetings or site visits, where needed. The OPC is happy to provide advice and answer questions before and during the PIA process.\n\nNotwithstanding the role of the OPC in the review of PIA reports, accountability for privacy compliance rests squarely with the heads of federal institutions or the official responsible for section 10 of the Privacy Act.\n\nHow to reach the OPC’s Government Advisory Directorate\n\nBy email: scg-ga@priv.gc.ca\n\nBy mail:\n\nDirector, Government Advisory Directorate\n\nOffice of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada\n\n30 Victoria Street\n\nGatineau, Quebec\n\nK1A 1H3\n\nSection 4 – Privacy impact assessments\n\nIt is critical that you determine the legal authority for your program or activity before considering whether you should undertake a PIA. If you do not have legal authority, you should not proceed with the initiative. The advice and direction provided in this document assume you have legal authority to collect, use and disclose information as part of your project.\n\nWhat is a PIA and what is its purpose?\n\nA PIA is a risk management process that helps institutions ensure they meet legislative requirements and identify the impacts their programs and activities will have on individuals’ privacy.\n\nFirst and foremost, conducting a PIA is a means of helping to ensure compliance with:\n\nlegal requirements set out in the Privacy Act\n\nthe institution or program’s enabling legislation\n\nthe requirements of TBS and Government of Canada policies and directives\n\nAdhering to the requirements above will reduce your risk of improper or unauthorized collection, use, disclosure, retention or disposal of personal information.\n\nWhile programs and activities must comply with legal and policy requirements, they should also be designed to incorporate best practices and to minimize negative impacts on the privacy of individuals. For example, you should work to reduce the risk that an individual may suffer harm, such as identity theft, reputational damage, physical harm or distress, as a result of your program’s handling of their personal information. A PIA may not eliminate such risks altogether, but should help to identify and manage them. There is often more than one way of designing a project. A PIA can help identify the least privacy intrusive way of achieving a legitimate aim.\n\nPIAs are an early warning system, allowing institutions to identify and mitigate risks as early and as completely as possible. They are a key tool for decision-makers, enabling them to deal with issues internally and proactively rather than waiting for complaints, external intervention or bad press.\n\nAn effective PIA can help build trust with Canadians by demonstrating due diligence and compliance with legal and policy requirements as well as privacy best practices.\n\nA PIA report documents the PIA process. The real value comes from the analysis that occurs as part of the process of working through the PIA questions.\n\nWhat a PIA is not:\n\na superficial legal checklist\n\na one-time exercise\n\na marketing tool that only shows the benefits of a project\n\na justification for policies already decided, or practices already in place\n\nnecessarily long, complicated and resource-intensive\n\nWhen is a PIA required?\n\nPIAs are required under the TBS Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment and have been a policy requirement since 2002.\n\nA PIA is generally required if your program or activity may have an impact on the personal information of individuals. The Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment requires that institutions conduct PIAs:\n\nwhen personal information may be used as part of a decision-making process that directly affects the individual\n\nwhen there are major changes to existing programs or activities where personal information may be used for an administrative purpose (meaning as part of a decision-making process that directly affects the individual)\n\nwhen there are major changes to existing programs or activities as a result of contracting out or transferring programs or activities to another level of government or to the private sector\n\nThe Privacy Act defines personal information as “information about an identifiable individual that is recorded in any form”. Examples of personal information include: name, address, employment history, fingerprints, medical diagnoses and personal opinions.\n\nYou may decide to conduct a PIA for your institution’s new or substantially changed programs or activities even if no decisions are made about individuals. The TBS Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment encourages institutions to undertake a PIA if their program or activity will have an impact on privacy and there are potential privacy risks that should be assessed and mitigated. While you may not be required to do a PIA in such circumstances, thoroughly assessing risks to privacy through a PIA will help you develop legally compliant and privacy-friendly programs.\n\nUse the Preliminary Risk Assessment section found later in this document to help you determine your program or activity’s potential privacy impacts and to get a sense of the risk level. Based on this assessment you may choose to conduct a PIA even when there is no administrative use of personal information. Institutions should consider each project individually to decide whether a PIA is warranted.\n\nText version of Figure 1\n\nUse this flowchart to help you determine if you need to do a PIA\n\nSTART\n\nDoes the program or activity involve personal information?\n\nIf no: A PIA is likely not required.\n\nIf yes: Is personal information used as part of a decision-making process that directly affects an individual?\n\nIf no: Will the program or activity have an impact on privacy and should potential privacy risks be assessed and mitigated?\n\nIf no: A PIA is likely not required.\n\nIf yes: Conduct a PIA.\n\nIf yes: Is there already a PIA for this program or activity?\n\nIf no: Conduct a PIA.\n\nIf yes: Has anything changed?\n\nIf no: Updating the PIA is likely not required.\n\nIf yes: Update the PIA.\n\nDocumenting the decision\n\nIf you decide not to conduct a PIA, document your decision and the rationale. As a best practice, you should identify and address the privacy impacts of your programs and activities even when you do not do a formal PIA.\n\nOther assessments and procedures\n\nConsider whether you should complete other formal assessments or procedures along with or instead of a PIA.\n\nWhereas PIAs concentrate on privacy compliance as well as risks to privacy posed by programs and activities, other assessments have different areas of focus. For example:\n\nSecurity assessments and authorizations evaluate security practices and controls to establish the extent to which they are implemented correctly, are achieving the desired outcome and whether related residual risk should be accepted\n\nBusiness impact assessments identify and prioritize a department’s critical services and assets to allow for selection of suitable measures to address risks to the availability of those services and assets\n\nAlgorithmic impact assessments identify and mitigate risks associated with deploying an automated decision-making system.Footnote 2\n\nConsult TBS’s policy suite to determine whether other assessments or procedures may be required.\n\nWhat should a PIA include?\n\nThe TBS Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment sets out content that must be included in PIA reports. You should consult the Directive to ensure that your PIA complies.\n\nIn general, your PIA report should include:\n\na description of the planned program or activity and its objectives\n\nan assessment of your program’s privacy compliance as well as its potential impacts on individuals’ privacy\n\nthe measures planned to minimize impacts and to comply with the Privacy Act, applicable TBS policies, directives and guidelines as well as best practices\n\nBeyond TBS requirements, this document outlines the Privacy Act requirements and best practices that institutions should consider in going through the PIA process. The discussion that follows is intended to help institutions comprehensively assess and reduce risks to privacy. Whether you follow the steps in this guide or not, it is our office’s expectation that you meaningfully analyze the privacy impacts of your initiatives.\n\nThe process is designed to be flexible and scalable. The length and complexity of your PIA process will depend on the scale, complexity and risk level of your project.\n\nHow to do a PIA\n\nPlanning phase\n\nDetermine your legal authority for the program or activity.\n\nPrioritize.\n\nBegin with programs and activities likely to pose the greatest risk\n\nStart early.\n\nStart your PIA before undertaking new or substantially changed programs or activities, in all but exceptional cases\n\nYou should begin the PIA process early enough in the development of your project so that it is still possible to influence the project design\n\nFor example, if there are significant negative privacy impacts, you may want to reconsider your approach to the project\n\nIt is best to identify, reduce, and mitigate privacy impacts before they occur, as opposed to finding remedies after the fact\n\nRemember, your PIA report can be an evolving document that you build as project details become clear\n\nYou should analyze privacy impacts throughout your program or activity. The PIA is a tool to guide and document this analysis\n\nGather any published information, business case documents, existing assessments, analysis or legal advice about your project and about privacy in your institution more generally\n\nCollect current or draft technical specifications or system designs to aid in the PIA process\n\nWhere possible, contact other institutions that operate similar initiatives on which they may have conducted PIAs\n\nUse your PIA to support a Privacy by Design approach and help ensure that privacy is an essential component of the program or activity being delivered\n\nScope appropriately to ensure areas impacting privacy rights are covered.\n\nConsider what the PIA will cover, how detailed it needs to be and what areas are outside the scope\n\nEnsure your PIA report clearly describes what is and is not being assessed and covers all aspects of the initiative that may impact privacy\n\nBased on your scope, estimate how long you will need to complete your PIA and the budget and other resources required\n\nInvolve the right people.\n\nWhich stakeholders will you need to consult?\n\nWhen and how should they be involved?\n\nWho will ultimately draft the PIA?\n\nWho will be responsible and accountable for ensuring recommendations are implemented?\n\nKey parties may include:\n\nProgram staff (that is, the person or people responsible for developing and delivering the program or activity)\n\nPrivacy staff, including your Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) group and your Chief Privacy Officer, where one exists\n\nInternal legal counsel\n\nInformation Management (IM), information technology (IT) and security, as required\n\nFront-line staff, as required\n\nPrivate-sector third parties, if involved in the program or activity\n\nThe senior official or executive responsible within the institution for new or substantially changed programs or activities (as per the Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment)\n\nHeads of government institutions or the official responsible for section 10 of the Privacy Act (as per the Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment)\n\nYou may not need to engage all of the parties listed above for each PIA, however, at a minimum, involve relevant program and privacy staff in any PIA process.\n\nMulti-institutional PIAs:\n\nWhere two or more institutions intend to establish a common initiative or to share information, it may be economical and desirable to conduct a multi-institutional PIA\n\nThese overarching PIAs help to paint a complete picture of a program or activity that may not otherwise be clear\n\nWhen different institutions do separate PIAs on small components of a shared project it can be harder to see the big picture\n\nMulti-institutional PIAs help to reduce the chances of gaps or inconsistencies\n\nMulti-institutional PIA reports should clearly set out which party is responsible for addressing risks. Always appoint a lead institution with overall responsibility for the PIA\n\nConsult the OPC\n\nThe OPC’s GA Directorate provides advice to institutions related to specific programs and activities involving personal information, including throughout the PIA process\n\nFor more information, see Section 3 – Role of the OPC\n\nUnder TBS policy, institutions are required to contact our office to discuss any new or existing programs or activities that could impact privacy – whether or not a PIA is planned\n\nAt the end of the planning phase you should have identified the scope of the PIA, the resources needed, the individuals who will be involved, and the timeframe for the process.\n\nThe PIA Process\n\nText version of Figure 2\n\nConfirm the need for a PIA\n\nPlan\n\nConsult (include OPC)\n\nAssess necessity and proportionality\n\nIdentify and assess specific risks\n\nCreate measures to mitigate\n\nGet approval\n\nReport to TBS and OPC\n\nMonitor continuously\n\nRisk analysis phase\n\nAll of your institution’s activities involve some kind of risk. Institutions manage risk by identifying it, analyzing it and then evaluating whether the risk needs to be mitigated.\n\nAnalyzing risk can help you make choices when the options involve different types and levels of risk. It also gives you the chance to identify the most serious and the most likely problems. For each risk, two calculations are required:\n\nthe likelihood of the incident occurring\n\nthe extent of the impact on privacy rights or harm, if it occurs\n\nA PIA’s focus is on risk to privacy – that is, risk posed to the individual’s privacy and rights under the Privacy Act. It is not a general risk assessment. Therefore, your analysis of a risk’s impacts should consider the type of harm that an individual might experience if the risk occurs. For example, is the individual’s reputation, financial status or emotional well-being at risk?\n\nThe likelihood of the risk occurring can range from almost certain (the event occurs regularly) to rare (the event almost never happens).\n\nWhere you have determined that your program or activity may negatively impact an individual’s privacy, there is also a risk that your institution is not complying with its obligations under the Privacy Act. Address legal non-compliance immediately.\n\nPreliminary risk assessment\n\nWhen assessing the privacy impacts of your program or activity, it is a good idea to do a preliminary risk assessment. This will help you determine your program or activity’s potential privacy impacts and give you a sense of the risk level. The more privacy risk associated with your program or activity, the more you will need to analyze and mitigate the risk.\n\nRisk factors\n\nWhen doing a preliminary assessment consider the following risk factors:\n\namount of personal information involved\n\nsensitivity of the personal information involved\n\nsensitivity of the context in which the program or activity will operate\n\nsize of the population impacted\n\nwhether the affected population is a vulnerable population\n\ntype of potential impact on individuals\n\nduration, or permanence, of the program or activity\n\nwhether the program or activity involves the following additional risk factors:\n\nusing personal information for secondary purposes\n\nsharing personal information outside of the institution\n\nprofiling or behavioural predictions\n\nautomated decision-making\n\nsystemic monitoring of individuals\n\ncollecting personal information without notice to or consent of the individual\n\ndata matching (linking unconnected personal information)\n\nText version of Figure 4\n\nPreliminary risk assessment\n\nProgram/activity Your program’s risk level is based on the total of all risk factors. Each risk factor either increases or decreases the overall program risk. Lower risk Higher risk Involves limited personal information. Involves large amount of personal information. Does not involve sensitive personal information. Involves sensitive personal information such as financial or medical information, SIN, children’s information. Context is not sensitive. Context is sensitive. Involves the personal information of a few individuals. Involves the personal information of many individuals. Does not involve personal information of vulnerable populations. Involves personal information of one or more vulnerable populations. Has a minimal impact on individuals (e.g. lower stakes). Has a major impact on individuals (e.g. high stakes). Is one-time or short-term. Is long-term. Does not involve the additional risk factors (see additional risk factors above). Involves one or more of the additional risk factors (see additional risk factors above).\n\nLow-complexity, low-risk programs\n\nAs previously mentioned, the PIA process is designed to be flexible and scalable. The length and complexity of your PIA process will depend on the scale, complexity and risk level of your project. If, based on the materials you have gathered and your preliminary risk assessment, you have determined that your initiative is simple and low risk, you may accordingly conduct a simple PIA with a brief report.\n\nEven a PIA on a low-complexity, low-risk initiative should address all key components in sufficient detail, but you may find that:\n\nfewer parties need to be involved in the process\n\nstakeholder consultation may not be necessary\n\nthere are limited information flows to map\n\nthere are fewer components to describe\n\nthere are fewer privacy impacts and therefore fewer recommendations to discuss\n\nthe final report is shorter\n\nBy consulting with our office early in the process, we can provide guidance on how to conduct an appropriate PIA.\n\nQuestions for high-risk programs: necessity, effectiveness, proportionality and minimal intrusiveness\n\nImplementation of privacy intrusive government programs has underlined the importance of ensuring that the broader privacy risks and societal implications of some initiatives are carefully evaluated at the outset. You should assess high-risk or privacy-invasive programs or activities in the context of their potential impact on our right to privacy. This assessment should include asking probing questions about the need for the program and whether its impacts are in proportion to its purported benefits. Ask these questions early in the PIA process and not as an afterthought once your program or activity is already developed.\n\nIf, based on your preliminary risk assessment, you have identified your program or activity as high risk, you should:\n\ndemonstrate that your institution’s privacy-invasive programs or activities are necessary to meet a specific need\n\nconsider whether they are rationally connected to a public goal that is pressing or substantial and explain this clearly and specifically\n\ndon’t simply reiterate the institutional mandate, for example, \"law enforcement\" or \"border control”\n\nonce the necessity of the initiative has been established, consider the need for each element of personal information being collected\n\nis each piece or category of personal information necessary to achieve the goal?\n\nensure that the proposed program or initiative is likely to be effective in meeting the pressing and substantial goal\n\nwas it carefully designed to achieve the objective in question?\n\nassess whether your institution’s intrusion on privacy caused by the program or activity is proportional to the benefit gained\n\nthe more severe the impact on privacy, the more pressing and substantial the public goal should be\n\nconsider whether there is a less privacy intrusive way of achieving the same end\n\nhave evidence that supports your argument for using privacy intrusive or invasive activities or technologies\n\nis there empirical evidence in support of the initiative?\n\ncan your institution demonstrate that these measures are effective in meeting stated needs?\n\nis there empirical evidence that other, less privacy intrusive means will not achieve the objectives of the initiative?\n\nIf your institution cannot explain how your initiative’s proposed collection, use or disclosure of personal information is rationally connected to a pressing and substantial public goal, the initiative should not go forward. In this case, the institution should review the initiative’s objectives and revisit whether it indeed has the legal authority to proceed. You should demonstrate that your high-risk program or activity is necessary, effective, proportional and minimally intrusive before proceeding with implementation.\n\nText version of Figure 5\n\nRoadmap for high-risk programs\n\nIf, based on your preliminary assessment, you have determined that your program or activity is high risk, follow the roadmap below.\n\nStep 1. Consider the impacts of your program on our right to privacy and other fundamental rights and values at the earliest stage possible in program development\n\nStep 2. Ask key questions to evaluate the necessity, effectiveness, proportionality and minimal intrusiveness of your initiative\n\nStep 3. Document your rationale for proceeding with privacy intrusive or invasive activities or technologies and use empirical evidence to support your argument\n\nStep 4. Ensure high-risk programs or activities are necessary, effective, proportional and minimally intrusive before proceeding with their implementation\n\nRisk analysis by privacy principle\n\nIf you are developing a project that involves personal information, you must comply with the Privacy Act. Your PIA should clearly demonstrate how your initiative meets legal requirements as well as the policy requirements of the Government of Canada. After ensuring your compliance with law and policy, you should then work to further minimize your initiative’s intrusiveness.\n\nAs you analyze risks to the privacy of individuals and propose mitigating measures, we recommend that you assess your program against the principles below. They are based upon the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, which have shaped and largely underpin privacy and data protection legislation around the world. They are meant to provide a useful framework for your analysis. For each principle, determine whether your project complies with the relevant Privacy Act provision and policy requirements, then identify any negative impacts on privacy as well as mitigations. Depending on the nature of your initiative, you may consider some principles in more depth than others. The lists under each principle are also not exhaustive. You may have other questions or measures for your institution. Again, it is our office’s expectation that you meaningfully analyze the privacy impacts of your initiative.\n\nAccountability\n\nRelevant legal requirement: Privacy Act s. 3.1\n\nRelevant policy requirements: Policy on Privacy Protection and Directive on Privacy Practices\n\nWhat “accountability” means: Put someone in charge of your institution’s handling of personal information and develop privacy policies, procedures and training.\n\nQuestions to consider:\n\nWho is responsible for your institution’s compliance with the Privacy Act and privacy best practices?\n\nWhat policies and procedures does your institution have in place to protect privacy?\n\nWhat policies and procedures do you have in place to protect privacy as part of this specific initiative?\n\nHow do you ensure staff receive privacy training?\n\nWhat tools are in place to monitor employees who are involved in managing personal information?\n\nWhat is the process for receiving, assessing and responding to privacy complaints and inquiries?\n\nRisk examples:\n\nIndividuals may not know who to contact about privacy questions or concerns\n\nStaff may be uninformed about how to protect privacy\n\nPrivacy issues may not be identified and shared with the person accountable for compliance with the Privacy Act\n\nMitigation examples:\n\nMake the identity of the individual accountable for your institution’s personal information handling practices known\n\nDevelop and implement personal information-handling policies and procedures for your institution and for specific initiatives, as appropriate\n\nTrain staff and communicate information to staff about the institution’s policies and practices\n\nMonitor your institution’s handling of personal information\n\nDevelop a process for receiving, assessing and responding to privacy complaints and inquiries\n\nLimiting collection\n\nRelevant legal requirement: Privacy Act s. 4\n\nRelevant policy requirements: Directive on Privacy Practices and Directive on Social Insurance Number\n\nWhat “limiting collection” means: Only collect personal information if it is directly relevant to your initiative and needed to meet its objectives.\n\nQuestions to consider:\n\nWhy do you need to collect this piece or category of personal information?\n\nIs the information a genuine “need to have” or a “nice to have”?\n\nAre there specific laws or regulations that allow you to collect the information?\n\nRisk examples:\n\nAn individual’s personal information could be collected when it is not related to or necessary for a program or activity\n\nPersonal information could be collected without a clear purpose\n\nMitigation examples:\n\nHave a clear purpose for collection and collect only that personal information necessary for the stated purpose\n\nUse information that will not identify individuals, where possible\n\nDesign forms and systems so that only the information required is likely to be collected\n\nMake a clear distinction between mandatory and optional information\n\nConduct a data minimization exercise to question the need for each piece or category of personal information\n\nWhere over-collection occurs, appropriately dispose of or return personal information as soon as possible\n\nDirect collection and purpose identification\n\nRelevant legal requirements: Privacy Act s. 5(1), (2) and (3)\n\nRelevant policy requirement: Directive on Privacy Practices\n\nWhat “direct collection” and “purpose identification” means: When you collect someone’s personal information, collect it directly from them whenever possible and tell them why you need it.\n\nQuestions to consider:\n\nFrom whom will an individual’s personal information be collected?\n\nIf you are collecting an individual’s personal information from other individuals or sources, why?\n\nHow is the individual informed of the purpose for collection of their personal information?\n\nRisk examples:\n\nIndividuals may be unaware of the collection, and subsequent use and disclosure of their personal information\n\nInformation collected from other sources may be inaccurate, out of date or incomplete\n\nIndividuals will not be able to update their information if they are not aware it has been collected\n\nPersonal information could be collected without a clear purpose\n\nMitigation Examples:\n\nEnsure you collect personal information from reliable sources\n\nNotify individuals of the purpose for collecting, using and disclosing their personal information\n\nWhenever possible, notify individuals at or before the time of collection\n\nEstablish a process for responding to requests to amend or correct personal information\n\nNotify individuals of the procedures for correcting their personal information\n\nRetention\n\nRelevant legal requirements: Privacy Act s. 6(1) and Privacy Regulations s. 4(1) and (2)\n\nRelevant policy requirements and other references: Directive on Privacy Practices and OPC Guide on Personal information retention and disposal: Principles and best practices\n\nWhat “retention” means: Only keep personal information for as long as you need it.\n\nQuestions to consider:\n\nFor how long do you need to keep the personal information?\n\nIs there legal, regulatory or policy authority for retaining the information?\n\nHow are you made aware when information has reached the end of its retention period?\n\nIn what form and format will information be retained?\n\nRisk examples:\n\nPersonal information is retained longer than necessary for “just in case” scenarios\n\nPersonal information is not retained long enough to allow individuals to obtain access\n\nPersonal information retained for long periods may become inaccurate or out-of-date\n\nMitigation examples:\n\nEstablish minimum and maximum retention periods\n\nHave in place a records disposition authority (RDA) or appropriate interim measure\n\nDe-identify retained information, where appropriate\n\nLimit access to personal information that must be retained, but is no longer being used\n\nConfigure systems to delete personal information once the retention period has been reached or to flag it for review\n\nConduct periodic audits or spot-checks of your holdings to ensure personal information is not being retained beyond established time periods\n\nAccuracy\n\nRelevant legal requirement: Privacy Act s. 6(2)\n\nRelevant policy requirement: Directive on Privacy Practices\n\nWhat “accuracy” means: When you use an individual’s personal

inaccurate information has been shared\n\nRisk mitigation phase\n\nNow that you have identified the privacy risks associated with your institution’s program or activity, you must decide how to respond. Your risk management approaches and processes will be specific to your institution and will depend on its:\n\nmandate\n\npriorities\n\nrisk exposure\n\ninstitutional risk culture\n\nrisk management capacity\n\npartner and stakeholder interests\n\nThe risk level before you take into account existing controls and risk responses is referred to as the \"inherent\" risk level. The remaining risk level after taking into account existing risk controls and responses is referred to as the \"residual\" risk level. You can have more than one measure to address each risk. For example, you may have a policy combined with a training program and an audit function to reduce a particular risk. Ideally, residual risk levels are low.\n\nNot all risks are equal. If there is a risk that your institution is not complying with the law, you must address it urgently and completely. However, even legally compliant programs may not be privacy friendly. If there remains a risk that your initiative may still have negative impacts on individual privacy, you should work to minimize or eliminate those risks and assess whether or not remaining risks are justified.\n\nInstitutions should consider integrating privacy risk management into their broader risk management approach.\n\nAction plan\n\nThere is little point investing time or resources in a PIA process and then failing to take action. An action plan can help you track and manage the decisions you’ve made as a result of the PIA and ensure that plans to address privacy risks are, in fact, implemented. For each planned action, specify the:\n\narea of the institution or particular member(s) of the project team responsible for its implementation\n\nestimated timeframe for completion\n\nYou can update the plan as measures are implemented so that your progress can be tracked.\n\nDrafting phase\n\nOnce you have assessed and mitigated your program or activity’s risks, you will need to document the results in a PIA report. As mentioned above, the TBS Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment sets out content that must be included in your PIA report. You are encouraged to include additional information, as appropriate. The format of the PIA report can also vary as needed.\n\nPIA report best practices\n\nBe specific\n\nAvoid jargon and limit use of acronyms\n\nBe concise – “more content, fewer words”\n\nBe action oriented – what do you plan to do?\n\nUse visual aids, such as tables or diagrams, where appropriate\n\nOrganize your report to assist with readability and reduce the need to re-explain or repeat material\n\nCreate an internal PIA inventory, so that PIAs are organized and accessible for future reference\n\nApproval phase\n\nNext, you will need to obtain internal approvals in accordance with the Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment. The approvals should indicate that your institution’s officials accept the residual risk once your mitigation measures are in place. It is an institution’s responsibility to ensure it has met all requirements under the Directive.\n\nReporting phase\n\nTBS policy requires that institutions make select sections of the PIA report publicly available (as per the Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment). Public reporting allows individuals to have an idea of how government is using their personal information and helps foster trust in the institution’s operations.\n\nPIA reports (or their summaries) should be clear, unambiguous, and understandable in general, but especially once they are publicly available. Institutions should post, at a minimum, summaries of their PIA reports on the institutional website. These may be accompanied by a link to the relevant PIB description on the Information about programs and information holdings page. You may need to rework summaries to protect interests such as commercial confidentiality, individual privacy, security of information or legal privilege prior to publishing.\n\nReview phase\n\nPrivacy risk analysis is an ongoing process that does not stop with the approval of the PIA. You should assess privacy issues (controls, risks, etc.) regularly as the environment changes. In particular, institutions should assess whether the measures implemented are having the intended effect of mitigating privacy risks. Ongoing management of privacy risks can be incorporated into your institution’s overall risk management strategy.\n\nYou should treat PIA reports as evergreen documents. During project implementation, it is a good idea to build one or more “PIA checkpoints” into your project plan, where you’ll ask whether anything significant has changed since you did the PIA. For example, changes in technology or the implementation of other related programs may create new risks that you should identify and mitigate.\n\nFor relatively minor changes, it may be sufficient to modify the PIA or attach a short addendum. In either case, you should clearly note the relevant changes and analyze the implications (if any). If changes are substantial and result in significant new privacy impacts that were not considered in the PIA, you should do a new PIA in accordance with the Directive on Privacy Impact Assessment.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe wish to acknowledge the work of our domestic and international colleagues in the area of PIAs.
