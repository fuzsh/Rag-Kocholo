        "text": "The Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing support HUD’s vision to reduce hazards in housing in a cost-effective manner while protecting the health of children. The Guidelines apply to lead hazard evaluation and control in all federally associated housing. This second edition of the Guidelines replaces the 1995 edition, as amended.\n\nThese Guidelines can be used by those required to identify and control lead paint hazards and property owners, landlords, and child-care center, operators. They offer helpful advice on renovations in older housing, lead-based paint inspections and risk assessments, and where to go for help. The Guidelines also outline what users have to do to meet requirements and recommendations; identify training – and if applicable, certification – required for people who conduct the work; and describe how the work should be done.\n\nThe Guidelines complement regulations that HUD has issued, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and policies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nWhile compliance with the Guidelines is not required by law, a Federal, State, or local statute, regulation, legal agreement, or other documents may require that the Guidelines, or certain parts, be followed.\n\nThis Web page has links to materials related to the Guidelines, including overview slide presentations, tables showing how the steps in conducting lead hazard control projects are supported by specific chapters and appendices in the Guidelines, and more.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Guidelines, please e-mail Lead.Regulations@HUD.gov.\n\nDownload the complete HUD Guidelines 2012 (File may take a few minutes to load).\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAppendices"
