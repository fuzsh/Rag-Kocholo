        "text": "​​​​​What to Expect: FAQs for Commerce Employees and Managers\n\nUnder the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, OIG is authorized to carry out various reviews to \"promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of, and ... prevent and detect fraud and abuse in ... [the Department's] programs and operations.\"\n\nAs part of our mission, we conduct reviews that involve em​ployees, management officials, and affected departmental programs and operations. The findings from our audits and evaluations help the Department improve its programs and operations as well as prevent or detect fraud, waste, or abuse.\n\nThis set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) is intended to give Commerce employees and managers helpful information regarding the nature and scope of OIG audit and evaluation activities, as well as their obligations and rights in connection with these activities. In the interest of transparency, we are providing these FAQs to promote greater understanding of OIG's processes.\n\nQ: What professional standards apply to OIG's audits and other reviews?\n\nQ: What do OIG reviews accomplish?\n\nA: Audit and evaluation objectives may vary widely—a review might even have more than one objective. Objectives can include\n\nQ: How does OIG decide what to audit or evaluate?\n\nA: Each year, we conduct a risk assessment of Department programs. Based on each year's risk assessment, we develop an audit plan outlining the work we intend to accomplish during the next fiscal year. The plan is modified during the year as necessary to respond to unanticipated requests and issues. We may decide to perform an audit based on a number of factors:\n\nUpon receipt of the final report, an agency must submit an action plan outlining plans to address our recommendations\n\nQ: Will the agency have a chance to respond to or rebut OIG findings?\n\nA: Yes, although the form may vary. We usually discuss preliminary findings with agency staff as we identify them during our fieldwork. Agency staff can, and should, work with us during fieldwork to ensure that our information is factually correct and to promptly resolve any issues or miscommunications.\n\nAfter fieldwork, we generally hold an exit conference with agency officials to discuss what we found and solicit feedback. Following the exit conference, we issue a draft report. Under our professional standards (and the particular circumstances), an agency is given a timeframe to provide us with written comments that include, for each recommendation, a statement of agreement or disagreement. An agency can use its response to provide a proposed action or updates on steps already taken to address OIG’s recommendations or to point out areas of disagreement with our findings or recommendations. However, an agency must support any disagreements included in the response.\n\nWe will consider the agency’s response to the draft as we create our final report and will revise the report as appropriate. In most cases, we will include agency comments as an appendix to the final report.\n\nQ: How long will it take to see the final product?\n\nA: While it depends on the individual project, we generally issue a final report within a year after the audit announcement date. However, we may shorten or extend this timeline​.​​\n\n​\n\nQ: What happens when the final report is issued?\n\nA: The head of the operating unit or office being audited or evaluated and any other stakeholders receive a PDF of the report via e-mail. We also send PDFs of reports to staff on the pertinent Congressional committee or subcommittee. Finally, we post a PDF of the report on the OIG website for public viewing. If the report contains proprietary information or other information that is not appropriate for public release under applicable law, it may be redacted before we post it, or we may clear only the abstract of the report (what we call a Report in Brief) for public release."
