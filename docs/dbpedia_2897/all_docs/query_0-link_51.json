        "text": "Hint\n\nThis programme is currently closed for applications. The next call for applications has been delayed due to the current uncertainty over the federal budget. We hope to have more information for you later this summer.\n\nPhilipp Schwartz Initiative for researchers at risk\n\nDue to his Jewish faith, the Austrian pathologist Philipp Schwartz lost his professorship in Frankfurt in 1933. He emigrated to Switzerland and founded the “Notgemeinschaft deutscher Wissenschaftler im Ausland” – Emergency Society of German Scholars Abroad. In 2015, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the Federal Foreign Office chose to name the programme they launched after him: the Philipp Schwartz Initiative. The programme allows researchers who are subject to significant and continuous personal threat in their country of origin to continue their work at German universities and research institutions.\n\nIn the context of the Initiative, the Humboldt Foundation cooperates closely with international partner organisations such as the Scholars at Risk Network, the IIE Scholar Rescue Fund and the Council for At-Risk Academics. The Initiative is financed by the Federal Foreign Office, the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, the Gerda Henkel Foundation, the Klaus Tschira Foundation, the Robert Bosch Stiftung, the Stifterverband and the Stiftung Mercator.\n\nOur sponsorship\n\nThe Philipp Schwartz Initiative enables universities and research institutions in Germany to host researchers at risk on the basis of a full fellowship. Accordingly, host institutions receive funding which is composed of two components:\n\nFellowship amount: Sponsorship covers a fixed-amount fellowship or contractual employment. It is earmarked for a period of up to 24 months; application may be made during the initial fellowship period for an extension of up to 12 months in the framework of a co-financing model.\n\nAllowance for host institution: The host institution receives a lump sum allowance of € 20,000 for each individual sponsored.\n\nWho is eligible to make an application?\n\nApplications may be submitted by the following categories of academic institutions in Germany only:\n\npublic and state-recognised universities\n\nMax Planck Institutes, Helmholtz Institutes, Leibniz Institutes, Fraunhofer Institutes\n\nfederal and federal state research institutions\n\nother research institutions that can convincingly demonstrate their research portfolio and structures\n\nInstitutions that would be interested in hosting researchers at risk but do not have anyone specific in mind can approach the Scholars at Risk Network and Council for At-Risk Academics, which may be able to help find suitable candidates.To this end, Scholars at Risk has published a list of researchers with confirmed risk who are currently seeking placement in Germany: https://www.scholarsatrisk.org/scholars-seeking-germany/\n\nPlease note that researchers cannot apply for this programme directly. Interested researchers should contact potential host institutions in Germany that can then make an application.\n\nWho is eligible to receive a Philipp Schwartz Fellowship?\n\nResearchers who are demonstrably at risk – irrespective of discipline and country of origin – are eligible for sponsorship under the Initiative. At-risk status can be verified either by\n\na residence status in the context of an asylum-granting procedure within the EU that confirms a recognised threat\n\nor a credible threat assessment issued by a third party.\n\nWe will announce which of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation's partner organisations can carry out risk assessments prior to the start of the call for applications.\n\nPlease refer to our handout (PDF) on threat assessments and contact us before requesting a third-party organisation (other than one of the then named partner organisations) to prepare a threat assessment.\n\nIn the case of Afghan and Ukrainian nominees, a self-report on their at-risk status (1 – 2 pages, written and signed by the nominee) is sufficient.\n\nCandidates for a Philipp Schwartz Fellowship must, moreover, fulfil the following criteria:\n\nhave completed a doctorate or comparable academic degree (PhD, CSc or equivalent); in the case of legal or medical doctorates, provide evidence of equivalence to a research PhD\n\nnot be or have been resident outside their own country for more than five years at the time of application; researchers who hold German university entrance qualifications (“Bildungsinländer”) are not eligible\n\nhave the language skills required to successfully conduct their research projects\n\nhave academic qualifications (e.g. publications)\n\nhave the potential to be integrated in the (broader academic) employment market\n\nResearchers who have already received sponsorship under the Philipp Schwartz Initiative or who have access to residence in safe countries due to dual nationality or other circumstances (e.g. marriage to an EU citizen) are not eligible for sponsorship; the same applies to German citizens. Multiple nominations of one and the same individual by various potential host institutions are not permissible.\n\nApplication and selection procedure\n\nKindly note that all application documents must be submitted exclusively via the online portal which can be accessed by clicking on the green button \"Start online application\" in the right-hand column.\n\nWe kindly ask for your understanding that only complete applications, consisting of a submitted framework form and the individual nominations, can be considered.\n\nPlease find the relevant application documents here for your information and preparation:\n\nAll documents are also available in the online portal. Documents marked with an asterisk* can be prepared offline and uploaded in the online portal later.\n\nIn addition, the following documents are required:\n\nDocumentation of at-risk status (threat assessment) (see section “Who is eligible to receive a Philipp Schwartz Fellowship?”)\n\nProof of the research doctorate (e.g. doctoral certificate) or confirmation of equivalence (e.g. in the case of medical or law doctorates) by the head of the institute or department or a document examination office of the applicant institution; if a certificate is not available in German or English, a professional translation is required (including name of translator and signature; no self-translations).\n\nWe kindly ask you to submit all application documents exclusively via the online portal. Should it be necessary in exceptional cases to send documents by e-mail correspondence, we urgently request you to encrypt them in view of the vulnerability of electronic communication and the sensitivity of the data transmitted. Alternatively, you can provide documents via secure download link.\n\nPlease find further documents relevant to the funding in the \"Funding and reporting documents\" section on this website.\n\nAfter submission of the applications and expiration of the application deadline, a multi-step selection process follows. The regular time frame is shown in this graphic.\n\nThe decision on which applications are approved is taken by the Humboldt Foundation’s relevant, independent Selection Committee on the basis of the application package submitted. The selection is made according to the following central question:\n\nDoes the impression arise that from the combination of the\n\nthe concept of the host institution\n\nthe professional fit between the guest and the intended scientific mentor (also with regard to the research project)\n\nscientific qualification of the guest\n\ncommitment of the host institution to the nominated person\n\nconcrete support measures on the part of the host institution and the mentor\n\nperspectives for the time after the end of the funding\n\na promising new start in a scientific or science-related career in Germany, another country, or the country of origin beyond the Philipp Schwartz Fellowship seems likely?\n\nFunding and reporting documents\n\nPlease note: All English documents are provided for information purposes only. Only the German versions are binding.\n\nWar against the Ukraine: support for researchers at risk\n\nIn addition to the main programme Ukrainian researchers are funded through the MSCA4Ukraine initiative. The European Commission has tapped the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, together with its partners Scholars at Risk Europe hosted at Maynooth University, Ireland and the European University Association (EUA) to conduct the new programme for which the EU is providing €25 million in funding. Fellowships are already running and applications are no longer open.\n\nSpecial programme “Bridge Fellowships for Scholars from Afghanistan”\n\nTo supplement the main progamme, the Humboldt Foundation has established a special programme titled “Bridge Fellowships for Scholars from Afghanistan” with the support of Germany’s Federal Foreign Office. This special programme targets another group of Afghan researchers and scholars who are at acute risk, for whom, due to their specific qualifications, the main programme is not the ideal option, which gives special consideration to prospects outside science and academia. Fellowships are already running and applications are no longer open.\n\nFurther information\n\nIn order to support and offer sanctuary to researchers at risk, universities, research institutions and science organisations in Germany, under the responsibility of the Humboldt Foundation, joined together on 20 September 2016 in Bonn to establish the Germany Section of the global Scholars at Risk Network. Until 31 March 2025, the Humboldt Foundation is hosting the section’s secretariatand acting as its central contact point.\n\nThis programme is financed by"
