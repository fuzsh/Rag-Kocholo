        "text": "Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)\n\nFFIEC overview\n\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is a formal interagency body comprising five banking regulators that are responsible for US federal government examinations of financial institutions in the United States. The FFIEC Examiner Education Office publishes IT Examination Handbooks intended for field examiners from FFIEC member agencies.\n\nThe FFIEC Audit IT Examination Handbook contains guidance for these examiners to assess the quality and effectiveness of IT audit programs of both financial institutions and TSPs. Specifically, it includes mention of SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 attestation reports of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as examples of independent audit reports. However, the FFIEC recommends that financial institutions not rely solely on the information contained in these reports, but also use verification and monitoring procedures discussed in detail in the FFIEC Outsourcing Technology Services IT Examination Handbook.\n\nMicrosoft and FFIEC\n\nMicrosoft Azure, Microsoft Power BI, and Microsoft Office 365 are built to meet the stringent requirements of providing cloud services for financial services institutions. Azure provides financial institutions with SOC 1 Type 2, SOC 2 Type 2, and SOC 3 attestation reports produced by an independent auditing firm to help customers meet their own FFIEC compliance obligations. For example, the SOC 1 Type 2 attestation is performed under:\n\nSSAE No. 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification, which includes AT-C section 320, Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (AICPA, Professional Standards).\n\nSOC 1 Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (AICPA Guide).\n\nThe AICPA SSAE 18 standard replaced SAS 70, and it's appropriate for reporting on controls at a service organization relevant to user entities internal controls over financial reporting. This is the formal audit that financial institutions can leverage for third-party reviews of technology service providers when pursuing their own FFIEC specific compliance obligations for assets deployed on Azure. It includes auditorâs opinion on control effectiveness to achieve the related control objectives during the specified monitoring period.\n\nMoreover, Azure has developed an Excel-based cloud security diagnostic tool intended to expedite a risk assessment that a financial institution may want to conduct relative to Azure services. The tool is based on a spreadsheet featuring 19 separate domains that identify requirements set forth in relevant standards and financial services-related regulations, including the FFIEC IT Examination Handbooks. The risk assessment tool is prepopulated with explanations for how Azure complies with requirements applicable to cloud service providers, and can assist customers in meeting their own FFIEC compliance requirements.\n\nAlso available to customers is the Azure FFIEC cloud security diagnostic workbook companion, which offers guidance on the use of Azure services and considerations for customer compliance with FFIEC requirements\n\nMicrosoft in-scope cloud platforms & services\n\nAzure\n\nIntune\n\nOffice 365, Office 365 U.S. Government\n\nPower BI cloud service (either as a standalone service or as included in an Office 365 branded plan or suite)\n\nAzure guidance documents\n\nTo assist financial institutions subject to FFIEC oversight with cloud adoption, Microsoft has published the following guidance documents that can be downloaded from the Service Trust Portal Data Protection Resources - Compliance Guides section:\n\nAzure - Cloud security diagnostic tool\n\nAzure - FFIEC cloud security diagnostic workbook companion\n\nOffice 365 and FFIEC\n\nOffice 365 environments\n\nMicrosoft Office 365 is a multi-tenant hyperscale cloud platform and an integrated experience of apps and services available to customers in several regions worldwide. Most Office 365 services enable customers to specify the region where their customer data is located.

This environment is used by federal agencies, the Defense Industrial Base (DIBs), and government contractors.\n\nOffice 365 DoD (DoD): the Office 365 DoD cloud service is designed according to DoD Security Requirements Guidelines Level 5 controls and supports strict federal and defense regulations.
