The way in which infection control measures are implemented for the handling of relevant patients and contaminated materials is often controversial due to the lack of evidence-based scientific data.\n\nFor risk assessments including data of environmental stability, i.e. reduction of infectious viruses over time in excreta (body fluids) and on various potentially contaminated surfaces requiring infection control, as well as for testing their inactivation properties, we:\n\n(i) validate defined sampling techniques to obtain reproducible results for swabs on different surfaces\n\n(ii) determine persistence of infectivity for risk group 4 pathogens in different fluids and on surfaces for various environmental conditions\n\n(iii) validate disinfection and decontamination procedures for these pathogens.\n\nThe results will serve as the basis for recommendations to adjust safety requirements for high- containment laboratories and provide better evidence for infection control in hospital isolation wards and consequently for patient and employee safety."
