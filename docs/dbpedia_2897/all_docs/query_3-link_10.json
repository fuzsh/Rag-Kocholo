        "text": "The PCRA makes it possible for officers to focus their efforts on the people who are at the greatest risk of failing on supervision and committing new crimes.\n\nThe United States probation and pretrial services system embraces evidence-based practices (EBP), which employ the best available scientific data to influence supervision decisions. A key element of the evidence-­based approach is the use of the PCRA to achieve maximum, measurable reductions in recidivism. Using the PCRA, officers can make informed decisions about:\n\nWhich persons to target for correctional interventions.\n\nWhat characteristics or needs to address.\n\nHow to deliver supervision and treatment in a way that produces the best outcomes.\n\nOn this page, you will find links to two important documents that provide more information about the PCRA:\n\nThe Overview of the Post Conviction Risk Assessment provides an easy-to-digest overview of risk assessment and the use of the PCRA in the United States probation system. You will find:\n\nA summary of the history of risk assessment in the United States probation and pretrial services system and the purpose and development of the PCRA.\n\nA description of EBPs and principles that form the foundation for risk and needs assessment instruments.\n\nA discussion of implementation issues, such as training and certification, and the AO’s ongoing monitoring and research on the PCRA.\n\nThe PCRA Research Compendium summarizes the empirical research on the PCRA to date. This document will be updated over time to incorporate the latest research.\n\nResearch Articles from Federal Probation Journal\n\nThis journal is published each June, September, and December by the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts and presents current thought, research, and practice in corrections, community supervision, and criminal justice.\n\nThe Construction and Validation of the Federal Post Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA) (September, 2011)\n\nDoes the risk of recidivism for supervised offenders improve over time?: Examining changes in the dynamic risk characteristics for offenders under federal supervision (September, 2014)\n\nThe neglected “R” — Responsivity and the federal offender (September, 2014)\n\nExamining overrides of risk classifications for offenders on federal supervision (June, 2016)\n\nThe supervision of low risk offenders: How the low-risk policy has changed federal supervision practices without compromising community safety (June, 2016)\n\nExamining changes in offender risk characteristics and recidivism outcomes (September, 2016)\n\nHow dangerous are they?: An analysis of sex offenders under federal post-conviction supervision (September, 2016)\n\nUsing a multi-level risk assessment to inform case planning and risk management: Implications for officers (September, 2016)\n\nRemoval of the non-scored items from the Post Conviction Risk Assessment instrument: An evaluation of data-driven risk research with the federal system (September, 2017)\n\nResearch Articles from Other Publications\n\nThese articles are from publications not a part of the federal Judiciary and will require an account to access:\n\nThe Federal Post Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA): A Construction and Validation Study (November, 2012)\n\nDoes change in risk matter?: Examining whether change in offender risk characteristics influence recidivism outcomes (January, 2015)\n\nPCRA revisited: Testing the validity of the Federal Post-Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA) (March, 2015)\n\nPredicting recidivism with the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles (PICTS) in community-supervised male and female federal offenders (August, 2015)\n\nGender, risk assessment, and sanctioning: The cost of treating women like men (January, 2016)\n\nCriminal thought process as a dynamic risk factor: Variable- and person-oriented approaches to recidivism prediction (March, 2016)\n\nThe predictive validity of the Post-Conviction Risk Assessment among federal offenders (June, 2016)\n\nRisk, race, and recidivism: Predictive bias and disparate impact (June, 2016)\n\nTime-free effects in predicting recidivism using both fixed and variable follow-up periods: Do different methods produce different results (December, 2016)\n\nAge, risk assessment, and sanctioning: Overestimating the old, underestimating the young (May, 2017)\n\nIs Corrections “Collar” Blind: Examining the Predictive Validity of a Risk/Needs Assessment Tool on White-Collar Offenders (July, 2017)\n\nFederal Criminal Careers: an Empirical Examination of the Post-Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA) (March, 2018)\n\nUsing algorithms to address trade‐offs inherent in predicting recidivism (May, 2020)"
