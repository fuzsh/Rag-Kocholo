        "text": "Welcome to New Hampshire’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM) website.\n\nHSEM is charged with overseeing the state-level planning, preparation, response to, recovery from and mitigation of all emergencies and disasters. This includes natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and severe winter storms, and human-caused disasters, such as nuclear power plant accidents or chemical spills.\n\nYou can be prepared for a similar situation by taking four core steps to preparedness before, during and after a disaster strikes.\n\nFirst, stay informed. You can do this by signing up for NH Alerts, the state’s emergency notification system to receive location-specific safety information. Residents and visitors also should monitor radio or broadcast weather reports to keep track of changing conditions.\n\nSecondly, make a family emergency plan. Sit down with your family members before an emergency happens. Decide how to contact each other, where you will go and identify a place away from your home to meet up if needed. Keep a copy of this plan in your emergency kit or another safe place where you can access it in the event of a disaster. Make sure to include your pets in your emergency plan.\n\nThird, build a kit. Emergency Kits are essential and should be kept in a safe location where they will be accessible during an emergency. Basic emergency kits should be kept in each car as well. Emergency Kits should contain enough water, non-perishable foods and prescriptions to last at least three days for each person in your household. In addition, each Emergency Kit should contain a flashlight, radio, extra batteries, first aid kit, sanitation items, cash and additional clothing.\n\nLastly, get involved. Join your local Community Emergency Response Team and receive training on basic disaster response skills, such as fire safety, light search and rescue, team organization, and disaster medical operations. In addition, FEMA offers online and in person trainings called “You Are the Help Until Help Arrives” and organizations such as the American Red Cross offer CPR and first aid courses.\n\nMore information on these four steps can be found at ReadyNH.gov.\n\nWith your help, we can all work toward the goal of becoming a prepared, ready and informed New Hampshire."
