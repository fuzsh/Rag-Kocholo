        "text": "Editorial\n\nDear GO FAIR community,\n\nMore than three years ago we launched the GO FAIR Initiative, and since then its community has grown tremendously and become an important player in creating an internet of FAIR data and services. We now have national GO FAIR offices in Brazil, France, Germany, and the US, and we see an interest to expand the network of offices. Our FAIR Festival 2021 at the end of June did not only celebrate the FAIR shift in research data management, but also our GO FAIR community and its ongoing commitment as well as achievements so far. We are so grateful to have you on board. If you weren’t able to attend the festival or missed one of the plenaries, you can (re-)watch the three plenaries on our website. All presentations will be made available soon. Stay tuned!\n\nWe are thrilled to see that other countries are eager to join GO FAIR, and have started establishing national offices to support the FAIR movement globally. Austria, for example, launched its FAIR Office Austria on 9 June 2021. Denmark is interested in supporting the development of GO FAIR concepts, training and infrastructures, and so is The Netherlands who aim at contributing to a joint coordination of GO FAIR on the international level as well as starting a national representation. Looking farther East there is China that promotes the FAIR principles to ensure cross-regional interoperability. Communication and cooperation will continue to play a major role within the GO FAIR initiative and in the FAIR movement. The FAIR Festival 2021 has shown how important it is for our community to meet and work on FAIR challenges together. We would like to end with a quote by one of our FAIR Festival 2021 panellists who illustrates this very well:\n\nFAIR is the definition, the essence, of the spirit of Open Science. The FAIR Festival is directly tackling the major challenges deriving from Open Science in a transcontinental manner. It encourages in an impressive way the culture of dialogue between communities making qualified information and data visible, traceable and clear.\n\nPaolo Budroni, TU Wien Coordinator of the Austrian EOSC Mandated Organisation / EOSC Support Office Austria\n\nWe are looking forward to seeing you again after the summer break – refreshed and recharged, ready to pick up where we left off.

Her projects concern the modelling of hazard, exposure and risk of chemicals and materials, including the required data. Since 2019 she has been involved in the Horizon 2020 project Gov4nano. This project aims to develop a proof of concept of an efficient and effective risk governance process for nanotechnologies. In Gov4nano, she is leader of the work package entitled ‘Improving the FAIRness of nanosafety data’ and is one of the initiators of the AdvancedNano IN.Dr Blair Johnston is a scientist at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), which is located in Berlin, where he works in the Department of Chemical and Product Safety in the Unit of Fiber- and Nanotoxicology. His projects are concerned with the risk assessment of nano and other advanced materials, as well fibers and nano and microscale plastics. He is also working in the Horizon 2020 project, Gov4Nano and in the Infrastructure project NanoCommons. In both projects we are working towards the FAIR use of data, SOPs, tools, and workflows related to the health and safety effects of nano and advanced materials. We are also helping to support the creation of the nascent Nano Risk Governing Council (NRGC) which will help to coordinate the activities related to the governance and risk assessment of nano and advanced materials from a European Regulatory perspective.\n\nNational office representatives: Introducing the GO FAIR German office\n\nMeet the team members of GO FAIR Germany: Klaus Tochtermann, Anja Busch and Katharina Kriegel\n\nSince 2010 Prof Dr Klaus Tochtermann has been Professor for Digital Information Infrastructures in the Computer Science Department of Kiel University and Director of the ZBW – Leibniz Information Centre for Economics.
