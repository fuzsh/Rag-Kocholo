        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nThis is not a legal document. The explanations and definitions are not legal definitions. In case of a discrepancy between the language in this document and the relevant legislation or regulations, the legal text in the legislation and regulations prevails.\n\nFor legal information, consult the following documents:\n\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations\n\nSymbols used in this guide\n\nThis guide uses the following symbols to indicate information of particular importance.\n\nWhat you must do to have your application processed.\n\nImportant information that you need to be aware of in order to avoid delays or other problems.\n\nWhere to get more information.\n\nNote:\n\nTips that will assist you with this application.\n\nOverview\n\nApplying for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment\n\nMany persons facing removal from Canada are given the opportunity to apply for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA). Generally speaking, you may not apply for a PRRA unless the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has notified you that you may do so, and given you a Notification Regarding a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment. If eligible and you wish to apply, you must submit your application form and written submissions (if any) to the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Humanitarian Migration office either online through Canada Post’s Connect or by mail at the address listed in your Notification. Read all of the information in this application kit carefully. It will explain the PRRA program, and assist you in completing your application.\n\nHow might a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment help me?\n\nThe PRRA is an opportunity for people who are facing removal from Canada to seek protection by describing, in writing, the risks they believe they would face if removed. Persons whose PRRA applications are approved may stay in Canada.\n\nIf I apply for a PRRA, how will my application be assessed?\n\nMost PRRA applications are assessed with respect to:\n\n(A) Whether the applicant’s return to their country would subject them personally to:\n\nA danger of torture; or\n\nA risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if:\n\nBecause of that risk, they are unable/unwilling to seek protection in their country;\n\nThey would face the risk in every part of that country;\n\nThe risk is not the result of legitimate sanctions (except those imposed in violation of international standards); and\n\nThe risk is not caused by the inability of the country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n\nOr\n\n(B) Whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country (country of nationality or, if they do not have one, the country where they usually lived) based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group; and because of this fear, they are unwilling or unable to return to or seek protection in that country.\n\nHowever, assessment of your application will be limited to the grounds outlined in (A) if you:\n\nHave been determined to be inadmissible for serious criminality because you were convicted in Canada of a crime punishable by 10 or more years in prison, and you received a prison sentence of two or more years; or\n\nHave been determined inadmissible on grounds of security, human or international rights violations or organized criminality; or\n\nMade a refugee claim and it was rejected on the basis of section F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention; or\n\nAre named in a certificate referred to in subsection 77(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\nIf this is your first PRRA application, you are now benefiting from a stay of your removal order. As such, the arrangements to enforce your removal from Canada have been suspended. To ensure that the stay of your removal order remains in effect while your application is being processed, you must submit your application within the deadlines specified in your Notification Regarding a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment.\n\nIf this is not your first PRRA application, you are late submitting your application, or you are applying at a port of entry, you are not benefiting from a stay of your removal order.\n\nWhat if I do NOT wish to apply for a PRRA?\n\nIf you do not wish to submit a PRRA application and you want to leave Canada voluntarily:\n\nComplete Section G (‘Statement of No Intention’) of the Application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (IMM 5508) form;\n\nSend it to the address indicated in the enclosed Notification Regarding a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment; and\n\nReport to the Canada Border Services Agency office that gave you this application kit.\n\nBefore You Apply\n\nPreparing Your PRRA Application\n\nWhich documents will I fill out?\n\nTo apply for a PRRA, you must complete and submit the form, Application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (IMM 5508). All of your family members in Canada who are 18 years of age or older and who are also applying for a PRRA must complete their own Application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (IMM 5508) form. Make photocopies of the form so that each person has both a working and a final copy.\n\nYou may also make written submissions and provide documentary evidence to support your case.\n\nDo I have to include my family members on my application?\n\nAll of your family members inside or outside Canada should be listed on the Application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (IMM 5508). Family members are defined as your spouse or common-law partner and dependent children. A dependent child is defined as:\n\nyour biological child or the biological child of your spouse or common-law partner, or the biological child of that dependent child; or\n\na person who is a child you or your spouse or common-law partner adopted by way of full adoption before the child was 18 years of age. Full adoption means an adoption that severs a pre-existing legal parent-child relationship.\n\nYour child or the child of your spouse or common-law partner can be considered a dependent child if that child meets the requirements below on the date you apply for PRRA:\n\nThey’re under 22 years old, and\n\nThey don’t have a spouse or common-law partner\n\nChildren 22 years old or older qualify as dependants if they meet both of these requirements:\n\nThey have depended on their parents for financial support since before the age of 22, and\n\nThey are unable to financially support themselves because of a mental or physical condition\n\nShould I make written submissions?\n\nWritten submissions give you the opportunity to describe your situation. It is in your written submissions that you can explain why you think that you would be at risk if removed to your country of nationality or former habitual residence. You may also submit documents in support of your written submissions.\n\nHow do I prepare my written submissions?\n\nIn your written submissions, it is important that you clearly answer the following questions:\n\nWhy would I be at risk if I was returned to my country of nationality or habitual residence?\n\nWhat kind of risks would I face and why?\n\nHow do these risks concern me directly and personally?\n\nCould I escape these risks by moving to another city or region of my country?\n\nHow does my situation compare with the situation of the rest of the population in my country of nationality or habitual residence?\n\nBe aware that misrepresenting or withholding material facts may lead to rejection of your application, and the resumption of arrangements to enforce your removal from Canada.\n\nNote: If you have had a refugee claim or a previous PRRA application rejected, you may only provide new evidence, which has arisen since the rejection.\n\nWhat is New Evidence?\n\nNew evidence is evidence that arose after the rejection, or that was not normally accessible, or that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of rejection. It is important that you clearly identify and explain new evidence in any documents you submit (for example, highlighting certain parts of a magazine article).\n\nWhat types of documentary evidence could be useful to support my case?\n\nWritten documents of any kind, such as documents that present facts relating to the alleged risks, may be used to support your submissions. You may also present the written statements of family members, friends, neighbours or any other persons. The following are examples of documents that might be useful as evidence:\n\nMagazine or newspaper articles describing the situation in your country\n\nLegal documents\n\nPolice documents\n\nMedical documents\n\nPersonal documents\n\nWritten testimonies\n\nPersonal letters\n\nNote: Your written submissions and any supporting documentary evidence must be provided in either English or French. If you wish to submit any documents in another language, you must also provide an English or French translation of the document, and a translator's declaration. A translator's declaration must include the translator's name, the original language of the translated document and a statement signed by the translator that the translation is accurate. Documents submitted in a language other than English or French without a translation will not be considered.\n\nDo I need to hire counsel?\n\nAlthough you do not need to hire counsel, you may—at your own expense—be assisted by a lawyer or other authorized representative. See How to Complete the Form for more information on authorized representatives.\n\nNote: It is your responsibility to ensure that the information in your application is correct and up-to-date. If your circumstances change, you must inform us. Decisions made on your application will be based on the information we have at the time your application is reviewed.\n\nWhen must I send my PRRA application?\n\nIf this is your first PRRA application\n\nRefer to your Notification Regarding a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment for information on when and where to submit your application. Pay close attention to the deadline date on your Notification; failure to submit your application by the deadline may result in the cancellation of the stay of your removal order.\n\nIf you are late submitting your application, you must send both your application form and written submissions at the same time.\n\nIf this is NOT your first PRRA application\n\nYou must send both your application form and submissions as soon as possible.\n\nReview of Application Procedure\n\nFollow these steps to submit your first PRRA application:\n\nStep 1.\n\nFill out and sign your application form (IMM 5508).\n\nRemember: your spouse and each family member in Canada 18 years of age and older must complete their own application form.\n\nStep 2.\n\nSend the completed form(s) to the IRCC centre specified on your Notification Regarding a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment, by the date specified on that Notification.\n\nNote:\n\nYou can now send your PRRA application online through Connect.\n\nStep 3.\n\n(If you wish), prepare written submissions and compile documentary evidence.\n\nStep 4.\n\nSend the submissions and documentary evidence to the IRCC centre, by the date specified on your Notification.\n\nNote: You can now send PRRA submissions and documentary evidence online through Connect.\n\nHow to complete the form\n\nCompleting the Forms\n\nUse the following instructions to fill in the form.

We treat everyone equally, whether they use the service of a representative or not.\n\nWhen you appoint a representative:\n\nyou also authorize IRCC and CBSA to share information from your case file with this person in place of you. Please note the representative will receive all correspondence from IRCC or the CBSA, not the applicant;\n\nyour application will not be given special attention nor can you expect faster processing or a more favourable outcome;\n\nthe representative is authorized to represent you only on citizenship or immigration matters related to the application you submit with this form; and\n\nyou can appoint only one (1) representative for each application you submit.\n\nImportant information: You must notify IRCC if your representative’s contact information changes, or if you change your representative, or cancel the appointment of your representative.

This applies to advice or consultation which happens before or after a citizenship or an immigration application is made or a proceeding begins.\n\nIRCC will only conduct business with compensated representatives who are in good standing with their designated regulatory body. For more information see - Find out if your representative is authorized.\n\nNote: If a representative is being paid or compensated by someone other than you, the representative is still considered to be a compensated representative.\n\nAuthorized representatives are:\n\nconsultants who are members in good standing of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CICC);\n\nlawyers and paralegals who are members in good standing of a Canadian provincial or territorial law society and students-at-law under their supervision;\n\nnotaries who are members in good standing of the Chambre des notaires du Québec and students-at-law under their supervision.\n\nIf you appoint a compensated representative who is not a member in good standing of one of these designated bodies, your application will be returned.

However, you might be called to report for a hearing to answer questions about certain aspects of your application. If a hearing is necessary, you will receive a written notice indicating the location, date and time of the hearing as well as the matters that are to be discussed. You may be accompanied, at your own expense, by a lawyer or other authorized representative. This person may only support you and cannot intervene on your behalf.\n\nIf you have previously provided written testimony from a third party, that party might be called to report to a hearing for an interview. You would also be invited to such a hearing.\n\nNote: If you have signed up with our Humanitarian Migration office to communicate with us online regarding your PRRA application and you need a PRRA hearing, we will now contact you through Connect to schedule it. Check your spam folder to make sure you don’t miss the message.\n\nWhat will the PRRA officer take into account in assessing my application?\n\nIn the examination of your application, the PRRA officer will determine whether or not you would face risks if you were to be returned to your country of nationality or habitual residence. The officer will consider the following information:\n\nThe information on your completed Application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (IMM 5508);\n\nYour immigration file; and\n\nYour written submissions and any new evidence that you have submitted.\n\nIf you have had a refugee protection claim heard by the Immigration and Refugee Board, the decision and reasons your refugee claim was refused, as well as any documents completed by the Immigration and Refugee Board in its assessment of your claim.\n\nFurthermore, the PRRA officer may refer to sources of information that are publicly available. The following are examples of publicly available sources of information that might be reviewed:\n\nHuman Rights Package\n\nContextual Package\n\nIndex Media Review\n\nWeekly Media Review\n\nU.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\n\nLawyers Committee for Human Rights\n\nAmnesty International reports\n\nDoctors Without Borders reports\n\nWorld Europa and Human Rights World Reports\n\nInternet research\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. Other publicly available sources of information may be taken into account.\n\nReminder\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that the information in your application is correct and up-to-date. If your circumstances change, you must inform us. Decisions made on your application will be based on the information we have at the time your application is reviewed. Updated information should be sent to the IRCC Humanitarian Migration office online through Connect, by fax at 604-666-1116, or by mail at:\n\nIRCC - Humanitarian Migration - Vancouver\n\n#300 - 800 Burrard Street\n\nVancouver, BC\n\nV6Z 0B6\n\nNote: The Humanitarian Migration Office will not provide an acknowledgement of receipt letter.\n\nIf the officer's assessment is that you would not face risk, your application will be rejected and you will have to leave Canada.\n\nIf your application is accepted, you will be able to stay in Canada. You will be notified if you are eligible to apply for permanent residence.\n\nSpecial Considerations – Certain Applicants\n\nThe PRRA assessment process and outcome of an approved application differs for certain applicants.\n\nIf you…\n\nhave been determined to be inadmissible for serious criminality because you were convicted in Canada of a crime punishable by 10 or more years in prison; or\n\nhave been determined to be inadmissible for serious criminality due to a conviction outside of Canada for a crime that, if committed in Canada, would constitute a crime punishable by 10 or more years in prison; or\n\nhave been determined inadmissible on grounds of security, human or international rights violations or organized criminality; or\n\nmade a refugee claim and it was rejected on the basis of section F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention; or\n\nare named in a certificate referred to in subsection 77(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\n\n…and the officer’s assessment is that you would face risk, your file will be sent to a Case Management Officer who will determine if your presence in Canada is a danger to the Canadian public or a danger to the security of Canada.\n\nThe two assessments, (1) the risk faced by you and (2) the danger you represent to the Canadian public, will then be shared with you, giving you the opportunity to may make comments in writing, if necessary, on any errors or omissions.\n\nFinally, a delegate of the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship will consider the two assessments and your comments before making a final decision.\n\nIf your application is accepted, your removal order will be stayed (suspended), and you will be able to stay in Canada. However, you will not be able to apply for permanent residence. If it is determined at a later date that the circumstances that led to the approval of your application have changed, the stay will be cancelled and you will have to leave Canada.\n\nProtecting your information\n\nYour personal information is:\n\navailable to IRCC and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) employees who need to see it to provide the services to you, and\n\nnot disclosed to other organizations except as permitted under the provisions of the Privacy Act or the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.\n\nFor more information about the protection of your data, visit the Help Centre.\n\nIf you need help, you can find answers to your questions by visiting the Help Centre.\n\nFeatures"
