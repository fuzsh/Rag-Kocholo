        "text": "How can we help?\n\nOur services strengthen transparency and:\n\n– Promote a culture of ethical conduct and compliance with legal obligations;\n\n– Systematically address university-wide risks;\n\n– Enhance effective response to risks identified in audits; and\n\n– Communicate standards that clarify regulatory and operational requirement and responsibilities.\n\nEnterprise Risk Management\n\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a process applied strategically across the University to identify potential events that may adversely affect the entity and to manage the risks associated with those events.\n\nCivil Rights & Equity Investigations/Title IX\n\nTexas A&M University will promptly address all complaints of sex-based discrimination, harassment, and related retaliation made by or against faculty, staff, students, guests and vendors in accordance with our policies and applicable federal and state laws.\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits discrimination on the basis of a disability. Texas A&M University (TAMU) is committed to maintaining an accessible campus community and providing reasonable accommodations to qualified students, faculty, staff and visitors, including making its web sites accessible and usable.\n\nClery Annual Security Report\n\nThe Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act or Clery Act requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to report information about security policies and crimes statistics on and near their campus by October 1 of each year in an Annual Security Report. An Annual Fire Safety Report, containing fire safety information and fire statistics associated with on-campus student housing facilities, is also required by October 1 for institutions that have on-campus student housing facilities.\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe Texas A&M University Privacy website and policy explain how information is collected, used and disclosed by the University with respect to your use of the tamu.edu website and other University sites which display this policy, so you can make an informed decision about using the sites.\n\nRules & Standard Administrative Procedures (SAPs)\n\nUniversity Rules and SAPs are used to communicate the responsibilities, procedures, and practices that guide the operations of Texas A&M units.\n\nOpen Records\n\nThe Texas A&M University Office of Open Records is dedicated to the principles of open government and strives to ensure compliance as set forth by the Texas Public Information Act.\n\nTravel Abroad\n\nThe travel resource website is intended to serve the TAMU campus community with timely updates on travel rules, news, safety information, and training opportunities. The site brings together information that is communicated in other places, but not easily tied together for a “big picture” understanding of the rules and processes.\n\nUniversity Youth Programs\n\nThe requirements for hosting campus programs for minors stem from a shared commitment to provide a safe environment and meaningful experience for participants that not only meet the minimum legal requirements but also reflect the University’s core values of Excellence, Integrity, Leadership, Loyalty, Respect, and Selfless Service."
