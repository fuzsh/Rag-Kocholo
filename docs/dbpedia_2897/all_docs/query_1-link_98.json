My dream upon arriving in the United States is to find a decent job, to have an income to help my parents.\n\nAt 27 years old, Fernanda Levin was forced to leave behind her parents, siblings and home simply so that she could safely be herself.\n\nIt’s been so horrible, reading the news and wondering where family members are. All my relatives are in eastern Ukraine and I am afraid of what could happen to them.\n\nNewly engaged and working amid the conflict and crisis at home, Ukrainian refugee Anastasiia is rebuilding her life in Poland."
