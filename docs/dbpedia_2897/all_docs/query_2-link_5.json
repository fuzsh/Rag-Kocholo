        "text": "On this page:\n\nBasic Information\n\nGuidelines & Tools\n\nIRIS Process\n\nHistory of IRIS\n\nEPA’s mission is to protect human health and the environment. EPA’s IRIS Program supports this mission by identifying and characterizing the health hazards of chemicals found in the environment. Each IRIS assessment can cover a chemical, a group of related chemicals, or a complex mixture. IRIS assessments are an important source of toxicity information used by EPA, state and local health agencies, other federal agencies, and international health organizations.\n\nThe IRIS Program is located within EPA’s Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA) in the Office of Research and Development (ORD). The placement of the IRIS Program in ORD is intentional. It ensures that IRIS can develop impartial toxicity information independent of its use by EPA’s program and regional offices to set national standards and clean up hazardous sites.\n\nAbout the Center for Public Health & Environmental Assessment\n\nAbout the Office of Research and Development\n\nIRIS Toxicity Values\n\nIRIS assessments provide the following toxicity values for health effects resulting from chronic exposure to chemicals.\n\nRfC An estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. It can be derived from a NOAEL, LOAEL, or benchmark concentration, with uncertainty factors generally applied to reflect limitations of the data used. Generally used in EPA's noncancer health assessments. [Durations include acute, short-term, subchronic, and chronic and are defined individually in this glossary].: An estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. It can be derived from a NOAEL, LOAEL, or benchmark concentration, with uncertainty factors generally applied to reflect limitations of the data used.\n\nRfDAn estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a daily oral exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. It can be derived from a NOAEL, LOAEL, or benchmark dose, with uncertainty factors generally applied to reflect limitations of the data used. Generally used in EPA's noncancer health assessments. [Durations include acute, short-term, subchronic, and chronic and are defined individually in this glossary].: An estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a daily oral exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. It can be derived from a NOAEL, LOAEL, or benchmark dose, with uncertainty factors generally applied to reflect limitations of the data used.\n\nCancer descriptors characterize the chemical as:\n\nCarcinogenic to Humans\n\nLikely to Be Carcinogenic to Humans\n\nSuggestive Evidence of Carcinogenic Potential\n\nInadequate Information to Assess Carcinogenic Potential\n\nNot Likely to Be Carcinogenic to Humans\n\nOral slope factor An upper bound, approximating a 95% confidence limit, on the increased cancer risk from a lifetime oral exposure to an agent. This estimate, usually expressed in units of proportion (of a population) affected per mg/kg-day, is generally reserved for use in the low-dose region of the dose-response relationship, that is, for exposures corresponding to risks less than 1 in 100. (OSF) is an estimate of the increased cancer risk from oral exposure to a dose of 1 mg/kg-day for a lifetime. The OSF can be multiplied by an estimate of lifetime exposure (in mg/kg-day) to estimate the lifetime cancer risk.\n\nInhalation unit riskThe upper-bound excess lifetime cancer risk estimated to result from continuous exposure to an agent at a concentration of 1 µg/L in water, or 1 µg/m³ in air. The interpretation of unit risk would be as follows: if unit risk = 2 × 10⁻⁶ per µg/L, 2 excess cancer cases (upper bound estimate) are expected to develop per 1,000,000 people if exposed daily for a lifetime to 1 µg of the chemical per liter of drinking water. (IUR) is an estimate of the increased cancer risk from inhalation exposure to a concentration of 1 µg/m3 for a lifetime. The IUR can be multiplied by an estimate of lifetime exposure (in µg/m3) to estimate the lifetime cancer risk.\n\nFind other IRIS terminology in the IRIS Glossary.\n\nWhat's the Role of IRIS Assessments in Risk Assessment?\n\nRisk assessment is a four-step process described by the National Research Council (NRC) in 1983 as \"the characterization of the potential adverse health effects of human exposures to environmental hazards.\" Characterizing risk involves integrating information on hazard, dose-response, and exposure.\n\nAn IRIS assessment includes the first two steps of the risk assessment process:\n\nHazard Identification, which identifies credible health hazards associated with exposure to a chemical, and\n\nDose-Response Assessment, which characterizes the quantitative relationship between chemical exposure and each credible health hazard. These quantitative relationships are then used to derive toxicity values.\n\nEPA’s program and regional offices identify human exposure pathways and estimate the amount of human exposure under different exposure scenarios (Exposure Assessment). Then they combine their exposure assessment with the hazard information and toxicity values from IRIS to characterize potential public health risks (Risk Characterization).\n\nGuidelines & Tools\n\nEPA follows Agency guidelines in developing IRIS assessments. Key guidelines, technical documents and a few popular tools used by the IRIS Program for developing assessments are listed below.

Each HERO record provides detailed bibliographic information. Since 2010, all citations in new IRIS assessments are linked to entries in the HERO database.\n\nLearn more about the HERO Database\n\nBenchmark Dose Software (BMDS)\n\nBenchmark dose (BMD) modeling is EPA’s preferred approach for deriving points of departure (PODs) used to develop toxicity values. Use of BMD modeling involves fitting a set of mathematical models to dose-response data from human and animal studies. EPA’s benchmark dose software (BMDS) was designed to facilitate the application of BMD methods in dose-response assessment.\n\nLearn more about Benchmark Dose Software\n\nIRIS Process for Developing Human Health Assessments\n\nStep 1. Draft Development\n\nBeginning an assessment, EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) undertakes scoping and problem formulation to ensure that the product meets the scientific needs of the EPA program or regional office(s) requesting the assessment. These activities help focus the assessment by describing the routes of exposure, potential health effects, types of studies, and key science issues to be considered in the assessment. EPA ORD also develops an assessment protocol which presents the systematic review and dose-response methods being used to develop the draft assessment. EPA releases these preliminary assessment materials to obtain input from the scientific community and general public. A public science meeting may be held to obtain additional input.\n\nFor more detailed information on the methods used to develop a draft IRIS assessment, visit the “ORD Staff Handbook for Developing IRIS Assessments,” or “IRIS Handbook” webpage.\n\nStep 2. Agency Review\n\nScientists in EPA’s program offices and regions review the draft assessment.\n\nStep 3. Interagency Science Consultation\n\nEPA ORD leads other federal agencies and departments in a review of the draft assessment.\n\nStep 4. Public Comment and External Peer Review\n\nAfter revising based on Agency and Interagency comments, a draft assessment and charge questions are released for public comment and peer review.\n\nStep 5. Revise Assessment\n\nThe assessment is revised to address public comments and peer review recommendations, and a disposition of peer reviewer and public comments is developed.\n\nStep 6. Final Agency Review/Interagency Science Discussion\n\nThe revised assessment is reviewed by EPA’s program offices and regions and other federal agencies and departments.\n\nStep 7. Final Assessment\n\nThe final IRIS assessment is posted to the IRIS website.\n\nNote: To learn more about the historical development of the IRIS Process, see the history of IRIS."
