        "text": "Up to $73 million in funding is available for FY24 SVPP. Each award is three years (36 months) in duration for a maximum federal share of $500,000 per award. There is a local cash match (cost share) requirement of at least 25 percent.\n\nSVPP funding will provide up to 75% funding for the following school safety measures in and around K-12 (primary and secondary) schools and school grounds:\n\n“Coordination with law enforcement”\n\n“Training for local law enforcement officers to prevent student violence against others and self”\n\n“Metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other deterrent measures”\n\n“Technology for expedited notification of local law enforcement during an emergency”\n\n“Any other measure that the COPS Office determines may provide a significant improvement in security”\n\nThe following school safety measures are available through the Bureau of Justice Assistance’s (BJA’s) section of the STOP School Violence Act of 2018:\n\nDevelopment and operation of anonymous reporting systems\n\nHotlines\n\nInternet websites\n\nMobile telephone applications\n\nDevelopment and operation of a school threat assessment\n\nSpecialized training for school officials in responding to mental health crises\n\nTraining for school personnel and students to prevent student violence against others and self\n\nAny other measure the BJA determines may provide a significant improvement in security\n\nPlease find additional info on the Bureau of Justice Assistance's (BJA's) website.\n\nFunding may also be available through the OJJDP FY 2023 Enhancing School Capacity to Address Youth Violence solicitation.\n\nAll awards are subject to the availability of appropriated funds and any modifications or additional requirements that may be imposed by law.\n\nSchoolsafety.gov\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of Education (ED), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) created SchoolSafety.gov to share actionable recommendations to keep school communities safe. SchoolSafety.gov aims to help schools prevent, protect, mitigate, respond to, and recover from emergency situations\n\nThe Final Report and Finding of the Safe School Initiative\n\nThe Safe School Initiative sought to identify information that could be obtainable, or \"knowable,\" prior to an attack. That information would then be analyzed and evaluated to produce a factual, accurate knowledge base on targeted school attacks. This knowledge could be used to help communities across the country to formulate policies and strategies aimed at preventing school-based attacks.\n\nU.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center\n\nOn July 12, 2018, the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center released Enhancing School Safety Using a Threat Assessment Model: An Operational Guide for Preventing Targeted School Violence to provide fundamental direction on how to prevent incidents of targeted school violence. The guide provides schools and communities with a framework to identify students of concern, assess their risk for engaging in violence, and identify intervention strategies to mitigate that risk."
