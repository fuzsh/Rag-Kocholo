        "text": "We study Alaska’s marine life to ensure the sustainable use of living marine resources in federal waters. We monitor fish and marine mammal populations that have supported Alaska Native communities for centuries and provided food, income, and recreational enjoyment for millions of people around the world. Effectively studying fish and marine mammals also requires researching their habitats and the relationships between predators and prey. We study Alaska marine ecosystems.\n\nTo obtain the best available information scientists use research ships to collect oceanographic and biological samples. We also use airplanes and uncrewed aerial systems to collect data in remote areas. We work collaboratively with the fishing industry to collect information on how much fish is caught each year in commercial operations and recreationally. We then input collected data into sophisticated models to help predict future fish stock size. Fishery managers use our data to set sustainable catch limits and protect whales, seals, and sea lions in Alaska.\n\nOur Five Primary Divisions\n\nAuke Bay Laboratories\n\nThe headquarters of the Auke Bay Laboratories is the Ted Stevens Marine Research Institute. This division consists of four main programs which conduct scientific research throughout Alaska on commercially marketable species such as rockfish, sablefish, and salmon, and on all aspects of marine ecosystems such as ocean physics and chemistry essential to fish habitats, and the structure and functioning of marine food webs. Information products are provided to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, the NOAA Fisheries Alaska's Regional Office, fishing industries, state and federal regulators, and international treaty bodies.\n\nFisheries Monitoring and Analysis Division\n\nThis division monitors groundfish fishing activities in the United States exclusive economic zone off Alaska. Associated research includes sampling commercial fishery catches, estimating catch and bycatch mortality, and analysis of fishery-dependent data. The division is responsible for training, briefing, debriefing, and overseeing observers who collect catch data onboard fishing vessels and at onshore processing plants, and for quality control/quality assurance of observer data.\n\nMarine Mammal Laboratory\n\nThe laboratory conducts research on marine mammals, primarily off the coasts of Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Information is provided to various U.S. governmental and international organizations to assist in developing rational and appropriate management regimes for marine resources under NOAA's jurisdiction.\n\nResource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division\n\nThe division conducts fisheries surveys to measure the distribution and abundance of approximately 40 commercially important fish and crab stocks.\n\nResource Ecology and Fisheries Management Division\n\nThe division collects data to support management of Northeast Pacific and eastern Bering Sea fish and crab resources. Stock assessments are developed annually and used to set catch quotas. Division scientists also evaluate how fish stocks and user groups might be affected by fisheries management actions.\n\nOffices that Provide Support and Oversight\n\nAlaska Fisheries Science Center Newport Laboratory\n\nThe Science Center's Newport Laboratory houses the Fisheries Behavioral Ecology Program, located at the Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, Oregon. The Hatfield Marine Science Center was created to serve the scientific needs of various organizations and government agencies and includes the Oregon State University building constructed in 1965 and the NOAA facilities which were completed in 1981.\n\nAlaska Fisheries Science Center Kodiak Laboratory\n\nThe Kodiak Laboratory resides in the Kodiak Fisheries Research Center owned by the Kodiak Island Borough. The Kodiak Laboratory within KFRC consolidates NOAA Fisheries and management programs in Kodiak and makes them more accessible to the fishing industry and the public.\n\nAdditional Support\n\nOperations, Management and Information Services Division\n\nThis office supports the day-to-day administrative and business operations of the Center, including overseeing administrative services, budget formulation and execution, acquisition and grants management, workforce management, communications, safety and environmental compliance, and facilities operations.\n\nOffice of Fisheries Information Systems\n\nThis office provides technical support and development services for the Center’s IT enterprise.\n\nPlanning Officer\n\nThe officer is similar to a “Chief of Staff” responsible for program management and development of strategic initiatives, including participating as a member of the Senior Executive Team and overseeing the annual Science Planning and Implementation Processes."
