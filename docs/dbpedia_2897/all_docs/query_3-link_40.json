        "text": "A Growing Partnership\n\nFrom its inception in November 2001, CTPAT continued to grow. Today, more than 11,400 certified partners spanning the gamut of the trade community, have been accepted into the program. The partners include U.S. importers/exporters, U.S./Canada highway carriers; U.S./Mexico highway carriers; rail and sea carriers; licensed U.S. Customs brokers; U.S. marine port authority/terminal operators; U.S. freight consolidators; ocean transportation intermediaries and non‐operating common carriers; Mexican and Canadian manufacturers; and Mexican long‐haul carriers, all of whom account for over 52 percent (by value) of cargo imported into the U.S.\n\nHow CTPAT works\n\nWhen an entity joins CTPAT, an agreement is made to work with CBP to protect the supply chain, identify security gaps, and implement specific security measures and best practices. Applicants must address a broad range of security topics and present security profiles that list action plans to align security throughout the supply chain.\n\nCTPAT members are considered to be of low risk, and are therefore less likely to be examined at a U.S. port of entry.\n\nCTPAT Benefits\n\nCTPAT Partners enjoy a variety of benefits, including taking an active role in working closer with the U.S. Government in its war against terrorism. As they do this, Partners are able to better identify their own security vulnerabilities and take corrective actions to mitigate risks. Some of the benefits of the program include:\n\nReduced number of CBP examinations\n\nFront of the line inspections\n\nPossible exemption from Stratified Exams\n\nShorter wait times at the border\n\nAssignment of a Supply Chain Security Specialist to the company\n\nAccess to the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) Lanes at the land borders\n\nAccess to the CTPAT web-based Portal system and a library of training materials\n\nPossibility of enjoying additional benefits by being recognized as a trusted trade Partner by foreign Customs administrations that have signed Mutual Recognition with the United States\n\nEligibility for other U.S. Government pilot programs, such as the Food and Drug Administration’s Secure Supply Chain program\n\nBusiness resumption priority following a natural disaster or terrorist attack\n\nImporter eligibility to participate in the Importer Self-Assessment Program (ISA)\n\nPriority consideration at CBP’s industry-focused Centers of Excellence and Expertise\n\nHow Do I Become a Partner?\n\nJoin CTPAT Now\n\nParticipation in CTPAT is voluntary and there are no costs associated with joining the program. Moreover, a company does not need an intermediary in order to apply to the program and work with CBP; the application process is easy and it is done online. The first step is for the company to review the CTPAT Minimum Security Criteria for their business entity to determine eligibility for the program. The second step is for the company to submit a basic application via the CTPAT Portal system and to agree to voluntarily participate. The third step is for the company to complete a supply chain security profile. The security profile explains how the company is meeting CTPAT’s minimum security criteria. In order to do this, the company should have already conducted a risk assessment. Upon satisfactory completion of the application and supply chain security profile, the applicant company is assigned a CTPAT Supply Chain Security Specialist to review the submitted materials and to provide program guidance on an on-going basis. The CTPAT program will then have up to 90 days to certify the company into the program or to reject the application. If certified, the company will be validated within a year of certification.\n\nIf you have CTPAT issues or questions, please contact your Supply Chain Security Specialist or one of the six CTPAT Field Offices by email at:"
