        "text": "A key component of an AML risk assessment is to facilitate the effectiveness of an institution’s AML framework by identifying inherent risks across the main areas of risk, assessing the institution’s internal preventative and detective controls, and highlighting any gaps in controls that need to be addressed. This process ultimately helps financial institutions arrive at a residual risk identification that addresses their own risk appetite, ensuring that the AML risk assessment is risk-based.\n\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council describes an AML risk assessment example as “the identification of specific risk categories (e.g., products, services, customers, and geographic locations) … and an analysis of the information identified to better assess the risks within these specific risk categories” (source: FFIEC BSA/AML Manual).\n\nThe FATF explains that risk assessment enables a financial institution to “understand how, and to what extent, it is vulnerable to money laundering/terrorist financing”, and helps it to “determine the level of AML/CFT resources necessary to mitigate that risk” (source: FATF Guidance for a Risk-Based Approach, The Banking Sector).\n\nOrganizations may complete risk assessments manually, or by using AML risk assessment software tools and systems. Using technology, such as ACAMS Risk Assessment™, can help financial institutions to ensure their AML risk management and risk assessment processes and methodologies are objective, and that they respond to the guidance of global authoritative sources and financial institution supervisors.\n\nEffective AML risk assessments are an important factor in a financial institution’s ability to meet its regulatory obligations.\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of an institution’s sanctions program includes the measurement of the sanctions risks it is exposed to and the evaluation of its risk controls.\n\nThe frequency that a sanctions program risk assessment needs to be completed and its level of comprehensiveness depends on the risk profile of the institution, and how that risk profile changes over time.\n\nACAMS Risk Assessment™ automates the sanctions risk assessment process and draws on best practices to help financial institutions worldwide build a sound sanctions compliance program."
