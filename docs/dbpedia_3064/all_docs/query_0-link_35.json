        "text": "By Gerry Orlando | Syracuse Cinephile Society\n\nThe Syracuse Cinephile Society continues its 51st consecutive year of film screenings with a 14-week spring season of classic movies beginning on March 19, all digitally preserved by their studios and presented in excellent quality.\n\nThis season the organization continues to offer exciting studio restorations, including a high-quality presentation of the Frank Capra-directed comedy, “You Can’t Take It with You”. The film won both the “Best Picture” and “Best Director” Academy Award for 1938, and this sharp new transfer utilized Capra’s personal 35mm film print as the primary source material, replacing badly worn and inferior quality prints.\n\nPart of May 21’s Mystery Double Feature includes 1935’s “Charlie Chan in Paris”, which was believed to be a lost film for decades after the negative and most American prints were destroyed in Fox Films’ catastrophic vault fire of 1937. A print was eventually discovered in Europe, and that rare print’s digital transfer is being utilized for the Cinephiles’ screening.\n\nThe movie classics are screened on Monday evenings at the Spaghetti Warehouse, 689 North Clinton St., Syracuse, and are open to the public. Films begin at 7:30 pm. Dinner is available before the screening, beginning at 5:30 p.m. (Arrival by 6:15 pm for dinner is suggested). Admission to the films is $3 for members and $3.50 for non-members. An annual membership is $5.\n\nThe season schedule is provided here, along with original theatrical trailers for many of the scheduled films. Please keep in mind that many of these trailers have not been restored, and their quality does not reflect the quality and condition of the actual film transfers that will be presented at the Monday screenings. For details, visit syracusecinephile.com.\n\nMarch 19: You Can't Take It With You (1938)\n\nDirector: Frank Capra.
