        "text": "TopBilled:\n\nThe cast works so well in this one. Though I am a Ruth Roman fan, I expected her flashback sequence to be the weakest because it was saved for last and she was third-billed after Eleanor Parker and Patricia Neal. Parker gets top billing and the most screen time.\n\nIn fact Parker gets the whole first half hour devoted to her character’s story, though there is a brief scene (supposedly on the same day all three adoptions occur) when she crosses paths with Neal and Roman at the adoption agency.\n\nWe learn in detail that Susan Chase (Parker) was pregnant with a soldier’s baby at the end of the war, and due to unforeseen circumstances she was forced to carry the baby to term on her own. At her mother’s insistence, she has put the child up for adoption though she quickly regrets it. A year or two later Susan has married a legal eagle named Bill (Leif Erickson). They have a strong marriage; however, Susan discovers she is unable to have any more children which causes more regret about not keeping her son.\n\nNeal gets the middle section of the film, which is slightly less than half hour. About 25 minutes is devoted to her character’s story arc. She plays Phyllis Horn, a career woman who in flashback is getting a divorce from a likable fellow named Bob (played by Frank Lovejoy). Just as the divorce has become final, Phyllis learns she’s pregnant. But she doesn’t tell Bob about it, since he’s already moved on with another woman.\n\nPhyllis gives up the baby because there’s no way to reconcile with her ex-husband; plus she feels raising a child might interfere with her job as a globe trotting reporter. This character could easily have been played by Katharine Hepburn, and sometimes I thought Ms. Neal was channeling Ms. Hepburn, to be honest. She’s the least maternal character of the three.\n\nRoman’s arc begins around the one-hour mark, and she only gets 20 minutes, because the storytellers are reserving the last ten to fifteen minutes for the boy’s heroic rescue and the revelation about which one is the kid’s mother. But I have to say Ruth Roman really, and I do mean really, makes the most of her screen time.\n\nIt occurred to me that she may be the most skilled of the three actresses in melodrama, because she teared up the quickest in her scenes and you could feel the gut-wrenching anguish and just how tormented her character’s life was. Arguably, she had the juiciest story to play because her character Ann Lawrence shoots a no-good lover (John Dehner), gets imprisoned, has the baby while in prison, and has the baby taken away from her. The murder scene was fantastically staged, lit and played. Kudos to Ms. Roman, director Robert Wise and cinematographer Sid Hickox for nailing it.\n\nIn addition to the casting we have a gimmicky story that works beautifully. I say gimmicky because it’s obvious the screenwriters had seen A LETTER TO THREE WIVES and were inspired by it.\n\nBut this story is not about a cheating spouse…it’s about an adoption. The two films are similar in that we must wait till the end for the mystery to be resolved and we have three protagonists whose backstories are revealed in extended flashbacks. I would say, however, that THREE SECRETS is a more effective melodrama because I think when you put a child, especially a helpless child, into the scenario, it’s a lot more dramatic and emotional. The viewers can invest in a boy being reunited with his mother a bit more than a woman finding out if her husband was unfaithful.\n\nThe editing is smooth, and there isn’t one wasted shot or one wasted moment. Lesser filmmakers would have dragged this out over two hours, but Wise keeps it humming along and fits all the drama into a most compact 98 minutes.\n\nHe even manages to insert a bit of semi-documentary stuff that gives us a slight break from the melodrama, between Parker’s arc and Neal’s arc. We see reporters at the rescue sight leading us through some of the steps that volunteers and various officials undertake to reach the boy who is stuck on a ledge up along a mountain. I am sure a modern filmmaker, if he or she were to remake this story, would leave out most of the reportage but I find it valuable. It infuses a tale that could be otherwise over-the-top with some much needed realism.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nOnce again, we get the all familiar Warner Brothers shield (a co-production with United States Pictures) and that thundering Max Steiner-ish score (but with David Buttolph doing principal music), followed by the billing of three prominent ladies under contract with this studio. Patricia Neal a.k.a. Phyllis Horn needs no introduction to movie fans but the younger generation may still not be familiar with her unless they caught Paul Newman’s HUD on TV.\n\nEleanor Parker a.k.a. Susan Chase was later famous as the Baroness from Vienna whom every SOUND OF MUSIC fan hisses at and, intriguingly, Robert Wise directs her in both movies. Third lady of our trio is the less famous Ruth Roman a.k.a. Ann Lawrence, who would start work in Alfred Hitchcock’s STRANGERS ON THE TRAIN nine months after finishing this one. Principal photography was mostly done in the final two months of 1949 and inspired by the Kathy Fiscus case making news at that time.\n\nFrank Lovejoy a.k.a. Bob Duffy get a prominent listing above the supporting cast, being a favorite radio “voice” of mine in so many audio classics of that era. A bit wooden as an onscreen presence though. I should also add that the IMDb.com site reveals many blink and you miss extras of Hollywood legend here, from silent movie comedy star Billy Bevin to other famous radio voice greats like Eleanor Audley (a.k.a. the evil stepmother Lady Tremaine in Walt Disney’s CINDERELLA and the even more evil Malificent in SLEEPING BEAUTY), Willard Wallerman (the second Gildersleeve and hilarious in AUNTIE MAME) and John Dehner (who also did Disney voices on occasion but later became familiar in TV shows).\n\nAn airplane crash starts us in the proper melodrama frame of mind. Before it happens, a cute tyke (Duncan Richardson) comments that the clouds “look like milk.” Can we get we get any more adorable here without suffering tooth decay? The plot here involves three mommies in question ready to claim this supposed orphan named Johnny Peterson, a “tough little son of a gun” who survives. You see, all three were pregnant five years ago and gave up their baby up for adoption. Plus Frank Lovejoy’s Bob was previously married to Phyllis but they divorced and he remarried just before she had the child, so he is a prospective daddy here as well.\n\nSince kids being born out of wedlock or post-divorce were a big thing back then, with the Production Code making it an even bigger “thing” in the movies, we get our title from the fact that these women are initially keeping secrets regarding that all important birthday of September 15, 1944.\n\nHow all of them can remember the exact day so quickly and so accurately is an interesting situation in itself, plus Phyllis instantly recognizing Susan when the two meet again five years later after their mutual visit to the adoption agency. We must consider that all important “Hollywood license” that doesn’t quite match everyday real life. Yes, yes…I know. It is possible that all of these ladies have razor sharp memories and even kept diary notes.\n\nEdmon Ryan plays Hardin, a “hard” hitting newspaper reporter who pushes the plot forward, one with a past that includes Phyllis in the same profession. Then we have the whole rescue-the-child mission involving the Sierra Club of mountain climbers adding an adventure element to our story, including a rock avalanche impeding the rescue mission. This setting becomes the locale where each woman arrives and meets the others.\n\nLike other women’s pictures of the postwar period, we get flashbacks done in sets of three. (Perhaps the most famous example to compare here is A LETTER TO THREE WIVES, done by rival studio 20th Century Fox.) When Susan hears the news of the crash on the radio, she instantly remembers (right on cue!) and we flashback to her story as she says a sobbing goodbye to her soldier boyfriend. He may not die in combat overseas, but…gulp!…he tells her “there’s someone else.” Fortunately mommy (Katherine Warren playing Mrs, Conners) does not judge her, encouraging her to give the baby up for adoption and getting over her “mistake.”\n\nYears later, she is ready to marry again, but must settle this baby situation first since it seems likely that she can not have any more with her new husband (Leif Erikson as Bill Chase).\n\nPhyllis is the sophisticated one, dressed in her shape-shifting leopard spots when we first see her. A newspaper reporter, she is probably less conservative in her values system than Susan and, therefore, less ashamed and secretive about it. She and Susan have a chance meeting at the adoption agency in 1944 and the two meet again at the Sierras site…with Phyliis recognizing Susan instantly. Of course!\n\nPhyllis was initially married at the time she started on-the-nest and was busy as a war correspondent, a great career woman before such were fashionable. Keep in mind that, by 1949-50, many ladies were returning to the kitchen and nursery, often with great disappointment and disgust…and I do detect a certain negative vibe by the screenwriters regarding Phyllis being unsuccessful managing both career and wifely duties. Nonetheless Bob is hardly one we should side with here in the way he dumps her. “I happen to be a sentimental guy that comes from a family of twelve. I get lonesome when there are eleven people around…and even one.”\n\nBoth Susan and Phyllis bond well with each other. Then Anne enters the picture. She staggers into the media arena as a drunk and gives the meatiest performance among the trio. Her story contrasts with the two “little maids who lost their way” and differs in that she actually narrates it for both screen and her listeners present. As is usual, these women don’t just have sex for the fun of it. They “fall in love” with men who don’t love them back, those awful heals. In Ann’s case, the heal is a wealthy business man who is insidious in the way he makes her get lost and she is involved in his death, partly by accident. Poor Ann has her child while serving time in prison! (Ted de Corsia plays her dance agent Del Prince.)\n\nWon’t spoil the (happy, if still very deceptive) ending, but you can kind of guess early on who is the real mother and who winds up with the boy regardless. While this is not a particularly great movie, it is still a highly entertaining potboiler and, like all Warner features of the era, delightfully lays the orchestration on pretty thick so that you are fully and emotionally invested.\n\nAlso I love how the studio productions of the era often recycled sets: Susan’s house being the same one that Joe McDoakes (George O’Hanlon) often used in those wonderful Warner shorties that alternated with Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies before the main WB feature in your local theater. Also it looks like some of the Sierra footage was yanked from earlier features like HIGH SIERRA as well.\n\nTopBilled:\n\nTopBilled:\n\nWhen Jlewis first talked about this movie in a private message, I told him that I liked the sequel HERBIE RIDES AGAIN (1974) a bit better than the original. I suppose it has to do with Stefanie Powers and Helen Hayes, two actresses I always enjoy watching. In his review below, Jlewis adds a post-script about the sequel.\n\nI first became familiar with THE LOVE BUG and its sequels when I was in elementary school. I hadn’t seen any of the movies at that point, but there was a monthly book order my third grade teacher oversaw. One month I used part of my allowance to purchase a book with a Volkswagen– number 53– on the cover. It was a retelling of the original story with pictures from the movie. That’s when I was first introduced to Herbie.\n\nRecently I tried to locate reviews by Pauline Kael and Rogert Ebert on the original 1968 film but they do not seem to exist. I was curious to read what they might have written. Perhaps Herbie and his automotive issues were too quaint or low-brow for Ms. Kael. Ebert did review the remake HERBIE: FULLY LOADED in 2005, and he admits to not having seen the original film or its three sequels.\n\nI found some user reviews on the IMDb. One person called the original film a live-action cartoon, whatever that means. Other reviewers on the IMDb mentioned how Herbie is a family friendly vehicle and he will win you over. It sounded like something a car salesman might say. I guess we all “bond” over the vehicles we use, some owners more than others. And people have been known to nickname their cars or trucks, the way Buddy Hackett’s character names Herbie. Though this may be taking the “relationship” a bit far.\n\nIf Herbie himself is a live action cartoon, it must mean he is a non-vegetative auto. He is a car with a unique brand of energy. He exhibits feelings and has a mind of his own. He is very animated. In HERBIE: FULLY LOADED, he is even more animated due to the newer filmmaking technology. He blinks his headlights, he pantomimes (don’t ask how), he droops his bumper when he’s melancholy and uses those doors of his as if they are wings.\n\nHow much intelligence does Herbie have? (I won’t ask about the audience’s intelligence or the audience’s willingness to suspend disbelief at some of the more outrageous stunts that occur.) If Herbie is intelligent, he is also sentient. Logically speaking, how would a car develop intellect and sentience? One has to wonder!\n\nIf he is a form of Artificial Intelligence, then Herbie is cinematic kin to HAL in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. And emotionally, he could be seen as the polar opposite of CHRISTINE, a set of wheels that had homicidal tendencies, thanks to Stephen King. Fortunately, because this is a Disney product, Herbie is not psychotic like Christine.\n\nIf a car like Herbie has brains and a heart, then he probably also has a soul. And by extension, he can use these qualities to fall in love. Okay, this is starting to get a bit philosophical now…\n\nIn addition to our main character, there are the humans in the story who basically play supporting roles. Often these actors are replaced in the long shots by stunt personnel.\n\nThe formula does not change from the original to the sequels to the remake. In each version we have a plucky car, a plucky hero (or heroine), a teeth-gnashing bad guy and a love story between the young leads, accompanied by a lot of racing footage.\n\nI find it interesting that the original 1968 version features a sequence where Herbie considers suicide, and in the 2005 version, he is nearly wrecked beyond repair in a junkyard. I guess Disney is telling us that he’s mortal, he has a lifespan. But if Disney can keep rebooting this story and keep it humming like a well-oiled machine, I don’t think Herbie will run out of gas anytime soon.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nTHE LOVE BUG was filmed between March and July of 1968, a rather interesting time period in both United States history and Hollywood entertainment. As star Michele Lee reported in an interview, a major scene that made the final cut (but I am not sure which one, off hand) was filmed on the very day that they all learned of Martin Luther King Junior’s murder. This brings up the rather ominous fact that hardly any live-action Disney films prior to this one (the one infamous exception being SONG OF THE SOUTH) showed much diversity in their casts in terms of racial skin tones.\n\nAlthough Walt Disney approved preliminary storyboard work just before his death in late 1966, there wasn’t much optimism that this comedy would fare any better than, say, BLACKBEARD’S GHOST.\n\nIn total surprise to both the studio and the industry, it triumphed over both Sam Peckinpah’s THE WILD BUNCH and Dennis Hopper’s EASY RIDER, which were filmed simultaneously during that same four to five month period and also put on the market in 1969. Yes, even though the latter film received more printed commentary than THE LOVE BUG, those Harley Davidson “Captain America” motorcycles still got out-driven by a clean-cut Dean Jones in a run-down Volkswagen Beetle. As two San Francisco teens confess in a drag race through the streets against Herbie the Love Bug: “Outta sight man! I would have never believed it!”…“Groovy, Pop, groovy!”\n\nOne would not expect an automobile to behave in a humanized fashion, despite cartoons that Disney made earlier like SUSIE THE LITTLE BLUE COUPE (with eyes added to the windshields to create a “face”), but this is a classic example of how creative entertainers can add a “soul” to just about anything mechanical, non-human and even non-animal.\n\nClassic scene: Herbie attempting suicide off the Golden Gate Bridge and Dean Jones’ Jim Douglas out to stop him. This is after his jealous rage over Jim expressing more love for a rival Lamborghini and banging the cr!p out of it. The whole set-up a.k.a. “No, Herbie, don’t!!!!” is wonderful with its murky fog prevailing much like the London imagery displayed in a key scene previous in MARY POPPINS, which the British-born Robert Stevenson also directed. It is not so much what the car itself does, but the clever editing and the atmosphere that reflects Herbie’s emotions and “state of mind.”\n\nThe human performers are all very appealing here even if they must play second fiddle to a set of four wheels. The top trio featured: straight-laced Dean Jones as race driver Jim Douglas, Michele Lee as Carole, the secretary of Thorndyke’s car sales who winds up as Jim’s love interest in the end, and the always wonderful Buddy Hackett (later a key voice in another Disney, THE LITTLE MERMAID) as Tennessee, the bumbling auto mechanic who had recently visited Tibet like the Beatles and “discovered my real self.”\n\nNaturally he is the one to first discover that Herbie has a human soul after “it” follows Jim home from the car dealers. Among the multiple minor character actors is the frequently cast Joe Flynn, who milks his usual side-kick role in the climactic car race sequences with Peter Thorndyke.\n\nAh, yes…Peter Thorndyke is our resident funny-villain. The British-born character actor David Tomlinson made three Disney features, two of them musicals that I fleetingly mention elsewhere in this review. Yet his greatest performance for the mouse house is certainly this straight-forward comic one. Watching a YouTube montage like “The Best of Peter Thorndyke” makes one wonder why he wasn’t nominated for an Oscar here. OK…maybe I should not go that far. I understand that a lot of the comedy here is slapdash slapstick with dialogue to match.\n\nMuch of the fun for me comes from Tomlinson’s little touches here and there in his Thrifty-shifty Thorndyke role. For example, when first meeting Jim, he is impressed enough to offer him sherry. Then he promptly pours it back in the bottle once Jim says he is only spending seventy five to eighty dollars.\n\nThe scenes with him infiltrating Tennessee’s garage are loaded with classic little moments: when Tennessee tells him that “the secret of the little car” is its “heart,” something our star villain obviously does not have, he hilariously states that he’s “certainly going to make a note of that” and then promptly tosses his pen in a cup! The lines between these two are quite surreal in an Abbott & Costello sort of way: Thorndyke: “What part of Ireland did you say your mother came from?” Tennessee: “Coney Ireland.”\n\nThe story is pretty basic. Jim is a down and out race car driver who hits pay dirt with Herbie, a car with a human personality, but there is a lot of doubt and skepticism on his part. Ultimately the feisty Thorndyke tries to sabotage his chances in a wild country road race, with Herbie even getting dissected along the way and literally “coming apart” just before he hits the finish line.\n\nDespite the overall simplicity in story, the comic lines are vastly superior to other sixties Disney “comedies.” It is also fun having a no-nonsense Garry Owens provide announcer commentary as all of the hijinks occur.\n\nI tend to view a lot of Disney films, both those made when Walt was alive and those made in the two decades following his passing, in two separate camps. There are those that are not very good, but have little things that hold my interest; a good example being the 1977 version of PETE’S DRAGON, a colossal mess that had me scratching my head in the theater as a preteen, but still manages one really great song that Helen Reddy handles, “Candle in the Water”. In contrast, THE LOVE BUG is an example of a generally very good film that still…somehow…disappoints in little spots here and there; its rather Mickey Mouse-ish style of music gets quite annoying after a while.\n\nClearly this movie was written by the over-30 crowd that was not quite comfortable with the changing times. Although Dean Jones is convincing in a secondary role as a hippy, delivering the memorable line of “We’re all prisoners, Chickie Baby. We are all locked in…,” his subsequent comment on our star characters being “a couple of weirdos” is intended to be taken as put-down self-criticism.\n\nBeing that the writers were still working in a pre-Stonewall era, there are also subtle homophobic digs tossed here for good measure: his middle-aged male companion is dubbed “Guinevere”, referencing both Vanessa Redgrave’s character in CAMELOT (released shortly prior) and the popular belief among the older generation that men who wear their hair long have a gender identification problem. (A popular road sign that went up across the country in 1968 read “Beautify America. Get a haircut.”)\n\nThis brings me to the way the Chinese American characters are portrayed here. To be fair, it is a vast improvement over BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY’S in which Mickey Rooney poses as “Chinese.”\n\nHere we have Bensin Fong playing Mr. Wu, who takes ownership of Herbie and backs our stars financially in their race. He and the others (Brian and Harold Fong receive no on screen credit) are actually Asian-Americans getting key screen roles at a time when Hollywood films were mostly devoid of them. (Note too that we see only a few African Americans as extras on screen, with just one speaking role by an un-credited Eddie Smith.) At first, there is limited stereotyping: one highlight involves Tennessee talking in Chinese and later learning that Wu is perfectly fluent in English once “money” is discussed.\n\nThe one key scene that will likely make many modern viewers squirm involves a “Chinese camp” in which an older fellow purposely behaves like an “oriental” Steppin Fetchit servicing Thorndyke’s car. His son translates in broken English that he “says hurry is waste [and] waste is cracked bowl never that know rice.” There is not anything specific here that is outright offensive but there’s an overall attitude that the creators of this movie view the Asian Americans as “others.”\n\nAgain, one must always accept films as time capsules of the way we were, both the positive and the negative.\n\nNote how cheap the gas prices were back then! Also the fashions with Michele Lee’s miniskirt and short cropped hairstyle is making a comeback in the 21st century. Note too how simple car racing was in the sixties compared to the modern corporate sponsored NASCAR era.\n\nPredictably the enormous success of this film spawned three sequels and a remake. It is rather curious that it took a full five years for the first of these to get made. HERBIE RIDES AGAIN was not nearly as good as the original (and neither were the others) but it does have special appeal for me personally as the first “all new” movie that I got to see in a movie theater.\n\nAnother curiosity about the Herbie franchise that I always found strange is that it generated far less merchandise than so many other Disney hits despite such a lovable central character. Although there were die-cast model replicas for the toy car trade and a trio of excellent View Master reels, there were not all that many chapter and coloring books out on the market in 1969 compared to the competition. It was not until 1974 that Herbie would grace the cover of one of Western Publishing’s Little Golden Books.\n\nNo doubt, this was due to the confusing state of the Disney company in those hypersensitive years shortly following the founder’s death. As long as brother Roy was still in charge, there was still some level of stability, but his death in December 1971, following the opening of Walt Disney World in Florida and the lackluster response to BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS, would provide a further blow…and push the company even further away from its big and small screen entertainment roots and more towards merchandising and theme parks, which were generally no more stable in revenue.\n\nThat special confidence that Walt gave the company took a long time to recover, having to wait until the era when Roy’s son and Michael Eisner took over. THE LOVE BUG was a colossal hit that could have impacted the company for the better, but was, instead, just a fluke phenomena that the company wasn’t sure how to milk properly.\n\nPostscript:\n\nI re-watched HERBIE RIDES AGAIN for either the third or fourth time. Not sure which. I first saw it in a movie theater at age six and absolutely adored it. Did not see it again for another dozen years or so, probably on TV or VHS in the eighties as a teenager. By then, I had seen enough of these types of slapstick car-crash affairs that it failed to impress me all that much. May have seen it again a decade after that but I am not sure. In any case, I decided to re-watch it again with a new set of eyes since TopBilled said he favored it over THE LOVE BUG.\n\nMy final analysis…OK. I still don’t like it as much as THE LOVE BUG but it is still a fun if, perhaps, uninspired Disney comedy. What is great about it are the stunts, far more ambitious than in the former.\n\nMy guess is that the budget was bigger and it shows in the production values. Although a product of the early seventies (filmed in ’73 and released ’74), the fashions are not too retro; everything Ken Berry and Stefanie Powers wear is pretty much up to date with today’s styles. Powers sports a hair style more representative of the Watergate Era, like Michele Lee’s was five to six years earlier.\n\nExcept for the occasional seventies look here and there, what I find most interesting is that the story and editing style, along with the special effects, resemble something made a decade earlier.\n\nAlso the gags: note the great soap bubble disaster echoing another film we reviewed, MOVE OVER, DARLING with Doris Day that was filmed in 1963. The scenes on the high rise were no different than countless comedies of yesteryear going back to 1923 and Harold Lloyd’s SAFETY LAST and, yes, the special effects with the matte work is pretty obvious (although still good for the early seventies).\n\nRobert Stevenson and Bill Walsh were previously more edgy, poking fun at the flower power movement in the earlier film, but are more hesitant about rocking the boat here. Like far too many films of this type, we get our usual romance between the leads that involve a wedding at the end.\n\nEven Helen Hayes’ Mrs. Steinmetz gets a love interest with John McIntire (remember him in PSYCHO?). Speaking of Hayes, I found her much “cuter” in earlier viewings than I did this time around. Yes, it is fun seeing Berry’s Willoughby constantly worrying about her while she just ignores all danger and acts uber-confident, but a little of her “cute” factor goes a long, long, long way with lil’ ol’ me here.\n\nKeenan Wynn’s greedy Alonzo Hawk is much more enjoyable on screen but even his character seemed a bit too uninspired for me as a villain, except in the memorable dream sequences with multiple Herbies attacking him. No Asian Americans but we do get Don Pedro Colley playing a high profile construction tycoon putting Hawk in his place, something you would NOT have seen in a Hollywood film made a decade or more earlier unless there was some social commentary attached.\n\nI do like both Barry and Powers as performers but also felt both characters were less fully developed than Dean Jones and Michele Lee’s characters in the previous film. She rather instantly takes a liking to him with virtually no hesitation, despite her talk with “grandma” about wanting to manage her own dating life without her help… and despite initially punching him in the face and later slapping him with a hot lobster. Wish he commented more on that humorous behavior when he decides to marry her, but that was just a one-off joke the writers soon forgot about.\n\nThere was also a lot more tension between Jones and Lee in their portrayals, with Herbie playing a key role in uniting them together. Herbie does nothing for these two, as if he is merely their shared pet dog. It was as if writers just needed “a” couple at the end of this and weren’t terribly concerned so much about how-we-get-there as long as we-get-there. No fault of the performers. Just the material they were given.\n\nI did miss Buddy Hackett and David Tomlinson. They put a lot of energy into their performances and helped make THE LOVE BUG a cut above so many other Disney live-action comedies. Still enjoy HERBIE RIDES AGAIN and do think the overall premise is a good one, even if Herbie himself was not all that relevant to an old lady’s house potentially being bulldozed for a high rise skyscraper.\n\nTopBilled:\n\n“Mars and Beyond” is an animated episode of Disneyland (Walt Disney’s weekly anthology television series which was renamed several times over the years). The episode aired on December 4th, 1957 and was directed by Ward Kimball. Paul Frees served as the narrator.\n\nIn Jlewis’ review, he covers some of the more technical aspects of the production. I didn’t exactly dislike what I viewed, but I was not terribly wowed by it either. I would suggest our readers watch it for themselves after reading what Jlewis has written, then make up their own minds.\n\nThey were limited in their knowledge about space in 1957. One of the interviewed scientists admits they probably have errors in their calculations, so their efforts to gather information about the cosmos may be flawed.\n\nImagine how limited our knowledge may seem to people 64 years from now. It’s about adding layers of understanding on to what is already known (proven), then refining our theories so the end results are more practical.\n\nThe animation is fantastic and holds up well. Perhaps this is because it’s creative (bizarre at times) and these are the unique imaginings of life on other planets. However, these imaginings seem quite fictional.\n\nI remember once, while teaching a group of students, I asked them ‘do you think the bible is a work of fiction or nonfiction?’ We could ask that same question here, is this episode of Disneyland mostly fiction or nonfiction.\n\nSometimes this piece doesn’t know if it should be a wild and woolly cartoon or a scientific-based documentary. Ultimately, it chooses to be both.\n\nPaul Frees’ voice-over narration is excellent. Only Orson Welles could have done it better.\n\nI liked the sequence about the pressurized living colonies on Mars. However, I chuckled at the comment that they needed to colonize Mars due to overpopulation. There were around 3 billon people in 1957, compared to 7.8 billion in 2020. They had less than half our current world population.\n\nThe piece was used by science teachers in classrooms. But I didn’t get the impression that it would encourage students to apply science in their daily lives. It entertains more than it inspires scientific inquiry.\n\nIt presumes to tell viewers ‘this is what we know must be true’ about our neighboring planets. What would those neighboring planets say about us? It suggests that our knowledge (our earthly knowledge) is the most important knowledge in the universe.\n\nIt is worth watching at least once. You may enjoy it.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nWard Kimball is one of the most interesting animators and animation directors working for Disney between the years of 1934 and 1973. Beginning as an in-betweener, he moved up the ranks as a star animator in the early feature classics, although one famous sequence of his involving the dwarfs sipping soup was cut from SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (but shown later on TV and DVD). He then moved on to doing much of the work on Jiminy Cricket in PINOCCHIO and the infamous crows in DUMBO.\n\nWith his work in THE THREE CABALLEROS, he began deviating from the more naturalistic style of Disney animation, crossing into territory resembling the looser un-Disney Tex Avery crazies at MGM and Rod Scribner’s rubbery exaggerations in the Robert Clampett Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies at Warner Bros. In this one, he animated Donald Duck, José Carioca, and Panchito Pistoles doing a musical number that involves all kinds of surrealistic, wild activities breaking the walls of reality. By this time, he was a much trusted fixture at the studio and Walt Disney seemed to allow him more personal freedom to experiment than many others on the payroll.\n\nWhen UPA stole some of Disney’s thunder by the end of the forties and into the fifties with its flatter, more Matisse-like design, Ward managed to get the big boss to allow him to change with the times. Not that Disney always stuck to just any one particular style of animation and some of their pre-UPA work could sometimes look UPA-ish, but there was a bit too much comfort with the overly detailed story-book look during the post-war period, a look that critic Leslie Halliwell would dub later in print as “chocolate box-y”.\n\nMELODY and TOOT, WHISTLE, PLUNK AND BOOM were short subjects that he co-directed with Charles Nichols which incorporated a more stylized approach that one would more often expect in the early fifties Mr. Magoo and Gerald McBoing Boing cartoons rather than the contemporary Mickey Mouse cartoons; the former was presented in 3-D and the latter, an Oscar winner, was in CinemaScope.\n\nThis distinctive “mid-century modernism,” as many art critics called it (as it infiltrated all kinds of book illustrations of the 1950s with a vengeance), reached its apex with a trio of elaborate (and expensively produced) TV specials that Ward supervised for the Disneyland show. Due to their production costs, they were also released as all-color theatrical “featurettes” both in America and abroad after their debut on black and white television.\n\nMAN IN SPACE was produced mostly in 1954 and aired March 9, 1955, followed by MAN AND THE MOON on December 28. More production time was needed for the third installment, the most ambitious MARS AND BEYOND which premiered December 4, 1957.\n\nAll of these capitalized on the growing interest in space exploration, the last airing in the aftermath of the Soviet Sputnik launch, an ominous Cold War period event that literally pushed the United States into a space race. Plus flying saucers had been the rage for a decade by then and Mars was a particular favorite location for those seeking life-on-other-worlds.\n\nWard Kimball appeared in MAN AND THE MOON almost like an overgrown child captivated about the wonderful age we are living in where space travel will soon become a reality. I can only imagine his equal enthusiasm in this decade discussing the future of virtual reality entertainment or self-driving automobiles like the ones put out by Tesla.\n\nPaul Frees, that great radio voice on so many classic old time shows and later the creepy voice used in the Haunted House of the theme parks, provides our ominous narration as we explore, cartoon style, the history of man’s curiosity with the heavens above.\n\nIt all starts in cave man times and progresses through ancient Egypt and beyond. We get humorous busts of the Greek pioneers that include Ptolemy who defeated other more progressive philosophers with his backward earth-centric views, views accepted by many in Europe until Copernicus came into the picture with the needed math skills to prove that the sun was center of the solar system.\n\nWe then get a journey through the ever changing science fiction stories starting with French and Swedish writers in the 17th century and continuing into the 20th with H.G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, the latter with his own mock dictionary of Martian beasts.\n\nWard’s animation staff (featuring Julius Svendsen, Art Stevens and Jack Boyd with beautiful lay-outs by A. Kendall O’Connor, John Brandt and Tom Yakutis) has a field day recreating all of the imaginary outer-space creatures and humans on screen.\n\nPredictably anybody living on Venus is obsessed with love and romance and anybody living on Jupiter is expansive and huge, with the beings unable to even see each other and being afraid of Jupiterian horses (since Sagittarius is often aligned sign-wise with that planet and it is the sign of the centaur).\n\nThe whole UFO saga is investigated in zany cartoon form with pot shots at flying cigars that light up and the popular theory that aliens-are-walking-amongst-us-in-disguise. A hilarious bogus sci fi comic story is presented in the usual post-Playboy fantasy style with a lovely mink-shawled lady drinking martinis (?!), as secretary to a rather beatnik astrophysicist addicted to his pipe, suddenly getting abducted by aliens and having to fend for herself.\n\nAlthough the segment begins with a very sexist slant, she herself nonetheless gets to morph into a Wonder Woman action hero (something we rarely see during this time period) and wins out in the end by offering her adversaries atomic exploding cigars.\n\nLots of smoking going on here! Donald Duck makes a curious cameo among an assortment of weird beasties and creepy crawlees.\n\nDr. E.C. Slipher of the Lowell Observatory steps in during one live-action mid-section, in an otherwise three quarters animated cartoon, to discuss the more realistic prospects of finding life on Mars.\n\nHis prospects are not good, but that does not stop us from seeing more suggestions of what life could be like on Mars. After a brief showcase on how life evolved on Earth (cue the dinosaurs), we get clever montages of unusual worms and fish-like creatures (one oddball sponge-like beast vaguely resembles the angler fish seen in SECRETS OF LIFE) along with what appear to be spiny vacuum cleaners. I particularly like the flying wing-things that look like hang gliders.\n\nThings get very psychedelic at one point when the suggestion is made of crystal-like formations possibly becoming “life” and the screen explodes in kaleidoscope fashion. Must be due to all of the stuff that the production team was smoking, apparently not just tobacco. Throughout this show, George Burns provides some wonderful other-worldly music here, making this the ultimate retro “trip.”\n\nLike the previous two TV shows, we get in our final portion animated recreations of mankind journeying in futuristic space craft. Some of the designs, with Ernst Stuhlinger (backed by Wernher von Braun) shown presenting, are, in fact, ahead of their time and resemble what NASA is proposing today. There are also recreations of “high pressurized” enclosed cities recreated on our smaller planetary neighbor.\n\nI have watched this one multiple times on DVD since 2004 (when it became a part of the Walt Disney Treasures with the other shows included) and never get bored by any of it. It ages in spots from a scientific perspective, but is much too eye-popping to be considered “old” in any other way. The opening shot of “Uncle” Walt talking to a robot puts viewers in the right kooky frame of mind.\n\nBack to Ward…\n\nHis later years, post-MARS AND BEYOND, are still worthy of a little history recap. He and Walt shared a love of trains and already his hobbies in the area had been a topic in one of Jerry Fairbanks “Unusual Occupations” shorts for Paramount as far back in 1944.\n\nHe also headed his own jazz band, although not everybody with musical tastes shared the same opinions regarding his Firehouse Five Plus Two.\n\nDespite their friendship and mutual interests, Ward and his big boss didn’t always see eye to eye, especially when it came to politics: Ward wasn’t as supportive of Nixon like Walt was in 1960, but…by the same token…he wasn’t entirely with the Democrats all the time either and even made an anti-LBJ film (independent of Disney) in 1968 titled ESCALATION.\n\nOn an artistry level, he nonetheless got to beat to his own drum (or trombone as he preferred with his band) by making product that was hardly Disneyesque in style, earning an Oscar for IT’S TOUGH TO BE A BIRD (1969) which echoed Terry Gilliam’s outrageous work on the fledgling MONTY PYTHON series that was just getting started on British TV.\n\nHis final efforts for the studio were his animation direction for BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS and a 43 episode TV show THE MOUSE FACTORY that ended in the spring of 1973, just about the time he decided he needed a rest at age 59. An elder spokesman among Disney’s “Nine Old Men,” he remained active in many TV and video interviews up until his death in 2002.\n\nJlewis:\n\nBetween 1948 and 1959, Walt Disney released (through RKO and his own Buena Vista company) a series of enormously popular nature documentaries under the umbrella name “True Life Adventures.” In total, there were ten films running under 35 minutes each (even if the last three were not officially billed as such in their opening credits) and seven full length features (but with PERRI billed as a True Life “Fantasy”). Combined (and there was also a “best of” compilation feature released in 1975), these won a coveted eight Academy Awards and three more nominations.\n\nConcurrent to this series…and, yes, I will mention them too since they were very much like these in format and featured much of the same personnel…were the now-forgotten “People & Places” travelogues that sadly never made the VHS or DVD cut, despite equally being showered with awards and becoming a staple of the 16mm school market (the format that I saw most of them as a kid).\n\nFortunately the late Roy Disney Jr. began his career working on the True Life series and always had a soft spot for them, so…when he and Michael Eisner took charge of the mouse house in 1984, he made sure they still got shown on the Disney Channel and promoted their debut on VHS within a year after that.\n\nIn 2006, they received very special DVD treatments with Roy personally hosting and with each disc enclosed in a special mock film canister. So beautifully presented, these are prize processions for those of us lucky to get them for $20-25 at the time (they were sold at Walmart and other retailers), but are now commanding high prices on eBay today. The then eight year old theme park Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida got its usual promotion in these with cute little intros, but…more importantly…this revival of the series encouraged an all new series of Disney-backed nature documentaries titled “Disneynature” that are worth a whole discussion all their own.\n\nThere really isn’t anything especially novel or innovative about the True Lifes that hadn’t been done before apart from some distinctive Disney animation here and there. A magic paint-brush animated mostly by Josh Meador that opens each film in its introduction and gets plenty of activity in SECRETS OF LIFE. The entire series was in glorious Technicolor (mostly 16mm Kodachrome blown up to 35mm). Yet even the novelty of color in nature films was not exactly a novelty when this series began in 1948. A quick history lesson here…\n\nColor films featuring animals and flowers date back to 1908 using Charles Urban’s promoted Kinemacolor process. George Albert Smith and John Mackenzie filmed ANIMAL AND BIRD STUDIES at the London Zoo, however, since the technology wasn’t sophisticated enough to chase them in the wild.\n\nSpeaking of Charles Urban (whom I dedicated a “Shortie Checklist” thread to on the TCM forum), he was backing nature films well ahead of other movie pioneers, beginning with F. Martin Duncan’s close-ups of cheese mites, insects, hydras, amphibians and many other small critters in 1903, followed by the first time-lapse photography of plant growth and flowers blooming by F. Percy Smith by the end of that decade.\n\nSmith, in turn, became part of a team working for British Instructional in a series titled “Secrets of Nature” (1922-1933) which was followed by the Gaumont-British backed “Secrets of Life” (1934-1947)…and, as you can see where I am going here, Walt Disney himself blatantly borrowed the title for our reviewed feature here.\n\nConcurrent to all of these were the pioneering work of France’s Jean Painlevé, the subject of an excellent Criterion DVD compilation titled SCIENCE IS FICTION. His earliest stickleback fish footage predates SECRETS OF LIFE by three decades, but he was still making films in the early eighties.\n\nDespite the war, Jacques Cousteau still managed to make his first undersea scenic using scuba gear in 1943, titled ÉPAVES.\n\nMeanwhile Sweden’s Arne Sucksdorff gained some following U.S. side during the forties with some shorts distributed through 20th Century Fox’s Movietone. Later, his popular feature DET STORA ÄVENTYRET a.k.a. THE GREAT ADVENTURE competed against Walt Disney’s THE LIVING DESERT, the first of the True-Life features, at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nAlso not to be forgotten was the famous Soviet “school” of documentary filmmakers. At least one 45 minute featurette, Boris Dolin and Viktor Asmus’ ZAKON VELIKOI LYUBVI (watch here: https://www.net-film.ru/en/film-58437), enjoyed some attention in the U.S. when it was edited down into an Oscar-nominated short subject by Warner Brothers as SMART AS A FOX. It clearly influenced Disney’s own PERRI, the aforementioned True Life “Fantasy,” a decade later with its baby animal in a season-changing forest but featuring a squirrel instead of a fox.\n\n***\n\nWalt Disney was once asked by a lady how all of the prairie dogs were filmed in THE VANISHING PRAIRIE. His reply was that little cameras were attached to them on little harnesses. Obviously she was being hoodwinked but Disney was always honest about the movie magic being achieved by the most talented team of people he could assemble. The anthology Disneyland series on TV frequently showed “how it was done.” SECRETS OF LIFE received a special examination in the excellent SEARCHING FOR NATURE’S MYSTERIES, first broadcast on ABC in black and white on September 26, 1956 and later in full color (being filmed that way) on NBC the following decade.\n\nSo details the prologue: This is an authentic story of nature’s secret world…of her strange and intricate designs for survival…and her many methods of perpetuating life. These intimate and unusual scenes were made possible through the development of new photographic techniques…and through the skill and patience of many scientist-photographers.\n\nDespite the many awards, the True Lifes did get their fair share of criticism, much of it spared with SECRETS OF LIFE. One mistake made in the promotion of the series was the claim that the footage was all documented “as nature intended” but it was, in reality, often manipulated for the cameras.\n\nWhile some titles like WATER BIRDS were praised for the clever editing of fowl in flight scored to Franz Liszt’s “Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2,” critics were less kind to THE LIVING DESERT re-editing scorpions as if they were square dancing and THE VANISHING PRAIRIE pitting bighorn sheep together with the “Anvil Chorus.”\n\nPaul Smith was often accused of “Mickey Mouse-ing” the scores so that…literally, every action by any animal was documented with strings or keys. The desert film also featured animals pitted together in enclosed settings, although Paul Kenworthy’s hawk vs. rattlesnake and Pompilidae wasp vs. tarantula battles probably didn’t disturb animal rights activists since the participants weren’t as cute and cuddly as the lemmings shown “committing suicide” in the later WHITE WILDERNESS.\n\nAs the fourth of the features, SECRETS OF LIFE had its share of manipulated scenes but greater effort was made to be as factual as possible here. In addition, you can pretty much tell what scenes were shot indoors instead of outdoors, especially in the time lapse plant growth scenes shot against blue backgrounds.\n\nThe ant footage was done by Robert H. Crandall and his wife Fanny, partly in enclosed scenes indoors with some staged battles Roman gladiator style and also out in the field with a special glass over a cut ant colony nest, a procedure that was more intricate and smaller than the prairie dog set-up in the previous THE VANISHING PRAIRIE.\n\nThe LA Times had a fun article on him back in 1990 which can be found here: https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-12-30-me-10325-story.html\n\nAlthough bee hives were the subjects of numerous films of the past, including the Oscar winning CITY OF WAX (1934) by Horace and Stacey Woodard, Stuart V. Jewell went even further with his own honey bee footage. As documented on the excellent 9-26-56 broadcast mentioned above, he was able to locate the developing baby larvae in their hive cells and shoot them up close to help tell the most fascinating story of insect development. Jewell also supervised much, but not all, of the time lapse photography of plant growth. Even though the cameras were quite sophisticated, the overall process had not changed since the days of F. Percy Smith…one frame shot every few hours to speed up “time.”\n\nRounding out the long list of impressive cinematographers involved were Jack Couffer (Oscar nominated later for JONATHAN LIVING SEAGULL and still around, at the time of me writing this, in his nineties); George and Nettie MacGinitie of the California Institute of Technology’s marine division; Murl Deusing (an earlier contributor with Alfred and Elma Milotte in BEAVER VALLEY and other True-Life titles, mostly with birds but contributing some impressive aquatic footage here); Russian immigrant and microscopic specialist Roman Vishniac; Donald L. Sykes (an ex-Signal Corps cameraman who also did a lot of television camera work); Fran William Hall (another WW2 camera veteran who got the “bug” for filming bugs); and a couple names less well documented: Arthur Carter, William A. Anderson, Claude Jendrusch and Tilden W. Roberts.\n\nAlthough less famous than David Attenborough as a host to modern viewers, Winston Hibler enjoyed his time in the limelight as narrator to all of the “True Life Adventures” and “People and Places” series. He started with Disney in 1942 with story work for numerous animated features and got the narration role almost by default. He appeared in person on the ABC TV series, discussing the making of this series, but his soothing mid-western voice is still more famous today than his face.\n\nYou can’t help but be drawn in by the way he tells us a story regarding bee life: “Like most fairy tales, this one has a queen, ladies in waiting, magic potions and all the trappings of a proper fable.”\n\nThis feature has four parts that aren’t entirely related to each other. Part one focuses on the plant world and all of the hazards of pollination and seed growth. Part 2 covers the bees, and Part 3 the ants. Part 4 is pretty scattered all over the place but, apart from a handful of invertebrates (i.e. dragonfly juveniles, diving spiders, barnacles, fiddler crabs), it seems mostly focused on fish like the stickleback, angler fish, archer fish and grunion.\n\nIf there is one criticism of SECRETS, it is that it meanders from subject to subject without some key star like THE AFRICAN LION or the desert or prairie setting to tie it all together. In a way, it feels like a composite of the original British produced namesake series of 1934-47 and featuring much the same subject matter. The introduction features earth formations created by water and the finale climax again shows a “restless earth” featuring volcanoes in Hawaii, shot in CinemaScope (while the rest of the film is standard “Academy ratio”).\n\nOne prominent secret of life is sex. Throughout the soundtrack, we hear Hibler discuss fertilization and still more fertilization…and propagating…with a no-nonsense ho-hum dictation. I can only imagine how he would narrate sex-ed films for 7th grade as well, discussing the different boy and girl body parts as they go through, um, changes. Of course, the male stickleback fish still produces “milk” to fertilize a female’s eggs since I am guessing the Production Code still held its defiance over other possible words. In addition, Disney was getting overly cautious following the huge uproar over the birth of a bison segment in a previous feature, THE VANISHING PRAIRIE.\n\nThis series received a lot of attention in print throughout the fifties and into the sixties, courtesy of Western Publishing that put out many great children books on the individual films and the series as a whole. I particularly enjoyed my childhood Golden Press book, Wonders of Nature (1957) even though it lost its dust jacket and the pages have gradually worn. Also I have the Golden Press versions of three features, including this one, along with the Dell Comics versions, plus at least one of the Golden Stamps books of 1955 covering several titles.\n\nThere are flaws with this series, but its influence on an entire generation cannot be underestimated. So many of us became environmentally conscious after seeing these; note that the prairie title features the key adjective “vanishing” and we rarely see black-footed ferrets outside of captivity these days. With SECRETS OF LIFE, we gained a new perspective on the far less “human” arthropod and floral worlds, learning more than we expected about how seeds are planted….and the seeds planted for Earth Day and all that happened afterward can also be attributed, at least in part, to the Disney influence.\n\nHere is a sampling of clips from the whole series, mostly culled from the 1975 compilation feature with all new Hibler narration:\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/video/vi3876435993?playlistId=nm0382548&ref_=vp_rv_0\n\nTopBilled:\n\nThis month we are doing a version of Jlewis’ picks. I have since realized how knowledgeable he is about all things related to Walt Disney. As you may recall, a few years ago I had reviewed some Disney animation from the 1990s. But I thought we could revisit Disney and cover a bit more than animation this time around.\n\nJlewis has come up with a variety of titles that include animation and live action features. We’re starting with the animated classic BAMBI and truth be told, I don’t think I had seen it since one of the 80s theatrical reissues when I was a kid. It’s a film that lingers in your memory long after the initial viewing.\n\nKey sequences may currently be found for free on YouTube. These include the memorable scenes where Bambi’s mother dies, as well as the blazing forest fire that threatens the safety of not only the deer but a majority of other wildlife.\n\nThe death of Bambi’s mother is certainly heavy drama and may be hard for some children to take. I guess that’s why it lingers in the mind. I came across some interesting comments under the YT clip I watched yesterday where people discussed the merits of how mama doe dies off screen. A gunshot is heard while she and Bambi run to safety. Bambi has run ahead but he is not rejoined by his mother. His father, the prince buck, finds him and explains his mother’s death.\n\nDisney plans to remake the feature in 2021/2022. Though that may be postponed due to the pandemic. I wonder if they’ll depict the mother’s death on screen in the remake. Will the violence of the story be presented differently?\n\nThe forest fire is another situation. We do not learn about any animals dying during the blaze, but realistically some of them probably would have perished.\n\nThe most memorable image, in my opinion, is when the adult animals reach a haven along a shore with their young. The expressions on their faces as they find refuge makes me appreciate the struggle for survival. It’s something we all can relate to, wanting to keep ourselves and our youngsters from harm.\n\nWhile watching the clips, I was familiarizing myself with the overall story. I read up on Felix Salten, the Jewish author from Austria who had first published “Bambi, a Life in the Woods” in 1923. I learned he had also written a sequel called “Bambi’s Children” in 1939 after he had sold the rights of the original story to Hollywood.\n\nIn the sequel, we follow Bambi’s twins and there are now cousin characters that are introduced. Reading the plot summary, it seemed clear to me that Salten had woven in some sort of allegory about the Germans. The men that are hunting down these innocent creatures are quite Nazi-like in their pursuit to kill or capture their prey.\n\nI would say that on some level Bambi is an eco-horror story. A potentially grim form of environmentalism about what is required to survive. Ironically, the film’s own survival was in jeopardy when a legal tangle occurred between Disney and a publishing company that purchased the literary rights from Salten’s heirs. But fortunately, the copyright issues were resolved and it continues to be available for subsequent generations. That’s a good thing because of what Bambi teaches us about ourselves.\n\nBAMBI may currently be viewed in its entirety on YouTube for a small rental fee.\n\n***\n\nJlewis:\n\nI first saw BAMBI as my third major movie theater outing during one of its reissues. (There was a time when these animated features were brought back to theaters every eight or so years, before home entertainment and streaming services.)\n\nMy previous movie experiences were LADY AND THE TRAMP, also in reissue, and HERBIE RIDES AGAIN. I think my parents took me to see the doggie film just before my sister was born so that they didn’t have to explain the whole “what is a baby?” situation to me. They viewed me no differently than Jim Dear and Darling viewed their cocker spaniel.\n\nNot sure why I was taken to see BAMBI, but it was the film that had the stronger influence on my formative years. Not surprisingly, I did not become a fan of deer hunting and, when I lived in western Pennsylvania, detested how “man” would tramp through the neighborhood with their camouflage and rifles the week after Thanksgiving each year.\n\nThe movie didn’t have much impact on the sport anyway, but it did much to promote forest fire prevention. Although the United States Forest Service created its own icon with Smokey the Bear in 1944, Disney had a special arrangement with them that allowed Bambi and other characters from the movie to be freely used in TV and print ads. The forest fire in the movie is a key climax, but Leonard Maltin criticizes this impressive sequence in his Disney Films book of 1973: “The idea of giving the flames an animated life goes against the grain of the film and clashes with the meticulously drawn forest and the animals that the flames pursue.”\n\nMeticulous is a great adjective to describe BAMBI. Because it was so meticulous, it had one of the longest production periods among Disney animated features, if not quite as long as SLEEPING BEAUTY and THE BLACK CAULDRON.\n\nPreliminary work began during the final stage of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS when Walt Disney acquired the rights to Felix Salten’s novel through MGM producer/director Sydney Franklin, whom…I am guessing…had planned to make a live-action film for Metro using an animal cast. (MGM instead produced another deer pic, THE YEARLING, a decade later. Franklin himself is mentioned as a “special thanks” credit in BAMBI.)\n\nFull scale production began one month before war broke out in Europe and continued through the famous animators labor strike of June 1941, coinciding with Bambi’s screen debut “cameo” in THE RELUCTANT DRAGON.\n\nJames Algar, who later took on some of the live-action True Life Adventure films that I will be profiling shortly, was among several animation directors involved, along with Bill Roberts, Samuel Armstrong, Norman Wright, Graham Heid and Paul Satterfield. They were all either taking time out from– or working while others in the studio were busy with– PINOCCHIO, FANTASIA and DUMBO. Most of the work was completed by February 1942 but continued tinkering kept the release postponed until August.\n\nDavid Hand was the primary supervisor overseeing everybody with this special production and he is a rather interesting figure himself. In 1944, he moved to England and set up the most Disney-like animation unit there with full financial support by J. Arthur Rank, the most powerful tycoon in the British film industry.\n\nAlas…the mighty Rank empire started to tumble before long and this unit didn’t survive six years despite all of the effort involved. The only difference between Ginger Nutt in the Gaumont British “Animaland” series and the gray squirrel featured in BAMBI is the rusty European coat and tufted ears. Likewise we also see a hare (lankier than Thumper the rabbit as an adult but still remarkably similar) and a lookalike mole.\n\nLike so many Disney films, there is little resemblance to the original. Felix Salten published Bambi: Eine Lebensgeschichte aus dem Walde (Bambi: A Life in the Forest) in serialized magazine form for the Vienna publication Neue Freie Presse in 1922. A decade later, the Nazis banned the book for various reasons, not all fully understood today; and Salten, a Jew, left for Switzerland at the time Austria was annexed to Germany. It was here that he wrote a sequel called Bambis Kinder: Eine Familie im Walde (Bambi’s Children: The Story of a Forest Family).\n\nDisney not only changed much of the story material, but also the fauna featured. Salten’s original model for Bambi supposedly was a roe deer, but Kurt Weise, the illustrator of Whittaker Chambers’ English translation for Simon & Schuster (1929), depicted a majestic red deer instead. Regardless, the literary forest was populated by European critters, while Disney “Americanized” it all for the big screen.\n\nMule deer, native of California, were initially subjects of study, but then the Maine Development Commission provided live white-tailed deer from the east for the animators to study after Maurice Day did extensive photographic work in that state for the artwork needed for the impressive multi-plane camera effects. In addition to Thumper the Eastern Cottontail and Flower the Striped Skunk, we also get chipmunks, gray squirrels, opossums and raccoon that are not found in Salten’s native Austria, along with an assortment of birds that don’t quite match species found anywhere.\n\nPredictably both of the original books are much more graphic in their violence than any Disney film would dare to be. One key scene in the first book has Bambi and the Great Prince finding the corpse of a hunter accidentally shot by another hunter, proving to them that “man” (described as “He” in print) was no supernatural being. Faline had a brother named Gobo who gets adopted by a human and later is released back to the wild…only to get killed by that same human later. Walt Disney nonetheless decided to keep the killing of Bambi’s mother intact even though, as I will point out later, many children books published years after the movie often cut that scene out.\n\nWe often tend to view Disney’s version of Bambi the character as adorably cute and a pleasing icon for any nursery bedtime post, but the movie itself still retains a dark edge since it was, after all, released during the dark days of World War II. Even if many deaths in the books were removed from screen, we still see at least one animal killed besides Bambi’s mother: a pheasant who gets too scared and flies into gun fire.\n\nHer fall is followed by an intense battle scene featuring multiple pheasants and rabbits in particular that reminds me a lot of Jean Renoir’s horrible and vastly over-rated LA RÈGLE DU JEU (THE RULES OF THE GAME). I highly doubt that the animators saw it because that French film wasn’t released in the U.S. until after the war.\n\nThe movie score is one of the darkest in the Disney canon despite the Silly Symphony-ish “April Showers,” “Let’s Sing a Gay Little Spring Song” and the optimistic opening number “Love is the Song” sung by Donald Novis that was Oscar nominated. Although Edward H. Plumb and Frank Churchill worked as a team here, the Churchill influence seems far greater, often keeping us viewers on an uncomfortable edge.\n\nIt was Churchill who devised that simple, yet very ominous, set of notes whenever “man is in the forest” that many have compared with John Williams’ JAWS. I am not sure if Churchill specifically supervised the “clash of the stags” sequence in which a young Bambi struggles to keep out of the way of charging bucks in the meadow, but it sounds like his work with a stark Wagnerian warlike influence. “I Bring You the Song” was co-written with Larry Morey as a standard romance, but Churchill makes it all very haunting and non-earthly; the visuals showing Faline and Bambi in the dark summer meadow full of fireflies reminds me a little of our earlier reviewed GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES in its hypnotic until-death-we-part atmosphere.\n\nOn May 14, 1942, shortly after completing his work with the film and receiving an Oscar for his and Oliver Wallace’s work on DUMBO, Churchill sat at his piano and killed himself with a revolver. He had been dealing with depression for a while and was further saddened with the deaths of two close friends and orchestra members during the early months of the war. No, this was not the happiest movie produced by Disney.\n\n***\n\nThe occasionally depressing undertones (not that the whole film is like that, obviously, since we see our star survive and become a daddy to twins) might have hindered it at the box-office initially. BAMBI is a film that was ahead of its time and, thus, only started earning a substantial profit with its first re-release in 1947.\n\nThis prompted Simon & Schuster to revamp its earlier 1941 Disney book version (published before the film’s release) with an all-new Little Golden Book in April 1948 recycling the text but using different illustrations.\n\nMel Shaw, who worked on the movie as an animator, supervised the Big Golden Book version the following year which strangely covered just the first half of the story, leaving out the mother’s death. This particular deletion was a tactic repeated in subsequent Bambi books because too many parents of the burgeoning Baby Boom complained about having to explain what happens to “mommy” despite it being an important scene in the movie.\n\nOther kinds of merchandising involved with the movie are worth mentioning, even if I am deviating a bit from the movie itself. (Forgive me, please.) The movie’s first 3-D rendition appeared in 1951, courtesy of the TruVue stereo filmstrip company of Rock Island, Illinois with Nelson Williams in charge of the artwork…2-D illustrations turned 3-D with a special technique that was being fine-tuned. That company, in turn, was soon absorbed by Sawyers Inc. of Portland, Oregon, which already owned View-Master and put out both TruVue and View-Master versions involving model work by Joe Liptak (in a rarely seen today 7 image version) and the team of Martha Armstrong and Lee Green (involving 21 images).\n\nThe Armstrong and Green version was one of View-Master’s top Disney sellers between 1956 and 1988, after which it was replaced with a newer version that did not involve model work but also had the mother’s death scene reinstated. Baby Boomers tended to fuss a lot less about such subject matter with their own children than their parents did.\n\nThumper the rabbit, voiced by juvenile non-professional Peter Behn, was the key co-star who emerged with his own short lived comic strip and headlining his own Little Golden Book in 1944.\n\n“He can call me Flower if he wants to” the skunk is interesting from today’s perspective in that he is totally accepting of all titles and confident in who he is, especially after a baby deer calls him a “pretty, pretty flower,” which causes him to blush as if he is in love with the “young prince of the forest.” (Sterling Holloway voices Flower as an adult.)\n\nYet make no mistake: all of these characters are strictly heterosexual and only “twitterpate” with the opposite gender. Thumper even gets mighty excited with his big feet (and we all know what big feet symbolize) when a false eyelash-ed and rosy cheeked female bunny fondles his…er…ears.\n\nLike Friend Owl, I was always annoyed with all of the twitterpating involved. Why doesn’t this movie get to the point? Apparently there was plenty of that going on after the war and a whole new generation was getting created much like the many baby animals featured in the movie’s finale. Spring time overtakes the burned out ashes of the great fire just as many contemporary audiences were hoping Europe and the world would rejuvenate after wartime.\n\nBig Joel on YouTube has an interesting video title “How Disney Plays with Nature” that not just focuses on the Disneyesque approach to “mother nature” but also how the movie reflects pre-Eisenhower Era family norms.\n\nAfter his introduction, the Great Prince of the Forest only re-appears after mother’s death to get junior to fend for himself and then, later on, commands him that “you must get up” when he is injured. While this may reflect nature (since bucks are generally not involved in fawn rearing), it also reflects the broken family situations commonplace during the Depression and war years, especially with so many daddies having to go far away and/or spend long hours for work and armed conflict.\n\nIn many ways, the father-son relationship here was not unlike that of Walt and Roy Disney’s with their own stern father Elias. In addition, Thumper’s dad is never shown but referenced when his mother disciplines him…as many mothers often did at the time when their husbands couldn’t.\n\nA BAMBI II direct-to-DVD version was released in January 2006 that, like so many book and toy variations, reflected the changing times. It was not really a sequel but a fill-in-the-blanks revision of sorts…and a disaster in my opinion despite impressive animation by Australia’s Disneytoon Studios. It showed a juvenile Bambi seeking daddy love because…well…daddies are supposed to be kinder, gentler and more involved with their children by the 21st century.\n\nThen again, I should not be too critical of what the Disney staff has done with Felix Salten’s original over the decades, since at least 15%-20% of the original content has been left in. This contrasts with, say, Daniel P. Mannix’s original version of THE FOX AND THE HOUND, a novel even more violent than BAMBI but transformed into one very alien looking, Gerber-fed fluff ball of entertainment.\n\nIn January 2020, a cgi reboot was announced by Disney to be starting production, making this the latest in a long line of old animated features getting a new face lift for a newer generation. It should be most interesting…\n\nWhat keeps the original alive today is how it presents childhood in all of its myriad of experiences. We see the deer learn to walk for the first time, talk for the first time, walk on snow, skate on ice and even experience hunger as so many children did during times of economic depression and war. There are also those little moments like his first reflection in the water surface…seeing himself for the first time, which leads to him seeing Faline for the first time as a reflection of his own reflection. We see him afraid of thunder showers and lightning, but deal with the harsh aspects of life…and death…and overcome it."
