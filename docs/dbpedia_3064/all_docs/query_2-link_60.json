His recurring cast of characters and American landscape was perhaps the most controversial of his canon; it was felt by many at the time to be a disappointing successor to Slaughterhouse-Five, which had made Vonnegut's literary reputation.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nKurt Was Right to Grade This a C\n\nBy Dubi on 01-10-16\n\nMonsters and How to Tame Them\n\nBy: Kevin Hart\n\nNarrated by: Kevin Hart\n\nLength: 5 hrs and 37 mins\n\nOriginal Recording\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 1,927\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 1,715\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 1,708\n\nMonsters and How to Tame Them is Kevinâ€™s most recent guide on how to live your best life, wrapped in his signature honesty, hilarious voice, and adept storytelling.

If she talked about her work, sheâ€™d tell you she only pilfers organs for medical research and that she only takes one kidney, and she only steals those kidneys from dishonest people. Itâ€™s hell on her social life. Abe is the doctor and Sam's partner in crime. He isnâ€™t much of a criminal. Except for the kidney stealing. But heâ€™s using that money to fund his research that he anticipates will be able to cure diabetes. So, all for a good cause...? You decide. Of course, it's hell on his social life.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nDumb and funny\n\nBy R.
