        "text": "The Studio System\n\nDuring the 1930’s up till the 1960’s 5 film studio’s controlled the film industry in America, each studio had a unique style of filmmaking:\n\nRKO Pictures\n\nRKO is well known for its Musicals\n\nRKO was very experimental and tried other genres of film, including film noir\n\nRKO is best known for the film, Citizen Kane (Welles, 1941)\n\nWarner Brothers\n\n‘The Studio of the Working Class’\n\nBesides a financial crash, Warner was famous for its low budget films.\n\nWarner was well known at the time for Footlight Parade (Bacon and Berkeley, 1931)\n\nMGM\n\nThe biggest studio out of the 5\n\nMGM or Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was founded by Marcus Loew and Louis B. Mayer in 1924\n\nWell known for the film, The Wizard of Oz (Fleming, 1939)\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nParamount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world\n\nParamount nearly collapsed during The Great Depression\n\nParamount was best known for Morocco (Von Sternberg, 1930)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nFox became popular due to its chief director, John Ford\n\nFox is well known for The Grapes of Wrath (Ford, 1941)\n\nThe Little Three\n\nAs well as the big five, three other smaller film studios were present during the studio system: Universal, Columbia and United Artists. Universal is the oldest out of the little three, Columbia became the home of screwball comedy films in the 1930’s and United Artists was formed by four actors who wanted to take back control of their careers, the biggest name from the four was Charlie Chaplin.\n\nVertical Integration\n\nVertical Integration meant that these major studio’s were dominating the film industry. They were not only producing the films, they were also marketing the films to be shown in the cinemas that the studio owned. This made it very difficult for many independent filmmakers to showcase their films. During production, the studio would provide the funds for the film, the director, the actors and technicians who all had contracts with the studio.\n\nThe Star System and Unbreakable Contracts\n\nThe star system was a way for the big studio’s to promote their films through the use of using studio owned actors, when under contract these actors could only work for that specific studio and would be paid at the end of the contract. Owning their own stars allowed the studio’s to attract audience attention for the film, especially if their favourite film star was in it. The star system also encouraged the idea of the film stars being acclaimed and well known, which would increase the sales made on a film. These contracts were unbreakable which meant many actors stayed with the studio for a long time until their contract was up.\n\nClassic Hollywood Style\n\nThe classic Hollywood style consists of a 3 act structure which introduced the characters and setting, a problem that is introduced and how the problem is solved. An example of this is the plot of Casablanca (Curtiz, 1942) which introduces Rick and the other characters followed by the introduction of the problem of the film, in this case its helping Lazlo escape Casablanca and this problem is then solved. Continuity editing is also a major part of the classic Hollywood since it focused the film on a clear smooth flowing story. Time remains linear and each plot point is motivated, meaning it has a beginning, middle and end. The environments created on set are also very realistic and in some cases exotic, this is done to make the set believable to the viewer.\n\nWarner Brothers’ House Style\n\nBeing the ‘Studio of the Working Class’ the Warner Brothers House Style is very realistic and has a focus on current events which would appeal to the working class. The main focus during the Golden Age of Hollywood was the Great Depression in America which made the film relatable and appealing to the working class. The house style often included Urban settings and environments, the style is also fast pace and uses quick dialogue to develop the plot. Unlike other studio’s, Warner focused on the personalities of the actors rather than their appearances. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, Warner was well known for ‘Hard Hitting’ Films, Gangster films and Action-adventure films."
