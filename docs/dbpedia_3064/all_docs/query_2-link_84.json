        "meta_description": "The Great Gildersleeve was a radio situation comedy broadcast in the United States from August 31, 1941 to 1958. Initially written by Leonard Lewis Levinson, it was one of broadcast history's earliest spin-off programs. The series was built around Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, a regular character from the radio situation comedy Fibber McGee and Molly. The character was introduced in the October 3, 1939, episode (number 216) of that series. Actor Harold Peary had played a similarly named character, Dr. Gildersleeve, on earlier episodes. The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1940s.<br /><br />The show was set in Summerfield, Ohio, and followed the life of Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, a retired pharmacist who was now the water commissioner of Summerfield. Gildersleeve was a pompous and opinionated man, but he was also kind-hearted and well-meaning. He was often at odds with his housekeeper, Bertha, and his niece, Marjorie, but he loved them both dearly.<br />The Great Gildersleeve was a popular show that was praised for its humor and its realistic portrayal of small-town life. It was also notable for its use of sound effects, which were used to create a realistic atmosphere for the show.<br /><br />The show was cancelled in 1958, but it has been revived several times since then. In 1955, it was remade as a television series, which ran for one season. In 1999, it was remade again as a radio series, which ran for two seasons.<br /><br />The Great Gildersleeve is a classic American comedy that is still enjoyed by audiences today. It is a heartwarming and funny look at small-town life and the American dream.<br /><br />Listen to our radio station Old Time Radio <a href='https://link.radioking.com/otradio' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://link.radioking.com/otradio</a><br /><br />Listen to other Shows at My Classic Radio <a href='https://www.myclassicradio.net/' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://www.myclassicradio.net/</a><br /><br />Remember that times have changed, and some shows might not reflect the standards of today’s politically correct society.
