        "text": "LIKE the studio it is celebrating, “The RKO Years” is a disarmingly unpretentious, somewhat ragged documentary. The program, narrated by Joseph Cotten, who appears in a small studio with a few skimpy props, can be seen tonight at 10 on WOR/Channel 9, which happens to be an RKO Television station.\n\nRKO was, in 1928, one of the last major Hollywood studios to be established and, 30 years later, among the first to close. In the 20's, the company was already in the radio business and was a major manufacturer of sound equipment. With the advent of “talkies,” its entry into the movie business was merely an extension of its interests.\n\nOver the years, RKO Pictures became notorious for its management shake‐ups. The corporate image always remained slightly fuzzy. And the RKO product was wildly uneven, careening between a few triumphs and a gigantic pile of B features. It was impossible to predict what would be found behind the familiar logo of the radio tower straddling a globe and sending out in Morse code the message “A Radio Picture.”\n\nObviously, this documentary, produced and directed by Kerry Sullivan, stresses the more impressive of RKO's accomplishments. The list may be short — barely enough to flesh out an hour — but it is surprisingly choice: “King Kong,” “Flying Down to Rio,” “Little Women,” “Top Hat,” “Follow the Fleet,” “Gunga Din,” “Suspicion,” “She Wore a Yellow Ribbon” and — itself enough to win the studio a permanent place in film history — “Citizen Kane.”\n\nScenes from the films are interspersed with interviews featuring several RKO veterans. George Cukor, the director, remembers the small studios as being very accessible. He admits to being impressed “in retrospect.” Harriet Hilliard describes the film lot as “a small college campus — really like a dormitory.” Ginger Rogers vigorously defends the old ways: “What does an audience want? They want escape.”\n\nDuring the World War II years, that escape took the form of such pictures as “Hitler's Children,” in which the hero, being shown the sterilization of women, turns to his suave German hosts and says, “You are barbarians, aren't you.” In the 1950's, RKO was producing “The Thing.” When the studio closed in 1958, the RKO library was sold to television.\n\nPerhaps RKO's peculiar style grew out of the fact that it had no style in the sense that the Warner Bros. style was Bette Davis dramatics or 20th CenturyFox's was Betty Grable musicals. RKO was simply accessible. The director Pandro Berman notes, “It made almost anything and everything.”\n\nThat is the primary reason for its being remembered so fondly.\n\nMr. Cukor: “It seemed a lot of fun.”\n\nMiss Rogers: “I enjoyed every minute.”\n\nSam Jaffe, who played the ‘'Gunga Din” title role: “It was very pleasant.”\n\nSponsored by the Chase Manhattan Bank, tonight's presentation will be run without commercial interruptions."
