        "text": "HONDO said:\n\nMexican Spitfire At Sea ( 1942 )\n\nMexican Spitfire Sees A Ghost ( 1942 )\n\nMexican Spitfire's Blessed Event ( 1943 )\n\nMexican Spitfire RKO film series ( 1939 -1943) known Australian daybills so far.\n\nThe remaining five films from the series that I am seeking daybill images of are -\n\nThe Girl From Mexico ( 1939 )\n\nMexican Spitfire ( 1940 )\n\nMexican Spitfire Out West ( 1940 )\n\nMexican Spitfire's Baby ( 1941 )\n\nMexican Spitfire's Elephant ( 1942 ) Bruce sold two daybills of this title in 1994 and 1995 and I found out today from Matt the images after a search cannot be located.\n\nA long shot I know, but if anyone has any images of these titles they are welcome here.\n\nAn observation of mine regarding the Mexican Spitfire At Sea daybill, is that the Lupe Velez image looks more like Susan Hayward than Lupe.\n\nLupe Velez on the poster image, then the real life Lupe and then Susan Hayward. It it just me thinking this ? Have a close look at Lupe's images that appear on the other two daybills and you will see a better resemblance there.\n\nI am going to take a break for a while from my plans of introducing as many that I can find images of for 1930s - 1940's RKO movie series, including Dick Tracy and Gildersleeve.\n\nI have amended a word. Originally I had typed the word Baby ( repeated the previous film title ) for the last title listed, which should have been Elephant."
