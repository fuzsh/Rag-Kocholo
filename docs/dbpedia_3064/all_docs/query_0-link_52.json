        "meta_description": "Effervescent\r\nchanteuse Sally Baker (Frances Langford) is a success at a nightclub owned by\r\nracketeer Lucky Maddox (Sheldon Leonard)—but when Maddox’s attentions start to\r\ndrift towards a more amorous direction, she decides to go west, young man, go\r\nwest.  She’s received communication from an agent named Phil Merwin (Ray\r\nWalker) that he’ll be able to get her radio work in Los Angeles, and since her\r\nG.I. boyfriend Danny (Robert Clarke) is also bound for the same destination, it\r\nappears to be a most fortuitous time for Sally’s career change.  Mr.\r\nMaddox, on the other hand, is not happy about losing both his meal ticket and\r\nobject of ardor.  So, he sends a couple of his associates (Ralph Peters,\r\nMax Wagner) out to L.A. to keep an eye on his investment.Mr.\r\nMerwin, in the meantime, has turned over his agency to a pair of out-of-work\r\ncomedians, Jerry Miles (Wally Brown) and Mike Strager (Alan Carney)—though the\r\ntwo men are unaware that Merwin’s generosity is due to his having to lam it out\r\nof town to avoid a gambling debt.  Jerry manages to get Sally an audition\r\nwith bandleader Skinnay Ennis that results in a job on his radio show despite\r\nMaddox’s threats to Mike that Sally should refuse the gig.  Both Jerry and\r\nMike find themselves at the mercy of Lucky’s goons and attempt to escape them\r\nby hiding out on radio programs such as Truth or Consequences (featuring\r\nhost Ralph Edwards).  Finally, the authorities round up Lucky and his mob\r\nand Sally and Danny are reunited in time for the fadeout.Radio Stars on Parade (1945) is a bit of a misnomer: the “stars” in the film\r\ncertainly aren’t of the celebrity wattage as some of RKO’s previous\r\nradio-to-film employees like Fibber McGee &amp; Molly and The\r\nGreat Gildersleeve…it focuses more on what might be\r\nmore accurately termed “second bananas” like Ennis and announcer Don\r\nWilson.  The movie was really more of a showcase for the studio’s comedy\r\nteam of Wally Brown and Alan Carney…who appeared in a few films (though not\r\nteamed together) at RKO before The Powers That Be decided to feature them as an\r\nersatz (Bud) Abbott &amp; (Lou) Costello, beginning with the Buck\r\nPrivates-like Adventures of a Rookie in 1943.There\r\nare two schools of thought regarding Brown and Carney.  The one I\r\ngraduated from believes that despite the talents of the two men (Carney, for\r\nexample, was most effective as Cary Grant’s sidekick in Mr. Lucky [1943])\r\nthey had no real chemistry as a comedy team…and many of their features are\r\noften painful to sit through as a result.  (I will make an exception in\r\nthe case of Step Lively [1944], which was a decent musical\r\nremake of the Marx Brothers vehicle Room Service [1938].) \r\nThe other school acknowledges that while the team wasn’t going to measure up to\r\nAbbott &amp; Costello, the two men did what they could with the tools that they\r\nhad.  Two of the Brown-Carney vehicles, Zombies on Broadway (1945)\r\nand Genius at Work (1946), have cult followings owing to the\r\npresence of their co-star, Bela Lugosi.Wally\r\nand Alan play Jerry Miles and Mike Strager in Radio Stars—characters\r\nthat they consistently portrayed in nearly all of their vehicles as a team with\r\nthe exception of Lively and Seven Days Ashore (1944). \r\nFriends of mine who are fans advocate that the two men are unfairly maligned\r\nbecause they rarely got strong material to work with (in Stars, the\r\nanemic script comes courtesy of Monte Brice and Robert E. Kent).  In fact,\r\nwhen revisiting Radio Stars the other day I found myself\r\nlaughing more at Don Wilson than the duo—Don engages in some amusing “hep”\r\nbadinage with Brown’s Miles: “I grab your gab, Gate…you’re lookin’ for a scat\r\ncat who’s a loon for a croon tune…and when I dig, I don’t jig…I’m solid…potato\r\nsolid!”  (Donsy also has a nice joke when doing a commercial for\r\nEnnis’ radio show, sponsored by Paruin’s Vitamin Capsules: “Boys…if your girls\r\nwant to know what makes you so strong…just say…’Honey—that’s because I’m full\r\nof Paruin’s!’”)Radio Stars also\r\nfeatures bandleader Skinnay Ennis and vocalist Frances Langford, who appeared\r\ntogether for a time on Bob Hope’s radio program.  Ennis maintains his\r\neasygoing Southern persona and even gets a song spotlight with his hit “I\r\nCouldn’t Sleep a Wink Last Night.”  Langford, who shares top billing with\r\nBrown and Carney, doesn’t quite fare as well.  Although her singing talent\r\nis evident with such tunes as “Can’t Get Out of This Mood” she’s little more\r\nthan a plot device—it’s difficult to believe that the woman who would later\r\nprove so adept at comedy by playing Blanche Bickerson wasn’t given an\r\nopportunity to do anything but sing and look pretty.  This was Frances’\r\nsecond film with Wally and Alan.  I’ve yet to see their 1944 comedy\r\nmusical Girl Rush…which features the novelty of Robert Mitchum as\r\nan outlaw who disguises himself as a mail order bride at one point in the\r\nmovie.Speaking\r\nof drag—Messrs. Brown and Carney are also forced to don women’s clothing\r\nin Radio Stars…which is worked in cleverly as a stunt on Truth\r\nor Consequences. Consequences host Ralph\r\nEdwards plays himself in both this segment and an earlier sequence that\r\nintroduces the Jerry and Mike characters (with a little pie-throwing at Mr.\r\nStrager). Edwards’ radio show had also been featured in an RKO film three years\r\nearlier, Seven Days’ Leave.  The Truth or\r\nConsequences bits are the comedic highlights of Radio\r\nStars—though I also chuckled during the film’s windup, which features our\r\nheroes barging in on a broadcast of Dick Tracy.  (The\r\nTracy character would be the focus of four RKO programmers beginning the same\r\nyear as Radio Stars on Parade’s release.)Rufe\r\nDavis, who fans might recognize as conductor Floyd Smoot from TV’s Petticoat\r\nJunction (as well as a frequent B-western sidekick), has his\r\nmoments as a sound patterns engineer (even singing a little ditty entitled “The\r\nSound Effects Man”).  Sheldon Leonard performs what he could probably have\r\ndone in his sleep by that point in his career: the menacing gangster, though he\r\nalso conducts a brief masquerade as a courtly Southern attorney. \r\nSharp-eyed viewers will also spot character veterans like Emory Parnell (as a\r\ncop—there’s a stretch) and Jack Rice as a persnickety usher whose attempts to\r\noust Leonard’s goons from the Consequences studio are\r\ndoomed to fail. Radio Stars was directed by comedy\r\nveteran Leslie Goodwins, who also helmed many of RKO’s Mexican Spitfire vehicles. \r\nA news item in The Hollywood Reporter from that period noted\r\nthat RKO executives were so pleased with the first cut of the film that they\r\nplanned to do a few more films featuring radio personalities…but none of these\r\nproductions came to pass.Radio Stars on Parade is by no means a great film…but the novelty of its radio\r\nbackground and spotlight on familiar “second bananas” surely make it a\r\ncuriosity to look out for the next time you spot it on the schedule of Turner\r\nClassic Movies.  In the meantime, why not check out Frances Langford\r\nin The Bickersons: Put Out the Lights! and Burns &amp; Allen: Treasury (as\r\nwell as the 1946 feature People are Funny, another\r\nfun radio-based film).  Don Wilson and Sheldon Leonard can be heard in\r\nmany of Radio Spirits’ Jack Benny collections…but\r\nyou’ll also enjoy hearing Leonard as “Grogan” in such Phil Harris-Alice Faye\r\ncompilations as Private Lives and Wonga and in dramatic\r\nshowcases on Suspense, The Line Up and Richard Diamond, Private Detective.",
