        "text": "For the May 15, 2014 club meeting, we feature RKO’s great cowboy duo: Tim Holt and George O’Brien.\n\nThe Cowboy Hall of Fame inducted Tim Holt (1918-1973) after he enjoyed a successful career in radio, movies and television. As a top-notch cowboy star for RKO pictures, Holt earned the prestige of being a top money-making Western star.\n\nHolt was part of the “Holt Dynasty” consisting of his dad, Jack Holt and his lovely sister Jennifer. Together, they filled movie screens for decades!\n\nIn between making films, George O’Brien (1900-1985) became a naval officer and retired as a Rear Admiral. Fox and RKO Studios kept this muscular actor busy for almost twenty years.\n\nGeorge O’Brien’s heroism was not confined to the movie screen. He served in four wars, including World Wars I and II.\n\nOur first feature will be Sagebrush Law (RKO, 1943) starring Tim Holt, Cliff Edwards and Joan Barclay. The second feature will be Timber Stampede (RKO, 1939) starring George O’Brien, Chill Wills and Marjorie Reynolds.\n\nAlso this month, we begin a new serial: Raiders of Ghost City (Universal, 1944) starring Dennis Moore, Wanda McKay, Lionel Atwill and many more.\n\nSee you there, pardner!"
