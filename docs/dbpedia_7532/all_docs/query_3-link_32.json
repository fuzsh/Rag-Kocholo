        "text": "Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said there is much to learn from reading Das Kapital. What is it?\n\nWritten in the middle of the 19th Century by German philosopher and economist Karl Marx, Das Kapital is essentially a description of how the capitalist system works and how, Marx claims, it will destroy itself.\n\nMarx had already set out his ideas on class struggle - how the workers of the world would seize power from the ruling elites - in the Communist Manifesto and other writings.\n\nDas Kapital is an attempt to give these ideas a grounding in verifiable fact and scientific analysis.\n\nIt is not an easy read. The product of 30 years of work, and Marx's study of the condition of workers in English factories at the height of the industrial revolution, it is part history, part economics and part sociology.\n\nAs Marx's biographer Francis Wheen has pointed out, external, it reads at times like a Gothic novel \"whose heroes are enslaved and consumed by the monster they created\".\n\nIn simple terms, Marx argues that an economic system based on private profit is inherently unstable.\n\nWorkers are exploited by factory owners and don't own the products of their labour, making them little better than machines.\n\nThe factory owners and other capitalists hold all the power because they control the means of production, allowing them to amass vast fortunes while the workers fall deeper into poverty.\n\nThis is an unsustainable way to organise society and it will eventually collapse under the weight of its own contradictions, Marx argues.\n\nHe is not clear about when this will happen, only that it is inevitable. Neither does he explicitly spell out what the communist society that will replace capitalism will look like, only that it will free workers from their servitude (he did not complete work on his theories before his death in 1883 so perhaps he ran out of time).\n\nMarx published the first volume of Das Kapital in 1867, by which time he had settled in London with his family, and was being financially supported by Friedrich Engels, the rich son of a cotton mill owner.\n\nHe continued to refine the ideas set out in the first volume for the rest of his life, although the next two volumes would not appear in print until after his death.\n\nThe ideas contained in Das Kapital would go on to inspire revolutions in Russia, China and many other countries around the world in the 20th Century, as ruling elites were overthrown and private property seized on behalf of the workers."
