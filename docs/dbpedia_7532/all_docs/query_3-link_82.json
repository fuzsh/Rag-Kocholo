        "text": "Marx the Man\n\nKarl Marx, PhD (1818-1883).\n\nMarx was born in Trier, Germany. His Jewish family converted to Christianity (the Lutheran Church) apparently to escape persecution. However, Karl Marx appeared to be a sincere Christian in his youth:\n\nWho was Marx? In his early youth, Karl Marx professed to be and lived as a Christian.\n\nHis first written work is called The Union of the Faithful with Christ. There we read\n\nthese beautiful words:\n\n\"Through love of Christ we turn our hearts at the same time toward our brethren\n\nwho are inwardly bound to us and for whom He gave Himself in sacrifice.\"\n\nMarx knew a way for men to become loving brethren toward one another—Christianity.\n\nHe continues:\n\n\"Union with Christ could give an inner elevation, comfort in sorrow, calm trust, and\n\na heart susceptible to human love, to everything noble and great, not for the sake\n\nof ambition and glory, but only for the sake of Christ.\"\n\nWurmbrand, Marx & Satan, 6\n\nThe story goes that he later became an atheist. However, Richard Wurmbrand makes a compelling argument that Marx became a Satanist in his book Marx & Satan. Like his master Satan, he rebelled against God and aposticized.\n\nBelgium, Germany and France banished him because of his radical teaching of the violent overthrow of governments.\n\nHe seemed to be devoted to his family, although he did not support them very well. A daughter committed suicide. His time was spent in research when he lived in London.\n\nFriedrich Engels helped Karl Marx financially from the Engles' family free enterprise buisness!\n\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels authored the Communist Manifesto in 1848, which summarized communist theory.\n\nOne final contradiction: shortly before he died, he [Karl Marx] made a statement which has puzzled his followers ever since: \"I am not a Marxist.\"\n\n(From the poster \"Great Economists,\" published by Federal Reserve Bank San Francisco; P O Box 7702; San Francisco CA 94120.)\n\nWhy do you think Marx said that he was not a Marxist? I believe that this \"atheist\" knew that he would be facing God soon. \"There are no atheists in foxholes.\" When we are facing death, rationalizations tend to drop. So, if the father of communism denied his own brainchild, why do some still persist in believing in this failed system? Why do we allow communists to teach in our tax-supported colleges?\n\nMarx also called his own writings \"[expletive, meaning excrement]\" (Wurmbrand, Marx & Satan, 11).\n\nThe United States Democratic Party has accepted some of the ideas of Karl Marx. Marxism (communism) has failed. Why would any sane party leadership want to embrace a failed system?\n\nMarx the Misinformed\n\nMarxism is based on three faulty basic assumptions: Atheism, Dialectical materialism and Economic Determinism. [Dr. Fred Schwarz, You Can Trust the Communists (to be Communists) published by the Christian Anti-Communists Crusade; Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1960]. Here is a brief discussion of those basic assumptions:\n\n1. Atheism—denial of the existence of God. Atheism is simply not true:\n\nThe fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good (Psalm 14:1, KJV).\n\nCommunism is both a political ideology and a religion. It is a religion because it makes the metaphysical assumption that God does not exist. This is in the area of metaphysics—the realm of the religious—not the scientific. Marx' claim that his ideology was \"scientific socialism\" is false—it was a religion! If the foundation of a religion, philosophy or ideology is flawed, then the superstructure is flawed also. Leaving God out of one's life is a formula for failure. Marx left his Jewish-Christian roots, possibly in anger.\n\nIf God does not exist, then there are no absolutes: one can lie and kill to achieve his purpose. Communists have followed this immoral and unethical means to their end, which is world domination. If the end is a just society, this would seem to be a noble goal. The problem is this: the end will not be reached and they live in the means, which is immoral and unethical conduct. Hence immoral and unethical conduct characterize communist society. Communists have lied and have murdered millions of innocent people.\n\n(Islam is another political religion. Born from Muhammed's spurious vision, it soon began its goal of world domination and is a danger to Christians, Jews, the free world and their fellow Muslims. However, not every Muslim is a terrorist.)\n\n2. Dialectical materialism—the application of Hegel's dialectic to history. Communists believe in socio-economic evolution. As Karl Marx applied Hegel's dialectic, history is moving toward a classless society and Marx wanted to help it along—it didn't work. However, the redistribution of wealth worked to some extent—it made everyone poor! That is, all except the communist hierarchy.\n\n3. Economic determinism—the means of production determines the type of life of a society.\n\nCommunists and socialists point to the book of Acts, where early Christians sold possessions and gave the money to the poor. However, early Christians voluntarily sold possessions and gave to the poor. The wealthy should give to the poor out of compassion, but if someone forcibly takes their wealth, even to give to the poor, it is still stealing!\n\nIn a practical sense, communism and socialism are self-defeating. When one is punished for working hard by being fined (overtaxed), it discourages hard work. When one is rewarded with welfare payments for doing nothing, it discourages honest work.\n\nWhat a personal tragedy for Karl Marx—his life was wasted and a giant intellect wasted! Inspired by Satan, his life's work became an evil web that entrapped millions and murdered millions.\n\nNOTE: Some general facts were taken from the article, \"Marx, Karl,\" Microsoft ® Encarta ® Encyclopedia 2002. © 1993-2001 Microsoft Corporation. The article was professionally done, but Encarta's positive presentation of Marx is wrong.\n\nThere is a curious mixture in Bill Gates. He seems to push socialistic values and yet the socialist government under former President Clinton brought charges against them. No one is above the law—if they violated the law, they should be punished. However, socialists cannot stand to see someone succeed and become wealthy. The hidden socialistic agenda behind the charges is so apparent.\n\nBill gates believes the lie that the world is overpopulated and therefore supports abortion. See articles on my website concerning the overpopulation myth and the evil of abortion: http://www.jrcministries.org/home.html\n\nIn perspective, what has Bill Gates done? He succeeded in saving others billions of manhours through his software. He made many people wealthy and helped others to become successful. This writer was able to publish truth that the biased liberal media rejected.\n\nMost important: Bill Gates helped expand the Kingdom of God through many ministries that continue to use his software. I am able to have a successful ministry via the Internet. Thank you, Bill Gates.\n\nMay the United States repent and turn to God with all our heart. Then, God will bless the U S A!\n\n© John E.
