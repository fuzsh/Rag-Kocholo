        "text": "On March 14, 1883, Karl Marx died in London. Today, a century later, the man and his ideas continue to arouse intense passions. To true believers, Marx is the messianic father of scientific socialism-concepts called Marxism or Communism. To many others, he is the prophet of an insidious doctrine of class conflict, revolution and economic egalitarianism. Proponents and opponents alike acknowledge his importance and the impact of his philosophy on our era.\n\nThe focus of most advocacy and antagonism has been on Marx's ideas. There has been a cascade of biography describing his life and times, yet all this effort and analysis discloses very little about his human side. Haunted by poverty, irascible, but a kind and loving parent, he was a paradoxical, tormented character. He was a seminal thinker and an impractical man anxiously seeking recognition in a world that to him seemed unaffected by his theories.\n\nA large part of his torment - tensions that possibly affected his work - was lodged in a part of his life that Marx desperately sought to hide. Even today, this secret, which he successfully concealed during his lifetime, is not well known. In 1851, while living in London, Marx fathered an illegitimate son by Helen Demuth, the longtime family maid. Fearing that this indiscretion would destroy his marriage and damage his public image, he organized an effective cover-up, whose participants were Marx's friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels and Helen Demuth."
