        "text": "'Karl Marx was the Jesus Christ of the twentieth century.'\n\nOne of the most influential and controversial political thinkers in history, Marx's critique of capitalism continues to resonate today, in the wake of the recurrent financial crises and growing social inequality.\n\nHaving lived in London from 1849 until his death in 1883, the capital city features a wealth of famous Marx hot spots: from the room where Karl Marx penned Das Kapital, to the pub where Marx and Engels first discussed The Communist Manifesto, and modern-day tributes.\n\nExplore Marx's London below and download the map to take with you. Scroll down for more information about each location.\n\n4 Anderson Street, Chelsea\n\nThe address of Marx’s first home when he first moved to London in 1849. His fourth son, Henry, was born here on Guy Fawkes Night resulting in the nickname Guido.\n\nThe Red Lion, Great Windmill Street, Soho (now Be at One)\n\nThe Second Congress of the Communist League was held in the upstairs room of the Red Lion pub. It was at this meeting that Marx and Engels were asked to write an action programme for the Communist League. This published in Feb 1848 as the Communist Manifesto.\n\nSpirit of Soho Mural, Broadwick Street, Soho\n\nCreated in 1991, the mural depicts St Anne presiding over local famous figures. It shows Karl Marx taking a sip of Coca Cola.\n\nQuo Vadis, Dean Street, Soho\n\nFormerly a brothel and a home to Karl Marx. A blue plaque adorns the frontage of the now restaurant to commemorate the time Marx spent living at 28 Dean Street in the 1850s. A ‘Marx Room’ is available to rent for private functions.\n\nThe British Museum Reading Room\n\nOne of Marx’s favourite places to write, it is here that he worked on his most celebrated book, Das Kapital. His favourite seat was G7.\n\nThe Marx Memorial Library, Clerkenwell Green, Clerkenwell\n\nFounded in 1933 with the aim of advancing knowledge of Marxism and the working class movement. The building was previously home to Twentieth Century Press. William Morris was an early benefactor of the press, which published several of the earliest English editions of the works of Marx and Engels, and was office to Lenin during his exile in London.\n\n1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park Road, Belsize Park\n\nThe address that the Marx family moved to in 1864. The entire area was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War and has since been redeveloped.\n\n41 Maitland Park Road, Belsize Park\n\nJust a few doors down from their previous address, the Marx family moved here in 1875, supposedly because they felt more comfortable in a smaller home. It is here that Karl Marx resided until his death in 1884.\n\n46 Grafton Terrace, Belsize Park (formerly no. 9)\n\nThe Marx residence from October 1856-March 1864, after he left Soho. It is the most intact of all the places he has stayed in London, remaining virtually unchanged since the 1860s. During this time, Engels, who lived in Manchester, helped to subsidise Marx’s writing by giving the family £350 a year (about £35,000 today).\n\n10. Highgate Cemetery (East Cemetery), Swain’s Ln, Highgate"
