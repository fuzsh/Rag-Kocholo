        "text": "Karl Heinrich Marx, author of ‘The Communist Manifesto’ and ‘Capital’, died in London on 14 March 1883.\n\nTo mark the day, we’re sharing a newspaper report of his death and a report on his funeral and burial at Highgate Cemetery.\n\nWe do wonder about the story regarding Marx and Engels almost dying in the Tay Bridge Disaster in 1879. The story goes that they had planned to travel on the ill-fated train while on a lecture tour in Scotland, but one (or both) of them caught a cold, so they changed their travel plans.\n\nIt might just be an urban myth, this story. But if anybody has any definite information about this story, please leave a comment on the blog!"
