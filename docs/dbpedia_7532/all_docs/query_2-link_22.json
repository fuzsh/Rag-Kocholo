A China-donated statue of German philosopher Karl Marx was unveiled on Saturday in his birth town on the 200th anniversary of his birth. (Xinhua/Shan Yuqi)\n\nBRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- People in European cities paid homage to Karl Marx on Saturday, marking the 200th anniversary of the great thinker's birth.\n\nMarx was born in the German city of Trier on May 5, 1818. He died in London in 1883.\n\nGERMANY: UNVEILING OF STATUE\n\nA China-donated statue of Marx was unveiled on Saturday in Trier to commemorate the late bushy-bearded local.\n\nThe statue's height, 5.5 meters (18 feet), was designed in accordance with his birthday -- May 5, its creator Wu Weishan said.\n\nWeighing 2.3 ton, the bronze figure was mounted atop a pedestal in front of a former Marx family home.\n\nMarx, the son of a Jewish lawyer, spent 17 years in Trier, before becoming one of the most influential thinkers in the world.\n\nMarx's ideas are of great value to the world, and in particular had far-reaching influence on China,\" Guo Weimin, deputy director of the State Council Information Office of China, said in a speech to mark the unveiling of the statue.\n\nMalu Dreyer, the governor of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, in which Trier is located, called the statue from China \"a pillar and a bridge for our partnership\".\n\nBRITAIN: INT'L CONFERENCE\n\nIn London, the Marx Memorial Library organized an international conference celebrating Marx's work and exploring the significance of Marxism in the world today.\n\nSpeakers at the conference include John McDonnell, British Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. His speech subject is Marxism as a force for change today.\n\nBen Fine, an economics professor at School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London, told Xinhua at the margin of the conference that what Marx put forward over 100 years ago still has far-reaching impact.\n\nFor westerners, Marx's analysis of capitalism is worth studying, the professor said, underlining that it's of great significance to stage the conference in London, where Marx was laid rest after living for many years.\n\nMeirian Jump, Marx Memorial Library archivist, speaks to begin proceedings during the Marx 200 Conference, organized by the Marx Memorial Library on the bicentenary of Karl Marx's birth, at SOAS university in London, Britain, on May 5, 2018.

So we have speakers from Ireland, Germany, France and Belgium...We want to bring the importance and also the diversity of the ideas of Marx (to the audience),\" he added.\n\nPhoto taken on May 3, 2018 shows the entrance of the exhibition \"Karl Marx 1818-1883.
