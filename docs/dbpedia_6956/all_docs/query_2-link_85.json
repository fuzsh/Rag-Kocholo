        "text": "Cassette tapes have become fashionable again, with a variety of edgy indie, alternative bands highlighting their credentials by turning to tape to differentiate themselves from the MP3 and SoundCloud generation. It may be wilfully Luddite – but with limited runs and early deletions, some collectables of the future will be created today on C60 and C90 formats.\n\nIt’s not the first time cassettes have been the medium of choice for those on the margins of the UK indie scene, of course. Arguably the final wag of punk’s tail, spanning 1979 to about 1983, the cassette scene was vibrant and active, defiantly homemade, often wilfully obscure and little chronicled. As a result, this part of the UK’s musical heritage remains largely unknown or is fast being forgotten.\n\nknown, was the way in which it got people communicating and a sort of world-wide pen-pal social network developed. Indeed this was even encouraged by many artists, who preferred to swap their tapes for other people’s work. The medium offered the musician considerable exposure, while retaining both their independence and freedom, giving the listener access to a wealth of original and interesting music.” Once the word was out, distribution was easy via direct mail and at gigs, while many independent record shops were happy to take a few tapes by local heroes on a sale or return basis. Everything was in place and a few grasped the nettle to set up their own labels, releasing home- and portastudio-recorded material that would appeal to nearly every musical palate, with folkies, poets, singersongwriters, post-punk, oi!, industrial, ambient, electronic, anarchic and all kinds of alternative and prog rock on offer. Admittedly there was also plenty of selfindulgent rubbish as well, but arguably that just added to the charm. The artwork adorning cassette sleeves and inserts from this period was equally home-grown and the general rule of thumb was that hand drawn is best and, more often than not, a quick doodle or a scrawled logo would suffice. Even reproduction of sleeves and inserts was made easy as photocopiers grew more accessible in the workplace, colleges and libraries, and cheap print shops opened on the high street. There was also an interesting subtext that this all took place in the shadow of the “Home Taping is Killing Music” campaign. Re-reading the fanzines of the time, there was a genuine David and Goliath stand-off developing as the indie tape pioneers tackled the big vinyl producers head-on. What worried the majors was that they had no control over what appeared to be a very vibrant scene, which bypassed the traditional routes to market completely – and often gave away music! Most bands were happy to provide a recording of their work for the donation of a C60 and a selfaddressed envelope, and that was anathema to the big labels. There was a genuine feeling that it was time to challenge the established musical hierarchy, and the big industry players took this threat very seriously. There were even dark mutterings that the weekly music press was quietly told to kill off its indie tape coverage or they would find their record company advertising severely curtailed. Allegedly. Wall concludes, “The heady cassette heyday of 1979-1983 was never repeated in the UK. Corporate pressure ensured that both vinyl and cassettes were marginalised and that the CD replaced previous platforms. Yes, cassettes did have an inbuilt fragility, and could be chewed up in tape machines, but for those who made their own music, it is a medium that remains sadly missed.” 1 THE INSTANT AUTOMATONS Eating People – Hints For The Housewife 1980 Deleted DEC003 £20-£30 Instant Automatons were among the earliest of the indie tape label pioneers operating in the postpunk landscape. Their homegrown label, Deleted Records, was founded in late 1978, but the band could trace their roots back to the mid-Seventies. Their first C90 cassette album, Radio Silence – The Art Of Human Error, featured 18 tracks covering their output over the previous two years. Instant Automatons only played around a dozen gigs so were essentially a studio band – their recorded output was prodigious, however, and included six cassettes, vinyl and latterly CD compilations of their work. The band were happy to distribute material free of charge (FOC) if sent a tape and a stamped self-addressed envelope, and were to become embroiled with the Street Level Studios crowd, playing the Acklam Hall gigs in 1980. The Automatons claim that Hawkwind, Faust, Can, Kraftwerk and Gong inspired their music and if you put those bands in a punk blender and chuck in some home-made synthesisers you get a rough approximation of their sound – The Residents meets early Human League by way of some good old fashioned British whimsy. Great cover versions as well – their deconstruction of the Hendrix classic If 6 Was 9 graces Eating People. There is an excellent Instant Automatons resource on the web (instant-automatons. com) 2 CLAIRE THOMAS & SUSAN VEZEY Reprint 1980, photocopied cover on blue card, Snatch Tapes TCH220 £20-£30 Claire Thomas & Susan Vezey were a pseudonym for Snatch Tapes labelowner Philip Sanderson. A spoof press release was issued which cast them as a pre- Raphaelite synthesizer duo and actually persuaded Cherry Red to sign “them” for the compilation LP Perspectives & Distortion. The Reprint tape featured four tracks, Under Press Of Sail plus three tracks of loops and treatments, although versions with an additional track, Nein, Nein, Nein, are known to exist. Snatch Tapes focused on DIY experimental and electronic music and put out its first compilation, Snatch 1, in 1979 – two further compilations followed, as well as a number of individual and collaborative tapes. The label’s output included one tape with an edition of just five copies (although a further 25 were made available with a different sleeve). Wonderful, inventive, esoteric stuff and perfectly representative of the early cassette scene. 3 VARIOUS Back To Sing Again For Free Again Soon Fuck Off Records FUCK OFF 1 1979 Photocopied cover and labels. £30-£40 Fuck Off issued tapes from 1979 onwards and was linked with Street Level Studios, as both were run by Keith Dobson, former Here & Now drummer (aka Kif Kif le Batteur). Thus if you recorded at Street Level there was a fair chance material would appear on Fuck Off records, as was the case with Mark Perry/ ATV/Good Missionaries and The Androids Of Mu. Tapes were produced in relatively small runs – 50 to 100 according to archives – and the individual labels of Fuck Off and Weird Tapes seem pretty interchangeable. Back To Sing For Free Again Soon, Fuck Off’s first tape, was released in 1979, and features a number of live performances, including the legendary Danny and The Dressmakers at the Deeply Vale Festival near Rochdale in 1978, The Astronauts (often listed as Astronaughts) recorded at Warwick University in December 1978 and Wilful Damage at Bolton Tech. The Planet Gong track Psychedelic Man (aka Opium For The People) comes from an unidentified French concert recorded late in 1977. The balance of the tracks are studio, four-track or front-room recordings and include Alternative TV, Dick Heley, Anal Surgeons and Dog Ends. Includes a photocopied numbered handdrawn cover and hand-written liner notes with the following warning: “Some parts of this cassette are decidedly lo-fi (that means diabolical sound quality) although most of it ain’t too bad. We reckon if you like at least two of the bands, it aint a bad deal” (sic). It also warns against buying the tape just for the Planet Gong track! 4 VARIOUS Standard Response Sterile Records SRC 1 1979 £40+ for first edition of 30 copies Compilation featuring Leif Thuresson, Moving Finger, Lieutenant Murnau, SM Andrews, Cultural Amnesia, Organbank, The Nocturnal Emissions, MB, Murderwerkers,\n\nThat would be negligent in the extreme, because the scene was a fertile breeding ground for all sorts of musical endeavour. While no one would argue it shaped the next decade of pop, it did set the ground rules of independent music – sharing, swapping, networking – and kept the punk attitude very much alive. Plus without indie cassettes, we’d have had no C81, and therefore no C86, which in turn lit the blue touch paper of Britpop.\n\nGeoff Wall, who is arguably the leading chronicler of the early cassette culture through the publication of Stick It In Your Ear fanzine (siiye.co.uk) highlights the vibrancy of the early scene, saying, “It can now be seen as a continuation of Punk’s Do-It-Yourself ethic. The cassette was adopted by people who produced every conceivable type of music at a grass-roots level.\n\n“It was ideal for distributing little-known, or minority interest music, as any taped performance was copied in small or large numbers, easily and as required. No expensive record cutting or complex manufacturing processes were needed, and many people simply copied them to order, sold them at gigs or through specialist shops, or via mail order. The cheapness of cassettes not only gave excellent value for money, but provided an alternative forum accessible to everybody. Some bands even bought bargain-bin cassettes, placed Sellotape over the lug, and recorded their music over the original album. Now that’s recycling!”\n\nWhen it came to promoting tapes, there was a competitive established music press – NME, Sounds, Melody Maker, Zig Zag – all eagerly looking for the next music trend and who all (eventually) supported the indie tape scene in one way or another. There was also an extensive regional independent fanzine network, desperate for something to write about beyond what was happening in their own back yard.\n\nWall adds, “Another interesting aspect of ‘the DIY Scene’ as it became commonly known, was the way in which it got people communicating and a sort of world-wide pen-pal social network developed. Indeed this was even encouraged by many artists, who preferred to swap their tapes for other people’s work. The medium offered the musician considerable exposure, while retaining both their independence and freedom, giving the listener access to a wealth of original and interesting music.” Once the word was out, distribution was easy via direct mail and at gigs, while many independent record shops were happy to take a few tapes by local heroes on a sale or return basis.

A spoof press release was issued which cast them as a pre- Raphaelite synthesizer duo and actually persuaded Cherry Red to sign “them” for the compilation LP Perspectives & Distortion.

Thus if you recorded at Street Level there was a fair chance material would appear on Fuck Off records, as was the case with Mark Perry/ ATV/Good Missionaries and The Androids Of Mu.

It also warns against buying the tape just for the Planet Gong track!\n\n4 VARIOUS\n\nStandard Response Sterile Records SRC 1 1979 £40+ for first edition of 30 copies\n\nCompilation featuring Leif Thuresson, Moving Finger, Lieutenant Murnau, SM Andrews, Cultural Amnesia, Organbank, The Nocturnal Emissions, MB, Murderwerkers, Johnny Alien, Loss Of Head. Standard Response was originally issued with a booklet in a print run of just 30 copies. There was subsequently a larger run published without the booklet. Collectors of the industrial genre covet it because of the Murderwerkers track, which was the first published recording of the late Geoff Rushton (aka John Balance of Coil).\n\nSterile Records was formed in London in 1979 by Nigel Ayers and the late Caroline K of the post-industrial music group (The) Nocturnal Emissions. Their label focused on the industrial, arty, noise end of the spectrum and took inspiration from the French musique concrète movement, Fluxus (a blending of different artistic media), conceptual art and the spontaneity and energy of punk rock. The label also released numerous vinyl records and several videos.\n\nNigel Ayers comments, “My intention was to put out a multimedia release to bring together the output of a number of cultural workers I had been exchanging tapes and mail art with. This was in the days when multimedia didn’t mean something to do with computers, it was an art term which could mean anything – in this case it meant a cassette and a photocopied document. Though I no longer have the original package, I remember the cover had a picture of the Russian SS20 missiles. This was at the height of the Cold War, so it probably accounts for the bleak nature of the European contributions.”\n\n5 THE CLEANERS FROM\n\nVENUS Blow Away Your Troubles Man at the Off-Licence Tapes WOW 002 Mono, 1981, on a variety of cassette media £20-£30\n\nThe Man at the Off-Licence label was founded to promote The Cleaners From Venus, a band synonymous with the independent cassette ethic. Main songwriter Martin Newell was a dedicated advocate of producing music outside of the manipulations of the music business, recording material at home or latterly in a friend’s garden shed and producing and distributing it as cheaply as possible.\n\nNewell comments, “In fact our first cassette album was made in my bedroom with a Rolf Harris Stylophone and all sorts of stuff. It says on the back, ‘This album was made completely with home-made gear and now go out and do it yourselves. It’s your music; take it back from the corporations.’ ”\n\nAlthough Newell didn’t know at the time, the first Cleaners tape was issued on cassettes shoplifted by another band member, enabling it to be distributed for free! Newell continues to make elegant, melodic, guitarbased pop today – a true treasure of the indie scene. A number of Martin’s tapes have been re-released in their native format on the US label Burger; check out his website (martinnewell.co.uk).\n\n6 SCROTUM POLES\n\nAuchmithie Calling C30 One Tone Tapes ERECT 1, 1979, 100 copies £25-£30\n\nThe brilliantly named Scrotum Poles hailed from Dundee, Scotland, and are often compared to the Television Personalities, with whom they shared an ear for an amusing lyric, a low-rent DIY tune and a comedy pseudonym. In 1979 their own label, One Tone, released the seminal Auchmithie Calling – a direct riposte to the Clash’s London Calling (Auchmithie being a small fishing village three miles north of Arbroath and home of the Arbroath Smokie, a famous Scottish smoked haddock delicacy). Only 100 were made (cassettes, not the Smokie) and – according to the band’s website – the tape is very poor quality, as the copies were produced free of charge as a favour.\n\nThe band on Auchmithie Calling were Craig Methven (Smeg Pole) vocals, Steve Grimmond (Sid Gripple) bass, Colin Smith (Stripey Sleep) guitar, Ronnie Lawson (rhythm guitar) and Matho on drums. Craig Methven recalls, “We advertised it in Sounds and it sold out immediately even though we hadn’t got all the tapes copied by that time – we thought we would sell three or four. In the end we got a mate, Gerry, at Dundee College of Education to copy it for us. Gerry wouldn’t take any money for it so we bought him a pint.”\n\nSome of this material has latterly been released on CD by Messthetics and on the Auchmithie Forever CD.\n\n7 CONTROLS\n\nSock It To ’Em, Dave Stupid Rabbit Tapes SRT001, 1980, four-track EP hand-drawn photocopied A4 insert/ cover, C30, circa 300 copies, £10-£20\n\nA small but early (founded 1979) indie, Stupid Rabbit Tapes was active throughout the 80s and issued cassettes sporadically into the 90s. In the early days, the label was an outlet for Fleet-based punk band Controls featuring Melvyn Crawford, Jon Monks, Tim Naylor and Kerry Kirk. Recorded live in a rehearsal studio (actually a breeze-block sports hall), these lo-fi but ferocious recordings of post-punk pop songs sold well off the back of a mention in Sounds, a year or so before the music papers started paying real attention to the scene. A slight hiccup occurred when the Sounds piece actually appeared before the tape was prepared, however, as Jon Monks recalls.\n\n“Tim wrote to the music press on a whim without telling anyone and had forgotten all about it. Sounds eventually put a small report on their news page in the New Year and in days we were receiving offers for distribution, publishing, fanzine interviews and punters sending in their £1 payments… unfortunately we had nothing to send them as the tape didn’t actually exist. We spent hours one Sunday going through old rehearsal tapes and by the end of the day cobbled together the four tracks that made up the Sock It To ’Em, Dave EP.”\n\n8 FUNBOY FIVE\n\nThe Funboy Five Shall Inherit The Earth Cool-Cat-Daddy-O PHUN 2, 1980, £10-£20\n\nThis compilation tape brings together the original three-track demo recorded by the Funboy Five at Quest Studios and the four tracks recorded for their John Peel session. Reviewed in the debut issue of Stick It In Your Ear zine, the FB5 were commended for their sensitive use of “Sooty-style” organ on Life After Death – high praise indeed.\n\nFounded by Mick Sinclair, Cool-Cat- Daddy-O was initially a vehicle for the Funboy Five vinyl single (Life After Death/ Compulsive Eater, Phun 1) but developed to include numerous other projects, including several cassette-only releases. Now a well-established author and music commentator, Mick Sinclair went on to write the Your Cassette Pet column in Sounds, bringing much-needed publicity to the tape pioneers.\n\n9 PERFORMING FERRETS\n\nThe Ferretable Thing Dead Hippy Tapes DHC2, 1979, 200 copies £10-£20\n\nHailing from Maidstone, latterly scattered across the UK as the four members attended different colleges, Performing Ferrets tick the familiar DIY boxes by marrying elements of The Fall, TV Personalities and Gang Of Four into their sound. John Peel once claimed he rarely did a gig without a Ferret trying to push a demo tape into his hand. The Ferretable Thing was recorded in Rochester and was reviewed favourably in Sounds. Dead Hippy Tapes was founded by Dave Arnold and issued a number of tapes by bands from the Maidstone area.\n\n10 VARIOUS\n\nRising From The Red Sand Volume One Third Mind Records TMT04, 1982, red or blue plastic clamshell case with b/w insert £40-£50\n\nCompilation featuring Chris & Cosey/ Attrition/ Legendary Pink Dots/ Konstruktivits/ Pseudo Code/ Nurse With Wound/Sutcliffe Jügend/ DDAA/Human Flesh/John Hurst/Section 25. Third Mind Records was a hugely influential label serving the industrial/noise scene founded by Gary Levermore that grew out of a fanzine he founded in 1981. Third Mind issued a number of cassettes in the early 80s, including five volumes of Rising From The Red Sand, each packed with prime movers from the industrial scene, as well as work from the second wave of industrial bands such as In The Nursery, The Legendary Pink Dots, Portion Control and Test Dept. The label was part-funded by the Enterprise Allowance Scheme in its early days and ran for many years.\n\n11 THE INSANE PICNIC\n\nFour Days In April Falling A Records EBS3, 1981, circa 750 copies £10-£20\n\nThe insane picnic – Peter Ashby, Barry Douglas Lamb and Owen Turley – released material on Falling A Records, the Clacton-on-Sea indie label and shop. Four Days In April, their debut cassette EP from 1981, features four tracks of guitar-based left-field pop that brings to mind early Pere Ubu, particularly on Heartbreak Party. It went on to sell 750 copies.\n\nFalling A was founded by Peter Ashby and Barry Lamb. It released around 150 cassettes between 1977 and 1985, as well as distributing several hundred DIY cassettes for other labels and numerous fanzines, including many featured in this article. Barry Lamb says, “Peter and myself are still working together. We briefly revived Falling A between 2004-2009, producing CDs, including one compilation, Oxide Revolution, which was supposed to be the first in a series documenting the indie cassette scene. We still record together as well and have released some solo records as well as working briefly with Keith Levene (PiL), Jasun Martz (Frank Zappa) and presently Tor Cesay (Mongrel).”\n\n12 VARIOUS\n\nBits C60 X-Cassettes X005, 1981, issued with B&W printed cover and labels, with accompanying eight-page printed A5 insert in clear zip-top bag. Circa 250 copies. £20-£30 with all inserts\n\nCompanion fanzine also produced tape compilation featuring diG! dig! DiG!/The English Subtitles/ The Sleepers/ Attrition/The Lines/ Tiny Holes/ Sonderkommando/Dogma Cats/Laurence- Shorthouse/Between Pictures/The Influence/ Sub-Active/ Total Chaos/Controls/The Stills/ Judy Nylon/Electralips/3 Way Dance/ Customer Service.\n\nReading-based X-Cassettes was established by Chris Green and Richard Griffin (the latter from No Cure fanzine) to deliver a platform for local bands, and produced a fistful of tapes in 1981 and 1982. The label morphed into Criminal Damage whose output included vinyl from The Membranes, Leather Nun, Ausgang, The Destructors, Mighty Ballistics Hi-Power and many others.\n\nBits delivered a high-quality product that a major label might have put out – with (mainly) professionally recorded tracks from all over the UK and beyond, but done on a shoestring budget.\n\n13 APF BRIGADE\n\nLive Brigade self issued, no label 1982, free for supplied cassette plus SAE, each containing a unique live performance, photocopied cover £20-£30\n\nAPF Brigade were an anarcho-punk duo (Andy X-port and Jon Hindle) from Peterborough and stalwarts of the cassette culture scene in the early 80s, issuing a number of tapes promoting their anarchist message. Amazingly every copy of this first release was individually recorded live in Hindle’s garage, making each a unique artefact, with different order of tracks and quality of performance. Apparently the band performed no gigs unless there were bystanders for their garage performances.\n\nAndy X-port continues to be a major player in the DIY/alternative scene with his Manhate band/project/label, which issues material free of charge. The info for Live Brigade was supplied by the UK82 website – it is unknown how other tapes may vary.\n\n14 STRIPEY ZEBRAS\n\nLive in Burnett’s Bedroom New Crimes Tapes, NC1 £20-£30\n\nThe burgeoning late-70s Southend punk scene spawned a number of tape labels including New Crimes Tapes, Blot Tapes, Get Tapes, Menshintsvo and Necrology. Stripey Zebras were a short-lived but much-loved post-punk outfit influenced by The Fall, The Residents and Sparks. They combined enthusiasm and wackiness in equal amounts with infrequent but legendary live shows. Stripey Zebras were namechecked in Smash Hits (top 10 bands named after animals, beating Adam & The Ants) and in NME. Some of their song titles made it into the Obscurist Charts in Sounds – Meteorites in My Brain, Greta Garbo Goes Shopping, Sore Eyes Party – and in many ways Live in Burnett’s Bedroom captured the very essence of the UK DIY cassette scene.\n\n15 HILARY & THE HUMMINGBIRDS\n\nDon’t Forget To Turn Me On Erasehead Cassettes ERC 5, 1981, £20-£30\n\nErasehead Cassettes was a DIY cassette label run by Pete Woodin in the early 1980s, mostly to publish home-made music by himself and friends, including partner Hilary Thompson and Pete (Scoop) Thompson and Ed Pinsent.\n\nHilary & The Hummingbirds offer a collection of cover versions of pop songs from the 1950s and 1960s, including Alma Cogan’s Sugar Time and Russ Hamilton’s We Will Make Love. Hilary raided her parents’ record collection, played the records into headphones and sang along to them, just taping her voice. Woodin, Scoop and others added the musical backdrops and backing vocals, using minimal drum machine and guitar parts. In some cases a snatch from the record itself is dropped in. Archetypal DIY meets easy-listening lift Muzak – casually inventing sampling between floors.\n\nEd Pinsent recalls, “Pete [Woodin] preferred to trade than sell. He saw it as an egalitarian thing, and always liked the idea that if he sent a tape to someone who hated the music, they could tape over it. User-friendly recycling. Everything was produced by economical means – whatever the listener heard was usually a second or third generation copy, and the covers were all photocopied.”\n\n16 THE KRONSTADT\n\nUPRISING The First Recording (KU Demo No#1) Menshintsvo Tapes M/ ANOK1, 1981, £10-£20\n\nWhile the 7” single was the natural medium for punk, many bands cut their teeth with demo sessions or live recordings issued on cassette. The Kronstadt Uprising were a well-known punk band from Southend-on-Sea, formed in 1981 from the wreckage of an earlier punk band, The Bleeding Pyles, founded by drummer Steve Pegrum in 1980. Many local musicians passed through the band and this tape features former Bleeding Pyles’ guitarist Spencer Blake on vocals, Paul Lawson on guitar, Mick Grant, bass and Pegrum. The band kept going with a frequently changing line-up until 1987. The Southend cassette scene is well worth investigating and there is an excellent resource at southendpunk.com.\n\n17 THE FRESHIES\n\nAll Sleeps Secrets Razz CS1 C60, 1979, 1,000 copies £20-£30\n\nPoster boy for the emerging cassette scene in the 1980s, the much-missed Chris Sievey had been operating his Razz label since the mid-seventies and was responsible for over 60 cassette-only releases. Purveyor of great tunes and harmonies, Chris blazed a modest path across pop’s firmament until he hit big with the buzzsaw melodies of I’m In Love With The Girl On A Certain Manchester Megastore Checkout Desk (it was Virgin, by the way).\n\nThere are doubts as to when All Sleeps Secrets actually appeared – contemporary reviews say it was recorded in 1978 and issued in 1979, whereas others suggest it was recorded by Chris in 1975 and re-released as Freshies product. Pretty much a concept album, it starts with an alarm clock being wound, then each track represents a different dream. It had a fairly racy hand-illustrated sleeve featuring twin girls – one topless.\n\n18 THE GESTALT\n\nFuneral Party Fashions C60, Goldfish 001, 1983 £10-£20\n\nAn anthology of The Gestalt’s studio recordings between 1979-83, with 18 tracks featured in total. A doomy synth, bass, guitar and drum combo who added Louise Tierney on vocals and took the pop high road as a result, becoming The Primary.\n\nGoldfish was a Cambridge-based indie founded by Steve Hartwell and Peter Skelley, and named after a radio show they broadcast on Imperial College Radio. Hartwell also had links to Stick It In Your Ear magazine. They had to change the label name from Goldfish to Peeved Records due to a production company with the same name.\n\n19 VARIOUS\n\nThe Last Supper Adventures In Reality ARR 007, 1984, C70 professionally produced cassette, white case/ blue lettering, printed card cover, includes 16-page booklet £30-£40 if complete\n\nFeatures tracks by SPK/ Gorilla Aktiv/ Autentisk Film/Smersh/ Bourbonese Qualk/Test Dept/Audio Leter/Muslimgauze/Tex Mirror H/Attrition. This highly desirable sampler features original recordings from a number of industrial music heavyweights. The cassette includes a computer programme for the ZX Spectrum featuring the Adventures In Reality catalogue.\n\nAdventures In Reality was a UK-based fanzine from Coventry run by Alan Rider which ran from 1980-1984 over 12 issues numbered alphabetically through A to L. Adventures In Reality Recordings was a spin-off from the magazine and released exclusive material from an international cast of bands including Attrition, Stress, Bourbonese Qualk, SPK, Test Department, Religious Overdose, Velvet Monkeys and Audio Leter.\n\n20 DIGITAL DINOSAURS\n\nHuh? Spott Records Puss Five, 1980, 100 copies. Printed hand-drawn sleeves – can be folded so one of three covers shows £20-£30\n\nCoventry was home to Spott, which issued a number of tapes featuring the Digital Dinosaurs. Described as being West Coastsounding with touches of the Bonzos, Kevin Ayers and Syd Barrett, their output ranges from DIY whimsy to classic pop and on to prog and psych wig-outs. Their magnum opus was Huh? – described by the band as a concept album without a concept – recorded over several weeks in the summer of 1980 at Boiling Point studio. Huh? is a memo from the frontline in Thatcher’s newly envisioned Great Britain painting a picture of those oppressive, depressing, hopeless times. Chunks of material – including Huh? – have been re-released on the Messthetics label (207 and 209).\n\n21 NAAFI SANDWICH\n\nNaafi Sandwich RUM1 £20-£30\n\nNaafi Sandwich was an experimental duo from Earlstown, Merseyside formed by Jerry Kenny (aka Sir Freddie Viaduct, vocals, bass, guitar, trumpet) and Brenda Kenny (aka Poly Rhythm, vocals, percussion, drums, keyboards). They started playing and recording in the late 70s, gaining cult status for the weirdness of their music, which included elements taken from afro-rock, dub, psychedelia, noise and avant-garde. Their experimental DIY post-punk art-wave sound featured dark rumbling bass, driving percussion, all kinds of crazy electronics and minimalist guitar stabs. Their first tape features five soundscapes, not dissimilar to the sort of work XTC’s Andy Partridge was conducting for Go 2-era XTC and the Take Away album. They released four tapes in the late 70s/early 80s, as well as singles for Absurd and Relentless."
