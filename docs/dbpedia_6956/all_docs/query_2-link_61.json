The time is right now and the occasion is (checks notes) the release of the latest Metallica album-that-now-exists 72 Seasons! We did our best to get inspired from that record‚Äôs impetus and momentum and, uh, given that it‚Äôs now been out for over a month, we‚Äôll leave it up to you to decide how easy a feat this was! In all sincerity, though, practically all of us jive with ‚Äòtallica to some degree or another and in terms of ballots alone, this might have been the most full-handed collaboration of the lot. Please enjoy probably the least controversial selection of Metallica classics of all time (and righteously so!), freshly critiqued for your consumption.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\n15. Motorbreath\n\n14. And Justice For All\n\n13. Fight Fire With Fire\n\n12. Orion\n\n11.

That is to say in this segment we‚Äôll be cross checking different staffers‚Äô approaches to putting words together. Maybe you‚Äôre a budding reviewer, on the cusp of greatness, searching for that piece of the puzzle lost on the floor or maybe your mum just logged you on to the household‚Äôs singular trusty laptop and you don‚Äôt know what to do with your fifteen minute screen allowance before the older sibling demands the computer for‚Ä¶research? Either way, you‚Äôve come to the right place!\n\nFirst off. Who are you and how did you get here?\n\nI‚Äôm Kompy I got here cuz I got locked out of my Webkinz account and figured this was the next best thing.\n\nBut you are the show-poni of the hour. The creme della creme. How has your reviewing got you to this perceivable reception point? What makes Kompys so chompy?\n\nWeed brownies and poor sleep health\n\nWeed, brownies or weed brownies? Remind me to compare recipe cards later.\n\nOoh, got anything with walnuts?\n\nA couple of salads, nothing of note. Maybe some caramalised beetroot?\n\nYou always know how to make a mouth water, chef!\n\nAnd how does that cream turn to butter? Hard work?

In this multi-participant discussion, the team shall face several serious and humorous questions to give them the opportunity to let them shine and introduce themselves. However, instead of throwing questions towards each other this time around, garas volunteered to be the host of this interview. We hope you‚Äôll enjoy it!\n\n[Part I: 2022] // [Part II: 2023]\n\ngaras: Hello everyone, it‚Äôs garas here! In the latest promotion event several new people were blessed with the opportunity to become members of the Contributor team. So, let‚Äôs start with the most important question you all are probably wondering about:\n\n1a) What is your favourite caffeine source (if there is any), and 1b) also, who the hell are you?\n\nJust to give an example: I love espresso con panna the most. Also, I‚Äôm garas, AKA Gary the Grumpy, the local dungeon synth/black metal enthusiast in the team. Otherwise, just a regular metalhead from Hungary who loves cats and fantasy books and games a lot.\n\nfogza: I‚Äôm currently in love with milk replacements, so my go-to is the coconut milk latte, or as they call it at Pret: the coco latte. I‚Äôm fogza, your regular indie fan and traditional song format enthusiast, originally from South Africa but now residing in the UK.\n\nashcrash9: I‚Äôve never‚Ä¶\n\nWeekly Releases 5.26.2023\n\nBy Sowing Monday May 22, 2023\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of notable new releases for the week of May 26th, 2023.

I know what she sounds like live and I would rather revisit my own memories than hear a recording (unpick the cognitive dissonance here as you see fit). This time was different; this show had pronounced discursive questions floating over it, mainly to do with the popularity spike Aoba has enjoyed since I last saw her, but also her incorporation of chamber arrangements into otherwise spartan solo performances. Given the factors that originally made her so compelling to me, I‚Äôve always treated both of these with a certain amount of suspicion, which translated into very clearly defined expectations and reservations for this show; in puzzling out my own answers to these, I inadvertently ended up with ample material for a decent-sized feature. So, in we go:\n\nThis was my third time seeing Ichiko Aoba, and she now commands a decidedly larger international following than on the first two (both 2019). Those shows were spent cross-legged on pub floors, spellbound by her tiny figure lit by a single lamp in the middle of whichsoever space, keenly aware of the inhalation and drink-sipping rates of what felt like every other person in the space. Her performances were‚Ä¶\n\nWeekly Releases: 05.19.2023\n\nBy staff Monday May 15, 2023\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of notable new releases for the week of May 19th, 2023.

Who are you and how did you get here?\n\nHey, I‚Äôm Alex, AKA robertsona, and I‚Äôve been using Sputnikmusic for about 14 years, with about a decade under my belt as Staff. I think I found Sputnikmusic in trying to supplement Pitchfork with other sources of music news and reviews, and evidently the idea of writing my own reviews and putting them out there for consumption was appealing: from May 2009, when I was 13 years old, to August 2013, when I turned 18, I wrote well over 100 reviews for the site. I currently live with fellow Sputnikmusic user ArsMoriendi in Manhattan, and I teach high school English around New York City.\n\nWait. You‚Äôre not Robert?

Another month has come and gone. Which means, of course, it‚Äôs time for a blog post. Dare I say 2023 is shaping up to be a very memorable year for music? Spring is in the air, the pandemic is finally over, and everyone is leaving their virtual discos in favor of good ol‚Äô fashioned ragers. Who doesn‚Äôt love hearing loud trance music in dark tightly packed spaces? Maybe this year ACL can have a good lineup, who knows. Anyway, May 2023 is off to a weirdly boring start for music. I can think of several reasons why but the most obvious one is that April was just too damn exciting. Now that the Sheeran trial has run its course and musicians are safe again, we can all relax and play the new Zelda game or if you don‚Äôt have a Switch, Hyper Light Drifter is recommended on any platform. By the way, have you heard the new Yun√® Pinku EP? The new Yun√® Pinku EP is Sputnikmusic.com‚Äôs album of the month.\n\nYun√® Pinku‚Äôs BABYLON IX doesn‚Äôt quite have the staying power of new Metallica, nor does it make me cry like the new National, but it kinda rules. Marvelously produced opener ‚ÄúTrinity‚Äù continues to amaze and uplift, even when it is boring and rainy outside or in the world of other music: quite a trick.
