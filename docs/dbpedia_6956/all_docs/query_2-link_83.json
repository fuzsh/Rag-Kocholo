        "text": "author PP date 15/03/07\n\nFlorida hardcore/metalcore hybrid Poison The Well has been through a lot in the last couple of years, including signing to a major label only to find out they wanted to control their music, and having revolving doors on the bassist and second guitarist positions. This is a band that was at the forefront of metalcore according to many publications just when the genre was about to blossom, but since then have somewhat diminished in status due to the four years that it took the band to record their new album \"Versions\" because of a number of difficulties they encountered during this time. The band had elected to come over to the UK a month before the release of the album to promote it and to say hi to old friends, so we grabbed the perfect opportunity to interview them, and Ferret Records sent drummer Chris Hornbrook into a corner with us at backstage Islington Academy, London to have a long chat about pretty much everything regarding the band."
