        "text": "Official press release: Ferret Music and Red Blue Records have announced they will jointly release the upcoming album from Ice Nine Kills for fall 2009. With Alternative Press's stamp of approval (a band you need to know- issue #240), a fanatical online following (consistently landing them in the top 10 on both the Myspace and PureVolume charts), and a newly formed partnership with The Artery Foundation (A Day To Remember, The Devil Wears Prada), Ice Nine Kills is looking to do some serious damage in 2009. In The Past year, the band has embarked on 4 full U.S. Tours as well as opening for such notables as Thursday, Bring Me The Horizon, Bury Your Dead, Drop Dead, Gorgeous and Paramore. They will also be having a run on the Warped Tour this summer. Speaking on the news guitarist/vocalist Spencer Charnas said \"We are very honored to have Ferret behind our band now. Not only do they have a strong track record for success, they have also released records by bands that have had a major influence on our music. Ferret joining forces with Red Blue, a label that we love and whose work ethic is unmatched, is going to be a very strong combination.\" Originally a guitarist of Gone Baby Gone, Michael David Allen David Krilivsky started Red Blue Records on May 31st 2006 as a label to cater towards hard working artists that live and die by their music. Come June, Red Blue Records will have had 18 releases, and 6 active artists including Ice Nine Kills, Death In The Park, Phone Calls From Home, The Venetia Fair, Remember Tomorrow and Sound We Sleep. The label also helped alumni, The Invite sign to Atlantic Records and Gone Baby Gone sign to Inyaface Records (Set Your Goals's Japanese record label). Speaking on the joint venture Krilivsky said \"After Ice Nine Kills excelled with an opening spot on the One Moment Tour, I contacted Carl (Ferret Music) about going to lunch. He took me to discuss strategy which led to Red Blue securing an MRI distribution deal. During that meal Carl said 'Mike, you remind me of ME ten years ago. You're a hard worker and all hustle.' I don't think I'll ever forget those words. Ever since that quote, I knew we'd be working together and something great would happen.\" www.myspace.com/iceninekills\n\nRelated News"
