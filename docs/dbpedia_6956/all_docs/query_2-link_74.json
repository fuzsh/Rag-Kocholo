        "text": "“Archangel was a really fun song to write and came easily and naturally. It’s one of those songs that felt like it wrote itself. It’s a song about the more ominous side of angelic warfare and the interaction between humans and the realm beyond. I hope everyone enjoys the concept and the music!” – LEAH\n\nPre-order LEAH’s sixth album, The Glory and the Fallen now. Dropping February 16th, this much-anticipated, crowdfunded new release will feature a who’s who of renowned musicians with appearances from Mark Jansen (Epica, MaYaN), Timo Somers (Arjen Lucassen, Ex Delain), Sander Zoer (Delain), and was produced by Oliver Philipps (Everon, Phantasma). The amazing artwork was created by Giannis Nakos (Kamelot, Evergrey, Amaranthe.)\n\nPre-orders for ‘THE GLORY AND THE FALLEN’ Collection:\n\nVinyl, CD, 3 Disc Digipak, Hoodies & Bundles\n\nLEAH shares, “This is one of my biggest projects to date. Not only because there were more people involved, but also because of the scope of the music itself and the way I challenged myself in the songwriting process, and vocally. I think you’ll hear a continuation of my evolution as a songwriter and vocalist. This collection of songs is very much the classic LEAH sound but also explores some new territory that I think you’ll really enjoy. ”\n\nIn a gallant move, LEAH will also be treating fans to an instrumental album and folk versions of several songs from the album, providing a full experience for a wide range of musical tastes.\n\nThe Glory and the Fallen\n\nALBUM CREDITS:\n\nAll songs written by Leah McHenry\n\nMixed & mastered by Tom Müller | Flatliners Studio\n\nProduced by Oliver Philipps\n\nVocal Arrangements by Leah McHenry & Oliver Philipps\n\nArtwork & layout by Giannis Nakos\n\nLINE UP:\n\nLead vocals & keys: Leah McHenry\n\nGuitars & Bass: Timo Somers\n\nDrums: Sander Zoer\n\nOrchestrations, programming, additional keyboard & guitars: Oliver Philipps\n\nGUEST APPEARANCES:\n\nHarsh vocals on ‘Sleeping Giant’ & ‘Unshakable’: Mark Jansen\n\nFlutes & pipes on ‘Victory’ & ‘Dream Voyage’: Dagda (Celtibeerian)\n\nVocals on ‘Unshakable’: Elektra, Victory, Geneva (Leah’s daughters)\n\nVocals on ‘Victory’: Oliver Philipps & Timo Somers\n\nVocals on ‘Revive’: Syr\n\nAbout LEAH:\n\nThroughout her trajectory, LEAH’s music has featured such notables as Troy Donockley (Nightwish), Eric Peterson (Testament), Barend Courbois (Blind Guardian), Chen Balbus (Orphaned Land), and Jacob Hansen (Volbeat, Amaranthe, Evergrey).
