        "text": "GNU Software\n\nGNU is an operating system which is 100% free software. It was launched in 1983 by Richard Stallman (rms) and has been developed by many people working together for the sake of freedom of all software users to control their computing. Technically, GNU is generally like Unix. But unlike Unix, GNU gives its users freedom.\n\nThe GNU system contains all of the official GNU software packages (which are listed below), and also includes non-GNU free software, notably TeX and the X Window System. Also, the GNU system is not a single static set of programs; users and distributors may select different packages according to their needs and desires. The result is still a variant of the GNU system.\n\nIf you're looking for a whole system to install, see our list of GNU/Linux distributions which are entirely free software.\n\nTo look for individual free software packages, both GNU and non-GNU, please see the Free Software Directory: a categorized, searchable database of free software. The Directory is actively maintained by the Free Software Foundation and includes links to program home pages where available, as well as entries for all GNU packages. Another list of all GNU packages is below. Free software documentation links are listed separately.\n\nFinally, we have a short list of free software replacements for proprietary software running on various proprietary systems.\n\nWe have also published a list of recommended educational software.\n\nHow to get GNU software\n\nGNU software is available by several different methods:\n\nDownload a wholly free GNU/Linux distribution.\n\nGet a copy from a friend.\n\nBuy a computer with a wholly free GNU/Linux system preinstalled from one of the companies that offers this.\n\nDownload individual packages from the web or via FTP: we provide source code for all GNU software as free software, and free of charge. (Please also make a donation to the FSF if you can, to help support the development of more free software.)\n\nUse the GNU Guix functional package manager to install and manage GNU package releases.\n\nUse the GNU GSRC collection to easily install the latest GNU package releases on their own, without conflicting with any system versions.\n\nUse the GNU PPA (Personal Package Archive) on Trisquel or related distros to get the latest releases suitably packaged.\n\nGet the development sources for a package and build them. Many GNU packages keep their development sources at the GNU hosting site savannah.gnu.org. Some packages use other source repositories, or have none at all. Each package's web pages should give the specifics.\n\nDevelop GNU software\n\nThe FSF maintains a list of high-priority free software projects; please help with these projects if you can. For other ways to contribute to GNU, including reviving unmaintained GNU packages and helping with development, see the GNU help wanted page.\n\nIf you're writing a new program and would like to make your software an official GNU package, see the evaluation information and submission form. Refer to the ethical repository criteria for guidance choosing a hosting service for your project.\n\nIf you're maintaining or developing a GNU package, whether newly dubbed or of long standing, this short list of tips for GNU maintainers may be useful, along with this information about GNU software developer resources.\n\nAll GNU packages\n\nLinks to the home pages of all current GNU packages are given below, using their identifiers (rather than long names) for brevity. They are sorted alphabetically from left to right. If you have corrections to this list or questions about it, please email <maintainers@gnu.org>.\n\nAlso available are lists of:\n\nshort descriptions for all GNU packages;\n\ndocumentation for GNU packages (arranged by category);\n\nGNU package logos; and\n\nrecent GNU releases.\n\nDecommissioned GNU packages"
