The label is owned in part by NORA's vocalist, Carl Severson, and in part by Philadelphian artist manager Paul Conroy, and based in West Windsor Township, New Jersey. Ferret recently started an imprint called New Weathermen Records. Warner Music Group's Alternative Distribution Alliance acquired a stake in Ferret Music in August, 2006, and as a result is currently distributed by Fontana Distribution, Alternative Distribution Alliance and eOne Music.\n\nContents\n\nMadball heavenhell ferret music\n\nPast artists\n\nSOAR artists\n\nPast SOAR Artists\n\nReferences\n\nAs of September 12, 2007, Ferret partnered with an uprising extreme metal and hardcore punk label out of the UK, Siege of Amida Records (S.O.A.R.). S.O.A.R will retain A&R responsibilities. In February 18, 2010 Carl Severson and his business partner at Ferret and ChannelZERO, Paul Conroy, announced their departure from the company to start Good Fight Entertainment, a management company with music and sports divisions along with a new record label. As of December 2015, Ferret's official website has not been updated in over six years, adding to speculation that the label is defunct. According to Scott Mellinger, lead guitarist for Zao, Ferret Records sold out, while Severson went on to start Good Fight.\n\nMadball heavenhell ferret music\n\nPast artists\n\n36 Crazyfists (active, on Spinefarm Records)\n\nA Life Once Lost (disbanded)\n\nA Static Lullaby (active, unsigned)\n\nAll Chrome (status unknown)\n\nAnnotations of an Autopsy (disbanded)\n\nBlood Has Been Shed (disbanded)\n\nBoris The Blade (active, on Century Media)\n\nBoys Night Out (active, with Good Fight Music)\n\nBurnt by the Sun (disbanded)\n\nblessthefall (active, on Fearless Records)\n\nCataract (active, on Metal Blade Records)\n\nChimaira (disbanded)\n\nDead Hearts (disbanded)\n\nDisembodied (active, on Good Fight Music)\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada (active, on Rise Records)\n\nElysia (disbanded)\n\nEternal Lord (disbanded)\n\nEvery Time I Die (active, with Epitaph Records)\n\nFor the Love of...
