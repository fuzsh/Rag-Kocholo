        "text": "\"I should clarify some of the words. It's 'deaf before dumb,' meaning express yourself at all costs.\"\n\n- Liz Phair on her song \"Canary\"\n\nLiz Phair's been collecting inflammatory labels for the entirety of her career. She's a beautiful woman who makes no apologies for her words, her music, her image, her sexuality, her gender, and how they intersect. Always challenging expectations and \"the flow,\" Liz has never shied away from controversy, but for all the arguing critics have engaged in over her, too little is made of what I see as her most important facet: she's good. With music, with art, with spunky attitude and wise words, Liz has been a huge inspiration to me for many years. Listening to her always makes me feel more grounded in myself; she helps me process the world. If you're willing to open your mind a bit and let her tell you a bit about herself and how she sees the world, you might find out a thing or two about yourself as well.\n\nThis is pretty text heavy, but most of the words are Liz quotes that I felt were fitting or exemplary of some especially Liz-like quality. They're easily ignored if you're just here for the mp3s and get intimidated by big blocks of text.\n\n\"The songs were the venue for things I never felt like I had a chance to say. If I was obsessed with somebody beyond me or that I didn't know, I'd write to them. It was like my secret fetishism. I'm not one to go running to my friends and tell them what happened that day. I wanted to run to the guitar and say it.\"\n\nElizabeth Clark Phair, Aries extraordinaire, is the adopted daughter of a doctor and an art educator. From an early age she had piano and guitar lessons, and started writing songs when she was still a child. She grew up in an affluent Chicago suburb and attended one of the best high schools in the nation, with all the pointless teenage rebellion that such an upbringing can't help but inspire (think Ferris Bueller's Day Off, only with more pot). Afterwards, she attended the hotbed of politically correct sensitivity and righteousness that was Oberlin College, where she studied art history and visual arts, and developed a love/hate relationship with her political environment: while the awareness of gender dynamics were a huge influence on her, she also became frustrated with the ultra-PC, polite sentiments that reigned there. The fall after she graduated, Liz moved to San Francisco, where she indulged in a bohemian lifestyle that consisted largely of smoking, drinking, socializing and arguing about philosophy with her friends, preferably in cafes, and supported herself by doing charcoal drawings. It was during this time that she wrote many of the songs that would later appear on the Girly Sound tapes, which she recorded a few years later after her money ran out and she moved back to Chicago.\n\n\"I decided to make a name for myself and become a fine artist. I had a modern art book assigned to me by a female professor. I started counting and there were, I think, 15 female artists before 1960. That was pretty frightening, but I figured that after 1960 there were sure to be more. And there were 15 females artists after 1960. So in a book of 1,200 pages, there were 30 female artists. I just freaked out, I walked around for days telling everyone I could, and they'd say, 'That's nice, Liz.' It was really frightening to me. That's what I wanted immortality for -- to get my name in the history books and to make sure I could pursue my interests.\"\n\nGIRLY SOUND.\n\n\"Those tapes were all intentionally about the art form of using a little girlish voice to say really dirty things and play with pedophilia. That's my way of fisting all the people that I believe exploit a woman's sexuality. But for the people who initially became aroused, if they listened to what I was actually saying, it was a smack in the face. It would be like Dorothy singing, 'And I fucked you!' So at the same time of titillating them, it's to bring them close enough so I can smack 'em.\"\n\nRecorded with a 4-track in her parents' house in 1991, the Girly Sound tapes were made on a dare with no particular goal in mind. Liz made two sets of two tapes (there may have been a third, but its contents are not entirely knonw) and sent them to her friends Chris Brokaw and Tae Won Yu. Within a few months, copies of the tapes had circulated throughout the New York and Chicago indie scenes. The recording quality was fairly terrible, but it suited the songs, which featured only guitar and Liz's untrained, blunt-sounding voice. Sex was a frequent topic; swearing was omnipresent, and a sad, quirky honesty permeated the songs that, when they weren't purposely provocative, tended to sound rather confessional, perhaps expressing Liz's disappointment in herself post-college. In any case, her lyrics were uniformly clever and frequently subverted those of \"real songs\" by such artists as Johnny Cash and the Jesus and Mary Chain.\n\nHere I include songs that didn't eventually make it onto her other albums, as most of them did in some form or another.\n\nWhite Babies (a.k.a. Black Market White Baby Dealer)\n\nFuck or Die\n\nSlave (a.k.a. Sometimes A Dream (Is What Makes You A Slave))\n\nCan't Get Out of What I'm Into (Cause It's A Steady Job)\n\nOne Less Thing\n\n\"I think if my music hadn't taken off, and I wasn't recording, and I was just fritzing around in San Francisco, which was certainly a possibility...I would be far more interested in seeing myself reflected through the eyes of the media as a generation. Because that would be my identity. I would look to something outside of myself to try and tell me who I was and what I was doing. Whereas if you are busy and involved with something that you are generating from yourself, you start to define yourself as an individual -- more, probably, than you are accepting definitions of yourself as part of a group. And that's just a perspective shift.\"\n\nEXILE IN GUYVILLE.\n\n\"My whole life I've been listening to the radio -- rock and classic rock -- and there's a phenomenon that feminists discuss: you put yourself in the context of the male gender to be able to identify with what they're singing about. You give up your gender and go into the 'guy mind' because it's the only way you can appropriate the song for yourself. Or you become the object of that song.\"\n\nAfter Girly Sound gained the love of zines throughout the underground, Liz gained a producer and a record label, in that order. The producer was Brad Wood and the label was the indie Matador. Having been given $10,000 to make an album, she framed it as the female response, song-by-song, to the Rolling Stones album Exile on Main Street (Liz is a woman trying to make her voice heard in the male-dominated rock scene that is Guyville). This bit of lore tends to be a bit overblown, since many of the songs that appeared on Guyville existed before the album did, but the intention is pretty much the same. Heavy on guitar, sexuality, and cynicism, the album is raw and made more so by Liz's apparent disinterest in making her voice sound pretty. What is lacking in softness is made up for in bare emotional truths and beguiling moments of surreal philosophy. Widespread acclaim among indie rock's elite — the same ones Liz was targeting for having upheld the \"Guyville,\" indier-than-thou status quo — followed.\n\nDance of the Seven Veils\n\nFlower (probably her dirtiest song, which is saying something)\n\nDivorce Song\n\nStratford-On-Guy\n\n\"I've always been a character writer. And a lot of this stuff that people took as the blurting of someone who didn't know better was totally conscious...there are songs that people take as absolute fact that bear no reality, bear no connection to... you know, I lost my virginity at 19, well 18, but almost 19. People just think that I say stuff and I can't create and I felt very underappreciated, which I shouldn't obviously, I got a lot of acclaim, but I felt like no one got that I could completely create, that I was a fiction writer. That was why it was so hard for my family, because everyone took it as basically a chronicling of my youth, like someone who doesn't know better, like an idiot savant. But I was always trained in the arts. I knew a lot about how to create something.\"\n\nWHIP-SMART.\n\n\"It doesn't have that sort of frustrated, tense -- a detractor might say whining -- quality to it. It's more confident-sounding, maybe, a little more playful. And it isn't quite as much man-woman, man-woman, man-woman. There's lots of love songs and a lot of didn't-go-right songs, but there's a lot of other kinds of songs, too. And yes, there's some smut. Exile in Guyville was a more sexual album. This is the opposite, an emotionally based album that ended up being more sexual. I made a rock fairy tale. A little myth journey.\"\n\nHere is a rather pointless, yet adorable interview of Liz, done by her fellow newcomer to fame, Beck. He has no questions for her and she has opinions. Totally priceless.\n\nAfter the critical success of Guyville, Matador landed a distribution deal with Atlantic records, making Liz's second album Whip-Smart (1994) her mainstream debut. Brad, Liz, and engineer Casey Rice have created a much more mellow piece. Instrumentation is fleshed-out and relaxed, while still very much belonging to 1994's rock scene. It's accessible and a bit whimsical, with fewer recycled songs. The result is fresh and summery, with several moments of stunning lyricism and insight, and, of course, it wasn't nearly successful as Guyville. Liz didn't help matters by cancelling her tour, losing contact with Brad, and getting married instead.\n\nShane\n\nSupport System\n\nMay Queen\n\n\"It (being adopted) motivates my songwriting. It gives me that free space -- I've got this mental idea that I'm not really, deep-down, fully attached to anything, like that floatable world that artists create for themselves. I'm a member of that world, intrinsically. I don't have a biological mother to refute. Bad behavior in a child, you can frame it up against your parents -- you know, 'You're just like your father.' Since I don't have that model, it frees me up to pursue what I want to perceive as myself.\"\n\nWHITECHOCOLATESPACEEGG.\n\n\"The thing with my lyrics has always been that I'm hyperbolic in them. I am dramatic in them. I take small experiences, and I fictionalize the circumstances. In a three-minute song, I'm kind of ruthless. I'll use whatever words I can to give you the point. A lot of people then get ruffled by it...but that's all right. I want you to feel something -- the emotions that are at the center of all our lives.\"\n\n1998's whitechocolatespaceegg was named after an album Liz had in a dream while she was pregnant with her son Nick, which is fitting, because in terms of maturity, this is light-years away from her other work. Originally it was supposed to have been produced by R.E.M.'s producer Scott Litt, but as recording dragged on without satisfying results, Brad Wood was called back to help. The result is a mix of old-school Liz flavour and new, big-label gloss, befitting Matador's sale of Liz's contract to Capitol Records. Though the low-fidelity sound and confessional-ish lyrics are gone, in some ways this feels like Liz's most sincere album; it's not biting and in-your-face, but is mostly devoted to the tiny details of domestic life. It's also the first time that Liz's voice sounds really confident. She's learned how to sing and discovers that she likes it. We like it too, Liz. :]\n\nPerfect World\n\nRide\n\nLove Is Nothing\n\nShitloads of Money\n\n\"You have to be a fan of Liz Phair to make a great Liz Phair record. She's a phenomenal guitar player and a good singer. If you take the guitar out of her hand and start messing with that you get the new Coke and then everyone screams for Classic.\" - Brad Wood\n\nLIZ PHAIR.\n\n\"I tried to make my album appealing to more people than just indie...because I want to be consequential. I want to be in this environment that the record business is in right now. I want to be an active member and I want people to have to sit up and take notice. I don't want to be tossed aside again as some phenomenon of the early '90s. I want to be a lifelong artist. It just so happens right now that to do that, in my circumstances, I had to kick up a little shit storm. I just had to, otherwise I would have just... I don't know where I would have landed. I personally can't live with that. I'm trying to kick down another door.\"\n\nHere's a hilarious interview in which Liz firmly tells off a critic who seems to want her to admit that she's become a soulless media whore.\n\nAfter several years, a divorce, and a single (Down) that was never properly released, Liz shocked the indie scene who had never noticed that she disdained them by appearing in 2003 with an eponymous album that featured multiple tracks produced by The Matrix, recently known for producing Avril Lavigne. The facts that Liz's music still didn't sound anything like Avril Lavigne or that she was topless on the cover of her debut album a decade earlier were neatly ignored by a media eager to label her a sell-out for hiring pop producers and sitting naked with a guitar. Apparently it was also easy to miss the statements Liz had made throughout her career (and in her lyrics as well) about making her explicitly female voice heard, and her overwhelming mission statement to own her sexuality without shame or recrimination. But I digress. Liz's new sound was, in fact, not terribly new; most of the album is pretty similar to whitechocolatespaceegg, with a little extra sheen. The album is accessible and dynamic, and Liz's enjoyment in singing is audible. Lyrically, she's dealing with the realities of being 36, single, and a mother; the shiny production doesn't in way detract from the poignancy of the song she writes to her son or the mischievous revelling she takes in relationships with younger men, as well as those songs in which she directly deals with her contractors. I'll freely admit that it's my least favourite of her albums; I'm still waiting in disbelief for the possibility of a lousy Liz Phair album.\n\nRed Light Fever\n\nLittle Digger\n\nFirewalker\n\n\"This is the call to young girls who have the ability to compete. Get out there and slug it out. There's not enough female voices in popular culture. It's a fucking crime.\"\n\nI'll probably be putting up some more tracks, from various demos and others that just didn't make the cut into this post, in my journal. Lots more here!\n\nCredit to Mesmerizing and Nashville for being awesome and quoteful."
