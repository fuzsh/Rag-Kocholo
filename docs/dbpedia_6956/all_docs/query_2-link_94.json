The band comes across as being influenced by Saxon and Thin Lizzy, albeit with a Teutonic singer. Roland Seidel's accent is conspicuous in the mix. Every song contains a reference to a well-known band! Fire And Dice has a lyrical reference to Motorhead, Stairway To The Galaxy features a Saxon reference while Guardian Angel nods to Iron Maiden. A couple of the songs' lyrics are also in the white metal direction. While My Black Colors could have been a tad faster, the band has used the song to cut a radio edit of and tagged it to the disc's end. Finally a special mention goes to the good guitar work on Guardian Angel. Fans of the genre will find that Kaminari is a proficient act. bernd.a.wick@t-online.de or www.kaminari-music.de - Ali \"The Metallian\"\n\nSYMBIONTIC - BIOCONSTRUCT\n\nBioconstruct, the second demo of this two-year old band, is half an hour of true-to-form death metal. Beginning and ending with a distorted voice overlain with static, the CD is rife with gruff vocals, a mid-pace bias, and an overall structure which is reminiscent of Cerebral Fix, Cancer, Benediction and Pestilence (all English bands save the last) circa Testimony Of The Ancients - the latter in the execution of the rhythm guitar and the guitars' inter-play in general.\n\nInteresting titles like Shotgun Surgery are brutal and unrelenting. These intermingle with more introvert instrumentals reminiscent of Testament's The New Order album - this pattern is oft repeated. The instrumentals have infectious guitar touches. Bioconstruct can get technical, especially in the guitar department, yet this evidently alternates with more sombre moments. The CD also features a strong drum performance which needs to be recognized. This band can play and it shows. Yes, this is shaping to be a strong demo overall and one that is all the more interesting because it refuses to yield to the corrupting influences pushed our way by other styles. It's worth the $20 Cdn. asked for so contact the band either via marcel@symbiontic.de or Wattenscheider Hellweg 205, 44867 Bochum Germany - Ali \"The Metallian\"\n\nMYSTERY BLUE - BRAND NEW DEMO\n\nMystery Blue is yet another 80's metal band reformed (albeit with only one original member in this case) and back on the scene. It is a very sad day for heavy metal when a twenty-year old band is more powerful, more exciting and yes more metal, than the whole distaff of modern acts prancing around nowadays. In fact, after being exposed to the current crop of female-fronted so-called metal bands, Mystery Blue is a god-send.\n\nThe new demo MCD features three songs of which Dark Visions, with its sombre start, is representative. Singer Nathalie has quite a wild voice lashing it at will. At other times her high pitch is almost out of control. Frenzy lives up to his name on the guitar. The rhythm section is both solid and reliable. Roller Coaster Ride is appropriately more up-beat and the CD comes to an end with Angel which is a cool hard rock tune. Fans of Judas Priest, Saxon, etc. should check Mystery Blue out. The band is not a clone however and coupled with the very good sound makes for a recommendable CD. Send $10 Cdn.. to 158, rue Hubel, 67590 Ohlungen France or browse www.mysteryblue.com for more details - Ali \"The Metallian\"\n\nSHRINE OF SCARS - DEATHBED FOR A WEAKENING SPIRIT\n\nShrine Of Scars, formerly Thirsty for Blood, is a California-based thrash metal band. The new moniker is certainly more congruous with the group's chosen musical style given how the music is void of black or death metal characteristics. While the vocals of singer/drummer Dave Leyva are raspy and reminiscent of one Mille of Kreator, the band's songs are a cross between older Sacrifice and Destruction. Songs such as Demon White, Sniper and Cutthroat Necklace maintain different tempos and moods, yet are usually linear. Still, it is the faster moments which deserve a stronger mention. Should Shrine Of Scars get some hair, an image and stick with its pure metal attitude, one can see a thrash metal contender emerging onto the scene. For more information please either write to shrineofscars@hotmail.com or visit www.shrineofscars.com. Look for a new demo called Violence Is The Answer coming soon - Ali \"The Metallian\"\n\nDIVINE NOISE ATTACK - SOULLESS SOMETHING\n\nThe oddly-named north German grindcore outfit (hello Extreme Noise Terror) was formed in 1994 as Cornucopia. Soulless Something is its first demo using the new name. The demo features fourteen tracks of grinding insanity with a dual-vocal approach - termed respectively Brutal Voice Artizt and Martyr Screams - and a razor sharp guitar sound. The band is generally inspired by Napalm Death and has a very thick sound. The proceedings can get Agathocles-fast, but the music is mainly mid-paced. The opening song Soulless Something has a groove reminiscent of a rap song, but the effect is not later repeated. The band neglected to send in any pricing information, but you can write to them at divine-noise-attack@web.de and ask. For a picture of the cover or for more information www.divine-noise-attack.info is the way to go - Ali \"The Metallian\"\n\nALL TOO HUMAN - ENTROPY\n\nIf I were to play this 60 min. long CD and describe it as the new Queensryche or Dream Theater album most listeners would agree that those bands have improved over their previous outings. Now imagine the shock when I explain All Too Human is a new band based in Texas and does not currently have a recording deal. To keep up that kind of a quality throughout the 60 minutes is a feat. The musicianship is virtuoso-quality, the production excellent and the music is a heavier version of progressive metal with guest keyboards by former Dream Theater keyboard player Derek Sherinian himself. The demo has complex moments, slower moments, technical songs and even a more direct heavy metal song called Undone. The only thing not to like is the cover which looks like a first encounter scene from the original Star Trek. Entropy is going to get All Too Human signed. Mail@alltoohuman.com - Sheila Wes Det\n\nSICKNOTE - same\n\nSicknote is a slamming, groovy and proud three-year-old band from the northern city of Oulu in Finland. What is very cool about the band is their pride in metal and the loud proclamation of the fact. In other words, readers looking for the next Amorphis will be disappointed. Instead the five metal freaks, including Aki the drummer of Maple Cross, sound like the bastard child of Entombed and Anthrax. The singer can sound similar to the 'alternative' singers of the world. On occasion he reminds me of the singer from Our Lady Peace. But this is not to say the band is weak or poppy. Sicknote is currently looking for a label to release its recorded debut album. Until then go to www.sicknote.cjb.net or send an email to the guitarist at pkolivuori@hotmail.com - Sheila Wes Det\n\nDAYNIGHT - MOMENT OF YOUR TIME\n\nIf the title of the debut demo of this Swedish quartet seems apologetic, it is because given the limited resources available to the band the demo-CD is quite a low-budget affair. The band admits the fact and is sending this out for free in hopes of spreading its name. The sound quality is weak and the songs in need of general tightening, but Daynight has potential. The band is clearly inspired by a mixture of Rhapsody/Freedom Call and psychedelic and folk rock. The lengthy songs are sad and moody. The keyboard (never a good idea) is used liberally and second in the mix only to the vocals. The singer, while still somewhat hit or miss, can go far given his powerful range. He is an asset to each of the four songs featured. It would be interesting to see how Daynight progresses. Write to andreas.lantz@swipnet.se or visit www.metalprovider.com/daynight - Ali \"The Metallian\""
