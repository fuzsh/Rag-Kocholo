        "text": "C. Training\n\nFerrets were trained on a 2AFC discrimination task, using drinking water as a positive reinforcer. To assist learning, animals were trained in several stages of 2AFC tasks, and each ferret was advanced to the next stage when they reached a criterion of at least 85% correct on three consecutive sessions. Each of the five training stages and the final testing stage are described in detail below. Ferrets ran two training sessions daily within each 5-day training “run”, and typically completed between 60-150 trials per session.\n\nDuring a pre-training stage, ferrets learned to lick the spouts in the testing chamber for a water reward. The animal was required to maintain contact with a spout for about one second before receiving a water reward from the spout. During pre-training, ferrets were required to alternate between the central and peripheral spouts in order to receive a water reward, but no sound stimuli were presented at this time. The amount of water used to reward a single response varied across animals, but for all animals the water reward presented from the peripheral response spouts (0.3 - 0.5 ml per trial) was larger than the water reward presented at the central start spout (0.1 - 0.2 ml per trial).\n\n1. Training stage 1\n\nIn the first training stage, the ferrets performed a pure tone frequency discrimination task, but with a localization cue to assist. At the start of each trial, a “reference signal” consisting of a continuously repeated pure tone (5 kHz, 100 ms duration, 150 ms inter-tone interval, 0.5 ms cosine ramped rise/fall) was presented from the central speaker until the ferret activated the central spout to start the trial ( ). This activated a small water reinforcer at the central spout and was followed by a second “target” pulse of pure tones (300 ms duration, 150 ms inter-tone interval, 0.5 ms cosine ramped rise/fall) that differed in frequency from the initial reference tones. The target pulse continued to play until the ferret activated one of the peripheral spouts. If the target frequency was higher than the reference, the animal was required to move to the right response spout to receive a water reward. For frequencies lower than the reference the animal was required to move to the left. Responses at the central spout were ignored, and responses at the incorrect side spout resulted in a 500-ms broadband noise at the central speaker that indicated the onset of a 10-12 s timeout. In all training and testing conditions the central spout remained unresponsive for 2 s following a correct response to provide the animal with a quiet period between trials in which it could drink the water reward.\n\nTo make this task easy we provided an additional spatial cue during the initial training phases: the target tones were presented only from the loudspeaker above the correct water spout for a given trial. Thus, if the target was higher in frequency than the reference, then the target sounds were presented from the right peripheral speaker and right spout responses were rewarded with water.\n\nIf an animal responded incorrectly on a given trial, the same stimuli were presented on the next trial. Such “correction trials” continued until the animal responded correctly. For all training stages, the F0 of the reference sound was fixed during a session, and the target sound varied between two F0s across trials – one that was at least an octave higher than the reference and another that was at least an octave lower than the reference.\n\n2. Training stage 2\n\nOnce animals learned to perform the above task, the localization cue was removed so that the ferret was left only with frequency as an acoustic cue to the correct response. For this and all further tasks, all stimuli were presented from the middle speaker above the start spout only.\n\n3. Training stage 3\n\nOnce criterion had been reached on the pure tone frequency discrimination task, the tones were replaced with click trains, where the click rate (and hence the F0) of the reference (300-500 Hz) differed from the target sounds by at least an octave. Human listeners perceive this stimulus as a rich buzzing sound with a pitch corresponding to the click rate. Thus, the reference and target sounds were both broadband, but differed in F0.\n\n4. Training stage 4\n\nIn stage 4 of training, the previous pitch discrimination task was modified so that the sounds to be discriminated were presented only once per trial, rather than being repeated until the animal made its response ( ). Before each trial, a series of tone pips (5 kHz tone, 20 ms duration, 0.5 ms rise/fall time, 200 ms inter-tone interval) was presented as a “ready signal” to let the ferret know that the central spout could be triggered to start the trial. When the ferret triggered the central spout, a small water reward was administered from the spout on 10% of trials, chosen at random. On the remaining 90% of the trials, rewards were only given from the peripheral spouts for correct responses to the test sounds. The test sounds consisted of two consecutive click trains presented from the central speaker: a 200-ms-long reference click train (5 ms rise/fall time, with a click rate of approximately 400 Hz) followed by a 50-ms-long inter-stimulus interval of silence, and then a 500-ms-long target click train (5 ms rise/fall time, with click rates at least one octave away from that of the reference). As before, in order to receive a reward the ferret was required to activate the right peripheral spout if the target was higher in F0 than the reference sound, and to activate the left peripheral spout if the target pitch was lower in F0 than the reference. Incorrect responses were again negatively reinforced with a noise and timeout of 10-12 s, and were followed by correction trials. If an animal failed to make a response within 15 s of the onset of the target stimulus, the trial was reset without time-out or water reinforcement, forcing the animal to restart the trial.\n\n5. Training stage 5\n\nIn this stage, click train stimuli were replaced with artificial vowel sounds that were created using custom software, based on an algorithm adapted from Malcom Slaney's Auditory Toolbox (http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~malcolm/interval/1998-010/). The vowel sounds were composed of click trains that were band-pass filtered to add “formants” centered at 430, 2132, 3070 and 4100 Hz ( ), and then given an envelope with 5 ms rise and fall times. These formants correspond to the first four formants of the English vowel /i/ (as in “pill”). The overall spectral distribution of the vowel was largely determined by the position of the formants and was thus similar across all F0s tested. The click rates of the target and reference sounds in this task were similar to those used in stage 4. The switch from unfiltered click trains to artificial vowels did not cause any transient drop in the animals' performance, indicating that the animals were able to generalize the pitch task very rapidly across the two types of complex sounds. Across trials, the sound levels of the reference and target vowels were varied independently. Each was set to one of 10 possible values, spanning a range of approximately 15 dB, and chosen at random with a uniform distribution. Sound levels were calibrated using a B&K sound level meter and free-field, ½ inch microphone type 4191 (Brüel & Kjær, Norcross, USA). The average sound level of the artificial vowel was approximately 80 dB SPL (± 3 dB across different F0s). The ± 7.5 dB random variation in sound level was introduced to ensure that ferrets were not inadvertently provided with relative level difference cues within particular spectral bands across the reference and target sounds. Once animals had reached criterion on a given session of this task, the two target F0s used were occasionally jittered (± 150 Hz) across additional sessions. By randomizing levels and target pitches we encouraged the animals to follow pitch cues, rather than mapping other acoustical features of the training targets onto the left and right spouts.\n\nA. Ferrets' discrimination of the pitch of artificial vowels\n\nAll four ferrets reached criterion on the five training stages after 1-2 weeks of training per stage. shows the psychometric functions obtained from all four ferrets for each reference F0 tested. The pitch acuity of ferrets is indicated by the steepness of the psychometric curves, and can also be expressed as the minimum F0 difference required for the animal to reach our criterion of 69.15% (i.e. the difference limen for pitch). illustrates how ferrets' difference limens for the pitch of the artificial vowel depend on the F0 of the reference. Pearson correlations showed that these difference limens increased significantly with the F0 of the reference vowel (r = 0.86, p < 0.001). Weber fractions were derived by normalizing each difference limen by the corresponding reference F0 ( ). These normalized measures of pitch acuity showed no linear change across the range of reference F0s tested (r = −0.01, p = 0.951). Nevertheless, Weber fractions did differ significantly across reference F0s (1-way ANOVA; F(12,25) = 3.98, p = 0.002). Post hoc tests indicated that the Weber fraction measured using a reference of 200 Hz was significantly higher than the Weber fractions for references of 300 – 417 Hz and 700 Hz (Tukey's HSD test; p < 0.05).\n\nIn , some of the fitted psychometric curves do not pass through the reference F0 at the 50% choice probability point. These small shifts of the psychometric curve are partly attributable to statistical errors in the fit of the psychometric function, but might also indicate a response bias, i.e. when uncertain about the correct response, the ferret did not make “higher” (right) or “lower” (left) responses with exactly equal probability, but exhibited a small preference for either higher or lower responses. We quantified this bias in each psychometric curve as the distance, in Hz, between the 50% right choice probability point of the psychometric function and the reference F0. In this calculation, “higher” response biases are represented as negative values and “lower” biases as positive. In , the biases are plotted as a percentage of the reference F0, and these values are compared across ferrets and across references. Some animals were more likely to show response biases than others, and most of the significant biases on this task (see caption) were towards the right spout (i.e. higher pitch).\n\nTo ensure that the ferrets were making pitch judgments, the intensities of the reference and target sounds were independently and randomly varied across trials. To confirm that the sound level of the target sounds did not affect discrimination performance, psychometric functions were fitted independently for target sounds at each intensity level for each reference F0. A 2-way ANOVA was then carried out on the slopes of the fitted psychometric functions (expressed as percent choice probability per octave), using ferret identity and target intensity as predictor variables. We found no significant effect of target sound intensity (F(19,436) = 1.09, p = 0.359), nor did the intensity significantly interact with the performance of individual ferrets (F(57,436) = 1.15, p = 0.221). Furthermore, responses on individual trials were not predicted by the intensity differences between the reference and target vowel (2-way ANOVA; F(28,569) = 1.25, p = 0.174) nor by the interaction between this intensity difference and ferret identity (F(84,569) = 1.23, p = 0.090). Therefore, across the 15 dB range tested, ferrets' performance on the pitch discrimination task did not depend on sound intensity.\n\nFerrets could adopt at least three strategies to solve our pitch discrimination task. They could compare the relative pitches of the target and reference presented on each trial, as human listeners report doing. They could also build up an internal “memory” of the reference during training at the beginning of the week and judge each target as high or low relative to this internalized reference. While this internal reference would be reinforced by the presentation of that same reference on each trial throughout the testing run, performance may persist without it. Finally, the ferrets may not compare the targets to a single reference at all, but instead compare a given target to internalized “low” and “high” target templates, for instance, the high and low pitches presented during training at the beginning of a weekly run. We attempted to assess whether animals were relying on the references presented at each trial by carrying out a week of “variable reference” testing sessions in which the reference pitch could take one of two values, approximately two octaves apart. Three targets were presented: one about an octave below the low reference, one about an octave above the high reference, and one centered between the low and high reference. If ferrets compared the pitch of the target to the reference pitch on each trial, they should perform this task well, responding “high” when the middle target was presented with the low reference and “low” when the middle target was presented with the higher target. If they matched targets to low and high templates, they might be expected to respond similarly to the middle target irrespective of the reference F0. If they rely on a stable memorized representation of the reference, they would be forced to adopt a new strategy in this paradigm because a stable reference is not presented, and so their performance on the variable reference task is less straightforward to predict.\n\nAfter four days of testing with two references, ferrets discriminated the highest and lowest targets well, but responded to the middle target at chance ( ). Responses to the middle target did not differ across the two references (Tukeys HSD test). This indicates that these animals were not accustomed to comparing the pitch of the target to that of the reference presented on each trial, but they instead used a strategy that utilized internal representations.\n\nA. Pitch direction judgments in animals\n\nThe few previous studies that have examined animals' ability to judge the direction of pitch changes have all used simple tones as stimuli. These studies have often been motivated by the question of whether animals can identify the direction of frequency changes by comparing the “relative” frequencies of several tones presented on a given trial, or if they instead compare the “absolute” frequency of each tone to an internal frequency representation (i.e., they possess and use “perfect pitch”). For instance, Cynx and colleagues carried out psychophysical tasks in birds that required the animals to respond to increases or decreases in frequency across a sequence of tones (Page et al., 1989; Cynx, 1995). While they showed that it is possible to train birds to make relative frequency judgments under carefully designed experimental conditions, these relative judgments do not appear to come easily. Their results suggest that both songbirds and non-songbirds prefer to label the absolute frequency of a sound to solve frequency discrimination tasks. Other groups have also experienced difficulty in training rats (D'Amato, 1988) and non-human primates (D'Amato, 1988; Izumi, 2001; Brosch et al., 2004) to respond to the direction of relative frequency changes within a tone sequence.\n\nThe design of our task encouraged subjects to respond to the relative change in F0 between the reference and target sound, and human listeners carrying out this task report basing their decisions on relative pitch judgments. However, since the reference sound remained constant throughout a given session, the ferrets could use other strategies to perform our task. For instance, they may have formed a internal, memorized representation of the reference during the first few trials in a session, and then compared each target against this memorized representation instead of, or in addition to, comparing it against the reference presented at the start of each trial. Alternatively, they could have formed representations of the “high” and “low” targets presented during early training session(s), and judged whether the target presented on each testing trial was more similar to this “high” or “low” template. The results of our testing studies using a reference that alternated randomly between two F0 values suggest that ferrets, like birds, rats and primates, may adopt such an “absolute” pitch-matching strategy, rather than comparing pitch values across sounds presented in sequence. Whichever of these approaches were employed by the animals, in order to perform the task, the ferrets had to be able to evaluate the targets along an ordered perceptual scale that correlates with the F0 of the sound. In other words, they had to rate the pitch height of the target.\n\nA fourth strategy for solving our discrimination task may be proposed, which would not be consistent with the interpretation that ferrets order the F0 of sounds. That is, the ferrets may have simply memorized the two targets and labelled them as “left response” and “right response” sounds, without making any judgment on the target sounds' relative pitch. During the early training stages, where only two different target sounds were presented per session, this would be a viable strategy. However, if the animals were only capable of a simple recognition of memorized sound samples, then that would leave them poorly prepared for the first testing session, in which 30 new targets were introduced. We found that the animals adapted very quickly to the testing regime, and adopted a “go left for low and go right for high” strategy right from the first training session, which suggests that they quickly generalized their responses to the new target sounds as though they perceived the F0 of these harmonic sounds along an ordered pitch scale.\n\nWe have not been able to retrain our animals from this study on a task where references rove widely across more than 2 F0 values from trial to trial, which suggests that during their training they may have come to rely at least in part on a memorized pitch boundary. The perceptual demands of this task should not be very different, but from an animal training perspective it is much harder: randomized references make the stimulus set a great deal more variable, and it is correspondingly harder for the animal to discover the rules by which it is to respond to the stimuli. However, preliminary data from another laboratory suggests that ferrets can be trained to respond to the relative frequency of pure tones with roving references, provided the reference is varied from the beginning of training (Yin et al., 2007).\n\nB. Frequency acuity of ferrets\n\nFerrets have been trained on a number of sound localization (Kelly and Kavanagh, 1994; Parsons et al., 1999; Kacelnik et al., 2006; Bizley et al., 2007; Nodal et al., 2008) and detection tasks (Kelly et al., 1986; Hine et al., 1994; Kelly et al., 1996; Fritz et al., 2003; Fritz et al., 2007) in the past, but rarely in discrimination tasks. In a series of studies by Shamma and colleagues, ferrets were trained on an aversively reinforced, go/no-go task to discriminate between two tones of fixed frequencies (Fritz et al., 2005) or to discriminate pure tones from inharmonic tone complexes (Kalluri et al., 2008). These experiments have demonstrated that ferrets can make discriminations based on simple spectral or harmonic cues, and that the response properties of primary auditory cortical neurons undergo systematic changes during this behavior. However, the present work is the first published measurement of frequency discrimination acuity in ferrets.\n\nThe pure tone Weber fractions of ferrets in our high/low discrimination task were higher than those previously reported for frequency change detection tasks carried out in other species (reviewed by Heffner et al., 1971; Fay 1988; Shofner, 2005). For example, on frequency discrimination tasks that use a 500-Hz reference tone, Weber fractions have been measured to be 3.4% in chinchillas (Nelson and Kiester, 1978), 1.6% in guinea pigs (Heffner et al., 1971), 1.4% in bushbabies (Heffner et al., 1969a), 2.5% in tree shrews (Heffner et al., 1969b), 3.6% in budgerigars (Dooling and Saunders, 1975) and 1.7% in cats (Elliott et al., 1960). In comparison, the average Weber fraction measured for ferrets in our direction judgment task at this reference frequency was about tenfold greater, at 36.4%. Even across studies that use the same species and very similar tasks, Weber fractions for pitch discrimination can vary widely. The average Weber fractions of chinchillas for a 250-Hz reference tone were measured on go/no-go tasks to be 4.6% by Nelson and Kiester (1978) and 21.2% by Shofner (2000). Large differences in pure tone frequency discrimination performance are also sometimes present across individual members of the same species within the same study. For instance, in one study, a group of nine male macaque monkeys tested with a 1000-Hz reference tone had individual Weber fractions that ranged from approximately 0.9 to 9.0% (Prosen et al., 1990). The pitch direction judgments of human listeners have also been observed to vary widely across individuals (Semal and Demany, 2006).\n\nNevertheless, the relatively high frequency difference limens measured here in ferrets warrant careful consideration. There are several factors which might explain the difference in frequency acuity measured on our current 2AFC task and previous go/no-go studies. They include differences in the sensory comparison required, cognitive demands, the number of stimulus exposures per trial, variation in sound levels, and the reverberant environment.\n\nThe design of the present task required animals to classify a stimulus pitch as “high” or “low” relative to a given reference (a two-alternative-forced-choice, or 2AFC, task), while in most other previous animal studies, the participants were required only to report any detectable change in a continuously repeated sound (a go/no-go task), and did not need to be able to distinguish pitch decreases from increases. Our design therefore requires a more demanding sensory judgment, and one might expect the animals' thresholds to be correspondingly higher.\n\nAnother, less intuitive, difficulty is associated with carrying out 2AFC frequency discrimination tasks in animals. Previous studies have suggested that when performing go/no-go tasks, animals tend to make response choices based on the “quality” of sounds (such as frequency or timbre), while in 2AFC tasks animals prefer to respond to the spatial location of the sound source (reviewed by Burdick, 1979). The reasons for this task specificity, which appears to be much more pronounced in the auditory than the visual modality, are still unclear, but they may include a difficulty in initially learning the rules required by a 2AFC task (which amount to simply “approach the source” in localization tasks), and the working memory challenge involved with arbitrarily mapping sound quality onto two response options. Sound quality discriminations have been shown to be more difficult to train on 2AFC tasks than in go/no-go alternatives in a number of species, including guinea pigs (Upton, 1929), chinchillas (Burdick, 1980), cats (Elliott et al., 1962), and monkeys (Elliott et al., 1971). Of particular interest to the present discussion is a frequency discrimination study by Dobrzecka and Konorski (1968), described in Burdick (1979). They report that dogs more accurately discriminated the frequencies of pairs of tones in a go/no-go task than in a two-choice procedure (but for an alternative interpretation see Neill and Harrison, 1987).\n\nOur task design also differs from go/no-go studies of frequency discrimination in terms of the number of stimuli presented on each trial. In our task, as in most human studies, the ferrets heard only one instance of the reference and target before making their response choice on each trial. In the typical go/no-go frequency discrimination task, a sequence of reference tones is presented and the signal for detection is a frequency alteration in two or more of the tones near the end of this sequence. Therefore, in these studies, the animals are provided with “multiple looks” at the sounds to be discriminated in any one trial, whereas in our task a sensory decision is made after hearing each stimulus only once.\n\nThe randomization of stimulus level in the present study across 15 dB is larger than that used by most previous studies. We included this variation to prevent our animals from using simple spectral level cues, and to encourage them to rely solely on the F0 of sounds to solve the task. This manipulation might also encourage subjects to rely more heavily on temporal pitch cues and/or spectral matching of lower harmonics in our stimuli, since the higher harmonics may have been resolved at low sound levels but unresolved at higher ones.\n\nFinally, the potential effect of reverberations on pitch discrimination is worth consideration. Here, stimuli were presented via a loudspeaker inside a chamber with vacuum glass walls, which provided good sound isolation but are also reverberant. In most human studies, sounds are presented over headphones to avoid reverberation from the environment. In a recent study, Sayles and Winter (2008) demonstrated that reverberation can significantly impair one set of pitch cues, namely those that may arise from regularities in the temporal envelope of the high frequency part of the sound signal. However, the signals we used in this experiment carry a substantial amount of pitch information that is far less affected by reverberation. This includes the temporal fine structure of the sound (i.e. frequency components at less than about 4 kHz to which auditory nerve fibres can phase lock), as well as resolvable low harmonics. In normal human listeners, spectral template matching is not thought to be the main strategy used to discriminate sounds that differ in pitch (Moore and Peters, 1992), but the presence of resolved harmonics can nevertheless contribute to better pitch discrimination thresholds (Bernstein and Oxenham, 2006). At present, little is known about the degree to which other mammals normally rely on spectral and temporal cues for pitch discrimination.\n\nIn summary, we attribute the relatively elevated Weber fractions reported here for pitch judgments in ferrets to the higher cognitive and sensory demands posed by a low/high pitch judgment compared to a mere change detection. This result is consistent with a study of pitch discrimination in children with cochlear implants, who achieved better pitch discrimination thresholds in a change detection task than in a task that required them to make pitch direction judgments (Vongpaisal et al., 2006). The authors of that study suggest that while subjects may have been able to solve the change detection task using spectral cues, these cues may have been insufficient to enable them to order the same sounds (synthesized piano notes) along a pitch scale. Thus the performance in a change detection task may not reflect subjects' ability to tell high from low pitch. Along similar lines, Semal and Demany (2006) have shown that listeners with frequency difference limens that are elevated but within the normal range find it easier to detect frequency changes than to identify the direction of those changes, while, counter-intuitively, listeners with the best frequency acuity have better thresholds on a pitch direction-identification task than on a change detection task. The authors hypothesize that the human auditory cortex may contain frequency “shift detectors”, which would enable the classification of small pitch changes (Demany and Ramos, 2005). The likely physiological basis for such shift detectors in the human brain, or indeed that of other mammals, remains unknown. From a comparative psychophysics point of view, it will be interesting for future studies to measure ferrets' difference limens for pitch on a go/no-go, F0 change detection task, in order to determine if and how thresholds on this task might differ from our current 2AFC measurements.\n\nOur results indicate interesting parallels between humans and ferrets. For both species, Weber fractions changed across reference F0s in similar ways, and thresholds were indistinguishable in the pure tone and the artificial vowel versions of the task. However, humans discriminated changes in F0 consistently and substantially better than ferrets. This was not entirely surprising, given that previous studies have already established that the pure tone frequency discrimination performance of humans is superior to that of many other mammals across the reference range tested here (Fay, 1988). It has been proposed that the superior performance of humans in these tasks might be due to differences in basilar membrane mechanics or higher densities of ganglion cells in the human cochlea (Elliott et al., 1960). While humans' exceptional sensitivity to low-frequency pure tones may also facilitate pitch discrimination, ferrets are easily able to detect 200-1200 Hz tones presented at the levels used in the present study (Kelly et al., 1986). Furthermore, the fundamental frequencies of ferrets' vocalizations are within this frequency range (unpublished observations from the laboratory of Didier Depireux), so it is reasonable to expect that they might perceive the pitch of artificial vowels."
