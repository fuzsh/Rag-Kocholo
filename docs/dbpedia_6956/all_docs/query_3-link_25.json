        "text": "FUNK D'VOID:\n\nHailing from Scotland, with a career spanning over two decades, the now Barcelona based DJ, producer, coach and presenter, Funk D'Void aka Lars Sandberg’s influence on the dance music scene is undeniable.\n\n“Diabla”, released in 2001, was coined ‘biggest techno record of the year’ by DJ Mag and is known and appreciated by today’s youth. It was a record that united scenes and found its way into the boxes of the world’s leading house, techno, trance and progressive DJs alike, seeing the Scot soar into the DJ elite, performing at the world’s best clubs and festivals.\n\nOther tracks such as ‘Jack Me Off’, ‘Bad Coffee’, and ‘Emotional Content', remixes for Underworld, New Order, Laurent Garnier, releases for Bedrock, Drumcode, All Day I Dream and mix compilations for Balance Series, Soma's Sci-Fi Hi-Fi, Cocoon, plus ‘Blood’ and ‘I Try’ under his moniker Francois Dubois, went on to become huge underground hits and crown his legendary status in dance music history.\n\nD’Void’s contributions to the scene don't end with his music. He founded the label Outpost Recordings in 1999, and has recently launched 'Fixed By Funk' - a platform to mentor the next generation of talent.\n\nHis new collaboration with True Underground will see him become a show host, interviewing the world's biggest DJ's and artists and selecting the hottest promos for the magazine.\n\nIt's clear that Funk D'Void's impact on music and the scene is unparalleled, as he continues to push boundaries through his music and inspire the next generation of talent.\n\n---\n\nAcid Rockers:\n\nMatthew Buggins, AKA Acid Rockers, has been a staple name in House, Breaks and Techno since the early 1990's, heavily inspired by the early Detroit sound with the inimitable alter ego; Bass Culture on D:Vision Records. Curating an impressive array of releases across a wide variety of genres and production aliases from Quark, Cygnus Loop, Hippies with Altitude and Tayo Meets Acid Rockers. A body of work spanning 3 decades found on the likes of AAA Recordings, Harthouse and Sony / Blueroom Records. The chameleon-like Matt Buggins has a rare talent, merging genres seamlessly with melodic fluidity and hauntingly evocative rhythms.\n\n---\n\nClaire Marshall:\n\nPromoter & DJ Claire Marshall has been DJing and producing electronic music since 1999. Originally resident at North Bar, Manchester and featured sets at Circus, Liverpool; Orbit & Detatched, Leeds. Moving to Toronto in the early 2000's and the subsequent total immersion in the underground techno scene in Southern Ontario. Spinning with some of North America's finest in Toronto, London and Windsor to Detroit and the iconic Motor Lounge. DJing across Europe and North America including the Burning Man festival, Nevada. Recent production work is informed by experimental electronica and musicology with a strong emphasis on the history of sound."
