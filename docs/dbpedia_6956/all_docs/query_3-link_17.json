A veteran of electronic music production, Peter had his first release in 1990 on the RHAM! Records label under the artist name 'Doggy'.\n\n- - -\n\nMAGNETIK SOURCE\n\nClaire Marshall and Andy Byrne, the dynamic force behind Magnetik Source, unite the distinct perspectives of a musicologist and an archaeologist with the expertise of a highly regarded electronic music producer. Guided by a shared belief in the transformative power of electronic music, they intricately fuse the science of psychoacoustics, the innovation of jazz & classical, and the raw rhythms of Detroit techno.\n\n- - -\n\nACID ROCKERS\n\nMatthew Buggins, AKA Acid Rockers, has been a staple name in House, Breaks and Techno since the early 1990's, heavily inspired by the early Detroit sound with the inimitable alter ego; Bass Culture on D:Vision Records. Curating an impressive array of releases across a wide variety of genres and production aliases from Quark, Cygnus Loop, Hippies with Altitude and Tayo Meets Acid Rockers. A body of work spanning 3 decades found on the likes of AAA Recordings, Harthouse and Sony / Blueroom Records. The chameleon-like Matt Buggins has a rare talent, merging genres seamlessly with melodic fluidity and hauntingly evocative rhythms.\n\n- - -\n\nDEMETAE\n\nFrom the humble city of Preston, Demetae caught the wave of one of Manchesters biggest promoters and jumped on the Love Dose Records party train. This allowed Rob to vent his passion for music on the turntables in now iconic clubs such as Sankeys, Hidden & The White Hotel. ​Inspired by the echoes of rave in his lugs, Demetae launched his own imprint «Powerful Recordings» with several releases from the likes of Kashpitzky, Barium Network & Sted Mørk.\n\n- - -\n\nCOTTAM\n\nLocal legend Cottam, one of the finest DJ talents in the UK, completes the lineup for an after-party ft electro-inspired tackle til 2am.\n\n- - -\n\nThe Ferret presents:\n\nWOLFGANG FLÜR - Musik Soldat\n\n(ex-Kraftwerk)\n\nwith special guests:\n\nPeter Duggal // Magnetik Source // Acid Rockers // Demetae // Cottam\n\nThe Ferret, Preston\n\nFriday 21st June 2024\n\nDoors 7PM - 2AM\n\nWolfgang Flür stage time 9:30pm - 11pm"
