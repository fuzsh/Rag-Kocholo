Bach’s Goldbergvariationen, bringing new light to these incredible compositions and creating a new experience for themselves and the audience.\n\nDanusha Waskiewicz loves sharing her experience and her new horizons with young musicians holding masterclasses and perfection courses at the most prestigious music schools and at Rome’s Avos Project, where she teaches regularly.\n\nMiguel A.
