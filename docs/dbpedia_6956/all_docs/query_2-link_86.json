        "text": "Biography\n\nRock n’ roll circa 2009 is becoming an increasingly predictable affair, so, whenever a band comes along refusing to fit the mold, it usually doesn’t go unnoticed. Case in point, Boston’s Mongrel – vocalist Drew Barker, guitarist Adam Savage, bassist Rev, and drummer Ed Loguercio. Formed with the belief that \"punk\" was more than a fashion requirement, Mongrel was born in 2003 in Eastern Massachusetts, quickly leaving their mark on both the local and national music scene.\n\nThey have been included in \"5 Bands to Watch\" (Hippo Press, March 2005) and \"5 Bands to Discover\" (Hippo Press, November 2005). Mongrel has also been featured in Revolver magazine’s “Raw Talent” section (Nov. 2005), and was cited in Metal Edge magazine as “the hardest working band in Boston” (Jan. 2006). Feburary 2008 found Mongrel in Metal Edge once again, as well as featured on their monthly sampler cd alongside Ozzy Osbourne and Cradle of Filth. In September 2008, Mongrel was the featured \"Underground Buzz\" artist on Loudside.com.\n\nMongrel has toured extensively throughout the US, repeatedly sharing stages with metal and punk luminaries as diverse as The Misfits, FEAR, Korn, GWAR, Dizzy Reed (Guns N' Roses), The Exploited, Prong, Otep, Wednesday 13, Michale Graves, Blitzkid, The Independents, Trashlight Vision, Piggy D’s Evacuation Plan, Mushroomhead, Hed(pe), American Headcharge, Mower, and All That Remains, receiving airplay on major Rock outlets including WAAF, WBCN, WFNX, WGIR, WHEB, WUML. Along the way, Mongrel has earned an impressive collection of endorsements and sponsorships including Marshall Amps, Peavey, Monster Cable, Seymour Duncan pickups, Dean Markley strings, Agile guitars, In Tune Guitar Picks, and Cocaine & Brawndo energy drinks.\n\nMongrel's first full length album \"Fear, Lies, & Propaganda\" was re-released by Screaming Ferret Wreckords/ Locomotive Records / Ryko Distribution on April 8th, 2008. The album featured such standout tracks as “Bound to Crash,” “Dyslexic Alchemist (Fucked it all away),” “No Gods, No Masters,” and especially “West Memphis Hell,” the latter of which focuses on the highly controversial West Memphis 3 case.\n\nFollowing up the critically acclaimed \"Fear, Lies, & Propaganda\" cd, Mongrel has released their new 5 song EP entitled \"Revenge\" in October 2009, with their new full length CD \"This Means War\" due out in early 2010. \"Revenge\" was recorded by Tim Koukos (Nuclear Assault, Meliah Rage) at SFW studios in Manchester, NH and was mixed by Jeff Wallace (Biohazard, Pro-Pain, End of an Era) at Entrolab Studio in Toms River, NJ and is already garnering great reviews from fans and critics alike. Mongrel guitarist Adam Savage states, \"the EP is a great way to introduce the steps forward we've taken with the new recordings that we've been working on this year, and gives a taste of what's to come on the new full length album \"This Means War\". Savage also makes clear that all of the songs on \"Revenge\" are exclusive to this EP and will not be on the upcoming full length cd, stating, \"We wanted to keep the EP as something special for the fans and not make them re-buy the same songs when the new album comes out.\"\n\nBalancing old school punk intensity, and metal aggression, with hard rock hooks and riffs, Mongrel is a hungry, young rock band ready to take on the world. The recordings are only part of the equation though, as Mongrel live is an equally unforgettable experience. “Once we're on stage, it's no holds barred with the always possible risk of injury with 3 people up front in near constant motion. It's high energy, intense, fun, and interactive. Fans can expect a band that is always willing to hang out and chat, as we are all music fans too, and are always eager to talk to the bands that we love, so it is very important for us to interact with anyone who wants to at our shows or online.”\n\nMore extensive touring throughout the US and overseas is in the plans for 2010 to support the release of \"Revenge\" and the upcoming new album \"This Means War\".\n\nSponsored/Endorsed By:\n\nMarshall Amplification\n\nPeavey\n\nMonster Cable\n\nSeymour Duncan Pickups\n\nDean Markley Strings\n\nAgile Guitars\n\nIn Tune Guitar Picks\n\nCocaine Energy Drinks\n\nBrawndo \"The Thirst Mutilator\" Energy Drinks\n\nSOME QUOTES ABOUT MONGREL :\n\n\"If anybody knows about musical car crashes it's me! Mongrel embodies all that is great about punk rock. Their music sweats pure angst, driven by an audible destruction that is in rare form these days. And then there's the live show....wear a helmet!\" - Piggy D., bassist, Rob Zombie\n\n“Mongrel is hands down the hardest working punk rock machine in New England. With their aggressive work ethics, high-energy live shows and pure dedication to the mission, Mongrel's latest release \"Fear, Lies, and Propaganda\" will surely bring them to new levels of much deserved success. Even nuclear war could not stop these guys....check them out!” - Joe O’Brien, Owner, Rat Pak Records\n\n\"Mongrel go for the throat quicker than the bastardized canine from which they sequester their Hancock. The sobriquet under which they banner their aural beatings could not be more fitting. Plus, I hear they eat babies.\" - Argyle Goolsby, Blitzkid\n\n“Mongrel take the DIY ethic of Black Flag, the anthems of the Misfits and throw a low slung Les Paul on it like Gn’R!” - Acey Slade, Trashlight Vision, ex-Dope/Murderdolls\n\n\"Mongrel will bite you, then kick your **** musically in a way that you are going to love.\" - Shred, WBCN, local music director\n\nVisit http://www.MongrelBand.com for all the latest information."
