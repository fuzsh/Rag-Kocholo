        "text": "A few questions - interview with Matt from technical death metal band APOSTATE.\n\nAve, can you introduce your band to our readers? – When was it founded and what style of music do you play , etc.?\n\nApostate were founded in 2016, after the dissolution of several other bands we were in at the time. We play a style of brutal/technical death metal that harks back to the golden age of innovation in the mid 90s.\n\nWhere and under what conditions were you recording the new album? Who was in charge of sound, production and mastering?\n\nThe record was produced by the band. Myself and Dan (bass player in Apostate) have music production experience. I mixed the record and Dan engineered and mastered it. This saves us a lot of money but was also a bit of a nightmare as you get too focused on the production aspect of things when we should be concentrating on performance. I have heard some good comments about the production though so I think it was worth it. We tried to steer away from the modern, super clean production style as it doesn't really suit our music. For our next record, I think we will go to a different producer and studio, as it is good to have a different pair of ears working on it.\n\nHow many copies were released and which medium was used for this new edition (CD, digital, vinyl, cassette)?\n\nLord of the Sick records are handling the cd versions and they are currently available for pre order, along with t shirts, at their webstore. The album is also available on bandcamp as a digital download and on all streaming services.\n\nWho is the author of the lyrics and how were they created and about what do the lyrics deal with?\n\nOur vocalist Uldis writes all the lyrics. They tend to draw attention to the less preached stories in religious texts, ones of violence and genocide. The true side of religion.\n\nWho created the logo of the band, and who took care of the graphics and the website? What about you and social networks? Do you consider these things important?\n\nThe logo was designed by the band. The artwork for At The Tomb of Sanity was done by Alex Tartsus who did an amazing job at capturing the essence of the band and the record. Of course in this day and age social media is important. For us, having great artwork is important because on social media, it is what people click on before they hear our music, so it has to be eye catching. No Google image copy and paste here. Good artwork goes a long way.\n\nWhich label did you choose for releasing your album and why this label? Are you satisfied by how your label represents you and takés care about you?\n\nThe label chose us in a way. We were just about to independently release the record on physical media, when Lord of the Sick contacted us and asked us if we wanted to be on the label. They have some great releases under their belt already and do a great job with distribution and merch, so we were more than happy to sign to them.\n\nWhich bands do you idolise and where do you get your inspiration?\n\nI can't speak for all the other guys in the band but my favourite bands are Deeds of Flesh, Suffocation, Pyrexia, and a ton of other 90s Death metal bands. I listen to a lot of demos from that era too, at the moment I am going back and liatening to a ton of Texas death metal from that era, bands like Necrocide and Prophecy.\n\nDid you send your record to some Labels - which are the labels? How was the response?\n\nAs I said before, we were about to release the record independently then Lord of the Sick contacted us.\n\nHow many gigs have you played? Which type of gigs do you prefer, whether it's (clubs or festivals) and which of your performances would you consider as the best?\n\nWe have played a bunch of shows up and down the country, but we are looking to play some over in Europe in the near future. We prefer the smaller club shows as they tend to have a better atmosphere, but any show is great as long as someone shows up! Our best show so far would probably be at the local venue called the ferret. You can find the full set on YouTube!\n\nWhat about your plans for the future? What do you want to achieve with the band?\n\nWe definitely want to start work on a new album soon. We are just enjoying the response from At The Tomb of Sanity at the moment. More shows and hopefully some overseas too!\n\nHow and where can your fans contact you? Can you provide some contact information?\n\nYou can contact us on our facebook page or at raredeathmetal@gmail.com\n\nThanks for the interview and see you at a show soon!"
