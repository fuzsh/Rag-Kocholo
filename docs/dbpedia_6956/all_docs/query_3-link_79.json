        "text": "Australasian Animal Registry pet identification and recovery service\n\nThe Royal Agricultural Society of NSW (RAS) is passionate about agricultureâ€”and all its creatures great and small.\n\nThe Australasian Animal Registry (AAR) is a core pillar of the RAS, operating since 1989, through which we seek to support and protect lost pets to return them to their owners.\n\nAAR maintains records for 4 million animals, and it is growing daily. We register all animals: dogs; cats; birds; horses; reptiles; even ferrets. AAR provides an accurate and independent service designed to assist in the speedy recovery of registered animals.\n\nAAR is accredited by Queensland Government, Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), Victorian Government, Department of Primary Industry (DPI), and the Bureau of Animal Welfare.\n\nOnly authorised users, including councils and veterinary clinics, are able to access the animal records for recovery purposes. A secure system of ID numbers and AAR staff training ensure the integrity of this process."
