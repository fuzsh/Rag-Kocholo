It's the album where Mike Munro was back on vocals.\n\nJust curious and looking for some feedback.\n\nAs far as that early Meliah Rage sound, it's excellent. A perfect mix of \"Kill...\" and \"Solitary...\". Sounds like the album that should have come right after \"Death Valley Dream\". Even production-wise. I would love it if you'd hook up w/them and re-release this. I had no idea this was a CD-R though, and in short supply. Now I know why I could never get hold of a copy...\n\nApr 10, 2013\n\n#7\n\nI haven't heard this MR album. I did check the latest album they put out on Metal-on-Metal Records and it didn't do anything for me.\n\nTribunalRecords\n\nRecord Label(s)/Vocalist\n\nSep 12, 2007\n\n3,907\n\n12\n\n38\n\nwww.tribunalrecords.net\n\nApr 11, 2013\n\n#8\n\nI haven't heard this MR album. I did check the latest album they put out on Metal-on-Metal Records and it didn't do anything for me.\n\nThis album has the original singer. it's pretty killer album if you liked the first two. I never heard anything after those myself, but when I heard Mike was back on vocals I had to check it out.\n\nI don't remember where I wound up buying it, but i remember it being a bitch to get ahold of and then i opened it and was even more livid it wasn't silver pressed. Booklet was nice however.\n\nmpj1\n\nMember\n\nJul 25, 2005\n\n87\n\n0\n\n6\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nApr 11, 2013\n\n#9\n\nAs far as that early Meliah Rage sound, it's excellent.
