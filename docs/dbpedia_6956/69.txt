Ferret Music’s Paul Conroy and Carl Severson Launch Good Fight Entertainment

Paul Conroy and Carl Severson, veterans of the hardcore and metal scenes, have launched Good Fight Entertainment. The company, comprised of a management division, a record label, and a sports management division, will be based in Cream Ridge, NJ. Conroy and Severson previously ran the label Ferret Music, which helped to launch the careers of Killswitch Engage, Every Time I Die, and From Autumn To Ashes.

The company’s record label, Good Fight Music, will receive distribution through Sony’s RED. Initial releases on Good Fight Music include Cancer Bats‘ Bears Mayors Scraps and Bones and Son of Aurelius‘ The Farthest Reaches, both scheduled to be released April 13.

Artists initially signed to Good Fight’s management division include August Burns Red, Between the Buried and Me, Cannibal Corpse, Chiodos, and Every Time I Die.

Conroy and Severson have looked to sports industry veteran Rich Lisk to head the sports management division, which will initially represent BMX rider Dakota Roche and skateboarder/actor Mike Vallely.

Conroy sees the extreme sports division as a natural extension of the management side of Good Fight, noting: “While each business is clearly unique, we plan to create synergies between music and sports through co-branding, live events, and content-based online promotion.”
