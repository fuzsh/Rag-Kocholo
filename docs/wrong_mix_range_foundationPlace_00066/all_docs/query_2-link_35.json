        "text": "Online accounting software firm Xero, which ranks as number one on the Forbes Most Innovative Growth Companies, is launching into South Africa tomorrow.\n\n\"Out of all the regions we could move into, we're most excited about SA. We already have several thousand existing South African customers, so we’re keen to help a lot more small businesses thrive,\" Gary Turner, Xero&#039;s managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told me. South Africa is Xero's sixth country, after its five main markets: United Kingdom, USA, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore.\n\nXero provides online accounting software for over 600,000 small and micro businesses (SME) in a variety of sectors, and overs mobile apps.\n\n\"We were particularly proud when in May 2015, Xero was ranked for a second year running as No. 1 in Forbes’ list of the World’s 100 Most Innovative Growth Companies, as a firm that is innovative now and is expected to remain so in the future,\" Turner adds.\n\nSouth Africa has been the economic powerhouse in Africa, until it's economy was overtaken by Nigeria and Egypt. Egypt's unexpected leapfrog was announced last week in a shock analysis by KPMG using International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) data. South Africa still has the \"continent’s most developed economy, and has a more diversified economic base than the Egyptian economy… [but] this development is largely attributed to weakness in the Rand that, in turn, has largely been as a result of domestic issues,\" KPMG Financial Risk Manager Christie Viljoen wrote last week.\n\nHowever, the SME sector in South Africa (SA) remains strong, and is clearly what Xero intends to tap into. \"Since small businesses make up the majority of all enterprises in South Africa, and the fact that a third of South Africa's GDP comes from small businesses means that even a modest improvement in SMB productivity can have a significant impact on the overall economy,\" says Turner.\n\n\"SA has had its fair share of economic challenges over the last few years, however the country's entrepreneurial spirit is amazing. We believe South African SMEs in particular have real potential that can be unlocked by the arrival of new technologies… that can optimise businesses' efficiency. SMEs have been historically not been very well served by technology. A new generation of technology, like ours, is empowering SMEs and we're proud to be part of that.\"\n\nBased in Wellington, New Zealand, Xero was started in 2006 has rapidly expanded globally. It now has 600,000 users in over 180 countries. \"We're one of the fastest-growing mature [software as a service (SaaS] companies in the world and are aiming to hit $1billion in annual revenue in the next five years, and achieve $200 million annual revenue by next financial year,\" adds Turner.\n\nInitially priced in US Dollars, the billing will change to South African Rand in the near future, he says. Xero currently costs for $5 per month for its starter option in South Africa, $7 for the most popular standard option and $10 for premium.\n\n\"At Xero, we truly believe that small businesses are the lifeblood of the global economy, so we’re focused on boosting small business success through technology and networks. Cloud technology and SaaS are opening up a new world of opportunity by increasing access to affordable technologies.\""
