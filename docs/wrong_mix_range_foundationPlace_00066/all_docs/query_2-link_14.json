Sometimes we all wish for a magic wand to make it all better.\n\nWell. Xero is here to help (and we at Starfish are too)!\n\nWhat is the Fund?\n\nThe Xero Beautiful Business Fund is a new initiative to back small business owners for the future. They are offering NZ$750,000 in funding to Xero small business customers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, the UK, and the US with the aim of helping businesses keep doing what they do best.\n\nApplications opened on 23 August 2023 and will close on 6 October 2023, with the winners announced in November 2023. There will be four winners from each country, each receiving a fund of NZ$20,000. And of those winners, four will become global winners and will receive an additional NZ$50,000!\n\nThere are four categories to enter, and no limit on the number of categories that you can enter for. They are –\n\n· Innovating for sustainability\n\n· Trailblazing with technology\n\n· Strengthening community connection\n\n· Upskilling for the future\n\nFor more information on what you need to be doing in each category, refer to the following guide https://brandfolder.xero.com/8HSCTPAX/at/nbpjxmw899xc4rm3kc2k7q/Xero_Beautiful_Business_Fund_Categories_and_Prizes.pdf\n\nWhat you need to do to apply\n\nRecord your pitch video, which must be 90 seconds long, and provide background on your business, why you need funding, and your future plans.\n\nComplete the application form and upload your pitch video.\n\nThat’s it! Sit back and wait until November when the winners are announced.\n\nHow we can help\n\nWe may not have coffers as deep as Xero which enable us to provide funding for our clients and prospects, but our intentions are just the same. Here at Starfish, we aim to provide help, encouragement, and support to our clients and we have many options available to you through our contacts to help with funding for new technology, when cash flow is tight, or when you are looking to expand your business. Please contact us to discuss how we can help you to achieve your goals!"
