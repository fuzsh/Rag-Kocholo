        "text": "Xero has become the favourite accounting software of the startup industry. Its cloud-based platform and robust integrations make it accessible to businesses in all industries from SaaS to e-commerce and everything between. 95% of our clients are on Xero and this remains our accounting system of choice at Fullstack.\n\nWe will run over the basic functions of the program you will need to know to get started.\n\nOnce you have subscribed and setup your basic details, you will need to setup your Chart of Accounts. You can use Xero’s standard Chart of Accounts template or work with your Fullstack Advisor to tailor this to your specific needs.\n\nIf your business has been running previously you can add existing customer and supplier lists you may have. Use the template file to upload in batches.\n\nWhen setting up your payment settings, bear in mind Xero’s payment services integrate well with PayPal and Stripe.\n\nConnecting Xero to your bank account via Xero Bank Feeds is straightforward, but you will need your bank details on hand as this will take you directly to the online banking portal to integrate the two.\n\nImporting bank statements can save time if the bank feed integration has issues. Just go to Manage Account > Import a Statement, then upload the CSV file from the bank for the period required.\n\nNote that Xero Bank Feed only works on a progressive basis, so any prior transactions will have to be upload in this manner.\n\nXero Tip – Set up Bank Feeds\n\nUsing bank rules will be your best friend to get much of your transactions reconciled automatically. This is a very useful tool for allocating recurring or standardised transactions that are for the same account every time. For example, BP Petrol is likely to be for Fuel. You can create the rules based on the amount, name or date.\n\nYou can manually add bills by generating these under Business > Bills to Pay > New Bill. You can then match them to transaction from your bank feed when reconciling once the bill is paid.\n\nUse the purchases overview menu to oversee all your bills & accounts payable where you can see those awaiting payment, drafts and any overdue.\n\nXero Tip – Email your bills directly to Xero\n\nEmail your bills directly to Xero and save yourself time getting your accounts in order each month. Just go to your company name > Files – and email pdfs of your bills to the unique email address shown. Add the bill when reconciling by selecting add details in the reconciling screen and attach the file to the transaction.\n\nTo send customised invoices, be sure to setup your invoice settings in a friendly format to your clients.\n\nYou can generate quotes with your company logo and style easily. Once these are drafted each can be sent to the clients for approval, and once approved are transferred automatically to invoices.\n\nIf no quote is necessary creating new invoices is very straightforward. The minimum details needed will be clients name, quantity, unit price, due date and account. For any recurring clients just select the recurring invoice tab.\n\nControl debtors by using the sales overview tab. Select Send Statements to chase those that are still awaiting payment. You can set reminders up to send these weekly, fortnightly or monthly if necessary.\n\nAdd your employee’s details on the platform by selecting Employees > Add Employee.\n\nThis process is much easier with an onboarding spreadsheet which your Fullstack Advisor can give to you.\n\nOnce their details are organised, add them to the employee portal so they can view their payslips, next pay date and total salary.\n\nXero is one of the most user-friendly accounting platforms around and clients love the way it supports the financial insights about their business. If you need training on best practice or even regular bookkeeping, please speak to the Xero Accountants at Fullstack Advisory."
