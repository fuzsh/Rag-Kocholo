        "text": "Taking your accounting firm to the next level requires you to make certain investments in your professional development.\n\nOne of the best ways to do this is by attending conferences.\n\nThese conferences provide opportunities to learn from other industry experts, network with other professionals, discover new technologies, and stay up to date on the latest trends in the field —all of which will help you scale your firm.\n\nMoreover, partaking in these events is a great way to earn free CPE credits to maintain your certification and practice license. In essence, you get to learn while fulfilling your professional requirements.\n\nA win-win situation!\n\nIn 2024, some must-attend conferences should be on your calendar. So, in this article, we’ve compiled the top 23 accounting events you should consider attending in 2024.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\nHow We Created The List of Top Conferences\n\nTo develop a fair and truly valuable list, we considered the following factors.\n\nThe Organizers: The organizers’ reputation and experience determine the quality of the event. For any conference to benefit your firm, the organizers need to know the industry well enough to create programs that address real problems. So, we looked for conferences that reputable professional associations and thought leaders who have influenced developments in the industry for years are coordinating.\n\nThe Target Audience: The conference’s target audience determines the invited speakers, program schedule, venue, etc. We restricted the list to only events empowering accounting/CPA/bookkeeping firm founders and team leaders to overcome pressing challenges and advance their firms.\n\nPast Attendee Testimonials: Who better to speak about the value of a conference than past attendees? To estimate these conferences’ impact on your firm, we snooped around to see what past attendees are saying about each of them. And only included those with glowing reviews.\n\nNetworking Opportunities: Networking is a key benefit of attending these events. Because of that, we prioritized events that provide ample opportunities to mingle via breakout sessions, social activities, etc.\n\nCPE/CPD Credits: We also added conferences offering CPE or CPD credits so attendees can kill two birds with one stone.\n\nYou may also be interested in the best accounting practice management software options in 2024.\n\nBest 23 Accounting Conferences to Attend in 2024\n\nHere’s our list of top Accounting Conferences to attend in 2024 to attend:\n\nScaling New Heights 2024\n\nAICPA & CIMA ENGAGE 2024\n\nIntuit Connect 2024 (formerly QuickBooks Connect)\n\nSynergy 2024\n\nXerocon 2024\n\nAccountingWeb Live Expo\n\nDigital CPA 2024\n\nWorkflowCon 2024\n\nDigital Accountancy Show 2024\n\nAccounting Business Expo\n\nTAXPOSIUM 2024\n\n2024 Women Who Count Conference\n\nAICPA & CIMA Not-for-Profit Industry Conference\n\nBKX 2024\n\nLatino Tax Fest\n\nNASBA 117th Annual Meeting\n\nAmerican Accounting Association (AAA) Annual Meeting\n\nIRS Nationwide Tax Forum\n\nAFP 2024\n\nSage Transform 2024\n\nAccounts Payable Conference & P2P Expo 2024\n\nReframe 2024\n\nEnsuring Success 2024\n\n1.

He’ll talk about the potential impacts of quantum technology on the accounting industry to help you prepare for the future.\n\nYou’re one bookkeeping course away from unlocking your next phase of accounting success. Whatever your skill level may be.\n\nBut there are more bookkeeping courses than your schedule can take. On a bad day, you may even end up spending the time you don’t have on a course you don’t need.\n\nWe want to help you prevent that.\n\nThis list of bookkeeping courses will improve your bookkeeping performance. Whether you’re a job seeker or an experienced bookkeeper.\n\nConferences are Investments in Your Firm\n\nThe techniques that brought you here can’t take you where you want to be.
