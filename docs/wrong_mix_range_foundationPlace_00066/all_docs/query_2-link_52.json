        "text": "In today’s digital economy, your business is only as productive as the system you run it on.\n\nAs your business expands and your accounting complexities grow, basic financials will only lead to endless limitations. Don’t let limited software hold you back. Learn the reasons why businesses are making the switch from Xero to NetSuite.\n\nAre you trying to overcome the business challenges that emerge with disconnected applications, manual data entry and unsustainable spreadsheets? If your business is evaluating an alternative accounting/business management system, consider how NetSuite and Xero compare to meet the needs of your business today and in the future.\n\nBoth NetSuite and Xero were developed to handle finance and accounting processes but there is a considerable gap in terms of features and scalability to support increased efficiency.\n\nEntry-level software can be essential to getting small businesses off the ground. Pre-customized systems make administrative tasks manageable for small teams who just need to master the basics. But as businesses grow, adding more and more platforms to keep processes running, and coordinating data between different software becomes more work than it’s worth.\n\nBoost your efficiency by switching to an accounting solution that integrates with every departmentfrom day one.\n\nAbout NetSuite\n\nNetSuite is the leading integrated cloud business software suite that encompasses ERP, financial management / accounting, CRM, ecommerce, inventory/warehouse management, and more.

NetSuite’s solution helps businesses of any size thrive. NetSuite works with your unique business requirements to meet your needs and fit your business processes.

With its user-friendly interface, 3 million subscribers, relatively inexpensive pricing tiers, and its modern system allowing users to work from anywhere, Xero is many businesses’ starter accounting software. Xero plans come with unlimited users and integrates over 1000 third-party apps to streamline data.\n\nHowever, as Xero’s capabilities are limited to accounting, entrepreneurs will have to work with other systems to fulfill essential business processes- doubling time spent on data consolidation.\n\nNetSuite vs Xero Comparison\n\nCompany Oracle NetSuite Xero # Of ERP offerings NetSuite is a single, unified system for CRM, accounting, operations and more.
