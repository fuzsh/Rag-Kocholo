Whether that be to support a passion to become a more sustainable business, upskill employees, philanthropic work in the community, or integrating the latest AI into their business, the fund is here to help small businesses meet their dreams.â\n\nThe application, inclusive of a written form and a short video submission, will be available beginning on 23 August 2023 with the application period closing on 6 October 2023.\n\nInformation on the Xero Beautiful Business Fund can be found at xero.com/beautiful-business-fund.
