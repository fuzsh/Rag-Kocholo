        "text": "Within the Financial leadership Fundamentals Program, I'm often asked about Xero and how to use it.\n\nGenerally, I'm asked by accountants who have moved sideways from either Audit / Investment banking / another large corporate into the start-up and scale-up world and realise that with these smaller businesses, it's all about Xero (and sometimes Quickbooks or MYOB).\n\nIf you have only ever used a large ERP or no accounting software at all (outside university) in your career and are then thrown into a leadership role within a start-up and scale-up, then it can be quite daunting.\n\nThankfully, Xero is super easy to use and is very user friendly. As it's created for small business owners originally, the default is that you don't understand accounting and therefore if you do, after about an hour of playing around, it will make sense.\n\nAs a Finance leader, Finance director or CFO, you only need to understand Xero at a relatively high level as either software, bookkeepers or your team are implementing the financial operations. Therefore, I created a very high level, fast-paced 10 minute overview of Xero and areas that you would be looking at as a finance leader.\n\nTo add to the below Xero overview and How to use Xero, I update the Finance Tech stack that we use with our start-up clients every six months, so be sure to take a look at the latest one here.\n\nWant to fast-track your understanding of finance leadership within a start-up or scale-up?\n\nCheck out the steps in our Framework below to get started:"
