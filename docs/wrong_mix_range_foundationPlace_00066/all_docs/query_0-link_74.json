Shauna and Shannon share many fond memories of our 3rd season here at The Finance Cafe, and some special times came to mind while reflecting on what an incredible year it has been. Shauna contained her fangirl energy like a pro on April 2nd when Laura Gassner Otting, shared her wisdom on finding purpose and defining our own success. Alison Kirkland, CEO of Women's Enterprise Organizations of Canada, broke down perceptions of debt and helped frame the right mindsets for leveraging debt to our entrepreneurial pursuits. Chantel Chapman from The Trauma of Money explained how trauma affects the mind, and how we can work to heal our relationships with money. She encouraged us to sit back and observe the judgmental voice inside our heads and separate our trauma from our current financial practices. She underscores the importance of discussing financial health, and how we can heal our relationships with our finances. Bobbie Racette describes entrepreneurship as medicine, and Shannon couldn’t agree more. Shannon also reflects on speaking at the Women's Entrepreneurship Day event at the Toronto Stock Exchange this year. Thank you all so much for listening in from near and far.

In addition, less than 30% of Canadians responding to a global consumer survey by Statista, felt they were well informed about their insurance and what options they have for protecting themselves and loved ones in the event of an accident, long-term illness, or death. – Shauna Federick\n\n“Business owners concentrate on the day-to-day operations - and even though - statistics reveal more entrepreneurs want to buy life insurance - people get stuck in a holding pattern of procrastination - they think life insurance is a daunting task.” – Tracy Duff\n\n“Life insurance is still an excellent investment tool… one of the few investments that allow for tax-sheltered accumulation of funds and at the same time cover the risk of death.” – Tracy Duff\n\nWebsites:\n\nLife Insurance – Skye Planning Group Inc.\n\nIn this episode, financial advisor Elke Rubach demystifies what it means to work with a financial advisor and encourages us to get comfortable talking about the uncomfortable. She walks us through what meeting with a financial advisor should look like, 4 pillars of financial planning, and the benefits and importance of finding a good fit in a financial advisor. When it comes to financials, she stresses that you should feel empowered to ask the questions you may be nervous too ask and be able to build a relationship with your advisor. You were and are brave enough to start a business, you are brave enough to take care of your financials.\n\nQuote: \"You are planning for the life you want today and in the future\" – Elke Rubach\n\n\"Talking about our financials is not a time to judge\" – Elke Rubach\n\n\"Ensuring you need what you have, and have what you need, and a good advisor can support that’- Shauna Frederick\n\n“If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom”\n\n-Adam Grant\n\nWebsites:\n\nRubachwealth.com\n\n647-808-7700\n\nSocial media handles:\n\nLinkedIn: Rubach Wealth\n\nTwitter: @rubachwealth\n\nInstagram: @rubachwealth\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/rubachwealth\n\nIn this episode Shannon sits down with Heather Sadowy, Loan Manager at the Women's Enterprise Organizations of Canada (WEOC), to discuss the WEOC National loan program.\n\nWith experience in business banking and lending, Heather brings a natural curiosity and strong critical-thinking skills to her role as loan manager at WEOC.
