        "text": "For the past 38 years, the Black Business and Professional Association has been advancing Black business communities, youths and professionals, to create equity and opportunity for all, so no one gets left behind. Through various programs, the BBPA continues to fulfill that promise.\n\nOne of such programs, the BBPA National Scholarship Program (NSP) was established in 1986 and is dedicated to supporting and promoting the achievement of academic excellence by Black Canadian youth through an annual scholarship program. It was borne out of the need to reduce the rate at which Black students drop out of school despite their rising intellect, due to unavailability of funds.\n\nThe NSP is managed by a volunteer board of trustees appointed by the Black Business and Professional Association (BBPA) and is operated separately from the Harry Jerome Awards and all other BBPA activities. The NSP is also backed by mentorship programs, HR programs, financial literacy programs, skills training and more, in order to give a stronger foundation to applicants.\n\nThe NSP receives financial donations from Corporations and individuals that share its mission to support the education and development of Canada’s future leaders, through assisting Black youth in their attainment of post-secondary education. Donors may contribute to the General Fund, used to fund scholarships and assist us in covering our operating costs; or to the Endowment Fund, established to provide a secure financial base for the expansion of the annual scholarships and to create a scholarship program that can be maintained in perpetuity\n\nScholarships are awarded in three categories:\n\nBBPA Specialty Scholarships are grouped into two sub categories,\n\nThe LGBTQ Scholarship, an annually funded scholarship that will be offered for the first time in 2020. The BBPA LGBTQ Scholarship recognizes an outstanding student from the LGBTQ community who wishes to pursue higher education at the college or university level.\n\nIt will be awarded to a student who has completed high school, exhibits academic performance, social contribution and statements of personal need.\n\nThe BBPA Skilled Trades Scholarship, an annually funded scholarship that will be offered for the first time in 2020. This Scholarship recognizes an outstanding student who wishes to pursue a skilled trade of their preference. We recognize the need to bridge the gap between business and our youth, to promote economic community at the person, industry, and national level. It will be awarded to a student who has completed high school, exhibits academic performance, social contribution and statements of personal need.\n\nBBPA Future Leaders Scholarships, are scholarships funded by the investment income from a grant from the Government of Ontario, well meaning individuals and corporations that donate to the endowment funds. They are awarded to students that are the first in their family to attend university or college as well as other qualified applicants;\n\nBBPA Named or Legacy Scholarships are scholarships funded directly by Corporations or Black Canadians who enriched and continue to enrich Canada with their contributions in the arts, the professions, science, business, technology, politics and other areas of endeavor. This could be established in memory of the selected person, or named after selected Corporation. It is generally awarded to outstanding students with academic excellence, community service and/or special needs.\n\nIn 2019, the BBPA awarded 54 scholarships valued close to $180,000. Over the past 34 years the BBPA Scholarship Fund granted approximately 1,150 scholarships to the sum of $4.5 million. We are especially grateful to all organizations and individuals who have made a generous gift to our endowment fund. We thank all our sponsors for their contributions to the education of Black youth through the BBPA National Scholarship Fund.\n\nWe believe that no donation is too small to make a difference! We encourage all to donate to the BBPA National Scholarship Fund and help Black youth realize their dreams!\n\nDonations may be made by cheque to BBPA National Scholarship Fund and mailed to the Fund at 180 Elm, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3M4 or by calling the Fund at 416-504-4097.\n\nThe Scholarships\n\nThe following scholarships are available to Canadian students attending accredited universities or colleges who satisfy the eligibility criteria. Please refer to the overall BBPA National Scholarships eligibility criteria."
