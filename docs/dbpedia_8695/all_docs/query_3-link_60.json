        "text": "A former American fighter pilot is suing the makers of the recent action blockbuster Behind Enemy Lines, claiming that the film has made a wrongful profit out of his real experiences.\n\nScott O'Grady filed his suit against 20th Century Fox on Monday, alleging invasion of privacy. He is also demanding unknown damages from the Discovery Channel, makers of the TV show Behind Enemy Lines: The Scott O'Grady Story.\n\nMr O'Grady, who now works as a motivational speaker, became a media hero in the summer of 1995 after his F-16 jet was shot down over Bosnia. The pilot spent six days hiding from Serb forces and subsisting on rainwater and grass until being rescued by the Marines.\n\nBehind Enemy Lines, which starred Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman, focused on the fraught experience of a US fighter pilot called \"Chris Burnett\". But despite the name, many US reviewers noted the obvious parallels with Mr O'Grady, and the film was often described as being \"loosely based\" on Mr O'Grady's adventure.\n\nElsewhere, though, Mr O'Grady begs to differ with his alleged movie incarnation. \"Captain O'Grady was also troubled that the 'hero' in the Fox movie used foul language, was portrayed as a 'hot dog' type pilot and disobeyed orders, unlike O'Grady,\" the lawsuit claims."
