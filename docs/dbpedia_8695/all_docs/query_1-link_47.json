        "text": "Actor\n\nGene Hackman has been taken to hospital after he was hit by a truck while riding his bicycle in the Florida Keys.\n\nThe 81-year old Hollywood legend underwent treatment before being released several hours later, with his injuries described as no more than ‘bumps and bruises’.\n\nSusan Madore, Hackman’s publicist, said the star had to be airlifted to a medical facility in Miami after he was struck by the heavy goods vehicle.\n\nHackman had been riding on a street in Islamorada when the truck smashed into him from behind, resulting in him being catapulted from the road on to a grass verge.\n\nThe Florida Highway Patrol confirmed no charges have yet been made in relation to the incident, although police are investigating the circumstances in the run-up to the collision.\n\nBest known for movies such as The French Connection in 1971 and Unforgiven in 1992 â both of which he won an Academy Award for â Hackman has received three Oscar nominations and a string of other honours throughout a career that has spanned five decades.\n\nHackman was born in 1930 in California and completed a spell in the US Marines and studied journalism and television production before moving into the acting profession."
