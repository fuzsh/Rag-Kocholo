January 30, 1930) is a retired American actor who portrayed Lex Luthor in Superman: The Movie, Superman II, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, the latter of which he also provided the of voice Nuclear Man for.\n\nPictured: Hackman as Lex Luthor from Superman: The Movie\n\nProfessional History\n\nGene Hackman is a retired American character actor who earned several awards and acted in several movies over the course of a career spanning more than six decades. He won two Academy Awards for his performances in The French Connection and Unforgiven, and was nominated for his roles in Bonnie and Clyde, I Never Sang for My Father, and Mississippi Burning. He also appeared in the highly celebrated films The Conversation and A Bridge Too Far.\n\nIn 1978, Hackman appeared as the villainous Lex Luthor in Richard Donner's Superman: The Movie, although he refused to shave his head to resemble his comic counterpart. The film was a gigantic success both critically and commercially, with Hackman's comedic portrayal of Luthor being widely celebrated. He reprised the role in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, and provided the voice for Nuclear Man in the latter, while Mark Pillow portrayed him on set.\n\nHackman continued to act for several years, appearing in much-loved movies such as Hoosiers, Get Shorty, Enemy of the State, and The Royal Tenenbaums. In 2006, archive footage of him was used in Donner's director's cut of Superman II, and Hackman officially announced his retirement from acting in 2008.\n\nWork History\n\nActing Credits\n\nSuperman December 10, 1978 Lex Luthor\n\nSuperman II December 4, 1980 Lex Luthor\n\nSuperman IV: The Quest for Peace July 24, 1987 Lex Luthor\n\nNuclear Man[1]\n\nGene Hackman at IMDb\n\nGene Hackman at Wikipedia.org"
