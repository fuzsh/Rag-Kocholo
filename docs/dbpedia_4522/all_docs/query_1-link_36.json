He is perhaps best known for the TV series Atlanta (2016–22) and for the music he released under the name Childish Gambino.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nGlover grew up in Stone Mountain, Georgia, where his father was a postal worker and his mother a day-care manager. He had two siblings, and his parents served as foster parents throughout his childhood. After graduating (2002) from DeKalb School of the Arts, he attended New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., 2006). As a student, Glover was a founding member of the sketch comedy group Derrick Comedy, and he also embarked on a rap career. In 2006 he was hired as a writer for Tina Fey’s new sitcom 30 Rock, and he stayed with the show for three seasons, occasionally appearing onscreen as well.\n\nActing, writing, and producing career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 2009 Glover was cast as former high-school sports jock Troy Barnes in the well-received comedy series Community, which centered on a community college. Also that year Derrick Comedy, after several years of creating brief YouTube sketches, released the feature film Mystery Team. In 2010 Glover performed on the stand-up comedy showcase Comedy Central Presents. After Glover left Community in 2014, he appeared in the sci-fi horror film The Lazarus Effect, played a singer in the stripper comedy Magic Mike XXL, and memorably portrayed an astrodynamics scientist in Ridley Scott’s The Martian (all 2015).\n\nThe series Atlanta (2016–22), about an aspiring rap artist, was created, produced, written, and directed by Glover, who also had a starring role. The show, which ran for four seasons, was twice nominated for Emmy Awards for best comedy series, and Glover won an Emmy for acting and another for directing. Following a brief but significant appearance as Aaron Davis in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Glover played Lando Calrissian in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) and voiced Simba in the computer-generated imagery “live-action” version of The Lion King (2019).\n\nIn 2023 Glover reprised his role as Davis in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and served as creator, writer, and producer of the crime TV series Swarm. The latter earned him an Emmy nomination for writing. The following year he starred in a new TV series, Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2024– ), which he created and produced with Francesca Sloane. The series was inspired by the 2005 film about a pair of secret agents who work undercover as a happily married couple. Glover’s upcoming film projects include the prequel Mufasa: The Lion King and the Star Wars spinoff Lando.\n\nChildish Gambino and music career\n\nIn addition to acting, Glover pursued a music career under the name Childish Gambino. His first releases, the mixtapes Sick Boi (2008) and Poindexter (2009), showed a smart and somewhat goofy style. Several more mixtapes followed, notably Culdesac (2010). His major label debut, Camp, appeared in 2011, and it won favorable notice. His second album, Because the Internet (2013), was nominated for a Grammy Award for best rap album, and the single “3005” was also nominated.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He added funk, psychedelia, and soul to his sound for “Awaken, My Love!” (2016), which was nominated not only for best urban contemporary album but also for best album, and the single “Redbone” took home the Grammy for best traditional R&B performance. He debuted “This Is America” during an appearance on Saturday Night Live. The song, which focuses on gun violence and racism, debuted atop the charts in several countries and won four Grammy Awards, including both record and song of the year; Childish Gambino was the first hip-hop artist to win those categories.\n\nGambino’s fourth studio album, 3.15.20 (2020), was also critically praised. However, four years later he reissued the album as Atavista. Along with a shuffled tracklist and a new mix, it featured two new songs and collaborations with pop singer Ariana Grande and composer Ludwig Göransson. Also in 2024, Glover announced a world concert tour to begin later that year and said that he would be retiring the Childish Gambino persona after one final project, Bando Storm and the New World, encompassing a film and soundtrack album. Shortly before the album was released, he explained to the The New York Times his reasons for retiring the moniker: “It really was just like, ‘Oh, it’s done.’ It’s not fulfilling. And I just felt like I didn’t need to build in this way anymore.”\n\nPat Bauer The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
