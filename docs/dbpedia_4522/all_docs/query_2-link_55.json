        "text": "Amid Drake and Kendrick Lamar’s feud, fans are taking a deep dive into the 6 God’s lyrics. Fans believe he hinted at Kendrick Lamar’s alleged infidelity in 2020 through the song “POPSTAR” before he mentioned it again on Drake has claimed that Kendrick’s fiancée, Whitney Alford, has cheated on him with his bodyguard.\n\n“Bodyguards don’t look like Kevin Costner, you tweaking / Just pulled up to Whitney Houston, Texas for the evening,” Drake raps on DJ Khaled’s “POPSTAR.”\n\nDrake brings it up once again on “Push Ups.”\n\n“I be with bodyguards like Whitney,” Drake raps on “Push Ups,” seemingly speaking about Alford’s alleged affair once again. The bars also act as a double entendre since the late Whitney Houston was in the 1992 film The Bodyguard alongside Kevin Costner and their characters had a romantic relationship.\n\n“Don’t speak on the family, crodie/It can get deep in the family, crodie/Talk about me and my family, crodie?/Someone gon’ bleed in your family, crodie,” Kendrick raps.\n\nKendrick Lamar’s Wife’s Alleged Infidelity: Rapper Speaks On His Own Cheating\n\nHowever, when it comes to infidelities, Kendrick has admitted to cheating on Alford in his own music. On “Mother I Sober” from Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers he raps: “Intoxicated, there’s a lustful nature that I failed to mention/Insecurities that I project, sleepin’ with other women/Whitney’s hurt, the pure soul I know, I found her in the kitchen/Askin’ God, ‘Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?'”\n\n“Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, ‘Is there an addiction?’/I said ‘No,’ but this time I lied, I knew that I can’t fix it/Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me/Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy,” he raps.\n\nOn the album, he also mentions it once again on the song “Worldwide Steppers.”\n\n“Next time I f— a white bitch was out in Copenhagen/​good kid, m.A.A.d city tour, I flourished on them stages/Whitney asked did I have a problem, I said, ‘I might be racist’/Ancestors watchin’ me f— was like retaliation.”\n\nKendrick and his fiancée have been together since high school and share two children together — their daughter, Uzi, and their son, Enoch. On the cover of Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, Alford is seen cradling their son on the bed and Kendrick is holding their daughter.\n\nThe couple got engaged in 2015 and while they are notoriously private about their family life, Alford shared a family photo and wrote a heartfelt caption about Kendrick on Father’s Day in 2022.\n\n“I choose to celebrate them for stepping up instead of stepping out, for providing, for assisting us women, for healing, for showing up physically and most importantly for showing up emotionally,” she wrote in part, concluding the caption with, “Happy Father’s Day @kendricklamar.”\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
