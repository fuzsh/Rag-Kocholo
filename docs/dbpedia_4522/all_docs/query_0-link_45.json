        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: The Italian ambassador to Singapore has slammed a local (Singaporean) Italian restaurant for making references to the mafia in an event themed 'Hip Hop Mafioso', calling it \"dubious in taste\".\n\nIn a Facebook posting, Ambassador Dante Brandi addressed the restaurant, Gotti Italiano, and said that the mafia is not something Italy is proud of.\n\n\"Dear Gotti SG, (the) mafia is not what my country is proud of.\n\n\"People have died and suffered because of it and– most importantly– people have died and are still dying and suffering to fight it.\n\n\"Naming your club after an infamous criminal family and catching clients with a 'Hip Hop Mafioso' night is certainly not illegal, but– allow me to say– is definitely of a [sic] dubious taste,\" Brandi continued.\n\nGotti Italiano, which is located on Amoy Street in Singapore's Chinatown, had put up a Facebook post promoting their event called 'Hip Hop Mafioso', planned for March 8. Its promotional poster featured American hip-hop artists Snoop Dogg and Tupac.\n\nThe name 'Gotti' is commonly associated with American crime boss John Gotti, who was the head of the notorious Gambino crime family in New York City.\n\n>hr>\n\nIn 1992, he was convicted of five murders, conspiracy to commit murder, racketeering and extortion, among other crimes. He died in prison in 2002, after being diagnosed with throat cancer.\n\nBrandi then made a reference to a \"real Italian hero\", Judge Giovanni Falcone, who he described as having sacrificed his life to fight the mafia.\n\n\"As a real Italian hero, Judge Giovanni Falcone, a man who has sacrificed his life to fight it, used to say: 'The Italian mafia is not the most dangerous one in the world, but is certainly the one with the vastest literature.'\n\n\"I genuinely believe the world can be spared from your additional literature on the subject,\" he added before signing off his post.\n\nThe restaurant has since apologised, in a comment under Brandi's post.\n\n\"We deeply appreciate your perspective and understand the concerns you've raised regarding our branding and event names,\" said Gotti Italiano, adding that its team has taken down all social media posts promoting the event.\n\n\"(We) are committed to ensuring that our present and future branding and promotional activities will be mindful and respectful to Italian culture and history.\"\n\nBrandi, 52, is a veteran diplomat who assumed his Singapore posting on Sept 1, 2023. Additionally, he serves as Italy's Ambassador to Brunei and previously held the position of Consul General of Italy in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam which he was appointed to in 2018.\n\nSome of his previous posts include serving as the Italian embassy's chief of staff in Washington DC, heading the economic-commercial office of the Italian embassy in London, and acting as the deputy executive director for Italy at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development."
