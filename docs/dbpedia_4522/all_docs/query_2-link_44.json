        "text": "2:11 PMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DFLoN3JosA\n\nChancelor Bennett can’t lose. For his latest trick, he’s teamed with Nike and director Hiro Murai for a new song and video titled “Unlimited Together.” According to the company, it “celebrates the strength of unity and power of team.” Aside from that, it’s just cool.\n\nFocusing on the U.S. men’s and women’s basketball teams, we see a series of images projected on to buildings while Chance sings and raps over an inspirational piano-led track. It’s vintage uplifting music from the Chicago artist and if you’re the type who’s super into fist pumping for the red, white and blue every two years in the Olympics, this is a song for you. The choice of black and white as a color scheme makes this a particularly powerful visual.\n\nWhile you’re at it, you might want to check out some more items from Nike’s Unlimited series, which have been dropping all summer.\n\n5:18 PMFresh from last week’s National Association of Black Journalists convention, the All Day Podcast crew — host Clinton Yates, staff writer Justin Tinsley and senior style writer Jill Hudson — were back in action in the studio Tuesday to discuss a plethora of topics, as well as debut a new segment.\n\nIt’s Water Week at the Undefeated, so for the next few days we’ll tackle the topic of water and swimming in black culture. In honor of the week, Justin wrote this piece on his near-death experience at the pool when he was a teenager. He goes into further detail about the story on the podcast, accompanied by thoughts from Clinton and Jill on what swimming has meant to them over their lifetimes.\n\nThe discussion heats up surrounding the topics of 29-year-old rapper Bow Wow’s retirement announcement and the news of 49-year-old R&B artist R. Kelly’s relationship with a 19-year-old woman. One member of the crew respects R. Kelly’s music, but can no longer listen to it given the artist’s perplexing past.\n\nLast but certainly not least, a new segment titled Missed Connections with Miss Karin debuts this week, in which Undefeated copy chief Karin Berry reads entries from the “Missed Connections” section of Craigslist.org and provides her own commentary. Keep a lookout for this segment on future podcasts.\n\nGive it a listen, and if you have any feedback or show ideas, feel free to email us at allday@andscape.com.\n\n5:09 PMOne is a total of 90 seconds and the other is 165 seconds. In the past two days, we’ve been blessed with two teaser releases from a couple of very anticipated television series. First up is Donald Glover’s Atlanta, set to debut on FX on Sept. 9. The second is Netflix’s Luke Cage, which drops on Sept. 20.\n\nWe’ll start with Glover’s opus, first. The series was greenlighted after his second studio album Because The Internet received a nod for best rap album at the 2015 Grammy Awards. After writing for 30 Rock, and appearing in The Martian following his ascent to a household name on NBC’s Community, things came together.\n\n“I mean, it’s not a coincidence I got my pilot right after I got a Grammy nomination,” Glover told Grantland last year. “You think the people were like, ‘Wait, what? He got a Grammy, too?’ It’s harder to turn down a Grammy guy who also writes. I know I’m in a unique position. So I take that very seriously. That’s the thing, it isn’t for naught.”\n\nWith that backdrop, along with his penchant for drawing vastly different reactions out of people for his wide array of skills, this show will likely be highly anticipated among a certain creative class. Aside from rapping, acting and stand-up comedy, he’ll occasionally drop a randomly glorious R&B cover or release an eerily esoteric short film that feels like it could be completely autobiographical or not at all.\n\nThat said, this new show looks like something in-between that promises to fit the network’s largely darker drama tone. On Monday, six new 15-second trailers named Close Calls, Curry, Deja Vu, Alive, Hard Day and Work released. Earlier this summer, the network had released four other trailers, titled Walk, Flyers, Porch and Wake Up. Glover’s series looks gritty, while somewhat melodic and ultimately funny. Directed by Hiro Murai, Glover plays an up-and-coming rapper. That song you hear is Tame Impala’s New Person, Same Old Mistakes.\n\nSo far, the series has been picked up for 10 episodes.\n\n9:25 AMA cool thing happened when I was in Connecticut. I ran into the All-Star team from my kid brother’s old Little League in the hotel. The team was playing the next day, so I went and checked it out. Fun game. Got the win.\n\nPolls are a tricky matter in politics. On the one hand, they’re one of the best ways we have to give the rest of the country any sort of indication of where things stand among presidential candidates. On the other hand, the math and science they use is not exactly airtight. Then, you have people who don’t understand how they work at all, and claim that if results deviate from the polls, then everything is somehow rigged. FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten breaks down how they aren’t skewed this year, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is just really skewed.\n\nBeyond the sports, the Olympics have a ton of random features that you’d never know of unless you were there. One of those things is hospitality houses. Certain nations and companies set up side luxury sites, so that outside of the Olympic Village, athletes, their families and other VIPs have a place to chill, away from the apparently overly dangerous towns of, you know, the host nation. Anyway, while first designed to be a sort of gimmicky perk, they’ve evolved into behemoth operations. VICE Sports‘ Aaron Gordon reports.\n\nThe history of hip-hop has become its own big business. The unsealing of archives, creation of documentaries and serializing of origin stories have grown from what it once was, just a cottage industry for nostalgists. The Get Down is a new series from Netflix, created by Baz Luhrmann, that will explore what New York in the late ’70s was like. If you’re wondering how authentic this drama series is going to be, Nas wrote all the raps. Check out this interview with Grandmaster Flash about the series that launches Friday.\n\nIt’s official, Paul Pogba is headed back to Manchester United from Juventus. The well-coiffed Frenchman’s return to the English Premier League drew a record transfer fee of $116.4 million. What’s funny is that the announcement, which was long in the works, was leaked by rapper Stormzy, who is a huge Red Devils fan. So, instead of the usual pomp and circumstance, it happened in the dark of British night. Anyway, the midfielder’s signing is obviously the biggest news of the offseason. ESPN’s Arindam Rej reports.\n\nFree Food\n\nCoffee Break: If you think income inequality isn’t real, you’d be very, very wrong. It’s hard for some people to understand a world in which at least something isn’t passed from generation to generation. But this report says it would take more than two centuries for black people to catch up to white American families.\n\nSnack Time: When you play in the NBA, you get used to certain things. Like constantly having fresh towels and people at your beck and call. Team USA’s Paul George forgot where he was for a second while in Rio, haha.\n\nDessert: Here’s Usain Bolt dancing. It’s as good as you think it’ll be.\n\n6:11 PMWould you attend a dinner party hosted by two ex-convicts? What if the dinner party was on television and those two hosts were Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart?\n\nAs crazy as it sounds, the weirdest pair of former felons friends is making it happen. On Monday, VH1 announced a new, and unscripted, series set to premiere this fall starring the 44-year-old rapper and 75-year-old businesswoman and TV personality, titled Martha & Snoop’s Dinner Party.\n\n“At our dinner party, we will exemplify America’s fascination with food, entertaining and celebrity,” Stewart said. “Martha & Snoop’s Dinner Party will redesign the traditional food competition shows in a new, different and very funny way.”\n\nCheck out the promotional video the duo released on Good Morning America on Monday:\n\nFor some, the pairing of these two celebrities for a series that each week will produce “a half-baked evening of cocktails, cooking, conversation and fun where nothing is off-limits” might seem random. Those people, however, clearly don’t know Martha and Snoop. Oddly enough, these two celebrities are very close. And perhaps their most apparent commonality is the fact that both have had run-ins with the law over the years.\n\nSnoop Dogg has a long criminal history dating back to shortly after his high school days in the ’90s when he was arrested for drug possession, forcing him to spend the three years in and out of prison. In 2004, Stewart was sentenced to serve five months in federal prison surrounding an insider trading scandal.\n\nWhen the media mogul was released and made her comeback in 2005, her pal Snoop Dogg was there for her — especially when the cameras were rolling. Snoop appeared on Stewart’s cooking show in 2008 to make mashed potatoes. The two were also guests on Comedy Central’s Roast of Justin Bieber in 2015 and recently went on ABC’s game show $100,000 Pyramid together.\n\nThey even made brownies on her cooking show once, too.\n\nMaybe those brownies will reappear at these dinner parties. And maybe they’ll include Uncle Snoop’s secret “ingredients.”\n\n“Martha is smoking in the kitchen,” Snoop says in the promotional video, ” … and she can cook, too.”\n\nGood thing those “ingredients” are legal now. Don’t want to risk any more jail time!\n\n2:45 PMLong before guys were accidentally walking into Brazilian brothels and inadvertently posting pictures of their anatomy to social media, there was a group of 12 basketball players that tore through the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, with a vengeance we’d never seen before. On Aug. 8, 1992, the U.S. Olympic men’s basketball team, known as “The Dream Team,” won gold. They smashed Croatia, 117-85, capping off the tournament run.\n\nThese days, anything less that a beatdown from the Americans is considered an embarrassment. Watching them play is borderline not fun, because there’s really no competition. But back in the ’90s, we were really here to watch the Chuck Daly-coached team run roughshod all over the world. And their uniforms are still some of the most fire this country has ever seen.\n\nThe most important thing about that tournament is that it definitely redefined the concept of success for a program that had quite a few ups and down in its history. In 1988, the team had won only the bronze medal in Seoul, South Korea, under head coach John Thompson. It would be the last time the United States did not field a team with NBA players.\n\nIn 2004, under Larry Brown — a squad featuring Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury, Tim Duncan and a young LeBron James — the Americans finished third again. Then, USA Basketball decided it was time to rethink things altogether. Duke University men’s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski took over, and after a rocky start in the 2006 FIBA World Championship (bronze), the team got things back on track with two straight gold medals at the Olympics.\n\nDespite stories of late-night gambling and all-night parties from the ’90s in Spain — in an era when that kind of info wasn’t going to be leaked nor get anyone in trouble — it was a time when playing for your country meant a lot to everyone on the team. Losing was not an option, and the players who were famously left off the team (Isiah Thomas and Shaquille O’Neal) still don’t like talking about it much, because of the bitterness.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, though, this team jump-started the globalization of the game on another level. Everyone saw the likes of Michael Jordan in his prime alongside Earvin “Magic” Johnson and an aging Larry Bird, all doing their thing. By the time the next Olympics came around, it was clear what happened.\n\nThe 1992 Dream Team was iconic not just for Americans, but the entire world, too.\n\n10:11 AMHappy Monday, gang. I got to do some radio Sunday night. ESPN’s Aaron Boone and Raul Ibanez joined me to talk about the legacies of both Ichiro Suzuki and Alex Rodriguez. If you want to listen, here you go.\n\nWhat is the NFL doing with all that money it has? Because game-day operations don’t appear to be getting any cash funneled their way. In a bizarre sequence of events, the league canceled Sunday’s Hall Of Fame Game, because of poor field conditions. I’ve pretty much never heard of that happening, but apparently there were problems with the paint for the midfield crest, that just made things too unsafe. It seems that, depending on the issue, player safety really is a concern for the NFL. The Associated Press’ Barry Wilner reports.\n\nThe first family is officially on vacation. The Obamas are in Martha’s Vineyard for the next two weeks, for their final break while in the White House. If you recall, Sasha recently got a job there at a local restaurant. You know how when you used to work someplace and your parents or your friends would come in and eat or order something? Mainly to show support but most to embarrass you, to a certain extent? Imagine that scene with the president waltzing in to pick up a fish sandwich. Alas, we won’t get that pleasure, but hopefully they all find a way to relax.\n\nBernie Sanders’ supporters are really not giving in. The people who support the senator from Vermont are doing everything they can to make sure that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has major issues. Many of them have no plan to show solidarity with the Democratic Party, even though Sanders himself has implored them to. Whether or not this will have a significant impact on the general election, we don’t know. But according to FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten, it appears that a least a third of Sanders’ supporters are not switching allegiance.\n\nSomething really wild happened in Rio on Sunday. The Williams sisters lost a tennis match. That’s something that had never happened before in Olympic history. Not only did they lose, but it happened in the first round. They fell to the Czech Republic’s Lucie Safarova and Barbora Strycova, not a particularly noteworthy pair. Venus also lost in the first round on the singles side. That means that Serena in singles is the only one in her family left. You’ve got to wonder if this is the beginning of the end, to some degree for their doubles career.\n\nFree Food\n\nCoffee Break: If you’ve ever seen The Eric Andre Show, you know that it’s basically a completely ridiculous, marginally scripted cacophony of jokes and destruction. So when the notoriously serious rapper T.I. showed up for the season four premiere, my man wasn’t ready for the foolishness.\n\nSnack Time: Reading letters to the editor is a great way to understand an audience. Every once in a while you get one that’s so on point that it needs to be shared. Such is the case with this writer, who completely nailed it.\n\nDessert: Hope your summer workout plans are going well. This guy’s are always on point.\n\n7:00 AM\n\nThe nature of street art is temporary, by design. You paint something on a wall. Eventually, someone paints over it. The time of its existence is part and parcel with the satisfaction of the experience of creating it and looking at it. So when a provocative piece goes up, there’s the chance that someone either complains or buffs it entirely. In the case of Lushsux, an Australian artist, both ended up happening.\n\nEarlier this week, a mural of Hillary Clinton in a bikini that was designed after an American flag made a lot of noise. On the surface, the so-called shock value was obvious. Of course, local government complained, so the artist made an adjustment. He covered her in a niqab. Smart, no? Makes a good point about how ridiculous not only censorship is, but particularly in the case of allowing women to be themselves. A provocative mural doubled down.\n\nThen, guess what? He had to cover it up altogether. The council deemed it sexist. According to the National Post, he answered back on social media. “This is no longer a wall of a supposed ‘offensive and near naked’ Hillary Clinton, it is now a depiction of a beautiful Muslim woman. No reasonable person would consider this offensive,” the artist wrote in a post.\n\nAlas.\n\n12:00 PMKendrick Lamar, Kanye West, Chance The Rapper and Drake.\n\nThis year in the hip-hop world, those four rappers have been dominating the conversation. However, while those artists have been the center of attention, Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz has quietly been having a strong year.\n\n2 Chainz has had a busy 2016, to say the least. In January, the Atlanta rapper released a short, six-song project titled Felt Like Cappin. Then in March, he followed it up with COLLEGROVE, a more commercial collab album with Lil Wayne.\n\nOn Thursday night, fans were anxiously waiting for Frank Ocean and Travis Scott to release their projects (which they didn’t). While they were waiting, 2 Chainz decided to bless the internet with a 10-track mixtape titled Daniel Son; Necklace Don.\n\nAccording to his Twitter account, the new project was released early by 2 Chainz to beat the bootleggers to the punch.\n\nThe drop came to the joy of 2 Chainz fans everywhere.\n\nWhile people have been waiting a long time for this new Frank Ocean project (sorry Rhiannon), this is the third 2 Chainz project in just this year alone. Say what you want about El Chapo Jr., but the man delivers.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MR_BCB/status/761422391645962240\n\nhttps://twitter.com/daddyszn/status/761415523632635904\n\nYes, 2 Chainz songs haven’t been dominating the radio like he did in 2011-2012. But the man is still putting out bangers for the whip and has one of the funniest Youtube video series of all time.\n\nWill we get a Frank Ocean or Travis Scott project soon? Only time will tell. But for now, 2 Chainz got us.\n\nTRU.\n\n10:11 AMWilliam Rhoden is great, and Thursday night at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention I was more than honored to moderate a panel for a great film, Olympic Pride, American Injustice, with him and director Deborah Riley Draper. Most fun I’ve had in a long while.\n\nYou want a real hardcore look at what our justice system is? Go no further than Dylann Roof. The white supremacist kid that walked into a Charleston, South Carolina, church and opened fire after a prayer meeting, then got to eat fast food courtesy of the police. Yeah, well, he’s trying to get off from the death penalty by arguing that it’s unconstitutional, as cruel and unusual punishment. You don’t say. Also, some guy assaulted Roof in jail Thursday and people are giving him money for it.\n\nThe Donald Trump circus continues into the weekend. For his latest trick, the Republican presidential nominee is now describing things he’s never seen to wide audiences, claiming to have a firm grasp on their belongings. If you weren’t aware, the United States of America occasionally drops straight-up cash payments on people to settle scores. It’s kind of obnoxious but also respectable at the same time, lest you divest yourself from the reasons why it’s happening, which is near impossible. Anyway, the last time it happened, Trump didn’t see a video of the transaction. But, he says he did. Or something.\n\nFull disclosure: Watching bears eat fish is a favorite pastime of mine. Seriously, I’ve got these live cams on deck of these ursine creatures standing in moving water and trying to snag these salmon. It’s one of the most bizarrely therapeutic, circle of life type things you can do. (If you’re counting, this is day two of bear news on this blog.) ANYWAY, here’s a question for you, in the form of a riddle from FiveThirtyEight’s Oliver Roeder. Should the grizzly bear eat the salmon?\n\nBy the way, the Olympics “start” Friday. I say that in such a way because multiple events have already gotten underway, but the opening ceremonies aren’t until Friday night. This is the part where I remind you that the person who popularized the Olympic march is a guy who also thought that genocide made sense. Yes, it was Adolf Hitler and the Nazis who created this tradition, so just think about that when you’re watching your favorite athletes parade through Rio de Janeiro. Also, here’s a great story about what athletes do with their medals after winning.\n\nFree Food\n\nCoffee Break: This isn’t “news” in the truest sense of the word, but it’s worth noting that rapper Snoop Dogg is producing a new television series about two women who run a weed delivery service in California. Snoop, please never stop being you.\n\nSnack Time: I’ve got a buddy who lives in Hong Kong. He’s the one who got married in Italy, which is why I was there. When I finally go visit him, I’ll stop at his place first. Then, I’m immediately going to this joint. Obviously.\n\nDessert: It’s the weekend. And Miguel’s got a new track out. You’re welcome."
