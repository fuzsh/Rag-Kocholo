        "text": "Snoop Dogg has appeared to confirm the release date for Mount Westmore’s debut album.\n\nREAD MORE: Snoop Dogg – ‘Algorithm’ review: Snoop’s shot at making old-school hip-hop great again\n\nThe rapper, who is in the supergroup with E-40, Too $hort and Ice Cube, shared a video via his Instagram that shows the bandmembers performing live with a new song soundtracking the montage. In a caption, he wrote: “June 7th. The wait is over. BadMFs. @mtwestmore.”\n\nThis means that Mount Westmore’s debut album will finally reach fans this Tuesday (June 7), more than a year on from the group’s formation.\n\nSnoop’s reference to “BadMFs” could mean it’s the album title. A song of the same name was released in March, following on from the previously shared songs ‘Big Subwoofer‘ and ‘Step Child’ in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with HotNewHipHop last year, Snoop said of the project: “You bring the legends of the West Coast together, something great will always happen.\n\n“Cube, 40, Short, and I have been running the game for years. This is the perfect time because each of us brings authentic and new ideas to the table. All four together? That’s magic.”\n\nRecommended\n\nLast March, Too $hort revealed that Mount Westmore had “recorded somewhere in the neighbourhood of 50 songs”.\n\n“At the age we’re at is a good time to do a thing like this and kind of extend your career a bit in a different way,” he said. “The minute we join forces, we get a handful of new business opportunities that none of us would’ve had.”\n\nMeanwhile, Snoop has cancelled all his non-US shows for the remainder of 2022 due to “unforeseen scheduling conflicts, including family obligations and upcoming tv and film projects”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat means that his upcoming ‘I Wanna Thank Me’ tour that was set to hit the UK in August is no longer going ahead."
