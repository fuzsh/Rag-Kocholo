        "text": "Snoop Dogg recently went off in a video that he shared on Instagram regarding unidentified booking agents who the veteran rapper accuses of racism.\n\n“I’m about to put some words out about some punk a– motherf—ing agents in the music industry who don’t want to see a black man win as a booking agent,” Snoop said in the video. “I’ll be giving up names real soon and what company they’re with.”\n\nSnoop then insinuated that the reason said agents don’t want to work with him is because he’s connected to Latinos.\n\n“You punk motherf—ers don’t want to see a n—– win because I’m connected with somebody that’s of a different ethnicity. Because I have a Mexican, a Latino working with me. It’s black and brown and y’all don’t want to see that,” Snoop Dogg continued.\n\n“F— y’all system motherf—ers. I’m sick of this sh–. Any artist that’s tired of being f—ed over by these punk motherf—ers. Holler at Snoop Dogg and Uncle Snoop’s Army and Bobby D! ASAP!”\n\nIn the comment section of Snoop’s post, he also tagged Drake and wrote,”holla at me.”\n\nGlennisha Morgan is a Detroit-bred multimedia journalist and writer.
