        "text": "Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman (pronounced \"beau-yer\") is most recognizable for his portrayal of ambitious producer Jay in the Peabody Award-winning and Emmy-nominated Lifetime series UNREAL, which will return for its third season February 26. That same day, Bowyer-Chapman will launch and host an episodic conversational podcast series entitled JBC PRESENTS: CONVERSATIONS WITH \"OTHERS.\" In partnering with the producer of the hit podcast RUPAUL: WHAT'S THE TEE, he will explore the concept of \"otherness\" and finding the strength and beauty in our differences and connectivity.\n\nIn 2016, the Hollywood Reporter declared Bowyer-Chapman one of Canada's top rising stars. That year, he co-starred opposite Robert De Niro and Zac Efron in the comedy DIRTY GRANDPA and filmed the indie feature TAO OF SURFING, alongside Eric Balfour and Lou Diamond Phillips. In Spring 2017, he co-starred in the Lifetime original movie LOVE BY THE 10TH DATE, alongside Kelly Rowland and Meagan Good. To much fanfare, he also appeared as a guest judge on RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE, a role in which he reprised this current season in the series' 'ALL STAR' edition.\n\nBowyer-Chapman began his career as an international model before making his feature film debut in SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM, which premiered at the 2006 Outfest Film Festival. In 2012, he starred opposite Jussie Smollett in LOGO's romantic comedy-drama THE SKINNY. Additional credits include his critically-acclaimed breakthrough performance in HBO's DEAR MR. GACY, SyFy's STARGATE UNIVERSE and the Nickelodeon animated series IRON MAN: ARMORED ADVENTURES, in which he voiced the role of the iconic superhero Black Panther.\n\nBowyer-Chapman is passionately involved with the Human Rights Campaign, for which he serves as a guest speaker. In 2016, he created the Bramon Garcia Braun (BGB) scholarship in his name, awarded to LGTBQ actors of color with a fierce desire to explore and express what is unique about them through their acting and the leadership and generosity to use their talent to change the industry's often limited perception of humanity. Born and raised in Canada, Bowyer-Chapman currently splits his time between New York and Los Angeles.\n\nDwayne Douglas Johnson, also known as The Rock, was born on May 2, 1972 in Hayward, California. He is the son of Ata Johnson (born Feagaimaleata Fitisemanu) and professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles). His father, from Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada, is black (of Black Nova Scotian descent), and his mother is of Samoan background (her own father was Peter Fanene Maivia, also a professional wrestler). While growing up, Dwayne traveled around a lot with his parents and watched his father perform in the ring. During his high school years, Dwayne began playing football and he soon received a full scholarship from the University of Miami, where he had tremendous success as a football player. In 1995, Dwayne suffered a back injury which cost him a place in the NFL. He then signed a three-year deal with the Canadian League but left after a year to pursue a career in wrestling.\n\nHe made his wrestling debut in the USWA under the name Flex Kavanah where he won the tag team championship with Brett Sawyer. In 1996, Dwayne joined the WWE and became Rocky Maivia where he joined a group known as \"The Nation of Domination\" and turned heel. Rocky eventually took over leadership of the \"Nation\" and began taking the persona of The Rock. After the \"Nation\" split, The Rock joined another elite group of wrestlers known as the \"Corporation\" and began a memorable feud with Steve Austin. Soon the Rock was kicked out of the \"Corporation\". He turned face and became known as \"The Peoples Champion\". In 2000, the Rock took time off from WWE to film his appearance in Die Mumie kehrt zurück (2001). He returned in 2001 during the WCW/ECW invasion where he joined a team of WWE wrestlers at The Scorpion King (2002), a prequel to Die Mumie kehrt zurück (2001).\n\nDwayne has a daughter, Simone Alexandra Johnson, born in 2001, with his ex-wife Dany Garcia, and daughters, Jasmine, born in 2015, and Tiana Gia, born in 2018, with his wife, singer and songwriter Lauren Hashian.\n\nAn only child, Idrissa Akuna Elba was born and raised in London, England. His father, Winston, is from Sierra Leone and worked at Ford Dagenham; his mother, Eve, is from Ghana and had a clerical duty. Idris attended school in Canning Town, where he first became involved in acting, before he dropped out. He gained a place in the National Youth Music Theatre - thanks to a £1,500 Prince's Trust grant. To support himself between acting roles, he worked in jobs such as tyre-fitting, cold call advertising sales, and working night shifts at Ford Dagenham. He worked in nightclubs under the nickname DJ Big Driis at age 19, but began auditioning for television roles in his early-twenties.\n\nHis first acting roles were on the soap opera Family Affairs (1997), the television serial Ultraviolet (1998), and the medical drama Polizeiarzt Dangerfield (1995). His best known roles are as drug baron Russell \"Stringer\" Bell on the HBO series The Wire (2002), as DCI John Luther on the BBC One series Luther (2010), and as Heimdall in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He later starred in the films Daddy's Little Girls (2007), Prom Night: Eine gute Nacht zum Sterben (2008), RocknRolla (2008), The Unborn (2009) and Obsessed (2009). He also appeared in the films American Gangster (2007), Takers - The Final Job (2010), Thor (2011), Prometheus - Dunkle Zeichen (2012), Pacific Rim (2013), Thor: The Dark Kingdom (2013), Beasts of No Nation (2015) and Star Trek Beyond (2016). He voiced Chief Bogo in Zoomania (2016), Shere Khan in The Jungle Book (2016), and Fluke in Findet Dorie (2016).\n\nIdris Elba was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2016 New Years Honours for his services to drama.\n\nRochelle Aytes was born in New York City. She attended LaGuardia High School and graduated with a Bachelor's of Fine Arts degree in Dance from SUNY Purchase College Conservatory for Dance. She is best-known for her role in White Chicks (2004) as Denise Porter; her role in Left 4 Dead 2 (2009) as a news producer; and more recently in the TV series The Forgotten - Die Wahrheit stirbt nie (2009) as Detective Grace Russell, who teams up with a volunteer group, including a former Chicago police detective played by Christian Slater, to solve cases of missing or unidentified homicide victims. Rochelle also played Lisa Breaux in Tyler Perry's Das verrückte Familienfest (2006), in which she plays a woman who is caught in a relationship in which her fiancé (Blair Underwood) beats and threatens her.\n\nIn 2006, She played Nicole Jamieson in the test pilot of Tyler Perry's House of Payne (2006). In 2007 she guest-starred in the hit Fox series Bones: Die Knochenjägerin (2005) as Felicia Saroyan, the sister of lab supervisor Cam. She also played Leigh Barnthouse in the Fox series Drive (2007). In 2009 she played Tara Kole in the CBS TV show Navy CIS (2003) and had a role in the independent film Trick 'r Treat - Die Nacht der Schrecken (2007). In 2010 she played Eva in the hit TNT series Dark Blue (2009). In 2011 she had a recurring role in the ABC series Detroit 1-8-7 (2010) as prosecutor Alice Williams, until her character was murdered in the 1-11-2011 episode \"Key to the City.\" She also plays the part of Amber James, the former girlfriend of Keith Watson, on ABC's Desperate Housewives (2004).\n\nShe is represented by Ryan Daly of Zero Gravity Management.\n\nThe multi-talented Donald Glover is a writer, actor, musician, comedian, producer and director, who performs under the stage names Childish Gambino and mcDJ. He was born Donald McKinley Glover at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and was raised in Stone Mountain, Georgia. His mother, Beverly (Smith), ran a daycare center, and his father, Donald Glover, is a retired postal worker. He is not, despite rumors, related to actor Danny Glover. He has a younger brother, Stephen Glover, a screenwriter and producer. Donald graduated from New York University with a degree in Dramatic Writing in 2006.\n\nIn 2006, at age 23, while still living in the NYU dorms, Glover joined the writing staff of NBC comedy 30 Rock (2006), for which he received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination in 2009. Later credited as an executive story editor, he also had several cameos in front of the camera. In 2009, he left \"30 Rock\" for a role on the comedy series Community (2009), in which he played an athlete in a rather odd study group, opposite Chevy Chase and Joel McHale. The show ran for six seasons.\n\nGlover is the creator, writer, producer, director and star of the series Atlanta (2016), which debuted on FX in 2016. The series was an immediate critical and commercial hit, winning the 2017 Golden Globe Award for Best Series and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series (Musical or Comedy) for Glover. At the 2017 Primetime Emmy Awards, Glover won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, while the show also earned four other nominations: Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for Glover (for the episode B.A.N. (2016)) and his brother, Stephen (for the episode Streets on Lock (2016)).\n\nHis first stand-up special aired on Comedy Central in March 2010. As Childish Gambino, Glover has released the studio albums \"Camp\" (2011), \"Because the Internet\" (2013) and \"Awaken, My Love!\" (2016). In 2015, he was nominated for Grammy Awards in 2015 for Best Rap Album for \"Because the Internet\" and Best Rap Performance for his single \"3005\" In 2018, he was nominated for five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year for \"Awaken, My Love!\" and Record of the Year for the hit \"Redbone,\" winning the Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance.\n\nOn the big screen, Glover's credits include Magic Mike XXL (2015), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), and Der Marsianer: Rettet Mark Watney (2015). He will star as the young Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) and will provide the voice of Simba in a remake of Der König der Löwen (2019).\n\nIn April 2017, Glover was named among Time Magazine's \"100 Most Influential People in the World.\"\n\nPerry was born and raised in New Orleans, to Willie Maxine (Campbell) and Emmitt Perry, Sr. His mother was a church-goer and took Perry along with her once a week. His father was a carpenter and they had a very strained and abusive relationship, which led Perry to suffer from depression as a teenager.\n\nIn 1991, he was working an office job, when he saw an episode of Die Oprah Winfrey Show (1986) discussing the therapeutic nature of writing. This inspired him to begin writing and he worked through his bad experiences by writing letters to himself. He adapted his letters into a play, \"I Know I've Changed\", about domestic abuse. Unfortunately, after renting a theater in Atlanta to put on the play, he failed to attract audiences.\n\nHe took on a series of odd jobs and found himself living in his car. But, in 1998, he was given a second chance to stage his play and, this time, he was more business-savvy with his marketing. The play was sold-out and drew attention from investors.\n\nTyler has gone on to established a successful career as a writer, director and producer for stage, television and film.\n\nBorn in Kansas City, Missouri on September 19, 1982, Columbus Keith Short, Jr., started entertaining at the age of three, by putting on shows for his folks' enjoyment. Whether impersonating relatives, dancing or just making people laugh, everyone sensed something special about the boy. Fortunately, his family later relocated to Los Angeles where, by his early teens. His mother, Janette, runs a talent agency there.\n\nColumbus landed work in such television commercial campaigns as \"Mountain Dew\", \"Denny's Restaurant\", \"Nike\" and \"Pizza Hut\", to name a few. As a senior in high school, he was offered an opportunity to graduate two months early in order to see the world with the traveling production of the Broadway show, \"Stomp!\" And, after a couple of years on the road with that famed dance troop, he would parlay his professional success into a stint as the choreographer of Britney Spears' \"In the Zone\" tour. Though a very versatile Renaissance Man who is also a writer, musician and director, Columbus came off the road to pursue his primary passion, namely, acting. His motion picture credits include Street Style (2004), Krieg der Welten (2005), Save the Last Dance 2 (2006). In addition, he has guest-starred on TV shows like Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), Für alle Fälle Amy (1999) and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2006). But, his big break arrived earlier this year, when he played the lead role of \"DJ\" in Stomp the Yard (2007), which was #1 at the box office two weeks in a row and grossed over $73.4 million. Now one of the most-sought emerging talents in Hollywood, Columbus can next be seen in a lead role, alongside Lauren London and Mekhi Phifer, in a holiday film called This Christmas (2007). Furthermore, he recently wrapped a starring role in the Warner Brothers thriller, Whiteout (2009), opposite Kate Beckinsale. When not working, Columbus loves football, basketball and snowboarding."
