        "text": "Here’s a fact. People rarely give male dogs human names like Robert, Michael or Brad. Those names are too normal, especially if the dog in question is the canine equivalent of a superhero or master detective. If you have a quirky dog, then it’s likely that you can relate. Creating a unique name for your dog with a unique personality is one way to feel more connected with your dog.\n\nThe truth is if your dog is a character, then he might as well be named after a true character. This is especially true if you’d like to turn your Fido into a character in a book created just for you by Petventures. If you love this idea, continue reading to gather some more boy names for dogs.\n\nP.S. If you want to see more pet names, stories of pets, or share your pet's story check out our free Facebook group!\n\nEvery dog has an individual personality, and naming your dog based off of who he is, can improve your relationship with him. For example, if your dog is extraordinary, consider natural phenomena like hurricanes and comets. These can provide great inspiration for boy names for dogs. Nature is always constant. It was here before humans appeared on earth, and it will be here when there are no more humans on the earth. Therefore, natural phenomena suggest character traits, such as strong, secure, and constant. Having these traits, it has always made them logical choices for dog names, particularly if your pup is spirited.\n\nSometimes thinking out of the box, is going to be what catapults you into discovering the perfect name for man’s best friend. For example, Hawk or Bear can evoke the names of the powerful animals in their environment. One of these nature-inspired names is bound to be right for your dog.\n\nStorm\n\nForest\n\nBear\n\nHawk\n\nAsh\n\nDusty\n\nRain\n\nWinter/ Wynter\n\nRoan\n\nHalley (after Halley’s Comet)\n\nRohan (Inspired by \"Lord of the Rings\")"
