        "text": "In advance of the new season of Game of Thrones, HBO will release a sequel to last year's Game of Thrones-themed mixtape, Catch the Throne. Catch the Throne: The Mixtape Vol. 2 features new music from Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Anthrax, Killswitch Engage, and Yandel. Each of the mix's 15 traks samples music used in the fourth season of the show. It will be released for free sometime in March and was produced by Launch Point Records.\n\n\"Off the top, I love *Game of Thrones—*I even gave my expert analysis of this season on my GGN show,\" said Snoop Dogg in the press release. \"It’s like the rap game, it's gangster, about family, loyalty and trying to get to the top. I had to get involved. Give the fans a little bit of how I see it.”\n\nWatch the trailer for Game of Thrones' fifth season, below. It begins on April 12."
