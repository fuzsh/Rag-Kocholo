        "text": "By Anna Garrison\n\nUpdated Feb. 16 2024, 6:56 p.m. ET\n\nTo many, the name Snoop Dogg is synonymous with good times and legendary music. Snoop, real name Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr., has been making waves in the music industry since his career beginnings in 1993.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHis extensive career has led to no less than 17 solo albums and many awards. Snoop is related to several other famous industry musicians like Brandy Norwood, but who are his siblings?\n\nRead on to find out everything we know about Snoop Dogg's siblings ‚Äî as well as some other famous names he's related to.\n\nSnoop Dogg has two half-siblings.\n\nReportedly, Snoop has two half-siblings, both brothers. His older brother Jerry Wesley Carter is an employee of United Steel Workers. Jerry is Snoop's half-brother through his mother's side. There aren't many photos of the two brothers together, but Jerry does make the occasional appearance on Snoop's Instagram page.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSnoop's second brother (also through his mother's side) is younger sibling Bing Worthington Jr. Bing sadly passed away in February of 2024, at the age of 44. Snoop remembered his brother in a series of heartfelt Instagram posts. In one caption, Snoop said Bing \"always made us laugh üíôüôèüèæüò¢ u bac with moms.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBing was a businessman who spent a lot of time in the background of Snoop's work. The entrepreneur had been his brother's tour manager, created music of his own, and in 2016, merged music labels Dogg Records with Canadian label Urban Heat Legends.\n\nBing was good friends with Urban Heat Legends owner Miguel Lopez.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDuring an interview with Vice, Bing elaborated on his many business ventures, both in collaboration with his brother and without. Bing explained, \"I started from the bottom, I ain‚Äôt just become the tour manager, I was just the road guy. I worked my way to the top. Even though I‚Äôm [Snoop's] brother he didn‚Äôt give me a top-ranked position. You can‚Äôt just become a president without knowing anything about being the president. You have to learn.\"\n\nSnoop's family is very close-knit, and it's clear that both of his brothers worked hard to achieve their goals. All three siblings spent a lot of time with their mother, Beverly Tate. Snoop's mother passed away in 2021, at the age of 70.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSnoop is also related to several other famous stars.\n\nSeveral of Snoop's cousins have also made names for themselves in the music industry. His most famous cousins include Brandy Norwood, Ray J, Daz Dillinger, WWE star Sasha Banks, Nate Dogg, and RBX.\n\nSnoop has also collaborated with many of his famous relatives on various projects. Snoop and Daz Dillinger (real name Delmar Drew Arnaud) rose to fame together with the creation of Death Row Records.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSadly, Nate Dogg passed away in 2011, but not before he and Snoop collaborated on rap group 213. Snoop also has a tattoo of his late cousin on his arm, with the phrase \"All dogs go to heaven\" in honor of their shared moniker. The group was effectively disbanded after Nate's passing, but their music will remain a lasting tribute to his legacy.\n\nSnoop Dogg has a large family, and it seems that family is important to him. He spends time with his loved ones whenever he possibly can."
