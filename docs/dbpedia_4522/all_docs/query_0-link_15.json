        "text": "Three decades ago, hip-hop made a turn from the underground to commercial fanfare. The eclectic sensibilities of the 1980s created space for artists of all stripes, leading to the golden age of hip-hop, and releases that are now considered an integral part of the genre's canon. By the 1990s hip-hop was a chart-topping entity and enterprise, where artists were popularized through streetwear campaigns and brand deals.\n\nIn this decade, rappers were multifaceted in their flow and lyrics — whether rugged and hard-spitting, or poetic and fervently expressive. Artists like psychedelic hip-hop group De La Soul, salacious femcee Lil' Kim and Atlanta heavy-hitters Outkast expanded rap’s palette. Beats ranged from synthetic to weighty 808 drum patterns, all which redefined the genre’s 20-year presence.\n\nHip-hop chronicled truth and fantasy, providing listeners both deeply resonant and vividly divergent soundtrack whose influence continues to be felt. Decades later, records released in the 1990s are legend, and many of them appeared on the 65th GRAMMY Awards stage in a massive tribute to hip-hop.Here are 10 signature albums that bridged the golden age and the digital era of hip-hop.\n\nDe La Soul - De La Soul Is Dead (1991)\n\nBy 1991, conscious hip-hop pioneers De La Soul were over the \"D.A.I.S.Y. Age\" introduced on their seminal debut album 3 Feet High and Rising. The Long Island trio, composed of Posdnuos, Maseo and the late Trugoy the Dove jazzed up their sound on sophomore effort De La Soul Is Dead, marking a radical transition from hip-hop \"hippies\" to earnest rhymesayers.\n\nPosdnous and Trugoy melded simple production (courtesy of Prince Paul) with complex bars on \"Pease Porridge,\" and also explored the traumas of sexual molestation through metaphor on \"Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa.\" Although De La Soul Is Dead received mixed reviews, the LP was one of the first albums to earn a five-mic rating in hip-hop publication The Source. \"Still progressing and proud of it, De La has successfully escaped being trapped in the sophomore jinx with grooves that are harder than a brick wall,\" the throwback review reads.\n\nWith De La Soul Is Dead, the group, whose back catalog just arrived on digital music services in March, evaded the dreaded sophomore slump and cemented their place in hip-hop history.\n\nSnoop Dogg- Doggystyle (1993)\n\nAfter Calvin Broadus — then performing under the moniker Snoop Doggy Dogg — released his breakthrough album Doggystyle, West Coast rap was never the same. Playing on inspirations from classic Blaxploitation films and early funk pioneers, Snoop kept his posture smooth while rhyming over beats from Dr. Dre (who also discovered the Long Beach native), and welcomed fellow then-newcomers like The Lady of Rage, Tha Dogg Pound, Warren G and RBX as features.\n\nGiving listeners \"just a small introduction to the G-Funk era,\" Snoop helped usher in a soul-laden gangsta rap sound that stood in distinct contrast to the East Coast’s grittiness and jazz influence. The iconic \"Gin and Juice\" and \"Who Am I (What’s My Name?)\" have long been summertime cookout staples, while the eerie \"Murder Was the Case\" preceded Snoop being acquitted of murder just three years later. Now a 16-time GRAMMY nominee, Doggystyle marked Snoop’s debut as a hip-hop elite.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest - Midnight Marauders (1993)\n\nThree albums into their career, A Tribe Called Quest didn’t let up on Midnight Marauders. The Queens-bred group, which included Q-Tip, the late Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad (and occasional member Jarobi White) flaunted their lyricism and expansive musical knowledge on the 1993 release, which was navigated by a robotic \"tour guide.\"\n\nQ-Tip and Phife’s wordplay is nimble throughout the album, but truly spotlighted on the Trugoy the Dove-assisted \"Award Tour,\" the amorous \"Electric Relaxation\" and \"The Chase, Pt. II.\" \"8 Million Stories\" and \"Midnight\" were solo moments for Phife Dawg and Q-Tip, respectively, each who had brushed up their penmanship since ATCQ’s 1991 reinvention on The Low End Theory. Both atmospheric and imaginative, Midnight Marauders showcased ATCQ’s range as a progressive hip-hop act.\n\nDigable Planets - Blowout Comb (1994)\n\nJazz rap trio Digable Planets maintained their cool just one year after winning a GRAMMY Award for Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group. In 1994, Ishmael \"Butter Fly\" Butler, Mariana \"Ladybug Mecca\" Vieira and Craig \"Doodlebug\" Irving followed with Blowout Comb, their second and final studio album. With a minimalist approach, Digable Planets trekked through urban and Afrocentric themes soundtracked by live instrumentation and spoken word.\n\nEmotionally stirring and thematic, \"Black Ego\" saw Digable Planets tackling economic injustices and Black nationalism with nods to Blaxploitation films Cleopatra Jones and Superfly. The group asserted their refusal to go commercial on laidback earworm \"Jettin.\" Seventies slang and references to New York City boroughs floated throughout Blowout Comb, and although singles \"9th Wonder (Blackitolism)\" and \"Dial 7 (Axioms of Creamy Spies)\" didn’t chart, the album reintroduced Digable Planets in their most authentic form and reached No. 32 on the Billboard 200.\n\n2Pac - Me Against the World (1995)\n\nWith an awareness unrivaled by his contemporaries, Tupac Shakur's penultimate album, Me Against the World, exploredhis complexities. By March 1995, the rapper had served one month in prison on sexual abuse charges, and had used his previous year of freedom to record arguably the most poignant LP of his lifetime.\n\nOn the titular track, Shakur examined impoverished Black communities and morbid thoughts of mortality. A sample of Stevie Wonder’s \"That Girl\" textures \"So Many Tears,\" where 2Pac vocalizes music industry woes, his depression and even predicts an early death. \"Dear Mama,\" (which inspired the FX docuseries of the same name), was 2Pac’s dedication to mother and former Black Panther Party member Afeni Shakur; it became the third song by a rap act to be placed in the Library of Congress.\n\nThe latter song and Me Against the World would both earn Shakur his first GRAMMY nominations. While he didn't win, both are masterpieces that signaled the rapper’s coming-of-age.\n\nJay-Z - Reasonable Doubt (1996)\n\nJay-Z gave a solid lyrical offering on his 1996 debut. A landmark album on the now-defunct Roc-A-Fella Records, the 14-track Reasonable Doubt brought mafioso and luxury rap into the ring, as Jay-Z gave semi-autobiographical tales of street life.\n\nOn \"Feelin’ It,\" the Brooklyn rapper boasts his riches and opulent lifestyle, while the Issac Hayes-sampling \"Can I Live\" explores the close calls that the hustle brings. Hov’s stream-of-conscious flow highlighted production from the likes of Ski Beatz, DJ Premier and Clark Kent.\n\nReasonable Doubt predicted Jay-Z’s thriving future without a doubt, as he’s since taken hip-hop’s throne as a coveted 24-time GRAMMY-winning artist (in addition to 88 nominations).\n\nLil’ Kim - Hard Core (1996)\n\nBrooklynite Lil’ Kim carved out space for risque rap on her 1996 solo breakout Hard Core. Less than six months after the murder of her mentor the Notorious B.I.G., the former Junior M.A.F.I.A. member achieved solo commercial success for her provocative lyricism and appearance. Whereas many of her contemporaries adopted a more androgynous style, Lil’ Kim played up her sex appeal onstage and on record.\n\nThe raunchy \"Big Momma Thang,\" which samples 1978 Sylvester deep cut \"Was It Something That I Said,\" shows Lil Kim’s allyship with queer listeners. Lil’ Kim asserted her hood dominance on \"No Time,\" while flaunting her affection for being classily \"draped in diamonds and pearls.\" Although Hard Core was Moderately received, Lil’ Kim’s rap successors —Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B — would later speak highly of the Queen Bee’s NSFW magnetism. Nearly 30 years later, contemporary women in hip-hop continue to strive for Lil’ Kim’s unapologetic influence.\n\nMissy Elliott - Supa Dupa Fly (1997)\n\nHip-hop hadn’t witnessed fly until Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott stepped onto the scene. The Virginia-born rapper and singer/songwriter had once been a part of R&B group Sista before partnering with producer Timbaland. The two both wrote and produced almost the entirety of Aaliyah’s 1996 album One In A Million. By the late ‘90s, Elliott’s pen was in demand, giving her the confidence to share her unconventional sound and look as a solo act.\n\nHer 1997 debut, Supa Dupa Fly, redefined what it meant to be a woman in rap. Over Timbaland's bass-thumping production, Elliott went full-on futuristic. She humorously teased her sexuality on the audacious \"Sock It 2 Me,\" while the bouncy \"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\" sampled Memphis soul vocalist Ann Peebles with peculiar lyrics like \"my finger waves these days, they fall like Humpty.\"\n\nTwo decades before being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and receiving the Black Music Collective's Recording Academy Honors award, Elliott took the rap world by storm. Ahead of its time yet heralded, Supa Dupa Fly and Elliott’s one of a kind style showed the artist’s peers and successors how to be creative anomalies.\n\nOutkast - Aquemini (1998)\n\nThe South had something to say on Outkast’s third album Aquemini. The duo of André 3000 and Big Boi asserted their southern charm and immaculate rhyme schemes on the 16-track album that catapulted them to stardom. As the two rappers perfected their individualism, Aquemini also showed 3000 and Big Boi seamlessly meshing their styles together.\n\nMore spacey than their sophomore album ATLiens, Outkast doubled up on their down home twang on the funky (but controversial) \"Rosa Parks.\" The two questioned reality from dystopian technology on the surreal \"Synthesizer\" with P-Funk legend George Clinton. Listeners can visualize a juke joint scene on the reggae-tinged \"SpottieOttieDopaliscious,\" where 3000 and Big Boi intertwine tales of a violent nightclub encounter and a cursed romance.\n\nAquemini ushered a turn in Dirty South hip-hop, where the region gained national respect for its storytelling, realism and unique flow.\n\nDr. Dre - 2001 (1999)\n\nSuper producer and rapper Dr. Dre brought out the all-stars on his 1999 sophomore solo album 2001. The LP reunited the now seven-time GRAMMY-winner with his prodigies Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and Kurupt, while ushering in a new age of West Coast rap. Seven years after his groundbreaking debut album The Chronic, the former N.W.A. member was \"Still D.R.E.\"\n\nOn the aforementioned track, written entirely by Jay-Z, Dr. Dre flexed his near 15-year impact in hip-hop. \"The Watcher\" detailed the Compton native reaching music industry plateaus despite paranoia of \"a new era of gangstas.\" Strip club anthem \"The Next Episode\" harkened back to Dre and Snoop’s \"Nuthin’ But A 'G' Thang,\" while \"Let’s Get High\" captured a raunchy house party. On 2001, now certified 6x platinum, Dr. Dre was at his most carefree while setting the bar high for a new generation of hip-hop.\n\nEssential Hip-Hop Releases From The 1980s: Slick Rick, RUN-D.M.C., De La Soul & More\n\nEvery album comes with a backstory, but not many come with two. Rakim's new project G.O.D's Network (REB7RTH), out July 26, came together in a few quick months, from signing a deal in February 2024 to completion in June. The process was spurred by one dedicated A&R person frantically combing through his network of rappers to get guest verses over beats produced by the God MC himself.\n\nBut to hear that A&R man, Matt \"M80\" Markoff, tell it, creating the seven-song project didn't take four months. It took four years.\n\n\"I've known [Rakim's longtime manager] Matt [Kemp] and Rakim since 2007,\" Markoff tells me when I get him on the phone in late June. \"They're used to getting calls from me a couple of times a year just for, like, show referrals, verse referrals, things of that nature.\"\n\nBack at the beginning of the pandemic, Markoff had been talking to the folks at Fat Beats, the venerable record store-turned-distributor that's a huge name in independent hip-hop. He mentioned Rakim's name to the company, and Fat Beats responded that they'd love a project from the God MC. The original pitch, Markoff remembers, was \"a three or four song EP with some remixes.\"\n\nRakim quoted his price, Fat Beats agreed, and the project was underway, with the emcee meeting with producers to look for beats. But Rakim, who hasn't released a solo album since 2009's The Seventh Seal, is not one to be hurried.\n\n\"Ra was having [DJ] Premier and Pete Rock and Ninth Wonder and some of these people come to the studio,\" Markoff says. \"Because of scheduling conflicts and stuff and, you know, normal course of life, it just wasn't right. The vibe wasn't there.\"\n\nThat's where Jazzy Jeff came into play. Rakim and the legendary DJ began working together and, per Markoff, it \"just meshed.\" It seemed like, instead of a handful of songs, a full-length record was in the offing.\n\n\"As soon as they finish the first song, I walk into Fat Beats and say, ‘Hey, this is what we're doing now,'\" the A&R man recalls. \"Instead of Rakim with random producers, it's Rakim/Jazzy Jeff. That'll be huge.\"\n\nThen…nothing.\n\nA few years pass, and the Rakim and Jazzy Jeff project is still unfinished. (Rakim described its status as \"We have a couple records already done.\") Fat Beats, which was on the auction block (it was eventually sold in March 2024), wants its money back. Rakim obliges, and everyone seems set to forget about the whole thing.\n\nMarkoff, however, was not about to give up on working with the man he calls \"my favorite emcee of all time.\"\n\nThe revamped album started its life as not an album at all. Instead, the original conception was a model Markoff had used before: licensing beats by people not typically thought of as producers. In this case, he'd be offering aspiring rappers the chance to get beats by arguably the most influential rapper of all time.\n\n\"He's taken people who are not necessarily known as producers and put together beat packages for them,\" manager Matt Kemp says of Markoff. \"And then, one of the things he does is he goes out and he licenses those beats through a company that he has. If you're a European artist that wouldn't necessarily have access to things like that, you can get it.\"\n\nSo that, as of February of this year, was the (revamped) plan: have Rakim do six beats and one verse, and sell non-exclusive licenses, so that any rapper, anywhere in the world, who wants to use them in a song of their own could do so. This, indeed, was a vision that was followed through all the way to the finish line — you can see the end result released July 12, priced between $700-$1,050 depending on what you want to do with the beats and the rhyme, here.\n\nBut along the way to creating that package, things got significantly more complicated. As Rakim was making the beats, he found he really liked them. In some cases, he even wanted to rhyme on them himself.\n\n\"As the beats started coming together and Rakim was really in the studio and we started putting the rhymes onto them, we realized that it was bigger just than that [original vision],\" Matt Kemp said.\n\nThe wheels started turning. Rakim, the God MC, as a producer? That would be a project worth sharing with the world, not just a few aspiring artists.\n\nAs it turns out, unbeknownst even to many Ra fans, the rapper has been making beats since the beginning. In fact, he produced — and played drums on — one of Eric B and Rakim's classic songs, 1992's \"Juice (Know the Ledge).\" So producing an entire project didn't seem like such a big stretch after all.\n\n\"I always was attached to making beats,\" Rakim explains to me. \"But I got to the point where I'm confident with my production now. I got the chance to produce the album and jumped at the opportunity.\"\n\nRakim, as has been well documented over the years, comes from a musical family. His older brother Ronnie was a keyboard player of some note with his own claim on rap history, his other brother Stevie is also keyboardist who performed on some Eric B. and Rakim songs, and the rapper's aunt is the late R&B legend Ruth Brown. So when making beats, Ra will often play drums, bass, guitar, or piano. (He cops to enlisting one of his brothers if the keyboard part gets too complicated.)\n\nHe describes his production style this way: \"You try to add on to the sample, and enhance certain sounds that you hear. Or you might just add a melody that you feel enhances the sample as well.\"\n\nIn addition to playing instruments on the project, Rakim also plays the turntable.\n\n\"I always knew how to DJ, and I like being able to enjoy the project from a different seat,\" he tells me. \"I enjoyed putting the music together, coming up with the scratch patterns.\"\n\nSo with the musical side of the equation firmly in place, what about the vocals? Rakim was inspired to add verses on a few songs, and hooks on a few more.\n\n\"It's mostly a project that I was supposed to be producing,\" he explains. \"In the midst of that, there's certain beats that I'm playing and I'm like, ‘I gotta rhyme on this one,' or, ‘I got a rhyme that fits this one perfectly.'\"\n\nThe question was, what to write about? After a decade and a half without an album, the rapper had a lot to discuss, and needed to find new ways to say it.\n\nFor the project's lead single, \"BE ILL,\" he got in plenty of internal rhymes. And the song's tempo allowed him to come up with different rhythms.\n\n\"When tracks are at that speed, I'm able to manipulate time and space to come up with different rhythms because I have so much time and space to deal with,\" he says. \"It was one of them songs I loved rhyming to. Just having fun with words and phrases, and at the same time having so much on my mind to say.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to say a lot of things,\" Ra admits when discussing his writing on the album. \"It's hard to just come back and say a verse when you've been gone so long. So I tried to be very specific and cautious with the words that I chose, and try to be entertaining at the same time. So it was a little nerve wracking.\"\n\nEven with Rakim's vocal contributions (he ends up with either verses or hooks on six of the project's seven tracks), more was needed to complete the songs. That's where Markoff really got going.\n\n\"Literally, I didn't waste a single day,\" he remembers. \"I was calling the artists in my network. I reached out to each artist one by one, and let each artist go through the folder [of beats] with me and make their picks.\"\n\nAmong the artists Markoff reached out to were several members of the Wu-Tang Clan. He has a long relationship with the crew, having worked with them on several projects including the well-regarded 2005 album Wu-Tang Meet the Indie Culture.\n\nMarkoff recalls the exact moment when he lined up Wu member Masta Killa for his appearance on what became \"BE ILL.\"\n\n\"I was at the first ever Wu-Tang Clan residency in Vegas, and I told Masta Killa, ‘Dude, I just got these Rakim beats 10 minutes ago.' I played 10 seconds of the second beat, which was the beat for ‘BE ILL.' And he was like, ‘That's the one.'\"\n\nA different Wu-Tang show was responsible for one of the album's other notable guest appearances, Cash Money stalwart B.G. The two met at the concert, and the Louisiana rapper was in the studio \"48 hours later,\" Markoff recalls.\n\nFor a handful of artists he had good long-term relationships with, Markoff let them choose which of Rakim's beats they wanted to rap over. In addition to Masta Killa, he names Chino XL, Hus Kingpin, 38 Spesh, and TriState as being on that short list. After that, he says, it was all his decision.\n\nThe end result is a list of some of the top rappers in his Rolodex: Kool G. Rap, Method Man, Kurupt, Canibus, KXNG Crooked, Skyzoo, Joell Ortiz, and many more — including an outro from Snoop Dogg. But one of the most surprising things on the tracklist is that a number of the guests aren't alive anymore.\n\nNipsey Hussle, Prodigy, DMX, and Fred the Godson have verses on the record. All of them were people Markoff had worked with in some capacity over the course of his career. He says that all of the verses were \"in my stash or under my ownership.\" So when he was looking for material for the Rakim project, they were a perfect fit.\n\nThe Nipsey Hussle contribution in particular stood out so much that the entire song, \"Love Is the Message,\" was designed around it. The project's engineer placed Neighborhood Nip's verse first, and everyone else listened to that when recording.\n\n\"We kind of glorified who he is, and came up with the title ‘Love Is the Message' to put everything in perspective,\" Rakim tells me. \"So everybody vibed off of that and everything that we implemented had to have that feel or had to be in that direction.\"\n\nOne thing Rakim noticed as he was listening to the contributions coming in? Many of them were paying tribute to him. In particular, B.G. says in his verse that he's \"on a song with the greatest.\"\n\n\"To hear things like that from my peers is a beautiful thing,\" says Rakim, who also admits to tearing up when hearing Snoop Dogg praise him on the outro of one of the album's songs. \"Hip-hop is one of the more, I guess, feisty genres. It's hard to get that love from your peers. So it's a real blessing to hear it from people like that, to hear what they think of you and to say that on records. A lot of people might think that of you, but would never say it on a record.\"\n\nFor Markoff, B.G.'s tribute was particularly meaningful because of the rapper's history. He began his career in a duo, and later a quartet, with another rapper sometimes considered the greatest of all time, Lil Wayne.\n\n\"For B.G. to have that history, but acknowledge Rakim — I was speechless,\" Markoff confides. \"It was really cool to see. It's like, ‘I'm not just going to say my partner, my friend, my confidant Lil Wayne's the best because we grew up together.'\"\n\nFinally, after all the guest verses came in, the project was ready. Seven songs, entirely produced by Rakim, with raps by him and a broad cross-section of artists. The question, then: what exactly is this project? An album? An EP? Rakim's big comeback? A teaser for his eventual full-length return?\n\nTo Markoff, none of these labels are important. He's not concerned about fans being disappointed that a project under Rakim's name features only a handful of the rapper's verses.\n\n\"The fan is going to look at it however they want to look at it,\" he says. \"The negative people will stay negative. It wouldn't matter if it was the greatest album of all time. The positive people that are so grateful that I stepped up to the plate to help bring new Rakim music to the world are going to love it.\"\n\nAfter all, he continues, \"The whole point originally when we started making it was letting his peers shine on Rakim beats. The fact that this project morphed into something that Rakim literally is on 95% of, I couldn't have asked for more of a blessing.\"\n\nSo Matt Markoff, the boy who fell in love with Rakim's music at 12 is now, three decades later, putting out music from his hero.\n\n\"Dream fulfilled,\" he says right before we hang up. \"Now I gotta figure out what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.\"\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWe’re fortunate enough to be living in the middle of a Missy Elliott resurgence — not that she ever went away.\n\nThree decades into her groundbreaking career, Missy is readying her very first headlining tour, which begins July 4 in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Out of This World Tour runs through August and features her longtime collaborators Timbaland, Busta Rhymes, and Ciara.\n\nThe fact that it is her first headlining tour may be surprising, given that she’s been on the scene since debuting with the group Sista in the mid-1990s, and has been a chart-topping star since becoming a solo artist in 1997.\n\nThe hip-hop icon released her last full-length album, The Cookbook, nearly two decades ago but time hasn’t diminished her influence at all. In fact, we’re all still catching up to the futuristic vision that Missy and Timbaland introduced to the world in the late 1990s in their songs and videos.\n\nMissy began her career as a member of Sista, which was a part of the Swing Mob, a musical collective working under Jodeci’s DeVanté Swing. That crew included a number of future world-changers, including Missy, Timbaland, Ginuwine, Tweet, Stevie J., and two legends who have since passed on, Magoo and Static Major. After Sista was dropped from their label, Missy, by all accounts, would have been perfectly happy to settle into a life as a songwriter and producer. But something bigger was beckoning.\n\nPersuaded by Elektra’s Sylvia Rhone with the promise of her own label, Missy agreed to turn in one album as a solo artist. That album, 1997’s Supa Dupa Fly, made Missy not just a star but an icon, and changed the course of her life. It began a career that, over a quarter-century later, found her inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame — she was the first female rapper ever to be nominated for the latter.\n\nAnd that’s just the beginning of the accolades. There are the four GRAMMY wins and head-spinning 22 nominations. She was also honored alongside Dr. Dre, Lil Wayne (who has not been shy about calling Missy his favorite rapper), and the woman who gave Missy her first solo record deal, Sylvia Rhone, at 2023’s Black Music Collective’s Recording Academy Honors event. Missy was also a key participant in the GRAMMYs tribute to a half-century of hip-hop that same year.\n\nThroughout it all, Missy has remained humble. When speaking to GRAMMY.com in 2022, she reflected on how she and longtime collaborator Timbaland had no idea of their impact at the time.\n\n\"We really just came out with a sound that we had been doing for some time, but we had no clue that it would be game changing, that we would change the cadence — the sound of what was happening at that time,\" she said. \"No clue!\"\n\n\"Her whole existence is based on moving us and influencing us,\" says her longtime manager Mona Scott-Young. \"She wants to be able to touch people.\"\n\nAnd that she has. To celebrate the Missy-aissance, GRAMMY.com spoke with Missy's colleagues and collaborators for an insider’s view on the course of her career and what makes the four-time GRAMMY winner unique.\n\nThe quotes and comments used in this feature were edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nMissy’s Impact Began With Her First Guest Verse\n\nThe first time many people took note of Missy Elliott was her verse on the 1996 remix of Gina Thompson’s \"That Thing You Do.\"\n\nGina Thompson (singer): I was in the process of completing my first album, Nobody Does It Better. Actually, it was complete. So what happened was, my A&R at the time, Bruce Carbone at Mercury Records, wanted to have Puffy do the remix.\n\nPuffy was like, \"We have this person that's really talented. Her name's Missy, and she used to be with the group Sista, and she's a phenomenal writer. She's working with a lot of other artists, she’s definitely the next big thing in the R&B/hip-hop world.\" We were like, cool.\n\nI believe we actually heard it over the speaker phone in Bruce’s office. I know that I said that I loved it, and I felt her style was unique and different. It grew on me in a great way. I just felt like it was a smash. She definitely had added a great touch to it. I was super-excited about it.\n\nMerlin Bobb (former Executive Vice President, Elektra Records): I was blown away by the simple fact that I knew she was a great songwriter. But when I heard her rhyming, I thought it was the most unique style that I had heard in some time.\n\nDigital Black (former member of Playa, part of the Swing Mob): A lot of people only knew her as a writer or an R&B artist, but when she came on that Gina Thompson record with that rap, it changed everything. It allowed her to be even more herself.\n\nMona Scott-Young (manager): Oh my God, have you heard that song? It’s her ability to use expression and evoke emotion without even using words. She said, \"He he he haw,\" and we all found a new way to bounce. There was something fun and magical and different that spoke to what we would come to know was this incredibly vivid imagination that would take us places sonically and visually that we didn’t even know we needed to be.\n\nRead more: 50 Artists Who Changed Rap: Jay-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., Dr. Dre, Nicki Minaj, Kendrick Lamar, Eminem & More\n\nShe Changed The Sound Of Hip-Hop With Her Debut LP\n\nMissy’s first solo album, Supa Dupa Fly, came out the following year. It gave new energy to a hip-hop scene that was still reeling from the deaths of 2Pac and Biggie.\n\nAnne Kristoff (former Vice President of PR, Elektra): She 100 percent did not want to be an artist. She's like, \"I'm not an artist. I want to be Diane Warren. I'm going to write the songs. I'm going to be behind the scenes.\"\n\nMerlin Bobb: I started talking to her regarding being an artist. She was totally against it. \"No, I want to be a songwriter.\" And also, just to be honest, [Sista] had been dropped from Elektra prior to my conversations with her, so she wasn't too eager, I think, to jump back aboard.\n\nIt took about six or seven months of us discussing ways to do this. I spoke to Sylvia [Rhone, then-head of Elektra], and I said, \"She's an incredible songwriter. Let's offer her a production deal or a label deal where she can not only just look at herself as an artist, but at the same time develop and nurture artists under her own banner.\" Sylvia thought it was a great idea.\n\nWe both talked to Missy about it, and she said, \"Okay, I'll do one album.\" I was ecstatic because she was writing some great songs, but she also gave us her first album, which was, needless to say, a classic.\n\nKathy Iandoli (author, \"God Save the Queens: The Essential History of Women in Hip-Hop and Baby Girl: Better Known as Aaliyah\"): In God Save the Queens, I referred to her as the Andy Warhol of hip-hop, in the sense that she took the art and the cultural aspect of it, and she just put this spin and interpretation of the art that no one had ever really done prior.\n\nWith Missy’s arrival around ‘97, we were at a point in time where hip-hop was in a complete state of confusion. We did not know where it was going to go. Missy made high art hip-hop that was commercially accessible. And for that, she changed the entire game.\n\nGina Thompson: When she had her first project with the whole vision — not only her sound, but her songwriting style, the look — everyone was like, \"This girl went out on edge. I'm gonna do a little bit of the same thing and not be so worried if I don't sound so average, what people are going to think. Because she's out on the edge doing it.\" And I promise you, ever since she came out, that you started hearing a lot more of female rappers tweaking their voices.\n\nLenny Holmes (guitarist): In hip-hop, everybody would think that it's a whole bunch of computer generated stuff. Missy Elliott does not approach it like that. She loves live instrumentation, but she likes to take bits and pieces of it. She simplifies it, and it is placed uniquely in the track at certain points. That's what makes up the structure of the song.\n\nMona Scott-Young: Everything from the way she looked to what she was talking about to the way she delivered that music and what she represented in terms of being nonconforming, not looking like the other female rappers of the day — I think all of those elements were the perfect lightning in a bottle. The way she rode that beat, both lyrically and with her delivery, was very, very different from everything else that we were hearing.\n\nRead more: Revisiting 'Supa Dupa Fly' At 25: Missy Elliott Is Still Inspired By Her Debut Record\n\nShe Reinvented The Music Video\n\nYou can’t think of Missy Elliott without picturing her iconic music videos, many done in collaboration with director Hype Williams.\n\nBrian Greenspoon (former International Publicist, Elektra): I mean, she came out of the gate wearing a garbage bag, and made it the coolest thing anyone had ever seen.\n\nMerlin Bobb: She said, if I put out this album — initially we were talking about a single deal, but we went into an album — there’s two things very important to me: the dance aspect and the visual aspect.\n\nKathy Iandoli: The thing that I really loved about Missy's music videos, she was a big budget music video person. She got the men's music video budget.\n\nAnne Kristoff: When you think about the \"Rain\" video — I'm just guessing, I don't want to put words in her mouth — but I think when she saw that the vision in her head could become real out in the world, that anything she could think of could happen, that maybe it made it a little more fun for her to be an artist. I hope.\n\nDigital Black: Missy is one of the funniest people you’ll ever meet. People maybe don't know. She loves joking. So that was just her being her.\n\nGina Thompson: You started seeing a lot of people doing certain robotic-type images or moves in their videos to almost mimic her \"Supa Dupa Fly.\" She’s the creator of that.\n\nEarl Baskerville (manager/producer): Missy would get with the director, and she would sit there and go over the whole treatment. A lot of the visuals came from her. She was very hands on. Today, you can shoot a video in four or five hours. But Missy’s video shoots was so long, I used to hate it. We would be there fifteen hours for a three minute video!\n\nShe Was Avant-Garde But Still Pop\n\nMissy’s musical and visual style was like nothing anyone had ever seen. Yet she still became a star. How did she manage to be both innovative and accessible?\n\nKathy Iandoli: You can't make something that the general public can't access, or speak over their heads.\n\nDigital Black: Even if you said it sounded weird, it still had some soulfulness to it. I think that was what allowed her to touch so many different people.\n\nMerlin Bobb: When you have an artist that stands out, but it doesn't go over your head musically, artistically, lyrically, then it works. People, when they heard and experienced something new and fresh that was easy to digest, but it was unique, they gravitated to it.\n\nBrian Greenspoon: How was it sold to a mass audience? I mean, the sound was breakthrough. What Timbaland was doing with drum sounds, and the way they were building these very sparse rhythms and sound beds, they were breaking ground. But the thing that worked is that they had these incredible songs that Missy was writing and that she had these incredible featured artists on.\n\nGina Thompson: To try to figure out what her brain is doing, I’ve been gave that up.\n\nEarl Baskerville: Nobody could figure out what we were doing, because they couldn’t understand the sound.\n\nLenny Holmes: Her rhythmic style of how she would do the vocals was just unheard of. Like, doubling up accents. The things that she started doing — you would hear a deejay do a scratch on a record. You would not hear a singer do it. I was like, What in the world?\n\nAnne Kristoff: She was doing these really creative things that no one else was doing visually. And the sound was different than whatever everyone else was doing. So it wasn't a hard sell for the press.\n\nShe Was A Master At Working With Other Artists\n\nMissy was far more than just a solo star. All throughout her career, she continued her first love: writing and producing for other artists — including Ciara, Aaliyah, Destiny’s Child, and Whitney Houston.\n\nLenny Holmes: Missy had a great relationship with singers and rappers, because she could do both. A lot of people don’t know, but Missy can sing. So when we worked with groups that had singing parts on them, a lot of times she would go ahead and lay down the guide track for the actual artist to sing.\n\nKathy Iandoli: Missy just really understood the artists that she worked with. She saw their strengths, and she helped them utilize them to the best of their capabilities.\n\nAngelique Miles (former music publishing executive): She was able to relate to the artist and express that artist. She was able to customize and express that artist's story. Whatever she wrote for 702 didn’t sound like what she wrote for Whitney Houston.\n\nDigital Black: She was good at listening to the artist, seeing what they do, and then, how can you enhance what they do well? Those are the best records. She was great at tailor-making records for people, just from her doing her due diligence on learning who the artist is. Not just going in, \"I’m Missy, I can write whatever.\" I'm gonna write something specifically for you that enhances what you’ve already done.\n\nMerlin Bobb: She would have made an incredible A&R person. I would have hired her back then. She was able to come up with lyrics and melodies and songs and chords and production that to me stood out. She worked with both male and female artists. She really knew how to get an artist not only to sing a great song, but to sing very uniquely and in their own way, because she was a great vocal production coach.\n\nMona Scott-Young: She's always listening beyond what we hear. Even if there's a song an artist has [that she’s not involved with], she'll say, \"Yeah, I would have done this thing differently with this artist. Because if you listen to what she did on this one part of the song, you can hear that there's more range there. But for some reason they didn't push her to go there.\" That to me is just one of the things that makes her such a great producer and star finder, because she always is looking for what more they can do and how they can challenge themselves to be better.\n\nEarl Baskerville: She had signed an artist that I used to manage named Mocha. And she told Mocha to go in there and just rap. I think Mocha might have did 30-something bars, 60 bars. know. Missy listened to all of the stuff she did, took it, and dissected it. She went in there and took eight bars, not from the beginning of the track — I don’t know where she found it, in the middle or something — and put it on the Nicole Wray record \"Make It Hot.\" When Mocha comes in, that’s actually the middle of the verse somewhere! That was crazy to me.\n\nHer First Love Was Always Songwriting\n\nThrough it all, Missy’s strength remained (and remains) her songwriting. But what makes her songs stand out, and stand the test of time?\n\nEarl Baskerville: Missy didn’t want to be an artist. She just wanted to be a songwriter.\n\nMerlin Bobb: Her songwriting was very soulful, but it also had great melodic edge to it. They’re very realistic lyrics to a young scene that was happening in R&B and hip-hop at the time. So it was somewhat of a fusion of R&B and hip-hop lyrically, and she just had a very strong sense of melody and great hook lines.\n\nMona Scott-Young: She wasn't talking about the same thing that we were hearing from a lot of the other females in the genre at the time — overt sexuality and material possessions and that kind of stuff. She was engaging, having a good time lyrically, and holding her own with her male counterparts.\n\nShe was giving us music that was great, and it didn't matter that it was coming from a female. She was kind of this androgynous being that was delivering great music. You listen to the song, you just want to party.\n\nRead more: Missy Elliott Makes History As First Female Rapper Nominated For Songwriters Hall Of Fame\n\nShe Changed The Artists Who Came After Her\n\nAs with all major innovations, it didn’t take long after Missy broke big for her influence to be felt.\n\nKathy Iandoli: The special relationship between Aaliyah, Missy, and Timbaland was the fact that together they all created a new sound that would set the standard of hip-hop and what we now define as alt-R&B. They invented a new subgenre. It was something that Missy was able to continue along and then create a sound on her own terms.\n\nGina Thompson: Many people were trying to emulate her whole different style.\n\nLenny Holmes: [Were people copying her?] Most definitely. But there's only one Missy. And I got to say, there’s only one Timbaland too. You hear that trademark voice or the trademark lick, and you just know that's them.\n\nBrian Greenspoon: I think she influenced just about everybody that came after her. The sound of hip-hop changed after her and Timbaland dropped that music. The way the people produced their drum sounds and their beats, the use of hi hats, it all changed based on Missy and Timbaland.\n\nMerlin Bobb: Most hip-hop/R&B collaborations at that time were hip-hop records with vocal hooks from R&B artists. She kind of flipped it, where she worked from the R&B side and made the vocals and the production more hip-hop friendly.\n\nMona Scott-Young: Her whole existence is based on moving us and influencing us. She wants to be able to touch people. So when we see artists who you can hear or see the influence, then you know that she's done her job.\n\nThere's so many artists — Flyana Boss, a little bit Cardi, a little bit Nicki. They all, I think, have been influenced by Missy, her look, her sound, in one way, shape or form. And that is the greatest compliment, to inspire a generation and see them take what you've done to another level. But then she's constantly also evolving and keeping everyone on their toes.\n\nLearn more: 8 Ways Aaliyah Empowered A Generation Of Female R&B Stars\n\nConsidering Missy And Her Legacy\n\nEveryone interviewed for this piece had so much love for Missy. Here’s a small sample.\n\nBrian Greenspoon: Missy is one of the most professional, talented, creative artists I've ever had the luck to work with. I'm happy to see that she is being recognized for being the icon that we all saw that she was becoming back then.\n\nLenny Holmes: Even today, in whatever we're doing, we use what we've learned from Missy Elliott. It’s mixed in whatever we do. It’s amazing what she has done for herself, but she has definitely helped people along the way, and we will forever be grateful to her.\n\nDigital Black: She's a one-of-one, God-given talent. She earned every award, every accolade, accomplishment. Her work ethic was phenomenal, and nothing was given. Big sis earned everything, and I just want to say I love her, and it's been a pleasure and an honor to be a part of her career.\n\nKathy Iandoli: There’s so much of the art that we have right now that we have to thank her for.\n\nMona Scott-Young: This has been an incredible journey. I always talk about being incredibly blessed to have had the opportunity to play a role when you have somebody like her who has touched so many people globally and whose music and entire presence hold this special place in fans’ hearts.\n\nEvery day it's just about, how do we continue to push forth, break boundaries, challenge ourselves to do things bigger and better than we did it the last go round.\n\nExplore The Artists Who Changed Hip-Hop\n\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of Def Jam Recordings, the New York label that made history in hip-hop, R&B, pop, and even thrash metal since its founding, and continues to do so today.\n\nA label that began out of an NYU dorm room in 1984 quickly became an artistic (and business) powerhouse. Early acts like LL Cool J, the Beastie Boys, and Public Enemy were raw, adventurous, and risk-taking. Def Jam's roster opened new pathways in a still-young genre, seemingly every few months.\n\nAfter that initial explosion, the label experienced a brief lull in the early 1990s when one label founder departed and the other expanded into fashion and comedy. Def Jam came roaring back beginning in 1994, and by 1998 the label was home to some of the most popular and influential artists in the game — including burgeoning megastars DMX and Jay-Z. To this day, Def Jam maintains a roster of both commercially successful and critically beloved artists in hip-hop, R&B, and pop.\n\nTo commemorate the anniversary of the label that gave us, well, pretty much everyone, here’s a list of 15 of Def Jam’s essential releases. While Def Jam brought audiences plenty of singles, EPs and remixes, this list primarily focuses on albums. Each project has a mix of artistic merit, popularity, influence and longevity, originality, and played a key role in the story of Def Jam as a whole. Think of it as a chronological run through the key albums that built one of the most lasting labels in modern music.\n\nAnd finally: it must be said that in recent years, a dark shadow has begun to loom over Def Jam’s legacy. Label co-founder Russell Simmons been accused over the past seven years of numerous instances of sexual assault, dating back decades. In spite of these accusations, the label (in which Simmons hasn’t been involved for a quarter-century) remains on top, safeguarding its valuable archive while looking forward to another four decade run as fruitful as the first one.\n\nT La Rock & Jazzy Jay - \"It’s Yours\" (1984)\n\nThe one single on this list is also the first piece of music ever released with the now-famous Def Jam logo. \"It’s Yours\" was a single produced by Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin — his very first hip-hop production. Instrumentally, it was perhaps only comparable to Larry Smith and Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons’ contemporaneous work with Run-D.M.C. Both \"It’s Yours\" and D.M.C.’s early work were severely stripped-down, consisting of a few drum sounds, an instrumental stab, and some scratches.\n\nLyrically, though, \"It’s Yours\" is worlds apart from \"Sucker M.C.’s\" — or pretty much anything else going on in hip-hop at the time. T La Rock, the brother of Treacherous Three member Special K, came from a family of educators, and he put every ounce of his erudition into the track. It begins, \"Commentating, illustrating/ Description giving, adjective expert\" and goes from there.\n\nLL Cool J - 'Radio' (1985)\n\nIn the early 1980s, the state of the hip-hop album was very grim. Only a few existed, and they almost exclusively consisted of a few singles mixed with often-confusing filler. Two things changed that. First, Run-D.M.C.’s 1984 self-titled debut, which GRAMMY.com examined in depth a few months ago. Second was LL Cool J’s debut album Radio, the very first full-length album Def Jam ever released.\n\nIn many ways, Radio kicked off hip-hop’s Golden Age. The record shows LL, then still in his teens, as a versatile artist who can be boastful, funny, aggressive, lyrical. The album shows many different sides of his personality, and helped set the template for what a rap album could be.\n\nRead more: 20 Iconic Hip-Hop Style Moments: From Run-D.M.C. To Runways\n\nBeastie Boys - 'Licensed to Ill' (1986)\n\nThe Beasties would release more complex and enlightened albums than Licensed to Ill, and one of the members would eventually apologize for some of its lyrics. But there’s no denying that it was a smash hit. It was the first rap album to ever top the Billboard 200, got the group onstage with Madonna, and would eventually sell over 10 million copies.\n\nWas some of that success due to their race? Sure. They were a credible group, signed to a hot rap label, at a time when it was still novel for white people to be performers in hip-hop. And yet, that’s not the whole story.\n\nLicensed to Ill is a catchy, unique, energetic album, and the group members show undeniable chemistry. To this day, shout-filled, guitar-heavy anthems like \"No Sleep till Brooklyn\" and the ubiquitous \"Fight for Your Right\" can still get the party started.\n\nRead more: The Beastie Boys Provide A License To Party\n\nPublic Enemy - 'It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back' (1988)\n\nThere’s not too much you can say about this album that hasn’t already been said in the years of books, conferences, academic papers, and deluxe re-issues. It has ended up at or near the top of many all-time best lists. Its abrasive, collage-like approach to composition was never equalled (and, in light of current laws and practices around sampling, can never even be approached). The comic stylings of Flavor Flav bring just the right amount of levity to balance Chuck D’s takes on life-and-death issues.\n\nDecades after its release, the album still sounds urgent. And sadly, in an America still roiled with tensions over race, incarceration, drugs, and the media, its concerns remain as relevant as ever.\n\nRead more: 5 Things We Learned At \"An Evening With Chuck D\" At The GRAMMY Museum\n\nSlick Rick - 'The Great Adventures of Slick Rick' (1988)\n\nSlick Rick is the ultimate rap storyteller, and his debut album is the best example of his artistry. \"I wrote them like an essay,\" Rick once said of creating the batch of songs that make up Great Adventures. He also compared it to doing stand-up. So you have exactly what those two reference points imply: stories that are well-constructed, and also frequently riotously funny.\n\nRick is the master of the telling detail (remember \"Dave, the dope fiend shooting dope/ Who don’t know the meaning of water nor soap\" from \"Children’s Story\"?), the humorous twist, the morality tale, the bedtime story, the character voice. His influence lives on in perhaps his most devoted protege, Ghostface Killah, as well as in any rapper who has tried to craft a song with a beginning, middle, and end.\n\nLearn more: Essential Hip-Hop Releases From The 1980s: Slick Rick, RUN-D.M.C., De La Soul & More\n\nWarren G - 'Regulate… G Funk Era'(1994)\n\nA bit of an edge case here, as technically the record was put out by Violator Records and Rush Associated Labels, the latter of which was a sort of umbrella organization Def Jam ran in the mid-1990s. Many albums that could have made this list, including projects by Redman, Onyx, Domino, and Nice & Smooth, were released under the RAL banner. But Warren G’s debut, a giant hit in an era where Def Jam really needed it, became inextricably associated with the label, to the point where an article about the album on Universal Music’s website mentions Def Jam five times in the first two paragraphs.\n\nRegulate is a pop-savvy take on the G-funk sound that was then ascendant. It was a huge success in a year that saw the introduction of tons of amazing rappers into the game. And Warren G being associated with Def Jam meant that the East Coast-centric label had expanded its geographic footprint.\n\nRead more: Warren G Revisits 'Regulate: The G-Funk Era': How The 1994 Album Paved The Way For West Coast Hip-Hop's Dominance\n\nFoxy Brown - 'Ill Na Na' (1996)\n\nDef Jam wasn’t always a friendly place for female artists (despite many of the most important employees being women, including one-time president Nana Ashhurst). In fact, the label didn’t release a rap album by a woman until Nikki D’s Daddy’s Little Girl in 1991. So Foxy Brown’s impact — on Def Jam and on the rap world as a whole — cannot be overstated. Ill Na Na was an album that changed everything for female rappers. It had songs for the clubs, the block, and the radio. Foxy’s sexuality, versatility, and first-class rhyming would have an influence on countless rappers, most famously her number one fan Nicki Minaj, who has been effusively praising Foxy for more than a decade.\n\nRead more: Ladies First: 10 Essential Albums By Female Rappers\n\nDMX - 'It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot' (1998)\n\nNo less an authority than Nas referred to 1998 as \"The year DMX took over the world.\" It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot is how he did it. The album set fire to Bad Boy’s so-called \"shiny suit era\" by embodying its polar opposite: a dark, grimy vision full of gothic synths; raspy, full-throated lyrics; and, sometimes, actual barks. Without DMX, there’s no NYC street rap return: no G-Unit mixtape run, no Diplomats.\n\nThe record is consistent and captivating from start to finish, and its thematic centerpiece comes, appropriately, about halfway through with \"Damien,\" which reminds all of us that the most difficult battles we fight are the ones with ourselves.\n\nJay-Z - 'Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life' (1998)\n\nJay-Z has made more critically beloved albums than Vol. 2 (Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint both fall in that category). He has made albums with bigger hits (The Blueprint 3 had a No. 1 hit with \"Empire State of Mind\"). But he has never made a more important LP.\n\nVol. 2 was the album that made Jay a superstar. Its Annie-sampling title track (produced by the late 45 King) sent him to the stratosphere — a process he actually documented on his follow-up album. But the record wasn’t just a commercial novelty. It showed Jay at the absolute top of his game: cocky, funny, and brilliant. Case in point: his novel approach to storytelling in \"Coming of Age (Da Sequel),\" where all the important action takes place in just a few seconds, inside the characters’ heads.\n\nRead more: Songbook: How Jay-Z Created The 'Blueprint' For Rap's Greatest Of All Time\n\nLudacris - 'Word of Mouf' (2001)\n\nAround the turn of the millennium, Def Jam had its sights set on conquering new territory. Specifically, the South. So they set up Def Jam South and hired Scarface to head it up. The entity’s biggest success came from an Atlanta DJ who went by Chris Luva Luva on the air, but began rapping as Ludacris.\n\nWord of Mouf was Luda’s second album, but it was the one that really cemented his stardom with songs like \"Rollout (My Business),\" \"Area Codes,\" and the immortal \"Move Bitch\" (the last of which has had an artist-approved second life as a protest chant). The album proved that the South was here to stay, and that Def Jam would have a role in determining its hip-hop future.\n\nLearn more: A Guide To Southern Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From The Dirty South\n\nScarface - 'The Fix' (2002)\n\nSpeaking of Scarface and Def Jam South, Face had no intention of dropping music while running the label. But, in his telling, Def Jam exec Lyor Cohen insisted on it, paying handsomely for the privilege.\n\n\"There were so many things working in my favor on that album,\" Scarface wrote in his memoir Diary of a Madman. \"For the first time, I was working on an album for a label that believed in me 100 percent and didn’t want anything from me except for me to make the dopest album I could possibly make. And they went out of their way to make that possible.\"\n\nDef Jam’s history of putting out classics inspired Face on The Fix, he writes in that book. And in the end, the album stands up there with any of them. It is one of only a small handful of rap records to earn a perfect five-mic rating from The Source, and it belongs in that rarified air with projects like Illmatic and Aquemini.\n\nKanye West - 'The College Dropout' (2004)\n\nYes, today Kanye West is the worst: a Hitler-loving, Trump-supporting, paranoid, antichoice, antisemite who stands accused of sexual harrassment. But two decades ago, the world met a Mr. West who at least seemed very different.\n\nThe College Dropout presented an artist who was already extremely well-known as a beatmaker. But Kanye’s carefully crafted persona as the bridge between mainstream rap and the underground — \"First n— with a Benz and a backpack,\" as he put it — meant that he appealed to pretty much everyone. The College Dropout wasn't West at the top of his rap game, but it did show his skill at developing song concepts, at beats, and at creating an artistic vision so powerful, and so relatable, that it captivated an entire generation.\n\nCam’ron - 'Purple Haze' (2004)\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Def Jam without discussing Roc-A-Fella. Jay-Z’s label hooked up with Def Jam in 1997, and had a years-long hot streak with artists like Kanye, Beanie Sigel, Freeway, the Young Gunz, and of course Cam’ron’s Diplomats crew — Cam, Juelz Santana, and the overall group all released projects there.\n\nPurple Haze came at the very tail end of Roc-a-fella’s golden age. It has Cam at the absolute peak of his absurdist rhyming powers, keeping computers ‘puting and knocking out eight-syllable multis about Paris Hilton like it was nothing. During the Purple Haze era, it was Cam’s world, and we were all just lucky to be living in it.\n\nRihanna - 'Good Girl Gone Bad' (2007)\n\nRihanna’s first two projects were full of Caribbean sounds and ballads. But when her third album came along, she needed a change. Riri wanted to go \"uptempo,\" and history shows that was the right choice. Good Girl Gone Bad began the singer’s transformation into the megastar we know today. It spawned five singles and two separate quickie tie-in albums (Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded and Good Girl Gone Bad: The Remixes).\n\n\"Umbrella\" was the way forward. Rihanna had a No. 1 record prior, but she’d never made a sensation like this. The song (with a guest verse by then-Def Jam president Jay-Z) not only made it to the top slot, it also won a GRAMMY and was undeniably the song of the summer. The album also contained the sensation \"Don’t Stop the Music,\" a track that kickstarted the EDM/pop hybrid that dominated the late aughts. Without Good Girl Gone Bad, it’s safe to say we’d be living in a very different, Fenty-less world.\n\nRead more: Songbook: The Ultimate Guide To Rihanna's Reign, From Her Record-Breaking Hits To Unforgettable Collabs\n\nFrank Ocean - 'Channel Orange' (2012)\n\nOne could fill a whole blurb about Channel Orange simply by quoting the extreme praise it received. \"A singular achievement in popular culture.\" \"Landed with the crash and curiousness of a meteor.\" Two days after its release, Pitchfork was already saying that it \"feels like a classic.\"\n\nAnd yet, somehow even that kind of acclaim doesn’t do the album justice. You really had to be there when it came out, when Frank looked into his soul and, in doing so, connected deeply with so many listeners\n\nRead more: Frank Ocean Essentials: 10 Songs That Embody The Elusive Icon's R&B Genius\n\n\"Channel Orange is the most concentrated version of 2012 in 2012 so far,\" wrote Sasha Frere-Jones at the time, in one of the most dead-on statements about the album. It expressed the contradictions we all lived in. Its fragmentation mirrored the social media that was beginning to take over all of our lives. Ocean left bits of his biography scattered throughout the album, but they almost didn’t matter. He was speaking for all of us, in the way only great artists can.\n\nA Guide To New York Hip-Hop: Unpacking The Sound Of Rap's Birthplace From The Bronx To Staten Island\n\nPRIDE & Black Music Month: Celebrating LGBTQIA+ & Black Voices"
