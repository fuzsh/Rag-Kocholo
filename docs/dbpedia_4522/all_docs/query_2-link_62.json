        "text": "I don't think rap (or the tagged hip hop) is overrated. There is some really good hip hop around, really good rap verses as well. For instance I really love this track, both the instrumental side and the flow are amazing!\n\nspotify:track:7koDkpPn92SL8RmD0CkGVv:small\n\nThe explicitness is kind of part of the genre for me already. I obviously don't care much about the 'i have a lot of [redacted], I [redacted] them daily; got lots of cash and i drink guccy coffee' lyrics\n\nBut at the same time I don't care about lyrics quite as much as I care about the sound in general, so I don't mind the cursewords. I do listen to music with rather horrible lyrics, but they have a great instrumental side : )\n\nAbout the mainstream line... I don't care about most of stuff that's going on in mainstream. I definitely don't seem to have any liking towards the currently popular pop rap content, Travis Scott, Moneybagg Yo, Lil Uzi Vert and so on. There is some interesting content under all that as well, but most of the time I don't enjoy what I hear.\n\nThey're lacking something I'm looking for in a song. A flow? Some great choices in beat-making? I might not like the some of the vocals that much either.\n\nLyrics are again pretty much a secondary thing and I've heard tracks that in my opinion suck having a really great lyrical content.. But I've already done my decision on not coming back to the track.\n\nI don't think there is an overrated genre, because most of the time when people talk about a genre being overrated, I've noticed they're either been annoyed to death by the mainstream selection of it, or have had poor experience with fans of the genre (kpop in my case).\n\nMainstream might be positively rubbish, but what lies under is sometimes quite stunning\n\n@G_unknown\n\nGreat point. I disagree though; everything popular is overrated to someone. Kind of a useless observation though. That \"hive mind\" makes up its own and for those on the outside ( ), th'only things to do are either kowtow or carry on.\n\nI don't know much about the genre so take it with a grain of salt when i lament that, despite Eminem's consistent performance (above and beyond), it's just a shame that we went backwards, into mumbling. With duets like Wu-Tang & Texas, sure, rap can be diverse. No music is more diverse than \"metal\" though, for the fact there are so many sub-genres, often bands playing the same kind of music call it something completely different.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/0KEWB5mJjhaufKR2nJKntO?si=nhxjl_BGQ1O82fsiGfFAIw\n\nSo i'll echo MadmanOnWheels and suggest popular music consumers try something different. I would offer the counterpoint to this thread that \"Metal is underrated.\" Just as useless a statement.\n\nWe all have our own tongues; dont let \"tastemakers\" dull.. because ears are mouths i guess."
