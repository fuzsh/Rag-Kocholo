The “Gin And Juice” rapper will join the broadcast team to assist in reporting for the Olympic Games this summer on-site. The Olympic Primetime Show will begin on July 26.\n\nThe excitement has already hit the rapper as he posted a photo of himself dancing in front of the Eiffel Tower.\n\n“New year mood,” Snoop captioned the video. “Paris 2024 Olympics. C u this summer. Official.”\n\n“I grew up watching the Olympics and am thrilled to see the incredible athletes bring their A-game to Paris. It’s a celebration of skill, dedication, and the pursuit of greatness,” Snoop said in a statement. “We’re going to have some amazing competitions and, of course, I will be bringing that Snoop style to the mix. It’s going to be the most epic Olympics ever, so stay tuned, and keep it locked. Let’s elevate, celebrate, and make these games unforgettable, smoke the competition, and may the best shine like gold. Peace and Olympic LOVE, ya dig?”\n\nThis is not the first time Snoop has brought his talents to the international stage. He previously worked with NBC four years ago for the Olympics in Tokyo with Kevin Hart.\n\n“Snoop is already an Olympic gold medal commentator, generating tens of millions of views for his highlights commentary on Peacock of the dressage competition during the Tokyo Olympics,” Molly Solomon — executive producer and president, NBC Olympics Production — said in a statement. “That performance alone has earned Snoop a job as our Special Correspondent in Paris. We don’t know what the heck is going to happen every day, but we know he will add his unique perspective to our re-imagined Olympic primetime show.”\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics will take place July 26 through Aug. 11.\n\nSnoop Dogg: 5 Brands You (Might) Have Not Known He Owns\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
