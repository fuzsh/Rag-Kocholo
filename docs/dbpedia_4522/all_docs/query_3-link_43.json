        "text": "Special NBC Olympics correspondent Snoop Dogg has been all over the Games, carrying the torch, getting a swim lesson from Michael Phelps, traveling by bus and train with the U.S. men’s basketball team.\n\n“Man, this is a grind out here,” Snoop told NBC’s Mike Tirico on Wednesday's prime-time Paris Games broadcast. “But I’m having so much fun.”\n\n“Mike, I may be the MVP of the Olympics, just saying,” Snoop said.\n\nStream every moment and every medal of the 2024 Paris Olympics on Peacock.\n\nSnoop joined the men's basketball team on its bus and train journey down to Lille, where group phase games are being played.\n\nIt’s only natural that the hip-hop icon would play music while traveling with some of the best NBA players in America who are now in the Olympics. But Father Time waits for no one.\n\nHe at first played the “Super Fly” soundtrack, a classic by Curtis Mayfield released in 1972.\n\n“LeBron, naturally, nodded his head, because he understands old school,” Snoop said.\n\n“But I had to switch it up, I had to put on some rap, because [22-year-old Timberwolves player] Anthony Edwards was sitting right next to me, and he’s not moving. Let me get him to move,” Snoop said.\n\nSnoop said that even though the men’s basketball players are on competing teams in the NBA, “I felt a lot of brotherhood, of camaraderie. I felt them ego-checking themselves at the door.”"
