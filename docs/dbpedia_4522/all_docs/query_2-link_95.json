        "text": "FO·MO\n\nˈfōmō/\n\nnoun\n\ninformal\n\nanxiety that an exciting or interesting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on a social media website.\n\n“I realized I was a lifelong sufferer of FOMO”\n\nUrban dictionary definition: The fear that if you miss a party or event you will miss out on something great.\n\nMy definition: DON’T MISS THE EVENT.\n\nLuckily, I’m here to provide you with all things you’ve missed, in this popping city of Los Angeles. My name is Shirley Ju, and I live, breathe, sleep Hip Hop. Coming from the Bay, I grew up to the hyphy movement. That being said, turning up is all I know. This will be a weekly recap of the dope events that I myself felt like I couldn’t miss, and you guys wish you were at.\n\nWednesday, December 21\n\nMovies are life. I genuinely enjoy going to the movie theaters, and getting out of the house (apartment). I hadn’t seen my brother in a minute, so he took priority tonight. We were hanging out. He really wanted to see Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. We decide to rock, paper, scissors and I gave him a little warning that I slay at that game. Confidence is key.\n\nI won. We were seeing La La Land. This movie received raving reviews, including six Golden Globe nominations. That’s a lot, and I vouch for them all. This film is a musical, so if that’s not your steez, you may want to pass. It stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, who are both phenomenal. How can you be so good at acting and Broadway? Leave some talent for the rest of the world.\n\nBeauty and the Beast display at Regal L.A. Live.\n\nWe hit the 7:55 p.m. showing at Regal L.A. Live. This movie theater is glorious, also home to where I saw Doctor Strange in 4DX. The entire theater was packed, every seat was taken. I had my Golden State Warriors blanket. Any movie over two hours means it’s time to get comfy.\n\nRotten Tomatoes puts it best: LA LA LAND tells the story of Mia [Emma Stone], an aspiring actress, and Sebastian [Ryan Gosling], a dedicated jazz musician, who are struggling to make ends meet in a city known for crushing hopes and breaking hearts. Set in modern day Los Angeles, this original musical about everyday life explores the joy and pain of pursuing your dreams.\n\nThis movie is great for anyone pursuing acting, and anyone living in the City of Angels really. I highly recommend it. It’s a love story intertwined with a subtle, hidden message that dreams do come true. It just takes hard work, time, and patience. Need plans for the holidays? It’s perfect for the entire family to enjoy.\n\nThursday, December 22\n\nYou guys, this was the show I’ve been waiting for all month. Literally. Kodak Black at The NOVO in downtown L.A. They announced it shortly after homeboy got released from jail. I was definitely a “Free Kodak Black” advocate. I’ve been a day one fan. I don’t remember which tracks I heard first, but his “No Flockin” freestyle and “SKRT” definitely put him on.\n\nThis was the early show at 8:30 p.m. He sold out his original show, so they added a late show. Make that money. Last time I was here, I saw Hopsin, who didn’t come on until 1 a.m. So grateful we got to hit the early one. Shout out to my girl who was down to roll super last minute. We were turnt. Literally here for Project Baby.\n\nThe venue was definitely packed, and we had wristbands for the pit. Literally, children everywhere. Yes, there were grown folks too (I hope I fit that category), but man. These kids knew all the words haha. It was for sure all ages. This was my first Snapchat of the night, and I unintentionally caught him at the perfect time saying, “I don’t smoke broccoli no more, I smoke cantaloupe.”\n\nI definitely tried hard to find a cantaloupe emoji, who knew with this new Apple iOS update. Fail. A couple days later, my homeboy hits me with it. It does exist! Smh. If you don’t follow Hip Hop, there was this whole fiasco on who originated the “broccoli” term. Kodak called out Lil Yachty and D.R.A.M., which of course made headlines. Then comes E-40 out of nowhere, who shits on everyone. As he should. That’s the OG right there.\n\nShout out to Kodak for the RTs (retweets if you’re not up-to-date). This made my night. I actually take time to sift through my videos and post the best one. Trimming, writing a caption, hashtags. . . it’s a process. “Skrilla” was too turnt. Right when I started recording, someone spilled beer all over me, and I didn’t even care.\n\nOther favorites he performed were “Can I,” “Like Dat,” and “Lockjaw” featuring French Montana, which is top five songs of 2016 for me. I don’t know what it is, but I just vibe to that record so hard. At the end, Kodak spit a freestyle acapella that had everyone quiet. He went in. He closed out with his verse on “Plug” with Rich The Kid. Too lit.\n\nI gave in to seeing Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. I was honestly on such a high from the show, you could get me to do anything. The early show, again, was too clutch. My brother hit me that there was a 10:40 showing in 4DX at Regal L.A. Live right next door. That’s about when the show ended. Perfection.\n\nMan, the moment I sat down, I low key started freaking out. The air blowing right at my head and seats moving perfectly in sync with the actions in the movie was all too much. I got used to it after a while. . . (not really). The 4DX (the X stands for experience) definitely makes it hard for anyone to fall asleep.\n\nI honestly can admit I wasn’t following the movie the entire two hours and 18 minutes but hey, it was entertaining. That says a lot. The film itself was extremely well done, and the scenes of landscape were beautiful. My friend’s status was on point: the last three minutes were the best part of the entire movie. It’s pretty epic.\n\nThis scene also ties this into the rest of the Star Wars saga. Not a Star Wars fan, but here for it.\n\nChristmas in the Park in San Jose, CA.\n\nFriday, December 23\n\nHome sweet home. I touch down in rainy San Jose this afternoon. I was fearful for my life that I would freeze this time around, but that happens every trip. Tonight was Christmas in the Park with my best friend from home. We went last year and decided it is now a tradition. No rain, cold, or exhaustion would stop me. She tried to bail but I wouldn’t allow it. This is what happens when you’re in a committed friendship with me.\n\nSanta’s Snack Shack has all the goodies.\n\nThis is exactly what it sounds like. Per their website, it’s an annual holiday tradition that takes place in the heart of Downtown San Jose at the Plaza de Cesar Chavez. It’s honestly the perfect outing for the holidays. Each year, the two-acre park is transformed into a holiday fantasy with over 60 musical and animated exhibits, glittering lights and the 60-foot Community Giving Tree.\n\nThe main attraction.\n\nAnd it’s free. Game changer, I know. It’s actually a non-profit organization, so all proceeds and donations go to charity. So great. I love a good cause. They are notorious for their epic hot chocolate topped with a mountain of whipped cream and a souvenir snowman. They’ve got a whole station dedicated to this drink.\n\nOne of the many adorable displays.\n\nYou can walk through the park fairly quick, and we did because we parked in 30-minute parking. No one was checking, but we were paranoid. Luckily, this isn’t L.A. where tickets are given a minute after your meter expires. The Bay is a little more relaxed. I always notice the change of pace when I come up. L.A. is definitely the fast lane.\n\nThis life-size ornament is new this year.\n\nBut anyways. There’s so much to look at as you stroll through the park. Christmas trees, exhibits, couples taking pictures, families taking pictures, people asking you to take pictures of them in front of the tree. . . guilty. If you come early enough (and if you have a kid), you can even sit on Santa’s lap.\n\nSan Jose Sharks doghouse.\n\nMy girl is an animal lover and loves the San Jose Sharks, so we had a moment with this doghouse. It’s adorable. Also had a moment getting hyphy to all the lit Bay Area radio stations on the drive back. They really played “Thizzle Dance” by Mac Dre though. The holidays are lit.\n\nSaturday, December 24\n\nMerry Christmas Eve! From Carmel. If you’re wondering where this is, I am too. I passed out on the two-hour drive over here. My dad really wanted to take a trip to this Highlands Inn – Hyatt Residence Club. It was recommended from some of his business colleagues. I was hesitant at first because I don’t have the best relationship with my parents, but this was going to be some major R&R. Plus, my brother was here.\n\nPulling up here reminded me too much of my trip to Costa Rica. Except this was not out of the country and the roads were paved. The hotel is known for its epic ocean views overlooking the Big Sur Coast.\n\nChristmas at Highlands Inn in Carmel, CA.\n\nThe minute I entered the lobby, I hear voices of carolers and joyful Christmas music. I walk in a little further and find three carolers by the Christmas tree belching their heart out, in full costume. The tree was lit, though. I went further to walk into the restaurant overlooking the vast ocean. It was literally breathtaking. I’ll be snapping a pic in the day for you guys tomorrow.\n\nThis place was ridiculously crowded when we pulled up. I can definitely see this being busy for them. It’s such a perfect getaway and the rooms are equipped with a full kitchen so you can cook a nice dinner with the family. Of course, mine came with Chinese take out. Smh.\n\nI had time to kill before dinner so I hit up the fitness center. The main goal in this was to listen to Dom Kennedy’s new album Los Angeles Is Not For Sale: Vol. 1 that just dropped. I’ve been hearing negative feedback, which made me sad. I’m a huge fan of Dom’s. To be honest, I was torn. There was one track I really didn’t fuck with (“T P O”) but the others weren’t so terrible. That P-Lo feature had me hyped.\n\nFireplace in the main lodge.\n\nThis fireplace in the main lodge was beyond cozy. We stopped by later to get me some decaf tea. The server at the bar lounge was beyond generous when I had inquired for some. I didn’t think they would hand it over for free. Bless up.\n\nViews from… our balcony.\n\nSunday, December 25\n\nMerry Christmas!! I always try to imagine how dope it would be if Santa Claus was real. Like really, truly. It would give the world an incentive on being good and landing on the “Nice” list. But anyways. The holidays means catching up on sleep on my end. We stayed in bed until 12 p.m. This never happens.\n\nEntrance to the 17-mile drive tour around Pebble Beach.\n\nAdventures in Carmel. Of course, my touristy self went to seek the dopest spot we could go to. I’ll probably never come back here. We decided to hit this 17-mile drive through Pebble Beach, which includes a bunch of amazing viewpoints. Service was spotty so the map was our lifesaver. Again, major Costa Rica vibes, but I notice it’s a little less green.\n\nThe Lone Cypress Tree standing strong at 300 years old.\n\nThis Lone Cypress Tree was definitely popping. It was the main attraction on this excursion. We pull up to see an overflow of people taking pictures (and selfies). This tree is 300 years old.\n\nThis view had me in my feelings. I could spend all day here just soaking in nature. It’s truly something else. We don’t get this back in L.A.\n\nSeals at the Cypress Viewpoint.\n\nOur next spot was the Cypress Viewpoint. Look at these damn seals. They are living! Just sprawled out on the sand. Incredible.\n\nThe Bird Rock where all the birds were perched.\n\nThis was the Bird Rock stop. My brother captured a much better photo, so he gets the credit. “Birds on my timeline, call it Twitter.” Cue Kodak Black’s “Skrilla.” That show was too good.\n\nAlso my brother sent this to me while I was right next to him. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas from Carmel. Burrrr."
