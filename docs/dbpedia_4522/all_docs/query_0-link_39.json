        "text": "Hip-hop insiders said yesterday that the investigation into the Murder Inc. label and its brash mogul, Irv Gotti, will involve separating fact from fiction in an industry of blurs, where the songs often read like police blotters.\n\nFederal agents and the police raided the Eighth Avenue offices of Mr. Gotti, 31, on Friday morning, investigating his relationship with a convicted Queens drug dealer, Kenneth McGriff, 42, who is known as Supreme on the Hollis streets where he and Mr. Gotti grew up.\n\nMr. McGriff went to prison for 10 years after his 1988 arrest on federal narcotics conspiracy charges, and was arrested on Dec. 28 on federal firearms charges.\n\nMr. Gotti brought artists like Ja Rule, Ashanti and DMX to Island Def Jam records, a part owner of Murder Inc., and is seen by many as a standout -- even in an industry of I'm-badder-than-you braggadocio.\n\n''Irv is a great producer who turns labels in, who is a little confused about which direction to take with stardom,'' said Antoine Clark, publisher of F.E.D.S. magazine, which profiles rappers and drug dealers alike.\n\nPhone messages left for the spokeswoman for Murder Inc. yesterday were not answered. A spokesman and a spokeswoman at Def Jam would not comment.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
