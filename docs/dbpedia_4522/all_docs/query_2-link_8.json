        "text": "Ancient description: Knows not but still believes that he knows\n\nView of Women: Property to govern and discipline\n\nStrength of conversation on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being superb: 7-8\n\nPrinciples: Strong. Difficult to impossible to compromise, unless betrayed.\n\nBrain Function: Moderate to good\n\nMind Energy: Good to excellent\n\nPercent of male population: Roughly 30%\n\nCONNECTION TO THE UNIVERSE\n\nLevel 3 Mindsets are governed by the second primal realm of Conquest. This powerful and merciless realm represents the heart of the male mind, receiving its energy from the Sun’s nuclear core. Male Mindsets governed by this volatile realm are bound to very powerful universal principles and codes of conduct that they must follow here on earth. Part of their earthly requirements is to ensure that others follow these universal laws as well.\n\nThe realm of Conquest also bestows upon Level 3s a significant amount of inner-confidence, courage and the ability to sense primal energy (or the lack thereof) in others. However, unlike some of the more enlightened male Mindsets, a Level 3’s primal calling here on earth is not to lead the masses.\n\nThere is nothing more important to today’s Level 3 than sex, money, authority and respect. Acquiring and maintaining these commodities fuels their drive. This makes a Level 3 fierce, strong-minded and very street smart. However, he can also be selfish, unpredictable and extremely dangerous.\n\nLevel 3s in Antiquity: Historically, the role of a Level 3 Mindset was to advance and enforce the will of the universe on earth (as provided to them by the more enlightened male Mindsets). These were the soldiers, mercenaries and Medjay of the ancient world who marched into battle to convert the opposition, acquire and defend territory. They were the gladiators who battled criminals, ferocious animals and other gladiators for sport.\n\nToday’s Level 3 Mindset: Level 3s prefer the risks and rewards of the streets over the security of employment. For this reason, of all the male Mindsets, Level 3s are most likely to acquire some sort of criminal record at some point in life.\n\nShortly after puberty is when this powerful realm of Conquest begins taking over, compelling these Mindsets to begin their primal quest for dominion and respect. This is why most Level 3s begin finding structured education unfulfilling at the junior high or high school level and why many begin choosing the streets as an alternative.\n\nLevel 3s rarely attend college, unless by way of an athletic scholarship. But because of their intensity and heart, when they do play sports they are usually star athletes.\n\nLevel 3 Mindsets have a very powerful connection to the merciless realm of Conquest. This combustible realm is a part of the Sun’s nuclear core and relays its divine communications to the environment here on earth for male beings connected to the realm to receive and follow. Therefore, Level 3s must maintain an active connection to the environment around them to receive these instructions, satisfy the realm and feel productive.\n\nWhen Level 3s do work they prefer working outdoors or with their hands rather than in an office or around lots of people. They also prefer professions that test their physical attributes, courage or creativity, such as construction, manufacturing, culinary, mechanical, the military or professional sports.\n\nThese male Mindsets also do well in professions that allow them to propagate their strict and strait forward principles and codes of conduct, such as the music industry or performing arts.\n\nReligion: Perhaps surprisingly, the vast majority of Level 3s do believe in a higher power. However, these Mindsets need a religion that will appease their aggressive nature, dark outlook and need for authority. Therefore, Level 3s rarely attend traditional church. Because most Level 3s are somewhat secretive about their darker spiritual viewpoints, their spiritual path can be a solitary one, comprised of learning from whatever books, videos or other information they stumble across. However, once they allow you into their inner circle, they can be very vocal about these beliefs.\n\nThese male Mindsets can surprise you with their knowledge of non-traditional or extreme religious philosophy and can make some intriguing arguments to justify them. Although it is rare, Level 3s can adopt satanic beliefs or practice witchcraft.\n\nDark advice on a Level 3 and religion: It is very important that you find out what this Mindset’s religious viewpoints are to see if they are harmonious with yours before an emotional attachment happens. If he feels that his religious viewpoints are too dark for your taste, he may keep them a secret until an emotional connection has formed. So come across as open minded and curious on religion as you can early on to make him feel comfortable and open up to you.\n\nView of women: Level 3 Mindsets take a very practical approach to women that tends to coincide with their age and financial stability. For those Level 3s who are young and perhaps still trying to find their way in life, the primary purpose of a female is to satisfy their ferocious sexual appetite and possibly aide them in their survival.\n\nThese male Mindsets don’t offer much in the way of emotions or love to the women in their lives, but they do offer a great amount of guidance and protection, which can feel just as powerful as love. This is especially true when it comes to the women in their family, such as their mothers, sisters and daughters. In fact, of all the male Mindsets, you do not want to mistreat or abuse the female relatives of a Level 3. These male Mindsets will go to prison to avenge even the slightest transgression against a female relative or daughter.\n\nAs Level 3s get older and more mature, they usually prefer to ally with a main female; usually a girlfriend or baby’s mother, who has gained their respect by understanding their dark outlook and possibly helping to further their darker agendas. These alliances can be very powerful, complicated and lifelong. Although many Level 3s do eventually settle down with one woman, overall, they are not monogamous men.\n\nBrain vs. Mind: Level 3 Mindsets have a very powerful connection to the universe, which is the mind. It is from this stellar realm that divine communications are sent to all male beings with a connection to the realm. These divine communications manifest in the form of sound principles and codes of conduct and the acute ability to sense primal energy in others. These divine communications bestow upon Level 3s powerful mind energy as well.\n\nHowever, these male Mindsets also have sound brain function (intelligence) and can surprise you with their ability to learn and reason. It’s just that the divine communications sent to them by the realm of Conquest makes them so aware of so much on a primal level that the vast majority of Level 3s fail to take advantage of their brain function in order to think on an even higher level. This is why ancient wisdom refers to this Mindset as, “one who know not but still believes that he knows”.\n\nStrength of conversation: A Level 3s conversation reflects strong principles, bold ideas and, in some instances, dark, antisocial philosophy. However, these male Mindsets are highly observant, read and listen a lot and can craft a conversation to fit just about anybody’s outlook as they search for weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Their dark yet liberating outlook on life and straightforward approach to dealing with situations can be very appealing to people—especially women—who are fed up with their current situations or in need of guidance.\n\nThese Mindsets are not afraid to look a female in the eyes and ask the deep, penetrating and occasionally offensive questions that most men don’t have the courage to ask. They are equally as unflinching when defending their line of questioning and rarely apologetic. Although most females can find some of a Level 3’s remarks rude and unnecessary, many are attracted to the fact that they have the balls to say what they say and can become attracted to them and their viewpoints for this reason.\n\nThis is because Level 3s are able to see beyond the facades of what women look like, do or say and into a dark inner world where the real them may be lost, insecure or searching for answers that faith, career, beauty or an education cannot provide. In a Level 3s dark world, women all crave guidance from a man bold enough to offer it.\n\nDark advice on a Level 3’s conversation: You must be careful not to reveal too many negative life experiences to this Mindset, especially early on! How men may have taken advantage of you in the past or the ways in which you may have supported men in previous relationships should remain a mystery! Keep in mind, the merciless realm of Conquest governs a Level 3s outlook. One of the main functions of this indifferent realm is to rid the planet of weakness so that the planet will remain strong. Level 3s were placed here on earth to carry out this dark duty.\n\nIf your past gives this Mindset the impression that you are weak, he will likely attempt to exploit these perceived weaknesses sooner or later. The only way to avoid this is to come across as strong. That is the only way he will respect you and keep you in his inner circle reserved only for the strong.\n\nConcepts: For the most part, Level 3s do not believe in the concepts that govern western perception the way we are taught to believe in them. In fact, these male Mindsets tend to believe in them in reverse, embracing many of the negative concepts, such as crime and violence while rejecting many of the positive concepts, such as love, compassion, tolerance and remorse.\n\nThese Mindsets also have problems with authority concepts who may interfere with how they attempt to satisfy the realm of Conquest out in the streets, such as the police officer. However, Level 3s do embrace some key positive concepts conducive to a successful relationship, such as children, family and fatherhood.\n\nPrinciples and codes of conduct: A primary function of the second primal realm of Conquest is to enforce the laws of the universe here on earth. This is accomplished by way of the male Mindsets connected to the realm. To ensure that nothing compromises this duty, all Level 3s are bound to strict principles and codes of conduct designed to keep them true to these divine stellar communications and to ensure that the people they come in contact with stay true to them as well.\n\nThese Mindsets will also embrace earthly principles and codes of conduct learned through their upbringing, faith, education and career. However, these earthly principles and codes of conduct must be harmonious with the universal principles and codes of conduct that they are bound to. If not, a Level 3 will reject them. It is virtually impossible for a Level 3 to abandon these universal principles and codes of conduct for any reason. This is because their connection to the second primal realm of Conquest, from which these universal principles and codes of conduct originate, is too powerful.\n\nRelationship strengths: A Level 3 who can stay out of jail and keep a good job can be a stable provider and great father (to the children of the woman he remains allied with). If you crave a man who can see beyond your beauty, body or accomplishments, and get to know the real you inside, this Mindset will not disappoint you. If you are looking for strength and direction from a man then a Level 3 is for you.\n\nA Level 3 is a man of principles, which makes him very consistent personality wise. To know him yesterday is to know him tomorrow. He is only a follower of his principles so you don’t have to worry about his friends leading him down paths that he does not wish to take. Of all the male Mindsets, a Level 3 is the most capable protector and guardian. This Mindset will stop at nothing to defend the people who are allied with him.\n\nRelationship weaknesses: This male Mindset all about sex, sex and more sex and is not monogamous by nature (although they can become monogamous with age). His primal need to connect with the environment around them can create a love for the streets and possibly illicit activities, which can be taxing on a relationship.\n\nOf all the male Mindsets, a Level 3 is most likely to spend his life in and out of jail. They can also be verbally and physically abusive. A Level 3 is not into love or marriage as much as he is into life-long alliances. Although they will get married, if you’re looking for the proverbial white house and picket fence type of marriage with this Mindset, he will likely disappoint you.\n\nIdeal woman: A Level 3 does not respect weak-minded women. However, this Mindset is not into dominant women either. So his ideal woman should be strong-minded, a little street smart yet willing to let the man take the lead. She should also be at least indifferent to many of the positive concepts that most women adore, such as love and marriage. She should also have a dark side or at least be sympathetic towards some of the darker realities that govern life and the streets.\n\nShe must be able to stay true to her core principles and let it be known early in the relationship that she can and will walk away from him should he attempt to lead her off her path. A Level 3 will try. This should establish the necessary level of respect to establish a strong alliance with him.\n\nThis Mindset and sex: This Mindset must be in control in the bedroom at all times. He likes to teach his woman how to please him and has staunch principles to justify what he is and is not into sexually. This male Mindset is known for rough sex and is also good at compelling a woman to perform sexual acts that she is unaccustomed to. Most Level 3s are very good in bed and masterful at pushing a woman’s sexual boundaries to unimaginable heights. However, many can be indifferent when it comes to exceeding their normal level of performance to please a woman. Many women find themselves satisfied by a Level 3’s dominance, even if his sexual performance is subpar.\n\nAfter sex: After sex, a Level 3s primal need for intimacy gives way to a primal need to connect to his environment and satisfy the realm of Conquest. So he will likely crave the streets or the outdoors. But if the sex is stellar and the mental connection strong, he shall return. When he does stick around after sex, he can become distant and even grumpy as the divine communications from the powerful realm of Conquest commands his attention.\n\nWhen he is in a talkative mood during this state of consciousness, he usually enjoys discussing principles and code of conduct while probing his woman’s mind for weakness and teaching her how to be mentally stronger. If the respect and harmony is mutual during these intimate moments, a Level 3 can become quite docile, comical and even playful.\n\nDark side of the Level 3: This Mindset can smile, laugh and seem compassionate, but at the end of the day, no female is beyond sacrificing to further a goal or satisfy a primal need. When a level 3 accepts you into his dark world, he expects you to stay true to him and his causes for as long as he chooses to keep you around, married or not.\n\nIn rare instances, he is not beyond harming or even killing a woman he feels has betrayed or crossed him. So be very careful should you tick this Mindset off."
