        "text": "EUGENE, Ore. — Before the Olympic track and field trials started on June 21, Noah Lyles had never met Snoop Dogg. But now, America’s fastest man is … friends with one of the greatest rappers of all time? Maybe?\n\n“I haven’t met the guy,” Lyles said after his opening 100-meter heat, laughing. “My mom met him before I did.”\n\nSnoop Dogg, 52, was in Eugene last week working for NBC, one of dozens of celebrity commentators who NBC hopes will make the 2024 Paris Olympics accessible, and appealing, to a wider audience.\n\nSo far, it seems like it's working: 5.2 million viewers tuned in during prime time Sunday, track and field's largest TV audience in 12 years.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nAt Hayward Field, Snoop sat next to Lyles’ mom, Keisha Caine Bishop, during the 100 meter heats and seemed particularly enthralled by the steeplechase event.\n\nFormer Olympian Kara Goucher, who an NBC analyst for all the distance events, had to explain the water barrier to Snoop live during the first round of the men’s steeplechase, a comical moment for all involved. He also met a handful of athletes, including 16-year-old sprinting sensation Quincy Wilson, who said it was cool to meet a legend, even if he’s not super familiar with his music.\n\nOther celebrities joining the NBC broadcast throughout the Paris Olympics include Kelly Clarkson, Leslie Jones, Peyton Manning and Jimmy Fallon, among others. On Wednesday, NBC announced that Colin Jost of Saturday Night Live fame would help cover Olympic surfing, which takes place this summer in Tahiti.\n\nWhile some of the celebrity commentators might seem to be an odd fit for the Olympics, Snoop has a history of being present at major sporting events. One of his children, Cordell Broadus, briefly played football for UCLA before stepping away to work in fashion. In May, the Arizona Bowl was officially re-named the Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl presented by Gin & Juice. (It’s scheduled to take place December 28, 2024.) Snoop also provided commentary alongside actor Kevin Hart during the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nIn Eugene, Lyles was asked where he keeps his cache of track medals won over the years at various meets. He said all his medals are “constantly on the move,” and he didn’t actually know where each one was presently.\n\n“My mom might have a few, my girlfriend might have one,” he said.\n\nDoes that mean Snoop might have one now too? Would his mom have shared it with the rapper? Lyles laughed.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised,” he said."
