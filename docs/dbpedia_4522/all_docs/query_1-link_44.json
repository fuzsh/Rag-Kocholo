        "text": "Picking your rapper name isn’t as easy as just writing down your initials and saying how good you think you are. Unless you’re Ja Rule, that is. Getting it right can make all the difference in terms of credibility, recognition, and not sounding silly, because for every Ghostface Killah there’s an MC Pooh.\n\nLike Ghostface, the names on this list do it right too, drawing from hip-hop tradition, personal history, and cultural touchstones. But before we tell you how they got their hip-hop pseudonyms, can you guess who they are from the clues below?\n\nRick Ross\n\nIt’s no surprise that iconic cinematic Miami drug lord Tony Montana inspired a wave of rap-alikes, including French Montana and (duh) Scarface of the Geto Boys. But Rick Ross took inspiration from a more true-to-life figure, namely Freeway Rick Ross, the charismatic drug dealer who it's said kickstarted the '80s crack boom in Miami.\n\nBorrowing the names of famous felons is obviously a quick way to get some gangsta cachet. 50 Cent’s handle was taken from equal opportunities thug Kelvin '50 Cent' Martin, who would famously rob anyone \"even for 50 cents\".\n\nOn leaving prison in 2009, Freeway Rick Ross attempted to sue rapping Ross (who served time on the other side of the bars as a correctional officer) for appropriating his name. But Ross’s suit was ultimately dismissed, and thus Rick Ross continues to use the Rick Ross name with impunity. If you catch our drift.\n\nRelated\n\nKid Rock\n\nAs a teenager in the ‘80s, Bob Ritchie escaped his turbulent home life by sofa surfing in the homes of his school friends, whose families fed and sheltered him. The only way he could pay them back was by DJing impromptu neighbourhood parties, and donating the $2 cover charge from each guest to his host family.\n\nAs one of the few caucasians at his inner Detroit high school, Ritchie’s turntable skills were deemed even more remarkable than his Bart Simpson flat-top. Ritchie’s friends were amused by incredulous reactions like, ‘Did you see that white kid rock?’ after his shows, and he started using the name Kid Rock on flyers as an affectionate gag.\n\nRelated\n\nIce T\n\nThe artist born Tracey Morrow took on the Ice name during a brief spell as a pimp, following a list of felonious careers that reads like a criminal LinkedIn skills profile.\n\nHis Ice T identity is a tribute to pimp-turned-author Iceberg Slim, who in 1967 literally wrote the book on the trade, fittingly enough titled Pimp.\n\nOther rappers named after their shady pre-music careers include former dealer Pusha T (as in \"push a ton of that s*** that make ya nose run\", as he rapped) and babyfaced G-funkster Crime Boss. The world now eagerly awaits the arrival of MC Digital Marketing Intern and Yung Bailiff.\n\nRelated\n\nChildish Gambino\n\nAs befits his role as futurist rhymesayer, creative polymath Donald Glover is arguably the first rapper named by an algorithm.\n\nDuring a night of drinking with friends, Glover was bestowed his alter ago by an online Wu-Tang Clan name generator, which paired seemingly random words together.\n\nDisplaying all the wisdom and insight that comes with heavy alcohol consumption, the more Glover thought about the name, the more depth it appeared to have. He chose to stick with it even after sobering up the next day.\n\nInterestingly, both of the two longest-serving Wu-Tang name generators now return the name Childish Gambino when Glover’s name is entered, meaning one of them has sneakily changed their code to try to take credit for this epochal event.\n\nRelated\n\nA$AP Rocky\n\nApart from binding the A$AP Mob like gang colours, and looking cool in Spotify playlists, the A$AP prefix has a deeper meaning for A$AP Rocky, Ferg, Yams, Bari and the rest.\n\nThe initials stand for Always Survive And Prosper, the group’s credo/self-help mantra, conveniently boiled down to a knuckle tattoo-friendly four characters.\n\nIt continues a long tradition of acronyms in rap, embedding extra layers of meaning in the fewest possible strokes. Most famously, these include KRS-One (Knowledge Rules Supreme Over Nearly Everything), and Big K.R.I.T. (King Remembered In Time).\n\nRelated\n\nSnoop Dogg\n\nAdopting dogs might not seem like a source for rap controversy (unless you’re DMX), but Snoop’s use of the Dogg surname caused a lasting feud between Snizzle and '90s Bronx rapper Tim Dog, who claimed the artist previously known as Calvin Broadus had bitten his style.\n\nIn fact, Snoop Dogg had been rap-christened as a youngling by his own mum in reference to the junior G’s love of Charlie Brown cartoons. Mrs Dogg said he watched so much Snoopy he \"was starting to look like him\". The name stuck, although Snoop latter dropped the Y to avoid walking on to Charles Schulz’s trademark turf.\n\nMore recently, but along the same lines, Waka Flocka Flame got his name as a child, thanks to an affinity for The Muppets' Fozzie Bear. Estranged mentor Gucci Mane added the Flocka Flame part later to make him sound less like a children’s party entertainer.\n\nMF Doom\n\nFormerly known as Zen Love X while a member of KMD, MF Doom’s new identity was forged during a period of near-homelessness after the band were dropped from their label following the death of founder member/Doom’s brother Subroc.\n\nInspired by the origin of brooding Fantastic Four antagonist Dr Doom, who was disfigured by a misfiring experiment he blamed on Reed Richards, Doom created the persona while \"recovering from his wounds\" and \"plotting revenge against the industry that deformed him\".\n\nThe MF component stands either for Metal Fingers, in reference to his turntable technique or, depending on Doom’s mood and the wind direction, occasionally for Metal Face, in reference to his trademark chrome mask."
