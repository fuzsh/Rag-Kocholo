        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nHe called his recording studio, in SoHo, the Crack House. He named his record label Murder Inc. He even traded in his real name, Irving Lorenzo, for a Mafia fantasy, taking not just the surname of the late John J. Gotti, the Gambino family don, but also welcoming to his legal team one of the gangster's lawyers, Gerald L. Shargel.\n\nIrv Gotti, 35, often dressed in ivory suits and fedoras in the old-time style and the albums he produced, which earned hundreds of millions of dollars for his label, sometimes showed defiant rappers on their covers toting guns. His affectations, though, were more than mere window dressing, federal prosecutors say, and now, with his brother, Christopher, 38, he has made the journey his rap stars sometimes sing about: from recording room to court.\n\n\"This case,\" said Sean Haran, an assistant United States attorney, \"is about them laundering drug money for one of the biggest drug dealers in New York.\"\n\nTwo of Irv Gotti's best-known artists, Ja Rule and Ashanti, turned up in Federal Court in Brooklyn yesterday to support him and his brother as their trial on charges of money laundering began. There was a vague club-like atmosphere as court officers in navy blazers turned away late arrivals, much like bouncers at the velvet ropes.\n\nThe government claims that, beginning in the late 1990's, the brothers let a longtime friend, Kenneth McGriff, funnel more than $1 million in illicit drug profits through their record label, founded in a partnership with Island Def Jam Music Group. The Gottis claim that even though their association with Mr. McGriff, a drug lord known as Supreme, gave them credibility in the world of hip-hop, their reputations and financial ledgers are clean.\n\nMr. Haran, in his opening remarks, described Mr. McGriff as a wildly successful drug dealer with operations in New York and Baltimore, who helped Irv Gotti start his career a decade ago by providing him with a tainted supply of illicit cash.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
