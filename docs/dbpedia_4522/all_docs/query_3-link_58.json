        "text": "In May 2022, the rapper and serial entrepreneur had purchased a minority stake in Bivouac, a team that’s part of Ice Cube’s BIG3 basketball league, as previously reported by AfroTech.\n\nNow, Snoop Dogg is said to have joined the bidding war for the NHL’s Ottawa Senators, according to The Athletic. He, along with Los Angeles-based entrepreneur Neko Sparks, are hoping to become part owners of the team.\n\nWhile Snoop Dogg may have joined in on the bid, there are other offers on the table as well.\n\nAccording to the Ottawa Sun, actor Ryan Reynolds and the Remington Group are reportedly preparing a $1 billion bid to buy the Ottawa Senators. What’s more, the group is said to have agreed to build a new arena for the team if they win the bid.\n\nAnd this isn’t the first time Reynolds has purchased a sports team. Back in 2020, he bought Welsh soccer club Wrexham FC with actor Rob McElhenney.\n\nThere are six other major bidding groups that are interested in the Senators’ sale, including a bid from Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé. The deadline for groups to place their final bids on the team is on May 15 and will be overseen by Galatioto Sports Partners.\n\nIf successful in their bid, Sparks, Snoop Dogg, and the rest of their group could make history.\n\n“Sparks, who owns a tech firm and a media production company as part of his portfolio, has the ambition of becoming the first Black owner of an NHL franchise. Sparks would be the front person for a consortium that would include between 13 and 15 investors from the United States and Canada. Roughly 75 percent of the ownership group would be comprised of people of colour,” The Athletic previously reported in January 2023.\n\nAccording to Ottawa Sun, “Sparks was reportedly the highest bidder in the first round at more than $900 million.”"
