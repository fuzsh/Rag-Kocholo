        "text": "These are, I think we can all agree, testing times for Britons. Cracks have appeared in previously harmonious communities. Families have been torn down the middle. We are divided, split between those who watch Love Island (ITV2, 9pm, Sunday to Friday) and those who do not.\n\nThis summer has seen my first sojourn to the land of weirdly hairless bodies and Instagram-endorsed dreams. Love Island is, it turns out, the entertainment equivalent of crack cocaine. To immerse yourself in such synapse-sucking froth is to cross a line that cannot be uncrossed. It requires commitment on an absurd scale – an hour or more, six nights a week – to keep up with the bed hopping, the tear-stained confessionals and the curious campfire coupling rituals. And yet I am deliciously, unapologetically hooked.\n\nI have, of course, listened to the carping of its detractors. What does Love Island have to teach us about life, they wail? Why would you want to watch these self-obsessed peacocks when you could spend that time with a book, or with your loved ones, or tortuously pondering future trade relations with the EU. But that would have been to deprive myself of the sweetly blossoming love affair between Dani Dyer, offspring of actor-turned-Brexit analyst Danny, and Jack, an upstanding pen salesman from Orpington. I would have missed watching the preternaturally ripped personal trainer, Adam, working his way around the villa like a dose of herpes, and inadvertently educating the nation on gaslighting. I wouldn’t have seen pseudo-spiritual dim-bulb Eyal tutor Hayley in how to pronounce his name (“Eeeeeeeee-yal?” “No, Aay-yaaaaaal”. “So Eeeeee-yaaaaal?” “No, Aaayaaa ... OK, whatever. Eeeeeyal”) or witnessed the serially shat-upon Laura delivering a blunt apology to Megan: “Our friendship is over. But you’re not a slag.”\n\nAnd don’t try telling me I haven’t learned anything in two months of hothoused carnality. Had I never watched Love Island, I wouldn’t have grasped the bureaucratic nature of modern courtship (“You tick all the boxes,” says absolutely everyone) or known about “nude” evening wear, which may or not be the product of a fashion industry practical joke. I wouldn’t have clocked that sensitive A&E doctor Alex has all the charisma of a pot plant. Indeed, were a pot plant to have been deposited in the villa, he would have delivered the same speech that he’s made about every woman towards whom he feels a disturbing sense of entitlement: “This houseplant has a really nice vibe, and a natural look. I think we’ve made a connection and I can see a lot of potential with this plant so, yeah, I’m excited to see what happens.”\n\nIn the annals of reality TV, Love Island is far from real. Yet there is something to be gleaned here about friendship, race (the most dispiriting element so far has been the sidelining and eventual self-exile of Samira), and the way men and women communicate. This is a place where liars and love rats get called out and prejudices are exposed. Love Island delivers its own brand of justice even while dealing in daft fantasy. Best pull up a sun lounger and enjoy it while it lasts."
