        "text": "MTV did a Biorhythm on Faith Evans and she said that she was working on a track for Pac for \"All Eyez On Me\" which eventually never made the album. She also denied having sex with Pac.\n\nSnoop Doggy Dogg made a tribute song for Pac & Biggie called \"How Many Blessings\" which is not released yet.\n\nIn Snoop Doggy Dogg's house, there is a life-size cardboard cut-out of Tupac with his middle finger up giving the Thug Life Salute.\n\nThe day Tupac recorded \"Smile\" with Scarface they also recorded the unreleased song \"Never Sleep Again\". (This song is Tupac feat. Daz Dillinger and Scarface)\n\n\"I Get Around\" was supposed to be on Digital Underground's album. Shock G wound up giving it to Pac and Digital Underground's label, Tommy Boy, wasn't very happy once it turned out to be such a big hit.\n\nIn a German music show they had Nas in it. They asked him to which rapper he looks up to. At first Nas was like \"you know, I'm more like doin' my own thang\" but when he said \"well, some people might not like me sayin' that I developed lots of respect for Tupac\"\n\n\"Thug Luv\" was just a song that Bizzy, Silk-E-Fine and Tupac were supposed to do but things happened and all of Bone Thugs -n- Harmony came in. Bizzy Bone said that Pac came into the studio, wrote his verse in about 10 minutes and then left because he had to go model for Versace. Then he came back and sang with them all laid back.\n\nTupac had sex with almost all the women during the filming of the X-rated \"How Do U Want It?\" video. He collapsed from exhaustion.\n\nRight before Snoop Doggy Dogg's marriage, he was having doubts about marrying his wife to be since he could basically get any woman he wanted. It was Snoop, Pac, Suge and a few other guys and Snoop told them of his doubts and they told Snoop not to get married and that she was just a bitch like all the other ones. Pac came in and told Snoop the importance of what he had between him and his wife, that she wasn't just another hoe, and that he shouldn't listen to those other guys who were just low thugs that didn't have shit. Snoop took Pac's advice to heart, and is very glad he married his wife.\n\nWhen Tupac was a child and he would get into trouble, his mother would make him sit in the corner and read the 'New York Times', and she would later quiz him on the articles.\n\nIn Bizzy Bone's video for \"When Thugs Cry\", at the end Bizzy is sitting cross-legged and there are pictures flying around him of Tupac, Eazy-E and Biggie.\n\nLil' Kim once said that Bad Boy did a track dissing Tupac but they didn't released it after Tupac \"died\". The song did not feature Biggie; it was only Lil' Kim and Junior M.A.F.I.A.\n\nThe video for \"All 'Bout You\" (Greatest Hits version) that was released in 1998 contains scenes of a new Volkswagen Beatle which was only available since 1998!\n\nAccording to MC Hammer, Tupac told him that he wanted to do free concerts for schools and the only way you could get in was to have a C or better grade average.\n\nTupac did a song for a DJ at KKDA radio in Texas which was just a rap about that radio station. It had the exact beat as Bone Thugs -n- Harmony's song \"Body Rott\". The chorus was something like \"just give me your soul, just give me your soul, give me your soul.\"\n\nAfter Tupac's \"death\" there were rumours that Biggie wanted to do a song called \"Dig Him Up\" dissing Pac by saying that if people really thought Tupac was alive they should dig him up.\n\nWhen Will Smith won a Grammy Award (in 1997 or 1998) he dedicated it to Tupac and Biggie.\n\nEverybody in Afeni's (Tupac's mother) family has been cremated.\n\nSnoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac didn't talk to each other after their last trip to N.Y. together.\n\nThis was because Snoop made a song dissing Death Row called \"Death Row Killaz\". They later were friends again.\n\nAfeni Shakur said that she knew that Tupac would be special from the time he started to grow in her womb because she had four miscarriages before Tupac!\n\nTupac would only sleep for 3 or 4 hours every night. He would wake up before the sun came up and shoot a movie and then immediately go to the studio.\n\nE.D.I. Amin and Kastro of The Outlawz say that the \"Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory\" album was recorded in 7 days. That why it was called that way. They also said that Tupac didn't have a religion but that he believed in God. Kastro said that one of the things Tupac said to him was, \"The only thing that comes to a sleeping man is dreams.\"\n\nThe new Thug Life album (Thug Life Vol.2 The Reunion) will contain 17 songz. 12 songz will feature Tupac. The very last song that Tupac recorded before his death will be on that album and it will be the first single off the album. The song is called \"Thug Redemption\"The album will feature songs like \"From The Cradle To The Grave Pt. 2\", Still Pourin' Out A Little Liqour\" and \"Bure Me a G (remix)\" There are 3 new members, and 2 original members of the group left. The members are Makaveli, Mussolini, Mopreme, Junior Thugg, Shawn-Gotti, & Lil' Gambino. The album will feature guest appearances by Danny Boy, Bizzy Bone, Scarface, K-Ci & JoJo, E40 & Master P. The song that Master P is featured on is not with Tupac, it is a dedication to Tupac and Kevin Miller (Master P's murdered brother) called \"Legends\". They completed 10 songz in the studio with Pac, but when Pac was shot they had two unfinished songz left. Both songz were supposed to contain two verses from both Tupac and Mussolini (a.k.a. Big Syke), but on both songz Pac only got one verse in, so Mussolini had to fill in an extra verse. Mussolini said that Pac left behind a rap notebook full of lyrics. Two songs from that notebook were used on the \"Thug Life Vol.2 The Reunion\" album. Mussolini said that Pac wanted those songz on the album. The second single from that album will probably be called \"2 Deep In This Game\" (feat. K-Ci & Jojo)\n\nThe Cocoa Brovas (f.n.a. Smiff -n- Wesson) were on BET's Rap City and they were talking about the \"One Nation\" album. They said that they stayed at Tupac's house while making the album and it was just cool. They met his mother and his aunt. They, Tupac and The Outlawz used to have waterfights when it was hot. They said they made 6 songz together with Tupac, themselves, Outlawz, Melly Mel, Grandmaster Flash, The Luniz, Outkast and others.\n\nTreach of Naughty By Nature has a tattoo of Tupac.\n\nThe director of \"Gang Related\" once told in an interview that Tupac walked in one day with a bodyguard and was telling the guard to make sure he is watching his back. Tupac told the director that he got a death threat.\n\nAccording to K-Ci and Jojo the video for \"Toss It Up\" was shot the day before Tupac was shot.\n\nIn Vancouver a local DJ did an interview with Big Syke of Thug Life (a.k.a. Mussolini of The Outlawz). The interviewer asked him about the intro to Makaveli (\"Suge shot me!\"). Big Syke said that it scared him as well especially since he had known that Tupac did some minor changes to the intro before it was finally finished. He said that Tupac actually finished the album and then came back to the intro and added a few things. Big Syke said that he thinks that Tupac did mention certain things but that was all he was gonna say about the topic.\n\nAfeni Shakur says that everytime she listen to \"Dear Mama\" she cries. She says it gets deeper and deeper everytime she listens to it.\n\nMickey Rourke (co-star in the movie \"Bullet\" with Tupac) has a special room in his house that is dedicated to his friends who have died. It is a room full of pictures of his friends. He has a small statue of the Virgin Mary on a table and a picture of him with Tupac next to it. He once explained that Tupac was a special friend of his and was there for him during his rough period. He told that he owed his life to Tupac. He said Tupac gave him some good advice on changing his life while they were filming the movie \"Bullet\". He also said how sad he was when he heard of Tupac's death and wanted to continue changing his life for the better because he knew that tupac would have wanted it that way.\n\nAfeni Shakur once told MTV that Tupac knew his time left and that he worked like a 'demon' and that he has about 10 years worth of material that hasn't been released!\n\nThe video for \"I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto\" was filmed in New Mexico. In a newspaper they once had predictions for 1998 and they wrote this about Pac: \"Rumors that slain rapper Tupac Shakur is still alive reach a fever pitch until he emerges from self-imposed seclusion and admits a look-alike was gunned down in his place. His shocking new mission: To rid the world of violence.\"\n\nSomebody said that Tupac was wearing new Penny Hardaway shoes in the \"Toss It Up\" video and in the \"To Live & Die In L.A.\" video it was told he was wearing Air Jordans. Both of these shoes were not available at that time yet. But somebody also told me that celebrities receive new shoes before they hit the stores to promote them.\n\nWhen the FBI investigated Tupac's murder and they asked his mother (Afeni Shakur) for a death certificate and she didn't have it and never got one. They also asked the hospital where Tupac \"died\" and they also didn't have one. (This was reported by radiostation WQHT 97.1 FM in New York)\n\nThere are rumours spreaded by a radiostation that over 500 people sited Tupac in Cuba.\n\nOn a DJ Clue underground mixtape there is a song by Jay-Z called \"Wanted Dead or Alive Pt. 2\". He disses Pac by saying this: \"Makaveli you dis me so I dis you!\" Later on he says \"We need the nigga dead!\"\n\nBig Syke of Thug Life (a.k.a. Mussolini of The Outlawz) was once interviewed on a radio station to promote his solo album. The interview was taken after Tupac's death and the interviewer asked Big Syke where Tupac was. Big Syke replied calmly and just said: \" Don't worry Tupac's still here, he didn't go nowhere!\"\n\nThere are rumours that there is an underground Tupac mixtape that is going around in Detroit, Michigan. It contains several unreleased songz and songz from the upcoming Outlawz & One Nation album. Also on the tape are some Tupac interviews where he says he planned the whole murder and his \"death\". It is called \"The Tupac Suspicion\". Remember that these are only rumours, nobody has confirmed this yet.\n\nHail Mary is I Ain't Mad At Cha Part 2\n\nTo Live & Die In L.A. is California Love Part 2\n\nStrictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... was supposed to be called Troublesome 21.\n\nTupac was supposed to act in Cool Runnings, Higher Learning, Menace II Society and How To Be A Player.\n\nAccording to Daz Dillinger, Tupac made about 700 songs (!!!) at Death Row Records which have not been released yet.\n\nDaz Dillinger himself did more than 120 songs with Tupac. So seven albums or more could be made which only have songs with Daz and Tupac.\n\nKidada Jones, daughter of Quincy Jones, has a tattoo of Tupac on her arm.\n\nTupac shielded Suge Knight from the bullets that were fired on the night of September 7th, 1996 by trying to jump into the back of the car.\n\nSuge Knight, Death Row' is another album that will be released on Death Row soon, and it will feature Snoop Dogg, Dr Dre, DPG and Tupac.\n\nTupac wanted to call his first child Star.\n\nAt the end of the movie about the Bloods street gang called \"This Is For My Dead Homies\", there is a Biggie and Tupac freestyle.\n\nThug Life stands for \"The hate you give little infants, fuck everybody.\"\n\nOutlaw stands for \"Operating under thug laws as warriors.\"\n\nNigga stands for \"Never ignorant, getting goals accomplished.\"\n\nM.O.B. stands for \"Money over bitches.\"\n\nTupac was in the Guiness Book of World records for being the best sold rap artist of all time.\n\nThe original name of 'All Eyez On Me' was 'Euphanasia'"
