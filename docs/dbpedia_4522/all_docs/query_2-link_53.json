        "text": "Last week, it was reported that Jeezy would be filing for divorce from television host Jeannie Mai. The pair were married for two years and have one daughter together named Monaco whom they welcomed in January 2022. According to a source from Entertainment Tonight, they claim the reason the split occurred was a difference in family values.\n\n“They had different views, and each felt like their needs weren’t being completely met,” an insider told the outlet, specifically citing “family expectations” as a potent factor in the divorce.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Jeezy (born Jay Wayne Jenkins) and Mai are already separated.\n\nJeezy is reportedly seeking joint legal custody of their daughter. He is also the father to three other children, Jadarius Jenkins, Shyheim Jenkins, and daughter Amra Nor Jenkins from previous relationships.\n\nThe couple met in 2019 on The Real, the show where Mai was a host for eight seasons alongside Lonnie Love, Adrienne Bailon, and Tamera Mowry for most of the series. The show was canceled in 2022. The pair then got married in 2021. Mai was previously married to Freddy Harteis from 2007-2018.\n\nJeannie Mai Discusses ‘Hot Temper’ Clip Resurfaces\n\nIn a resurfaced clip, Mai said that Jeezy and her would often clash and trigger one another in arguments. She said that due to the “nature of their relationship” she would get called out on her behavior as would he.\n\n“I have a really hot temper. Not a lot of people know this; it’s just something in my family…but I didn’t notice it in myself until I was with Jeezy,” she said on the Lovers & Friends podcast.\n\nShe added that she noticed this trait in herself in her previous relationship with Harris, but it was never brought up to her. Mai also added that she saw it as a generational trait passed down in relationships between her grandparents, her mother, and aunts, and now her and Jeezy. While Mai openly spoke about her temper, it has not been confirmed that this is the reason for their split.\n\nThe Best Hip-Hop Couples Of 2023\n\nAutumn Hawkins is the National Hip-Hop and R&B writer for Beasley Media, currently residing in New Jersey.
