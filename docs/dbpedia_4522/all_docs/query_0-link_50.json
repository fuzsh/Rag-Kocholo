It’s a lot of clown sh-t going on that we could just sit and talk on the phone all day about, but it’s a few issues that we really wanted to lock into [for the video] like police, the president and just life in general.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Snoop and Trump have crossed paths. In 2011, at Comedy Central's roast of Trump, Snoop was a participant who got in some pretty hot burns on pre-president Trump, including a reference to Trump's already-burning political aspirations. (Again, naughty language warning.)\n\nOne note: Snoop's song is actually a reworking of a collaboration between BADBADNOTGOOD and Kaytranada (you can listen to the original here)."
