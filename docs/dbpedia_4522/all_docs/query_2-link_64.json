        "text": "Image via Jesse Taylor\n\nIndependent rap journalists will recommend you new music until their voices give out. Keep it that way by supporting Passion of the Weiss via a subscription to our Patreon.\n\nRon Rogers (aka Jesse Taylor) wishes everyone here could see him.\n\nThe call came from his mom at 8 p.m. on June 16, 2021. In tears, my ex-wife left me a message explaining that our son had been involved in a car accident a few hours earlier. My first thought was that the sadness was unwarranted. It was probably a minor fender bender. It had to be.\n\nI immediately got into my car and started driving to the scene. But before I arrived, his mom told me that the police were telling her that our son was already dead. Then she hung up to speak with an approaching cop. Shocked by the news, I immediately started yelling and screaming long, loud f-bombs. But I kept driving…hoping that somehow what the cops had told her was wrong.\n\nAs soon as I pulled up, a cop asked for my driver’s license and gave me the worst news that a parent can hear: my son was gone. There had been a head-on collision in the small East Bay suburb of Brentwood, on a back road lined with gravel rocks, near the canal that fed water to the cherry trees. For the next several hours, I remained in the streets in frozen shock, screaming into the sky, barely able to stand.\n\nThroughout these moments of obliterating pain, family members arrived to join me. I vividly remember my wife, my son’s step-mom, walking out alone into an open plowed dirt field next to the road. She fell to her knees, palms up, arms spread out wide to her sides and loudly prayed to the sky with anger and tears.\n\nIn only 16 years, my son had already figured out how to be a helping hand and shoulder for those in need: an academic savant named his high school’s AP Student of the Year, and one of the fastest 16-year old distance runners in the country. He was poised for a Stanford or Oregon cross country/track scholarship. He’d helped boost my wife’s confidence with his positive encouragement and upbeat words. Now, his life has been stolen from us. No words can articulate the pain and sorrow.\n\nBut let me do my best to try to honor his memory and share those things that helped me most as I processed the traumatic grief, anger, and sadness. I need to write this for a number of reasons. The first is that I love writing about sports and music, but can’t write again until I write about my son. But the even bigger challenge is answering: “How do you write about something so traumatic as your 16-year-old son and best friend dying?” And what is even the purpose of writing it?\n\nBut I want you to know who my son was. I want to share his story so others can know and feel how special he really was. There is also the hope that maybe this can help others experiencing grief – or who will go through it in the future. That is the point of this article: to tell a remarkable story about how special my son’s life was and to find a way to share what I learned and enduring in my grieving. Maybe it can help someone else in need.\n\nMy Son’s Story: Before suffering these last two years, and shedding so many tears\n\nUnlike me, my son had a father in his life. From the moment he was born, I committed myself to avoiding doing what my dad had done to me: leaving a young kid with only a mom’s parenting and support. I wisely learned from Ed O.G. when he told me, “Be A Father to Your Child.”\n\nI grew up without a dad, but now I’m growing old without my son. Even after divorcing the mom of my first two kids, I kept my parental commitment strong. I really love being a dad and love my kids, so it was a no-brainer. As I continue to mourn, it is slightly mitigated by knowing that I had been the best father I could be while he was here. I don’t have to look back at his life and say, “I should have done this or could have done that better.” For that, I can thank my absent dad for the motivation.\n\nI made sure they lived with me 50% of the time and also spent a lot of time volunteering and watching them at their schools, coaching their sports teams, going over homework and reading to them in their beds.\n\nLet’s stop calling him “my son” and go with his name: Matías “Mayo” Rogers. Mayo is the nickname he disliked at first, but learned to turn into a positive. Why the name? Mexican-American on his mom’s side, hence the birth name Matías, he was tremendously proud of this side of his heritage and showed it in his clothing, hats and personality. But his skin color was a pale white like his dad or Chris Mullin or Larry Bird. So kids at school started calling him Mayo, saying for someone who was so proud to be Mexican, he sure had skin the color of mayonnaise. After complaining about the “Mayo” nickname at home, he used some encouragement from me and his step-mom, Stephanie, to own it and make it a good thing like NBA player O.J. Mayo did after choosing to take on his mom’s last name.\n\nMost parents will brag about how awesome their kids are, but I promise you that he brightened up every room that he walked into. Matías was a miracle to experience. As a sophomore, he was named his high school’s Advanced Placement (AP) Student of the Year. After just one year of running track, he recorded the fastest two and three-mile running times in the country for his grade level. He was also the most caring, empathetic, and helpful family member and friend that anyone could hope for.\n\nMayo was one of these people who would sincerely ask you how your day went and always remember the answer. He’d offer his friends encouragement every time that they talked. He’d offer to cook for the family and wash everyone’s dishes after – even if his brother or sister attempted to do it themselves. Even our dental assistant would rave to me about how she’d never seen anyone that kind. “Your son is so young, and he went out of his way to ask how I was doing, then at his next appointment he remembered my answer and checked in about what I had told him six months before. He is such an amazing young man.” This was a reaction that I frequently received from people.\n\nMatías was my best friend from the very beginning. Our bedtime stories turned into time travel stories as he became addicted to the nightly stories that he asked me to make up about us traveling through time to see things like dinosaurs and key moments in world history. I coached him in soccer and basketball. Every Friday, we did “Father-Son Movie Night.” It started with movies like the Back to the Future Trilogy (so many time travel questions), and included every classic 80s, 90s and early 2000s movie that you can imagine. S.E. Hinton’s The Outsiders was both his favorite book and movie. Yes, he won AP Student of the Year in his last school year as a sophomore, but Matías was a gifted student from the beginning. He received straight A’s, honor roll and praise from teachers from Kindergarten through all 11 years of school.\n\nHis big athletic moments came when he found his true passion: running. As an adult, I regularly ran around my neighborhoods and on vacation to stay in shape. Sometimes as a kid he would join me. Where basketball was mentally challenging for him, he had a natural gift for endurance running. In junior high, he broke school records for pacer runs and the mile without training or practicing. But he never wanted to join the running teams in middle school because some of his basketball teammates made fun of runners. He wanted to impress his friends and be accepted, so he steered clear from the “dork” cross country team.\n\nI finally pushed him into running during the summer between his 8th grade and freshman high school year in 2019. At that point, he had decided to stop playing soccer and basketball, and just focus all of his high school attention on studies. Then one day, I took him on a 6-mile run, our longest together yet. As he immediately sprinted ahead of me, I yelled at him to slow down. He’d run out of energy going that fast and never make the full six miles. Boy, was I wrong. He never slowed down and never tired out. He returned to our house so fast that my wife was worried that something happened, because it took me so much longer than him to walk in the front door.\n\nAfter that, he kept arriving home earlier and earlier than me on our runs. At first, he was 10 minutes ahead of me. Then 15 minutes and 20 and 25. His long runs started at a 7-minute per mile pace and kept getting faster. Everyone would have a good laugh at my expense when I finally made it back home after him.\n\nI was never able to come close to keeping up with him. Except maybe once when we ran in the Shiloh Hills of Windsor, CA and he was afraid mountain lions might be lurking in the wild, so he stopped for me to catch up. I ran the whole way back down with him as he warily probed the hills for vicious animals.\n\nBefore his freshman year, I did a little research into his times and realized that he would be one of the fastest freshman runners in California. After looking more online, I discovered a local East Bay Area running club called, “Delta Limitless,” who accepted him into their summer program. The club now holds a Lake Tahoe-based summer running camp in his honor: Camp Mayo.\n\nAs a high school freshman, he became what his Liberty Lions high school cross country team coach called “the greatest freshman in the school’s history.” With less than a year of practice and with COVID shutting down much of the personal training he needed as an elite athlete, he still recorded some of the best times in the country for his age. He was a natural. Speed and endurance were preternatural gifts. Over three miles, he’d keep a pace of under 5-minute per. He could run two miles in 9 minutes, 45 seconds (4:52 per mile).\n\nOn April 16, 2021, he turned 16. With his AP honors, 4.3 GPA and nationally-renowned athletic achievements, he was poised to receive scholarships from Stanford, Oregon and Georgetown, his top three choices, as he prepared to enter his junior season. He was calling it the “Summer of Mayo,” as he prepared to be the California state champion in cross country and track. His goal was to be the next Nico Young, who had just graduated high school in Southern California as one of the most heralded distance runners since Steve Prefontaine.\n\nImagine my grief and my family’s when we lost him a month shy of that junior year, and he lost a future bound to be a fairy tale-type legend.\n\nThe last thing he ever said to me was an unprompted, “I love you dad.” He said it first, beating me to it, as he got out of the car when I dropped him off at his mom’s. That was Tuesday night after we had our 1-on-1 dinner together and he told me how a running scholarship to Stanford was in his future. Nothing would stop him. He died the next day.\n\nThe Near Second Death\n\nIt has taken me over two years – 27 months to be exact – to stomach the courage to put this down to paper, but I have finally been able to unearth the strength. The last thing I wrote was on this site, eight days before my son’s death on June 8, 2021. It was a long-form feature about the history of Black Sheep, including a very great, very long interview granted by rap legend Dres. His authenticity and candor helped make it one of the best things that I’ve ever written.\n\nThe Black Sheep story was one of the topics of conversation with my son during our dinner on June 15, 2021. It was one of the best conversations we’d ever had as a top-notch father-son duo. We talked about my writing and he promised he would read the Black Sheep article the following day. I never saw him again.\n\nIn the wake of his death, the community quickly honored his memory. Thousands filled the high school track stadium. Coaches, teammates, teachers and school board members spoke about how in two short years he quickly became one of the greatest runners in the school’s athletic history, one of the greatest students the teachers had ever taught and the most supportive, fun and caring friend his teammates had ever had.\n\nFrom there, it was the most intense struggle that I’ve ever known. And just when I thought I was beginning to start to heal, there was a second death that happened in March of this year – less than two years after Mayo’s passing.\n\nThe assault occurred one night after work. I’d just had a big meeting with colleagues and stepped out into the street when a man came out of the shadows and struck me in the head with a blunt weapon. The police would later describe him as a “homeless drug addict” who had committed three other assaults in the previous ten days. Knocked unconscious, I hit my head a second time hard on the concrete. The blows to the head left me in a coma for weeks and my survival was deemed “unlikely” by the doctors who told my wife and family to prepare and plan for my demise.\n\nBut here I am, somehow still alive and writing. Since it all happened, I have been in a consistent stage of questioning, “Why am I still here, but my son is gone?” I use this especially as a response to those who tell me that God stepped in and chose for me to live because He still had plans for me. My plans couldn’t be anywhere near as important as that of a kind-hearted and talented 16-year-old.\n\nOne assumption that makes me feel a bit better about both traumatic events is that my son – wherever he is and whatever he is doing in the spirit universe – stepped in and called in a few favors to make sure his dad survived a harrowing attack. He had family members still grieving his death; he didn’t want them to experience another death so quickly — especially his younger, 16-year-old sister, Amaya, who didn’t need to lose her older brother and dad in such quick succession. She grew up a daddy’s girl. I choose to look at my son as my Guardian Angel.\n\nI’m now back to mentally and physically functioning well enough to write this and go out running for miles by myself, largely due to the impact my son made in the short time he had on earth.\n\nMy recovery is likely due to all the running I did from the motivation that Matías had given me. It helped me keep my body and brain healthy enough to survive what should have been a fatal attack. With his inspiration, I worked hard on my physical therapy and was back out going on runs much faster in the recovery than any doctors predicted.\n\nPrior to my injury, we began a yearly tradition to honor his legacy: the Miles for Mayo 5K. In 2022, we raised $36,000 for youth athletes and students in his honor. I finished first in my age group with a 21:32 time and a 6:56 pace. Our second annual 5K took place on June 25, 2023 as I was recovering from my injury. I couldn’t run it then, but I did manage to run the course on a break from writing this in late September 2023. My pace this time was 7:28. Not as good as my pre-injury 5K times, but considering I was left for dead six months ago, and paralyzed and in a coma for several weeks, I will take it. As Chuck D said, “now that’s progress.”\n\nA Few Tips On How I Managed The Worst Grief Imaginable\n\nTip #1:\n\nFind a good therapist and go to therapy consistently. Two years before my trauma, my good childhood friend lost his young son from gun violence. When I lost my son, I called him straightaway for advice on how he managed through his trauma. His first advice was to go see a professional. It helped him and it has also helped me.\n\nTip #2:\n\nRead books on grief: Bearing the Unbearable by Joanne Cacciatore and When Bad Things Happen to Good People by Harold Kushner are two I have read. Knowing others have been through similar trauma helps reduce the victim angst many parents of deceased children will feel.\n\nTip #3:\n\nBuild adrenaline and endorphins through exercise and punch the shit out of a heavy bag. Running became my main form of therapy, because it was such a big part of our life together. I imagine him running with me and giving me encouragement to keep going. In my mind, he is checking in on me, being one of the birds or butterflies flying near me as I run. The first six months of 2021, I averaged 35 miles running a month. After his death, for the final six months of the year, I increased to 57 miles running per month and kept that going in 2022, which was a big part of my recovery and survival.\n\nAt my therapist’s suggestion, I also hung a heavy bag in my garage and threw punches to exorcise the sadness and anger from within me. Being in this good of shape and the inspiration from my son’s spirit was largely the reason I survived my near death. My wife and I hiked to the top of Yosemite’s Half Dome in July 2021, because that was something he had on his list to do with me. I’ve also gone back on past runs or hikes we had done together in Lake Tahoe, Windsor, North Bay’s Goat Rock Beach, Drakes Bay, Wilder Ranch State Park in Santa Cruz and Ocean View on the coast of Monterey. Seeing the waves crash into the coast is a heartfelt form of therapy.\n\nTip #4:\n\nCry, scream and yell while alone in your car and listening to an Angry Mix music playlist featuring DMX and Geto Boys. I’ve never been a crier or yeller, but my therapist recommended I do it to help release my grief, and she was correct. These processes of release help ease the grief. After exercising, crying or yelling, a weight is released from your shoulders. It helps to remove the pit I wake up with in my stomach every day.\n\nHave you ever had a job you hate or hated a project you need to complete on a certain work day that causes you to wake up with a sick feeling of dread in your stomach? That is my morning every day since losing my son, and these processes help alleviate it.\n\nTip #5:\n\nKnow your triggers and find ways to stay away from them. “All of My Love” by Led Zeppelin is a song about Robert Plant losing his young son and it is too painful for me to listen to. So I avoid it, even though it’s close to my experience. Going to my son’s gravesite was something I avoided for a period of time because the pain was too deep – knowing his body was laid there just below the ground. His headstone features pictures of him that tear me apart.\n\nI stay away from mental triggers that keep me awake into the night, I have used podcasts and meditation sounds to fall asleep. “Questlove Supreme” is the most played podcast on my list, featuring some of my favorite musicians. It’s followed by podcasts about TV shows I’m watching, music I listen to and sports teams that I follow. Sports and Sci-Fi on TV are also good distractions to hide from the reality of life.\n\nThe 2021 NBA Draft and Warriors Summer League featuring Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody was a nice distraction for me less than two months after Mayo’s death. I rewatched Game of Thrones, and even though I’m not a big Star Wars guy, I watched some of the new shows like The Mandalorian, Andor and Ahsoka because they are such an escape from the real world – as is Winning Time on HBO about the Showtime Lakers.\n\nTip #6:\n\nKeep a journal and write to your lost one. Another therapist suggestion I still use. I write messages to my son regularly, and take the journal with me when I travel. I wrote him a message from the top of a rock he used to love racing up in Yosemite’s Curry Village.\n\nTip #7:\n\nTake a chance and try to believe in improbable spiritual things that may make you feel good, like hummingbirds, butterflies or dragonflies that just might be your lost one coming to visit you and check in.\n\nTip #8:\n\nFind a way to honor your lost one and keep his/her memory and spirit alive. Because of his passion and talent for running, and the amount of running friends he had, our family organized an annual 5K run in his honor with all the proceeds donated to schools and youth sports in his name. As a family, we also planted two apple trees in our backyard in his honor. Apples were Mayo’s go-to as a runner. And he always had to pick them out himself at the grocery to make sure he got them exactly how he liked them. His favorite apple was honeycrisp, and each morning, he got up early and I’d see him cutting up a honeycrisp on a paper towel in the kitchen to eat before running.\n\nTip #9:\n\nAs much as you may not want to be here anymore, stay alive. Suicide will create more pain for your living loved ones who also lost the person you lost. I have a wife, kids and a mom who lost her first grandchild. The worst thing I could do would be to take another family member away from them. There were times I felt like I didn’t want to be on this earth any longer, but I never considered taking my own life.\n\nTip #10:\n\nListen to music that fills your soul and releases your anger, and incorporate the lyrical messages into your life. Music is a big part of my day, especially during runs, and it truly can be therapeutic. Some of the key songs that helped me are in the section below.\n\nThe Music of My Grief:\n\nNo one expresses the sadness and pain they feel through their voices quite like Future and Young Thug. They are all over my grieving playlists. Not all of their words focus on grief, but when they do, it’s like they are speaking to me.\n\n“Blood, Sweat and Tears” by Future is the song I feel speaks to my son the most and serves as the centerpiece and closing of his Celebration of Life video. It helps me with my top goal of this article: to tell you how special he was. In 16 years, he gave everything he had, his blood, sweat and tears, to be the best human being he possibly could be. On his 15th birthday, he ran 15 miles in honor of his grandma, who had died two months earlier. A 6:45 pace for a half-marathon-plus 15 miles. What other 15-year-old does that?!\n\nBlood, Sweat and Tears:\n\nI wish everyone, I wish everyone\n\nI wish everyone here could see him\n\nHe gave his blood, sweat, tears\n\nYou couldn’t have known what he did for this\n\nYou couldn’t have known, you couldn’t have known\n\nYou couldn’t have known what he did for this\n\nAy, this kid right here, is a miracle\n\nHis life now, this is spiritual\n\nMy son was kinda like my one true messiah, a life better than what I ever could expect\n\nAin’t no one never knew this struggle, or understand his passion for life was his hunger\n\nI wish all y’all could believe me\n\nI fear y’all never believe it\n\nI’m not even thinkin’ he left me behind\n\nI saw what he went through to get there\n\nI know what he came through to be there\n\nEverybody wanted a piece of him\n\nEverybody wanted his future fame\n\nI wish you could feel all my family’s pain\n\nI wish everyone in there could see him\n\nI wish everyone in here could see him\n\nHe gave his blood, sweat, tears\n\nYou couldn’t have known what he did for this\n\nHe gave his blood, sweat, tears\n\nAll I ever want now is for you to believe in him\n\nHe came, he struggled, he made it, he conquered\n\nOne hunnid, he kept his word, he kept his word, I promise\n\nHe had so much dedication and hard work\n\nHe redefined gravity, now he goes way beyond Earth\n\nTwo of the albums that spoke to me the most during my grieving was Thundercat’s It Is what It Is, with the Zen vibes and messages that things will be what they are despite their labels, with emotions focused on grief, mortality, loss and love. At just 15, Thundercat was one of Matías’ favorite artists and “Them Changes” was his jam. Pretty advanced listening habits for his age. My other grieving album was Kenny Beats’ Louie, a tribute to Kenny’s father after he was diagnosed with cancer. It was an emotional album about life and death, and that felt like a tribute to Matías.\n\nSome therapeutic standout songs for me on those albums include:\n\n“Lost In Space/Great Scott/22-26”\n\nLet me know if you can hear me\n\nIt feels so cold and so alone\n\nJust need some sort of sun\n\nIs it time to go?\n\nSomewhere lost in space\n\n“How I Feel”\n\nHow I feel\n\nIs this real?\n\n“Existential Dread”\n\nSometimes existential dread\n\nComes ringing through loud and clear\n\nI’ll adjust and simply let go\n\nI guess it is what it is\n\nI’m not sure of what’s coming next\n\nBut I’ll be alright as long as I keep breathing\n\nI know I’ll be alright\n\n“I Love Louis Cole” (aka to me Young Mayo)\n\nLife was just more fun when you came around\n\nWhen you were around, you knew what to say\n\nYou brightened everyone’s day\n\nI feel that it’s crazy\n\nWhen you were around\n\nWhen you were around\n\n“It Is What It Is” (feat. Pedro Martins)\n\nWhen the gold becomes dough\n\nAnd the magic starts to fade\n\nWhen it all comes to an end\n\nWhen there’s nothing left to say\n\nIt is what it is\n\nMy best just wasn’t enough\n\nIt couldn’t be helped, the end\n\nThe things I would do for you\n\nAfter all is said and done\n\nAnd I’m all alone\n\nWhen I sit back and reflect\n\nFrom a broken heart\n\nSometimes there’s regret\n\nIt is what it is\n\nIt couldn’t be helped, the end\n\nSo many things I wanna say\n\nThis is the end\n\n“Still” (feat. JPEGMAFIA)\n\nSo in love with you … you\n\nI really love you, yes, I do\n\n“Eternal”\n\nRuled by human logic, we sometimes confine ourselves to one plane of the universe\n\nWe live forever\n\nEternal life is the intersection of the line of time in the plane of now\n\nWe live forever\n\n“Last Words” (feat. Vince Staples, Foushée and Remi Wolf)\n\nSlowed my heart\n\nItchy-gitchy airplane\n\nI say goodbye just to miss you\n\n(Vince Staples, as my son) I’m gonna live forever so you can’t ever tell me goodbye\n\nI could be here forever, I’m immortal, I’m a statue\n\nI’m a public figure, a trophy that’s nice and shiny\n\nI’m here forever like air, nobody say goodbye to the air\n\nOther key songs on my running playlist that motivate and inspire me, and sometimes find me changing the lyrics to mirror my experience.\n\nYoung Thug – “Help Me Breath” (feat. Future & Chris Brown)\n\nDrop to my knees\n\nBeggin’ to the Lord, please\n\nGrindin’ my teeth\n\nSurrounded by police\n\nI’m searchin’ for peace\n\nCryin’ and yellin’ three or four times\n\nFall to my knees\n\nNow I’m running with your spirit next to me\n\nYou helpin’ me to breathe, yeah\n\nYou helpin’ me to breathe, baby\n\nHelpin’ me breathe\n\nYour death weaken my knees\n\nIf you were still in these, I’d make it harder for you to leave\n\nPopped a pill just to sleep, I been up for a week\n\nI bought you the best running gear ’cause I’m proud of you, just keep it a G (proud of you), yeah\n\nRan with you ‘cross the moon, you on the left (‘cross the moon)\n\nWhen your legs fly , and you jet by, the endorphins storm in\n\nI’m glad you were photogenic Monday through Sunday (I can see it)\n\nI’m keepin’ my eyes on you, these celebration of life videos iconic\n\nNow I’m running with your spirit next to me\n\nYou helpin’ me to breathe, yeah\n\nYou helpin’ me to breathe, baby\n\nYou helpin’ me to breathe (don’t make me suffer if it’s nothin’)\n\nWithout my heart, there’s a chance I could die\n\nYour spirit had my back the night I was meant to die\n\nI try to reach you when I run and touch the sky\n\nBut you helpin’ me to breathe (you helpin’ me to breathe)\n\nFuture – “Incredible”\n\nI was havin’ life issues\n\nBut life got much better since I had you\n\nI know it’s true father-son love with you\n\nTold myself I’m leavin’ their mom but I don’t wanna leave you\n\nRunnin’ with you on the Monterey Bay coast speedin’\n\nFriday, vacation, we just started the weekend\n\n“XO” text and you responded\n\nWe gon’ go crazy with this parent-kid friendship\n\nWe do hot yoga, to stretch it out after runnin’, 92 degrees\n\nCan you stretch it out?
