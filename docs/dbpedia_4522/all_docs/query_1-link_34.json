        "text": "If you’re only aware of Donald Glover as the recently exited Troy Barnes from NBC’s cult show Community, then you wouldn’t know Childish Gambino from Kid Cudi and probably think the 30-year-old must be a scion of the man who was Murtaugh. But if you’re serious about hip-hop, you’ve likely come to some conclusion about the merits of Gambino, the alter ego of a comedian who got his start writing jokes for The Daily Show and 30 Rock.\n\nThat opinion is apt to be negative; rarely has a rapper of such immense skill and evident vision incurred so much hostility, principally because he didn’t rise up from an impoverished upbringing, isn’t street in the slightest and dared to break into the game through interloper means. Some hard-core hip-hop heads simply won’t look past the fact that his music career began as a parodic lark, his put-on moniker derived from an online Wu-Tang Clan name generator, nor will they accept him as anything beyond a copycat.\n\nYet in the past few years, with his startling official debut Camp in 2011 and last December’s more psychologically complex follow-up, Because the Internet, Gambino has struck back at the derision by developing into one of the genre’s most intriguing innovators, a nerdy but intense antihero for the millennial generation with a keen understanding of the manipulative powers of social media. His latest effort, a concept album that blurs the lines between believable autobiography and character-driven commentary, is both a vivid snapshot of Web life and a scathing indictment of the personality deficiencies and mental isolation that trolling can cause.\n\nMore crucial to his increasing renown, however, are his live sets, which have become galvanizing experiences. Even if his albums (for boutique label Glassnote Records) don’t cohere enough to impress critics the way they do his swelling legion of followers, there’s no denying his abilities on stage. Haters might want to hush up if they haven’t seen his latest show, a conceptually stunning, diabolically explosive performance that drew an eruptive response out of a capacity crowd Saturday night at the Shrine Auditorium. It’s a bold statement that demands Gambino be taken seriously as a new force.\n\nIt’s hard to understand why people hold Glover to a different standard than they do his peers. Does he crib liberally from immediate forebears, his standard-bearer Kanye West (“he’s like a prophet”) more than any other? Yes – and so has virtually everyone else in hip-hop’s history. Do his rapid-fire rhymes sometimes miss? Is there an absurdist dud amid every dozen razor-aimed brain grenades? Can he get overly clever and wind up landing on a cliché? Yup, yup, yup – just like Lil Wayne, Drake, all of Odd Future and Yeezus, too.\n\nThere are such unnecessarily heavy burdens laid on Gambino that others of relatively similar backgrounds aren’t saddled with. And still he’s rising above that noise to become the next major player, the hatred he faces only fueling fervency among his fans.\n\nHis verbal brilliance, more nuanced on his richly produced records (crafted with chief collaborator Ludwig Göransson), is even more irrefutable in concert, where he’s as fleet as Eminem and just as mind-boggling. You can say his prolific output, dating to mixtapes begun in 2008, is uneven – he packs in too many rip-offs, jabs in too many directions with no center, overloads his concepts when he might get more piercing results by paring down. I don’t disagree, and still I think they’re among the most exciting hip-hop records released lately.\n\nHe’s also a multiple threat, singing as sweetly as he rhymes fiercely, with a falsetto as creamy as Pharrell’s but with palpable ache behind the notes. Combined with his flurries of fury across what amounted to two sets – the first half reprising almost all of Because the Internet, the second segment a tear through his hottest Camp fires – Saturday night’s riveting, arena-ready display was a two-hour tour de force, powered by a Prince-level band and with enough lasers and other wow-inducing visuals (and a guest sway from Jhené Aiko) to fill Staples Center.\n\n“I don’t believe in albums, I really don’t,” the man who has sold a quarter-million of his latest told Fuse. “I know that sounds really lame and I think pretentious. … But I don’t want to do albums. Especially now, if you’re going to put out a body of work, it should be like an experience.”\n\nThus, even Glover’s much-discussed Instagram meltdown last year via a series of depressed posts may have been just a precursor to this larger performance-art piece – long-game planning that he also learned from Kanye. His current opus comes with a half-hour prelude film online, a 75-page screenplay and this just-ended first tour, which helps unify the strands of his protagonist’s troubled psyche, from the push-pull frustration of “The Party” to the romantic loneliness of “3005.”\n\nYet, as incoherent journeys down the rabbit hole go, his detour into “The Deep Web” (as this outing is called) is more focused, more relatable and sometimes more terrifying than his idol’s indulgent Yeezus endurance tests of last year. When he momentarily hides behind a scrim for the most tender songs, a spotlight seeking him out amid a haze of technological interference, you can sense the alienation he’s trying to share; when Kanye keeps himself masked for two hours, it only seems like an ego trip.\n\nWhere does Glover end and Gambino begin? Is one really the insecure soul and the other a fireball of breathless energy? Is his show really about him? Probably no more than Slim Shady is really Marshall Mathers. Discerning that ever-shifting dividing line is much of what makes both the man and his creation so compelling.\n\nWhat’s undeniable is that he’s a consummate progressive – a still-burgeoning maverick with believers so rabid, their response can convince doubters as much as the performance itself. (Their wild leaping every time another track dropped made the balcony at the Shrine look like it was about to buckle and collapse.)\n\n“Sometimes I wanna give up, I really do,” Glover repeated during a freestyle encore, baring his soul more than at any other time in his set. No matter the slings and arrows he suffers, he shouldn’t quit. Give him another three to five years and an album with some bona fide hooks on it, and he’ll be headlining Coachella.\n\nPhoto: Armando Brown, Contributing Photographer"
