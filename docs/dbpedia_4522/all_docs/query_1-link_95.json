        "text": "Jon B: Gunna & Chloe Bailey Turned His Hit Into ‘Ratchet’ Record\n\nMany artists love seeing their music reimagined, and some might even jump in to spice up the remix if they’re really vibing with it. However, that wasn’t the case for Gunna and Chloe Bailey, whose 2022 collaboration “You & Me” sampled Jon B’s 1997 hit “They Don’t Know.”\n\nIn a recent episode of the Can We Talk R&B? show, Jon B discussed the popularity of “They Don’t Know” and how it often gets sampled. He drew a comparison between his hit, known for its distinctive guitar riff, and a new release by Robin Thicke, suggesting that it borrowed elements from his song.\n\n“Have you heard that new Robin Thicke song?” Jon B asked host Ian Von noting some similarities with his hit song. “It’s the ‘They Don’t Know’ guitar lick. Listen to it…it may not be exactly the same thing, but it’s in there.”\n\nJon B mentioned that he enjoys Thicke’s song despite the resemblance. He then addressed Gunna and Bailey’s “You & Me.”\n\n“They put that ratchet record out that I couldn’t stand, and I wish they never did,” he said, revealing his frustration partly stems from not receiving proper rights for the sample. “[They] never actually got my rights to do that record either, so Gunna – we gotta holla about that. That’s some business s— we gotta handle.”\n\nHe added, “If you made a hit in your area – you do your song, whatever it is – I’m not going to just come into your area, take your joint and make it mine and not pay you or whatever.”\n\nJon B acknowledged their sampling as a form of homage but believes he’s “earned” his own space.\n\nResponses in the comments were mixed, with one person expressing, “I’m glad Jon said something about that Gunna and Chloe sample. It’s disgusting trash [trash can emoji].” Another commented, “So if you don’t want people sampling your music. Just say no. If they sampled it and didn’t ask you, then sue them. That’s it.”\n\nIn a similar situation, Khia went viral earlier this year for her reaction to Saweetie sampling her 2011 hit “My Neck, My Back” on the track “ICY GRL.” Khia referred to Saweetie’s version as her “least favorite” yet and also shared her thoughts on the City Girls’ sample of the same song.\n\n“Nobody ain’t gave it no justice yet,” Khia determined.\n\n“My Neck, My Back” showed up on Khia’s debut album Thug Misses. Other rhymers to sample and interpolate the single include Erica Banks, Yung Gravy, Three 6 Mafia, and Lakeyah.\n\nKayla is the midday host on Detroit’s 105.1 The Bounce.
