        "text": "The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate, if possible, whether there is any relation between rap and African-American music. That is to say, if rap directly comes from the music that the first slaves to arrive in North American soil brought with them. For this, characteristics of African music will be first reviewed. After that, a study will be done about the ways that this kind of music lived with the one that predominated at that time among the inhabitants of the emerging United States of America – the majority of them being whites –, as it was deeply bound to religion. Following that, there will be a discussion about whether the latter had any influence on the music of slaves in order for this to survive. With the passing of time, a blend between African and American cultures derived in what we know as African-American culture. As a consequence, new musical styles were set up, till the most current – rap –, which originated as a music to express social protest and wishes to change, to freedom for the black population. However, today rap is fairly linked to an almost obsessive quest for money and success, having freedom and revolution ideals been nearly erased from its lyrics."
