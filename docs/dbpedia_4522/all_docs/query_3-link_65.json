        "text": "Snoop Dogg has always appreciated a solid tipple. Back in 1993, the iconic rapper had an enduring smash hit with “Gin and Juice,” and ever since, we, the general drinking public, are consistently delighted to learn that whatever’s in Snoop’s cup is always something uplifting.\n\nIn the early Aughts, Snoop partnered with Cognac house Landy for a fun ad campaign, and in 2020, he officially launched his own gin and a wine collaboration with 19 Crimes. Starting with a Cali Red, the partners have since expanded into a Cali Rosé, a Cali Blanc (Sauvignon Blanc) and a Cali Gold white blend. This man has seemingly not met a spirit or wine category his palate doesn’t love.\n\nWe interview Snoop Dogg and the executives at Treasury Wine Estates, who own the 19 Crimes brand, fairly regularly, resulting in a number of interesting facts about Snoop wine bottles and brand. Here’s your guide to everything relating to Snoop Dogg and 19 Crimes wine.\n\n1. Snoop Loves the 19 Crimes Brand\n\nWhen partnering with 19 Crimes to launch his brand, Snoop shared, “I’ve been a fan,” of the Australian company’s wine. The brand ethos and marketing stem from the historical act of sending British criminals to Australia for any one of 19 various crimes. (Many of those crimes, established in the 1700s, were insane, including: “impersonating an Egyptian, stealing fish from a pond or river, or clandestine marriage.”)\n\nThe notion of outlaws who evolved into pioneers is celebrated by 19 Crimes, and the synergy between the winery and Snoop was evident to 19 Crimes' top brass. “[19 Crimes] is really a story of overcoming adversity and coming from somewhere that’s a tough situation, to somewhere amazing. And we absolutely think that Snoop embodies that in a contemporary context,” John Wardley, Treasury Wine Estates marketing vice president for the Americas, told us.\n\n2. Snoop Dogg’s 19 Crimes Cali Red is a Blend\n\nThe mix is Petite Sirah, Zinfandel and Merlot, all sourced from vineyards in Lodi, California. (The precise breakdown is 65 percent Petite Sirah, 30 percent Zinfandel and 5 percent Merlot, if you’re wondering.) The current release is a 2020 vintage and comes in at 14.1 percent alcohol by volume.\n\n3. Snoop Tasted All the Options and Picked the Final Blend Himself\n\nIt would be easy to outsource tasting and blend selection, but that’s not what Snoop did. After sampling a variety of options, “[Snoop] very much picked this wine,” Wardley told us. “We wouldn’t have done it any other way.”\n\n4. Many Wine Drinkers Think Snoop Dogg Cali Red is Great\n\nWhile taste comes down to a variety of personal palate preferences, typically a Petite Sirah will afford deep and complex notes that include dark berries, ripened plums and even a hint of cocoa on the finish. Petite Sirah will also lend a punch of acidity and tannins to the blend. Zinfandel can lead to a jammy taste and lingering smoky note on the tongue, while Merlot will bolster the dark fruit flavors.\n\nAs to whether you’ll find Snoop’s wine good, you’ll have to try for yourself. Many reviewers who’ve purchased the bottle through national retailers rank it highly (above a 4 out of 5 in many cases), noting that it’s got great flavor for the price, which is around $15 per bottle.\n\n5. Snoop Pairs 19 Crimes Red Wine with His Favorite Cookbook Recipes\n\nGiven his unorthodox but lovely friendship with Martha Stewart—the duo hosted a dinner party TV show dubbed “Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party”—it’s not surprising Snoop’s got a penchant for cuisine, too. His first cookbook, entitled From Crook to Cook, highlights 50 recipes that include comfort food mainstays like chicken and waffles, but plenty of loftier fare, like lobster Thermidor.\n\nMany of these recipes are apt for wine pairings, so the menu-planning app eMeals worked with the 19 Crimes team to match the ideal wine to nine of Snoop’s recipes. Available options include Snoop’s Yardie Yardbird (Jamaican-inspired chicken), Bow Wow Brownies and Ice Cream, and more. Users get the full recipes, shopping lists and a wine-matching suggestion.\n\n6. Kroger Still Sells Snoop’s 19 Crimes, Despite Pulling a Display\n\nIn February 2023, a complaint from a former president of an NAACP chapter was lodged against a Georgia Kroger supermarket. The issue concerned the prominent display placement of Snoop Dogg’s wine which was viewed as offensive and stereotypical to those wishing to celebrate Black History Month. Kroger removed the display, stating that it is committed to “diversity, equity, and inclusion.” The supermarket chain didn’t stop selling Snoop’s 19 Crimes, though. It’s currently available for purchase on the store’s website and in stores.\n\n7. Snoop Experimented with Augmented Reality with 19 Crimes Labels\n\n19 Crimes launched an innovative augmented reality program where the company’s wine labels come to life. And Snoop didn’t sit on the sidelines when it came to his own labels, either. To see the label come to life, head over here.\n\n8. 19 Crimes Snoop Cali Rosé Was Snoop’s Vision\n\n“It was Snoop’s idea to take us down the rosé path,” Wardley told us. “Snoop called it ‘a West Coast party in a bottle—and the wine of summer.’” Snoop launched his rosé in 2021 with a 2020 vintage from California, featuring 75 percent Zinfandel, 20 percent Grenache and 5 percent Pinot Noir. The bottle, which costs $15, contains 12 percent alcohol by volume.\n\n9. Snoop and 19 Crimes Donated $100,000 to Charity\n\nWhen protests about human rights erupted across all 50 states during 2020, Snoop and 19 Crimes announced a $100,000 donation to the NAACP Legal Fund to help protestors find legal assistance and aid. “We knew it was time to get involved and show our support for those simply exercising their rights as a U.S. citizen,” Wardley told us.\n\n10. Snoop’s Staying True to Gin and Juice\n\n\"[Wine and gin] have their own occasions,\" Snoop told us. \"A lot of people call wine ‘juice.’ So, it’s only right that I give them the gin and juice with [my gin] Indoggo and 19 Crimes.\"\n\nIn fact, inspired by the 1994 Grammy-nominated hit, he and producer Dr. Dre introduced pre-mixed Gin and Juice by Dre And Snoop cocktails at the Super Bowl LVIII after party. “Look at our age and look at what we’ve done, and we still love each other, so why not do something together?” said Snoop. Clocking in at 5.9% ABV, these (obviously) gin-based drinks come in four flavors: Apricot (with honey and bergamot), Citrus (with rose and lemon), Melon (watermelon, lemon and hibiscus) and Passionfruit (with pineapple and ginger). A variety pack of 12 cans, adorned with vintage cars in different colors, sells online for around $25 at sites like ReserveBar, while a single-flavor pack of four cans goes for $14–$15.\n\n11. He Helped 19 Crimes Bring Martha Stewart on Board\n\nStewart launched her Martha’s Chard, a $12 bottle of California Chardonnay, with 19 Crimes in 2022. Snoop, it seems, played a helping hand in 19 Crimes closing the deal with Stewart. “Snoop and Martha have a close friendship, and it was very helpful to have Snoop in our corner when we started negotiations with Martha,” a representative from 19 Crimes’ Treasury Wine Estates told us.\n\n12. Snoop's Wine Project Led Him to Create Canned Wine Cocktails\n\nThe entertainment icon kicked off the summer of 2024 with a new entry into the \"ready-to-drink\" market of canned cocktails. Once again teaming up with 19 Crimes, he launched Cali Cocktails—lightly carbonated drinks with an agave wine base—in two flavors, Smokin' Strawberry Margarita and Long Beach Lemonade. Their ABV comes in at 9 percent, higher than a typical canned beer but lower than many spirits-based canned cocktails. Cali Cocktails are sold in 4-packs of 335ml cans, with a suggested retail price of $15, and can be enjoyed straight out of the can or over ice."
