        "text": "American rapper (born 1993)\n\nFor his eponymous album, see Vince Staples (album).\n\nMusical artist\n\nVincent Jamal Staples (born July 2, 1993) is an American rapper. He first became known for his association with alternative hip hop collective Odd Future, namely Mike G and Earl Sweatshirt. He signed with Talib Kweli's Blacksmith Records prior to releasing his collaborative mixtape with Mac Miller, Stolen Youth (2013). The following year, he signed with No I.D.'s ARTium Recordings, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings to release his debut extended play, Hell Can Wait (2014)—which marked his first project to chart on the Billboard 200.\n\nHis rise to prominence was supported by his appearances on projects by Odd Future members: Earl, Journey to the 5th Echelon (2010), and Doris (2013). Hell Can Wait was met with critical acclaim and included the singles \"Hands Up\" and \"Blue Suede\". His debut album, Summertime '06 (2015) was met with similar reception and spawned the platinum-certified single \"Norf Norf\". He was part of the XXL 2015 Freshman Class.[3] His follow up albums, Big Fish Theory (2017), FM! (2019), his self-titled fourth studio album (2021), and Ramona Park Broke My Heart (2022) each further diversified his artistry, being met with continued critical acclaim and moderate commercial response. In 2024, Staples released his album Dark Times (2024), which was his final album with Def Jam Recordings.[4] Staples' music is often described as West Coast hip hop, often containing conscious subject matter while production experiments with avant-garde, dance and electronic influences.[5]\n\nOutside of his solo career, he is a member of the California-based hip hop trio Cutthroat Boyz with Aston Matthews and Joey Fatts. Staples has acted in the films Dope and White Men Can't Jump, and the television series Abbott Elementary. As a voice actor, he performed in the 2015 film Mutafukaz, as well as the animated series American Dad! and Lazor Wulf. In 2015, he became a spokesperson and brand ambassador for Sprite.[6][7]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nStaples was born in Compton, California, and grew up in North Long Beach, after his mother decided she wanted to move away from Compton due to the high crime rates.[8] Staples is the youngest of five siblings, two brothers and three sisters.[10] .[11]\n\nStaples attended Optimal Christian Academy from 4th to 8th grade, which he said was an influential and positive experience.[10] During high school, Staples' mom sent him to Atlanta to stay with one of his sisters.

Most notably, he played in Snoop Dogg's Snoop Youth Football League (SYFL). Staples recalled playing against the Carson Colts and Mission Viejo Cowboys who he claimed had \"grown-ass men on the field.\" Staples stated, \"Snoop really did it big, we got our names on our jerseys, we had the best cleats, the best helmets, you know Snoop Dogg really loved football.\"[14]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n2009–2013: Beginnings and Stolen Youth\n\n[edit]\n\nStaples was discovered by Dijon \"LaVish\" Samo and Chuck Wun, alongside his cousin Campbell Emerson. LaVish took Staples on a trip to Los Angeles, where he befriended the Odd Future collective's members Syd tha Kyd, Mike G, and Earl Sweatshirt.

The mixtape features guest appearances from Miller, Ab-Soul, Schoolboy Q, Da$H, Hardo, and Staples's Cutthroat Boyz co-member Joey Fatts.[17] Following Stolen Youth's release, he toured as a supporting act on Miller's The Space Migration Tour.
