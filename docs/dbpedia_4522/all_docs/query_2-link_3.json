        "text": "Thirty years ago, a rap music legend began his journey to immortality — and to Martha Stewart.\n\nMost in-the-know music fans were aware of Snoop Doggy Dogg (as he was then known) because of his collaborations with Dr. Dre. First there was \"Deep Cover\" from the soundtrack of the film of the same name. Then there were his memorable contributions to Dre's The Chronic, which came out in late 1992.\n\nSo the world was primed for Snoop's solo debut Doggystyle when it was released into the world on November 23, 1993. The album sold around 800,000 copies in its first week, and set the stage for Snoop to become a superstar, one who would eventually reach a stage of pop-culture ubiquity that mid-90s rap fans — and those people who saw his scowl on the cover of Newsweek as the literal face of the question of whether rap was too violent — could have never imagined.\n\nTo celebrate the anniversary of Doggystyle's release, GRAMMY.com is revisiting the D-O-double-G's biggest and best musical moments. A quick note: this list does not include songs that appear on another artist's album (hey, we had to draw the line somewhere!), so there's no \"Nuthin' But A 'G' Thang\" or \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted.\" And we tried to pull from all eras of his career, so it's not all Doggystyle (though you should, of course, listen to that classic in its entirety).\n\nSo with all that said, here we are: 15 of Snoop Dogg's most popular and most dynamic songs.\n\n\"Deep Cover\" with Dr. Dre, Deep Cover soundtrack (1992)\n\nEvery album comes with a backstory, but not many come with two. Rakim's new project G.O.D's Network (REB7RTH), out July 26, came together in a few quick months, from signing a deal in February 2024 to completion in June. The process was spurred by one dedicated A&R person frantically combing through his network of rappers to get guest verses over beats produced by the God MC himself.\n\nBut to hear that A&R man, Matt \"M80\" Markoff, tell it, creating the seven-song project didn't take four months. It took four years.\n\n\"I've known [Rakim's longtime manager] Matt [Kemp] and Rakim since 2007,\" Markoff tells me when I get him on the phone in late June. \"They're used to getting calls from me a couple of times a year just for, like, show referrals, verse referrals, things of that nature.\"\n\nBack at the beginning of the pandemic, Markoff had been talking to the folks at Fat Beats, the venerable record store-turned-distributor that's a huge name in independent hip-hop. He mentioned Rakim's name to the company, and Fat Beats responded that they'd love a project from the God MC. The original pitch, Markoff remembers, was \"a three or four song EP with some remixes.\"\n\nRakim quoted his price, Fat Beats agreed, and the project was underway, with the emcee meeting with producers to look for beats. But Rakim, who hasn't released a solo album since 2009's The Seventh Seal, is not one to be hurried.\n\n\"Ra was having [DJ] Premier and Pete Rock and Ninth Wonder and some of these people come to the studio,\" Markoff says. \"Because of scheduling conflicts and stuff and, you know, normal course of life, it just wasn't right. The vibe wasn't there.\"\n\nThat's where Jazzy Jeff came into play. Rakim and the legendary DJ began working together and, per Markoff, it \"just meshed.\" It seemed like, instead of a handful of songs, a full-length record was in the offing.\n\n\"As soon as they finish the first song, I walk into Fat Beats and say, ‘Hey, this is what we're doing now,'\" the A&R man recalls. \"Instead of Rakim with random producers, it's Rakim/Jazzy Jeff. That'll be huge.\"\n\nThen…nothing.\n\nA few years pass, and the Rakim and Jazzy Jeff project is still unfinished. (Rakim described its status as \"We have a couple records already done.\") Fat Beats, which was on the auction block (it was eventually sold in March 2024), wants its money back. Rakim obliges, and everyone seems set to forget about the whole thing.\n\nMarkoff, however, was not about to give up on working with the man he calls \"my favorite emcee of all time.\"\n\nThe revamped album started its life as not an album at all. Instead, the original conception was a model Markoff had used before: licensing beats by people not typically thought of as producers. In this case, he'd be offering aspiring rappers the chance to get beats by arguably the most influential rapper of all time.\n\n\"He's taken people who are not necessarily known as producers and put together beat packages for them,\" manager Matt Kemp says of Markoff. \"And then, one of the things he does is he goes out and he licenses those beats through a company that he has. If you're a European artist that wouldn't necessarily have access to things like that, you can get it.\"\n\nSo that, as of February of this year, was the (revamped) plan: have Rakim do six beats and one verse, and sell non-exclusive licenses, so that any rapper, anywhere in the world, who wants to use them in a song of their own could do so. This, indeed, was a vision that was followed through all the way to the finish line — you can see the end result released July 12, priced between $700-$1,050 depending on what you want to do with the beats and the rhyme, here.\n\nBut along the way to creating that package, things got significantly more complicated. As Rakim was making the beats, he found he really liked them. In some cases, he even wanted to rhyme on them himself.\n\n\"As the beats started coming together and Rakim was really in the studio and we started putting the rhymes onto them, we realized that it was bigger just than that [original vision],\" Matt Kemp said.\n\nThe wheels started turning. Rakim, the God MC, as a producer? That would be a project worth sharing with the world, not just a few aspiring artists.\n\nAs it turns out, unbeknownst even to many Ra fans, the rapper has been making beats since the beginning. In fact, he produced — and played drums on — one of Eric B and Rakim's classic songs, 1992's \"Juice (Know the Ledge).\" So producing an entire project didn't seem like such a big stretch after all.\n\nFor the project's lead single, \"BE ILL,\" he got in plenty of internal rhymes. And the song's tempo allowed him to come up with different rhythms.\n\n\"When tracks are at that speed, I'm able to manipulate time and space to come up with different rhythms because I have so much time and space to deal with,\" he says. \"It was one of them songs I loved rhyming to. Just having fun with words and phrases, and at the same time having so much on my mind to say.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to say a lot of things,\" Ra admits when discussing his writing on the album. \"It's hard to just come back and say a verse when you've been gone so long. So I tried to be very specific and cautious with the words that I chose, and try to be entertaining at the same time. So it was a little nerve wracking.\"\n\nEven with Rakim's vocal contributions (he ends up with either verses or hooks on six of the project's seven tracks), more was needed to complete the songs. That's where Markoff really got going.\n\n\"Literally, I didn't waste a single day,\" he remembers. \"I was calling the artists in my network. I reached out to each artist one by one, and let each artist go through the folder [of beats] with me and make their picks.\"\n\nAmong the artists Markoff reached out to were several members of the Wu-Tang Clan. He has a long relationship with the crew, having worked with them on several projects including the well-regarded 2005 album Wu-Tang Meet the Indie Culture.\n\nMarkoff recalls the exact moment when he lined up Wu member Masta Killa for his appearance on what became \"BE ILL.\"\n\n\"I was at the first ever Wu-Tang Clan residency in Vegas, and I told Masta Killa, ‘Dude, I just got these Rakim beats 10 minutes ago.' I played 10 seconds of the second beat, which was the beat for ‘BE ILL.' And he was like, ‘That's the one.'\"\n\nA different Wu-Tang show was responsible for one of the album's other notable guest appearances, Cash Money stalwart B.G. The two met at the concert, and the Louisiana rapper was in the studio \"48 hours later,\" Markoff recalls.\n\nFor a handful of artists he had good long-term relationships with, Markoff let them choose which of Rakim's beats they wanted to rap over. In addition to Masta Killa, he names Chino XL, Hus Kingpin, 38 Spesh, and TriState as being on that short list. After that, he says, it was all his decision.\n\nThe end result is a list of some of the top rappers in his Rolodex: Kool G. Rap, Method Man, Kurupt, Canibus, KXNG Crooked, Skyzoo, Joell Ortiz, and many more — including an outro from Snoop Dogg. But one of the most surprising things on the tracklist is that a number of the guests aren't alive anymore.\n\nNipsey Hussle, Prodigy, DMX, and Fred the Godson have verses on the record. All of them were people Markoff had worked with in some capacity over the course of his career. He says that all of the verses were \"in my stash or under my ownership.\" So when he was looking for material for the Rakim project, they were a perfect fit.\n\nThe Nipsey Hussle contribution in particular stood out so much that the entire song, \"Love Is the Message,\" was designed around it. The project's engineer placed Neighborhood Nip's verse first, and everyone else listened to that when recording.\n\n\"We kind of glorified who he is, and came up with the title ‘Love Is the Message' to put everything in perspective,\" Rakim tells me. \"So everybody vibed off of that and everything that we implemented had to have that feel or had to be in that direction.\"\n\nOne thing Rakim noticed as he was listening to the contributions coming in? Many of them were paying tribute to him. In particular, B.G. says in his verse that he's \"on a song with the greatest.\"\n\n\"To hear things like that from my peers is a beautiful thing,\" says Rakim, who also admits to tearing up when hearing Snoop Dogg praise him on the outro of one of the album's songs. \"Hip-hop is one of the more, I guess, feisty genres. It's hard to get that love from your peers. So it's a real blessing to hear it from people like that, to hear what they think of you and to say that on records. A lot of people might think that of you, but would never say it on a record.\"\n\nFor Markoff, B.G.'s tribute was particularly meaningful because of the rapper's history. He began his career in a duo, and later a quartet, with another rapper sometimes considered the greatest of all time, Lil Wayne.\n\n\"For B.G. to have that history, but acknowledge Rakim — I was speechless,\" Markoff confides. \"It was really cool to see. It's like, ‘I'm not just going to say my partner, my friend, my confidant Lil Wayne's the best because we grew up together.'\"\n\nFinally, after all the guest verses came in, the project was ready. Seven songs, entirely produced by Rakim, with raps by him and a broad cross-section of artists. The question, then: what exactly is this project? An album? An EP? Rakim's big comeback? A teaser for his eventual full-length return?\n\nTo Markoff, none of these labels are important. He's not concerned about fans being disappointed that a project under Rakim's name features only a handful of the rapper's verses.\n\n\"The fan is going to look at it however they want to look at it,\" he says. \"The negative people will stay negative. It wouldn't matter if it was the greatest album of all time. The positive people that are so grateful that I stepped up to the plate to help bring new Rakim music to the world are going to love it.\"\n\nAfter all, he continues, \"The whole point originally when we started making it was letting his peers shine on Rakim beats. The fact that this project morphed into something that Rakim literally is on 95% of, I couldn't have asked for more of a blessing.\"\n\nSo Matt Markoff, the boy who fell in love with Rakim's music at 12 is now, three decades later, putting out music from his hero.\n\n\"Dream fulfilled,\" he says right before we hang up. \"Now I gotta figure out what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.\"\n\nBut despite those tie-ins, the two takes on \"Hard Times\" are night and day. Kurtis Blow’s is exactly what rap music was in its earliest recorded form: a full band playing something familiar (in this case, a James Brown-esque groove, bridge and percussion breakdown inclusive.)\n\nWhat Run-DMC does with it is entirely different. The song is stripped down to its bare essence. There’s a drum machine, a sole repeated keyboard stab, vocals, and… well, that’s about it. No solos, no guitar, no band at all. Run and DMC are trading off lines in an aggressive near-shout. It’s simple and ruthlessly effective, a throwback to the then-fading culture of live park jams. But it was so starkly different from other rap recordings of the time, which were pretty much all in the style of Blow’s record, that it felt new and vital.\n\n\"Production-wise, Sugar Hill [the record label that released many key early rap singles] built themselves on the model of Motown, which is to say, they had their own production studios and they had a house band and they recorded on the premises,\" explains Bill Adler, who handled PR for Run-DMC and other key rap acts at the time.\n\n\"They made magnificent records, but that’s not how rap was performed in parks,\" he continues. \"It’s not how it was performed live by the kids who were actually making the music.\"\n\nRun-DMC’s musical aesthetic was, in some ways, a lucky accident. Larry Smith, the musician who produced the album, had worked with a band previously. In fact, the reason two of the songs on the album bear the subtitle \"Krush Groove\" is because the drum patterns are taken from his band Orange Krush’s song “Action.”\n\nRead more: Essential Hip-Hop Releases From The 1970s: Kurtis Blow, Grandmaster Flash, Sugarhill Gang & More\n\nBut by the time sessions for Run-DMC came around, the money had run out and, despite his desire to have the music done by a full band, Smith was forced to go without them and rely on a drum machine.\n\nHis artistic partner on the production side was Russell Simmons. Simmons, who has been accused over the past seven years of numerous instances of sexual assault dating back decades, was back in 1983-4 the person providing the creative vision to match Smith’s musical knowledge.\n\nOrange Krush’s drummer Trevor Gale remembered the dynamic like this (as quoted in Geoff Edgers’ Walk This Way: Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song that Changed American Music Forever): “Larry was the guy who said, 'Play four bars, stop on the fifth bar, come back in on the fourth beat of the fifth bar.' Russell was the guy that was there that said, ‘I don’t like how that feels. Make it sound like mashed potato with gravy on it.’”\n\nIt wasn’t just the music that set Run-DMC apart from its predecessors. Their look was also starkly different, and that influenced everything about the group, including the way their audience viewed them.\n\nMost of the first generation of recorded rappers were, Bill Adler remembers, influenced visually by either Michael Jackson or George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic. Run-DMC was different.\n\n\"Their fashion sense was very street oriented,\" Adler explains. \"And that was something that emanated from Jam Master Jay. Jason just always had a ton of style. He got a lot of his sartorial style from his older brother, Marvin Thompson. Jay looked up to his older brother and kind of dressed the way that Marvin did, including the Stetson hat.\n\n\"When Run and D told Russ, Jason is going to be our deejay, Russell got one look at Jay and said, ‘Okay, from now on, you guys are going to dress like him.’\"\n\nRun, DMC, and Jay looked like their audience. That not only set them apart from the costumed likes of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, it also cemented the group’s relationship with their listeners.\n\n\"When you saw Run-DMC, you didn’t see celebrity. You saw yourself,\" DMC said in the group’s recent docuseries.\n\nRead more: 20 Iconic Hip-Hop Style Moments: From Run-D.M.C. To Runways\n\nAnother thing that set Run-DMC (the album) and Run-DMC (the group) apart from what came before was the fact that they released a cohesive rap album. Nine songs that all belonged together, not just a collection of already-released singles and some novelties. Rappers had released albums prior to Run-DMC, but that’s exactly what they were: hits and some other stuff — sung love ballads or rock and roll covers, or other experiments rightfully near-forgotten.\n\n\"There were a few [rap] albums [at the time], but they were pretty crappy. They were usually just a bunch of singles thrown together,\" Cory Robbins recalls.\n\nNot this album. It set a template that lasted for years: Some social commentary, some bragging, a song or two to show off the DJ. A balance of records aimed at the radio and at the hard-core fans. You can still see traces of Run-DMC in pretty much every rap album released today.\n\nListeners and critics reacted. The album got a four-star review in Rolling Stone with “the music…that backs these tracks is surprisingly varied, for all its bare bones” and an A minus from Robert Christgau who claimed “It's easily the canniest and most formally sustained rap album ever.” Just nine months after its release, Run-DMC was certified gold, the first rap LP ever to earn that honor. \"Rock Box\" also single-handedly invented rap-rock, thanks to Eddie Martinez’s loud guitars.\n\nThere is another major way in which the record was revolutionary. The video for \"Rock Box\" was the first rap video to ever get into regular rotation on MTV and, the first true rap video ever played on the channel at all, period. Run-DMC’s rise to MTV fame represented a significant moment in breaking racial barriers in mainstream music broadcasting.\n\n\"There’s no overstating the importance of that video,\" Adler tells me. vIt broke through the color line at MTV and opened the door to a cataclysmic change.\"\n\n\"Everybody watched MTV forty years ago,\" Robbins agrees. \"It was a phenomenal thing nationwide. Even if we got three or four plays a week of ‘Rock Box’ on MTV, that did move the needle.\"\n\nAll of this: the new musical style, the relatable image, the MTV pathbreaking, and the attendant critical love and huge sales (well over 10 times what their label head was expecting when he commissioned the album from a reluctant Russell Simmons — \"I hoping it would sell thirty or forty thousand,\" Robbins says now): all of it contributed to making Run-DMC what it is: a game-changer.\n\n\"It was the first serious rap album,\" Robbins tells me. And while you could well accuse him of bias — the group making an album at all was his idea in the first place — he’s absolutely right.\n\nRun-DMC changed everything. It split the rap world into old school and new school, and things would never be the same.\n\nPerhaps the record’s only flaw is one that wouldn’t be discovered for years. As we’re about to get off the phone, Robbins tells me about a mistake on the cover, one he didn’t notice until the record was printed and it was too late.\n\nThere was something (Robbins doesn’t quite recall what) between Run and DMC in the cover photo. The art director didn’t like it and proceeded to airbrush it out. But he missed something. On the vinyl, if you look between the letters \"M\" and \"C,\", you can see DMC’s disembodied left hand, floating ghost-like in mid-air. While it was an oversight, it’s hard not to see this as a sign, a sort of premonition that the album itself would hang over all of hip-hop, with an influence that might be hard to see at first, but that never goes away.\n\nA Guide To New York Hip-Hop: Unpacking The Sound Of Rap's Birthplace From The Bronx To Staten Island"
