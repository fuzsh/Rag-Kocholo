        "text": "Real gangstas move in silence.\n\nDETAILS: Rick Ross Cancels The Second Leg Of His Tour\n\nEarlier today, Rick Ross dispelled the rumors surrounding the cancellation of his “Maybach Music” Tour due to death threats from the street gang Gangster Disciples.\n\nThe North Carolina chapter of the street gang filmed a viral video warning the Trilla rapper to stay out of the state. Apparently, the gang members felt disrespected by the Maybach Music General citing his “BMF (Blowing Money Fast)” song as being disrespectful, as well as Ricky Rozay’s use of the Star Of David for his Black Bar Mitzvah mixtape.\n\nThe Star Of David is typically associated with the religion of Judaism, but the street gang also uses the symbol on its paraphernalia.\n\nNEW MUSIC: Rick Ross “100 Black Coffins”\n\nIt all seems to be one big misunderstanding, because Rick Ross has lots of love for gangsters.\n\nWhere do we start?\n\nWell, Rick Ross borrowed his stage name from drug trafficker Freeway Rick Ross. The alias has gotten Rick Ross in trouble by the REAL Rick Ross, who took the rapper to court for profiting off of his “likeness.”\n\nRick Ross’ admiration for gangsters doesn’t stop there. From titling his fourth studio album Teflon Don after John Gotti’s most notorious nickname, to shouting out Gangster Disciples leader Larry Hoover and Black Mafia Family’s leader Big Meech in his song “BMF (Blowing Money Fast),” Rick Ross loves gang life.\n\nGlobalGrind decided to round up other rappers who have either named themselves after a notorious gangster, are associated with a gang, or just admire the mafia lifestyle.\n\nCheck out all the rappers associated with gangs, gangstas, and anybody that love them below!\n\nMiami Rapper Rick Ross and Philly rapper Freeway actually named themselves after the same gangsta. They’re both named after the notorious California drug trafficker Ricky Donnell Ross, also known as “Freeway” Rick Ross.\n\nRapper Lil Wayne is associated with the Blood gang. Although some members of the gang dispute Lil Wayne’s actual membership, Lil Wayne continues to yell out “soo woo” gang.\n\nCalifornia rapper The Game is also associated with the Blood gang. His older half brother George Taylor III, also known as Big Fase 1000, was the leader of the Cedar Block Piru Bloods.\n\nYoung Jeezy is good friends with Demetrius Flenory, also known as Big Meech. Big Meech was the most notorious black drug trafficker in U.S. history. He is currently serving a 30 year jail sentence.\n\nBad Boy rapper Machine Gun Kelly adopted his name from American gangster George Celino Barnes, who became notorious for bootlegging and armed robbery during the Prohibition Era. George became nicknamed after his favorite weapon, a machine gun. Rapper MGK adopted the alias due to his “rapid-fire” flow.\n\n50 Cent says his name is a metaphor for change. But critics say the “Many Men” rapper borrowed the name from Kelvin “50 Cent” Martin. The real “50 Cent” was a stick-up kid in a public housing project in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.\n\nNas sometimes refers to himself as “Escobar” after the notorious Colombian drug lord, Pablo Escobar, who became one of the richest people in the world because of cocaine.\n\nIn the ’90s, Jay-Z used to refer to himself as “Iceberg Slim.” Iceberg Slim was once a famous pimp in the 1960s.\n\nFrench Montana adopted his alias from his French/Moroccan background, and combined it with the fictional character Tony Montana from the infamous gangster movie Scarface.\n\nNotorious B.I.G. sometimes referred to himself as Frank White. Frank White was the main character of a 1990 film called King of New York, and Biggie often referred to himself as the “King of New York” when it came to hip-hop.\n\nSnoop Dogg is a member of the Rollin’ 20 Crips set in the Eastside of Long Beach.\n\nCali rapper Nipsey Hussle is a member of the Rollin 60s Crip gang in Los Angeles.\n\nAtlanta rapper Yo Gotti named himself after American mobster and crime boss of the Gambino crime family, John Gotti. John Gotti was eventually convicted of five murders and sentenced to life in prison. He died in 2002 after losing a battle with throat cancer.\n\nMurder Inc founder and record label executive, Irv Gotti, also modeled himself after American mobster John Gotti.\n\nHip hop homies Capone and Noreaga both named themselves after notorious gangsters. Capone got his alias from gangster Al Capone, who was notoriously known for bootlegging, smuggling, and prostitution during the Prohibition era.\n\nNoreaga on the other hand modeled himself after Panamanian military governor, Manuel Noriega, who was eventually convicted of drug trafficking, racketeering, and three murder cases. Noriega was suspected to be responsible for the deaths of 11 political opponents."
