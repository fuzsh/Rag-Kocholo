        "text": "The BET Awards will air live on June 30 at 8 p.m. Eastern on BET\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The 2024 BET Awards are fast approaching. Last year’s show celebrated 50 years of hip-hop with tributes to the genre’s earliest voices, late legends and new talent during a show packed with spectacular performances that consistently felt like a party. This year is stacking up to be just as exciting with award-winning performers — Lauryn Hill, Childish Gambino, Megan Thee Stallion and Will Smith, anyone? — and presenters.\n\nOscar-nominated actor Taraji P. Henson will host the BET Awards for a third time.\n\n“If we didn’t have a BET, how would the little ones know all this greatness exists? How will we be able to inspire each other if we didn’t see each other,” Henson told The Associated Press. “And so this is a safe space for us where we get to lift each other up — where sometimes in this industry, we don’t get to see ourselves lifted and celebrated in this way.”\n\nHere’s everything you need to know before the June 30 show.\n\nWhen are the BET Awards and how can I watch them?\n\nThe BET Awards will air live on June 30 at 8 p.m. Eastern on BET from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. It will be simulcast on MTV, Comedy Central, MTV2, TVLand, Nickelodeon, Pop and Logo.\n\nWho’s nominated for the BET Awards?\n\nDrake leads the nominations with seven, including an album of the year nod for his eighth studio album, “For All the Dogs.” One of the awards he’s up for is the music video for “First Person Shooter,” his collaboration with J. Cole that may have been the catalyst for his recent beef with rapper Kendrick Lamar.\n\nNicki Minaj follows with six, including for album of the year for her highly anticipated “Pink Friday 2” release. Two of her nominations were for her song with Ice Spice, “Barbie World,” part of the blockbuster “Barbie” soundtrack.\n\nJ. Cole, Sexyy Red, SZA and best new artist Grammy winner Victoria Monét tie with five nods; 21 Savage, Beyoncé, Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion, Tyla and Usher boast four each.\n\nA few months after wowing audiences while headlining the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show, Usher will also receive the lifetime achievement BET award.\n\nThe film nominees this year are: “American Fiction”; “Bob Marley: One Love”; “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé”; “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”; “The Book of Clarence”; “The Color Purple”; “The Equalizer 3” and “The Little Mermaid.”\n\nSimone Biles, Naomi Osaka, Steph Curry, LeBron James and Patrick Mahomes are among the sports stars competing for awards.\n\nWho is performing at the BET Awards?\n\nPerformers will include Hill and her son YG Marley, Ice Spice, Tyla, Childish Gambino, Chlöe, Coco Jones, Keke Palmer, Marsha Ambrosius and Summer Walker.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion will serve as the show’s opening act.\n\nSmith is slated to perform a new song. The Grammy and Oscar winner is still emerging from the infamous Oscars slap two years ago, with the successful launch of “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” helping boost his comeback.\n\n“Anything Will sings, I’m just going to be there to enjoy it because we know he got some hits,” Henson said. “But you know, it is summertime. I just thought I’d throw it out there,” she added, referencing the 1991 Grammy-award winning “Summertime” by DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince.\n\n“I’m excited to hear his new music.”\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nHurricane Beryl rips through open waters after devastating the southeast Caribbean\n\nYoung Thug’s trial on hold as defense tries to get judge removed from case\n\nCourt orders white nationalists to pay $2M more for Charlottesville Unite the Right violence\n\nBET says ‘audio malfunction’ caused heavy censorship of Usher’s speech at the 2024 BET Awards\n\n‘I’m scared as s–t’: Justice Jackson, Black leaders explain why Supreme Court granting Trump immunity is dangerous\n\nCountry musician Tanner Adell will also perform on the BET Amplified stage.\n\nPreviously announced acts also include GloRilla, Latto, Muni Long, Sexyy Red, Shaboozey, and Monét.\n\nWho is presenting at the BET Awards?\n\nPresenters will include Andra Day, Colman Domingo, DC Young Fly, Devale Ellis, Jay Ellis, Jessica Betts, Ms. Pat, Niecy Nash-Betts, Saucy Santana and more, it was announced Friday."
