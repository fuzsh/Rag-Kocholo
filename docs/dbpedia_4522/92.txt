American hip hop icon Snoop Dogg has been associated with the Olympics for quite some time now. The 52-year-old rapper was a presenter for NBC along with actor and comedian Kevin Hart in the Tokyo Games three years ago.

Paris Olympics: News, schedule, medals tally and more

Among his more memorable moments during the Tokyo Games were his hilarious comments during the opening ceremony, especially when the Chinese contingent marched out and Snoop comically refused to say a word.

Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, had been retained by the NBC for their coverage of the Paris Olympics. Only this time, his role is bigger than ever. The rap artist isn’t just commenating on the Olympics from the NBC Studios in Manhattan, New York City, but has travelled across the ‘The Pond’ to cover the Paris Games in person.

And the manner in which Snoop has been involved with Team USA and has been active in the Games so far not only makes him the American contingent’s biggest cheerleader, but also one of the faces of the Paris 2024 Games.

It began with the torch relay ahead of the opening ceremony. Snoop was among the final torch bearers of the Olympic flame that was lit in Greece all the way back in April and arrived in France via the southern port city of Marseille. The ‘King of West Coast’ ran the torch relay in Saint-Denis, a Paris suburb where the main Olympic stadium â the Stade de France is located.

“I felt like Muhammad Ali. I found out that when you hold the torch, you’re a peace messenger.”

“I was waving, shaking hands, kissing the babies â doing what I do, you understand me? Putting my foot in the pavement, letting the people know that we’re here. We’re here for peace, love, unity and great sportsmanship,” Snoop was quoted as saying by NBC after the torch relay.

And since then, Snoop’s been a permanent fixture in the Paris Games and has been seen in a number of events, most prominently in the women’s gymnastics events that witnessed the triumphant return of the legendary Simone Biles after she had withdrawn from a majority of events in Tokyo due to a mental block known as the “twisties”.

Snoop not only gave meme-worthy reactions from the stands while reacting to Biles’ gold-winning feats, 27-year-old Biles and her teammate Jordan Chiles would spot him in the stands, point at him and break into an impromptu dance.

Snoop was also spotted cheering tennis star Coco Gauff and volleyball star Kelly Cheng.

It wasn’t just cheering that he limited himself to though; Snoop dabbled in colour commentary during the USA vs China badminton match, dressed in in full horse-riding gear along with celebrity chef Martha Stewart while watching Equestrian events and even getting a ride. He even tried his hand in judo and later receiving a swimming lesson from the legendary Michael Phelps.

And last but not the least, he’s got a special Olympic pin of his own, one that has him smoking and exhaling rings of smoke in the colour of the Olympic rings.

His energetic presence in the Paris Games after being elevated to the role of a ‘Special Correspondent’ has been a roaring success for American broadcasters NBC, who have witnessed a big spike in their ratings and collecting a staggering $1.25 billion in advertising revenue â their best-ever for an Olympics.

âWe’ve been pleasantly surprised by his popularity, but you never underestimate Snoop Dogg. He’s this wonderful mix of swagger and positivity," Molly Solomon, executive producer of the Olympics, said.

With a week in the Olympics, we can’t wait to see what else Snoop Dogg has in store for fans in the US and across the world.
