Brooke Kinsella has married her partner Simon in a romantic Christmas ceremony.

The former EastEnders actress and anti-knife campaigner tied the knot today after getting engaged to Simon in July.

A snapshot from the magical day was shared on social media by Brooke's manager.

She looks radiant in a strappy white gown with a lace train and sweetheart neckline.

Her dress is decorated with jewels around the waist and she has her hair pulled back from her face in a classic up do.

She stands with her arms around Simon, who is wearing a sharp grey suit and tie.

The happy couple are beaming as they pose for the camera surrounded by their loved ones.

Brooke, who was awarded an MBE for her work to fight knife crime after her half-brother Ben was stabbed to death in 2008, took a moment to remember her late sibling on her big day.

Sharing a snapshot of the gorgeous grounds of her wedding venue on Instagram, she wrote: "There was never any doubt my little angel would bring the sun out for me today"

Fans took time to wish her a wonderful day, with one saying: "Knew he'd be looking down on you both Hope you have the most amazing day"

Another said: "Ben is with you everyday and I bet he will be there watching you with a huge cheeky smile beaming with pride. I wish you all the best for today and a future filled with love and happiness because you certainly deserve it"

Last week, Brooke shared a snap of hers and Simon's rings nestled in their Christmas tree alongside ornaments in the shape of their initials.

"One week to go," she wrote, clearly excited to marry her partner.

Brooke, who played Kelly Taylor in the BBC soap, was devastated when her brother was murdered in June 2008, when he was just 16.

Since his death, she's campaigned tirelessly to prevent knife crime. She was awarded an MBE from the Queen in 2011.
