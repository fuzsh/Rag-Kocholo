        "text": "\"All pregnancy tests have codes on them and when I opened my one I saw that the first three letters of the code were BEN. I got complete goosebumps all over and had this huge smile on my face.\"\n\nBrooke revealed she's kept the pregnancy test and will \"treasure\" it forever after believing her Ben had something to do with it.\n\n\"It gave me such a good feeling about it all. Usually you have to wait a couple of minutes for the result, but in this instance it went positive straight away,\" she explained.\n\n\"I just remember saying, “'Thank you, Ben.'\n\nIt comes after she admitted she and Simon were trying for a baby for two years before they received the good news that they were expecting.\n\nBrooke revealed that it \"took them a little while\" before they were blessed with little Elsie.\n\n\"We got married in December 2017 and we started trying pretty much straight away,\" she told OK! Magazine.\n\n\"I’m a big believer in fairy-tale movies, so I threw the contraception in the bin the day after we tied the knot. It took us a little while, but we got there in the end.\"\n\nBrooke's full interview is available to read now in OK! Magazine."
