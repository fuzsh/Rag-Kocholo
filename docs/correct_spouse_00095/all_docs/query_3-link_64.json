        "text": "Last week on behalf of InterTalent I hosted an #IWD event bringing together some brilliant women from across the entertainment industry. The aim was for us all to make some new relationships and connections of support in a world that can sometimes be a bit tricky to navigate and we absolutely achieved that! We were so very lucky to have the incredible Jo Elvin as our guest of honour and I was privileged to sit down and have a conversation with her about life lessons and sliding door moments. With performances by our wonderful Alice Brine and Beth McCarthy, the night was a huge success and thank you to all who came along and made it so. See you next year… ❤️\n\nKnife crime is one of the country’s most pressing problems. It has risen by 3% this year, and in the last 10 years we’ve witnessed a 76% rise. Children and young people continue to be the worst affected - teenagers are twice as likely to be murdered today than they were 10 years ago. It is truly a desperate situation. That’s why the work of The Ben Kinsella Truat is so important. Education is the catalyst to change: knife crime is not inevitable, it is preventable. You can help us. This week, for one week only, all donations to the Ben Kinsella Trust are doubled by match funders. So anything you can give is invaluable, twice over. Help us make a difference. Let’s #StopKnifeCrime https://lnkd.in/e-kFmceS ❤️💜\n\nIT’S THAT TIME… 🎄🎅🏻💖 CHRISTMAS IS COMING AND SO IS THE BIG GIVE!!! This year once again The Ben Kinsella Trust will be taking part in The Big Give Campaign when every single donation made makes twice the impact and gives us the chance to raise £50,000 for our charity! This amount is life changing for a small charity like ours and will help us continue our work which is sadly needed more than ever. So my amazing advent calendar raffle is back with more incredible prizes donated by some very wonderful and very kind brands - which means your good deed not only gets doubled but gives you the chance to get a lovely treat back too! The raffle will run until Sunday 26th November at 8pm when the winners will be chosen and the advent calendars sent out in time ready to open on 1st December so you have just three weeks to get your tickets! Prizes include: 🎄@libertylondon beauty calendar 🎄@spacenk fragrance calendar 🎄@maccosmetics calendar 🎄@mimiandlula classic calendar 🎄@avon_uk beauty calendar 🎄@elemis_uki The Ultimate Pro Collagen Set With further donations to be added! 🥰 Get your tickets below and thank you as always from the bottom of my heart ❤️ https://lnkd.in/eZUpJa5y"
