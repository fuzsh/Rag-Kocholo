        "text": "Former EastEnders' actress Brooke Kinsella has welcomed her second child with her husband Simon Boardley. The 38-year-old, who wed her husband back in 2017, has shared the exciting news with her fans over on social media today (June, 29).\n\nAfter giving birth to her miracle baby boy, she wrote: Ben Ross Boardley 29/06/22. A perfect miracle given to us on a day when so much was taken away. Named after the very best of men. He will do them so proud, I know it already\".\n\nBrooke's brother Ben was tragically stabbed to death in on June 29 in 2008 when he was just 16.\n\nMany of her followers were quick to congratulate the couple, reports the Mirror. One person said: \"Congratulations, he is beautiful.\" While another follower typed: \"Welcome to the world Ben Ross Boardley named after wonderful young man. A perfect gift to ease the pain of a day that took so much from you\"\n\n\"Oh me oh my! Ben. Welcome to the world. All the Bens are the best right!? Sending all our love to you and precious Ben\", another wrote.\n\nBrooke is already proud mum to daughter Elsie, 19 months.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2017, and Brooke has made no secret of the fact she wanted a little brother or sister for Elsie, who was born in September 2020.\n\nShe previously told OK!: \"I come from a really big family and I’m so close to my siblings. Having someone to go through life with is really important and I’d love to give Elsie that. There’s plenty of room in our home for another little one.\n\n\"We’re not getting any younger, so obviously we need to think about these things, but I’m not in a rush.\n\n\"I want to enjoy Elsie as a first-time mum and give her all the love and support that she needs. We’ll leave it up to the universe and see what happens.\"\n\nThe actress has been awarded an MBE for her charity work and has previously spoken of her heartache that Elsie will never have a relationship with her uncle.\n\nAnd little Elsie is also a reminder of Ben, as Brooke said during an appearance on Loose Women last year that her little girl resembled her late uncle.\n\nShe said she felt Ben's presence from the moment she realised she was pregnant, saying: \"As soon as I bought the Clearblue packet, I saw the word BEN. It was him making his presence known.\n\n\"Losing a sibling... who was one of my best friends... was hard. The thought of losing a child is utterly horrendous. Now I know what there is to lose, it broke my heart all over again.\""
