Created by Tony Jordan and introduced by Louise Berridge as a new Asian family, producers hoped they would become central to the show. However, after Indian actor Dalip Tahil was forced to leave due to a controversy over his work permit, a major plot involving the family had to be scrapped and was replaced with a kidney transplant storyline that was branded \"boring\". It was later revealed that the dropped storyline involved Dan being murdered by his children and buried in a shallow grave. The characters were also called \"unrealistic\", \"annoying\", and \"unlikeable\" by many of the show's fans and critics. They were blamed for a decline in the show's viewing figures and were eventually axed by Kathleen Hutchison after bosses struggled to find storylines for the family. Jordan later admitted the family's members were \"the least successful characters [he] created\".",
