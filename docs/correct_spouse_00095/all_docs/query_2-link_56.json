        "text": "Robert Lowell and Lady Caroline Blackwood\n\n“I was overcome with a pathological bout of enthusiasm.”\n\nRobert Lowell\n\nHistory\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\nHistory has to live with what was here,\n\nclutching and close to fumbling all we had—\n\nit is so dull and gruesome how we die,\n\nunlike writing, life never finishes.\n\nAbel was finished; death is not remote,\n\na flash-in-the-pan electrifies the skeptic,\n\nhis cows crowding like skulls against high-voltage wire,\n\nhis baby crying all night like a new machine.\n\nAs in our Bibles, white-faced, predatory,\n\nthe beautiful, mist-drunken hunter’s moon ascends—\n\na child could give it a face: two holes, two holes,\n\nmy eyes, my mouth, between them a skull’s no-nose—\n\nO there’s a terrifying innocence in my face\n\ndrenched with the silver salvage of the mornfrost.\n\nWhat have I learned this month? My appreciation for Lowell has grown, along with my empathy. The quote above is what endears maniac depressives to those around them. The lows are a cross to bear for all, but the highs, when in moderation, can power the world with their energy. I am envious of Lowell’s friendships among his vast circle of friends, and the talent in that remarkable group that helped each other become better writers, still recognizing the negative self destructive tendencies that these men and women had in their own lives and others. I wouldn’t go so far as to say I have grown to like Lowell the man, but I have grown to appreciate more of Lowell the artist and accept his humanness.\n\nRobert Lowell was the product of two generations of men of letters in this country and the patience and emotional intelligence of multiple women. His poetry evolved to fit the style that the New Critics applauded and rewarded; Merrill, Tate, Ransom, Warren, Jarrell, Taylor, Frost, Schwartz and Berryman literally molded Lowell out of clay. His passion and the depth in his poetry was influenced by Stafford, Hardwick, Blackwood and Bishop. Did Lowell win those two Pulitzers, or do all of them deserve some of the credit as well? Does it take a village to raise a poet? In Lowell’s case, I think the answer is yes.\n\nObviously, Lowell brought something to the table. I wonder though, if he had been born poor, with the same talents, and written the same words, would a single thing he ever wrote have seen the light of day from a publisher? Would he have had the financial ability and time to write? Even with the generous support and royalties he received from publishers, it was not enough to support him and his family without his father’s money to fill in the gaps. Talent publicly recognized is almost always influenced by luck as well. Lowell exists in American Lit history in part because of the opportunities his families wealth, connections and the power his birthright afforded him, if not for the access to publishing, then for the glimpse into the halls of power in this country and its moral authority and failings which he used for some of his poetic inspiration. Lowell may have been a confessional poet, but the history he shared was not just his own, it served as a sketchbook illustrating our broader society, his words a mirror for the American tendency towards narcissism that was reflected in his best work.\n\nLowell and Berryman always preferred criticism of their work by other writers. They were writing during a unique time in history, existing within a relatively small literary bubble, where the best critics, were also some of their best friends. There are tentacles in literature that extend from one generation to the next and influence poetry in ways that we may not even be aware. We owe a debt of gratitude to these men and women, who pushed poetry forward, in a legacy that would forever change how poetry is written and read today. Even if it some of that work led to dead ends, it forced open doors of change, either positively or negatively, because of their commitment to their writing. Sometimes things have to become broken to be put back together in a new more innovative way.\n\nThis past year in 2020, when several hundred poets of color demanded changes in the way the Poetry Foundation wields the power of its financial assets, and who sits as the gate keepers of that financial wealth, I applauded, even though it probably was painful to the multiple old white men who were forced to resign from the board of directors. We have to remind ourselves that giving birth is painful. It’s never easy and not to be taken for granted. All parties don’t always survive the process. Things don’t die and are buried because they did something wrong. Things die, because things need to die, so that the next generation has room to breathe and grow and thrive.\n\nAfter a month of reading Lowell, if I compare him to Berryman, there is no question which book of collected poems will continue to sit on my reading table; its Berryman’s. For sheer enjoyment of the written word and intellectual fun of the poetry and creativity, Berryman’s poetry wins in my world hands down. But it would have been easy for me to show case Berryman this year and stay in a familiar rut of sharing things I enjoy on Fourteenlines. The beginning of 2021 is a time of reckoning. This month has been a time for me to reassess white power and privilege that has shaped the past, my own included, and confront the underlying rot of white supremacy that is all around us, even in the creative arts and poetry. It’s easy for me to write about things I like. It’s much harder to write about things I don’t. And though I have learned a lot by writing about Lowell this month, I will be glad to move on.\n\nI wrote the poem below a week after the violence at the Capitol building in the midst of my month long journey with Lowell. I readily admit it is a troubling poem. I don’t like all the aspects of these characters. And yet it begs the question, if we dislike the artist, should we dislike the art? The risk of cancel culture is we cancel the very reminders of what not to be? How many of us learned our most important lessons in life not from a role model of the epitome of our ideals but from the fuck-ups in our midst that we wanted to not emulate? Spending a month in Lowell’s company and his cronies messes with you. Lowell leaned conservative right in his ideology in some of his writing, but did he believe it or use it as a mirror to society? Impossible to know. I don’t know why this poem shaped itself in my mind. If you were to count it out, it is roughly a sonnet, 14 lines. Was it inspiration for what could be a broader script for a play someday wrestling with the death of the sonnet and the ideas these men wrote about over a lifetime? There’s probably 90 minutes of pretty interesting dialogue waiting to be crafted if I tried to insert myself into the minds of these four men playing cards. What is it trying to tell me? What about the perspective their month of company has imparted, formed n my mind in both good ways and bad, that brought out this poem? I may delete this poem and post in a year because it isn’t relevant and reads like trite nonsense or I may find in it something I don’t see now? I honestly don’t like the men behind the art of all the writers I read. It doesn’t mean I find that disagreeable taste in my mouth any less worthwhile than the bitter coffee I sometimes choose to drink.\n\nEzra Pound, Robert Lowell, Randall Jarrell and John Berryman Play Euchre in Heaven\n\nBy T. A. Fry\n\n(This poem is intended to be read by screen play rules – words in parenthesis and gray italics should not be read out loud, rather help inform the reader on characters and plot. Lines in black are Robert Lowell’s. Lowell is partnered with Pound and Berryman is partnered with Jarrell.)\n\n. . “Jezzus Chrst Mr. Bones, would you stop dropping\n\nashes on the table. Lets do clubs – Pounder. “ ( Lowell winks)\n\n. . “Cal…. your move.* What’s with the winking?” (Berryman, staring at Lowell)\n\n. .\n\nIt’s a tick, he’s not tabl-talking the bower.” (Pound)\n\n“Henry…. pass me a pretzel with cheese on it. ”\n\n(Lowell leads the Jack of clubs)\n\n. . “Yes he is, see —- exerting his power….\n\n(Berryman passing the pretzel with a napkin, then picks up his cigarette, takes a long drag, exhaling a cloud Lowell’s way, muttering;)\n\nIt’s a damn shame, the state of the sonnet….”\n\n(Lowell takes the trick and leads the Queen of clubs)\n\n. . “What’d you guys think, the attack in D. C.?\n\nEzra – yu’old fascist, what’s your report?” (Jarrell)\n\n“… Relieved… bar’s been raised for traitorous crazy.”\n\n(Smiling as he lays the Jack of spades over top Lowell’s Queen and Berryman’s Ace and Jarrell’s sloughed off suit, taking the trick for the team.)\n\n. . “So am I! It’s great to see such support\n\nFor mental illness among the masses.\n\nIt’s amazing, I tell you, aammaazzzing,\n\nWhat these people pull out of their asses.”\n\n* When Berryman jumped to his death in 1972, the only identification on his body recovered from the river was a pair of sunglasses with his name on it and a blank check. Hamilton, in Lowell’s biography, claims Auden started a cruel rumor among the literati in New York City shortly thereafter that Berryman had in fact left a note, which read; “Cal, it’s your move.“\n\n“It’s a completely powerful and serious book, as good as anything in prose or poetry written by a ‘beat’ writer, and one of the most alive books written by any American for years. I don’t see how it could be considered immoral.”\n\nRobert Lowell (Speaking about criticism of The Dolphin)\n\nCritic\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\nIs my doubt, last flicker of the fading thing,\n\nan honorable subject for conversation?\n\nDo you know how you have changed from the true you?\n\nI would change my trueself if I could:\n\nI am doubtful . . . uncertain my big steps.\n\nI fear I leave many holes for a quick knife\n\nto take the blown rose from its wooden thorns.\n\nA critic should save her sharpest tongue for praise.\n\nOnly blood-donors retain the gift for words;\n\nblood gives being to everything that lives,\n\neven to exile where tried spirits sigh,\n\ndoing nothing the day because they think\n\nimagination matures from doing nothing\n\nhoping for choice, the child of vacillation.\n\nReading Hamilton’s biography about the final 5 years of Lowell’s life I felt only pity for Lowell and all who loved him. It had to be heartbreaking to watch a man with such intellect and creativity completely lose his mind, his spirit, his physicality. Blackwood couldn’t bear it, couldn’t stand to be in his presence when Lowell would enter a maniac phase. I think he agreed to lithium in part so that he could blunt the symptoms and maintain some semblance of home life with Blackwood, Sheridan and her daughters the first few years. But that decision had to come with some sacrifice to his creativity as well.\n\nBlackwood bought an estate called Millgate shortly after Sheridan’s arrival. They also had an apartment in London. Lowell loved the idea of being English gentry if not outright nobility, even though the Blackwood lineage was Irish. It was part of the fantasy of rebirth that Lowell was seeking by coming to London. There were happy times at Millgate, punctuated by episodes of anxiety, depression and mania. I get the rather confusing depiction from Hamilton that Lowell lived apart from Blackwood as much as he did with her and the children during their short marriage because of his mental illness and tendency of ADHD hyper focus on different projects. Lowell was a moth constantly in search of a new flame.\n\nLowell’s private life continued to be upended in the early 1970’s by multiple losses, chief among them Berryman and Pound in 1972 and Ransom in 1974. Lowell’s physical presence seemed to shrink in conjunction with each of these deaths, as his literary crowd of friends and colleagues and supporters dwindled about him.\n\nBy 1975, Lowell could feel his maniac attacks coming on as a physical sensation creeping up his spine. Blackwood describes one such incident where she took Lowell by train to his doctor in hopes of heading it off with an injection of valium and in the short interval between two train stops Lowell went from being lucid, though highly animated, to talking completely incoherently and out of touch with reality. These episodes terrified her and she refused to allow him to be around the children when he was in such a state. His doctors told her during this particular incident that it took extreme doses of valium to pacify Lowell and get him to relax, the doses given may have proved fatal to other patients, so intense was Lowell’s state of mind and physical aberration, one doctor described him like a “bull” in his ability to be nearly unaffected by the drugs at normally proscribed levels.\n\nBy 1976, Lady Blackwood’s patience and sanity frayed and the marriage was over. She sold Millgate and moved her and the children to Ireland, in part for tax purposes to save money realizing Lowell was unlikely to be able to adequately contribute to support the lifestyle they were living and in part to make it unlikely that Lowell would be able to follow them. It worked. Lowell realized he had mucked up his life with Blackwood in abandoning Hardwick and his daughter Harriet and began begging Lizzie if he could return to her side in New York as the one attempt to live in Ireland was a disaster. So pathetic was Lowell’s situation that Hardwick didn’t say yes, but she didn’t say no either, realizing wisely, that Lowell needed some little ribbon of hope to hold on to for the moment, while he/they figured something out.\n\nLowell died Sept 12, 1977 in a taxi cab on his way from the airport to visit Hardwick in New York. He had arrived earlier that day with a few possessions to discuss the possibility of a return to New York to live in a spare bedroom of Hardwick’s in New York City. When his taxi pulled up to the building the driver found him unresponsive in the back seat and thought he was asleep. Hardwick was summoned by the doorman and she knew he was dead the moment she climbed in as the taxi drove them to the hospital. Later, when she went through his things he had brought with him, she found he had been clutching a wrapped oil painting by Freud when he died, a portrait of Blackwood. Lowell was grasping at straws, his anxiety tearing him to pieces, torn between two lovers right to the very end. He was 60 years old, his frequent predictions of premature death having come true.\n\n“The world is absolutely out of control now and is not going to be save by any reason or unreason.”\n\nRobert Lowell\n\nIf you are a numerologist and believe there are signs in numbers, then Lowell’s two Pulitzers, which bookended his career, might be more than chance; Lord Weary’s Castle in 1947 and The Dolphin in 1974. I have never thought about how the Pulitzer prize for poetry is awarded until this month, not quite understanding where other’s saw the genius in Lowell’s writing. The Pulitzer prize for poetry is awarded based on a panel of five individuals, apparently nameless each year, whose simple majority vote on submissions from the previous year determines the winner or they can decide to award it to a new work from a poet that was not entered with a 75% vote from the group. The prize is awarded each year at a luncheon by the President of Columbia University in May.\n\nIn looking through the list of distinguished winners from 1970 to 2020, it is a remarkable group, both for who is included and who is not among its ranks of honorees. However, in that 50 year period, I highly doubt no work received more scathingly negative reviews than Lowell’s The Dolphin. Adrienne Rich chief among them who eviscerated The Dolphin for seeing it for what it was, being neither literature or thoughtful. In my opinion, Lowell’s final Pulitzer was a turning point, in challenging the white male power structure of who gets enshrined in the gilded halls of literature. It took a while but the absurdity of Lowell’s recognition for The Dolphin rang like a bell for the remainder of the 1970’s well into the 1980’s. I don’t know if the Pulitzer committee finally came to their senses and realized that maybe severe mental illness ought to be taken into consideration for who wins the award. For whatever reason, that bell that was rung by literary criticism of its time, began to resonate and caused white male classical poets to sink into greater and greater obscurity, for good reason and for good riddance. The sonnet fading along with them over the past 50 years, except in the hands of a few poets of color who have managed to imbue it with greater complexity, around themes of social justice and restore the sonnet with some bit of dignity it might still deserve.\n\nSo why do I write sonnets? Ouch, its a tougher question after spending a month with Lowell; a serious question I need to ask myself again. I have always known that this project and my sonnet obsession would eventually run its course. My intent has been to carry this project forward for three more years and end it in December of 2023, as a way to fully explore something, deeply, uncomfortably, trans-formatively; to push myself beyond the first barrier, the second, the third, etc., until I lose count and the effort is the joy and joy is the work. I am still committed to pushing onward. I believe there are still some sonnets hiding beneath my finger tips, in my subconscious, waiting to come forth when my muse whispers in my ear that are worthy of putting to paper and worthy of the process and structure, even if they are written only for my eyes. But I know I have hit the apex of this journey and the question is now, what will I do with this understanding on the long slow descent I still have planned? How will it effect my creativity in what lies ahead in my exploration of writing in 14 lines?\n\nWho are my true role models in poetry 8 years into this project? It isn’t Lowell, it isn’t Berryman, it isn’t Pound, or Schwartz, or Ransom or Merrill or Tate or Bishop or Plath. So who is it? Next January it is still my intent to explore Rita Dove, Tracey K. Smith, Terrance Hayes and several other poets of color who have taken the sonnet in fresh directions over the past 40 years and breathed into it new life, with the idea that by doing a deeper dive into their poetry it will unfold interesting ideas in my conscious and subconscious. And it is my hope that by contrasting the contributions to poetry by Lowell in 14 lines with these poets that it will point me to some semblance of relevance that still lingers in the sonnet form.\n\nToday’s two sonnets I have shared both come from The Dolphin. Both beg the question is great poetry based on emotional honesty? Or is nothing ever actually “true” in poetry? The process of writing is it a lie we tell ourselves in that moment a word is written that our thoughts matter beyond the scrap of paper they are written on or is it the road we owned for only a brief wonderful moment?\n\nMarriage?\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\n“I think of you every minute of the day,\n\nI love you every minute of the day;\n\nyou gone is hollow, bored, unbearable.\n\nI feel under some emotional anesthetic\n\nunable to plan or think or write or feel;\n\nmais ça ira, these things will go, I feel\n\nin an odd way against appearances,\n\nthings will come out right with us, perhaps.\n\nAs you say, we got across the Godstow Marsh,\n\nreached Cumberland and its hairsbreadth Roman roads,\n\nclimbed Hadrian’s Wall, and scared the stinking Pict.\n\nMarriage? That’s another story. We saw\n\nthe diamond glare of morning on the tar.\n\nFor a minute had the road as if we owned it.”\n\n“As you get older no doubt you’ll change automatically, just like I did. You will learn all the tricks. You will dress much better, and talk much more, and listen much less. And you’ll start to realise that it never does one much good to take anything too seriously at all.”\n\nCaroline Blackwood, from Great Granny Webster.\n\nNo Telling\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\n(For Caroline)\n\nHow much less pretentiously, more maliciously\n\nwe talk of a close friend to other friends\n\nthan shine stars for his festschrift! Which is truer –\n\nthe uncomfortable full dress of words for print,\n\nor wordless conscious not even no one ever seen?\n\nThe best things I can tell you face to face\n\ncoarsen my love of you in solitary.\n\nSee that long lonesome road? it must end\n\nat the will and second of the end – all —-\n\nI am still a young man not done running around . . . .\n\nThe great circuit of the stars lies on jewellers’ velvet;\n\nbe close enough to tell me when I will die—-\n\nwhat will love do not knowing it will die?\n\nNo telling, no telling . . . not even a last choice.\n\nSpending a month with Lowell has resurrected thoughts in my mind that poets, particularly self described confessional poets, like doctors, should take an oath before they publish anything or even share it with friends, that boils down to the same thing: do no harm. I have considered this carefully in my own writing, what is poetry and what is not. Poems that at first construction and rumination I thought were poetry turned out to be no more than self serving rubbish. Thank goodness I let them sit on a dark shelf of my computer’s hard drive for a few years, where no one could see them, aging like blue cheese going off, getting stinkier and stinkier until I could smell them for what they were, moldy nonsense; grateful to discard them forever with the flick of the delete button without having embarrassed myself by having shared them with anyone else.\n\nDo no harm; in hindsight it would have been a good motto for Lowell to embrace. Neither Stanley Kunitz, Elizabeth Bishop nor Peter Taylor could dissuade Lowell from his worst impulses after reading the early drafts of The Dolphin and some of the poems in For Lizzie and Harriet. Bishop and Kunitz both are eloquent in their warnings to him as friends who dearly love him to rethink his plan to put some of this work out in print, predicting correctly the act of publication would forever damage his relationship with his still then wife Hardwick and daughter Harriet. Their warnings were spot on. They were aghast that Lowell was mixing poetic fiction and real letters in ways to make it self-servingly dramatic or ” more literary” (my air quotes), but would hopelessly confuse readers and be forever a betrayal of Hardwick’s personal confidence by including the backbone of their actual correspondence.\n\nLowell did not heed their advice. Lowell’s approach to poetry in the final years of his life was more napalm than literature; burn it all to the ground. I have read and reread the final hundred pages of Hamilton’s biography several times trying to wrap my head around the timeline and sequence of events and its not my imagination that even Hamilton’s meticulous and respectful retelling is a bit confusing. In it he says, that in reviewing the vast amount of letters between Lowell, Hardwick and friends, and interviewing surviving friends and family, even those closest to Lowell had a hard time remembering the specifics of Lowell’s numerous breakdowns during that final 10 years, so frequent in nature, it all began to run together in people’s minds.\n\nLowell’s medical treatment for maniac depression from the early 1950’s until 1967 had been primarily one of taking phenothiazines, mostly Thorazine, combined with supportive talk therapy, but not actual Freudian or Jungian analysis, at least not formally and consistently. The reason for this was Lowell tended to move so frequently throughout this time and was considered too mentally ill to properly participate in the process that no reputable psychiatrist would take him on as a patient. In 1967 a new miracle drug emerged; lithium carbonate and Lowell was immediately prescribed it. The initial indications were that the lithium salt had the optimum combination of effects to level out maniac depressives, like Lowell, reducing highs and lows, creating a flatter version of their outward selves. Today I do not look at lithium as a healing medicine but rather as an example of scientific abuse, knowing the side effects can be worse than the cure. I have had several friends over the years, whose parents put them on lithium without their permission as young teenagers during the late 1960’s early 1970’s, only to lose themselves and years of their lives to a drug induced haze they would only emerge after reaching an age of emancipation where they could decide for themselves what they ingested. Lithium is serious shit. It might make a great rechargeable battery but it sucks as a bi-polar therapeutic. I realize, it was with good intention that Lowell was put on lithium by his care givers at the time, but remember they were still performing full and partial lobotomies on people during the late 1960’s in patient’s “best interests.” The hope was that this drug combination could be a preventative for Lowell, reducing or eliminating his frequent debilitating maniac/depressive episodes. It doesn’t sound from Hamilton’s retelling that this course of action succeeded.\n\nIt is impossible to briefly summarize all that happened from 1968 to 1970, but here goes:\n\nLowell, while teaching at Harvard in 1967 – 1968, and still in an on again, off again relationship with Hardwell (Elizabeth supportive, still married to him, but not always living with him and raising their young daughter largely as a single mother) enters an increasingly unstable maniac period that undermines his effectiveness as a professor. Hardwell watches on in ever increasingly detached concern as Lowell veers from one professional project, one travel misadventure, one hospitalization and one romantic affair to another.\n\nBy the end of 1969, Lowell’s reputation, although still at a high point globally, is in serious jeopardy in New York and Boston, having fallen apart so often personally and professionally, that the academic and literary crowd he runs with in the states are growing tired of his antics and all but his closest friends are pulling back. Lowell sensibly decides its time to seek a rebirth across the pond, and lines up two separate University jobs in London in 1970; one is more an artist in residency at All Souls in Oxford and the other a teaching position at the University of Essex. The two institutions could not be more different, Oxford All Souls is like an old shoe, comfortable, decidedly white male and tribally imperial, while Essex is a hotbed of liberal sociologists and socialists and tinged with budding feminism.\n\nAnd then complete chaos ensues.\n\nI can’t actually figure it all out. It is a total soap opera, I am amazed Netflix has not made Lowell’s life into a movie, everyone would assume its fiction. Lowell meets Lady Caroline Blackwood at a dinner party in spring of 1970, I think in New York and becomes completely infatuated with her when he moves to London to prepare for his new employment. He proceeds into a complete and total mental breakdown during the summer in London, at one point locking her in his apartment for three days, Blackwood literally fearing for his life and her safety, not wanting Lowell to be in contact with her three young children and finally wrangles him into a psychiatric hospital in London. Blackwood feigns illness herself, escapes Lowell and ghosts him temporarily, leaving Hardwick to arrive on the scene from New York to intercede on Lowell’s behalf and oversee his care. Hardwick finds him so heavily drugged that she is relieved he can’t hurt himself but also finds him so out of his mind that their relationship is irrevocably damaged when the full truth of his recent shenanigans finally comes spilling out over the extent of his various recent affairs including his bi-polar love of Blackwood and herself. Lowell is crazy enough to think he can have his cake and eat it too, but Hardwick quickly sets him straight on that account and heads back to New York. Lowell manages to get himself put together enough to start his two University appointments in the fall of 1970, though he is not well received at either college, when his fellow faculty realize that Lowell is not the man they had imagined based on his prior work and reputation. None the less Lowell manages to fly right enough to figure out a path forward, even managing to get back into Caroline’s good graces enough to get pregnant over Christmas break; champagne and poetry mixed with love and mistletoe is a strange, strange bird indeed. My god, some peoples parents New Year’s eve parties!\n\nSheridan Lowell arrives into this world September 28, 1971. Remarkably, his arrival seems to be in some ways, just what Robert Lowell needed. The intervening years from 1972 to his death in 1977, although still punctuated by multiple break downs and hospitalizations, with Lady Blackwood assuming the role of protector, lover and guardian, were equal parts productive and destructive, but there were moments of peace. Lowell ages fast in photographs during those five years. His parents both died when they were 60 and he is completely aware of his diminishment. Lowell’s lifetime of self destructive habitual heavy drinking, smoking and prescription psychotic drugs having taken their toll and he is consciously aware that he can feel his life force ebbing away.\n\nLowell and Hardwick were divorced in 1972, but never unentangled from one another, neither emotionally, or poetically or as parents of a 13 year old daughter. Lowell found in Blackwood a new muse and intellectual confidante, that carried him through his final years and gave him whatever it was he needed to publish his final books of poetry. Lady Blackwood, born into a sliver of the Guinness fortune, lived a remarkable life, enchanting Lucien Freud, the painter and son of Sigmund Freud, in her early 20’s, ultimately marrying him for five years. By the time Sheridan arrived, the youngest of her four children, she was 41 years old, two-thirds of the way through her own journey, destined to die young of cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nIn trying to figure out what poems to match to this blog post, I decided to focus on poems written for Caroline and her daughter Ivana, the youngest of her three daughters born while married to the pianist Israel Citkowitz. Blackwood was 22 years Citkowitz’s junior and by the time Ivana was born in 1966, their marriage was over, though Citkowitz remained a close and loving father, living nearby in good standing with his children.\n\nBoth the sonnets No Telling and Ivana were published in The Dolphin, separated by only a couple of pages, towards the end of the book. The word festschrift means a collection of writing published in honor of a scholar. When he published History, For Lizzie and Harriet and The Dolphin, against the advice of his friends who were scholars, was Lowell blindly motivated because he viewed it in its entirety his own festschrift? The last two lines of Ivana in my opinion are not about her, its all about Lowell. Then again, everything he published in 1973 in my opinion was to feed his own ego, desires and fears, and not for the betterment of poetry.\n\nIvana\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\nSmall-soul-pleasing, loved with condescension,\n\neven though the cro-magnon tirades of six,\n\nthe last madness of child-gaiety\n\nbefore the trouble of the world shall hit.\n\nBeing chased upstairs is still instant-heaven,\n\nnot yet your sisters’ weekends of voluntary scales,\n\naccompanying on a recorder carols\n\nrescored by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart in Kent.\n\nThough burned, you are hopeful, accident cannot tell you\n\nexperience is what you do not want to experience.\n\nIs the teenager the dominant of ache?\n\nOr flirting seniles, their conversation three noises,\n\ntheir life-expectancy shorter than the martyrs?\n\nHow all ages hate another age,\n\nand lifelong wonder what was the perfect age?\n\nIf youth is a defect, it is one we outgrow too soon.\n\nRobert Lowell\n\nFor John Berryman I\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\nI feel I know what you have worked through, you\n\nknow what I have worked through – we are words,\n\nJohn, we used the language as if we made it.\n\nLuck threw up the coin, and the plot swallowed,\n\nmonster yawning for its mess of potage.\n\nAh privacy, as if we had preferred mounting\n\nsome rock by a mossy stream and counting the sheep\n\nto fame that renews the soul but not the heart.\n\nThe out-tide flings up wonders: rivers, linguini,\n\nbeercans, mussels, bloodstreams; how gaily the gallop\n\nto catch the ebb – Herbert, Thoreau, Pascal,\n\nborn to die with the enlarged hearts of athletes at forty –\n\nAbraham sired with less expectancy,\n\nheaven his friend, the earth his follower.\n\nHistory, published in 1973, contains 360 separate 14 line poems. I don’t know what to make of them. I have sat down and read them all, an accomplishment that likely puts me in rare company of poetry readers these days. There are some I found captivating in the way a car crash can be captivating and forced me to head to Goggle to investigate references and think about them a bit more. Others appear to be no more than drafts of unfinished poems. There are tributes to all his friends, fellow writers and writers he admired throughout his lifetime along with postcards of poems on almost every topic imaginable, written for reasons only known to Lowell. It is an odd assemblage of stuff, feeling more like a writer’s notebook than a book of poetry. I question if Lowell was not the figure in American Lit that he was at the time, whether all but a handful of the 360 would have ever been published. What’s fascinating is it’s History in many ways that is the foundation of Lowell’s reputation as a confessional poet. Yet, as an assemblage of work, it creates more questions in my mind than answers in terms of Lowell’s talents and state of mind when they were written. It feels to me like Lowell is drawing on his reputation from the past in its publishing, and less pushing the envelope forward on his talent as a poet. Hamilton notes in his biography, that by 1968, Lowell was writing three to four 14 line poems a week. At that pace of writing, it is obvious that there is not the careful construction and word-smithing, repeated editing that was a feature of his earlier work. Gone is the craftsmanship of being a poet and in its place is speed dating, energy in its wild exuberance, but it can be hit or miss in the end result.\n\nIn History, one gets the impression that writing and confessional poetry has become less a calling or a passion and more a cross to bear for Lowell. He appears to be compelled to bare all his scars, all his good, all his failings and his families failings before all, for the poetry to speak his truth. It is not a good look. Most middle aged men look better keeping their clothes on, particularly if you can afford a tailored suit in New York.\n\nJohn Berryman won the Pulitzer prize for poetry in 1965 for Dream Songs. As a work that is a complete poetic vision of a lifetime, Dream Songs is remarkable. It is cohesive in the way Berryman evolved his poetic vision and has continuity in the narrative that the poems express in an arc of an interconnected story throughout the course of the book. It is is both autobiographical and fictional in ways that offer a connection between writer and reader that in my mind is masterful. And it has a sense of humor and a sense of purpose that appears to be completely lacking from Lowell’s History. There is no comparison between the two books in my opinion. History feels to me like a bit of professional jealousy, where Lowell was trying to play catch up to Berryman. There are poems in History I admire, but as a whole it is a hot mess in my opinion. For that reason, it is impossible to only pick out two poems to share from it, out of the 360 poems in total, and pretend I am representing the breadth of the ideas contained within it. Good or bad, pick I have.\n\nHistory, is but one of three volumes of poetry, Lowell published in 1973. To say one comes before the other would be inaccurate, as the writing contained in all three were interconnected. Over the next several days, I’ll touch on the other two (For Lizzie and Harriet and The Dolphin), and summarize the events in Lowell’s life during the 1970s.\n\nTwo Walls\n\n(1968, Martin Luther King’s Murder)\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\nSomewhere a white wall faces a white wall,\n\none wakes the other, the other wakes the first,\n\neach burning with the other’s borrowed splendor –\n\nthe walls, awake, are forced to go on talking,\n\ntheir color looks much alike, two shadings of white,\n\neach living in the shadow of the other.\n\nHow fine our distinctions when we cannot choose!\n\nDon Giovanni can’t stick his sword through stone,\n\ntwo contracting, white stone walls – their pursuit\n\nof happiness and his, coincident. . . .\n\nAt this point of civilization, this point of the world,\n\nthe only satisfactory companion we\n\ncan imagine is death – this morning, skin lumping in my throat,\n\nI lie here, heavily breathing, the soul of New York.\n\nIn the long run wives are to be paid in a peculiar coin – consideration for their feelings. As it usually turns out this is an enormous, unthinkable inflation few men will remit, or if they will, only with a sense of being overcharged.\n\nElizabeth Hardwick\n\nThe Infinite\n\nby Leopardi\n\nTranslated by Robert Lowell\n\nThe hill pushed off by itself was always dear\n\nto me and the hedges near\n\nit that cut away of the final horizon.\n\nWhen I would sit there lost in deliberation,\n\nI reasoned most on the interminable spaces\n\nbeyond all hills, on there antedilvuian resignation\n\nand silence that passes\n\nbeyond man’s possibility.\n\nHere for a little while my heart is quiet inside me;\n\nand when the wind lifts roughing through the trees,\n\nI set about comparing my silence to those voices,\n\nand I think about the eternal, the dead seasons,\n\nthings here at hand and alive,\n\nand all their reasons and choices.\n\nIt’s sweet to destroy my mind\n\nand go down\n\nand wreck in this sea where I drown.\n\nThe early 1960’s saw Lowell and Hardwick transition from mostly Boston, where Lowell had been receiving care on and off through the 1950’s, to a more permanent New York residence for the decade. During this decade he published Imitations in 1961, a book of translations, from which The Infinite comes and The Union Dead in 1964. Imitations was met with mostly a blah response from readers and critics and mediocre reviews, not something Lowell was accustomed. His friends rallied around it but the general feedback was Lowell made Rilke, sound like Lowell and Rilke and Pasternak, generally didn’t read well as Lowell. In the first half of the decade Lowell dabbled in creating a magazine, wrote a screen play, which led to an embarrassing affair with an actress involved in its production and generally was his normal irascible undisciplined self, writing mostly productively and mostly misbehaving personally. Then things derailed a bit in the middle. His dear friend Randall Jarrell died, along with several other writers in his sphere (Roethke, MacNeice, Blackmur) and he spent most of 1965 and 1966 in mourning, depressed doing very little writing or much of anything else.\n\nBut in 1967, things changed and Lowell entered a period of maniac productivity again. He began writing what would become History, Lowell’s derivation of Berryman’s The Dream Songs and was politically active in his vocal resistance to injustice and opposition to the Vietnam War. He was active in writing for magazines and critiques of other writers work. He supported Eugene McCarthy’s campaign and was a vocal critic of Nixon. He was to be on the losing side politically as the decade stretched on and in his marriage. Hardwick continued to support him emotionally and stayed by his side through his ups and downs. Lowell did not hold up his side of the bargain.\n\nIn a sonnet published in Notebook, Lowell mixes his Mother’s and his own perspectives, in the kind of painful confessional style that renders all the fat off the bone:\n\nAfter my marriage, I found myself in constant\n\ncompanionship with this almost stranger I found\n\nneither agreeable, interesting, nor admirable.,\n\nthough he was always kind and irresponsible.\n\nThe first years after our first child was born,\n\nthe daddy was out at seas, that helped, I could bask\n\nin the rest and stimulation of my dreams,\n\nbut the courtship was too swift, the disembarkement\n\ndangerously abrupt. I was animal,\n\nhealthy, easily tired: I adored luxury,\n\nand should have been an extrovert: I usually\n\nmanaged to make myself pretty comfortable. . . .\n\nWell ‘ she laughed, ‘we both were glad to dazzle.\n\nA genius temperament should be handled with care.’\n\nUnlike Imitations, For the Union Dead was generally well received, and continued to cement his place in the firmament of literature at the time. He had ample opportunities to lecture and write, his body of work and awards opened doors at prestigious Universities for short term gigs lecturing and writing. But in reading his poetry and about his life during this decade, its questionable if that success in the mid point of his career calmed his mind and reassured his ego. The second to last poem in The Union Dead is Night Sweat, a dual sonnet. It suggests life was not easy living inside Robert Lowell’s head. Though obviously grateful for his wife’s support, and eloquent at times about acknowledging it, he would not through his actions in the end reciprocate the trust she had placed in him.\n\nNight Sweat\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\nWork-table, litter, books and standing lamp,\n\nplain things, my stalled equipment, the old broom –\n\nbut I am living in a tidied room,\n\nfor ten nights now I’ve felt the creeping damp\n\nfloat over my pajamas’ wilted white . . .\n\nSweet salt embalms me and my head is wet,\n\neverything streams and tells me this is right;\n\nmy life’s fever is soaking in night sweat –\n\none life, one writing! But the downward glide\n\nand bias of existing wrings us dry –\n\nalways inside me is the child who died,\n\nalways inside me is his will to die-\n\none universe, one body . . . . in this urn\n\nthe animal night sweats of the spirit burn.\n\nBehind me! You! Again I feel the light\n\nlighten my leaded eyelids, while the gray\n\nskulled horses whinny for the soot of night.\n\nI dabble in the dapple of the day,\n\na heap of wet clothes, seamy, shivering,\n\nI see my flesh and bedding washed with light,\n\nmy child exploding into dynamite,\n\nmy wife. . . your lightness alters everything,\n\nas your heart hops and flutters like a hare.\n\nPoor turtle, tortoise, if I cannot clear\n\nthe surface of these troubled waters here,\n\nabsolve me, help me, Dear Heart, as you bear\n\nthis world’s dead weight and cycle on your back.\n\nTalking about the past is like a cat’s trying to explain climbing down a ladder.\n\nRobert Lowell\n\nTerminal Days at Beverly Farms (Excerpt)\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\nFather and Mother moved to Beverly Farms\n\nto be a two minute walk from the station,\n\nhalf an hour by train from the Boston doctors.\n\nThey had no sea-view,\n\nbut sky-blue tracks of the commuters’ railroad shone\n\nlike a double-barreled shotgun\n\nthrough the scarlet late August sumac,\n\nmultiplying like cancer\n\nat their garden’s border.\n\nFather had had two coronaries.\n\nHe still treasured underhand economies,\n\nbut his best friend was his little black Chevie,\n\ngaraged like a sacrificial steer\n\nwith gilded hooves,\n\nyet sensationally sober,\n\nand with less side than an old dancing pump.\n\nThe local dealer, a “buccaneer,”\n\nhad been bribed a “king’s ransom”\n\nto quickly deliver a car without chrome.\n\nEach morning at eight-thirty,\n\ninattentive and beaming,\n\nloaded with his “calc” and “trig” books,\n\nhis clipper ship statistics,\n\nand his ivory slide rule,\n\nFather stole off with the Chevie\n\nto load in the Maritime Museum at Salem.\n\nHe called the curator\n\n“the commander of the Swiss Navy.”\n\nFather’s death was abrupt and unprotesting.\n\nHis vision was still twenty-twenty.\n\nAfter a morning of anxious, repetitive smiling,\n\nhis last words to Mother were:\n\n“I feel awful.”\n\nThere are photographs where the intent of the picture is one thing and the truth of it another. Knowing that this was a staged photograph by a professional photographer shortly before or after Harriet’s baptism, and that more than one picture would have been taken, it is hard to understand why this version would be the one to make it into the family archives. Few new fathers allow the truth of their inner uncertainty about the business of being a new father to be so clearly on display for friends and relatives to see, let alone what a grown up Harriet might think.\n\nLowell’s next book to be published was Life Studies in 1959, two years after Harriet’s birth. Life Studies won the National Book Award for poetry in 1960. The poems are innately personal, biographical, stark and a bit of a slog to read. They are inconsistent in tone, some critics claim intentionally, and very much an attempt to stitch together his relationships within his family and himself and his past. They are a reflection of the time politically in this country as well as what had happened to Lowell personally during the decade of the 1950’s, in which he spent a period mid-decade in ancestral worship in trying to right his ship and bring things into focus.\n\nThe 1950’s in Hamilton’s biography for Lowell are a series of breakdowns, hospitalizations, recoveries, improvements, productivity, then a slide into episodes of heavy drinking and depression, only to rinse and repeat. Lowell had the financial means from his parents to have a stable home life during this chaos and the love and support of Hardwick through it all. During periods of productivity in this decade, Lowell was exploring the flexibility that free verse provided and decoupling the classical structure from the narratives he felt compelled to share. He was energized by the possibilities to connect the old and the new in a different confessional voice of poetry he felt was needed to convey the truth of his past for a new future. There is only one typical sonnet contained within Life Studies, and its one I have already shared on Fourteenlines; the sonnet To Speak of Woe That Is In Marriage, a dark misogynistic nightmare where no intimacy exists between man and wife, only destructive, unemotional copulation. it’s unclear who Lowell is channeling To Speak of Woe, himself, his father, someone else? Regardless Lowell’s subconscious was on full display.\n\nMuch of Life Studies draws on his family history and its clear he wrote far beyond what was published during that time. Hamilton shares a draft of a previously unpublished sonnet in his biography of Lowell. The sonnet was written shortly after Lowell’s Father’s death in 1950, the Navy Admiral Robert Traill Spence Lowell III.\n\nFour years have left Dunbarton much the same,\n\nMother, another stone, another name,\n\nAnd you, earth’s orbit? You are things,\n\nNo you, no person. Ah, the king of kings,\n\nLittle Napoleon, whose bolting food\n\nSo caught your fancy, caught your horror stood\n\nBlotting your minutes after Father died.\n\nNo bustle, bustle, bustle. Groom and bride\n\nlie cot by cot. Once more they feel the spark\n\nDive through the unnerved marrow of their dark,\n\nA person breaking through his prison term,\n\nWhere now as then, relapsing. Oh a germ,\n\nStudies his navel, graphs and charts and maps\n\nGentle to all, and loving none perhaps.\n\nHamilton writes:\n\nIt is small wonder that when Lowell made the decision to shift from this kind of mechanical regularity to the spacious relaxation of free verse, he was somewhat dazzled by his own boldness, for a period, at any rate, he was content simply to “take liberties,” to relish the sheer drasticness of what he’d done.\n\nBut in reading Hamilton’s biography, there appears to be nothing relaxed about Lowell’s writing process. The entire process of writing the poems that would make up Life Studies was punctuated by manic depressive episodes, endless rewrites and revisions in the period leading up to the final drafts, a process that utterly drained Lowell and all those around him, resulting in another series of locked ward hospitalizations at its conclusion. Very little about Lowell’s life appears to have been “relaxing” for his spouse, friends and supporters. From Hamilton’s descriptions, Lowell is what I would describe as a high maintenance individual.\n\nLife Studies concludes with Skunk Hour, dedicated to Elizabeth Bishop, that in my opinion is more an inside joke between the two of them than the tour du force poem based on the praise that the critics heaped upon it. Regardless, it has a playful quality that definitely sets it apart from most of the rest of the book and again, in my opinion, is a poor second as Lowell’s response to Bishop’s Armadillo. Why Life Studies won the National Book Award for poetry is completely beyond me. I dare wonder if Lowell was a fledgling writer in 2021, submitting these same poems for publication today, would he win the acclaim he did or would he be resoundingly rejected? Some poets and poems stand the test of time, words that go well beyond their age and period. Lowell in my mind is not one of them. He is a poet very much connected and a reflection of his time. And his time has come and gone.\n\nSkunk Hour\n\nRobert Lowell\n\nFor Elizabeth Bishop\n\nNautilus Island’s hermit\n\nheiress still lives through winter in her Spartan cottage;\n\nher sheep still graze above the sea.\n\nHer son’s a bishop.

He didn’t function particularly well with one either, but it was as Elizabeth Hardwick’s spouse that he found the greatest stability and productivity of his career. When you look at Lowell’s history of relationships there is a tendency for them to be cemented under duress. When Hardwick and Lowell connected at Yaddo in the fall of 1948, Hardwick was scheduled to depart, but fell for Lowell’s affections and decided to stay on. During the early part of 1949, while both were in residence, there was a scandal at Yaddo, when the FBI, on the vigilant lookout at the time for communist spies among liberal artists, visited Yaddo and interviewed Hardwick on the activities of Agnes Smedley, a writer on Far East politics and a known Marxist. Intertwined among all this was another scandal, the fact that current year’s Bollinger award had been given to Pound, who had published a book of poems while being imprisoned for his support of Mussolini. The zealous nature of the federal government during this period to root out fascists, socialists and communists from all reaches of American life, and particularly the arts lead them to Yaddo, who had several individuals involved in both scandals. The long and the short of it is, in a complicated and only partially verifiable report, the long finger of Hoover’s FBI was pointed at Smedley and other’s at Yaddo for some involvement in some unproven nefarious scheme to steal government secrets and FBI agents showed up to root out the foreign agents of a supposed communist plot. Hardwick was one of the people interviewed about the same time the two of them were falling in love and this was just the kind of heavy handed government interference that was in Robert Lowell’s wheel house of righteous indignation. He promptly applied the full powers of his maniac intellect and family connections to cry foul; and come to his lady’s aid, loudly! This kind of moral, emotional and political support strengthened their bond, but it also fed Lowell’s unhealthy manic side with the inevitable outcome that there was going to be a crash, sooner or later. As it turned out, it was sooner.\n\nI mention this only for context around Lowell’s three major accomplishments in 1949; he reconnected with the Catholic Church in a fervent elevation of piety, he had a nervous breakdown and he married Elizabeth Hardwick. Lowell is quoted in Ian Hamilton’s biography as telling Hardwick before they married, while in the midst of a deepening depression; “No one can care for me, …… I have ruined my life. I’ll always be mad.” Hardwick married him anyway in his parents home in Boston late in 1949 and it was agreed by all, he should be admitted to Payne Whitney clinic in New York for treatment shortly after the honeymoon to sort himself out in January of 1950.\n\nLowell’s second volume of poetry, The Mills of the Kavanaughs, was published in 1951 and obviously written during these turbulent years. The long form poems are imbued with a rising moral authority and psychiatric insights about himself and his family and for the most part, are not my cup of tea. However, when I take the time to focus on portions, there is remarkable beauty. I admire that he kept writing during this time of personal chaos. The best of The Mills of the Kavanaughs, both the poem and the book, is a foreshadowing of what was to come next, his best work, which would set him apart in American Literature, all written under the loving care and intelligence of Lizzie Hardwick.\n\nThe Mills of the Kavanaughs (Excerpt)\n\nby Robert Lowell\n\nThe leaves, sun’s yellow, listen, Love, they fall.\n\nShe hears her husband, and she tries to call\n\nHim, then remembers. Burning stubble roars\n\nAbout the garden. Columns fill the life\n\nInsurance calendar on which she scores.\n\nThe lady laughs. She shakes her parsol.\n\nThe table rattles, and she chews her pearled,\n\nOnce telescopic pencil, till its knife\n\nSnaps open, “Sol,” she whipsers, laughing, “Sol,\n\nIf you will help me, I will win the world.”\n\nHer husband’s thumbnail scratches on her comb.\n\nA boy is pointing at the sun. He cries:\n\nO dandelion, wish my wish, be true,\n\nAnd blows the callow pollen in her eyes.\n\n“Harry,” she whispers, “we are far from home –\n\nA boy and a girl a-Maying in the blue\n\n“The armored cars of dreams, contrived to let us do so many a dangerous thing.”\n\n― Elizabeth Bishop\n\nThe Armadillo\n\nby Elizabeth Bishop\n\nFor Robert Lowell\n\nThis is the time of year\n\nwhen almost every night\n\nthe frail, illegal fire balloons appear.\n\nClimbing the mountain height,\n\nrising toward a saint\n\nstill honored in these parts,\n\nthe paper chambers flush and fill with light\n\nthat comes and goes, like hearts.\n\nOnce up against the sky it’s hard\n\nto tell them from the stars—\n\nplanets, that is—the tinted ones:\n\nVenus going down, or Mars,\n\nor the pale green one. With a wind,\n\nthey flare and falter, wobble and toss;\n\nbut if it’s still they steer between\n\nthe kite sticks of the Southern Cross,\n\nreceding, dwindling, solemnly\n\nand steadily forsaking us,\n\nor, in the downdraft from a peak,\n\nsuddenly turning dangerous.\n\nLast night another big one fell.\n\nIt splattered like an egg of fire\n\nagainst the cliff behind the house.\n\nThe flame ran down. We saw the pair\n\nof owls who nest there flying up\n\nand up, their whirling black-and-white\n\nstained bright pink underneath, until\n\nthey shrieked up out of sight.\n\nThe ancient owls’ nest must have burned.\n\nHastily, all alone,\n\na glistening armadillo left the scene,\n\nrose-flecked, head down, tail down,\n\nand then a baby rabbit jumped out,\n\nshort-eared, to our surprise.\n\nSo soft!—a handful of intangible ash\n\nwith fixed, ignited eyes.\n\nToo pretty, dreamlike mimicry!\n\nO falling fire and piercing cry\n\nand panic, and a weak mailed fist\n\nclenched ignorant against the sky!\n\nRobert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop’s friendship spanned from 1947 until the end of Lowell’s life in 1977. They met when Lowell, as part of his appointment with the Library of Congress, was tasked with expanding its collection from just manuscripts and books to include recordings of poets reading their work. He immediately reached out to Robert Frost, William Carlos Williams, Randell Jarrell along with many others, and included an invitation to Elizabeth Bishop who had recently published North and South, which Lowell had written a positive review. They soon became fast friends.\n\nIn the summer of 1948, with fresh divorce decree in hand, Lowell went with his girl friend at the time, Carly Dawson to spend the summer in Maine to visit Elizabeth Bishop. Dawson, already twice divorced, soon faded on Lowell’s odd behavior and intensity and dumped him early on in the visit when Lowell immediately set his fascination upon Bishop shortly after their arrival. Lowell’s and Bishop’s fascination with each other would continue for the next three decades. It didn’t take long that summer for Lowell to profess his love for her and told his friends and even his family he was going to marry her. Bishop never took his exclamations of matrimony seriously and claims the two of them never slept together, though there was an intimacy in their intellectual connection that lasted far beyond what a likely physical romance would have lasted, given Lowell’s history in that regard.\n\nBy fall of 1948, with his position completed at the Library of Congress, Lowell headed to Yaddo, an arts commune near Saratoga, New York that still exists today. It is an eclectic place, then and now, that gives artists in residence a place to work and interact with other artists across a wide range of disciplines. Upon arrival he reconnected with Elizabeth Hardwick whom he had met before, a novelist and book reviewer, who was a sharp and thorny critic, and also apparently a font of juicy rumors about Alan Tate’s private life. In short, Hardwick was exactly the kind of intellectual challenge Lowell admired and it took no time for him to switch his gaze from one Elizabeth to another, Bishop to Hardwick.\n\nBishop is quoted as saying, “I never wanted to marry Robert Lowell, but I would have loved to have his baby.” I think it was a way of keeping her sexual history private. Bishop was a lesbian at a time that it was not easy to be out and open about being a lesbian. Bishop, in contrast to Berryman and Lowell who were celebrated for evolving confessional poetry, was very deliberate in her writing to separate her personal life from her poetry in all but its metaphors. Bishop traveled the world, enjoyed the freedom that a single life affords a woman of financial means; writing, painting and enjoying her journey.\n\nI find it intriguing that Bishop’s final published poem, published 3 weeks after her death in the New Yorker is titled Sonnet. She had published another Sonnet in 1928 that I have shared in an earlier Fourteenlines, but to my knowledge sonnets were not her forte. Is the title and its 14 lines a way to reach out to the past to departed friends, Lowell in particular, who had embraced 14 lines as sufficient space to encompass a lifetime? The poem is remarkable in its simplicity and imagery. I too have often been fascinated by the rainbows that live in the edges of beveled mirrors and the tiny bubble that exists in all of our spirit levels, fragile, yet permanent, resetting us on the level if we choose to course correct.\n\nSonnet\n\nby Elizabeth Bishop\n\nCaught — the bubble\n\nin the spirit level,\n\na creature divided;\n\nand the compass needle\n\nwobbling and wavering,\n\nundecided.\n\nFreed — the broken\n\nthermometer’s mercury\n\nrunning away;\n\nand the rainbow-bird\n\nfrom the narrow bevel\n\nof the empty mirror,\n\nflying wherever\n\nit feels like, gay!\n\n“You should always be trying to write a poem you are unable to write, a poem you lack the technique, the language, the courage to achieve. Otherwise you’re merely imitating yourself, going nowhere, because that’s always easiest.”\n\nJohn Berryman\n\nDream Songs 1\n\nby John Berryman (1914 – 1972)\n\nHuffy Henry hid the day,\n\nunappeasable Henry sulked.\n\nI see his point,—a trying to put things over.\n\nIt was the thought that they thought\n\nthey could do it made Henry wicked & away.\n\nBut he should have come out and talked.\n\nAll the world like a woolen lover\n\nonce did seem on Henry’s side.\n\nThen came a departure.\n\nThereafter nothing fell out as it might or ought.\n\nI don’t see how Henry, pried\n\nopen for all the world to see, survived.\n\nWhat he has now to say is a long\n\nwonder the world can bear & be.\n\nOnce in a sycamore I was glad\n\nall at the top, and I sang.\n\nHard on the land wears the strong sea\n\nand empty grows every bed.\n\nJohn Berryman and Robert Lowell met in 1944 at the suggestion of mutual friends and Lowell’s mother. Each was still married to their first wives at the time and it was thought that their socializing as couples would do them both some good. Ha! It probably did, but maybe not the way mothers intend. There are many similarities to their personal histories, temperaments, fierce intellect, vices and destructive personal decisions that it’s not a surprise they found enjoyment in one another’s company. When you have a tendency towards leaning into a bit of insanity and have a mirror to that fracturing in a friendship with someone of the same self destructive inclinations, it can help bring respite and lucidity once in a while, in that at least you know you are not alone in your state of mind.\n\nBerryman did not grow up with a silver spoon in his mouth. He succeeded in spite of his father’s betrayal. He succeeded on the sheer audacity of his talent and intellect. It does not mean that doors were not opened for him because he was white and male, but Berryman is a writer’s writer in my mind. Writing entirely consumed him as maybe the only thing that could keep him alive for as long as it did. Berryman died when he was 58, though he looks more like 78 at the end.\n\nI will turn the same age this year. I have written before on Fourteenlines that I walked across the bridge that Berryman jumped to his death probably a 1,000 times as a young man, on my way from classes on the East bank to the glass studio in the fine arts building at the time on the West bank. In every one of those passages I was completely unaware of Berryman’s fate, his poetry not yet in my consciousness. Despite spending 12 years on the same campus, treading the same paths, entering the same buildings, eating at the same greasy diners, while getting an undergraduate degree and graduate degree, I did not have the good fortune to overlap with Berryman in being physically at the same place at the same time. Looking back, that bridge holds more meaning for me today as a metaphor for the life I have tried to navigate the past 40 years. On one side of my river I have a foundation in practicality, academics and the industriousness to make a living to support myself and my family. On the other side lies the buttress with my heart and soul; creativity and expression. Through the middle of it runs my own mighty Mississippi of time, my bridge just beneath its singular falls on its entire stretch from Minnesota to a gulf, a hypoxia zone where not enough oxygen exists. Unlike Berryman, I do not have the talent or the ego to earn a living from my passions and so I shall have to continue to cross that metaphorical bridge every day and enjoy its views.\n\nI have wondered, as I think about the men and women of letters, who managed to stay productive and thrive into old age, is it because they did not see writing as their profession; William Carlos Williams and Wallace Stevens but two examples? Or was writing always such a thrill that it never became a chore? We will never know if writing kept Berryman and Lowell alive as long as it did, or whether winning Pulitzers, being crowned as “the” best, created such an unbearable weight of expectation to continue to be brilliant that it may have actually accelerated their own self destruction. Maybe Dickinson did it right? Fill your desk and dresser drawers with scraps of your brilliant self as postcards to your older self. Give your friends the best of your art in cards and thank you notes and gifts. Scatter your creativity throughout your house and those of your loved ones and don’t bother with putting it out there in the world beyond the reach of your own fingertips.\n\nAlmost every great poet is also a great translator. There are exceptions, but it is far too common to be a coincidence or a requirement. I have come to believe this tendency to translate is a solution to the problem of trying to be productive as an artist every day. Maybe there are people who can wake up every day with inspiration to write brilliantly? But I suspect, more people suffer from the same thing I observe in myself. Most days nothing comes of my efforts. Sometimes whole months or even a better part of a year goes by without my muse whispering in my ear. Writing is a craft as well as an art, and a writer that can wake up everyday and translate someone else’s brilliance, bringing it to a different mother tongue, that has yet to enjoy the satisfaction of the original poet’s humanity can feel productive and satisfied without the need to entirely create something on their own from nothing.\n\nLowell was an incredibly gifted translator. There is a silky smooth aspect to some of his translations, like the one below, that he rarely achieved with his own words, so much pent up emotions coursing through his veins, that it may have been impossible to find that level of calm when searching his own mind. Meditation is an example where the madness of Baudelaire is becalmed under the madness of Lowell and in its place resides a little pool of sonnet peace. Dive in!\n\nMeditation\n\nby Baudelaire\n\nTranslated by Robert Lowell\n\nCalm down, my Sorrow, we must move with care.\n\nYou called for evening; it descends, it’s here.\n\nThe town is coffined in its atmosphere,\n\nbringing relief to some, to others care.\n\nNow while the common multitude strips bare,\n\nfeels pleasure’s cat o’nine tails on its back,\n\nand fights off anguish at the great bazaar,\n\ngive me your hand, my Sorrow. Let’s stand back;\n\nback from these people! Look, the dead years dressed\n\nin old clothes crowd the balconies of the sky.\n\nRegret emerges smiling from the sea,\n\nthe sick sun slumbers underneath an arch,\n\nand like a shroud strung out form east to west,\n\nlisten, my Dearest, hear the sweet night march!"
